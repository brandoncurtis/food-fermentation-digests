Subject: Brewing Techniques Article on HBD




I just received the current issue of Brewing Techniques. There was a good
article written by Norm Pyle on the Homebrew Digest, which I was able to
show my wife and say 'here, this is what the HBD was and is about.'


A point made by Norm was that although thousands read the HBD, in a recent
survey it was discovered that virtually all the posts are made by approx.
100 people. I would have liked to see the list of the top 10 contributors.
I've got five bucks on Al K. being at the top of that list ;->


Speaking of BT, in HBD 1691, Jeff Wolf asks about Zima, and what it is. In
the last issue of BT (Jan/Feb ?) someome (sorry do not remember who, and do
not have the mag here in my office) did a bit of research and a nice write-up
on the 'Zima process'. It was very interesting, although the comical 
replacement of all occurrances of the letter 's' with the letter 'z' gave
me a headache halfway through the article. And it was not even that long 
of an article !

Subject: Honey I Primed The Beer




  My last creation was a Belgian, but I am a bit of a renegade so I brewed
with a lb of honey instead of malto-dextrin, I also primed with 3/4
cup honey. (about 3/4 lb I think) 
  Things got very interesting when I opened one up after only 6 days and
found the carbination was out of controll. I decided to refridgerate all
the beer to stop any further carbination. I noticed that the beer has a
very nice, slight, tast of honey.
  The honey I used was whipped and spreadable I wounder if this had any
effect on carb time?
  I think a problem with this method might be if the beer was allowed to
warm up for a few days it would over carbinate. This also means that you
could not age the beer for months, in say the basement. 


  FYI: I used that 1214 Banana yeast, The flavor is only present in the
first sip and then it is not noticable at all. The beer has got rave
reviews by all, and I am waiting to bring some to my first KLOB home 
brew club meeting next month.

Agreed, but that issue was never the question.  We'd expect that wort will
*never* be in a 100% oxygen environment.  The issue was whether or not you
can saturate wort with oxygen using air *in a standard atomosphere*.  IOW
can you get the 8.55ppm oxygen (in water, now) using air alone.


Put yet another way, I think Carl was asserting you can dissolve as much
oxygen in wort using air as you can using pure oxygen, given the wort is 
in a standard atmosphere (like, uh, your house).  Is THAT true or not?

Sorry, but this is not correct.  As far as I am aware, there is no 
Bernoulli "effect", just the Bernoulli equation, which basically says 
that a flowing liquid has three "types" of energy: velocity, 
pressure, and elevation, and that the sum of these is constant 
(ideally, not counting for flow friction).  So say you have flow 
through a level pipe (elevation energy is constant) and the pipe 
diameter suddenly decreases.  Conservation of mass says the flow must 
be faster in the smaller pipe (higher velocity energy), so the 
pressure energy must drop to keep the sums constant.  THIS is the 
Venturi effect.  This drop in pressure of a flowing liquid is what 
"sucks" the air in through the hole in your racking tube.  So, the 
Bernoulli equation is what explains the Venturi effect.  That is 
their relationship.  I hope THIS helps ;-)

One more note on the Venturi Vs Bernoulli discussion:  If the above 
descibed change in pressure is great enough (ie the fluid pressure is 
less than the vapor pressure) then cavitation (spontaneous 
vaporization) will occur.  This is what I beleive Dr. Pratte was 
referring to.  So the Venturi effect can explain cavitation, but is 
not defined by it.

Perhaps the extract was mis-labeled or you thought you used M&F, but actually
used Laaglander or "Dutch" DME.  If it was indeed Laaglander or "Dutch" DME,
then 1020 is the correct FG.  Underaeration can be a problem with high-gravity
beers (i.e. high alcohol), but I wouldn't call a 1050 beer "high-gravity."
Since your wort was all-malt, I don't think nutrients are your problem.
Aerating after fermentation has started will elevate diacetyl levels, but
aerating after the beer is done will just oxidize alcohols into aldehydes
and the beer will smell and taste "off."  So, no sloppy racking or carboy
shaking...


>P.S. -- Has anyone tried Blue Ridge Lager by micro Rainbow Ridge Brewing Co.


I tried it and thought it was quite enjoyable for an American Light Lager.
Better flavour and balance than most American Light Lagers.  I'm not a fan
of this style (I prefer ales) but if confronted with the choice of Blue Ridge
and the industrial megabrews, I'd drink the Blue Ridge.  I've also heard that
this brewery has beers coming in red and white bottles by July 4th and then
black, green and yellow bottles for the Olympics.  Perhaps some of their
other beers will be ales...

I believe it is due to variety and age.  Also, my homegrown hops had a very
grassy aroma till I dried them, so improper or insufficient drying could
lend a grassy note, but for commercially made hop pellets, I would think this
would be very unlikely.  I believe what I said on this subject before is that
different varieties tend to take on different smells as they age.  Some are
"piney" some "grassy" others "cheezy."

Dryhopping will give different aromatic qualities to your beer than adding
finishing hops.  It is impossible to quantify these characteristics, so I
won't even try to explain them, you just have to try it.  Nonetheless, there
is no reason that dryhopping means you have to use finishing hops or vice
versa.  There is also no reason that you could not do both in the same batch.
The short boil will boil-off some of the aromatics and may change others
slightly which is why you get different aromas from the two methods of adding
hop aroma to your beer.  I will resist the temptation... the facts are enough.

If you have high carbonate water, dark grain (a bit more than grams per
batch) will lower your mash pH and thus reduce polyphenol extraction from
the husks, but were talking about a minimum of 4 or 8 ounces in a 5gallon
batch to make a difference.  I can't see why it would reduce oxidation unless
the thought is that a beer with more melanoidins (*not* the source of colour
in black malt, I believe) would be less likely to suffer from off-flavours when
it is fresh (the melanoidins give the oxygen up as the beer ages).  If indeed
this is where this rumour began, it hinges on whether black malt gets its
colour from melanoidins or not.  I believe it doesn't.

Unless the pH is high, there should be no more fear of tannin (polyphenol)
extraction from 212F water than from 170F water, but what you *should*
be concerned about is unconverted starch extraction.  If your crush is
fine and your conversion good, then the amount of unconverted starch is
probably negligible and there is little reason for concern, but if you
are getting a permanent haze that is not temperature-dependent, then it
could be starch.

Let's remember that there are two types of cloudy wheat beers.
The cloudiness in Bavarian Weizens is due to the pouring of the yeast from
the bottom of the bottle into the glass and not from the wheat.  The cloudiness
in the Belgian White style of beer is indeed from protein and most (all?)
Belgian white brewers use raw wheat as Jack is proposing, so without long
glucan and protein rests, you probably will have a cloudy beer.  I don't know
what the gelatine will do to so much protein, however.

I have brewed every one of my 200+ batches with a partially covered kettle
where the condensate on the inside of the lid *DID* drip back into the
kettle and neither I, nor any judge who has tasted my beer, have sensed
any DMS or other undesirable aromatics in any of my beers.  However, 99% of
them have been ales and the evolving CO2 does scrub out remaining DMS, so
Jim's advice may be more important for lager brewers where the CO2 evolution
is much slower.  Just a few datapoints.

I have not tried to filter any of the beers I've made with the D-C Pale
Ale malt, but have never had any problems with slow or turbid lautering.
I did have problems with excessive cold break and a slight, irritating
permanent haze which I eliminated with a 30-minute protein rest at 135-140F.


Would elevated beta-glucan levels result in excessive cold break?  Should I
instead try a beta-glucan rest and bypass the protein rest?

I shouldn't be so hard on pellets.  We had a bad experience with
pellets at various stages of our process and haven't used them
since.  I ain't a pellet fella.  There may be a legion of inverters
who use them religiously.  Your milage could quite possibly differ
by a considerable amount.  Minimal exposure is why we invert.
We ferment in a root cellar off my brother's basement.  Before we
cleaned it up, I was afraid to go in there.  There are still some
cracks in the foundation that bring in outside air and masses of
crickets.  We think we stopped the flooding, but won't know until
we get rain.  Anyway, it's not an ideal fermentation room.  When
we started to use it, we went upside down to eliminate racking
from primary to secondary.  Our fermentation is completely closed
from chiller to keg.  I've never siphoned so I can't relate to
your troubles.  I won't detail our stand.  We used two-by-fours
that we had a pile of and made it up as we went.  She is a beauty
though.  Go crazy and hang your inverted carboy from the ceiling
or bolt it to a wall.  Hey, concrete is cheap!

Thanks for all the responses pointing out how to use real apricots in my
attempt to clone Pyramid Apricot Ale.


Those responses are missing the point somewhat in that I am curious as
to the use of apricot essence to clone this product.  I have personally
spoken with a brewmaster at Pyramid who confirmed for me that their
apricot ale is made using the same essence that I purchased.


Thus, my curiosity is how to duplicate Pyramid's product using the same
apricot essence.  If you have any ideas on this, please post to the HBD

Subject: SABCO keg experience? / Pauls Malt? / Wyeast 1968 report




With warm weather coming on, I've decided to move the brewery out of the
kitchen and into the garage. Toward this end, I've decided to bite the
bullet and purchase a ready-made keg/brewpot (my wife won't let me near
power tools). I've seen the SABCO keg with the brass ball valve attached.
Has anyone worked with this and is there any thing I should know about
before I part with $100 for this baby?


- ---


I recently purchased 55 lbs of British 2-row malt made by Pauls or something
like that. Has anyone worked with it. I tried 4 lbs of it in my last batch
together with my last 4 pounds of M&F malt and I had more trouble than usual
getting clear runoff. Of course, this could just be me having a bad day.
Thought I'd ask, though.


- ---


This is an update to some earlier posts of mine regarding troubles I was
having with Wyeast 1968 (London ESB). I had made 3 batches with problematic
(sluggish, incomplete) fermentations. To recap, my problems were in three areas:


1. This yeast goes to sleep if outside temps get much below 68F, which is
common in my house during the winter.


2. This yeast needs lots of oxygen


3. You should ideally pitch a lot of yeast, as much as for lagers.


The key here is that 1968 is HIGHLY flocculent and many people suggested
frequent arousing/agitation. The problem is that once this yeast "goes to
sleep", it's hard to wake it up. I believe that pitching lotsa yeast helps,
my problem is that I don't often plan my brewing far enough in advance to
build up a sufficient starter - I'm lucky if I get 2 ounces of slurry. The
oxygen part I'm working on...


Now the update: I brewed two more batches. On the first (or fourth overall),
I pitched the yeast cake from the secondary of a previous batch.
Unfortunately, I had technical problems with my aerator and was only able to
aerate the wort for about 90 seconds. Results - lag time of about 24 hours,
fermentation about 9-10 days, final gravity of about 1.014 (from an original
SG of 1.48). OK, enough to convince me that there is some truth to 3
(above). Next (most recent) batch. Pitched with usual 2 ounces of slurry but
aerated wort for 2 hours. Also, acting on a tip from a member of my
brewclub, I agitated the wort about once an hour for the first 5 or six
hours (until I went to bed). Lag time about 12-14 hours with a final gravity
of 1.012 (down from 1.050) after 7 days. OK, now I'm sold on 2 (above). I
kept the temps as near to 68F as I could for both batches.


Conclusion: This yeast has a really distinctive flavor profile that I really
enjoy, otherwise I would not have put up with this much trouble. However,
I'm not convinced that this yeast is worth the trouble (for me). By the way,
even though this yeast is so flocculent, the resulting beers all have a
yeasty taste. I don't know if this just the nature of the yeast or a result
of the long exposure to the yeast during primary fermentation. I don't
normally fine my beers unless they're really turbid. Still looking for that
perfect English ale yeast...

   I also have seen an old bottle named Evan's Ale at my cousin's camp in
Randolph Vt. Your statement about the lack history of ale brewing in the North
East is wrong. In upstate NY historical records indicate that Goosen Gerritsen
a brewer by trade arrived in Beverwyck(Albany) in 1636, and leased the
Patoon's(Kilean Van Rensselaer) brewery in 1649 with Rutger Jacobson, a river
boat owner. The pair brewed 57,000 gallons of beer their first year. Ale
brewing was the only kind of beer brewed up until the 1800's

Isn't this contest just for Bavarian-style rauchbier ?
Or is it open to other sorts of smoked beers ? Peat smoked malt and

I was under the impression that it was solely for Bavarian Rauchbier,

Henry's law required a dilute solution; the solubility of 100 % O2 in water
at one atmosphere is 40.9 ppm; this is sufficiently dilute for Henry's law.

No, the amount of dissolved oxygen in water AT EQUILIBRIUM is proportional
to the concentration of oxygen in the space above the liquid. If I put
water in a container and pressurize the container to 2 atmospheres with
air, at equilibrium there will be 2 times more air in solution than at one
atmosphere. The so-called "saturation level" (40.9 ppm) of oxygen in water
is simply the equilibrium amount reached at one atmosphere pure oxygen at
25 C. There is nothing magical about this "saturation level", I can easily
exceed it by pressurization.

Subject: Hoptech Shipping Problems


     Fellow HBD'ers:
     
     I recently received an order from HOPTECH which had a number of 
     problems and was wondering if any one else has had problems, or if 
     this was an isolated case. First of all I ordered from them based on 
     their very informative and promissing catalog, I just wish all the 
     promises made in the catalog were true. The problems I had were:
     
     - I requested 3 day shipping which was not done, I paid an extra $5 
     for 8 day shipping.
     
     - The shipment was short one bottle of fruit extract.
     
     - All contents of the package were coated with raspberry extract, but 
     none of the packing material or Wyeast packages were coated. Neither 
     was the box.
     
     - Was missing "Detailed Instructions" for using the fruit extract.
     
     - The grains ordered as crushed were not.
     
     - The packages of Hops were not marked with the oil content or Alpha % 
     rating.
     
     - The grains were not marked with the actual LOV rating.
     
     I know some of these seem minor, but again I ordered from them based 
     on the catalog which promissed all of this, and when I add them all up 
     it seems they have a problem. When I contacted the company they 
     offered to reship the grains and fruit extract and they gave me the 
     rating information that was missing from the packages. I requested 
     they fax me the extract instructions, which as of this morning I still 
     have not received.
     
     This morning I also had a message from them that I file a claim with 
     UPS for a damaged shipment. I am convinced that the shipment was 
     repacked, the box was dry, but I am not convinced that UPS was at 
     fault. I will politely inform Hoptech that I did not contract with 
     UPS, they did, so the claim should come from them. I also do not want 
     to get caught in the middle.
     
     Has anyone else had problems with ordering supplies from Hoptech, or 
     any mail order supply? This was my first attempt at mail order and I'm 
     not sure if there is any advantage.
     
     TIA.

I've read all I could find on yeast -- Papazian's "Joy" and
"Companion", zymurgy's "Yeast & Beer", YEAST.FAQ, Dave Draper's
"Culturing", and various other tidbits on the net.  A few questions
for those in the know:


1.  One article in zymurgy's "Yeast and Beer" issue states that lager
yeasts tend to ferment trisaccharides, ale yeasts do not.  Are these
trisaccharides responsible for the fruity characteristics of ales?
    Is it the temperature or the yeast that determines whether
trisaccharides are fermented?  (Would a lager yeast at ale temps leave
these sugars alone?)


2.  Is it CO2 production that determines whether yeast is top- or
bottom-fermenting?  That is, do yeasts at warmer temps produce enough
CO2 to get bubbled up to the top, while yeasts at colder temps
produce CO2 slowly and therefore remain at the bottom?
    Or is there something inherent (weight? cell structure?) to the
yeasts that determine where they do their thing?
    (Are lager yeasts at ale temps, such as in steam beers, bubbled to
the top and considered top-fermenting?)

difficult.  I've got colonies of three Wyeast strains living quietly

I thought I was lucky when I got a bench capper for $2 at a flea market.
(Especially since my _wife_, without whom I wouldn't have been there to
begin with, pointed it out to me.  :)


Now, I met this new brewer, friend of a friend, who _gave_ me a regulator.  
The only problem is that the knob is stuck so I guess it's now
non-adjustable.  Before he gave it to me he said that it would only work at
low pressure, which sounded fine to me, I just won't force carbonate; no
problem with that. 


Now that I have it though, I am wondering if I should try to dismantle it and
lubricate it with something.  I can see through a slit in the knob that there 
is some rust on a spring inside the knob.  Is it a good idea to try to take it
apart?  Does anybody have any experience, and/or horror stories to share?

Subject:  Lager Yeast Lag Time


I've searched the archives, but I haven't really found an answer to this
question, so I'm going to post it to the wisdom of the HBD.


I recently brewed an Oktoberfest style, part extract, part mash, and
pitched a Wyeast 2178 Lager yeast blend without a separate starter.  The
yeast was fresh and the packet swelled vigorously.


I am trying to maintain lager fermentation temperatures for the first time,
and after pitching I took the whole batch down to about 48 F.  It has been
three days now and there is no activity from the yeast.  I did find
evidence in the archives AGAINST starting these yeasts warm and then
cooling them down, so I've tried to maintain the cold temperatures
continuously since pitching.


Question is, will this yeast go ahead and start?  I expected that lag
times would be longer given the cold temperature, but since this is my
first truly cold lager, I don't have a baseline to judge by.  My homebrew
shop said "Oh, take it out and let it warm up, and it'll get going."
This is exactly what I'm trying to avoid.


And as someone said the other day, I don't want to relax, and I am worrying!
Mostly about infection in the meantime.  I've gotten enough other bad advice
from CP that the old RDWHAHB is starting to ring a little stale as well...

Subject: straws / fermentap "replica"


I'd like to point out the value of those ribbed straws that come with
32oz screw-top water bottles.  I push one in the outlet of my cooler
(it fits perfectly -- no leaks) and bend it up and hook the cap end
under the cooler's handle.   I then boil my sparge water and throw it
in the cooler; by the time I finish mashing, the temp is just right,
and I uncap the straw, lower it to the mash-tun, and swirl it around.


I use the same straw as a siphon starter.  I push it in the low end of
my siphon and begin sucking; when the beer comes down, I pull out the
straw and direct the siphon into the carboy/bottling bucket.


This versatile straw was a key component of my hand-crafted
Fermentap, which I made as follows:


* carboy, with handle
* orange two-tubed carboy cap
* racking cane
* two lengths of tubing
* airlock
* string
* one of the aforementioned straws


1. Place the cap on the carboy.


2. Push the straight end of the racking cane through the larger tube
on the cap, to the bottom of the carboy.


3. Attach one length of tubing to the curved end of the racking cane.
Stick the airlock into the free end of the tubing.


4. Attach second length of tubing to the smaller tube on the carboy
cap.  Stick the ribbed straw into the free end of the tubing.


5. Remove the cap and put a batch of beer in the carboy.


6. Replace cap and tie it down tight with string, using the carboy
handle as an anchor.


7. Invert the carboy, keeping both tubes above beer-level.  (A bar
stool without a seat works well.)


8. "Tie the tubes" above beer level, to the carboy (or back of
barstool.)


9.  Once fermentation kicked in, CO2 bubbled through the racking cane
and out the airlock.  To rack to the secondary, I simply lowered the
tube with the straw, let the muck run out, and then fed it into
another carboy.

Subject: Brewers of South Suburbia Competition Results


Here are the results from the 1995 Brewers of South Suburbia
Homebrew Competition (average score in parentheses).  Please
note, that in some cases lower scores are listed for higher
ranking beers -- this is because there were two flights for
the style and a "second round" without scoring was used to
determine the winners from to top beers in each "first round"
flight.  Altogether there were 187 entries.  The caterories
were adjusted because some of the initial categories received 
more beers than expected and others received less than expected.
For example, "Barleywines and Strong Ales" had 19 entries!
There were also 7 Imperial Stouts which were broken out of the
Stout category, leaving 11 non-Imperials.
