In HBD #1693, Al Korzonas comments on the cloudiness in wheat beers. In
patricular:


  >> The cloudiness in Bavarian Weizens is due to the pouring of the yeast
  >> from the bottom of the bottle into the glass and not from the wheat.


Is that right? I have experienced many weizens and hefeweizens that have
demonstrated chill haze in the bottle (No agitation; just sitting in the
fridge). It is not inconceivable that this could be due to yeast, but I'd
offer that pouring has little or nothing to do with it since the delicious
nectar remains under cap in the bottle ;-) Acts just like any other chill
haze, too. There when cold, gone when warm.


Particular examples would include Tuchers and Ayingers Dunkels and Helles
Hefeweizens - I cite these as they are most recent in my memory. Hopefully,
I'm not drinking some mutated versions of these brews.


Just some observations. No disrespect intended...

Subject:       hoptech mail order


Jay Richards mentioned in today's issue some problems with an order 
from hoptech, and was wondering if this type of thing was common or 
not.  I have been using hoptech for some time now, and have found 
them to be prompt, helpful, and professional.  Living in the great 
outback of Wyoming, it is difficult to get supplies locally, so mail 
order is my only option.  I have tried several mail order businesses, 
and have had a few problems with most.  I think it is the nature of 
the business, the real proof is in how you are treated if a problem 
does arise. Hoptech gives good service at good prices, and I would 
hate to see a rumor get started that they are no good! Sometimes 
stuff happens.

Subject: UPS Shipping Homebrew


Today I got the UPS B...S... of not shipping bottles. I brought some
homebrew into the UPS customer counter, packed in a Beer Across America 
box, to ship to a local competition, and because the bottles moved around 
a little, the clerk wanted to look into the box. When she discovered that 
the bottles were filled with beer, she said that under no circumstances 
can she ship them. She pulled out a handwritten note stating that beer 
and wine can be shipped by distributers only!!!


Is something going on with UPS? Are they cracking down on our shipments
to competitions? She looked like she was waiting for the opportunity to
find beer or wine and refuse shipment.


A while back, someone posted that it was OK to ship with UPS. They even 
produced the Section and code number from the UPS guidelines. Could you 
please post the rules again?

RE: HBD 1691 Douglas O'Brien says:

a) How does roller 1 turn roller 2--that is, how are the two coupled 
   then, if at all?


b) Would you say the knurling is full-depth and somewhat 'sharp',
   or does it appear to be shallow knurling with a smoother surface?


c) Ball bearings or bronze bushings?




Wooden Barrels (Casks)

At a homebrew shop in Denver I saw a ~5 gal wooden cask displayed

anyone know of a source and/or how much these barrels cost retail?

Has anyone innoculated slants using samples taken from the

When I visited the brewery last August, I sampled the apricot and thought it
tasted a lot like the way I would expect a "wine cooler" to taste.  Can't
imagine why you'd want to brew one, but I also can't understand why it sells
so well, either.  Different strokes, I suppose....


ANYWAY, the person giving the tour commented that some of the people there
don't like brewing it because the use of the apricot extract offends their
sense of purity.  She also said something about it not having any hops.  That
caught my ear, and I asked whether she meant that literally, or simply that it
was hopped very lightly (and compared to their wonderful pale ale very lightly
could still mean a decent number of IBUs ;-) ).  Her response to my question
was "No hops."  I started to ask whether other herbs were used as a substitute
for hops, but by then the tour guide's talk went on to other matters.


Can anyone confirm what I heard about the lack of hops in the brew?  If it's
true, that should help our would-be Pyramid Apricot homecloners.


Now go have a beer,

Subject: Stuck Fermentations and the Dry Malt Extract Theory


        I've read a number of postings recently from extract brewers with
stuck fermentation/high FG problems. I have been there, and I am there
right now with two batches (a lager and an ale).
        Let's assume that all of the conventional advice for this problem
has been followed (pitched plenty of yeast from an active starter, aerated
the shit out of the wort, controlled my ferment temperatures, re-pitched
with fresh yeast, blah, blah blah). I still have a problem with some
batches not fermenting out.
        I recently went through the notes for ALL of my brews, the good
ferments, the OK ferments (O.G.=1.050, F.G.=1.024) and the bad ones
(O.G.=1.046, Stuck at 1.030!) and FOUND a common thread- DRY MALT EXTRACT.
The good ferments had none, the OK ones had some, and the bad ones had all
dry extract.
        Since I have used various dry malt extracts, I couldn't blame my
problem on their quality, so I figured the problem has to be my procedure.
I recently read in one of the handbooks (Miller?) that the dry malt extract
should be re-hydrated
by slowly stirring into warm water. I have not done this and believe now
that this is at the crux of my problem.
        I generally use some sort of specialty malt or grain (e.g. crystal)
in my extract brews, which I steep in a bag in my water during the heat up
and pull out of the water just prior to boiling. I then just tossed my dry
malt extract into the boil and it would glob up into some disgusting hard
rock which further boiling would eventually melt.
        FINALLY, my questions to collective brewing mind: Was I forming the
dreaded caramelized sugars by dumping the dry malt directly into boling
water? Are these sugars unfermentable, thus boosting my F.G's through the
roof? Is there a yeast that will ferment them, or a process I can use to
save the brew? Short of a hot new idea from you folks, I plan to
specifically brew up a batch or two of dry, low F.G. brews (lots of corn
sugar and highly attenuative ingredients) and blend them off prior to
bottling.
        Private e-mail responses are fine, but some of your knowledge on
this topic may be of general interest, in which case a posting may be
appropriate. Thanks in advance.

I think that you severly underpitched this batch.  For my PU clone I
used the packet to up to a 3/4gallon starter for a 9 gallon batch.
There still wasn't that much yeast settement and the starter was still
turbid so i had to pitch the liquid.  I had cooled the wort to 55F, or
so, and imediately put the fermenter in the 50F frig after pitching. I
was worried the next morning because i didn't see a big kreusen(sp).
So i think i under pitched.  By later that day, 24 hours later, i had
fermentation underway.


Through this process I came to the conslusion that the only way to
really get a decient pitching quanity is to brew several batches
of increasing size and pitch from one to the next.  You could start
with a 500ml pitch from the packet.  Next go to a 2l test batch.  Next
brew a 3gallon batch, and repitch this into your 10gallon batch. You
don't have to throw away the beer on top of the later starters.
Ferment them out and store the beer in 1l or 2l pet bottles in the
frig.  It's a lot of brewing but that's what this is all about.  It'll
give you a chance to try different grain combos or hops.  Just aim for
the same OG in each batch.

Subject: Lead crystal/gout/supergeniuses




Jeff Wolf asks whether liqour (whiskey in particular) stored
in a lead crystal decanter can develop a dangerous lead con-
centration over time.  According to Irving M. Klotz in 
Journal of Chemical Education (volume 71, number 12, December
1994, page 1015) the answer is YES.  For example, a sample of
whiskey taken from a decanter in the home of one of his 
colleagues was found to hold 2.587 milligrams of lead per
liter.  Port held in a lead crystal decanter less than
one year contained 203 micrograms/liter (IMHO this could be
accounted for from the lead containing foil over the bottle
the port was shipped in).  In any event, lead blocks excretion
of uric acid by the kidneys, leading to gout.  In  the 18th
century, Klotz tells us, gout was endemic to Britain, apparently
due to the practice of storing port, sherry, madeira, etc. in
lead crystal containers.  (Peer pressure wins again).  This lead
to the belief among the wealthy classes of Britain that gout
is associated with genius intelligence.  So Jeff, if your friend
continues drinking spirits from lead crystal, he can contract
gout and join the ranks of "supergeniuses" such as Alexander the
Great, Ben Franklin, Sir Isaac Newton, Tennyson, and even Luther.

Subject: Re: Hoptech Shipping Problems


Jay Richards was describing a problem with a recent Hoptech order. It was 
an almost perfect description of an order I just made with then.  I must 
say, after a few calls, they DID fix the problems with the order.  I 
wasn't going to post my problem with them, but it seems there may be a 
serious quality control problem that needs be be brought out, and 
hopefully corrected.






 - I ordered a Bavarian Wheat beer kit (possibly not the exact name, the 
catalog is at home), and only received a bucket of extract and a notice 
that the yeast was on backorder.  There were no hops or instructions.






   -- I called saying I only received the extract and was told the rest 
would be sent.  I finally received the yeast and hops, but no 
instructions.  I could have brewed without instructions, but this was 
becoming a matter of principle. I called again and they faxed it to me 
within an hour.






   -- According to the instructions, and the AHA style guide, my OG 
should have better than 1.040. The actual OG was 1.027!  This almost 
leads me to believe that there may have been more missing from the kit 
than I thought.  I guess it will be the kind of beer only AB could love 
:-)






 - Also in the order was a 12lb bucket of extract and a packet of liquid 
lager yeast.  The box was packed with the 12lb bucket on top of the yeast 
packet!  I feel very lucky that the yeast had not been activated!






I really hate to see this happen. From their catalog they seem to be a 
first rate company with a wide variety of products. If they correct these 
problem I would be happy to patronize them in the future.

Subject: Wyeast 1968


Adding my 2 cents to the comments about Wyeast 1968 in HBD 1693 made by
Rich Lenihan....


I was out of touch with homebrewing for the past 6 months (moving to a new
house and trying to set-up an area that would accommodate brewing). To
christen my new brewing area I decided to make up an E.S.B. Although the
recipe I came up with (only ever made one batch of beer from a published
recipe) was slightly darker than the AHA style guidelines, bitterness, malts,
O.G. and alcohol were within guidelines. For the brew I decided to try 
Wyeast 1968.


To give a bit of background, I have always done partial boils (3-3.5 gallons) 
with extract. Aeration was never a great concern because I would splash 2
gallons of cold water into a carboy. Then using a nylon strainer, strain the
cooled wort into the awaiting water. Next I would cap my carboy and do the
rolling carboy rhumba for about 15-20 minutes. This has always given me more
than adequate aeration for my worts before pitching yeast... or so I thought.


With the liquid wyeast cultures, I always allowed them to incubate and would
pitch directly into my wort (without using a starter). Now, with my E.S.B.
(not only to christen the house, but also in honor of tax time) appropriately
titled "Got 'Dem Ole' I.R.S. Bitter Blues", after pitching the yeast it was a
good 48 hours before the yeast began a good healthy fermentation. It has now
been 9 days since pitching and the yeast is finally showing signs of slowing.
My concern is that I may not get a complete fermentation. What is the best way
to "wake up" the yeast and at the same time, minimize any chance of
contamination?

I know that this isn't a physics BB, but what-the-heck --


It's been a long time since Physics 201 for me, but Webster's dictionary
gives a nice definition of "Bernoulli effect" and nothing for "Venturi
effect."  Bernoulli's *LAW* quantifies the Bernoulli effect, which explains
how a venturi works.  A venturi requires a restriction in the fluid stream
to raise the velocity and lower the pressure, which is not what is happening
when you drill holes in the wall of constant-diameter tubing.  I think John
is correct.  Regardless, the dang things work for aerating wort.  --  Pier

How quickly did you lower the temperature?
My take on this is that an abrupt change in temp. may have shocked the 
yeast into (hopefully) temporary dormancy.  For my first and only lager 
attempt, I used Wyeast American Lager (#????), which is notably 
temperature-sensitive.  I let the pack incubate, pitched, and fermented 
for one day, all at 75 F (per package instructions).  After 24 h, the 
batch was bubbling vigorously.  I then turned off the heater, insulated 
the fermenter with some old clothes, and let the batch cool to my 
December room temp (about 45F, brrrr).  The yeast expressed their 
displeasure by ceasing all activity for over 2 days before resuming a 
somewhat subdued fermentation.  Yes, I was worried, and having homebrews 
did not help the matter.


Hopefully, your yeasties will acclimate and resume their duties soon.

Someone mentioned priming their beer with 3/4 cup of honey.  I hope you've

Subject: Lambic Offer


Hi all,


Just was looking through the latest mailing from Sam Adams and
came across an intersting article on brewing Lambic beer.


For those of you that don't know what a Lambic is, it is a
spontainiously(sp?) fermented ale.  That means that the beer is
naturually fermented without the aid of any added yeasts. (Allthough
I'll bet some breweries do add some cultured natural occuring
yeast. )  Anyway, the wort is prepared and then allowed to cool in
large flat cooling trays in a room with the windows open.  This
allows the wild yeasts and bacteria to blow in from the outside and
innoculate the wort.  The only place in the world where the proper
microflora exsist is Belgium, so "Don't try this at home" :-)


The resulting brew is extremly complex, tart, fruity.... generally
speaking quite wonderful and distinctive.  Sometimes fruit is added
to make a special beer.  Examples of these beers are St. Louis Gueze
(I know I spelled that wrong)  Lindemans, Timmermans, and Boon.


Anyway, one of the challenges of the home brewer has been to try
to duplicate this difficult style.  You have to have the right
proportions of wild beasties to create the balance in the flavor.
Well is seems that it has been done by Boston Beer Co, of Sam Adams
fame.  It appears that they received so many complaints from
homebrewers and beer enthusiasts about the "slaughter" of the lambic
appelation with their Cranberry Lambic, that they decieded to make
good and actually create a proper example.  I quote..."With the
cooperation of Lindemans and Boon Brewerie, we were allowed to take dust
samples from the rafters and window sills from the cooling room.  After
several attempts to culture from the samples we managed to isolate
nearly 200 different varities of wild yeast and bacteria.  These
cultures did not however, create a beer as authentic as those
actually brewed in Belgium.  Only when we hit upon the idea that
the proper organizims would be located only in the air, did we
manage to hit the style on the head. By carefully obtaining a sealed
case of Framboise from the brewery and transporting it to our brewey,
then forcing sterilized air though a hole in the box and bubbling it
through a starter wort, we captured the elusive bug.  We then washed
and rinsed each bottle with the wort and allowed it to drain into
the culture.


After isolating the rare bacteria, we discovered it was previously
unknown to brewing science.  Aptly dubbed and trademarked "Pediococcus kochus"
after Jim Koch.  In keeping with last years promotion of the rare hops
sales to homebrewers, we will be providing cultures to interested parties
for a fee."


Advice from the article also stated that is is extremly easy to
duplicate the style with the use of this culture.  All the homebrew
has to do is brew a 20% wheat light ale and pitch a starter from this
culture. Ferment at around 70F for about three weeks.  Also it states
that for a higher success rate the beer should be brewed only once a
year on April fools day. ;-0

Subject: HBD in BT


Well, I guess I have a little explaining to do about my HBD feature in
_Brewing Techniques_.  The survey I was quoting was done by Rob Gardner, and
the information was given to me sort of casually, i.e. it wasn't meant to be
conclusive or scientific.  His survey was over a one-month period, which in
retrospect is definitely too small a sample to draw conclusions from.  Don't
get me wrong though, this was my fault, not his.  I consider myself a regular
contributor, but I often go more than a month without posting.


Spencer's numbers show a more accurate picture, as they have been gathered
over almost 3 months:


>Here's a table of the number of people who have made "N" or more posts:
>
>1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8       9       10
>895     387     217     142     90      68      50      38      33      25


Applying a little common sense to the numbers, I'd throw out all of the
contributors who've only posted once so far this year - someone who posts
once every three months probably isn't carrying much of the information load
of the digest.  This isn't completely valid though, since newbies sometimes
post the same article twice in one day (this happened just this week), and
others like Dr. Fix post rarely but their postings carry a good deal of
weight, i.e. information.


I guess I should have said done more research on this.  If so, I'd probably
have said something like, "a recent survey shows that, though thousands of
people read the information presented, the vast majority of the digest
articles are written by only a few hundred people".  I should have verified
that information, instead of taking it and running with it as I did.  (ACCKK!
I've become one of those careless non-fact-checking journalists I've been
lampooning for so long!).  Now Spencer, let's talk about how you got YOUR
numbers... :-)  Sorry about the misinformation, folks.


Cheers,

 My first order with them, they forgot to send the hops, then they sent
 the wrong ones.  Other than that (and slow deliverey on another order)
 they have done okay.

Subject: lead in crystal


Hi Brewers,
        Oh, boy, my first post. Regarding Jeff Wolf's question about 
lead leaching from the crystal into the old whiskey: won't happen.
Two reasons: First, there is way too much silica in the matrix for 
leaching to occur.  Those old, lead pottery glazes are way high in 
lead and auxilliary fluxes, so the soluble lead oxide is free to go on 
its way.
        Second: There ain't any lead there.  My old glaze calc teacher 
told us once that the glass industry uses lead in crystal as a 
purifier.  The lead is added to the cullet mix with the other, trace 
fluxes.  At high temperatures, the lead boils off taking impurities 
with it.  Thus, that wonderful, clear lead crystal.
        I hope that clears things up a bit.
                                        Prost!

Subject: Legalizing Beer making in MO


All Homebrewers in Missouri--


There is a bill before the Missouri Senate (Senate bill 468) that will allow
the legalization of beer and winemaking for household consumption.


Please contact Sen. James Matthewson to persuade him to let the bill go to
the floor for a vote.  Also contact your local senator to let him/her know you
 are a homebrewer and want this bill to pass.


If you are not from Missouri and homebrewing is legal, great.  If not, then
persuade your state government to legalize homebrewing.

Subject: Using honey to prime


Hello everyone.  There has been some discussion lately on honey beers.  There
was also a post several days ago by someone who used 3/4 cup of honey to prime
with, which resulted in WAY-overcarbonated beer.  Is there anyone else who
has experience with using honey to prime?  I will be brewing a honey Maibock
soon and would like to prime with honey to get a bit of flavor from the honey.
Papazian's new book says to use 1 cup of honey to prime, but I am wary of this
because of the info posted here.  To the person who primed with honey (sorry
I forgot who it was), are you *sure* that the beer was done fermenting
completely? (ie, did you take hydrometer readings?)  No offense, but maybe
the reason why the beer was overcarbonated was because it wan't fully
fermented out.  Anyway, I'd appreciate hearing more about this. TIA!!

"Chesapeake Homebrew", telephone is (410) 655-7987.  I have no affiliation,\
but their prices are great and they are really nice people.  Give 'em
a call and request a catalog.

They are not coupled (except by the grain that is).

The knurling appears full-depth and 'sharp'.


>c) Ball bearings or bronze bushings?  


Neither, the end of the rollers fit through the ~1/2" thick end plates.


Cheers,
