If you do use it inside make sure your fire insurance is paid up
and any precious items removed from the house. I used to use stoves
now I live by a propane cooker BUT AT A PRICE! I always cook outside of
the house/garage/basement. There are two main reasons for that... 
(1) The propane cookers will suck all of the air out of your house if they
    are not getting a good dose of ventilation.
(2) CAN YOU SAY EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE (I.E. DANGEROUS)
(3) BUT... If you have a propensity for using Gas Grills inside your house
    by all means go right ahead ;-)

Color me amazed.


Last night I went to a local beer tasting event (for the benefit of the
Humane Society:  nothing makes me feel quite as good as drinking beer
for charity;')  and had the opportunity to taste a new Anheuser-Busch
product.  It was their Crossroads Wheat beer.  This beer was purported
to be a hefe-weizen.  Remembering Coors' weizen, I was not expecting to
get that "sitting near Marienplatz, sipping on a Schneider Weisse"
feeling;'>.  And while the beer wasn't that good, it was surprising how
much better it was than expected.  First sign that it's not a normal AB
product:  the beer is quite cloudy.  Next sign:  the beer has flavor!!!!
Okay, they get major points for: 1) having a clue about the traditional
beer style and 2) being willing to step outside their regular target
market's taste buds.  The clove character was nice and there was a hint
of ester.  Downsides:  the beer needed a little more sweetness and body
and it needed to have an improved finish because there was almost no
aftertaste.




Bottom line, the Crossroads wheat was closer to style than the Sam Adams
(tm) Cream Stout (tm?) that was also present.

that it is NOT necessary to boil raw wheat for a Wit beer.

I've been brewing all-grain and boiling the wort in a 15 gal Keg on a 
propane cooker in my downstairs bathroom. Actually I've taken it over 
completely and put a sign on the door "West Biochemistry Lab".


It's perfect; window for ventilation, sink and faucet for water and wort 
chiller, shower stall for wash down, and a place to sit down with plenty 
of reading material. 


Regarding any concern about CO, there's plenty of ventilation and if you 
think about it, it's no different than the billions of gas ranges in use 
all over the world today.


Take my advice and take convert your second bathroom into something more 
useful: a Homebrew Biochemistry Lab.

Subject: Steam Beer with no Steam


Hello Everyone,
 
   I recently brewed up a "steam" beer using Wyeast California Lager yeast. 
Everything went normal, primary for 1 week and secondary for 2 weeks then
bottled with 1 cup corn sugar (for a little more steam). It's been in the
bottles for 3 weeks now and there is absolutly no carbonation. Has anyone
experienced this in the past with this yeast? Did I let it set in the
secondary too long? I had another beer using the London ESB that took 2
weeks to carbonate but this batch is really bugging me because it tasted
very good during bottling, but now seems to be developing some off flavors.
Any hints or ideas would be helpful. By the way, it has been at around 65 
degrees during the 3 weeks.
                                        Thanks
                                        Dale Moore

Someone asks :

> like other adjunct grains? 


You could try, but I doubt you'll get good results.  To use 
unmalted adjuncts with extract, you should do a partial mash.
However, to do justice to a very high adjunct beer like a Wit,
you're really not left with much option for a partial mash.  


>    (2) Is there any consensus at all about when to add

I use cilantro, the leaves of the same plant.  Very different 
flavor when fresh, but eventually takes on a very smooth 
coriander flavor.  I boil water, turn off the heat, toss in 
a 'bunch' of cilantro, let it steep for a couple minutes, and
then pour the stuff through a strainer into the secondary.  
Next time I'll try it in the primary.


Someone else asks :

Well, if you think you're time is worth less than $1.25 an hour, 
it's worth it.  Seriously, the only reason I brew all-grain is the
taste and variety.  If I could get similar results for twice the 
price from extract, I'd do it.


> 2) What other grains can be malted from raw grain, and what are the

I've seen malted rye for sale in a mailorder catalog, I think St. Pats.
If you can malt anything, you can probably malt that new "acnient Egyptian"
variety of wheat that's so popular in health food stores these days.
I think it's called "Kef".  


> 3) What kind of relationship is there between raw grain, and dry
>    weight malt extract produced?  I've read 75%, but I'm not sure


Well, it depends on your techniques.  I think my first few extract 
batches were in the 40% range, and I'm probably up in the 60's now,
but I'd have to get out a calculator to figure it out.

Well, if you start malting bizzare grains, and get a liscence to sell 
them, you could probably make a little cash on the side.

First, never throw beer out unti you're positive it's awful and will stay that
way.  Wait a year.  


Second, I've mashed with ridiculous quantities of gypsum in the past, with no
terrible effects.  (One I recall was a bit high in tannins, but that was
probably due to overly hot strike water.)  


Gypsum is not very soluble, so adding extra before boiling is like adding 
lots of tiny stones, they just sit there.  Also, gypsum is a buffer, so 
having more doesn't have great effects on the pH.  I don't know too much about
the other chemical effects.  I wouldn't say you should do that every time you
brew, and you might have a beer that's less good than it otherwise would be,
but you certainly won't have 5 gallons of swill unless there's something
else wrong with it.

I think that x foot-pounds = 1/x pound-feet.  Either that or 
x(fp) = x(pf).  Either way, it's a pretty simple conversion.

I'm doing this from memory (a dangerous thing), but George Fix talks quite
extensively about this barley strain in his excellent monograph on Vienna
lager.  It seems that the particular qualities of Moravian barley were
responsible for the characteristics and quality of Dreher's efforts at lager
brewing in nineteenth century Austria.  He also mentions that there is a
variety of this strain (called Moravian III or something like that) grown in
the US, but that it is controlled and exclusively used by Coors.

Not always. The original poster mentioned flaked wheat which is partialy
gelatianized mechanically.  I have also heard mention that wheat gelatianizes
at around the same temp as barley.  If you are using flaked maze, Oats (quick
or regular) you don't need to pre-cook either.

This is what I have found in cooking times.


  Rice - 30m boiling (helps to do it the night before and let it stand). 
  Corn Meal - 1h boiling (use flaked maze and avoid hassles with this stuff).
  Flaked Red Wheat - none, good yeilds.

Unless you are making belgium styles with wheat.  See the Zymurgy article
on Belgium Styles for one persons take on dealing with wheat.  
The main point is protein rest but not too much to assure cloudyness.

Subject: Lambic Culture Offer


Hi all,


Just was looking through the latest mailing from Sam Adams and
came across an intersting article on brewing Lambic beer.


For those of you that don't know what a Lambic is, it is a
spontainiously(sp?) fermented ale.  That means that the beer is
naturually fermented without the aid of any added yeasts. (Allthough
I'll bet some breweries do add some cultured natural occuring
yeast. )  Anyway, the wort is prepared and then allowed to cool in
large flat cooling trays in a room with the windows open.  This
allows the wild yeasts and bacteria to blow in from the outside and
innoculate the wort.  The only place in the world where the proper
microflora exsist is Belgium, so "Don't try this at home" :-)


The resulting brew is extremly complex, tart, fruity.... generally
speaking quite wonderful and distinctive.  Sometimes fruit is added
to make a special beer.  Examples of these beers are St. Louis Gueze
(I know I spelled that wrong)  Lindemans, Timmermans, and Boon.


Anyway, one of the challenges of the home brewer has been to try
to duplicate this difficult style.  You have to have the right
proportions of wild beasties to create the balance in the flavor.
Well is seems that it has been done by Boston Beer Co, of Sam Adams
fame.  It appears that they received so many complaints from
homebrewers and beer enthusiasts about the "slaughter" of the lambic
appelation with their Cranberry Lambic, that they decieded to make
good and actually create a proper example.  I quote..."With the
cooperation of Lindemans and Boon Brewerie, we were allowed to take dust
samples from the rafters and window sills from the cooling room.  After
several attempts to culture from the samples we managed to isolate
nearly 200 different varities of wild yeast and bacteria.  These
cultures did not however, create a beer as authentic as those
actually brewed in Belgium.  Only when we hit upon the idea that
the proper organizims would be located only in the air, did we
manage to hit the style on the head. By carefully obtaining a sealed
case of Framboise from the brewery and transporting it to our brewey,
then forcing sterilized air though a hole in the box and bubbling it
through a starter wort, we captured the elusive bug.  We then washed
and rinsed each bottle with the wort and allowed it to drain into
the culture.


After isolating the rare bacteria, we discovered it was previously
unknown to brewing science.  Aptly dubbed, TRADEMARKED and PATENTED
as "Pediococcus kochus" after Jim Koch the discoverer.  In keeping with 
last years promotion of the "rare" hop sales to homebrewers, we will be 
providing cultures to interested parties for a nominal fee and written 
agreement that the culture is not to be propigated and distributed."


Advice from the article also stated that is is extremly easy to

Subject: another coldbox




Hello all,


  After reading John Palmers discription of his cold box and others, I
  figured I'd put in my .02.


  Before I had a beer fidge (or room for one) I made a cold box to
  make my so-called lagers.  I took a 4'x8' sheet of plywood and split
  it lengthwise and cut it to make four 2'x3' sheets and two 2'x2'.
  The 2'x3' will make the walls and the 2'x2' will be the top
  and floor.  I insulated the box and used an old oven rack/BBQ rack as a
  shelf.  This shelf is high enough to accomodate the carboy and airlock,
  and low enough to hold the ice.


  To keep this thing cold I scavenged three 1 gal. water bottles from the
  nieghbors trash/recycle bin, and arotated through the frozen bottles each
  day before work.  With 3 bottles, I was able to make sure a completely
  frozen block was used, and as it melted - no mess.


  It worked ok.  People from So. Calif. should now equate the strange heat
  waves occuring in Dec-Feb with my attemps at lagers.


  -on a another note, I was attempting to bottle a lager from my keg using
  the old tubing/stopper on the tap method, which I've used succesfully
  in the past, but this time I forgot the keg presure was 20+lbs
  from conditioning (D'oooh).  As the presure in the bottle equalized, the
  hose detached from the tube.  The beer, sensing the sudden change in presure
  between the inside of the bottle and outside, promptly left the bottle in
  a gyser splatering off the ceiling and back onto the fridge, floor,
  table, and myself.  Well, I know how to fix this, so I clamped the
  hose to the tube and tried again.  This time the hose connected to
  the tap outlet came off, again with very similar effects.  Another hose
  clamp and lowering of the pressure in the keg seemed to do the
  trick.  A rag and a mop and a silent prayer of thanks that I was in the
  garage, and I was ready to bribe my welder.

It all goes back to Henry's Law. At equilibrium, the concentration of a
dissolved gas is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the
liquid. According to the original post, Anheuser-Busch circulates nitrogen
gas through a beer (or was it wort?) spray. Thus they create a condition
where the partial pressure around the beer is almost 100% nitrogen; the DMS
that is in the beer now "sees" a DMS depleted environment in the gas phase
and "corrects" this concentration gradient by diffusing into the gas phase.
Given enough time, all of the DMS can be removed; the rate of this process
is increased by the spray of beer.


Once again, the oxygen content of wort is proportional to the partial
pressure of oxygen; as air contains 20.9% oxygen, the oxygen content of air
saturated wort is about one fifth the oxygen content of oxygen saturated
wort (8.5 vs
40.9 ppm for the case of water).

Subject: ? Brew Caps \ Radical Invert Carboy Idea




I would like to know more about brew caps and how they are used. My guess
is that they are just a spicket that attaches firmly to a carboy, if this 
is true follow my next thaught.


I checked at a glass shop about having a 3/4 hole drilled in the bottom of
a 5 gal. carboy, yes it can be done (carboy may shatter) not unlike my
last one that dropped in the kitchen (empty thank god) what a mess.


What I want to do, is plug the hole with a positive seal boat plug, and set
the carboy on a board with the plug suspended in a cut out. When the
wort is strained and funneled in, pitch the yeast, and install the brew cap.
Then invert the carboy, remove the plug, purge with Co2, and install a blow
off.
When the kraeusen drops, install a rubber stopper and splash the beer to
rinse the bottom, then install an air lock. At this point I should be able to
remove all the sediment and trube through the brew cap during the fermentation.


(This gets better) At bottling time the priming can be added through the
bottom of the carboy and you can bottle through the brew cap.


The beauty of all this is, *** you never have to rack the beer *** 
not even to bottle! Throw the bucket away! No more turkey baster to
check gravity!


Could you maybe even, prime, install the boat plug, and cask condition
in the carboy?


CONSTRUCTIVE criticism please.

Subject: O(2) Henry






dharsh`at`alpha.che.uc.edu (Dr. David C. Harsh) is under the impression that
Henry's Law is not applicable to the problem of solutions of oxygen at atmos-
pheric temperatures and pressures. Nonetheless a value for the Henry's Law
constant for oxygen in water at 25C is published ( Atkins, P.W. "Physical
Chemistry"; Freeman, San Francisco 1978 p214). Furthermore, in The Chemical
Engineer's Handbook (McGraw Hill) we find the statement "For many gases
Henry's Law holds quite well when the partial pressure of the solute
gas is les than one atmosphere." (p14-3 "Gas Absorbtion") This is illustrated
with an example in which the solubility of hydrogen at 200 mmHg in water at
20C is calculated.


The value given in the first reference for oxygen is 3.30E7 mmHg (for hydrogen
it is 5.34E7 i.e. hydrogen is about 2/3 as soluble as oxygen). With
a partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere of 159 mmHg the mole fraction
for dissolved oxygen is 159/5.34E7 = 4.82E-6. As such a dilute solution
is virtually all water the concentration of oxygen per litre is
(4.82E6)(1000/18) = 2.68E-4 mole/litre. At 32 grams per mole this amounts
to 2.68E-4*32 = 8.56E-3 grams/litre i.e 8.56 milligrams per litre. Does
that look familiar?


What this means (and I do sometimes fear we are losing sight of the forrest for
the trees) is that as long as a water solution is in contact with
atmospheric air
its dissolved oxygen content will come to equilibrium at about 8.5 mg/l (for
water and somewhat less for wort as discussed in previous posts).
Bottled oxygen users are also subject to this limitation if the wort surface
is in contact with atmospheric air i.e. oxygen will escape to the air to
equalize the partial pressures of oxygen on both sides of the liquid/air
interface. This can be circumvented by trapping the oxygen
at the surface as it bubbles up (e.g. sealing a unitank) so that the partial
pressure in the gas above the wort is higher than 159 mm but there is little
reason to want to do this as 8.5 mg/l is about as much oxygen as one wants in
his wort anyway.


In summary the advantage of  bottled oxygen is not in that it permits
higher levels of dissolved oxygen to be acheived but in that it is
sterile (pure oxygen is quite toxic to living organisms) so that it does
not need to be filtered and already under pressure so that it does not
need to be pumped. It is quite safe to handle and store, readily obtainable
and not terribly expensive.

Rob Emenecker asks about my advice that a secondary is not necessary

I have heard a few reasons given for using a secondary, and I'm sure
more experienced brewers around here can give more.  First, many people
like to remove the fermenting beer from break material and hop sludge (if
pellets were used) as soon as possible, claiming that prolonged exposure
can lead to off-flavors.  Second, it is well-known that yeast, after it
has consumed available nutrients, will start to autolyze, which adds a
rubbery aroma/flavor to fermenting beer.  So, removing the fermenting beer
from a thick layer of yeast sludge as early as possible is definitely a
good idea.  Third, I know some brewers like to cold condition their beers
for a couple weeks or so in a secondary before bottling.  I believe the
reasons for this are to allow more yeast to settle out and to force 
proteins that cause chill-haze to settle out before bottling -- leading
to a clearer, cleaner tasting beer.


The above is all based on brewing literature and the advice of brewing
friends far more experienced than I.  As for my personal experience, and
the basis for my previous advice, I started brewing extract beers in 
college about five years ago.  At the time, I had a copy of Miller and
a copy of Papazian and was far more impressed with Miller's precision
and scientific attitude than Papazian's rdwhahb advice.  So, I listed to
everything Miller said.  Miller recommended using a secondary, so when I
bought my original brewing kit, I also bought a 5 gallon carboy for doing
secondaries.  I religiously racked all my ales to a secondary.  A little
more than a year ago, I discovered the HBD which reignited my interest in
this hobby and made me start experimenting more.  I decided to go to the
absolute basics to see how different procedures and ingredients affected
my beers in my environment.  So, in order to keep it as simple as possible,
I took a step "backward" and stopped racking to the secondary.  I noticed
no change in the flavor or clarity of my extract beers.  Over the past
year, I have made the change from extract to partial mash and, just under
3 months ago, to all-grain.  Both of these steps made incredible 
improvements in the flavor of my beers.  I also switched from dry yeast
to liquid yeast, which I also believe improved my beers.  My previous
post was intended to suggest that I think neophyte brewers should keep
it simple at first and experiment with how changes affect their beers.
I believe strongly that there are many areas where neophyte brewers can
make changes that affect the flavor of their beers more than going to a
secondary.


As for reasons why I don't notice much difference between using a 
secondary and not using one?  Well, I now do full boils and use a wort
chiller so I rack the wort off of the break material and hop sludge
when moving it to the fermenter, which takes care of the first point 
above.  However, even when I did extract brews and left the fermenting
beer on the break material, I didn't notice any significant off-flavors
I would attribute to this.  This could be just because I was not as
experienced a brewer/beer taster.  YMMV.  As for autolysis, my only
experience with this has been to do an experiment recommended by Miller
where I purposefully left a large amount of yeast in a gallon jar at
room temperature in order to be able to recognize the smell.  It is
definitely not something I would want in my beer!!!  However, I have had
no problems in practice with this, even when I've left my beer in a
primary for 3-4 weeks.  Since I have friends who have had problems with
autolysis in less time, I can say that this is not everyone's experience.
One slight advantage I might have is that I ferment my ales in my
basement which stays right around 60F year round.  Higher temperatures
speed up autolysis.  Again, YMMV.  As for cold conditioning my ales, I'm
really not set up to do that (I can't lager either), but it is something
I would like to experiment with.  I don't think beginning brewers should
bother, however.
 
In summary, I think beginning ale brewers should keep it simple.  Don't
bother with a secondary until you've mastered/improved other techniques,
unless you have problems (like autolysis) that you know would go away
if you racked.


BTW -- did anyone else feel like they were reading the HBD when they
saw the newest Brewing Techniques?  :-)  Good job to those HBD regulars
who had articles in BT this month.  Jim Busch -- if you are looking for
ideas for your column, I, for one, would be very interested in seeing
an article that takes up where your Malt FAQ stops.  A detailed article
on available malts and grains, recommended mashing techniques for each,
etc. would be excellent, IMO.

There's is no real Brewpubs in the Milwaukee Area, but there are some good
microbrews here. Try Lakefront Brewery. They have great beer and they let
you sample lots of it! Good bars are Zur Krone, Von Triers, and the Uptowner.


If you need any more info just write me back.

It is a good strain of barley.  I think that it is still used in 
Pilsner Urquell.
Actaully, Coors uses a different strain of the origina, Moravian-4, I remember.

Personally, I rack to secondary for about a week primarily because it reduces 
the gunk in the bottom of my bottles.  It also gives me a lot more flexibility 
on when to bottle.  


I don't think that it actually IMPROVES most ales (its a different story for 
lagers, of course), however, there _have_ been detrimental effects reported from
letting beer sit on trub for too long.  The effect of trub on the finished beer 
product has been the subject of much debate in the past.  I don't know that it 
was ever answered to anyone's satisfaction.

Subject: Dry-hops In the Copper


I'm not cheap or anything, but...


Is there any good reason why hops used for, say, a 3-day dry-hop
in the secondary could not be usefully employed as bittering hops?
Assume we're looking at an all-Cascade recipe, for example.

Subjeect: Shreier Malt/ Scottish breweries
 
  Recently I began brewing with Shreier 2 row barley fron Sheboygan Wisconsin.
So far I have been very satisfied using it for both my ales and lagers. It
appears to me to be a little plumper than Briess 2 row. Does anyone have thing
good or bad to say about it?
 
   I have been asked by a friend who is getting married in Scotland this June
for a list of breweries/brewpubs to visit. Unfortunatly my Scotish ale book by
Greg Noonan is missing somewhere in the house. Does anyone have any suggestions
or know  of any books/ beer tourists guides etc. available?  Please email me if
any. TIA

Subject: Moravian Barley/Excess Gypsum






Ed Quier          ELQ1`at`PGE.COM asks
>Anybody ever heard of Moravian Barley other than the Coors ad?


Jean De Clerk has. He says "The best varieties of barley are cultivated in
Moravia,
especially in the valley region of Hanna.  In fact, Hanna barleys are consided
the finest malting barleyus in the world." (Vol I p 12)


jds`at`equinox.ShaysNet.COM (john shearer) slipped and dumped 2 Oz of gypsum
into his
(presumably) 5 gallon batch of beer and asks for comments:


This amounts to about 11 grams per gallon or about 2.8 grams per litre. This is
more than can dissolve in water (2.2 grams/l hot or 2.4 g/l cold) so some
would never have gone into solution and would, presumably, have settled out
with other trub material. Nevertheless, 2.4 g/l is a lot of gypsum. This works
out to about 560 ppm calcium (compare 268 ppm for Burton water) and 1340 ppm
sulfate (compare 638 ppm for Burton). Thus this brew will have about twice
the levels of these ions as a Burton Ale. Expect hops bitterness to be extremely
harsh. The only problems I can think of with the calcium are excessive phosphate
precipitation which might lead to fermentation problems and production of
calcium oxalate haze. In for a penny, in for a pound, I'd stick with the
beer unless it won't ferment or a taste test  proves it just too
minerally/harsh.
