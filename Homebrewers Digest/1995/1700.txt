Peter Balstrup <PBalstru`at`VITGCOM1.TELECOM.com.au> asks about "The Beer Machine"


I like them, with qualifications. First the bad news.
I've got two. One works consistently well, the second consistently leaks.
The company was helpful, and sent a new main seal (the canister has two halves 
which contrasts with the "Party Pig" which is one unit with a single *small* 
gasket around the mouth). Even  with the new *large* main seal it leaked. So I 
had to improvise clamps to evenly press the two halves together (I used binder 
clips). (Anyone else in cyberspace with the problem, the company suggests 
putting the gasket in warm water for a few minutes and then laying it flat in
the fridge.)


The good news is the convenience. You can put together an extract recipe in no 
time at all. No bottle washing, the unit itself is easy to clean, and you don't
need to move the batch to a secondary fermenter because of the design.


One observation is the CO2 cartridges can become an expensive habit. Past HBDs
have some suggestions on this. So check the archives. What I'm going to try is 
have a batch brewing and a batch on tap. The batch brewing will supply the CO2
pressure to the batch drinking. I'll replace the cartridge holders with a
fitting and attach a pressure line between the two (seems low risk since the 
inlets are well above the fluid level (can you say "fire hose")).


They only hold 2.5 gallons, and most recipes are for 5 gallons, which is why I 
bought 2. You'll have to adjust recipes otherwise, or end up bottling the 
remainder. Do what I did, and compare bottle finished beer versus plastic. I'd 
like to hear your observations ;-)

Subject: How I lost my zymur-ginity


I write this in hope that other subscribers, more experienced than I, can 
critique my brewing technique.  I'm a beginning brewer, and I want to be 
sure that I'm doing everything "right."


I started with a couple very basic "kit ales."  The routine is essentially 
the same, boil, hop, and cool the wort, hydrate and pitch the yeast, ferment 
a week... but here's where it gets sticky.  I've transferred the wort from 
primary to secondary (carboy) not by "racking" per se, but simply by 
attaching a hose to a stopcock in the primary and slowly draining the beer 
into the carboy.  I then affix an airlock to the top of the carboy, and let 
the ale continue a slow (almost un-noticeable ferment for another week or 
so.  I transfer the ale into a secondary for two reasons: First, I need the 
primary fermenter for racking, priming and bottling.  Second, I'm concerned 
about leaving autolyzed yeast in the brew.  Do I need to rack (siphon) the 
ale into the secondary, or is it okay for me to continue doing as I have 
been, to allow gravity to do the work?


Also, my first two batches (generic amber ale and a more ambitious English 
honey porter) don't have much carbonation, even after nearly two months 
after bottling.  Yes, the caps are tight.  Yes, I primed according to 
directions (3/4 cup corn sugar for the amber ale, 1-1/2 cups amber DME for 
the honey porter).  In fact, it seems that I had more head transferring the 
porter between fermenter and carboy than I ended up with in the bottle!


I'm neither too shy nor proud to admit my mistakes and learn from them once 
I know what they are.  Granted, I'm not doing anything really tough or 
esoteric here...in fact all this talk of oxygenation, tuns and outdoor 
propane mash liquor-cookers is making my head spin...but I count on your 
wise counsel.


Reply to me e-mail, please, unless you feel that your advice would benefit 
other novice brewers.  And we are many....


One day I shall stand proudly with all of you braumeisteren, raise a tankard 
and let the cry "I brewed this myself" escape my lips.  Between sips.

Yep.  Sorry if I didn't make it clear that I brew only ales (and usually
pretty hardy ones at that).  This whole thing started when I was commenting
on a question about brewing an ale and the usefulness of a secondary for
that.


Rob Emenecker, who started the above thread, writes:

Well, actually, after giving that advice, I ended up racking an ale of
mine to a secondary last night as well -- for somewhat the same reason.
It is an ESB, very similar to one I made in January.  The fermentation
started off great (as usual), but for the past week and a half has been
bubbling at a constant rate of about 1 per 30 seconds.  It just won't
slow down or stop!  Since it's been in the primary for two and a half
weeks now, I decided to rack it to secondary, hoping that would rouse the
yeast a bit and it would finish.


I suspect the problem (long, slow, ferment) is due to underpitching (I
pitched a one pint starter rather than my usual one quart) or inadequate
aeration (although I used the same technique as I always do).  Any other 
ideas?  Most of the fermentation was done in my basement at 60F, as are all 
of my beers, but a few days ago I moved it upstairs to my kitchen which is 
a good 5-10 degrees warmer, thinking that would help.  I noticed no change.


Anyway, as part of racking I took a gravity reading, and it was down to
1.009.  The one I made in January went down to 1.008, so I thought it was
pretty close to finished, and this morning I noticed no airlock activity.
Also, it tasted and smelled great (just like the last batch) so I think
it will be fine and I plan to bottle it this week-end.

I agree.  I frequently see lots of names I recognize, many from my local
homebrew club, BURP.  I also like the postings that give the actual
scores -- it gives me an idea of how others are doing in these 
competitions compared to my own beers.

Subject: RE: Covered boils




Hi All,


In HBD#1698, Aidan Heerdegen writes about mashing out in a cooler:


>I have been thinking about mashout (a bit of a problem for a
>single infusion man like myself


>I drew off
>approx 4L of the mash liquor into my kettle and brought it to the

>Can anyone see any problems with this?


  There is a potential problem here. It's related to a somewhat controversial
procedure used during decoction mashing, wherein a thin decoction is used to
achieve mashout. The procedure is to pull a thin decoction (remove mash
liquid, versus a thick decoction where mostly grain is pulled), boil it,
then add back to the main mash to boost the mash temperature to mashout.
This is obviously very similar to what Aidan is doing.
  The danger is that if any grain is pulled along with the liquid,
unconverted starch will be leeched into the wort when the decoction is
boiled. If the mash temperature rises to typical mashout range of 165F-170F
when the decoction is returned to the main mash, the amylase enzymes will
be denatured in a matter of minutes, before the newly liberated starch can be
converted. The result is a starch haze in the finished beer.
  So, I have two bits of advice if this procedure is used. First, make 
absolutely certain that conversion is complete before pulling the mash liquid
and boiling it. The liquid portion is rich in amylase enzymes, once it is
boiled the enzymes are history. Second, make sure that no grain is pulled
along with the mash liquid. It doesn't have to be crystal clear, but I suggest
recirculating for a few minutes until the runoff is free of grain chunks,
then start collecting liquid for the decoction. If you pay attention to those
two points, you'll be fine, I've done a lot of decoction mashes this way.


           Cheers,

Partially tongue in cheek:


6 lbs wheat malt extract (M&F, Northwestern, etc.  6.6 lbs is ok, too :-)
8 HBUs hops (e.g. 2 oz Cascade pellets `at` 4% alpha)
ale yeast


Dissolve the malt extract in 2 gallons of water and bring to a boil.
Add the hops and boil for 45 minutes.  Add to 3 gallons of cold water
in fermenter.  Let cool further if necessary, until no warmer than
80F.  Pitch yeast.


OG should be about 1.043, FG 1.010-1.014.


This will give you an approximation to an "American Wheat Ale."
Relatively low hopping rate, no hop "nose".  Good "lawnmower" beer.


If you want a German Weizen style, then you need to use the right
yeast.  I recommend the YeastLab Weizen (W51) or Wyeast 3068.  The
rest of the recipe won't change much.

Subject: counterflow chillers and straining


I am contemplating constructing a counterflow wort chiller (because I intend
to start doing full volume boils soon) and had several concerns that I felt
the collective intelligence could respond to...


My brews are still partial boils using extracts. A typical boil is 3.5 gallons
to start for 60-75 minutes which yields about 2.5 gallons. I have tried with
limited success straining the hort wort into my carboys (it seems that I
always end up with a layer of gunk settling to the bottom of my carboys within
the first few hours). Excuse my stupidity, but sometimes I miss the definitions
of terms in homebrewing. Is the stuff settling in my carboy considered the
cold break, hot break, what? It has never caused me any problems other than
frustrations from trying to strain it out of the hot or cooled wort? Up to now
I have always used hop pellets which I felt were the bulk of that gunk, is that
assumption correct? I have heard several different methods of straining, i.e.
the copper scrungies, plastic funnels with fitted nylon screens, cheese cloth,
etc. What are some of you extract brewers practical experiences with straining
wort?


 .. anyway back to the wort chiller...


I am cringing at the thought of building myself a wort chiller and having all
of that garbage flowing through it. God what a cleaning mess. Normally I don't
give the garbage any second thoughts because I usually soak any encrusted
equipment in a bleach solution which always loosens it up. Unfortunately I can
not soak copper in bleach for any extended lengths of time). So, before I build
and then trash a nifty home-made counterflow chiller, how can I improve strain-
ing my wort, and what is the best method for sanitizing the chiller (without
boiling it or using bleach)?

Subject: created a monster
Full-Name: Timothy L. Burger


I need some advice.


Last saturday morning I cooked up a bit of wort to use as a starter for a vial
of Yeast Lab's American Ale liquid yeast.  I boiled the wort up, cooled it down
(covered, outside), and pitched the room temp yeast culture to the cooled wort
in a carefully sanitized 20 oz. beer bottle and attached an airlock.  


The instructions mentioned that vigorous activity should not be expected
for 12 to 24 hours.  Plans for Sunday's activities were set in motion. Equipment
was cleaned and ingredients were measured.  This had all of the makings
of one of the most organized brew days of my short (7 batch) brewmaster career.


Sunday morning I checked the starter expecting to see the airlock bubbling
away but was shocked to see nothing. :(  The water level in the lock was even.
So, I waited in hopes of a late night brew session.  No dice. Thirty six hours
after pitching the yeast to the starter wort, still nothing. Tuesday morning -
finally signs of activity, a bit of foam on the surface and some sediment
at the bottom of the bottle but the airlock was silent.  Now it it is Wednesday
and the meager foaming continues.


With all of this said: Is this normal?  Should I pitch this starter to the
drain gods or risk it and pitch this invidious liquid to my next batch?
Have I created a monster?


I realize that this is an elementary and potentially stupid question but the
sucess or failure of my next batch of liquid gold is on the line.


Thanks smart guys,

All Koch bashing aside, I think this is a great beer.  It's a lot like being a

more before I tasted Paulaner Salvatore, which I strongly recommend tasting 
before you finalize your recipe.  There is a recipe in Papazian's new book

information was given to me by another HBDer some time back.  Good Luck!!

We used to get supplies from Mayer's Cider Mill in upstate New York, and

For a Wit extract you might want to try the Brewferm Wit Bier kit, and I
would recommend not using the dry yeast that comes with it. Use the
Wyeast Belgian White yeast or try culturing some yeast from a bottle of

I have made various styles of ales from cultured Chimay Red with great
success. In my opinion, my best beers have been made from the dregs of
Chimay, not with liquid yeasts that I have purchased. In fact, I made an all-
grain Belgian White beer with the yeast from a bottle of Chimay Red and I
think that it was my best homebrew yet.

Not to discourage you from trying, and I am no expert on extract recipes,
but I think that it is going to be fairly difficult to duplicate the splendid
complexity of Chimay Grande Reserve with an extract recipe. If you
succeed, please send me your recipe if you are not too busy accepting your
Homebrewer of the Year award for accomplishing such a feat.

I think that posting Competition results on the HBD is an asset to 
the readers. Often the winners of these competitions are contributors to
the HBD and it lends credibility to their comments and if I have a
question about a certain style, who better to ask than someone who
has won a competition with a beer in that particular style. After all,
they are homebrew competitions and this is the Homebrewers Digest.

Yeah, I should have been more clear.  Unless you brew on a massive scale, or 
are highly impoverished, cost is not, IMO, a good reason to brew full mash 
beers.  Mashing is fun, but at the same time takes big time commitment, and 
can be a big PITA.  Also, when you factor in equipment and so forth, the 
savings aren't real big.  The main reason I brew full mash is the taste and
variety you can't get with extract, the other reason is that it's fun.  The 
main reason I stuck with extracts for two years, and the best reason, IMO, to
stick to extracts for any amount of time, is the time and trouble involved in
mashing.  I think saving $5-20 on a batch of beer is pretty small potatoes.  
I've never brewed with potatoes of any size, but I have brewed with other 
unmalted adjuncts.

It might not be a contamination, it could be that your yeast took a nap on you
and fooled you into bottling before it was fully fermented.

If I'm drinking my beers faster than I'm brewing/bottling, I appreciate being
able to find good commercial beers.  Of course, if he gave free beer in 
exchange for good recipes, well, nobody should complain then.

Certainly if they're big, faceless corporations, but I don't think helping a

Isn't "silently ignored" redundant?


I have followed closely the discussion regarding bubbling O2 in wort to
increase the amount of oxygen for pitched yeast.  What's the benefit to such
an extreme?  Yeast count?  Why not just pitch a HUGE starter?


Charlie mentions in his "Companion" book that too much oxygen is a detriment.
 Does anyone have specific information on this?

This is my second post, so you can't throw me out now, so NYEAH! :-P


I read the HBD daily with my first cup of coffee, word for word.  As a
newbie, I hesitate to give any information due to my inexperience.


I have about a dozen batches done now, and never used any finings except for
two kits which came with irish moss.  I only brew ales and I do not use a
secondary.  I use a carboy as a fermenter.  I travel often, and my ales often
sit in primary up to three weeks.  Every brew has been ------> Crystal
<-------- clear up to now.


I took a stab at making a VERY light honey wheat beer using 3# of wheat DME
(60% wheat, M&F brand, I think) and 2# of honey added at the end of the boil.
 I pitched about 1/2L of british ale yeast starter and fermention went fine.
 The beer began to settle, the top two inches cleared and then that was it!


Ten days later, still no settling.  No bubbles, either.  I wanted to get the
beer off the trub (coming up on three weeks) but did not want to rack without
active fermentation.  So I tried gelatin for the first time...


GREAT STUFF!  I dissolved one small packet  (about 2g, I would guess) of Knox
from the supermarket in warm water and tossed it in.  Dramatic improvement in
12 hours and two days later the carboy is BLACK with very clear beer.  She
goes into mini kegs tonight.

Huh?  My sump is completely submersed at both the beginning
and end of cycle.  In the remote chance that the sump were
exposed to air, just how does a sealed electric motor ignite a
combustible gas?  I think a more probable ignition point would be
a water heater or furnace.  But anyway.
 
Since it appears that we're steering towards the Straits of Momily,
a testimonial is required.  I've been brewing indoors with two 35,000
BTU propane burners for 8 years now.  I haven't been overtaken
by monoxide fumes nor has my house blown up.  When needed I open a
window for ventilation.  Long-term propane tank storage is outdoors.
 
The last time I looked the Bible didnt have anything to say about 
the indoor use of propane.  In other words, when using any highly 
combustible material indoors the liberal application of caution and 
common sense is required.

        This posting is to announce the creation of a UK-oriented Homebrew 
discussion list.


        This list was created after various UK Homebrewers had expressed 
concern that r.c.b and HBD were difficult forums to use when seeking help, 
advice and information on UK-specific aspects of Homebrewing. The number of UK 
Homebrewers that have Internet access is relatively small and it was found that 
it was often difficult to find anybody that could help on UK-specific matters. 
As a result, I have created an Email discussion list that is dedicated to UK 
issues.


        The list is open to all those interested in UK Homebrewing whether they 
are UK residents or not. It is not meant as an area for discussion of general 
Homebrewing issues - r.c.b or HBD are accepted as being the established areas 
for this and should continue to be so.


        To subscribe to the list, send a message to...


                uk-homebrew-request`at`rhbnc.ac.uk


        ...with the word SUBSCRIBE in the message BODY. No subject heading is

I suspect that your brew will be fine and that you probably won't need to
add more yeast.  Many lager brewers let theirs sit for considerably longer
than 2 months.  However, your fermentation temperature makes this brew a
Steam Beer, not a Lager.  I like 'em both, and pay less attention to style
than to my own enjoyment.  Bottle it and savor it after each
around-the-house project!

This is my first post to HBD, but of course, I've been reading and absorbing
the info for sometime.
I use a 10 gallon cylindrical "Gatoraid" cooler fitted with copper tubing and
a ball valve for a mash and lauter tun.  In order to raise the temp to mash
out (ususally 168F), I usually remove about 1-1.5 gallons of water from the
sparge water tank, bring it to a boil and add it to the mash tun to raise the
temp. I then recirculate untill clear about 3-10 minutes. then sparge with
treated 168F water. 
I'm I dilluting the mash too much by this procedure? 
Is the mash out really neccesary?
Is there a better way to achieve mash out with this (picnic cooler) type of
 setup

Subject: Fermentation: All-grain vs. Extract


     I've recently transitioned from extract brewing to all-grain, and now 
     find that I have a couple of questions that I can't find answers for 
     in the standard references.
     
     First, the krausen resulting from fermenting my all-grain beers seems 
     to be larger (i.e., more volume), and longer lasting than extract 
     beers I've made with similar O.G.'s.  I take this to be a positive 
     sign, and due to starting with a wort that is richer in yeast 
     nutrients (FAN, phospolipids, etc), dextrins, head-retaining proteins 
     (whether they are being "used up" or not), and probably more cold trub 
     in the fermenter being lifted to the top by CO2 evolution.  Or it 
     could be my imagination.  Is it typical to have noticibly improved 
     ferments from all-grain worts?
     
     Second, both all-grain batches I've made have developed a sticky, 
     gooey sort of layer on top of the krausen foam after about the third 
     day of fermentation.  This layer has a different color than the 
     original krausen, and literally sits on top of it.  I noticed this 
     with my first all-grain batch, did some reading, and concluded that I 
     had gotten an infection of either Pediococcus or Lactobacillus.  It 
     was painful, but I dumped my first all-grain batch, and then sanitized 
     the bejeezus out of everything that wort, yeast or beer had touched.  
     Now, my second batch has developed the same look, even though I 
     sanitized thoroughly and used a different yeast.  This morning, I 
     skimmed off the goop, noted again that it was sitting on top of 
     regular looking foam, and racked the beer to a secondary from under 
     the remaining foam/goop.  I took a s.g. reading, and it's only at 
     1.010 from an OG of 1.050, so there's work yet to be done.  It did not 
     smell "yeasty" like it had during the most active fermentation, but it 
     didn't smell like cooked vegetables, either.  I tasted the sample 
     after measuring the s.g., and there was no obvious problem, but I 
     don't claim to be a calibrated taster of half-finished fermenting 
     wort.  These indications do not match what I consider to be "normal" 
     based on my extract-brewing experience, but I'm not sure what to make 
     of them.  Is this an infection?  If it is, how did it "overtake" the 
     fermentation after three days?
     
     In either case, I'm not dumping this batch.  It was intended to be a 
     weizen, so if I've gotten a lactic infection, I'll see how it turns 
     out, and tell everyone it's a wit if necessary :) !

Subject: Siphon solution (?)


Howdy all,
 
Dan Pack <danpack`at`grape-ape.che.caltech.edu> and others have been having
trouble with keeping the siphon going while siphoning form the kettle to the
primary.


I have been trying the siphon method to help eliminate trub in the primary and
chill haze from my beers and have not had much luck either.  One batch ago I
made a bitter using M&F DME, 40L crystal malt, Goldings hop plugs as well as
the usual 1 tbs. of irish moss for 15 min.  I whirlpooled and used a hop bag
around my racking cane and was able to get most of the wort before the break
plugged the system up (I have a 20 qt. SS pot and use an immersion chiller). 
I got out my sauce pan and got as much wort as possible without pulling too
much break material into the carboy but I left too much wort behind IMHO :-(. 
The beer was very clear so I was encouraged.  My last batch was a porter using
M&F DME, 60L crystal, roasted and chocolate malts, N. Brewer whole and
Goldings plugs and 1 tbs. irish moss the last 15 min.  This time I whirlpooled
with a block of wood under the corner of the kettle and this time used a
copper scrubby along with the hop sack.  This time I only got half way through
before the whole mess plugged up and I was forced to do the rest of the batch
with the sauce pan and strainer (ala Papazian).  It was bottled this past
weekend so I don't know what the haze status is on this one.  I don't know if
I get more break than the average guy but I can't imagine an EASYMASHER (tm)
type device would work any better.


I was going to make a siphon ring (ala Jeff Frane and Spencer Thomas) but have
decided to wait until I get a 7 or 10 gal SS pot (any good sources out there?)
and go all-grain (soon hopefully) before investing the time and effort in
drilling a zillion holes in the copper 3/8" copper tubing.  I have been
thinking of alternative and thought I'd throw it out for comment/criticism.


Iteration 1: (sorry, no ascii art).


Cut the top and bottom from a large soup can. Cut it length wise and open it
up to a half circle.  Bend the ends to the same radius as the pot and drill a
bunch of 1/16" holes in to facilitate seepage.  Whirlpool as before
with a block of wood under the side and put this in on the high side, (already
sanitized) just before racking and lower the pot to rack.  This would make a
pocket for the racking cane and copper scrubby and hopefully keep the majority
of break material out and therefore not clog up the cane. 


Iteration 2:


If it works, find some SS screen or perforated SS sheet metal and use it
instead of the can. 


** Local Interest Warning **


I'd like to hear from some of the Ann Arbor brewers to find out where they get
their supplies.  I've tried mailing Spencer but my mailer won't accept "."'s
in the name.  My folks and in-laws live there so am in there quite often and
am always looking for good sources of brewing materials (I already know about
Merchant of Vino `at` the Plymouth mall).

     Techniques_ (Frozen Wort), but has only managed to reach their 
     answering machine.
     
     Could those of you who have attempted this style provide any 
     information on sources for bitter (or Curacao) orange peel, or use of 
     alternates (I've heard use of tangerine peel mentioned)?  Any sources 
     local to Northern VA/MD/DC would be most helpful.
     
     Private e-mail would be fine, or post to the digest if you feel that 
     this is of sufficient interest.  I'll post a summary if response 
     warrants.
     
     TIA,

Subject: Indoor cookers & broken e-mail




A few quick things:


There has been much bandwidth of late about OUTDOOR propane cookers and the
like.  My question is, is there any INDOOR cookers that are available.  I
live in an apartment, and finding space outside to do full boils is just
not feasible.  I don't think that my gas range in the kitchen is quite up
to the job.  If anyone has any info about this, e-mail me, or post it in
the digest if you think that there is enough interest.  Thanks in advance!


Thanks for everyone's patience with the Gott digest, as well.  I hope that
everyone who requested a copy did indeed get it.  My set-up is just about
ready now.  As soon as I can figure out how to do full boils, I'll be ready
to take a stab at all-grain.


Apologies to everyone else but if L. Claypool is reading this, could you
please send me a new e-mail address?  I've tried to send you the Gott
digest to the address you sent me (the citynet.net address I believe) and
they all come back.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
