Why not try adding different spices to alter the taste?  This has been done
by 
brewers for a long time.  Even if it doesn't help the taste of beer (which it
might), it could give you some insight into 'specility' herb beers.   Just an
idea.

Whew.  I haven't seen Felinfoel here in Seattle for a couple of years.  I
think 
they were bought out by Thames Brewing. (My reason for saying this is that
Thames started putting out Welsh ale around the time Felinfoel disapppeared
from the shelves.  The packaging is also similiar.)  Before that (3-4 years
ago? 
They were forced to rename there beers because of copyrights, I believe. (ie
Double Dragon became Welsh Bitter or Ale), sorry It's been a while.  I have
never seen it in cans.  You might be able to get the address from Michael 
Jackson's Pocket Guide.  Good Hunting.  Felinfoel made a good product.

I would check the SG and taste the sample.  If the SG is what you were

post
before that it can be a good idea to use active yeast/priming mix with

Have you used liquid yeasts before?  Did these fermentations use dry or
liquid yeast?  The amount of yeast in the Wyeast pack is much less than
the 7 grams you get in a dry yeast packet.  (The fraction that is
viable is probably higher in the liquid yeast.)  For best results, it's
always advisable to use a starter.  This is especially true for lagers.


>2)  If I wanted to force them to ferment some more, could I rack to a

Yes you could, but the reasons why the fermenation stopped might determine
whether it will restart.  If the yeast were shocked, new yeast could help.
If the yeast ran out of fermentable sugars, it not likely additional yeast
would help.  If you're using a liquid yeast and you pitch a healthy starter,
this shouldn't be a problem.


>3) If I do encounter a stuck fermentation with a Wyeast, what would happen if

Most likely.


>4)  Lastly, I'm really considering trying a secondary.  Won't I run the risk

Not if you're careful to not to splash the beer.  If you make sure that the
end of the racking cane in the secondary is below the level of the level
of the beer, it won't splash.  Yes there will be air (and oxygen) in the
head space.  But, outgassing of carbon dioxide from the beer and additional
fermentation in the secondary will displace the air.

I always get layer of grey-brown scum on top of the foam with all-grain 
batches. I usually skim it off. The beer is always OK. I thought it was 
either yeast or gunk from the mash collecting on the surface. Taste the 
beer and if it's OK don't worry. Don't junk it.

I use both Irish Moss during the boil and gelatin when it goes into the 
barrel (after the ferment). Gelatin is brilliant: it's simple, clears the 
beer quickly and has a long shelf life. I don't think it will be much use 
any time before fermenting. It's normally used in the barrel, like finings. 
The books say it won't re-clear if it's disturbed, unlike finings. I have 
an irrational dislike of finings though. I don't like the idea of fish goop 
floating about in my beer. Though why animal hoof should be any better beats 
me.

Hi All!
Below are responses on Liquid Sevin and other Hops' insecticides.    BTW, I
tried the beetle traps last year, and they caught a lot of Japanese
Beetles, but I'm not sure if the traps did more good than bad.  I've heard
that the traps will attract more bugs than you would normally get.
   I've also heard of making a Tobacco-based tea that can be safely sprayed on
plants.  You make it like a sun tea using a brick of chewing tobacco, then
store the tea.  To spray you use only a few teaspoons (?) of the tobacco
tea in a gallon of water and spray on the plants.  You are also supposed to
add a small amount of liquid detergent (a drop or two) to help with the
wetting properties.  I'm not sure about all of the procedures though.

    The problem with pesticides is that you must make sure
to get both sides of the leaves.  As long as you observe the label
instructions you won't die from them and you probably won't murder any beer.
 Try planting some coriander around the plants to encourage the "good" bugs
which eat the aphids.  Also incredible amounts of water.

From: Phil (PGILLMAN`at`POMONA.EDU)
    You might also want to try rotennone(sp?) as it does a good job on the
beetles, but is rendered harmless by exposure to light in a day or two-
ie- you can put it on right up to the end- 
it works great on raspberries, and rinses of easily as well

From: Glenn (au075`at`freenet.buffalo.edu)
    Using liquid sevin is not a good idea for hops.  Fruits 
treated with liquid sevin have to be washed before they can be 
eaten.  Washing hops would be disastrous.  My wife is an avid
gardener so I enlisted her for help.
 1. Try placing Japanese beetle traps in your yard.  The traps will
attract beetles so you don't want them real close to your hops.  
2. Take 3-4 heads of garlic and crush with mallet etc. Place in a 
bucket of water (1gal).  Allow to sit 2-3 weeks, stirring 
occasionally.  Strain.  Use 1 part garlic extract to 2 parts water.
Spray on your hop plant.  Reapply after every heavy rain.  This 
is good for aphids, cutworms and many other insects - possibly
japanese beetles.
3.  Use diazinon or oftanol on your lawn in the spring AND fall.
Japanese beetles live in your lawn as grubs.  The best way to keep
them off your hops is to kill them when they are still grubs.  This
will also kill some other grubs that will eventually eat your hops.
Your local garden/home center should be able to help you.

    As well as a homebrewer, I am also an organic gardener.   I only use
insecticides that are safe for humans and degrade quickly in the environment. 
Liquid Sevin is very toxic compared to other insecticides.  When I need to
treat my vegetables for any type of beetles I use a product called Rotenone. 
It is extracted from plant roots and does a great job of killing off beetles. 
I use it in the powder form and dust the plants as needed every two weeks.  It
degrades when exposed to sunlight and is much less toxic than Sevin.  I'm sure
that you wouldn't want any insecticide residue in your homebrew.
   If you are having problems with catapillars (larvae) eating leaves of the
vegetables (or hops) you can use a product that the company I work for (Abbott
Labs) manufactures called DiPel.  It is a bacterium commonly found in large
numbers in the soil and is supplied in a powder form.  It is sprayed on the
plants in a suspension.  When the catapillars eat the treated leaves they
ingest the bacterium, which grows in their gut and creates a toxin that kills
the catapillar.  Works very well and is very safe.  
   You can usually find either of these products in a good garden supply store
but probably not K-Mart, Wal-Mart etc. Pat Humphrey, Microbiologist and

i have no place to grow hops vertically, as i understand they are supposed
to be. only one of three hop varieties i planted yesterday survived through
the season. i created a make-shift trellis along the back of my garden,
which is bordered by a privacy fence. i ran wire the length of the garden,
about 1 foot away from the fence, at a height of about four or five feet. i
then ran wires from the base of the plant to the horizontal wire at several
locations. the drawback to this method is that the hops do not run naturally
in a horizontal direction, and have to be positioned onto the wires to keep
them as spread out as possible. i'm sure the yield suffers since the vines
end up growing on top of one another, but the plants are otherwise quite
healthy.

Subject: Propane/HBD usage




There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding the indoor vs. outdoor
usage of propane, and several people have indicated that they've used 35,000
BTU propane burners indoors with only a window for ventilation.  I think it's
important to point out that there are two classes of propane burners commonly
used for homebrewing:  the above mentioned 35,000 BTU burners and the 170,000
to 200,000 "rocket engine" burners.  While it may be possible to get away with
using the smaller burners indoors, I'd STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST USING THE
BIG BURNERS INSIDE!!!


In another aspect of my life, I frequently encounter marine installations of
propane tanks for use in cooking onboard.  These installations always have
the propane tank located with a locker that is vented in such a way that, if
the propane tank were to leak it would vent overboard and not down into the
sleeping compartment below.  There are always propane sniffers mounted below
to sound an alarm if significant propane does make its way into the cabin.


In this area of the country (New England) it's not uncommon to use propane
for cooking, if there doesn't happen to be natural gas in the street.  Once
again, the propane tanks are located OUTSIDE the house and sniffers are mounted
in the basement to detect propane inside the house.  In short, if you want to
use propane indoors, go ahead, but use large applications of common sense and
you're probably much better off leaving the tank outside, even if the burner
is indoors.  Personally I wouldn't do it - I have a very healthy respect for
propane - but it's your house.


On another note, I wonder how many of the multiple posters in Spencer's poll
were really participants in the bouncing mail/vacation program fiasco last
summer? :-) :-)

Subject: Bock question


To the collective wisdom (?) of the HBD:


I have a bock (actually, I was trying to make a Dobbelbock, but back to the
story).  The recipe was something like:


3.3# M&F Amber
6# light DME (Not Laaglander - never again!)
0.5# Crystal Malt
0.5# Chocolate Malt
2 oz. Hallertaur (boil)
1 oz. Tettanger (finish)
2 packs Superior lagar yeast (dry - rehydrated)


S.G. was 1.078...about right for a dobbel.  It fermented very well for 6 days
in the primary; racked to the secondary where it's been for almost 3 weeks.
Airlock activity was down to one bubble every 4 minutes or so; I figured it
was time to bottle.  I checked the S.G.-> 1.040!!!!!  I knew I would end with
a beer with a slighly high final gravity, but 1.040 seems a little extreme.
It tastes wonderful, and that is my dilemma:  I am kinda afraid to bottle
anything that has a S.G. of 1.040 - there is some serious residual
sugars/dextrins in there, and I don't want bottle grenades!  But I don't want
to repitch with more yeast and screw up the flavor.
Any suggestions???
FWIW, I fermented this beer at room temp. (about 65F in my house)...It is a
lager, but when I put it downstairs in my basement (50F) fermentation stopped
completely.  Superior is a dry lagar yeast imported from Australia.  I have
never used it before, and don't know what to expect from it.  I have primarily
switched over to Wyeast liquid yeasts, but I wanted to brew this Bock and
didn't have a smack pack ready to go....Any advice, encouragement would be
appreciated... private email preferred...TIA

I've got a pretty basic question. I've got a beer that is still

gelatin or some such stuff to clear it up. Question is,
if I add the stuff to the secondary and it clears up, do I need

Question for Brewcap users? Is the blow off more efficient blowing "down"
instead of "up" into the tube making the Brewcap blow off better when
used with a 6.5gal carboy.

Yet another opinion on using gas indoors:


My first gas cooker was a natural gas burner that I pulled out of an old 
water heater.  Since this burner used natural gas instead of propane, it is 
much safer to use indoors (with proper ventillation of course).  Anyone can 
easily make one by simply pulling the burner ring out of a natural gas water 
heater, and connecting a valve and some line to your current natural gas 
line.  I personally used an old tire rim for my "base" and installed the 
burner ring in the middle.  Eventually I bought a new King Kooker and moved 
everything to the back porch.  All I had to do was replace the orafice on my 
natural gas burner with one for propane, and I had a second burner ready to 
go.


I see alot of people asking "I will be in so and so, where should I go"  Is 
there not a FAQ somewhere with this info?  If not, I will compile one if 
people will help by submitting information and comments in a standardized 
format.  This could get VERY large and time intensive, so if it is not 
standardized, it will take too much time and I may let it slide.  Private 
E-Mail ideas for a format, or post the location of a current FAQ.  I will 
let everyone know what I come up with.

On another subject...


I don't have a grain mill and for the small amount of grain required in a 
partial/extract brew, I just use a wood rolling pin (not a good idea 
because I have made ALOT of dents in the pin and my wife is getting upset).  
Has anyone has tried using a food processer ala. Cuisunart (sp.?) to crack 
the grains?  I realize that running the machine too long will grind the 
grain into flour and I'll end up making bread from them. 


I am a microbiologist and occasionally I use a good old Waring blender 
(most people use them to make foo foo drinks) at work when I have to 
prepare some growth media.  Quaker Oats grinds up into a fine powder in no 
time at all!

Ahh!  Never do that.  Even if you KNOW something's infected, it might turn 
out nice.  (It's rare, but...)  Even with a constant shortage of empty vessels
for new batches, I have a rule of thumb whereby I don't dump ANYTHING until 
I've given it three months.  If I taste an improvement, I'll give it another 
three months, until it's obvious it's going to be crap, or it gets good enough
to drink.


Anyway, even if that stuff up there IS some kind of bad bug, it's high atop 
your krausen, and, I think, safely away from your beer.  I've made about ten
all-grain batches, all have had that "stuff" up there, and they've all turned
out drinkable, most of them darned good, if I don't say so myself.

Subject: Mashing dark grain?


My brewing buddy and I just made an American Brown Ale which is basically a
Pete's Wicked Ale clone. I just transfered it to the secondary and it tastes
very good, but it is on the dark side.


I believe the darker color is because we mashed the chocolate malt with
the rest of the grains. A couple months back there was a good thread
where the collective wisdom basically said to hold off on adding the
dark grains to the mash. Instead add them at mash out. If I remember
correctly dark grains were defined as chocolate, black patent and
roasted barley. Does anyone recall this thread? I should have paid
more attention.


How do the rest of you all grainers use these grains? The system in
question here consists of a 15 gal keg with the top loped off, a high
btu propane burner (no, it is not in the basement by the sump pump ;-))
and a 15 gal cooler for the grain bed.


BTW, we made this brew for the upcoming Southern California Homebrewers
Festival. If any of you are going to be there then please stop by the
COVBS (Crown of the Valley Brewing Society) table/area and try a mug.

Please pardon if you see this message multiple times. It's time-

A number of people have been dropping off their National Homebrew
Competition entries for the Chicago region at Millrose Brewery in person.
This is good, as it saves the risks of shipping.


BUT your entry **MUST** still be packaged. Place it in a box, with the
check and forms inside the box. A simple, single-wall box will do, since
it doesn't have to survive UPS. Or, put it all in a six-pack carrier and
place the six-pack inside a paper sack, with the checks and paperwork,
and staple the sack shut. Whatever you do, it must be enclosed and
sealed, so that the checks and paperwork do not stray. And it should have
"NHC" written on it. Go to the Country Store side of the building to drop
of your entry, not to the brewery or restaurant. (Directions: I-90 at
Barrington Road; north side of the highway.)


Millrose has been getting a number of people walking in with loose
bottles and loose checks, and things are getting confusing. Please do NOT
walk in with loose bottles. Your entry might not make it, or it might get
crossed up with somebody else's entry.

Subject: Stuck or not?


First of all, thanks for all the great responses about my last post - "a few
bothersome questions".  It is great to have a digest where a beginner can ask
"stupid" questions without being flamed to an ash.


Now, another set of questions.


I'm fermenting an India Pale Ale, specifically CP's "Palillalia IPA" from
TNCJOHB.  It used 7lbs DME, a little crystal malt, and a little toasted
malted barley.  Instead of using CP's method of steeping the grains while the
brewing water heated to a boil, I took the advice of the local homebrew store
and did a sort-of-decoction.  I took a quart of water, added the specialty
grains, heated to near boiling, then strained off the liquid, added hot water
(170F), strained, and so forth, until I collected about 1.5 gallons.


Anyway, the OG was 1.057, CP said it should be about 1.052, so I felt like I
had done pretty well.  This time, I even shook the heck out of the carboy
before pitching, cause I was worried about oxygen for the yeast. I pitched a
Wyeast 1028, which I later found out might have been a poor choice for this
style.  Fermentation started in about 12 hours and was vigorous, but not
enough to "blow off" any krausen.  This bothered me a little, but the
fermentation went on for about 2 days like this, which has been my experience
thus far.  Now, it has pretty much stopped. 


Yesterday, I racked to a secondary, after one week, and took an SG.  It was
1.030!!  Ack!  This is way too high!  It should get down to around 1.012!  It
tasted very sweet and the hops were virtually drowned out by sweetness.


My questions are:  
*  Did I do something wrong and do I have a stuck fermentation?  *  Does it
just take a long time to ferment a high-gravity beer?
*  Did the "decoction" make too much unfermentable stuff?
*  If it is stuck, what would I do to fix it??


Thanks for listening.  I apologize for the lengthy post!

Hi All!  


Lenny asks about using Coleman coolers which are more available in Israel
than Gott.  I use a Coleman PolyLite 28 (28 quart capacity) for my 5 gal
batches and it seems to hold the temp just fine.  Found it at the Recycling
Center for $1.  Cut a hole bigger than your faucet housing through the outer
shell and insulation.  Then mount the faucet to the inner shell and away you
go.


Re: using syringes for "beer engines".  Had to try this, not because my beers
lack head but because of my inability to resist a gadget that costs less than
$2.  First purchased a children's "oral liquid dispenser" from the pharmacy
for $1.89. Works great!  Then I found a small all plastic disposable syringe
 - the "Monoject 412" -  at the local vet supply house.  It has a curved tip,
is used to feed medicine to animals and cost less than $1.  We're talking
major play value here!  My wife thinks I'm nuts, of course.  But it really
perks up a half finished beer and the bubbles are very fine and long lasting.
 Just don't try squirting more than about 2ml of beer back into the glass! 


Sure it's silly and I'll probably tire of it in a week, but not before I take
it to the next brewclub meeting! 


Happy squirting,

Subject: yeast


a couple of months ago i made a very nice porter; except for the fact that
it is poorly carbonated -  if poured down the middle there is a small head
other than that nothing.  given it was about my fourth grain brew and the
third time i've used liquid yeast(wyeast 1028) i figured it was something i
did.  so i decided to brew a similar batch(as the first batch was nearing
depletion anyway) without a protein rest and see if it carbonated better.
i used 3/4 cups corn sugar to prime as i have done with sucess it the past.
well i tried one of the new brews the other night and it is poorly
carbonated after 10 days in the bottle.  is this common with wyeast 1028? -
the fermentaion went perfectly both times - or is it just me?


on a similar note, i recently had the chance to taste the differnce that
yeast can make.  i tried a beer that was brewed as 10 gallons then racked
to two five gallon fermenters, pitched with different liquid yeast,
fermented side by side, then bottled. the only difference being the yeast.
tasting these two side by side convinced me that yeast does much more than
turn sugar into CO2 and alcohol.  if your set up to brew 10 gallon batches
i highly recomend this experiment(thanks to dan sullivan for the excellent
beer/experiment).  Mark

I doubt that it is real TSP, i.e. trisodium phosphate. In areas where 
phosphates are banned, there are TSP substitutes that always leave such 
deposits as far as I can tell. An acid wash is the only thing that works, 
and it must be followed by a slightly acid rinse for better results if 
your water is hard.

Hello, fellow brewers/sters! No specifics, just mayhem...


>>> Beer engine dyno-lab


I played around with various 'versions' of beer engine work-alikes seen here
and in other publications. They definitely mellow the flavor of the subject
beer, provide a dense, fine head; and reduce the carbonation. Which brings me
to a theory: The reduction of carbonation is, by definition, a reduction of
carbonic acid in the beer. Carbonic acid, or suspended CO2 is, one of the
sources of bitterness in the beer. My supposition is that the effect the beer
engine has on the beer's flavor profile is due more to the evolution of CO2
than the dissolution of raw air. Any thoughts?


On the downside, the reduced bitterness exposed a previously unperceived
phenolic finish to what I had classified as my best nut-brown ale yet :-(

I don't know what algorythm you (all encompassing you) use to count the

identified in the 'From' column though there IDs remained unchanged; and
those, like myself, who post from any one of four different internet accounts.
Therefor, any 'accounting' based on automatic, no intervention sort methods
are fated to yeild false results. Now, if Algis broke each of his replies into
separate letters, he'd probably be the most prolific (as well as informative,
IMHO - even with the Garetz 'vendetta' flaw ;-)) poster in all of

aligning the board with Andrew Patrick's HomeBrew U BBS Network, but need some
input from users of his boards, and potential users for this one. What do
current users of HBU BBS think of it? What do potential users want to see
here? I aim to serve. Private e-mail on this one (to pbabcock`at`oeonline.com
please) will count as a vote...

I use a rectangular Coleman "Steel Belted" cooler, with a slotted
copper tubing array at the bottom. It handles heat just fine. 
What it lacks in comparison to the cylindrical Gott is deapth
of the grain bed. Supposedly, you get a better extraction from
the narrower, deeper, cylindrical design. I won't dispute
this, but I've always been satisfied with the Coleman.
