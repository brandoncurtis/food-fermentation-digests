Beer for the most part does not have any fat content; the primary factor
in weight gain. However, as the body metabolizes/processes alcohol most of
the B vitamins in the body are spent. These vitamins are critical for other
processes, among which is conversion of stored fat/carbo's for fuel. My 
personal experience was that shortly after homebrewing my weight slowly
increased an additional 20 lbs (over only a 1-1/2 year period). I have
since dropped this weight, but at a price. Yes... no more cheesesteaks,
pizzas, subs, etc. when I am imbibbing in brew. Also, go to most microbrew
festivals and what type of food is available? You got it... German sausages
and the like (A number 1 source of FAT!!!). If you are going to imbibe 
excessively stock up on a good B-complex vitamin and fight the urge for
junk food. If this doesn't fly, well then, accept the weight gain and go
on with life! ;)

Actually, a mutch greater contributer of lead was the lead pipes used to move 
the wines from the fermenters to the aging casks, and perhaps the fermenters 
themselves (the stuff was used everywhere).  Given the volume of port consumed 
during the period, often a bottle apiece after dinner(!), the stuff didn't hang 
around in the lead crystal for long.  I assume the problem was greater for 
wines than beers due to the higher acidity of the must vs. wort.

Subject: RIMS programming, wooden casks, AB Bock


In HBD 1701, Chuck Wettergreen mentioned the BASIC stamp as a possible 
RIMS controller. A few points of correction/amplification: The BASIC stamp
is not a Radio Shack product. It is made by Parallax, Inc. in two 
versions for $29-59 depending on options. The software development kit is 
$99, but you can download the manuals (Adobe Acrobat format), the 
development software and sample code from their ftp site and web page 
(http://parallaxinc.com or ftp to parallaxinc.com). The only thing in the $99
SDK that you would need to make is a cable that would cost about $10 in 
parts. From what I can see, it would be a good place to start for a RIMS 
controller. Digi-Key also distributes the BASIC Stamps. Check magazines 
such as Circuit Cellar Ink and Midnight Engineering for ads from 
Parallax. (I have no financial interest in them, BTW).


Also in HBD 1701, Kirk Fleming posted interesting info on wooden casks 
that may soon be available in the US for beer use. I have one question: 
it was noted by the seller of the casks that they add an oak flavor to 
the beer, implying that the casks are not lined. I seem to remember from 
either the Brewing Techniques series on IPA or the AHA's Pale Ale book 
that the casks used in the UK are coated with a special type of pitch. 
Anyone know if that is true? Also, the statement that American Oak 
leaches more tannins into the contents is why most wineries in the US use 
imported (French?) oak for fermenting.


Finally, our friends at Bud are now producing a bock called "Ziegenbock" 
here at the Houston brewery. Initial distribution is in Texas only (to 
compete with Shiner, no doubt) and I picked up a six pack for $4.979 or 
so. It is OK - big head that really disappears fast, some malt/hops in 
the nose, I'd put it a half-step below Shiner, several below SA Double 
Bock and far below any German import I've had. The label approaches 
claiming to be Reinheitsgebot (sp?) compliant, but never states so. I 
noted in a post to CIS that if they wanted to, the majors could really 
produce some great specialty lagers without much competition, since most 
micros concentrate on ales (for valid economic reasons).

I understand that putting beer into clear bottles is asking for problems such
as light-struck off flavors or skunking.  Recently, a friend gave me a couple
of cases of those clear glass Corona bar bottles and I'm not wanting to let
them go if I don't need to.  I'm wondering about using them to bottle some
still mead.  Are there potential problems if the clear bottles are used for
mead instead of beer?

Howdy from Zion!


Long time, no speak, but here we go...
To Andy Ross:  I have been happiest with the characteristics of the Wheat
yeast from William's catalog.  To me, it produces the nicest clove, banana
like flavors that I enjoy in a Wheat.  It finishes very clean and light.


On dry-hop flavor:  It seems obvious to me that you cannot add JUST hop
aroma via dry-hopping.  Doesn't much of our flavor/taste perception come
via our sense of smell?  If you smell it while you drink it, THEN YOU TASTE
IT!  Is it just me?


Question: I have gotten my doppelbock recipe just about where I like it, but
I have had trouble getting a yeast to eat my 1.082 OG wort down to an
acceptable level.  The best performance I obtained was 1.022 FG.  This is
too sweet tasting! I won't say what yeasts I've used, but I have used a
one liter starter and fermented until all activity stopped 2 months later.
I would appreciate good doppelbock yeast advice, and any help concerning
larger starters, yeast nutrients, temperature changes, etc.  Would higher
hop rates help?  I use the generic Papazian doppelbock IBU recommendations.
Lagering takes too long to make uninformed experimentation acceptable.


TIA to the beertherhood!

Subject: Extract Recipe


Someone recently asked for straight extract recipes, here is one I brewed a
few months ago that everyone seems to like.


1 can (3.3 lbs) John Bull Hopped Amber Malt
1 can (3.3 lbs) John Bull Amber Malt, unhopped
40 ml Burton Ale liquid yeast
40 min boil
1.045 sp. gr.


Racked to secondary fermentor after 7 days, 1.02 sp. gr.
Bottled after 2 weeks in secondary and no activity using 1 1/4 cup dry amber
malt for priming, 1.02 sp. gr.


I do not remember if the yeast was Yeast Labs or Wyeast, I got it from
Williams Brewing I think. Also, I do not necessarily believe my SG's.
After bottling I did get what seems to be the common "ring around the neck"
since I used DME for priming.
This beer was fine as is but if I do it again I will try to get some more
body in it, maybe add some crystal malt or some wheat DME.


Happy Brewing!

Subject: Dry hopping




David Shea wrote about some problems in dryhopping SNPA and a clone of
Redhook ESB.


In my clone of Redhook, which I call Trolleyman ESB, I typically use 1
oz. Tettnang pellets for a five minute finish and 0.75 oz. Tettnang
pellets as a dry hop in the secondary for 21 days.  My most recent
purchases of Tettnang hops have come in at 5.6% alpha acid.


I suspect the overly strong hop note comes from using 1.0 oz of Tettnang
pellets as a dry hop.  I would suggest cranking down the dry hop weight
to 0.75 oz of Tettnang pellets.  I used to use 1.0 oz Tettnang whole
hops as a dry hop, but discovered that I got a more *rounded* hop aroma
by using the pellets.  If you wished to use whole hops in the dry hop,
then I would try 1.0 oz.


Best of luck in future batches.

I was a student at CSU Chico and working for the company that sold SN all of 
their computer equipment when they moved from their original location to the 
building they now occupy (Around 1989), and as I recall, the new brewery was 
delayed by a few months because they were having problems duplicating the 
water used in the original building.  So there is definitely something 
special about the water.  If anyone wants to analyze it, next time I go to 
Chico (about twice a year, nothing planned right now), I will go the site of 
the original brewery and get a sample, providing whoever is now in the 
building will let me in!

Fellow brewers,


    Having lately fallen in love with Belgian Ales, and having read bad things
about Wyeast's offerings in that category, I have "cultured" the fluff from
two bottles of Chimay Grand Reserve and one of Corsendonk <sp?>.  In all three
cases I flamed out the mouth of the original bottle and poured the leavings
into a twelve ounce bottle with eight ounces of aerated starter. In all three
cases as well I wound up with a thick layer of stuff that looks like the
sediment which I poured in, but I never saw any gas make it through the 
bubbler.  Quite unlike my 1056 starters...  Would someone with more experience
in this magic tell me if this is normal?

Subject:  Source of seed barley/hop plants


k-jones`at`ee.utah.edu (Kelly Jones) sought a source of barley seed.  I do a
lot of gardening and use barley straw (bought as bales) as a mulch.  I find
that I have considerable volunteers arising from the seed remaining on the
straw.  I tend to leave it to grow and use it as a source for the next
layer of mulch.


If you try this,try shaking the grain out before placing on the ground.
You should also try add some fertiliser (eg blood and bone, manure etc) and
compost under the straw, as this will increase grain cropping and
accelerate the breakdown of the straw. The soil is greatly improved after a
couple of years of repeating this process. The mulch will reduce weed
competition, but keep it moist whilst you are trying to germinate the
seeds.


Following recent discussions on malting grain, I will try a small sample
this year to see how it works.

Subject: Weird Irish Moss Story


I thought that this story was appropriate to share with the digest --


I had planned to make some oatmeal stout on Tuesday, so Monday night
(this is Wednesday today) I re-hydrated 2 tsp in about 1 cup of water.
By this evening it was fermenting!  Yes, beleive it or not the Irish
Moss/water mixture was bubbling like a yeast starter of similar size,
and it had a funky looking pellicle on top.


So, I guess the moral of this story is -- be careful where you store
your Irish moss...  Or, I guess this could actually help lambic
brewers...  Just put the irish moss in you *cooled* wort!


I have no idea what was fermenting in there...

His questions were:

Yup.


>If so what recommendations can you make.


Use 88% lactic available at the Homebrew shop.  Cheaper, more readily 
available and it is definitely food grade.  I usually have to use 
less than 1/4 tsp per 10 gallons of water with this water supply.  
YMMV.  A friend used plain old Vinegar but I just can't bring myself 
to do it.  I don't see why it wouldn't work though.


> Can anybody suggest why this wouldn't be a good idea?


Just safety considerations.  I don't know at what concentrations USP 
Hydrochloric comes but the Lactic is safe right out of the bottle 
(okay, usual precautions apply but hey, it's pretty safe).

This is untrue. All that splitting will accomplish is to separate out the

Subsequent operations with planes and scrappers will open up at least as 
many pores as sawing.


If the goal is to remove tannin and acetic acid, boil the split-out 
blanks in water before working them down into staves.  This will remove a 
substantial fraction of water soluble material; the blanks which remain 
in plane after this treatment will be very dimensionally stable.  Any 
which twist on drying join the others in the firewood pile.


Any differences in taste are a function of minerals in the dirt which the 
oak grows upon.

Subject:       Re: American vs. French Oak for Casks


Matt Wyss gave us some info ge got on American Oak wine casks:


Apparently the tour guide said that these were split not sawn and 
henc leached less?  Makes sense I guess.


There was a blurb on PBS last weekend on "This Old House" where Norm 
and Steve went to a Cooper's (Cooperage?) in Napa Valley.  This was a 
French family (can't remember the name) who had been doing it for 
generations.


Norm asked about the French vs American Oak aspect.  He was told that 
they used to import the wood but a combination of cost effectiveness 
and a desire to be different forced American Coopers to the American 
White Oak.  It was the Coopers opinion that American Winemakers want 
an American Wine to have an "American" character since they are 
established well enough on the market to be able to influence the 
style rather than copy it.


And splitting vs. sawing..... these were sawn and the Cooper said 
nothing about that but all barrels are charred on the inside, 
"toasting" I belive they call it.  He indicated that how this is done 
greatly affects the finished product.  Maybe that seals the pores 
somewhat.  I can tell you that White Oak is not near as porous as 
many woods I can think of... I don't se how it would be a problem but 
I'm not a Cooper.

Subject: Old YeastLab yeast?, Weizen yeast, Buckwheat


Doug Flagg comments on Timothy L. Burger's problems with lack of
activity with a YeastLab yeast starter, and commented on the six month
expiration date.  I agree that it sounds like less than fresh yeast and
have several thoughts on this.  First, let me issue a non-standard
disclaimer about YeastLab.  While I have no interest in it, Dan
McConnell is a good friend, and I do benefit from getting free yeast
from him for his QC.  However, this gives me a good perspective w.r.t.
old yeast, (and furthermore I can't be bought for a mere $3.50).  I just
asked Dan how old some of the yeast was that I've gotten, and he told me
as much as a year, the oldest he kept for QC samples.  These had, of
course, been kept refrigerated the whole time.  They started slow, but
were viable.


The problem occurs after the yeast leaves the lab.  Yeast is perishable.
Check with your shop and encourage them to pay for 2nd day air shipment.
Otherwise they arrive somewhat compromised.  And  make sure they keep
them refrigerated until sold.  Fresh yeast is best, but older yeast is a
fact of the retail distribution process.  If properly handled, it should
still be fine, if a little slow getting started.  When Timothy's finally
got started, he could have grown it a few more times to get a healthy
starter.  This might have been a good idea even with fresh yeast.  I
like to start my yeast early enough to get several increases.




Another YeastLab topic while I have you on the phone.  Andy Ross wonders
about Bavarian weizen yeasts other than Wyeast for getting a full
clovey, spicey flavor.  Wyeast makes two Weizen yeasts.  One (3056) is a
blend of a neutral yeast and a weizen one.  I'd stay away from that one
in favor of either their pure strain (3068) or YeastLab W51.  Dan has
previously posted here the IDs of all of YeastLabs yeasts, and their W51
Bavarian Wheat is Weihenstephan W66.  I have been very pleased with it
and took a first in last year's Michigan State Fair with a nice, spicey
weizen fermented with it.  Temperature plays a big part in this, with
more banana being produced in the upper 60's and higher.  Mid 60's will
temper the banana but still give nice spice.  I didn't see the post
about sulfur from Wyeast's, but I wouldn't worry.  Many strains,
especially lager yeast, produce this, but it has always blown off for me
by the end of the ferment.

First, Neil, you should know that buckwheat is NOT any kind of wheat.
It is not even a cereal (Gramineae family); it is in the rhubarb family
(Polygonaceae).  However, it would probably provide a decent starch
source and could be used as an adjunct.  I suppose it could be sprouted
(malted), but I have no idea what the enzymatic results of that would
be.  You say that you suspect that both will need to be malted.  You
weren't going to try to malt steel cut oats, were you?  They simply
aren't viable after being chopped.  (I assume the post about sprouted
spent grains was a late April Fool's message).

Subject: Mashing and Specialty Grains


Been a lot of talk ('scuse me, a thread) on whether to mash specialty
grains.  Here's what I do.


Basically I don't.  Due to the size of my mash tun, only diastatic or
fermentable (convertible?) malts/adjuncts get in the mash (2-row, 6-row,
munich, vienna, aromatic, biscuit, wheat, wheat/oat flakes, etc.)   For the
crystals, blacks, chocolates, roasteds, "special B" (mmmm), and other
specialty malts  I simply steep during the mash in a separate pan of water
"to cover"( a couple quarts) at between 165-85F.  I strain out the sweet
colored liquor, save the nearly spent grains, and then toss them on top of
my sparge when the running is nearly done.  I'm happy with the way things
turn out.  The color and clarity of my beers is always great!

HBD 1705 was full of comments about gelatin, most of them emphasizing 
that it should not be boiled "because it gets denatured".


Reality check, please! Folks, that is utter poppycock! Gelatin _is_
denatured protein: "Denaturation of collagen is the conversion of the
rigidly coiled helix to a random coil called gelatin." (Merck Index 11th
ed.)


Gelatin is made by _boiling_ bones and scraps (NOT hooves, that's
keratin!) for hours, typically in a giant pressure cooker. There is not a
trace of native secondary structure in gelatin. 


ObBeer: I used to fine with gelatin. I always boiled it a couple of

I've come to like hazy beer. It's more nutritious that way.

Subject:       Bottle Caps in the Boil


I have read a couple of posts in the past about using bottle caps in
the boil to help even it out some, this sounds like a very clever way 
to get a little better heat distribution within your brew pot. I've 
been using a King Kooker regulated burner for a couple of years now 
and it works really great, execpt the heat of the burner seems to be 
somewhat concentrated in the center if the brew pot requiring a 
little bit more heat to get a really good boil (with the lid about 
halfway on, but I guess that's another story...). It seems like there 
are a couple of things that I can do here to make this boil a little 
bit better. First, better heat distribution within the wort. And 
second, reduce the gas to the burner a little to save energy...I hate 
it when my gas bottles run out.


So, my questions about bottle caps in the boil are as follows:


Are there any problems in using bottle caps in the boil that anyone 
can think of? 


Here are some concerns that come to mind...


Are there any special coatings that are used on bottle caps that can
come off in the boil and leach out into the boiling wort?


What about the plastic (or whatever material it is) liner inside the 
bottle cap, could this melt/deteriorate into the wort?


Is the metal that the bottle caps are made of a problem in general 
due to the high pH of the wort?


How about the paint that is used on some bottle caps (Relax, Have a 
Home Brew...etc)?


If bottle caps are not a good idea, is anybody using anything else 
that accomplishes this heat distribution problem in a different way? 
It would be nice to hear from any of you that have input on this 
subject.


Cheers!

I think so.  Not sure what you can do for it.  Maybe steel cut oats or
a different kinds of flaked or rolled oats would do better.  When I went 
to a health food store looking for oats, there were several things which 
looked very similar.  One such thing was called "oat flakes" which were a
little more expensive than any of the things labelled "rolled oats".  
I'm no oaxpert, as I'm fond of saying, but the beer I made with a lb of 
these oats turned out to have really nice head.  Maybe that's just from the
lactobacillis.  Oops.

I'm not sure about anything else you quote him on, but I'm almost 
positive this is not true.  Several of my relatives are antique collectors
and they say there is definately a difference between the oak used in a 
lot of antique furniture, and some of this stuff is like 1850's, so I doubt
that the difference is due to different handling.  (Could be...)

I can't remember who was searching for information on converting a pasta
maker to a grain mill, but it seemed like a cheap way to find out if I would
enjoy mashing before spending too much money.


The bottom line is most say it will work, but you need to score the rollers
so they will grab the grain and pull it through. Unfortunately, when you do
this, you ain't got a pasta maker anymore.


If you want detailed descriptions on how to do this just go to the stanford
archives and retrieve HBD 783. Also more information in HBD 787 and 881.


Now a question:


I have been looking for a honey ale recipe and can't find anything. Is there
a reason (like will the ale yeast poop out or will fermentation take too
long) for this or am I just looking in the wrong places? Any suggestions?
recipes?

In HBD 1703:


>Richard Hampo asks about when to use gelatine...


In my experience, gelatine is generally used in the secondary prior to
bottling. I've never had to pitch additional yeast due to its use.


>molloy`at`tcpcs2.dnet.etn.com asks about carboy size and blowoff tubes...


The bigger the 'boy, the less material will be blown off due to the greater
volume available for the kraeusen expansion. Most of the material you wish to
blow off rides on top of this kraeusen, so a larger carboy may be able to reap
some of the benefits of blow-off with reduced loss of volume (assuming the
kraeusen reaches the blow-off outlet).


I would recommend you use a tube large enough in diameter that a stopper is
not required. This will reduce the likelihood of your tube becoming plugged
and the whole thing popping off (or the 'boy exploding). I find a 1" dia tube
works well with a carboy.

Greetings HBD readers.


        First I would like to thank you all for the wisdom and opinions 
expressed here.  I have learned much about the fine art of homebrew.  
Even tried the Cranbeery Ale recipe posted a few months ago (and have the 
cranberry skins on the basement ceiling to prove it!).  So now I am 
making the plunge from lurker to participant with a few questions.


Lagering...


        When brewing a lager, when is the appropriate time to bring the 
beer to lagering temperature?  I have a "Honey-Ginger-Lager" percolating 
away now, 1 week + after brewing.  It took 36+ hours at 65ish degrees F 
before any activity was evident.  I moved it out to the storage shed, 
which I think is about 50 degrees, 4 days after brewing.  It still has a 
consistent production of CO2.  I am planning to rack it to another carboy 
as soon as I bottle one of the batches occupying the other 3 carboys.  
(It's fun to have 20 gallons of beer in process!)


Non-barley malt fermentables...


        Another batch of beer, a Weizen, and the Honey-Ginger-Lager, both 
seemed to take a very long time to start fermenting.  For the Weizen I 
used a dry ale yeast (14g) hydrated in cooled boiled water with a bit of 
corn sugar.  The yeast was active at pitching time.  The fermentation 
took about 24 hours to get started.  The Lager used a Wyeast #???? 
Bavarian Lager where the bag was bulged to maximum capacity.  Hindsight 
being 20-20, I guess I should have made a starter for the liquid yeast, 
but I am NOT a patient person (I only used the Wyeast because my Homebrew 
store was out of dry Lager yeast).  So, I guess my question is, when 
using "sugars" which take longer to ferment (such as honey and wheat), is 
there any way to get the fermentation started sooner to avoid potential 
infection?  I'm figuring that if the "official" yeast takes a long time 
to start with the fermentation, the wild ones also take longer and the 
longer start time isn't really a problem.  My significant other seems 
paranoid about it though, so I thought I would ask. 


Dandelion Wine....


        Finally, with spring in the air, those little yellow weeds are 
popping up.  I was wondering if anyone has a recipe for Dandelion wine.  
It would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks in advance for the input, and thanks for the informative dialog.

<Insert shameless suckup here>


I'm planning to make a dark pale ale along the lines of Old Peculier using Dave
Line's extract recipe.  The recipe calls for 4 lbs of Dark extract and 2 lbs of
dark brown sugar plus specialty grains, sacharin, and treacle to prime.  Does
this malt/sugar mix sound appropriate, or am I going to end up with
Porter-Cider?  Any other combinations of malts and kettle sugars?


Any thoughts on which Wyeast?  My guess would be London Ale.


Finally, how many little packets of the "pink stuff" equals one sacharin tablet?
I haven't seen those things in years.  What about the "blue stuff"?  Dextrine
powder?


Thanks -- Randy
