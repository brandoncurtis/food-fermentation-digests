Subject: Late hops/PBS?/HBD drops


Dear Friends, got some comments on things in #1710.


Scott Bukofsky is having trouble getting good hop aroma from his late 
additions.  Scott, I had similar problems with the same kind of addition 
schedule you report.  After tasting an excellent American pale ale made 
by Andy Walsh, I adopted his procedure, which was to do *very* late 
additions--like at 10 and 2 minutes, rather than 30 and 10.  Nowadays, 
when I am going for big hop nose, I do additions at 10 and 2 minutes 
plus dry hop.  Example: for a recent 23-litre US style pale, I used all 
Cascades pellets as follows: 50 gr for 60 min, 40 gr for 10, 40 gr for 2, 
then upon racking to secondary added 50 gr for a 9-day secondary (OG 
1050, FG 1010).  Got good comments on hop character at last night's club 
tasting.


Pat Maloney I think misinterpreted Chris Geden's question about whether 
the so-called PBS has archives available.  He was asking about the Jay 
Hersh page, and not the HBD archives, am I right?


Rich Larsen asked about getting dropped from the mailing list.  This 
happened to me last week, and to several others with whom I've been in 
touch.  I ended up having to resubscribe to get back on.  Perhaps it has 
something to do with Rob's recently added header banner about service 
providers--in my case, my system assigns an alias 
(david.draper`at`mq.edu.au) to my more cumbersome "real" address, and it may 
be that having two addresses associated with my name got into Rob's 
attempt to weed out the requests he mentioned in that banner.  Just a 
wild guess.  In other news, the hiatus at the stanford archive site was 
short lived, all appears to be back to normal.


I for one enjoyed the Belch and Burp Show--nice chuckle in the morning.


Cheers, Dave in Sydney

chuck m asked about rye recipes, and i thought i'd share my experiment with
the rest of you. this was my first attempt at using rye, and had no idea
what flavor it would impart. here is the recipe for the rye pale ale (which
i called 'ryp ale'):


1.0# pale malt
1.0# rye
(mashed these at 150f for 75min, with 170f mashout)
3.3# northwestern gold extract
1.5# rice extract (the powdered stuff)
1.0oz northern brewer (6.9% alpha, 60min)
1.0oz kent golding (6.0%, steep at end of boil)
1/2tsp irish moss with 10 mins left to boil
wyeast british ale yeast


my intent was to brew a relatively dry version of a pale ale in order to
find out just what flavor the rye might contribute. i really like this beer.
it's quite light. it has what i call an earthy bitterness, which i attribute
to the rye (gives it some pizazz).


chuck referred to one source that called for 60% rye and used a weisse
yeast. i can't imagine what that would taste like. perhaps it's time for
another experiment.

In a word, No.


Green bottles provide essentially no more protection than clear
bottles for the wavelengths that do the harm.


Brown bottles provide substantially more protection, but NOT
perfect protection. When I conduct my Dr. Beer seminars, I use
unopened brown bottles of megabrew that have sat in a sunny window
of my house for a week. The skunky odor that issues forth when the
bottle is opened is unmistakeable, and a very impressive demonstration.

I assume that the fine crush consists of both powdered husk material and 
powdered endosperm (starch).  If this is the case, then you are potentially 
avoiding tannins leaching from the powdered husk.  Exessive powder has also been
reported to lead to stuck sparges, so you may be avoiding this problem as well. 
However, you would also be losing potential extract from the powdered endosperm.


I also use a corona to crack my grain, and I also get a little flour.  It's 
probably unavoidable.  But I just go ahead and dump it all in my mash.  I have 
never had any problems with a stuck sparge or with tannin extraction.  These are
the only two _potential_ problems I can think of off hand associated with flour.
I'm sure someone will come up with others.

On purging with CO2, several people have commented on this, most lately being 
Lance Stronk <S29033%SOA.decnet`at`oscar.sea.sikorsky.com>, saying (in part)

It's actually not so automatic as it might seem.  Air and CO2 _will_ mix.  The 
following is probably obvious, but. . .


To get the most air out of a container with the least CO2, you should take care 
not to introduce turbulence when introducing the CO2.  Turbulence will cause air
to mix with the entering CO2 and defeat your purpose.  I would recommend gently 
introducing the CO2 into the very bottom-most part of the container until at 
least a volume has been displaced (when I used to work for a defense contractor,
we used to use a target value of 5 volumes when we built argon candles, but 
then, air contamination was a much bigger issue).  There will inevitably be some
mixing anyway, but the important thing is to dilute the air in the vessel to 
unimportant levels.


Like I said, it's probably obvious.  Just my $0.02.

 Talk about missing the point.....  I thought I would learn something useful 
 from this thread and all I got was semantics.  To most folks (and one of many 
 definitions in the dictionary) denature means to render unfit for use.
 I have never heard the term used in connection with gelatine but have read 
 many times that it should not be boiled.  I have also always heard that it 
 should always be disolved in cold water.  I do this and then raise to 170F to 
 pasturize it.  Now, may I conclude from the above that boiling does not 
 "render unfit for use" as I intend to use it or simply that it will not be 
 "denatured", whatever that means?

Yes.  A brown bottle is much more effective in block the wavelengths of

From: ajdel`at`interramp.com (A. J. deLange)
Subject: Conc. as CaCO3


In #1710 Bill Sutton was puzzled by an apparent inconsistency in
Principals of Brewing Science by George Fix with respect to water
chemistry. In particular Fix defines mg/l as CaCO3 by
1000*100*moles/litre of whatever substance is being converted to
these units (p15) and then calls 1.e-6 moles/l hydronium ion 0.001
ppm as CaCO3 on p17. I agree with Bill that something is funny.
It should be 1000*100*1.e-6 = 0.1 ppm as CaCO3 i.e 1.e5 times the
molarity. I think it must be a misprint.


Another question concerns why ion concentrations are specified in
mg/l as CaCO3. This is really arbitrary but I suspect that the
practice was started because:
  1. CaCO3 has a molecular weight of 100 which makes it very easy to
     convert moles per litre to mg/l as CaCO3 (just multiply by 1.e5)
  2. In the pH range normally found in drinking/brewing water most of
     the dissolved carbonate has been converted to bicarbonate so that
     if, for example, 203.7 mg of CaCO3 were dissolved per litre of
     water resulting in a pH of 8 (the water would have had to have been
     substantially acidified first) the result would be 198 mg/l
     bicarbonate as CaCO3 and the alkalinity 200 mg/l as CaCO3. Thus
     the alkalinity as CaCO3 is an approximation to the amount of
     CaCO3 actually dissolved where the alkalinity is due to calcite
     alone.
  3. By dividing the alkalinity as CaCO3 by 1.e5 one quickly gets the
     approximate moles per litre hydronium required to "neutralize"
     the alkalinity. For the example just given 198/1.e5 = 0.00198
     moles/litre hydronium.


The example numbers correspond to Fix's example of alkalinity 200 mg/l
at pH 8. Let us work this example through in the hope of increasing
insight.


Definine the ratios r1 = 10^(pH - pK1) and r2 = 10^(pH - pK2) where pH
is the pH of the raw water, pK1 =  6.38 and pK2 = 10.32. In the example
the starting pH is 8 so r1 = 10^(8 - 6.38) = 41.6869 and
r2 = 10^(8 - 10.32) = .004786. r1 is the ratio of bicarbonate to
carbonic concentration and r2 the ratio of carbonate to bicarbonate
concentration. Thus if there are x moles/l carbonic there are r1*x moles
bicarbonate and r1*r2*x moles/l of carbonate. The total of the concentrations
of all three species is (1 + r1 + r1*r2)x. The fraction of the total which
is carbonic is 1/(1 + r1 + r1*r2) = 2.33%; the fraction which is bicarbonate
is r1/(1 + r1 + r1*r2) = 97.2% and the fraction which is carbonate is
r1*r2/(1 + r1 + r1*r2) = 0.46%. Thus the most common species is
bicarbonate ion. The same relationships apply if x is expressed in mg/l
as CaCO3.


Carbonic does not contribute to alkalinity so that the total alkalinity
is (using Fix's definition - p15) 41.6869*x + 2*41.6869*.004786*x + .1
= 200 i.e the concentration of bicarbonate plus twice the concentration
of carbonate plus the concentration of hydroxyl (minus the concentration
of hydronium which is unappreciable at 0.001). Thus x = 4.7498 mg/l as
CaCO3. Then the bicarbonate is 41.6869*4.7498 = 198.00 and the carbonate
41.6869*.004786*4.7498 = 0.9476, (and the total = 203.7). From this it
is clear that the majority of the alkalinity is due to the bicarbonate
ion in this pH range.


Fix's definition of alkalinity implies that all carbonate and bicarbonate
will be converted to carbonic. At pH 4.3 the mole fraction of bicarbonate
is a little less than 1% and of carbonate about 1e-6% thus pH 4.3 closely
represents the condition of total conversion to carbonic. pH 4.3 is also
the end point of methyl orange which is used as an indicator in measuring
alkalinity by titration with 0.1N HCl. Thus alkalinity measured by that
method and Fix's definition correspond closely.


Conversion of 1 mole of bicarbonate to carbonic requires 1 mole hydronium and
conversion of 1 mole carbonte to carbonic  requires 2 moles hydronium
so that conversion of the example water requires
198*1e-5 + 2*0.9476*1.e-5 = 0.00199 moles/l hydronium which compares very
closely with the number obtained by dividing alkalinity by 1e5.

Subject: faux fruit beers?






I read in the last digest about people who used frozen fruit concentrate 
instead of 'real' fruit. In what quantities? I know the concentrate has 
to be preservative free, but how do I figure out how much to use? I guess 
I could make up a few batches and experiment, but if there are any 
suggestions on where to start, any help would be appreciated. 


My last batch was an apple wheat brew, and for reasons unbeknownst to me, 
the whole lot had ring - o - round the neck. I tried a few new techniques 
that I wasn't entirely familiar with, so I imagine that had a lot to do 
with it. If I could use concentrates, that would eliminate one of the 
possible infection risks, and it would be a lot cheaper! Here in Hawaii, 
just about all domestic fruit is shipped in, and when I'm interested in  
berries, things get expensive.......<sigh>.....that's the price of 
paradise I guess.  :-)

Hi,
        In reply to Andy Walsh's comments on Graham Wheelers

been delighted on many occasions with my brew. 


Andy said: "You will still make very bitter beer with his given

I certainly have not found them overly bitter. In fact, having
recently done a side by side test with his version of "Old Speckled
Hen" and a sample of the real stuff, I think he was spot on. May be
I've just been lucky and have used hops with lower % alpha acids.


Andy said: "So what do you find when you look up his recipe for
Marston's Pedigree? Yep, it's all malt."


Well, this is not true for my copy of "Brew Your Own Real Ale At
Home". Included in the recipe is "800g Maltose syrup (18 %)" -
certainly not all malt be my reckoning. 


Anyway, I would highly recommend "Brew Your Own Real Ale At Home" to
any home-brewer wanting to replicate British real ales. Use your own
methods and hopping rates if you like, but I've followed his methods

Portugese wines. Because of longer travel times (to the colonies?), a block
of lead was placed in each keg to stabilize/preserve it. What do you think
the wine's acidity did then?
Apparently at REALLY high lead poisoning levels, gout is one of the side
effects because of kidney damage. Your urine will also turn blue. Man , talk
about being able to write your name in the snow;)
Another side effect of high blood lead levels is dementia , as in insanity. 
If anyone is interested,I'll see if I can get more details and references.

Hello all,
I am unable to find local, reasonably priced sources for stainless nipples
for my keg conversion project. 
What is the collective wisdom regarding using brass fittings for mash tuns,
sparge water vessels and boilers? I understand that brazing is not kosher,
but what about brass nipples and valves?
Thanks very much for any input.

Subject:       RE: Venturi Vs. Bernoulli


********************************************************
**  WARNING: Bernoulli/Venturi discussion to follow.  **
**      Please move on if you couldn't care less!     **
********************************************************


Well, I've been disconnected from my email for about 3 weeks (LAN problems)
so I don't know if this has already been discussed or not.  I've been doing 
some research and some thinking, and here is what I have found.


The original question was, what is the correct name for the observed effect
of air being drawn into a siphoning tube, Venturi or Bernoulli effect.  I 
originally argued that there is no Bernoulli effect, only the Bernoulli 
equation, so it must be the Venturi effect.  Others then correctly pointed 
out that a Venturi meter has a change in diameter of the pipe, so our siphon
tube could not cause a Venturi effect because it is of constant diameter.


Well, guess what, we are both wrong.  It is neither!  Both the Venturi effect
and the Bernoulli effect (yes, I now admit that there is such a thing) have
in their definition that the drop in pressure is caused by the flow (velocity)
of the liquid.  While there may be some drop in pressure due to the flow, the
predominant cause of the lower pressure in the tube is due to the difference
in elevation and is there regardless of whether the liquid is flowing or not.
Thus these two "effects" do not apply to what we are observing!


Mental experiment:  suck some water in a straw and put your thumb over the
top.  Now hold the straw vertical in the air.  Now poke a hole in the side
of the straw near the top.  Air will immediately be drawn in before any 
appreciable flow out of the bottom of the straw begins because of the pull
of the water wanting to fall.  This causes a negative pressure inside the
straw.        _____
             / ___ \    Bernoulli equation:              
            / /   \ \      V=velocity  Z=elevation  P=pressure
|          | |  |  | |     p=density   g=acceleration of gravity
|          | |  |  | |     (V1)^2/2g + Z1 + P1/pg = (V2)^2/2g + Z2 + P2/pg
|__________| |__|  | |     
|          | |  |  | |     Velocity at points 1 & 2 are equal so V's cancel.
|          | |  |  | |     Relative pressure at point 2 is atmospheric so
|               |  |.|(1)  P2 = 0.  Equation reduces to:
|               |  | |     
|_______________|  | |     Z1 + P1/pg = Z2 (notice velocity not a factor)
                   | |     
                   | |     Rearrange:  P1 = (Z2-Z1)pg
                   |.|(2)  Z1 > Z2 so (Z2-Z1) is negative
                    |      
                    V      Thus P1 is negative pressure!!!!


The interesting point of all of this is that the higher up the tube you
place your hole, the greater the pressure difference and thus the more air
will get drawn in (and the better the aeration of your wort!).  I point this
out because I have noticed some people incorrectly stating that the hole 
should be placed close to the exit of the tube, presumably because they feel
the velocity should be faster there?!?  However, do not put the hole BEFORE 
your counter current wort chiller.  Introducing O2 in the hot wort could 
cause hot-side-aeration from what I understand.

Re: Michael Lloyds question about "cheating" of fruit beers by using
canned fruit...  I brewed the cranberry-wheat beer from the recent
special ingedients issue of Zymurgy twice using identical ingredients
and process, side-by-side,  except that in one batch I used fresh fruit,
and in the other I used canned.  Both batches turned out fine, but the
canned fruit batch had no discernable fruit flavor.  It did have a
nicer color than the fresh fruit batch.  I farmed out samples to be
tasted blind; most tasters preferred the sample made with fresh fruit,
but this was by no means unanimous.  An interesting observation was
that all of the color leached out of the canned fruit; it ended up snow
white.

Subject: Ack!  First bad batch!


I'm sorry to report that this, my third batch, is STUCK!  I made a Palilallia
India Pale Ale from CP's book.  I tried to do everything right on this batch,
after making numerous mistakes on my first two.  Suprisingly, the first two
fermented completely and I'm still enjoying them today. This batch, which I
brewed carefully, avoiding past sins, is stuck at 1.030 (OG=1.057), after one
week in primary, and two weeks in secondary.  Let me outline what I did with
this batch and didn't do previously.


1)  Used an immersion wort chiller for the first time


2) shook the heck out of the carboy before pitching the yeast.  Previously, I
didn't shake at all!!


3) Used Wyeast for the first time, used dry before.


Other than the above, I followed my usual procedure.


I know the usual theories of stuck fermentation, but have debunked most of
them in this case.  First, there is plenty for the yeast to eat, I used 7
pounds of DME.  Secondly, aeration could be a problem, but I aerated MUCH
MORE this time than in the past.  Thirdly, I used Wyeast out of the packet,
technically under-pitching.  However, fermentation started in 12 hours and
was pretty vigorous.  Also, I repitched with DRY yeast last week, in
desperation.  A week later, still sitting at 1.030.  Fourthly, the
temperature has been a very constant 70 F, so there's no chance it's too
cool.  Lastly, the beer smells and tastes great, it's just way too sweet for
an IPA, so there aren't any obvious infections!


Any stuck fermentation theories I'm missing here??  Any hope of un-sticking
this sucker??

Yep.  In addition to the chlorine, which may or may not do something funny
to the mash, Toronto probably has lots of bicarb, and that will turn into
carbonate and precipitate with a nice boil.  And that can definately help
during the mash.  I'm a bit fuzzy on the science (I'm a fuzzy guy in 
general), but in terms of ions, the most important boiling/salting is 
going to be of your mash water.

Different strokes for different folks I guess.  I thought it was kind of

Subject: infection... yeah or nay!


For the collective wit & wisdom of the digest...


I bottled a batch of "Turtle's Wheat" from CP's Companion last Saturday (4/15).
Last night I decided to see how the carbonation was progressing and popped 2
bottles in the refrigerator.


Before I describe the problem, some background info...


I boiled 1.25c light DME in 0.5 gallon water for 15 minutes. When this solution
was ideally below 150*F I added 1 tbs. gelatin (to help clarify the brew in
the bottle). After gelatin was adequately dissolved, I cooled the solution to
room temp (68*F) by dunking the covered pot into a sink of cold water. After the
priming solution was cool, I poured this into a sanitized bottling bucket (one
of those 6 gallon white plastic pails), then racked the beer from my secondary
(5 gal. glass carboy) into the bottling pail. To rack I use an orange nipple
cap for the carboy with a racking cane inserted through one opening. I force
CO2 into the other opening to start the siphon. (BTW the carboy is elevated 3
feet above the bucket so that gravity can do the work.) The siphon hose is fed
through a hole in the lid of the bottling bucket and rests on the bottom. The
swirling action from the brew entering the bucket has always given me more than
adequate "mixing" with the priming solution.


 .now back to the problem at hand...


I opened one of the cooled bottles and poured into a glass. The very first thing
that I noticed was a nice sounding ppfffsttt (a good sign of early carbonation).
The second thing I saw was that all of the sediment proceeded to drain out into
my glass. (I was under the impression that the gelatin would form a layer on the
bottom of the bottle, effectively trapping sediment under it.) The third item
was that the beer had a slight sour smell (not bitter/tart, but rather pungent).
The taste was rather dull and boring... no great hops, no great wheat or malt
character... it was not like cardboard, it just did not have a distinguished
taste or feel. The last thing that caught my attention was a fine ringlet around
the inside of the neck of the bottle!!!


 .well here is what I need to know...


A--Is the ring around the neck a sign of infection or could it be gelatin 
   solidifying at the surface?
B--Is it too early in the bottle (only 1 week) for the gelatin to set into a 
   film on the bottom?
C--What in the world is that pungent odor (it is not strong or immediately 
   apparent, only after sniffing the beer can you tell it is there)?


TIA!

Subject: NA Beer






  Hi, I've been lurking for awhile on the HBD, and have enjoyed reading
it immensely. Recently, the subject of NA beer brewing came up and I
thought I might ask a few questions.


  I'm not currently a brewer, but I would like to give it a try. What's
held me back so far is that I don't drink alcohol. I do enjoy NA beers,
though, and I agree with Wade Wallinger's opinion in a previous post
that generally the European NA beers are better that the American NAs.
The selection is real limited, though, and I thought it might be nice to
try to make my own. I've been hoping I would see something about brewing
NA beers and appreciated the recent posts. (I would have asked myself,
eventually, when I was ready for the time & expense - new home & baby
take precedence right now :)


Keith Frank:


  You said you could send more info to Cheryl Ramsey about your NA
brewing experiences - would you be willing to send it to me also? From
your comments, it sounds like this topic has come up before - can you or
anyone else point me to some archives that might have more info?


  It was mentioned that using the evaporation method, you lose a lot of
water. Couldn't you replace the volume of water that is lost?


Lee C. Bussy:


  I did like the idea of using a vacuum to lower the alcohol boiling
point - it would just be a matter of coming up with the right equipment
and the pressure-temperature curves for alcohol. Did you get any
comments on this?


  In reading Papazian (sp?), he mentions reverse osmosis. Does anyone
know if that kind of equipment would be available to the home brewer?
Even if it were, I imagine that it would probably be prohibitively
expensive.


  I'd appreciate any comments or suggestions anyone may have. I really
want to give this a try. It seems like it would be a lot of fun and
profitable to the palate as well.


Thanks,
Dave

The recipe looks good Jerry, I calculate an OG of 1.062 and an IBU of 35.
The only comments I would make would be increase the 30 minute addition of
Centennial to 1 oz for a total of 42 IBUs (40-45 being more in style for an
IPA)
Also, your 2 oz of Centennial for Dry Hopping seems excessive. I would use 1 oz
for the two weeks.
 
Your Mash Temps and pH look good, the 158 initial temp will generate a higher
bodied beer, I would anticipate your FG being 1.012 or so.


I find that the Nylon tubing valves are better for controlling sparge flow, you
might look for one at the brewshop.

The way I do it:
10 lbs of 2Row base Malt `at` 30 pts/lb => 300 pts  (nominal)
1 lbs of Crystal 60 `at` 10 pts/lb      => 10 pts   (nominal)
                                       ---------
                                        310 pts/6.2 gal => 1.050 calculated OG
You got 1.049 or:
49 pts/lb/gal x 6.2 gal = 303.8/310 = 98% of nominal yield ie. Damn Good.
You can say 27 pts/lb/gal but you can see what the lower yielding specialtys do
to your perceived extraction.

Are you saying you were using a Counter flow Chiller and could not get it to
work and dumped hot wort into your primary??! Ouch! (trumpet heard in the
distance)
The gunk ie trub will not be a factor if you rack to a secondary at some point
after primary fermentation. (After the krausen starts falling back in.)

On a lark I went to the grocery store and bought two cans of 100%
grape juice (frozen concentrate) and dumped them into a one gallon
jug with some yeast from a previous batch of beer.  I added 2 cups
of table sugar and topped off with water to make 1 gallon.
     This is roughly based on a recipe which my (deceased) aunt gave
my family years ago, though her recipe called for 4 cups of sugar.
It has been fermenting very well all week and I plan to let it 
ferment for about 6 weeks before racking to a secondary and later
bottling it.
     Does anyone know what I will end up with?  Does anyone have any
similar recipes?  Sorry that this has little to do with beer per se
but it seemed like a fun experiment that would use the leftover 
yeast from the batch of beer that I had bottled the day before.


(Sorry if that was kind of garbled.  I'm on codeine cough medicine;))
P.S.  Use the "freenet" address for email.  Thanks

Subject: Samuel Smiths Pale Ale


A friend of mine has challenged me to clone Samuel Smiths Old Brewery Pale
Ale.  I told him I was up to the challenge, but after checking my available
resources, I was unable to find a recipe.  So, off to the net....


Does anyone have a recipe that they have had great success with?  My
preference is all-grain.


Thanks,

Subject: Copper Boiling Kettles


I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who has constructed boiling kettles
from copper............ 


I have several ss boiling kettles made from kegs, but I'm hoping to increase
my batch size to ~25-30 gallons (I'm currently doing two all-grain 10 gallon
batches at a time).  The kettles I have now take a great deal of time to
bring to a boil on my South Bend stove.   I will be moving over to 160K btu
wok burners soon, but if I'm going to construct  x-large kettles I figure I
may as well use copper.  
I know that copper tigs easily and I do have access to tig equipment, so I'm
mostly looking for help in the materials and design area.  Where did you
acquire materials, what type of thickness walls for the kettle, any
reinforcing, welding method used, valves, handles, etc.


Does anyone have good or bad experiences in this area???
Replies via private email are fine - I will post a summary when all the info
is in...

They are saved as .Z files. There's a difference. The unix command 
"uncompress" will work on them, I am told. The easiest way to 
uncompress them is when you ftp them. If you missed 1706, for 
example, go to the directory where 1706.Z is stored and write
get 1706


That will send you the uncompressed file. I don't know of a way to 
use mget to get a bunch of files uncompressed at once.


As a Mac user, I bring them home compressed and use the utility 
MacCompress to open them up. I think I got it from info-mac. Works 
quite well.


I believe all this discussion arose from a creative misunderstanding, 
BTW. I interpreted the original question to be about the possible 
archives of a closed, membership-by-application-only homebrew forum 
that was once given the misleading appelation "PBS of homebrewing."
