In HBD #1713 Jack Schmidling is still puzzling over gelatin:

No, you did get the information but did not recognize it. Let's try again.

But not when you use it in the same breath as "protein" and "heat". Just
as "mash" does not mean the same thing when you talk about beer, potatoes,
or Casanova.

Eek! Of all people, you, the Great Debunker, should know that what you
read ain't necessarily so.

What you read, quite possibly in garbled prose, is that gelatin should
be preswollen in cold water; that's because if it is dumped into boiling
water it will clump into a disgusting mess. It does not dissolve
appreciably in cold water in a reasonable length of time. It does swell,
and that makes the subsequent heating much easier, because heat transfer 
is much more even. No clumps and no burning mess at the bottom of the pan.


> this and then raise to 170F to pasteurize it.


Or boil it. Boiling it in water will not change it in any way.


Note for cooks: Gelatin is a protein, and as such is subject to cleavage
by various agents commonly found in a kitchen. Paramount among those are
meat tenderizers and certain fruits (pineapples and papayas especially),
which contain proteolytic enzymes, and acids (vinegar and lemon juice,
for instance). Heating, or boiling, gelatin with acids _will_ degrade it
(not denature, it's already denatured) by cleavage of the bonds between
certain amino-acids. Such gelatin boiled in acid is kaput.


Gelatin boiled in water is just as it ever was, since it was made in the
first place by boiling for many hours.

Yes.


> use it or simply that it will not be "denatured", whatever that means?


Gelatin _is_ denatured, by definition. It stays that way. Denatured is
good. 


If one were to renature it by some means, it would be collagen, i.e.
gristle or tendons. I don't want tendons in my beer! 


And once again, my experience with boiled gelatin in ales has always
been positive. Never have I got a beer that failed to clear to crystal
brightness.


The down side of gelatin is that it tends to coat the bottles with a dull 
film. The beer is bright but the bottle gets cloudy. Bleach removes that 
film efficiently.

Subject: Cask preperation


I Just bought an Oak cask a few days ago and want to try my first
cask-conditioned ale. My question: What do I need to do to sanitize
and prepare the cask before racking in my beer? The case is made of
american white oak and has a real nice oaky smell to it. It isn't lined
with anything except the oak on the inside appears darker than the outside
as if it's been burnt. I thought of just pouring a little boiling water
in and swishing it around for awhile to get rid of any surface nasties,
but am curious how others prepare oak for conditioning beer. (I know
that some british ales use pitch lined cases, but I'm not interested in
that. I want there to be an oaky character in the finished beer...)


Thanks in advance!

I ran into something like this recently and found that if you request the file

before tranfering it to you. You may want to try that.

Subject: Late Hops


Just a minor note.  When figuring the addition of late hops and comparing to 
someone else, you need to determine how long your wort stays hot.  Consider 
these two situations:


Person          Time before end of boil         Time to wort cooling
  A                 5 min.                           15 min.
  B                 5 min.                           75 min.


Person A sends the wort through a chiller so it is completely cool 15 minutes
after leaving the boil, person B cools in the bathtub and it takes quite a 
while.


Personally, I would think that the bitterness, flavor, and aroma contributions
of the two would be very different.

saw another comment recently about the alleged 'fact' that since co2 is
heavier than air it will settle out over a liquid and keep air from getting
to the liquid. by that logic we would all be dead since co2 in the
atmosphere would surround us on the surface and o2 would rise above us. gas
mixtures remain fairly well mixed, regardless of the molecular weights of
the components in the mixture. so, the best solution is to purge air from a
keg by pressuring and depressuring a few times with co2 rather than by
relying on a 'blanket' of co2.

Subject:      Rye and hop bitterness


This past JAnuary I posted a note about some awful bitterness that was being
imparted into my brews, making them virtually undrinkable. I had basically
messed up a wicked and a cream ale. I searched for the answer in water chemistr
y, but later realized that it probably had more to do with my method than
anything. As an extract brewer (going all-grain this summer :) ), I brewed
like many other extract brewers. I did, however, experiment with rinsing off my
hops when transfering my brew to the primary. I felt that this was the cause:
by rinsing the hops I was pulling off more oils thereby drawing off more bit-
terness than desired. I was told by the owners of the local homebrew place that
if it were indeed hop bitterness, this should be less noticeable over time.
Well  it's been about 4 months, and I tasted the cream ale this weekend. The
bitterness was almost entirely gone, and the cream ale was very nice and creamy
(tasty too!), the wicked still was bitter, but not as bad as it originally
was. I am almost sure (sorry about my unscientific method) that the problem
was with the rinsing of hops and not my water, equipment, or my choice of
hops (some thought it may be my choice of hops, but I've always used Brewer's
Gold, Cascade, Fuggles, Willamette in other brews and never had a problem. The
only thing I've done differently in those breww that I did not do in another br
ew was rinse the hops. Therefore, I believe the method was the problem.


There was also a note about rye today (4/24/95). I have brewed an extract rye
ale using no rye malt, but using rye flakes in much the same manner that an
oatmeal-stout brewer (from extract) would make an oatmeal stout. I put
about 10-15 ounces of rye flake into the steeping specialty grains, and I was
very pleased with the results. It imparted a nice dry palate to the pale ale
recipe I added it to, and has become a favorite of several friends who have
tried it. I had the usual problems (gunks up the strainer which allows some
flaky residue to get into the  boil pot, but no harm done; more inconvenience
than anything).


Basically what I did as put the rye flakes into the steeping specialty grains
and steeped the whole lot for 30 minutes at 160 degrees F.

Subject: simplified RIMS


In light of recent postings regarding the difficulty of cleaning RIMS
heating elements and larger-sized RIMS, I'd thought I'd desscribe my recent
experiences with a simpler RIMS system.


I've wanted to implement a RIMS for some time, but haven't found the time
or $ to put it together.  I was watching the owner of a local homebrew
store brew a batch on his SABCO RIMS, when I observed that, according to
the instructions, the in-line heater was used mostly to maintain temp
during the rests (and didn't work that hard at it).  Most of the heat for
temperature boosts came from the gas burners.


Now, I've had a magnetically-coupled pump for some time, which I use with a
three-tier, one-burner half barrel system.  My kettle is a converted keg,
with a false bottom cut from a piece of perforated stainles sheet. A SS
tube, bent so that the tip is about 1/4" from the bottom of the kettle,
allows for wort removal. A recycled gas water heater element is the burner.


To operate this as a RIMS, I simply run the drain tube into the pump inlet,
and pump the wort back up to the top of the grain bed (through the opening
in the top of the kettle).  There is no electric heating element, no
temperature control, nothing but a kettle, burner, and pump.  When I want
to do a temperature boost, I simply turn on the gas burner, and monitor the
temperature at the top of the grain bed.


To demonstrate the effectiveness of this system, I brewed a batch of Wit
last week.  I doughed in about 16# of grain, which was 52% pale malt, 21%
white wheat, 21% rolled wheat flakes, and 6% wheat malt. Mash thickness was
about 1.6 qt/lb.  I doughed in to 40C for a 30 min glucanase rest, did a 45
min protein rest in the 48-52C range, raised to 60C for 45 min, 70C for 15
min, and mashed out at 80C.  Temperature rise with the burner on was about
1.0 - 1.5 C per minute, so boosts generally took less than 10 min.
Remarkably, the temperature held fairly constant during the rests; a blast
from the burner every 10-15 minutes kept the temperature fairly steady. At
no time did the mash stick, despite being 50% wheat. In fact, the flow
through the pump was so fast, I had to throttle it back somewhat to avoid
splashing/turbulence.  There was no scorching of the wort, however, when I
removed the false bottom afterwards, I noticed that there was maybe 1/8" of
proteinaceous material coagulated on the bottom of the keg.  I do not see
this as a problem.


In short, I have implemented a RIMS without the complications of an inline
heater and temperature controller.  This system gives me most of the
advantages of a RIMS (quick temperature boosts, uniform temperature, no
stirring) without much of the complication.  If you have a kettle (w/false
bottom) and a pump, you're in business.  I will probably eventually add the
inline heater and controller, but I've found that what I have has enabled
me to "ease into" RIMS.

Subject: Siphon Aerators


Keith Royster, with respect to siphon-tube aerators, correctly points out:


>The interesting point of all of this is that the higher up the tube you
>place your hole, the greater the pressure difference and thus the more >air
will get drawn in (and the better the aeration of your wort!). 


However, from this you can also see that the lowest pressure within the
siphon is at the top of the bend, above the upper (source) vessel. 
Obviously, placing several holes at this location will impair the operation
of the siphon, as the wort on the source side will be free to flow back from
whence it came.  In fact, if the air inlet holes are placed at any point
above the bottom of the upper vessel, the siphon will stop before the source
vessel is emptied.  When the level of the holes and the level of the wort in
the source vessel match, the pressure at the surface of the wort and at the
air inlet holes are equal and atmospheric, and there is no longer any force
to drive air into the wort stream, or the flow of the siphon! 


The sub-atmospheric pressure inside the siphon hose is also responsible for
causing CO2 to evolve from fermented beer when racking, whereupon it collects
at the upper bend and slows the siphon flow.

Subject: NA alternatives


     Several people have asked recently about making non-alcoholic beer.  
     The only response I've seen involves driving off alcohol by heat, then 
     using artificial carbonation.  I seem to recall that, by definition, a 
     non-alcoholic beverage must be <= .5% alcohol.  I question if this 
     would be a hard constraint for a homebrewed alternative.  I think 
     there is a threshold for alcohol content that triggers the cravings 
     for people with dependencies, but I don't know what that threshold is. 
      For the people who just don't want to get drunk, a very low gravity 
     beer may be a good alternative (particularly if you aren't set up to 
     keg yet).  An additional incentive for this would be the reduction in 
     calories.  A friend of mine made the "Belgian Driving Beer" from the 
     book by Rajotte (?), and it was surprisingly very good.  You could 
     probably drink these all night with very little effect.  I don't own 
     the book, so I can't forward the recipe.  However, if I wanted to brew 
     a very low alcohol beer, that is where I would start.  Does anyone 
     else have experience with this recipe/style?  I would be very 
     interested in other peoples comments.

I use gelatine without any problems, about 12 teaspoons per litre. I boil
the wort for about 15 mins. and dissolve the gelatin in the hot liquid. I
then put it in small glass jars and sterilize by steaming in a big kettle.
(I just put the jars on a plate in the kettle and add a little water. I do
not immerse them in the boiling water.) I have had no problems other than
that the gelatin liquifies above 25C, so the slants have to be kept below
that.


I made a test to find out how much gelatine to add. The result was that all
of the jars solidified but more gelatine gave a "harder" media (of course).
There was no difference in the critical temperature at 25C, though.


Andy, are you sure your room temperature was low enough? If so I can't
explain why it didn't work for you. Agar is not an option for me because of
the price (more than 100 $ for 1 kg, and no smaller packages available).

Subject: Mash Starch Conversion/GOTT Cooler for sale (VA/DC Area)


Hi All!


I've brewed about 6 all grain batches and have a few questions on the
mash process.  I do single infusion mashes in a 7 gal Gott cooler, use a Phils
Phalse bottom, and sparge with a Phils Sparger (whirly gig).  During the mash
we're concerned with pH and starch conversion.  The runoff is supposed to be
recirculate until clear (10-30 min) before the iodine starch test is done.  My
question is when using a cooler and doing single infusions mashes, how do I
recirculate the runoff without constantly taking the cooler lid on and off
(which cools the mash) to recirculate?  If the runoff is not recirculated
quickly, but collected for a while, the mash water level drops below the
grainbed, and I recall reading that makes the mash pH go up.  Is this true? 
Also, by draining a lot of the liquid before recirculating increases the
chances of a stuck sparge.  So, how do I recirculate the runoff, without
cooling the mash too much, or not draining the mash level too far and not
raising the pH of the mash?  The only methods I see are:


  (1) Manually intensive (draining, removing lid, pouring in runoff, closing
lid, draining more, etc. and lots of heat loss) until runoff is clear. 
                                 or
  (2) Have a very thin mash (mash in with 1 1/2 to 2 qts water/lb of grain),
and draining large amounts of the runoff before recirculating.
                                 or
  (3) Using a recirculating pump and running till clear


I am open to suggestions.  TIA

compare beer to beer without a standard. If there is no such device, I 
offer this suggestion without any claim to patent :<) for any motivated 
person who has the time to develop a tool which would be of great

Text item: Text_1


     I noted the submission of Andy Walsh from Sydney regarding his 
     inability to get boiled gelatin to set.
     
     Indeed, gelatin breaks down quite easily when boiled. Moreover, if it 
     has already set and you want to remelt it, it will not set.  One way I 
     have used gelatin in yeast growth medium in the lab is to microwave 
     the gelatin solution for roughly 5 minutes.  Microwaving is ideal for 
     sterilization as it kills microorganisms and even spores rapidly, 
     without the side-effect of long-term heating (which not only breaks 
     down the gelatin, but also destrys many heat-labile labile vitamins).  
     Unfortunately, this process requires a microwave oven, which are 
     fairly ubiquitous in the States.  One other note if you microwave:  
     kepp an eye on you heated solutions during the microwaving as they can 
     often froth over.  To remedy, simply stop the microwave oven when you 
     see the froth rising, let the solution sit for a minute or two, and 
     then continue.

Subject: low and no alcohol beers


  
There has been some talk on the digest about producing alcohol free beers at
home. The problem with distilling off the alcohol is that the aroma compounds
in your beer will also be removed as azeotropes with the water-ethanol you
distill from the beer. Commercial breweries use semi-permeable membranes to
remove the alcohol, but these are not 100% effective and some flavor components
are also lost. In the US, some of these components are replaced with synthetic
flavor additives. Here in Germany, this is "verboten" by the Rheinheitsgebot.
Some researchers at the University of Dortmund have found a way around this by
inventing a process to selectively remove the flavor components from a beer.
The beer is then dialysed to remove the alcohol, and the original flavor
components readded to the beer.
  
Basically, the beer is passed through a column containing an adsorber resin.
This resin is made up of highly porous polystyrene beads with a very large
surface area. The flavor compounds in the beer adsorb onto the surface of the
resin and are concentrated there.
  
The alcohol is then removed from the treated beer, either by dialysis or
perhaps by vacuum distillation.
  
A small amount of this alcohol is then used to elute (i.e. wash) the flavor
compounds from the surface of the adsorber resin. This concentrated "essence of
beer" is then added to the alcohol-free beer.
  
The result: Flavorful, very low alcohol beer according to the Rheinheitsgebot.
  
Adsorber resins are available from the major producers of ion-exchange resins
for those interested in trying this. E-mail me for more information.

  I could not agree more. Recently, I judged stouts at a fairly large regional
competition. There were 12 beers in the flight, *7* of which were so dark
they were absolutely impermeable to light. All seven of those beers had that
unmistakable burnt, acidic, harsh flavor from black patent malt, which
dominated and detracted from the flavor profiles of the beers.
  After the flight, I discussed this with one of the other judges on the panel.
The style guidelines for dry stout read "Black, opaque..." when describing
the color, I think brewers read the word "black" and conclude that large
amounts of black patent malt should be used. As Dave so rightly points out,
black patent has a very strong flavor, and can easily dominate the flavor
of even assertively flavored beers like porters and stouts.

  A dry stout should have a significant roasted barley character, the recipes
I've seen and brewed successfully typically call for a pound in a 5 gallon
batch. I also use some high Lovibond crystal and a bit of chocolate malt as
well. Any beer with that much roasted barley and some chocolate malt will be
quite dark as it is, *very little* black patent is required to achieve the
black, opaque effect. I use 1/2 cup of BP, which is roughly 1/8# in a 5
gallon batch, the beer comes out black as ink, and has the requisite roasted 
malt flavor without the burnt, acidic harshness. I second Dave's advice,
go easy on the black patent.

Oh, BTW.  Several posters have mentioned using the "get" command to

Ian, liquid yeast cultures have made a large impact on the quality of my
beer, high temperature ferments or not.  I believe I know of a couple of
yeasts from Wyeast that would perform well a bit warmer.  One is the Belgian
White yeast, which I believe would be a fine yeast for other Belgian styles,
and even some not-so-Belgian styles.  It seemed to just hang in there for me
in the range of 66-68F (19-20C) - I believe it would work well in the mid
20s C, maybe much warmer.  Also, the Wyeast London ESB yeast really is
unhappy (drops out of solution) in the low 60s F, so I'm guessing it would
prefer warmer climes.  An obvious guess would also be the Wyeast American Ale
yeast, which is a very clean fermenter.  I suspect it will throw some
interesting esters at hotter temps but would remain cleaner than most yeasts.


BTW, you can also try a simple water bath for your fermenter (bucket in a
bucket approach) with some cloth draped over the fermenter into the water.
Evaporative cooling is an amazing thing if your climate is dry enough.  Good
luck.

Jim, they don't dry hop SNPA.  Also, I disagree that we homebrewers can't get

gzip is an excellent compression utility, but unless the .z files in question
were misnamed/renamed, gzip'ed files will have a .gz extension.
 
Files with a .z extension are compressed with the 'pack' utility, as opposed
to .Z files which are compressed with the unix 'compress' utility. Both
utilities have their advantages which I will not elaborate on in this forum.
gzip has about the best compression ratio of the three, and that is what I
generally use.
 
However - the gunzip utility *will* decompress both .z and .Z files. 


In the end, I suppose people would get gunzip and uncompress .z files and it 
would work just fine, but I needed to point out that .z files were not 
originally compressed with gzip. Thanks for your patience.
 
So yeah, grab gzip. GNU rules !

Subject: Question about a Counter-flow Chiller, HBD Subscription


Hi,


        I have just completed my counter-flow wort chiller.  It was very 
easy to construct and cost around $30.  It is of the copper-tubing-inside 
 -of-a-garden-hose variety.  It uses 25 feet of 3/8" copper and 22 feet of 
5/8" garden hose.  The fittings were made with Y shaped garden hose 
splitters, a 3/4" hose to 1/2" pipe adaptor, and a 1/2" pipe to 3/8" 
compression fitting which seals around the copper tubing.  For anyone who 
would like more detailed plans, please e-mail me.
        My question involves what sort of tubing to use as an input line 
to the chiller.  Eventually, I would like to plumb the chiller directly 
into a valve on the bottom of my 10 gallon pot; however, I have not had 
a chance to have this valve welded yet.  So, in the meantime, what do 
others use for input tubing?  The tubing I am using now is proline 
tubing from the local hardware store (tasteless, odorless, FDA approved) 
and works great for siphoning and kegging, but I can't find any 
information about it's temperature rating.  I would appreciate any ideas.  


        My other point was about the automated subscription drops I read 
about in a previous digest (I think yesterday's).  I am a dedicated 
reader of the digest, but I post very infrequently.  However, I do 
respond to many questions through private e-mail.  It seems as if there 
should be some way to periodically check if people like me still want to
be subscribed before we are cut off.

Subject: more on clear glass


 Thanks to all who responded here and privately to my question concerning
clear glass and mead.  Overwhelmingly the responses state that clear glass
and mead go well together.  It was interesting to learn that many folks
usually fill one clear bottle with beer at bottling time, just so they can
easily observe what is happening to their batch as it resides in bottles.
 Others place a clear bottle of brew on shelves with those from previous
batches for side by side comparisons of color and also for simple visual
enjoyment.
 Today I'm preparing to rack a batch of Cream Ale from plastic fermenter to
glass secondary and it strikes me that I usually work in a somewhat sunny
kitchen and the carboy is clear glass.  I understand lots of folks brew
outdoors (I hope to get there one day!) and they, like me, often use a glass
primary - likely also clear.  Are we putting the whole batch in jeopardy of
being sunstruck while it is concentrated in this one big clear bottle?  Would
a shift to brown glass carboys  contribute to quality?  Would it make sense
to consider using some kind of carboy coating or a cover to keep the light
out?

     My first post! I'm so proud. Let's hope I don't foul it up. I
     suppose with the robot watching our every move, us lurkers are an
     endangered species. Which allows me to segue into topic one. It
     seems to me that cleaning up the mail list could be easily done
     using periodic "are you still there and interested" messages. If
     no response or bounced, give 'em the hook. Pressuring folks into
     making submissions to stay on the list will result in all sorts
     of innane drivel. (Like this, right?) Soapboxing complete.


     I noticed a question about a week ago regarding how to tell if a
     plastic bucket is indeed food grade. Either I slept through the
     response or there wasn't one. I'd like to repeat it and beg the
     indulgence of the group if I indeed did sleep through it.


     Question two: Is there any significant difference between the 12
     oz brown bottles available at your local Home Brew store and
     those that Sam Adams comes in? I've been soaking the labels off
     and having at it with those.


     Question three: I've seen some comments here and there about hops
     from Boston Brewing, I'm afraid I missed the boat on this one.
     What is (or was) the deal? How can I get in on it and is it worth
     bothering with?


     Private Email works for any of the above questions if you see
     fit. And the address is DWILSON3`at`email.usps.gov. I await the
     collective wisdom.

        I have been considering buying some oxygen barrier caps for botting
some barleywine and mead, since I expect to keep these bottles around in 
storage for some time and would like to prevent oxidation.  I would be 
interested in knowing:


        - How do these caps work?
        - Do they really work and are they worth using for long-term storage?
        - What is the proper means of sanitizing these caps?
