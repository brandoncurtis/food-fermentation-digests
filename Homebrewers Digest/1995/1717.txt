    I also ferment in a sunny kitchen under a "breakfast island" 
(much to my wifes disapproval :).  Until about 4 batches ago, I would 
just put the beer into the fermenter, set it under the island and 
letigo.  I kept getting an off flavor in my beer that I didn't like, 
and had already checked all of my sanitation methods, then I thought 
about the 'lightstruck' scenario....My remedy costs about $.01...a trash 
bag with a hole cut in the bottom, over the top of the carboy.
   This works great in the winter, but in the summer...Black attracts 
heat...so put the carboy in your bottling bucket with some water and 
lay a towel over the top, draping it into the water for evaporation 
cooling!  nature is great!!! ... almost like she intended for us to 
make beer!!

Subject: infection follow-up


Thanks to all who responded to my questions in Hombrew Digest #1713 regarding
infections and gelatin. What follows is a consensus/majority rule of the
responses to my questions...


A--Is the ring around the neck a sign of infection or could it be gelatin 
   solidifying at the surface?


        The likely cause of this happening was priming with DME. The material
        on the neck was hot break/cold break materials from using malt extract
        instead of priming sugar or honey.


B--Is it too early in the bottle (only 1 week) for the gelatin to set into a 
   film on the bottom?


        BY ALL MEANS YES!!! As matter of fact the majority of respondents
        could not figure out why I even used gelatin at the time of bottling.
        In all honesty I read it in a thread on the Beer & Brewing section of
        the Wine & Dine forum on AOL. I cannot remember who the info came
        from, but the mere mention of using gelatin at bottling time got many
        raised eyebrows!!!


C--What in the world is that pungent odor (it is not strong or immediately 
   apparent, only after sniffing the beer can you tell it is there)?


        This was the one question that got a lot of conflicting responses.
        It was either infection, the DME fermenting or the gelatin. I came up
        with my own opinion from the responses and decided that it was a 
        combination of the fermenting DME AND the gelatin. The reason for this
        was that last night I tried several more bottles of the Turtle's Wheat
        and the pungent smell had all but disappeared. Also I had a signifi-
        cant decrease in the material floating at the top of the bottles (and
        in my mug after pouring).


Thanks to everyone who responded to my queries. (Boy folks just what till I
start doing all grain brewing... oh the questions I have!!!  ;)

Subject: Microwave for sterilization/PureSeal bottlecaps


Irwin writes:

>without the side-effect of long-term heating...


Are you absolutely sure?  I've read various things about microwaves
and sanitation/sterilization, but none of them definitive.  Could
someone else support or deny Irwin's claim?


***
Andy writes (asking about PureSeal (aka SmartCaps) bottlecaps):


        - How do these caps work?


There are several varieties ("absorber" and at least one other kind) but
I'm only familiar with the "absorber" variety, so that's all I'll talk
about here.  Their plastic lining is made of a special plastic which absorbs
oxygen in the headspace AND the plastic is oxygen-barrier for (I believe)
nine months.  I have read somewhere that the plastic contains sulphites
and this is the mechanism by which the oxygen absorbtion is done.  The
absorbing capabilities are activated by moisture so the caps should be
bought in sealed plastic packages and stored dry.


        - Do they really work and are they worth using for long-term storage?


The Chicago Beer Society did a test comparing these caps with regular ones.
The primary difference was that the absorber capped beer had a better hop
aroma than the regular capped beer.  I have been using these caps exclusively
and have entered some relatively medium-gravity beers into competitions up
to two years after bottling with no mention of oxidation on the scoresheets.
Perhaps this is due to the caps or maybe just good technique keeping O2 out
of the bottle in the first place.  My opinion: even if they don't make a
significant difference, how much more per batch do they cost, 50 cents?


        - What is the proper means of sanitizing these caps?


I spoke with the lead engineer who designed them and he said that boiling
them will ruin their absorbing capabilities.  He recommended using 200ppm
bleach (1 tablespoon per gallon of cool water) and then rinsing with water.
That's what I've been doing.  I'm afraid that the oxygen in B-Brite and
One-Step might "use up" some of the oxygen absorbing capabilities, so I
choose to avoid using that stuff for the caps.  I've also tried iodophor,
but when I put the caps into the iodophor, its amber colour disappeared
immediately, so I tossed those caps and went back to good old 200ppm bleach.

Subject: sparging with boiling water


Just a few notes on my sparge from last weekend.


I use a Gott cooler as a hot liquor tank and mash in a converted 
pony keg.  I bring my sparge water to a boil and then drain it 
into the pre-warmed cooler and seal it.  I figure the water in the
cooler is probably 200F tops.  Last weekend I brought my mash
to about 165 and then started sparging.  With my digital 
thermometer in the grain bed, I watched the temperature climb
from 165 to 175 as I sparged (took 35 to 45 min). 


I hate to say it, but I think this is similar to what Jack was
advocating a while back and it works well for me.  I got

In reply to Sean O'Keefe's posting:
I have dry hopped with the SA hops once and had favorable results.  The hop
aroma and taste was what I was after- comparable with SA's beer.  I also tried
making a hop tea using the same recipe with very different results.  I threw in
 some hops (about 1 oz) at the end of the boil of the corn sugar just prior to
bottling.  The best way to describe the flavor was grassy.  After about 5 weeks
 in the bottle the "grassiness has disappeared and it has a hint of fruity
bouqet.  One of my friends who is always willing to sample my batches liked the
 hop tea version, where I preferred the dry hopped - to each his own.  FWIW: I
have also received 2 - 400 gram bags for the price of one as someone else a
month or so ago posted.

Kirk Harralson wote that an alternative to na beers might be a low

Kirk,


The reasons that I wanted some knowledge of how to make a non alcoholic
beer was not for the calorie content. (Though it maybe it should have
been for my husband's sake! <G>) But what I really needed was a VERY low
alcoholic content for my son's. They've tasted our homebrew and LOVE it
and wanted to know if I could make a na version for them. I guess
O'Douls just can't compete with the taste of mom's. :) I'm just hoping
the na is possible...have you PRICED na in the stores lately?????!

Sounds like it's going fine to me Tom !  I brew British Ales and use an 'open'
fermentation method.  Basically, the bucket is loosely covered with the lid
until the fermentation takes hold then it is removed completely !  I don't
brew Lagers or Wheat beers so don't know whether this is feasible with a
bottom fermenting yeast.  In any case, I would never seal the beer in until
the primary (vigorous) fermentation has finished.  With a good, top fermenting
yeast this would be after 2-3 days. 


It doesn't sound like the batch has been ruined, so I should just stick it out
and wait !!

Subject: Gelatine !!!




I'd just like to stick my oar into the Gelatine debate.


I don't see why you need to use it at all !!


I have used galatine in the past but the only real difference is that it
tends to clear a bit quicker.  Since I condition all of my beers for a minimum
period of 6-8 weeks, the beer is well cleared by then anyway.  Why do you
lot use it ?  I'm sure there is a very good reason and I'd love to know. 


I generally use Irish Moss in the boil and the yeasts I use are normally stolen
from bottle conditioned ales (such as Sheppherd Neame, Fullers etc.) and
settle down quickly and firmly of their own accord.  All of my beers come out
crystal clear and I make the whole range, from Pale Ale to Stout so why use
Gelatin ?  I've heard that it can actually take some of the flavour out of the
beer (although I don't know how true this is).


I was recently touring a micro brewery in England (Crouch Vale in Essex) and
noticed that they had big containers full of 'Liquid Finings'.  I wish now
that I'd asked them a few questions about it !

Troy, we used to get porcelain repair at the hardware store in a

a test run with water and a little vinegar (to simulate the lower pH 
of the wort) in a good rolling boil to see if it will hold up.


The open part can cause flavors from the iron (steel) to affect your

I don't see why I have to have a sense of humor to keep from getting dropped
from the Digest.  I regard this as entirely unfair.  Not only that, I don't
believe the Robot itself probably has much of a sense of humor, because to
me, a sense of humor is a uniquely human phenomenon, not shared by machines
no matter how intelligent they may be.  Humor is real intelligence, not
artificial intelligence, which is humorless.  I have never seen a robot
that can get a truly funny joke.  The more I think about this humorless Robot 
dropping me because maybe it doesn't understand my form of humor the madder I 
get.  Not only that, but I think the Robot should drop anyone who persists
in continuing this stupid thread.


On another front, I am ending the design stage of my stovetop system based
on 2 five-gallon pots.  I am planning to recirculate not only the mash but
also the wort at end of boil and during cooling.  I think there may be big
advantages.  Send me a note if you would like to discuss this further in
private.


The HBD has been invaluable to me in my planning.


Finally, here is my Baroque Worry, and I'm sorry to say I'm not joking here.
As I cool my boiled wort, it will contract, causing kitchen air to be drawn
into the boiling vessel.  The kitchen air will be laden with germ-carrying
dust particles.  Tell me then, can I prevent this somehow?  Please don't just
suggest that I not worry about this; I have already suggested that to myself,
to no avail.  Does anyone else have this concern?

Subject:       siphon aeration / cap sterilization / light-struck carboys


Just a few quick comments on HBD#1715:


#1)        Martin Manning warned that placing a hole in a siphon tube at an elevation
above the bottom of the source vessel will cause the siphon to be broken when 
the level of the wort is lowered to the same elevation.  This is true, but ONLY
if your hole(s) are too large or too many.  If you make the hole(s) small 
enough so that a stream of tiny bubbles are sucked into the racking tube, the 
pressure inside the tube will always remain below atmospheric pressure and the 
siphon will not be broken.  You also get a better aeration efficiency (IMHO) 
with smaller bubbles because of the greater surface area/volume ratio of the 
bubbles. So keep the hole small enough that air can't be sucked in so quickly 
that the siphon is broken and you can place the hole anywhere you want! (Tip:  
Place a hose clip or C-clamp on the hose at the location of the hole(s).  This 
will help pinch open the small holes and also may assist in the pressure drop 
due to the decreased diameter of the tube [Venturi? / Bernoulli?])


#2)        John Schmitz asked about methods for cap sterilization.  Some people swear 
by boiling them, but I've heard of the heat un-seating the rubber ring in the 
cap on occasions.  I B-Brite mine.


#3)        There was another question (from John Grivetti?) about how to protect a 
carboy from being light struck.  Forget any special coatings!  Just take a 
brown paper bag, turn it up-side-down, and cut a small circle in the bottom 
(now the top) for the neck of the carboy to fit through.  Drop it on the 
carboy!

For me, i do 10 gals in about 5 hrs.  5 gal batches are 4.5 hrs.
mill grains/heat mash h20: 30 mins
mash: 60-75mins, start heating sparge h20 at end of mash, say, at 60mins
sparge 45 mins in GOTT.
boil 60-75 mins
chill 25 mins(10-12gals).
pitch/measure SG 5 mins


I mash/sparge in a 10 gal gott.
i heat water/boil using a 200k btu king kooker.
i ferment right in my boiler, so, no hassle with sterilizing/cleaning crap.
concurrency helps: by the time the wort is coming to a boil, i have just
about all the mashing / sparging things cleaned.  when it is time to end
the boil, i put the chiller in, boil another 5mins, kill the heat, and
chill.  at that point, i have NOTHING to clean... just pitch, and cover.

I recently brewed an all grain  wheat beer that turned
out really well!  It has a great clove-like flavor, nice color, 
and a creamy head. (I was really amazed that I brewed this!).
We had a party at my house last week and we chilled a case
of these in the fridge.  They were great at the party but the
leftover beers in the fridge changed dramatically over the 
next two days.  The foamy head was gone and the clove flavor
diminished too!  Although it still tasted better than coors I am
really puzzeled at this change.  The other cases that were not
refrigerated taste as good as the first one I opened and have 
good head retention.  Could this be that the hefe was still active
enough to be destroyed by chilling? If so why would the entire
character of the beer change and not just the head?
Could some of you more advanced brewers help me out?!!

Hello all about a week ago matthewk`at`csd.uwm.edu ask for any good bad
info on the Easy Masher. At that time I had just picked up one from a
local HB shop hear in Denver and used it for the first time last week
and found it to work very well. This was my first all grain batch. I did
a 2.5 gallon batch I dont have any thing bigger than a 5 gallon pot.
        REVER CITY RED
        3 LBS 2-ROW
      1/2 LBS MUNIC MALT
      1/2 LBS WHEAT MALT
      1/4 CHOCOLATE MALT
      1/2 CRYSTAL MALT 40L
      1/4 OZ CHALLENGER HOPS
      1/4 OZ CONTINENTAL HOPS
      1/4 OZ TETTNANGER HOPS
      AMERICAN ALE YEAST
The procedure I did was:
Step Mash
        30 minutes at 122 degrees
        30 minutes at 153 degrees did iodine test passed
        10 minutes at 170 degrees
Sparged with 170 water now this is the part I not sure about and have
the some qustions about.
        After clearing the runoff I brought a pot of water to 170 F and siphoned
        water into a bowl on top of the grain bed using fish tank tubing
        and did this intell run off did not taste sweet. This only took
        15 mins I got 3 gallons of wort. Is this spraging to fast?.
        The start gravity was at 1.056 I was real happy about that and
        figured that all went well. It is now at 1.006 but it taste like
        wet grains. I will bottle it and let it condition and see what
        happens. This was going to be a red ale but it seems that the
        chocolate malt and crystal malt made it a Black Tar Ale and I do
        mean BLACK! I cant hardley see thew it. Was this just to
        much chocolate malt?.
After using the Easy Masher I could say I am real happy with it and will
use it for my extract brewing as well the screen works real good for
filting the hops at racking time. I have no relations with the Easy
Masher just a very happy customer.


PS the AI robot was a joke so I have been told however I to was going to
send a message like Daves he just beat me to it. Kirk maybe you should
put at the end THIS IS ONLY A JOKE I can see that we are not the only
ones that took it as the truth. Oh by the way I too enjoy a joke as
well :^).

Hi Friends,


My post a couple days ago regarding extraction efficiency for a first mash got
me wondering about the Nominal values I quoted. These were 30 pts/lb/gal for 2
Row Base Malt and 10 for Crystal 60. My source for these numbers came from a
Brewing Techniques (M/J '93), Brewer's Forum article by Karl King and he
sourced Noonan, Mosher and Bauer. Here are the numbers from that article:


Malt           Pts/Lb/Gal
- -----          ----------
Pale Malt                30
Dextrin                  20
Crystal 20               15
Crystal 40               12.5
Crystal 60               10
Wheat                    25
Vienna                   23.5
Munich Light             20
Munich Dark              18
Cara Pils                20
Cara Vienne              15
Special B                 5
Chocolate                 3
Roasted Barley            1
Black Patent              0


I use these degrees of extract in a spreadsheet program to calculate my OG for
a new recipe based on the lbs of each malt used and the volume of my recipe.
My Doubts about these numbers surfaced yesterday when I was looking at Malt
Spec. sheets with Mike Froehlich over at his homebrew shop.  Those spec. sheets
quoted the % Percent extract for various malts as ranging from 60-75% by
weight. Roast Barley being 65%. This was confusing as I would not expect this
kind of unmalted "charcoal" to contribute any fermentables that would raise the
OG.
I went home and pulled another copy of BT which had another recipe formulation
article by Martin Manning, and in it he quoted a formula that converted these
percent extractions to specific gravity:


SG = %E x lbs x 46.31 / volume; which means for 1 lb/gal you multiply the %E by
46.31. I am not sure of the source of that constant. 


What this tells me is that 1 lb of Roasted Barley in 1 gallon of water would
raise the OG by ~28 pts!  I don't think so!!  Am I missing something here?


I have had good success using the numbers quoted above and it occurs to me that
they may in fact be adjustments made by figuring a 90% mash/lauter efficiency.
Would those of you who understand these spec. sheets please comment?  I would
like to understand the discrepancies and any fudge factors before I write about
this again.


Also, I understand that there are similar %E numbers published in some of the
brewing freeware and shareware, but since those are Unix and DOS programs and I
am a Mac user, I have never seen them. How close to your target OG do you get
when using these programs? Do they have fudge factors built in?

Subject: A Hydrometer Question


Well, lest another mostly-lurker get caught by the unsubscribe robot <G>, I
figured now was the time to post one of those questions that's been waiting
for just such an opportunity.


I was reading some back HBD's and in HBD #1704, I happened to see:


> Paul Shallbetter
> pshallbe`at`faribault.polaristel.net
> "Can ANYBODY help me find a hydrometer I CAN READ!?"


And this brought to mind a question I've had for a while that perhaps some
of our chemistry or physics type people can answer.


It's my hydrometer - here's the situation, the question, and the followup
question.My hydrometer, one of the basic homebrew store type - half inch
(or so) diameter bulb, with rolled up paper in the neck, and no built-in
thermometer - came in a plastic tube, one end closed and one end capped,
about 3/4 to 1 inch in diameter, and about half an inch taller than the
hydrometer.  This is what I used to take my readings. Standard procedure:
fill the tube to a predetermined level with wort in some stage, so that
with hydrometer inserted I'll still have about half an inch before the wort
overflows the tube; gently insert the hydrometer to right around where I
expect the gravity to be, and spin gently and let go.  Sure enough, the
hydrometer spins and slows down, and stabilizes at the gravity, and then
(and here comes the problem), just before the hydrometer stops spinning, it
sort of sallies over to the edge of the tube, and neck of the hydrometer
seems to almost magically attach itself to the side of the tube, with a
little wort between the tube wall and the neck of the hydrometer rising in
a small 'mound' above the surface of the rest of the wort (No, I'm not
going to attempt ascii graphics of the whole thing here ;-)).  In the
process of 'becoming affixed', the hydrometer rises a few points - leading
me to try again.


Here's the question - why does my hydrometer love the wall of it's tube
home? Surface tension? Inter-molecular translocation? Karma? And possibily
more relavent - how can I make it stop.


Thanks, and now, as Bob often say - go have a beer.


ciao,

Andy Kligerman asked about the relative effectiveness of brown vs green 
bottles at filtering light from beer.  Another poster whose name I did not 
save, sorry for the slight, quoted Zymurgy article putting the effectiveness 
at filtering light at about 96% for brown and 20% for green.  When I bottle 
I line my hard cardboard cases with black plastic lawn bags that are cut 
open per CP.  Once the bottles are in the case I then line the top of the 
cases and put them in a closet to finish.  I assume I am reducing my mess 
potential from beer fireworks and also eliminating the concern for light.  I 
am more concerned for the heft of the bottles as Molson and other green 
bottles seem less heavy that Bud and Miller Lite bottles (at least they do 
that right).  Am I off base here.  As a new brewer I have considered other 
things I have done to be insightful and creative only to find that I have

Subject: Opps.


Hi. First, I like the HBD and all the information I get.  This is my first
post and I just thought I'd try to help someone learn from my mistake.


I brewed an english style bitter, and racked it to 5 liter kegs.  Well even
though I had done this before, I filled the kegs to capacity rather than
leaving enough room at the top.  


The results (as if you couldn't guess yourself): My once cylyndrical kegs
look like beer balls and you can shave with the foam that came out when I
managed to wrestle the tap into it.  At least the bungs didn't blow (I'm sure

floor).


Anyway. I hope my next post is as interesting as most of the other stuff I

p.s. If you let the bitter sit in the glass for a while, it still tastes
good!

Tom:
Your beer should be fine. In the future the best remedy would be to use a
carboy and get a blowoff tube (1 1/8" dia) wich fits tight in the neck. The
other end goes in a container of water. A gallon milk jug works great
because the hose fits tight in the neck also.(put hole for air to escape in
handle) This hose will carry the Krausen(foamy stuff) away from your brew
along with removing some bitter tannins, giving you a "smoother" beer. This
should also keep you from blowing your top. Brew On!!

   Its nearing the end of winter, the scurvy dog Coyote should be coming out
  of hibernation any time soon, and raiding the local breweries, Be sure to
  lock up your grain koops, Soon his howling sill be heard, and all will be
  well.

Thank you one and all who answered my question regarding the color wheel. 
I've received 20 responses so far and they all seem to point to Dennis 
Davison's index card size slide with various colored films on it. I guess 
I'll be getting another toy for brewing soon. Just don't tell my wife :)


        Thanks again
        DR J (Just another happy homebrewer!)
