Hi,


I have just found out where I can get some stainless steel kegs for a
relatively cheap price. But how do know if they are really stainless steel?
Someone mentioned before that some kegs will have a 304 on them, meaning 304
alloy or something like that. Any info would be greatly appreciated!

Subject: dry hop with pellets




A question for the collective wisdom:


I'm exclusively an ale brewer and a self-confirmed hop head.  I dry
hop most of my beers and until recently have used only whole hops.
However, I prefer the convenience of pellets and so on my latest
effort I tried dry hopping with 1 oz of pellets.  I had read about
the difficulties of keeping the hop residue out of the bottles but thought
I'd give it a go anyway.  


Well, I did end up with a lot of hop *junk* in my bottles (which isn't
a major problem, it just looks bad; you don't think my beer is
ruined do you?  Should I throw it out? ;->)  Anyway, I was wondering
how one might get around this problem.  I guess a standard hop
bag has holes which are too big to hold in the pelletized hop bits.
I was thinking of tying the pellets in a piece of cheesecloth
(or perhaps old underwear) instead of a hop bag.  Any thoughts on
this?  What about using a coffee filter (No. 4 cone) the same way?
Do any of you pellet users have nifty solution?


Thanks for listening,

In HBD #1718 Ray Robert <rayr`at`bah.com> asks:
>
>I am getting ready to keg for the first time and had a question about 
>kegging and bottling.  I would like to keep a few bottles around for 
>friends, parties etc. but I want to keg the majority of the beer.  My

>
I would recommend priming the entire batch for the keg (1/3 to 1/2 cup corn
sugar?), then siphon as much as you want into the keg. Then add any
additional priming sugar reduced by the portion of sugar already added and
the portion of the beer put into the keg.


For example, assume a priming rate of 1/2 cup for 5 gal. keg beer, 3/4 cup
for 5 gal. bottled beer and half is to be kegged and the other half bottled.
You would add your 1/2 cup to the entire 5 gal. and siphon 2.5 gal. into the
keg. You would then need to add 1/8 cup (3/4 cup desired rate - 1/2 cup
already in * 1/2 batch) more priming sugar to the remaining 2.5 gal. before
you start bottling.


>Another question I have is how much to prime (if any) if I were to force 
>carbonate?


No need to prime at all if you are force carbonating.


>Also which is better force carbonation or natural (i.e. 
>priming)?  I am in no great hurry so I was going to go with the natural 
>process.  Inquiring minds want to know.
>


Natural carbonation seems to have a denser and longer lasting head with
smaller bubbles than the same beer force carbonated. You also lose out on
being able to prime with aromatic flavoring additives such as honey,
molasses, maple syrup, etc. when force carbonating. You can't beat the speed
to glass however.

Funny you should say that...  I just kegged a batch of generic ale
that has 1/2 Oz Brewers Gold for bittering and 1/2 OZ of the SA hops
for flavor and I have the same earthy taste.  The yeast, by the way
was the Wyeast European Ale, and the grain was M&F pale ale malt.


Anybody else having the same problem that Sean and I did?

>Have no instructions on sanitizing wooden bungs.
We (Kalamazoo Brewing) use Hoff Stevens kegs that use wooden bungs. There is
really no need to sanitize them. They are packed clean, and supposedly
sanitary.
Remember your beer is done ie contains alcohol  has a lower ph, and much less
sugar; it is much less vulnerable to infection. If you worry too much soak
your bug in sulfite for a minute or so. Don't soak it too long though you
don't want to swell it before you bung your keg.
Most homebrewers worry way too much about sanitation.

  Has anyone tried to use a foam filter for an aquarium power filter.  I have
the AQUAClear 300 and the foam filter is very large.  I would cut a small
hole and stick the siphon tube in it.  You would probably have to dispose of
it after one use, but they cost anywhere from $.59 to $1.19 (depending on
size) from That Fish Place at 1-800-733-3829.  Most of these filters are
designed to filter at pretty good flow rates.

Subject: AD:(sort of) Seed Barley


I wanted to plant barley in my garden this year, so I called and called and 
found someone who had seed for Robust and Morex barley. I ended up with a 
bushel and a peck. It's sitting on my porch, and my wife is not amused.
So...
If anyone wants to plant a patch of barley in their garden this year, say 
one square meter, (that's one square yard to the layman) send me a buck and 
I'd be happy to mail you some seed. According to my source, the seed rate 
is about 2 bushels/acre. This breaks down to 30ml/meter*meter. (about 1/8 
cup)  Normal yield for these seeds is 30-40 bushels/acre, so you won't get 
enough to brew with unless you're making a B*dw**ser clone. :-) The seed is 
not treated. This offer good until my wife loses her patience.

Subject: Copper boiling kettle


I was in a Corning/Revere factory outlet today and saw a 13 gallon copper
"clothes boiling kettle" on sale for about $75.  It reminded me of an old
kettle my grandma used to have back before indoor plumbing and electricity.<g>
  It is oblong in shape.  I didn't take measurements but I figure it is about
30 inches by 18 inches and maybe 18 inches high.  The figures might be off
but the capacity is stated on the label.  The bottom seemed to be
welded/brazed/soldered (I don't know the proper term) to the sides.  I asked
the clerk (a part time college student) if it was food grade and she looked
at me like I was nuts.


This thing would probably span two burners on a typical stove and would seem
to be a neat and less expensive alternative to a large stainless or enameled p
ot.  I'm pretty sure it comes with a top as well.


Does anyone have any insight to this kind of pot?  Is it likely that the
joint is safe?  Comments from the mettalurgists in the family?  Would the
dual heat source (using two burners) cause any problems?  I can't think of
any.  Might be tough using an imersion chiller, though.  Stirring would
probably be a must.  I'm also not too sure how sturdy it would be when full
of wort.  It had handles on both ends (along the long axis) but seemed a bit
flimsy.


Even if this isn't any good for beer, it certainly would add some nostalgic
charm aside a fireplace.


Comments would be welcome.

Subject: Incomplete fermentations


After many successful all-grain Pale Ale batches, my last two
fermentations have "stuck"!


#1   11 lb Pale
     1.5 lb 60L
     Wyeast #1056
     Single infusion mash `at` 157F
     OG= 1.059
     << FG= 1.032 >> !!!
- ---------------------
#2   9 lb Pale
     1 lb 40L
     .5 lb 10L munich
     .5 lb wheat malt
     Wyeast #1056
     Single infustion mash `at` 155F
     OG= 1.052
     << FG= 1.037 >> (after 7 days in primary) !!


Both batches appeared normal during the primary fermentation. 
They were active with continual bubbling through the airlock.  
I use a pint of Wyeast starter.


Batch #2 did NOT have a layer of yeast in the carboy bottom
after racking to the secondary!  This surprised me.  Usually
there is quite a bit of yeast sediment.  The beers taste FINE,
but a bit sweet.  


Ideas:  My thermometer could be miscalibrated and I'm mashing
        too warm.


        I didn't check the true mash temp inside the GOTT
        during the mash, I just add the same amount of 170F
        water as worked successfully in previous batches.  So I
        COULD be mashing at too high a temperature.  But that
        wouldn't explain the lack of settled yeast in the
        primary of batch #2 would it? (I carried the carboy
        downstairs about 24 hrs before racking but didn't shake
        it much).  It also wouldn't explain my previous
        successful similar (pale ale) batches that fermented
        out to 1.012, 1.015, 1.018, etc.
        
        Infection?  Both batches taste fine...
        
I've kegged batch #1 and am drinking it.  Batch #2 is in the
secondary, and I would like to "fix" it if possible.  


Could someone suggest what I might do to diagnose this problem?
I would appreciate any ideas you have of what might be wrong
here.  Thanks!

Subject: Open Fermentation


Okay, the results are in.  The last 8 batches of beer I've done have each
been fermented in a 3 gallon stone crock.  During the entire fermentation in
each case I've kept the crock covered with a dinner plate.  The crock has a
1:1 aspect ratio, or at least the beer contained therein does.  I want to
thank Jim Busch in particular for inspiring me to try this--it's been a MUCH
more enjoyable brewing experience than has the use of the glass, airlocked
carboy.  I can get in and "muck" with the kraeusen, as Jim says, smell the
action, and hear the yeast doing their work.  A holistic brewing experience,
you might say.


I think everyone I've read msgs from who "open" ferments uses the technique
I first heard from Brain Gowland in the UK: to wit, they cover the vessel
only when yeast activity is low, then uncover during those times of big CO2
effluence.  Sure, this make sense from the standpoint of ensuring the
greatest protection of the yeast IF you want to uncover the fermenter. But...


Why uncover at all?  I use this fermenter because it was on hand and it
allows me to skim the residue off the foamy head.  I like that.  But I've
kept the crock covered with the dinner plate because I still don't want an
open invititation to airborne *anything*.  What benefit do you open ferment
enthusiasts see to doing a fully open-top ferment?  What exactly is the point?

Hi, there, just saw the posting about the "Good Times Virus."
 
THE GOOD TIMES VIRUS IS A HOAX.
 
The Department of Energy's Computer Incident Advosiry Capability
(CIAC) declared this to be a hoax in December of 1994, and has
recently issued a followup because of the resurgence of this urban

The HBD is not the place to discuss computer virii, but because of

Subject: Broken Bottles




Greetings!


I have amassed a collection of about 100+ bottles with which to bottle my
concoctions.  Last weekend I bottled my fourth batch, an old ale, and had
trouble with the necks of the bottles breaking.  This is only the second, at 




most third batch that has been put into these bottles (since I have so
many), and I'm wondering if this is normal.  I lost about 12-15 beers due to 




broken necked bottles.  In the previous three batches I had only lost a
total of two beers to broken necks.


My question, is it normal for these bottles to have such a low life-span?
 I'm using a double-winged bottle capper, should I invest in another capper
that isn't so rough on the necks?  It didn't seem like it was taking a whole 




lot of force to break the necks.


Private replies are more than welcome!  Thanks in advance,

Subject: RE: first decoction




Hi All,


In HBD#1718, Jeff Stampes writes about his first decoction mash:


>After
>30 minutes, I used a saucepan to ladle out 10 qts. of a relatively thick grist
>(calculations of dry and liquid volume showed this to be approx. 1/3 of the
>mash).  I heated this to 152F and held for 20 minues before bringing it to a
>boil.  After boiling 20 minutes, I returned it to the mash, hoping to strike
>152-155F.  I came in low,
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a common problem, one that's easily solved. Next time, pull 40%-50%
of the thickest portion for the first decoction, instead of the 1/3 that's
commonly recommended in the literature. This is especially important if you
mash in a cooler as Jeff does, and can't add heat to the tun easily. By 
pulling a larger fraction, you are much less likely to undershoot the sacc.
rest temperature when the decoction is added back to the rest mash. You
will likely have a little of the decocted mash left over when the desired
sacc. rest is attained. Simply cool the decocted mash to the same temp,
(it will cool very quickly), then add it back to the rest mash.


>so I simply pulled another 5 qt decoction, brought

Actually, I think decoct means "to remove", so technically this counts as
a decoction. This step won't be necessary if you pull 40%-50% for the
first thick decoction.


>All in all, the day was a little longer than my usual step-infusion mashes, but

Try a bock using double decoction instead. Hold your rest mash at 140F and
158F, and use a grain bill of ~80% German Munich malt. Do this, and you will
see the true benefits of decoction mashing.


>72 Hours after pitching, it went haywire on my.  I woke up in the middle of the

Mine too. I brewed an 11 gallon batch of dunkelweizen a week ago Saturday,
split it into two 6.5 gallon carboys. There was over 3 inches of headspace in
each carboy. For the first three days of fermentation, there was a nice,
normal 1" thick krausen. On the morning of day 4, both carboys suddenly
looked liked Mt. St. Helens. The headspace was completely filled with foam,
there was thick, gooey looking, foamy mess spewing from both airlocks. I
sanitized a couple of clean airlocks, replaced the filthy ones, and took them
upstairs to clean them. Five minutes later, when I returned to the basement,
the newly installed airlocks were also spewing forth!! I ended up covering 
the carboys with 1 gallon plastic bags, secured with rubber bands. When I
got home from work that night, the volcanoes had subsided somewhat, the
plastic bags were half filled with foam.


In 8 years and ~300 batches, I've never had a fermentation take off after 3
days of normal activity as this one did. I've also used Wyeast 3068 in the
past without this problem. I bought a fresh package this winter, it seems to
be associated with the cultures that were sold recently. Anyone know what's
going on here? Maybe if Dave Logsdon is reading this, he'd care to comment?


           Thanks,

Subject: What's fermenting?


Greetings!  Has this ever happened to you?  You make a nice 5 gal.
partial-mash batch of stout.  It ferments down to 1.020 from 1.051 and all
apparent fermentation in the primary has essentially stopped.  You dry hop
with 1 oz. of East Kent Goldings pellets in the
secondary glass carboy just for fun.  Two days later millions of tiny bubbles
start appearing in the beer and a lovely head forms in the neck of the
carboy.  After three weeks of observing these champagne-sized bubbles you
decide the batch got a wild yeast or some bacteria is now multiplying wildly
or something so you make another identical 5 gal batch. The first batch
doesn't smell or taste terrible but still . . .


The second batch reacts the same: Primary ferment goes to 1.020 with one
bubble in the airlock every 3 minutes or so.  Dry hop with 1 oz of EKG
pellets.  Two days later the tiny bubbles are back en masse along with a nice
head that my beer mug would envy!  This sort of bubbly action has never
happened in my beers before.  Sure, some fermentation continues after the
initial loss of CO2 by transferring to the secondary, but nothing like this.
 Could there be something in the hop pellets that would cause this?  Any wild
thoughts or related experience would be appreciated! 
Cheers,
Pat

Subject: Head formation


The subject of head formation came up a a recent beer club meeting.
I suggested various grains, mentioning proteins, etc.
Some one else suggested that the hops had something to do with it. 
I didn't want to call bull**** on this person in the middle of the meeting,
so I thought I'd do a short presentation on the subject at a later date to
set the record straight.
Imagine my surprise while in the midst of collecting/reviewing references, I
find a sentence or 2 in 'The New Complete Joy...' that says hops can affect
head !! That was news to me ( I must have overlooked it before- It has been
quite a while since i've TNCJOHB as my primary reference).
This is the only place I seen that mentions hops as having anything to do
with head formation/ retention, and it doesn't fit with everything else I
know about this.


Does anyone have any thoughts on this hops-head connection?


The only thing I could think of was a detrimental effect if the hops had tons
of oils.

Subject:  ALT BEER


Neophyte questions of the day:


1. I'm interested in making a German style ale - an altbier. Are
   alt beers typically fermented at warm temps for the first week
   and then racked to a 2ndary and then cold fermented for 1-2 weeks?
   If so what are typical ferment temps for both?


2. What is the general opinion on liquid extracts vs DME ? I
   bought some Ireks LME for my alt - has anyone had good or bad
   experiences?


 3. Any other suggestions or recipes for an alt beer would be greatly
    apreciated


Thanks for your help.

While I am certainly no "heavyweight" I hate seeing ads
on the HBD.  I have been aggressively targeted by ads 
since I was born and do not need the bull sh*t also on 
a NON-COMMERCIAL digest.  From what I understood by 
reading the digest policy note when I first subscribed,
was that commercialism is a no no.  I also read the HBD
will be policed by the masses (thats you and me).
So quit advertising!!!! There are plenty of other places
to advertise without exploiting a free service.




OK, enough of that.  


MYETTE`at`delphi.com asked about using oatmeal.  The oatmeal
I used in an oatmeal stout was quick oats from the bulk
food section of the grocery.  The beer turned out so 
good with the perfect amount of smooth oatmeal taste.
FYI I used around 10 oz. in a five gal. full mash batch.

After sending the original request out I received a good deal of very 
mixed feed back, thanks to all reviews good and bad!


Most of the input was quite negative overall. However when I considered 
input that referenced actual experience using the mill, it was mainly 
positive.


Based on further e-mail discussions with an owner/user I bought one($99 
for a new one in a damaged box).


I brewed my first batch with it this weekend and was thrilled by it's 
performance. I'm sorry I didn't actually time it but I estimate that I 
processed the 20 pounds of grain in 30 minutes or less. The other user  
I discussed this with quoted his throughput at 10 pounds in 13 minutes.


I'm used to using an adjustable Schmidling Malt Mill at a shop I used to 
buy malt and came close to matching that crush on the fly. Now I buy via 
internet `at` $49.50 for 55lbs 2 Row British Pale Ale Malt post-paid to my 
door.


So, I'm quite pleased with my setup and can give it 2 thumbs up since 
both hand are free during grinding.

Subject: Mash Temperature control.


Hello all, I am currently getting ready to try *All Grain* brewing 
(I have 24 extract batches under my belt) and have been tinkering with 
several ideas for equipment design.


I have been following the HBD for over a year and have accessed and read 
the info in the archives.  After serious efforts at relaxing and avoiding
worry while consuming home brew I have formulated the following design.


I propose to use a converted sanke keg (legal aquisition) with the top 
removed below the support ring and place a coil of copper tubing inside
the the walls of the keg.  I would then circulate boiling water through
this reverse heat exchanger from a second keg on a propane burner using
an electic pump.  Mash temperature would be maintained by duty cycling
the hot water pump.

               Drain                     ^^Burner^^


The design has been governed to some degree by the materials
that I already have on hand (I am an admitted junk collector and
already have a high temperature pump, not food grade, a source of 
3/8" copper tubing and a digital T/C readout with stainless probe
and digital control outputs).


I think this setup will provide good temperature control with
little danger of scorching the grains.  Even though I have
most of the parts on hand this project is still on the drawing
board and I welcome comments and suggestions from the 
HBD collective conciousness.  TIA!


I will post a summary on this project when finished and the first
few batches have been brewed.

I'm brewing 10+ gallons batches and use two Carboys. Until it gets 
warmer in New England and my basement warms up, I place the Carboys on 
my kitchen counter where they become welcome members of the family.


I place them side by side with a dark golf shirt over each. I further 
dress them up with a tie and place one arm over the shoulder of the 
other. A few months ago McDonalds was giving away Tasmanian Devil Mugs. 
I cut the bottoms out and place them over the air locks. 


It's utterly ridiculous looking and nobody complains about the space 
they occupy.

Yesterday I was searching the Library of Congress via Telnet (locis.loc.gov),
and decided to see
what was listed about brewing.  I was surprised to see that Dave Miller will
soon release a new
book:


Miller, David G., 1945-
  [Homebrewing guide]
  Dave Miller's homebrewing guide : everything you need to know to make
great-tasting beer /
Dave Miller.  Pownal, Vt. : Storey Communications, 1995.
PROJECTED PUBLICATION DATE: 9510
ISBN:  0882669052 (pbk.)
LCCN:  95-13385


I downloaded all of the book titles I could find on brewing, yeast, and hops.
 I is too large
(~110k) to post here, but I would be glad to pass along a copy to anyone who
is interested via
private E-Mail.

Fellow Homebrewers


     I want to thank you all for providing much appreciated and used
information on brewing. I need some help. I've never tried to figure (or
cared) what the OG of my brews should be. Last night I figured I would use
CP's formula in THBC as I had made some modifications to my tun and procured
the Whirlygig sparger. His formula is %extract/8.6 *lbs grain/Gal wort * 4 to
get OG (.78/8.6=.090*10=.9/5=.183*4=0.73= OG 1.073). I had made a brown ale
using 8lbs 2row, 1lb aromatic, 1/2lb carapils, 1/2lb wheat, 1/2lb homemade
brown (10lbs) . Ground in a Corona mill, mashed/sparged flour and all. The
 .78 is what I came up with using his grain extract table for all the grain
listed, I didn't give any points for the brown. I used 5 gals 175F water for
the sparge, the thermometer in the grain bed stayed at 167F during the 50min
sparge. I thought I had gotten good extraction due to the measured gravity of
1.058. I had insulated the zapap tun with two layers of 1/2in carpet padding
wrapped with duct tape. Will the Gott/Rubbermaid cooler help improve the
extraction, or maybe some improvement in my technique? Recommendations,
suggestions? Thanks! m.marshburn/d202`at`cgsmtp.comdt.uscg.mil
