Brewers:


I visited a fairly large pet store this past weekend and asked
if they had a stainless steel airstone, which I intended to use
as a wort aerator.  They had never heard of such a device, and
noted that most saltwater fish enthusiasts use an airstone made
of "limewood," which has a suitable permeability.


Is the stainless steel airstone a figment of someones imagination?


Can anyone quote me a source of such a device?

Where this line of thinking came from was that foods rich in purine 
(DNA) like red meats, sour cream, yogurt, cheese, and unfiltered wine 
were the foods of the wealthy and since only the well to do got gout, 
it must be related to diet. Then when it was found that the body uses 
purine to make uric acid....  We now know that this line of reasoning 
is faulty.


According to "Principles of Internal Medicine" and "Pharmacokinetics",  
gout is a function of either the kidneys not clearing uric acid or the 
body manufacturing more uric acid than the kidneys can clear. Which 
condition determines which therapy. A purine free diet will only 
reduce serum urate levels by 1% and a purine rich diet has the same 
affect by increasing serum urate by only a few percentage points. 
Therefore dietary purine is not a contributor 
to gout.


It has also been found that ingestion of lead will lead to gout. 
Leaded crystal can leach lead into an alcohol containing fluids.


As a gout sufferer, I initially thought I would have to drink only 
filtered beer and retire from judging. I am glad this is not the case.

Yes, but note that either whatever you are sanitizing (media, etc.) is a
liquid or, in the case of the bottles, steam is the sanitizing agent.  The
orginal question was about the sanitation of a plastic funnel.  My gut
feeling was that microwaves may not affect bacteria or they may be simply
so small that a significant number of them might be missed completely by
the beams.  I know that when I microwave a large plate of food, sometimes
there are cool spots amidst some very hot spots.

     Hello Beer People:


     I had a brain fart and dumped my yeast in at >150F (7g M&F and 7g
     Ironmaster). I figured that all the yeasties were dead so I stuck the
     primary out in the garage, planning on getting an OG later when I
     reyeasted. Well, when I woke up in the morning, much to my surprise,
     the airlock was bubbling merrily away, so the opportunity for getting
     an OG was gone.


     I know that some of you wizards can predict an OG from the
     ingredients, so if somebody would be willing to give me some rough
     numbers, I would be grateful.


     I started by steeping 1/2 lb of cracked light crystal in the water as
     it came up to boil, then dumped in 6.6 lbs of IREK light Bavarian
     extract. I can't imagine that the hops would affect the OG, but if so,
     I used 3 oz of Hallertauer. Yeild was about 4.8 gal.


     Thanks in advance.


                                Gordo

Subject: heating element for RIMS


"JOHNMAJ`at`aol.com" rightly shoots down my suggestion to use a transformer to
step up the voltage from 110 to 220V for inline heating element in a RIMS.
His first point is quite valid: the transformer will draw too much current.
However, his second complaint does not seem justified. He argues that it will
de-activate the enzymes. I disagree. Standard temperature rise times in RIMS
are on the order of 1-2 Degrees per minute. Pumps typically run at 2-3gal
per minute. Total heat capacity of water + grains is usually < that of 5 
or 6 gallons of wort (3 gal water + 10 lbs grain `at` .4 * heat capacity of 
water = heat capacity of 7 gal water. wort has higher heat capacity than water
due to its higher density => higher mass ).
        So if the full system is heating at 1-2 Degrees per minute, then
the temperature differential between input and output of the heating chamber
must be 2-4 Degrees because half of the system's thermal mass was heated in 
the time period of one minute. People who have actually measured this        
difference feel free to comment on this "back-of-the-envelope" calculation.
        If one were to go from heating with 1.5KW to 5KW of power, the        
temperature differential would be > 3 times larger: 7-13 Degrees. As long as
one never stopped pumping, one would only be heating the circulating fluid 
around 10 degrees higher than the target temperature of the rise. And it 
would only be at that higher temperature for around one second before it would 
end up mixing with colder grains and wort back in the mash tun. This does not
seem likely to cause much de-naturing. After all, it takes 10 minutes to
de-activate enzymes at mash out temperature (170 Degrees). A second or
two seems rather insignificant in comparaison. 
        Some caveats: One would definitely have to be careful NEVER to stop
pumping as "JOHNMAJ`at`aol.com" points out!
        I would consider a 3 gal/min pump a minimum for this setup.
        I assumed good mixing of the rapidly flowing fluid in the heating
chamber. If a laminar flow developed around the heating element, scorching
could be a real problem. But at 3gal/min, I doubt this happens. And one could
simply add some irregular protrusions in the pipe to stir things up as the
flow travels past. 
        This is purely theoretical. Those who have tried this would be in a 
better position to comment.


        As for the current drawing problem, Plug the thing into the 220V  
socket for you stove/washing machine/ other big appliance. No transformer
required! Compared to adding another heating element, this is still an easier
thing to implement than adding another heating chamber. cheaper too. 
        Or else, get a transformer to step the 110V to 140 or 150 Volts. Or
Whatever is required. The point is, you already have a heater which can
more than triple its output. So don't add all that extra plumbing, when the
problem seems to be an electrical one. 
                                      
        I encourage further comments, as there may well be aspects I have not
considered.

Subject: RE: Surface Tension


In HBD 1719, Dr. John M. Pratte (pratte`at`gg.csc.peachnet.edu) responded to a 
previous post on hydrometer usage by asking:


>What I'm not sure of, though, is

I believe that you may have misunderstood what the original poster is doing.  He
is not taking a hydrometer reading *while* the hydrometer is spinning.  His 
technique (which seems to be fairly ubiquitous) is to spin the hydrometer, wait 
until it stops, _then_ take a reading.  The purpose of spinning the hydrometer 
is to dislodge gas bubbles that stick to the side and underside of the 
hydrometer.  This is very important to do since the gas bubbles will increase 
the buoyancy of the hydrometer, leading to incorrect readings.


To respond to the original poster:  I have encountered the same problem, and 
what I do is simply poke the hydrometer stem with the nail-side of my finger if 
it gets to close to the wall.  


Cheers,

Subject: Summary of OG Calculations


Hi Group,
First let me thank everyone for their responses, this is the HBD at its finest!


Background:
I was bemused over the apparent discrepancy between published %Extractions
(Fine Ground) numbers from the Malting Houses, the amount of fermentables I
understood the Dark grains to contain, and the math that was used to explain
it. 
I.E. I was clueless about OG calculations and didnt know it. 


The Summary:
1.Malt Specification Sheets list Weight % Extraction for Finely Ground As-Is
malt. (As-Is meaning with nominal moisture content) This is done in the lab
using a special standardized test that results in the Maximum dissolution of
available solutes in the Malt. On a weight percent basis, this works out to
between 60-80%, depending on the malt type.


2. Homebrewers, including microbrewers, use conditions that are closer in
practice to the Coarse Ground As-Is. But CG numbers are not as common on the
spec. sheets; at least the ones I was looking at.


3. The baseline that this system of malt-extraction-yield works from is that 1
pound of sucrose per gallon will raise the OG by 46.31 pts. Therefore, the %E
that is given on spec. sheets is multiplied by 46.31 to obtain the maximum
points/pound/gallon (ppg) obtained from that malt. However, in the case of
Roasted Malts et al., not all of the extraction is fermentable. The ppg for the
malt may be 25, but perhaps only 1 ppg is fermentable, the other 24
contributing to the body and mouthfeel. This explains higher finishing gravitys
for Stouts.


4. Because the amounts of specialty grains used are small, especially in the
case of roasted grains, the contribution to the OG is small, about 2-3 pts.
This small contribution minimized the error in my calculations.


5. Because the %E number (Fine Ground, As-Is) for 2 Row Malt is about 80%, the
max ppg # for this malt is 46.31 x .8 = 37 ppg. Most homebrewers do well to get
32 ppg from their mash conditions and lauter systems. This works out to 86%
Efficiency for their mash system. Brewing Programs such as SUDS may either
provide an Efficiency variable field or may incorporate one in the
calculations, I dont know. The numbers I was working with already had that
Eff.% applied to them, as well as being just plain offbase when it came to the
Roasted Malts.


So there you have it: From Fine Ground As-Is %E, to 46.31 conversion to PPG, to
85-90% efficiency of the individual mash system, to the 30 PPG ballpark that we
as homebrewers strive for when talking lautering and sparging.


NOW I get it.


Comments to the contrary won't necessarily surprise me...

I find that the secret ingredient that improves ALL postings to the HBD is
coriander.  I put it right into the primary, along with any other significant
ideas.  (None of which can be found in THIS paragraph.) (Then again, that is
not so unusual at times...)


I used to wait and add it to the secondary, but I found that it just did not
have the same impact.  However, dry-coriandering can be extremely effective
if it is first boiled vigorously (using a propane cooker inside a plastic
bag) for the purpose of denaturing any active ingredients.  The best coriander
can be picked growing right alongside the Venturi highway, just south of the
Bernoulli junction.


Of course, it has to be finely ground first.  I recommend using a genuine
JJ Koch combination mill and yeast gene splicer; even though JJ is my brother
and I own 50% of the stock in the company, let me assure you that I have no
commercial interests at all.


While sarcasm tablets might be a great ingredient for the HBD, I would not
put any in my beer.  After all, I follow the Rhineheitsgebot even though I can
neither spell nor pronounce it.  This, of course, means that I use only the
pure ingredients of water, hops, barely, irony, and yeast.


As always, I apologize for any recent threads which I have inadvertantly
failed to parody.

It's really pretty easy.  Specific gravity is nothing more than the weight of
a liquid compared to an equal volume of pure water at a given temperature.
All too often, this is used as a measure of the amount of fermentables, but
this is simply not the case.  If you dissolve common table salt into water,
you raise its specific gravity, but it clearly is not more fermentable as a
result.


So it should not be a surprise that heavily roasted grains (charcoal) raise
the OG.  Coincidentally, they probably raise the FG as well!


Which brings me to a curiosity question I have pondered greatly, but never
come to a satisfactory conclusion.  Is there a relationship between the FINAL
gravity of a brew to its thickness, mouth feel, or any of those other words
used to describe this sort of thing?

It is a bad idea to use water at boiling or near-boiling
temperature to sparge because you are likely to be
bursting some starch granules.  That will lead to a hazy
beer as the unconverted starches other carbohydrates
get washed out.


So yes, you will get a point or two higher extraction rate
but not necessarily a better beer.

Subject: Test Method for %E


Hi Group,
Here is some more info on the Finely Ground As-Is basis % Extraction test:
I called the lab at Great Western Malting here in LA. The man I spoke with
didnt have much to say because they only make 2 row and 6 row base malts there,
no specialty malts. But he did give me the outline of the test they do for
determining the % extraction for the different basis'.


Per ASPC methods:
1. Grind 50g of malt.
2. Add 200ml of water and heat to 45C for 30 minutes.
3. Add 100ml of water and heat to 70C over a span of 24 minutes.
4. Hold at 70C for 60 minutes and then cool to 20C (didnt ask).
5. Add more water to bring total wt. (malt and water) to 450 grams.
6. Filter (didnt ask) and measure density of liquid (some machine).


As you can see, this is a pretty long conversion time and a lot of water for
that small amount of malt. No wonder they get such a high number.
FYI: Great Western Malting is owned by Canada Malting Inc which also owns Hugh
Baird of the UK.

Subject: Skunky odor from sunlight


After reading the threads on sunlight effect on clear bottles I have a
question.
If I am very careful in brewing, bottling and storage will my beer develop a
skunky odor or taste in 5 minutes or so if I pour it in a crystal clear mug
and take it outside to drink?  I'd really not like to have to guzzle a great
lager or even an ale in 10 minutes to avoid a skunky taste and I really don't
want to live in my basement to enjoy a brew.


Also, while sanitation is extremely important I think some people are getting
rather paranoid as to its effects on a homebrew.  I've been brewing for about
4 years (both extract and all-grain) and I have found that a reasonable amount
 of care will produce a great brew.  Some people just seem to think that you
need sterile, laboratory conditions are necessary.  Ever been to a Micro or
Mega brewery?- not exactly the same environment that you would find in a
micro-biology lab!


This is not criticism just- Let's just have fun!

  Hello All,


  I enjoy sharing my homebrew with my fellow colleagues.  One batch I
  recently shared was a Honey lager.  I was an excellent lager, one that I
  would recommend to anyone.


  While explaining, to one of my colleagues, how this particular batch of
  beer was made, I told her that I used 2.5 lbs. of filtered,
  non-pasteurized honey.  From what I could get from the discussion we had,
  she said that cooking with honey is harmful.  She has been an avid
  believer in Ayurveda, which is an Indian (from India, not Native America)
  Nutritional belief.  From what she said it seems as though the chemical
  structure of the honey is broken down and what results is considered
  toxic to the human body.  However, I find this extremely hard to believe
  because many things are made with Honey, including most breads, cookies,
  and even adding honey to hot tea.


  Now my question:  Has anyone else heard of this, and if so what is the
  scientific evidence for such a belief,  or is my colleague a few fries
  short of a Happy Meal?


        Just curious,

     Yes! I have noticed a difference between immersion and counterflow, 
     but it was more in the finish or the nose.  I think a quick cool down 
     with a counterflow right after a hop back would be the best 
     situation.   I have yet to build myself a hop back, However, but I do 
     believe that if it takes more than 10 minutes to cool down your wort, 
     you start loosing the subtle finish hops.  
     
     I have gone to cooling down my wort in my kegs (I ferment in 5 gal 
     pin lock kegs).  This accomplishes two things: First I sterilize my 
     fermenter because the wort 212 F when it goes into the keg.  Second 
     the keg serves as my wort chiller; I simply put it in a larger bucket 
     with cool water running around it.  
     
     To do the above it actually takes longer to cool down my wort than it 
     did with a good counterflow, however I have gotten excellent finish 
     hops by putting a hop bag in the keg before I start the cool down 
     period.  I take it out just prior to pitching the yeast.

Subject: First Oatmeal Stout


Well, last night I made my first oatmeal stout with extract and 
specialties.  This is the first stout I have made of any kind so I didn't 
know what to expect.  I have a question about using the specialties.  
First, the ingredients:


6#  unhopped dark malt extract
1#  unhopped dry malt
8 oz  chocolate malt
6 oz  roasted barley
4 oz  black patent malt
8 oz  rolled oats
1 tbs  CaCO3
2 oz Northern Brewer - 8.2 AAU
2 oz Fuggles - 4.2 AAU
Irish Moss - 30 min
Liquid Irish Ale yeast


I cracked the grains using my food processor in short bursts (worked 
great!).  Transferred them to a mesh strainer and shook to remove dust.  I 
did this outside so as not to contaminate the kitcken.  These were then 
placed with the oats (unground) into a grain bag.  I preheated a 10 qt. 
(12-pack) cooler with boiling water, added the grain bag and 175 deg. 
water.  Water cooled to the target of 160 deg. and steeped for 15 minutes.  
Things were working beautifully.  I boiled the water and added the extract, 
CaCO3 and the steep liquor.  This is where I have the question.  


In previous extract/grain batches I have steeped grains, then washed them 
in some of the unboiled water until the water ran "clear."  I started to do 
this with the black/chocolate malts but obviously with the black grains it 
wouldn't have run clear.  Eventually, the water I was using started to 
become the consistancy of thin syrup.  If I continued to wash them I would 
have been there for days until the liquid began to thin and probably would 
have ended up with 10 gallons of wort.  


What is the general thinking about steeping these grains?  Should I have
continued to wash them?  When someone makes an All-grain stout do they 
sparge until the liquor is thin?  


The directions for this kit (which I loosely follow) stated that I should 
steep the grains for 15 minutes and strain them into the boiling water.  I 
am wondering if I have left much of the "body" of this beer in
the grain bag.  Target 0G was 1.050-1.055.


To top the evening off, I went to use hydrometer and the damn thing had 
been broken so I couldn't take a reading.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!




Any replies are appreciated.

 It seems all of my posts here lately are about Gelatin and Oats.
 I've used reg'lar Quaker oats and oats from the bulk foods 
 section of health food stores with similar results.  It seemed to
 me that using "Oat Flakes" from bulk, wich cost slightly more than
 "Oatmeal" gave me less hassle with sparging and less head-trauma.
 Still, in experimental terms, we're talking an "n" of 2, so take it
 with a grain of salt.  I've been told that even "Instant Oatmeal" 
 will work, but haven't tried it.
 
 I did an experiment with boiling vs. not boiling gelatin.  The

 to go into detail right now.  Basically, I now believe that boiling

them, and what's wrong with you for not disliking them.  But, NOT HERE.  
In fact, this is the LAST TIME I will mention musicals on a beer-related 
forum.  (Barring the highly unlikely event that a musical about homebrewing 
ever comes out.)  The reason I won't mention "The M-word" here anymore is 
NOT because I'm being oppressed for my opinion, it's because this is NOT 
THE PLACE FOR IT.

consecutive years, and tickets sold out by the end of June last year.          
                                                                               
Tickets are $15 and may be purchased by mail, check payable to MHTG:           
MHTG / Great Taste, P.O. Box 1365, Madison, WI 53701. SASE appreciated.        
You may charge by phone, for $16 per ticket: 608.938.1985 A portion of         
the proceeds is donated to Community Radio WORT/89.9FM. The admission          
price includes a commemorative glass and unlimited sampling all                
afternoon. We are moving to a larger location (Olin-Turville Park--            
not Olin _Terrace_--on Lake Monona, across from the Dane County                
Colisseum) this year to accommodate more brewers and more patrons,             
but are limiting the size of the event to assure a relaxed, uncrowded          
atmosphere in which patrons will not have to endure long lineups               
and will have the opportunity to talk to the brewers about their beers.        
We expect about 50 breweries & brewpubs this year, and at least                
150 different beers.                                                           
                                                                               
Once the 2,500 tickets are gone, they're gone. You've been advised ;-)         
                                                                               
Coming up even sooner than the Great Taste is the Ninth Annual                 
BIG and H U G E (HWBTA Recognised Homebrew Competition) Entries are

Email to uswlsrap`at`ibmmail.com for details, rules, and forms                    
if you or your club has not received a packet.                                 
                                                                               
We have a HUGE array of prizes for the winners. In the interest of             
remaining non-commercial, I won't mention any sponsors' names (email for       
details), but the BOS winner will receive a 50 pound sack of two-row           
delivered directly from the malting company. If BOS is brewed by an            
extract brewer, we will substitute extracts plus one of the other prizes,      
and the grain will go to the highest ranking all-grain beer. Besides           
grain and extracts (MALT), we have prizes in the other important               
ingredient categories. HOPS: flowers and pellets from two different            
sponsors. YEAST: culturing kits. (Sorry, you have to provide your own          
WATER :-) ) We'll also have prizes that will help you measure the              
temperature of your fermenting wort and that will help you measure the         
colour of the finished beer. Also, subscriptions to two publications:          
one that will help you improve your brewing techniques,and another to          
educate you about beer.
