Subject: Beer Storage




Question for all you keggers out there:


How long can I keep beer in a corny keg at room temp (75-78F) before it 
develops off flavors.  The reason I ask is there is a company party in 
September for which I volunteered to provide samples as a beer tasting.  I 
was planning on kegging four cornies for the event, but I wanted to start 
soon so they could carbonate, mellow, etc, and maybe a little personal 
sampling also.  These would all be Ales because I cannot properly lager at 
this time.


Thanks

Subject: Enzymes fix stuck batches & Home malting




About a week ago I posted about two "stuck" ferments I had, and how
I added a homemade enzyme extract from malted barley.  After taking
a risk of adding possibly unsterile extract (extracted at 60C/140F),
both batches again fermented rapidly.  One person suggested that both
batches would become infected, but I wanted to post a follow up on how
it did work.  


Batch #1:  (extract based)
OG 1.090, stuck at 1.043.
Enzyme extract added, and went down to 1.018.
It is still SLOWLY fermenting in the secondary.


Batch #2:  (all grain mashed)
OG 1.046, stuck at 1.012 (should have gotten down to 1.002).
Enzyme extract added, and went down to 1.000.
It cleared, and I bottled it.  Tastes Fine!  Passes my wife's stringent
taste test also :-)


Sidenote: Batch 2 was an experimental batch brewed entirely from home 
malted barley that was made from barley I bought from the feed store.  
The malting was simple and easy, and the malt produced is fine.  
In fact, the grain sizes were LARGER than malted barley from the brew
store.  How's that!  $0.40 per gallon :-)


I also ordered two enzymes: Clarase, and Diazyme ((tm) of Solvay Enzymes),
and they arrived yesterday.  They are made for brewing, and I plan on using
them as a regular addition to the ferment now, after seeing how they 
consistently help convert much of the unfermentables to fermentable sugars
for the yeast!    The Diazyme is made to produce very low carbohydrate/low SG
/"dry" beers - which is exactly what I need as a diabetic!


I also had two 2L jugs of some 1.012 raspberry ale, that was very sweet. I
am diabetic, and cannot drink such sweet ale, so I just left them sit and
gather dust.  After getting the enzymes,  I opened up the two jugs, and added
a squirt of enzyme to each jug, in the hope of lowering the SG to where there
is much less carbohydrates in it.  They both are fermenting again this morning,
without the need to re-pitch more yeast.  Hey - I can't drink them either, so
they're a waste, so I have nothing to lose, and two jugs of ale to gain if it
proves out :-)

Subject: Terminal gravity


Larry Bristol asked if final gravity relates to mouthfeel.


It certainly does, and if you think about it, everything makes sense.


   A low final gravity means that most of the stuff in the wort (sugars,
proteins, peptides) has been converted to alcohol, which has a density
close to water. Little body or mouthfeel. If you need to prove the point
to yourself, try a sample of a very high-proof liquor.  
   At the other end of the spectrum, a beer that finishes at 1.025 will 
have enough proteins and long-chain sugars remaining to affect the density
(gravity reading) and mouthfeel of the finished beer. We perceive these
larger molecules as fuller body.

Subject: Boil time


A2J`at`CU.NIH.GOV (Andy Lake) asks:


>  1. A friend of my wifes brews his own beer and boils his
>     wort for only 15 minutes. Why boil for 60 - 90 minutes, if
>     15 will do. What are the benefits of a longer boil?


Many.  


Hop utilization: a 15 minute boil is NOT going to isomerize and extract
much alpha and beta acids.  You would need to use about 4 times as much
hops for a given bitterness.  Also, you are not going to be able to create
a very interesting hop schedule in only 15 minutes.  There could be no
early or mid hop additions, but only late additions.  This means you would
have a very hard time balancing hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. 


Protein agglutination:  A 15 minute boil will not produce much of a hot
break, and consequently your beer could suffer greatly from haze problems.


DMS (Dimethyl sulfide): A 15 minute boil is not long enough to drive
off various sulfur containing organic compounds from your wort.  These
compounds lead to a "cooked corn" character in the beer.  See HBD #1709 
for Andy Walsh's description of these compounds (DMS, DMSO, SMM).  Also 
check the archives for other such threads.


Volume reduction: A 15 minute boil is not going to reduce your volume 
very much, so your sparge volumes will have to be quite small and this
will reduce your extraction efficiency.  I typically collect over 8 gallons
of wort for a 5 gallon batch.  This means about a 2 hour boil at volume
losses of about 1 gal/hour.


Household aroma: It requires much longer than 15 minutes to really 
get the whole house smelling like a brewery.  A 2 hour boil ensures that
the wonderful, incredible smell of boiling wort thoroughly permeates the 
walls and furniture.  Only a long boil will guarantee that your home
retains this aroma for a couple of days.


Speaking of advertisements ... what really bug me are those PC and Mac
mail programs that add advertising taglines.  Please complain to the 
developers!  Unite in fighting this growing scrouge!  Boycott the suckers!
Kill your television--it's watching YOU!  UFOs are monitoring my phone 
calls!  Ackk!


Oops ... off my medication ... overdo on that first morning Bloody Mary.

If you are an extract brewer and using pre-hopped extract, then 15
minutes are probably all that is necessary.  Most brewers, even those
not using grain, quickly graduate to adding their own hops to the wort.
In this case, you need a longer, vigorous boil in order to fully
isomerize the hop oils.  If they are not isomerized then they are not
soluble in water and won't add the bitterness you're after.  Full grain
and extract+grain adjunct brewers will also need the longer boil times
to coagulate some of the proteins and other unwanted thingules (that's
a technical term) in what's generally called the "hot break".

Subject: AI Robot Reprogramming


After careful <malt> consideration of all of the suggestions regarding the
function of the AI Robot for determining each <yeast> subscriber's DWR, the
following refinements have been <hops> implemented in order to arive at the
new Digest Worthiness Index (DWI):


1. In order to take into account any contributions via <mash pH> private
e-mail, the Robot will now utilize a feed from the <barley> NSA whereby all
subscribers private e-mail will be <gypsum> monitored for HBD, beer, or
brewing related content. Any attempt to <kegging> fool the Robot with
unrelated keywords will almost certainly result in a lower <unmalted wheat> DWI.


2. The Robot will also monitor which types of posts you spend the <disolved
O2> most time reading. For instance, if you skim over an article talking
about wort aeration, but spend <munich malt> any time at all reading a poor
attempt at humor at the expense of the Robot, your DWI will suffer as a result.


3. A separate <pale ale> calculation will be randomly performed on any
suspicious looking communications to compute <grain mill> the Brewing Angst
Component (BAC) which is a measure of how much worrying you are doing about
your beer. Any post <TNCJHB> caught with a BAC above the allowable threshold
(currently a BAC of .10% in most areas) will cause <pitching rate> a loss of
subscription privileges for a period not to exceed one (1) year.


It is the intent that these changes <lactic infection> will result in a
kinder, gentler, unsubscribe engine so that only the truly unworthy will get
booted in the future.


Any future comments or criticisms should be directed to:

Subject: Equipment swap


OK, I know this is probably a wacky idea, but it won't be the 
first time.  Like many home brewers, I've evolved from the basic 
"kit" through the first stove top mash into the 10 gallon mega 
brew.  Along the way I have collected a bunch of equipment that I 
have since grown out of.  I'm sure that there are others out 
there that have equipment that is collecting dust. 


At the risk of offending the Homebrew supply store owners on the 
net, is there a way of having a used equipment list?  It could 
also serve as a forum for people looking for a specific item.  I 
surely don't want to see the HBD clogged with ads, but how about 
once a month or year or something like that?  Maybe a separate 
list in the archives?  I know that there is probably a zillion 
reasons why this won't work, which I will hear about very soon.

About five or six years ago, I read in HBD that storing beer in the dark
at 50F will reverse the effects of light on the hop components in beer
and reduce the skunkiness.  I tested this theory on a sixpack of Newcastle
Brown Ale and sure enough, it worked.  Therefore, my *guess* is that the
process by which beer gets skunky (the production of mercaptans from hop
components) appears to be reversable.  If this is true, then I believe
that if the beer was exposed to sunlight/fluorescent light for 1 minute
and then stored in the dark at 50F for a week and then exposed again for
1 minute... the levels of mercaptans would not reach our sensory thresholds.
Whether storage at 35F or 65F reverses the reaction, I don't know, bug if
indeed it doesn't, then I would say yes, the effects would be cumulative.

I see a number of problems here:


1. the plastic in those oxygen absorbing caps is activated by moisture, so
you would have to ensure that the humidity in the storage jar would have
to be high enough (sorry, don't know what that is -- if I do ever find the
phone number of that developer, I'll try to remember to ask) to start the
absorbtion (and this level of humidity might be more detremental to the
hops than the oxygen),


2. there's only so much oxygen that the caps can absorb, so you would have
to keep replacing them, and


3. it would be much simpler to just purge the container with CO2 or nitrogen
before closing (I've done this with oxygen-barrier bags and have opened up
two-year-old hop packages in which the hops smelled as fresh as the day I
bought them); you can use kegging CO2 or dry ice... heck, you can even fill
a baloon with the CO2 evolving from a bottle of beer!

I've been following the thread about lemon grass for Witbier, which I 
want to try.  Last night I saw an herb called Lemon Thyme at my grocery 
store.  This herb had a wonderful citrusy(lemony), floral, perfumy 
aroma.  After smelling this, I thought to myself, "Hmm, I wonder if this 
could also be used in a Witbier?"  The citrusy aroma seemed appropriate.  
The floral scent seemed a good complement to coriander.  And the perfumy 
scent was just plain nice.  Accordingly, I purchased this plant with 
grand visions of Lemon Thyme Witbier.  I have yet to try it and was 
wondering if anyone oput there, being fine Epicurists, Had any experience 
with this herb, not necessarily just in beer but maybe in cooking.  One 
of the suggestions on the plant was to snip and crush the leaves to make 
tea, so it does not seem too much to extend its uses to beer.  Any 
feedback will be appreciated, public or private.

Subject: Gout, and treating the symptom.


Regarding the problem with gout....the key seems to be to learn how to make
the kidneys clear uric acid better.  Its much like a river that has a dam
built in front of it.  The river represents the uric acid, and the dam
represents the deficiency of the essential components for repair.  If the
essential components are available, the river continues to flow.  If the dam
gets set, the river no longer flows and a lake is formed.  BLOW THE DAM, and
watch the uric acid reach its proper functional level.
Remember that if you just treat a symptom, it's much like having a six-pack
of Keystone Light in your fridge - would it be better to cover it with a
paper bag, or to get rid of it all together?!?!  Eliminate the problem!!

Hi all,


Could use your help regarding grain mills.  The local homebrew shops 
don't do the all grain thing.  Actually one shop has a Corona and Pale 
malt that is as old as the hills.  The malt is atleast 2 years old and 
just went up in price 50% as if malt was a long term investment.  As an 
up and coming all grain brewer I needed an alternate grain source.


Well I found two ways of acquiring fresh whole grain for about 1/3 the 
price without having to stray to far from home.  Now that I can get the 
grain I need to crush it, so:


What grain mills are there available.  What do they cost, which is the 
best quality, and what is the best source for me to acquire one.


Alternatively can I make one myself.  I was thinking of rollers of either 
metal (SS) or concrete poured around a roller mechanism.  For simplicity 
I was planning a crank handle/motor hookup directly to the spindle of one 
roller.  The second roller would be driven by the grain throughput.  What 
diameter and length are still under consideration.  I believe the rollers
 would have to be grooved/rough to pull the grain through with small 
diameter rollers.  I would also make the non-driven roller adjustable 
along a track/groove adjusted with a simple screw mechanism. 


Information on commercial sources/opinions on pre-made mills would be 
appreciated.  Due to the lack of wallet bulk any one with 
ideas/plans/opinions on making one is urged to put in there $0.02 or 
supply the million dollar solution.  


Brewing beer or making brewing equipement I'm not sure what my 
hobby/obsession is really about.


        Beers to you, TIA           Rob

Hello all,


Just a quick note to give a "two thumbs up" for a company I've recently
started doing business with.  It's called "Aeonbrau" and they sell
yeast cultures.  They have over 40 strains available, along with numerous
other "specialty" strains of yeast and bacteria  The service was prompt and 
the product was very viable.  You can contact them before May 15 at:


921 Bill Smith Road

(615) 372-8511


The owner, Brian A. Nummer (PdD in microbiology), is in the process of 
moving and opening a brewpub in Athens, GA; however, he still intends to 
sell yeast part-time.  The brochure states that he will be suspending yeast 
sales for the month of May to faciliate the move and the setup of a new lab.  
If you've into pure strains, and making the necessary starters, I suggest 
you at least get his catalog and see what's available.  The new address will 
be:

The BrewTek Wort Aeration Kit (available from Brewers Resource,
1-800-827-3983) includes a stainless steel airstone, and a
"bacteria proof" in-line air filter.  The full kit, including
pump, sells for about $27.  Cost without the pump is $20.  The
airstone and tubing have a larger diameter than standard
aquarium hose, but the kit comes with a short section that fits
a standard aquarium pump and connects to the filter, which then
connects to the main tube with airstone.  The filter is a
"syringe" filter - I have no idea what the intended use is.  I
understand that replacements (which are available from BR) can
be found more cheaply at drug stores, but I have no first hand
experience of this.  I have used this set up for my last three
batches, aerating my wort for about 30 min before pitching the
yeast, and for another 5-10 min after pitching.  The
fermentations started quicker, and were more vigorous than for
my previous batches.  The final product also tastes a bit
drier, which would indicate more complete fermentation of the
sugars in the wort.  I am pleased with this product, and
recommend it.  Naturally, I have no connection with BrewTek or
with Brewers Resource - I am just a happy customer.

Chris Geden asks if aeration air could be a potential infection problem.


Do you have any friends in the biology department who work with 
cultured cells? Ask them for a 0.2 micron filter. These are commonly
used on incubators used for housing cell cultures. 0.45 microns
is considered the cutoff for life - sterile filtration is done at 0.2
microns to remove everything, yeast, bacteria, even viruses (as far as
we can tell). These filters usually come with little caps for the ends.
I uncap mine to hook up to the tubing that leads to my air pump. After 
aerating the beer, I cap it again. Since all I force through the tubing is
sterile air, I think that the "clean" side of the filter stays clean. 
If you are pitching a healthy starter, it probably doesn't matter, but 
if you can find one of these filters, it really doesn't add any time time or
energy to the process, and  it's one less thing to worry about ;)

 To add my .02 to the skunking thread, one of my batches of homebrew was in
 a carboy, about 3 days old, fermenting merrily on my workbench.I had
 removed my grocery bag cover and had the fluorescent lights on above it.
 I returned about 15 minutes later to smell the familiar aroma eminating from
 the airlock. Fortunately the beer was not noticeably skunked, but it did
 surprise me to see that skunking could really happen so quickly. I might
 guess that the CO2 scrubbed out the aroma quickly, at least quickly enough
 that I discovered what was happening rapidly. One possible variable in the
 equation is that in my fluorescent fixtures I use one plant grow light
 and one standard fluorescent ( highlights colors very well ) so the spectrum
 would be different than a normal fixture. YMMV.

Lee,


Yes, I'm afraid your Volrath 38qt stainless kettle is ruined. The mercury 
would have formed a molecular bond to the stainless steel surface which 
would leach back into your beer in lethal doses over time.


In fact, it is no longer safe for you to store it in your home and it 
would be an ecological disaster for you to dispose of it in an ordinary 
dump or land fill.


I strongly suggest you immediately send it(post paid) to a trained professional,
like myself for proper disposal.

I needed to cool it down about 10 more degrees than my ambient fermenting

To make a short story short, IT WORKED!!!
My fermenter temperature dropped about 11 degrees in 12 hours, and the yeast

Time for me to chime in with my own "dropping" experience.  I made 10
gallons of Mild, split in two, pitched the same yeast in both, started
in a 7 gallon bucket.  After a couple days fermentation (when the
krauesen was quite cruddy looking on top), I "dropped" (racked, i.e.)
them into carboys.  One I was careful not to aerate, the other I let
fall from the end of the siphon hose to the bottom of the carboy, thus
introducing some air.


The unaerated batch is nice, but the aerated batch has a much more
"rounded" flavor, with a perceptible hint of diacetyl.  Since this is
what I was hoping for, I'm quite happy.


Also, the carboys ended up with essentially no "ring-around-the-collar" 
from the very clean krauesen that was produced by the rest of the
fermentation.

I have Randy's book and it has some interesting information on brewing as well
as a plethora or charts, tags, and other graphical creations, but I have to
recommend the 40/60/70C (105/140/158F) mash schedule that George Fix described
in a post several months ago.  The mash can be completed in 1.5-2 hours.  I 
like the mash program for the following reasons:


o Instead of adjusting the temperature of the mash to control fermentability,
  the 140F and 158F mash times are manipulated.  After a standard 30 min.
  rest at 105F, the mash is boosted to 140F for 30 minutes (nominally), after
  which, the mash is again boosted to 158F for a 30 min. rest.
  
o This mash program has increased my yields over a one-step infusion.


o Once, you have performed several mashes with this technique, achieving
  the temperature boosts becomes more accurate.  I perform my 105F rest
  at a water/grist ratio of 0.75qts/lb. and boost to 140F with 0.5-0.7 qts.
  boiling (212F here) water.  I then perform a 35-40% decoction to 
  reach the 158F rest.
  
I know that many if not most grain brewers out there are looking for ways
to reduce their brewing time (not that time spent brewing isn't "quality"
time).  I wanted to pass along a tip.  If you fire your boiler while you
are sparging into it, you can save alot of time: I use a re-jetted Cajun
Cooker (0.040" orifice) and spend 30-45 min sparging.  I adjust input heat
so that I'm at a rolling boil at sparge completion.  I usually gather 2
gallons of sweet wort prior to firing the kettle.


I can complete my brew session in 4.5 hours (wort in carboy) unless there
are complications.  It helps to have F-16 power under the kettle 8{).    


Cheers,

Subject: Yeast - Changing SG




I just collected some yeast from a bottle of Strong Belgian Ale and
cultured it up.  It is now happily burbling in my latest batch, a
Strong Belgian Ale, of course.  This yeast is extremely vigorous, has
that nice spicey, fruity profile wanted in this style, and since it
came from a 10.5% alcohol beer, should be very alcohol tolerant.  I
grew it up in a 1.070 wort to make sure it did not go into osmotic
shock when pitched into my 1.094 wort, and from the results of a 3"
krausen in my blowoff bucket after 12 hours, it had no shock.


This yeast seems to have a desirable flavor/aroma profile for a wheat
beer, but the wheat would be of a very much lower specific gravity.
Given that I would never expose the "mother culture" to low gravity to
ensure the strain retains its high gravity tolerance, how would you
expect it to perform in a gravity of from 1.035 to 1.045?  I would
expect to grow up my starter in a 1.040 wort to ease it on down to
lower gravity.

Without actually doing it, I think there would be.  However, none of my 
finished beers have an SG of 1.045.  I say take this sugar-water, and ferment
it down to about 1.010 or 1.005 and then compare it to regular water.  (Or
water with yeast in it or something.)  NOW how is the mouthfeel?


Or just put enough sugar in for an SG of 1.010 and try it.  I don't deny 
that sugar contributes something to mouthfeel, I'm pretty sure it does, 
but, according to Miller (and my admittedly limited experience), protein
contributes more than sugar, at least in terms of the "heavyness" or
"fullness" of the mouthfeel.  I think that the perceived texture of beer is
not something completely captured on a single scale.

Subject:  Iodine Test/Microwave Sanitation


Iodine Test: I have been an all grain brewwer for some time now (about 10
batches). All grain is a time consuming process. I have always mashed my
grain for 75 minutes at the 154 degrees F level. Yeilds have always been
adaquate. I have seeen a few mashers comment "that conversion was complete
in 30 min. by the Iodine Test". Can someone help me out with the Iodine
test. Can anyone provide a full procedure for me to conduct my own Iodine
test. Are there any other tests for conversion?


Microwaves: I thought that microwave ovens heat things up based on the
principle of "resonant frequency of H20". Basically the oven generates
microwaves with a frequncy close to resonance tof the h20 molecule. This
resonance makes the water "vibrate faster" which increases its energy level
or heats it up. Food with alot of water in it or water itself heat up very
quickly. Items without water in them would not heat up very quickly or not
at all. The only way they may get hot is because the materials structure
would be similiar to waters.


Can any of the Physics Experts set this straigt?
