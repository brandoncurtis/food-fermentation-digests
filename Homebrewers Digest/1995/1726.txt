While I was at University there were lots of women interested in
homebrew. Now I'm getting married (in 12 days!!!) I introduced the 
idea of making some beer. My wife to be was really interested, and
wants to do it herself - we're going to have a competition between us
to see who can make the best pint...


Whilst on the subject, if your wife / partner isn't interested in brewing
then surely that is O.K. Just because she is your wife / partner should
not mean that she ahs to enjoy the things you do.


On a new subject, anyone know a good pub / bar in Mombasa?
private e-mail most welcome as I'll be unsubscribing for my vacation soon.

As John wrote about the Superb Burner in HBD 1725 I have used one for
2 years and love it I get 8 batches of 5 or 10 gal out of one 20 lb tank.
I have used Volrath HofStevens kegs and Sanke kegs all have no problems
on the burner and 10 gal of 150 deg wort heats to a rolling boil in 15 min
I also have a friend who has 2 Camp Chief burners and his work equally 
fine. Both have Bnajo style burners. So you make the choice !!!
Before the Superb I had a Cajun Cooker and used it twice and the sold it
at a loss.

CEO file contents:  
         Brew buddies,
         
              Back  in  mid-February,  I collected the yeast slurry (Wyeast
         #1084) from the bottom of my primary  fermenter.  The  slurry  was
         'cleaned'  by  swirling  it around with sterile water a few times,
         and letting the break material and hops separate from the yeast. I
         dumped the cleaned slurry into  one  gallon  of  1.040  wort.  The
         fermentation  took  off  within 30 minutes. I let the wort ferment
         completely, and then bottled the whole thing - yeast  deposit  and
         all.  No priming sugar was used. These bottles have been kept cold
         (between 37F and 45F) for about three months now...
              Work and home obligations have kept me  from  brewing  since,
         but I hope to brew in about two weeks and was hoping to try to use
         some  of  this  bottled yeast. Can any of you tell me what are the
         chances of my yeast still being alive and well? Is there  any  way
         for  a  common  mortal (i.e. microscope impaired) to check whether
         the bottled yeast is contaminated? Should I just taste the bottled
         beer, or maybe try to make a small test starter and taste it after
         fermentation? In general, how long can bottled yeast stay 'alive'?
              I am about to brew my first  'unsupervised'  all-grain  batch
         and would hate to ruin it because of contaminated yeast...
         
         Answers to any of my questions would be very appreciated...

THE NINTH ANNUAL BIG AND HUGE IS COMING, and many judges will make             
"light" work of all those big-hearted beers of 1.050 OG and higher.            
It's this Saturday (13th) at 10am in Madison, the Beer Capital of the          
Midwest, at Angelic Brewing Company, Madison's newest brewpub.                 
                                                                               
If you've previously expressed an interest or requested information, it's      
now time to confirm your intent to judge. And if you haven't said anything     
yet, but are now interested, let's talk.... Madison is an easy drive from      
Chicago, Northern and Central Illinois, Eastern Iowa, Southern Minnesota.      
And even from Western Michigan or Indiana or Saint-Louis and other places      
of comparable distance it's not such a bad drive.                              
                                                                               
The fine folks of the Madison Homebrewers and Tasters Guild will see to        
it that you get a quality judging experience and have a good time :-)          
If you've been waiting for an excuse to check out all those great beers here,

Bill Cook wrote about re-using yeast:


I know lots of people throw fresh wort on top of yeast from an earlier 
batch, but I always take the extra few minutes to wash the yeast.  There 
is an excellent outline of this simple process in the yeast FAQ.  Bill 
was concerned about using yeast from a stout with a new batch of bitter 
and whether flavors would carry through.  I believe washing the yeast 
would rid the yeast of previous flavors.  If you simply through a freshly 
boiled bitter on top of spent yeast and trub from a previous batch, I 
would think there would be some transmitted flavors.  I don't know for 
sure but am going on intuition.

Mike Demers wrote using an oven as an insulated box for mashing:


This method works great, however, when you put your kettle in the oven, 
turn off the heat.  The oven is insulated and will keep a steady 
temperature for the entire mash, as long as you don't open up the door 
before the mash is complete.  I was warned that leaving the heat on might 
actually raise the temperature or scorch the bottom grains.

Subject: Lauter-Tun questions...


I would like to make the jump to all-grain brewing and have a 40 quart
cooler that can be used as my lauter-tun.  I am thinking of making a false
bottom by creating a square from pieces of wood.  Then, covering the bottom
of this square with screen; the type used in sliding-screen doors.  At the
bottom of the cooler I could then set the screen on supports to allow proper
drainage of the runnings.  Since I've never worked with grain in the past I
would like to ask the following.


1.  Will the screen mesh be sufficient to create a grain bed or would
crushed grain still be able to slip through the screen with the runnings?


2.  Does anyone see potential problems with making a false bottom using wood
and screen?


3.  Because of my lack of lautering knowledge is there a better way to
create, or material to use, for a false bottom in a 40 quart, square cooler?


All replys from beginners to experts are greatly appreciated.

Subject: RE: Smoking Grains for Brewing


FROM: Gregory_Matthew/avid_marketing`at`answer




Wade Wallinger asks about Smoking Grains.


1. what type of malt to use, pale malt?


I have had success doing a few backyard grain smoking adventures, using
pale and pilsener malts. They seem to absorb more of the smoke character
than specialty grains (ie crystal).   


2. what type of wood to smoke? anyone ever try mesquite?


I have had excellent results brewing with fruit-wood smoked grains.
Fruit woods such as Peach & Apple give the grains a very nice smoky
flavor.  IMHO, woods such as Hickory and Mesquite seem to give too much
of a backyard barbecue flavor.  There are other woods commonly used,
including Beech Wood & Alder.
 
3. must the grains remain cool while smoking, or is it ok to smoke in a
gas grill where they will be exposed to the heat as well?


The grains used for smoking should be moist, which allows for more
absorption of the smoke flavors.  A quick immersion in cold water, or
spraying them down with water from a bottle works.  


A grill could be used for smoking, but would have to allow enough room
between the heat source and grains to prevent scorching the grains.


Below is my smoking method with a backyard smoker.
The smoker is similar to a grill, but has a higher level for the smoking
items and a tray in between the heat source and smoking item, that holds
water.  The water produces steam that keeps the grain moist throughout
the smoking.  I cut 1/2" pieces of wood from 2" diameter branches, then
soak the wood for 20 minutes. The wood pieces ar then placed on top of
hot charcoal, which produces smoke very quick.  Then the grains are
placed on a stainless steel screen on the smoker rack & smoked for about
1 hour.  


Peach Smoked Porter Recipe (5 Gal All Grain):


Grain:
3 lbs smoked 2-row pale malt, using Peach Wood & method above
7 lbs 2-row malt
1/2 lb Black Patent Malt
1/2 lb Med Crystal
1/4 lb Chocolate Malt


Hops:
1 oz N. Brewer 7.5% - 60 minutes
1/4 oz Goldings 5% - 30 minutes
1/4 oz Goldings - Finish
(Low on hops for more smoke flavor character)


Yeast:
Liquid Wyeast 1056 starter


Single step Infusion Mash at 154 for 90 minutes.
Warning: This beer disappears very quickly when friends are around.
For Extract batches, the smoked & specialty grains can be steeped up to
170 for 45 min.
This should produce a beer in the 1050's for starting gravity.

From: LBRISTOL`at`SYSUBMC.BMC.COM
Subject:      Terminal Gravity


A few people have responded to my query about final gravity.  Thank you all
for the time and information.


But I need to clarify what it is I am curious about.  In all of the brewing
literature I have read, and indeed all of the discussions I have seen about
gravities, a tremendous emphasis is placed on the OG.  The role of the FG
seems to be of little importance, other than in computing the amount of
alcohol produced.


On the other hand, it seems to be the collective wisdom of all sources I
know (including the HBD) that the proteins and dextrins remaining in the
final beer contribute to the "thickness", "mouth feel", and so forth.  But
no one ever seems to be able to put any sort of objective or quantitative
measure on this factor.


So my question is basically this - Assuming that we allow the beer to reach
full attenuation, does the FG represent such an objective, quantitative
measure of the amount of protein/dextrine present in the beer, and therefore
(by extension), its "thickness", "mouth feel"", etc.?


Attenuation is a requirement, because if fermentables still remain, then at
least part of the gravity measurement represents these sugars.  I do not make
beers where I purposely stop the fermentation to make sweet beers, and I do
not assume that the unfermented sugars would also contribute "thickness" etc.,
although it seems logical that they would.


As a hypothetical, lets assume we have two beers, one with an OG of 1060 and
another at 1040, and when both of these reach attenuation, the FG is 1010.
While one of them clearly has produced more alcohol, is it reasonable to
expect them both to exhibit the same level of "thickness", "mouth feel", etc.?
If the answer is "yes", then the FG would represent an objective measure; if
"no", then why not?  Or suppose we have two beers that both start at the same
OG, but end with FG of 1010 and 1015 respectively.  Is it a given that the
beer ending at 1015 will have more "mouth feel" than the other?


We all know that various mash conditions (such as time, temperature, and pH)
effect the ratio of maltose and dextrins produced, and that we can use these
to purposely influence the relative dryness/thickness of the resulting beer.
I'm looking for an objective way to measure the results of my tinkering with
these mash conditions, and it occurs to me that FG might provide this,
especially if the OG was the same in all cases.  Or maybe I could use the
ratio of OG:FG as a little better way to measure.


What does the collective wisdom have to say?

I planted three hills in March of last year and by mid-April they

when they hadn't shown up by mid-April.  Saturday, May 6th, with
still no sign of life, I decided to dig around and see what was
going on.  The result is damp, rotted, dead, hop cuttings.  These
hops were fantastic last year.  Their first year in the ground and
they produced much more than I expected, but the excessive water,
(they're too near a downspout I think) did them in.  Fortunately,
I was parking in front of the local homebrew store that evening and
saw that they still had hop cuttings for sale and would be open on
Sunday.  Well, you can guess what I was doing yesterday.


So, the moral is: hops love water when they're growing but the soil
should drain well or you can drown them out.

That's a good question.  Since it's their first year and they aren't
well established yet you could probably get away with it.


Oh, and you asked about rabbits, I would be surprised if the rabbits
didn't think that hop shoots were a delicacy.  I've heard that deer
love them.

Yup.  For my rauchbier I used 1 kilo (2 pounds or thereabouts) of pale malt.

Indeedy!  I used mesquite, and the beer has a very meaty type smoky flavour,
kind of like eating a good mettwurst while drinking the beer.  Yum!

Well I smoked mine in a Weber BBQ kettle, and I let the grains get a bit too
hot so that some of them got a little roasted, but all this did was add a
deeper colour and a little bit of roasted flavour to the beer, not too much
though.  I would probably recommend against letting them roast though.
It can be solved by turning the grains, I was just too lazy to do it during
the third 15 minutes they were smoking.

I use a small test tube, and put an eyedropper full of mash liquid in,
and add 1 drop of tincture of iodine solution, as shake to mix.  If 
the iodine turns the liquid a blackish color, there is starch left.  If 
it just dilutes the iodine to a lighter brown color, no starch is left.


Comment on the iodine test.....
While the test proves the exsitence (or lack) of starch, it DOESN'T prove
that the mash has yielded the most fermentable sugars that it could if
mashed longer.  The iodine test will NOT show a positive test for 
unferementable dextrins, that could yet be converted if mashed longer,
or mashed at a bit lower temp.  Remember that starch conversion is actually 
like a two step process:  starch --> dextrins, then dextrins --> sugars, 
and the iodine test only tests for starch, and doesn't show whether the
process has progressed as far as it could......   It is a good cheap
test for starch however.

I have just about made up my mind to get an Aluminum stockpot. There have not

a stainless steel.


However, using aluminum has brought up another important point... how do I 
put a valve in the bottom side of an aluminum brewpot (my understanding is 
that welding is out of the question with aluminum)? Can I simply drill a hole
and use threaded nipple fittings with some form of gasket? If so what should
I use for a gasket?

I'm about to take the plunge and start brewing. :-)


I'm looking at what sort of equipment to acquire.  I wonder if anyone has
used the "Mr. Beer" kit advertised in the Summer, 1995 Zymurgy.  Lexan
sounds like some sort of plastic.  Does it pose the same risks of infection
as other plastic fermenters?  Also, the same Zymurgy has an advertisement
for a Symbio "personal fermentor" on page 28.  This seems to provide a similar
capability, but is made of glass.  Anyone have any experience with this one?


Should I just relax and get a plastic bucket?


Thanks.

Subject: Weizen / #3068




A couple of weeks back, I posted a description of my first Decoction mash,
an attempt for a SO-Satisfying Weizen.  While the brewing itself seemed
to go quite smoothly, I had two concerns at the time:  three days after
pitching my #3068, the damn thing took off like a volcano...a fermentation
like none I have ever seen!  This was only a concern to me because it
developed a cheap Budmilloors stench after this, masking the wonderful
banana-clove aroma that had started to develop.


Anyway, I kegged and carbonated it this weekend, and it's heavenly! 
Apparently the stench which had me concerned was not from the been itself,
but the 1" of kreusen that had stuck to the inside of all the glass.  This
beer is full-bodies, has a nice banana-clove aroma, and is one of the
best-tasting beers I've made.  So here are my lessons learned from this
batch:


1) Decoction mashing is easy!  Well, at least it's every bit as easy as
   step-infusion.


2) When using #3068, USE A BIG BLOWOFF TUBE!  This stuff is out of hand.


3) Also re: #3068...careful with those fermentation temps...mine spent a
   few days in the 70F range, and I now understand what people mean when 
   they say that this yeast can get overly-banana-y at warmer temps...it's
   fine for me & my tastes, but it's probably too strong for some.

Just a small correction to a previous post:  viruses will not be removed
by a .2 micron filter (or any filter you might reasonably use).  Viruses
are much smaller than this (with maybe a few exceptions) and this 
inability to be filtered was part of the initial characterization of
viruses.

Subject: Pale Ale Recipe


Hello fellow brewers,


I just wanted to pass along some comments on the first of a series of pale 
ales that I'm brewing in an attempt to hone my mashing/brewing technique.  
This beer came out pretty good and I would only change a couple things.  
Here's the basic recipe and procedure:


Grain:
  9.0 lbs US 2-row
  1.0 lbs 40L crystal
  0.5 lbs cara-pils
Hops:
  1.0 oz BC Kent Goldings pellets---60 min
  0.5 oz          "                 40 min
  0.5 oz          "                 20 min
  0.5 oz          "                  5 min
  0.5 oz          "                 steep for aroma
  1.0 oz          "                 dry-hop, 3 weeks in secondary
Yeast:
  Wyeast 1028 London Ale
  500-ml starter
Mash:
  Single Infusion
  3.5 gallons
  65 min `at` 68 C (154 F)
  Mashout:  Infused additional 1.5 qts.
            Held 10 min `at` 76 C (169 F)
Sparge:  Recirculated about 15 qts.
         Collected 6.5 gallons over 1 hour period
OG:  1.057
FG:  1.012
IBU: 22.7 (Suds3.0)
Ferment: 1 week primary, 3 week secondary, 20 C (68 F)
Force-carbonated in keg


Beautiful deep golden color, chill haze, medium bodied, mild hop bitterness, 
very hoppy aroma and flavor (citrusy!), mild malty finish.


I presume the chill haze is to be expected with a single infusion of klages.  
A brief protein rest might "clear" this up, but I don't want to hurt the 
body.  I would boost the bittering hops a little and slightly decrease the 
amount and duration of dry-hopping (maybe 0.5 oz for 1 weeks).  I also plan 
to use gelatin for clarification in future batches.  The big deficiency from 
my perspective is maltiness---maybe a half pound of aromatic would make 
things come alive a little.  Any suggestions are welcome.


Note:  I have already brewed pale #2 and, of course, I changed too many 
damned variables at once to determine the predominant influences.  Oh well, I 
have the rest of my life to work out the details.  I made some of the changes 
noted above, substituting toasted malt for aromatic (use what you have), and 
threw in a half pound of malted wheat just for fun.   Mash-in stabilized at 
125 F and I immediately heated to rest `at` 140 F for 30 min, then on to 156 for 1 
hour.  Perhaps this brief stint in the protein-rest range will aid in 
clarification.  I also made the classic 
mistake (read: adventure) of using a different yeast.  I bought Wyeast 1084 
Irish Ale for an oatmeal stout and then chickened out because I had no 6-row 
to aid sparging---couldn't let that precious yeast go to waste, so it ended 
up in pale ale #2.  Any ideas what I will end up with here?  Brewing in 
style is over-rated anyway.  ;-)  The Irish is presently CRANKING away `at` 64 
F.  


Sorry for the bandwidth.  This seems to be a pretty good recipe, but it 
won't win any awards (I drank it all!).  Any criticism (be kind) or comments 
are welcome.  Brew on!

Greetings Gentlemen !!!
At MY home, I am the Brewmistress and my husband is my assistant. We got
into brewing in October and are on batch #10. I decided to make our own
beer because I am amazed that grain + water + hops + yeast = beer!!!
I like to cook and I've always loved Ovaltine (the DME for kids), so it was
easy to get into brewing. I know that most of the men out there have a hard
time getting their wife's into making beer -- for us, I enjoy deciding what
to make next and my husband (and all of his friends) love to drink whatever
I make. Besides, it's quality time together (a 90's kind of thing).
Enough said....


On pH ------ Our water's pH has been raised lately -- something about copper
leaching into the water -- so we are going to start using distilled water
and building up the salts to the level of the style. The computer program
I use will show me how much salt to add. I'm sure many of us will be noticing
a rise in pH in our areas -- check with your local water company.


On ads --I LIKE hearing about new products on the digest and appreciate
info about it's good and bad points. When I buy a product (not just for beer),
I seldom/never get to hear about the product, just what's on the package. So,
if you don't like to read about it, just scroll on to the next message. FWIW,
I am tired of reading about RIMS systems, and REALLY tired of the flames about
ads on the digest -- if you boys can't behave...go to your rooms!!OH GOD, I'm
beginning to sound like my mother.....

Brewers:


Now that so many of you turned me on to the Brewers Resource catalog, 
I have a follow-on question.


Has anyone ever seen or tried the new two-roller mill that they sell?
It is apparently a new design with adjustable roller gap, lots of
stainless, motorizable, etc.

I would agree that homebrewing is, for the most part, a "guy
thing."  My wife also likes to drink beer, but she doesn't care
for the brewing part.  She dislikes the smell of boiling wort
so much, I make a point to schedule my brewing when she's not
home.  She also questions my "need" for so much paraphanalia
(three carboys, bench capper, etc., etc. etc.) that, to any 
reasonable person, is absolutley necessary for the fine art of
making good beer.  Anyway, I am grateful that I get to do it.
I have a friend who has brewed one batch, and I'm not sure if
he'll brew another because his wife didn't like the smell.  Too
bad.

Subject: What to do with a SS keg?


I recently acquired a non-Sankey stainless steel keg (15 gal.).  I 
don't know the keg type, but it has a bung hole(without bung), and a 
two-holed metal cap with rubber seal that locks into two pins at the 
top of the keg.  There is a dip tube within the keg.


Is there anything an aspiring all-grainer can make (or have made) from 
this keg? TIA.

Lee Bollard asked about source for a long-probe dial thermometer for his
mash: in Omega's Temperature Handbook (800-872-9436) they show bi-metal
dial units, all 304 ss cases, Model G on p E-29 for about $35, available 
with stem lengths up to 36".

Subject: Bottling beer?


I am about ready to bottle my **second** brew and the method I used last
time was to add sugar to the bottles individually then fill.


This time, I have been doing some reading (mainly here and ?complete joy of
home brewing? by Papazian?) and in the book recommends using dried malt
extract and the bottling method that is suggested is to add 1 cup of boiled
dried malt extract to a second fermenter, transferring the wort then bottling.


Finally, my question is how to be sure that the extract is evenly
distributed, and is it possible to do this within the original carboy (I was
hoping to put off the purchase of the next till later on.)


Thanks.
