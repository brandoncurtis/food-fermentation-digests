Subject: Water Chemistry Example


In #1725 Darren Aaberge had a question about adjusting the pH of his mash
working from Austin, TX water with a pH of 9.8, 17 ppm Calcium, 57 ppm
chloride 16 ppm Magnesium, 28 ppm Sodium 39 ppm Sulfate and a total
alkalinity as CaCO3 of 55.


For starters, I'm amazed by that pH. Do people drink this water? Does it
taste very bitter? That aside the basis for neutralization of alkalinity is
conversion of all (or nearly all) carbonate and bicarbonate to carbonic.
"Neutralization" is a bit of a misnomer since this occurs at a pH near 4
which is hardly neutral. In fact it is about as acidic as this water is
basic. Anyway, the first step is to find out how much of the alkalinity is
due to carbonate and how much to bicarbonate as each mole of carbonate
requires 2 moles of hydronium to "neutralize" it and each bicarbonate
requires one.


The ratio of bicarbonate to carbonic to  is r1 = 10^(pH - pK1) i.e. 10
raised to the power of the difference between the pH and the pK. The pK is
minus the log of the dissociation constant for the reaction H3O+ + HCO3-
<--> H2O + CO2 and has the value pK1 = 6.38. For water at pH 9.8  r1 =
10^(9.8 - 6.38) = 2630.2680.
Similarly the ratio of carbonate to bicarbonate is r2 = 10^(pH - pK2) where
pK2 is the pK for the reaction H3O+ + CO3-2 <--> HCO3- + H2O and has value
10.32. Thus r2 = 10^(9.8 - 10.32) = 0.3020.


Now let there be x moles of carbonic in the water. There are then r1*x
moles of bicarbonate and r1*r2*x moles of carbonate. The total moles of
these species are then x( 1 + r1 + r1*r2) = S. This is solvable for x as x
= S/(1 + rt1 + r1*r2)
which is the moles of carbonic, r1*S/(1 + r1 + r1*r2) is the moles of
bicarbonate and r1*r2*S/(1 + r1 + r1*r1) is the moles of carbonate. To get
values S must be determined.


Alkalinity is defined as the sum of the bicarbonate concentration plus
twice the sum of the carbonate concentration (plus the hydroxyl
concentration minus the hydronium concentration but these last two can
usually be ignored). Thus
A = r1*S/D + 2*r1*r2*S/D + 10^(14-pH) where we have simplified by defining
D = (1 + r1 + r1*r1). This is solved for S by S = D*(A - 10^(pH-14))/(r1 +
2*r1*r2)


The water in question has total alkalinity as CaCO3 of 55 mg/l. As the
molecular weight of CaCO3 is 100 this amounts to 55/100 = 0.55 millimoles
per litre. This is the total alkalinity, A. As 10^(pH-14) = 0.06 millimole
it can, as we said, be ignored. At such a high pH the hydronium
concentration is definitely too small to consider. Thus S =
3425.6089*.55/4218.9499 = 0.4466 millimoles. Then x = S/D = 0.13
micromoles/l, bicarbonate is r1 times this or 0.3429 millimoles/l and
carbonic r2 times this or 0.1036 millimoles/l. These values in millimoles/l
can be converted back to ppm as CaCO3 simply by multiplying by 100 to get
34.29 ppm bicarb and 10.36 ppm carbonate.


To "neutralize" these species you will need .3429 millimoles/l hydronium
for the bicarbonate and 2*.1036 = .2072 millimoles/l for the carbonate for
a total of .5501 millimoles per litre. Does that number look familiar?


An alkalinity of 55 ppm as CaCO3 is not that bad. The rule of thumb is to
have less than 50. Also 17 ppm Ca isn't that low. It is 17/40 = .427
millimoles per litre. If each of those calcium ions  reacted with phytin to
produce one hydronium ion you would come close to neutralizing your
alkalinity. I would, therefore try gypsum before fooling around with acids
unless you are doing beers in which the sulfate is already high. You might
try testing a quart or two of mash with gypsum to see what happens. If you
do decide to try acid (lactic, phosphoric and hydrochloric are good choices
except that your chloride is already pretty high), be careful as it is
possible to overshoot although the buffering system of the mash itself will
give you some protection.


Seems this ought to be in a FAQ somewhere.

Subject: SUDS Alert! User-correctable error


Dear Friends, this post is for users of Mike Taylor's SUDS program for
Windows--if that isn't you, page down now.  After all the hoo-hah about
the various ways to do IBU calcs and my post just the other day in which I
favorably commented on the way SUDS incorporated the results of that
hoo-hah, it turns out that there is an error in the data files that the
program uses to do the calcs, which Andy Walsh and I stumbled across
yesterday.  That's the bad news--the good news is that because of the way
Mike Taylor redid the way the program calculates IBUs in version 4, we can
all correct the error ourselves, and he has asked me to put the net.word
out on this.  What happened is that Mike put the wrong values in the file
containing Glenn Tinseth's utilization data--Mark Garetz's numbers are
there instead.  So in order to use the Tinseth data (which are my personal
favorites), we need to edit the files and put the correct numbers in
there. 


Now, there are three data files for each of the three authors' data: Rager,
Tinseth, and Garetz.  This is because Mike chose to give the option for
using Garetz's 5% fudge factor for the flocculation characteristics of
yeast. So there is a Rager average flocculation, low flocculation, and high
flocculation file; similarly there are three files for Tinseth and three
for Rager.  These files have some text at the top, saying "This table is
based on figures of..." then a line of ====, and below that a table of
numbers, in the form minutes and utilization percent, e.g. "10    5%". 
Here is what the Tinseth average flocc data, in the file avgtin.ibu, 
SHOULD look like:


5             5%
10            6%
15            8%
20           10%
25           12%
30           15%
35           19%
40           23%
45           24%
50           25%
60           26%


If you want to use the Garetz 5% fudge factor for flocculation (I love
alliteration), then edit the hitin.ibu and lotin.ibu files, adding 5% for
high flocculation and subtracting 5% for low flocculation.  When editing
the files, be sure you include that percent sign, otherwise you will have
problems.


Mike says he's sorry for any confusion (although no one had tried to
contact him on this so far, so it could be worse), and future releases will
have the right data in the right files.  I hope this post is enough to put
anyone who was scratching their head on the right track.

Hello all,


Just wanted to put my two cents into the Wyeast 3068 discussion. I've brewed
about eight batches of all-grain, and the first to blow the airlock and spew
forth during fermentation was this yeast. The beer was a wheat with 50% wheat
malt, so perhaps this is to be expected. 


Unfortunately, the beer didn't finish well - it stopped after three weeks at
1.012, which is a good deal higher than expected. It has quite the malty
taste, too! (Though I intend to drink it!)

I've been doing oven mashing since my first all grain batch in 1979 or
so.  I was surprised to see it as a new tip in this month's zymurgy.  I
thought I read it in Dave Line, who suggests overnight mashing, which I
use to do, but I just checked his "Big Book on Brewing," and there's no
mention.  He suggests covering the mash pot with blankets, so maybe I
just figured it out myself to keep an even temperature overnight.


Anyway, I always set the oven temperature to 150^F, and I've never had
any trouble such as David is concerned about - just rock steady mash
temperatures.  And I open the oven several times to stir, check
temperature and pH, taste, etc.  Then I mashout on a propane cooker
(formerly stovetop), then carefully ladle the mash to my insulated
Zapap.  I must confess to thinking about adapting my 10 gallon aluminum
pot to RIMS to avoid all of this, and it is too big to fit in the oven.

Is Klages malt fully modified? Do I need to do a protein rest with this malt,
if I'm not really concerned about chill haze? I've heard some people say that
it's not fully modified and you need to do a protein rest, while others just
do a single-step infusion.

Subject: Digital Thermometer/Timer Review




I just received a Digital Thermometer/Timer from a mail order company 
named Improvements 800 642-2112 that I think is perfect for all-grain 
brewing.


It is a small LCD unit with a S/S probe at the end of a 4 ft. cable 
designed to remotely read the internal temp of a roast in the oven. The 
probe is shaped like a candy cane so it'll hang 6 1/2 inched down from 
the rim of a kettle but I'll probably mount it to a stirring paddle.


The temp range is 32F to 248F and you can set an alarm to go off when 
any temperature in that range is reached. I found it to be fast to 
stabilize and reasonably well calibrated. It read a steady 34 in ice 
water, 99 under the tongue and fluctuated between 212 and 214 in boiling 
water(mostly 212).


It also has a countdown timer/alarm mode with a range of 1 sec to 100 
hours. 


Cost: $30 with 6 mo. warrantee. It works for me.

 i just bottled a batch of M&F wheat beer. i am new at this micro/pico brewing
thing, so i have a question. all of the wheat beers (all be it a small number)
i've had, have all been a light/golden color. is the M&F supposed to be a darker
color...not like a stout, but definately not golden in color. i did not stand
over the wort and stir constantly...a collective gasp...so therefore burnt 
residue was on the bottom of the pan. i am guessing that this burning 
contributed to the color. am i correct?


 i want to buy a "kit" which come with DME. i have read a few posts that have
had bad results with this? is this common? if so, is there anything you can do
to minimize/eliminate such results? should i just double the extract syrup?


 i also want to try a john bull australian style extract. anyone enjoy this

Subject: Bottled Yeast/False Bottom


Rob in Montreal asked about the life span of bottled yeast. I use the same
'parallel propagation' technique that is outlined in the yeast FAQ. The one
and only problem I have encountered so far is that I tend to have too much
yeast on hand. I brewed this past weekend and used a starter prepared
from a bottle of Wyeast #1968 that I bottled approx. 6 months ago. These
bottles have been refrigerated all the while. The starter came to life
quickly and the lag time in the 23 litre batch was less than 12 hours (it
took off sometime during the night). So far I have not found a bottled yeast
that did not take off and I have also not had any infection problems. I
recently picked up a bottle of Blanche de Bruges for the yeast and did not
realize till I was drinking it that the best before date was August 1993!
It was slow to start but it did get going eventually. The behavior was 
identical to the Wyeast wit strain. It looks as though bottled yeast can 
remain viable for fairly long periods.


As for Jim Powell's question regarding false bottoms. I would strongly
recommend the copper manifold approach. Very easy to construct and quite
efficient. I made one about a year ago and I'm sold.

Subject: RE: Terminal Gravity / SUDS


Greetings from the swamp lands of Texas,


The question posed by Larry Bristol sparked another idea. I am wondering if 
there are any style criteria for FG. I use SUDS for my recipe formulations 
which gives me a target OG, color, IBU, and Alcohol range but does not 
provide info on proper FG or typical grain bill (specialty grains and %) 
for the style. I would hate to make a scotch ale with a FG of 1010 or a 
light lager with FG 1025 but I don't have the information to know what is 
correct. This is probably the weakest part of my brewing knowlage (except 
understanding FOOP, or microbiology, or water chemestry, or ...). 


Are there any sources that give typical characteristics (OG, FG, Color,

I have a suggestion for a SUDS x.0 that is a turn in a different direction. 


"SUDS for idiots"


Give me slide switches that adjust the OG, FG, IBU, and color within a 
particular style (or maybe within 150% of the style for the contest 
winners) and let the computer figure out the grain bill, hop schedule, mash 
schedule, and fermintation schedule. Every time a program designer lets me 
put "GARBAGE IN" I get "GARBAGE OUT" (or beer that only I will drink). A 
little AI (Artificial Inteligence) would make up for my LI (lack of ...), 
and I would gladly give up creativity and imagination for good beer.

I don't know.  "They" say it's got something to do with proteins.  I really
don't know.  


I am thinking of two particular batches, one steam beer the 
other a Weizen.  The weizen had a FG of 1.007, the steam of 1.006.  The weizen
had much less body than the steam.  The steam had a higher OG, for what it's
worth.  I can't say for sure why these two beers differed in body as much as
they did.  I can say I liked them both very much, and I prefer my wheat beers
a little 'lite' tasting.

I'd guess not, but can't say for sure.  The last four beers my friend Jake has
made all had the same OG, by coincidence.  I'll talk to him about it, because
I think they have varied in FG.

Maybe, but I doubt it.


> What does the collective wisdom have to say?


I see what you're trying to achieve, that's a way to scale mouthfeel.  I don't
believe that it's very accurate to try and capture mouthfeel on a unitary 
scale.  I could see a stout and a doppelbock which could be rated as equally
'thick' but there's a different quality to the feel.  Of course, the same is
true of color, and they have a scale for that, so why not mouthfeel?  Still, 
I think the best we'd be able to achieve for mouthfeel is a subjective rating
system based on accepted standards.  Maybe the sensory epithelia in the mouth 
that contribute to mouthfeel operate on a principle as 'simple' as 
photoreceptors, so that an objective measure based on chemical composition 
could be devised, but I doubt that it's worth the time and effort that would
be required.

This sounds very interesting, but I would make one caution.  Much of the seed
sold to farmers is treated for various pests, even the seed sold for cattle
feed.  I personally don't want anything extra going into my beer.  You can
certainly find non-treated grain, and I hope yours was, but the problem is
that you can't verify it.  I'm currently using some wheat from a commercial
feed mill, and was told it is pure clean wheat, no chemicals.  I trust these
people and I guess I'm just suggesting you make sure you deal with folks you
can trust.  Regarding the home malting, details, give us details!

I can attest to this.  I use two different water heater elements, which are
purported to be about 35K BTU, and they work fine.  I have no trouble
reaching any level of boil that I desire, from just bubbling, to a major
rolling boil.  The only thing I probably lack compared to the rocket engines
is the ability to hit the boil in under 10 seconds, and I also go many many
batches between propane fills.

Many people use a 'bottling bucket' which is not quite as nice as a fermenter.
Many people's bottling buckets are their old fermenters.  Mine is actually my

Hmm...  Pour it in, and stir with your racking cane, and let it settle for an
hour?  I don't know.  I'd just get another receptacle.  Maybe you could do it
in two parts in your boiling kettle.  (I'm assuming you have a small kettle,

Use fruit woods because their flavor is more subtle and not 
overpowering like mesquite. I have had great results smoking
grains for two hours while maintaining a temperature between
100 to 120 degrees. I smoke my grains dry and hand stir every
15 minutes. I don't wet my grain because I'm afraid of  trans-
forming the pale ale malt into crystal-like malt. (I smoke a lot
of salmon and the fish must be dried after the brining process
before it is smoked. )

Subject: Lautering setups


A number of new all-grainers have asked about lautering setups (false
bottoms, etc).  I haven't seen slotted manifolds mentioned in a while,
so I thought I'd present the idea again as an alternative.


In short, you use pieces of 1/2" hard copper tubing with slots cut in
one side, a slot every half inch or so.  You connect the pieces using
copper T's, elbows, and endcaps to make a manifold in whatever
configuration fits in your vessel.  Put the manifold, slots down, in the
vessel and attach to the drain spigot, and bingo!  You have a lauter
tun.  If you don't have a spigot, just add an elbow and one more section
of pipe that sticks up out of the mash, and siphon the wort out.


More complete plans are in the all-grain FAQ in the archives at
ftp.stanford.edu.  If for some reason you can't access them, send me
email.


In answer to a specific query of jpowell`at`surgery.bsd.uchicago.edu (James
Powell), I would very much recommend *against* using wood in the
construction of any lautering equipment.  Wood is porous, and will
absorb wort and be liable to harbor infections.


On another subject... he's back!  Even a Denver newspaper columnist had
a blurb telling people to *stop sending cards to Craig Shergold*.  I
don't know how Make-A-Wish got messed up in this, but I feel sorry for
them.

*Larry Bristol on OG, FG, and mouthfeel issues:
- ----------------------------------------------
<a tremendous emphasis is placed on OG...FG seems to be of little importance>


I think this is because it is much more *easily* controlled, at least by 
beginners such as myself.  It's trivial to determine the OG from the 
onset of the brew session, and with software such as SUDS I think it's 
even easier to predict OG to within a few points.  Altho SUDS also does a 
very good job with FG in my experience, there are more factors that can 
change it more dramatically.


<Assuming...full attenuation, does the FG represent [a] measure of...
protein/dextrine...in the beer, and therefore...mouthfeel?>


I argue: Yes and No.  "Yes" if you are talking about a "class" of worts built
from similar or identical ingredients.  For example, if you have a typical 
pale ale bill of pale malt and some 40L crystal.  Suppose you make three 
different batches having different proportions of these two ingredients, 
all with the same OG:


  Pale ale malt:  7 lbs    This recipe yields OG = 42 and FG = 11
    40L crystal:  1 lb     according to SUDS 4.0


  Pale ale malt:  6 lbs    This recipe also yields OG = 42, and
    40L crystal:2.2 lbs    SUDS says FG = 11 as well


Now, I *think* you'll find in practice these two recipes may indeed 
produce the same OG (I have no trouble believing that), BUT I doubt they 
will yield the same FG using the same yeast--just my intuition which may 
be wrong, of course.  My claim is that, in this case, the FG may NOT be 
the same and may indeed be an indicator of mouthfeel/body.


OTOH, "no" if you're comparing two beers of completely different classes
having identical OGs.  For example, take:


  Pale ale malt: 6.2 lbs   SUDS says this recipe produces OG = 42
 Chocolate malt: 1 lb      (and it also says it will have FG = 11)
   Black patent: 1 lb


I think I'm on very safe turf speculating this brew *will not* finish at 
11 per SUDS--my estimate is it will finish at LEAST as high as 15-18.  I 
ask some of the rcb posters (who would view this as a perfectly acceptable
stout recipe, BTW) to brew this crap up and see what they get.  As a data 
point, I have a very nice "transition" stout that finished at 20 and 
which has a very light, dry feel (very dry, in fact).  This beer gives NO 
sense of having swigged from an Aunt Jemima bottle (I reserve such high
praise for only my finest creations).


My point: apples and oranges just can't be compared.  Also, "complete
attentuation" was assumed as the baseline for Larry's post, but this term
only has meaning from the perspective of a particular yeast.  Again, two
beers which are both "completely fermented" can only be compared (on the 
basis of FG) if they were done with yeasts of comparable attenuation.  


FINALLY, 'I read somewhere' possibly in Miller's TCOHB where the author
cited DeClerck as having "proven" that dextrins do not contribute to
body/mouthfeel.  Anyone else ever see that or have a source?


*Rob Emenecker on aluminum brewpots (but NOT Alzheimer's):
- ---------------------------------------------------------


<my understanding is welding is out of the question with aluminum...>


Aluminum is weldable and welded aluminum is as common as welded steel.  A 
good welder could do a gorgeous job for you, if you could find a proper 
fitting for the pot.  However, you *can* simply drill a hole and use a 
flange-bulkhead thru fitting, but you may have trouble finding such a 
fitting with gaskets that will seal under the tight radius of the pot and 
that can take the temperatures well.  Teflon gaskets would be the perfect 
choice--I have not seen such a fitting that would work on such a curved 
surface--but apparently the EasyMasher (TM) in fact does.  Don't know.


*Kenneth Whitney askes what to do with an SS keg:
- -------------------------------------------------


Cut the top out and make a fermenter if you need one for 10 gal.  The dip
tube can be cut off to make a gorgeous, unbreakable hydrometer jar by
covering one end with a rubber cap or plugging with a solid rubber stopper.
They cool quickly under the faucet, and never break.


*RIMS FAQ Ideas:
- ---------------


Various folks have suggest they'd be interested in [some sort of] a RIMS 
FAQ, but many of the suggesters are already RIMS weenies.  So far I've 
only come up with one Frequently Asked Question, and that's the old "what 
does RIMS stand for and what is it?".


In any case, I'll volunteer to collect the questions from the HBD and rcb 
communities, and to put together the paper.  I would need help from 
experienced RIMS builders and users (I've only build and used a manual 
RIMS--most folks think automated feedback control ala Morris).  I will 
also ask M Stevens and K Lutzen if they would put and html RIMS document 
on their Brewery site.  Send me your questions, ideas, and FAQ *answers* 
and I'll try my best to consolidate, etc.  Your sources for electronics 
and plumbing, with phone number of source, items acquired, etc., would also 
be helpful--RIMS folks are just 90's gear- and chip-heads, you know.

use these to swap the inside of your kettle and react the mercury to a more

Subject: Brewcap or Fermentap


I am trying to find someone who used the Brewcap or the Fermentap to use
a 5 gallon carboy for Primary, Secondary and Bottling.


It sounds like a great idea, but is it any easier? and how do you prime
it? Please respond with private mail to
jeffrey.t.anderson`at`x400gw.ameritech.com


Thanks :)
