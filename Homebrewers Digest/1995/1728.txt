Hey! I saw that! Off the digest! Off the digest! Burn him at the 
stake!!!! (Or soak him in water, and smoke him with coriander using

>Larry Bristol continues to challenge us with what our mouths feel...


Well, here's my $.02 (Why don't they put cents-keys on these stupid 
things?!?):


I remember reading an article several years back on the subject of 
'Engineering Food Appeal'. Addressed in this article were such things 
as appearance, and mouth feel.  (The most memorable aspect of the 
article was a discussion about 'non-nutritive food varnishes'. Yuk!)  
This article also bemoaned the elusiveness of some 'measure' of  
mouthfeel.


Personally, I don't think it is as simple as just observing gravities 
to  determine the 'thickness' of feel.  Just as flavors are made up 
of  taste AND aroma, I believe mouth-feel to be made of of several    
components.  Not simply a measure of the density (how thick).         
Different compounds in the beer contribute different sensations to 
the  palate, tongue, gums, cheeks, etc. all contributing to the 'feel'. 
Sugars, proteins, alcohols, etc.  Reactions within the mouth between  
beer compounds and saliva might also contribute - a high gravity 
compound may react with  saliva in your mouth creating a light feel,  
for example  (supposition on my part).


So I guess it comes down to this: If two beers start with different 
OGs, and end with the same FGs - or vice versa - one wouldn't 
necessarily have 'more or less mouthfeel' than the other, but they'd 
most likely 'feel' different. This feeling being more dependant on 
the chemical make-up (_recipe_) than the final gravity.

Subject: Al brewpots II




In HBD #1726 Rob Emenecker asked about putting a valve in
an Al brewpot which reminded me of a question I wanted to
ask.  I've found a good source of 32 qt Al pots and was
thinking of buying one for my boiling kettle (I currently
do partial boils in a 22 qt pot).  But living in an apartment
I'm limited to my stovetop so my question is is it practical
to boil 6-7 gal of wort using an electric stove?  How long
is it going to take to reach boil and am I going to be able
to sustain a rolling boil for 60-90 min?  What are the 
experiences of you stove-top brewers.


I'm also planning on converting my old kettle to a mash/lauter
tun so, Rob, I'd appreciate it if you could post a summary to
your question.

Subject: Gravity and mouthfeel


Dear Friends, in HBD 1726 Larry Bristol ponders, Zen-like, the various
relationships between OG, FG, and thickness/mouthfeel, etc., and wonders
if these things are quantifiable.  I'd say not.  First, it is very
difficult to predict FG for every case, although many brewers can through
experience and repeating a series of similar batches--especially
commercial breweries who make the same things over and over.  But even
they frequently resort to blending batches for ultimate commercial release
because things don't always work out the same.  Second, the amount of
alcohol has a strong effect on the mouthfeel of a batch. Using Larry's two
examples: two beers with the same FG of 1010, but different OGs of 1040
and 1060, will have very different mouthfeel, even if they are ostensibly
very similar types of beer (say pale ale).  The one that started at 1060
will have its mouthfeel decreased owing to the larger amount of alcohol
(i.e. it will be thinner-feeling); however, I seem to recall that it is
written somewhere that alcohol enhances the perception of sweetness, and
that this may actually enhance the mouthfeel, but that seems
counterintuitive to me and does not fit with my experience.  The second
example, with two beers of the same OG but one finishing at 1010 and the
other at 1015, is more straightforward.  I think it is nearly a given
(again all else being nearly equal) that the 1015 beer will have more
mouthfeel, but most of this would be due to increased sweetness.  That
difference in sweetness would be readily discernible, but different
tasters might characterize it in different ways. 


Which brings me to my final point: this issue is so highly subjective that
trying to quantify it may be, although brave and Zen-like, doomed to
failure.  What one person identifies as "body" another might call
"sweetness", not because one is a better taster than the other, but how
and what different people can taste has such a wide range.  The range of
subtleties available in finished beer is enormous.  How many of us have
tried to duplicate a recipe that we really liked, doing everything exactly
the same so far as we could manage, and have the result be subtly
different?  Let us know, Larry, if you work this out, so we can award you
the Nobel Prize in Brewing! 


PS Wade W.'s post on subtle ads reminds me of a line of Steven Wright's: 
"I saw a subliminal advertising executive today...but only for a second."

Subject: Steeping Grains Question


     All,
     
     I am moving up to partial grain brewing and have a question when a 
     recipe calls for "steeping" the specialty grains.
     
     I have been led to believe that one adds the grains to cold water, 
     heat to boiling, then strain out as much grains as possible, then add 
     your malts, hops, and adjuncts.
     
     Now, others are telling me add the grains, then bring the temperature 
     up to ??? (I've heard 150, 155, 170) degrees and remove before 
     boiling.
     
     What is the correct procedure and what might be the implications or 
     consequences of doing one versus the other.
     
     TIA

Subject: Aeration during lauter


I need help.  


All my beers seem to have a consistently high level of what I perceive
as DMS.  While I don't always find this objectionable, I have become 
frustrated, and feel that I must have a procedural flaw.


1.  While lautering, I let my sweet wort splash mightily down into
a bucket (as the brewkettle is currently holding the sparge liquor).
Is this aeration causing big-time HSA?  Do I just *think* that wet
cardboard really tastes like canned corn?  Seems like my 75-90 minute
boils would cure ills introduced at this stage.


2.  I use corny kegs for fermenters, and I endeavor to be meticulous
about sanitation.  I use iodophor, let it air *almost completely* dry,
and don't rinse.  Problem anyone?  Did we ever reach closure about the
effects of fermenter geometry on flavor profile?


3.  I do almost exclusively classic British styles, with a single
infusion at 150-154F.  Is it possible/likely that my thermometer is
so far off that I am really mashing at 160F+ and getting *tons* of
unfermentables as a result?  FG is usually in the 1.010-1.015 range
for pales.  I use a maltmill(tm) and zapap system, but my yields
have always been below expectation (20-25 p/g/p).


Any public or private problem-solving help gratefully accepted.

Subject:  Bottling beer?


P.Hannah`at`cqu.edu.au (Paul Hannah)in Homebrew Digest #1726 (May 09, 1995)
asks about bottling beer.  If you must do it (I prefer Kegs, even simple
plastic ones), then it *IS* much faster to use a second container to prime.
A second fermenter can be used (I use another plastic fermenter, without a
problem so far [reaching for some wood to touch!]), but I assume that any
large enough sterile container would do.  It should be food grade and and
possibly not metal to avoid metallic flavours.  This may not be an issue as
it will only be in there for about 30 -60 minutes, will be cold etc.


Earlier discussions on HBD suggested mixing by pouring the priming syrup
into the base of the container and then using the siphon pipe to  mix as
well as fill the container. This is done by placing sufficient pipe flat at
the bottom of the container to form a circular motion of the liquid as it
enters the container. This circular motion swirls up through the syrup into
the beer and provides a pretty good mix. I lay piping flat for about 2/3 of
the base to achieve this effect.


I understand that there is advantage in reducing oxidation of the liquid at
this time.  This can occur from excessive splashing of the liquid as it
enters the container.  Laying the pipe flat will assist with this also.
Some people have equipent that allows them to lay a blanket of carbon
dioxide above the syrup.  This is meant to reduce oxidation too.


As you say, mix the sugar, DME or whatever with boiling water to dissove
and also assist with reducing the number of bugs that will be introduced.
I let this cool in my glass jug with a lid over it (usually clingfilm) and
place in the container when warm, not too hot.  I think that if I put it in
too hot, it will impart plasticy flavours to the beer.


This process takes away the problem of trying to emulate an octopus whilst
struggling to keep yeast and similar muck out of the siphon tube, keeping
the primary fermenter at an angle at the bottom to maximise usable beer,
and at the same time filling the bottle between your knees!  It also saves
the hassle (particularly with DME) of getting the priming sugar into the
bottle through the funnel that keeps blocking from the moisture in the
bottles atmosphere.  Blowing through the funnel tends to increase potential
infection as will wire coat hangers.


Your concern over buying a second caboy may be misfounded.  You could try a
plastic fermenter instead, or any container big enough and meeting the
criteria specified above. My father has brewed wine and beer in plastic
dustbins (garbage containers?) for years and simply avoids the dark
coloured ones (not to be recommended unless they are food grade).  I have
managed to get (free) some large plastic containers from the local bakers,
used to supply the fruit gunk they put in with the artificial cream in the
cakes.


Someone with more "knowledge than I, may wish to comment on the probability
of a metal container affecting flavour at this stage, and for a short time
(say 1 hour).


The above is a simplified recommendation and I hope it helps.  All the
above comments are the results of listening (lurking?) to this Digest so
thanks should be given to all those unknown brewers who I have not
acknowledged (sorry) who have improved my brewing immensely.  Thank you!


Any errors in the above are mine and should be corrected (gently please!).
They are through ignorance (lack of understanding) of the technical
processes, rather than a desire to ignite yet another flame war.

Also remember a brewery is not a large sterile facility, it is a plant, a

Subject: microwaves and dry hops


Hello,
Just a note on microwave sanitising.
It sounds like nobody is about to do this since
it has been discredited, but whatever you do, do *not*
microwave your dryhops for sanitation purposes.
I did this once about a year ago and got a really bitter,
astringent character in the beer that was not there before
I did this stupid thing. The microwaves must have superheated
the resident water in the hops (pellets) and isomerised the acids
or something. Boy that beer was bad. The funny thing is
that I didn't realise for a long time what I had done to cause
this! Some strange mental block...

I'd like to go a little further along than just Klages malt. 
Is there not a table around somewhere of malt/modification/nitrogen 
level/etc? My feeble memory seems to recall seeing such a table 
in either Brewing Techniques or Zymurgy. Are the Europeon/Belgian
malts really not fully modified? It would seem that malting fully
modified malt would be standard practice now.

Hi All,


I've been considering purchasing a SABCO converted keg with the specially 
modified EasyMasher (specifically for the SABCO) and using this for my mash- 
and lauter-tuns.  The one drawback I see would be stirring the mash 
effectively without damaging the EasyMasher.  The other concern is weight---I 
frequently rely on direct heating the mash on the stovetop to maintain exact 
temperatures---Will this thing crush my stove, thereby inciting a violent 
outburst from my wife?  Could someone with experience 
using such a setup please write and squelch my apprehension?  This would be 
the first piece of equipment on my quest for the ultimate 3-tiered system and 
it's rather expensive----I can't afford to waste any money right now.  Any 
and all advice is appreciated.

Norm also sung the praises of 35K burners:


HH> I can attest to this.  I use two different water heater elements, which are

I've tried the cajun cooker rocket engines, they heated fast and left *lots* of 
soot on the bottom of my boil kettle.


I use a Brinkmans. It is a tripod about 3 feet high and has a large heavy duty 
cast iron commercial burner suspended under the iron ring upon which the kettle 
sits. There is an air/gas mixture slide and it comes with a needle valve 
regulator for extremely fine flame tuning. It is rated at 160K. The only
problem was, I used to use *lots* of propane.


The burner element, which probably weighs 5 pounds, is adjustable; you can move 
it closer or farther away from the bottom of the pot. I found that by moving
the burner to the adjustment setting closest to the bottom of the kettle, I
more than halved my propane use, and the time required to bring liquid to a
boil shortened considerably.

Subject: Open fermentation


There was a thread going (#1720 etc) about open fermentation, to
cover or not to cover. I thought I'd cast my vote to cover.
Seems my gear was down the basement and someone knocked the lid
off my plastic fermenter. I was down the basement doing other
stuff and noticed a somewhat foul but somewhat sweet odor. 
There, in the fermenter, was a dead bat. Nice looking little
guy; starting to mummify. Seems like a strong argument against
uncovered open-fermentation (unless you're looking for a *very*
interesting lambic ;-)  I thought I'd make labels for the next 
batch I brew as "Bat's in the Belfry". 


I sterilized the fermenter, but should I throw it out ... aaack

Try decoction mashing.  I assume your one all-grain was an infusion mash.
 Decoction is a bit more of a pain in the neck, but I'm pretty sure it's the
traditional method for those malty german beers like oktoberfests and I know
it's suggested for weizens (if not, I'm sure someone will correct me (set
flamethrowers to low, I already toasted my winter-pale skin in Santa
Barbara)).  I've tried it a couple of times and had very malty results.


My doppelbock is actually a little too malty sweet (it finished around
1.030).  I've thought about trying the enzyme addition discussed here last
week, but I don't want to end up with Duff's Doppelbock Dry.  Can I control
the amount of enzyme activity by using a low dose?  My gut feeling is that
activity will be almost independent of dose since I think enzymes are
catalysts and catalysts are not consumed in the reaction.

I built one of these counter-flow chillers that has the coiled
copper in the PVC pipe.  I designed it so the water flows the opposite
direction of the wort flow in the copper tube, and also tried to set-up
a spiral of the water inside the PVC using 90 degree elbows inside the
thing (in theory it sounds cool, but...).  The whole thing is about 24
inches long with ~30 feet of 3/8 copper coiled into a 2 inch diameter
coil with each coil about 1/2 inch apart.  The PVC pipe is 4 inches in
diameter and the coil is centered perfectly down the length of the PVC
tube.


A test run with boiling water showed that it chilled the water to within
10 degrees.  However, when I ran hot wort thru it, it only came within
~30 degrees of the cooling water.  I finally realized that the wort was
thicker than the water and the cooling efficency wouldn't be the same.


My question is how have others built theirs and how close do you get
your wort to the water temp that is cooling it?


I've seen these things advertised by HB shops as being able to cool
within 5 degrees of the cooling water....and they are smaller than mine.
Does anybody know how the store models are constructed?


And to thwart some replies: I've been using the immersion type for
the last 20+ batches and would rather not do the garden hose trick.


Please post back to the HBD as I'm sure there are some others
that would like the info.

Wheat Beer Color


Saw a note yesterday on Wheat beer color.  I have made 3
batches of wheat beer so far.  I didn't use kit's I just
experimented.  I made a 25% dry wheat and 75% dry light
extract.  Another was 50/50 and another 75/25.  I will get
to 100% wheat soon.  I know that 100% light extract
makes a pale beer, and like Larry I have noticed that
all wheat beers seem to be light.  Some how all my beer's
have been darker in color.  I assumed the blending might have
something to do with it since the mixture was dark even before
it began to cook.  So far the taste has been good.  All
I have to say is that wheat beer does require a lot of
hops to get the flavor right.

First, a minor correction.  Adjuncts typically refer to the unmalted grains
or cereals added to the mash, such as maize, rice, or oats.  Crystal malt and
carapils are  malted barley , so they would not be considered adjuncts as
such.   Sorry if that sounds like a flame.  It's not.


Second, although the addition of crystal malt and cara pils may make your
beer better, I would suggest you try using a different strain of yeast.
 Though I lack the knowledge off the top of my head, I do know that different
strains have different flavor profiles that they produce.  Some strains do
favor malt flavor and aroma production.  I'm sure that somewhere in the
archives there is  a text on the matter.  Now that I think of it, I have the
information somewhere in my files.  You can e-mail me directly and I'll send
you the yeast text that I have. 


As long as your brews have been wonderful then I wouldn't worry too much.

Subject: Wyeast 1338, Death by Mead, Ovens


     Two of my recent batches have been fairly high gravity (1.072, 1.080) 
     ales fermented with Wyeast 1338 European ale yeast.  There is a 
     strongly alcoholic (hot on the tongue), harsh cidery taste in both of 
     these beers that I can't identify.  If you've ever tried to drink a 
     mead when it was too young, you know what I mean.  Both were all-grain 
     with no adjuncts.  Both were fermented at an ambient temperature of 
     70F, with the fermometer reading 72F during primary fermentation.  Is 
     this high enough to cause this type of off-taste?  After 6 weeks in 
     the bottle, it is fading, but still detectable.
     
     Speaking of mead, last weekend, I got a little carried away with the 
     batch I made almost a year ago.  The reputation mead has for hangovers 
     is unfortunately very, very true; maybe understated.  It is a markedly 
     different experience than I have ever had with beer, wine, or anything 
     else.  I have no idea what causes this, but warning labels will be 
     required for all future meads....
     
     For the people who put their kettle in the oven for insulation, does 
     your kettle really lose that much heat during the mash?  I just cover 
     mine and check it periodically during a 1 - 1.5 hour mash.  The 
     temperature drop is usually very little.  I never turn the burner back 
     on.  If necessary, I add a quart or so of water that I'm heating for 
     the sparge on the next burner.  I've never had a problem maintaining 
     temperature.  On the other hand, overnight mashing sounds pretty 
     interesting.  Does anybody do this?  Pros and cons???

Subject: Re:  FG,OG, & mouthfeel


Just to confuse matters further:


Don't forget that carbonation levels play an important part in the perception of
mouthfeel.  Mouthfeel, in fact, is a very subjective sensation.


Given the subjective nature and complexity of "mouthfeel," it is probably 
unreasonable to expect a single number or parameter (like FG) to characterize 
the phenomenon.


On the other hand, we DO simplify color to a single parameter (transmittance, I 
believe).  So maybe it would not be unreasonable to do the same for mouthfeel.  
Perhaps some standardized test could be developed such as de-gassing a given 
quantity of beer, then measuring its viscosity (for example).


I am still dubious as to what value this would have in the homebrewing 
community, however.  Opinions?

Russel Mast asks about the relation between FG and "body". I would guess that
two beers with equal *alcohol content* as well as FG would have similar
"body" or "mouthfeel". But remember, higher alcohol=> lower FG even with
the same amount of proteins in the beer because alcohol is less dense than
water. Body and mouthfeel seem to be pretty subjective terms, and to try
and semi-quantify them with measures such as FG is useful, but let's 
keep in mind that they probably are not totally precise. But then again, one  
of the main draws for me in this hobby is that there is room for fuzziness
(not just in my head) and subjectivity.

Subject: stuck fermentation FAQ


On the urging of an HBD subscriber, I have expanded a post I once
wrote on "Stuck" fermentations and sent it to Stephen to have it put
into the archives.  It can be found in:


/pub/clubs/homebrew/docs/stuck_fermentation.faq


Check the header of any HBD to learn how to access the archives.


I've also sent a copy of this FAQ to Spencer to put into "Spencer's
Beer Page" on the WWW.  The URL is:

Subject: Smoking grain


Well, it's hard to keep lit [rimshot] but seriously, folks:


I've been making smoked beers for about 5 years, and they
always get good reviews, so here's what I know.


1. It's not necessary to moisten the grain before smoking.
   That will make it take up more smoke flavor, but you
   really have to experiment to find out how much you like.


2. If you do moisten it, you must let it dry thoroughly
   before crushing it. I use a schmidmill, and smoked grain
   that's even a tiny bit damp will gum up the works and
   make a mess. If you have one of the earlier schmidmill
   models, as I did, it will even stop.


3. Some people crush the malt before smoking it, and that
   may work better for you, depending on your equipment.
   I don't use that technique, because I smoke it in a
   wire basket in a backyard-type smoker.


4. The best compromise in how much to smoke is about 1/4
   to 1/3 of the base malt. Much more, and the heat of the
   smoking process will kill enough enzymes that your
   extraction rate may really suffer.


5. Hickory will give you a great "bacon or smoked cheese"
   taste. Personally, I like that, but many people find it
   overpowering.


6. Mesquite will give you a very subtle sweetness that
   accentuates a sweet beer very nicely. I recently made
   a mesquite-smoked rye maibock that turned out well.


7. Apple will also give you a sweet note, along with a
   fruity one. Nice in any Bavarian style beer.


8. Beechwood is, of course, the original, used in the real
   Bamberg rauchbiers. In Bamberg, it's intensely smoky,
   while the imported Schlenkerla is more subdued. Both
   are, IMHO, to die for.


9. Mixtures of different kinds of wood are a good idea,
   because they give a complexity to the beer.


Honestly, you have to experiment to find out how much of
a smoke character you like in your beer. Once you have a
few batches under your belt though, I can guarantee that
you'll make more!


Now go smoke 'em if you've got 'em.
