Subject: Corrections & Question: Water


In my post on water chemistry in #1727 I  made a typo and then copied and
pasted it to duplicate the error. It's pretty obvious (though I didn't spot
it, Darren did) but D = (1 + r1 + r1*r2). The post has (1 + r1 + r1*r1) in
two places. It should be (1 + r1 + r1*r2) in both.


Bob Hall contacted me and suggested that my definition of ppm as CaCO3 (55
mg/l)/(100 g/mole) = 0.55 millimole/l is incorrect and should be based on
normality rather than molarity i.e. it should be (55 mg/l) / (50
g/equivalent) = 1.10 milliequivalent/l. If this be correct then all values
in millimoles in the original post should be doubled and replaced by
milliequivalents. The milliequivalents should be multiplied by 50 to get
back to ppm as CaCO3. The acid required is thus 1.1 milliequivalent/l and
as normality and molarity of hydronium are the same this is 1.1 millimole
of acid. Nothing is changed except the defintion of ppm as CaCO3.


I took the definition I used (molar) from "Principals of Brewing Science"
and find it very appealing in that one gets to multiply and divide by 100
in going back and forth between molarities and ppm as CaCO3 and the
hydronium required for neutralization is simply the alkalinity divided by
100. On the other hand I note that my very own water report shows 150.1
mg/l bicarbonate as the ion as  123.0 mg/l as CaCO3. (150.1)(50)/(61) =
123.0 so it looks as if Culligan is in the normality school. So the
question is: what is the standard?

Subject: Corn sugar


G'day. I've been happy to lurk for a while but Russell Mast's reply to the
guy who was making his first batch of home brew has brought me out of the
woodwork:
>Don't use corn sugar except to prime your bottles.  Don't use
>anything else to prime your bottles.  Don't worry, etc.


When I read this I thought that Russell was referring to Dried Corn Syrup
which I have successfully used for years as an adjunct, usually about
200grams in a 20 litre brew.
I find it gives improved body, better mouthfeel and a creamier and
longer-lasting head.
I checked with my friendly local home brew shop bloke and he put me right.
Apparently there's a terminology difference between the United States and
Australia; what you call Corn Sugar is known as Dextrose [aka Sucrose] over
here. Dried Corn Syrup is a wheat-derived adjunct.
This leaves me with the question: what do you call Dried Corn Syrup in the USA?
Whatever, I'd recommend that Charles Wilmer, Jr add some to his brew for
the above reasons.
Oh, and definitely 'don't worry!!'

Upper Canada, a local micro here in Toronto uses metal hydrometer flasks in
the brewhouse.  After taking a sample from a spigot on the kettle or the
lauter tun they put the copper cylinder in a larger diameter but shorter
tube installed in a sink.  This has water constantly running in the bottom,
over the top and into the sink.  The sample is stirred a few times with a
kind of plunger like instrument then the hydrometer is put in.  The excess
wort flows over the edge and the reading is taken at the very top of the
sample tube.  When I first saw this I wondered if the meniscus would
interfere but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  I believe they use clear
flasks in the fermentation house.  They sure do get their readings fast
with this system.

Hello,


There's a pretty good chance my wife and I will be moving to a
modern apartment in a few months.  I've been brewing with a king
cooker in an old garage.  Is it possible to do all grain inside?  


I would be interested in learning about any 'setups' or equipment that
could make the transition easier.

Text item: Text_1


     
        Microwaving discredited!!!  Let those of you without microbes cast 
     the first stone!
     
        Seriously, to get back to the microwaving issue, several people 
     have commented on the advantages and disadvantages of microwaving 
     funnels, glass fittings, etc.  
     
        I just want to reiterate that sterility (ridding of all microbes, 
     including spores) is not a standard issue in Homebrewing, but 
     sanitation is.  In this spirit, it is sufficient to wash your 
     equipment with chlorine-based detergents and lots of tap water.  
     However, microwaving funnels, etc. can be helpful if you can't scrub 
     hard-to-get-to places in your gear.  Of course, as with any 
     sterilization-like procedure, the duration of the microwaving is 
     critical:  5-7 minutes at high power is sufficient.
     
        A scientific word about microwaving.  Microwaves are produced at a 
     frequency that oscillates H20 molecules in liquid phase (that's why 
     microwaving is much less efficient on frozen food).  If something is 
     zapped with sufficient radiation (i.e.- long enough) , it will 
     effectively boil from within.  Proof of this was demonstrated to me 
     once when a hollowed out "box" of frozen ice cream filled with pudding 
     was microwaved, resulting in heated pudding in the center surrounded 
     by frozen ice cream (an inverted Baked Alaska).  Kids, you may try 
     this trick at home.
     
        A comment was made that microwaving a plate of food often results 
     in only some sections being heated.  This is due to the lack of focus 
     of the microwaves in household units, and is why more expensive units 
     have a motorized lazy-susan to distribute the radiation more evenly 
     over the food.  
     
        Lastly, I run a microbiology lab, where sterility is an issue.  We 
     have found that microwaving solutions of under 1L for at least 10' is 
     sufficient for FULL sterilization (remember to loosen the bottle caps 
     to prevent steam buildup). This includes sporulating fungi and 
     bacteria.  Thus, this procedure is ideal for people wanting to 
     sterilize water or media to be used for yeast culturing.  However, we 
     have found that our bacterial yields from microwaved media are lower 
     than from autoclaved media, suggesting that the radiation tends to 
     break down sugars and/or nutrients critical for growth.  As was 
     reported recently, it probably this may be part of the deleterious 
     effect on hop flavor.
     
        Cheers!!

Subject: Stovetops/Excessive DMS?/Bottling


Dear Friends, got some comments on stuff in #1728.


Dan Pack asks about the ups and downs of stovetops for full boils.  My 
biggest problem in using the stove is all the steam that gets 
generated--it gets pretty swamplike in the kitchen, especially if you 
have lots of shiny surfaces (tile, in my case); the floors in particular 
would get very slick.  Never fell on my butt but it was close a couple 
times.  That alone was enough to motivate me to move out onto the balcony 
with a 3-ring burner, and all has been well ever since.


Tom Baier has a perception of excessive DMS in recent batches and wonders 
about the causes.  Lots of possibilities here; I won't even try to be 
comprehensive.  First, a cheap and easy thing to change is to use a short 
length of tubing/hose from the spigot of your lauter tun to the 
collection vessel so that the sweet wort doesn't splash around.  I doubt 
that not having one would enhance DMS production but it seems like good 
practice in general.  Some of the best ways to reduce the effects of DMS 
are: a good rolling boil; leaving the boiler uncovered as much as you 
dare so that the compounds involved can get the heck outta there; as 
rapid a chill as you can manage; and of course the bulk composition of 
the malt you are using.  Some of us down here are using a malt that is, 
among other things, more prone than usual to producing DMS precursors, 
and there have been a couple times when a lot was emanating from my 
fermenter (but most blew off during primary, fortunately; the styles 
didn't have much room for DMS).  


There has been some talk of bottling practices lately, most recently from 
Nigel Townsend down in Tassie.  For those of us who have plastic bins 
with spigots attached, bottling is a snap--you rack into the bin from the 
(primary or secondary, choose one), adding your priming solution as per 
usual, and then jam the bottling wand right into the spigot--the ones we 
have here fit perfectly.  That is, the OD of the wand is a perfect 
friction fit with the ID of the spigot.  Now your wand is pointing down, 
ready to dispense.  Put a pan under the spigot to catch drips; open the 
tap; stick a bottle in there, raising it until the bottom of the bottle 
actuates the tip of the wand; the bottle fills; have another ready to 
stick on there when the first is done; and so on.  Once I get this all 
set up (i.e. beer in bottling bin, bottles ready to be filled) it takes 
me about 20 minutes to fill a 23 litre batch, without needing 8 arms.  
When the level of beer in the bottling bin gets low, you can easily reach 
with one hand and tip it forward to keep things moving while using the 
other hand to maneuver the bottle.  Takes more words to describe than to 
do--but believe me it's better than my stabs at ASCII art.


Cheers, Dave in Sydney

Lee-- it depends on the temperature of the ferment, not the ambient
temperature.  Since you used a big starter, I'll bet that your yeast
actually raised the temperature of the green beer above 63F.  In my case,
I inadvertently put the fermenter into a 57F room and they never quite
got started.  I could check my brewing log, but I'll bet it was either
a 500ml or 750ml starter I used.

I'm sure they meant "isomerize the alpha acids."   Hop oils provide aroma...
it's the alpha and beta acids that provide the bitterness.

Careful... could there be a difference in the mouthfeel of 1.010 worth of
glucose and 1.010 worth of dextrins?  My gut feeling says yes.  Also, in
a private conversation with George Fix, he told me that his experience
indicates that protein content has a far larger effect on the body/mouthfeel
of a beer than the dextrin content.  I would also suspect that 1.010 worth
of dextrins may also have a different body/mouthfeel than 1.010 worth of
proteins.

Your local HB shop owner has it backwards: boiling O2-absorbing caps ruins
them.  The humidity in the headspace of the bottle is enough to activate
the O2 absorption.

Jim writes (about using a wood frame and window screen as a false bottom):
>1.  Will the screen mesh be sufficient to create a grain bed or would

I would say, no.  Most false bottoms are less than 25% open.  Your screen
would be well over 75%!  It may work, but you will have to recirculate 
gallons and gallons till the grain established a filter bed.


>2.  Does anyone see potential problems with making a false bottom using wood

In addition to the sanitation worries, I would also be concerned about
aroma or flavour being imparted by the wood to the wort.  By all means
DON'T USE PRESSURE-TREATED WOOD FOR SOAKING IN BEER/WORT.
 
>3.  Because of my lack of lautering knowledge is there a better way to

Cross-pollenation should not be a problem unless you have a male plant
among your hops -- if you are buying your rhyzomes from a reputable
place, chances are nil that it's a male.  No, the reason for the spacing
is because the hop plants send out shoots that can stay underground for
a few feet (especially after a few years).  The reason that this is important
is because you might have a Nugget shoot come up amidst your Saaz shoots.
When the plants are of the same variety, who cares which rhysome the shoot
came from?

The issue here is crowding among leaves and one plant shading another.
I have two strings and a pole for each plant to climb and the triangle
of the bases is about 15" per side.  Overall, each plant (with one or
two bines growing up the pole and the two strings) is about 3 feet in
diameter.  If you used a single string for each plant and trimmed away
all but two or three bines, you could probably plant like varieties about
18" apart.


>3.) Is there no way for me to be able to determine by my self or by

Unless you grow an awful lot of hops or brew very little, you probably won't
grow enough to supply yourself.  I would recommend just using the homegrown
hops for dryhopping/finishing, where the %AA is virtually immaterial.  You
can brew a few test batches and estimate the %AA by trial and error.  Or, I
believe you can send a sample to the University of Oregon (call ahead to
make sure), but I'm pretty sure the cost will make it more expensive than
store-bought.

I believe there was an article on this about three or four years ago in
Zymurgy, by Micah Millspaw, Bob Jones or both of them.  Personally, I put
the dark grains in at dough-in, but then I also add calcium carbonate and
other brewing salts to the mash to imitate the water of the style I'm trying
to brew.  The dark grains lower the pH of the mash and the CaCO3 raises it.
It is because of this, that areas with high carbonate levels (Dublin,
Munich, London) became famous for their dark beers).

Sounds like a Pediococcus infection.  Some strains of Pedio produce copious
amounts of diacetyl.  I've never personally tasted a beer with such an
infection, but George Fix has written that the diacetyl produced by a Pedio
infection has a rough/rancid flavour, not the smooth diacetyl you get from
yeast.  Perhaps it is just a matter of concentration?  George?

        1. Pros and cons of single stage brewing.


Pros: one less transfer, less risk of infection, one less vessel to sanitize,
one less vessel to clean.


Con: for long ferments (e.g. lagers) the yeast spend a long time on the trub
and dead yeast.


Note that I personally feel that there is a big difference between using a
plastic fermentor as a primary and a glass fermentor as a primary.  If you
are using a plastic fermentor as your primary, I feel you should be more
concerned about oxidation of the finished beer through the walls of the
fermentor than about yeast autolysis or the beer sitting on the trub.  I've
had a beer go "bad" on me (lots of aldehydes) after only three weeks in an
HDPE plastic fermentor.  On the other hand, I've let beers sit for months
(granted, they were always either quite dark or quite strong) in a glass
primary with no noticable problems.  If you're making an ale, using a good
healthy starter, fermenting the beer out in a week or 10 days and bottling
within a 10 days of the end of fermentation, I would recommend sticking with
a single-stage fermentation.  If you plan to lager, add fruit for a secondary
fermentation or are often too busy to bottle until weeks later, then do
go to a secondary.


        2. Should I sterilize my caps and if so how is the best way?


Yes.  I recommend a 15 minute soak in 200 ppm cool, bleach solution
(1tbsp/gal).  Incidentally, this is sanitation, not sterilization.  You
cannot acheive sterilization without autoclaving, pressure cooking or
irradiation.

"a" will make decent beer 9 out of 10 times, but a significant percentage of
yeast will suffer from this treatment.  Dry yeast first need to rehydrate.
If you put them into wort or a sugar solution, they will have a harder time
absorbing water than if you added the yeast to plain sanitary water. "b" is
the best, but "warm" is relative.  The proper rehydration temperature
(according to Lallemand, one of the largest dry brewing yeast mfgrs) is between
90 and 100F.  The time is also rather important.  Lallemand says at least
15 minutes, but not more than 30 minutes.  "c" is probably no better than
"b" but has the added risk of introducing a teaspoon of unsterile sugar.
 
>2. What happens if I pitch twice as much yeast as needed? 


Few homebrewers add enough yeast.  If you mean two packages in stead of
one, the answer is, a shorter lag time (a good thing, generally speaking).
In fact, if you are making a strong beer, adding extra yeast is just about
required for a healthy ferment and a reasonable finishing gravity.

Not to worry.  CO2 will purge-out any O2 that might get in.  There's quite
a difference between letting air into the headspace and stirring air into
the fermenting beer (the latter increasing diacetyl production).  After
fermentation, the effect of beer is a little more problematic (aldehyde
production) but in small amounts even that is below sensory threshold.

Hi All,

You've come to the right place.


>1.  While lautering, I let my sweet wort splash mightily down into

>Is this aeration causing big-time HSA?


I'd say yes. I use a 1/2" poly tube on the outlet of my mash/lauter tun, and
keep the end of the tube submerged an inch or two below the level of the wort
in the brewpot. This also helps eliminate the mess from spattering wort.


>2.  I use corny kegs for fermenters,
>Did we ever reach closure about the

Yes we did. Some time ago, George Fix posted an article to the digest
describing the effects of fermenter geometry on the flavor profile of 
finished beer. I don't have the text of the article handy, but working from
memory (always a dicey proposition, eh?), the article said the "ideal
situation" is when the aspect ratio is 1:1 or less, and that it should not
exceed 2:1. The aspect ratio of Corny kegs is a little over 3:1, I think,
compared to about 1.5:1 for a 6.5 gallon carboy. The article noted both higher
finishing gravities and elevated levels of diacetyl when tall, narrow
fermenters were used versus short, squat ones. Draw your own conclusions.

Put several ice cubes in some cold water,  and wait a few minutes to give
the ice a chance to melt a bit. Put your thermometer in, stir for a minute,
the mixture should read roughly 32F.


Tom, FWIW, my take on this is that you may have a combination of off flavors
due to HSA and diacetyl that you are perceiving as DMS. Assuming that you
are not using a malt that is extremely high in SMM (s-methyl methionine,
a primary precursor to DMS), there are some things you can do to minimize
DMS production, and eliminate it as a possible cause of the off flavor you
are getting. Since you brew English ales, I assume you are using pale malt,
which has been more highly kilned than the European lager malts that have
this characteristic, and is thus lower in DMS precursors.
First, use a vigorous, rolling boil, and leave the brewpot uncovered. DMS
can be driven off as a gas during the boil if the brewpot is reasonably
well ventilated. Second, DMS is also produced in the initial stages of
wort cooling. A few years back, someone posted a graph that showed DMS
production levels versus temperature. This graph clearly showed that the
majority of DMS is produced as the wort cools from 212F to 140F. Obviously,
the faster the wort is chilled through this temperature range, the less DMS
is produced. What I do is leave my brewpot uncovered for the first 1 to 2
minutes after starting my wort chiller (ObBeerGeek: it's fun to watch the
cold break form), allowing some ventilation during the critical phase of the
chilling. The wort is still hot enough that infection won't be a problem.
After the first couple of minutes, cover the brewpot.

Way to go Patrick!!! The way that you skillfully parlayed your wife's

My .02 on the women/wives in brewing thread:


Unfortunately, my wife has not the slightest interest in brewing. Like
Patrick's, the smell of a mash (which always reminds me of the fresh baked
bread my grandmother used to bake) and the smell that comes from the brewpot
a few minutes after adding hops (is there anyone among us who doesn't love
that wonderful hop aroma?) is enough to send her fleeing to the nearest
shopping mall. Over the years, she has patiently tolerated burnt wort on
the stovetop, exploding mason jars, weekends when I disappeared to go judge
someplace, slants of yeast in the fridge, the list of my brewing crimes goes
on and on. 
It does help that she's an enthusiastic "end-user" though. Her favorite styles
are stout, porter, and steam beer, no lite beers need apply. And after
suffering in silence, her first words upon arriving home from work are usually
"what's on tap?" :-)

Very likely.  Add a hose extension to your Zapap outlet with the end
below the surface of the wort so it doesn't splash.

It certainly should.  Especially since you say you make almost
exclusively British ales.  If you are using British pale ale malt, you
would have to work to have DMS, since well modified malt has a greatly
reduced level of DMS precursors.  I suggest you take your beer to your
local homebrew club for some additional opinions as to just what this
objectionable flaw is.  You say you don't belong?  Join!  You'll be able

British PAs usually finish at about 25% OG.  FG 10-15 sounds about
right.

That's the setup I have and I get over 30 pgp.  Have you insulated your
Zapap to keep a steady mashout/lauter temp of 176^F?  Do at least a full
hour mash?  Check for unconverted starch?  Check your mash pH and  water
chemistry?

Subject: FG/Mouthfeel




     We all have to start somewhere :


     Regarding the recent discussion about the relationship
     between the FG of a beer and the "mouthfeel" of that
     beer.  I believe that the definition of specific
     gravity is the ratio of density of a particular
     substance to the density of a base substance, water in
     most cases.  Therefore, dissolving any substance which
     is more dense than water into a water solution should
     increase the specific gravity of that solution and
     hence the "mouthfeel", (assumes we perceive a dense
     substance as having more "body" than a less dense
     substance).  This would seem to indicate a direct
     correlation between the FG and "mouthfeel", if beer
     were merely a mixture of water and substances more
     dense than water.  However, beer tends to contain a
     pesky, yet adorable substance known in some circles as
     alky-hol.  Alcohol being less dense than water, will
     cause an understatement of the "true" FG of a beer.
     Thus if we can accurately calculate the amount of
     alcohol in the solution and determine the exact impact
     this has on the FG measure, we should be able to make
     an adjustment to the FG and arrive at a FG which would
     accurately represent the "mouthfeel" of the beer
     (assuming all CO2 has been removed from the solution
     prior to FG measurement).


     This is my first attempt at contribution to this forum
     so please take that into consideration if my logic is
     seriously flawed.  I'm still recovering from my
     Kentucky Derby sunburn and probably wouldn't survive
     another scorching.

Many thanks to all of you who have responded to my query about the
relationship between FG and mouth feel/thickness.  In addition to the
HBD articles posted, I received several responses via private e-mail.


The one thing that was a clear concensus of opinion on this subject is:
     There is no concensus of opinion.
The opinions ranged all the way from a kurt "No", through a list of
qualified "maybe"s, all the way to those who indicate that there is a
direct relationship.  I think rather than trying to summarize the
responses, I will simply quote a few of the more notable comments.


- ------------------------------------------------------------
From: hollen`at`megatek.com (Dion Hollenbeck)
I think that regardless of OG, beers which finish at a higher gravity
will have more mouthfeel.  The FG is a measure of how much
unfermentables are left, and it is unfermentables which give mouthfeel.


- ------------------------------------------------------------
From: Darren_Aaberge-RA2698`at`email.sps.mot.com (Darren Aaberge)
Final Gravity determines the dryness/sweetness of a beer.  I think its
maybe proteins and certain flavor components in the beer that attribute
to the mouthfeel (thickness/thinness). ...  Also, when beers are
filtered with sub micron filters, the filter will filter out some of
the proteins and the filtered beer will taste thinner than the
unfiltered beer, even though they will both have the same specific
gravity (none of the sugars are filtered out).


- ------------------------------------------------------------
From: kevin`at`wheels.aar.com (Kevin Hass)
Something I have done to check the beer for unfermentables, has been to
take a known amount of beer, and dry it completely, and then measure
the weight of that residue.  That residue has the alcohol and water
removed, leaving just the dextrins, carbohydrates, and other yeastie
things behind.  From doing this, I was amazed to find out how much
stuff was in the beer.  The batch I tested had an FG of 1.012, and also
had something like about an ounce of this residue per 12 ounce serving
of beer.  I would expect most of that would be unfermentable dextrins,
but I don't know for sure.


- ------------------------------------------------------------
From: spencer`at`med.umich.edu
The FG is a combination of the remaining unfermentable components
(sugars, dextrins, proteins, etc.), which raise it, AND alcohol, which
lowers it.  The higher alcohol beer has MORE alcohol, and thus, in
order to have the same FG, must have MORE unfermentables.


- ------------------------------------------------------------
From: Russell Mast <rmast`at`fnbc.com>
I see what you're trying to achieve, that's a way to scale mouthfeel.
I believe that it's very accurate to try and capture mouthfeel on a
unitary scale.  I could see a stout and a doppelbock which could be
rated as equally 'thick' but there's a different quality to the feel.
Of course, the same is true of color, and they have a scale for that,
so why not mouthfeel? I think the best we'd be able to achieve for
mouthfeel is a subjective rating system based on accepted standards.


- ------------------------------------------------------------
From: flemingk`at`usa.net (Kirk R Fleming)
"Yes" if you are talking about a "class" of worts built from similar or
identical ingredients. ...  "No" if you're comparing two beers of
completely different classes having identical OGs. ...  Also, "complete

perspective of a particular yeast.


- ------------------------------------------------------------
From: "Paul Stokely" <PSTOKELY`at`ea.umd.edu>
Hops also contribute to "mouthfeel" in addition to bitterness. ...

unfermentable "mouthfeel" dextrins/ fermentable sugars.

This issue is so highly subjective that trying to quantify it may be,
although brave and Zen-like, doomed to failure.  What one person
identifies as "body" another might call "sweetness", not because one is
a better taster than the other, but how and what different people can
taste has such a wide range.  The range of subtleties available in
finished beer is enormous.

From: "Troy Howard"  <troy`at`oculus.jsei.ucla.edu>
Don't forget that carbonation levels play an important part in the
perception of mouthfeel.


- ------------------------------------------------------------
Taking all of these thoughtful comments together, it seems to be that
there is room for further research in this area.  My goal is not (as
many seem to suggest) to use FG as an objective measure of mouthfeel,
but as a means to quantify the influence of various mash conditions
(such as time, temperature, pH, stiffness, etc.).  All of which are
related to this concept of mouthfeel.  I'll see what I can glean about
this subject and get back to you if I think I have found anything
worthwhile.

"People who drink light "beer" don't like the taste of beer;                   
                            they just like to pee a lot"
