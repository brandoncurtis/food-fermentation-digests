Yes.  I don't recommend trying it with the King Cooker.  I've been brewing 
in an apartment setting for years, including abot a dozen all-grain batches.
I've only brewed 5 gallon (4-6, really) batches, and I think it would be
damned hard to brew anything larger.

I would like to make the transition in the other direction, actually.  I
tend to use lots and lots of milk-crates (collegiate modular furniture.)  
I have a brew kettle which straddles two burners.  In my previous apartment,
if I had more than 5 or 6 gallons to boil, I had to split it to get it 
boil in a decent amount of time.  I use a copper coil in a bathtub as a wort 
chiller.  As someone else mentioned, that much boiling in a little kitchen
makes it quite sauna-like.  I just open some windows.  I've found that a Gott
cooler is invaluable for maintaining a stable mash temperature.


Hope that helps, if you have any specific questions, feel free to e-mail me.

This gives me an idea.  We could devise a scale for mouthfeel, much like 
the Lovibond rating for color.  And, just like you could get a red beer or
a brown beer which rate the same degree Lovibond, you could have subjectively
different textures rate differently on this "body" scale.  Nonetheless, it
very likely _can_ be scaled.  It will not be subjective by the strictest 
criteria of objevtivity, but it might be handy in formulating recipes.  


And, just like you can write on a bag of crystal malt that it's 60 deg L, you
could write some kind of mouthfeel rating on it as well.  And, just like 
color, the final product's actual mouthfeel will vary greatly depending on
procedure used to make it into beer, but it might vary in a way systematic 
enough to be useful when selecting a grain bill for a particular beer.  


Another parallel with Lovibond (though perhaps not SRM, I don't know) is that 
this mouthfeel rating, while obviously linked in many ways to the underlying 
chemistry of the grain or extract, this scale would be based on empirical data 
using a standardized procedure to compare different ingredients on the same 
grounds.  (Including standardizing carbonation and temperature.)


So, rather than looking to derive a mouthfeel rating from other numbers in
the beer, perhaps we (we?) should construct a new scale.  I see some potential
problems with this, specifically some ingredients having a different relation
to temperature, so it wouldn't scale simply, but it'd be worth some effort.

Very.  This would make a great dissertation topic for anyone trying to get

Subject: Lactose Milk Sugar...


Hello,


A quick 'Thank You' to all of those responding to my lauter-tun/false bottom
question.  I'll skip the wood frame and build a copper manifold.


I've seen Lactose Milk Sugar on the shelves at my homebrew supply shop and
would like to ask the following questions:


1. If I use this in my beer will people who are lactose-intollerant be able
to enjoy this beer without the stomach aches and nasty lactose side effects?


2. I have never used this sugar before, could someone please explain what
type of recipes call for it and how much of this product is normally added
to these recipes?


3. Will lactose milk sugar add a 'cream' flavor and/or mouthfeel to the beer
since the sugar is derived from a dairy product?


With regards to the last question and mouthfeel, I'm sorry to be punching a
dead horse but I would like to learn a little bit about lactose milk sugar
since it is on homebrew supply shelves, not mentioned in too many of the
recipes I've come across, and only mentioned in passing on the HBD.


Thanks in advance for any information people are willing to part with.  If
enough information is sent to me I will post the results to these questions.

Subject: Re: Corn Sugar/ Mouthfeel


Alan Keig says:
"Apparently there's a terminology difference between the United States and
Australia; what you call Corn Sugar is known as Dextrose [aka Sucrose] over
here. Dried Corn Syrup is a wheat-derived adjunct."
- -------------
It's been a long time since I took OChem, so I'll just quote from the text
(Morrison, Robert and Boyd, R.; "Organic Cemistry", (Allyn and Bacon
Inc.,1973)):


"(+)-Sucrose is our common table sugar, obtained from sugar cane and sugar
beets."


"When (+)-sucrose is hydrolyzed.... it yields equal amounts of D-(+)-glucose a
nd D-(-)-fructose."


"This inversion is....often called the inversion of (+)-sucrose, and the
levorotatory mixture of D-(+)-glucose and D-(-)-fructose obtained has been
called invert sugar.  (Honey is mostly invert sugar...)."


"Because of their opposite rotations and their importance as components of
(+)-sucrose, D-(+)-glucose and D-(-)-fructose are commonly called *dextrose*
and *levulose*."


The authors were from New York University, so I assume the naming conventions
are American, if not international.  My local homebrew shops sell corn sugar
that definitely does not taste the same as table sugar.  Thus, I assume what
I get at the shops is glucose (a monosaccharide) and not sucrose (a
disaccharide).


I've never seen dried corn syrup, but that doesn't mean it's not out there.
 That Alan's Dried Corn Syrup is a *wheat-derived* adjunct shows that we have
to be careful of terminology when communicating with the other parts of the
world.  According to my dictionary, corn syrup is a "syrup prepared from corn
and containing glucose combined with dextrin and maltose."  When you say
"corn" in the US, people think of what the British call "maize" since they
already use the word "corn" to refer to just about any grain. Your Mileage
May Vary (especially in countries that use kilometers).
- --------------
My $.02 on the mouthfeel thread is that the viscosity may be more of a factor
than the density (gravity).  Motor oil has a lower gravity than water, but
definitely feels thicker (fingers, not mouth) than water.  That's because
it's more viscous. I forget the details since I took Fluid Mechanics about
the same time I took OChem.  Basically, higher viscosity means it takes more
force to move one bit of the fluid past another bit of fluid.  Also, there
are two types of viscosity related by the fluid density, so there may some
room for FG to affect the mouthfeel.

Well, you could send them to U of O but they'd probably just try to smoke
them ;^). It's Oregon State (in Corvallis) you want, the USDA Hop lab is there.
Last I heard it'll cost you around $35 per sample for alpha, beta, moisture,
and oil analysis. Al's right--it makes more sense to use your homegrown for
finishing or brew a couple of test batches (or hop teas) to determine the
bittering power.

Subject: Decoction Mash Questions


Greetings from the swamplands of Texas


I have been brewing AG now for about 1 1/2 years using step infusion 
process, and would like to try decoction mashing. The end effect that I am 
looking for is an increased Malt flavor (ie EKU Ruben -sp?-). I prefer 
german style dark lagers but will probably try my first decoction on an Alt 
recipe. Any suggestions on technique or grain bills to reach my "malty" 
target will be much appreciated.


My question after reading the decoction FAQ is about PH control. I have 
ZERO experience with PH control (except for that "Lactic Lager" incident, 
something about sparge water not buffering very well. Can you say drain 
cleaner?). 


The decoction.FAQ states :


>- pH must be checked and corrected to avoid extraction of
>  tannins from the husks (anything below appr. 5.7 is ok) 


Will the temperature of the decoction effect the PH measurement (I will be 
using PH paper test strips, don't recall the range)? If so is there an 
offset scale that I need to use. 


When do I need to test the PH (at the rest temp or at boil)? 


Also if someone could describe a typical dec. mash for me I think that I 
would feel more comfortable. The general procedure is pretty well described 
in th FAQ, but I like having a warm fuzzy feeling about what to expect (I'm 
more of a visual/tactile kind of guy). Please feel free to describe tips 
and tricks (that are absent from the FAQ) such as what should the 
consistancy of the decoction be (thick oatmeal or barley seed soup), or 
when you know things are getting too hot/dry/burnt/etc and what to do about 
it. 


Also I read that I can expect a greater extraction rate. How much?


        TIA

well, how 'bout one more post on 'mouthfeel':


one additional variable that would seem to affect 'mouthfeel' is the
viscosity of the beer, which is somewhat independent of gravity. this might
explain why proteins can affect the 'mouthfeel' - filtering them out does
not change the gravity significantly, but this probably changes the
viscosity (i think proteins are sizable little buggers) which changes the
mouthfeel. perhaps mouthfeel could be correlated to a) gravity, b) viscosity
and c) relative sweetness (if there's a way to measure that).

Subject: Re: FG/Mouthfeel




I think FG (with a factor added to correct for alcohol content lowering FG) 
is an indicator of mouthfeel, I don't think our mouths are really feeling 
the beer's density, though.


If you exclude the sweetness(taste) alcohol(astringent)and PH(sting) parts, 
I believe a scientific quantity that might better indicate mouthfeel
would be viscosity.  Having seen (cooking) oil float on water, I believe it 
has a SG less than one, yet most folks would agree it is "thicker" in their
mouth than water.  What is higher for the oil is it's viscosity.  I believe 
there are standard tests to measure viscosity using a shaft with 'propellers' 
in a tank with fixed baffles sort of like reverse propellers coming out of 
the walls.  The electrical power required to spin the shaft at a certain 
RPM is then used to compute the viscosity.  There may even be a newer test
which rapidly 'wiggles' a single wand in a certain size tank.  If there are
any mechanical engineers or chemists on the HBD who really know viscosity,
feel free to chime in.


I also agree with the comment that carbonation can affect the mouthfeel.
This points out that any measurement/grading technique might want to control
the carbonation level or decarbonate the beer like Dr Fix's color technique
from the HBD a few years back (or his Vienna book).  That observation
also makes me wonder if surface tension is part of mouthfeel.  I think
it is related to viscosity, but I don't remember any details.  I can
see how varying the surface tension of lots of tiny bubbles being pushed 
between your teeth and tongue could be part of the whole mouthfeel thing.
I do remember from Papazian or Miller that surface tension is a major factor 
in head retention.  I have NO IDEA how surface tension is measured...


Anybody know if the Megas measure viscosity or surface tension either
before or after fermentation?




These are just my thoughts, I am an electrical engineer by profession, 
but I did really ace freshman organic chemistry over a decade ago.  :)

 When I used a stove, I was barely able to keep four to five gallons of wort
 boiling.  That's why I made three gallon batches at the time.
 I'd recommend getting a larger, shallow pot so you can straddle burners and
 keeping the pot partly covered.  And you'll need some replacement pans that
 go under the burners, because they're tough to clean after the boilovers!

Steve asked about brewing in an apartment (5-12-95).


I brew in an apartment, always have.  I have zero 
problems, but I put my 15 gal. boiler on a gas range
using two to four burners at once.  Since you have a 
propane burner you would have to brew outside.  My 
friends use a three tier system and brew right on the 
front steps of their apt. propane burner and all.
Try to rent a place with a gas stove, for year round 
brewing fun, and try to get a big brewery, er kitchen, 
for plenty of room.

having but to a lesser extent; just a lot of the grain getting through the
false bottom. I don't know how many pounds of grain he was using or how it was
being used but I know he just used it the one time.
     The false bottom (SS screen) has a plastic like trim around it I guess to
protect from snags, unraveling and seal with the wall. It came off during his
mash. I don't know how it was originally attached, slip fit or glue. We
decided to scrap the screen idea and go with a perforated SS hinged bottom.
     What the inside of his kettle is like is that it has the 3/4" SS coupling
slipped half way through the wall of the keg and welded. There are 3/4" SS
pipe fittings used for a down tube running horizontally to an elbow, then down
to the center bottom. The vertical pipe is a SS nipple with the lower end
threads parted off. Around the inside wall there are these 5/16" or so SS rods
about 3" long stud welded, I presume, to the inner wall spaced about every
45#161# or so. This would make a good rigid base for the perf. bottom we
thought. Unfortunately the SS rods were attached on the same center line as
that of the 1" diameter wall coupling, putting the top of the coupling and the
6" nipple and elbow about 1/2" above the top of the rods tops. Maybe this
could be contributing to your friends mash drop and my friends grain passage?
This defiantly would not work with a rigid bottom (cocked surface contact
points) so we had to attach spacers to the SS rods to bring them up to the
coupling height.
     I built the SS hinged perforated bottom and it rides nice and flat on the
spacers and the horizontal pipe and coupling. He hasn't had an opportunity to
do a mash yet but I'm sure it will work fine. One of the other problems he had
with it was the nice ~ 3" dial thermometer top temperature range was only to
120#161# F. He was going to contact SABCO regarding a  replacement thermometer
that would go to 212#161#. I also took the oppertunity to remove the teflon
tape that was on the coupling and elbow fittings.
     I hope this information helps. It seems to me that even though the stud
welded rods extend radially to the center ~ 3" each and the down tube extends
horizontally, clear to the center of the kettle, there still might not be
enough support for that flexible screen mesh causing the sides to come in and
let grain through.

Subject: Recipe request for Drake's Ale


     I am searching for information on a brew called Drake's Ale from Lind 
     Brewing Co in San Leandro CA (outside Oakland) that I am hoping to 
     replicate. 
     
     It is a British Amber with a malty taste but not as hopped as a pale 
     ale.  It also had a slightly sweet taste that I recall.
     
     ANY INFORMATION on possible yeast, hops, adjuncts (Malto-Dextrose?), 
     IBU's, etc. is appreciated.  Of course, an extract recipe would be 
     more than appreciated!  I called the brewery and got a message that 
     said that this brew used Roland? hops.  Anyone ever heard of these, or 
     know of a substitute?
     
     Private e-mail is fine.  If I come up with a recipe, I will post:  
     this is the finest beer that I have ever had, and is what prompted me 
     to start homebrewing.  I can get the color with the help of crystal 
     malt but my use of Cascades and dry ale yeast need to change.  Problem 
     is that I tasted the Drake's before I knew anything about brewing!

Yes, corn sugar is dextrose, however dextrose and sucrose are not
the same thing.  Dextrose is glucose [D-(+)-glucose, I believe, for
all you chemist-types].  Sucrose is a disaccharide, each molecule
consisting of one glucose residue linked to one fructose residue.
Sucrose is (at least in the US) common table sugar.
Sorry, Alan, but I can't help you with "Dried Corn Syrup."

Subject: High finishing gravitites


I am new at this but am having a problem that my local supplier doesn't seem
to be able to answer. I've brewed 7 batches of beer so far, all have ended at
least 1.015 with most of them at 1.020. I know that this in itself isn't
impossible but these beers includes recipes that state an ending gravity of
1.005 or 4 from Charlie's book.


One particular brew that I had go bad and am now in the process of trying
again is a modification of "Righteous Real Ale" from Charlie. I used 6 lbs.
of Amber dried malt and some hops that shouldn't (I think) affect anything.
The first time it started at 1.039 fermented vigorously for less than 24
hours and stopped at 1.031. I added yeast nutrient - nothing. I re-pitched
with a dry yeast starter - nothing. It sat in the fermenting bucket until it
smelled bad - about 2 1/2 weeks.


This time I used the same recipe but added a little bit of yeast nutrient
right before I pitched the yeast. Beggining gravity was 1.040. Also I used
two packages of dry yeast instead of one. It fermented vigorously for less
than 24 hours. I measured today, the fifth day, for the first time. It is at
1.030. This time I took off the air-lock and sloshed the wort around for a
while then put the airlock back on. I got that idea from Homebrew Digest
somewhere but I don't know if it was right or not. My supplier didn't like
the idea. (He is a good guy, he felt so bad that the first batch went bad
that he split the loss with me! I)


My feeling is that the ending gravities should be lower, at least closer to
what the recipe calls for. Any ideas?

Subject: bread & stuff


Brewers and Bakers,


I noticed in the most recent issue of Zymurgy, that there is
a bread company in the northwest (sorry, don't have the name
in front of me) that uses the spent grains from the regional
breweries to make bread.  I know this has been discussed
before, and several good recipes have been offered on this
forum.  I make an excellent bread (thanks to Jeff Renner as
I remember) that uses about 25% spent grains.  My question
is, what is the best way to finely grind the spent grains?
I currently dry the grains and then just crank down my old
Corona and grind as finely as possible, but that still
leaves some pretty good sized chunks.  Any suggestions?


On an unrelated subject, the converted (legal) keg I've been
using as a brew pot is developing a brown coating on the
bottom that is next to impossible to scrub off.  I'm not against
using a little elbow grease, but this stuff is really tuff.
Any suggestions on something to use that doesn't require
rubber suits and special training?


Thanks, and Brew On

I have always used the normality definition of alkalinity in my classes. (I have
actually never seen the molarity definition). However, I looked up the method of
determining alkalinity in a book "Standard methods for analysis of water and 
wastewater" published by the American Public Health Association. They calculate 
alkalinity using the normality method. I would strongly suspect that water 
treatment facilities (where we get our water information) use the APHA book, and
its definition of alkalinity. If the brewer calculates alkalinity using the 
molarity method, and the water treatment plant uses the normality method, then 
the brewer will underestimate the buffering capacity of the water by a factor of
two.
   To calculate alkalinity (given the normality definition where 1 mole of CaCO3
can neutralize two moles of H+):
        
      x meq/L* 100 mg CaCO3/mmol * 0.5 mmol/meq = Alkalinity as mg CaCO3/L


where x is the milliequivalents of acid (millimoles of H+ ions) per liter 
necessary to neutralize the water sample (to a pH of 4.5).

I work for a major Corn Wet Miller in this country and one of the products we
produce internationally is a malto-dextrin. The sole use for this product as
I understand it is as an adjunct for brewing to improve the "mouthfeel" of
the finished product. Bottom line as I see it is that the feel of the beer is
due to the non-fermentables in the wort which could be from added dextrins or
other non-fermentable sugars such as lactose or higher saccharides.

Now my question is, ive been considering for over a month now, what type of beer
I want to make with this.  I have 2#'s of this raw sugar, so I figure its only
going to make 1 batch of beer.  Does anyone have any ideas on how I should use
this sugar?  Is it going to be better to use it in the secondary?  Ive tasted
the sugar, and its got a very unique taste to it.


I wouldnt mind trying something with Fruit or pineapple, maybe toss in some

This means a small clinical thermometer contains about 0.2g mercury and

Subject: Hops Schedules


I've noticed some elaborate hopping schedules in recipes in old issues 
of Zymurgy. They usually consist of adding small amounts of a variety 
of hops over the course of the boil.  With some it seems like you would 
be dropping hops in the kettle every five minutes.


As I understand it, most of the bitterness extracted from hops depends 
on isomerization of alpha acids, and that the amount of bitterness is 
proportional to the length of the boil.  And any flavor/aroma extracted 
from hops is rapidly lost in boiling wort, so hop additions late in the 
boil (or dry hopping) are used to add hop flavor and aroma.


So, now to my question.  Is there some rationale for developing these 
complex hopping schedules?  Is it to blend various hop 
bitterness/flavor/aroma compounds together?  Are some combinations 
better than others?  Are certain boiling times better for certain hops 
than others?  What gives?

If you think that the ole' microwave oven will work for sanitation then go
ahead as usual - put the items in the oven and add one additional item, a
package of dried yeast.  I guess it needs to be opened (can't remember if
it's in foil) and place yeast in a small glass dish.  Perform your
sanitation run just as if the yeast wasn't there and then afterwards remove
yeast, hydrate, and pitch to a small test batch of wort.  Watch for results
and post to HBD.

     Grand Cru is a term used to denote a beer or wine of great vintage.
Examples of this are Rodenbach Grand Cru and Cantillon Grand Cru, both
of these beers consist of aged beer alone. Whereas straight Rodenbach
and Cantillon Gueuze are blends of aged and young beers.
     Grand Cru beers usually have a higher gravity and hence a higher
alcohol content and are often meant to be laid down for a few years
before consumption.


     On another note, in Ben Turner's The Compleat Home Winemaker & Brewer
there is a recipe for Cock Ale (pg.119) which involves steeping a 
chicken in wine and then placing the chicken in a nylon bag and suspending
it in the beer until fermentation is complete.
     On one hand, the idea of chicken parts in my beer disgusts me,
but curiousity is killing me. 
     Oh hell, I am just trying to rekindle that zoomurgy thread of a
year ago, but seriously, has anyone ever tried this recipe?
Any thoughts about this type of recipe?

<$100.00 more for stainless.
I would recomend sending for a Rapids Wholesale Equiptment Co. catalog.
I bought a 38.5 gallon kettle from them for $95. they have 60 Qt. kettles for
$161.25.
Call them at 1-800-4rapid1 for a catalog.
