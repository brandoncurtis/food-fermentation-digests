Subject: Harsh, astringent taste from end of secondary?


The last two batches that I've bottled have suffered from a curious
problem.  The hydrometer samples that I tasted while the two batches
(an ordinary bitter and a doppelbock) were in the early secondary
and earlier indicated that both should be quite promising.  Yet shortly
before I bottled both, as the SG's fall leveled off, the beer began to
develop a harsh, astringent character, which was still present at
bottling time.  What happened, and will this go away with time?
I haven't encountered this with earlier batches.  The doppelbock
was kept down in an old coal cellar in the mid 40's, the bitter upstairs 
in the kitchen at room temperature.

I would suggest heavy doses of oven cleaner (eg. Easy Off).  Be careful

Subject: Stuck fermentations


I cannot see very much point in cosidering cures for stuck fermentation.
Stuck fermentation definitely means that things have gone unfortunately
& *irreversibly* awry in much earlier stage of brewing process.


Stuck fermentation is almost exclusively due to *wrong* composition
of sugars in the wort provided that aeration of wort has been done
properly and yeast & pitching rate is ok.


An elementary thing in brewing called *mashing schedule* (the sequence
of rests at certain temperatures) determines quite exactly the *desired*
sugar composition of wort (amount of fermentable sugars vs. dextrins).
We just have to understand the way beta- & alfa-amylases work and mash
accordingly.


There is no point doctoring the remaining much too high amount of dextrins
into fermentable sugars after fermentation stops (stucks) due to the fact that
fermentable sugars have run out - quite natural!
In biotechnical process called brewing the ratio of fermentables vs.
unfermentables is adjusted a little bit earlier by performing a pretty
little thing called *mashing* exactly the way which comes up with desired
composition of sugars in wort.

Thanks for this bit of sanity.  I'm no chemist so I kept my mouth shut
(up till now :-) ) but it's quite apparent that a little ball of
Mercury stays pretty much a little ball of Mercury.  This much I know
since I played with my share of Mercury as a kid...and we used it in
jr. high science experiments (read: "government approved - ooohhhhh").


I'd just roll that little ball out of my kettle into an HDPE bottle,
cap it and put it in the trash where it will be somebody else's
problem 10,000 years from know when the bottle decays.

Subject: Copper good for yeast?




Folks,


    I ran across a statement in some literature from one of the BOP
outfits that made me curious:


    "Brewing in copper kettles enhances yeast growth during the
     important primary fermentation phase."


What about brewing in copper would promote yeast growth?  I'd
appreciate any comments.


Cheers--

Subject: re: this mercury thread


Okay folks:  It is time to lay out some facts.


*Elemental mercury, as such, will not be readily absorbed by the body.  BUT,
one of the problems is that, once ingested, your body will try to chemically
modify the mercury to make it easier to get rid of.  This is where the problem
comes from.  Elemental mercury is too heavy and dense to go through the
stomach or intestinal lining.  But if it becomes chemically modified, it can
and will pass through this barrier and WILL ACCUMULATE IN TISSUES HIGH IN FAT,
like your brain, kidneys, and other vital organs.


*As somone posted yesterday, triple-distilled mercury has had most of the
water soluble mercury contaminants removed from it.  But your body is still
gonna try to make it easier to get rid of.


*Mercury is a chronic toxin.  We all (well, most of us chemistry types) played
with mercury in grade/high school, and we dn't hav anny brainy damagggggggge.
Seriously, it takes a massive one-time exposure or several high level
exposures to cause an long-term health effects.


*The reason that hat makers got Hg poisoning was that they would literally
take and large handfull of wool and dunk it in a barrel full of mercury.  They
were leaning over the barrel, up to their elbows in Hg, breathing the fumes
the whole time!  (Mercury has the amazing property of breaking the sulfur
bridges in wool that make it curly; after a short soak in Hg, wool will
straighten out and is easier to make into felt, and then into hats).
The chronic mercury poisoning that hatters suffered from is where the term
"mad as a hatter" came from (not Lewis Carroll).


*Practical advise:  Buy alcohol thermometers.  They are cheaper, with none of
the mercury worries (anyone know what kind of alcohol they use in them?)


Hope this helps

Subject: SS/Brass/Copper/False Bottoms


Hey All,


I'm about to embark on a great 3-tiered/RIMS fabrication journey.  I've read 
quite a bit of material in the archives regarding construction 
considerations, but I still have a few questions about materials and false 
bottoms.  


1.  Could somebody please definitively address the pros and cons of using 
stainless vs. brass vs. copper?  The obvious difference to me is price, which 
is usually a direct indicator of quality and durability, but what other 
considerations come into play.  e.g. Why not go with brass ball valves rather 
than ss?


2.  False bottoms:  As best I can gather from the archives and other sources, 
there are three basic designs here: the EasyMasher(TM) clone, the slotted 
copper manifold, and some sort of perforated stainless fabrication/screen 
combination.  The advantages of the EM and manifold designs are ease of 
construction and low price, but there seem to be 2 major disadvantages:  A) 
scorching with non-RIMS systems; and B) Low flow rates and grainbed 
compaction  with RIMS systems.  Since I plan to construct a RIMS, I'm leaning 
toward the fabricated SS/mesh screen bottom-----I read about one made of a 
perforated pizza pan with 18x18 ss mesh attached by fishing line.  I would 
like to hear RIMS users comment on what false bottoms work best for them, 
especially in the interest of avoiding compacted grain beds.  If this has 
been rehashed endlessly or is not of general interest, please respond by 
private e-mail.  Although, I seem to notice a recent outcropping of 
budding RIMS engineers.  ;)


3.  Where is the best place to get detailed RIMS plans?----the special 
Gadgets issue of Zymurgy?  I'm particularly concerned about constructing the 
temperature controller and in-line heater assembly.  Instructions for the 
mechanically challenged would be most appreciated.


I have dozens more questions, but I'll leave it at that until I get my hands 
on more detailed information.  I appreciate any help you can give this 
struggling RIMS newbie.  Brew on!


Bones

Mike Marshburn wrote about re-using his spent yeast:


There is an excellent step by step process for doing this in the 
yeast.faq, but here is what you should do.  If this jar contains trub 
from your last batch, you should probably wash it.   This is simple.  Get 
another jar and fill it half full with boiled water and let cool to room 
temperature.  Take out the jar you have from the fridge, let it warm up 
to room temperature.  Swirl it to get yeast suspended and wait a minute 
or two while the trub resettles to the bottom.  Flame or rub with alcohol 
the rims of both jars, etc.  Carefully pour yeast into fresh jar.  Some 
people prefer to then repeat this process with another jar, but I have 
never bothered.  You should have relatively clean yeast and it is ready 
to go.  Just make up a starter and add this jar, leaving behind any stuff 
that collects on the bottom of the jar.  If you want to save it, put 
it in the refridgerator.


In the future, I would do this yeast washing right away after bottling 
your beer.  I hope this helps, if you have questions e-mail or get a hold 
of the yeast.faq which gives a more rigorous outline of this process.

There have been a few posts lately about trub removal and
hops clogging CF chillers. I use a homemade easy masher
for mashing and in my kettle. Even if you don't wan't to
mash with an EM, they are excellent for trub removal. I've
found it necessary to use whole or plug hops. Pellets seem
to clog the EM. Whole hops act as a filter bed and filter
out th hot and cold break leaving bright wort when used
with an imersion chiller. When used with a CF chiller the
EM prevents the hops and hot break from entering the chiller.

As I understand it, "standard" pitch rate for 5 gallons of ale is about one 
pint of starter.  That is what I use, and it has worked fine.  For a 
"higher" gravity beer (and for lagers i think), use more.  If you have FTP

In this mornings HBD there was a post (sorry I forget who) on techniques 
for cleaning beer lines between kegs.  The poster said he bought a garden 
sprayer and made modifications to it.  While this will work well, my 
feeling is that you already have all the equipment you need to clean your 
lines.  I do this between each keg I put on line.  I just fill an empty 
keg with cleaning solution (iodophor solution etc) and run it through the 
line using my regular connections.  I then open the lines and collect the 
run off in a bucket.  I follow this with a rinse with clear water and run 
it out the line until nothing but CO2 comes out the line.  I am now ready 
for the next keg to go on line.  OF course, I do take the tap off line at 
the end of this process and clean it as well.  Simple safe and I don't 
need more gadgets :-(...  I do use a small amount of CO2 in the process 
but I have a 20lb tank and it is cheap and lasts a long time.


Hope this helps ....

Subject:       Draft Mix (CO2 & N2)


SITUATION:
My roommates and I have built a couple of "keggerators" out of old 
fridges and keep beer (mainly store bought) on tap in them at all times.  
About two months ago we got a Guiness keg and tapped it using a 
cylinder of "draft mix" which is provided to the bars etc, by the 
distributor to tap Guiness and Young Oatmeal Stout.  The draft mix is 
simply a mixture of CO2 and Nitrogen (N2) in a single cylinder.  


This worked, but not perfectly.  At first we got exactly the creamy head 
you'd expect on a draft Guiness, but as the month went on it got flatter 
and less creamy until we eventually had to pour out (don't hate me for this) 
probably the last two gallons which had been deemed undrinkable.  It didn't 
get sour or anything just kinda flat and definately NOT CREAMY.  We 
had the pressure on the keg at 20+ lbs.  which is more than the 10-15 lbs. 
we usually use to tap a keg with CO2.


QUESTIONS:
What is the "correct" mix of N2 to CO2 in "draft mix"?
        What is the effect of different mixtures?
        What characteristics are the two gasses responsible for?
What is the correct pressure to tap beer (stouts) with draft mix?
        Is that different from CO2?  Why?
Is the flow control faucet used on Guiness and Oatmeal at bars essential?
        Why?  Is it essential due to increased pressure?
If I had separate CO2 and N2 cylindars how would I determine the 
pressures necessary to obtain a certain ratio of gasses in the mixture?  


This doesn't DIRECTLY relate to homebrewing, but I'd like to use a draft 
mix on my homebrewed stouts. Nothing can replace that creamy mouth feel 
a good Guiness on tap (or in a draft can) has got going on.  I'm willing 
to buy a flow-control faucet from Rapids (about $80) if necessary.
 
Thanks.

Driving into work this morning I heard an astonishing radio ad for Kirin.  In it
the announcer comments that Kirin's beer is made from only the "high quality 
first pressings" as opposed to other beers that are made by mixing the "first, 
second, and third pressings".


I suppose that Kirin could use some sort of forced lautering process (so the 
wort _might_ be described as a "pressing"), but more likely the ad company has 
no clue how beer is made and thought it was similar to wine making.


Anyone know if Kirin really uses some sort of novel "pressing" process to 
produce wort?

First, I have to say you should drink most of the beer from BOTH and use the 
slurry from BOTH.  


Second, if there's not slurry, there may be no yeast.  


Third, I don't know if Schneider's does this, but several commercial 
weissbeers are filtered from their special (S. Delbruckii) yeast, then 
primed with a regular S. Cerevisiaeou(and sometimes y) yeast.  Thus, the 
yeast you culture from this bottle might not be the yeast that gives the 
beer its distinctive flavor.


I was confused for a long time as to why anyone would do that, why they
would filter their special yeast out.  Then, I made a batch.  And, I found
that if you keep the temperatures below 50-55 F, the yeast produce very 
little banana esters and a lot of yummy phenolics.  However, when the temp
rises, it reverses, and the stuff tastes like Chiquita.  This effect happened
in bottle-primed beers that had finished weeks earlier, and it would take 
a couple weeks in the cool to reduce the esters, and it would never get as
low as it had been originally.

                  EXPLODING CO2 CYLINDER !!!


  Now that I have everybody's attention, I will pose my question
again.


  I've just began kegging beer using Corny kegs and a CO2 sytem
and on my sixth keg (now being dispensed) I've been having some
pressure fluctuations. If I set the regulator to say 8 lbs. the
regulator can be heard filling the tank and then stop at 8 lbs. .
But then if I check it say an hour later, the pressure is at 15 lbs. .
All previous kegs stayed right on the money where i set it. I bought
the regulator new through Superior. The fermentation is complete as I
achieved my FG. It worked perfectly up until this batch.
My feelings are that there is something wrong with the regulator but
I figured I would tap the knowledge of the Digest befor I sent it
back. It is a double guage regulator on a 10 lb. tank.


              Thanks in advance for all input !

RIMS stands for Recirulating Infusion Mash System.  The simplest form
of a RIMS system (true to the exact name) is a mash tun with false
bottom and a pump to pump out the wort from under the false bottom and
return it gently to the top of the grain bed.  With no more equipment
than this, one can perform a single step infusion mash and get all the
benefits of recirculation (crystal clear wort, evenness of
temperature).  Your temperature will drop more than if you just did a
single step infusion mash because the wort is recirculating out and
through the pump.


However, even though the above description is technically a RIMS
system, a RIMS system as more commonly implemented puts a low density
heater in a pipe chamber controlled by a solid state temperature
controller and pumps the wort out of the mash tun, through the heater
chamber and back into the mash tun.  This has the advantage of being
able to maintain and even boost temperatures, making upward step
infusion mashes quite easy.


The best written reference to a RIMS system is the article by Rodney
Morris in the 1992 Zymurgy Special Issue on Gadgets.  Hopefully, this
fall, the best written reference available will be my book on how to
build a RIMS system (kind of like the "Complete Idiot's Guide to VW
Repair").  Rodney did a great job of describing how to build a RIMS
system if you have a *lot* of mechanical skills.  Heck, what do you
expect in 4 pages in a magazine.  I will be assuming you have almost
no mechanical skills and will teach all necessary to build a RIMS
(short of welding, this is best left to the pros if you are not
already good at it).

For best results, rehydrate 1 TBSP (or so) of IM with about 1-2c warm
water 24 hrs before brewing.  ok, so, you forgot to rehydrate.  i usually
forget and rehydrate it starting at the mash, about 2 hrs from the boil.
then, i pitch the rehydrated stuff at 15 mins LEFT in the boil.  


i used to pitch dry IM into the boiler 15 mins out from boil completion.
when i started rehydrating (got the idea from a George Fix post), it made
a big diff in beer clarity.

Subject: CO2 Regulator problems


Terry,


If you have used the regulator on other kegs and had no problems of 
pressure overshoot, I think that the regulator is fine.  You could 
always test this by pressurizing an empty keg and checking the pressure 
after a couple of hours.  If a regulator goes bad, ie, the needle valve 
leaks, the pressure of the keg would not stop a 15 psi (setting it at 8 
psi), the pressure would continue to build until ... 


There are two possible answers to your situation:


1) the fermentation was not quite finished.  The CO2 produced would
increase the pressure inside the keg because it can not escape from the 
sealed system. 


2) the temperature of the keg changed.  (I think that this is the case.)
As the temperature of the keg rises, the pressure will rise as well. 
Since gases are not as soluable at higher temperatures, the pressure would
rise more than the ideal gas law would predict (PV=nRT).

Subject: False Bottom Questions




I am considering buying some equipment to build a three vessel, ten
gallon brewery.  East Coast Brewing offers a "Precision Brewing Systems"
(PBS) 15 gallon (Vollrath SS) brew kettle having a bottom drain and ball
valve installed that appeals to me for use as a mash tun for a variety
of reasons.  They also offer a 0.020 inch thick folding stainless steel
false bottom for the kettle that has 3/32" holes placed on 5/32" centers.
The false bottom rests a little more than one inch above the bottom of
the kettle supported on eight legs.  The bottom drain has a 3/8" ID and
is mounted underneath the false bottom on the side of the kettle. 


I am curious what kinds of experiences people have had with configurations
similar to that described above.  Specifically, it seems to me that
the hole size is a little bigger than optimum and that setting the filter
bed might take a little longer than is necessary, particularly in light
of the fact that I do a lot of decoction mashing and would prefer to
continue this practice in the larger brew length.


Note that I already have a magnetic drive pump that I would use to
recirculate the mash as needed.  It could be that since I would use
a pump on the mash tun that a little extra time to set the grain bed is
not important.  What do you think?


Any and all contributions related to this topic are appreciated.


Thanks,
Bryan P. Dawe

Last week I asked about boiling a full 7-8 gal on the stovetop.  I
got a number of responses ranging from "I do it all the time, no

I wanted to say thanks to all who responded.  "Thanks to all who

Next I have a question.  A friend is currently brewing a bock (I know
it's out of season but who cares?).  It's his first attempt at a lager
and I have never tried one myself so we're just sort of winging it.
It's been in the primary about 1 1/2 weeks and the bubbling had slowed
substantially (15 secs/bubble) so he decided to rack to a secondary
today.  In the process he took a hydrometer reading and it came out
1.034 (down from 1.064 OG).  So it seems the fermentation has a ways
to go yet before it's done.  The beer was still quite cloudy indicating
there was still a lot of yeast hanging around but we left quite a bit
of yeast in the bottom of the primary.  Are we at risk for a stuck
fermentation here?  My feeling is that the beer should continue to
ferment fine but it would ease our minds to have that confirmed.
So what do the experienced lager brewers have to say?  Assuming is
does ferment out would you recommend racking off the yeast again
for the lagering?  How long to lager?  (BTW, the beer is in a fridge
at constant 50 F).


Also, we tasted some (of course) and there is a perceptible butterscotch
note (diacetyl, right?).  So it seems a diacetyl rest is called for.
How and when is the proper way to do a diacetyl rest?  Any suggestions?


Finally, over the weekend I tasted Pete's Wicked Summer Brew.  It's a
partial wheat brew with a subtle "tang of lemon" or so the label claims.
There is a slight lemon flavor in the first few swallows which I found
annoying but other than that I thought it was rather nice.  It's not
trying to be a true wheat beer, IMHO, but it seems they used some amount
of wheat to simply lighten the body.  Anyway, it's a nice light beer
for quenching your thirst on those hot summer days and in that light I
think they've succeeded.  In fact, I enjoyed it enough that I was
inspired to brew something similar for the summer.  So if you see it
around you may want to pick up a six pack and give it a try.  (No, I'm
not affiliated with Pete's in any way, etc., etc.)

Subject: Three Bad Batches in a Row


Well, the bad news is I think on my third contaminated batch. :(


The good news is I found the problem.  Boy was it a hard one to find.  It 
turns out that I have a very small microsopic crack in my glass carboy.  I 
still can't find it but I know it's there.  Normally I put a towel under my 
carboy, and wrap with a damp towel so the the temp will stay around 68F.  
The towel on the bottom was soaking up the beer leak underneath the carboy.  
The loss was very small and I just assumed it was due to the blowoff.   
Well, after two bad batches I sanitized the heck out of everything.  
Including cholorine and water overnight in the carboy instead of the normal 
2hrs.  I had filled the carboy to the top and the next morning it was down 
from the top of the mouth to the bottom of the mouth.  I was curious, but 
didn't think anything of it.  Then for some reason, I didn't put a towel 
underneath this time.  The next morning I noticed wort around the bottom of 
the carboy.  I cleaned it up and just figured I must have spilled some (even 
though I knew I cleaned it up).  The next morning, my wort was even at a 
lower level, though just a little lower and there was more beer around the 
bottom of the carboy.


Moral:  If you get a bad batch for no known reason, fill your carboy with 
water and let it set a few days.  If the water level drops, then buy a new 
carboy.

I aerate my starter by whipping it for a minute or two at the end of the
boil.  (Still hot enough to hopefully kill any nasty's, and its *starter* HSA
is not an issue.)

Does anybody have a review of the "Brewcap"?  It sounds like a nifty idea, but
I'd like to hear from someone who has experience with it.
Any comments, regrets, suggestions are welcome.

Subject: Closed fermenting in a Corny.


Howdy,


I just came from Spencer's Beer Page on the Web and have searched the HBD
for some insite on this brewing method (all inside closed Corny kegs, and
after its done fermenting, you can drink your carbonated beer right away
without waiting for conditioning). Nada, zip, zero, it just ain't there. I
might have been searching for the wrong term ('closed ferment') but I don't
think so. The method that I'm looking for is the one in the Tip's and
gadgets special issue of Zymurgy. 


So, my question is, is there any one out there that uses this system? Are
there any articles out that can be ftp'ed? 


Thanks in advance for any help that you can give.

There are Plastic Hydrometers made by a company called ERTCO and sold by
Cole-Palmer.
They are Polycarbonate and cost $37

Subj: RE:  Malt Variety vs. FG
 
I guess the title is a bit misleading:  I really just want to know how to
bring my FG's down to the levels I was getting with a simple 2-step infusion
(i.e.~ 15 typically for an IPA).  I fully expected the Scottish ale to
finish high, but not the weizen or IPA.
 
It seems to me as though the rest at 140 F does virtually nothing at all,
and the entire conversion is taking place at 158 F, hence the high FG's.
This is the logic which prompted me to increase the 2nd rest to 145 F.  Yes,
this was not a controlled study in any way, shape or form.  I just notice a
difference when using this mashing sequence.
 
I have been brewing all-grain for the past 5 years, using both decoction &
infusion mashes, making a wide variety of beers, and always have gotten FG's
in the low-mid teens (except BW's & other "strong" stuff).  I have been
using DWC malts for about the past 2 years, and with a "normal" 2-step
infusion (122 F/30 min; 154 F/1 h) have also been getting significantly
lower FG's.  This is a concern to me because I would like to brew a few
lighter styles for the summer months.
 
Maybe it is apples & oranges, but the FG of my pils using the Shreier malt
was "significantly" lower than an almost identical beer (except hops) using
DWC.  The data sheets for both malts show them having about the same
enzymatic strength (Siebel INst.).  Is it possible they have different
ratios of alpha/beta amylase???  Just curious.
 
I'm going to brew an English bitter this weekend (15# DWC PA + 1#xtal).  I'm
shooting for an OG around 40-45 and hope to get the FG down to 10-15.
Should I abandon this mash schedule (40/60/70) in favor of a 2-step or
single infusion?
