Subject: CO2 Pressure Fluctuations




Greetings,


  Chris Sack responded to my dilemma of pressure fluctuations from
the CO2 regulator. Two problems Chris mentioned were :


      1) Fermentation was not quite finished
      2) Temperature of the keg changed


  I think I can definitely rule out both of these. My final gravity
fell right where it was expected to. As for point 2, my keg system
is in my basement which maintains a steady cool temperature. My kegs
are kept in a fridge and are fed by the CO2 tank which is outside the
fridge (to prevent moisture in the regulator and leave enough room
for 2 kegs in the fridge). Even if fermentation were not complete,
I can't see the pressure climbing as much as it does.
  I will try Chris's experiment by putting some water in another
keg and put pressure on it to test it out that way and post the
results. Thanks Chris !


  Dom Venezia also questioned why I kept live pressure on my kegs.
I do this when artificially carbonating - 48 hours under 15 lbs of
pressure into the refrigerated beer - works perfectly for me ! Also
recently because of the problem I noticed.

For my 2 cents worth on this subject, it is the faucet not the gas
that makes the creamy pour. I have three of those Guiness faucets
on my home draft setup and they pour almost any beer with that same texture
of foam. I am dispencing with premixed 70% N2, 30% CO2 gas.

Subject: Pico-System Pump Problems & stuff


 
 Hi, All,
 
 Well, thanks to the many responses that I have received concerning the problems
 that I was having with my new Pico-System pumps, I've come up with a plan for
 the next batch.  It seems that these type of pumps are not self priming and are
 quite sensitive to *any* air bubbles in the housing.  I think that the secret
 is to fill the vessels *through* the pumps with the garden hose.  That should
 eliminate any air bubble problems.  The problem with a few of my hop flowers
 getting through the copper screen will be solved by putting a copper "Chore 
 Boy" under the pickup tube.  I'll also put one under the tube in the mash 
 vessel to catch any "rogue" grains that might find their way to the spray 
 head.   %^)
 
 Thanks to everyone who responded to my post.  Even Mike O'Brien from 
 Pico-Systems responded.  
 
 I just can't speak highly enough about this system.  I thought that the move up
 from extract brewing to all grain in a Gott cooler was a profound difference.
 This setup is celestial.  Even the way that they pack everything for shipping
 was remarkable.  I guess the only improvement that I can make now is to build
 a micro-brewery with a "Bohemia" type modular system and hang out a shingle.
 I'm not affiliated, and all that.  Just a HAPPY customer.

I have been colecting some info on malting and particularly wheat malt 
for a potental research project.  I was suprised to learn that wheat malt 
yields higher extract than barley.  I think that must be because wheat is 
hulless.  The increased body and mouthfeel come from proteins.

Regarding recirculaton Lance asks:
- ----------------------------------


>What difference does it make whether it takes 1 quart to
>get clear runoff or 5 gallons to get clear runoff?  


This is a good question--mine is this: what difference does it make if it
*ever* runs clear?  When doing stovetop mashing of an all-grain beer I
don't do recirculation at all.  I maintain the temperature by sitrring 
the mash frequently enough.  When the mash goes into the kettle it of has
a good deal of particulate matter in it.  I have noticed no difference 
in the final product between this technique and recirculated.  Assume no
husks get into the kettle--none do in my process.


>The grain bed is the actual filter anyway, not the screen, so why 
>restrict the flow.


Not sure what you mean by 'why restrict the flow'.  The screens I've
described are only about 10% open vs your 70%, but this isn't due to a 
desire to restrict the flow.  It's only that 10% open provides ample 
flow and 1) that's what the first pre-fab screens had, or 2) that was
the practical limit of how many holes I could drill in my plate.  So I 
don;t think there is a concious effort to resrict the flow with the 
screen design.


If you're talking about maintaining a reduced recirculation rate during 
a temperature soak, *my* only objective is to ensure minimum distrubance 
to the grain bed.  I know someone out there has claimed recirculation 
itself has a deleterious effect on the beer--I wish I could cite this 
and I definitely don't know if it has been substantiated or not.


I'd like to hear your comments on these issues...as well on one more:


I think everyone's heard the story: the husks fall to the bottom of the 
grain bed and provide a filter bed that small particles get trapped in.
Is this another Momism?  Has anyone allowed the grain bed to drain for 
several hours, then actually attemped to section it and look at the 
particle size distribution?  Do I have the Momism wrong, or is it just 
me that has never seen any evidence of such a distribution?

Subject: Gelatin


Matt Kelly (HBD 1734) asks about using gelatin if Irish Moss has been omitted
during the boil; and will this help prevent chill haze.


In 39 years of home brewing, I have found that neither IM nor gelatin have
helped clarify the resulting beer. 


Neither gelatin nor Irish Moss prevent chill haze.


Gelatin when added to the beer shortly before bottling forms a coating on the
sides of the bottle that can be removed by twisting the bottle sharply, after
which it will fall to the bottom as sediment. This has nothing to do with
keeping the yeast on the bottom nor does it prevent the yeasties from
conditioning the beer.


I have had some success in reducing chill haze by a 3-week secondary rest (it's
not exactly a secondary fermentation as there are no overt signs of
fermentation) at as cool a temperature as possible, then clarifying with
Polyclar about 3 days before bottling. Chill haze in lagers can be reduced by
chilling to 32 dF for 3 weeks then clarifying as above. 


It is a waste of time to use Irish moss, and worse than nothing to use gelatin.

I use a scoop/strainer that came with wife's "Fry Daddy" mini deep
fryer.  It's like a very wide, shallow spoon with slots.  The 
secret is to pick up as little fluid as possible.  Don't press
it dry or wait until it stops dripping but use a utinsil that 
allows most of the fluid to drain off when you take a scoop.  The
husks of grain will retain all the fluid you need.

Hey folks,
 
I'm about to embark on the oddesy of making an imperial stout.  I am aware of,
and understand, many of the considerations of high gravity brewing (i.e. proper
aeriation, suficient yeast starter, stringent temp control during
fermentation).  What I'm looking for advice on is the mashing process.
 
 What is it that prompts brewers to use only the first runings of a mash to
make a strong beer?  Does it have to do with the tannins that would be
extracted during sparging?  I'm ready and willing to be educated... <g>

Subject: stuck fermentations/Franklin malt/mercury


I rarely get a stuck fermentation, but whenever I try
and make a tripel I get one! I recently made a tripel
that stuck at 1.040 after starting at 1.090. I believe that
tripels are *very* sensitive to getting stuck due to high
initial glucose levels. I don't have a textbook handy, 
but I believe this is known as the Crabtree effect: the 
idea being that above a certain glucose concentration,
the yeast bypasses the aerobic phase at pitching, and
starts fermenting the glucose straight away, causing
fermentation problems later. (if this is wrong I'm
sure all the Al robots will correct me!). I used a huge,
healthy 3944 (white) starter, and aerated with an
aquarium thingy etc.. I am especially careful when
making tripels, but they still get stuck.
Once before I aerated a tripel again after a very slow 3
month (!) fermentation. Well it worked, and restarted
the yeast. The beer was delicious for about 2 months,
but deteriorated after that due to oxidation.
This time I added "Modiferm" which is just beta amylase
(I think), which also restarted the ferment after about a day.
The trouble is, that these are just fixes for a problem I
would sooner avoid in the first place. I worry about adding
enzymes, as of course it changes the sugar content of
the beer that I carefully nurtured in my mashing schedule.
The beer may ferment, but Is My Beer Ruined? (this
deserves an acronym "IMBR").
Enough rambling - the point is, for all you expert tripel
brewers out there, do you ever have a similar problem,
and if so, how do you avoid it? I thought of leaving out
the brewing sugar from the boil, (reducing initial glucose
levels), pitch the yeast, wait until peak krausen, then
adding the sugar at this stage, hopefully getting a 
proper ferment.
Any suggestions are welcome.
******
Ken Willing talks about Franklin malt that I have also started
using. 
Additional data: 8% protein content, high 30's soluble nitrogen ratio
(Referred to as "Kolbach Index" in Europe and Australia).
This means it would produce wort with very low FAN, if no
protein rest is used. The maltster recommends a protein rest,
otherwise it won't ferment, but obviously with such a low protein
content you don't really want to do that with respect to body,
head retention etc.. In regard to Ken's comments, I was wondering
about using a protein rest around 55C to maximise protease
activity.. ie. breaking down the large haze-forming proteins,
rather than the desirable medium sized proteins. My question is,
does such a rest break the large polypeptides down to (desirable)
amino acids for the yeast to use, or (useless) smaller proteins?
In any event, yeast nutrient (ammonium salts) may be the way to
go, as a protein rest does not appear desirable with this malt.
I'll do some tests on this Ken, and get back to you.
******
As a kid I tried to get out of going to school by heating a mercury
thermometer with a match. I cracked the glass unknowingly, then
stuck it in my mouth to show Mum how sick I was. Well it broke
and I swallowed the lot. That was more than 20 years ago.
For those of you who know me, it might explain my current 
condition........

The |more will cause the display to be shown a screen at a time.  Also,

Subject: Beekeeper's Brown ... a treat for the extract brewers!


It's been quite a while since I've had a good recipe to post to the digest,
but this one definitely deserves to be passed along!  This one is for the
extract brewers---I'm limited by space, $$$, etc. (mostly space), and
still brew from certain kits (i.e., the ones I really like) every now and
then.


Not too long ago, I decided to brew a brown ale using, along with the
standard stuff for the kit, honey.  The result is every bit as good as
I'd hoped.  I hope you'll enjoy it, too.  Basically, I took the Ironmaster
Brown Ale kit, used corn sugar instead of malt (I was feeling really cheap
that day), and added honey.  I call it Beekeeper's Brown, and it goes
something like this:


- ---------------------------  CUT HERE  ---------------------------


For 6 U.S. gallons:


1 Ironmaster Brown Ale beer kit
about 5.5 cups corn sugar, as with just about any kit
2 lbs honey (*NOT* boiled)
1/2 cup corn sugar for priming


Started Sun 30 April, O.G.: 1.045
Bottled Sun 14 May, F.G.: 1.000 (*)


Sampled today, 21 May, and it's already *VERY* nice!


(*) It needed that full two weeks---as usual with honey, the fermenting
    started very early, went full steam for a long, long time, and went
    very much to completion.


- ---------------------------  CUT HERE  ---------------------------


Comments:  medium bodied brew, nice full flavor, and generally a very nice
brown.  I'd like to think that I'll be able to save some for when my mom
and step-father (who is from England) arrive in town next month, but I'm
not so sure that's going to happen.  ;-}


I'm not sure how I found time to brew this one during that time period (I
was busy working on a huge network upgrade at work, which I'm glad to say
went extremely well!), but I'm glad I did!  :-)


This one isn't just good ``for a kit beer'' ... it's good, period.  :-)


Enjoy.

I have recently purchased The Beer Hombrewing Guide CDROM and found your e-mail
address on it.
Although I only a novice when it comes to brewing beer I would be interested in
learning more, so with that in mind I would like to ask for somemore information
on the Homebrew Digest and wether or not it is possible for a UK resident to
subcribe to it.
Also do you know of any magazines on beer brewing that I might be able to
obtain.

Subject: Praise be gelatin!


Hey All,


Well, I finally tried it----gelatin, that is.  I boiled about a cup of water 
and placed it in a thoroughly cleaned and sanitized 8 oz. mayonnaise jar, 
added 1/2 packet of Knox(tm) unflavored gelatin, allowed to cool, and added 
directly to the secondary 2 days prior to kegging.  The effect was amazing!  
Visibly noticeable clarification in the carboy within about 8 hours and 
steadily improving as time continues to pass.  It appears as if this practice 
will become part of the SOPs in my brewery.


Incidentally, the mayo jar also makes a great irish moss rehydration vessel.  
I also tried IM rehydration for the first time this past weekend----I'm 
convinced the wort was already more clear in the primary, but I could have 
just had anticipatory hallucinations or something.


Re: starters.  FWIW, I prepare 600-ml starters `at` about 1.050 OG with a few 
hop pellets and culture the yeast in a 1000-ml Erlenmeyer.  I pitch an 
inflated Wyeast packet and top the flask with aluminum foil.  I vigorously 
swirl the starter every time I get the chance.  The foil and swirling 
presumably keeps things aerobic, which builds higher cell counts.  I let this 
mixture "ferment" out and pitch within a day or so.  I almost always have 
vigorous ferments within 12 hours with the ale yeasts I've tried.  Recently, 
I was forced to wait an additional week before pitching (the starter "beer" 
had completely clarified and tasted very nice while brewing!).  As a result, 
vigorous fermentation did not occur until about 20 hours after pitching (this 
was 1084 Irish).  As always, YMMV.


Dion:  My mailer couldn't reach yours, so thanks for the info on the upcoming 
book---I look forward to it.


Eamonn (sp?), you got "Tim" just right---now try my last name. ;-)  And 
thanks for the RIMS info---keep it coming!

Subject: Mercury - it's in the water


Something I thought would be fun to throw out here, in this mercury
discussion, is the amount of free metalic mercury that is found in
the Arkansas River, here in Colorado....   I know of several people
who run gold dredges (recreationally), and one guy says that he will
commonly extract up to 1/4 lb of mercury from the Arkansas River during
a Satrurday afternoon operation, in the areas where the old prospectors 
would sluice for gold with mercury in their equipment.  Knowing how 
common it is to find mercury in the river, the water analysis content of 
mercury from the river is very low and safe.   Yet, much of that water 
passed thru the area where the mercury exists commonly!

  On the subject of adding ingredients containing oil to beer (as in 
  coconut), I have added coffee and chocolate with no problems.  My recipe 
  for "Mocha Java Stout" in the Cat's Meow includes 4 oz. of Ghirardelli 
  unsweetened chocolate and 2 cups of brewed coffee.  The head on that brew 
  was incredible.  The one thing that I noticed was that there were gobs of 
  something that I took to be cocoa butter floating on top during 
  fermentation.  It could be that all the oils congealed in the relative 
  coolness of the wort and were rendered harmless.
  
  On another subject, a couple of weeks ago I opened up the Charlotte

The following abstract just crossed my desk, though the article was

of computer-literate brewers.  Note: I don't have access to this journal,
so I haven't actually seen this paper.  I'm not connected with the authors

"A new beer fermentation model is developed based upon fundamental
knowledge of biochemical pathways.  The model can be subdivided into a
growth model, an amino acid model, and a flavor/aroma model.
Experimentation allowed for accurate model parameter identification.  The
results demonstrate the capability to accurately describe batch beer
fermentation dynamics."


Perhaps if someone in net-land finds the paper useful/interesting they
could post more information here.

Health food stores also carry wheat flakes. These are unmalted and

Subject: crystal malt, hop plant, grain type


Several points:


Has anyone steeped crystal malts from DeWolf-Crosyn (Belgian malts) using the
170 degree F for about 30 minutes and then used the iodine test for starch
conversion.  I have done this twice and got very dark blue-black colors on
the superenatant indicating much starch with cara pils.  Should this be so?
 Crystal malts are supposed to be premashed in the hulls, so no further
mashing is necessary.


Darren Tyson asks about some Briitish malt he recieved and wondered what it
was.  He should chew it and taste it besides smelling it.  Is it sweet?


Jim Webb asked about planting hot rhizomes.  The direction they're planted is
not critical as they will find which way is up.  It will just take longer.
 The idea is to look where the active shoots will bud from and let that part
aim upwards.

I use Corny Kegs to ferment also. A potential solution to this problem is
to lay the Corny down. Rotate the keg until the "GAS IN" inlet is oriented
up. Elevate the connection end of the tank about 3 inches. Put a scrap
2"x4" under the lid end. This will move the head space up under the GAS IN
inlet. Then use an old connector with some tubing in some kind of blow off
arrangement. A 5 gal. Corny will normally lay down in a beer refrigerator
with about 1/2" to spare. Great for lagering. Haven't calculated the aspect
ratio for horizontal yet. Any takers?

Yes, I'm afraid your Volrath 38qt stainless kettle is ruined. The

     BEER JUDGE PROGRAMS
     I once heard a comedian say, "If you're not going to kick a guy when 
     he's down, then when are you?  I guess if you're in a brawl, there's 
     some sense to that.  And right now the American Homebrewer's 
     Association and the Home Wine & Beer Trade Association are brawling.  
     Their Beer Judge Certification Program (or the AHA HWBTA BJCP, which 
     is pronounced like an explosive sneeze, for the acronymicly gifted) 
     has gone down for the count to be replaced by Ninkenski knows what.  
     It seems the two associations can no longer stand the sight, smell,or 
     suggestions of the other and reached for their dueling Pilsners. 
     
     Plainly, this hobby isn't big enough for the both of them. So I think 
     this is a good time for someone as caustic as myself to get in a few 
     kicks.  
     
     First, let's examine beer style categories.  Most people think you 
     need to have categories and beer style standards & definitions to have 
     a contest and judge beer.  I mean, how the hell are you going to fill 
     out the damn score sheet if you don't have the standard of a category 
     to compare an entry to?  this could be utter chaos! If you don't have 
     categories and standards, then all you can say is whether or not the 
     beer you are judging looks good, tastes good, and if you would like to 
     drink it again.  Now if that ain't anarchy then God didn't make little 
     green bombs and there ain't acid rain in Indianapolis.  
     
     Just think of it. What if someone made a pale yellow barley wine? 
     Well, right away you're in a fix because these suckers are suppose to 
     be dark brown.  Says so in the style book!  Maybe the guy over 
     filtered?  Sorry Sam Warmack-- everybody knows you can't do Yellow Dog 
     Wine.  Toss it out. Spices? Bubble Gum has spices Piper-- give it to 
     that kid selling the 1958 Mickey Mantle baseball card for  $450 and 
     maybe he'll cut you a deal.
     VIVA LA CONFORMITY!
     
     Well, listen up, ole horse drop, you say-- if standards and style 
     definitions are so damn bad, did you ever try to judge the 
     Specialties?  How do you deal with all that nonsense?  Apricot Lambic, 
     indeed.  Who ever herd of apricots in a salad dressing?  
     
     But we do manage to judge Specialties, don't we!  And how often does 
     the specialty category end up either first or second in the "best of 
     show" round?  Could there be something to this Anarchy?
     
     The problem I have with beer judging and beer style categories and 
     standards is that they are creative death.  Nobody ever grew in life 
     by always trying to copy someone else  To copy is to exercise in 
     technique and technique alone.  Consider the American Pilsner, the 
     white bread of beer, clone city.  Any biologist trying to get the 
     Nobel Prize for cloning should consider switching from poison frogs 
     eggs to Pilsner beer kegs.
     
     Who can tell one American Pilsner from another?  This is progress?  
     Since when is sheer banality and lack of product differentiation 
     something to strive for?  True, the labels are all different.  But 
     consider the net effect of having a beer judge program with style 
     STANDARDS and the encouragement of conformity to that standard:  the 
     emphasis is all on technique and copy.   Any feature that makes a 
     beer unique is in contrast to that style definition and counts 
     against the entry.  This process not only kicks an innovative brewer 
     in the teeth, but it contaminates the expectations of the entire 
     brewing community!  Such emphasis on style standards reduces the 
     sensibility of judges,  those people who should be the champions of 
     excellence, to being champions of conformity.  HUMBUG!  HUMBUG, I 
     say!

Just another grain of salt to take with any speciation.  I've made, and

really Delbruckii, or if it's not really what they use in Bavaria, well, 
that's fine with me.  (But, I am curious about the truth...)

The quantity of oil in hops is extremely small.  I don't know whether a large
amount of these would negatively affect head retention or not, but 1 oz. of 
hops does NOT contain 1 oz. of hop oils.  The taste treshold for hop oil is
MUCH lower than that for coconut oil.  So, to get a similar "quantity of taste"
from coconut oil as you do from hop oil, you'd need a LOT.  Probably enough to
ruin your head formation and retention.  (Like I said, I don't know if hop oil
will ruin it, but I know coconut oil will wreck your head faster than you 
can say "hey".)


That's not to say you shouldn't go ahead.  There's more to life than head 
retention, and I'd be willing to try a coconut beer sometime.

Almost certainly.  Dried coconut still has lots of oils.  (Read the nutrition
information.)  It's possible that the "coconut" flavor comes from something
OTHER than the oil, so it's possible you might be able to find some way to
extract the flavor without extracting the oil.  Dried coconut isn't the way.

Well then.  Anyone have any first-hand experience tossing a couple pennies
into the boil or fermenter?  I was considering using pennies as "boiling
stones" a couple batches ago, but I was worried about copper getting into my
beer.  (Oops.)  Next batch, I'll give it a shot, maybe with a 'split batch'.
