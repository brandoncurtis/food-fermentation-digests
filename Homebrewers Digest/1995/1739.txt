The reason mercury amalgam fillings are illegal in Sweden is that it 
is illegal to use mercury of any sort in that country. Since you need 
to use elemental mercury in the manufacture of dental amalgam, you 
therefore can't use mercury containg amalgam.


As far as health claims about the toxicity of dental amalgam, the 
evidence is lacking. When '60 Minutes' aired their piece, I was 
inundated with people wanting their fillings changed. That has 
thankfully fallen off. I had one patient with MS that was convinced 
that her amalgams were the cause of her disease. She demanded all her 
fillings replaced as well as any metal under crowns. She wouldn't 
listen to me. After thousands of dollars, her MS didn't 'clear up' and 
she wanted her money back. I told her to call '60 Minutes".


As far as I am concerned, claims of mercury/amalgam toxicity are good 
for business but bad for the patient. So which side is more credible?


I would rather not have to use material that uses mercury because it 
gets into the environment when it is in its elemental form during the 
manufacturing process. We occasionally spill some in the office. But 
until something better comes along, it is the best option. A gallium 
amalgam is being introduced this year. We will keep our fingers 
crossed.

What exactly is taking place when beer ages.  As it goes from the "green"

Todd writes:
>What is the "correct" mix of N2 to CO2 in "draft mix"?


It depends on the length of your lines and other mathematical things.
Basically, what you want to do is to dispense your stout at high pressure,
but to not overcarbonate it.  N2 is virtually insoluble in beer.  If your
normal (100% CO2) pressure is 12 psi for your line length/diameter, and
you are using 75% N2 / 25% CO2 mix, then you want to use 48 psi.  To your
beer, this will look like 12 psi of CO2 and the beer will stay carbonated.


>        What is the effect of different mixtures?


I heard of 85/15, 75/25 and 70/30 mixes, but there may be others.
line length and diameter determines which you want.


>        What characteristics are the two gasses responsible for?


The CO2 is for maintaining the carbonation and the N2 (along with the
CO2) is for pushing the beer out at a high pressure.


>What is the correct pressure to tap beer (stouts) with draft mix?


Actually, my above statement is backwards (the one about the 48 psi).
I don't know what pressure you want the mix at -- ask any bar that
serves Guinness or the supplier of the keg.  What you want to do is
to choose the gas mix that, at the pressure you need to use, say 48 psi,
your beer sees the proper pressure of the CO2-portion of the gas.
Clear as stout?  If not, email me.


>        Is that different from CO2?  Why?


See above.


>Is the flow control faucet used on Guiness and Oatmeal at bars essential?


It has a perforated disk in it that causes the beer to foam and create that
head.  You can probably get away with just opening your regular tap just
a little bit.  The constriction will cause the turbulence you desire (this,
incidentally, is partly due to the venturi effect).


>        Why?  Is it essential due to increased pressure?


Not really, but there is an additional regulator on it, which probably
makes it easier for you to tune the system.  There are a lot more factors
at work here than in a regular system.


>If I had separate CO2 and N2 cylindars how would I determine the 
>pressures necessary to obtain a certain ratio of gasses in the mixture?  


I don't know if this will work.  I believe that the lower-pressure
regulator would not allow gas through at all.  There may be some
special regulators for this type of application.  If you are choosing
the mixed gas however, here's how you select it:


Find the pressure at which the distributor says to dispense the mix.
Next, determine the pressure of CO2 which, at your serving temperature
would produce the amount of carbonation you desire.  Subtract the CO2
pressure from the total pressure.  Let's call this result X and the
CO2 pressure Y.  The ratio of X to Y is the ratio of N2 to CO2 you
want.  The regulator for the mixed gas would be set to X plus Y.  You
will probably need to adjust your line lengths and line diameters, but
I don't know offhand how to determine them for a mixed-gas, high-pressure
system.

I've read that Schneider is one of the breweries that does NOT do this,
and it's not S. Cerevisiae, but S. Uvarum (lager yeast) that most other
brewers add.  Rumour has it that it is more stable than ale yeast.

I believe there is no pressing involved.  What Coors uses are called a "mash
filter" which looks like plate and frame filters -- they literally filter the
spent grain out of the wort.
 
Perhaps someone at Kirin explained the old methods of batch laeutering and
their current method of continuous laeutering and then the ad person mucked
it all up.  I think they also mixed up the term "pressings" with the term
"runnings."  Maybe it was a matter of translation?

A too-short rest at 154F will not make for a highly dextrinous wort, but
rather leave unconverted starch in the mash.  A rest at 136 or 140 *does*
do something.  It converts long proteins to medium-sized proteins.  30
minutes at 140 will not result in much beta-amylase activity, indeed.  If
your FG is too high, you can reduce it by adding a rest in the 145F-150F
range and/or by adding a rest at 122F.

Absolutely not.  Selection of extract (e.g. Laaglander is very high in
unfermentables) _is_ under the control of the extract brewer and as such
_does_ apply.  Also, crystal malts add unfermentables and their additions
are certainly under the control of extract brewers.  I feel that far too
many people look down on extract brewers -- even many extract brewers
appologize for being extract brewers.  There are almost as many variables
under the control of extract brewers as there are under the control of
allgrain brewers.  Excellent beer can be made either way.  Although I
currently brew about 75% of my batches using allgrain, that still leaves
25% extract brewing, right?  I bring both types to club meetings and get
compliments on the extract batches as well as the allgrain.  Although
there are a few limitations, there is no shame in brewing with extract!

Subject: Re: Electric stovetop brewing


In HBD 1736 and 1732 the upsides and downsides of electric stovetop brewing
have been discussed. I brewed on an electric stove for about 3 years, using
an 8 gallon canning pot as boiler, stradling two burners. I replaced two
burners, and finally had the burner receptacle on the large burner kind of
deteriorate, resulting in a 220v arc. At $20-30 a pop for burners, plus the
$27 for the receptacle, this got pricey and I recently got a propane cooker.
I think the long-term heat buildup on the stovetop causes the components to
age a lot faster than in normal cooking. YMMV.

I'm in the process of making a clone of Pyramid's Apricot Hefeweizen.  I 
used Wyeast #1338 European because of it's low attenuation.  This should 
make for a slightly sweeter beer which lends itself to the fruit flavor.  
I find that most of the actual fruit essence comes from aroma, not 
flavor so you don't want the yeast's characteristics to compete.  You do 
want some residual sweetness in your wheat beer, however.

Subject: Brewcap Brainstorm




I posted a message a little while back asking for information about Kinney
Baugham's Brewcap, and got a lot of great input on the subject.  I haven't
used the thing, but it sounds to me like the biggest problem people have
with it is in yeast sticking to the sides of their fermenting chamber
carboy.  Nobody wants to have to worry about agitating their brew >every
single day< to keep this from happening, so why couldn't some sort of
automatic system be made to do this?  Some ideas that came to mind were
sitting the carboy on a hacked-apart lazy susan and having a motor or
solenoid set up with an arm to jiggle the carboy once or twice a day,
or perhaps building an ultrasonic wave generator to keep the yeast away
from the sides to begin with.  I don't know about the cost or the effect-
iveness of these ideas, but I just thought I'd throw them out for y'all
to chew up.  Maybe you could just play really loud music next to it all
the time, and that would jiggle it loose..  ;-)  Keep the carboy mounted
on the hood of your car..  Send it across town via UPS once a week..
Make a head-mount for it and wear it like a hat..

A question to the collective:


  I am about to start my first batch with liquid yeast and have a question.


   I got a smack-pac of liquid weizen/ale yeast from my distributor.  I
followed the instructions on the package but decided to make a starter to
increase the amount of yeast.  I made a starter by boiling DME with water
(S.G. 1.040 approx).  I added the yeast from the smack-pac to the starter and
it took off in about 3 hours.  It hasn't hit high kreusen yet but it looks
like it will be ready tomorrow p.m.


  My question is - at the 4 hour mark there is alot of sediment at the bottom
of the bottle.  When I pitch - do shake the bottle to resuspend the sediment
or not??


  Private E-Mail to BierDude`at`aol.com is fine, but a public post might help
others out there lurking.


BTW - Now that I have posted, can I go back to just lurking?  There is some
perverse (voyeuristic) joy in just stay out here and lurking.

and Recipe Development.  Several first rate homebrews will be available
for tasting and analysis.  In addition, local BOP establishments will
have their products available for tasting and will be vying for the
"Peoples Choice" award.  The grand finale will be the awarding of the
1995 GCHC Competition Awards.


The weekend event will take place on June 10th and 11th at the Royal
Canadian Legion, Branch 101 (Longbranch), located at 3850 Lakeshore
Blvd. West in Etobicoke (just west of Browns Line).  Read on for more
detailed information.  See registration form for fees.

Subject: Yeast slant file on Stanford


Dear Friends, awhile back I put together a document on using slants to 
culture yeast that I emailed to people, posted to r.c.b., and through the 
good graces of Spencer's Beer Page and The Brewery, made web-accessible.  
Still, several have contacted me to suggest that it be put on the 
stanford archives, so I did.  It is in:


pub/clubs/homebrew/beer/docs


and the filename is using_slants.Z (it is one of those compressed files 
we've heard a bit about lately).  Basic instructions for accessing the 
stanford ftp site are listed in the header to every HBD.  Thanks to all 
those whose input made the file possible.


Cheers, Dave in Sydney

Subject: Corn sugar/To boil or not to boil/Two Dogs


G'day.
First, thanks to all the friendly folk who replied by personal e-mail to my
first post in HBD 1729.
I reckon it is worth summarising what I've found out from these letters and
also from some local sources here in Adelaide, just to set the record
straight:


American 'corn sugar' seems to be exactly the same as what we in Australia
know as 'white
sugar'/'table sugar'/'sucrose' -- in other words, that white crystalline
stuff that you can use to sweeten your coffee.
Australians (and English) use the word 'corn' to mean 'wheat' where
Americans use it in the American Indian Maize sense. So, American corn
sugar is Maize (corn) sugar (fermentable), or sucrose. In Australia,
sucrose is derived from sugar cane, rather than maize, and I believe that
in Europe they use sugar beet to produce the same product.


According to the packet, Dried Corn Syrup is a 'hydrolysed starch made from
wheat or corn. It is only 30% fermentable and therefore mostly remains in
solution in the beer, adding body and improving the head'. It is a fine
white powder, and appears to be the same substance that you in the USA know
as Malto-Dextrin.


I actually use Dextrose [often called 'Brewers' Sugar in Australia] in my
brews [I got a bit carried away when I said aka Sucrose :^( - blame the
excitement of my very first post!]. Domenick Venezia put it succintly in a
letter to me:


"Dextrose is NOT sucrose.  Dextrose (aka D-glucose, +-glucose, blood
sugar) is a monosaccharide (monomer).  Sucrose (table sugar) is a
disaccharide (polymer) consisting of a D-glucose molecule connected to a
D-fructose molecule.


Sucrose is C12H22O11; D-glucose is C6H12O6; D-fructose is C6H12O5."


I use sucrose to prime my bottles. [Actually it is a finer form of table
sugar known here as Caster sugar, but I hesitate to say much about it
except that it dissolves a bit quicker].


____________________
Thanks to Ruth Hegelson and Kirk Fleming, I can now admit to being -only-
an extract brewer, but I make great use of different adjuncts and love to
experiment [in the past 10 years or so, I can remember only one batch that
even I couldn't drink ;^( and only a handful that I wouldn't offer to my
mates].
Can I pose a question to my fellow extract HBDers:
Here's how I make up a 'normal' batch: I sit the can of extract in a small
pan of simmering water, (after making a small hole in the lid with my can
opener). This is to make the contents flow more easily. While this is
happening I dissolve the Dextrose, Dried Malt Extract, Dried Corn Syrup,
Lactose [proportions vary according to what style of beer I'm making] in 4
litres of either tap water or rainwater [again, depends what I'm making]
heated up in an aluminium jam making pot [I know! I know!! - I'm risking
the introduction of coriander flavours, but it's all I've got].
When all the goodies are dissolved I open the can of extract and pour it
in, sluicing around some more hot water in the can to get the last of it.
Now here's where the experts divide. Some say to bring this mixture to the
boil and continue boiling for a time before pouring into a fermenter,
topping up with cold water and pitching etc. etc.
Other experts say not to boil but simply pour the warm wort into the
fermenter and carry on as above.
Does anyone have any thoughts on whether to boil the wort or not, and if
so, for how long? Since the extract that I use has, I guess, already been
through all those arcane mashing and steeping procedures that I read about
in HBD, I wouldn't imagine that boiling would do anything useful, but I'd
be grateful for any feedback.
____________________
BTW I've only been reading HBD since March and I don't know if anyone has
told the wonderful story of the alcoholic lemonade called Two Dogs which is
brewed right here in Adelaide. If not, I'd be glad to share it and also
report on my attempt to make it myself.

Subject: irish moss


Hello.
Matt Melton reckons Irish Moss and gelatin are useless. Fair enough;
I must admit I often wonder whether the ritual irish moss sprinkle actually
achieves anything worthwhile. Sometimes I forget but still get clear beer.
I do find, however, that gelatin helps yeast to settle out faster. I guess
if you're keeping the beer cool in a secondary for 3 weeks that provides
ample time to drop the yeast out. I'm just not that patient!


I have a story about irish moss some might find interesting.


A friend of mine is doing a brewing course. Recently they did their first
trial batch. They did not use irish moss but a product called Copper
Clear, which he described as tablets (or granules) of processed 
irish moss. First they made up a solution by scraping the tablets and
disolving in a jug of water.
After boiling the (unmossed) wort, they took 12 wort samples
in measuring cylinders. They then mixed varying amounts of the
Copper Clear solution to each. The samples were allowed to cool
naturally to room temperature.
The next day they checked the cylinders of wort for clarity. They 
discovered that some were as clear as anything, and others were
cloudy. There was an optimum concentration of this stuff that produced
clear wort - either too much or too little resulted in cloudy wort.
(the control, with nothing added, was cloudy too).


Now this says nothing really about chill haze, but the stuff certainly
did something most would regard as beneficial. I believe I get
clearer beers by minimising crud transfer at each stage of the
brewing process. 


The trouble with the irish moss question, is that everyone has
their own opinion  based on subjective criteria. How can
you really be sure it works unless you do some sort of scientific
test? Do you grind it up? Do you rehydrate? When do you add it to 
the boil? I don't think many of us would be keen to do the
work necessary to really answer these questions.


I for one will get hold of Copper Clear. In the meantime I'll
continue to use irish moss and cross my fingers. After all,
it can't hurt, can it?

This seems contradictory.  It doesnt matter, but all the beer is
dispensed using N2/CO2 premix?  Of course it matters.  Take a can
of Guinness draught and pour it.  No sparkler in the can, very creamy
taste.  This is a direct consequence of the low soluability of N2.  Also 
note that CO2 will lend a more acidic taste to the beer.  Having just
returned from a beer hunt that included Britain, it is a huge factor,
the entire N2/CO2 mix and the dispense methods and the saturation of
the beer.  Of note in Britain is also that brewing methods differ 
between the southern flater bitters dispensed with no sparkler and
the northern creamy bitters served with swan neck and sparkler.

It does occur.  It is in a continuum between the top and bottom, as the
bed gets deeper, a higher propartion of the bed is composed of husks.
Dig a vertical shaft in the the lauter tun after lautering and this can
be observed.  It is a greater phenomenon in a looser grain bed, where the
husks can be forced down easier.

While Im not a IM user, many will disagree with this statement.  IM is a
very effective kettle coagulant, it is an issue of overall brewing systems
whether it is a useful adjunct.  By overall, I mean grain choice, mashing
choices, ale vs lagers, isinglass vs nothing, etc.

kegster`at`genie.geis.com wrote about High Gravity All Grain Mashing: 
 :  What is it that prompts brewers to use only the first runings of a mash to

The desire to not have to boil forever, of course!


If I take just the first runnings from a 1.5:1 (qts/lb) mash, I get a
gravity going *in* to the boil of about 1.090, and a gravity coming
out of over 1.100 (1.122 is my "record", so far).  If I were to try to
do the same with a standard sparge, I'd have to boil from maybe 10
gallons down to 5.


So I make a big beer with the first runnings, and a smaller beer with
the second.  My most recent brew produced 3 gallons of 1.100
barleywine, and 5 gallons of 1.045 special bitter.  The whole process
took about 6 hours (an extra benefit -- two beers for slightly more
than the time cost of one).

I made this recently.  It came out very nicely.  It's a nice recipe
because you can make 10 gallons on the stove top.


My Mild 
(after Darryl Richman's Mild from the Cat's Meow)
for 10 gallons


6 lbs Belgian (DWC) Pale Malt
5 lbs Belgian (DWC) Aromatic Malt
1 lb English (M&F?) 50L crystal
1 lb light brown sugar
0.25 lb Malted wheat
(0.25 lb Flaked Barley -- oops forgot to add it!)
0.1 lb Chocolate malt


Mash-in at 50C for a 15 minute protein rest (1.5 gallons water `at` 66C)
Raise to 68C with 1.75 gallons of boiling water, hold for 60 mins.
Mash-out by bringing 1 gallon of liquid to a boil and returning to
        mash (70C, not high enough).
Sparge with 6 gallons of water at 80C.  (Collected about 7 gallons)


Boil:
1 ounce Northern Brewer pellets `at` 9% (60 min)
0.5 oz Fuggles plug `at` 4.3% (30 min)
0.5 oz Fuggles plug at end of boil


CF chilled to 20C for pitching.


Mix with 5 gallons of pre-boiled, cooled & aerated water.


The yeast was one of:
        * YeastLab A03, several generations repitched, or
        * Cultured from the bottom of a Coopers Stout bottle


Unfortunately, my notes & my memory disagree on which yeast I ended up
using (don't ask :-).


Fermented in an open bucket for 2 days, then "dropped" (racked) into
carboys.  For one, I siphoned with normal care to avoid aeration.  For
the other, I deliberately let the beer fall from the neck of the
carboy to the bottom to get some aeration.  The second batch (with
aeration) had a "rounder", more pleasant (IMHO) flavor, with a nice
hint of butterscotch (diacetyl).


OG 1.034, FG 1.010.

Here's my $0.02 (mmmm! copper...). It's been a while since I read this part
of _The Practical Brewer_. Those guys at the Master Brewers Association of the
Americas really have examined a cross section of a grain bed. As I recall, the 
husks are actually at the top of the lauter tun after everything settles out. 
All the other gunk is more dense than the husks and sinks faster. This implies 
that a certain amount of recirculation is required in order to let the husks 
do their filter thing on the small particles that make it through the false 
bottom or manifold.


I hope I remembered correctly; if not I'm sure I'll hear about it.

Subject: Securing CO2 upright/lagering in regular 'fridge


Hi,


I have a new corny keg setup!  Now I'm debating wether to put the CO2
can in the fridge or drill a CO2 line hole in the side of the fridge 
and mount the CO2 can in a cabinet.  I want to do the latter I guess, 
but I don't have any type of grommet for the fridge wall.  (I need 
something secure because I have a 4 year old son.)  I'm not sure if
I can securely fasten the CO2 can upright inside the fridge.  A
small screw in the plastic inside the fridge probably wouldn't
hold it that well.  I am planning to purchase a 10 lb cylinder today
to complete the setup.  Any suggestions?  TIA.


Also, I have been wondering lately why so many people seem to need
the Hunter airstats ect... for lagering.  My normal "brew fridge" in
the garage works great for lagers.  I can control the temp from about 
33 to 49 F. and it stays quite constant.  Especially in the fermenter.
There is some change in the ambient air temp inside, but the temp of
the carboy stays completely constant.  No worries.  If you have not
lagered because you don't have one of these temp control devices, I'd
certainly encourage you to try it if you have a spare 'fridge.  (Of
course, I do understand you need a controler for a freezer!)


Looking forward to my first draft homebrew,

Well, I thought this was addressed fully several months ago, but what the hey.


You don't need to boil or otherwise gelatinize unmalted wheat for a Belgian 
Wit.  Just mash with the typical Wit temperature schedule.


I crushed uncracked wheat for my first Wit and then bought cracked wheat for 
the next one.  I didn't notice any difference attributable to the wheat, but 
it was certainly a lot easier on my mill and arm <grin>.  And the packages at 
the organic food store didn't have a date on them.

Pennies have been 97.6% zinc, 2.4% copper since December 17, 1981.  The 
copper is used as a coating on the surface of the coins.  Before that 
they were made from an alloy which was 95% Copper/5% Zinc.  (Dave 
Miller's Column in BT, Sept/Oct 1993.  He got his info from the US Mint 
in Philly).


Miller suggests using older pennies or pieces of copper tubing if you 
want to add copper to your wort.  The latter is what I have used as boiling 
stones on occaision.  Miller also mentions that it is unlikely for an 
all-malt wort to be deficient in trace minerals such as copper or zinc.
