     Styles & Creativity(part II), by Sam Piper-------
     Continued from previous HBD
     -------------------------------------------------------------
     How did the "standard come to be in the first place?  I would argue 
     that the basis of any beverage-of any food, for that matter, is the 
     attempt to make something good with the ingredients at hand.  It's that 
     simple.  And When you can make something really good, and keep the 
     price down, you've got a product.  And when that product begins to be 
     copied, you've got a "standard".  It's flattering to the first maker, 
     but not to the second!
     
     Can you imagine a master chef in any restaurant in the world who wants 
     his Veal Florentine to be exactly like James Beard's ... or anyone 
     else's?  Hell no.  It had better be different, it had better be 
     excellent, and any gourmet should be prepared to appreciate both 
     dimensions of the dish!
     
     The problem with judging and standards is what I call the American way 
     of success death.  Because rooted in a standard is the expectation of 
     replication, o loss of individuality, of mass production for mass 
     consumption by the masses of consumers.  It's great for commodities, 
     car parts and anything to do with manufacturing or repair.  But in the 
     world of arts and appreciation, a standard has to define a level of 
     quality, not limiting characteristics.
     
     And where in all this is the role of education?  Where is the 
     responsibility to teach a beer maker to joyfully make his or her own 
     unique beer?  or even more important, where is the responsibility to 
     teach the beer consumer to look for taste, to look for what is pleasing 
     and gratifying, and to define those terms by experience of tasting the 
     beer at hand and not by how closely that beer tastes like another?  
     
     I am just sick of contest judges who fault stout beers for not tasting 
     exactly like Guiness.
     
     The more we succumb to beer style standards, the less room there is 
     for the individual, be that person a consumer, a brewer, or a business 
     man.  But there's still hope for the mass product junkie.  I hear 
     McDonald's will put in little syrup breweries so we can all have fresh 
     McBeer to go with the McBurger du Jour.  For a quality dining 
     experience!

Subject: RE: recirculation, Irish moss




Hi All,


In HBD#1736, Lance Stronk asks:


>What difference does it make whether it takes 1 quart to
>get clear runoff or 5 gallons to get clear runoff?


  During recirculation, the typical homebrewer collects wort in a saucepan or
some such, and adds it back to the top of the lauter tun.  There is some
splashing of the wort inherent in this process, which causes both heat
loss and HSA. The less recirculation required to achieve acceptable
clarity of the runoff, the less severe the heat loss, and the less likely
to incur HSA problems.
  I think you're looking at this from the perspective of a RIMS user,
someone who typically recirculates wort via a pump through a closed, 
insulated plumbing system. From this perspective, additional recirculation
is not a big deal, the insulated plumbing minimizes the heat loss, and
if the RIMS system is designed correctly, it should not splash the wort
around.

This is totally contrary to my experience with both Irish moss and gelatin.
Could you post some of the details of your procedures? How do you prepare
them, and at what point during your process do you add them???

Subject: RE: PICO Brewing System




The following note describes our experiences with the pico
system.  Usual disclaimers apply:  We have no financial
interest in pico system.  I am responding to private e-mail,
but thought the post would be of interest to hbd.


I went in on a full pico system with Steve Hamburg.  We have
had the system for about 1.5 years.  You can brew with the
pico system by yourself, but it's nice to have another brewer
around as well as split the cost between two or more people.
We bought the system to be able to brew half-barrel batches.
Typically, we split the hopped wort into 3 carboys and pitch
with different yeasts.  You can also do parti-gyle brewing
wherein you get a 1st runnings strong beer and one or two
weaker beers.


The full system cost us around $1100.  With the full system,
you get three interchangeable kegs:


Keg #1 -- Hot water tank
Keg #2 -- Mash/lauter tun
Keg #3 -- Boil Kettle


All kegs have a ball-valve spigot (I think that's what it's
called) and thermometer wells.  For Kegs #2 and #3, you
should purchase false bottoms.  In keg #2, the false bottom
becomes the ground for the grain bed, and in keg #3 it serves
as a screen for the hops.


We also bought the electric pumps.  There has been some
traffic on HBD about these, and our experience has been
similar.  Namely, these pumps are just adequate to getting the
job done.  We find that if you "start the siphon" by keeping an
empty pot nearby, once you establish flow in the pump it will
then lift the liquid to the top of the keg.  In the absence of
pumps, you would need some sort of tower system to use
gravity to transfer between kettles, and how would you
circulate within a kettle?  We have seen some extraordinary
homebrew setups that make use of pumps found at American
Science Surplus, so that remains an alternative.


We employ pumping in the following ways:


Keg #1 to Keg #2 -- UNDERLET hot water from the hot water
tank to the mash/lauter tank.
Keg #2 -- RECIRCULATE mash liquor at mash out.
Keg #1 to Keg #2 -- SPARGE by sprinkling water over the
grain.
Keg #2 to Keg #3 -- TRANSFER sweet wort to boil kettle.
Keg #3 -- RECIRCULATE hopped wort while chilling.  This
turned out to be an unanticipated boon to our brewing.  You
can make multiple hop additions, including late additions.  At
end of boil, recirculate the hopped wort while chilling.  The
hops form a hop back and filter some of the break from the
wort.
Keg #3 -- RACK the beer to carboys.  This is easy.  You get
nice, aerated hopped wort.


Other things you get with the system include tubing and
connections for propane tanks, 3 burners, hoses,
thermometers, clips, stir paddle, and immersion wort chiller.
Steve and I had both been using "cajun cooker" type burners in
our own setups, and much prefer them to stovetop brewing, so
we didn't think long before deciding to get 3 with this system.


There is more prep work before brewing as well as cleanup
after brewing, but the brewing itself takes about the same time
as a 5-gallon batch.  We have made very good beers with the
system as well as learned a lot about yeast flavor profiles.  The
extract efficiency is about 85-6%, which is higher than on my
5-gallon homebrew system.  We can calculate recipes out and
pretty much hit target gravity.


Drawbacks are:


 - Again, pumps are barely adequate.  However, what is your
best alternative to them?


 - Micromanaging the mash temperature takes some learning.
You are much better off calculating your strike water
temperature so that upon underletting you attain your desired
temperature.  If the temperature at which the mash settles is
too low, the mash seems to resist rapid temperature boosting
via the mash kettle burner.  You're probably better off striking
the mash with more hot water to attain the temperature boost.


On balance, the pluses outweigh the minuses.  The kettle
modifications are reasonably well designed and well executed.
If you set out to have a welder modify your kegs for you, you
have the problem that most welders are not brewers and vice
versa.  I've seen some poorly designed and executed kettle
modifications as a result.  It was convenient for us that the pico
guys figured out a workable system.

Subject:  grain bed as filter


Kirk Fleming asks about particle distribution in a grain bed after sparging
is finished.


I haven't sectioned my grainbed, though I have let may bucket lauter tun sit
outside overnight in winter so it freezes and the grain comes out as one big
plug.
I had never stopped to examine it closely but the stuff on the bottom of the
grain bed appeared coarser. 
I have noticed a fine particle buildup on the top after recirc.
It seems to vary with recipe and assortment of grains in the mash and is
there after the bed is drained.


In my experience, it seems that the grain bed does indeed act as a filter.

Rick Gontarek asked:


I will be at Cold Spring Harbor for 5 days starting on the 23rd, and would
be interested in hearing of any cool places to visit while I'm out there.
I hear there's a new brewpub out there...anybody have any details?


The brewpub is called the Long Island Brewing Company.  It is located on
Jericho Tpke. (Rte 25) in Syosset (not far from Cold Spring Harbor).  The
beer was pretty good, the prices were reasonable, and we really enjoyed the
atmosphere.  But be warned, weekend nights it is jam-packed.  There are a
few beer bars that I hear advertised as well (Croxley's Ale House, e.g.) but
I have not been yet.  Enjoy!!

       Mark Peacock asked about rubber gaskets: Neoprene has a service temp
of up to 250=B0F. Sounds OK for a boil. Hypalon, a more modern synthetic
rubber, is good to 350=B0F. This came from my neighbor's materials textbook,
so it's probably a slight bit more credible than hearsay.

        On Keg cleaning: Generally, the reason why stainless tends to rust
after wire wheeling it is because you didn't use a stainless wire brush.
This leaves some non-stainless material imbedded in the surface, acting as
a source of future rusting. A stainless wire wheel should be OK, but I
have had some decent luck with ZUD cleanser. Try that first.

Subject: New Bottle Washer


Just received my new Fermenthaus washer in the mail yesterday, and it appears to
be just what I've been wanting.  I had to run out to the garage and test it out
on a few empties.  Works great!  This is the kind where the operating valve is
near the faucet end, before the pressure is increased by the small diameter tube
(Lots of pictures in Zymurgy).


Benefits:  1) NO pipe hammer.  None.  Now I can brew into the wee hours without
waking up the SO on the opposite side of the house.  :-)
2) The operating level completely surrounds the washer tube.  No chance of
getting the damn thing stuck inside the carboy (Like I seem to do at least twice
per wash these days).
3) Since the outlet tube is completely open, it should work very well for
rinsing siphon hoses.


Down side?  Costs about $20. 


 For the record, no connection, no personal profit motivation, just a satisfied
 ..., blah, blah, blah -- Randy

On my last Strong Ale, which started around 1.088 I had a similar 
problem.  I was using Wyeast 1098, and hadn't had the time before 
brewing to make a really good size starter - so when it sort of 
petered out, I just  made another starter, treating it like a 
1.040-ish beer and tossed it in.  Fermentation wasn't as vigorous the 
second time around, but it worked out fine and brought it down to 
around 1.020 (which was were I expected).  As always YMMV, but I just 
figured my yeasties got a bit worn and over worked and needed 
replacements.

Subject: Grain Bed, part II


Hi -
  I'm home now with the _The Practical Brewer_ in front of me. Here's what the
Master Brewers Association of the Americas has to say on grain beds:


         A properly established filter bed should consist of a thin 
      layer of dough-like fines immediately on the plates with a 
      thick layer of endosperm particles of gradually increasing size
      becoming a layer of larger endosperm particles with husk particles 
      adhering, and finally a top layer of large husk particles. In an 
      undisturbed mash, the husk layer will be covered with a thin 
      layer of gelatinous material and above that the clearing wort 
      with a few floating acrospires. There would also be some 
      "underdough" beneath the false bottom. One of the objectives of 
      wort circulation and initial operations of the lautering machine 
      is to pull the underdough from beneath the plates and transport 
      it to the top of the grain bed and redistribute it down through 
      the classifying particles. During this and subsequent lautering 
      processes, it is important that the lautering knives be operated 
      in a manner that the dough layer immediately above the plates is
      not disturbed. The knives should, however, be kept operating at 
      or just below the interface between the wort and the grain bed to 
      keep the gelatinous layer from sealing the bed.


                                page 90 of _The Practical Brewer_
                                Copyright 1977 
                                The Master Brewers Association of the Americas


So with the caveat (sp?) of "an undisturbed mash", the husks are actually the
top layer of the grain bed during the sparge. I quoted the whole paragraph
because I thought it was a sinister way to re-introduce the "knife the grain
bed during the sparge" thread ;^) It also brought up what could be a reason
for some stuck sparges: to little agitation of the top of the bed during
water additions lets the gelatinous ( = protein (can you say wheat?)) layer
seal the bed and no water flows. Craig's stuck sparge advice of the day:
if you have a stuck sparge, as a first attempt at fixing it, give the top
couple of inches of the grain bed a quick stir with a spoon or knife. It 
might work.

to Dan Pack, R. James Ray and  Frank Caico,
Re wheat malt and beers beers 


- -- Beers made with a combination of wheat malt and pale barley malt re often 
perceived as being lighter in body than an all pale malt beer made with the 
same yeast.  A certain 'tartness' is also often perceived.  This is based on 
my experience making a wheat beer in a large micro and hearing peoples' 
reactions.  The beer was filtered and this can reduce the perceived body.  A 
'regular' ale yeast was used; i.e. not a lactic or phenolic producer.  The 
morale is that biochemistry does not dictate perception absolutely.
- -- Wheat in any form is a foam-builder for a given set of 'downstream' 
process conditions.
- -- There is a discussion of wheat malt in Eric Warners book "Wheat beer".




Ken Willing was asking about perceived mouthfeel.  While the 'protein 
factor' is key, there are other considerations.   The buttery-ness of 
diacetyl increases the perceived body.  Any acidity would tend to decrease 
the perception of body.  Anyone care to add to this list of complicating 
factors?


Kirk Flemming asked about filterbeds and recirculation.  I don't think, " 
the husks fall to the bottom of the grain bed", but the initial cloudy wort 
results from the smaller particles travelling around the husk and any other 
large particles at the bottom of the mash and then through the screen.   If 
you did turn out your grainbed upside down and looked at the bottom, I think 
you'll see mostly husks, but the so-called filterbed is not very deep.  In 
contrast,  I'm sure most grain brewers have seen the grey pasty stuff that 
forms on the top of sparged grains and that definitely wouldn't stay on the 
bottom (though there may be fines under the screen.)


Mark A. Melton  wrote, "It is a waste of time to use Irish moss, and worse 
than nothing to use gelatin."  Mr. Melton's experiences are not widely 
shared.   There are effective methods of using these materials.   Note Tim 
Laatsch's praise of gelatin and IM in the same digest.  See HBD 1737 for Tim 
Field's summary concerning Irish Moss.  In contrast to Mr. Melton's 
practice, it would be more common to use gelatin at least half a day before 
bottling in order to leave behind the gelatin and the material it helps to 
precipitate.

 I just got a 5 gal. SS keg that is a hazardous 
material container from Europe.  I want to put beer
in it of course, and am wondering how much pressure
it must handle.  The seems are TIG welded apparently 
and look very strong.  The wall of the cotainer seems
kind of thin, but I do not care if it bulges
 Is it more predictable to "artificially"  
cabonate the beer, or should I prime with sugar, 
like I do in bottles.  I have the specs. on this
container, and am basically trying to avoid an
exploding beer bomb in my aging closet.
 I also have to tap this sucker some how.  I realy want
to hook it up to a CO2 system, to propel my beer
into my mug, or mouth depending on the situation. 
It has a 2" standard threaded hole in the top, and I 
have a SS, and plastic (HDPE) bung for the container.
Are there any kegging experts that want to answer my
trivial questions.  Any and all info. will be much 
appreciated, private e-mail OK

Howdy, Tom;
        I'm not sure if this will help or not, but here goes a stab:


In front of me on my desk is a tasting tray mat from Full Sail Brewing
which lists malts and hops for several of their ales.  Unfortunately,
their excellent IPA isn't listed, but the Golden and Amber are.  Perhaps
what those hops are will help you come up with an idea, okay?  Here's
what it says:


"Full Sail Golden Ale  A medium-bodied, 12-degree Plato ale brewed with
two-row Pale, Crystal, and Dextrin barley malts.  This beer is
well-hopped with Mt. Hood and Tettnanger hops from the Pacific
Northwest.  A crisp, aromatic beer with a well balanced, mild sweetness
which finishes dry and refreshing.   Excellent with hot and spicy
cuisine.  ABW: 3.5%"


"Full Sail Amber Ale  A rich, full-bodied 14.5-degree Plato ale brewed
with two-row Pale, Crystal and Chocolate barley malts, producing a
delicate butterscotch profile.  This beer is well hopped with Cascade
and Mt. Hood hops to finely balance the malty sweetness; finishes with
the tang of spicy floral hops.  ABW: 4.8%"


It goes on to say that their Main Sail Stout is hopped with Willamettes.


Hope this helps--->

Subject: Pitching Rates




In HBD #1735/7 Pitching rates for yeast was being discussed.  


I recently had the pleasure of assisting with a batch of Ale that was brewed 
at the "Covany Brewing Company"  Although I have no formal affiliation with 
the place other than as a customer I do have a great deal of respect for Bill 
Kimbrel, the brewer.  Anyway, Bill pitches 5 gallons of thick slurry for a 15 
bbl batch.  Bill usually sluices the yeast from the bottom of his conical 
fermenter using a sterile hose.  Now this isn't just cloudy beer it's a yeast 
slurry similar to what you see sitting at the bottom of your secondary 
fermenter when the yeast drops (he also dumps any nasty looking trub before 
transfering the yeast).  I had saved the yeast slurry from the secondary of 
my last Flemish ale in a mason jar and was interested in re-pitching it in my 
Old Brun Vrucht (sp?) so I did a little math to figure out how many ounces of 
yeast concentrate to pitch.  My figures came out to 6.8 oz of yeast!!  I was 
flabbergasted because before, when I had made starters, I pitched the culture 
into 2 cups of wort and was lucky to end up with 1-2 oz ofreal yeast in the 
bottom of the 22 oz starter bottle.  Anyway, I looked at my mason jar and 
judged it to have about 6 oz of yeast of yeast on the bottom so I swirled the 
bottle gently to get the yeast back into solution and pitched the whole works 
(this was about 6pm). 


The result was astonishing, By the next morning I was in high krausen with a 
very active ferment.  By the second day the krausen had started to drop.  I 
racked to the secondary the third day (a day earlier than normal) because the 
yeast was beginning to drop and added the cherries (ran 'em through a blender 
first). Two more days of fermentation after the cherry addition and my yeast 
dropped. I haven't bottled yet or pulled a FG but everything looks normal.  
BTW The yeast was at refrigerator temperatures when I pitched it (Yeah, I 
spaced that one) but it didn't seem to hurt it.  Either I was lucky or the 
Trapist ale yeast is tougher than I thought. 


Incidentally Bill swears by American Ale Yeast and claims that it ferments 
out more quickly than other yeast but after adjusting my pitching amounts I'm 
beginning to think that the amount of yeast pitched is a bigger factor in the 
speed of fermentation than the type of yeast pitched.


Bill also says he was on the 14th generation of yeast in that particular 
batch.  This also flies in the face of the conventional wisdom of only 
repitching yeast 3 generations.  I believe that if one has the capability of 
keeping things sterile he/she can get many more generations from a single 
starter.  I often hear it claimed that there is a possibility of the yeast 
mutating but I find it hard to believe that yeast is any more likely to 
mutate in a carboy than in a petri dish. I do, however, agree it *is* less 
likely to get *contaminated* in a laboratory than in your kitchen. A yeast 
lab (generic sense) is also capable of analyzing the yeast to ensure the 
strain is correct and not contaminated.  Am I way off base here?

To which I respond;  AM I GOING CRAZY OR WHAT??????
The husks *fall* or are *forced down* to the bottom of the grain bed?  How?  Is
this some kind of phenomenon that I have never seen before?  I have to agree
with Craig on this one guys.
When I mash, I recirculate and heat using a RIMS.  After mashing and sparging,
what I see on the TOP of the grain bed is a layer of stuff that is fine
(looks like flour).  I was told by an local microbrewery apprentice brewer (a
master brewers slave ;^) ) that this is exactly what is supposed to happen,
i.e. the smaller particles get trapped at the top of the grain bed by the filter
action of the grain bed.  And if the small particles get trapped at the top of 
the grain bed (as I have witnessed on every batch) then how can a husk go to 
the bottom of the grain bed if it is physically larger than a particle of malt
flour??
 
>I hope I remembered correctly; if not I'm sure I'll hear about it.


Brew a batch of all-grain Craig, have a homebrew, and look in the top of your
lautertun - You'll remember.

Seems how the electric stove thread is still going on I figured I'd 
chime in with a data point I've found usefull. I've been mashing & 
boiling on my E-stove 4 years now, and have replaced the burner once.
I normaly use a 10 gal SS, it only covers one coil. The burner is 
rated at 2200 W and my general rule of thumb is to expect a heat 
rise of 10 Deg F per gal per min. 


So for example if my sparge outlet is at 150 F, 7 gal total, and I want
a boil, I should expect about 42 min  [(210-150)/10 * 7.] This estimate
is most usefull during mash temp steps, and to know how soon the
infusion & sparge water needs to get on the stove. The rise rate needs
a minute or two to get going, and falls off somewhat near a boil, but
is rather repeatable for me at normal mashing temps.


I do have a propane burner for larger batches, but moving stuff up/down
the stairs from the basement to front porch is a drag, and not possible
in January here in Cleveland! I know propane is bad indoors, but is a
burner converted to natural gas OK ? I do have a kitchen style exhaust
hood over the basement stove (200 CFM out the dryer vent) How do
all you RIMS / larger batch folks do your boils if indoors. How do you
vent the combustion fumes? should I get a Canary? (my cats would LOVE

with oxalic acid.  It's recommended for cleaning stainless and copper and the 
stuff works GREAT!  It takes off lime deposits, beerstone, and copper 
oxidation, and handles just about any other tough metal cleaning job without 
being too harsh (IMHO).  I heartily recommend it and thank my mother-in-law 
for clueing me in.  As always, no affiliation, blah, blah, blah.  I bought it 
at the local supermarket.  Buy it---and enjoy!

Correct me if I'm wrong (like you wouldn't anyway ;-)) but it has

gelatin is used mostly in kegs to help the yeast settle out; and haze

  One more clarification on the mercury thread...


Mercury is extremely poisonous in any salt form or organic forms.  It can also
be toxic in its elemental form when it is aerosolized (even in minute amounts
over long periods of time).


However, in the elemental form (i.e. the mercury that you find in thermometers)
mercury is not very toxic.  In fact, there are reports of persons attempting
suicide by swallowing the mercury in a few thermometers and having no obvious
toxicity.  Still, caution is needed when handling elemental mercury since the
presence of trace contaminants may be a possibility.  Remember, some organic
mercury compounds can be absorbed through the skin.


Toxicologically yours,

Chris Kagy asks:

>extracted during sparging?  I'm ready and willing to be educated... <g>


I can answer this one from personal experience.  If you are making a high
gravity beer, you need a high gravity wort.  There are three ways to get
this high gravity wort.


The first method is to collect first runnings, or perhaps "early runnings".
You collect only high gravity wort, boil it, hop it, ferment it, and you
have a big beer.  You throw away the lower gravity runnings, or make a small
beer from them.  The double session takes almost double the time for me, so
unless you have parallel kettles, chillers, etc., this is an added
consideration.


The second method is the standard method of making beer.  Collect all of the
runnings, and then boil the volume down until it is at the proper gravity.  I
did this once and got a nice barley wine from it.  The boil only took 8 hours
to go from 13 gallons down to 6.  This leads me to the third method, and the
one I would take the next time.


The third method is a partial mash, adding a considerable amount of malt
extract.  The reason for doing this is to get the gravity up without having
to boil your wort all weekend.  Calculate the points you'd get from the mash
planning on a volume about 20% over your fermentation volume.  Add to it
enough extract to get this wort up to your goal gravity, and add this amount.
Boil, hop, ferment, and you have your high gravity beer without an abnormal
investment of time and/or money.


Cheers,
Norm

Good point, and one that brings me to a subject I thought I'd ask the HBD:
What do we (collectively) know about the available extracts.  There sure are
a lot of them, and I've often wondered what the difference between the various
brands and types is.  In many cases, all the manufactuer tells us is "light",
"amber" or "dark", but clearly all light extracts aren't created equal.  Is
there an extract FAQ, or even just a list of the commonly-available types
and their approximate compositions?


It would be nice to have a little more knowledge about what to expect when
selecting extracts; rather than trying to figure it out through hindsight
and guesswork.

Thanks, Al - perhaps some of us (myself included, I suppose) needed to
hear that.  I'm an extract-plus-specialty-grain brewer of relatively
short experience; and yes, I have been known to preface my posts with
disclaimers to that effect.  


However, one of the things that rubbed me the wrong way about
the post to which I repied originally was that the poster didn't even
consider extract brewers - despite that the thread to which he was
ostensibly contributing was about a stuck fermentation in extract-only
batches!

I find that most of the actual fruit essence comes from aroma, not

want some residual sweetness in your wheat beer, however.

I used Wyeast 2565 (Koelsh) yeast in my last two fruit beers.  I made a   
raspberry from two cans of wheat extract plus 4 oz. of raspberry 
concentrate at bottling.  When I racked it off, I siphoned the makings of 
a banana beer in on top.  The raspberry is light and clean now that the 
tannins I added have mellowed out.  The verdict is still out on the 
banana.  The guys in our brew club seemed to like it more because it's 
something different, out of the ordinary.  It also has a clean finish in

        I broke my thermometer while mashing and got Mercury poisoning. I
blew off my right arm (lucky I'm lefty) with an exploding Mini-keg. I'm
half brain dead from propane burner-induced CO poisoning. The remaining
half of my brain has gone schizo from lead poisoning because I decant my
brew from crystal vessels. I've been refused life insurance because
homebrewing is listed as a "dangerous" hobby. I'm applying for veteran's
benefits.


        Enough of that, my real question is: Is my beer ruined?........

Subject: Burnt-out electric burners


Dave Hensley related his experience brewing on a an electric stove with a
big pot over two burners.  He has had to replace a number of burners at
$30/ each.


I thought I would mention that there are "canning elements" available for
some electric stoves.  LAst spring I was calling around and found one for
the Roper range in my apartment for $79.


It is somewhat higher wattage and it sits further above the stovetop to
avoid heat build-up.  I think it also comes with a new rheostat.


I haven't bought one, but I am still considering one to go with the new pot
I am planning on getting.  I would rather get a propane burner if I am
going to spend that kind of money, but it isn't practical in my apartment.


My biggest concern is that it give me MORE POWER.  If I remember right, it
is 2600 wats, but I have no idea what the average large electric burner
puts out.


Anyone.
