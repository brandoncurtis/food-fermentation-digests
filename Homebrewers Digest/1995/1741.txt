   This has been a topic of considerable debate for a number of years. A

AB: Next to nutrition, amalgam fillings represent the main source for
exposure of the general population to mercury. Toxicological considerations
focus on the dose of mercury resulting from such exposure. Various
approaches to estimate this dose are reviewed. Introducing the dose into the
known toxicokinetic model for mercury, tissue and blood and urine
concentrations related to mercury release from the fillings can be
predicted. These agree well with autopsy and in vivo observations. An
assessment of the health hazard for individuals with amalgam fillings shows
that the combined mercury intake from food and amalgam does not exceed the
acceptable daily intake. In addition, blood and urine mercury concentrations
of amalgam bearers are below one tenth of the critical values associated
with the onset of early symptoms or of subclinical effects attributable to
mercury.

   With what results???  Do the insane suddenly become sane upon removal

No, "corn sugar" is dextrose, not sucrose.  Just like in Oz, our sucrose
is derived from cane *or* like the Europeans, from beets.  Sugar beets
are a big crop in California.

The scientific work has already been done, and was actually circulated
on the net a year or so ago.  George Fix did the research, and
determined optimal amounts for Irish Moss.  The reason most people "have
their own opinion" has been that *all* the homebrewing texts called for
amounts of Irish Moss too insignificant to make a contribution.


George's research determined that the flakes were actually superior to
the powder, and that the correct amount is roughly 1-1/2 tsp. in 5
gallons.  Although the paper didn't include the process of rehydration,
George's recommendation is to do so.


My own anecdotal evidence in favor of Irish Moss is overwhelming -- I
wouldn't make a beer without it.

Subject: Bad News Bungs on Minikeg




I just bought my first FULL Minikeg of a German beer named Warsteiner 
motivated out of curiosity and an expectation of reusing the can. 


This isn't about the beer or the Minikeg. It's about the Bung which was 
a bugger to get out. It's made of rubber molded around nylon with 8 
exposed lands that spring out and lock after clearing the rim. Clearly 
tamper resistant and not intended for reuse.


I got it by tearing off the top brim, pushing it in and pulling it out 
sideways but the rim of the can was somewhat deformed in the process.


Is this typical of full Minikegs and does anyone any decent techniques 
for removal. Or should I just slice off the rubber brim, push it in and 
stop worrying?

I find that most of the actual fruit essence comes from aroma, not
flavor so you don't want the yeast's characteristics to compete.  You do
want some residual sweetness in your wheat beer, however.




I think the kind of yeast chosen should emulate the type of beer you are 
trying to brew.  If you are making a specific type of beer (a porter say) 
with a fruit component, then use the yeast for that style.  If you are 
trying to produce a lambic style (the original fruit beer) without all the 
hassle of special yeast strains, try a Belgian ale yeast.  If however, you 
are trying to emulate an American-style fruit beer (usually wheat based), 
try a neutral ale yeast (like WYeast American Ale), or for a hint of wheat 
beer taste, BrewTeks American White.

Subject: Trub Removal


After I started to use a wort cooler last year
I was faced with the problem of a large mass of
cold break material. It was a large volume of 
very powdery white material which did not settle
well at all. I wrestled with the concept of just
ignoring it as it was, after all, dissolved in
the wort prior to my using a cooling technique
and I couldn't tell if it affected the flavor or
not. Aesthetically, however, it was intolerable 
so I have tried to come up with a way to remove
it *without* losing a lot of wort. After many ex-
periments and much brainstorming I arrived at a
method which seems to work well, is simple, and 
is efficient. After I have cooled my wort I rack 
it to a carboy and allow it to settle overnight.
Then I carefully siphon off the top, clear layer
of wort into the fermenter. At that point I aerate
and pitch. I then arrange a special funnel arran-
gement which I constructed from one half of a 5
gallon plastic carboy, used for bottled water. I
then stuff some window screen in the neck of the 
carboy, for support, and lay a doubly folded, 
cheesecloth hopsbag over the screen. Pour in the
remaining wort, trub and all(including pellet hops
remains) and let it drip out overnight. All the
wort will filter out given time. I then re-boil
the filtered wort, cool it, and pour it into the
fermenter.
Although this is not really a simple process it
has the virtue of working well. If care is taken
with sanitation the delay in pitching is not
really a problem. You can prove this to yourself
by making a small fermenter from a gallon jug and
a lock and introducing some wort to it in the
normal way without pitching. I can do this without
experiencing any microflora growth for many weeks,
especially with high gravity worts where the os-
motic pressure *may* be enough to discourage some
organisms.

Nope, that's what we call "white sugar" or "cane sugar".  (I've read that
most "cane sugar" in the US actually comes from beets, but is still labelled
"cane".  Go figure.)


Corn sugar = dextrose, made from maize/corn.

We call it that, too.  And one other name, candy related, I think.

I don't have a corny kegging system, but I am curious as to how these gas 
mixes work.  Nitrogen in a gas tank remains a gas (at least I think it 
does) whereas carbon dioxide is a liquid/gas mix depending on temperature 
and pressure. How in the world is it predictable what the mix coming out 
will be?!?  It seems as long as there was enough carbon dioxide to have 
some as liquid the mixture percentages would depend only on temperature 
and total pressure.  Anyone care to straighten out my understanding of 
this? I know it works, because I love the creaminess as much as anyone 
else!

An issue or two ago Dave Peterson asked for a Sam Adams recipe.  Well,

Subject: Refrigerating wort




Dear fellow brewers,
I would like to preserve a five gallon volume of wort for
fermentation at a later date.


I have read about a technique in one of CP's books to
preserve a small volume of sterile wort in a capped,
refrigerated beer bottle.  The wort is later used to prime 
the beer for carbonating without adding sugar.  The wort 
can also be used to propagate yeast.  There is no mention 
of how long the wort will keep refrigerated.


I would like to use a food grade five gallon bucket (the type 
that is often used as a primary) to contain the wort.  There
will be an air-space of about three inches between the surface
of the wort and the lid.  The mash will be a full grain step-infusion.
I have had success in the past refrigerating ten gallons of wort in
a grief, but it was only for twenty four hours and the mash was 
made from concentrate.


Now a few questions:
Do you think the airspace in the bucket could be a problem for 
contamination?  Should I flush the air out with CO2?
Would I have to re-aerate the wort before fermentation or could
I just pitch the yeast when it reaches room temperature?
Would it be better to freeze it or would that deteriorate the wort?
What types of deterioration would the wort likely undergo if it 
was refrigerated for an extended period? (hop aroma, etc.)


Thanks in advance for any advice.

Alan asked about boiling kits.


I tried to send this reply to Allen's email address directly, but for some
reason my mail server couldn't fine his. After a couple of minor edits i'll
risk embarrassment and possibly even harassment and post the reply I tried
to send to him......




I'm an extract brewer too. Your sugar discussion was interesting, but I must 


admit that i've never used any type of sugar in my brews. Perhaps some dried 


malt extract once in a while, but never sugar. For sugar or rice beer, it's
easier to just go down to the liquor store. For the homebrew, the preferred
recipe would typically call for 6-7 lbs of canned malt extract, and about a
pound to 1.5 pounds of crystal or some other specialty grain. If you want to 


try to boosting the SG a bit, for fun, add 2 to 4 cups of dried malt. (4
cups and things are getting pretty heavy!! :)


I boil. Always. BUT, I also use a fairly large quantity of hops. Mostly
pellets for flavoring and bitterness and dry hopping some leaf for aroma. If 


you are using a pre-hopped kit and not adding any of your own hops defiantly 


DON'T boil it. Boiling the pre-hopped kit will reduce the aroma
significantly, and probably increase the bitterness and reduce flavor.
(gees, this is going on hbd.... should I be calling that wonderful aroma
'the-hop-nose'? At least I didn't call it smell :)


Just my opinion, but you are missing out if you stick to the pre-hopped
kits. Hops are relatively cheep, and developing a schedule for bittering,
flavor and aroma hopping is half the fun.


I have found that in order to get good performance from my hops a 60 to 90
min boil is required. Without a good full rolling boil, the full bitterness
does seem to be achieved. My last batch used about 5 or 6 oz of a variety of 


hop pellets distributed into the boiling wort from the 60 min mark up until
the last 2 mins. I put in about 1/4 oz at a time, and basically just keep
sprinkling them in for the whole hour. (By now some of the more refined
HBers are saying "my god, what an animal!", oh well, it's good for 'em :)


One other hint. If you start using hops, try not to let the SG get too high
during the boil. I found out the hard way that if you use at least one
gallon of water for each 3.3lbs of canned malt extract you'll get reasonable 


results from your hops. If the mix gets much 'thicker', the hops utilization 


goes down. My boil volume is typically 4 gallons or more.


Another note: If you are dumping hot wort directly into the fermentor you
may get some strange flavors or smells. (and they really are smells this
time!) Make a chiller of one type or another. A simple suggestion is to use
about 20 feet of 3/8 copper tubing bent around and around in a circle as an
immersion chiller. It works great. My setup can bring the wort from 200 degs 


F down to 75 or 80F in about 40 mins. THEN dump it through a BIG sanitized
strainer into the fermenter. 70% to 80% of the hop mess is filtered out, and 


the mix is ready for the yeast.


You might find that you'll start racking into a second stage of fermentation 


when you start using hops.... The hops and any trub from the specialty
grains you use will be left behind when you rack. Let the first stage go a
week or so, depending on temp, yeast activity and convenience. Then rack it
to the secondary. A glass carboy is a good choice for the secondary. I'd
stay away from prolonged storage in plastic.


Back into the woodwork with the rest of the extract brewers! Please, please
master(-brewers), don't beat me...

Subject: Some mercury details


Heavy Metals:


In response to the continuing mercury thread, and at risk of dropping
        my AI score even lower, let me first apologize for not checking
        the logic in a post I made several weeks ago about Hg's toxicity.
        And thanks to Domenick for succinctly noting there is an obvious         
        error in the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) for mercury.  I         
        apologize for not having checked this normally accurate (legally
        required) info before passing it on to the Collective of the HBD!          
        Shoot me now...
                        (missed!  I go on to detail...)


Mercury toxicity continues to be a topic on the digest.  ITS TOXIC!
        Believe this.  It is the truth.  However, it is NOT A POTENT TOXIN.


After my last post, I checked this Q more closely.  Mercury is toxic
        just as most transition metals are.  In fact, the toxicity data
        from the Merck Index, from a variety of MSDS sources (OHS Inc.,
        Cutin-Matheson Scientific, Aldrich), from the Handbook of Chemical
        Hazards, among others, describing such toxicity in detail reveals         
        that mercury's toxic symptoms closely resemble the toxicity of
        many metals, including lead, zinc, cadmium, aluminum, and tin.
        I'M NOT SAYING THESE ARE ALL EQUALLY TOXIC...


Some of these we avoid while others we don't.  Exposure guidelines given         
        for these metals (above sources) reflect what we intuitively know.
        Here are some elements and their TLV's and PEL's (*):


                _Metal_                _TLV_        _PEL_     (in mg per cubic meter)
                Aluminum        10.0        -----
                Iron                5.0        10.0
                Tin                2.0        -----                Note: metal dust

                Arsenic                0.20        0.010                cause for some of
                Lead                0.15        0.050                these toxicities,
                Mercury                0.05        0.100                versus ingestion!
                Cadmium                0.05        0.005 (!)


        (*- Threshold Limit Values are provided by the American Conference
         of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.
         Permissible Exposure Limits are established by OSHA.  All numbers
         are time-weighted average limits for a 40 hour work week.  The
         OSHA PEL's are enforceable by law.)


What the heck does this matter?  Yes indeed.  My thinking led me to         
        consider that if everyone agrees ("shields up Captn!") lead solder is
        NOT to be used to sweat copper joints in, say, one's lauter tun, how 
        much sense does it make to use an amalgamated kettle?  The answer lies
        in the physical properties of mercury as well as the type of exposure...


The physical properties of elemental mercury make it insoluble in all but
        strong acids (ie nitric) at room temperature.  When heated in weak acid
        (beer),it is simply unknown to what extent mercury may be extracted.  
        However, much less soluble yet are amalgams with iron, zinc, gold, 
        etc.  The issue is acute versus chronic exposure.  The tiny amounts
        leachable into a single batch of brew are certainly WELL below the 
        quantities OSHA/ACGIH say are "OK" for 40 hours/week (ie chronic) 
        exposure.  And I don't even drink 5 gallons of beer/week (do I?)!  
        And the quantities needed to qualify for acute exposure could only
        be met by drinking a large thermometer's worth of the stuff, so its 
        not an issue in this discussion.


Towards explaining the unknown, science teaches us to extrapolate from what's
        known.  In this case, my belief is that mercury in a kettle (or my 
        teeth) is tightly bound via an amalgam and will not appreciably leach 
        into the wort (or beer), even during the boil.  I wouldn't have said 
        this earlier, but I do now after reviewing the data.


Sorry if my earlier note scared you mercury users!  I will not use mercury
        in the lab or at home if I can help it.  Others have said the same.
        Avoid it and there's no problem :-)!  Now that the AI Police have
        come knocking on my EtherNet card, sorry for the BW.  Use this
        data to guide you into your PERSONAL comfort zone w/ mercury,
        lead, whatever.

Subject: plastic carboys


Mark Evans asked several days ago about using plastic carboys as primary
fermenters.  Except for Harry's brief omments on 16 May 1995, there doesnt
appear to have been an answer.  My father and I have been brewing beer in
plastic fermenters for around 30 years without any recent problem relating
to the plastic or the shape.  The fermenters are dustbin (garbage can?)
shaped.  My father uses open brewing techniques, I prefer closed lids and
airlocks.


My father had problems with some early fermenters as he really was using
plastic dustbins and he found the dark coloured ones imparted strange
flavours to the beer, but he soon moved onto a source of food grade
plastic.


I use plastic for primary and secondary fermenters without obvious
oxidation problems.  My personal (not technically qualified) opinion is
that the brew is not in there long enough for the oxygen permeablity to be
a significant problem.  I even use a plastic keg to store the beer for
serving.  As a slow drinker the 5 gallons can sit there for several months
pressurised with Co2.  I have not noticed any oxidation flavours.  However,
I use it only for ales as I bottle lagers.


Plastic fermenters and kegs are commonly used in UK and in Australia.  I
understand that many people here use steel containers for the keg as they
prefer higher pressures for their beer (mainly lager style presentation).




hope this is useful

I don't keg now, but am inching closer to doing so (once I can justify or
rationalize the initial cost to my ever-loving but not-quite-as-

nice introductory article about kegging, but did not answer one question: is
it ok to keep the CO2 tank in the fridge with the kegs or does it need to be
kept at room temp.?  What if any are the problems and/or dangers of doing so?
 If *really* necessary I could probably run the gas line through the side of
the spare fridge, but would prefer not to.  The HBD is great, and I look

Subject: Open fermentation


To all,


My homebrew club is having a a topic discussion on open fermentation 
and related topic, cleanliness at our next meeting. I have downloaded 
the paper by Jim Busch on Open Fermentation. It gives me a great
place to start but I would like to hear from some others who 
have experience using open fermentation or even some more info 
from Jim himself. 


Also awhile back there was a comment about homebrewers being too 
cautious about cleanliness. I would like to hear some other opinions 
and facts from those who care to comment, especially from those who 
would lose the most from not being cautious enough, professional 
brewers. 


Our club is new and there are a large number of beginners with 
questions about the level of sanitization necessary to create good 
beer. I am intrigued by the thought of open fermentation and as these 
topics are somewhat interrelated I thought they would go well 
together. 


Private Email or digest response is welcome.

Not quite.  Some terminology need to be corrected, at least as we use it
here in the States.  Corn sugar is *not* table sugar or sucrose.  We use
the following terms:


     Table sugar = cane or beet sugar = sucrose
     Corn sugar  = glucose  aka  dextrose


Thus, we use the same terminology here in the States as you do in Australia
for table sugar/sucrose.  That is *not* corn sugar.  Corn sugar (derived
from maize) is composed of glucose otherwise known as dextrose.  Glucose is
a monosaccharide.  Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of one glucose and one
fructose.


On another note...  Sucrose is dextrorotatory -- it turns polarized
light to the right.  When heated with a mild acid, sucrose is hydrolyzed
to glucose and fructose.  Glucose is dextrorotatory whereas fructose is
levorotatory (turns polarized light to the left).  Since fructose is more
levorotatory than glucose is dextrorotatory, the overall mixture is levo-
rotatory.  Hence, when sucrose is hydrolyzed by heating with mild acid
it is inverted from dextrorotatory to levorotatory.  Hence the name 'invert
sugar' for hydrolyzed sucrose.

Boil Away!        For at least an hour.  Yes the extract has

David Boe writes:


Bill also says he was on the 14th generation of yeast in that particular 
batch.  This also flies in the face of the conventional wisdom of only 
repitching yeast 3 generations.  I believe that if one has the capability of 
keeping things sterile he/she can get many more generations from a single 
starter.  I often hear it claimed that there is a possibility of the yeast 
mutating but I find it hard to believe that yeast is any more likely to 
mutate in a carboy than in a petri dish. I do, however, agree it *is* less 
likely to get *contaminated* in a laboratory than in your kitchen. A yeast 
lab (generic sense) is also capable of analyzing the yeast to ensure the 
strain is correct and not contaminated.  Am I way off base here?

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------




First, yeast sitting on a petri dish are not likely to mutate.  Mutations 
occur primarily during growth. If one yeast cell in a colony on a 
petri dish mutated, you would not notice it UNLESS the mutation conferred 
some advantage to the cell.  Anyone who grows microorganisms for a living 
knows that if you want to make sure that each batch is the same as the 
last, your best bet is to go back to the original petri dish, and pick a 
fresh colony.  Never pass your cells from one culture to another.


However, making beer does not have the rigorous requirements present in 
the pharmaceutical industry and as long as the beer made by passing 
cultures from one fermentation to the next meets your standards, why not 
do it?  Especially if it means getting your fermentation going almost 
immediately, which is insurance against some other nasty bug taking over 
your wort.


Second, David assumes that a yeast lab has the capability of testing the 
yeast to make sure that it is not contaminated and has not changed.  It is 
true that one can easily test for contamination.  However, testing for 
subtle changes in other characteristics can only be done by doing 
fermentations just like you do at home.  Yeasts are described as giving a 
drier finish, a fruity taste, etc.  You can test these at home.  A good 
lab can quantitate biochemically several factors which may contribute to 
these characteristics, but the increase or decrease in the level of a 
particular ester is not necessarily due to a mutation, nor does it 
necessarily correlate with any of the subjective taste characteristics 
for which we value certain yeast strains.


Now that we are on the subject of mutations, I'd like to hear from anyone 
who knows how the professionals select their yeast for certain traits.  I 
mentioned above that mutations will only show themselves if they give 
some selective advantage to the mutated cells.  Otherwise, they will grow 
at the same rate as the rest of the cells.  Now, here in Israel, we have 
HOT summers.  I tried brewing last summer with wet towels around my 
bucket fermentor with ok results.  But it's a hassle.  I am currently 
brewing a batch with Cooper's yeast (thanks to Andy Walsh in Australia 
for the suggestion and the yeast-thanks, Andy!).  We had a couple days 
this week where the temp was 30C in the house.  The fermentation went 
just fine.  I would like to keep passing the yeast from batch to batch 
and hopefully select a strain which is even happier at higher 
temperatures than the Coopers.  Yeast which had mutated would be more 
prevalent since they are better able to grow at higher temps (selective 
advantage).  Any comments?


Lenny Garfinkel


p.s. I also happen to grow yeast in my lab for experiments unrelated to 
beer (!).  They are happiest at 30C, although I should point out that we 
grow them aerobically.

Subject:        re: Styles & Creativity


     Excellent article that I FULLY agree with! I brew beer that I like not
really caring what it's style is.
     A few years ago I was involved with a club that ONLY brewed to style -
these folks were obsessed with trying to create one style or other. With every
meeting being a contest to see who could brew to the 'style of the month' - I
hated it. My beers never fit into their styles, and thus I never fit into
their club.
     Now I'm part of a club that just enjoys beer - anykind of beer. We all
kinda brew our OWN styles and we enjoy them all. Isn't this what brewing
beer is all about?
     If I was to open my own brewery I wouldn't brew a beer and say 'It's
just like SA, or Pete's' - NO, I'd say here's my style of amber, or brown, or
whatever. And then you style-makers would be trying to copy me.

Subject:       Piper's stand


I just know I'm going to be shown in the minority on this one but 
here goes anyway.  Flames will be silently ignored (a new trick I'm 
trying).


Sam Piper's comments were not new and certainly not unique but widely 
believed and felt by a significant number of homebrewers.


Who made the styles?  Commercial brewers, true enough.  I dissagree 
heartily with the comment about the recipes being developed out of 
economic considerations.  You think Thomas Hardy's is a cheap beer to 
make?  American Lagers for the most part yes, European brews are less 
likely to be brewed or changed for that matter in order to save 
money.  In that market they would loose their asses if they put out a 
sub-standard beer.


About the comments about judging and judging to style.  If you are a 
homebrewer and love homebrewed beer but will not or at least have not 
brewed one to style then fine.  It does not make you less the brewer. 
However, if you want to compete and/or be judged then there simply 
must be a standard to compete with/be judged against.  There is a 
growing practice in the HB competition community to acnowledge the 
vast diversity of Homebrew and provide a "No Commercial Equivalent" 
style to provide for this.  This allows *any* beer to be entered but 
without standards it becomes nothing more than a popularity contest.  
It does provide feedback for the brewer though which I suppose is the 
idea of competitions anyway.


Anyway, the reason for this rather lengthy post was to make one 
point..... Homebrewers don't need the support of the commercial world 
to justify their efforts.  Many a homebrew that was simply divine 
defied any attempts at classification.  These are meant to be 
enjoyed.  If you are of the other type of brewer, one who enjoys the 
challenge of conformity to style, then competitions provide valuable 
feedback.


It's not perfect but it's better than anarchy.

Collective wisdom: I'm in the middle of my Belgian brewing frenzy (saion...

recent issue of Zymurgy (love those quirky brews with wacky grains... and
belgian yeasts).  My question is: has anyone brewed this or any beer using
the spelt grain.  I am especially interested in the 17th century dutch
speltsbier that was sketched out.  I noted that they breewed it and served
it very 'green' from a keg. I want to hear any opinion/reactions to the
brew after it was allowed to age a bit.

Subject: Grain bed as a filter


Hi fellow brewers,
I have used the grain bed successfully as a filter. Last year I made a
pumpkin beer with canned pumpkin.  I had heard the horror stories of thick
sludge in the bottom of the fermenter.  My beer was only a partial mash, 
about 5 or 6 lbs. in my 5 gal. Gott jug (I used a trimmed-to-fit colander
as a false bottom.)  Anyway, I put the foundation water in, added the grain,  
then added the pumpkin in the rest of the mash water and added it in on top 
of the grain.  Result--no sludge and a very good beer.  In fact I just may 
have to make that Pumpkin Dunkle Weizenbock again soon....  
Sandy C.

Conventional wisdom of homebrewers is around 3 times.  This is due to
the difficulty of storing and maintaining non infected/wild yeast slurry
in most homebreweries.  Professionally, there is a rule of thumb to 
repitch 6 generations for lager yeast and as many as you want for ale
yeast.  Note this is a generation, so in most micros the same gen will
be used to start many tanks.  I know of ale breweries on the 200th gen
of the same ale yeast.

Subject: ARMSTRONG KITS




Just a little line for the resident kit brewers (I know, I know, I 
should be more creative, but in Mount Isa, the temperatures favour very 
estery beers and I don't want to risk high-cost failures) that the 
Arnstrong line of kits seem to be really good in terms of final product. 
I have had one in the bottle for a couple of weeks and it is starting to 
taste wonderful.


One hint with the Lager kit. Mix the pre-supplied yeast, with a packet 
of Wander yeast and rehydrate. I used no finings but you can dring this 
brew directly from the bottle because the sediment has stuck perfectly 
to the bottoms!


Go on, 'ave another 'omebrew!
