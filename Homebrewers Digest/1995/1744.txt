SUGAR INFO (part 2)

SYRUPS, PROCESSED SUGARS


Invert sugar :
        This is simply sucrose (aka, table sugar) that has been
        subjected to "hydrolysis" which breaks the disaccharide
        sucrose into its constituent sugars.
        The fructose is inverted (made into its optical isomer).


        The inversion process involves adding acid and is usually
        done at high temperatures to speed up the process.
        Alternately, the invertase enzyme can be used.


raw sugar / Sucanat (tm)
        The only unrefined sugar available to the average consumer
        seems to be Sucanat, an evaporated sugar cane syrup.  Raw
        beet sugar is reputed to be unsavory. It may be possible in
        some markets to get other raw sugars (e.g., in Hawaii, pineapple
        sugar may be sometimes found).


Demerara / turbinado / "Sugar in the Raw" (tm):
        This is crystalizable sugar from the first step of refinement.
        It has a tan to brown color from the residual impurities.
        Some food faddists attribute beneficial results from using this
         but unless a lot is consumed, the potential benefits are very low.


        Demerara is the UK term; turbinado the US (and Spanish
        language?) term. Demerara is usually a dark brown shade
        while turbinado is lighter, more of a tan or taupe color.
        It is ~98% sugar with some residual proteins and unfermentable
        carbohydrates present.


molasses / treacle :
        This is the residue of the sugar after the crystalized portion has
        been removed.  The choice of names for this sugar syrup
        seem to reflect regional language preferences rather than
        any major differences.  In the US, "molasses" is the preferred
        term while in the UK and ex-colonies, "treacle" is used.


        Regular treacle is an inverted sugar produced from the
        residue of refinement.  The acid treatment darkens it.
        Molasses is filtered and may have a sulfur compound added
        to sterilize and stabilize it.


        "Black treacle" is roughly the same flavor as "blackstrap
        molasses" however treacle may be produced differently.
        While there are differences between the differently named
        syrups, there is also a wide variability within syrups of the
        same name!  Find one company's product you like since
        that may be the only level of consistency obtainable.


        Light molasses is roughly 90% sugar.  Blackstrap is about
        50% sugar and has a wide variety of crud remaining.


golden syrup / Lyle's Golden Syrup(tm) :
        Like molasses, this is a syrup that remains after the crystallizable
        sugars have been removed.  However, since the syrup is
        removed later in the refinement process, it does not have as
        heavy a taste or color as molasses.


        Lyle & Tate's product is derived from cane sugar.  The syrup
        has been inverted using a strong acid (hydrochloric acid, I
        think) and then counter-acted by the addition of base (NaOH)
        after a short time.  Some of the golden color is from the
        acid treatment.  A salty taste comes from the acid + base
        combining to form NaCl.


brown sugar :
        In the US, this is just refined sugar with some molasses
        added back in.  The US food law says that only refined
        sugar (no raw components) can be sold with this name.
        This law may actually have more to do with enforcing
        a similar taste for both sugar beets and sugar cane since
        the beets, when un-refined, have a poorer taste than cane.
        [ Sidenote: with the possible elimination of sugar support
        prices in the US, this category may change...]


        Compare this to Piloncillo (Mexican brown sugar) which is
        a semi-refined granulated sugar.


candy sugar / Belgium candy sugar / sucre candi / candij sugar :
        This sugar is commonly used in Belgium beers.  It comes
        in several colors - light to dark.  When added to beer, it
        thins out the high gravity beers and contributes color and,
        for the dark version, some residual caramel flavors.


        Candy sugar is sucrose.   Its production is the same as for
        rock candy (i.e., slow crystallization of a concentrated sugar
        solution) made from straight         sucrose so a brewer should be
        able to substitute regular sugar for it.  Dark candy sugar has
        been carmelized before it is crystalized.


corn syrup :
        Basically glucose with water. May have maltose.  Beware about
        buying the typical grocery store version because it _might_ have
        some vanillin/vanilla as a flavoring.  Additionally, some brands
        have a preservative that could affect fermentation.  Dark
        corn syrup is just the regular syrup with some coloring.


        Use wherever you would use straight glucose/dextrose
        such as priming.


OTHER SUGARS


Honey :
        Honey is a complex mix of sugars but it is mainly glucose
        (roughly 30%, by weight) and fructose (40%) in invert form;
        the bees supply the invertase, which is the enzyme that
        inverts the fructose.  Honey's make-up is not consistent -
        it varies by source, season, region, and producer.


        It is about 75% fermentable sugar; the remainder is
        water, proteins, some minerals, etc.


jaggery :
        Un- or semi-refined date sugar.


lactose / milk sugar :
        An unfermentable sugar (at least by ordinary beer yeasts)
        often used to boost the residual sweetness as in "milk stouts".


maltose syrup :
        Some UK recipes call for this.  To make it, you mix glucose
        and a dextrin powder in a 4:1 ratio.  The 20% dextrin will
        remain unfermented and therefore lends body and mouthfeel
        that a pure sugar syrup would not.

No, that is not correct.  US corn sugar = glucose.  Cane sugar = sucrose.


Here's listing of different sugars (anybody want to add this to a FAQ?).

SUGAR INFO (part 1)
Saccharomyces cerevisiae translates to sugar eating beer fungus....


SIMPLE AND REFINED SUGARS


glucose / dextrose / "blood sugar" / corn sugar :
        Glucose is a monosaccharide.  This simple sugar is
        derivable from converted starches such as what happens
        when mashing malted grain.  Sugar processors can make
        this sugar from a variety of sources - corn (maize), wheat,
        rice, potatoes, in short, anything with cheap starch can be a
        input into the process.  However if not completely refined
        down to simple sugars, some of the origin can be discerned.


        The "right handed" variation of glucose is called dextrose.


maltose :
        A dissacharide made up of two glucose molecules.
        Completely fermentable.  Contributes ~45 points per pound.


fructose / "fruit sugar":
        Another monosaccharide.  In all-malt beers, this normally
        appears as only few percent of the wort.  Yeasts will rapidly
        ferment this but there might be some problems (I can't recall
        but I seem to remember that Dave Miller's book describes the
        problem as a "spill over effect" that causes some off-flavors
        due to the production of different fermentation products.)


        Fructose tastes much sweeter than glucose or even the
        combination of fructose + glucose (= sucrose).  That's why
        big food processing companies use "high fuctose" sugars
        because they get more bang for the buck by using less of
        a sweeter tasting sugar.  On the other hand, to continue the
        digression, lots of hard-core CocaCola drinkers like the
        less sweet sugars since it requires more which makes a
        thicker, more viscous soft drink..


        See the entry for "sucrose" for a description of how the
        "high fructose" syrup is made.


        Fructose is also called levulose because that form rotates
        light in a left handed direction.


sucrose / table sugar / cane sugar :
        Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of one molecule
        of glucose and one of fructose.  More precisely, it is dextrose
        plus dextrorotary fructose.  It must be broken apart before
        the yeasts can use it. When heated in an acidic solution
        (such as wort) the sugar is inverted to make D-(+)-glucose
        and D-(-)-fructose.  Yeasts will invert the sucrose if it is not
        already in that form before using by using invertase.


        It is derived from sugar beets or sugar cane that are crushed
        and dissolved in water.  The raw syrup is boiled down to
        concentrate it to a point where some fraction crystallizes.
        The remaining heavy syrup (see "molasses") is separated
        from the 95+% pure sugar.  The crystals are further processed
        several times to increase its purity yielding, eventually, the
        pure white crystals we commonly use.  Some other commonly
        used sugars are also produced during the processing.


        A complaint in the early days of modern homebrewing was
        that using table sugar  in beer-making resulted in a
        "cidery" beer.  The symptoms were that a beer made with
        table sugar that was added to the boil produced a cidery
        flavor that faded after several weeks in the bottle.  Therefore
        the rule of thumb became 'avoid all table sugar'.  While this
        is still a good idea when using malt extract, this old-(ale)wives
        tale is misleading.  That defect most likely came from poor
        yeast due to a too low pitch, insufficient free-available-nitrogen,
        or a lack         of other necessary yeast building materials in the wort.
        Table sugar can be used in small amounts with no harm
        and it is certainly cheaper to use for priming.


        This simple colorless sugar will lighten the body of a
        beer since it can be completely fermented.  It also lightens
        the beer color (hmm, negative lovibond rating? :-)

Subject: RIMS systems etc.


     
     Hello All,
     
        I have been thinking about either building or buying a RIMS system. 
     I have tried to access the Stanford archives through ftpmail but 
     haven't been able to retrieve the files as of yet.  I know about and 
     have gotten information from Sabco about their BrewMagic system but 
     the info they send is lacking in any type of technical spec's.  Are 
     there other ready made systems out there?  If so, what do they cost 
     and does anyone have their address, phone number or E-Mail address?  
     I have been reading the postings about the Pico System but it doesn't 
     quite sound like a RIMS system although it sounds like it might be 
     easily converted, I would like their address if anyone has it.  I 
     might build one (a RIMS system) but time is in short supply these days 
     and would rather buy one if the quality and price are right.  I would 
     like to hear from anyone who has used or has any information relevant 
     to this subject.
     
        On the subject of newbies and extract brewers, I think that some 
     may be a little too sensitive.  I really haven't seen much bashing of 
     them on the HBD.  If you think the little jokes about "Is my beer 
     ruined" is bashing new brewers then you are too sensitive.  It's just 
     that some subjects have been gone over numerous times and, people 
     being people, some get a little cranky that their favorite subjects 
     don't get as much bandwidth as they'd like.  There are exceptions of 
     course. One word of caution that I would like to stress to new brewers 
     - DON'T ACCEPT SOME OF THE "INFORMATION" THAT IS POSTED HERE AS 
     GOSPEL.  I am amazed at times at the amount of misinformation that is 
     posted as absolute "fact".  Use the information but research it first. 
      You might be glad you did.  I'm not putting down the HBD just take it 
     for what it is - a discussion about the topic of brewing, NOT a 
     textbook.  Of course if someone like Jim Busch or George Fix is the 
     source of information then the credibility quotient goes up 
     accordingly.  
     
        One thing I don't understand about the HBD is some of the tangents 
     that the postings take.  Take for example the mercury thread now going 
     on.  Someone was concerned about their brewpot because they broke a 
     thermometer (there is even some controversy whether this was a hoax or 
     not).  Now it seems that the discussion has turned ito a medical 
     discussion about the toxicity of mercury.  What does this have to do 
     with brewing?  I would think a warning about the use of mercury 
     thermometers would be enough.  Hopefully everyone knows that putting 
     mercury in the brewpot is not a good idea.  Multiple postings on 
     subjects are inevitable but can't we keep it to brewing.  Sometimes 
     the relationship to brewing gets stretched a little too far.
     
        One last thing, did anyone find a source for sweet gale seeds?  I 
     know someone made a posting a while back but I never found out whether 
     a sourc was located or not.

Is there any one else out there who is as sick of hearing about the perils or
lack thereof of mercury as I am?  I was under the impression, apparently incor-
rect,that the topic of this board was BREWING, not prattling on ad nauseum
about mercury!  By god, enough is enough here, people!


Re - Sam Piper:  Bravo!  I tend to agree that the current system of beer com-
petitions is seriously flawed.  I'm not entirely certain if I agree with your
statement about beers being penalized if and to the degree that they fail to
clone the archetype of a style.  Recently, a brewing colleague of mine (an
award winning brewer, I might add) advised that if I wanted to win in a comp-
etition, I should brew a caracature of what ever style I was entering.  It
seems to me that the current philosophy in beer judging is "bigger is better."
An over-emphasis on rigorously defined styles in competition seems destined to
stifle home brewing; at the very least, it is going to create a rather peculiar
sub-culture, reminicent of dog people and the American Kennel Club, who go
around lauding artificially inbred animals for measuring up to completely
arbitrary standards.  (Probable flame zone)


Re - Extract Brewers:  All hail the mighty CAN OF MALT!!  I am an extract
brewer, and I am proud of it!  I have tasted many excellent all-grain home
brews.  That said, I have also tasted many excellent extract based home brews.
I can say without reservation, that the all-grain brews were no better than the
extract based brews.  I can brew good beer in about 2 hrs., start to clean-up.
I don't think I'll be getting rid of my can-opener any time soon.  Remember, we
represent (conservatively) 80% of the hobby!  Dis us at your own peril!

Subject: Rust cleaner/"green apple quick step"


Regarding the recent thread concerning cleaning up rusty stainless, 
citric acid works miracles on rust. It's safe to use (compared to other 
acids), can go down the drain without harming the environment and is less 
labor intensive than scrubbing with a brush. BTW, it's good for cleaning 
out your car's radiator as well. I work at a shipyard and they use it for 
cleaning out nasty bilges.


A co-worker of mine recently popped open some bottles of his first-ever 
attempt at homebrewing with several of his friends.  He said it tasted OK 
and had no strange odors, but within 20 minutes, three out of four of 
them had what we here in Washington call the "green apple quick step" and 
the bathroom was quite busy for the remainder of the evening. He 
described his process for making this extract brew and it sounds like his 
sanitation was careful, so I'm at a loss to explain what went wrong. He 
offered me a sample to critique, but judging from his experience, I 
politely declined.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?
Private E-mail is fine. 


Thanks!   Lance

I'm sorry if I end up posting two messages;  after sending my first 
message on this subject I realized it didn't accurately reflect my
position.  I intended to cancel the message when I got the autobot 
reply, but that never arrived.  Here's Issue 2, similar, but different
in important ways:
==


I'd like to offer an opinion on the question of the validity of brewing
to style.  As I'm Styles Editor of Brewing Techniques magazine, a long-
time judge and contest organizer, and a recent addition to the BJCC,
you can guess what that opinion is.


This question seems to come up now and then.  Why is it an issue?  If
you can't personally relate to brewing within an agreed-upon set of
intentions and standards, then don't do it!  What could be simpler?
What is it to you, if others have decided that they can speed their
growth as brewers by using the feedback they get from contests?  


Personally, I think they're on the right track.


Yes, contests impose an artificial set of standards, and in fact the
concept of styles is an after-the-fact means of classifying beers as
we find them.  Without styles, though, judging becomes meaningless;
all you can say about a beer is either, "May I have some more?", or
"Take this sheepdip away!"  What's being judged in a contest is what
the brewer's intentions were, and how close they came to realizing
those intentions.  The motto of the builders of the Gothic cathedrals
was "Ars sine Sciencia nihil est;" they understood that intentions
aren't worth much if you can't carry them out.  Technical competence
is not enough, though, to make a beer a winner, unless the other beers
in the flight are a pretty sorry lot (which happens).  To be creative
within narrow limits is a difficult art to practice.  It asks a lot of
a brewer, but pays amazing dividends to those who master it, especially
if they plan to turn pro.  I personally would never consider investing
my own money and effort in a commercial brewery if I didn't feel I
could very precisely "visualize" a beer, and then produce exactly what
I'd visualized, repeatedly.  To do otherwise is to rely pretty heavily
on luck.


I know this sounds like a condemnation of those who choose to ignore
styles, but that's not my intention.  I've been handed many tasty and
interesting beers by brewers uninterested in styles and standards.
But the only truly great beers I've had, beers of remarkable depth and
truth, came from people who actively sought the evaluation of their
work by others.  That's why I feel that the whole styles & judging
approach is valid.  In my neighborhood, chicken farmers never cull
their own flocks, but ask a neighbor to do it for them, so their
feelings won't get in the way of their judgement.  So it is with our
brewing.  We can blind ourselves to things that keep us from growing
as brewers.  If you feel you're not doing that, and you already brew
exactly the beer you want to brew, then fine, don't change a thing.
That too is a valid approach.


To a degree, I think that the question of styles is related to why we
brew, and I think we can agree that there are a lot of different
"right" reasons for that.  Before this turns into an essay, let me
just toss out this thought:  Some feel more comfortable brewing
all-grain; others would prefer to use extracts and not be nagged about
it.  Some like Papazian's books; others prefer Miller's.  Some brew to
styles; some don't.  Big deal.

Subject: mercury


I agree that this thread should've been put to bed long, long, long ago. It
arose, as I recall, from a simple question: If one breaks a mercury
thermometer in one's mash/wort/whatever, should one toss the brew? Answer:
Yes. Plain and simple. Dental amalgams etc. aside, it is beyond dispute that
mercury is bad, bad, bad. Let the psuedo-scientists debate 'til the cows come
home about tooth fillings etc. But I challenge -- no, I dare -- anyone to
dispute that such a concentration level as a broken thermometer isn't bad. If
you have any sense and social conscience, you'll treat the broken mercury
thermometer as hazardous waste. Beyond that, this thread is ludicrous.
To those who wish to postulate about scientific theories about dental
amalgams etc., I encourage you to take your posts to a dental board. But in
closing, I submit this: Those of you who so pretentiously quote scientific
studies on dental amalgams as an absolution of the irrefutable medical
hazards of mercury --- and I refer specifically to Gary -- should  look at
the "scientific" studies of PBCs, DDT and dioxin from two decades ago when
proclaiming the "studies" you quote as absolute truth. Better yet, look at
the "scientific" studies of dioxin from five years ago, which claimed it was
an overblown risk, and which have been overwhelmingly refuted in the last
eight months.
Mercury is bad. Whether it's bad in your fillings is immaterial. It's bad
when you break your thermomether. Those who disagree are either blind to
science (including Gary the All-Knowing) or are victims of too many toxins
themselves.
Now, let's get on with brewing topics, shall we?

Subject: Hot Brewing Alternative


Leonard Garfinkel Writes:


>>Now that we are on the subject of mutations, I'd like to hear from anyone  who
knows how the professionals select their yeast for certain traits.  I mentioned
above that mutations will only show themselves if they give  some selective
advantage to the mutated cells.  Otherwise, they will grow  at the same rate as
the rest of the cells.  Now, here in Israel, we have HOT summers.  I tried
brewing last summer with wet towels around my  bucket fermentor with ok results.
But it's a hassle.  I am currently  brewing a batch with Cooper's yeast (thanks
to Andy Walsh in Australia  for the suggestion and the yeast-thanks, Andy!).  We
had a couple days  this week where the temp was 30C in the house.  The
fermentation went  just fine.  I would like to keep passing the yeast from batch
to batch  and hopefully select a strain which is even happier at higher
temperatures than the Coopers.  Yeast which had mutated would be more  prevalent
since they are better able to grow at higher temps (selective  advantage).  Any
comments?<<


Did you ever consider underground?  If you have a yard, you might just try and
dig a hole and place it in the ground.  I currently ferment my beer in a closet
in the lower level of my townhome during the summer months.  No matter how hot
it is, this area of the house (which is actualy at ground level) has a cement
slab, which seems to stay cool.  I know that when I visited missouri last year
and the "Meremec Caves" it was always cool underground.  Now, im not suggesting
you dig a 50' hole to brew beer in, however you might make something 1' or so
deeper than your fermentor, and place a piece of plywood over the top.  I would
think this could keep your beer sufficently cool even in some of the hottest
summer days.  I'd also pick a spot that gets mostly shade, or "early morning"
sun, which is usualy cooler than the "after noon" sun.  I think keeping your
beer cooler would be a better soluition to finding a yeast strain that ferments
hot.

I'm pretty new at this and often think that I am being too cautious, by
spraying Lysol before I force cool my Wort, because the lid will be off, and
so forth. I take every possible precaution I can think of even wearing a mask
when I innoculate slants. But then I figure, Hey, I've got $20+ worth of
ingeredients into this, why not be a little careful? Can it hurt to be too
careful when it comes to this? How can a clean steril environement, hurt the
flavor of the beer? The extra time it takes is less than the time spent at a
stop light. I stick with being cautious and enjoying my excellent beer!

Subject: spontaneous siphon bubbles


Dear Brewers,
        Last night, I was getting ready to bottle a Pale Ale and was 
siphoning from the secondary to the bottling tub (what's the "proper" 
term for that?) and noticed something strange. Little bubbles were 
forming in the hose.  Just one little guy at first, rolling about 
against the flow, then two, and more and more.  I found I could sort 
of chase them down to the tub by changing the curve of the hose, but 
sure enough, in a minute or so, there's another one.  This game 
continued throughout the siphoning.  IMBR? :^)
        Seriously, though, what were these bubbles? CO2? O2? Air?  The 
"in" end of the hose was way down in the beer so it wasnt sucking air. 
 Is this a normal thing  that I haven't noticed with the darker beers 
I normally brew?
        Oh. OG: 1.044, FG: 1.010 for four days running.
                                        TIA

Dear Friends, I'd like to publicly congratulate Andy "Mercury Mouth" 
Walsh for winning the Eastern Suburbs Brewmakers (ESB) 1995 Autumn Ale
Competition's Hahn Trophy.  The ESB competition represents one of the
largest and arguably best collections of homebrewers in Australia.  Each
year ESB holds two major comps, ales in the autumn and lagers in the
spring (and a bunch of less formal affairs), and the BOS in each comp
holds the Hahn Trophy for the ensuing six months.  This year there were 88
ales entered in 4 main classes: pale ales, dark ales, wheat beers, and
stouts.  Andy's splendid pale ale was best PA and best in the competition
overall.  He has a wild tale to tell about how this beer was brewed, and I
hope he will favor the HBD with it! 


Well done Andy!


Cheers, Dave in Sydney

I have been reading HBD for six months now.  Well, there are a few busy
days when I hit the filter button to archive unread messages, but I find
that I have built up a good 'database' of brewing info that I can search on
for answers. I have done that many times.


I had a fleeting thought that I want to suggest to the group.  What if we
split HBD into two: intermediate/extract brewers and all-grainers.  General
brewing topics can be sent to either at the discretion of the posting
individual.


Personally, I would continue to subscribe and archive or read both. I
haven't done much all-grain brewing, but hope to someday have the cash to
upgrade equipment, and so the advanced topics help prepare me for that day.
It may assist those with a specific interest to focus their efforts.  It
would also help to clarify if the techniques discussed are relevant to
someone's skill level.


And if it doesn't work it can always be switched back.

Subject: My confession='Normal' intake


My confession: I love beer, I love to drink beer.  However, I do *not* like
to get 'trashed' and have never really boasted about amounts.  I imbibe
socially, but also simply love the taste of beer (especially my own
homebrew). I believe I have a good internal mechanism that stops me from
drinking when I have had 'enough,' and slows down my intake when hanging
out with friends.  I think of beer as I think a beverage much as others do
soda, 90% of my liquid intake is 1) water, 2) Beer, 3) Coffee (in that
order).


Why am I posting this on HBD?  Since starting to homebrew  (and especially
since kegging) I have been concerned about intake.  Mostly because of the
puritanical attitude of many Americans that frown on alcohol consumption
that makes it seem somehow wrong to drink beer.  I don't tell many people
at work about my homebrew hobby, and lost a job once for printing labels on
the work laserwriter (a one time offense when my home computer was down).


I have tried to make the personal choice not to care what others deem moral
and to drink a beer everyday (I mean everyday).  When I have a good brew, I
have a second (not too many thirds).  On top of this I may spend an evening
or two a week with friends to sample a few brews (maybe two to four pints).




I would say that I average 10-12 (12 oz) brews per week. That is not a
boast, but wonder whether that fits into a range comparable to other
brewers?  I would appreciate some feedback on whether this is 'normal'


I want to leave you with a quote from Pat G. Babcock from an earlier HBD:


"Let a good beer be the exclamation point at the end of your day as every
sentence requires proper punctuation."

Subject: Foamy Beer


Greetings to all!  I have been lurking for sometime now and I have 
finally come across a problem that my fellow brewers could solve.
The problem:  I get half beer and half foam when pouring from my tap.  
The beer was force-carbonated; 30 lbs. CO2 `at` 38 F. and a total of 180 
seconds of shaking.  The beer was left for 3 days `at` 38 F. with 30 lbs. 
CO2 in the headspace (CO2 disconnected).  I poured the beer using the 
pressure from the corny and it came out just fine; normal carbonation and 
normal head.  As the pressure ran down I connected the CO2 with 11 lbs. 
of pressure.  I poured some beer the next day and I got half beer and 
half head.  This was the case for my last batch of beer also.  Is the 
pressure about right?  Should I crank the pressure up?  My line is about 
2-3 ft. long if that makes any difference and my CO2 tank is in the fridge.
Any help would beerly be appreciated.

Cost me about $9 a piece.  What I've started doing now is cooking at only 
medium high, but with the covers on my two 4 gallon stainless steel pots.  
Only problem is I have to watch alot closer because I'm more likely to have 
a boil-over.  One year I'll get a propane burner, but only when I can find a 
cheap used 8 gallon stainless pot.  Hopefully for around $50, (yes I know

Subject: Re: mutating yeast


While we're on the subject.  I've gone five generations when I've been too 
lazy to buy new yeast.  In the bad batches I've had, they all come from the 
first starter, not from repitching onto old yeast.  When I pitch a new 
starter, it takes between 12 and 36 hours to start fermentation.  On the 
2nd, and follow-on generations it takes less than 4 hours.  That's why I 
prefer reusing the yeast cake as much as possible.


Here's a thought for cleaning the yeast cake.  Pour the sludge into 
sterilized mason jars, fill about 1/3, then fill with sterilized water.  
Close and let settle.  Do this again and use this yeast for re-pitching.  
Pros, cons?
Any other thoughts?

Subject: Silicone Hose and Steam  Injection


I'm constructing a steam injection mash system (SIMS) along the lines
of the BT article.  Making the steam line entirely of copper is
impractical since this is a system I have to break down after brewing
and if my 3-yr old twins get a hold of it (in it's cool state, of
course) it will be kink city.  Therefore I'd like to use flexible hose
for most of the line length.


The auto parts store has 1/4"ID "silicone vacuum hose."  It's rated to
300 deg. F. at 25 in./Hg. of pressure (vacuum?).  Obviously it's not
"food grade" but is it safe?  It has a phenolic smell that may be from
a preservative coating. I'm washing it and running a potload of steam
through it to see if the last runnings have any off taste to 'em 
(I'll let the steam condense before I taste it :-) ).


Any comments on the suitability of this stuff appreciated.  Private
replies will be condensed for the benifit of the digest.  TIA.

Yes Dave, you're right, there are two types of bungs used here in Germany.
Frisch bungs are made of soft rubber and are reuseable. The second type are
polypropylene coverd with rubber. These are a bitch to remove. I get them out
with a pair of vise-grips. Tear off the rim and just yank that baby out as best
you can.
  
Luckily, all of the 5l cans from Germany are made by the same company and can

small orders. Check your local homebrew shop.

Subject: Automatic bottle fillers


  
I've been using an automatic filler for wine to fill my bottled beer. This
directs the flow of the beer radially along the walls of the bottle. When the
bottle is full, a float cuts off the flow from the siphon tube. The filler is
very fast and convenient, but I'm a bit worried about aerating the beer too
much. I've only been brewing a few months and my beer doesn't last long enough
to make judgements about long term stability problems. I would be interested in
hearing from people who have used such a filling device. Did you or do you have
problems with oxidation and off flavors? Can someone describe the effect of
aeration/oxidation on beer flavor? In what time frame to the off flavors
develop? TIA

7. Freeze the bag.


To use, just drop the "HopSicle" into the wort.

Crystal Malts are created by heating green malt in a closed kiln.
Closing the kiln keeps the moisture in.  Each individual kernal of
malt acts as a mini-mash and converts the starch to sugar.  When
the kiln is vented, the barley drys and hardens to a sugar lump
within the hull.


Unfortunately, this is a pretty crude way to do a mash and conversion
is not always 100 pct complete.  So, yes, you will get a positive
starch test from crystal if it is not mashed with other grain, but,
in the amounts normally used, the uncoverted starch does not present
a problem.

 I typically age my brew at 33 degrees F for 3 to 4 weeks after about 10 to
14 days of primary fermentation. After this aging process I artificially
corbonate with CO2. My questions are, 1. is it better to age the beer
carbonated? or if the aging period lasts longer then 3 to 4 weeks should it
be carbonated then? or as I have been doing, age for however long then
carbonate several days before drinking.

Hi everyone!  A few have asked for a clone of Pete's new Wicked Summer
Ale.  This is not a clone, but an attempt to create a quaffable,
refreshing brew for summertime consumption.  It is basically a 
low-hopped ale with wheat malt and some lemon added for flavor.
IMHO, a fine brewski for enjoying along with some charcoal-grilled
swordfish, grilled red peppers, grilled vidalia onions, and
fresh Summer berries.  Ah, but I digress...


Rick's Wicked Summer Ale (Wheat ale flavored w/ lemon)


4 lbs. American 2-row pale malt
3 lbs American 6-row pale malt (had some sitting around)
3 lbs wheat malt
1/2 cup crystal malt (40L)
1 oz cascade pellets (6.3%AAU)
1/2 ounce Tettneng pellets -flavor-(4.5%AAU)
Grated lemon peel from 2 lemons (do *not* use the bitter white pith)
Juice from 2 lemons
Wyeast 1056 500ml starter


Step-mash: Add 2.25 gal of 54degC water to crushed grains and
stabilize to 50-51degC for 30 min.  Add 1.25 gallons of 93degC
water to bring temp to 65degC; hold there for 90 min. Mash out,
sparge, etc.


Bring wort to a boil and add Cascade hops. After 30 min, add 1/2 ounce
tettnang hops, lemon peel, and lemon juice. Boil for another 30 min or   
so until volume is about 6 gallons. Chill wort, put into fermenter,
let trub settle out for a few hours, transfer clear wort to a sanitized
glass carboy, and pitch yeast.


OG= 1.052 (for a lighter beer, bring volume to six gallons)


When bottling, add 3/4 cup corn sugar and juice and zest from
2 lemons.


This is a nice refreshing brew with a hint of lemon.
Let me know if you brew and enjoy this one!
