Colour contributions would be very low, less than 1.5 degrees L, I would
guess and my estimation of the pts/lb/gal would be that the unmalted
wheat would have slightly more contribution than malted wheat: practically
speaking about 28 to 32 pts/lb/gal.  Now, the main reason I posted, and
took some guesses at your questions is your comment about fermentables.
You *do* expect to mash this don't you?  Well, then you will be creating
fermentables.  Just because the unmalted wheat won't have any enzymes to
speak of, doesn't mean that its starch won't be converted to fermentable
sugars and unfermentable dextrins by the enzymes of the barley malt in your
mash.

Bob writes (commenting on an extract brewer's post):
>Use some Munich malt if you want more maltiness.


Note it's important to mention that this was in response to an extract
brewer's post.  While it is true that Munich malt will give you more
maltiness, it is bad advice to give to an extract brewer.  Munich malt,
like Pale Ale malt, Pilsner malt, wheat malt, etc., and all the unmalted
grains, need to be *mashed*.   At the least you would have to do a partial
mash to get anything but starch haze from the aforementioned grains.

I don't think this is right.  It may be less *moles* of CO2, but all we care
about is pressure, not how many moles of gas were passed through the beer,
right?


>You have to interpret the reading on your CO2 pressure guage(s) based on the

I believe this is wrong.  I say ignore the high-pressure gauge until it
begins to drop below 300 psi and use the low-pressure gauge at face value
(i.e. no temperature compensation).  I'd be interested in further discussion
of this if there is some corroboration that temperature compensation is indeed 
necessary.

Dark *reddish* purple?  If so, that could just be reaction to dextrins.
Dextrins turn iodine reddish purple.  Starch turns iodine pretty much black.
Also, what about the grain mill that was used to crush the malt?  Was it
the store's mill which had just crushed 10 pounds of pale ale malt?  I think
that poorly-made crystal malts may have had significant residual unconverted
starch in them (back when Dave Miller wrote his TCHoHB), but most of what
we get these days appears to be of better quality.

The beer-geek phrase you seek is "racking to the priming tank," but yours
is just as valid.


This is CO2 coming out of solution.  You will get more of these bubbles if
the beer you are siphoning has been kept colder (more CO2 will be in
solution).  When the beer goes up the siphon to the top of the tube, there
is a slight negative pressure in the hose just past the top and this will
cause some of the dissolved CO2 to come out of solution.

This has been suggested before.  The main argument against it is that
both extract brewers and all-grain brewers contribute answers and both 
benefit from them.  Splitting up the HBD would only dilute the knowledge
base for both.

Subject: Gott with Phil's Phalse-bottom




I recall a thread a while back about various plumbing systems for
Gott coolers used as lauter tuns.  I just thought I would throw my
own experience in.


I got a 10 gallon Gott cooler, and a Phil's Phalse-bottom.  I followed the 
suggestions in the package.  I used a 3 inch piece (only scrap I had) of 
rigid racking tubing through a stopper.  I plugged that outward through 
the hole left by unscrewing the spigot from the Gott.  I connected standard 
3/8" brewing hose from the elbow on the Phalse-bottom to the rigid tube in 
the stopper.  I connected a short piece of the same flexible hose from the 
outside end of the rigid tube to an inline valve, then some more hose to 
drop into the boiler.  Everything looked wonderful dry...


#1 The Phalse-bottom floats when you put in the dough-in water.  This
   allows a little grain to get under it if you forget like I did.  
   Remarkably, this didn't cause huge problems later, but I will use my 
   stirring stick to hold it down as I add the first pound or two next time.  
   HBDers have mentioned weighing the Phalse-bottom down too.


The mash went well from that point until I hoisted the cooler up onto the
board straddling between my boiler and a step ladder.  


#2 In the process I knocked off the outer hose.  While trying to get the 
   hose back on the 3/4 inch stub, I pushed the stopper back into the keg.  
   By the time I had it all back together, I had about 3 pints of my 
   first runnings on the ground and my pants :-O  
   I guess it was better than on a hot kitchen stove though.


In spite of this and running dry while heating a last batch of sparge water,
I wound up at end of boil with 9-1/2 gallons of 1.046 wort which was oddly 
enough my exact gravity target...  Not too bad for my first 10 gallon batch 
with 16-1/2 pounds of grain.  I basically like the Gott with Phalse-bottom.
I have only made one batch with it, but I only had to recirculate a quart or 
so for clear wort compared to a gallon or more with previous contraptions.


I just figured I would warn other Phalse-bottom users to watchout for the
connections on either side of the cooler wall.  You may want to use one of 
those splice tubes with hose barbs on both ends to go through the stopper.  
Otherwise, use a long enough piece of rigid tubing (racking cane) that you 
can easily reseat the stopper from the outside by pulling on the hose or 
the wet rigid tubing if the warmed hose loosens and pulls off.


Before someone suggests using one of those drum taps, I agree with the 
sentiment about not drilling, and keeping the multiyear Gott warranty.

Brewing artisans and scholars-


        I have lurked here for a couple of months and thought I would
toss out a request for info that I can't seem to find elsewhere on the
net.
        The only thing that's kept me from brewing my first batch
(yes, a homebrew virgin) is my imminent departure to Japan. I have
been told that homebrewing exists in Japan, and I don't think it's
limited to moonshine or sake, but apparently it has a very limited
following. 
        If anyone out there knows anything at all about brewing in
Japan, please contact me via private email. Although I am moderately
content drinking Japanese mass-produced beer (compared to my disgust
with American high-volume crap), I'd much prefer to begin making my
own.  I've thought about sticking to cider until I return, but I'd
like to retain some of my stomach lining, too.


Thanks in advance,

Fresh hops has a much higher moisture content, and therefore weight,
than dry hops.  At the very least you'd have to correct for that. 
Many people just use homegrown hops for fininshing/dry hopping since
alpha acid determination is impractical.

===> Bob Devine writes about sugars:


Basically a good article, but need some correction especially as it relates
to fructose.


>        The "right handed" variation of glucose is called dextrose.


True.  The "right handed" enantiomer of glucose is the only one that
is found naturally -- D-(+)-Glucose.  It is dextrorotatory (rotates
polarized light in right handed direction).  The 'D' indicates that
it is the right handed enantiomer and the '(+)' indicates that it
turns polarized light to the right.


>        Fructose is also called levulose because that form rotates
>        light in a left handed direction.


Yes, naturally occurring fructose is levorotatory (rotates polarized
light in the left handed direction).  It is D-(-)-Fructose, right
handed enantiomer, but turns polarized light to the left.

This is incorrect.  Sucrose is formed from glucose (dextrose) and fructose
(levulose).  The dextrorotatory version of fructose is not found in nature.

This may be a matter of semantics, but it's important.  The sugars themselves
(sucrose, glucose, fructose) are not inverted.  Only the rotation of light
is inverted.  Sucrose is dextrorotatory.  When hydrolyzed to glucose and
fructose, it turns out that the levorotatory power of fructose is greater
than the dextrorotatory power of glucose.  As a result the fructose/glucose
solution is levorotatory.  Thus, the rotation of light of a sucrose solution
(dextrorotatory) is inverted in the hydrolyzed solution (levorotatory).
Hence the name, invert sugar for the fructose/glucose solution.  Again,
the sugars themselves are not inverted, only the rotation of light.


>Invert sugar :

See the previous explanation.  In the process of hydrolyzing sucrose,
fructose is *not* inverted from one optical isomer to the other.  This
is a misstatement.  The fructose in both sucrose and invert sugar is
D-(-)-Fructose.  (Note that for fructose to be inverted from one optical
isomer to the other, 3 stereo centers (I believe) *all* have to be
inverted, not just one.)

The beer in your secondary is saturated with CO2 at temperature.  As 
the beer flows through the siphon tube, the pressure drops and the
dissolved CO2 comes out of solution.  If the flow is slow enough, the
bubbles will collect in the high point in the tubing.  Where the tubing
meets the racking cane, there is a discontinuity in the surface.  This
causes to turbulence in the flow and further causes CO2 to come out of
solution.

You might want to give polyethylene tubing a shot.  It is the stiff,
milky white tubing sold along with the clear, vinyl (Tygon brand) tubing
in hardware stores.  It can withstand higher temperatures than vinyl
tubing and does not contain plasticizers.

Subject: Recipe suggestions for 'Corona' beer.


I am just starting out with brewing (~six months) and would like to make a
clone of the Mexican beer Corona.  I'm only using extract and would like a
recipe along fairly simple lines.


Also, I have a few questions that I'd like to ask:


1) I'm just ready to start a dark brew (Bock kit, 250ml drk malt extract,
1kg dried drk malt extract).  Is there anything I should look out for, just
recently I picked up the end of a thread on aeration and was wondering if
this brew was in the danger zone and will require something like that.
Also, what's the general thought regarding light, I'm brewing in glass on
stools in my bedroom with blinds drawn (~50% drop in light), but am tempted
to put garbage bags over the fermenters if need be.


2) I have two glass and one plastic fermenter, I was wondering if anyone
uses plastic for the initial brew and then move to the glass?  It would mean
I could keep my brews moving on steadily and I would have thought that
spending the small initial time in the plastic would be better than the
other way round like the brew shop suggested?

One data point:


The May issue of American Demographics has an article on "Who Drinks the
Microbrews?" which states, among other things, that microbrew drinkers
average "6.3 beers a week, compared with 4.7 a week for non-micro
drinkers." Results were from a nationally representative sample of 1,519
adults in a telephone survey conducted Sept-Dec. 1994.


That said, be aware that people commonly lie to survey interviewers. In
most cases, they will underestimate their drinking if they perceive higher
levels of drinking to be socially unacceptable. So take those numbers with
a grain of ... well, maybe barley?

Subject: Priming: Use mass/vol, not dry-vol/vol


Dear Friends, there's been some talk lately about priming.  In particular,
the FAQ of how much to add to a {insert your usual volume here} -sized
batch.  This prompts me to get up on my soapbox to say:  prime by mass of
sugar per volume of liquid, NOT by dry volume of sugar per volume of
liquid.  That is, use ounces (weight, not volume--damn those screwed-up
British engineering units!) per gallon or grams per litre rather than
relying on 3/4 cup of corn sugar always having the same amount in it. 
Doing this, you get the same result every time, and have much better
control over making subtle changes in your carbonation level should you so
desire.  Here is a set of values that I use; it is set up for both cane
sugar (table sugar; sucrose) and corn sugar = glucose = dextrose (see Bob
Devine's useful sugar postings a day or two ago), units are grams of sugar
per litre of beer to be primed (conversions to non-metric units are left
as an exercise for the reader): 


                        Sucrose                Corn/dext/glucose
Low-med. carb.                5.3                6.4
Med.-med/high                6.9                8.3
High carb                8.6                10.0


These numbers were sent to me by Brett Shorten long ago, and if my dim
memory serves they originated in an article in Ausbeer magazine. Low-med
carb beers are, for example, British ales, some American ales.  Most
lagers are in the Med. to med/high category.  High carb speaks for itself. 
Example: If I have a beer I want to be about medium carbonated, I'll
choose 8 gr dextrose per litre (I never use table sugar, just include it
for completeness); if my batch is 23 L, then 8 * 23 = 184 gr of sugar to
use in making up my priming solution.  I know it is possible to work out
the actual volumes of CO2 added, but have just come to use a set of
amounts that give me what I want without having actually done the
calculations. 


Note: this applies to priming with *sugar*; if you are krausening your
beer (priming with gyle), different relations apply, and these have been
summarized thoroughly in previous digests.  This kind of approach (not
original to me by any means) seems so obviously better that I just don't
understand why it isn't the standard. OK, off my soapbox now, back to
calculating the mouthfeel index of X grams mercury per litre of ....

This is not really true anymore, American IPAs bear little to no resemblence

in the 1.038-1.044 range, with a touch more hops than a best bitter, maybe
about 25 - 28 IBUs (actually it is another myth that English cask ales
are very bitter, most are quite caramel/malty).   Even in the historical

revivalist brewing.  It often amazes me on my beer travels to have to 
consistently defend US brewing, when in the US we make some of the most

Dear friends of the Net... The question is- what is the probability that a
Wyeast 1056 package that was popped about two months ago- and swelled-up...
and left sitting in the air conditioned kitchen- would still be viable. 
The package is intact- and tight as a stuffed sausage. I expect it will work

        I've always believed that the bubbles were dissolved CO2 from
the beer which would come out when at the point in my racking cane where
the width of the hose changes -- not being a scientist, I sort of think
there should be a pressure differential there, but I'm probably off base.


        If you were to, oh, stick your racking cane through a cork so that
you didn't have to hold it, which would mean the pressure inside the carboy
would drop as air wasn't getting in, then this problem would be a lot
worse. Not that I'd do anything that stupid, of course, and it certainly
wouldn't take me two days to figure out why my siphon wasn't working right
if I did ;>.


        I don't think its a problem in a normal rack.  I just clear the
bubbles occasionally by twisting the hose.


        This post is almost 100% speculation/stuff I figured out, so I
hope anyone with more of a clue will correct me if I'm wrong!

Subject: Brewing to Styles/All grain vs. extract


Message:
Time to chime in on two of the more recent threads.


In many of the recent posts re. brewing to style have pushed the idea 
that one needs to brew to a particular style in order to learn enough 
to produce predictable and repeatable results.  While having your 
beers judged by an experienced judge may help to find and fix any 
problems my brew may have, the same thing can be accomplished by 
careful record keeping, experimentation and by asking questions.  Now 
don't get me wrong.  I have nothing against brewing to style and 
competitions but my point is just because someone has never brewed to 
style or entered a competition doesn't mean that he/she can't produce 
good, balanced and repeatable brews.


As far as extract vs. all grain is concerned, the only thing I care 
about is the final product.  I brew all grain but I have had some 
truly great extract based beers.


The bottom line for both threads is that different people brew for 
different reasons and if someone else's reason doesn't jive with mine 
that doesn't make it better or worse than mine, just different!

If you are adding dry yeast, there isn't any reason to make a starter.


One gram of dry yeast contains about 20 billion yeast cells (I've counted!).
Ideally, you need about 200 billion cells for five gallons of "normal" gravity
wort, so 10 grams of dry yeast gives you all the yeast you need. (This assumes
the yeast is reasonably fresh and has been properly stored, of course.)


If you want to jump start the yeast, proof it with water and then add a cup of
cooled wort taken out at the beginning of the boil.


You'll get a great ferment with this procedure!


Further, Chris Strickland writes:

When using liquid yeast you MUST make a starter if you hope to have a decent
ferment.


A bloated pack of Wyeast contains 1 to 5 billion yeast cells.  If you pitch one
pack into a 1.040 O.G. one quart starter, you will wind up with about 20 billion
cells in the starter (Again, I've counted.)  We all know you can pitch the
quarter starter and have a decent ferment, but it is way short of the yeast
count you can deliver with just ONE packet of (fresh, properly stored) dry
yeast.  (Also way short of commercially recommended pitching rate of about 200
billion cells.)  


To answer your question, dry yeast IS easier to use.  Faster too.  But the
selection of yeasts available in dry form is limited.  Use of liquid yeasts
allows you much greater variety to choose from.  And, after all, it is the yeast
that actually makes the beer, so variety in yeast selection allows you to
achieve many more effects that you will ever be able to do with dry products.

  Amen to both those statements. I have a friend who's a BJCP National judge,
and who's won several ribbons with extract and specialty grain brews. I
certainly don't consider him 'just an extract brewer'.
  IMHO, anyone who cares enough about good beer to take the time and effort
to brew their own is a kindred spirit. I wouldn't dis such a person just
because their brewing procedures differ from mine.

  Yes, make a solution with the priming sugar. What's happening is the
sugar granules are providing nucleation sites for the CO2, which comes
out of solution and causes the foaming.

Depends on the style, and on the method of packaging. I can't comment on
the 5L minikegs, never used them, but I have primed batches in 5 gallon
Corny kegs. The usual 3/4 cup priming sugar that's appropriate for
bottling is too much for a 5 gallon Corny - 1/3 to 1/2 cup is about
right. I suspect the same is true of 5L minikegs, the priming rate is
something less than it would be for bottling.

It would have to be a really big shirt for both of us to fit, but I'm game.


Someone asked if it was okay to use Dark extract for a starter.  I've done it,
and it worked fine for me.  I think there probably are some reasons against 
it, especially with a lighter beer, but for a stout, I don't think there 
should be any problem.


Martin Lodahl spake thusly :


> Some brew to styles; some don't.  Big deal.  


Absolutely.  Can't we all just get along?  
(I still say extract is for sissies.)


If you're brewing just to win prizes, that's too bad.  If you don't read any
more into brewing competetions than is actually there, they can be a valuable
source of feedback even if you brew something truly unique.  


Someone asked about what "normal" consumption is.  I only drink about once 
every two weeks, and then I drink one beer every 10 minutes until I pass out.
After that, I only drink one every twenty minutes. 


All this stuff on styles gives me an idea, though.  Maybe someone should 
sponsor a "free-style" competetion, where we just dole out scores based on
overall impression (give or take a mood or whim).  Or maybe we could just 
give verbal descriptions, and not even numerically rank these beers.  Yeah,
that might be a good idea.  And I'll be the only judge, and all of you can 
send me a couple bucks and a couple bottles and I'll live it up.  Whadda y'all

A couple of comments on your posting.


You are right: styles evolve, especially in the US right now.  And one
can argue categories & sub-categories ad nauseum.  In fact, this
happens on an almost daily basis in the Judgenet Digest.


The current AHA categories are convenient for competition organizers
to use, as then we don't have to think up our own.  Sure, they're not
perfect, and they do change from one year to the next.  But there's
absolutely no reason (other than laziness :-) that any given
competition can't design and use their own categories.  For example,
the Michigan state fair has 12 categories.


On IPAs: the current AHA IPA style allows both British and American IPAs.

While this may be an appropriate yeast for the style, I can tell you with

using a blend of the following heathful & nat-
ural roots, barks and herbs:
        Wintergreen Leaves - Sethres Root
   Angelica Root - Wild Cherry Bark - Spikenard
   Birch Bark - Sarsaparilla Root - Anise Seed
        Made fresh daily & caffine-free.
        (Sugar-free made with saccharin.)"


So... anybody got a recipe that follows these ingredients??
If you do.. I would like a copy via email :-)


thnx,
kj

Lee Bristol suggests that you will get different CO2 levels in your beer
at the same psi setting depending on whether you keep the tank and
regulator in the fridge or out:

>The kicker is that the regulator is a mechanical device that

>If you set it to deliver 17psi at room temperature, it will deliver
>17psi at 45F, 55F, 85F, 105F, and so on.  However, the amount of CO2

>17psi/70F is significantly LESS than 17psi/45F; the equivalent amount
of >CO2 is only about 10psi/45F.


I don't think so.  This last statement is strictly true, but it doesn't
affect the problem here.  The pressure inside your keg is what your
gauge is measuring and your regulator is regulating.  As the temperature
of the delivered CO2 quickly drops to the ambient fridge temperature, it
will drop in pressure, and the regulator will deliver more gas,
resulting in the exact same equilibrium as if the tank were in the
fridge and delivering cold gas at the same psi.  You won't need to
adjust the pressure setting at all.

Warning: EE techno-babble ahead!


I got a flyer in the mail yesterday about a design contest using the
Motorola 68HC705J1A chip.  This is a processor designed for embedded
applications (such as a RIMS controller??).  It's a "one-time
programmable" chip, with 1.2K of ROM and 64 bytes of RAM, and lots of
other neat features (timer, LED drivers, etc.).  The grand prize is a
1996 Ford Explorer.  You can get a kit, complete with entry info, from
your nearest Motorola distributor.  Call 1-800-765-7795 x817 for the
distributor nearest you.  You can't enter if you work for Motorola or
Ford.


Now back to brewing...
