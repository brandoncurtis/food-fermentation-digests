Subject: Smoking grain, dude/sanitizing caps/styles/kits


     If I could offer a tip to anyone contemplating using smoked grain, 
     crush the grain BEFORE you smoke it!  I briefly rinsed the grain 
     before smoking it, as suggested in this digest, and it was a nightmare 
     to crush -- I had to take my mill apart to clear it.  I dried the 
     grain on cookie sheets in a warm oven, but obviously there was still 
     considerable moisture inside the grain.  I could not detect any rancid 
     odors or taste through the smoky characteristics, but I'm not 
     convinced they were not there.  I also think it lost some of the smoky 
     flavor in the drying process.  Next time, I will crush it and smoke it 
     the night before I mash.
     
     On sanitation -- I used to boil my bottle caps, but it was a big 
     mistake.  I could never get sufficient carbonation, regardless of how 
     much priming sugar I used.  One day I accidently left two beers in the 
     freezer too long.  Instead of the bottles breaking, they "oozed" 
     frozen beer from under the caps.  After inspecting several caps, it 
     was obvious that the plastic lining was unseating during the brief 
     boil.  After switching to a mild bleach soak, the caps seal great, and 
     I can get any level of carbonation I want.
     
     On styles -- I think they can be very useful.  The five part series on 
     Belgian beers that appeared in this digest some months ago was a true 
     education for me.  I often see people chastising newer brewers who ask 
     for a recipe to clone a particular brand.  This is how I learned how 
     to brew!  Recipes designed to emulate well-known beers like Pete's 
     Wicked Ale and Anchor Porter, for example, help you develop a good 
     sense of what combinations of specialty grains, adjuncts and hops make 
     up different flavor profiles.
     
     On using kits -- The best home brewed stout I ever drank was from an 
     extract kit.  If I ever make a wheat beer, I will use a kit just to 
     avoid any sparging hassles.  I routinely make wines from the 28-day 
     kits, and am very, very pleased with them.  Kits definitely have a 
     place in my brewing regimen.

Subject:      Re: CO2 regulator in fridge


Jeff Renner suggests that the regulator pressure reading is not affected
by the temperature of regulator, and depends only on the temperature of
the kegs:

When my regulator was inside the fridge and set to deliver 10psi`at`45F, the
amount of CO2 dissolved was appropriate.  When it was moved outside of the
fridge and read 10psi`at`75F, the pressure actually delivered to the keg was
clearly lower, causing foaming to occur, and carbonation level dropped
significantly over the next few days.  When it was raised to 17psi`at`75F and
allowed to equalize (so that normal carbonation was restored) and then moved
back inside the fridge to read 17psi`at`45F, the beer became excessively
overcarbonated.  So the theory may sound logical, but it does not stand up in
the face of observed data.


Your statement that the regulator is measuring the pressure at the keg is not
correct; the regulator measures the pressure at the source end of the line (at
the regulator itself) and not the "output" (keg) end.  As you imply, the CO2
will reach an equilibrium temperature, and this is the effective temperature
that determines how much CO2 is actually delivered.  But this temperature
clearly does *NOT* match that of the keg (45F); it is not exactly that of the
regulator either (75F).  It is somewhere in between, and will depend on the
relative masses of the CO2/tubing/etc in the different temperature "zones".


In my case, all of this and (most importantly) the fact that the regulator and
CO2 bottle are acting as a heat sink, the effective temperature is much closer
to 75F than 45F - so much so, in fact, that to my observation, the temperature
inside the fridge is insignificant, and is essentially dominated by that of
the CO2 regulator.


At least, this theory matches my observations.

     There is a possibility that I will be receiving a large amount of hops 
     in the near future. Does anyone know of a company that sells a high 
     quality vacuum sealer and the oxygen barrier bags that many retailers 
     use to seal their hops with.

Subject: Keg to Boiling Pot


Since I last posted to the list, I've made the move to all-grain. As
with many other situations in life, I don't know why I didn't 
start it sooner! 


While we were returning from the beach 2 weeks ago, We stopped by 
the Corning Outlet Store and I picked up another glass 5 gal 
carboy (they're $12) and found a 12" SS Pot lid (for about $11). 
The 6 gallon pot it fit on was $70 - too much that day.


I had this old Coors 15 gal SS keg I found in the barn, and finally 
got around to cutting a 12" diameter hole in the top so that shiny new 
lid would have a place to live. 


To get the hole in the right spot, I eyeballed the centering of the lid
on top of the keg. I wedged the lid down tight using a thin strip of
wood pushed through the keg's handles and over the top of the lid handle.
Then I took a small square of sponge dipped in paint and
pushed it around the outside diameter of the lid. When it was dry, I 
removed the lid to find a perfectly delineated guide-line. Nothing
high-tech here!


I found a "Bullet Tip" drill bit at the hardware store which I used 
to drill many holes around the circumference- the outside of my 1/4"
drill hole touching the edge of my painted line.  The drill cost 
around $5, but it was worth it at twice the price! It just
got dull at the last 2 or 3 holes. After drilling many 
holes, I finished off the cut with a carbide tipped saber-saw blade.


Then I ground down the excess with a grinding wheel mounted in my 
drill until the lid fit. Whew! Spent another 30 minutes scrubbing
the cutting oil out of the keg and trying to polish up the scratches
on the outside. I think the whole job took about 4 hours. Drilling the 
holes took the longest- I'd drill a couple of holes (dipping the drill
in oil 2 times per hole) and then let the drill cool off, while
I would cool off with Home-brew!) Boiled up some water in it to make sure 
it was clean. 


Memorial day found me doing up a batch of all-grain ale. No more 
worries with the pot boiling over! Had a rowdy boil going, but nary
a drop got more than 3/4 way up the keg! I'm thinking of doing 
double-batchs (10 gals) in the future. Maybe even extracts or partials,
again, too!

Subject: Big Yeast Experiment,  Part 1


<part 1 Big Yeast Experiment > 


Our club, the Long Beach Homebrewers, conducted a yeast experiment. We brewed
an all grain  batch of mild pale ale on a 1 barrel system. The recipe is this:
 
 For 30 gallons:           The Big Yeast Experiment Pale Ale


                           41 lbs Klages (American 2 Row Lager malt)
                           14 oz Cascade Whole hops, 60 minutes in a grain bag
                           Starting Gravity = 1.042 at 60 deg F


The recipe was simple in order to accentuate the yeast flavor contribution. 
No finishing hops were used. The beer was then divided into 12-1 gallon cider
jugs, 1-6.5 gallon plastic bucket, and 1-15 gallon fermentor. Most of the 
yeasts were dry but a few second generation yeasts and 1 Wyeast packet were
used. Only 1 packet of yeast was used for all dry yeasts and the Scottish Ale
yeast. All yeasts were fermented at room temperature (60-75 deg F). Only 
1 lager yeast was used and it developed a strong diacetyl flavor. The
experiment was a lot of work and took 10 hours to make the beer and
5 hours to bottle but it helped us to appreciate the flavor contribution
of yeasts. We would like to do this experiment again using Wyeast Ale Yeasts
and then get into lager yeasts but for now, here are the results of the first
in a series of tests of commercial yeasts:

>From our results, the Glenbrew yeast is the most attenuative, followed
by the Wyeast Scottish and Bread Yeasts. The Wyeast strains produced the 
most yeast flavor in the finished beer and they will be very interesting 
to test in a future experiment.


Because of problems found in the Doric and Nottingham yeasts, we called 
the supplier. Our supplier checked his yeasts and came up with similar 
results from the Doric and Nottingham strains. Apparently, these yeasts 
were old. We pulled these 2 yeasts from the shelves and got fresh ones.

Subject: Speaking of beerstyles...


I am tasked with writing a column on beerstyles for Brew Your Own
magazine.   Now I love brewing beer, drinking beer, and writing about
beer, but I don't believe that *anyone* can be a reliable source of
recipes for every beerstyle known.  I need help!


What I hope to do is draw on the expertise of brewers I can reach on the
Digest or through the Internet.  If you have a recipe that really and
truly sums up a particular beer style (or subcategory), please get in
touch with me.  I shall give all credit where credit is due.  My
interest is in providing brewers, especially new brewers, with some
Truth.


The catch (you knew there was a catch, right?): I have to taste the
beer.  How else to know?  I mean, Zymurgy can run recipes that took
awards in AHA-run competitions, but I don't have that resource.  All I
have is my (highly-tuned) mouth.


I am particularly interested in recipes that will work for new brewers,
although there is a place for all-grain recipes in each column.


I am also especially interested in good lager recipes.  I'm primarily an
ale brewer, and my hands-on experience with lagers is limited.


People willing to help can reach me by e-mail (gummitch`at`teleport.com) or
care of the magazine.

Subject: Big Yeast Experiment,  Part 1


<part 1 Big Yeast Experiment > 


Our club, the Long Beach Homebrewers, conducted a yeast experiment. We brewed
an all grain  batch of mild pale ale on a 1 barrel system. The recipe is this:
 
 For 30 gallons:           The Big Yeast Experiment Pale Ale


                           41 lbs Klages (American 2 Row Lager malt)
                           14 oz Cascade Whole hops, 60 minutes in a grain bag
                           Starting Gravity = 1.042 at 60 deg F


The recipe was simple in order to accentuate the yeast flavor contribution. 
No finishing hops were used. The beer was then divided into 12-1 gallon cider
jugs, 1-6.5 gallon plastic bucket, and 1-15 gallon fermentor. Most of the 
yeasts were dry but a few second generation yeasts and 1 Wyeast packet were
used. Only 1 packet of yeast was used for all dry yeasts and the Scottish Ale
yeast. All yeasts were fermented at room temperature (60-75 deg F). Only 
1 lager yeast was used and it developed a strong diacetyl flavor. The
experiment was a lot of work and took 10 hours to make the beer and
5 hours to bottle but it helped us to appreciate the flavor contribution
of yeasts. We would like to do this experiment again using Wyeast Ale Yeasts
and then get into lager yeasts but for now, here are the results of the first
in a series of tests of commercial yeasts:

Everyone wants to know what breweries they can visit while on vacation
or when moving and quite often those requests end up here on the
homebrew digest.  The Institute for Brewing Studies has created a web
site with all of the Canadian and United States Breweries listed, as
well as a large number of other breweries from around the world.  The
listing is still under construction, but we posted it anyway.  The site
is located at:


http://www.aob.org/aob/brews/brewlist.html         (Colorado Server)
http://alpha.rollanet.org/AOB/brews/brewlist.html  (Missouri Server)


and in Australia:
http://rschp2.anu.edu.au:8080/aidan/aob/brews/brewlist.html
(I've been having a few technical difficulties, so give the Australian
site a week or so to become fully operational, a ftp monster has been
eating the files that's how popular they are! :-)


Thanks to the guys at The Brewery and Aidan Heerdegen for maintaining
the mirror sites.


Hope that helps everyone who wanted to know which breweries were where,

Subject: Oak Barrel Experiment


     I have had an interest in aging beer in oak barrels for some time.  
Not having access to a barrel, I convinced Jim Mosser, owner of our 
local homebrew shop, to get a barrel and conduct some research.  Over 
the last 3 months Jim conducted some experiments and documented the 
results.  Here is a copy of his documentation.  


Oak Barrel Experiment - Jim Mosser - May, 1995


        I'd like to take a moment to address the research end of the 
experiment.  First of all, I have never encountered as much 
misinformation or disinformation about any other aspect of brewing than 
with these barrels.  I've concluded that it's impossible, in many cases, 
to separate the good info from the bogus info.  Some of the info almost 
seems to be generated by ego alone: i.e. "It's true because I say so," 
etc. (that's a general statement only, folks!).  Anyway, I finally 
decided to forego all of the hoopla, and simply plug ahead on my own.  
Having done that, here is a general chronology of what I've done to 
date.   About the experiment itself, I focused totally on the aging side 
of oak barrel use, and not dispensing.  An experiment with priming and 
dispensing might happen at a later point, but I'm not really of the 
opinion, at this time, that it's a practical idea.
 
         First, the barrel.  The one I chose to work with was a 3 gallon  
barrel made of American white oak, which was charred on the inside.  It 
was built in New England, and was brand-new.  I went with a three gallon 
barrel because I figured that, since the smaller the barrel, the higher 
would be the ratio of oak to beer.  In other words, if I could make this 
whole thing work with a 3 gallon barrel, a 5 gallon barrel would be even 
easier.
  
        The first order of business was to brew a batch of beer.  To this 
end, I chose a pre-hopped beer kit (Arkell's GWR Strong Bitter, 
manufactured by EDME), adjuncted with one half pound of dry malt.  The 
yeast used was a re-propogated bit of Chico ale yeast.  I opted for 
simplicity, because I wholly expected that I might lose the batch of 
beer for one reason or another.  This batch went well enough, and spent 
nearly four weeks in primary and secondary fermenters, at which point I 
prepared the barrel.  First, I filled the barrel with water.  It leaked 
a bit, but after a few hours the wood swelled up, and the leakage 
stopped.  So far, so good.  I then emptied the barrel and refilled it a 
couple of times, just to clear out any excess bits of loose charred 
matter.
  
        At this point, I filled the barrel with hot water and a substance 
called Barokleen, which is essentially a blend of soda ash and lye.  
This stuff stayed in the barrel for three days.  I then repeated the 
process, as this was supposed to leach tannins out of the oak, and I'm 
sure many of you have heard about perported high tannin levels in 
American white oak.  Anyway, after all of this, I soaked and rinsed the 
barrel with cold clean water five or six times over the next few days, 
always leaving the barrel full.  I then sterilized the barrel with a 
blend of sodium metabisulfite and citric acid (following the 
instructions on the package), and re-rinsed the barrel about a half-
dozen times after that with clean cold tap water.  Finally, I was ready 
to fill it with beer.  I simply siphoned directly from a carboy, put a 
stopper and airlock in the bung hole, crossed my fingers and prayed to 
the beer gods for good fortune.


        From the get-go, I drew a small amount of beer each day, to 
monitor the flavor. By day three, I began to notice the oak for the 
first time, and it grew in intensity with each day.  At day six the beer 
had developed a marvelous balance, but by day eight it was becoming 
overly oakey in character.  Finally, I pulled the beer on day ten, and 
bottled it.  I simply rinsed the barrel out twice with cold water, and 
let it sit, full.


        Meanwhile, I had brewed a second batch of beer, this one a barley 
wine.  I had read more than once that with new barrels, it might be 
advantageous to use high gravity beers the first couple of times, in 
order to leave a beer "imprint" in the barrel.  This beer was another 
kit: EDME barley wine, along with a 1kg can of Morgan's dark crystal 
Master Blend, and a re-propogated bit of Wyeast Scottish ale yeast.   
The starting gravity was 1.072, and I gave it a two week primary 
fermentation in glass.  I prepared the barrel with the sodium 
metabisulfite and citric acid as before, and rinsed it five or six 
times.  I then racked the barley wine into the barrel.   After a couple 
of days, I dry-hopped the beer with 1/3oz of Kent Golding pellets.


        After two weeks, the beer had developed an oak flavor, but not 
nearly as oppressive as the previous batch.  Furthermore, that first 
batch of beer (the Arkells), after a month in the bottle, had begun to 
lose it's oakiness to the point that it has become very drinkable.  This 
has caused me to conclude that it's probably OK to let the beer sit in 
the barrel, even if the oak flavor seems to reach an excessive point, 
because that flavor does recede somewhat with aging.  Now, I have brewed 
a batch of imperial stout (O.G.  1.065), and that will be the next beer 
to get the oak treatment, once I've decided to pull the barley wine.


        Finally, my conclusions to date.  Well, as I expected, the first 
batch was a little harsh, but certainly drinkable, and it has improved 
in the bottle with age.  The second batch is maturing beautifully, and 
the oak flavor seems to have reached a peak and stayed there.  I have 
experienced no infection problems whatsoever, and, unless I have 
overlooked something, it appears at this stage that American white oak 
barrels are nothing to be afraid of, with regard to conditioning beer.  
The oak flavor, of course, is, regardless of strength, a matter of 
personal preference.  Frankly, I have never tasted anything quite like 
it, and I am becoming rather fond of it.  Since it's a good idea to keep 
these barrels full at all times, I'm simply going to keep putting batch 
after batch of beer in there, and see what happens over time.        
 
        For all of you who have contacted me about this subject, I want to 
express thanks for your interest, and also your individual suggestions 
and offered information on the subject.  It's all been very helpful.  
For anyone interested in any  experiment updates from this point on, I 
can be reached at 1-(800)-900-8410.   I also want to thank Terry 
Terfinko personally for goading me into this experiment.  I hope this 
information will be of value to some of you.  The experiment's been a 
lot of fun, and I've also learned a bunch.   Well, that's it for now.  
To all of you, Good Brewing!

Subject: Yeast's need for zinc


Just a quick bit of info that I ran accross sometime ago, that
was later echoed in reading George Fix's "Principles of 
Brewing Science", and I summarize it below for your brewing
pleasure....


I was searching the Chemical Abstracts at the local university on
the subject of yeast nutrients & minerals.  I found an abstract
that studied yeast's need for zinc.  It found that the optimum
amount of zinc needed in the wort was 0.5 ppm, and that NONE of
the worts studied had enough zinc, and were seriously deficient.


In this study, they found that if they did add zinc to the wort,
it would produce a more rapid and healthy fermentation.  As I recall,
Fix's book also mentions that some breweries add zinc to their wort,
and target the same 0.5 ppm concentration.


My water has 0.0095 ppm zinc, which is well below the 0.5 ppm!  I
have no idea how much the malt contributes, but Fix's book indicated 
it doesn't add much.


I brew in 23 litre amounts, and that comes out to 11.5 mg per batch.
While I haven't done THIS, you can get zinc supplement tablets at the
health food stores, that contain 15 mg each, which could be trimmed 
to size.  However, I have added zinc to my beers, but from another 
source.  I didn't have two identical worts sitting side by side to 
compare, so I can't say what (if anything) it did, but it certainly 
didn't hurt either.


I offer this because I don't see much comment about it when discussing
water treatment, and from what the Abstracts says, it probably would
help.
  
Happy brewing!


Kevin

I don't think I'm a die-hard, but I only use extract in milk and for starters.
If I'm not going to do a full mash, etc, I just make a mead or something.  
Chances are I'll end up making an extract brew in the next year or two again, 
but for now all-grain is my new toy, and I'm going to keep playing with it.

However, you do feel that it's your place to tell Paul where his place 
is?  Do you know what bizarre irony you engage in when you ask someone 
to stop posting asking other people to stop posting stuff?

Then why are YOU telling Patino (and others) what they can and cannot 
discuss?  He has a right to express his opinion about that thread.


> But don't waste BW telling others to drop the subject.


Are you aware that you are wasting bandwidth in order to ask someone to 
stop wasting bandwidth by asking others to not waste bandwidth?  Do you 
know what that makes ME?  Do you know how many fingers I'm holding up?


I insist that this thread about asking people to not ask other people to
drop the mercury thread be dropped at once.

I usually use a mercury-back just before my cooling coil.  I have, however,
had many delcious beers that were dry-mercuried.

Yes, I always drink the stuff in my hydrometer flasks.  In fact, when 
bottling, Jake and I have been known to use a pilsener glass to take samples 
with.  "Just in case".

Yeah, I had some about a week after the contest, and the color is really 
close to mine.

But, checking the style guidelines, I think they may have been doing things
'by the book'.  The long and short of it is this - I love that beer, the way 
it tastes, the way it looks, everything.  (It was a little overhopped at the 
time, too, but had only been bottled 2 weeks before, after lagering in the 
secondary for many moons.  Anyway, I had some the other day and it's 
magnificent.)  And, I got good comments and a good score on it.  And, I 
learned something.  I didn't end up with a ribbon for it (got one in a diff't
category with a lower score), but that's really not why I entered.

In this case, I think it was a "judgement call" if you'll pardon the pun.  
I probably only lost 1-2 points on it, and, except in the case of an obvious
mix-up, I don't think I would bother with the trouble.  (Unless I was a point
or two away from top banana...)

Hi, I wrote earlier to sign off of homebrew digest and I was given advice on
how to signoff of Beer-l instead.  One problem I have is my address when I
signed on to homebrew digest may have been different:  brega`at`tso.uc.edu.  I
would like to sign off ASAP, so please send help (and you don't have to post
this).  Also, I lost the address to sign on and off.
Thank you.

From: troy`at`opthalmos.jsei.ucla.edu (Troy Howard)
Subject: Papazian's Red Marzen


Has anyone tried making "Hesitation Red Marzen" from Papazian's TNCBHB?  I
was fishing around for a recipe for a red ale this morning, and came across
this.  Looking at the recipe, I can't see how it would be "red".  The grain
bill calls for (from memory)


5 lbs 6-row pale
2 lbs Munich
1 lb  toasted pale (toasted in a 350F oven for 10 minutes)


I know Munich is on the dark side (~10L), but I still can't see this being
very red.  So if you have tried it, how did it turn out?  Did the lack of
crystal make it seem a little "thin"?  Or does the Munich compensate?


TIA and cheers,
