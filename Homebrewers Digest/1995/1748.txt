Subject: Forget the Mercury - Leaded Crystal Once Again


Having remembered the extensive thread on Leaded Crystal I happened upon 
an article titled "FDA Advice on Leaded Crystalware" from Art Hazards 
News (from an FDA Talk Paper dated March 12, 1991).  The article shows 
that storing Port Wine, having a normal lead level of 0.089 ppm showed 
increasing levels of lead, increasing to 3.5 ppm after 4 months.


Another example, using apple juice and crystal baby bottles and regular 
baby bottles, showed that lead levels in the juice rose from 0.001 ppm to 
0.166 after four hours, with no increase in the regular bottles.  Similar 
results were noted in using warm infant formula (contributed to the 
heating of the formula).


The primary study reviewed 60 containers from 17 different countries.  
Using a 4% acetic acid solution (similar to household vinegar) the tests 
being conducted over 1 24 hour period showed that lead levels rose from 
non-detectable to 7.2 ppm.


One conclusion was that the longer the wine and spirits sat the greater 
the lead levels.  


Sorry if this is still beating a dead horse, but at least it's nothing on 
mercury, or beating up the dentists, or blowing up my hand on a CO2 
cartridge.

Celis Pale Bock is really not very "Belgian."  In my opinion, it's a slightly
nutty pale ale brewed by a brewery formerly owned by a Belgian expatriate.
I have yet to get that kind of nutty flavour profile from any of Wyeast's
strains and have not tried the Brewtek yeasts, but Nottingham dry yeast
has given me a slight nutty flavour in the past.  I don't know if it is
alive or not, but if the yeast in the bottom of the Grant's beers is alive,
it would be a good choice, I think.  All the Grant's beers have a "peanutty"
kind of aroma and perhaps fermented cooler (low 60's), might work to emulate
Celis Pale Bock.


If it a flavour like Chimay Grande Reserve that you seek, then it is not
Belgian Ale that you are longing for, but rather Trappist Strong Ale.  The
Yeast FAQ I got (could not get the up-to-date one) did not have CL-300
in it, but if CL-300 is the old CL-30, then my guess is that it could be
similar to the Chimay yeast.  If you do use the Chimay yeast, keep your
fermentation cool (low 60's) so that the esters and peppery flavours don't
get out of control.


To answer the question in your subject, "Chimay Yeast for Belgian Pale Ale?"
I would say, no.  Chimay Yeast is a bit too peppery/spicy for a Belgian
Pale Ale.  My advice for a Belgian Pale Ale would be one of the yeasts of
Belgian origin from The Yeast Culture Kit Company or Head Start.  The
yeasts of Trappist origin usually have too much character for a Belgian
Pale Ale.

I disagree.  Assuming there was enough oxygen in the headspace of the
starter to cause the yeast to forgo the fermentation phase and stay in
the respiratory growth phase (Pasteur effect) this would only favor
exactly what we would like: lots of yeast.  Why should we care if the
starter yeast went in to alcohol production (fermentation) or not?
I would be more concerned about the fact that Nigel was suggesting
using pure dextrose.   His other source of food (DME) would be much
better.  Once monosaccharide levels reach a critical level (sorry, have
to look in a book for this one) respiratory growth is suppressed
completely (Crabtree effect).  In gerneral, brewing yeast don't respire
too well on monosaccharides (glucose (dextrose), fructose, etc.).  This
is why DME is a far better idea.


Finally, as I've posted many times in the past, glycogen levels should
ideally be high at pitching time.  Glycogen levels are the highest
just after the yeast begin to flocculate, so this is the ideal pitching
time, not high kraeusen like most books say.  Yes, you may get a shorter
lag time, but lag time (I feel) is a poor measure of the quality of a
ferment -- consider also acetaldehyde production and reduction, diacetyl
production and reduction, alcohol tolerence, attenuation, etc.

The DeWolf-Cosyns malts appear to have become less and less well-modified
in recent shipments.  I did not have any problem with several recent batches
made with 7# of DWC Pale and no other grains, but I used a JSP MaltMill and
EasyMasher.  My suspicion is perhaps that for your grind and laeuter tun, the
lower modification is causing the problems.  I just did a 60/68 upward
infusion.  I would have expected your 60F rest to have taken care of the
gumminess.  Did you mash out?  Did you let the grain bed run dry?  Maybe
a longer rest at 40C would help?  My 60F rest was 20 minutes and the 68C
rest was 1 hour.  Maybe you should try increasing your 60C rest too?

At least in my store, the Northwestern Amber sells more than twice as fast
as the Northwestern Gold.  As extracts age, they darken.  Could you have
been comparing old Gold with fresh Amber?  NW is one of the few mfrs who
put packaging dates on their boxes.  Check the dates.  I would recommend
using the extract within 6 months of the packaging date unless it is kept
refrigerated, and even then, I'd say about a year, max.  Alexanders seems to
move quite quickly too, but have you noticed that it is quite a bit less
syrupy than all other extracts?  This is intentional since the makers are
trying to minimize the caramelization that is inevitable during the
concentration process.  You will not also that Alexanders gives you less
pts/lb/gal than other extracts (see the Zymurgy article on extracts).

I boil my flavour hops 15 minutes and with 1 ounce of fresh Cascade pells
in a 5 gallon batch get a hop flavour that coats your tongue.  Yumm!
No, I think 10 minutes is fine for hop flavour and don't worry about
removing the hops too early, but I *would* worry about Hot Side Aeration
(HSA) if I were you.  Aerating hot (over 80F or so) wort oxidizes it very
quickly and the flavour result from this is often associated with "sherry"
or "nuts."  Try cooling before pouring and you will be surprized at the
improvement in your beer.

Not all judges are created equal.  With experience, most judges improve
and while the chance of getting a good judge was low 10 years ago, your
odds are far, far better these days.  It's still a crap shoot to win
a competition but after reviewing my AHA 1st round scoresheets, I'd say
that only two of my eighteen entries could have been judged better and of
those two, one may have been an odd bad bottle.  I'm an experienced judge,
but I gained a world of insight from that *impartial* feedback.  Even
at club meetings you can't always get honest feedback from a fellow brewer
when you're standing right there next to your beer.

Subject: etiquette and protocol




Q?:        What is/should be HBD etiquette?  (Beyond the standard intro comments?)  
My unoriginal suggestions, 
        # 1.  Be brief.  Edit your posting to shorten it.  Continue the Hg thread 
or slag it, but don't waste space.
        # 2.  I would suggest that those who pose questions be prepared to receive 
responses privately, acknowledge receipt to the senders, compile the 
responses and share the results.  I'll do that for the etiquette question.  
The benefits would be quicker response to the questioner and a compiled 
answer for subscribers that would likely be better than that provided by 
most individuals.  Tim Fields's roundup re Irish Moss in 1737 shows the 
virtue of this procedure.
        # 3.  corollary of 2:  Most reponses should initially be private with the 
exception of those responding to multiple questions together, who feel they 
can speak with particular authority and those who don't feel like it.  The 
anarchy of the forum is wonderful and monstrous.  The HBD is amazingly 
orderly despite the potential for chaos.  People will do what they like, I'm 
hoping some will find these suggestions appealing.  I'm not going to write 
to anyone twice if they don't acknowledge my attempt to share knowledge.
        Reducing the turnaround time on the HBD would in turn reduce the 
redundancy.  I hate to see the spread of incorrect information and feel an 
obligation to nip it in the bud.  The numerous rebuttals to Mr. Sysil 
concerning stuck fermentations make me feel that there are many like minded 
subscribers.  Redundancy here shows a weight of opinion and should be good.
        BTW, I have a lot of fun trying to get and give the best information.  I 
don't think the witty banter that takes place sharing a beer translates well 
to this medium.  Comic genius misplaced is a waste.


        Pardon me if this subject has been covered and is FAQed.  I'm restricted to 
E-mail, not by my connection, but by ignorance and a 386.  Ignorance will 
pass, but remedies from quacks and hacks are invited.

Subject: (Painted) Hot Water Circulator Pumps




I'm looking to buy a new Hot Water Circulator Pump.
I have a March pump and am satisified with its construction (all bronze, no
painted parts) and its performance.  But I'd like a little more pumping power.


So, I'm also looking at the Teel and Tayco pumps.
The ones I've looked at cost about $120 (from Graingers) and are 1/40 hp,
bronze construction, rated for potable use.
The thing I don't understand is, "why do they paint the pumps red or tan"?.
Not only are the outsides painted, but it appears that the insides (to the
extent where fluid would come into contact) are painted also.


I'd be interested in hearing from anyone with experience with these sort of
painted pumps.


Thanks.

Subject: filterbeds


        I worked with a German made lauter tun with height adjustable rakes 
and you could rake to within a couple of inches of the slotted screen (in a 
grainbed over two feet deep) without causing the wort to become cloudy.   In 
their lowest position, the rakes just skimmed about a quarter inch above the 
screen -- this was used for removing the spent grain.  If you raked that low 
during runoff, the wort definitely became cloudy.  This happened when the 
hydraulics leaked and allowed the rake to fall below what was intended.   
>From this I would conclude that, while there are fine particles held back 
throughout the whole grainbed, it is the very bottom which is critical in 
maintaining clear wort.    (BTW, a recirculation of five minutes gave 
brilliant wort.)
        I had to add this because p.90 of the Practical Brewer is misleading 
if not plain wrong.

Subject: Styles in Compention


I agree brewing to a style and producing what you expect is important.
But arbitrary style catagories don't help, especially if commercial ales
don't fit into the style catagories!!


Examples: Thomas Hardy Ale OG 1.127,  barleywine max OG 1.120 (from suds)
                EKU 28 Dopplebock  OG 1.112,  dopplebock max OG 1.080
                Old Peceular Ale  Color in the 50's and NO English styles
                  come close to it.
                McEwans Scotch Ale  black as coal,  Strong Scotch ale max 
                  color 47.0 srm


I believe the competion style catagories are seriously flawed when
commercial ales we're trying to clone won't fit into ant of the styles.
I will swear to brew only to style if everyone in favor of ridgid styles
swears to never drink a commercial brew that doesn't meet the 
proper style for color, IBU, gravity, etc.  (you'll miss a lot of classic
brews)

The sugar crystals provide nucleation sites where gases (CO2) gather
and form bubbles.  The 'solution' to your problem is to make a priming
sugar solution.

Subject: Priming foam


In HBD 1745 David Wright asks the correct amount of priming sugar for
5 liter minikegs. General wisdom says about ONE HALF the normal
priming sugar for a batch. If you use 3/4 cup normally to five
gallons, that would be 3/8 cup. Since I only keg part of a batch, and
bottle the rest, I generally just add 1 tablespoon of corn sugar to
the keg and fill it, then prime the rest of the batch in the priming
bucket at the correct proportion (takes a bit of math, there) and
then bottle the remainder.
 
Hope that helps, I've only screwed up one keg and I don't think I
overprimed, as the bottles were foamy, too.

Could any of you please recommend good brewpubs in the mentioned suburbs
and closer to town (Cambridge, Brookline etc.).
I would also like to get a list of brewing supplies stores. The only one I know
is in Woburn (I think) on Old Boston rd.
Will any of the brewpubs let me into their brewing area? 
Private email is prefered.

Yes, but get the high density polyethylene, not the low density polyethylene.
HDPE is listed as having a working temperature of 180 F, LDPE as 140 (too
low for many homebrewing purposes----are these okay for food use?). 


Actually, since Art Steinmetz's original post said he was looking for a
steam line, even 180 might be low. Tygon (and vinyl) tubing is rated at 165. 
Some other options are polyurethane hose (200 F), and the silicone tubing
that Art Steinmetz mentioned (500 F). Art mentioned that the silicone
was "Obviously not food grade", but you can get FDA approved silicone

    I am lazy.  Unfortunately I am also busy.  Regretfully my lust for 
 brewing is not great enough to view yeast starters as anything else than a 
 pain in the butt.  Why doesn't liquid yeast come in larger smack packs 
 with a higher cell count?
    Ray Daniels cites an average of 1 to 5 billion cells in a swollen 
 liquid yeast pack and a needed cell count of 200 billion for pitching.  
 OK, so maybe they can't make the pack 80 times bigger, but can't they 
 increase the cell count and create something that approximates a good 
 pitching rate?  Well, I figger there's reasons - can yeast wizards 
 elaborate?
    Should I market the Smack-N-Go?
 
    On my hydrometer question; drinking is certainly second nature to us 
 homebrewers, so its not surprising that we polish off the samples.  But 
 does anyone pour the sample back into the wort when taking a OG reading, 
 preferring to wait for a conditioned and carbonated pint?  How about when 
 sampling for FG readings?
    I guess I'm wondering if people throw caution to the wind and risk 
 contaminating their brew by replacing samples (well, if everything's 
 sanitary it should be OK, right?  Right?).  I was hoping to hear from 
 people about their practices.  How about time honored yeast starting 
 techniques or toys (I use an apple juice bottle) that people are fond of?

Hi All,


I have some Hop plants growing in their second year, and would like to add

the plants grew well.  Since the cow manure has been composted in soil I can't
add much of the composted manure mixture on top of the plant mounds.  What is

In #1746, Ray Daniels Asserted:


>When using liquid yeast you MUST make a starter if you hope to have a decent
>ferment.


Not to be argumentative, but my experiences have showed this statement to
be untrue.  I have probably used liquid yeasts for my last 25-30 batches,
and have made a grand total of *2* starters.  Every single batch has 
has a decent ferment.  Admittedly, if I don't pop it early enough, it
can take 48 hours for the ferment to become really active, but as I now
fill the carboy headspace with CO2, this never concerns me.  (I never
worried anyway actually).  To further tempt fate and conventional wisdom,
there has been one or two times, where I have not been able to wait for the
pack to swell (brewing the night before vacation and forgetting to pop the
pack early for example) and I have cut open a totally flat pack, dumped it 
in and prayed for the best.  Guess what?  It worked just fine.  


Starters are the ideal scenario.  However, if you don't make one, you will
in all likelihood end up with a healthy, active ferment.

In HBD#1745, Pat Babcock asks:


>I don't believe there is anyone out there as an "all-grainer" who
>exclusively brews all-grain batches, is there?


Sure is.  I've been on all-grain for 18 months now, and haven't touched
extract in that time.  I am not disputing the fact that you can make 
EXCELLENT beers with extract...of course you can!  For me it's like cooking
though.  If I'm going to have stew for dinner on a Saturday, I'll start 
early and make it from scratch rather than open a can of Dinty Moore.  If
I don't have time to do that, I won't have it.

On other current threads:


Mercury:  Cool element or just a really fast guy with wings on his feet?
My advice, don't eat it or paint your face with it.  If you do ingest some,
follow with a coriander chaser, make a Belgian Starter and contact your
poison control center.


CO2 tank temps:  My tanks and kegs sit out in my shed.  With a dirt floor,
a shady location, and an elevation of over 9,000' it stays a pretty 
constant 45F in there.  But no matter where I take them with me, I leave
the regulator alone, and beer is always the same.


Styles:  Some do, some don't.  Those that do, are currently stuck with
the AHA guidelines.  If you don't like their guidelines, come up with
your own.  Ok?


Normal consumption:  Dunno what 'normal' is.  I know that I probably have
between 16-24 beers a week, but almost NEVER get 'drunk' (2 most nights,
3 some nights, and I may have 4 on weekends).

I read an evaluation of a small hand held postal scale in Consumer 
Reports a couple of years ago and realized that it would work for 
weighing hops.  I find that by attaching a small plastic sandwich bag to 
hold the hops I could accurately weigh them.  It is accurate within 2 grams.  
It is scaled in ounces on one side and grams on 
the other.  It is scaled up to 4 ounces and 100 grams.  When I bought 
it, it cost about $5.  It is called an MP 4000 SCALE.  Order from METAL 
PRODUCTS ENGINEERING, INC., 3864 Santa Fe Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90058.  
For Credit Card Orders, call 1-800-824-0222.  This information is taken 
from the card that came with the scale.  I have no financial interest in 
this company.  I hope these are still available.  It seems the perfect 
low cost solution to accurate hop measurments for homebrewers.

Subject: CO2 in the Fridge--Again


Jeff Renner and Lee Bristol exchange info re: CO2 pressure and 
refrigerated tanks, etc.  My read on this is that Jeff and Lee agree that 
the regulator will supply the indicated pressure (low-side pressure) to 
the kegs regardless of ambient keg temperature.  They also seem to agree 
that the regulator will deliver more CO2 to the colder tkeg, in order to 
maintain the indicated guage pressure.


I *think* what Lee may have been saying is that although this is indeed 
true, it isn't what you *want* to maintain the level of dissolved CO2 in 
product.  IOW, you don't need to do anything to compensate for guage 
readings due to temperature changes in the system, but you *do* need to 
lower the pressure if you don't want to overcarbonate colder beer.


Did I miss what the point of contention was?


As the beer is cooled in the keg, the regulator supplies more gas to 
maintain the pressure due to reduced temp, AND supplies yet more gas to 
"replace" in effect the increased volume of CO2 that goes into solution.  
This latter effect is one you don't want if you desire the same 
carbonation level you had at the higher product temp.

In my recent post re: CO2 in the fridge I mistakenly referred to Larry 
Bristol as LEE and I want to apologize for the error and try to nip it.


Yeast Starters (1)


Ray Daniels' point re: relative population sizes of dry yeast vs liquid
packages is a good one.  However, based on common usage I've seen and 
heard part of the term 'starter' is apparently used to mean either a 
treatment meant to make (dry) yeast happy and prepped, and also to 
increase the population of (liquid) yeast.  So, some folks may be talking 
'starter' in the dry yeast context, meaning warm water pretty much.


Yeast Starters (2)  RE: Ray Daniels' comments about starter population 
increases.  The figure of 20E7 cells for a 1L starter, from an original 
package size of 1-5E7 indicates two cell splits (help me out here), 
roughly.  My question is: for some given cell count-to-sugar mass ratio 
can one expect a certain average number of such splits?  IOW, if you know 
the mass of food and know the number of cells, can you estimate how many 
times the cells will split before the food is played out?


Yeast Starters (3)  Lots of folks culture Chimay from the bottle.  I 
tried it one time by decanting the Chimay (that was good...uhhmmm) 
and pitching the sediment into a like-temperature wort.  This was all at 
about 55F I'd say, both beer and wort.  I then let the wort warm up to 
room temp, about 70F, for a week with no growth/activity of any kind.  
Other than letting the sediment warm up first and pitching into 70F wort, 
are there any 'tricks' to culturing this yeast?  Does anyone know for 
certain whether the yeast in the bottom of the Chimay bottle is the 
primary ferment yeast vs just a bottling yeast?

Jeff:  Besides the ethanol and CO2 that the yeasties make when the are going 
through active fermentation, they produce a lot of other by-products; many of 
them are esters.  Once the yeast has used up all of the corn sugar/DME/gyle 
that you primed the beer with, the yeast will begin to work on these other 
materials.  Depending on the amount of "unfermentable" dextrins in your 
finished beer, this may take days, weeks or even months.
The example that comes to mind immediately is acetylaldehyde.  This chemical 
is what gives green apples their characteristic "bite".  It is produced by all 
yeasts, but especially by lager yeast (Wyeast #2007 in particular).  It is 
what gives Bud it's signature flavor.  But if you make a lager with #2007, and 
let sit in the bottle for a few months, this characteristic will fade (I just 
experienced this firsthand).  Diacetyl is another chemical that will give you 
a butter/butterscotch flavor in beer; lagering at a low temp (<50F) will cause 
the yeast to reabsorb the diacetyl for food.
I am not a brewing scientist; but with a B.S. in biochemistry, I do know a 
little about yeast and their lifecycle.
Hope this helps

I'd just like to thank everyone who so kindly responded to my request for 
info. on the Headstart Brewing Cultures company.  Your private e-mail was 
greatly appreciated.  I have not yet been in touch with Mr. Nummers, but 
am armed with plenty of info. to get in touch with him soon.  Also thanks 
for responding on my rather quirky request fo info on lemongrass and 
lemon thyme.  Now, those of you who have used Headstart cultures: how 
good are they?  What have you used them for?  I have requested a catalog, 
but I live across the country from the company and would like some input 
on the quality and practicality of the cultures sold: are they slants?  
are they stable?  do they perform as claimed?  As always, private e-mail 
is great.

  I think they should all be judged on Mouth Feel! I also think that one
person should not be saddled with this much responsibility.  I will be a
martyr with you and try and sort all this out.  The two of us can surely
sit down and suffer together. We can split the money we get too!


  Anyone who makes one with a mercury flavor gets extra points too! as well
as corriander and siphon bubbles.  


  Someone also asked about the lack of an HBD on last Saturday... 


  The AI robot determined the content was so bad, that it did not send one
out that day.
