I have never experienced this because I always add the sugar to boiling water 
to ensure that it's sterile.  
                            
>priming lately (I have expanded three 5 ltr. mini kegs as of late). 
>What is the correct amount of priming sugar for a 5 gal. batch or 
>does it depend on the type of beer?


Yes but it depends more on the type of container you are "bottling" in.  A 
normal 5 gallon batch of bottles is primed with 3/4 cup Dextrose but for a 
party pig or keg you would only use about 1/2 that much.  Headspace is the key 
here.  In a keg you have a larger liquid volume/gas volume ratio than with 
bottles.  Because the liquid is NOT compressable (for all practical purposes) 
if you prime with the same amount of sugar the gas gets crammed into a 
proportionally smaller space creating the higher pressure.


To illistrate this, lets say you normaly bottle with 16 oz bottles and leave a 
1 oz space at the top.  That would be a 15/1 liquid/gas ratio.  If you prime 
with 3/4 Cup dextrose and get 15 psi in the bottle you would have to leave a 
1/3 liter air space (about 12 oz) in your mini keg to get the same ratio.  If 
you left only a 4 oz space you would develope something like 45 psi inside.  
This may be an oversimplification and I've made some gross assumptions to 
illistrate the point without getting too technical and so the Engineer types 
will have sombody to flame ;-).    


 As far as beer type, certain beer types (British style pale ales come to 
mind) typically have less carbonation than others but that's a different 
thread.

Subject: Conditioning Time Thread


Jeff Wolfe asks about the aging of beer; does it really accomplish anything?


Nothing is absolute and not all beers will noticably benefit from aging,
but it is my firm opinion that aging definitely plays a part in all beers
that have not been filtered.  I age all of my beers, including ales, for at
least 2 weeks in the secondary before kegging. I recently served a Brown
Malt Porter for the Southern California Homebrew Festival. It was a total
of 3 weeks old when I kegged and force carbonated it for the festival. If
you have ever tasted Hugh Baird Brown Malt, you know how bitter, smoky and
tangy it is. Truly a unique malt. I have know idea how the old English
could stomach a beer made entirely from this malt, but they apparently did
for the Old Porters. At the festival the beer was good and the brown malt
was quite evident, the beer was clearly young. Several people commented
that they liked it, but still...


Now a month later, this has turned into a truly fine brew. The brown malt
has mellowed, providing a nice balance to the sweetness of the Special B
and Chocolate Malts. Aging ie Conditioning has shown its value.


The fermentation of malt sugars into beer is more than just attenuation,
which can be regarded as the primary activity.  Total fermentation is
better defined as two phases, the Primary or Attenuative phase and a
Secondary or Conditioning phase.  The yeast do not end Phase 1 before
beginning Phase 2, the processes occur in parallel, but the conditioning
processes occur more slowly.  This is why beer (and wine) improves with
age.  Tasting the beer at bottling time will show rough edges that will
disappear after a few weeks in the bottle.  Because the conditioning
process is a function of the yeast, it follows that the greater yeast mass
in the fermenter is more effective at conditioning the beer than the
smaller amount of suspended yeast in the bottle.  Leaving the beer in the
fermenter for a total of two or even three weeks will go a long way to
improving the final beer.  This will also allow time for more sediment to
settle out before bottling, resulting in a clearer beer.

Subject: re 'creeping regulators'


FYI      I found in a small pamphlet "CO2 regulator facts and service guide" 
that the first problem they mention is 'creeping regulators' where a greater 
output is delivered than that for which the regulator is set.  Suggested 
causes are 'particles of foreign material on regulator seat', 'diaphram not 
centered or worn relief valve hole in diaphram', 'freeze up due to 
overdrawing capacity of regulators', 'worn seat'...  Most solutions
 boil down to standard mechanical advice:  Take apart, clean, replace worn 
parts, reassemble ensuring correct alignment, etc.   The pamphlet was

Subject: Re: barrel experiment


Many thanks to Jim Mosser for recounting his experiment.


Up to 10 years ago (when I left the UK), Wadworths Brewery (no relationship
except fond memories) in Devizes, Wiltshire (UK) were still selling "Old
Timer" in pins (22 pint wooden casks).  This was usually kept on a cradle
behind the bar using a tap knocked into the end of the cask.  No
carbonation was used. The beer (ale) is pretty strong, pretty flat and
delicious. It is probably akin to a barley wine in strength.


The only problem was cloudiness in stormy weather.  The publican in my
local pub said that he had to stop serving the beer whenever the weather
was stormy as the beer became hazy.  He believed that the fluctuating air
pressures disturbed the materials deposited at the bottom of the cask.


I do not know whether this is a common problem with wooden barrels.
Perhaps there was a lot of materials in the barrel because Wadworths maybe
also carried out secondary fermentation in the barrels too.  I do know that
when I bought a pin of "Old Timer" on several occasions for parties, that I
was warned to set it up in place for about one week to ensure clarity at
serving.


Perhaps someone in the UK could find out more from companies still serving
beer in barrels.  I am looking out for a small barrel to see if I can get a
clone like Old Timer!


Any one know if there are problems with using a barrel that has previously
been used for wine?

Subject: Coopers Yeast


Kevin asked about Coopers yeast in 1748:


>I am interested in this 
>yeast, I think from Dave in Sydney.  He called it Cooper's yeast.  
Lenny Garfinkel from Israel posted about Coopers yeast.


>Is it the same yeast that comes in the Cooper's real ale kit 
There are actually 2 sorts.
I am told the dried yeast that comes with the kit is actually
of New Zealand origin (Mauri Foods? - I'll check this up).
It is a pretty clean, quick fermenter that seems to work well
at highish temperatures. This is the one Lenny posted about.
The packet says it works at up to 32C - but you're crazy if you
intentionally ferment it at this temperature - it is much better
to try and keep the temperature closer to 20C. If you just
cannot avoid it, then this yeast is OK at the higher end. I know
someone who read the kit instructions (absoluely terrible, they
are too!) and thought that the higher the temperature, the better,
so he wrapped his beer in a blanket and kept the beer fermenting
around 36C (about 98F). The yeast coped, but I must say this beer
was absolutely the worst beer I have ever tried. It smelled
and tasted like "car-tyre" brown.


The other type of Coopers yeast is that you can culture from
a bottle of Coopers Sparkling Ale. This is a completely
different strain, and much fruitier than the dried one. I have also 
used this at higher temps (upper 20s) with some success. 
Again, I would recommend closer to 20C (or even lower) if 
you can manage it. I believe Yeast Labs Australian Ale was
originally cultured from this strain, so if you can get Yeast Labs,
that is probably pretty close to the real thing.


>Does anyone have any recipes for two cans of 
>Cooper's real ale kits?
Coopers Sparkling Ale is a bit of an Australian classic.
It is a throwback to the sort of beer brewed in Australia
in colonial days. Coopers have been through hard times,
but have recently become quite a success story with the
greater interest in different beer styles.
It is basically of the India Pale Ale style, but is sweetish,
earthy and definitely could not be mistaken as being of
either British or American origin. A key component is the
brewing water, which is filtered Adelaide tap water. Most people
would call this water "mud". I grew up in Adelaide, and learned
to tolerate the stuff, but cannot stand it now (the water that is!).


Anyway, I have tasted beers made from the real ale kits that
I would swear were the commercial product. I am not certain of
this, but would say the Real Ale kit is pretty much reduced
Sparkling Ale wort.
So here is a go at a recipe for Coopers Sparkling Ale (20 litres)


1 can Coopers Real Ale (1.8Kg)
1kg Coopers liquid light malt extract
500g sucrose (Coopers use a 20% sugar ratio)
water treatment: 1 handful of dirt 
no finishing hops.
yeast derived from a bottle of Coopers, or YeastLabs
     Australian ale (do *not* use the dried yeast with the
     kit as it is very different)
OG=1.052


Alternatively, just throw 2 kits together and forget the malt
and sugar.

PS. just kidding about the above water treatment.

Greetings-
Last Wed. I made a wheat beer using 2 cans of M&F wheat malt
extract. The recipe is in Charlie P.'s HBC.  I added the yeast
Wed. around 9 pm.  Thursday morning the ferment was going so wild
the vodka was being thrown out of the airlock by the CO2.  The 
krausen was about an inch high in the 6.5 gal. fermenter.  Friday,
it was done and the yeast began to settle.  I racked Friday night.
The gravity was 1.012.  The only problem was the taste.  The beer
tasted like water.  My questions:  Why did it ferment THAT fast.
(Yeast: Muntona dry ale yeast `at` 75 F).  I know my beer is not 
ruined.  Is there anything I can do to make it more palatable?
I don't think dry hopping will cover the watery taste (and it 
isn't approrirate for the style :)).  I have thought of adding
some fruit to the secondary.  Comments?  TIA  Glenn

Subject:       TRUB REMOVAL


Hi all,
I've been lurking for awhile and have seen a lot of what looks like 
good and helpful info, mercury notwithstyanding.  I've brewed 
extract/specialty grain ales for about a year and I've got a question 
for the experienced brewers out there.  What are your favorite 
methods/procedures for getting the cooled wort off the trub?  I've 
tried letting the cooled wort settle for a few hours before siphoning 
but that still, it seems to me, leaves a lot of good wort still 
trapped in the trub.  I have tried to strain the stuff through a 
steeping bag but it plugs up solidly. Very frustrating.  My fall back 
procedure has been to wait until after primary, but most references 
recommend against doing that.


Any and all suggestions and hints welcome, either way.


TIA,

First of all, I want to thank all that responded to my last (and first)
posting on Trub. The response was great. I feel I no longer need to lurk in
the shadows, in fact I might just gripe abit and really feel like part of the
collective.


My question today is about brewing water. I want to go to partial or all
grain and would like to know if anybody in New York City can tell me about
the specs on the water. Or is there a known source of bottled water available
that is good for brewing. Please email me or post to the collective. Thanks.


Now for the gripe!


I recently placed and order from Hop Tech in California. I found   
them to be quite knowlegable and helpful on the phone. I ordered some
equipment and one of their "Pacific Coast Brewing Co." kits. The kit was
complete with malt extract, hops, ect. but without any mention of the
ingredients. When I called to find out at least what kind of hops they were
supplying in the kit I was told that they could not give out that
information. They said the "PCB Co." does not allow them to give any
information concerning their brewing kits. As a homebrewer I am always on the
look out for a good brew. Making beer by no means stops me from purchasing
beer. What's the big secret? I know it took someone awhile to formulate their
own recipe but I've found (except in this instance) that most people in the
brewing world (especially HomeBrewers) are more than happy, even excited to
share their beer knowledge. I don't think I am going to put the "PCB Co." out
of business with my five gallon set up. 


I would love to hear anybodys comment on this matter. Lets make it an open
discussion. Thanks.




David.

Yikes!


Good point, Spencer. I should have looked up the working pressure
on all of those types of plastic tubing and included that information
as well. The silicon tubing that I was looking at has a working
pressure of 10psi at 70F....don't know what it would be at 212, but
you're right, it's likely not going to stand up as a steam line.
Just looking at the max working temperature alone does not tell
you what the plastic will do under pressure.

Starters are the ideal scenario because, as Ray notes, they are the only
way to guarantee a quick, active, complete fermentation.  I'm sorry, but
your limited anecdotal evidence is not sufficient reason to follow your
advice, at least not in the face of years of research and thousands of
fermentations -- the cumulative experience of amateur and professional
brewers.  Or, in the face of the company responsible for producing the
vast majority of liquid yeast packages in the homebrewing trade: ask the
owner, Dave Logsdon, whether you should be using a starter.


It's certainly true that pitching the yeast without a starter will
*probably* produce a complete fermentation.  But why take a chance on an
incomplete fermentation, or a fermentation that takes way longer than
necessary, or a fermentation that takes days to start, when making a
starter is so absurdly easy?


There really is *no* substitute for care in brewing.


You like anecdotes?  Here's one: my last 10 gallon batch of ale was
pitched with a quart starter, aerated thoroughly (in an open fermenter)a
and fermented out so quickly and completely that we were drinking it
from the keg 8 days after I boiled the wort.  Bright beer, no filtering,
flavor and conditioning excellent.  You cannot do that without a
starter.  Seriously.

Subject: mashing specialty malts


There have been several postings of late mentioning the mashing (or not 
mashing) of specialty grains when used in extract recipes. After mentally 
collating all the info I've seen here and in books, I've come to the 
conclusion that some of these grains (for example crystal) do not need to 
be mashed, while others (for example Munich) should be mashed.  I've also 
seen phrases like "needs to be mashed together with other grains".


Well, I don't mind telling you I am confused (not worried - I'll have a 
homebrew this afternoon). I think I'm mixing up partial mashing, full 
mashing, and steeping of specialty grains.  I don't mind mashing *all* my 
specialty grains at this point because it will be good practice [a.k.a. I'm 
on the slippery slope toward all-grain], but I would like to understand the 
difference between what *needs* to be done vs. what might be fun to try.  
Further, maybe I am already doing any required mashing by steeping?  jeez.


If you can help me sort out this Gordian knot, I will be most happy to post 
a summary.

I made an ale (1.045 OG) using the "La Chouffe" yeast from YCKC.  It's
got a real nice "yeast spice" character, from (to my nose, anyway)
low-level phenols and lots of esters (yes, some banana, but not much,
and mixed with others).  It was sweetish when bottled (too soon, but I
was trying to make a competition deadline :-), but has dried out
nicely over the last 6 months.

Subject: Weizen/Wyeast 3056


Hey all,


A few quick questions:  Any special considerations when using Wyeast 3056 
Bavarian Wheat?---the yeast.faq was none too kind in describing this 
combination of strains, particularly that it is difficult to get the right 
clovey character and that Wyeast was working to improve the situation.  Of 
course, I had already purchased the stuff before reading the faq.  ;)  


As my first question would indicate, I'm about to embark on a Weizen adventure,
and was specifically wondering about hopping rates.  The recipes I've been 
able to find seem to be very low in IBUs.  I was planning to use 0.5 oz. 
Tettnanger at each of 60, 40, and 20 min in the boil (13.5 IBU) and finishing 
with 0.5 oz. Hallertauer.  Does this look to be in the ballpark? BTW, this 
recipe will be all-grain as shown below.  Feel free to comment (privately or 
otherwise) on the grain-bill as well---oh, and no, I don't have local access 
to authentic German grains. :-( It was all I could do to scrape together this 
stuff at my local supplier---and it's also "clean-out-the-cupboard" time.  
This recipe should be enough in and out of style to appropriately perturb both 
the "Stylers" *AND* the "Anti-Stylers". ;-)


3.0 lbs US Wheat malt
1.0 lbs Belgian Wheat malt
2.5 lbs US 2-row pale
2.0 lbs US 6-row pale (should be lager??)

0.5 lbs British 40L crystal (appropriate??)

I assume there is a cost issue involved here.  First, just the cost of the wort
and
nutrients to grow up the additional yeast.  Shipping a heavier, larger package.
You
could concentrate it, but the normal technique for concentrating yeast (in the
lab or
at the brewery) would be centrifugation and this would be quite costly on the
kind of
production basis needed to make thousands of yeast packs every week.  Also,
viability
may come into play if you tried to collect a "paste" of flocculated cells.  


It will be interesting to hear what those involved in the yeast trade have to
say about this.

I guess everyone has a different definition of a "decent" ferment.  Mine is that
you
reach high krausen within 24 hours of pitching (and preferably within 12 hours).


Anything longer than 24 hours means you have substantially changed the dynamics
of the ferment.  (Yeast growth, oxygen uptake, nutrient usage, etc.)  Flavor
differences may be encountered.  


Then too, the longer it takes the yeast to get going, the greater period of time
the
bacteria and other beasties (technial term) have to multiply in your wort. 




Kirk Fleming / Metro Technologies <flemingk`at`usa.net> says:

I've never heard the term "starter" applied to the process of rehydrating dry
yeast and
I would suggest to those using it that it is confusing if not downright
incorrect. 


When I occasionally use dry yeast, I will actually add a half-cup to a cup of
cooled
wort to the rehydrated yeast an hour or two or so before pitching.  If the yeast
is viable, I
will soon see clouds of white foam start to appear on the top of this wort/yeast
mixture.  I believe the proper term for this process is called "proofing" or
perhaps
"proving" the yeast.  The objective is not to increase the yeast population, but
simply
to get it going and demonstrate that it is viable.


Personally, I reserve the term "starter" for occasions when you are actively
trying to
multiply the population of yeast.  In these cases you will add 5 to 20 times as
much
wort as you are starting out with.  I suppose technically you might accurately
describe
this as "propagating" the yeast.




Kirk Fleming / Metro Technologies <flemingk`at`usa.net> also says:


>My question is: for some given cell count-to-sugar mass ratio

Good question.  One of the microbiologists may be able to explain why I'm wrong,
but
I think thge answer is NO.  Yeast growth depends upon more than just sugar.
They
also need oxygen and nitrogen (usually called Free Amino Nitrogen or FAN.) 
Oxygen, in particular is critical for the creation of cell walls that are needed
for
replication.  Thus, characteristics other than fermentable sugar will play a
role in the
total number of cells produced.  Also, I suppose some of it will be strain
dependant.  


Having said that, it may still be true be that useful approximations are
available to
guide the use of starters.  


When breweries are propagating yeast, they provide constant agitation and
aeration
to maximize growth.  Of course, the resulting yeast population doesn't exactly
produce a "normal" ferment the first time you use it.

Subject: Singing the Praise of Amylase!


        My apologies, I'm just an extract brewer ( couldn't leave that one
alone!). Anyway, I posted about a couple of "stuck ferment" batches some
months ago and got the usual helpful advice regarding yeast manangement and
fermentation procedure. Unfortunately, this was not my problem. However,
there was some discussion on the HBD regarding unfermentable starches in
the wort and adding amylase enzyme to the stuck fermentation, so I said
"what the f**k, lets try it".


        I added 1 tsp. of amylase (no further information here as to type
or derivation, the package just said amylase) to each of the 5 gal. batches
on April 24, and they're still bubbling away! Here's a brief status:


TYPE                    OG      STUCK AT        PRESENT GRAVITY


(strong) IPA            1.064   1.038           1.021


Lager (well, steam)     1.050   1.030           1.010


        I did repitch some yeast into the lager with the enzyme (cause I
had it on hand), and maybe that's why it seems to be proceeding slightly
better than the ale.


        Now how does an extract brew achieve such a high level of
unfermentables? Both batches contained some specialty grain malt which was
steeped in the brew water as it was heated and removed as the water began
to boil ( a la Charlie P.). Both contained a lot of DME. SO, Harry waited
until he pulled the specialty malts in the mesh bag out of the brew water
(now boiling), and just dumped in the DME in. Yeah, you get this glop on
the stirring spoon that looks like a giant mutant Sugar Daddy, which
eventually re-melts. My theory is that this (lack of?) procedure
"complicated" a good deal of the DME's simple sugars, making them
unappealing to yeast. The amylase is undoing all that, but at a slow and
steady pace. I'm just going to wait it out, because I'm afraid of bottling
too soon and creating neat little bombs.


        By the way, I still owe the HBD a summary of my Mini Keg inquiry.
Coming soon!

EKU 28 is not a dopplebock by German law, which sets a very specific

Closest is probably "old ale".  I wouldn't get hung up on color.
Color counts for 2 points out of 50 when judging, or about 4% of the
total.  Old Peculier might be better entered as a "specialty" beer,
anyway, because of the treacle.

47 is black.  Anything above about 30 is black.  Note the verbal
description of color for the Strong Scotch Ale category: " Deep copper
to very black."


As a reference point, Guinness Draft color is given as EBC 130, which
translates to roughly 60 SRM (or closer to 40SRM if you believe the
AHA's chart).  Is McEwans as black as Guinness?  I don't think so.

My advice would be slightly different.  I tried it once, and did experience
a few problems, but saw the light on handling it properly.  There should
be no need to dry it in the oven.  Briefly rinse the grains, and put them
in a cookie sheet of some type in the middle of a Weber.  If you put the
charcoal and wood chips on the sides (not under the sheet) you can avoid
scoarching the grains (indirect method for the charcoal-grilling-literate
among us).  Keep the lid on, but remove it and stir and turn the grains
about every 5 minutes.  Keep doing this until the grains are BONE dry.
If needed, keep adding wood chips to keep the smoke going.  After this,
crushing should be pretty easy.


I had a little free time on Saturday, so I decided to refurbish some
kegs I had not used before.  So I bought all the needed gaskets, and
went to work.  While I was scrubbing the outside of the kegs to clean
them off some, and taking them apart to replace rubber, I decided to
go whole hog and got out the BEST and sanitize them as well.  No real
reasonother than doing a job completely.  After I was done, I replaced
the lids and put them out in the shed.  My question is this:  If I am not
going to put beer in these for another week or two (I have two batches 
that should be ready then) do I need to resanitize?  I seated the lids
firmly with CO2, so I would think that they would still be sanitary
regardless of how long they sit.  Is my thinking flawed?

This is incorrect.  The cool fermentation results in lower ester production 
thus a less fruity, more crisp beer.  The diacetyl is reabsorbed when the 
temperature is raised up to around 60-70.  This is sometimes refered to a 
diacetyl rest.  Some lager yeasts will require this rest otherwise you'll 
wind up with a beer that would taste pretty darn good poured over popcorn.

Hi everyone,


Me and my brewing partner just won best of show in a beer competition - for
which we got a kegging system! 


Anyhow, I am now trying to keg my beer for the first time and I have a few
questions (I read the kegging issue of zymurgy but it didn't answer all my
questions). 


How much iodophor should one use to sanitize?  
 .5 oz for 5 gallons?  2 tsp? how much?


If I put the keg in my refrigerator (standing up) and put the CO2 cannister in
with it standing at the same level, do I have to worry about beer going into
the regulator?   If so, what should I do about it?


I read that you don't have to worry about beer going into the regulator if you
have a cut-off valve.  How do I know if my regulator has this? If not, how much
are they? 


Can I carbonate my beer by just hooking it up and setting the regulator for the
right temperature for a couple of days, or do I still have to shake some CO2
into the beer? 




Where can I get some more ball-lock kegs cheaply? The place that donated my
kegging system sells only new ones at $77 a pop (no pun intended). 


Thanks in advance for your help!

First, learning from the HBD I just did my first all-grain batch.  This is
        a TERRIFIC resource, a place to get good ideas...and to help
        clarify what brewing is really all about.  Thanks!!!


My two pfennigs about siphoning.  The new BT has some great suggestions
        from readers about siphoning from glass carboys!  The best IMO
        utilizes a plastic carboy cap w/2 ports...one through which the 
        racking cane passes and the other to which a 1 gal plastic jug can 
        be attached via a bored stopper.  One simply squeezes the former
        milk jug to create a low positive pressure in this full carboy
        and watch the beer flow from the racking cane into the tube and
        into the attached empty carboy!  Pull off the jug and you're
        done.  Great idea!  Anyone think there's serious contamination
        risk with this?


My only change will be to try and use a foot pump, those used to
        inflate rafts, in place of the jug.  This would free both
        hands for collecting SG samples, guiding the output hose, etc.

Subject: Mercury beers?


Ok...  I guess I still don't have this Mercury thing figured out yet.
We have a 1965 Mercury Monteray sitting in the driveway that my wife and I
are in the process of restoring.  We've replaced a lot of parts and still
have the old ones laying around.  Is it ok to use the used parts for our
beers or do they have to be new Mercury parts?  Would the old power steering
pump go better in a stout or a porter?  Would I have to degrease the brake
drums or just throw them in the mash?  Would the Mercury air filter be ok
for airation?  Would the old Mercury seat covers make good hop bags?


Inquiring Mercury owners want to know!      #%^)
