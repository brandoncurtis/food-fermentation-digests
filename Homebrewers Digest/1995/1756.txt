Subject: nutritious haze?


        There have been lots of postings concerning finings and removing 
haze from beer.   There are some reasons to want to make a clear beer, but I 
wonder if some of the concern is unfounded.  You might want a haze-free beer:
        -- to enter a competition in a category which calls for a haze-free 
beer;
        -- to serve to people who dislike haze (and can't be 'persuaded');
        -- when the haze is yeast, in order to reduce yeast intake.  A 
question for the medical types:  what are the effects of large yeast 
intakes?  Nucleic acid, gall stones, laxative, what's the scoop?
        Lovers of Wit and Hefe-weizen like myself able to enjoy a beer with 
haze.  Are homebrewers trying to imitate commercial brewers, when commercial 
brewers in turn are trying to catering to public preference?  Make a hazy 
beer and love it!  What is the source of the concern?   Aren't all those 
proteins nutritious?
        I've got a great little filter, but it's an extra step and seldom 
worth the trouble.

Subject: wheat beer explosion




there was a thread on this a while back, but i never saw any responses, so 
here goes again . . .


i'm currently fermenting a wheat beer (all grain, single decoction more or 
less out of warner), pitched sunday evening.  i'm using a second generation 
wyeast 3068 (first generation was my last batch of wheat beer, which tastes 
great imho).  within 12 hours of pitching, it was generating great gobs of 
foam and whatnot out of the blowoff tube; by the time i got home from work, 
the krauesen had fallen back to the usual inch or two on top, so i replaced 
the blowoff tube with an airlock.  at this point it's monday evening.  the 
airlock has been giving off a bubble every 5 - 10 seconds; nothing really 
very different than past batches.  this morning (wednesday), i checked 
before work, and there was foam everywhere.  this conforms to what someone 
had reported several months ago (explosion around the third day).  what is 
interesting (and i don't recall seeing this in previous posts) was the 
quality of the foam: it was quite creamy (i guess as oppposed to foamy), 
almost like the head on guiness.  there's no obvious off smell coming from 
the carboy.  temperature throughout the fermentation has been about 70f.


what is a plausible explanation for the discrete change in fermentation 
output?  similarly, why the different quality of the foam?  my primitive 
understanding on foam is that it is determined by the protein composition of 
the wort/beer.  if this is the case, does the change suggest that somehow 
the protein composition of the wort changed overnight?  what would account 
for this?


email is fine; i'll summarize if there's alot of interest.

Haven't experienced any problems with the few I've had.  I did have a
Bodingtons this weekend and cut open the can to look at this thing.  It was 2
pieces of plastic.  The main piece of the widget was used to
anchor it (by friction) to the sides, near the bottom of the can. The
second smaller piece was used as cap to hold in the gases.  I don't 
completely understand how the gas gets released though.  The
widget I looked at could *not* have passed thru the opening of the
can, but I'm sure there are different widget manufacturers out there.


Cheers,

Just my $.02 on this thread-
I drank all but the last bottle of my first batch over the period of about
two months, keeping the brew stored in the cupboard, and transferring it to
the fridge 2 hrs.-1 week before drinking. It tasted good, but didn't have
the greatest head retention or mouthfeel. The last bottle happened to sit
in the fridge for over a month, and I drank it tonight. What a difference!
It's like a different beer. It has an excellent mouthfeel and a nice thick,
creamy head. I'll be storing as much brew in the fridge as possible from
now on.

Subject: Pale Ale




I wouldn't ordinarily clutter up bandwidth with a recipe request,
but this is for a VERY special occassion....


Some friends near and dear to our hearts have invited Anna & I to 
their wedding July 29.  I was quite flattered when they asked that
I brew a batch of beer specifically for the event!  Unfortunately,
they have several wheat and fruit beers already being provided, so
my hefe-weizen is not needed.  They said their guests would generally
not enjoy dark beers, so I was thinking a pale ale...more specifically,
a light;y hopped, paler than most, pale ale.  I don't want it too
bitter, it should go down smooth. 


So I'm asking the collective wisdom to dig through those recipe logs
and find me your BEST all-grain pale ale.  I mean the one that you
almost couldn't stop drinking until it was all gone, and your friends
creamed over it.  E-mail to me please.

>Steve Zabarnick


Here is the receipt I got from Marc de Jonge (the author of the decoction
FAQ (dejonge`at`geof.ruu.nl) :


- ----------


DE KONINCK


Receipt :


80% pilsner malt        [actually a slightly higher kilned type, between
pils                           and pale]
10% munich                [for a bit of extra flavour, see above]
10% dark caramel malt
Medium-hard water        [not a Burton type of pale ale!]
24 EBU, Saaz                [Belgian and Bohemian]
'de Koninck' yeast


Procedure :


Double decoction with rests at 54 and 67C.
OG 1048.
Add the last 10% of the hops 10 min before the end of the boil.
Primary ferment around 21C, secondary near 14C.


- ------------


Since De Koninck yeast is unavailable (?), I used Wyeast British Ale.
This yeast can stand a low temperature.
I have tried to make 'De Konink' twice so far, with no luck.
The first trial got to estery due to a high primary fermentation.
(Completed fermentation in 2 1/2 day at 23 C. - I didn't have a chance
to use a secondary fermentation :)
My second batch was all right with a malty taste, but it didn't hit the target.
(primary 19 C, secondary 15 C)
I think I will switch to another yeast next time.
A iron kettle is used for the boiling of the decoction part (that is
what I have read)
If you succeed, send me a note.


Good luck !
