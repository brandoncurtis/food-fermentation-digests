Subject: Boiler RIMS system


Hi all...
 
Subject 1:  
  I'm a lowly extract brewer who wants to go all-grain. I'm in the 
plumbing/hot-water heating/gasfitting business - I've got a nice
high-efficiency boiler that I got at an auction sitting in the shop.
Boiler is 75000 BTU and rated 95% efficient. I paid only $300 Canadian
for it :-). The manufacturer went under, so parts aren't available - this
means I don't want to install it in a customer's house. I've been kicking
around ideas for a RIMS system using this boiler with a heat exchanger as
a heat source.
 
  Anybody here on the HBD have any experience with such a system or ideas
for cool ways to connect it all up? I have access to large quantities of
plumbing scrap and can buy plumbing parts at wholesale prices.
 
Subject 2:  
  I also have probably a dozen or so natural-gas hot-water tank burners
kicking around - both 36000 and 50000 BTU. How well do these work as 
wort boiling heat sources? Are they big enough to do 5 gallon full boils
in a reasonable amount of time? Has anyone out there tried up-rating one
of these things to a higher BTU rating by drilling the orifice? If so,
did you experiment to see how far you could push it? What I'm getting at 
is that, while it should be do-able, you would eventually get to a point
where the venturi couldn't supply enough primary air for the larger amount
of gas, and you'd start getting incomplete combustion and sooting.
 
  If I don't hear from anyone about this, I will experiment to find the
BTU limit of these burners and will post the info for you DIY brewers.

Subject: Dropping revisited




Bob Talkiewicz says in HBD 1764:


>I thought that the 'dropping' thread from a few months ago made it clear 
>that it referred to racking early with minimal aeration.  At least that 
>was the way I understood it.  


I don't think any such consensus was ever reached.  Opinions varied, but I 
just reviewed the dropping thread and my interpretation is that dropping 
involves aeration.  In terms of yeast rousing it seems to me that 
"dropping" without aeration is called "stirring" and could be more 
easily accomplished with a spoon or by simply rocking the fermenter.
In terms of the other effects of dropping, e.g., getting the beer off the
trub, dropping without aerating is called "racking".


What distinguishes "dropping" from "stirring" and "racking" is aeration.


>(Did this evolve out of the recent  question by someone who wanted to 
>dump into secondary using a funnel?)


I think so.


>What I was really after was the second result of dropping, which is to 
>increase the level of diacetyl.  


Increased diacetyl production is only going to result from dropping if 
it is done with aeration, just shaking the yeast into suspension won't 
do it.


>BTW, rousing yeast doesn't imply aeration. The yeast just needs to get back
>in suspension to finish its job.


Absolutely true, but sometimes resuspension is not enough.  I have a highly 
flocculent yeast that I am struggling with that does not respond to 
traditional rousing (resuspension).  I suspect that it was developed as 
an open fermenter strain.  I've used it on two batches with identical 
results, it stops about 2/3 through the fermentation.  This was with 
similar OGs but different base malts.  I'm going to give it one more try 
later this summer and try dropping.  Hopefully the additional oxygen at 
about the 1/3-1/2 point will give it the jolt it seems to need.  I 
restarted the stuck fermentations in the previous 2 batches by pitching 
Wyeast 1338 (European Ale).


The question may occur to some, "Why bother?  Why not just switch yeasts?"
Other than it is a matter of pride not to be outdone by a non-sentient 
organism (if was the Bow-Tie yeast I might concede), this yeast has a  
honey-floral character that is wonderful.  The batch from hell (6 week,
4 stage stuck fermentation--it sat in the center of the kitchen for over a 
month yielding innumerable late night stubbed toes) produced one of my
best ESBs ever.

Subject: Acid washing yeast




While washing a batch of yeast today I had a thought.  I'm not sure that
it is original or if I am remembering something previously posted in the
HBD.  Yeast is acid washed in a pH 2.5 solution.  Many acids could be used,
like, phosphoric, hydrochloric, sulphuric, or nitric, just about any 
non-toxic acid.  Generally these are mineral acids, but then I thought of
acetic acid, i.e., vinegar.  So I went to the cupboard and grabbed the
ubiquitous bottle of white vinegar (Heinz) and stuck a pH test strip in it 
and guess what?  pH damn close to 2.5.  


Can someone with a pH meter dunk your probe in white vinegar and either
post or email me the results?  Please include the brandname in the 
message.  My guess is that a particular brand of vinegar is going to be 
pretty consistent for pH over different manufactured batches.  As long
as the pH is 2.5 or less it an be used as is or diluted, so we might be
able to come up with a standard recipe for an acid wash solution that
you could mix in your kitchen without pH test strips or a pH meter.


Also if someone knows why you shouldn't use vinegar to wash yeast please 
let me know that too.

Subject: sparge times


In the last few digests Jim Busch has stated some very firm opinons re:
sparging and lautering.  I have a lot of respect for Jim's experience and
knowledge but in this case  he contradicts what I've seen with my own eyes.
 Somewhere (BT,HBD, his Vienna-Marzen book) George Fix wrote that shorter
sparges make for rounder more malty and bigger beers. 
After reading this I redesigned my converted 1/2 barrel mash-lauter tun and
now I routinely get a 25 to 30 min. sparge with 20 - 25 # of grain.  I always
get 34+ points to the pound and my beer has greatly improved. This method
seems to add a complexity to the malt flavor of the finished beer that it
lacked before. I don't think any off flavors have been introduced and one of
the first beers I made with this set up won a ribbon( a lovely bock-thank you
D. Richman).  All I can say is it works for me. YMMV


Also, re: Kirk's bowtie effect-
Since getting my hand on a couple more Sankey kegs the issue of open
fermentation keeps growing and somewhat nagging me from what seemed to be my
subconscious mind.  Could Kirk's fermenter be doing this to me?  Captain
please shield that thing with lead( or mercury) to protect your fellow
brewers.

Cow manure and Miracle Grow have too quick a release for hop plants, cow
manure might even burn the roots.  A slow long-term release fertilizer like
bone meal is a better choice and bone meal gives a near perfect nutrient
mix for those rhizomes.  Just wish I could keep my dog from digging
under the fence to get at the bone meal every time I put some down!  My
dog is a nut though, he actually likes and will roll in dog repellant.

Subject:       food grade VS brew grade extracts


I recently posted a question concerning a stuck fermentation from a
DME recipie in which I "fixed" it with amylase enzyme (Thanks to all
who responded to my questions).  I went back to the brew store
yesterday (Sat) to buy another recipie and asked them if my stuck
fermentation might be a result of an under modified/converted batch
of DME. (BTW, they sell only Munton & Fison in DME, and have stopped
selling the dreaded Laaglander.  Too many complaints.)  He responded 
that these companies often produce two grades of DME, food grade (for 
cooking) and brew grade.  The food grade has a much higher degree of 
unfermentables and occassionaly, when switching from one type to the 
other, some of the food grade DME *may* get mixed in with the brew 
grade.  Just thought this might be of general interest for the 
food/brew grade thread.  One more reason to go all-grain.......


While I'm here, I would like to ask all the RIMS users out there
what type of pump they are using and how they like it.  I have a
bunch of pump catalogs, but there are no prices and too many to
choose from.  If you could provide prices, make/model, and pumping
rate, it would greatly shorten my research time and efforts.  Also,
do I need one FDA approved, or just made out of food grade
materials.  Thanks much!

Subject: dropping and enzymes


On dropping beer:


Dropping beer will only increase diacetyl levels if you
aerate during the procedure. The Wyeast ESB is famous
for producing diacetyl anyway, so Bob's high diacetyl levels
are more likely due to the yeast choice rather than the dropping
technique (Bob - you imply you had minimal aeration in your
dropping). I have used ESB many times, and have also tried
dropping (with and without aeration) a few times, so am not just
spouting bull**** off the top of my head.


It's primary function (as I see it) is similar to that of skimming krausen.
The idea is to pull the beer from underneath the foam, before the 
head (and associated gunk) sinks back into the beer. Thus break
material etc. stays behind.


I fail to see how this would aid fermentation (except if you aerate or
deliberately stir up the yeast cake) as you leave half the yeast behind 
too. I am not about to try this technique with a high gravity beer for example.
***************
On enzymes and stuck ferments.
I have added beta-amylase on 3 separate occassions recently.


Case A:
Orval clone. Wyeast white 3944 yeast.
 OG=1.062. FG=1.020. I could not reactivate the Orval dregs
from the samples available to me here (which I believe would help the
attenuation). Orval is quite dry, and my beer had a lot of body and 
residual sweetness. So I added enzymes to try and reduce the gravity.
Result: FG =1.000!
The beer tastes like rocket fuel. My beer is ruined. It is destined for
the drain.


Case B:
Strong English bitter. ESB yeast.
This beer was dropped with aeration. It started at 1.058 and stopped
at 1.022. It was too sweet. I added enzymes. 
Result: FG=1.009
The beer is OK (massive diacetyl) but is very sweet. I find it drinkable
only if I mix it with another (drier) beer. I recently posted that every sweet
beer I have ever tried had a high FG. This beer has proven me wrong.


Case C:
Tripel. 3944 yeast.
OG=1.090. FG=1.044
This was a stuck ferment. The enzymes reactivated fermentation. It
currently sits in a carboy. After my other experiments I am not in a hurry
to keg the mother.


Discussion:
High FGs are a result of unfermented sugars (obviously). Yeast can only
ferment monosaccharides. Higher sugars are transported inside the cell
where they are broken down to monosaccharides and converted to alcohol
(and CO2 etc).
Stuck ferments like my tripel happen because the yeast somehow loses its 
ability to transport maltose inside the cell. This is a brewing fault.
High FGs like the others are because the yeast cannot ferment some of the
other more complex sugars. These are desirable to some degree in beer 
anyway.
Enzymes basically convert all extracellular sugars (dextrins and all) to
monosaccharides. Thus the yeast can freely ferment all the available
glucose. When you use an alcohol tolerant yeast such as 3944, it ferments
all of it and gives you rocket fuel. When you use an intolerant yeast such
as ESB, you get a sweet beer, because the yeast cannot ferment all the 
glucose, due to high alcohol levels. Either way your beer is ruined.
I shudder to think what has happened with my tripel!


Conclusion?
You have to be desperate to use enzymes in a fermentation, unless you are
deliberately trying to make a dry style (with lowish OG). They may reduce 
the gravity but at what cost to flavour?
I for one shall never touch them again.

>>What is the technique for removing the tap/valve assembly before I 
get a hole cut in the top?


First, let all the pressure out.  You may want to put a rag over the 
tap ball. before pushing, sometimes when there's beer in there you'll 
get a bath.  Next:
If you look at where the tap goes in you'll notice that there is a ring 
(like a piston ring) that keeps the tap hardware in place.  I use a 
pudy knive to get in there start freeign the ring from under the lip.  
Once you have it started (coming out from the lip) I use a needle nose 
to pull on it - at that point it is easy just pull on it and it will 
all come out (the whole ring) then all you do is twist the tap, you'll 
see the two groves, and pull the tap out.  Done Deal.




>>3. What interesting things should I get welded onto my keg? I 
currently plan to put
        a. A spigot
        b. A thermometer
        c. maybe some handles?
        d. maybe a mesh screen to act as a false bottom?


a. Yes, You'll need a nipple and a spigot (brass works well & brass 
spigots are easy to get at your local hardware store).  If you cannot 
find a brass nipple you can use stainless steel, have your welder braze it.


b.  If you find a mail order setup let me know. I'm still looking.


c. Doesn't your keg already have handles on it?


d. Only needed for the mash keg.


e. When you cut a hole in the top - Here's one to think about.  I 
measured the lid of my boiling kettle and cut the hole just inside that 
one so I had a means of putting a lid on it.  Big helper for keeping 
the temp inside and not steaming off.


>>Any suggestions on how/where to put these items on the keg are also 
welcome by me.


Put the Spigot right down on the lower part of the side if not using a 
screen.  Otherwise you might want to put it on the bottom, but if you 
do that you might not want to hav the nipple brazed.  If your using a 
jet burner it gets hot down there.


>>4. What is the theory behind the liquid-level sight thingy? I guess 
I've never seen one in action, and don't know the details of how they 
work. Is this a cool thing to have on a converted keg?


Don't know I climb up on the stand that the keg is on a look down 
inside.  What a beautiful sight it is.....

I have a 15-gallon (Molson, I think) keg that I'd like to make into a

1. I'll probably go a local welder and try to barter with him: free 
beer for the opportunity to blast apart a keg.  What is the technique

Subject: RE: Harvesting fermenter yeast


What advantages are there to harvesting and re-using the yeast from a prior
batch, besides saving a few bucks? Does it noticeably improve the beer over
using fresh liquid yeast? My impression from the last few posts on the
process is that it seems like an awful lot of work.

Subject: Rooty-Tooty-Fresh-N-Fruity Lambic




I just bought a pair of Lambics from some outfit that calls itself the
Brewery De Troch Wambeek.  They put together some tropical lambics with
strawberry and banana flavors.  The strawberry was just okay; for some
reason it just ended up tasting sour.  It had potential...The banana on the
other hand was very good.  It's no Lindeman's peche of course, but then
what is?  This ale had just the right amount of flavor so that it didn't
overpower the beer.  The banana flavor went surprisingly well with the
tartness of the lambic.  I highly recommend you try it if that particular
action is within your means.


But on to the homebrew question which actually has something to do with
the previous paragraph.  Have any of you used fruit extracts in your lambics?
Or is it better to use fresh stuff?  When is the best time to add the
fruit (or its flavor)?  I've never brewed a lambic but I'm getting real
motivated to do so, and I'd appreciate the feedback from you fine fellows!

Subject: carboy cooler


Being that summers here, I was concerned about the temp. inside my house
which gets into the low 80s.  Not having a cool basement, I searched for and
found a nice plastic Deep Totelocker (Rubbermaid Model #2456) in which (2) 6 1/2
gallon carboys fit nicely.  I can then fill the totelocker with water up to
about the 4 gallon mark w/o the carboys floating away.  The lid can be shut
about half way with it resting atop the airlocks.  Size is 32" X 17" X 17
7/8". Cost about $25 bucks.  Standard disclaimer.

Subject: Solution: *Never* have puffed or bulging 5l kegs again


Okay, so the subject header may be a bit grandiose, but after Chris 
Strickland wrote about puffed out kegs during the warmer weather I 
thought I would offer my solution.


All that is needed is to stick a kitchen (dull) knife between the the top
of the mini keg and the outer lip of the bung.  Push into the center very
hard and excess CO2 will bleed out. It will sound like a compressed air
unit at a gas station.  When you hear the CO2 flow starting to slow down
significantly, remove the knife. I do this once a week or so until I
encounter a time where there doesn't seem to be much excess pressure ( you
will know it when it happens).  After this, I check the pressure every
three or four weeks, if the keg lasts that long. 
 
Initially, one might ask about having the natural CO2 pressure help in the
tapping of the keg, and if you remove this pressure, you will have to use
more CO2 from the tap.  Generally, I find that there will still be some
natural pressure and more importantly, you will tend to have less foam
problems from the onset.  If you have excess pressure, you may use less
CO2 from the cartridges, but it may take a couple of days and many wasted
glasses of foam before you drink your beer.  I can usually have a
drinkable pint on my first tapping of the keg. 


I hope this helps.

Subject: Flakey questions


 Hey all,
 
 Flakes
    I'd like to thank Jacob Galley and Russ (Mast?) for his Brown Rye Ale 
 recipe and ask a question.  His recipe calls for 1.5# of rye flakes; 
 others I've seen calls for 4# rye malt.  My preferred store doesn't carry 
 rye malt but has the flakes assortment (maize, barley, wheat, oats, ect.); 
 what's the difference between malt & flakes?  How are flakes made?  Why 
 would flaked barley, wheat or rye be preferable to malted (as I've seen in 
 recipes)?  What is the malt:flake usage conversion ratio?  I've seen 
 flaked wheat in wit recipes; do flaked adjuncts add to cloudiness more 
 than malt?  Thread-searching garnered usage info: just add flakes to the 
 mash?  Seems that flakes would make the mash thick or gummy; am I correct 
 in assuming that in 10-20% quantities this would not pose a problem?
 
 
 
 A.J.'s Water Works
    A.J. has done an extensive amount of work to provide several methods on 
 achieving the chemical makeup of brewing waters with distilled water.  I 
 hate to ask a dumb question (but am going to), but would it be possible to 
 plug in the brewer's own water figures and achieve the four-salt 
 quantities necessary to approximate the water?  Or are there too many 
 factors to keep track of in non-distilled water?
    Second; the salts and acids added would mimic any mineral taste and 
 content of the water as well?

     1.  Why are plastic buckets unsuitable for secondary?
     
     2.  Is the answer to question #1 serious enough to warrant siphoning 
     (and aerating) the beer twice just to reuse the glass carboy?
     
     I normally use my glass carboy for primary, siphon to the plastic 
     bucket for secondary.  At bottling time, I put the priming sugar 
     solution in the glass carboy and siphon back to it for bottling.  I 
     haven't noticed any problems with this, but I am always on the lookout 
     for improvements.

To: swschult`at`cbda9.apgea.army.mil


   Here's the Fuller's recipe I've been working on for awhile--I haven't yet
bottled this particular batch, but it tasted great at racking.


      3.3# Munton & Fison extra light extract syrup
      4.5# 2-row malt
      0.5# crystal (40 deg. L)
      1.0# flaked maize
      0.25# dark Belgian candi sugar (275 deg. L)


   1 step infusion, mini-mash `at` 154 deg. F for 70 minutes, or until
conversion.  Mashout `at` 170 deg. F for 20 minutes.  Sparge w/3 gallons water `at`
150 deg. F to collect 4.25 gallons.


      1 oz Bullion pellets (8.5 AAU) 60 mins
      1 oz Bullion pellets (8.5 AAU) 20 mins
      1 oz Goldings flowers (4.5 AAU) 20 mins
      0.75 oz Goldings flowers (4.5 AAU) 10 mins
      0.25 oz goldings flowers dry-hopped in secondary


   You want an O.G. of around 1.052 - 1.054 (this recipe gave me 1.053). 
Bittering hops in Fuller's, from what I've read, are not Bullion but
Challenger, Target, and/or Northdown (which can be tough to find).  Any
high AAU, British hop should get you pretty close as long as you finish
with Goldings.
        
   The flaked maize is a must and needs to be 8-10% of your total grain
bill.  I used the dark Belgian candi sugar to try and get a little closer
to the right amber/orange color (my first try came out too light).


   If you don't want to mash any grains, I'd suggest using another can of
M&F, and a pound of corn sugar instead of the grains.  You could darken the
beer a little by carmelizing some of the extract (leave your kettle on the
burner when you add the extract).


   The yeast you want to use is Wyeast's 1968 (London ale).


Good Luck, 


Chris

Subject: Homebrew Club Outline\Using Hop Teas\Dropping?


I am interested in initiating a local homebrew club - Does anyone have an
outline or notes on how to get started? (i.e., charter, mission statement,
meeting format, etc.)


I recently brewed my first mash\extract beer. It's an old English style ale
with an o.g of 1.072. I underestimated the hop schedule by about 10 (30.9
vs. 40 IBU's which most references suggest). I planned on boiling a .5 ounce
Fuggles plug for 50-60 minutes and adding this at bottling. Even though the
beer has another week to go in the secondary, I went ahead and boiled the
plug for 50 minutes in five cups of water. This yielded 2 cups of an
interesting green, milky elixir. I strained the mixture through a section of
panty hose (new, not used) and placed it in the fridge for use this
Saturday. Will this add the desired bittering units? The AA% was 4.1 and the
target was ~10 IBU. Will this cloud the beer too much, or will it settle
out after two weeks in the bottle? Should I just bag the whole idea and
settle for a slightly sweet ale?


Does anyone have a comprehensive article on dropping that I can give to the
Brewmaster at the local brew pub? Personal email is fine.


One last thing. I've fought doing this for some time.

Subject: Suboptimal Hop Combinations/Flux and Fermenter Flow




1)  Are there certain combinations of hops which, when used in a single
brew, create flavors which are generally accepted as unattractive?
This question applies to both kettle hop combinations and, more
likely, to finish hop combinations.  If there are combos many folks
find disagreeable, have such combos been compiled anywhere?


I'm thinking only of combinations of hops one would find used
in 'like' beers (Fuggles, Northdown, Progress, Target, Bramling
Cross), not combinations of two or more hops that would not normally
or intentially be combined anyway (Saaz-Bullion might be an example).

influenced.  The first batch done in twin fermenters had patterns
aligned in parallel along a line about 10 deg clockwise from the local
meridian, bit a subsequent 2-fermenter batch had non-parallel axes of
symmetry.

Subject: Smokey the Beer




Hi,


I'm thinking about trying the recipe in TNCJOHB for rauchbier using
liquid smoke as one of the ingredients.  Before making the attempt,
I would be interested to hear the opinions of those who have
already tried it.  My major concern is knowing if the amount of
liquid smoke called for in the recipe is okay.


Tia for any comments.

Subject: Filling a Sankey




Up 'till now we've disassembled our Sankey's to sanitize and fill with the
frothy golden nectar.  We would now like to sanitize, leave about 1 gal
of iodophor in the keg, re-assemble, shake, pump out the iodophor,
and finally fill the keg with Product.


If anyone has been able to succesfully re-plumb a coupler to allow the
filling of an assembled Sankey keg, or if anyone knows how it is done,
or if anyone knows why it can't be done, I'd be most appreciative.


Also, I am unable to figure out how a Sankey coupler is built--it never
fails to amaze me when, just as I think I have it's design deduced, I am
amazed (and probably soaked with beer) at my ignorance.  If anyone
has  a sectional diagram I'd sure like to get a copy.

I just made one out of 1/4" rigid copper tubing.  The key is what to
use as a swivel. I used a SS fitting which is a 1/4" female flare by
3/8" hose barb.  Ground down the hose barb part and soldered it into
the "T" which is at the center of the rotating arm.  The water inlet
"down tube" is made from 1/2" rigid copper and on the end of that is a
1/2" sweat female to 1/8" NPT female fitting, and then screwed into
the 1/8" FNPT is an 1/8" MNPT to 1/4" male flare.   The end of the
1/4" male flare has been ground off so that when screwed into the SS
female flare, the nut will botton out before the flare engages,
thereby leaving the barb to act as a swivel.

Subject: Grain Bag in Lauter Tun?


Hi all,


I currently use a "Zapap" lauter tun (one bucket with lots of small holes
drilled in the bottom placed inside another bucket).  I am concerned with
the volume contained beneath the false bottom.  It is close to a gallon!


Consequently, I am considering modifying my lauter tun to elimate this free
space.  The easiest mod would be to replace the inner bucket with a grain
bag.  I have heard reports of problems with channeling using this method.
Does anyone have any direct experience ?


The next easiest solution would probably be to build an "EasyMasher" type
thing (a rolled up piece of SS screen crimped at one end and attached to a
short piece of copper tubbing at the other).


Any one have any comments about the relative merits and disadvantages of
either system?




TIA,


 -Troy

Subject: Hop Utilization at High Altitude


     Hello all!
     
     Whilst brewing this weekend, (and planning to move operations up the 
     hill, literally) I tried to reason out how to adjust recipes (or if I 
     even need to) to counter the effects of altitude, ie, lower boiling 
     temperature and therefore(?) lower hop utilization and/or 
     isomerization. Does anyone out there have any words of wisdom or tips?
     
     Thanks,
     Luke

I had a couple of my Friess-compatible mini-kegs do this to me.  I just 
GENTLY pushed down the center plug until I could hear a faint hiss until 
the thing looked like it wasn't going to explode on me.


However, I would be interested to hear the results of the hammering.... ;-0
