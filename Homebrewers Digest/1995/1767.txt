market.  The people that sold it to me could not identify the varity,  its
the only one I could find and wanted to get it established for next year.
They did tell me that it was hybridized about five years ago at washington
state university.  What variety could I possibly have.  I could not identify
by taste as I am a relitively newbie at brewing.  Second set of questions.
I've been reading all the posts on kegging.  And have seen five litter mini
kegs, pigs, and of course kegs of various types.  What is the best setup for
a beginer, cost is a factor?  I would eventially like to force carbonate
(maybe).  What would be a resonable price for any of these setups?  What are
there advantages and disadvantages?  I brew one or two five gallon batches a
month.  And these last me until the next is finished.  Thats all I can think
of if you need more info ask.

A freezer with a new thermostat would work just fine, but my concern is
with the fact that it is an upright.  You see, all of the upright freezers
that I have seen had cooling coils build right into the shelves and they
were not adjustable.  If the shelves are far enough apart and strong
enough for your application, go ahead.  There was a fellow on the HBD a
few years ago who was planning on bending the shelves of an upright 
freezer.  I don't recall if he ever posted on his results or if he went
ahead with the plan at all.  You might check the archives for this thread.


I have a chest freezer and I'm really happy with it.  It can fit an awful
lot of cornelius kegs as well as a lot of cases and/or commercial kegs.
You cannot conveniently add a faucet to the door (which looks cool) but
I chose to not do this since I was concerned about mould in the faucet
between uses.

The answer to your question is: yes.  Swapping light for dark crystal will
reduce the amount of acidity you add via the grain.  I once did some
small-scale experiments with pH and grains and even the light crystals
lowered the pH considerably.


MORE IMPORTANTLY, I'd like comment on your statement: "in hard water
situations."  Please, let us not equate "hard" water with "carbonate" water
or even worse "bad for brewing" water.  Hardness (for the most part) is a
measure of Calcium and/or Magnesium in the water.  There are two types of
hardness: permanent and temporary.  Permanent hardness depends (mostly) on
how much Sulphate is in the water because both Calcium Sulphate and
Magnesium Sulphate are quite soluble.  Temporary hardness is primarily a
measure of how much Carbonate/Bicarbonate you have in your water.  When
you boil your water, if you have enough Calcium in the water and not too
much Magnesium, you will precipitate a significant portion of the Calcium
and Carbonate/Bicarbonate as Calcium Carbonate.  "Hard water," if not very
high in carbonate, is quite *good* for brewing, actually, if you are trying
to brew Pale Ales and not Pilsners.  So, to make a short story long, I
think what Art was trying to say was "in high-carbonate water situations..."

An integral part of fruit "flavour" is sugar.  Many people who try to brew
fruit beers are disappointed initially since they expect a fruit flavour
when they actually get mostly fruit aroma.  I hadn't thought about this
until Russ posted his suggestion.  Consider this: fresh raspberries and fresh
black cherries both have quite intense flavours, but when you add them
to beer, 8 pounds of black cherries in a beer can be not enough, but 8
pounds of raspberries (in a subtile beer) can be too much.  Why?  Because
raspberries have so much more *aroma* than black cherries.  I think that
you should not be *tasting* the raspberries (for example) versus the cactus
fruit but rather smelling purees.  If the cactus fruit is quite aromatic,
you might not need very much at all.

Subject: Gordon Biersch, Diacetyl, etc.


Fellow homebrewers,
    For those of you going to the Bay Area anytime soon, I thought I
would post a brief review of the Gordon Biersch brewpub in San Jose
(very brief, seeing this is not the Brewpub Review Digest).  The place
is very nice, clean, open, but expensive in regards to food.  The food
is good to very good, but overpriced.  The beer is good and inexpensive.
I tried all four on tap, and here's a short review:
Export: A light, not all that flavorful interpretation of a German
pilsner.  Not something to seek out.
Marzen: Better, but not rich enough or malty enough for my taste.  Too
many hops in my view for the Oktoberfest/Marzen style, but a good beer.
Dunkles: Very good, rich, malty, more hoppy than most other dunkles
I've had.
Hefeweizen: This was my favorite; very fruity, lots of phenolics and
fruity esters.  Great, unfiltered beer.  Worth travelling miles for.


Anyway, enough of that.  One thing I thought about while I was there,
though, was why all of their beers are German lagers, excluding the
weizen.  Most brewpubs, micros, and homebrewers brew ales, and I was
just curious as to this discrepancy.  This might be topic for further
discussion on the Digest if people are interested.


Finally, I'd like to solicit opinions from everyone about a good ale
yeast that will give me a firm but not overpowering diacetyl flavor.
I'm brewing up a big ESB or maybe its an IPA, but I'd like to produce
that great diacetyl one finds in a Fuller's or some such british ale.
Any good extract recipes or suggestions would be greatly appreciated
also.  TIA,

Subject: A weeks of beers -- Part I


The past week I vacationed in the Philadelphia area and attended 4 brew pubs,
Dock Street Brewing Company and Samual Adams Brew House in Philadelphia,
Valley Forge Brewery, and Lancaster Malt Brewing Company.


While all four were very good, two stood out as having excellent beer and
food.  These being Dock Street Brewing Company and my favorite Lancaster Malt
Brewing Company.




Dock Street Brewing Company
2 Logan Square, Philadelphia, PA  19103


This brewery in downtown and offers both some very tasty food and equally 
great beers.  Their list included 10 beers 4 of which there were not serving
(Cream Ale, Schwartzbier, Brown Ale, and a Belgian White) which was really
unfortunate since the Schwartz and Belgian are something you rarely find
in a brewpub.


 **Bohemian Pils
      This beer has a slight fruitiness and a nice hop bitterness that
      quickly mingles with a pleasant hop flavor.  This beer was my
      favorite of Dock Street's selection.


   Dortmunder
      Malty and bitter.  This is somewhat higher in alcohol and not as hoppy
      in flavor as the pils. but is more bitter.


   Irish Red Ale
      A nice roasted and toasted grain flavor.  Low to medium bitterness
      that finishes dry but not hoppy and slightly fruity.


  *Porter
      A nice roasted grain flavor.  I detected some black patent which gives
      it the nice coffee flavor and aroma.  Very dark in color.  This beer
      was my second favorite.
      
   Dunkelweizen
      Not quite as dark and malty as I expected but it does have the malt
      smoothness of a wheat.  Not very bitter, which is good, and not as
      alcoholic as I would expect from a Dunkel.


  *Tripel
      A very nice caramel taste and has the light maltiness of a Belgian.
      High in alcohol content but not as carbonated as it should be.  I
      also picked up a slight sulphur taste.  It also is a bit on the
      bitter side for a Tripel but a very enjoyable beer.






Lancaster Malt Brewing Company
Plum and Walnut Streets, Lancaster PA,  17602


This place was a pearl, literally. I found a pearl in my seafood linguini!!
Excellent food only surpassed by their fantastic beers.


I had the chance to talk with the brewmaster as he was racking off the
Red Rose Amber to the fermenter.  He has had 12 years of homebrewing
experience and for a brewery only been open for 3 months, he's making some
great beers.  A *must* visit whenever you're in Amish country.


   Golden Lager
      Slightly malty sweet and not as hoppy as a pils.  Finishes a little
      dry with a subtle malty taste.  Clean and crisp, very enjoyable.


   Wheat
      Served with a lemon so it was somewhat tart.  Not a hoppy as an
      American but also not with the clove spiciness.  Seems to be
      more of a light American or possibly a Weise.  A nice bread-like
      smoothness characteristic of a wheat.


   Brown Ale
      Nice malt character with a hoppy bitterness.  Very smooth but not
      quite enough chocolate malt.  Finishes a bit dry but sweet and
      balanced.


 **Red Rose Amber
      Nice toasted grain bitterness.  Smooth and slightly dry but
      balanced with the hop.  A little on the bitter side but the hop
      flavor is well emphasized.


  *Porter
      A nice roasted grain taste, smooth and almost a sweet stout
      character.  Excellent head retention and mouth feel.  Finishes a
      bit dry but doesn't lose the malt flavor.




Valley Forge Brewing Company
Gateway Shopping Center, Valley Forge, PA


This place only opened 4 weeks prior to my visit and was packed well after
the dinner hour.  Seemed to more of yuppy hangout which needs to work out
some kinks in both their service and brews.


   Kings Gold
      Somewhat sweet but more from honey than malted grains.  Finishes a
      bit dry bit, not bitter or hoppy.


   Red Coat Ale
      Light red/orange in color from toasted grains.  Low to medium
      bitterness which finishes dry.  Has a nice hop aroma and flavor.


   Regiment Pale
      Finishes slightly dry and clean.  Not a lot of malt character.  A
      slight roasted grain taste which is what gives it a redish hue.
      A slight caramel malt sweetness is also apparent.


   George's Porter
      A roasted coffee-like flavor.  Also a caramelized sweetness probably
      from crystal malts.  Finishes dry with a lingering sweetness and
      has a complex malt character.


   Wheat
      More of an American wheat except not quite hoppy enough.  Probably
      40% wheat malt, low hop bitterness and doesn't use a wheat yeast.
      Finishes with a bready taste and a tad bit sweet.


  *Raspberry Wheat
     Raspberries and Strawberries are abundant in this part of the country
     and are in prime condition right now as apparent from this beer.  A
     strong raspberry presence and slight reddish hue which seems to
     otherwise be the same recipe as their regular wheat.




Samual Adams Brew House
1516 Samson St., Philadelphia, PA  19102


Interesting Samual Adams Brew House had Boston Brewery's Sam Adams logo on
there front door.  I don't know if there are in any way affiliated but if
there are not I'm sure Jim Koch has something to say about it.


   Ben Franklin's Gold
      A hint of hop up front but more malty than bitter (both are subdued).
      Fruity but almost has a lager crispness.  Very enjoyable.


   Poor Richard's Amber
      Malty and caramelized sweetness.  Low hop bitterness but it has a
      hoppy flavor that finishes a bit dry.  Has a lingering hoppy
      aftertaste.


   George Washinton's Porter
      This has a nice sweetness up front.  A touch of roasted grain and
      honey.  Complex character which reminds me of a true English-style
      ale in the sweetness.


  *Samsom Street Stout
      This is hand-pulled and unfiltered.  A very nice mouth feel with a
      coffee/roasted character.  Low bitterness and complex malt flavors
      makes this an enjoyable beer.


   Triple Bock
      Mmmm nice heavy caramel sweetness (I'm guessing a finishing gravity
      in the .025-.030 range) and alcoholic.  Somewhat English-ale like
      in the use of complex sugars but does have a hint of sulphur in the
      finish.  This beer is claimed to be 1 year old and will definitely
      improve with age.

Subject: A weeks of beers -- Part II


To top of a great vacation in Phideldia (see part 1), the weekend I returned
the 6th annual Colorado Brewer's Festival was held in Fort Collins.  This
festival is one of the oldest in the state, second only to the GABF.


This year 47 Colorado brewers brought out their finest for a weekend in the
sun, good food, and live bands.


I focused my attention on Colorado's newest micro's (it seems we get a new
one about once a month) and new beers of old favorite breweries.




Bristol Brewing Company
4740 Forge Road, Suite 108, Colorado Springs, CO  80907


   Laughing Lab Scottish Ale
      Malty and somewhat bitter.  Finishes dry and has a slight peated
      malt taste.  Slightly roasty and a little sweet up front but quickly
      turns bitter.




Coophouse Brewery
2400 Industrial Lane #350, Broomfield, CO  80020


   Bent Lager
      Lightly hopped and low bitterness.  Has a nice crystal malt sweetness
      up front and finishes malty/bitter.  Very refreshing for a heavier
      lager (not a pils).




Dimmer's Brew Pub
742 No. College Ave., Fort Collins, CO  80524


   Ali-Rae's Ale
      Nice malt sweetness up front followed by a low bitterness.  Feels light
      in body.  Finishes dry with no aftertaste.




Eldorado Canyon Brewing Company
6901 W. 117th Ave. Suite #6, Broomfield, CO  80020


   Garth's Tail Waggin' Wheat
      Has a nice clove sweetness but it's a bit too malty for a German-style
      wheat.  Possibly a bit too bitter in the flavor.  This beer tastes
      very much like some of my own wheat recipes that use less 50% wheat
      malt.




Estes Park Brewery
470 Prospect Village Dr., Estes Park, CO  80517


   Long's Peak Raspberry Wheat
      A low to medium raspberry fruitiness in an gently American wheat.  A
      nice fruit foretaste that leaves a gentle raspberry aftertaste.  After
      having the Raspberry Wheat from Valley Forge Brewing Company this
      just doesn't compare.




Il Vicino
136 E. 2nd St., Salida, CO  81201


   Wet Mountain India Pale Ale
      Bitter but malty.  Finishes dry/bitter and leaves a nice hoppy
      aftertaste.  Not quite alcoholic enough for the style but a nice
      IPA.




Mark's Brewing Company
225 Bunyan Ave. #B, Berthoud, CO  80513


  *Amber Waves Ale
      Malty sweet and finishes clean.  The honey adds to the overall sweet
      flavor.  This is a very nice, quaffable ale.




Namaqua Brewing Company LLC
128 E. 4th St., Loveland, CO  80537


   Darn Thirsty Cowboy Ale
      Malty sweet up front and a low to medium bitterness.  Finishes a
      bit dry and clean.  The gentleness of noble hops is evident.




Sharkey's Brewing Company
3231 Chelton Circle, Colorado Springs, CO  80909


  *Dark Wheat Bock
      A nice peated malt sweetness.  The malt hits you first in the nose.
      A very complex finish, a little dry and linger with the malt.  My

Dortmund 2X


You were expecting Dortmund 1 here but Dortmund 1 has problems
(one of which is I left the disk with the writeup at the office).


Before tackling them I'd like to clarify  something Al Korzonis pointed
out. In the phrase "water which is ion free (distilled, ion exchanged, or
treated by reverse osmosis)" ion exchange does not refer to the typical
home softener installation but to the more elaborate systems which produce
ion free water. Home ion exchangers swap out cations and replace them with
sodium. Anions are not usually touched. In the lab systems cations are
replaced with hydronium and cations with hydroxyl.


Let's start by listing four profiles for Dortmund, two of which are in
our reference list.


   Dortmund 1  Dortmund 2
     Noonan     Papazian    Hardwick   DeClerk
Ca     225        250         237        262
Mg      40         25          26         36
Na      60         70          65          -
CO3    180        550         174          -
SO4    120        280         120        280
Cl      60        100          53        107


All the calcium levels specified are within 8% of 243.5 ppm. The magnesium
varies a little more (i.e +26%, -21%) about its mean value of 31.7 ppm.
Sodium is not given by DeClerk but has an average value of 65 ppm with
the other two values being within 8% of that. Carbonate is the worst with
the largest specified value being a little over three times the smallest!
The two largest values for sulfate are the same and are more than twice the
smallest (which are also the same. The average for chlorine is 80 ppm and
the range of values is from +/- 34% relative to that value.


Thus we have great disparity in what constitutes Dortmund water with
the big discrepancy being in the carbonate. If I'm going to do a Dortmunder
should I go for the modest or monstrous carbonate level? Ordinarily we
would simply give formulations for Dortmund 1 and Dortmund 2 and let you
chose. But Dortmund 1 cannot be synthesized with the salts and acids that we
are using. This is demonstrated by adding up the total milliequivalents of
anions (Ca,Mg,Na) and comparing to the total of the mEq of the cations
(CO3, SO4, Cl). For cations the spec calls for 17.1 mEq/L and for
only 10.2 mEq/L of anions. For the water to be electrically neutral
anion  and cation mEq must be equal. This is, if you like, an additional
constraint on our formulations. It is equally well a constraint on actual
Dortmund water and what this means is that either the anions in the profile
are unrealistically low or there is another anion (or anions) which don't
appear in the profile. We can only approximate the profile as it is given
by augmenting it with additional anions and this is the approach we take
in dealing with  Dortmund 1 (which I'll post tomorrow).




In Dortmund 2 just the reverse is the case. There are more anions specified,
26.97, (dominated by the carbonate) than cations, 20.62, but the ratio is
smaller (1.3 as opposed to 1.7 for Dortmund 1) and we can synthesize a
reasonable approximation at pH 6.38 with external acid and we will
post the formulation in a day or so.


We are not very happy with either Dortmund 1 or Dortmund 2. The ion
imbalances mean that we don't have good or sufficient information. The
carbonate in Dortmund 1 seems unrealistically low and that for Dortmund
2 unreasonably high.The goal of this series is to try to give you
something you can use for each city so we suggest the comprimise Dortmund
synthesis of Formulation I.

Formulation I is based on the Dortmund 2 profile but what we have done is
weighted the error in calcium at 5 times the error in each of the other
ions. What this means is that the salt selection is largely dominated
by the need to get the calcium correct. Fortuitously the cost of this
is all born in the carbonate which comes in at 234 ppm which is about
twice the Dortmund 1 level and a bit less than half the Dortmund 2 level
i.e. at a level which seems reasonable.


We suggest that this formulation be used for Dortmunder style beers. Note
that it is quite accurate for all ions except carbonate and it is implemented
with common salts. Exteranl acid is required.

Subject: hop plugs


I have a little more data on this There are at least 2 plug manufacturers in
 the UK.(and none in the US)They are made for dry-hopping cask- conditioned
ales.In my training in a Burton- on Trent - brewery in the 1970's ,leaf
Goldings were added to each cask, by hand after racking , just before the
bung was put in.This took 3 people!One to carry the hops,one to carry the
funnel, and one to carry the stick to poke the hops through the funnel(5 ozs
per barrel).When pelleted hops arrived the good ale brewers swore the aroma
of the pellets was not good enough, but the accountants wanted the reduced
cost of pellets.A compromise was the hop" plug", less crushed so better aroma
than pellets ,but not loose like leaf hops ,so storage and handling were
easier.Now the man who  bangs the bung into the cask also can add 10 plugs
 for dry hop.Hence the plugs are very good English aroma hops,good enough to
be used by  UK real ale brewers !The US- type hops in plug form are a new
generation of pellet types,  taken from US to UK, turned into plugs and
shipped back to US .The quality varies!In the US ,unless you buy your hops in
at least 5 kilo bales, sealed under vacuum, and keep them frozen, plugs are
better than anything else you  can buy. They are not as good as the best
fresh  East Kent Golding s leaf hops you get in Kent,but what is!

If they are the same as the Sankeys here (which I am sure they

valve. I'll let Wayde explain:

In fact mine has a hard plastic ball and a small piece of wire 
that stops it coming out, but they are easily removed.  


You'll have to replace the ball again when you want to dispense 
unless you get two tapping thingamies, and have one dedicated to

Subject: BOWTIE /KIRK/MAGNETIC/"X"Files-HBD  #1757


I pray to the god Bacchus that there are some scientists out there!
How can the "Bowtie Effect" be magnetic?! 
I hope your brews are non-ferrous?


Imagine the earth cut in half along the equator, I  call this the "equatorial 
plane of rotation". As an air mass moves away from the equator parrallel to the 
horizon it is skewed by a slightly slower plane of rotation. This is because 
the adjacent circumference is smaller than the equator and the effect is like 
stepping from one moving walkway to another moving at a different speed. Thus 
Cyclones(southern hemisphere) and Tornados (northern hemisphere) rotate in 
different directions, as do bathtub whirlpools.


The effect is always at right angles to the "equatorial plane of rotation", but 
as you move to say, the Tropic of Cancer, you horizon is at 45 degrees to this 
plane.  Thus as your CO2 bubbles move up, they move away from the equator and 
are skewed  parallel to the equator. The convection then settles into a 
cylinder on a North- South axis, or near it as the velocity of the bubbles is 
part of the vector. The more vigousous the fermentation, the further from true 
geographic North would be the axis of the Bowtie. True North varies from 
magnetic North by up to +or - 10 degrees in different parts of the world.


But you are fermenting with a horizontal axis of rotation in a vertically 
circular fermenter. Our computor model (Bernouli's Theorem) suggests that for a 
fairly flat fermenter, (side=diameter) the convection is fastest and tightest 
at the centre,  and slowest and broardest near the curved surface touching your 
cylinder of convection. This then becomes two cones, joined at the apex.


 On a two dimensional surface this looks like a Bowtie!


I enclose my original posting on the subject.


"The truth is out there somewhere", (Apologies to agent Mulder)


 From HBD # 1759 
I think Capt Kirk Fleming with the "bowtie effect fermenter" lives a long way 
from the equator. The Coriolis forces that govern the direction of tornados in 
the northern hemisphere and cyclones in our hemisphere, and also affect bathtub 
whirlpools, are caused by the spining of the earth at its different 
circumfrences of rotation and are greatest farthest from the equator. 


Forget the math, it works vetically as well as horizontally, thus affecting the 
convection currents started by rising CO2 bubbles. That is why I think the 
stone crock behaved as it did, always convecting in one direction. The flat 
bottom vessel's geometry seems to have set up two conical convection shapes 
which you see as triangles on two dimensional surfaces(The bottom and the top) 
 . 


The convection travels at different speeds and as it slows down at the bottom, 
deposits trub like a commercial whirlpool tank, thus the different composition 
of your residue. The convection is always the same direction relative to the 
equator,(It would be a North- South bowtie axis, I think) which explains the 
compass like movement of the bowtie when the vessel was moved.


I promise you it won't affect the beer, if it really bothers you move your 
fermenter to Ecuador, South America, no Coriolis there!

In HBD #1766 Mike Sinelli discussed how he
created a carboy cooler.  Here in Phoenix the
temperature in my house average about 
80 degrees F, so eventually the water in the
Totelocker would equalize into the 80 degree
range.  I was successful in keeping a lower
temperature on my brew by:


  1) Filling a Deep Tote with water
  2) Setting up a fan to blow on the carboy
     and the water. 
  3) Cycling 2L bottles of Ice in the water
     until primary fermentation was complete.


Once the vigorous primary fermentation was
complete I found that I did not have to cycle
the 2L bottles.  The average temperature
seemed to be about 10 degrees less than the
room temperature.

I can only think of one reason.  As you know, yeast is a fungus that converts 
sugar to alcohol.  Well, there's another bacteria (can't remember it's name) 
that converts alcohol to acetic acid (vinegar). Some of that bacteria may be 
present in *your* vinegar. It's possible that the vinegar has been pasturized 
and the process, I believe, is an aerobic process but just the same, why 
tempt fate? BTW, Wine has a low pH too.

I've been using a grain bag in a bucket with a spigot for about 6 batches now.
I have tried both slow sparging and batch sparging methods with mixed results.
I now use the following procedure:
  
Pour the mash carefully into the grain bag. Drain as much of the first runnings
as possible, recirculating when necessary. Add 80? sparge water to cover the
grain and stir carefully. Allow to stand about 10 min. Drain slowly while
adding 80? water to the top of the grain bed. I sparge in about 40 min using
this method and get about 30-35 pt/lb gal depending on how patient I am. The
grain bag must fit snugly in the bucket when full to avoid channeling between
the bag and the wall of the bucket.
  
I like this method. It's easy, and I never have stuck sparges or clogged
manifods. Extraction efficiency is not my primary concern. I'm limited to about
18 lb of grain, but that's enough for a 25 liter batch of trappist ale :-)
  
On another note, I have a question about beer oxidation.
  
>From what I can get out of HBD discussions, HSA leads to carboard flavors.
What about oxidation of the finished beer? Is this a problem in homebrewing and
what are the effects?
I read a review article recently from an American Chemical Society Symposium on
the science of brewing and winemaking. According to this reference and others
cited in the article, yeast is an excellent oxygen scavenger. According to the
paper, certain types of oxygen scavenging caps even use yeast cells embedded in
a polymer. Since bottle conditioned beers contain more than a little yeast, I
suspect that a little aeration of the beer won't be that much of a problem for
most homebrewers. Perhaps someone with more experience could comment.
  
A l0ml of air space in a 1/2 liter bottle translates into about 2.5ppm of O2.
What kind of capacity does the conditioning yeast have to remove O2?
