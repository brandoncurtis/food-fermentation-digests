In re Dave Oliver's req for info on the Great British Beer Festival:


Dave,
GBBF is in London at Olympia Hall. District Line (Green line) to Earl's Court
then change to the shuttle which runs every c20min. Olympia is just one stop
up this spur line.
No, it no longer changes cities. It's been at Olympia for several years now.
It's in the Kensington area.
It always starts the first Tuesday in Aug and runs through the following
Saturday. There are two sessions per day, except opening Tuesday when there
is only an evening session c4.30pm.
I'll be attending as a judge, and then working the Batemans stand there for
three days beginning on the Wednesday.
Hope this helps.

OK, so another age-old question/thread about lautering from
        (surprise) an anal retentive brewer (ARB; aren't we all?)...


What is the affect of starting and stopping the flow from the lauter
        tun during the initial recirculation period?


My "technique" has been to stop the slow flow while returning the
        still cloudy sweet wort already collected back the top of 
        the grain bed, and pseudo-clarity seems to take more time
        for me to achieve than for others (all-grain time thread).

Subject: Souring beer?


A question for the HBD collective...
 
I have found a very promising Guiness clone recipe that calls for 24 
oz of soured beer. For the souring process, the instructions simply 
say to pour 24 oz of stout (preferably Guiness) into an open 
container, and leave it out for a week or so before pasteurizing 
it... This soured beer is then tossed into the boiling wort at the 
end of the boil. My question relates to the souring of the beer. I 
have no doubt that leave beer on the counter for a week will spoil 
it, but is there a better way to control the 'type' of souring that 
will occur? Are there some bacterial cultures that can be obtained  
to control this process? 
I'd hate to waste a full batch of stout in addition to two great cans
of Guiness!
Thanks in advance...

Subject:       Blow off soup


Greetings, fellow brewers!


In HBD 1771, Dion Hollenbeck asks what we put in our blow-off 
receptacle to ensure sanitary safety of the brew...


I use water.  Plain and simple. 


The water provides a barrier between the atmosphere and the brew; the 
positive pressure in the tube from an actively fermenting brew does 
the rest.  


Draw-back through the tube isn't a concern as it is the 'jam it in 
the hole' large diameter variety (1" OD? Haven't measured it in a 
while) and would take a hellatious thermal contraction to draw 
anything from the blow-off tank back into the fermenter. 


And in my entire brewing career, I've _never_ had an infection 
attributable to my blow-off method; I use the blow off method 
outlined above exclusive of all others.  (Only had one infection, and 
it was due to a leaky keg fitting.)


HIH!

I've found that the 5 Liter Mini Kegs with a Carbonater and CO2 bottle 
makes the best solution for me.


A Carbonater(no affiliation, about $10) is a special ball lock cap 
that's made to fit on a Pet Soda bottle. As it turns out, the threads 
are an exact match for the Mini Keg Star Tap where the little CO2 
cylinder holder screws on.


With this set up you don't need those $1.25 cartridges at home but can 
use them when you want to transport the Mini Keg and not the CO2 
apparatus. And you can force carbonate the 5L kegs as well as anything 
else using the Pet bottles. 


When I'm not brewing, I'm experimenting with home made sodas with my 
kids. For me,that's the best of both worlds.

Lee asks about dropping dry ice into his hot wort to chill it;


The result will be huge volumes of gas released causing tons of foam,
resulting in the overflow from hell. I tried this for some other cooking
experiment I can't remember when, and it was a surprising and awful mess.


Others will probably point out that all sorts of microorganisms are likely
to be lurking in the dry ice, in suspended animation, and might survive as
the wort cools. Also, dry ice is not cheap.


I'd stick to your counterflow chiller and not worry about the cold break.

I wouldn't have described them as "dumplings", but I did get great huge
grey chunks of what looked kind of like latex a number of years ago with
a wheat beer.  I had done a step-infusion rather than a decoction mash,
and attributed the stuff to this.  I figured they didn't really belong
in the beer, so skimmed them off and chucked them out.  They *felt* like
latex, too, very rubbery.  No problems whatsoever with either clarity or
head retention (great head!).

Subject: copper for kettles


I would like to poll the readership on what kind of
copper to use in kettles and how thick it should be.
Specifically, I'm interested in a 2000 to 4000 liter
system. DeClerk mentions that the bottom of a fire-
heated kettle should be 6-12 mm thick, but he is
specific on other types or areas. Quick stress 
calcs give me a thickness of 0.5 mm (including
a safety factor of 2!). I was thinking about 3 mm
should be right. Anybody know some thickness of
real kettles made of copper?


Question two is what kind of copper? I was thinking
of using oxygen-free copper. Anybody know what is used
for kettles built today? How about in years gone by?
P. Celis made a mysterious remark about his kettles that
he imported for his Austin brewery: I think he said that
new kettles are made out of a different copper that wasn't
as good, or something along those lines.


Hope this reads ok. I'm getting alot of line noise since
the phone guy came out and worked over our lines.


TIA,
Kyle

     I recently made 10 gallons of a Corona clone (no flames please -- it's 
     just a summer thing) that had 3 lbs of flaked maize.  I had globs of 
     stuff all over my immersion chiller just as you describe.  I also lost 
     at least 1/2 gallon more hot break than normal.  I thought that it was 
     just the Irish Moss kicking in better because I finally remembered to 
     rehydrate it :-)  This batch also was determined to boil over -- it 
     kept frothing up to the top of my pot as the boil started and lasted 
     for several minutes!
     
     I've recently seen posts recommending forced carbonation at 40-60 psi. 
      I am just assembling a draft system, and trying to find as much good 
     information as possible.  My fittings are very simple:  3/16" id vinyl 
     tubing over hose barbs with a standard automotive type hose clamp.  
     The person at the shop I bought these at told me not to exceed 25 psi. 
      Do other people have better fittings, or was he just being too 
     conservative?  Why would you need more pressure for seltzer (the 
     original question) than beer?  Am I making this a lot more difficult 
     than it needs to be?  Also, for the people who keep their CO2 tanks 
     outside the fridge:  How do you run the gas-in line into the fridge?  
     If you go through the side (all my coolant lines are in the back), 
     what kind of fittings do you use?  My CO2 tank is bigger than a keg, 
     and I would rather not take up more room than necessary.

I don't use a proper counterflow chiller, but something similar.  (A 
counter-immersion chiller?  It's a big roll of Cu pipe under cold water
in a bathtub or laundry-sink.)  Anyway, I do nothing about cold break at
all, I just keep it.  I have yet to have anyone, myself included, notice
anything off that could be associated with it, and I often ask judges and
friends to taste for it specifically.


Obviously, YMMV.  I will say that I'm convinced that having it form cold
break and leaving it in is better than not having it break out, and leaving
it in solution.  btw, I tend to rack to a secondary after only a week or so.

I've perused the HBD archives in search of Celis White clones and found

to attempt a controlled lactobacillus "infection" (for want of a better term)
to get the sourness, especially in a summer brew session. Some past posts
have mentioned using USP lactic acid in the secondary but are vague on 
the amounts (I don't know how much "to taste" is). Any HBDers have experience
on this?  Also, are there other sources besides the Frozen Wort that carry
bitter orange? I'm unfamiliar with this ingredient. If I could find what 
else it is used for I thought I might be able to find a local source. If 
anyone has an updated all-grain recipe for this beer, that would be

Subject: Plug Lupulin Gland Report


As promised, I examined the lupullin glands from some plugs I brewed with
on the 4th. I examined Northern Brewer, Tettnager and Hallertauer plugs.
I plucked the cones from the boil as soon as they were freed, perhaps in 
the fist 10 seconds or so of being freed from the plug. From visual
examination, the glands appeared to be intact. The glands appeared yellow
and plump with lots of little hairs. Their condition could be compaired to
what I have seen from a whole cone from my hop vines. Hense, from non-
magnified visual inspection, the glands found in a hop plug are not crushed
in processing. A maginfied inspection may have a different result, but 
I would be surprised. This would tend to support the idea that hop plugs
are a quality product and in the least, equal to all other forms of hop
packaging.

Greetings Fellow Travelers & Beer Imbibers!


In April '96 I will be going to New Zealand and Australia for 5-6 
weeks.  I want to take in the grape harvest season by visiting a 
number of working vineyard/ winery operations.  I would also like 
to visit some of the craft breweries as well.  I have visions of 
doing this sort of thing myself here in the metro-Portland (OR) 
region.  I wouldn't mind pitching in and helping out on-site if 
possible.  I do not expect to receive wages for my labor, I just 
would like to get some real-world experience.  I got to attend the 
German Wine Academy several years ago and really enjoyed that.  I 
won't be traveling alone, I expect that my sister and daughter 
will be with me as they are potential principals in a beer/ wine 
venture.  Has anyone got any suggestions on where I should plan 
on visiting to do these things?  Fax numbers to contact them would 
be super too.  


I would also like to stay at some of the "farm-stay" places.  
Has anyone had any experience with this program?


I am also wondering if anyone knows of a forum similar to HBD 
focused on wine, winery and vineyard operations (and how to find 
it)?  What about making the transition to commercial brewing, 
dealing with the regulators [bureaucrats, not hardware <;-) ], 
etc, etc.  Also any place that talks about amateur yogurt and 
cheese making.  


Private e-mail response would be best and if I get say more than 
a half-dozen requests to do so, I will collate the responses and 
post them.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

between batches.  Is this a bad idea?

Subject: When to Pick Hops?


Hi Group,
My Hops are doing really well this year, especially the Cascade. Quite a few
Cones have appeared in the last couple weeks and I am wondering how soon they
will be ready to pick.  I have read that they are ready when they feel more
papery and resiliant and are starting to brown a bit at the edges. 


But, can anyone give me a rough idea of When/ How Long it takes for the cones
to mature? Two Weeks? A Month? Two Months? I am in Southern California, so I
imagine they could be ready a bit faster than up north, but I am not sure.
Thanks, 
John

Subject: Isinglass/Gelatin?




Ok, I have never overly concerned myself with making a "clear
beer".  However, I have a pale ale in primary that I brewed for
a very special occasion, and for once I feel that appearance is
important.  The only half-hearted efforts I made in the past
involved using Polyclar, with mixed results.


Isinglass or Gelatin...what are the pros and cons of them both,
and what is the recommended usage of both?  (not to resurrect 
the boil/don't boil your gelatin thread!)  Do they have overlapping
properties, or does each only work on certain haze proteins/yeasts?
What if one was to use them both?


E-mail me please, and I will summarize for other beginner 
clarity-seeking brewers.

Subject: High FG extracts


Dear Friends, in #1773 Pierre expanded on his use of Laaglander for high FG
in low OG beers.  This is very sound advice--one can make some very
satisfying ales that are not very alcoholic by doing this.  I recall one
stout I made that had an OG of 1035 but an FG of 1017 or so, and it tasted
for all the world as if the OG were fully 10 to 12 points higher.  For me
it's the solution to the dilemma of "Do I drink too much?" at least in terms
of alcohol consumption.  Now, calories are another matter...


Cheers, Dave in Sydney

In response to Bill Watt's question about brass and stainless
steel fittings, please note that you cannot weld brass to stain-
less (or to anything else).  You may be able to braze these metals,
however.  Brazing is a much lower temperature process than weld-
ing; it's sort of very hot soldering (don't use solder - contains
lead).


If you really want SS fittings, try a marine supply store (if
there is one near you).  Most have a good selection of SS fasteners
and plumbing fittings.  For low temperature applications, try less
expensive delrin or nylon.

Subject: Stop the senseless lawn murders!


  ((wavery Star Trek decloak))  It's been quite awhile, eh?  I'm back with 
some more quasi-useful-brewing-related stuff, and a recipe plea!  
Today's topic:


   How can I cool my wort, but not scald a huge patch of my lawn?


   (ping!)  The answer:  rather than dump near-boiling water directly onto the 
lawn, spray it into the air in a fashion not unlike a swimming pool aerator. 
The cheapest/easiest "sprayer" I've found is a short length of copper tubing 
that's been partially crimped at the end.


  Hokay, now that I've "contributed" (yeah, snicker..)  I'll shutup for another 
six months if someone, ANYONE, will provide me with an all-grain or extract 
approximation of Spaten Optimator.  Once more, with feeling:

Subject: Alcohol Removal From Beer


        We have a friend who recently became pregnant, and 
has developed cravings, real or imagined, for beer.  
Obviously for health reasons alcohol is out.
        I am assuming that since fermentation is a 
necessary component of the process, that alcohol-free beer 
is made by removing the alcohol from the beer after 
fermentation.  Can anyone suggest a reliable and practical 
method for a homebrewer to remove the alcohol from beer?
        Further, is there a way for homebrewers to check 
for the presence and/or content of alcohol in beer?  It 
would give me a lot of piece of mind to know that the 
alcohol removal procedure was successful.
        Many thanks for your suggestions....

Subject: Iodophor Toxicity?


        I realize that straight Iodophor is Toxic, but i was wondering if 
a, say 12.5 ppm, solution is toxic?  In other words would it hurt you to 
drink the sanitizing solution?  The reason im asking is that it occured 
to me that Iodine tablets for sanitizing drinking water when hiking are 
much more expensive then Iodophor.  So can you use Iodophor to sanitize 
drinking water?
