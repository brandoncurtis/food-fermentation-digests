I use water, yes, water.  Ideally, boiled (to sanitize) water. Why?
Because if the temperature changes and any liquid gets sucked up into the 
carboy, I'd rather it be water than iodophor or bleach.  Let me ask you
this question: unless you plan to let it sit there for a year, why would
you want to put sanitizer in your blowoff bucket?  Nothing is going to
crawl up the blowoff hose and into the fermenter, so why worry?

Hello fellow control freaks,
    I have recently devised  (stumbled upon) a simple & cheap & easy to
assemble very low parts count circuit.  It is capable of high and low temp
control.  I intend for it to control the temp. in a warm/cold box it also
could be used in a RIMS type setup.  Features programable hysterisis, high
warning, low warning, maybe ten parts (nothing fancy), cost so far under $10,
most parts available at Radio Shack.
   I am not educated nor smart enough to embellish this thing, anybody with
time, inclination and training is invited to take a looksee and offer
suggestions.  So far my plan is to submit the design to the public domain.
 If this thing can be slicked up some I may be willing to build and sell on a
one of basis.
   Anybody interested in developement of this thingy can E-mail me for
details.  I have not got around to schematic yet, but it should be quickly
done.


Brewing Onward,

Well, I am in the believe, attend church and homebrew group.  


Personally I don't see any conflict between these concepts but here in
Knoxville many of my Baptist friends seem to.  None have called in the BATF
yet but some days I wonder if they will.  Some in this east Tennessee area
known for its moonshinning history (you can still get it in the hills around
here) seem to think that making homebrew is like making moonshine. (Maybe it
is in their eyes, just a matter of strength.)  Many of these good Baptists
here continue to kill themselves smoking, to each his own.


I have lots of other friends, at work, etc. whom very gladly will drink up
my homebrew.  


Around a good part rest of the world, and I have spent a lot of time in
Europe and Asia there doesn't seem to be as much conflict between brew and
religion.   We Americans seem to have done this completely to ourselves.


I am of course leaving out some of the major relgions of the world with the
above statement because they are even more restristive than things here in
the South.

     I would like to make a Raspberry Wheat and a Cherry Wheat beer.  I 
     will be useing extract kits and adding hop plugs in the boil.  Maybe 
     even adding .5oz to 1oz hop plugs for dry hopping. 
     
     My question is on the preparation/addition of the fruit.  I have been 
     told that the fruit should be added after the vigorious fermentation 
     has stopped.  Does anyone agree?  Or if you have a alternate 
     suggestion, please let me know. 
     
     How should the fruit be prepared?  I was going to put it in those 
     muslin bags.  Sould I boil the fruit for both the nasties and to 
     soften it up then put the cooled fruit and water into the fermentator? 
     Or give the fruit a ride through the blender (cherry pits removed)?

Subject: CO2 lines and keg systems


Several posters have recently stated how they dont need to have
a CO2 line through the refrige:


<As for getting a CO2 line into the fridge: I find there is no need to do 
<this at all.


I personally like to engineer things to work for me, so I much prefer
to have hard plumbing and fittings where I need em.  I also have a lot
of kegs online at any time and I like to maintain the dispensing 
pressures where I want em.  How to put a line in?  Drill a hole through
the side of the 'frige, its that easy.  Be sure to size the drill bit
to just fit the OD of the CO2 line and force the hose through the hole.
On the inside, split this line into a quick disconnect for counter-pressure
filling, and a 2 or 3 way gang valve for shut off.  Out of the gang
valve, it is nice to have other quick disconnects so I can quickly 
convert from corny kegs to sankey kegs.  I also have a setup like this
on my carbonating frige, line through the side, splits to shutoffs for
carbonating at different atmospheres of pressure.  Out of this I intend
to split a line through to my storage frige through a inline regulator
to reduce pressure for dispense.  This way I can use one 20 lb tank
to carbonate and dispense kegs that dont fit in my normal kegerator.
BTW, my carbonating frige is set to 31F so I can also store yeast in
it.  Its also convienent to have quick disconnects that have a liquid
line on em.  This is useful for purging and filling empty kegs with 
CO2 prior to filling, through the liquid out line.

> Drugs -- there were a few messages a while back on the <snip> drug
> status of alcohol <snip>.


I missed most of those posts since our computer network went down for
almost two weeks (BTW if you responded to my request for info on RIMS
pumps [prices/brands/model#/pumping rates] and your message bounced,
please try again now, thanks).  I would like to voice my opinion that
alcohol IS a drug.  The question is, "So what?"  "Drug" does not
equal "Evil"  I beleive that there are different levels, from "Good"
to "Evil" for drugs, depending on their pro/con ratio to society. 
For example, aspirin has many pros and (practically) no cons, so it
is viewed as very beneficial to society, but crack cocain has a very
low ratio and is thus viewed as very evil.  The problem is what
society views to be the pros and cons VS what they actually are. 
Alcohol has a bad rap in some circles because they perceive cons that
(in our opinion) do not exist and do not see the pros that we beleive
exist.  Similary, I beleive that alcohol and marijuana have very
similar pro/con ratios, yet society as a whole clearly disagrees.


I read an article in a back issue of our brew club library recently 
(can't remember which one).  There was a story about a guy who, after 
prohibition had ended, was employed to improve the image of beer.  He 
did some research on our founding fathers and their brewing/drinking 
habits and then published his findings in such a way as to associate 
drinking beer with patriotism.  Within 6 months, a large number of 
grocery store chains (can't remember the exact amount, but it was 
significant) started selling beer again.  


The point is, there is a large gap between the perceived pro/con
ratio for alcohol and the actual ratio, and that needs to be
changed.  We can do that by simply giving these beer haters a
different image from the beer drunken slobs that they associate
alcohol with.  By simply being good, upstanding citizens and not 
hiding the fact that we brew and enjoy beer (and savor the flavor 
responsibly) I beleive we can slowly change the way some parts of 
society view alcohol.  <OK, I'm stepping down off of my soapbox now>

I don't find too much irony in this, actually.  Admittedly, I have a very
different perspective on the whole thing, but most of the first settlers 
to this country were Calvinistic, and Calvin's influence still pervades much 
of society's attitudes.  (Not the kid with the stuffed tiger, btw.)  It is,
to me, a little surprising that there were fewer admonitions against drinking
in those days.  One of the main reasons beer was brewed was that you couldn't
trust the water.  Today, you can.  (Unless you a John Burker, but we can save 
that for later.)  


A lot of it, IMO, is related to what I call the anti-pleasure principle.  The 
idea that if you're having fun with something, there must be something evil 
about it.  (This is the main reason, IMO, for continued drug prohibition in
this country.  If you want to talk about that, e-mail me privately.)  I often
see homebrewers, especially those from the US midwest, feel like they have to 
defend their craft by assuring themselves and others that they're not just 
doing it to get a buzz, that there's more to it than that.  This defensiveness
arises largely from Calvinist influence, which simply hadn't 'gotten to' beer
by the time this country was founded.


As we're all aware, I'm sure, religion is a hot-button issue, and I want to 
make it clear that I'm not -blaming- anyone for anything.  I'm simply saying
the "tradition" that anti-beer people are following is an intellectual one
rather than a behavioral one.  (That is, their forebears drank beer, yeah, but
had the same kinds of ideas that lead them to eschew beer.)

Again, you and I come from different perspectives.  I have the jaded view that
one can find evidence to support -any- argument in the Bible.  Nonetheless,
I agree that you have to really stretch it to get an anti-beer message.  
Not to knock anyone, but the Calvinist tradition in this country is not a 
Biblically-based tradition.  (Also worth noting, religious people don't have
a monopoly on these ideas, they pervade secular society a good deal.)

Actually, I'm also curious about the religious demographic of homebrewers, 
and how religion influences your appreciation and understanding of beer.
(I want some joker to post something like "Well, being a Lutheran, I love a
good Weizen, but don't care much for Stouts...")


For the record, I'm a "strong" atheist.  I don't believe there is a supreme
being, and I don't believe that the existence of a supreme being is a 
possibility realistic enough to consider.  I'm also a humanist.  I believe 
in doing everything I can to help my fellow human (or humyn?  huperson?  
huperoffspring?) to live a better life.  I think this world is the only one
we get, so I try to make it as nice a place as I can.  Further, I believe 
that this life is the only one I get, so I should make the most of it.  (No,
I refuse to paraphrase a Stroh's ad here.)  Because I could die permanently
at any time, I feel that I should make each moment special if I can, and not
waste my time worrying about past opportunities lost.  And, while I plan for
the future becuase I hope to live there a long time, I don't sacrifice the
present in the name of the future, because the future might just not show up.
(I recognize that many of these beliefs about time, etc. are shared by many
people of different religions, and I don't mean to denigrate them.  I do feel
that atheism is an important part of my belief system and I think that it is
related to my understanding of 'the moment'.)


How does this influence my brewing?  Well, for one, I savor every stage of
the process.  (As do others, of course.)  Each step is special, and the
beer is a good thing all the way.  Obviously, I have the final product in 
mind, but I don't let that overshadow the fun of the process of brewing.  
I'm less patient in this regard than a lot of brewers, I don't feel like 
having an absolutely miserable afternoon, only tempered by the anticipation 
of good things to come.  Of course, some of the more demanding aspects of 
brewing which require patience I really enjoy, so I greet them with glee.
I've had several brewers comment that I stir the beer a lot more than other
brewers, and I think that's related too, but I'm not really sure in what way.
I think when a batch turns out less-than-optimal, it's not a major tragedy as
it can be with others.  Sure, maybe this beer was 2 years in the making, but
it was a -fun- two years, so if it's not the best, that's too bad.  When I
have a good batch, of course I'm elated, and I tend to drink them up pretty
quick.  With the less than terrific batches, I keep them around for a lot 
longer than some other folks, in the hopes that they get better and, well,
I have enough space for a few bottles and I have enough empties I don't have
to rush through them.


Sheesh.  That's long.  I hope this isn't too far off-topic.  I think we're 
adult enough to have a thread involving religion without it degenerating into 
a mudfest.  (Also, let's keep this to the religion-brewing relationship.  If
you want to talk about stuff not related to brewing, I'm all ears, but not on
the HBD.)

  This is covered in an article a few months back in a cool Beer magazine
called All About Beer.  The author gave some history about what used
to be called groaning Beer, which was given to pregnant women during Labor.
He also quoted some studies saying that Beer during pregnancy IN MODERATION
(as usual) is fine.  The general consensus on "IN MODERATION" meant no more 
than one Beer at a sitting.  He also stated that the health of the woman
improves with moderate consumtion, so: Obviously for health reasons alcohol
(IN MODERATION) is IN.


  I have a friend who had similar cravings, and bless her heart, had a Beer
in her fourth month and LOVED it.  I think she had a Simpatico, so it wasn't
high in alcohol (or taste, for that matter).  She had her baby a few months 
ago, and mother and child are doing fine.

It's true that CO2 connections for the typical cornelius keg setup are prone
to leaks but if you wrap ALL threaded connections before assembly with
plumbing teflon tape you will never have any leaks again. I leave my CO2
lines connected and turned on all the time and my CO2 tanks last forever.
Remember that if you ever take apart any connections (for things like
filling jars with hops with CO2 before freezing) that you re-wrap
the threaded connection with fresh teflon tape every time. I lost an entire
tank of CO2 only once (took only a few days and it was 20lbs) because
I was lazy and didn't re-wrap the connector I had taken apart with fresh
teflon tape.

I've used a few of his strains with great success.  There's also another
company called The Yeast Culture Kit Company that has quite of few
interesting strains, although I don't see any lacto bugs listed in their
catalog.  Their address/phone/email is:

Either of these suppliers carry a wider selection of strains than are
currently available in smack packs.
