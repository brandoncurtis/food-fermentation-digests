Subject: Edinburgh 1


Edinburgh 1


This is the eighth in a series of posts on the formulation
of waters similar to those of famous brewing cities of the world. They
are based on ion concentration profiles given by Dave Draper in
his post in #1704 (10 April 95). See my  post "Water Series" (#1763) for
explanatory material (correction: in the Line 3 explanation read 1.8 ml of
1 N sulfuric acid, not 18 ml). Quick reminders: all ion concentrations and
salt quantities are in ppm which is the same as mg/l. The water to
which the salts are added is assumed to be ION FREE (i.e. it is
DISTILLED WATER or REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER).


This profile comes from Westerman and Huige "Fermentation Technology". It
is one of the most difficult profiles we have had to deal with thus far
because it specifies about three times as many mEq of cation as anion.


Noonan, "Scotch Ale" in the chapter on mashing lists a range of  ion
concentrations which approximate Edinburg water: calcium 80 - 120 ppm
(Edinburgh 1 calls for 140); magnesium 10 - 25 ppm (Edinburgh 1 call for 60);
sodium 10 - 30 (here 80); sulfate 70 -140 (here 96);
carbonate 120-200 (here 140) and chloride 30 - 60 (here 34) thus the cations in
this profile all substantially excede Nonnan's recommendations while the anions
are all within his range. This further emphasises the imbalance towards the
cation side.


If, nevertheless, we ask for a pH 7 formulation for the Edinburgh 1 profile
with maximum salts and external acid the result is:

>From this we see that we are shy in all cations while in excess in all
anions. It almost seems abvious from looking at Formulation I that we
could simply add more gypsum but if, for example, we added 10 mg/L more
CaSO4.2H2O the error in calcium would decrease only a little to -47.27%
while the error in sulfate would increase more to 19.33% and the overall
rms % error would increase slightly to 27.867%. Thus, as we would expect
if the algorithm is working correctly, we have the best solution under
the definition of best we have chosen.


In keeping with our recent perception that we can solve difficulties like
this by adjusting the carbonate we set the error weight for crbonate to 0
so that the algorithm looks for a solution without regard to how much or
how little carbonate was used. The result is Formulation II

 Alkalinity:     5.05 mEq;     252.47 ppm as CaCO3.
 No permanent hardness. Temporary hardness:     11.93 mEq;    596.29 ppm as
CaCO3


We note that a full salt complement is required, that the carbonate goes to
almost thrice what was specified and, as might be expected, a lot (7.4 mEq) of
external acid is required to offset the alkalinity of all the carbonate.
Furthermore
hardness of this formulation is almost 600 ppm compared to the maximum of
350 published by Noonan. We would
think that most brewers would not want to have to use so much external acid and
so recommend saturating with CO2 which should bring the pH of this formulation
to 5.96 at which time total carbonates would be at 2755 ppm. Aeration to the
pH's in the following table gives the values of total carbonate and PaCO2
indicated.


            pH         CO3,ppm      PaCO2, mmHg
           6.38         1490          281.5
                   7.00          386.9         28.3
                   7.37          148.6          5.3
                   7.40          136.1          4.5


Thus we are able to obtain close to the desired profile (including carbonate at
about 140 ppm) by synthesis using dissolved CO2 at pH around 7.39. Note
that there
will be minimal precipitation of calcium carbonate to the extent of less than
1 ppm calcium at all the pH's above 6.38. Nevertheless, we do not recommend this
profile. Edinburg 2 is better balanced and is adequately realized with minimum
salts. We will also give  Edinburgh 3, a profile which we took from the mid
range of each of Noonan's numbers and think that it is probably the most
reasonable
to use for Scotch ales.

Subject: Use of Bad Batch


I've been reading about folks purposely making bad beer to create a Guiness 
clone.  Makes me wonder, has anyone tried using beer from a bad batch in a 
new batch to see what flavor it adds.  Just pouring it in during the last 
fifteen minutes of the boil?

Keith Royster sez:


"The point is, there is a large gap between the perceived pro/con

changed."


You're right.  One problem is the BATF has criminalized saying anything about
the pros of alcohol.  Bert Grant tried to put nutrition labeling on his beer
and look where it got him.

Thanks to all of you who have thrown in your two bits on the religion and 
brewing issue (I now have a heap of change).  Please send any other 
messages on this topic to my address and not to the digest out of respect 
for those who want to keep religious discussions private.  I don't want

Also, I am searching (along with Mr. Royster) for a list for discussion

Finally, Blueberry Brew -- I want to make some, have access to a patch of

From: CHARLIE SCANDRETT <merino`at`ozemail.com.au>
Subject: SAFETY-Pressure Vessel Query- T. Tegners HBD #1770


In HBD1770, Terence asked why a copper pressure vessel had a 1mm wall and a 
stainless pressure vessel had a 3mm wall.
Other post has spoken of steam infusion and repairing kegs.
As I've been building a 70 litre test bed for a micro-brewery, Ihave been 
looking things up and talking to boilermakers. 


PRESSURE VESSELS ARE BOMBS-BE CAREFUL


Copper is less than half the tensile strength of steel of any sort. If the 
copper vessel was thinner then it must be rated to a much lower pressure OR it 
had a much smaller diameter.
The weakest segment of a pressure vessel is its circumfrential hoop. The force 
is called "hoop stress" and the formula is
     f=p.D/2.t 
where     f= hoop stress in megapascals (this is limited by the tensile 
strength of the material) , p= pressure in megapascals, D= diameter of cylinder 
in mm, and t= thickness of the wall in mm
The maximum hoop stress allowable in a material for a pressure vessel is 
usually 1/5 the actual tensile strength, this is a five to one safety factor 
because of the danger of explosion and the variability of welds.


example.
For a pressure fermenter rated to a safe working pressure of 50 psi and with a 
350mm diameter and made of stainless steel.
The maximum allowable hoop stress would be about 75 MPa for the steel and 50 
psi =  .345 MPa working pressure. (A meteorology book says Atmospheric pressure 
is .103 MPa or 14.7 psi)
  75= .345 MPa x 350mm/2.t  thus the thickness would be .8  mm of stainless. 
This would be about  2.5mm of copper, thus Terrence's copper 1mm vessel should 
be about 150mm diameter to be safe to 50psi?
 Most beer kegs are about 350mm diameter and 1.5mm thick.


Actually the metric/imperial units can be mixed in this formula so long as 
stress/pressure and diameter/thickness are in the same system of units.


I'm building a clear plastic tube inspection line down the side of my 
fermenters, at this tiny diameter the tensile strength of plastic is more than 
enough for 150 psi !


DANGER
Heating to maleability, or bending sheet steel changes its tensile strength 
(corrosion too), it is not a good idea to buy or repair bent or damaged kegs.
Licenced pressure welders use exacting gas purged welding environments, then 
sonic test the welds and hydrostatically test the completed vessel. (If it 
bursts when full of water, they only get their soxs wet!)
Never make your own pressure cooker, steam is the most dangerous of gases, it 
blows your head off AND cooks you! Please use expert advice with pressurised 
steam or HBD will need an obituary column!

Subject: Water advice




Some time back, I asked my local water department for a water analysis, and
did so if for no other reason than I wanted to be able to compare some 
numbers.   Now that I have the numbers, I haven't the foggiest idea what 
they mean to my beers, and I know so little about water chemistry (as it 
relates to beer) that I'm not entirely sure what I should be asking the 
collective wisdom of the digest, but here goes...


The facts:
  I am an extract/partial brewer.

Subject: Questions about specific gravity and extract


The following is a copy of a message I sent Martin Manning relating his 
article in BT vol. 1 No. 3 about specific gravity and extract. Since the 
second part of question 2 and question 3 are not directly related to his 
article, and may be someone else has beeb wondering about this, I'm sending 
a copy to this forum, and see what the "gurus" have to say :-)...
             ----------------------------


Hi Martin,
I've been reviewing your article in BT vol. 1 No. 3 about specific gravity 
and extract, and I came across what, to my limited knowledge, seem like some 
inconsistencies. Let me explain (it might take a while) what I've been 
doing. For the sake of clarity, I'll divide this in 3 questions:


1) In page 34 of that BT issue, you conclude that sucrose produces a 
specific gravity increase of 46.31 points/lb/gal. Nevertheless, if I work my 
way finding the percent sucrose by weight in solution, I come with a 
different result. Let's see it. If we disolve 1 lb of sucrose in 1 gallon of 
water (assuming a water density of 0.9990 Kg/l or 8.338 lb/gal at 60 F), the 
percent sucrose in solution will be:
1 lb of sucrose divided by 9.338 lb of solution (8.338 lb water + 1 lb 
sucrose) = 0.1071, or 10.71% (10.71 Plato). 
Using your equation [3] of the BT article (also used to get that figure of 
46.31 you provide) to convert from Plato degrees to SG points (the formula 
being SG = 259/(259-P)), we get:
SG = 259/248.29 = 1.04313, that is to say, we got 43.13 points, not 46.31.




2)If we convert the above figure to points/Kg/liter, we get:
43.13 points x 2.205 lb/Kg x 3.785 liters/gallon = 43.13 x 8.346 = 359.96 
points/Kg/liter, not the 386.5 you provide in the same article (note, 
though, that we agree, obviously, in the conversion factor: 8.346).
Nevertheless, the most puzzling thing is that if I, again, make my way 
finding the percent sucrose by weight in solution, I come with, yet, another 
different result. Let's disolve 1Kg of sucrose in 1 liter (again, density 
0.9990 Kg/liter at 60 F) of water. The percent sucrose will be:
1 Kg sucrose/1.9990 Kg of solution (1 Kg sucrose + 0.9990 Kg water) = 
0.5003, or 50.03% (50.03 Plato). Using again your equation for converting to 
SG, we get:
SG = 259/208.97 = 1.23941, that is to say, 239.41 points, very far away from 
any of the 2 figures above (359.96 04 386.5). This difference cannot be 
accounted for by the error in the conversion formula.


I would really appreciate if you could comment on all this, since I'm really 
puzzled and, clearly, lost.




3)And, since we are talking about extract, I guess I'll throw in another 
question. Could you tell me who, how and/or why decided on using SG as the 
standard for homebrewers, while Plato as the standard for professional 
brewers, at least in the USA? I would really like to know what is the 
"standard" used by homebrewers in other countries, especially those who use 
the metric system.


Thanks a lot in advance. I look forward to your answer.
(as always, I'll summarize private answers, though I guess we have plenty of 
space on the HBD right now for a public discussion)

    Ray Daniels does not believe in the reverse-pressure, blow-off sucking 
 boogeyman.  I do not dispute your calculations and respect your 100 batch 
 experience but I have personally witnessed this phenomenon (of course I am 
 a Calvinist whose mother drank moderately during pregnancy).  The batch in 
 question was chilled to below 70F and placed in a 68F basement, and drank 
 thirstily from the blowoff bucket filled with a weak iodophor solution in 
 a few hours.  Its been water for me since (in a sanitized bucket it goes 
 without saying).
 
 On alcohol and pregnancy-
    OK, so maybe moderate consumption is fine during pregnancy.  Is that a 
 risk you are willing to take?  Look at what's sacrificed and what's being 
 wagered.

I've used grains that had been crushed 4 weeks prior, and noticed a bit of

Keep them cool, dry, out of sunlight.  Just like other foods.  Not sure what

That might help.  The problem with aging grains is not just the reduction of
the "good" flavors, but an increase in "bad" flavors.  Just like some styles 
call for aged hops, it's possible that you could invent a good beer with aged
grain, one that makes clever use of the unique flavors in the aging.  I'd say
after two or three hundred tries, you should have a nice recipe together.  
Please post it when you do.  :-)

Chemical stuff, probably.  Some bacterial and mold activity.  Not real sure.

I can't think of any good way to do it.  You'd probably have better results 
trying to unmark those bottles.  (?)  Perhaps you should do some experiments
with it and let us know any methods that work.  I guess you could just siphon
and re-prime.  Sounds fishy, though.  GOod luck.

Weird.  It might be the specific brands you're using, the way they've been 
stored, etc.  I've generally had better results with dry.  What brands are you
using?  Doesn't ound like a technique problem to me.

That's exactly like mine.  I don't know _what_ to call it.  A coutner-top 
chiller?  (I used to mostly use it in the bathtub, but the rubber duck would
get too cold with all the ice.  I now use it in a large laundry-sink.

That, to me, is the big advantage.

Mine was a breeze.  It's just a 30' length of 3/8" copper pipe.  Shaping it was
a bit difficult, and cleaning was also an issue (a big pain in the issue, in 
fact), but it wasn't hard at all.  I usually use it with a hop-back, which is
just my old "Zapap" lauter tun.  (Makes a great hop back, made a bad lauter 
tun.)

Subject: Northwestern Extract


This may have been covered in previous threads - but has anyone experienced
high final gravities when using Northwestern extract. I recently brewed an
IPA using a 3.3 lb. box of light NW with a 3.53 lb. can of Geordie Dark.
I pitched a very healthy starter that was a second generation Wyeast London
Special (#1968 I believe). The strong ale that I brewed just before that
started at 1.074 o.g. and finished at 1.020 - so I don't believe it's the
yeast. The old ale also didn't have any NW extract in the recipe.


This IPA started at 1.060 and seems to have finished at 1.020 after four
days. I was really looking for a 1.015 f.g. Last night I took my racking
cane and gently roused the top layer of trub-yeast. This morning there is
only about 1 bubble\20 seconds out of the air lock. I've brewed several
batches before with NW and seen the same situation. Any thoughts?

Normally three.  One for the first round, a second one in case the
category is so large it had to be split into more than one panel of
judges, the top beers from each panel then go up against one another
to pick the ribbons and then entry in Best of Show.  Then the third
beer goes on to Best of Show judging.


If this is an AHA "Club Only" competition, then only club members can
participate and 6 or 7 is normal.  The club uses the first three to
determine what single entry to send to the regional and the remaining
bottles are used at the regional level as above.

The only reason why "WE" are talking about religion on this bboard is
because someone inappropriately posted about it.  The original post was
not in reference to homebrewing but to alcohol in general.  If someone
posted on how alcohol relates to car accidents then does that justify
opening up a disscussion on a bboard that is devoted to MAKING beer? 
NO, not in the reasonable homebrewer's mind.  Let's keep faiths/beliefs
away from a disscussion group concerning how to make the beer.  Although
you may feel strongly about them, your religious beliefs will not help
me make my next batch.  Take it to a disscussion group on religion or
create your own bboard for the topics that relate to beer but have
nothing to do about making beer.  On the other hand, history relating to
brewing is probably of interest.  


If we don't don't draw a line as to what relates to beer making then we
are opening the door to the same kind of posts that pollute other
disscussion groups.  For example, drink beer, get drunk, have sex.  Then
we will have postings of 900/800 telephone numbers for "hot girls who
drink beer".  Hardly the kind of thing the majority of us want to be
disscussing or having to sort through headers to find the posts that

Subject: Boiling water to remove bicarbonate - details




Hi.


I have hard water here, with plenty of bicarbonate in it. It has
a pH of 7.4, and for brewing a pale ale  (all grain) my mash
pH would remain quite high without treatment.


So  I preboil my water to precipitate out the bicarbonate, and then
add gypsum during the mash to bring the pH down to a proper level.


Question :  In Noonan's book, Brewing Lager Beer, he says that one
should boil the water and then aerate as well as possible. Then,
after a brief rest, decant off the precipitate.


SO  VAGUE! What does he mean by brief!!?? He goes on to point out
that if you wait too long, the bicarbonate can recombine, which
would obviously be bad.


So.
How long should one wait?

In my brewing system I boil and then cool the wort with an immersion chiller.
During the cooling cycle I try not to disturb the wort and let the trub and

I still get varying amounts of trub which I usually don't worry about, but it
would be nice to eliminate it. Looking at my Zap-Pap I figured I have a
pretty good filter bed of spent grains, it is still warm (140 deg.) so should
be free of bacteria, just haven't had the nerve to pass a finished batch

True, but for the first few hours the tube will actually suck the
water/sanitizer back up the tube a small distance (3"-6" above
the level in my case) - reason: the head space air temp is
warmer than the cool wort, thus the cool wort is causing
the headspace to cool at a quicker rate than the wort is warming
and expanding, therefore it WILL (and does) suck in this scenario.


I use a 7 gal carboy with a 3/8" blow-off tube for a settling tank
before pitching.  I chill my wort to about 66-68F and room temp
is around 75F.  I would imagine this "sucking" phenomena would
lessen with smaller head-space.


Never had one suck it back into the tank though.

Humor?  How is that supposed to help me with my next batch of beer?
Please, no more humor unless it's directly beer related.  (Sheesh.)


I honestly have found this discussion educational and I think it

Subject: Pale Ale Mash, 1056 fruit flavor?


I am working my way into mashing, which is certainly ground covered by many 
of you already :-)  I'd like to find what I would call a "basic pale ale" 
(or perhaps an IPA) single infusion mash recipe to cut my teeth on; either 
all-grain or partial mash.  I searched CM3 for partial mash with little 
success (pulled 11 recipes; mostly porters) - will try the all-grain 
recipes next.  If any of you have such a recipe, I'd greatly appreciate 
your posting a cc or emailing it to me.


RE Wyeast 1056, I am finding several of my 1056 beers to have a pronounced 
flavor of fruit/citrus. Not a bad flavor by any means; just not my 
preference. Ferment temps run 66 degF to 70; averaging just about 68. They 
do hit 70 once or twice during ferment. Extract has been Alexander's; hop 
pellets cascades for flavor and aroma. Thanks to HBD advice, plenty of 
aeration and good pitch rates :-)


Initially I put this fruit flavor off to the cascades, which is described 
as being citrusy/fruity/even grapefruit. It's been pointed out that Sierra 
Nevada and Liberty don't have this fruit flavor and suggested that this 
fruit could really be from the 1056. Does 1056 tend to produce fruity 
flavors in these temp ranges?

Depending on the ambient temperature and the original gravity, it is not
unreasonable that your ferment may be over.  If you are concerned, you can
buy a hydrometer and check the SG.  If it is in the low teens (say, 1.015 or
less) then I would simply wait a week till the yeast settles and bottle.
If the SG is in the 20's or higher, it could be that your extracts were not
very fermentable (sorry, I'm not familiar with the brand you used).  When
you say "Dead nothing," did you wait five minutes?  Shaking the carboy will
release some of the dissolved gas, yes, and then it will take some time,
an hour maybe, for that very slow ferment to resaturate the beer with CO2.
Until the beer is saturated, it will not outgas any CO2 on it own and thus
will not move the airlock.

Few people will take a shot at these questions because there is no *sudden*
change from good grain to bad and therefore the answer to your first question
is quite dependent on your standards.  If you have low standards, you can
brew with grain that was crushed 10 years ago and kept in a mouldy cellar
in a paper bag.  If you are trying to win the AHA Nationals Best of Show,
you might discard grain that was crushed a week ago and kept in a gasketted
polyethylene bucket.  I've heard of people storing grain in Cornelius kegs!


If the need arises to use older pre-crushed grain, add 10 to 15% more grain
That's what I've heard some breweries do.  My knowledge in this area is more
pragmatic than scientific, so I'll leave it to others to explain what
processes might be taking place in this (slack) malt, but my experience has
shown that in general, "stale" grain tends to produce a beer with less malt
flavour and if conditions were right (or wrong, depending on your perspective)
metallic flavours can appear in the finished beer.  My understanding is that
these metallic flavours come from the hydrolysis of lipids in the grain,
followed by oxidation of unsaturated free fatty acids.

You could pour it from bottle to bottle, but you will lose a significant
portion of the carbonation.  Cooling the beer to near freezing would help
reduce this loss.  If you pour slowly, the outgassing CO2 will blanket
the beer in the receiving bottle and therefore there should be very little
degradation of the beer in the short term.  Don't do the rebottling too
far in advance and only do as many as you need.  Keep the rebottled beer
as cold as possible to reduce any oxidation.

Not only are there quality and fermentability differences between liquid
and dry malt extract, but also among different brands too.  A recipe that
tastes great with one extract can taste off with another.  In my experience,
DMEs tend to age more gracefully than syrups, i.e. they tend to stay good
longer.  Note again that Laaglander and "Dutch" DMEs are far less fermentable
than most extracts in either liquid or dry form and this can cause an imbalance
in your recipe.  That might be your problem.

You forgot another assumption: that the carboy is *full* of liquid.  Do the
calculation again with 2L of air in the top of the carboy and see if the
temperature drop needs to be that big.

>worse problems than getting sanitizer in your beer.


Personally, I use a (sanitized) 1.25" OD hose for blowoff so I'll bet
a 50F temperature change would not suck liquid up into the fermentor,
but I targeted my post to the most general of reader, perhaps one who uses
Charlie's (bad) advice of a racking hose as a blowoff tube.  Even without
a temperature change you can suck airlock liquid into your fermentor if
you lift a plastic (pail) fermentor.  Also, as you pointed out, some people
do chill down to 60F and then ferment at an ambient temperature of 65F,
but I'll be willing to bet that an order of magnitude more chill down to
only 80 or 90F and then put their fermentor in a 65F cellar.  What about
those who pitch at 65F and then immediately put the fementor into the
fridge?


I have personally seen blowoff bucket solution rising almost up to the neck
of a fementor in a narrow-ID hose... not in my last 160+ batches, but among
my first dozen or so.  Also I've fielded midnight calls from more than one
hysterical homebrewer whose airlock was running in the reverse direction.


It's not a myth.


Al.
