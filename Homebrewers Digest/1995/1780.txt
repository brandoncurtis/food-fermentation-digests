One quick note on fruit beers: don't use a blender on the fruit -- just
crush it well -- blending will pulverize the fruit and make siphoning off
of it more difficult.

Typically, between two and four bottles are requested, but I assume you are
considering entering the Brewer's On The Bluff competition, right?  The
difference here is that only one or two beers are used for the judging and
the rest are for a homebrew tasting afterwords.  This is a little
unconventional, but the idea is to expose more people to the taste of homebrew.
If you have very few bottles left, call the organizer and ask for a variance.
I'm sure he/she'll let you slide.

Steeping flaked barley will only get you cloudy beer.  You need to mash
it along with some enzymatic grain like 2-row or 6-row malt.  When you
write "specialty grains" I'm assuming you mean black patent, crystal,
roasted barley, etc.  These don't have enzymes and won't help convert
the starch to sugars.  You need to put together a small mash/lauter tun
and do a mini-mash.  If you have a roller mill, I would set it very
tight for the flaked barley.  Regular crushing (i.e. regular spacing or
rolling pin crushing) won't do much to flaked grains -- they are already
kind of "smashed flat."

Subject: Water de-ionization


I have just rented a water de-ionizer. I want to emulate brewing different
styles of beer with water that is close to the water of that style.  Will the
de-ionizer take out all minerals in the water?  Will I have to add back
minerals to the water?  What would the beer taste like if I used only
de-inoized water and did not add anything back to it?  I think the unit I
rented has two different types of media in it ( I don't know what to call
them ).  Can I brew as is, or do I have to add minerals back to the water in
accordance to the style of beer I am tying to make? I am from Texas and this
time of year the water in the lake turns over and the quality of water seems
to taste bad, therefore the de-ionizer. Can anyone help me with info?

Guys just a few points,


Blow-off tubes:  It seems everyone uses either water (boiled or not), or 
a sanitizer of preference.  I don't feel that suck-back is a concern.  
Have you ever watched a really good blow-off in action, if so you aren't 
losing any sleep over suck back.  I don't use any liquid :), do I hear a 
startled collective gasp.
        I have a different take on this situation that I got from "All 
About Beer ...And homebrewing" by Bob Pritchard.  I sanitize my primary, 
and blowoff tube like all good homebrewers should.  But I also sanitize a 
bubbler and my 1 gal blowoff bucket with *2* holes in the top.  I call it 
a pseudo-burton union system.  Everything is sterile(sanitized) and no 
water/sanitizer means you can't suck them back.  In addition I can do (as 
appropriate) a few things with the sterile undiluted blowoff.  Taste it, 
Culture it, repitch it, or just toss it like everyone else does.  Some 
benefits and no drawbacks that I can see.    


Wort Chillers:  I agree it is confusing.  I think we set up a long and 
complicated system of nomenclature for these beasties.
Here are my suggestions:


counter flow chiller(CF)-Cu tube in a hose-
pseudo-counter flow(PCF)-curled Cu in a counter flow housing(big tube)-
Pot Immersion chiller(PI)-Cu tube in your kettle-
Bucket Immersion chiller(BI)-Cu tube in water (wort siphoned)-
Bulk Chiller(BC)-carboy/pot in snowbank/sink-
Dump chiller(DC)-1 gal [wort] into 4 gal cold tap water-Newbie chiller(NC):)
        plus the suffixes (if necessary)
Tap Cooled(TC)-Tap water/pressure as coolant-
Ice Water(IW)-Ice used to chill water(coolant)-
Recirculated Icewater(RI)-For (CF/PCFs), rechill and pump spent water in IW-
        plus the prefixes (as necessary)-for combination chillers
1-*understood/presumed*
2-bi-
3-tri-*hopefully no one has done this*
etc.
So I have a tube in a garden hose-
        CF/TC chiller, or Just CF chiller
If water was in short supply I would add a pump and Ice bath and recirculate
        CF/RI chiller
If it wasn't cold enough I could add a secondary chiller (BI-IW) to my CF/TC
        bi-CF/TC-BI/IW
            A dual chiller with a primary Counter flow Recircalated 
        Tap water chiller coupled to a secondary Bucket Immersion Ice 
        water chiller.
Or maybe NOT!!!! :)  But seriosly, do let those you are corresponding 
with know what you are discussing.  Especially for the 2 types of CF and 
Immersion chillers!  It's awful easy to confuse some of us.:}


Burners:  Someone posted a list a while ago(?), Superb 1-618-234-6169 (I 
think).  The metal fusion # was not in service.  The Camp Chef doesn't 
mail order but said Sam's Club, Costco, and the Gander Mountain catalogue
have their product(no distributor near me:().  
If any one Knows the Metal fusion(in service number), Gander Mountain 
Contact, or a contact for Brinkman I would be mighty appreciative.


Dinners ready no chance to reread, hope I didn't say anything 
particularly stupid.  See Ya,                                        Rob

Talk about a scam (potentially).
I received in the mail a notice for a "Win your own Brewery" contest, 
whereby you write (in 250 words or less) an essay on why you would like to 
own and operate your Brewery (BrewPub).  All this for a measily $100 "entry 
fee".  BTW, this is for the Riverwalk Brewery and Grill in Downtown Fort 
Lauderdale, Florida.


$100 entry fee!!!!! Yes, that's right -- I think I'll send them cash -- why 
bother with a money order -- just send my hard earned money to someone I 
don't know for a contest that may not exist.  While I am at it -- maybe 
there is a contest to WIN the Brooklyn Bridge that I can enter for another 
$100.


Anybody else get this letter or am I the only sucker (oops -- I mean 
potential winner).  I'd sure like to know how they got my address (AHA? 
BJCP? IBS? BT?) -- who's selling lists of names? I think we can figure it 
out if we put our heads together.


Hell, think I'll drink a quart of iodophor (Ken S - did you mean undiluted
or 12.5 ppm?) and send them 10 essays with $1000.  I've always wanted my 
own BrewPub.

Bob, is that a typo?  Since the boiling temp. of water at sea level 
(1 atm. pressure) is 212 F, to get a 250 F water bath, it must be 
under some amount of pressure.  If it _was_ a "250 F bath" they must 
have been using a liquid other than water.

Subject: Norm's Chillers!!


In reference to Norman C. Pyle's thourough discussion of chillers I 
have always divided them into four types.


    1) Immersion - standard copper coil in the wort w/ coolant inside 
it.
    2) Bath - an immersion chiller where the coil is sitting in a tub 
of ice with the wort running through it.
    3) Counterflow - the copper coil is running inside a hose.... 
everyone knows this one!
    4) Plate cooler - the wort runs across a large plate that is 
somehow heavily chilled.  These don't see much use in homebrewing, but 
if anyone uses one I'd be interested in knowing how it's constructed.


    I would also be interested in a general consensus on cold break 
removal, is it critically neccessary or not? With my counterflow I run 
into probs with getting rid of it.  Anyway, Just my dos centavos.

If you used a dry yeast, this kind of fermentation is not uncommon.
A good way of understanding the state of your fermentation is to
check the specific gravities.  Did to measure the original (starting)
gravity of the wort? Have you measured the specific gravity of the
fermented beer?  If so, what are they?


===> Bob Devine discusses pressure cooking hops:

In principle you're correct that pressure probably doesn't matter.
However, it is the use of pressure that allows temperatures of
greater than 212^F to be achieved.

This seems high to me.  Most competitions I have entered required three (3)
12 oz bottles.

Subject: Brewing and society, even when it includes religion.




Let's pursue the SP sideof brewing, which, because brewing is done by 
human beings might include some religious aspects, of course not meant to 
offend but to enlighten and deepen discussion.  Personally, I have 
enjoyed and have learned a great deal from the posts reacting to my 
earlier call for responses on "religion and brewing."  Sorry if I 
offended some.  Let's open the discussion as Keith Royster suggests to 
include more aspects regarding the society we live in.  If we cloister 
ourselves away, only discussing the technical aspects of brewing, how 
will we ever improve our relations with those who would like to limit us 
or even shut us down?  Let's talk about what's been done to improve the 
image of homebrewing and brewing in general, and about whatever else 
comes to mind for discussion.  Personally, discussing hops can be quite 
enlightening, but hops alone can be dull as hell.  Let's keep some 
variety in our messages and stir up some creative thought, continuing to 
learn from each other and making room for learning from new 
perspectives.


An idea that just occured to me that might lend to the positive image of 
homebrewing and to the general acceptance of homebrewing as common is the 
founding of homebrew clubs on campuses.  Has anyone heard of this and if 
so, where?  Who has done it and how?  Most college students have free 
access to the internet, so what better way to socialize new homebrewers 
than through clubs suported by advice and wisdom of more experienced 
brewers on the net?  Ideas?  I am even thinking about posting list 
addresses and WWW sites on bulletin boards around campus to stoke some 
student interest and information seeking.  I live in an extremely 
conservative part of the South and this might encourage some students who 
are interested in seeking some ideas and resources.  Any other ideas on 
openning up the world of homebrewing to new persons and on perpetuating a 
positive reputation for our pastime?


Post lengthy messages to my private address and boiled down ideas to the 
digest.  Thanks for your help!

Subject: chillers, sanitation and cherry beer


Dear Virtual Homebrew Club,


Do you think VHC is a good acronym for HBD subscribers?  Naturally, I speak
only as a Evangelical Reformed Extract of Mercury brewer, and to Sodom with
the rest of THEM.


Today I made sixty litres of wort, 11.4'P all pale malt, low bittering.  One
of them will be the base for a cherry beer.  The sweet cherries were picked
on Sunday, pitted, pureed and frozen.  They'll be thawed, possibly be
semi-sanitized with heat, then added to the carboy.  Perhaps after racking.
I racked over a sweet brown ale onto some of the same cherries the day they
were picked.  Whole hunks of fruit don't break down and small hunks can be a
nuisance downstream.  I go for adding in secondary fermentation to reduce
concerns of sanitation and to maximize retention of aroma.  I know there
have been other posts about fruits lately, but any "head 'em off at the
pass" words of wisdom are welcome.


I use a counterflow chiller based on the theoretical idea that it is the
speed with which one cools the wort (every incremental little bit) which is
impotent -- THERE's a thread, brewing and potency.   I'd be interested in
hearing if anyone can use such a chiller without a pump.  A pump (mine's
Little Giant, Ryton volute, magnetic impellor) is a godsend (Amen,
hallelujah! hic).  
Trying to get serious, a main concern with chillers is sanitation, which
reminds us of the post about 'sanitizing' doggie detritus with a lethal
spray, then 'cleaning' it afterwards.  I hope we all recognize the humour
and don't try to sanitize before we clean.  Someone please tell me if there
is anyway to sanitize something that's dirty without autoclaving it.


I do try to recirculate a near-boiling solution of sodium hydroxide through
my chiller now and then, which ends up being semi-annually.  The beauty of
heat sanitation is that it penetrates scum.  During each brew and after
rinsing the chiller with hot water, I recirculate boiling wort through the
chiller and back into the kettle.  I expect that to kill everything in
there.  It's also a way to curb boil overs.  Again, the recirculation

Then, while cooling in, I can put some wort in the bottom of each carboy,
pitch the yeast _leaving some starter in the mason jar_, then cool some new
wort on top in the mason jar.  Presto, more  than enough yeast in the mason
jar for the next time around without having to try to get it off the bottom
of a carboy.  It's a variation on parallel yeast propagation. , -Rob

Bob Imag asked about the use of flaked barley.


You can't be making your own beer from grain without loving the procedures
themselves (can you?)  So you can do as much as you like with flaked barley,
but you can also add it directly to your mash without any further grinding.
I've done this on a commercial scale, 5% of the grist if I recall.  There
the mash was only 30 minutes quasi-single-step, then a raise to mash off.


On some things, what you THINK you are doing to your beer is almost as
important as what ends up in your mouth.

Subject: IBU numbers in Suds


Hi all! I'm the guy who asked about Laaglanders malt in a barelywine. I
haven't responded publicly to the beer and religion thread (just look at my
sig line to see where I stand, and I don't stand alone!)


Anyway,
  I did do a barleywine, no Laaglanders, just 15 lbs of M&F light malt syrup
(I think, the boxes were not labled and I can't remember what the guy told
me they were when I bought them.)
  Anyway, (oh, I already said that) I use the latest version of Suds and I
used that hop bitterness thingy. Well, I was wondering what the normal
bitterness rating is for a barleywine using the latest Suds release formula?
The Hop IBUs is 215.2. And I'm not sure exactly what that means. Here's what
I got for hops:
        4 oz. Brewers Gold (pellets) 8.8%  75 minute boil
        1 oz. Eroica (pellets) 9.5%  45 minute boil
        3 oz. Cascade (plugs) 5.2% 15 minute boil


Ok, question two. I used a German Ale yeast to start things off. This
proceeded to go nuts for about two days, then pretty much died. I racked to
a secondary and my gravity went down from an OG of 1.090 to 1.036 which is
just about where my dealer had said that my German Ale yeast will peter out.
So I had a champagne yeast ready to go and added that in after I racked.
That was just about 24 hours ago and nothing has happened yet. The foam that
had built up from the racking has gradually dissipated, so it doesn't look
like its doing anything. Anyone got any ideas? I'd appreciate them!

Subject: Answers about specific gravity and extract


In yesterday's HBD I raised some questions about some apparent 
contradictions in SG and extract calculations and conversions between Martin 
Manning's article in BT and my own ones.
After a private conversation with Martin, these apparent contradictions 
disappeared. All calculations presented yesterday were correct, although 
they were not dealing with the same concept. The key to the misunderstanding 
lies in the fact that yield refers to pounds of extract in a gallon of 
SOLUTION, not water.


This error arose since I was working with the yield tables provided by Dave 
Miller when using the equations in Martin's article. In his book "Brewing 
the world's great beers", page 130, Dave M defines yield as "the number of 
specific gravity points that 1 pound [of grains] will raise one gallon of 
WATER [my capital letters]", and in his book "The complete handbook of 
homebrewing", page 196, he provides a table of yields as "the extract of 1 
pound of the material in 1 gallon of WATER [again, my capital letters]". 
Upon further revision, I came across a correct definition, though, in page 
58 of the same last book.


I hope this will help to clarify the concept, and set the record straight.

Subject: Residue in my fermenter!


Howdy folks!  I've just moved to a new town and brewed my first batch
in the new digs.  I remove trub by pouring the chilled wort into a glass
carboy, let it settle, then rack it into a clean carboy.  This weekend when
I brewed, I cleaned out the first carboy as per my usual protocol: 
fill it with hot water and a bit o' bleach, let it sit overnight, then
rinse it really well with my bottle washer.  To my surprise, there is
some kind of whitish precipitate on the inside of the carboy that
I can't get rid of.  I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed to no avail.
I have no idea what the water chem is around here (Frederick, MD),
but my guess is that the bleach made something precipitate out
of the water.


Anybody ever have this happen before?  Because this is resistant to my
standard carboy-cleaning procedure, I'd appreciate any advice on how
to get my carboy spanking clean again.  Maybe I should get a long brush?

Subject: Perry (pear cider) Recipe




Bullwinkle Perry


Bullwinkle is a golden semi-dry pear cider which has the
character of a white wine with modest pear aroma and pears in the
flavor. Pears are not as aggressively flavored as apples, so
perry (pear cider) has subtle flavors enhanced by the sugars and
acids used in preparation.


Ingredients:
5 gallons pear squeezings (juice) OG = 1.052
2 lb. light brown sugar
4 lb. white table sugar
1 tsp. grape tannin
2 tsp acid blend
3 tsp tartaric acid
5 tsp malic acid
1 1/2 tsp citric acid
2 5 gm packets Red Star Pasteur Champagne dried yeast


Estimated OG = 1.095, FG = .096, alcohol approx. 12.3% by vol.


Make sure everything has been sanitized, and do not worry about
camden tablets, boiling stuff, etc. This is a no-sweat recipe.


Heat 1 gallon of the juice enough so you can dissolve the sugars
and additives in it. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.


Meanwhile reconstitute the dry yeast in a cup of warm (90-100
degrees F) water.


When the sugars are dissolved, dump the whole mess into a 5-
gallon carboy, fit a blowoff tube and pitch the yeast. watch the
liquid level in the carboy, and top up with fresh pear juice as
needed. Fermentation will drop off in about a month. When it
does, rack to a second carboy and top up with fresh cider.


Wait 45 days before bottling. Sample about 4 months after
bottling. My last batch was made on 9/20/94, racked to the
secondary on 10/20/94 and bottled 12/4/94. We began drinking it
in April, and it was good and still improving. I am confident it
will be all gone long before it reaches theoretical peak flavor.

Subject: Chillers


     In HBD #1778, Norm Pyle writes about chiller terminology and usage. 
     Norm introduces new terms ("bulk" and "incremental") to chillers. 
     
     (Finally, a topic I know something about! :-) )
     
     In industrial usage, "counterflow" is one of three terms which 
     generally describe heat exchanger configuration, the other two being 
     "crossflow" and "parallel flow".  Counterflow is the more common 
     configuration because it allows the greatest change in fluid 
     temperature for a given set of inlet conditions.  These terms refer to 
     the relative movement of the two fluids which exchange heat, and imply 
     forced flow in both fluids. I have never heard any of the three terms 
     applied to what Norm refers to as a "bulk" cooler.  
     
     Perhaps "forced flow" might be a better term than "incremental" for 
     the type of chiller in which wort flows through tubing.  I agree with 
     Norm that what is happening with the wort should be used to name the 
     cooler, which would result in the "wort-flowing-through-tubing-
     immersed-in-ice" chiller being called a forced-flow chiller as well.
     
     I recently constructed a "bulk" chiller from 25 feet of 3/8" copper 
     tubing and some hoses and clamps.  I used it for the first time with 
     my latest batch.  It cooled 4.5 gallons of wort from boiling to 80F in 
     8 minutes, 30 seconds, with the tap water at about 73F.  I stirred the 
     wort with the chiller during the cooling process.  I am very happy 
     with this chiller because it cools the wort quickly, and cleaning and 
     sanitizing are very easy.
     
     While I am now a chiller user, I am still unsure of the technical 
     reasons for using them.  To me, the reduction in time alone is worth 
     it, but what does rapid cooling do for the flavor of the beer?  I 
     recall someone stating that the two biggest improvements that a 
     beginner can make are switching to liquid yeast and using a chiller.  
     I have done both, but really, what have I done?

Subject:       7 gal Gott  /  false bottom  /  fruity 1056


I have two questions and one contribution to todays HBD....


Q1)        Is a 7 gallon Gott (Gott is German for God, but this is not a
        religion post.  Please, no flames!) big enough for mashing 10 gallon
        batches?  I'm currently brewing extracts while I collect the equipment
        for all-grain and I saw a 7gal Gott for $27 that I could use as a
        mash/lauter tun, but I want the flexibility to move to 10 gallon
        brew batches if I want to.  The dimensions are 16" diam. X 15" high 
        (it is shorter and fatter than it's 5 gal. cousin).  If 7 gal. is not big 
        enough, I will look for the 10 gal. Gott.


Q2)        I found a pizza cooking "sheet" that could be used as a false bottom
        for the above mash/lauter tun.  Actually, it is not a true sheet, but a
        heavy duty, rigid aluminium screen "for crispier crusts".  I remember
        past HBD threads about false bottoms concerning ratio of hole area to
        surface area (percent open?) to be an important factor.  Obviously, such
        a screen has a very large percent-open ratio.  My question, is why does
        this matter?  Isn't it the grain bed that is acting as the filter?  If
        so, then as long as the false bottom holds the grain back and lets the
        wort flow, then all is good, correct?  Also, if I adapt a RIMS system to
        this (which I want to do) then it seems to follow that such a large
        percent open area will allow for an easier flow of wort, which will
        lessen the negative pressure below the grain bed, which will lessen any
        disturbance to said grain bed from the pump.  Any advice/comments?


A1)        Tim asks about fruity/citrus flavors from 1056 Wyeast.


        Tim, you're right, cascade does have a citrus flavor which is often
        associated with grapefruit.  If you have ruled out your hops as the
        cause, then ale yeasts can cause fruity flavors, but more so when they
        are fermented at higher temps.  I have an article here from the ZYMURGY
        Summer 1994 issue by Patrick Weix on just about every yeast culture you
        can think of along with comments on style, attenuation, flocculation,
        and other notes.  Wyeast #1056 is described as fermenting "dry, finishes
        soft, smooth and clean.  Very well balanced."  The notes also add that
        the "optimum fermentation temp" is 68F (20C). "The cleanest of the
        bunch, this is Sierra Navada's yeast.  Probably the best availavle
        all-around yeast."  Therefore, I would conclude that the esters normally 
        associated with fruit flavors/aromas should be quite low for this ale 
        yeast if fermented at the right temp.  If you don't have a method of 
        controlling your fermentation temps (cool cellar, fridge, etc.) and are 
        fermenting in this summer heat, that may be your cause.


        I've found Partick's article to be very valuable and would like to see
        it on the FAQs list on Spencer's Web page.  I know that Patrick at least
        use to be a member of the HBD, so if you are out there Pat, would you
        contribute your article to the public?  Or would you mind if I
        transcribed it and submitted it to the Web?

No, no.  Dont do this.  What you have is *spent* grains, throw em away!
What you want is to sanitize your Zapap and line it with whole fresh
hops.  The hops will form a hop back to remove the trub.  Only problem
is if you dont want a beer with a big hoppy aroma, which this will give.
The Zapap may be a bit oversized to be a good hop back, but it will work

I think that Martin was referring to one pound of sucrose in a gallon of

result in more than a gallon of solution.  I think this will account for
your error.


The reason for SG rather than Plato being a standard in homebrewing is
historical.  All of the early information (such as it was) came from
England, where SG is the standard in the brewing industry and became so
for English homebrewing.  In American home winemaking, degrees Brix is
standard, as it is for the industry, because the information came from

Soapbox broken, climbing onto keg:


I have no problem with HBD discussion of beer-related religion; or is that 
religion-related beer?  Hey, the HBD is a sociological organism governed by 
our collective conscious as expressed through our postings. It's the sum 
total of the personalities and philosophies of all participants. It lives, 
grows, changes, etc. as we do, because "it is us".  Yea, we have a beer 
focus - does that mean we can't muse about how the rest of the universe 
might relate (or not relate) to beer?


If a thread is of interest, others will respond. If not, it will die. If 
one is offended by a thread, go ahead and say so! If you don't want to 
post, *PG DOWN* or scroll forward.  If it gets too overwhelming, don't read 
for a couple of days - or unsubscribe.  


People know we are about beer. The "collective" will keep us on subject. 
For me at least, the occasional beer-related detour thread makes it all the 
more fun.  If the detour ends up a new interstate hgwy, it will split off 
of it's own accord and go it's own direction.  I don't think HBD is in any 
jeopardy from *beer-related* detour threads; but (IMHO) HBD quality would 
suffer should we try to preemptively shut them down as some have suggested.


Relax, have a homebrew. Don't worry - be happy.

Don't know about the Liberty, but the SNPA yeast is supposed to *BE* 1056, or
virtually the same as 1056.  So this leaves you with a recipe very similar to
SNPA:  same yeast, same hops.  I would expect similar flavors, and in your
case, I'd blame it on the Cascades.  This isn't badness, IMO.

I'd say take a recipe you find for a rasberry beer and double or triple the
quantity to figure out how much blueberries to add.  Blueberries are far more
subtle than rasberries, especially when the sweetness has fermented away.
Perhaps an already sweeter beer style might be appropriate.
