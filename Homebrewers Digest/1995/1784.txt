Subject: Hops and Cherries


Hey All,


I'm planning an all-grain cherry pale using 10 pounds of sour cherries.  I 
realize there are a multitude of ways to add fruit to beer, but I plan to 
freeze the cherries, pasteurize them ala Papazian/Zymurgy, chill and transfer 
either the squeezed juices only to the primary or the whole fruit and juice 
to the secondary.  Which is better and why?  But to my main point...what hop 
varieties and IBU levels best complement the sourness of the cherries.  The 
recipes I've seen call for fairly low bittering and use the noble lager 
varieties or Saaz, with some light finishing hops also added.  I was going to 
use Goldings, but the citrusy notes may not provide the correct 
contrast/complement---can you say "fruit salad"?  ;)  Any pointers on yeast 
variety would also be appreciated----1056 American may have just the neutral 
character that would work well, but I have an on-going culture of Irish yeast 
that is really performing nicely.  Thanks for any help.  I'll summarize and 
post.

 *****   WARNING!!!    FIRST POST        *****
   TECHNICAL GADGET-TYPE MATERIAL TO FOLLOW

I am a new brewer (1 batch...materials for 2nd ordered) and have been 
enjoying the HBD for approximately one month now.  First batch was from 
a kit (boil-n-pitch) that the homebrew store owner talked me into buying 
and trying while I began to read about brewing.  Not a bad brew...but 
could be SO much better.  Extensive FAQ searching and HBD lurking have 
revealed the well-worn path toward better beers...AND pointed out the 
need for one of my greatest weaknesses...GADGETS.


The second batch will be 7# of an Old Ale extract kit (M&F) supplemented 
with fresh Cascade hops and fermented with Wyeast 1098 British Ale 
yeast.  [Great yeast FAQ by Patrick Weix on the stanford archives, BTW.]  
Armed with recent HBD entries and the archives regarding sanitation, 
plastic vs. glass, "dropping", starters, and blow-off tubes, my neighbor and 
I should be ready to proceed with this batch...BUT there's a problem.


THE PROBLEM:  While the wort is cooling on these hot, hot days, my 
brewing neighbor and I spend FAR too much time discussing religion, 
politics, sports, and Suburbans...OBVIOUSLY, we need a wort chiller to 
eliminate this dead time and "purify" our brewing experience!  Here's a 
quick(!?) history of the current design.


(1)  I decided to try for a counter-flow chiller (with my love of gadgets, 
the immersion chiller was clearly not complex enough).  I looked at
all the ASCII art regarding the "copper tube in a garden hose" variety of 
chillers but had to discard those plans because of the LOW SPOUSAL 
APPROVAL rating...No way that I am going to get a roll of garden hose 
into the kitchen, no matter how slick I design the coupling connections.


(2)  I designed a "copper tube in a clear plastic hose" chiller (sexy idea, 
lot of variations of couplings possible--my personal favorite is a Swagelok 
union tee and bore-thru reducer combination).  Why not a micro-brewery 
quality "copper tube in a copper tube" arrangement (great flow geometry 
with a 3/8" in a 1/2" tube)...BUT, it is still a roll of tube in the kitchen!


(3)  I got very excited by the "copper tube in a PVC pipe" design discussed 
recently.  I wanted to find dimensions for an insert spacer and a PVC tube 
which would ensure a "true" counter-flow design.  I also wanted to route 
all the inlet and outlet tubes through one end of the device so that it could
sit cleanly, upright and proud, without a gaggle of hoses and pipes 
protruding from it (remember the spousal approval concerns).  The "insert" 
spacer need only be capped on one end if the water is designed to flow 
below the level of the inside tube.  The winning design is a 3-1/8" OD piece 
of capped Cu tubing housed in a ten-inch length of 4" PVC pipe.  The 
assembly should accommodate 22' of counterflow-chilled 3/8" OD copper 
tubing.  After some searching, I actually found an eight-inch tall, 4" ID 
chrome-plated canister (scrap) in good condition that can serve as the PVC 
pipe (and win major bonus points in spousal approval).  


The wort inlet (and water outlet) is located on the top of the canister near 
the outer rim.  The wort tube coils snugly around and down the 3-1/8" Cu tube
and then turns and enters the bottom cap of this inner tube through a roomy 
1/2" tube-to-MPT adapter.  Inside the large Cu tube, a ten-inch long, 
straight section of 1/2" Cu tubing encloses the 3/8" wort tube and extends 
from the adapter through the canister top (center).  A reducing tee is 
soldered to the top end of the 1/2" Cu tube and also to the outside of the 
3/8" wort outlet tube thus providing a water inlet port.  I can even purchase
a slick-looking, black rubber 4" x 3" PVC pipe adapter to dress up the top of
the canister and provide a pressure-tight seal.  I will place a loose-fitting
cap on top of 3-1/8" Cu tube so that it can be filled with ice and/or water 
if further cooling is required in the summer months.


SO, WHAT DO I CALL THIS CONTRAPTION????  I was willing to call 
it a simple counter-flow chiller, but I guess (using R. Brown's terminology) 
I have a combination:
 a) counterflow (3/8" inside 1/2" Cu tube for ten inches)
 b) pseudo-counterflow (3/8" coiled inside 4"ID canister for 17 feet)
 c) bucket-immersion (same 17' coiled about ice-chilled 3" Cu can)


AND, since my brewing kettle (still virgin) is a mere 20 quart capacity...I 
will be pouring the wort into approx. 1-1/2 gallons of aerated chilled water:


 d) dump chiller


I plan to use tap water through this beast, but with the iced-Cu insert, I 
guess my water is also partially ice-chilled.


ACCORDINGLY, this chiller is a "quad" variety...more precisely a


  <DRUM-ROLL, please.....>


Counterflow-Pseudocounterflow-Bucket immersion-Dump chiller pumped 
with Tap & partly Ice-chilled water--a quad-CF/PCF/BI/DC-TC/IW chiller!




So, will my beer be ruined?  Thanks for the bandwidth  :-).

This is the tenth in a series of posts on the formulation
of waters similar to those of famous brewing cities of the world. They
are based on ion concentration profiles given by Dave Draper in
his post in #1704 (10 April 95). See my  post "Water Series" (#1763) for
explanatory material (correction: in the Line 3 explanation read 1.8 ml of
1 N sulfuric acid, not 18 ml). Quick reminders: all ion concentrations and
salt quantities are in ppm which is the same as mg/l. The water to
which the salts are added is assumed to be ION FREE (i.e. it is
DISTILLED WATER or REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER).


The Koln profile is attributed to Bob Bloodworth in the HBD of 26 Jan 95.
It is one of the easiest profiles we have had so far with a good anion/
cation balance at pH 7 so that it can be marginally formulated with simple
salts without the use of external acid if we increase the weight on calcium
to 1.4:

Permanent hardness:      0.07 mEq;      3.72 ppm as CaCO3


This formulation is just shy of our tolerance limits both overall and in
the calcium but so close that we feel that it should be offered as it is
one of the few opportunities to formulate a water reasonably accurately at
a reasonable pH without recourse to external acid (carbonic or otherwise).
It works because the very high chloride requirement allows us to use a lot
of HCl which neutralizes much of the alkalinity.


An extremely accurate formulation with external acid and simple salts is
given by Formualtion II

 Carbonic:  0.4899   Bicarbonate:  2.0424   Carbonate:  0.000978 mM
 Total Required Hydronium:  2.8067   Sulfuric Hydronium:  0.0000 mEq
 Hydrochloric Hydronium:  1.0270 mEq
 1.7796 mEq additional hydronium required to maintain pH  7.00
 Solubility Products - CaCO3: 8.70E-09   MgCO3: 2.60E-05
 Ion Products        - CaCO3: 2.54E-09   MgCO3: 6.03E-10

 Temporary hardness:      5.07 mEq;    253.33 ppm as CaCO3
 Permanent hardness:      1.36 mEq;     67.98 ppm as CaCO3


The external acid requirement is modest at 1.8 mEq/L. Comparing this formulation
to Edinburgh 3 we see that similar amounts of CaCO3 and hydrochloric acid
are used
and that a similar amount of external acid is required for pH 7. We would thus
expect that the reasoning used to justify ignoring the external acid addition
for Edinburgh 3 would be equally applicable here.


Should the CO2 option be desired aeration to pH 7 would yield about 290 ppm
total carbonate. Aeration to about pH 7.5 would be required to get to
approximately
150 ppm total.


Thus we have two choices here. Formulation I could certainly be considered an
adequate representation of Koln water. Perfectionists may use Formulation II.

Kevin writes in HBD 1780:


Q1)        Is a 7 gallon Gott (Gott is German for God, but this is not a
        religion post.  Please, no flames!) big enough for mashing 10     
       gallon batches? 


Kevin: Remember that you will want to add from 1.5 to 2.5 quarts of 
water per one pound of grain depending on how stiff of a mash you want. 
You will then need to figure the total amount of grain you might need 
for a 10 gallon batch.  WARNING: This number will vary tremendously 
depending on the target OG of your brews!!!!!  Now that you know the 
strike water volume you will have to figure about half again that 
volume because of all that grain!!  My point is that you need as much 
room as possible in the mash/lauter tun.  Trying to cram the thing to 
it's rims just ups the possible anxiety factor.  A 7 gallon cooler will 
comfortably hold MOST 5 gallon batches, but I doubt 10 would go into 
it.


    I just jumped from 5gallon batches to 15gallons, and learned one 
very important thing (Yes, just one.  I was in a stubborn mood that 
month!) WHEN YOU GO TO BIG BATCHES OVERSIZE ALL OF YOUR TOOLS. Good 
thing for me that one of my tools was already well oversized! ;^)  
Hmmm, I think I hear the sound an incoming Napalm strike!  COVER!!!

        In HBD #1781 (July 14), DougO made reference to the U.S. Supreme

In that decision, the Court struck down the federal prohibition against 
listing the alcohol content of beer on the product label.
        The brief summary of the case posted by DougO was not actually the 
Supreme Court's decision in Rubin v. Coors.  What was posted is referred 
to as the case syllabus, and it is not part of the Court's decision.  In 
fact, the syllabus is not drafted by one of the Supremes, but is written 
by Court employees in conjunction with West Publishing Company.
        I have the full decision of the Court in Rubin v. Coors available, 
if anyone is interested in reading it.  Please respond by private e-mail,

There are two ways in which I use the "measure the specify gravity method".
First I cool the sample, and I switch between collection containers.  To
cool the sample I simply use a very thin aluminum pie pan, (Sara Lee) put
the sample in this and place this in a cold water bath in the sink.  Cools
to a useable temperature in a minute or three.


About the time I take a sample, I switch collection containers so I may
decide that these very last running are for the drain and not the brew kettle.


The other factor I use is the amount of sparg water I have heated.  Knowing
about where I will come out for a given number of pounds of grain, I only
heat so many gallons of sparg water.  Hope these ideas help a little.  It is
surprising how fast a sample will cool in that thin wall aluminum formed
container and a water bath.

Subject: FrankenBrauCap (el cheapo carbonator) review


Since I'm a frequent reader, I'd thought I'd contribute something, a
review of the FrankenbrauCap(tm) (sp?), an idea that some unremembered
genius posted a few months back. (Sorry I don't remember who you are,
and I am too lazy to look at back issues).


The FrankenbrauCap is a poor man's Carbonator for carbonating beverages
in plastic PET pop bottles. The idea is so simple, I wish I'd thought of
it. Goes to the auto parts store, and buy a couple of tire valve stems.
Soak them in baking soda for a week or so (or put them in the hot
Arizona sun, if availible ;) ) to get rid of the digusting odor. Drill
an appropriately sized hole in the center of a couple of caps for the
aforementioned PET bottles, and pop in the valve stem.


Now, go buy an air chuck (the little thing that you inflate tires with)
at any tool or hardware store. Attach air chuck to your CO2 regulator.


Fill your bottles with desired liquid and chill. Cap with the
FrankenbrauCap. Inflate your bottles with CO2 at the desired pressure.
It's just like filling up your bike tires. Shake vigorously a minute,
and inflate again. Do this 3 or 4 times. Presto, carbonated beverage!
It works great and is easy to use.


Costs:


2-pack valve stems                $2.88
air chuck                        $2.00
hose barb for above                $0.69
                                -----
                                $5.57


2 Carbonators(tm)                ~$20-$25


Extra notes: Valve stems are probably not food grade. I carbonate, let
sit for a day in the fridge, and recap with an unmodified cap. I think
it's OK since I got the smell out, and the beverage does not sit in contact with
the valve stem. It helps to overcarbonate some if you do this.




Recipe #1: Cranberry-Ginger Ale


3.25 qts water
1 cup honey
1oz freshly grated ginger
3cups cranberry juice (yes, pure juice, not that juice cocktail stuff!)


Dissolve honey in water. Bring to boil, and add ginger. Simmer 30 min.
Cool to room temp or colder, and mix in cranberry juice. Bottle, chill,
and carbonate. Use 50 psi if you want to recap. Delicious! It even has a
little head retention.




Recipe #2: Garlic Lover's Soda


4 qts water
1 cup honey
5 minced fresh garlic cloves


Dissolve honey in water. Bring to boil, and add garlic. Simmer 10 min.
Cool to room temp or colder. Bottle, chill, and carbonate. Use 50 psi if
you want to recap. Now if you have read this far, go check yourself into
a nut house for even thinking of making something this disgusting.
Yecch! Eew!!! #( 
And I'm a garlic lover, too!

London City


This is the eleventh in a series of posts on the formulation
of waters similar to those of famous brewing cities of the world. They
are based on ion concentration profiles given by Dave Draper in
his post in #1704 (10 April 95). See my  post "Water Series" (#1763) for
explanatory material (correction: in the Line 3 explanation read 1.8 ml of
1 N sulfuric acid, not 18 ml). Quick reminders: all ion concentrations and
salt quantities are in ppm which is the same as mg/l. The water to
which the salts are added is assumed to be ION FREE (i.e. it is
DISTILLED WATER or REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER).


The London City profile is from Westerman and Huige, "Fermentation Technology".
It is a problem profile like several of the others we have had in that its
anion/cation ratio is very unbalanced at pH 7 and the source of the
imbalance is,
as is usually the case, that not enough carbonate is allowed to balance
the desired calcium. We therefore use the approach we have used before of
letting
the carbonate go wherever it wants. The result is Formulation I, an accurate
representation at pH 7 using simple salts and external acid.

 No permanent hardness. Temporary hardness:      4.99 mEq;    249.34 ppm as
CaCO3


As before we prefer the use of CO2 as the external acid. If we were to make up
Formuation I and then saturate it with CO2 the pH would go to about 5.57. It
is not necessary to saturate but only to dissolve enough CO2 to dissolve all the
CaCO3 but as a practical matter we will wind up near saturation anyway. If
we now
aerate the water to various levels of pH we get the following:


        pH      total carb, ppm    PaCO2, mmHg     Ca, ppm


   7.00        385               27.95          90.06
   7.10        370               22.50          90.06
   7.20        356               17.83          90.06
   7.30        356               11.00          90.02
   7.40        210                6.86          89.96
   7.50        164                4.35          89.90
   7.60        129                2.75          89.81
   7.70        103                1.79          89.72
   7.82         77                1.03          89.57


Thus we must raise the pH to about 7.8 to get the carbonate to the specified
level. We would expect from this that the pH of London City water would be
near this value. We note that even at pH 7.8 the partial pressure of CO2
is about three times the level of equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 and
would therefore expect this formulation to continue to lose CO2, if slowly,
until the pH reached about 8. We also note that some CaCO3 is precipitated
as we aerate to pH values above 7.3 but that the amount of Ca lost is minimal.


We would be inclined to try this formulation without external acid of any
type but would keep the lactic acid bottle at hand in case the malt did not
have enough buffering capacity to bring the pH down to the desired range for
conversion. What will actually happen depends, of course, on the composition
of the grist (i.e. there should be plenty of acid in the dark malts used in
a porter) and the brewing technique (including any water treatment).

  I recently made a batch of American Pale Ale with Wyeast 1056.  I 
had a very fruity brew which eventually mellowed out.  It was very 
well aerated (I had several inches of foam after siphoning into the 
primary), but during fermentation the temperatures got above 75 
during a suprise hot spell.  I think that temperature has a larger 
effect on fruitiness than aeration.  Just my opinion which isn't 
always worth much.

Subject: Re: Brewing and Society (fwd)




Okay, this is my first post to this list. I just thought I'd respond to 
the thread about homebrewing's "image" in society with my own experiences 
as a VERY new brewer (just finished my 2nd extract batch).  I don't know 
if people see homebrewing as "immoral" or "offensive."  People I've 
talked to and who have tried my first brews are usually impressed. The 
only objections are generally health-related. "You're gonna go blind, 
man"..."That stuff'll kill you, dude" and so on.


This probably comes from prohibition-era images of "bathtub gin" and 
liquor that did, if I remember correctly, kill people. These concerns, 
regarding homebrew, are completely erroneous (aren't they?), but I think 
that collective image persists, and the general populace will have a 
distrust of homebrewers and even small brewpubs. In NY metro, where 
brewpubs have been multiplying recently, there have been several news 
reports of the "underregulation" of brewpubs, and of people feeling sick  
after drinking   brewpub brews. I think this is the only image problem 
we have to be concerned with, and this may change too as more people learn 
to appreciate real beer. 


BTW, I read the posts about college brew clubs with interest, being a 
college brewer myself. I'm the only homebrewer I know of at my school, 
but I've found that this is a hobby that spreads. Since I became 
interested in homebrewing, several friends and family members have also 
taken up the hobby.
Peace and Beer,

Subject: Blowoff revisited


Hi again,


Reading HBD #1782 comments/questions from Joseph Fleming and Bob Devine I 
realized in my rush to get to my dinner I did not explain my system 
well.  Apologies to all left confused, I will try better this time.


The way I see it you want to get rid of your blowoff but not suck back 
through the hose.  In addition as Bob Devine is concerned about keeping 
it all sanitized, I agree.  I do blowoff (tube on carboy mouth) and I 
most definitely have a closed fermentation.  Before another flawed 
description lets try a drawing:
                     /-------\        
                    / /-----\ \  Blowoff tubing
                   I I             II
                 __) (__     II
                I        I    II
                I        I    II  ___
                I        I    II  I I Bubbler (or Air filter/sterile cotton)
                I        I    II  III
                I        I   _II___I_
                     I        I   lII     l
                I        I   l       l
                I_______I   l_______l


                 Carboy       Bucket


Okay does that make sense so far.  The bucket has no liquid in it so 
there can be no suck back.  The bubbler "seals" out any nasties, and if 
you are concerned about sucking water/sanitizer from the bubbler you can 
use a filter/cotton instead.  The pure blowoff is now stored in a sanitized 
container.  The contents of the bucket are as "sterile" as the wort and 
could be used as a starter, for culturing, to taste, or anything else you 
might want to use "sterile" undiluted(no chlorine/Iodophor) Blowoff for.  
I have never repitched directly but the yeast(ALE)/wort concoction is very 
active and continues to ferment when placed in the fridge for storage.   
  
As to the question of what happens before and after fermentation due to 
expansion and contraction of air/liquids.  A fraction of an ounce of 
water from the bubbler might land in the bottom of the bucket before 
fermentation.  And at the end of the blowoff period another air 
contraction could suck up a little ? (I guess it's beer), if the blowoff 
tube extended to the bottom of the bucket.  Nothing would happen if the 
tube was flush with the lid.  


A "double bubbler" (?) type  commonly found for winemaking that would 
work in both directions might work well.  By having a reversible (larger 
bulbs/longer necks) bubbler, only air would be drawn into the bucket 
during any suck back.  The same would be true of a "coiled tube bubbler" 
with elongated (upwards) coil(s).  The vertical portion of the tubing 
must be sufficiently long and wide enough to allow the water to fall back 
to the bottom.  During times of rest or blowoff an empty coiled hose 
(Pasteur swan neck flask like) would suffice. ASCII below


For air purists a filter would would remove particulate matter, beasties, 
etc during a potential suck back/contraction phenomenon and have no water 
to suck back to boot.  A sterile cotton filter could be fashioned from 
an old margerine tub, a tube, and sterile first aid type cotton.  
Perforate the tubs bottom and stick a tube in.  Sanitize the body and 
replace the cotton (aseptically), packing it firmly to remove air channels, 
on a regular basis.  That should work or you can just buy premade filters.

BTW my blowoff bucket is 1gal/6gal  but the bucket size would be 
proportional to amount fermented, how active the yeast culture is, and the 
"foaminess" of the blowoff.  You could also use a small (1 gal) jug if 
you have the right sized 2 hole bung.  You can use siphon tubing if their 
are no chunks in your wort to clog, as suck backis not a problem.


Sorry about my presumption and lack of explanation before.  I figure 
since I know what I'm talking about so do you. My mistake, not yours
looking at this explanation my first one "maybe" a little short.:)

Subject: homebrew on campus


I felt that as a long-time college student (10 years worth) I needed to
respond to Harry Bush's recent post. In fact, IMO, a college campus IS a
breeding ground for communism, atheism, etc. Fortunately, very little of that
leaks out into the real world, mostly through govt. jobs and the ACLU. What
is far worse is that a college campus is a huge pit of IRRESPONSIBLE
BEHAVIOR! The most likely suspects for homebrewing IMO would be the Frats
which would greatly worry me. Starting in San Diego, I have seen Frats in
trouble for raping drunken women (SDSU, PKA) and recently here at U. Texas,
there has been a death related to drinking and hazing. Not a good record. I
may be overstating the danger since price would still be a factor, the
cheaper the better for most, but higher alcohol levels and not getting carded
might be tempting.
But I do have a legitmate question. I am an extract brewer with some grains
that I steep. In my last batch (red ale w/ .75# Munich and Cara-M malts) I
squeezed the grain bag and let the thick stuff drip into my wort. Is this
proper? Should I have been doing this all along? It would be nice to know
since I am the homebrew supply for my church's choir. The choir director just
loves me as each batch is finished.


Thanks for the space, don't be too harsh about my opinions.

Subject: Elements/Milk Cans/campus/Chiller cleaning


Hey Guys a few more points,


Electrical elements in the basement (3 points)
        1) The standard burners for the kitchen probably are inadequate 
        so try a restaurant supplier they will probably have something 
        powerful enough
        2)Gas burners-already discussed recently, I wouldn't use propane 
        indoors.  Do you have natural gas hooked up?
        3)The english have the BRUHEAT (110 or 220v) basically a coiled 
        electric(hot water tank) element + thermostat in a bucket.  It might
        caramelize your wort but should do the job (?)
        -Oh yeah stoelting has a nice one for only $629 (ouch!$), let me 
        know if you want the number:)


Milk Cans
Try your local dairy/dairy processing plant (the older ones) if you 
haven't already.  I would stop by the dock or maintenace shop first 
(side/back).  They will really know what is in the company "scrap" 
equipement heap.  If your lucky you will find an old timer who will tell 
you about when they hauled all the milk in SS cans from the farm to the 
dairy on a truck.  Now they are hauled in tanker trucks (hence your 
visit). They may also have some "scrap" pots/tubs/whatever that could 
make a mighty nice SS kettle.  A lot of the equipement at a dairy plant 
could make some awful nice beer.  If you just stop in at the office,and 
it's busy, they may just say no since they don't really know to start 
with.  It's worth the trip around the back if you can get what they will 
eventually scrap for peanuts. 


Campus Brewing
Yep, making beer in the dorms is very frowned upon, but lots of students 
live off-campus.  If your state drinking age is 21 and undergrads arrive 
at what, 17-18 it would be a hard hill to climb especially in the bible 
belt.  Here (Ontario) things stack up a little differently, drinking age 
is 19 and most undergrads will be legal by the end of first year.  So 
instead of a theoretical 1/4 we have a 3/4 audience. (grade 13= 18+ yrs 
at registration on average)  As a matter of fact there is a wine club run 
by a faculty member.  So my point is (what is my point? Oh yeah) that 
depending on drinking age locally you can make a stab at the chance of a 
sanctioned club being allowed.  So if your state/province drinking age is 
low enough you've got a chance.  For instance Quebec 18 year olds get 
their first official kick at the can, as well as some very happy 18 year 
olds who live across the border and get a year or three headstart on 
their geographically impaired cousins.  Which brings up another point why 
can you vote, die for your country blah blah blah, but must wait another 
1-3 years to have a beer legally?  I probably now the answer but it seems 
stupid just the same.


Chiller Sanitation  
Iodophor seems to be the weapon of choice, chlorine is just to 
corrosive.  I have been running steam through mine and just felt like 
saying so. :)  


See ya later,                                Rob

Subject: Root/ginger beer


I have seen references to root beer and ginger beer recipes that result in a
sweet, carbonated, mildly alchoholic beverage. I have not been able to actually
find one of these recipes. The commercial recipes appear to be quite dangerous,
in that one must rely on chilling the fermenting wort to the point that the
yeast settles or flocculates out, then pour off the clear, carbonated,
non-yeasty decantation and bottle it. NO THANK YOU!! If there were ever an
invitation to an explosion that method must be it.


Does anyone have a tried and true --i.e. non speculative, non-mythological--
recipe for root beer and/or ginger beer. I would expect a successful method to
work for both. Please do not quote the Cat's Meow as I can't get there from
CompuServe.

I wasn't going to tell anyone, but this happened to me once.  ;-)  It
was about 1 or 2 am when I noticed I forgot to prime, too.  Even though
this batch actually ended up being one of my best, I didn't get much
sleep that night. 


I CAREFULLY poured everything back into the priming bucket.  I figured
I was out the crown caps anyway, so I might as well be sure I got the
right amount of priming in each one.  In my case, it was a bock so that
might have helped mask any oxidation.  Since this worked for me, I'd
recommend it.  As Mike suggested, once you do this once, you really
should not ever forget it again!  Too many homebrews that night is
my only excuse.  ;-)
