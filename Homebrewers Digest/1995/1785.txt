Most of the time I don't use any finings, but my weizen looked really
hideous so I decided to prime with gelatin.  Since I was almost out
of HB, I didn't use a secondary either and it was really cloudy in
the keg--I had hoped it would clear in the keg but it didn't.  I
just boiled about 2-3 oz of water to sanitize it, dissolved a package
of Knox gelatin in that, cooled it and added it to the keg.  A day
later the beer is much clearer and it definitely improve the look of the
beer.  Perhaps it will clear some more--I only added the gelatin last
night.


WYeast 3068 is incredibly violent.  This has been a great experience BTW
trying my hand at a weizen for the first time.  At first I didn't know
if I would really like it, but it's starting to grow on me.  Fermentation
was a trip--temp fluctuated from about 60F to 70F usually around 65F
and I had to insulate the plastic fermenter with a foam jacket since
the only way to keep it relatively close to 68F for me was to put it
in the fridge during the day and leave it out in the garage at night.
It would have been impossible to ferment this way without the "fermometer" 
type thermometer on the outside of the fermenter or if I had hit a heat
wave.  I know the temp is supposed to be kept constant, but this
worked well enough for me and I have a good balance (IMHO) of banana
and clove flavors in the beer.  Perhaps a bit on the clove side, but
my beer is not ruined.  ;-)

Tim,


    I have also had problems chilling runnoff samples until my dad came 
up with the solution:


    We have an old plastic 1 gallon milk jug with the top cout out (but 
not the handle) to form a large scoop.  We grab some runoff in this 
(just enough to fill the hydrometer glass) and drop the jug into a 
plastic carboy that is filled with water and maybe some ice.  If you 
swirl the milk jug in the ice water this will cool the two or three 
ounces of runoff in just a minute.  Presto! Accurate reading soon 
enough that you haven't dropped the CURRENT runoff readings somewhere 
down below the OG of water!!

I too received a mailing for a "Brewery Contest".  Whether it was a "scam" or
simply good advertising for selling a business, I do not know.  The secret
for understanding whether this is a random drawing as opposed to a "skill" or
"judged" event is in the name.  To use the word "Sweepstakes", the sponsor
must follow federal laws which require that it be a random drawing.   While
fraud can still occur in a sweepstakes it is relatively rare in comparison to
a "contest". While fraud is illegal, the rules for a "contest" are not very
restrictive. In my mailing, there was an entry fee of $100.00 and an essay
required.  In sweepstakes, you will find no fees and " No purchase Required"
in the rules.  While the contest sounded appealing, I stick to sweepstakes.

Subject: Alcohol swabs


In HBD #1777 Ken B. mentions using leftover alcohol swabs for sanitizing 
yeast packs and such.


In HBD #1778 Mark K. Adds: "...alcohol is merely used as a solvent 
to make sure the skin is clean and does not guarantee sterility."


For My two-cents: Maribeth Raines (in her article "Methods of 
Sanitation and Sterilization", Brewing Techniques, Vol. 1, No 2) states
that alcohol is a -sanitizing- agent that is useful to home brewers.
Alcohol kills bacteria by denaturing proteins and disrupting their cell
membranes.  She also states isopropyl and ethyl alcohol are best at
disinfecting.  The chart that accompanies the article shows, however,
that the contact time required for alcohol is 10-30 minutes.


I would highly recommend this article to ALL homebrewers as it talks
about most all methods of sanitation.

Subject: Blowoff hoses


FWIW, here is a fairly simple way to assure that you don't suck back liquid 
into your fermenter via the blowoff hose.  If you are using a glass carboy 
get yourself a piece of clear plastic hose big enough to just fit the inside 
of your carboy's mouth (I think 1"ID should work).  Stick the other end into 
a small glass (vice bucket) and add enough water to just cover the end.  As 
the water gets sucked into the hose the end will become uncovered and and air 
bubble will enter breaking the vacuum and causing the water that's in the 
hose to partially fall back into the glass.  If you make sure that the 
internal volume of the hose is several times the volume of water in your 
glass you'll be safe.   Now this won't work with hose smaller than 1/4 inch 
unless the amount of water you use is very small and the inflow is very slow 
because the water has too much surface tention.  The slug of water will just 
get sucked in but larger diameter hose should be safe.  For hoses between 
1/4" and 1" the bigger the hose is the more flow it can take before the water 
gets sucked in.  If you wish to use a bucket you can substitute one as soon 
as your yeast starts working and you get outflow. 


Now if you're using a plastic bucket the same process will work but you'll 
have to decide how to put a larger hose on it.  The larger hose also has the 
advantage of not getting plugged with hops as easily (for those who dry hop 
in the primary).

===> Russell Mast comments about water under pressure:


>Water's always under _some_ amount of pressure.  If they had a 250F water

At any particular temperature, water has a certain vapor pressure.  As
you heat water, the vapor pressure will increase.  When the point at
which the vapor pressure of the water equals the ambient (atmosphere)
pressure is reached, boiling occurs.  That is, in fact, the definition
of the boiling point.  For water, it has a vapor pressure of 14.7 psi
at 212^F.  In order to achieve a water temperature (for pure water) of
250^F, you need to close the system and keep it under pressure.  There
is one and only one vapor pressure of water at 250^F and you need to
have this pressure present in order to get water to this temperature.
You could, of course, have higher pressures (not of water), but you
need this pressure at a minimum.

That's the right one.  It should say something on the box about keeping
drinks hot or cold for hours.

(hmmm 'Lead Free' on my beer labels. Might work to keep the riff/raff out
of my homebrew...:-)


I wasn't going to comment; but, considering all the notes on pregnancy and
homebrew I figured God would punish me if I didn't get involved.
Do you remember the stories about Ancient Rome and the leaded glazes they
used on eating/drinking utensils? The acidic nature of the foods consumed
leached the lead into the food/drink(wine especially). I've read that the
drop in fertility (coupled with the drop in IQ's) was the result of the lead
glazes being leached.
Have you noticed how every HBD has someone asking about water chemistry?
And the questions acidity of the mash/sparge/boil/ferment? Yep you're going 
to leach lead into your brew.  If you plan on serving your beer to anything 
other than snails: avoid using that whirlpool in brewing.
$10.00 is not a bad loss. Kids IQ points (and lack of viable sperm/eggs if 
you ever want to have any children) would be a great loss.


Maybe the junkyard will buy it back for $5.00?


I bought my 1st straight sided keg from a scrapyard for $15.00, keep looking
you'll find one.

London Well 1


This is the twelfth in a series of posts on the formulation
of waters similar to those of famous brewing cities of the world. They
are based on ion concentration profiles given by Dave Draper in
his post in #1704 (10 April 95). See my  post "Water Series" (#1763) for
explanatory material (correction: in the Line 3 explanation read 1.8 ml of
1 N sulfuric acid, not 18 ml). Quick reminders: all ion concentrations and
salt quantities are in ppm which is the same as mg/l. The water to
which the salts are added is assumed to be ION FREE (i.e. it is
DISTILLED WATER or REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER).


The London Well 1 profile is from Westerman and Huige, "Fermentation
Technology". It is a problem profile like several of the others we have had
in that its anion/cation ratio is very unbalanced at pH 7 but in this case
the imbalance is not, as is usual case, because there is insufficient
carbonate for the calcium but because there is insufficient sulfate and
chloride to balance the sodium and magnesium reqirements. Nevertheless
there is a large anion deficit and the only sensible way to make that up
that we know of is to let the carbonate float as we have done before.


Even when this is done we need to use the full complement of salts to get
good approximations to the desired levels of the other ions (the best we
can do with less is about 27% rms error). The result is:

 No permanent hardness. Temporary hardness:      5.23 mEq;    261.47 ppm as
CaCO3


This formulation results in carbonate more than twice the specified amount but
we could deal with this by using the carbon dioxide method we have used before
and letting CO2 escape to the point where carbonate was about where we want it.
This would be at a rather high pH.


We do not recommend this profile for London style beers because of the
difficulties the average brewer would experience in obtaining some of
the required salts. We do have an alternative formulation which is taken
from "Porter" by Terry Foster and will post that as London Well 2 very
soon.

While the volume of a solution is typically less than the sum of the
volumes of the things you mix to make it, there is usually at least a
little increase in volume upon dissolving something in a liquid.


Most generally, the volume of a solution can be the same, higher or lower
than the volume of the original liquid, depending on interactions between
the liquid and dissolved substance.  Physical chemists quantify the effect
by measuring the "partial molal volume" of a solute, and the number varies
for different solvents and solutes.  Sugar in water has a positive partial
molal volume, so the solution volume is higher than the original water.

 Summer in the city
    There have been some posts about fermenting in summer heat.  Take some 
 inexpensive steps to combat that heat!  The *high* temperature end for 
 most ale yeasts is 72F.  A few wildcat esters might make your brew 
 tantalizingly unique, but I'd definitely try to stay under 80F.
    Take advantage of the old HBD tactic evaporative cooling.  Place your 
 carboy in a large bucket or plastic trashcan and fill with enough water to 
 cover 1/2 to 3/4 of your carboy - don't let it float!  Cover the fermenter 
 with a cloth (Tshirt, sheet, ect.) that drapes into the water.  This 
 method works best in non-humid climates, or in an area with a 
 dehumidifier; expect around a 10F drop in temperature.  It also resists 
 temperature shifts better.
    For that extra boost, drop ice or freezer packs in the water.  Maybe a 
 fan blowing on the carboy as well.  Buy a fridge, new or used, and attach 
 one of those $60 temp controllers (now you can lager!).  Excavate that 
 basement you've been meaning to build.

 Iodophor shelf life:
    Folks have mentioned that they store equipment in an Iodophor solution. 
 I've noticed that after a week the tint of the solution fades and once saw

 age well.  Does anyone have the facts on how long an Iodophor solution 
 remains effective?

  I think the standard temperature correction formulae are linear
approximations of a non-linear process. In any event, the gravity cutoff
value of 1.008 is a corrected reading.
  In addition to using the hydrometer, you can also use your palate to
determine when to stop collecting wort. In my experience, when the corrected
gravity reading hits about 1.015, there's just a little sweetness in the
flavor of the runoff. There follows a phase where the runoff starts to taste
pretty much like hot water, no sugar detectable. The hydrometer reads about
1.010 - 1.008 at this point, so there's *something* in solution, maybe even
sugars below the taste threshold. I generally stop sparging at this point. If
I continue, after a few minutes I start to notice a slight tannic flavor, the
runoff starts to taste like weak, hot tea.
  Palates vary from person to person, so YMMV, but if you're sure the rough
malt flavors you're getting are from oversparging, this decidely unscientific
method can help. If you stop sparging before tasting tannin in the runoff,
you won't get it in your beer.

  A couple of comments. First, Special B is not the right malt for this style.
It is essentially crystal malt, but has a Lovibond rating of ~220. It will
contribute too much color and sweetness for an APA.  A half-pound of two-row
crystal rated at 40L-60L is about right for a 5 gallon brewlength.
  Also, Wyeast 1084, while a great yeast for stouts and porters, is not the
right yeast for the style. It is not attenuative enough, and leaves a fair
amount of diacetyl as well. I suspect the high residual sweetness you are
getting is as much due to the yeast as to the grain bill. You'll get closer
to the style with Wyeast 1056.

Whoah.  What country are you from?  This is definately a regional thing.  Most
people who have an objection to homebrewing that _I_ know consider college an
honorable, respectable, and desiarable thing.  This is a midwest thing, maybe.


Also, we're not trying to convince any hard-asses that homebrewing is okay, 
we're trying to convince regular people (especially college chicks) that what 
we're doing is classy or at least interesting, and that homebrewers aren't a
bunch of swilling swine too cheap to spring for Budwiper.

Definately.  Not just liberal, though.  In the Northeast, most of your 
conservatives are probably Catholic, and have a much less judgemental view
of alcohol than conservative protestants.  Most conservatives in the midwest
and south are protestant.  Sure, there's a wider range of alcohol-tolerance 
amongst protestant sects than amongst yeast strains, but all in all alcohol
has less respect here.  Alcohol itself is perceived as a crude thing for 
low-class people, beer even more so.


On the whole, homebrewers are neat people.  (Even if you include those that
listen to Rush, Gott-help-them.)  There are a lot of neat people who don't
make their own beer, but could, if they only knew how cool it was.  Then, I'd
have more people to trade brews with.


It's not something to get upset about, but I think that working towards 
greater acceptibility and understanding of our craft can only do good.

Hi All,


I recently (7/3/95) brewed an Imperial Stout that at bottling time had an
overpowering grapefruit taste.  I mean STRONG!! I couldn't taste anything else.
I don't know if it was due to the receipe or my technique or what.  I'll give a
run down on what I did and maybe some kind person can help me out.


I used:


9 lb  "Dutch" amber dry malt extract
1 lb Medium Brown Sugar
1/2 lb roasted barley
1/2 lb chocolate barley
4 oz Northern Brewer hop pellets AA 8.8%
2 oz Cascade hop pellets AA 5.4%
1" piece of brewers licorish
1 tsp irish moss
Wyeast #1084 Irish Ale yeast


I steeped roasted/chocolate barley in 1 gal 160 deg F water for 30 min, strained
into kettle, and sparged with 1/2 gal 170 deg F water.  Added an additional gal
of water and brought to a boil.  Removed from heat and dissolved extract and
sugar, returned to burner and brought to boil. Added licorish and Northern
Brewer hops.  Added irish moss at 45 min. Boiled for 55 min and then added
Cascade hops.  Boiled for additional 5 min and cooled in ice water bath. (total
boil 60 min)
Strained cooled wort into 2.5 gal of previously boiled and cooled water in
primary fermenter (6.7 gal plastic, closed fermentation).  O.G. 1.078. Pitched
yeast directly from smack pack at 78 deg F.  Active fermentation noticable after
12 hours.  Primary fermentation was at approx 72 deg for five days.  Racked to
secondary (5 gal glass) S.G 1.042, tasted fruity but not overpowering.  After 13
days total, all fermentation activity ceased. Bottled with 3/4 cup honey. F.G.
1.030.


Sorry this is so long, but I wanted to get all the info here.  I know Cascade
hops are supposed to have a grapefruit taste but this is crazy.


TIA,

Subject: Beer stone and vinegar


     Over the past several months, my 33qt enamel-on-steel kettle developed 
     beer stone deposits.  I did not want to get too rough on scrubbing it 
     because I thought I may chip the enamel.  As suggested in the HBD, I 
     soaked it in vinegar (versatile stuff these days...).  After a day, I 
     checked it, and it did not appear to be any better, so I left it for 
     several days.  The good news is that the beer stone practically wiped 
     off with a rag.  The bad news is that the internal connection to my 
     spigot (part of my Easymasher) turned greenish and corroded.  The 
     green stuff came off OK, but the corrosion and pitting are there to 
     stay.  This was not submersed, or even touching the vinegar; it is 
     mounted approximately an inch above the bottom of the kettle.  I 
     suppose the fumes from the vinegar were enough to do the damage.  I 
     had no idea that vinegar was that strong.  Looking back, I should have 
     scrubbed it out after the first day (or just lived with the deposits).

Actually, what I meant to say (although looking back at my post, it was
not clear) was that it *might* improve conversion if you run the flaked
barley through a mill and I would *only* run it through a mill if you had
a true roller mill and if you *did* run it through a rollermill, I would
recommend setting it to a close spacing since the flakes are already quite
flat.  I don't believe that milling flaked barley is absolutely necessary
and it may not help improve extraction at all.

First of all, unmalted grains taste different from malted grains.  I asked
Pierre Celis why he uses unmalted wheat in his White and Grand Cru and he
said because malted wheat tastes different from unmalted.  Also, there is
definately a different protein profile in unmalted grains since part of the
reason for malting is to break down the protein matrix which binds the starch
in the endosperm.  This fact was my reasoning for why milling would help
increase the ease of conversion.  Also, since there would have been no
beta-glucan breakdown which occurs during malting, I expect the beta-glucan
content of unmalted grains to be higher than that of malted grains.  This
can be double-edged sword.  Please note that all of this is speculation on
my part, based upon my knowledge of the malting process and if I had my copy
of Malting & Brewing Science here with me, I would have tried looking
this up (however, I don't recall there being any data on the beta-glucan or
protein content of unmalted grains).  Oh yes -- there would certainly be
less melanoidins in unmalted grains, less toasty, caramelly, flavours --
but you could have guessed that, no?

>I am confused. Several people have responded to Sergio's post saying that the

Let's see if I can help to clarify things a little bit. In the calculations
that I presented, there was no error. But they didn't match with the ones
presented by Martin Manning in his article in BT, because we were
calculating DIFFERENT things. The reason was that he was disolving sugar in
ENOUGH water to make a gallon of solution (what he calls, and I agree,
yield), while I was disolving the same amount of sugar IN one gallon of
water (what Dave Miller calls, at least in a couple of places in his books,
yield. Dave Miller also makes a correct definition in a different page of
one of those books. See my last post for exact references). Now, for John's
question. A gallon is a gallon, no matter of what. It's a measure of volume
(rather odd, I'd say, since I think in metric units), so a gallon of water
is the same volume as a gallon of water with sugar, milk, CO2 or peanuts.
But if you have a gallon of water, and then add something to it, you'll have
MORE than one gallon. If you compare this to LESS than a gallon of water to
which you added the same amount of that something, producing exactly 1
gallon of water+something, then your results won't match. 


>I thought I learned in high school that a Solution does not change its volume

Well, it obviously does change. What happens is that the volumes are not
additive (if I mix 1 gallon of water and 1 gallon of syrup, I won't have 2
gallons of water+syrup, but I'll have more than 1 gallon of the mix). If you
dissolve 1/2 barrel of syrup (yes, well may be you can't disolve it all...)
into 1 liter of water, will you still have only 1 liter of mix?

London Well 2


This is the thirteenth in a series of posts on the formulation
of waters similar to those of famous brewing cities of the world. They
are based on ion concentration profiles given by Dave Draper in
his post in #1704 (10 April 95). See my  post "Water Series" (#1763) for
explanatory material (correction: in the Line 3 explanation read 1.8 ml of
1 N sulfuric acid, not 18 ml). Quick reminders: all ion concentrations and
salt quantities are in ppm which is the same as mg/l. The water to
which the salts are added is assumed to be ION FREE (i.e. it is
DISTILLED WATER or REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER).


This profile does not come from Dave's list but rather from Terry Foster's
monograph "Porter" (Brewer's Publications, Boulder, 1992) in which it is
found on p74. It is stated to be for well water and is comparable to
the London Well 1 profile in calcium and sodium content. Magnesium is about
1.5 times higher,carbonate about 1.6 times higher, and chloride and
sulfate are about double. The author mentions that he has rounded the
numbers and not checked for balance. The balance is not that good but is
certainly better than that of the London profiles from Westerman and Huige.

with the weights for sodium and chlorine:

This formulation just meets our error limitation of 15% in sodium but is other
wise reasonably close. As London is usually associated with darker beers we
assume that the external acid can be ignored, being supplied by the malt. Not
all the calcium carbonate might be dissolved untill the water is added to the
malt in this case. One may, of course, use lactic or carbonic acid as the
external acid but must be aware that lactic acid has a very distinctive
taste. It is one  that is well known to those who have had a turned pint
pulled for them in a London pub so we advocate the use of carbonic acid
where external acid is to be used. The CO2 process sounds more complex than
it really is. Just bubble carbon dioxide until the chalk is all dissolved.
Then aerate (bubble air) until the pH  gets close to 7 as determined by
inexpensive pH strips.

Given the wide disparity in what constitutes the specification for London well
water it hardly seems that the more accurate representation of this formulation
justifies the trouble of obtaining the extra salts. This formulation also
requires quite a bit more (about double) external acid than the simpler
formulation but it partly makes up for this by being a little less
alkaline (note that it is at pH 7).


All things considered we recommend Formulation I of this posting as the most
reasonable for brewing London beers.

Hey, Collective, a quick question:


Do any of you have recipes (ale, stout, lager -- no lambics) using
pears, pear nectar, or pear juice?  A friend tried some several 
yeas back and hasn't yet stopped raving about it.  I've gotten a bit
curious myself.


Tried the usual sources (Cat's Meow, etc.)  


I'm not all-grain yet, but I might try it with the right recipe.


TIA,
