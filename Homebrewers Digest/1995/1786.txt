I am with Dion, here too. I have been using welding oxygen for several years
with
very good results.  In fact going to pure O2 rather than air has been the single
most important improvement I made in my brewing. It really helps that yeast get
growing.


I using welding CO2 also for what it is worth.  I have a 50 pound tank,
lasts about
a year and I use it for lots of things.


For oxygen, in general, there are three grades, Industrial, USP, and Aviator's 
breathing. All three grades are 99.5% minimum purity with the Industrial and
the USP being the same gas with a maximum moisture of 50 ppm. and a dewpoint
of  -54 F.  The aviator's breathing O2 has a maximum moisture of 6 ppm and a
dewpoint of -83 F.  So what is the difference between the Industrial
(welding) and the USP.  Nothing except that
by law the cylinder that contains the O2 can never have been used for anything 
except O2. Since the other possible welding gases that use the same type of
cylinders
are argon, helium and nitrogen I don't worry very much.


Almost the same story for CO2 but that is for another tread.

When you do the FTP get from the archives, leave off the .Z from the
file name and the FTP server will automatically decompress the file
before sending it.  Thus if the file is named "my_file.txt.Z", use the
following command:

No religious thread support intended.  Thanks for all the "Trouble
decompressing HBD Archive file" responses.  I got alot.  Will try each
suggestion in order and go with the first one that works.  Also, alot of
support for my moldy beer situation.  I was encouraged.  Several e-mails
asked that I keep them posted. So....while generating positve thoughts, I
popped off the airlock to bottle the beer and, despite the thin top layer of
mold (or possible yeast stuff as one suggested), the beer smelled GREAT!
 Even tasted like beer.  Final proof to come in 2 weeks at tasting.  Who said
a little mold was a bad thing (smile). As usual, patience and a worry-free
attitude prevail.
Thanks all

Subject: Challnger/foamy bottling/ChemPro


Each question answered seems to generate three new ones:


Q1:  used Challenger hop plugs for a Bass bastardization (thanks Pumazed!)
but could only order 7 oz from Williams Brewing.  Now I have 5 oz left over
with no idea what recipe to use them in.  Anyone have a good ale recipe that
uses Challenger?  


Q2:  "A run for cover ferment"  caused me to lose almost one gallon of beer
to blowoff.  Woke up in the A.M. to find the kitchen counter covered in
blowoff beer.  Ouch!  Gestimated priming sugar for the now only about 4
gallons at 1 cup DME (since 5 gal gets 1 1/4).  However, at bottling each
bottle was topped by a head; no matter how carefully I filled.  Never had
this happen before using a filler.  Anticipate problems or just good beer?


Q3:  Am I the only one in the world to use Chem-Pro cleaner/sanitizer.  Its
what my local store carries (also Williams Brewing) but I never hear of
anyone else using/referencing it.  Anyone have an opinion (silly question
asking homebrewers if they have an opinion).  Is it an effective sanitization
choice?


P.S. In response to the blowoff liquid thread, I was told to use, and so do
use, Potassium or Sodium metabisulfide in my blowoff vessel water.  It
"inhibits" bacterial growth.  Anyone use this? And why should I continue or
discontinue using it?


If you all come over, I've got a good Bass Bastardization for you to try -
not enough chairs though.

Well, caustic soda is a good thing to try, but if yo don't have any, or don't
want to lose a part, try this:


Sprinkle in some ajax (no affiliation, blah) and a little water, then add a
handful of BBs, and swirl it 'round.  They provide enuf grit, and enuf
control, to help scrub it away.  Good luck - and let us know how you handled

Subject:  Does Cara-Pils Contribute to High FG?


        I recently made a batch of brew involving two 3.75 lb. cans of
Cooper's Real Ale, and two packets of the dry kit yeast, re-hydrated.  Had
vigorous fermentation for 2-3 days, then it stopped at 1.024.  I have
re-aerated the wort (probably to the point of terminal oxidation), but
still-- 1.024.  I've also added more dry yeast.  Tonight I'm adding a 1.5
qt. yeast starter, made from Wyeast Ale Blend (1087?).  This is my final
attempt.  After this I will just bottle it, irrespective of FG, and take
my chances. 
        In a recent edition of Zymurgy, someone tested this recipe and
had, if I remember correctly, an FG of 1.012.  My only deviations from the
recipe were adding 4 oz. of wheat malt (my standard addition to every
recipe, for head retention), a pound of crystal malt, and about one-half
pound of cara-pils.  I know cara-pils adds body - that's why I tried using
it for the first time - but does it make for a high FG?
        One more question-- what, exactly is in the Wyeast Ale blend?

A friend asked me the other day is there is a gadget which would tell 
him how much beer is left in his keg.  I usually tell either by weight 
 or by the condensation that forms when you take the keg out of the

Subject: Cloudy Icky Beer


The subject describes it.  I recently made a Cream Ale with Wyeast, 
etc.  It has not settled out in about four days now.  It remains 
orangish and cloudy.  It has a heavy taste that is a little bitter to 
the smell and taste.  You would not want to drink the stuff, it is 
that bad.  This is about the 15th brewing attempt and only the very 
first one and this one have had this problem.  The first one I drank 
because I didn't know any better but this one I will not.  It was 
suspected that the problem with the first batch was the yeast.  Can we
say this for sure, given the sketchy description?  I don't have any 
reading on the beer.  It fermented for 10 days in glass at about 69 
degrees.  I waited until the bubbles in the airlock were more than one 
minute apart.  As I said, this method worked flawlessly on 13 previous
batches so I am hoping it isnt something I did.  If it is I would sure 
like to know.  I hate pouring beer down the drain.  Thanks, Jim

One of the fraternities came into the brew shop, looking for supplies for

Subject: Airlocks/Gott false bottoms


Hi brewers,
I also use cheap vodka in all my airlocks. When placing one in a 'fermenting'
fridge or in a water bath where it is likely to "suck back", a good tip is to
fill your airlock with sterile cotton. (We use a sterile cotton plug in 
laboratory settings for growing cultures.)  Later you can change it over to
cheap vodka (or bleach if thats your choice.)
I use a plastic colander that I trimmed to fit inside my 5 gal. Gott for a
false bottom.  Not a perfect fit (read- I don't whittle well.) but it works
for me.  Cheap, too!
I just finished my summer school Criminal Law final. I am ready to brew!!
I will probably be making my first mead as my house is around 75 degrees F.
Hope to be able to set up a water bath, towel, fan evaporation bath and do
a pale ale yet this summer.  I am really excited to have some brewing time!!
Good luck and good beer,
Sandy C.

Subject: Increasing Alcohol Content


I am a relatively new extract brewer. I received an extract kit through the 
mail for a wheat beer, and the instructions point out that it should yield a 
beer with about a 3.5% A/C. It uses about 5# of liquid malt extract. I would 
like to boost the alcohol content somewhat (maybe to 4.5% or so) without 
significantly altering the flavor the recipe is designed to attain. Some 
reading I have done has lead me to believe the easiest and most inexpensive way
to do this is to add corn sugar. I have about 1# available and I am considering
doing this. Do I need to add extra hops to keep the brew balanced? Is this 
enough corn sugar to make a difference? Any other thoughts? Thanks.

        Scores can and should be changed on the basis of the discussion when wide

Subject: Wort Dilution




Friends,


I am brewing an English Mild for a friend's wedding.  I have a 5 gallon 
brewery, but needed to brew a larger batch to get at least eight gallons. 
 My recipe yielded (after racking losses) about 6 gallons of 1.056 wort.


My first question is, how much water do I add to get a wort of final 
gravity 1.035?  Second, if I add 2.5 gallons of water, what would be my 
starting gravity?  Third, should I dilute before or after fermentation, 
and why?


For those of you attempting to scale up to larger batches with the same 
equipment, be VERY conservative in your estimate of extract efficiency. 
Mine went WAY down when using my mash/lauter tun to full capacity.  I 
didn't have enough room in kettle to adequately sparge.  Also, when 
racking a high gravity wort, you leave behind a lot more extract than a 
more dilute wort.


Thanks for your help!

But I think that the CO3 is far too low.  I'll tell you my reasoning.
London was famous for its dark beers and this was because they had
trouble making pale beers.  The CO3 was presumably too high (at least
I believe that's why -- does someone have other data?).  Now, I have
about 105ppm of CO3 in my water, less Ca than the listed London City
water and can make perfectly good pale ales without any additions of
any brewing salts or acids.  Great conversion with nothing but water
and Pale Ale malt and 30+ ppg.  So what gives?

Subject: RE: Wheat and Wyeast 3944


The other day Mark Kirby asked a couple of questions about the use of
unmalted wheat and wyeast 3944 in Witbier. I have very limited experience
with the use of unmalted wheat (two batches so far) but I have learned
a bit along the way.


I aquired about 30 pounds of wheat direct from a prairie farm and that is
what I used n my first attempt. I can only assume that this will be a very
hard variety as that is what we grow here. I crushed the wheat about the same
as I do malt and soaked it for an hour in hot water prior to mashing with
Canadian 2-row 40%/60% along with some flaked oats as per most recipes. The
result was a trouble free sparge but very poor extraction, almost no
contribution from the wheat. I used rests at95, 120, 126, 130, 154 and 168
deg.F. My usual yields are very respectable but I just could not seem to
convert the wheat.


On the second try I used wheat from a Health Food store and not only crushed
it but boiled the 5 pounds for 15 minutes in 8 quarts of water prior to
mashing in. This time I simplified the mash schedule with rests at 128, 140,
158 and 168. For the extra trouble of boiling I achieved a fractional
improvement in yeild but the result was still dissapointing. 
In both cases, an iodine test indicated complete conversion. (??)


The first batch was fermented with Wyeast 3944 which does Not contribute
any "tanginess" as you suspected Mark, but has the usual clove etc. of wheat
beer yeasts. I am sure that there is no lactcobacillus present in this product.
The second batch was fermented with Blanche de Bruges yeast that I grew from
a bottle. This yeast behaves exactly the same as Wyeast 3944 which is to say
very actively with a large crop of yeast on the surface that lasts for days
and days. I would say that there is a good chance that they are the same.


I am still experimenting at this point but I would say that the wheat should
not be crushed to flour or sparge problems might result. I would also say that
to come up with an authentic tasting Witbier some lactic acid should be added
(pick your own method) or the result will not be sufficiently tart. If anyone
has any ideas on the poor yield I am experiencing with the wheat I would be
grateful for suggestions.

Subject: Beer in Space




Truth is funnier than fiction...


To boldly drink what no man has drunk before...


This week, a million fraternity brothers rushed to join NASA. The
reason: scientists have discovered beer in space.


   Well, not beer exactly. But they did find alcohol: ethyl alcohol, to be
precise, the active ingredient in all major alcoholic drinks (antifreeze
Jell-O shots, quite obviously, are exempted from this category). Three
British scientists, Drs. Tom Millar, Geoffrey MacDonald and Rolf Habing,
discovered this interstellar Everclear floating in a gas cloud in the
constellation of Aquila (sign of the Eagle, the mascot of Anheuser-Busch!
Hmmmmm).


   Millar and his compatriots have estimated the size of this gas cloud at
approximately 1,000 times the diameter of our own solar system; there's
enough alcohol out there, they say, to make 400 trillion trillion pints of
beer. These guys are British, mind you; if you were to translate this in
terms of American beer (which the British, with some justification,
regard as fermented club soda), the amount of potential brewski just about
doubles.


   In human terms: remember that double-keg party you threw at the end of
your Junior year in college (the second Junior year)? Imagine throwing
that same party, every eight hours, for the next 30 billion years. You'd
STILL
have beer left over. And boy, would YOUR bathroom be a mess! Simply
put, no one could ever drink 400 trillion trillion pints of beer, except
maybe L.A. Raiders fans.


The sheer volume of all this alcohol begs the question of how it
managed to get out there in the first place. Despite the simplifying effect
it has on the human brain, ethyl alcohol is a reasonably complex molecule:
two carbon atoms, five hydrogen atoms, and a hydroxyl radical, all cavorting
togetherin beery camaraderie. It's not a compund that is going to
spontaneously arise
out of the cold depths of space. It can lead to speculation: What is this
cloud?


   1. It's God's beer. After all, He worked for six days creating the
universe, and on the seventh day, He rested. And after you've had a hard
week at the office, don't YOU grab a beer? Since man is made in God's image,


it could be that this cloud is the remaining evidence of the first,
best Miller Time.


   2. It's Purgatory ("400 trillion trillion bottles of beer on the wall,
400 trillion trillion bottles of beer! Take one down, pass it around,
399,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 bottles of beer on the wall!")


   3. Proof of an undeniably highly advanced but chronically dipsomaniac
alien society. This particular theory is shaky, however: it's reasonable
to assume that if the aliens were going to construct a nebula of alcohol,
they'd also have large clouds of Beer Nuts and pretzels nearby for snacking.
Advanced spectral analysis has yet to locate them.


   The truth of the matter, however, is far more prosaic. In the middle of
this gas cloud is a young and no doubt quite inebriated star. As the star
heats up and contracts, sucking the dust and gas of the cloud into
a smaller area, complex molecules form as a result of greater intereaction
between the elements. Ethyl alcohol forms on small motes of dust in the
cloud,
and then, as the motes angle in closer towards the star and heat up, the
alcohol is released from the motes in gaseous form. And there you have it:
an
alcohol cloud. Or, as Dave Bowman might say, "My God! It's full of booze!"


   Enough with the science lesson, you say. Just tell me how to GET there!
Sorry, Chuckles. You can't get there from here. The gas cloud (which,
by the way, has the utterly romantic name of "G34.3") is 10,000 light years
away: 58 quadrillion miles. Even if you hijacked the shuttle and headed out
with thrusters on full, by the time you got there, the guy in Purgatory
would be done with his tune. You'd have had time to work up a powerful
thirst, but you'd also be, in a word, dead.


   No, the Space Beer Cloud will have to wait for the far future, when men
can leap through the universe at warp speed. One can only imagine
what they will do when they get there:


Captain Kirk: My....GOD! Sulu! What....is....THAT?


Sulu: It's a free floating cloud of alcohol, sir.


Kirk: And we've just run out of Romulan Ale! Could it be a trap, Bones?


Bones: Damn it, Jim! I'm a doctor, not a distiller of fine spirits!


Kirk: We need that booze! But if we fly through that cloud, we'll
be too drunk to drive!


Spock: May I remind you, Jim, that I am a Vulcan. We are a race of
designated drivers.


Kirk: Well, all righty, then. Spock, drive us through! Bones and
I will be out on the hull. With our mouths... open!

Subject: Reusing trub from first generation...




Fellow HBDers,
 I recently made a batch of all-grain Pale Ale and I used the yeast dregs
from an old bottle that I had which I had started a few days prior to
pitching. Now what I would like to do is brew again in about a week and just 


pour my cooled wort over my trub after I rack to my secondary. I understand
that this is a common practice. Should I expect a krausen to form fairly
quickly after pouring the cooled wort onto the trub? I usually get a fairly
quick krausen to form within 5-8 hours of pitching from the started dregs.
Is it worthwhile to do it this way? I guess I'm saving the time it takes to
make a starter and the cleaning of my carboy. Is the general concensus that
I should just use another bottle of yeast dregs and start it as I did
before? By pouring on top of the trub I would be using another generation of 


yeast as well. I would appreciate experienced replies to this post. Please
send me private email and I will post results. TIA...

Subject: Mycobrewery FungiCider


     This thread is from another part of the web, but I hope HBD can 
     address the brewing aspect.  What if ... mushrooms (ordinary 
     edibles, nothing more) in beer?
     
     What we know:
     >  You concluded that mushrooms have no sugars because they don't 
     photosynthesize.  It's true that they don't photosynthesize, but 
     many mushrooms are in a symbiotic relationship (called 
     "mycorhizae") with host plants nearby in which they receive 
     photosynthetic sugars from the sap of the plant and bring water, 
     phosphorus and minerals to the plant in exchange.  Also, mushrooms 
     grow through their food source and dissolve it with enzymes which 
     break down the source into components such as sugars and amino 
     acids.  Most mushrooms break down cellulose into sugars and 
     re-assemble those sugars into long sugar chains (polysaccharides) 
     that form chitin, which is the main ingredient of a fungus. All 
     this is to say that mushrooms are constructed out of sugar!  But 
     until the polysaccharides are broken down to mono or disaccharides, 
     they don't taste sweet, nor do they feed your yeast extra 
     fermentation food.  So in considering a sweet flavoring from a 
     mushroom, it just won't happen.  But aroma ...
     Since my experience with mushrooms is mainly from eating them, not 
     from just sniffing them, I'll have to conjecture an answer for you. 
     It seems that dried mushrooms yield the most abundant aroma, and 
     they'd be easy to cook up/reconstitute in a more condensed form. So 
     here's my list of possible (but to me, mostly unlikely) candidates: 
     >  Boletus edulis (cepes or porcini) - meaty aroma
     >  Polyporus sulphureus (chicken of the woods) - lemony/true
     >    chicken-like flavor, but also carries eucalyptus oils which 
     >    are toxic to some people.
     >  oyster mushroom - fishy
     >  chanterelle - mild fruity/pumpkin-like Shitake (slightly 
     >    seafoody
     >  Matsutake - a cross between red hots (candy) and sweaty socks - 
     >    very prized by many mushroom hunters. (use w/ brettanomyces?) 
     >  Lepiota rachodes - very distinctly beef-like smell 
     >  Lactarius fragilis (candy cap) - maple syrup
     With the above list, you can make your own decisions.  Personally, 
     I'd only suggest the last mushroom, the candy cap.  Remember that 
     it doesn't taste sweet, it only smells sweet, and it does truly 
     smell like maple syrup!
     
     What we don't know:
     1.  How to convert mushroom polysaccharides into fermentable 
     sugars.  If so, then treat mushrooms as a GRAIN in the mash/boil.  
     If not, then treat mushrooms as a FRUIT/HERB for aroma in the 
     post-primary fermenter.
     2.  WHY we want to attempt this experiment in the first place.  
     (I'm not trying to create a "style" by any means.)

In HBD 1783, Patrick Higgins wrote (regarding a steam beer):


"My question is, if I rack to the secondary and continue fermenting at 70
  degrees, will this greatly effect the flavor?  Or, immediately after
  bottling if I were to place the bottles in the fridge and condition at 45
  degrees, would this work?"


I have made two seperate batches of steam beer now using extracts and various
types of hops (Northern Brewer - boil/Cascade - finish in first;
Nugget/Nugget in second). The first batch was made last summer here in Texas
and was fermented a room temp (75-80) all the way through, while the second
was fermented in my brew fridge at 60-65. First batch came out with a
definite fruity quality instead of the expected bitterness, primarily due to
the temperatures. Second batch came out nicely bitter, no fruit taste. Could
be a factor of the Cascade finishing hops in the first batch, but I think it
was probably the fermenting temps that caused the fruity flavors in batch
one. Still a drinkable brew, however...

Hi, all
A question about aeriation (sp?):  I syphon my chilled wort from a height of
about three feet above my 6 gallon plastic fermentor.  I get a huge crop of
foam which I stir in throughout the syphoning.  I pitch my yeast starter
about half way into the process and usually have about a 10 to 12 hour lag
time `at`80f starting temp.  I'll admit that occasionally the lag time is about
24 hours but in general is reasonable.  Any comments on this method?


I've got a plug for Dave Drapers' yeast culturing instructions.  It could not
be easier or more self-explainetory.  I used it last week with very good
results.  I had one problem which I asked Dave about and received a VERY
prompt reply-Thanks again, Dave!

Munich 1


This is the fourteenth in a series of posts on the formulation
of waters similar to those of famous brewing cities of the world. They
are based on ion concentration profiles given by Dave Draper in
his post in #1704 (10 April 95). See my  post "Water Series" (#1763) for
explanatory material (correction: in the Line 3 explanation read 1.8 ml of
1 N sulfuric acid, not 18 ml). Quick reminders: all ion concentrations and
salt quantities are in ppm which is the same as mg/l. The water to
which the salts are added is assumed to be ION FREE (i.e. it is
DISTILLED WATER or REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER).


This profile is attributed to Noonan in "Brewing Lager Beer" and is also
given by Richman in "Bock". As Richman points out this water is essentially
a solution of chalk with small amounts of other ions. He points out that Munich
Helles Bock brewers precipitate the chalk (with lime) after which the water
is comparable to that of Plzen. Leaving the question as to whether it is foolish
to put something into the water which is only later to be removed to the
individual brewer we offer the following formulation:

 Permanent hardness:      0.18 mEq;      8.84 ppm as CaCO3


This formulation is quite accurate but requires a fair amount (3 mEq) of
external acid to bring the pH of the chalk to 7. This cannot be done
without external acid because the low allowable chloride and sulfate
specifications preclude the use of much hydrochloric or sulfuric acids
(Formulation I, given that external acid is allowed, choses to use neither
of these acids preferring to get sulfate and chloride from salts).


We don't like formulations which require more than the most readily
available salts and so do not recommend this one. As is usually the case in
these circumstances we have an alternative (from Hardwick - to be posted
next) but the alternative  is substantially higher in chloride and in
sulfate to the point where we fear  hops harshness. Therefore we offer the
simple salts formulation:

We immediately see that the reason the full salt set was required was to keep
magnesium in spec and that by using the simple salt set we sacrifice magnesium
accuracy but maintain all the other ions pretty close to their desired levels.
As this formulation supplies plenty of magnesium from the point of view of
yeast
requirements and keeping Richman's remark about Plzen water in mind we feel
that
this formulation is probably a pretty good one for the brewing of Munich lagers.
We expect that the 2.4 mEq additional hydronium requirement could be met by
the malt in most cases.

This is not entirely true. The grain sorghum used to brew African opaque
beer is malted. The adjuncts used in the brewing process (corn grits and
millet primarily) are indeed unmalted.

      I'm not an expert on this, but the whole subject of the cited 
      article is how they are now brewing with 100% unmalted grains
      including sourghum. In 1988 the Nigerian government banned the
      import of malt and apparently grain suitable for malting will
      not grow in their climate.


      I have no interest in brewing with sourghum. I posted this in 
      response to several requests for info about malting barley.     
      With auxiliary enzymes, available in your local homebrew store
      maybe malting your own barley is unnecessary.
