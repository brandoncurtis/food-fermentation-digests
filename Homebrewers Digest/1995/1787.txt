I was told that the addition of flaked barley to a Dry Irish

Indeed ..  and in chemistry terms (if you want to go and look up

I am not going to comment on polyclar and silica gel as "I KNOW 
NOTHING" to quote Sgt.  Schultz, but I have recently managed to 
sort out the whole gelatin / isinglass thing in my head.  


Isinglass is used in real-ale kegging coz you can fine with it, 
it will clear your beer and then when you move it again (round 
you cellar perhaps) it will clear your beer again when stirred up. 


Gelatin will not do this, it is a once only "beer-kleer" (tm)


;)


*So* gelatin should be used in secondaries and not in bottles and 
kegs (unless you think they'll stay reasonably still!), so you 
can rack off ...  the beer (did any of our US bretheran get that 
joke?) from the "gook" (that's technical brew talk) before it 
gets stirred up again.  


Apparently Gelatine also only works at below 10degC ..  so to use 
it effectively you'll need to use it in your secondary *and* keep 
it cold.  


Cheers

Well, I made a pear beer once, and it was my second finest beer so far
in fifty batches.


St. Patrick's Pleasant Pear Ale (started on St. Patrick's Day)


Use Wyeast German Ale yest.


1/2# 40L crystal steeped from cold to 180F in 2gal water, then rinsed
and removed.  3# Munton-Fisson light unhopped + 3# Laaglander light
unhopped + 1# honey.  At boil + 10 (T+10), add 3/4 oz. 5.2% Cascade.
At T+55 (45 minutes later) add 2t Irish Moss.  At T+70, add 1/2oz
Saaz.  Immersion chill.  Add water to achieve 5 gal.  *Aerate*.
Pitch.


OG = 1.062


After two days, puree 5# pears (actually, I just used a sanitized
potato masher on 5# of pears that I froze earlier in the fall), and
treat with 2 campden tablets.  Rest the pears for 48 hours to clear
the campden.


Two days later (a total of four days), rack the beer onto the pears.
I left the beer on the pears for two weeks, racked again, and bottled
after another month.  FG = 1.010.


The pear wasn't very pronounced at first, but it really evolved in an
amazing way.  After a year, this was the most incredible beer.  I'm
definitely going to make this again this fall.  Of course, these days
I'll do a full-volume boil rather than 2 gallons.  I might even do an
all-grain of it (like our totally, absolutely killer Oatmeal Stout #3,
the best one of 50 batches, probably the best one of 100 batches), but
if I don't, it won't bother me in the least.  This was a *fine* beer.


Cheers!

Subject: Hops harvesting


My 3 year old Tettnang hop plant is producing qute a few cones.
The cones started showing up 3 weeks ago or so, and new cones have been
developing ever since.


Because of the time spread of cone development it is obvious that they won't
all be 'ripe' at the same time.
My question is when to harvest the little buggers?
Should I periodically pick a bunch of cones as they are ready or just wait
until the whole plant is ready.
It seems that by waiting that some of the cones will be past prime.
Picking in small quantities is somewhat of a hassle, but at this point there
aren't that many to deal with.


Any thoughts/experience with this?


Also, what about controlling Japanese  Beetles?

This is my first post ... ever .... to anywhere.  I'm so excited!
I wonder if it's really going to go anywhere when I hit SEND ?
Oh well, wait and see.


I've been lurking for a few months.  I think the HBD is great.
There's stuff for every level of homebrewer.  Everything from "I
forgot to add the can of thick brown stuff to the boiling water.
IMBR ?" to that really boring stuff on water analysis.  I mainly
brew extract with specialty grains.  I have tried all-grain
brewing but my equipment is a bit undersized for an all-grain
5 gal. batch.


Anyway, here's my question.  I'll start with a real easy one and
then work my way up to being a real HBD pest.














What is an EASYMASHER ? I've heard of them but I have never seen

Thanks in advance.

     Beer Folks,
        
     I'm thinking about making a smoked banana beer.  
     
     I can figure out how to get the smoke flavor but I was wondering if 
     anyone had any ideas about how to get the banana flavor.  
     
     I read in the Cat's Meow some guy steeped sliced banana with skin in a 
     nylon bag for 30 minutes.  How will this differ from putting bananas 
     in the secondary?  
     
     What's a good yeast (I was thinking American)?  I don't want this to 
     be a wheat beer.  Hops? Grains? Any ideas.
     
     Feel free to respond by e-mail.  I'll post my final recipe if the beer 
     turns out ok.

Subject: Grapefruit Stout


Jeff asks what could have caused the high grapefruit flavor of his Stout:


I see three things that probably contributed to it besides the Cascade Hops.
(Which really dont make a good Stout hop IMO)
1. You pitched directly from the wyeast pak, without a starter. This tends to
produce a weak initial fermentation, generating more diacetyl and other
secondary compound than would be normally be produced at higher pitching
levels.
2. The yeast was pitched at 78F, this is a bit too high, definite ester
country.
Primary ferm at 72 is still a tad high. I use 65F for Irish yeast.
3. Priming with honey may have contributed because it often has a high aroma
component that could be accentuating the esters.


Give it about two months in the bottle to condition. I am confident that it
will smooth out nicely.

Subject: Deposits on Kettles.




Is it possible that the precipitates in kettles could provide a source of
calcium and other minerals which could be good for beer?  Or bad for beer?  
I've often wondered about this.  Chicago water is chock full of limestone 
and tons of it shows up after evaporation, but in the mildly acidic and very 
hot and active environment of a full boil, perhaps some of it could come into
solution.  Anyone have any numbers on this?


I would imagine that in a fermenter these deposits would be primarily neutral.

OK, John, so how do you react to the blurb in BT about the FDA
"outlawing" brass in contact with food pH < 7 ?  (page 12, v3n4).   Is
this just another one of the FDAs, "Well, we're not sure so we'll just
disallow it" cover their ass schemes??


I use a small number of brass fittings and have always basically
agreed with you in regard to this issue.  I still am not going to
worry, but maybe the FDA has some "proof" behind their "guidelines".
What is really crazy is that this applies to "copper and copper
alloys".  I can maybe understand a cause for concern of lead in brass,
but pure copper???

Subject: chilling samples and carboys/ redundant posts


With respect to the temperature correction of SG thread:
Going to all the hassle of chilling hydrometer samples seems kind of wasteful.
After all, free time during brewing is supposed to be spent drinking, so the
more free time the better. Now I hate doing math on weekends, so fancy
temperature correction formulae don't interest me. And it's not like we need
super accuracy if all we need to know is when to stop sparging. Noonan's
book has a handy table at the back for correcting SG: just subtract the given
number for the temperature of your sample. (subtraction IS math, but it's
easier than multiplication, and can be done without paper or calculators).
If typing weren't such a chore (two fingers only when I really get going), I'd
reproduce this table. Maybe some kind soul on the HBD who can type fast will
help out here. At any rate, even if this is only a first order correction, 
it's probably all the accuracy needed. And tasting works too, as Jim recently
suggested. If you do insist on chilling samples, chill to the correct 
temperature if you really want that accuracy. "It feels chilled" could be off
by a large amount. 
        
****


The wet towel around the carboy suggestion has re-surfaced. One caveat: put
some sanitizing agent in the water, or you could get mould forming in that 
lovely warm, wet environment. Chlorine evaporates after a week or two, and
smells bad. Something iodine based should work.

REDHOOK Blueline Pilsner


I stumbled onto the availability of their new "seasonal" beer here in

The promotional sheet says:


"Our pilsner has very clean and delicate malt flavors with a 
refreshing mouthfeel.  The bouquet is appetizingly fresh from the 
distinctive Saaz hop notes.


"Barley varieties:  2-row Klages, Pilsen, Munich, Cara Pils, and

"Hop varieties:  Tettnagg and Saaz.


"The very special characteristics in this beer are a result of a 
unique mashing.  The fermentable sugars are coaxed from the malt 
through a series of temperature rises in the mash tun.  The resultant 
beer demonstrates a full range of the malted barley flavors.


"There is only a small amount of this beer, it is to be savored.  The 
alcohol content is 4% by weight.  Bitterness Units ar 33.  Lagering 
time = 6 weeks"


- -------------------------------------------------------------------


 My impression?  It is very smooth and delicate.  The hop bitterness 
and flavor is attractive.  I will go to the Trolleyman Pub and have 
another, soon.  
 But, from one who has tasted Pilsner beers in the "old country", 
this one is pretty bland in regards to the malt character.  They make 
it sound like a step-infusion mash is a big deal.  They've got the 
computerized equipment to easily do that.  But can't that equipment 
perform a decoction mash?  It's obvious that the use of the Munich 
and Carastan malts indicates the need for more malt character.


All in all, not a bad effort.  I give it a B+.
I also give the marketing department an A.

BREWING QUESTIONNAIRE


My name is James Gaspar.  I am an architecture student at the 
University of Southwestern Louisiana. I am distributing this questionnaire
in an effort to gather information that will be very helpful to me in 
developing my architectural thesis. This test questionnaire is being posted 
on the Homebrew Digest to reach as broad a range of brewers as 
possible. All responses to this questionnaire will be confidential and will
only be used in my thesis research. *This questionnaire is the property of 
James M. Gaspar and it may not be used for purposes other than the 
collection of data to be used solely by James M. Gaspar.*


This questionnaire is being distributed to individuals like yourself who 
are interested in brewing beer. This includes those who have 
a passing interest, are currently brewing for home consumption, and those 
in the brewpub and microbrewery industry. If you know someone who 
would be interested in completing this questionnaire please make it available 
to them.


DIRECTIONS


The questions are divided into 4 sections:
        If you are a non-brewer, please answer questions 1-4 and 38-51.
        If you are a homebrewer, please answer questions 1-16 and 33-51.
        If you are a brewpub and/or microbrewery brewer, please answer 
        questions 1,2,17-51.


When you respond to a question you need only include the question number
followed by the appropriate response. There are three types of questions, 
each with a specific response. The first question type has a series of 
responses preceded by a letter.
                e.g. 1)What color is your wort?
                        A. black
                        B. green
                        C. you don't want to know


To respond just give the question number followed by the letter of your 
response.        e.g. 1) C


The second question type has responses that do not have letters preceding 
them but are in all capitals.
                e.g. 2) What percentage of your time is spent answering:
                        DUMB QUESTIONNAIRES
                        STUPID QUESTIONS


To respond give the question number followed by your response.
                e.g. 2) 5%,50%


The third question type requires you to answer as completely as possible.
                e.g. 3) What was it like your first time (brewing that is)?


To respond give the question number followed by your response.
                e.g. 3) It was really messy but I liked it and ...

Subject: Copper thickness & type


I few issues ago I posted a message asking about how thick
the copper was in copper kettles and what type of copper they
were made out of. I herewith summarize the results for HBD
readership:
Posted messages- none
email messages- none.


As a research engineer and former scientist at a national
laboratory, I recognize that negative results are just as 
important as possitive ones. So I can say that probably
no one reading HBD knows the answers and definately no one cares 
about the subject. I declare this thread stillborn.

Cara-pils and crystal will both add residual sweetness from 
unfermentable sugars and (consequently) higher FG's. 


Assuming you are making a 5 gal batch, the crystal and cara-pils 
could add about 6 points to your FG (using a hand-waving figure 
of 10 pts/lb/gal). This would get you into the 1018 range for FG,
which is still probably slightly high. 


Theory: This is something that my mate Dave Hansen (who is 
lurking here) came up with, and I agree.  We reckon that the 
yeast that the dried yeast Coopers provides *requires* some 
simple sugars (as suggested in the recipe on the can) to ferment 
out properly ..  or at the very least can't manage to ferment 
alot of more complex sugars.  He had a problem with high terminal 
gravities when using Coopers kits and unhopped LME (and no sugar) 
but didn't have such a problem when using some sugar and some 
unhopped LME with the kit ..  and no problem when he cultured the 
yeast from a Coopers bottle conditioned beer (the yeast they use 
to brew the commercial beer is different to the dried stuff).  


What yeast did the recipe in Zymurgy use (here is where my theory 
bites the big one)?  I would suggets using a WYeast to begin 
with.  Ditch the Coopers dried yeast ..  if it is the same stuff 
as they use here it is not as good as WYeast IMO.  


Cheers

Subject: Airlocks


I know this thread started about "suck back" with blow-off tubes, but it has 
now migrated to airlocks.


So, my usual tirade about using the S-shaped airlocks--they don't suffer from 
"suck back".  I can boil water in a jar, affix an S-shaped airlock, then put 
the container in cool water and watch the air go into the jar through the 
airlock.  No liquid gets into the jar, just bubbles of air.


Seems pretty safe to me.  Enough so that I don't understand the appeal of 
other types of airlocks.

Subject: Cleaning glass -- Hop Q's


Greetings all--


In Thursdays HBD, DocBrew related his methods for cleaning glass 
carboys.  He recommended using AJAX and a couple of BB'S.  This reminded 
me of a method used in restaurants for cleaning coffee stains off of the 
inside of glass coffee pots.  Since the opening on these pots is pretty 
small, it is almost impossible to get a brush inside of them.  Also 
coffee stains are pretty darn hard to scrub out anyway.  What we did to 
clean these was to put a bit of Comet (AJAX etc) in the pot and then 
ICE.  Flaked works best but cubes will do.  Just swirl it around for a 
couple of minutes and rinse. VOILA! clean and uses materials you already 
have.


On another note --
I have been picking hops lately and am amazed at the quantity I am 
getting this year.  5-6 year old bines and lots of rain this spring 
really did a number on my plants. Anyway, I have been thinking about the 
drying of these cones.  I usually dry them in the oven with just the 
pilot going and this works very well.  My question is, what is the 
optimal amount of residual moisture for hops?  Is there a point when they 
are too dry or is this not an real issue?


Thanks in advance for any insight on this subject.


Keep brewing great beer---

work so I could aerate 'em every so-often until they were going.


Anyway, I live on a mountain (~1000 ft heigth - I know, "that
ain't a mountain") and as I was coming down the mountain
I noticed that the airlock was bubbling backwards!  I figured
it was from the increasing atmospheric pressure equalizing
with the head space of the starter bottle, so I turned around
and headed back up the mountain - sure enough the bubbling
reversed (duh).  Fortunately, I use vodka as the airlock fluid
and also stick a sterile (so the package sez) cotton ball in the
mouth of the airlock in case of suck-backs (remember that
thread?)  I figure the cotton is to "try" to filter any airborne
particles in-case of a suck-back.


I never thought about this happening but some of you in the
mountainous areas might give it some thought when you want
to transport anything with an airlock on it for any reason.


What would you do in this case?

Being a fraternity man, I must object to the line of this thread.  Even if
the fraternities wanted to serve homebrew at parties, it's nowhere near
economical.  At any given party, we would go through 12-20 1/2 bbls.  Let's
say you have a party every week, and your brewing turn-around time is 3
weeks.  That means you have to have the capacity to hold 540-900 gals of
beer at a time.  Think of the cost of all that stainless, not to mention the
effort and where the members sleep since their house has been converted to a
brewery, and it ends up being much easier calling your friendly neighborhood
beer distributor and getting $5.40 cases of Jacob Best (or $26 1/2 bbls of
Meister Brau)


Homebrewing, however, is the BEST thing that could happen to a college
campus.  My freshman year I was pretty much a wreck, probably an alcoholic
by most definitions.  That summer, after reading about homebrewing on
BBOARDS (including HBD) I bought Papazian's book and started brewing.  Voila
 - overconsumption cured.  Forcing down the special of the week to get a huge
headache is no competition to enjoying a few homeade brown ales.  The more
exposure inexperienced drinkers have with good alcohol tends to make them
shy from binging.  (I also "Converted" three fraternity brothers to the
"Gospel" of homebrewing while I was at it.)

RE the question about decompressing archive files with a ".z" extension, 
leaving off the ".z" did not work for me running a MAC. I found a pgm 
specifically for decompressing unix files on MACs. However, I found this 
morning what should be a *better* solution for MAC users. Try downloading 
these; available at many sites:  Stuffit Expander (freeware), and DropStuff 
(shareware).  Both from Aladdin systems.  The dropstuff piece says it 
supports decompressing .z files (and allot of other platforms/filetypes).

Hi All,


  In HBD#1786, Don Rudolph asks:


>I am brewing an English Mild for a friend's wedding.  I have a 5 gallon
>brewery, but needed to brew a larger batch to get at least eight gallons.
> My recipe yielded (after racking losses) about 6 gallons of 1.056 wort.


>My first question is, how much water do I add to get a wort of final
>gravity 1.035?


  I brewed an English mild last fall, diluted 11 gallons at ~1.050 to 15
gallons at 1.037. FWIW, I simply multiplied the volume times the gravity,
then divided the result by the desired gravity. In your case:


     6 * 56 = 336 "points"
     336 / 35 = 9.6 gallons
     9.6 - 6 = 3.6


  So, if you add 3.6 gallons of water, you should end up with 9.6 gallons
at your desired gravity of 1.035.


>Second, if I add 2.5 gallons of water, what would be my
>starting gravity?


  You'd still have 336 "points", so, 336 / 8.5 = 1.039. At 1.039, you're
at the high end of the gravity range for the style. Milds typically run
into the mid-1.030s, some even down to the high 1.020s. Use a little more
than 2.5 gallons.


>Third, should I dilute before or after fermentation,
>and why?


  I diluted mine prior to fermentation using water that was boiled, chilled,
and re-aerated, and got good results. If you decide to dilute after
fermentation, be careful not to re-aerate the water.
  I've heard of people fermenting at the higher gravity, then diluting after
fermentation. The idea is that fermenting at the higher gravity produces 
some additional esters, which provides more flavor after dilution. IMHO,
esters are usually sharp flavors (except banana-like esters), and this is
not necessarily a Good Thing(tm) for this style.
  The key to this style is getting body and flavor from low original gravity.
Avoid ingredients that contribute sharp flavors, specifically hops and large
quantities of dark roasted malts, since these things will contribute to the
impression of thin-bodied, watery beer. Use ingredients and procedures that
make the beer seem more full-bodied than it really is. Here are some steps
that I took:


1) grain bill - I limited the amount of chocolate malt to 3% of the grain
bill, I wouldn't recommend more. About 15% of the grain bill was 80L crystal
malt. *DON'T* use roasted barley or black patent.


2) hops - I targeted only 22 IBUs, no late additions. With such a low gravity
beer, you won't need any more than this. Make sure to calculate IBUs for
the *final*, post-dilution volume.


3) extend the boil - I boiled 2 hours, the extra boil time produces some
caramelization, which helps contribute rounded, sweetish flavor.


4) use a yeast that leaves some diacetyl - diacetyl is a buttery, rounded
flavor that will also help contribute to the impression of a full-bodied beer.
Wyeast 1084 would be a good choice. I used the Samuel Smith Tadcaster yeast,
which is absolutely a diacetyl factory. :-)


  I was very pleased with the way this beer turned out, it had a surprising
amount of body and malt character, yet with a gravity in the mid-1.030s,
was very quaffable.


           Cheers,
            Jim               dipalma`at`sky.com
