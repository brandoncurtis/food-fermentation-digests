Subject: seeking advice on beer body


Hello:
        I have a couple of simple questions that I have been struggling with
for some time.  Some advice will be greatly appreciated!
        My beer has been criticized for 'low body' several times (contests
many months apart/ differnt beers each time).  I don't think that the body
is thin!  
        Question number one: what is body?  Maybe I just don't know what
body is!  How do I determine it?  That is, do I swirl the beer in my mouth,
let it sit on my tounge for a short time... 
        Here is a complete account of this batch of an IPA: 6 lbs Munton and
Fison DME, 1 lb Munich malt, 1/2 lb crystal (40L), 1/2 lb cara pils.  I
steeped the grains for 1 hour in 2 gallons of water at 170 degrees F, rinsed
the grain (raised/ lowered nylon bag several times), brought to a boil and
added 1 ounce Fuggles (AA 4.5%), another 1/2 ounce at 40 minutes, then 1/2
ounce at end of boil.  Cooled in an ice water rabth, then poured into carboy
with 3 gallons cold water.  Pitched yeast cake form previous batch (Wyeast
1084: British).  Active fermentation was evident in 6 hours. OG was 1.060.
Racked to a secondary in 4 day (gravity was 1.020) and dryhopped with 1
ounce Fuggles.  Bottled 6 days later (FG = 1.020). Note that the temperature
was very hot, mid 80's during fermentation.
        Now, I know that this beer is not brewed "true to style".  I was
hopeing for an English Style IPA and, according to Glen Tinseth's Brewsheet
the HBU's are only around 19.   I plan to work on style considerations but,
for now, my main concern is the low body score.  
Thanks,
Adam

Wouldn't normally respond, but in former lives I used to do market analysis 
and sociological studies.  James' post doesn't ring true to me. Pls correct 
me if I'm wrong, but what does brewing have to do with an *architectural* 
thesis?


Well, yea, maybe if you asked about brewery construction... but your 
questions are targeted toward demographic and buying preference analysis.  
Come on... I don't see a single question that even remotely relates to 
architecture.....but you would like to know how much money I make?  What 
the revenue and *profit* numbers for Joe's microbrewery are? (only GOD and 
the accountants get the profit numbers)  How much I spend a year on brewing 
supplies? (I'd be afraid to calculate it ;-)


Something's rotten in the fermenter, and its' not a bat... what's this 
questionnaire got to do with architecture???

Subject: Getting into HomeBrew - Just Do it...!


Jeff,


Don't let all the new terms get to you...  The basics for extract brewing 
are clean, sanatize, boil, cool, place in fermenter, clean, ferment, clean, 
sanatize, bottle, let age, drink, enjoy, start over...


I would suggest that you go to the local book store and get a book on 
HomeBrewing.  They will be in the Wine/Spirits section.  The books will 
explain the process and the other terms.


The other thing to do is locate the nearest HomeBrew Supply store and talk 
with the people who work there.  They will usually be happy to talk about 
the brewing process and to get you what you need to get started.


I currently brew using extracts and have been very very happy with all but 
one batch (it has a sour taste due to an infection).  I have been "reading 
the books" and seeing what others are doing and will be making the move to 
all-grain in the near future.  


Most importantly remember - Relax, Don't Worry and have a HomeBrew.

Subject: Bakers Chocolate/Fridge Temp Control


  Good Day HBD'ers


   I'm looking for comments/experiences/gotchas regarding the use of Bakers
   Chocolate in a Stout we (my cousin and I) plan on brewing. Oil and and the
   problems it brings come to mind immediately. Any more?


   I recently brewed my first Pils using dry lager yeast. (Please no liquid
   yeast comments, I'm getting there) Anyway, the instructions involved keep-
   ing the temp at 50-60 for a couple of weeks, no easy task in July. I was
   fortunate in being able to commandeer the fridge in the basement for beer,
   and resolved the temp control problem by plugging and unplugging it daily.
   While while unplugging it the other night, and lamenting the fact that I
   have no thermostat and no plans to actually buy one (yeesh, buy something
   for brewing besides ingredients....) I hit upon the idea of using a simple
   timer I had bought for about $6. You know, the kind that turn your lights
   on and off when you are on vacation. I have an old fridge which has only
   a 2-prong plug, and I just plugged it into the timer. I run the fridge for
   5 hours a day, and my brew stays at a (fairly) constant 55 degrees. Just
   a little info for you folks who are to cheap/mechanically impaired to buy
   and/or install a thermometer on your beer fridge.

I don't want to sound rude or anything, but are you interested in reading 
about homebrewing?  All the terms you mentioned should show up in any text on 
the subject.


Two really good books to look for are:
  Dave Miller, The Complete Handbook of Home Brewing.
  Charlie Papazian, The New Complete Joy of Home Brewing.


There are lots of other references, the ftp repository at stanford, magazines,
etc.  Feel free to ask additional questions.

Subject: Yeast Repitching Technique


Hello Collective,


Here's my latest approach to yeast repitching for your 
comments/critique/discussion.  Disclaimer:  The technique is a little bit 
unconventional but I believe it results in selection of flocculent and healthy 
yeast, minimizes contamination risk, allows for adequate control over 
pitching rates, minimizes trub carryover, and gives rapid starts and vigorous 
fermentation.  


After racking to the secondary, I flame-sterilize the mouth of my primary 
carboy by wiping it down with ethanol and setting it on fire.  It's not really 
dangerous and it can be quite thrilling. ;)  Please use some common sense and 
don't burn your house down or set your hand on fire. (end safety paranoia)
We routinely use this technique in our micro lab.  I then cover the mouth of 
the carboy with flame-sterilized aluminum foil.  


I prepare a starter directly in a 1000-ml Erlenmeyer Flask.  As I'm sure 
many of you are aware, they're made of Pyrex, so you can put them right over 
the flame, boil, chill, and ferment in the same vessel---i.e. no transfer
means less chance of bacterial contamination.  I swirl up the remaining beer, 
trub, and yeast cake, then flame-sterilize the mouths of the carboy and starter 
flask, and pour about 50-mls of the yeast mixture into the starter.  The 
starter is allowed to ferment out as normal and is pitched to fresh wort.


I think this is advantageous for several reasons:


1.  By taking yeast from the bottom of the primary, you select for the most
flocculent and healthy yeast (as opposed to taking it from the secondary,
which has yeast that hung around in suspension the first time--i.e. less
flocculent).  If you repeatedly harvest yeast from the secondary to minimize 
trub carryover, then you are acting as a natural selection force and thereby 
causing your yeast strain to gradually become less flocculent.  OTOH, yeast 
from the secondary may be more alcohol tolerant or perhaps you're looking for 
non-flocculent varieties.  But not me.


2.  More control over pitching rates, thus more predictable and
repeatable results and no worries about overpitching.  Overpitching may not 
be that large a concern, but I have had problems with yeastbite when pouring 
fresh wort over dregs from the primary.  Others do this routinely, so as 
always, YMMV.


3.  Less residual trub in your new beer, thus less potential off-flavor
development (as opposed to pouring wort on dregs).


4. Very little chance for contamination as with yeast washing techniques, due 
to minimal transfers.  (Unless you acid-wash)


5.  As usual, I can taste the starter before pitching to ensure that things 
are in order.  You can do the same with finished beer from the primary, I know,
but nonetheless... 


6.  I still get rapid starts, on the order of 10-12 hours and healthy 
fermentations (mean 74% attenuation with 1084 Irish in 3 batches).


The biggest possible disadvantage I can see is that using a starter between 
batches increases the number of generations, increasing the risk for 
mutations.  However, I recently tried this approach with a packet of Wyeast 
Irish and got 3 very nice beers out of it before I became paranoid and 
discarded the last yeastcake.  It may be less suitable for a yeast like 1056 
that is supposedly more prone to mutation.  I think I could have gone several 
more generations, but was advised to switch yeasts for my needs and wanton 
desires.


One unusual observation was that the yeast seemed to be gradually becoming 
more flocculent and exhibited attached growth on the ribs of the fermenter. 
This phenomenon seemed to increase with successive generations.  What else 
could account for this?


The reason why I've gone to this technique is that the only 2 times I've tried 
fermenting by racking to a primary yeastcake, I made bad beers---not so bad 
that I couldn't drink them, mind you.  ;)  One was a porter that had a nasty 
yeastbite and lots of suspended yeast----I think this was due to 
overpitching.  Also, I'm not confident that my yeast washing techniques are 
sanitary enough at home (haven't built my BT $100 laminar flow hood yet or 
installed an autoclave!).  Lastly, I'm financially strapped (no thanks to grad 
school) and need to save money on yeast.  This technique has proven itself 
effective, is saving me loads of money, and I'm going to continue using it 
despite your inevitable criticisms.  ;-)  Asbestos shields up!  Just wanted to 
share my experiences in hopes of helping out someone else.

Subject: enzymes in programmed mash


Howdy folks,


I do temperature program mashes almost exclusively, and I am wondering if
anyone has info or rumours about the speed at which the amylases work or why
1'C/minute is often given as the optimal rate at which to heat the mash.


For example, on page 283 of volume one Malting and Brewing Science (Briggs,
Hough,Stevens,Young) there is a graph which shows the increase in
carbohydrate fractions during a programmed mash, and the rate seems to be
1'C/min.  MOST OF THE FERMENTABLES ARE PRESENT AFTER THE RISE TO 65'C!  And
the unfermentables increase more during the rise than during the rest.  This
suggests that the rate of rise is of far, far more importance than the
temperature and length of the rest.  I'd say offhand that the idea of
controlling your body and fermentables via mash temperature is applicable
mainly to single step infusion.


If this is a re-run, could some one direct me to the museum?  Even less than
$0.02 would be a worthwhile contribution, so dammit, stop lurking and talk
to me!  - Rob

Subject: Clearing Yeast Sediment....


I'd like to hear some ideas for clearing yeast sediment from finished beer.
 I've left ale in secondary for 3 weeks or so which has cleared 90% of the
sediment, but I still get a little in the bottom of my bottles.  Is it
possible to end up with no sediment?  I realize there will be some yeast
growth in the bottle.  Is there anything that works better than just leaving
beer in the secondary for some length of time?


Thanks for your help.

Subject: Born again fermentation


No, this is not part of the religious thread...


I am a newbie (this post refers to my second batch) so forgive me if I
appear to be worrying too much.  Four weeks ago I brewed an ale: 7# DME,
1# crystal, 2oz Northern brewer (boil), 1 oz cascade (finish), one packet of
Coopers dry ale yeast.  Full wort boil with a quick chill.  I pitched the
yeast at about 75 degrees, and active, but not violent, fermentation had
started by 12 hours.  It continued for about two days before dying down, and
after a week I racked to a secondary and took a reading (1.038).  I figured
it would probably take about three weeks in the secondary, even though it
was *real* quiet - e.g. no activity at all in my airlock.  So after another
week, when I thought there'd be another two to go, I threw in an ounce of
cascade pellets.  Well.  Suddenly the airlock is bubbling away as the hops
expanded on the surface of the beer.  No big deal.  I figured they were real
cold (I'd kept them in the freezer) and they were just triggering some
dissolved CO2.  The hops dropped down after a day or so, and so did the
activity in the airlock, except now I was getting a bubble every 40 seconds
(whereas before I added the hops I was getting nothing).  The next day it
was every 30 seconds, the day after that every 25... you get the picture.
Now, after four weeks, the damn thing is chugging along almost at the rate
of an active fermentation - a thick head has formed on the top - and the
airlock is glugging every 5 seconds.  Clearly this is going to continue for
a while.  Next week I am going out of town for three weeks.  My questions are:


Is this going to form another trub and should I rack this to a 'tertiary'
fermenter before I leave?


I clearly dry-hopped a little too early.  Will this active fermentation
defeat the purpose of the dry-hopping and should I throw in another half
ounce when the activity in the carboy settles down?


Could throwing in the hop pellets have 'shocked' the yeast into doing it's
thing, or is the timing just a coincidence?


Thanks in advance.

Subject: Agar Agar-How Much?


Could some knowledgeable yeast culturist give me an idea how much Agar
Agar(dried
seaweed) to use with 8 ounces of wort in order to make a brewing agar media
for culturing yeast.  I want to pour the gelatinized solution into
polystyrene petri dishes.  Also ideas concerning maintaining sterile media
would be helpful.

- --------------------------------------------------------


The formulation for "Yeast Morphology Agar", taken from the Difco Manual,
calls for 18 grams of Bacto agar per 100 grams of dehydrated medium. 100
grams rehydrates to make 2.8 liters of medium suitable for plating. Since we
are assuming that the wort is taking the place of the 26 other salts, amino
acids, vitamins, carbohydrates and nitrogen sources the formaulation
specifies, I would go with 6.5 grams of agar per liter of wort. You ought to
check the pH of the final product, though. The final reaction of this medium
is pH=5.6 out of the box. YMMV with wort as the diluent.


You can store your plates at RT, but keep them in sealed plastic bags.
Culture media is (obviously!) a wonderful place to grow things. And the
endemic saprophytic fungi that normally infest our homes and brewhouses would
love nothing more than to find a cozy home on board your media plates. If any
become contaminated, DO NOT open the bag to get a closer look!!! When you
open a plate, you tend to spew billions of spores hither and yon. So unless
you relish the idea of bleaching your entire brewhouse to knock down an
Aspergillus epidemic, just throw the contaminated plates away.


You might want to acquire a copy of "The Manual of Clinical Microbiology",
published by the American Society for Microbiology. It has several chapters
on basic micro lab techniques that you may find useful.

DON'T DO IT.....adding 1 lb sugar to 5 lbs of extract will give you a much
lighter version of the beer you are trying to make. If possible, get some
wheat extract from your local homebrew shop (is there one nearby??). In
liquid form, the extract is usually a blend (60/40 or so) of wheat and barley
malt extract and will add much better flavor, etc to your batch. You will
need to boost your hops as well, but most wheat beers are not all that hoppy
to begin with.


Happy brewing,

Subject:       How much grain to make up for extract?


I saw a post the other day asking about DME vs. Extract and got me 
thinking about my future batch of pale ale.


Usually I put in 5 pounds of light malt extract (liquid), however, I 
was thinking about doing a 100% all grain batch instead. If I do 
that, how much Klages 2-row malt do I need to make up for each pound 
of malt extract?


Any help with this will be greatly appreciated.

I agree with Mark 100% on this one. When I first got to my college, 
it was my first time away from home. Also the state's drinking age 
was 19!!


Pretty much everyone in the fraternity bought the beer du jeur 
(whatever was the cheapest at the time) and it was usually pretty 
bad.


After waking up with too many hangovers, I moved towards the "fancy 
beers" as some of my brothers would say. I never forget the look on 
their face when they told me to pick out a good six pack. I 
did....Guiness Stout!! One guy took one taste and swore, "this stuff 
tastes like charcoal." Its kinda ironic that he confided to me that 
he has become quite a stout drinker now. :)


As a home brewer you start to appreciate beer more. For me it is not 
just the taste, but also the process of making the stuff. I forget 
where I read it, but someone suggested that it was "dissrespective" 
to your beer if you drink it straight out of the bottle and don't use 
a glass. While I think that this is taking it to the extreme perhaps, 
I do follow that at home, no matter what beer it is I'm drinking. 


I think that more fraternity brothers are starting to respect beer 
more, especially as you see the better quality beers coming out in 
kegs. 


Of course you're still going to get the Bud and Miller people, but 
that's just the way things are going to be. Afterall, could you 
imagine a party with kegs of nothing but Celis Grand Cru or Guiness 
Stout? I sure could, but the party budget would sure be a wee bit 
high!!!

Subject: Agar-agar/plastic petrie dishes


BixMeister (on 19 July) asked about the amount of (presumably raw, crude)
agar-agar to use in 8 oz of wort to make agar plates in plastic petrie dishes.
For years I have made giotis, a Greek flan-like dessert using 1/6th cup of
agar-agar clippings in 2 cups of sweetened, milk-enriched water to make a very
solid gel. Thus the answer would be 1/12 oz. per 8 oz. However, for an agar
plate this quantity could probably be cut in half and a good gel achieved.
Japanese or Korean grocery store agar is not expensive so the amount is not
critical. I suggest that after boiling the agar strips in the wort for about 10
minutes, the solution should be strained through an old T-shirt to remove the
proportion that does not dissolve. 


I question the home use of plastic petrie dishes that cannot be autoclaved.
Every one that I have made by pouring boiling agar/wort into a sanitized plastic
petrie dish, covered, and placed in a zip-lock (T) bag that has been rinsed with
iodophor, has become contaminated with lactobacillus (?--it smells cheezy)
within 12 hours. Without a lab environment there are too many air-borne
contaminants for this to work. Get Pyrex or other autoclavable petrie dishes and
autoclave the agar/wort in the covered dish for 20 minutes, and very quickly
seal it while still hot with plastic wrap. Even that is dicey.  The difficulty
in making uncontaminated agar plates is demonstrated by ordering a bunch of them
from one of the brewing supply houses. The order of 8 that I got recently had 5
contaminated with molds --and they were made in a univ. bacteriological lab by a
moonlighter.

A new addition to the Is My Beer Ruined FAQ:


I live in the MidWest, and was brewing a wheat beer with Wyeast #3068
Weihenstephan yeast during last week's heat wave.  I just racked to the
secondary what smelled like a banana smoothie.  Is my beer ruined?


And a corollary:


My power was out for two days last week.  Is my yeast ranch ruined?




Now for some value-added comments:


Has anybody noticed a change in Wyeast #1098 British Ale yeast?  Last year,
when I used it to make a pale ale, it fired off with a short lag time and
bubbled away aggressively.  Last month, I brewed a pale ale with a similar
recipe/OG/ aeration techniques, and the #1098 was very slow in starting.


Has anyone else noticed this?

I am a beginner who has made one batch of beer years ago from an
extract kit.  The results were...um...unsatisfactory.  I want to

using crown capped bottles.  I'm not ready for a keg yet, so I
am considering using 1.5 liter plastic soda bottles.  They seem
to be made to take high pressure and shipping, and I think that
the way the bottom is shaped might help keep the dregs from
mobilizing (the way the steal does in the bottom of a champagne
bottle).

Subject: Brewing & the Environment


There are many things which are dear to me. Among them are homebrewing and
doing my part preserving our environment. Consequently, when I can put a few
of these principles/hobbies/etc. together, I am quite pleased. Thus is the
case in my quest for better and tastier suds in a sacred way (NOTE - nothing
religious implied.)


With these in mind, I throw to the collective my questions and ideas theat
relate to my little home brewery.


1. If there were a legal way to do it, if we removed the alcohol from, say, a
not-too-tasty batch, for use in perhaps a lawnmower or chainsaw, what %
pureness would be required in order to run these machines cleanly?
Furthermore, what % could one achieve in a non-laboratory setting? Finally,
what red tape would one require to do such a thing - or is that a question as
far-fetched as will Windows 95 ever exist?


2. When I began brewing while at Queen's University, Kingston, ON, in 1992, I
gave a lot of consideration to the type of storage medium I would use. What I
found at most supply stores were the PET bottles in 500 ml and 1 l sizes,
regular 341 ml beer bottles, and of course, numerous types of kegs, pigs,
chickens (just kidding) and balls. On my daily bicycle ride to school (yes,
even during snowstorms) I would see all kinds of PET (or their glass
equivalent) bottles in the recycling bins. Lo and behold, the neck sizes were
the same as the PET bottles in the stores. Other than being clear/green
instead of brown, it seemed that I had my problem solved. So, I diligently set
out collecting enough bottles. I kept my own. Friends gave me their bottles.
Until I had accumulated 20 two-fours of 500 ml bottles. Or ten 5-gallon
batches. I spent a few dollars on the re-usable caps, and was all set.


With this set-up, I am not hoarding Labatt's or Molson's bottles. I am not
tying up 10 cents per bottle. I can re-use bottles and caps indefinitely. I
have saved land fill space and/or recycling costs. The larger sized bottle
translates to less time bottling. Less beer is wasted to the bottom sediment.
And each beer is a full size beer, rather than the puny commercial sizes. None
of these on their own is tremendously significant; however, all told, I am
pleased with the accumulated total.


Now, one might argue that using clear or green bottles may lead to skunky
beer. To alleviate this problem, I store them in a dark room in the basement,
which is a constant 60 F. I pop them into the fridge as needed. Yum.


3. When I prepare my brews, I tend to pour out the sediment from my primary
and secondary either into the lawn, garden, or compost pile. Other than making
the yeard smell like a brewery for a few hours, this seems to be nothing less
than a good idea. Particularly when even up here in northern Ontario, we have
had some pretty hot weather and dry spells - a good use for rinsing water (of
course, not with chlorine added!) I do the same thing with unpalatable
batches. Any other uses?


4. When on any of these hot summer days I wish to ponder any of these
priciples or hobbies, I have a solution. Search out one of those pre-chilled
brews. Make your way out to the back yard with the chilly and a frosty glass.
Put the chilly into the frosty. Slowly sip while pondering.


If anyone else has any such thoughts, I'd be happy to hear them. If we each do
a little, we'll all contribute a lot.

Subject: Hot break dumpling update and raw wheat efficiency


Several weeks ago I reported on the large coagulations (dumplings) of
hot break I got in a wit beer (see following post for recipe), and
worried that I would not have sufficient proteins remaining for head
retention.  I needn't have worried.  The head is better than on any beer
I have ever made (no doubt all of that raw wheat).  It is incredibly
tight and leaves _clumps_ of meringue-like foam on the sides and bottom
of the empty glass.  I am pleased. :-)


WRT lower extraction from raw wheat (as reported by A.J. deLange), I got
virtually my usual extraction rate (31.6 p*g/p into the boiler) using
45% raw wheat.  My success may be attributable to my having used *soft*
wheat.  This is literally softer, so it mills more easily.  I used a
Corona mill and milled to a coarse meal in two passes.  Hard wheat's
protein matrix may also physically interfere with enzyme access.


I think that soft wheat is a natural for brewing, especially the white
varieties we grow here in Michigan (and also in NY).  Soft wheat has
lower protein (typically 9% compared to 11-14% for hard), which is in
line with the protein levels of the best malting barleys.  The proteins
are weak glutens as opposed to the strong glutens of hard wheat, and
absorb less water.  I think these may make for an easier sparge.
Furthermore, white wheat has lower levels of phenols and tannins than
red varieties, giving potentially a less harsh flavor.  I am certainly
pleased with the results.

Subject: Ginger wit recipe


My ginger wit is bottled and tastes great.  It is a wonderfully
refreshing summer cooler that even non-beer drinkers seem to like.  The
ginger is present but not "in your face," and the orangey coriander
makes it recognizably a wit.  The cardamom and grain of paradise are at
present subliminal, as are the flavor and aroma hops.  I expect it to
evolve further.


I substituted ginger for the more traditional bitter orange peal, but I
feel that this is a variable style where "traditional" is hard to pin
down, and this kind of recipe is in keeping with the spirit of
tradition.  The subtle ginger "bite" seems to substitute nicely for the
omitted lactic acidity.  At 19 days from mash to mouth, there's still
time to brew and enjoy this summer!
