Hello Again,


As much as it pains me, I'm going to have to recant my previous post 
defending the heat generated by wet-flame sanitation with ethanol.  I 
accidentally deleted the code to take my response post out of the queue.  
Sorry for the wasted bandwidth.  Experimental results follow that will 
presumably deter the AI robot from obliterating my feable 
cyber-existence.


I took a thermometer with a range from 0 to 300 C, dipped it in ethanol, and 
set it ablaze.  I did so repeatedly, refusing to believe my results.  The 
temperature consistently reached only 65 C, certainly far below the 
threshhold for sanitation.  OTOH, when I directly dry-flamed the thermometer 
in a natural gas bunsen burner flame, the temperature increased to well over 
200 C in a matter of a few seconds.  The results are clear and 
irrefutable---wet flaming will not sanitize, dry flaming will.  I was 
wrong as wrong could be....and Pierre was right!  I'm sure glad that I also 
dry-flamed those carboy necks when yeast ranching.  Now, back to brewing...

I have a friend who wants to make a ST. Rogue Red.  But I'm not sure of 
the ingrediants, here's my guess:


8#        American 2 row malt
1/4#        Crystal malt 
2-4 oz        Roasted Barley


Standard Infusion mash, 60-90 minutes `at` 153F


Hops, I was thinking Cascades, it had a real 'citrusy' smell to it.
I think probably 3 additions.


2? oz         `at`60 min before end of boil(EOB)
1 oz         `at`15 min before EOB 
1 oz         dry hop in the secondary for 2 weeks


No water treatments.


How about Wyeast 1056 American Ale as the yeast? There's a Advanced
Brewers  Scientific (ABS) ABS001 Northwest Microbrewery Ale yeast, but
I've never used it and don't know if it's appropriate.  (BTW Thanks Jeff,
I just got the catalog.) 


Does anyone have a better handle on this beer?

O.K. Folks, you just barely have time to get a batch of kegged homebrew 
together for this years' Beer & Sweat; so clean out your kegging system and 
work on your best homebrew recipes, because it's time for the 1995 
Beer & Sweat.


  What is Beer & Sweat you may ask? 
Well, Beer & Sweat is THE summer party of, by, and for homebrewers. The 7th 
annual Beer & Sweat is sponsored by the Bloatarian Brewing League of 
Cincinnati, it is one of the largest gatherings of homebrewers on the 
planet, and of interest to all homebrewers within driving distance of 
Greater Cincinnati.  Beer & Sweat is unique in that it is 100 % homebrew 
oriented. Unlike the usual gatherings of brewers, where people 
keep opening a cooler and pulling out another example of a favorite 
commercial beer, we stress the homebrewer's craft exclusively. 
Beer & Sweat is also devoted to DRAFT homebrew. For example last year we 
had 50 kegs of top quality homebrew on hand, most containing 5 gallons each.
There were also a few 10 gallon kegs, a few mini kegs, and a party pig. 
But with over 150 homebrewers in attendance, we still had a quantity of beer
sufficient to provide the expected quantity of sweat. 


  When does Beer & Sweat take place? 
Saturday, August 12, 1995, beginning at 5:00 pm, and running till the wee 
hours. Setup will be between 3:00 and 5:00. 
(Sorry, Friday Night people backed out on me, but a few bloats will 
hanging around the pool Friday nite, but I'm getting together a road trip 
to the area brewpubs Sat. before 5:00).


  Where does Beer & Sweat take place?
At the Drawbridge Estate ( home of the Oldenberg microbrewery). 
We currently have a block of 40 rooms reserved poolside in the Garrison 
building (and we can get more), so we will have a private location. 
Drawbridge is a mere five miles south of downtown Cincinnati, in 
Ft Mitchell, Kentucky. Take the Buttermilk Pike exit from Interstate 71/75 
and go east one block.


  How much will this cost me ?
Nothing. Apart from your meals and lodging, Beer & Sweat is absolutely free.
Their is no admission fee of any kind, except the entry fee if you wish to 
enter a keg in the competition ( $5.00 first keg $1.00 each additional keg ).
The absolutely astounding variety of top quality, fresh, draft homebrew you
will be able to sample at no cost or obligation is guaranteed to boggle your 
mind. The Bloatarians like to have their friends over for a good time. 
Room rates at the Drawbridge are $55 a night for Beer & Sweat, which is 
almost 25% less then the normal room rate. Call 1-800-354-9793 for 
reservations. You must mention Beer & Sweat to get this room rate (tell them
 to put you poolside in the garrison building). Check-in time is 3:00 pm. 
We highly recommend you get a room for the night, either at Drawbridge or 
one of the nearby motels, past Beer & Sweats have gone very late and we 
don't want anyone who feels even slightly intoxicated to drive.


   How do I get an Invitation to Beer & Sweat?
Beer & Sweat has grown to the point where we no longer feel comfortable 
mingling with the general public. But since you're a home brewer, you're 
invited. All we ask is that you bring your homebrew to share. As stated 
earlier, we have secured practically the exclusive use of the Garrison 
building at the Drawbridge. Slightly separated  from the main complex, 
Garrison has an outdoor pool, tennis courts, and recreation area. There are
plenty of ice machines and vending machines. Right next door to the 
Oldenberg brewery, and within a 5 minute walk of numerous fast food places.


  Beer & Sweat Special Competition:
We encourage entries to the Beer & Sweat Open Draft Homebrew Competition. 
Beer & Sweat is the first and possibly still the only AHA sanctioned 
KEG ONLY competition. For a $5.00 entry fee (only $ 1.00 for each additional
keg) you can enter a keg (no bottles) of ANY style beer, Get it set up 
(bring your own CO2, etc.) between 3 and 5 pm, pay your registration fee 
during setup, and be prepared to tap your keg yourself for the judges. 
Judging will take place at 5:00 pm. After the formal judging of registered 
entries, ALL kegs present will be eligible for the popular vote competition,
and a prize will be awarded to the crowd favorite (nice trophy & mug !!).


  Tell them what they can win Bob.
Actually it would be Robert. Robert Pinkerton has done a great job this 
year of  hunting and gathering of prizes (plus a lot of out-right begging). 
The list of prizes is too long to list here but, Robert has succeeded in 
filling his office full of beer related prizes and can no longer find his 
desk. A final and complete listing of prizes will be available in the 
Official Beer & Sweat program, and donors will be thanked thru-out the 
year in our newsletter. But as a small thank-you the first 50 entries will 
receive a Sam Adams painters' hat and t-shirt. Each category winner will 
receive an award and prize. And this year's Best of Show winner will receive 
the first annual Marty Vinnings Cup (it looks GREAT !!!) and even a bigger 
prize.


So get going and start working on your best homebrew recipes and I'll see 
you at The Drawbridge Estate August 12th for the 1995 Beer & Sweat.

Hi All,


  In HBD#1791, Stan Gregory asks:


>Is there a good way to dry hop in a keg or should it go in the secondary?


  I've gotten great results dryhopping in a Corny keg. I use whole leaf or
a plug, and put the hops in a sanitized nylon hop bag. I sanitize the bag
with a 5 minute boil, and if using a plug, cut it into a half dozen pieces.
Seems to help the plug break up into cones.


  Don't bother putting anything in the bag to weigh it down. A couple of
people I know who did this had problems, once the bag sank and got involved
with the pickup tube. Both of them had to open up the keg and fish the
bag out with a coat hanger. I've read that the oils in hops that contribute
aroma are soluble - you don't need to submerge the hops, just get them
wet.


  Since the keg is sealed, the aromatics can't be scrubbed out by escaping
CO2. I get a *lot* of hop aroma from just 1/2 ounce. I suggest starting
with this amount, then make adjustments according to your taste.


*********************************************************************


  Also in HBD#1791, Jim Grady writes:


>He went on
>the say that his friend who owns a local sewer & drain company told him
>(this is getting to be gossip at this point!) of a customer who was a
>homebrewer and his septic system was in very good condition


  I had mine pumped last fall, 3 years since the last time. The guy who
did the work remarked that it was one of the "cleanest" systems (I guess
this was a relative term, huh? :-)) he had ever seen, almost no solid
waste at all. He asked me what I was dumping in there that was keeping
it so healthy. Just a quart or so of yeast slurry a couple times a 
month, and the occasional few gallons of BBrite.
  I mention this because of the "will I screw up my septic system if I
dump santizer/yeast" posts that appear periodically. After 8 years of
homebrewing, mine is doing just fine.


*********************************************************************


  A few digests back, Dion Hollenbeck posted that he aerates with pure
O2, without filtering. I have heard that micro-organisms cannot survive
in a pure 02 environmnt.
  I have an aquarium pump aeration system which works well enough, but
handling the inline filter and trying to keep it sterile is a real PITA.
I'm very interested in Dion's procedure, alas, he's off the air at the
moment due to a job change.
  Is anyone else doing this??? I'd like to hear all the gory details,
prices and sources for O2 tanks, how long do you oxygenize (is that a
word?) at what pressure, how many batches per tank, etc.


           TIA,

Subject: Nutrient value of beer / GT IX                                   


                                                                               
NUTRIENTS IN BEER:                                                             
                                                                               
A FOOD section column in today's _Milwaukee Journal-Lite_ had a Q&A on         
the food value of beer. The question was: 'so-and-so told me that beer         
has a lot of vitamin B, but I thought it was all empty calories.' The          
columnist replied that there's more vitamin B in a bag of M&Ms and that        
beer is indeed empty calories. (She was a little less harsh toward wine,       
but not much) Now I can see that for an industrial corn or rice swill          
and for filtered beers, but a bottle-conditioned beer will indeed have a       
fair amount of Vitamin B, and an all-malt beer (and with a higher              
terminal gravity than corn/rice swill) will have some proteins from the        
grain. There's certainly more nutrition in a pint of beer than in a can        
of soda, a beverage that doesn't get all the bad press as beer. (And           
soda doesn't have the beneficial effects on the heart, either.)                
                                                                               
I'd like to reply to that columnist and set her and the readers                
straight. Obviously, "beer" represents a wide range of beverages, but          
does anyone have some hard figures on the types and amounts of nutrients       
in a beer, be it a pale ale or a stout or whatever. What kinds of data         
did Bert Grant try to put on his labels? Serious and INFORMED replies          
only, please; be able to document your information--it would be worse          
for beer lovers to be shown misstating the truth than to have said             
nothing at all.                                                                
                                                                               
AS LONG AS I'M WRITING.... Please note that the Madison Homebrewers and        
Tasters Guild's Ninth Annual GREAT TASTE OF THE MIDWEST<tm> is sold out        
(has been since early June); tickets for next year's tenth anniversary         
extravaganza go on sale 1 May 1996. We still get a few inquiries even in       
July. Part of the problem may be that many club newsletter calendars           
print events for only the next month. By the time an August event hits a       
newsletter's cycle, it's far too late for anyone to get tickets. Please        
pass the word on to your club's newsletter editors--you may want to list       
the event in the May calendar next year to coincide with the ticket

I think the belt you refer to is a "heating" belt, not a cooling belt, so I
don't think it is a solution in your case.  I have one that I used in the
second batch of beer that I made many, many years ago.  So far it remains the
only batch I had to actually throw out!
78 degrees is a pretty high fermentation temp and, I believe, contributed to
a horrendous number of off/yucky flavors in that forgettable brew.  The belt
was part of a single stage "Complete Beer Kit" that was made in Canada and
included a large 7 gal. plastic fermentor with a lever action faucet that I
still use.  But I don't use the belt!   YMMV, of course.  You might try the
"evaporative-cooling-T-shirt-covered-fermentor-in-a-bucket-of-water"
technique that has been discussed many times on the HBD.

Subject: Scientific Mashing Breakthru!


Well, Not really.
But I did find out something that should be very helpful to many of you.


I have been asking a few eminent homebrewers how much grain can be mashed in a
fixed volume Cooler ex. a 5 gallon Gott. The answers have been helpful, but 
anecdotal, i.e. "I did X lbs for this batch". 


So, last night on the way home from work, I had a brainstorm. Why not mash 1 lb
in 1 quart and see what the volume is?!


Well, I did. I carefully weighed 1 lb of Great Western 2 Row malt, crushed it
in my Maltmill and added it to 1 quart of 120F water. I let this sit for about
5 minutes. Since I only have a 1 quart pyrex measuring cup, I poured 24 oz of
mash into the measuring cup and discarded it. I then poured in the remainder
and measured it. It came to about 18 oz. 


It occured to me that because the first measurement was more fluid, and the
second pretty stiff, I might be experiencing compaction, and not getting a good
measurement. So, I measured out 2 more cups of hot water (16oz) and added it to
the 2nd measure of mash in the quart measuring cup. If I had been paying better
attention, I would have only added 1 cup. The liquid level rose to just over
the 32 oz mark. 


Comparing the two measurements, I determined that the addition of 16 oz of
water to the 18oz looked to be a change in volume of 16 oz, meaning that I had
negligible compaction. 


So! We now have a brewing constant for figuring how much grain can be mashed in
a fixed volume. 1 Pound of 2 Row Malt mixed with 1 Quart of Water produces a
volume of 42 fluid ounces. If you are figuring a 1.5 quart per pound mash, then
add in the additional half quart per pound as my measurements show that 1 quart
per pound is already a saturated condition.


In summary, 10 lbs of Malt at 1.5 qt/lb would fill just over 4.5 gallons, which
would be do-able in a 5 gallon cooler. This would yield a 1.060 beer.

1.  is priming the same (3/4 cup corn sugar/5 gal) - I assume so,
2.  are there any worries about creating bombs with the smaller bottles or 
    am I just over analyzing the situation and the same amount of internal
    force due to the carbonation is the same regardless of bottle size 
    (equal head space).

Subject: Marzen follow-up


     Last week, I posted a request for information on Marzens, particularly 
     DeGroen Marzen produced by the Baltimore Brewing Company.  I had only 
     one reply, but it was extremely informative.
     
     These are exerpts from information sent to me from Robert Chizmadia:
     
     >The yeast is definitely the Weinstephan 07 lager yeast, which is the 
     >same as Wyeast's  #1007.  All his malts are Gambrinus (yes, North 
     >American) two row.  I'm not sure of the percentages of the grain, but 
     >it is a mixture of Munich, crystal and lager malt.  Finishing hops

     >These are what he uses on most of his beers. If you went to the GABF

     >for around 4 to 6 weeks.
     
     I was surprised by both the use of American 2-row and Cluster 
     bittering hops.  Does this fit into the traditional Marzen category?  
     If not, is there a better category to classify it in?  I certainly 
     plan on making a batch, whatever it may be.  Comments?

I was going to answer Nick, but the answer is not what most people want
to hear: no one knows how to make Liefmanns.  Although Liefmanns is NOT
a lambic, the lambic digest is a good place to discuss efforts at its
emulation.  Liefmanns is an oud bruin/old brown/sour brown/Flanders brown.
As with most Belgian styles, the yeast and fermentation are more important,
or at least harder to figure out, than the "recipe."


Head Start Brewing cultures has a couple of cultures that are meant
to be from this type of beer.


Here is the BURP Labs info on this beer:
*****************************************************
Brewing Belgian Beers (#4): Oud Bruins
Description: 


1.045-1.060, 4.8-6% ABV, 15-25 IBU, 10-20 SRM Red, deep copper or deep
brown with red tints. Acidic aroma with some fruitiness. Flavor sweet,
sour and fruity, esp. cherry-like. Lactic and acetic flavors
ok. Attenuation low to medium. Medium carbonation, body medium to
full. Addition of raspberries or cherries ok, should blend with other
flavors, may provide additional acidity. Low bitterness, no hop flavor
or aroma. No diacetyl.


Most commercial examples are richly colored with a fruity, acidic
aroma and an intensely fruity, sweet and sour palate. Sourness varies
in commercial examples, many of which are filtered and sweetened. Can
become wine-like with age. Many commercial examples include a
secondary fermentation on raspberries or sour cherri es, and the
flavors this contributes should be clear and should balance with the
existing acidity and sweetness.


Brewing method
Homebrewers have yet to master this style. It appears that basic
grists include pilsner malt, caramel malts, sometimes Vienna or
Munich, and sometimes roasted malts in very small quantities for
coloring. In some cases the deep color is achieved by long
boils. Lactic and acetic bacteria provide the necessary acidity, an d
these may need a long time to achieve the proper acidity. Additions of
lactic acid to finished beer may work. When used, fruit should be
added to the secondar y at 1-2 lbs per gallon of beer. Any cherries
used should be sour! Carbonation is relatively standard, so 3/4 to 7/8
of a cup of sugar should be used to prime a 5 gallon batch. 


Extract brewers should start with pale extract and use lots of caramel
malts. Try to pick a yeast that's not going to attenuate too much.
Keep in mind that you're experimenting. However, if you're the first
to brew a really good one of these, you will earn a substantial laurel
wreath, and perhaps the Homebrew Nobel Prize.


Common problems
1. Inadequate acidity. Add lactobacillus culture, ferment longer, or
add lactic acid.


2. Fruit flavors thin or inappropriate. Increase quantity of fruit, or
use sour fruit instead of pie cherries!


3. Too light in color. Increase use of caramel malts and/or boil time. 


Commercial examples
Goudenband (5.1% ABV), Rodenbach Grand Cru (6.5% ABV), Liefmans
Framboise (5.7% ABV), Liefmans Kriek


Sample recipe
Bill Ridgely's Framboise (partial mash recipe for 5 gallons)
RIDGELY`at`A1.CBER.FDA.GOV
3.3 lbs   American Classic Light liquid extract
2.0 lbs   Pale dry extract
1.0 lb    Pale ale malt
0.5 lb    Munich malt
0.5 lb    80L crystal
0.5 lb    Wheat malt
0.5 lb    dextrin malt


1.0 oz    Hallertau (4.2%) boiled for 60 minutes
1.0 oz    Saaz (3.2%) boild for 45 minutes


6.0 lbs   Tart red raspberries


Fermented with Wyeast Belgian yeast


OG: 1.062 FG: 1.015 
Used step mash for grains--120 degrees for 30 minutes (protein rest),
150 degrees for 60 minutes (saccrification rest). Gypsum was added to
adjust the mash pH.  Total boil time 1.5 hours. Raspberries were
crushed and added to the brewpot at the end of the boil, then steeped
for 15 minutes before wort chilling. The raspb erries were left in the
primary for 7 days, then strained during transfer of wort to the
secondary. Total fermentation time: 24 days. Fermentation temperature:
62F.


Recommended All-Grain variation (using Belgian malts at 27 points/lb): 


9.0 lbs   pale ale malt
1.0 lb    aromatic malt
1.0 lb    wheat malt
0.5 lb    caramunich
0.5 lb    Special B
All other ingredients and procedures remain the same. 


[Phil's note: This recipe was the closest to the real thing I've
tasted, with one exception: it lacked the necessary sourness, although
some was supplied by the raspberries. Nevertheless this recipe with an
additional acid component or lactic fermentation seems like an
excellent starting point for experimentation]

You fool!  (Or should that be "me fool"?)  Liefmanns isn't a LAMBIC it's a
Flanders Brown Ale.  Of course, Liefmanns kriek has a few things in common
with many kriek lambics.  1 - it's delicious.  2 - it's made with cherries.
3 - it's belgian  4 - if you really want to clone it right, you should think
"brettanomyces"  5 - it's delicious  6 - Lambic Digest is an appropriate place
to discuss them  7 - so's this.


Use all your cherries in a 3.5 gallon batch.

Subject: old grains/all-grain


Greetings all!


First, I posted some time ago asking about using grains that have been
cracked and have been sitting around a while.  Well, here's the poop:
several people responded, all saying about the same thing.  If you have
cracked grains and don't intend to use them right away, be sensible - treat
them like bread (cool, dark, and airtight - what about freezing? (my own
opinion)).  Many people used grain that has been sitting around for as long
as a month with the following to say -"It's not the good flavors that the
grain loses, but the bad flavors that develop".  So, my suggestion of using
more grains only holds partially true - you may help the malt flavor and
gravity, but the off flavors will still be there.  (BTW, one guy said he
noticed a 5% drop in lautering efficiency with his old grains with the same
equipment)  So, in conclusion - (as one responder said) If you are looking
for a Best of Show, don't even use your week old grain.  If you are looking
for cheap and drinkable, your year old grain should be fine.


I do have another question on this:  No one seemed to know what actually
happens to the grain as it ages.  Do any of you Grain Gurus know?


*****************************************************************


I brewed my first all grain batch this weekend!  Yippeee!  I thought I'd
pass along the stats (I thought they were quite good).  The batch was five
gallons of pale ale.


50 min mash (iodine test showed conversion `at` 45min)
30 min sparge (had trouble regulating the flow)
60 min boil
electric stove
copper manifold in lauter-tun 
immersion cooler


I had the grains cracked at my local HB shop, and my starter was made two
days before brewing.


Total time including cleanup - 4 hours!  Efficency - 82%, 29 ppg.  (Checked
just before pitching)


Am I lucky that things went so well?  From what I've heard, most people take
a much longer time with less efficiency.  (Sorry if I'm tooting my own horn,
but I didn't think all grain would be so easy :-)  I'll let you know in two
weeks how it turned out!


By the way - Thanks to everyone who responds to the questions posted here
(mine and others).  They make my brewing life much easier!


Yours in brewing,
john
