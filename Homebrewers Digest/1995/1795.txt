  Dave Logsdon(sp?) of Wyeast Labs has been cited in Brewing Techniques as
stating that Wyeast 2124 Bohemian is the same as the 34/70 yeast.

  The thing I like about this yeast is that it does not require extended
lagering to produce a good beer. As Jim mentioned, it ferments very cleanly,
and I've found that just 4-6 weeks at ~34F is an adequate lagering period.
By comparison, other lager yeasts I've used throw a lot of sulfurs in
primary (rotten-egg smell), and require 3-4 months before they're cleaned
up.

>#82PK   recessed ring burner with 12" tripod, wind guard, 170K BTU ($57)


  I own one of these models, in general I'm pretty happy with it. Typical
of multijet models, it's quiet, fuel efficient, has a high degree of
adjustability, and enough power at 170K BTU to bring a 10 gallon batch to 
a boil in about 20 minutes.
  The only drawback with this model is that the burner ring is *exactly*
the same diameter as the bottom of a Sankey keg. I would not recommend using
a Sankey keg on this burner as it comes - the keg is very wobbly and unstable.
If you plan to use a Sankey, you'll need to put a piece of stock aluminum
under it, or take some other measure to stabilize the keg.
  There is another style of 1/2 bbl keg that does fit well on this burner,
but I don't know what it's called. I've done 10 gallon boils with this
type of keg on this burner with no problems. These kegs have no side bung, but
they're not straight-sided either. The keg sides taper somewhat on the ends,
which is why this type of keg does fit. Maybe someone who knows what these
are called can jump in here.

Not strictly related to homebrewed beer (of which I am an avid lover and 
brewer - yum!), but more on the homebrewed wine area.


Is anyone out there currently using CWE Classic kits? I am just in the 
final stages of brewing their Ruby Port Style (1 gallon) and as it is my 
first effort, I would like to have some advice for the final product.


1) I recieved no sachet of wine stabiliser (Potassium Sorbate) with the 
   kit. Instructions indicate that it is required. If I really do need it, 
   can any Australians out there suggest a place to get some quick?


2) How have you found the finished product. I tasted some from a 
   hydrometer test (about 1.000 at this point - suggested F.G. is 0.996-
   0.998) and it seemed OK - will it improve as it ages?


3) Will I have time to brew and mature their Pale Cream Sherry in time 
   for Christmas/New Year?


Thanks a million for any assistance you can offer. Certainly, brewing 
in glass for the first time (1 Gallon Demijohn) has got me seriously 
considering buying a glass carboy for my beer next time I'm near a 
decent homebrewing shop.

I have had a couple of stalled fermentation using packet yeast. My 
usual procedure is to rehydrate 3 packets (no fridge space to do proper 
starters) and pitch. Usually I get solid fermentation for 48 hours, a 
24 hour pause, with positive pressure in airlock still, and then a 
resumption for about another 48-96 hours. No off tastes to date, and 
all beer drinkable. Oh to have a place of my own and not shared teacher

I have the worst of both worlds (honest!). In summer, my temperatures 
range from about 78F (Night) to 110F (Day) in Summer, and 30F (Night) to 
86F (Day) in Winter.


In summer, I generally use the "wet coating" effect by covering my 
fermenter with a towel or T-Shirt, and either monitoring it, and 
dampening when drying, or by leaving it in a tub of water in a breezy 
area. Otherwise I sit it in front of my Air-Conditioner as much as 
possible (the smell of fermenting beer in the bedroon keeps me on a 
perpetual high!!!!!)


In winter, I insulate the fermenter as much as I can by warming it up in 
a tub of hottish water, and then drying and wrapping in a very thick 
towel and confining it to the least drafty space I can find. I check 
the temperature daily and warm as required. If it gets <really> cold, I 
run a small heater at night to minimise the chill effect.

I areate in an open bucket. The airstone is at the end of a rigid wand
connected to a long coiled flexible tubing; the whole assembly is
sanitized in iodophor but no attempt is made to sterile-filter the air. I
can run the pump full blast for about 10 minutes before the foam threatens
to overflow. The foam can then be easily beaten back with the brewing
spoon, (which I keep simmering in water during the whole process). I try
to aerate for a total of one hour; a kitchen timer is absolutely
necessary to avoid overflows.


I drop the beer from the open fermenter to a carboy 24 to 36 hours after 
the start of vigorous fermentation (for normal-gravity ales).

Subject: Agar/Sparge manifolds




Agar, Patrick stated that agar is 15-20 g per litre which is standard if 
you check a media book.  He was correct in stating that it constitutes 
1.5-2.0% (15/1000), but 1 ounce is 28 grams (not 35) I presume this is a 
typo.  Most Yeast and Mold Agar recipes have about 50-75g/l of agar and 
nutrients.  That means if you use 15-20g (1/2-3/4 oz) agar adding another 
say 55g (2oz) of DME or DME/spent Yeast/glucose should be good.  Even 
easier just add the right amount of agar to some fresh wort during your 
next brewing session.  There is also a tblsp or tsp method listed in an 
FAQ which I didn't have the forethought to take down.:(


Sparge manifolds,  PVC should work but Taking 5 feet of 3/8 Cu tubing 
coiling and slotting  was the easiest for me.  I coiled it 3 times to 
fit in my Gott joined bothe ends together with a brass compression "T" 
and ran another small chunk of tubing through a #2 bung out the existing 
valve hole.  I used my dremel cutoff wheel to make the downward facing slots.
I exited both ends to even flow, for the slots I made them with 
differential spacing. 1/4,1/2, 3/4 inches apart in a seat of the pants 
beer in hand attempt at equalizing flow betwween the furthest and closest 
areas.  I don't Know if it actually helps but it doesn't hurt, and I got 
to feel very high-tech like.:) explanatory ASCII:

        sitting in the bottom of my Gott.
I also cut the coils in three chunks and connected it back with siphon 
tubing to aid in any possible husk removal/ cleaning.  
It works well, was easy to assemble, comes apart for cleaning, and cost 
almost nothing.:)  As for using a hacksaw, use a good blade as the 
numerous slots will make for a lot of sawing if you arent using power tools.

Subject: Wind Malt


Eric Miller discussed wind malt and asked  if anyone has had experience with it.
I used to malt and hope to be able to get back into it this winter.  I hadn't
developed a good kilning method at the time ( hadn't worked out an air flow
system in my oven yet) so the kilning was very uneven.  I read in Declerck about
wind malt so I gave it a try.  I just sat my screen box on top of two box fans
and blocked the two other sides with cardboard.  The fans sucked air through the
green malt and dried it in two or three days.  I then put it in a pot in the
oven for a day longer at about 100'F to finish it off.  


I just made ales with it.  They were fine, but my extraction was nothing to brag
about.


As for malting in general, don't do it for the money saved - it is not worth the
effert.  But I found it to be an interesting challange.  I would like to try to
make real brown malt by roasting it over a hardwood fire to see how the old
porters tasted.

Subject: Use of SUDS


Regarding the use of SUDS 4.0:


I've developed several recipes, some of which I need to alter.  I'd
like to keep the old recipe intact for awhile, as I tweak the same
basic ingredients/process.
 
Currently I've just built a whole new recipe, using the same name
but adding a version number.  This embarassingly primitive technique
has two problems: I have to rebuild the new recipe from scratch (the
biggest problem), and I'm proliferating recipes in the database (this
makes browsing a bit of a pain).


The first problem could be solved if there was a way to clone an
existing recipe (copy it as an entity) to a new one, then tweak the
copy.  I see no solution with SUDS for the second problem.  With a
relational database, my process might be implemented with a record
having recipe-name and version-number as two attributes.  Several
such records would then have the same "recipe-name", and all recipe
versions of the same basic recipe-name could then be selected.


Second issue is one of keeping notes on a given recipe.  Other than
using the NOTES feature, how can one tie competition results to
a given recipe?  Again, relationally, I'd need a COMPETITION table
to hold data on a competition, and a COMPETITION-RESULTS table to
hold the results of a given competiton for a given entry.  I see no
way to implement this with SUDS.  Any ideas appreciated: how do YOU
track the performance of a given batch of beer?

===> Mike Spinelli asks about blowoff hoses:

It is caused by soaking in a water solution.  Water is absorbed by
the plastic tubing and it turns cloudy.  If you let the tubing sit
especially in a warm place, the water will desorb and the tubing
will clear up.


===> Keith Frank provides a tip for sanitizing racking canes:

A similar technique that works well for me is to use a wall
papering tray.  It's that cheap thing you by at a hardware or
paint store that you put rolled up, pre-pasted wallpaper in to wet
it before applying it to the wall.  The tray is about 6"x6"x36".
I put my (bleach based) sanitizing solution in it and then
my racking canes and tubing.  It comfortably hold all of them.
I imagine this would work for Iodophor sanitizers also.

Mine is octagonal to go around the perimeter of the perimiter of the

I'd give it at least a couple more weeks before getting concerned.
Heavier beers such as porters and stouts generally take longer to
carbonate than ligher beers such as ales or weizens.

Dion is right.  Pure oxygen is very danger especially in the
presence of something combustible.


On a related note, Dave Berry, the nationally syndicated humor
writer, recently wrote piece on some people at Purdue University
who used liquid oxygen to start a charcoal grill.  Berry described
how charcoal is normally as easy to start as a pile of rocks.
However, with liquid oxygen, the Purdue folks were able to consume
30 lb of charcoal in less than 5 seconds.  It also consumed the
grill.  There's a Web page with pictures describing this "experiment".
Unfortunately, I don't have the URL handy.

Hi John --


I'm looking at moving up to a keg on propane boiler setup myself, so
I thought I'd let you know the direction I was moving in.


I've got several brew-buddies here that either use this equipment or
are preparing to.  Two of them now mash in coolers, and I think they
use simple infusions almost exclusively.  I've only done partial
mashes to date, using the same pot-in-the-oven method you describe.
I'm planning on moving to a cooler type setup.


At the moment I'm not thinking about mashing in the keg/boiler.  I
don't know anyone personally who does this, although there are
numerous posts in the HBD archives talking about it.  You can even
get a special EasyMasher(TM) built to fit inside the Sabco keg.


There is a shop near me that sells the Sabco kegs (Hop and Vine in
Morristown, NJ), so I've looked them over pretty carefully and I like
what I see.  To answer your questions:


    -        The one I was looking at had a standard size ball valve on
        the outside, and it came with a barbed connector for 3/8" hose.


    -        It comes with an enamel-on-steel type lid.


    -        I measured the diameter as 15 3/4" at the bottom.


    -        It isn't light empty.  I think if filled with 10 gallons
        I'd need some extra hands to move it very far.  With 5
        I can probably do it myself (cautiously!)


The diameter of the thing combined with the weight has me concerned
about the burners I was looking at, in particular the high ones like
83PK.  Right now I'm considering seriously the 100K BTU burner that
William's is selling, since it looks much sturdier than the tall fish
cookers I've seen plus it has adjustable legs so you can change the
height from 11" to 23" high.  This burner has a square top that has
an 18" diagonal (I had them measure it for me) so it should hold the
keg securely.


Definitely go for serving via the corny kegs . . . best move I ever
made.

Subject: Sanitation tip


In HBD #1791, Bruce DeBolt writes about sanitizing racking canes...


I went over to my local hardware store and purchased a plastic window-
type flower box (called an "Estate Box"). It is about 28" long and 5"
deep and is perfect for sanitizing racking canes and all the other
small items needed for a clean mash/boil/brew.  The only thing I 
don't put in is my racking hose.  I use a small plastic bucket for
this, coiling the hose around inside the bucket.
*******************


HBD#1791, Jim Grady writes about bleach, etc. in the septic tank...


The most I ever dump into my septic system is when I soak my carboy
after a primary ferment. Then I use a cup or so of bleach, partly for
it's cleaning properties.  Now, my septic system is a 1000 gallon tank.
I also know it is full of liquid all the time.  My cup of liquid bleach
will not have that much of an effect on that 1000 gallons.  Oh, I know
the bleach will be concentrated by the inlet, but the billions of 
nasties living in the other 990 gallons will quickly make up for those
killed by the inlet pipe.


I have been brewing for about 4 years, dumping copious quantities of
bleach into my system all that time, with no ill effects.

Just another question in regard to the wort aeration thread.


I recall reading a post in the HBD from a few months back suggesting the use of
common drug store cotton to filter the air pumped through an aquarium pump

"clean" way to oxygenate wort?  TIA

Subject: Thermodynamic Sulphur Chillout (Part 1)
- ------------------------------- Message Text -------------------------------




This is # 1 of 2 parts about chilling and why. The tables came through as 
gibberish in the last post. I'm trying again.


* Norman Pyle in HBD 1778 started a thread on "chillers" that I sympathize 
with. The
thermodynamic terminology of homebrewers is esoteric and  serves little 
technical
purpose.
* Robert Brown in HBD 1780 attempts to coin an awesome nomenclature.
* Lee Allison in HBD 1780 wants to build a plate exchanger, I have a simple 
design.
* Tom Williams (refreshingly) identifies "chillers" as heat exchangers and 
introduces
the correct technical description but wants to know why?


I left the Physics department for Literature 20 years ago, confident that the 
mysteries of
thermodynamics would never torment me again. Alas, now I must dip my big toe in 
it
again.


As I said in a previous post, I am constructing a 70 litre test model of a full 
mini-
brewery for assembly in central Russia. To this end I have been pestering 
engineers,
beer in hand.


FAQ: Why chill quickly?
 I see two main reasons
  1/ To get from
>>> the Sterile Boiling Phase  
 >>> through the Warm Bacteria-Motel Phase 
 >>> to the Vigorously Fermenting-Protected by Krausen Foam or Airlock Phase
 without unwanted guests (bacteria), so time is important.


  2/ Control of Sulphur flavours. 
The Di-Methyl Sulphide (DMS) flavour threshold in beer is about 30 micro 
grams/litre.
DMS is produced from the malt's natural content of  S-Methyl Methionine (SMM) 
and
at temperatures greater than 70 C. In "Principals of Brewing Science", p 142, 
Professor
George Fix describes the math of this. Apparently in the boil all DMS gets 
carried away
with the exiting gases. But between boil and fermentation temperature the 
residual heat
continues the reaction SMM>>>DMS with the DMS remaining in solution. Thus if
cooling is prolonged, a pronounced sulphur taste enters the flavour profile.


FAQ- How quickly to chill?


The DMS flavour appears subjective, some like it in the tertiary flavour range 
of about
half the flavour threshold of 30 micro grams/litre( ie nothing). Most beer 
seems to be in
the  secondary range of 20 to 60 micro grams. Some profiles have a higher
concentration. How to control it?


In  Mr. George Fix's example, he ignores the Mash and Sparge stages, in which 
the
temperature does approach and exeed 70 C. Ignoring this should result in less 
DMS in
Wort solution than his model suggests. However he includes cooling phase
temperatures well below 70 C in his calculations, doing this overstates the DMS 
in
solution!? I will use George's model as is, and assume the two variables would 
cancel
out. It is just a guide anyway.


Basically, some of the SMM converts to DMS in the boil and is carried away. 
Part of
*what is left* is converted to DMS in solution, about 25% of which is then 
broken
down in fermentation provided no DMS producing bugs are present.. So the final
Sulphur flavour is determined by
a/ the SMM fraction /gram of your malt
b/ the grams of malt/litre wort 
c/ the boil time
d/the cooling time
e/ bacteria free fermentation


Using Georgie's examples I have created two tables, the first to calculate the
concentration of SMM/litre Wort, and the second to calculate the % of this left 
as
DMS in solution  *after* fermentation


                MICRO GRAMS of SMM/ LITRE WORT BEFORE BOIL
        * Grain Bill/Vol*        * Micro Grams SMM/Gram of Malt  (from your
maltster or guess 6)*

200                1.5                600        800        1000        1200        1400        1600        1800
300                2.25                900        1200        1500        1800        2100        2400        2700
400                3                1200        1600        2000        2400        2800        3200        3600
500                3.75                1500        2000        2500        3000        3500        4000        4500


This gives the initial concentration of SMM/litre  in your Mash


                PERCENTAGE OF INITIAL SMM LEFT AS DMS AFTER
FERMENTATION
                *Chilling Time*  (100 C >> 20 C)

Example:  We have a 6 micro gram/gram SMM content malt, and a grain bill of 2.25
lbs/gal. We decide to boil for 90 minutes and our Supercyberchiller does the 
trick in 10
minutes.


                DMS = 1800 x 1.5%= 27 micrograms/litre (Below the flavour threshold
of 30, in lower secondary range)


If we cool for 15 minutes
                DMS= 1800 x 2.2% =40 micrograms/litre ( A slight malt/sulphur tone-
quite agreeable) 


Now we try some high SMM malt at 8 /gram and a high SG brew using 3lb/gal, a 
short
boil of 75 minutes and a bathtub chiller which takes 30 minutes.
                DMS= 3200 x 5.3%=170 micrograms/litre (This would clear your
sinuses!!)


I am not confident of these figures, could they be checked by Fixey or someone 
more
familiar with the labyrinths of chemistry? I will repost new tables if 
corrected, I would appreciate feedback on .

Hi to all! Am new to the Digest.


Found an interesting piece of equipment at a scrap metal dealer that I'd
like to eventually use as a mash tun: It's rated at 40-gallons, SS, approx.
2.5 ft in diameter, with a double-jacketed hemispherical bottom designed to
be heated with steam (rated at 40-psi/300-degF). I saw the exact same thing
in Point Judith, RI where I think it was used to boil lobsters. It came off
a SS table assembly. It also has a seperate SS lid that hinged to the table.


There's a pretty close approximation of it in the MAAS BREWING SYSTEMS ad
(no connection:) on page 9 of the Mar/Apr '95 BT. There, it's used as a
boiling kettle though.


I have 2 questions:


1. How far down can a SS false bottom be placed before extract efficiency is
compromised, i.e, does it need to be placed at the widest diameter, or can
it be placed nearer the bottom? This question relates to: a) the volume of
space under the false bottom; and b) the effect that a false bottom with a
diameter smaller than the diameter of the top of the grain-bed will have on
lautering efficiency.


2. And, is there any problem with heating the bottom of the vessel directly,
using the double-jacket first as a heat buffer, and then to recirculate hot
water through the outter jacket during the mash to maintain an even temperature.


I also plan to make a RIMS out of it, so would a large volume under the
false bottom even make any difference?
