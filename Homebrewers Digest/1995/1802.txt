Subject: revisiting SG


While reading the part on specific gravity in de Clerck's "A Textbook of 
Brewing", I ran across some things I think (how do I dare?) are wrong. In 
several places in the book, he seems to equate specific gravity and density. 
In my mind, this would only be true at 4 C, when water density is exactly 1. 
Otherwise, SG is not density, but rather a ratio of this divided by the 
density of water. He goes on to present (in page 16 of volume 2) a table of 
SG of water at different temperatures (in the text he says "densities," then 
the table title reads "specific gravities"). The values correspond in fact 
to the densities of water at those temperatures. So, Am I missing something 
here? Water SG must be 1 at any temp, unless the reference temp is different 
of the "sample" water. And, if this is the case, then the value of  SG 1 
should be for the case when both are the same (usually 15.5 C, but not 4 C 
as shown in the table).


The most troubling fact is that in the same page, he says "From the figures 
given above, the difference in weight of 100 g. of water at 19 C and 20 C is 
20 mg. In a pycnometer containing 50 g. of water this gives a difference of 
1 mg. for a tenth of a degree rise in temperature."  I'm assuming this must 
be a typo (actually, 2 typos in a row), since it should be 100 ml and 50 ml, 
but it is right below the mentioned table, which also doesn't make any sense 
to me.Any comments will be greatly appreciated.

Have a look at ftp.stanford.edu. There are a few spreadsheets for MS Excel
which works on the mac. The only stand-alone applications I have seen were
in ads in Zymurgy, but since they are commercial they will cost somewhere
around 30-40$. Excel is quite expensive so if you don't have access to it
already I wouldn't recommend it (unless you are going to use it for some
other purpose).


I have Excel at work on my mac and use a homemade spreadsheet to do all
calculations needed in my brewing, including easy conversion of units and
recipe design. It's not really finished yet, but when (if) it is I'll
probably upload it to ftp.stanford.edu.


Hope this helps,

Subject: Dumplings


   Did we ever get a serious answer to the "dumpling" looking formations in
the fermenter?  I suddenly noticed the same phenomenon, it started in the
very early stage, like an hour or so after pitching.  I am slightly paranoid
about this because I tried something new and suspect that I may have ruined
10 gallons of brew.
    So I guess I have to explain what I did.  After I racked one batch to
secondary I used my sanitized baster to remove some of the slurry on the
bottom, then placed the slurry in a couple of sanitized miniature whiskey
bottles (50 ML), loosely capped the bottles and placed them in the coolest
part of the refridge.  The slurry settled to about half of the volume and was
pitched 3-4 hours later.  After only a couple of hours the "dumplings"
formed, a couple of hours later a nice head had formed.  The "dumplings" seem
to have broken up into "micro-dumplings" and are merrily cavorting up and
down and around in the carboy.  Smells rather like wet earth, I never noticed
this smell from other yeast I have used, I don't remember ever using 1056
before, the previous batch had a pronounced "bannana" smell even at 68F.
IMBR?  Oh yeah, pitched at 80F then immediately placed in temp controlled box
at 67F.


IMBR,
Don

The recent discussion of "to stir or not to stir" during immersion 
chilling brings to mind Ed Hitchcock's planispiral immersion chiller
described by Ed here years ago and in BT (?) as well.  This chiller
design obviates the need to stir.  To refresh memories:

Steven Smith mentioned his 'hang from the edge of the pot' chiller, which
sounds pretty cool.  I would like to toot my horn once more and promote the
joys of the planispiral chiller.  It's a flat coil (like an electric stove
burner) of 25' of 1/4" OD copper tubing, the last (outer) coil descends to
the bottom of the pot as a support, and the in/out tubes hang over the side
also for support.  The disc/coil is suspended an inch or two below the
surface.  The cooled wort drops to the bottom, warm wort rises up the
sides.  I've never had to stir my wort to get it to chill properly, the
convection currents are sufficient.

And Jim Dipalma agrees heartily!


Of course, i read all this the day AFTER we brewed a Steam beer that will
be fermenting in the 65-75F range.  I know I used this yeast last time on
the exact same recipe, and fermentation ran anywhere from 65-72F, so I was
not anticipating a lot of problems this time around.  Last batch was one of
my favorite brews I've made!


So I'll report back when this finishes up in a couple of weeks...so those
considering a warm-temp 2112, hang in there and I'll let you know how it
works on this recipe.

This isn't necessarily the case, and there is a lot of slop in Wyeast's
figures.  In my own experience, this particular strain is more flexible.  I
did a steam beer a couple of years ago, at 65F, and got *no* "steam"
character, just a very clean lager.  Go figure.

Hi,
        I recently received a case of dirty returnable bottles. I  
decided to soak them for a while in a powder cleaner I got from my  
local supplier which I assume is similiar to B-Brite. Anyway, it  
appears that the bottles have been etched by the cleaner - they have  
a rough feel on the outside.


        Should I disgard these bottles ? Is this a known problem with  
these types of cleaners ? Private e-mail is fine.


Thanx,

Thanks to all who responded to my query about the Wheeler books. In  
summary, Brew Your Own Real Ale at Home (BYORAH) appears to be mostly  
recipes with some (sounds like enough) process. The other book is  
more process and fewer recipes. BYORAH is the newer book. Both  
received great praise. 




I haven't been following the overnight brewing thread too closely, so  
of course I feel qualified to comment. A buddy of mine has put  
several beers in the national using Dave Line's overnight mashing  
technique. Just raise your mash to strike temperature, let it mash  
overnight, sparge in the am. Seems to work just fine for single step  
infusions if your tun holds temperature. Gotts, etc. should. Mash  
temperatures are near pasteurization so that's less of a worry.

From: rlarsen`at`squeaky.free.org (Rich Larsen)
Subject: an observation : Acid and Protein


I was wondering about the chemistry of the ph and protein precipitation.  
This came from watching a cooking show on poaching eggs.  The addition of 
some vinegar or lemon juice to the poaching liquid to make it acidic (lower 
the ph) helps to keep the egg together during the cooking process.  Without 
the acid in the liquid, the egg will spread out rather than stay together in 
a nice lump.  Considering that egg albumin (white) is mainly protein and we 
have an acidic bath here, I wonder if this would be some sort of indication 
about the formation of break material.  I have seen ealier posts about dark 
beers giving a good break amd lighter one remaining cloudy. It is well known 
that darker beer's usually have a low ph and require little adjustment.


What think you all?

Since the target for air levels in beer is below 1 ml/12 oz bottle, this

Subject: CP Fillers


Hi!


I want to second the comments by Micah and Jim Busch concerning the 
results in the Zymurgy article on CP fillers. I too believe that operator 
efficiency is the key.


Before Micah went into commercial brewing he sent me samples that he
filled with his CP filler (Benjamin Products) for air measurement, and 
not a one came in over 1.0 ml/(1/3 liter). Moreover, the average was ~factor
of two lower. I personally bought a Zahm and Nagel CP filler in the
early eighties (when they were a good deal cheaper than they are now!), and 
I know for certain that air levels in the range .25-.5 ml/(1/3 liter) can be
achieved with this filler if it is properly used.


The bottles Zymurgy sent to me were coded, and thus I was not aware of 
which filler was used when doing the measurements for them. I was as surprised
as everyone else when the results were matched with the equipment. My
shock abated when I looked back over my own brewing logs of the early 1980s,
and found that during the first year I used the Z+N filler my air levels
were no better than what reported in Zymurgy. Thus I feel the results in the 
article are typical of what first time users of the CP fillers could expect. 


The four main areas that I found to be the most useful in lowering air
levels are the following: 


    (i) Hands on experience with the filler in question!


    (ii) Pre-evacuation with CO2 - Kenny's comments about this are spot on.
    This is also very much of an art. In fill sessions I still get a few
    outliers (i.e., air levels above 1.0), and in the majority cases the
    culprit is the failure to get a proper CO2 purge of the bottle. In
    modern commercial fillers this is done automatically with a special
    pre-evacuation step that precedes injection of CO2 and filling against
    the CO2 counterpressure.


    (iii) Proper CO2 counterpressure - I have found that this is very much
    dependent on the equipment used. Commercial fillers operate around 12 psi,
    however with the Z+N filler (which has a release value for CO2) I
    get the best results around 15 psi. The key is to get a steady and
    smooth laminar fill.    


    (iv) Foaming - Once the counterpressure is released there should be
    a steady (but not wild) increase in the foam level. The ideal capping
    time is when the foam just reaches the top of the bottle. Big foam
    overs will greatly reduce the bottle air levels, but this should be
    done with care. For example, the bottles associated with lowest air
    levels in the Zymurgy article had very low fill levels (half were only 
    half full and the others were only marginally better). The CO2
    levels in two of these samples were so low that Zymurgy deleted them
    as data points when computing averages. The fill in these cases appeared 
    to remove most of the gas present, CO2 as well as air! Cold filling is
    also a good way to avoid these sort of problems. 


One point that I felt should have received greater emphasis in the article is
crucial role played by bottle storage temperature. Indeed I have found that
thermal abuse after filling is far more destructive than actual air levels.
To cite but just one case, a beer with .3 ml/ (1/3 liter) of air stored
at 30C (85F) stales faster than a beer at 3.0 ml/(1/3 liter) which is stored
at 10C (50F). For everyday homebrew, getting the air down to 2.0 appears
to be sufficient assuming the beer is properly stored. However, I have found
that as the bottle air levels increase the effects of high temperatures become
more severe. This is why in commercial work .25 ml/(1/3 liter) is often cited 
as the upper limit for shipping beer.


In any case, I must say that the main thing I got out of this project was a 
reinforcement of my belief that there is something fundamentally unnatural 
about putting beer in tiny 12 oz. bottles!

>Here's the info I have from the Wyeast spec sheet:

>Warm fermenting bottom cropping strain, ferments well to
>62 deg. F


The sheet I have sez:


"Retains lager characteristics at temperatures up to 65F.
(58-68F range)"


It doesn't contain the linet "Warm fermenting bottom
cropping strain" - obviously a different sheet.  I realize
that's probably not enough to make a rats-ass, but could
they have changed or modified the yeast since the time
between the printing of Jim's sheet and the one I have?
Or was it likely that they just revised the data?  I just got
these spec sheets about a month ago.


The reason I ask this is: I used their Witbier yeast (3944)
and when I took it down to 66F, it hung.  Bring it back to
room temp (72-74) and it would start again.  The specs
say 60-68F.  Has anyone used this yeast between those
temps successfully lately?  I wonder if the printed specs
on this yeast are correct?  Or could it be another factor;
Would under-aeration change the optimum operating temp
of yeast?  I may be guilty of that on this batch.  I asked this
question about a week or 2 ago but got no response.


On another note:  Can someone tell me the difference
between upward infusion and downward infusion?

Subject: Heat Exchanging


     In HBD #1799 Richard Stueven describes a clever method of hanging his 
     immersion chiller from the kettle lid.  In HBD #1800 Doc comments on 
     the "thermochemistry" of immersion chillers.
     
     Wiggling, stirring, or any other type of agitation of an immersion 
     chiller in hot wort will most definitely improve the heat transfer 
     rate.  If there is no forced flow of wort over the tubes, then the 
     heat will be transferred by "free convection", which depends on the 
     change in density of the fluid as it cools to move the cool wort away 
     from the tubing and let more hot fluid take it's turn.  If the heat 
     exchange surface is near the bottom of a pool of hot fluid being 
     *cooled* (as opposed to heated), then the problem is worse because the 
     cooled fluid, being more dense, won't readily move out of the way of 
     the hot fluid.  Richard Stueven's technique of placing the chiller 
     coils near the *top* of the kettle addresses this problem.
     
     Forced convection is always a more efficient mechanism of heat 
     transfer than free convection, GIVEN THE SAME SET OF FLUIDS, 
     TEMPERATURES, MATERIALS, AND DIMENSIONS.  Moving the coils around in 
     the wort induces flow of wort over the tubes, resulting in forced 
     convection.  Several people have observed here that if you put your 
     hand in the cooling water flow with the chiller at rest, and then move 
     the chiller around, you will detect an increase in cooling water 
     outlet temperature, proving that more heat is transferred from the 
     wort to the water when the chiller is in motion.  Try this experiment 
     yourself.  Also, increasing the velocity of either fluid increases the 
     heat transfer rate.  In the case of wort cooling, however, the 
     advantages of increasing velocity are limited by the need to avoid 
     splashing.
     
     We must take care in comparing wort chilling experiences and 
     performances to remember that fluid velocity is not the only variable 
     between chillers (or brewers), and may not even be the most 
     significant.  Other variables which affect the relative performance of 
     chillers are tube material, tube diameter, tube wall thickness, 
     geometry of the coils, length of tubing in the coils, water 
     temperature, water velocity, kettle dimensions, and wort volume.  I am 
     sure that there are others that I have overlooked.  So, as usual, 
     YMMV.

I've been using a hypercard stack to keep my brew notes.  Unfortunately,
it's geared more toward wine making.  It's called "Wine Maker's notebook"
and it's on the huge Mac shareware site, sumex-aim, and it's mirror sites.
I want to start using something better, but I haven't done it yet.  It's OK
for recordkeeping, but it lacks almost alll of the conversions etc... that
SUDs and other software has.  Also, Wine Maker's is really slow--I think
the stack isn't that well written, and, well, it's in HC.  :-(


What should be the best Mac software is a package that is frequently
advertised in Zymurgy, and probably in some other publications.  It's $50
though, and I really would rather have a case of extract.  ;-)  Sorry, I
forget the name of this.  It's by the crafty fox or something like that--I
could be way off on the name--look for a smallish ad that is bordered by a
Macintosh style window with a fox in it.  I wouild really like to hear from
anyone who uses this, whatever it's called.


If you have SoftPC/SoftWindows you can run SUDS on the Mac.  SUDs doesn't
exactly strain your machine, and it runs plently fast enough in emulation.
Especially if you have a Power PC machine--Quadra level machines are good
enough to run SUDs, too, but it would be only about as fast as a slow 386.




I've been playing around with SUDs on my PowerMac and on a 486 notebook.
It has crashed a number of times on the 486, usually refusing to open it's
recipe file--but it's better than Wine Maker's notebook.  Also, it's worked
fine so far on the PowerMac, and it runs almost as fast there as it is on
the 486 notebook.  I'd really like something for my powerbook though.

Fortunately, your not entirely alone :-). I am also a Mac user and there is
indeed a great lack of software for the Mac brewer. The only software I've
seen around is a recipy editor written for Excel and a Hypercard stack
(Beerstax) with information on U.S. Breweries. Both are on
ftp.stanford.edu.
I've been writing a recipy editor/database for Filemaker Pro but the
arithmetic in FM Pro is very limited. It works reasonable but I'm not at
all satisfied with it. It *will* calculate O.G. EBC and IBU's. In all cases
you need a commercial program to run these things which may be a problem.
I've been playing with the idea to write a true recipe editor for the Mac
as a stand alone application but this will be a very time (and homebrew)
consuming task, as I'm not an experienced C-programmer. So is there anybody
out there who knows of more Mac brewing software (especially a recipe
editor) or who is currently working on such a project.

I have a Macintosh.  I've always just assumed that people sensible enough to
buy a Mac were sensible enough to realize that homebrewing software is a silly
thing to fuss with.  I'm mostly kidding, but I guess I've never wanted 
homebrewing software and I'm not sure what I'd do with it if I had it.


Does anyone who uses homebrewing software want to comment on its utility and/or
entertainment value?  Is it primarily for recipe formulation?

Honestly - I think it's a rock-boring thread.  My other two hobbies are also
mostly male, and it comes up there from time to time.  As far as I'm concerned
we should make sure that "homebrewers aren't to women" is never one of the 
reasons, and leave it at that.  Maybe there's something to be learned from 
discussing the topic at great length, but I'm not so sure.

Never read it, but I've brewed some good wheat beers and I imagine myself to

No clue.  If your yeast is pure more == better.

I've never used anything but Wyeast's Weihenstephan alone.  I wouldn't use 
any lager yeast, until someone reports excellent results with it.  Anyone?


> 2) What will the bottle conditioning/lagering do to the final taste? I am

Condition affects the flavor of any beer, including ales.  I had some of my
most recent batch Saturday night, the first bottle in 3 weeks.  It was pitched
probably 3 months ago or more.  It has noticably improved in the last 3 weeks.
Maybe it's peaking, and it won't be very good in another three weeks.


> 3) In his book Warner mentions dark munich malt, but in all my hb catalogs I

Maybe it's 20L vs. 10L.  I've seen many ways of dividing "munich" malt into 
two categories.  20 v. 10, hi v. lo enzyme, and "munich" vs. "aromatic munich."
Maybe that's what he means.  


> 4) I have read that open primary fermentation will yield better results with

I'm not sure what difference the sink makes.  I've always done a closed 
fermentation, but I will say that I used oversized carboys for primaries on 
all of my batches.  They had massive rocky heads and no blow-off, so maybe 
that makes a difference.  (My last two wheat beers have been really yummy.)

I think they might use a little lactic bacteria.  I'm not aware of any yeasts
that make lacto, but they might exist.  You could try to sour your mash.  It
might be related to the strain or handling of the wheat, too.  Or the 
proportion; I think wheat gives a little sourness, so maybe use more.  ?

Yes, yes, yes.  (As long as pronounce his name in some vulgar way.)  I've
used hallertau hersbrucker for both of mine.  Use much less than you would 
for your regular beer.  (I assume this book talks about hops...)

The OSHA limit for CO is 25 ppm- timed-wieghted-averaged over 8 hours,

It's lower explosive limit (LEL) is around 3.5-4%.  Normal practice is to

Actually it's generally free - if you know anyone at all in corn country
they will give it away for a friendly hello.  Certainly a home brew would be
the only cost. (A six pack if you're generous and you want the farmer to get
a really good deal.) At 56 lbs per bushel, it should last a long time at 5
lbs/batch.

I tried this with 8 lbs of Shirer's 2-row and 1/2 lb of wheat flakes.  This
for a 7 gallon batch.  I let the temperature drop to 165 before adding the
corn/water mixture (using ice to speed the process).  Mash was at 155
dropping to 147 after an hour.  I used 1 1/2 oz perle for boiling and 1 oz
of tetnanger for finishing. I also use Superbrau dried yeast (without
rehydration - 50 cents). As Jack sez:


>It has a corn taste if you look for it and I like it a lot. 


Actually I can't taste the corn even when I look for it.  It has a very
light pale color and a nice white (with legs) head.  I artificially
carbonated it in corny kegs (if that matters).  $10 for 7 gal of beer is a
pretty good deal, and when it turns out as good as this - it's even better.


I'm going to serve this at a family gathering this weekend - and I'm sure
I'll convert a few more "lite" drinkers to the wonders of really good beer.

Hello fellow brewers (men and women alike). For a while now, I have

extraction ever, so I immediately suspected the water. After getting a water 
analysis, I found out that my water was a bit hard, but not too bad for 
brewing (as others in my area claim). 


I checked my thermometers.  It turns out that the scientific-grade stainless
steel thermometer I was using was about one degree C off.  Because I was 
mashing at the high end (69 degC), some of you thought it likely that I was
hitting too high of a temperature and trashing my enzymes.  Local hot spots
in the mash would do that, too.  I also did a mini experiment that suggested 
that I was not crushing my grain enough (too coarse of a crush). So, armed 
with an accurate thermometer and more finely crushed grain, I set out to brew 
a Cherry Wheat this past weekend (I know, I know, this beer is becoming pase
rapidly). Instead of mashing at the high end, I did a protein rest at 50 degC,
and then I boosted to 65 degC for 60 minutes. I also added one gallon of 
boiling water to the mash to effect a mashout prior to sparging. I sparged
nice and slowly (around one hour).  Ta-da, I ended up getting 33 pts/lb/
gallon!!!  Happy me! Now I can brew like Dave Miller :)


In my mind, the quality of the crush was most likely to blame, although better
temperature regulation may have also played a role. I thought that I finer
crush would result in more draff washing through during the sparge, but
after recirculating several quarts of wort, it remained crystal clear for
the remainder of the sparge. 


For those of you who emailed me asking me to forward any advice I received,
I recommend that you a)check the reliability of your thermometer, b) check
the quality of your crush (don't be afraid to crush!), and c) closely monitor
the temp of the mash in several different locations. My water is probably
fine, because I did not treat it this time and I still wound up with
an excellent extraction.


Once again, my sincere thanks to many of you who struggled with me these 
last months by providing me with excellent advice. I'd buy you all a brew 
if I ever met you!
