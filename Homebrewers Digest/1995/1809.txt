I use the 5L mini-kegs as well, with the "Party Star" tap. I usually find
the beer foaming a lot when the keg is full but this is not a problem after
the first few pints. I think I should say here that I brew British ales
mostly, with the corresponding lower carbonation level. I have never brewed
a lager, but some months ago I bought three mini-keg with Beck's, and I
remember them foaming a lot. This was not a problem though, since I simply
waited for the foam to recede a little, refilled the glass, waited and so
on. It took a few minutes to pour a glass but in the end the beer had good
carbonation and a nice head. (I won't say that about the taste of Beck's
though. Filled mini-kegs in Germany are cheaper than empty ones in Sweden.)


I have noticed that I get a "sparkler" effect from the tap when I don't
open it fully. I use this to get a nice head on some northern style British
beers. You could try opening the tap fully if you don't do it already.


I have to admit that I really love the foam. Maybe I'm a "foam-head".
("head-head"?)

Subject: Prickly Pear fruit technique


  All this recent talk about Prickly Pear beer drives me to share an 
official Desert Rat secret for dealing with cactus fruit: BURN EM!  Carefully.


  Those "little fuzzy spots" are nasty little thorns that are orders of 
magnitude worse than fiberglass on sweaty skin.  Washing over the fruit 
with a propane torch will zap the thorns so you can safely pick and peel the 
fruit - Note: PEEL THE FRUIT.  FWIW, the real DR technique is to whack the 
fruit off of the cactus with a stick, then flame them over an open fire on 
some sort of rack.  Peel, and eat (the fruit, that is.  Nothing worse than 
naked idiots standing in the desert with red goo on their chins. Geez.)


I personally would still wear the gloves.  I like the heavy black neoprene(?)
"chemical proof" work gloves rather than leather for working around cacti.  
They're hot, but they resist thorns much more effectively.


Warning:  don't set your hair, bystanders, or the terrain on fire whilst 
fulfilling your bizarro urge for cactus fruit, eh?

Yes, do top it off with boiled and cooled water.  This will help to 
prevent oxidation and that little amount of water won't dilute it 
much at all.  Alternitavely if you are concerned you can add some new 
must from a supsequent batch but I don't feel this is necessary.


I had heard of some old wime makers here in town dropping 
(sterilized) marbles into the fermenter to decrease the headspace.  
This sounds like it would work but I never tried it.  Anyone?


And by the way, yes, I am alive.  I have not been consumed by flames

I also saw the tail end of a post regarding AOLers.  Yes, they have a

Unless your memory is like mine of course!    There is a program 
(sorry to get off track here... no affiliation, etc)  called Spell

appended a tagline automatically after spell checking (another good

   I happened to be reading the label of the Electro-Sol box the other day,
(don't ask why) and to my surprise I found that it was very nearly the same
as the label on B-Brite.  Being a frugal type, I set about looking for the
cheapest dishwasher detergent available and reading labels, Ah Ha The local
discount drug store (CVS) carries a brand containing no perfume, the rest of
the ingredients are identical (listed in the same order, I'm assuming that
the law is the same as for food) with some bleach added.  I have used this
stuff to soak bottles for over a week in an aluminum tub, I did not notice
any pitting of the Al, so I guess that the bleach level is pretty low or not
chlorine.  Worked as well as B-Brite maybe better! B-brite costs about $10
per pound, diswasher stuff cost $1.19 per 5 pounds, Hummm which is the better
deal?

Subject: PVC braided tubing


HBD Collective -


I am stepping into all grain brewing this season, and am interested to hear if
any of you have used braided PVC tubing to handle hot wort out of the
mash/lauder tun.  This tubing is double thick -- I'm guessing it won't collapse
like vinyl tubing does when in contact with hot wort.  It looks like normal
clear tubing with blue/white "braids" running through it.


But unfortuantely I'm unable to relax with this tubing.  I remember reading
somewhere (Zymurgy?) that you should only use vinyl tubing.  But I've also seen
hop back designs using PVC pipe.  So what is the deal here? Is the Poly-vinyl
Chloride (PVC) tubing safe for brewing?  Does anyone have any experience with
this PVC tubing? Is there another type of tubing I should be looking for?  Will
PVC tubing add toxins/mess with my beloved beer?

together.  I have them planted next to my garage with a "trellis" up to only
one single point.(I didn't think they were going to grow).  My

Here is another siphon trick.


If you siphoning from a carbouy, get a blow off cap and insert a 
racking cane through the large diameter spout. Attach tubing to the 
top of the racking cane and put the cap onto the carbouy. Run the 
tubing to the new vessel. Here is the easy part but some of the 
infection paronoids will cringe. With you mouth blow into the unused 
spout on the cap. No pump, no mess, very little time. You only have 
to blow for about 2-3 seconds and you have a great siphon going. I 
have yet to have any contaminated brews so I dont think there is any 
real risk of contamination using this method.

     I would have pitched a bit cooler than 70F, but 70F should work for 
     these yeasts.  If your F.G at bottling was really 1022, and given your 
     good initial ferment and the tailing off effect you experienced, my 
     guess is you may have under-aerated.  
     
     Did you aerate the wort, and for how long?  I had similar outcomes 
     that were caused primarily by under-aeration.  As to when to bottle, I 
     do so when 1) the F.G. is stabilized, and 2) when it clears in the 
     secondary.  But pls take this with a grain of salt. I am curious about 
     possible taste benefits of "aging" in secondary (and in frig) beyond 
     simple "clarification", but that is part of another question I am 
     trying to find time to look into :-(

Subject: Cooling the Wort


        I have good luck using two methods of adding Ice to the wort to cool
it down.
   One great way is to use zip lock bags (the large ones) put a gallon of
water in and   freeze the puppy.  When it's time to cool things down I dip
the bag in a cool sanatizing agent, B-bright etc., and float them in the
firmenter.  This takes about three bags to bring things to ptiching temp for
ales.
        If, heaven forbid, I haven't planned ahead or my lovely spouse has
made room for "more ipmortant" items  I just top off the firmenter with ice
cubes. Now we have clorinated water that I run through a clean charcoal
filter but it works out fine.

I found that after about 30 pumps that it is best to just give it a try. You 
may not have heard the pouch pop, but it is usually ready. After about 30 
pumps the pump starts to get hard use. This is when you should release. 
Sometimes it works sometimes it does not, but you do not get any spillage

I live about three hours North of Indy and I stop by Wine Art whenever I 
am in town.  I was there a week ago today (Tuesday).


Whenever I am in there, he tries to sell me real hard on those kits.  As
I understand, it is a complete, "advanced" extract kit.  All the things
you would do to spruce up a kit (specialty grains, flavor and aroma hops,
etc.)are in there.


I am not the most cost effective brewer.  Here on the Southeast shore of
Lake Michigan, homebrew shops aren't plenty.  The few that are here, the
prices are outrageous.  (Like, three month old Wyeast packs for $11.95?)
I mail order and since I travel for work, I stop by homebrew shops around
the American Midwest to stock up.  I buy Northwest extract by the case
and whole hops by the pound (Just Hops, excellent service, SDA)


But I think one of those kits at Wine art were around forty bucks!  Even
I won't pay that!  Their three week wine kits are intriguing, beautiful
packaging, but also forty bucks!

or less.  This means there are a number of equations being used out
there...


I've been using a sg vs. temp curve I found in the HBD some time back, 
and which the author (I think) fit to data in the Handbook of Chemistry
and Physics (the "CRC").  Anyway, this is a 3rd-order fit to allow you
to correct a direct sg reading to any h-meter calibration temperature.
Barring any transcription errors, I have:


correction = 1.62860587e-05(tc - t) - 5.84994855e-06(tc^2 - t^2)
             + 1.53243635e-08(tc^3 - t^3)                             (1)


where t is the sample temperature (deg C) and tc is the hydrometer
calibration temperature (deg C).  To see how this general equation
compared to the one Chris presented (which was for a 60F hydrometer),
I replaced tc with 15.56C (60F) and expanded:


correction = -1.1622e-03 - 2.5334e-04t + 1.4155e-03t^2  
             -1.53243635e-08t^3                                       (2)


Compare this with Chris's equation:


correction = -2.0331e-03 - 3.2491e-05t + 1.1043e-06t^2                (3)




The two equations provide the following corrections:

Assuming the two equations have been transcribed correctly from the

there is someone out there who has a handle on goodness-of-fit for
these regressions it would be interesting to root this out a bit.


Salvaged Sanke dip tubes.
- ------------------------


Last week someone asked what use these tubes could be put to after dicing
up Sanke kegs.  I cut one off for use as a hydrometer jar--I found a
plastic cap that fit over the bottom and just taped it on with 
electrician's tape.  A more craftsmanlike job could be done by making a
base/bottom cap from something like a hockey puck--whatever.


I mentioned this before, but with tap water that hovers around 60F in
the hottest part of the summer, I can cool a sample to calibration temp
in just a minute or so.  The metal hydrometer jar has the heat transfer
thing going for it, and is unbreakable.  Being stainless is another nice
feature.  Commercial micros I've been to seem to just use rigid copper
pipe.


Obligatory Chill Time Data Contribution
- ---------------------------------------


A 47ft dual-concentric coil of 3/8" copper with the maximum flow rate
I can get from the kitchen, (running 55-60F water) cools 3.5 gal of
your basic 40-60 gravity wort from 190F to 65-70F in under 4 minutes.
The drop from 190 to 120F occurs too fast to time it with just two
hands and binocular eyeballs.  Last night, with the water at 60F exactly
coming from a 3/4" copper supply line thru the garden hose, it took
4 minutes to chill 2.5 gal of 1.130-weight wort to 70F.  A bit more of
a challenge (in ALL respects) :-).

Well, since I regularly compare beer to bread, let's look at the bread market,
even in your supermarket.  In my part of the country, you have lots of "whole 
wheat" breads (even Wonder Bread whole wheat!) and very few "soft white white 
white" breads.  Sure, the "mega bakers" have less flavorful, cheaper products 
and more market share, but the bakeries are selling more bread and even 
supermarkets are selling bread baked there or close by.

I tend to agree that craft brewing will not die when most are bought out 
by the megas.  Sure, the desire for good beer is a fad for most people who
are into it, but there are enough of us left to constitute a market worth 
selling to.  The craft beer industry will probably be at half its current 
size in 15 years regardless of who owns what.  At the same time, when they 
"dummy up" or "water down" beers, this is a major loss.  If they can make
as much or more money making good beer, they will continue to do so.


As for betting on which companies will be bought up, I would think that 
either Grant's or Sierra Nevada would be a real nice addition to any mega's
portfolio, but both are a bit too big for a hostile takeover.  (If they're
even public, which I don't know.)


The Win-It-Too company was engineered for a takeover.  My prediction - early
'97, they'll be bought (or bailed) out by Stroh's, Leinenkugel's or Interbrew.
(In that order of probability.)

  Don't believe it. Rinse. Trust me.


  This past spring, I entered a bock in a competition. The judging was done
at a site in my hometown, so I made arrangements with the organizer to hand
deliver my entry. The night before the competition, I CP-filled the bottles,
which had been soaking in a bucket of BBrite. It was 1 AM, I was just a little
groggy, and inadvertantly neglected to rinse out the bottles, just filled 
them and capped them.
  Next day, I was sitting next to the panel that was judging the sub-category
that I'd entered. On that panel was a National judge, who's also a friend and
a fellow member of the same homebrew club. I listened as nearly the entire
flight was scored in the low to mid 20s, a very dismal collection of beers
indeed.
  At the end of the day, I retrieved my scoresheets, and saw comments like
"sulfury" and "solvent-like", along with a score of 22. I *knew* these
flavors weren't in the beer, so I went back to where the stewards were, and
asked them to pull one of the remaining two bottles. Sure enough, the judges'
comments were right on the money, the beer had a harsh, chemical solvent-like
taste.
  Fast forward two weeks, I was sitting in the living room of this same
National judge, and poured him a glass of the same bock from a bottle that
had been rinsed. He remarked that it was "really quite good", then asked me
why I hadn't entered it as "I'd score this a 35, at least". BTW, the beer that
won the competiton scored just over 37.

  I think the temp of the input water is key. I have a deep dug well, and in
the depths of a New England winter, its temperature is typically 40F-45F.
I use an immersion chiller, 50' of 3/8" copper, and can chill a 10 gallon
batch in about 20 minutes during the winter, no stirring.
  This time of year, using the same chiller and volume of wort, it takes ~35
minutes, almost twice as long. I haven't measured the temp of the water, I'd
guesstimate it's about 70F. I'm brewing this coming Saturday, I'll measure
both the temp and the chilling time, and report back.
  A couple of notes on the "design" of this chiller. I used 50' because it
came in a 50' roll, and I was too lazy to cut it. I just left a few feet on
the ends for the inlet/outlet connections, then coiled it around a corny keg.
I used some copper wire to arrange the coils so the ones near the top of the
chiller were spaced more closely together than the coils near the bottom.
I also connected the inlet so that the cold water entering the chiller went
through the top coils first. It seemed to me that these latter two steps would
allow the chiller to work with the natural convection currents, rather than
fight against them, though I could be way off on this. I haven't taken a
course that required me to solve a heat transfer problem since the late '60s.
I'd like to hear from those who report 40 minutes to chill 5 gallons with an
immersion chiller. What length and diameter of tubing are you using? Which
end of the coils are you connecting the inlet to??
  One final observation. I've noticed when the wort is done chilling, the
outside of the kettle below the liquid level is quite cool, whereas the
outside of the kettle above the liquid level is still very warm, almost hot
to the touch. I think the poor heat conductivity of SS has something to do
with it. Anybody else notice this??

I was so peeved that Suzette Smith accused me of being sexist and

post.  Apparently, the word "nice" was dropped, probably due to my
own "user error".  


What I meant to say was that I think that women should be made to feel
welcome to our hobby.  If they don't want to brew, that shouldn't bother
us - unless their reason for not wanting to brew is that we make them 
feel unwelcome.


I -do- think that the sundry issues of why men prefer certain hobbies more
than women is an intractable mess, and just plain dull.  The answers to the
question "why do fewer women brew?" are usually rife with BS, people's pet
theories, and finger-pointing.  It's just not a thread worth pursuing.  
Maybe it's dead now...  


Seriously, if you encounter some guy who is making women feel uninvited to our

If you encounter someone who'd rather talk about hops than pop-psych, well,

Subject: Wort Dilution


As there has been some discussion of wort dilution in the last few numbers
I thought I'd toss in my method. I assume the problem to be solved is: I
have x gallons of wort at gravity y and want gavity z < x. To what volume
should I dilute?. I do this by first finding the  pounds of extract I have.
The pounds per gallon of wort is approximately  w = .0834*y + .000317*y*y
where y is the desired gravity in degrees Plato.The total extract is then W
= w*x. Next find the amount of extract per gallon required to give the
desired gravity, z. The same formula gives r = .0834*z + .000317*z*z. After
the dilution r is equal to the total extract, W, divided by the diluted
volume, V i.e. r = W/V. This is easily solved for V as V = W/r and the
water to be added is approximately, but not exactly, V - x.


A related problem is: I have x gallons of wort at gravity y. What will the
gravity be if I dilute to V gallons? The first step is the same i.e. I
calculate that I have a total of W pounds of extract in the x gallons.
After dilution the pounds per gallon are r = W/V and we want the gravity
for this concentration. It is obtained from P = 11.987*r -.54376*r*r +
 .0215*r*r*r.


For those working with specific gravity the Plato gravity can be obtained from
P = .016 + .2569*u - .000192*u*u where  u = 1000*(SG - 1) for example if
the specific gravity is 1.036 then u = 36.

of two teaspoons per gallon of water.  One should then rinse to remove 
toxic iodine residue.  Other sources say that one should not exceed 0.5 
oz. per five gallons.  No rinsing is necessary.  Who is right?


Secondly, I have read with some interest recently about *racking* from 
the brewpot to the primary.  In my five or six batches so far, I have 
never racked to the primary, simply because my instructions said nothing 
about it.  Is is beneficial to rack to the primary rather than simply 
pouring?

Many factors come into play in chilling wort.  One of the most
important is the heat capacity (amount of heat (Kcal) needed to raise
the temperature 1^C) of the medium being cooled.  I would expect that
a high gravity wort has a higher heat capacity than plain water or a
low gravity wort and therefore would need more water to cool it to a
given temperature all other things being equal.


Something else to consider is the viscosity of the medium being cooled.
Honey is very viscous and therefore forms thick boundary layers around
the cooling coil which act as insulation and impede heat transfer.  A
high gravity wort is more viscous that a low gravity wort, but nowhere
near as viscous as honey.

Absolutely.

I'd be concerned about ensuring that the peroxide is totally decomposed.
To the extent that it's not, it is still available to act as a sanitizer
and an oxidizer.  Chlorine bleach will sanitize at the part per million
level.  I suspect peroxide would also.

In HBD#1808 Jim Busch correctly cautions re: an earlier post of mine:


>Pat relates:
>

><chiller = approx 20-25 minutes
>

Right you are, Jim, and my apologies to all for any confusion caused.  Once
the temp of the cooling wort has dropped to about 80 deg or so, I stop
stirring, remove the chiller, and let the wort sit all quiet like and covered
for at least 10 minutes to let the cold break settle.  I then siphon using an
aeration-tube at the end of the flex tubing and this further cools the wort
as it fills the fermentor.  By the time I'm done the wort is usually in the
65-68 deg. F. area.  


Cheers,
