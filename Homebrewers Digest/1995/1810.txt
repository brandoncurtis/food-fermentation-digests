Subject: Malt/Sugar Entries for SUDS


I think there's a need for a clearing house of data for the SUDS 
malt/sugar database--it would sure be helpful to have good data
regarding yields and color contributions for a number of products
not provided in the software.  Examples include blackstrap molasses,
black treacle, flaked maize, etc.


Now that I think of it, I suppose Mike Taylor is that clearinghouse.
He may not like the idea, but it makes sense to me.  Maybe there is
already a more complete compiled database and I'm just out of the loop?


Well, I've mentioned three sugar sources for which I'd like to get
good data, I'm confident other brewers have some more.  If the
experts can recommend procedures to get the data empirically, I'd
be happy to do it for some of these items.  I'm having trouble thinking
of an acceptable method for getting the ppg and SRM for black treacle,
for example, and an acceptable technique for adjuncts is even more
elusive.

Subject: 5 gallon fermenter and 2.5 gallon batch


I made my second batch yesterday out of an Ironmaster Stout Kit. I've been
warned about adding sugar, so I halved the water instead. The final gravity
was slightly above 1.050. The airlock was very busy this morning. So far so
good.


Today I'm worrying about the extra amount of air in the 5 gallon plastic
fermenter. On the other hand - I've heard about open fermenters. Can anyone
enlighten me on the consequences of this?


I'll appreciate any advice for my next batch. I love Guinness, so I'm
definitively after something dark and bitter. The problem is that I have
trouble getting malt extracts here in Norway - I seem to be stuck with these
kits. Anyone have any advice on combinating kits into drinkable beer?

Subject: Another Chilling Data Point


FWIW, I have been using an immersion chiller consisting of a  60' coil of
3/8" OD copper (1/4"L?) to cool 10+ gal in my keg from boiling to ~ 65 F in
15 - 20 min.  No joke!  Of course, this feat requires constant stirring of
the wort and cold tap water (50 F).  Unfortunately, I no longer live in an
area where I have 50 F tap water, but I can still cool within a half hour
_without_ stirring using this chilller and my 55 - 60 F water.  Yes, the
wort does stratify if I don't stir it.


My only complaint would be the waste of water, but this can be minimized by
using recirculated ice-water.  It may also speed chilling.

Subject: B-Brite Alternative?




I read Don's post, and fully agree with his observation that dishwashing 
detergent (powder) has the same chemical composition as B-Brite. I do not 
necessarily agree the CVS is a discount drug store, since it seems to me 
they have little of either (discounts or drugs).


ALL (brand name) dishwashing powder is one of the cheapest on any shelf, has 
the same ingredients listed as B-Brite, has no perfume, and seems to 
work. I can not attest to the specific proportions of ingredients, but 
I have been using ALL for several years with no sanitation problem, so I 
believe it works. It also costs a fraction of the cost of B-Brite, and 
does not foam.


BTW, do rinse after immersion in detergent.

Subject: Corn Question


Greetings to the collective,


(Actually, this is for the people that have been talking lately about using
corn in brewing - but anyone can answer.)


I read the post from last week concerning using unmodified corn as an
adjunct.  I too live in corn country, unfortunately 99% of the corn is of
the cow feed variety.  


My questions:


1)  What kinds of corn should (or should not) be used - sweet, sugar, cow,
indian?


2)  What is the preparation?  (cut from the cob and used fresh?  dried somehow?)


The last person said he gets over 56# per bushel of corn.  Now if that is
fresh from the field, most of the weight will be in husk and cob, so the
final yield will be much lower if it is cut.


If all this was answered in the original post, could someone let me know
what # it was?  (I must have missed it:-)

Subject: Correction/SG and Plato Equations/Wort Dilution


In my #1809 post there's an error...in the table "Eqn 2" should be "Eqn 3".


SG to Plato and Back
- --------------------


The Plato-to-sg conversion equation presented by AJ in #1809 provides
yet another source of great enjoyment. That's the first time I've seen
his equation, but back in May Jeorg Houck forwarded me the following:


deg P = -676.67 + 1286.4*sg - 800.47*sg^2 + 190.74*sg^3


The interesting thing is how well AJ's eqn agrees with this cubic.  
The Plato values given by the two eqn's agree to within .1 P up to
sg = 90, then converge again up to about sg = 169 where they again start
to diverge.  But even up to sg ~ 200 the two results agree to about .2 P.


But Jeorg also forwarded a simpler equation that works *very* well in spite
of its unimpressive appearance:


deg P = (259*sg - 259)/sg      Note there's only one constant to remember!


This approximation is pretty spectacular.  It agrees with the cubic equation
to within .1 P up to sg = 90, to within .2 P up to sg = 116, and to within
 .5 P to sg = 168. Someone may know *why* it agrees so well--I don't, and I
prefer to remember the inverse:  sg = 259/(259 - Plato)


Wort Dilution (the reason this Plato thing got going in the first place):
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------


This problem almost solves itself if you can use SI units (here's your
chance, Dave, I've left a shot wide open!).  The premise again is:


You have x litres of wort at gravity sg1, and want to know how many
litres of water to add to get some lower gravity sg2.  First, read sg1 in
Plato degrees (or convert it) to get p1, and do the same with the desired
sg2 to get p2.  Given


 v1 = original wort volume (L)
 w1 = original wort "weight" (Kg)
 dw = weight of water to be added (Kg)
 p1 = original sg in deg Plato
 p2 = desired sg in deg Plato
 e1 = original extract weight (Kg), then


 w1 = sg1*v1          orig wort weight is orig sg * vol (in Litres)
 e1 = (p1/100)*w1     extract weight is orig Plato * orig weight (Kg)
 (w1 + dw)            final wort weight (Kg)
 
The final Plato gravity times final wort weight has to provide the
extract weight e1, because the sugar weight hasn't changed...


 (p2/100)(w1 + dw) = e1  and set this equal to the earlier expression for


e1 giving:


 (p2/100)(w1 + dw) = (p1/100)*w1  then solve for dw...


 dw = -w1(p2 - p1)/p2, or what is the same:


 ------------->   dw = (sg1*v1)(p2 - p1)/p2    (1)  <---------------


Example:  20L of 1.060 wort is to be reduced to 1.045 through addition
          of plain water.  How much is needed?


 Convert 1.060 and 1.045 to Platos of 14.7 and 11.2, respectively. Then 


 dw = -(1.060*20)(11.2 - 14.7)/11.2  = 6.625 Kg, OR, ~6.6 Litres


The only constant in this exercise is the "259" to convert sg to Plato--
and you could just use your hydrometer as the conversion table instead, and
go directly into Eqn (1).


With SI units, a hydrometer and a measuring glass graduated in litres,
Eqn (1) is all that's needed--NO constants of any kind need be remembered,
transcribed, or typed into the calculator.  Just another way to do bizniss.

Subject: 8/11 Immersion Chilling Nickel


Hi Group,
I just received HBD #1805 and the posts on Immersion Chilling have prompted me
to toss in my nickel.


I have a monster Immersion chiller. It is 50 ft of 1/2" copper tubing wrapped
in a double (inner, outer) coil about a foot high. It is connected via vinyl
tubing to an immersion pump which goes in the Hot Water Tank (keg) after I am
done with it. I mean, after mashing and lautering I empty it and fill it with
cold water (70F) from the hose. 


The pump recirculates this water from the chiller to the keg and back. I do
this to conserve water here in S.Cal, but it has another advantage. The first 5
gallons of water thru the chiller are boiling hot (almost). I discharge this
into another bucket and pour it out later. Then I start dropping 10 lb blocks
of ice into the keg to keep up the temperature differential. This does alot to
speed up my chilling. If I lived up north obtaining cold water to chill with
wouldnt be a problem. I always stir while chilling, either with the paddle that
has been in the wort since the boil or by moving the chiller around inside the
boiling keg. I can chill 10 gallons in a half hour to 60F depending on how much
ice I use. I still use about 20 gallons of water to chill with but I would
probably use more just connected to the garden hose and as Dion says, that last
20 degrees would take much longer.

I use, generally, 1 oz/5gallons. Sometimes a little like 1.5 oz/5 gallons.
When getting bottles ready for filling I use 2 oz/7 gallons. I also rinse.

While there may be something to this, especially for those who have large
brew lengths. I suspect weight is the issue and ease of manipulating a large
kettel. In my brewery we use a mesh filter stuck in the funnel and once the
wort is chilled (ice/water filled sink) my brew partner will pour the wort
into the carboy (I don't because of 2 trashed disks).

Subject: more on SG/T corrections


in HBD #1809, Kirk Fleming follows up on the SG/T thread:


>>>  I guess the question is whether the physics of the problem is better
modeled with 2nd or 3rd order curves.  If there is someone out there who has a
handle on goodness-of-fit for these regressions it would be interesting to root
this out a bit.  <<<


if my understanding of polynomial expansions is correct, there is no
theoretical basis for the exact order of a polynomial regression--it's an
empirical fit which always improves with the addition of higher order terms.  i
also understand that polynomial regressions are notoriously bad for
extrapolating beyond the range of the data fit.  this doesn't really apply
here,  however, since we're only considered with a limited temperature range. 
the equation i listed was a 2nd order fit to thermal expansion data for water
over the whole temperature range from its freezing to boiling points (from the
Handbook of Physical Constants, 1966, S.P. Clark, editor).  you could use a
higher order regression if you wanted to, but your equations just get more
complicated unnecessarily.  if you agree that the uncertainty of a hydrometer
reading is +/- 0.001, then the 2nd and 3rd order regressions are identical
within error of the measurement.


the bottom line is that as long as your wort is between 30 and 80 degress F,
you don't really need to apply a temperature correction to the SG reading you
get with your hydrometer.  if, on the other hand, you're taking your SG reading
at some higher temperature (i.e., pre-chilling), then you should correct for
the thermal expansion of your wort.  Kirk's provided a nice table that shows
the correction you should apply at a given temperature.

Subject: Crowd Pleaser Ale


When I first started brewing, I tried to please the beer drinkers around
me.  I experimented with rice solids, rice syrups, dextrose, and honey as
adjuncts, and doing everything I could do to brew light colored beer short
of bleaching the malt extract.


One day, my girlfriend commented my brews were getting to the point where
they were "almost as good as Coors."  She is still my girlfriend, but ever
since then I have brewed for myself and enjoyed brewing much more.  "You
don't like my brew?  Then stop at the store on the way over buy Zima for
all I care!


I have since fallen in love with IPA and especially the Cascade hop.  Anchor
Liberty, my current commercial favorite, is a little, shall we say, wimpy
on the hops.


Anyway, I will be having an end to Summer party.  (You are all invited, BYOK)
I was thinking about brewing something a little more crowd friendly.  Short
of mixing my brew with club soda, do any of you have any favorite crowd

Subject: Chillin' Tales


I use liquid nitrogen to chill my wort in 45 seconds.  It is extremely
expensive and dangerous, much like exploding bottles, peroxide poisoning
and all.  Please refer to the LN2 FAQ for how to get started.


Don't chill too long though, or the cold break won't settle before the
whole thing freezes around the immersion chiller like a great big wortsicle.


I can't stir using the chiller because my hand freezes to the copper coils.
Is my beer ruined?


I was thinking about using liquid oxygen right into the wort instead.  That
way, I can aerate as well.  LOX is MUCH more expensive and dangerous, so I
think it would be better.


As a scuba diver, I don mask, regulator, and tank.  Then I purge the house
of oxygen with LOTS of CO2.  Haven't had an oxidized batch yet.  


Lately, I keep thinking back to that very first batch where I did everything
wrong and it turned out great.

Subject: Pitching Temps and affects


Several posters asked what are the negative consequences of pitching
yeast at high temps.  The easy answer is more fusel alcohols and more
esters.  How much this bothers you depends on yeast strain and the
beer being made.  Some esters are desirable in some beers.  Most
fusels are undesirable, and can lead to headaches.  I dont usually
post excerpts of my Brewing Techniques column here but this is a
timely point to do so.  I`ll also make a shameless plug to say how
great BT is and you should join by emailing to btcirc`at`aol.com.


Excerpt from my next column, edited and enhanced by A.J. deLange:


"Increased temperature has several effects on yeast metabolism. Fusel
alcohol production is increased. The levels of intracellular acetyl
coenzyme A are increased. As this is the starting point for lipid and
sterol synthesis lipid anabolism is increased which results in increased
availablilty of acyl coenzyme A products. These can combine with the fusel
alcohols to form the higher esters. Acetyl-coenzyme A is itself an
acyl-coenzyme A molecule and, as ethanol is the alcohol in highest
concentration, ethyl acetate is the predominant ester in beer. Note that
where the wort has been insufficiently aerated some of the  acetyl-coenzyme
A which would ordinarily go into sterol synthesis does not do so because of
the lack of oxygen. This can then flow into the lipid synthesis pathway
producing extra acyl-coenzyme A molecules and thus higher ester levels."


Good brewing,

Subject: Dilution Theory made Simple?


Hi Group,
For the last couple days I have been bemused at the apparent complexity that
many respected participants of this group have directed to the Dilution
problem.
To me it seems very simple.


If you have collected 7 gallons of 1.042 wort, and you are going to boil it
down to 5 gallons, what will be your final OG?
1. You have 7 gallons of 42 points per gallon wort. Total points = 7x42 = 294
2. The OG of 294 pts in 5 gallons = 294/5 = 58.8 or 1.059


Likewise, If you are boiling 3 gallons of 1.080 wort and plan on diluting it to
5 gallons in the fermenter:
1. 3 x 80ppg = 240 pts total
2. 240 pts/5 gal = 48 or an OG of 1.048


What could be simpler?  (of course, the last time I posted something like this,
on the delta V of solutions, I was quickly shown my error by several friends. I
dont think that will be the case this time, but I wont hold my breath too
long.)

Subject: siphons and carboys




  I have to comment that there is an easier and more sanitary
way to siphon beer into and out of a carboy than the method
proposed by David Wright. If you want to slightly pressurize
or depressurize the head space in the carboy (which is a good 
way to get your siphon started), you are better off using a 
pipet bulb than your mouth. (These can be had from  FISHER 
SCIENTIFIC 1-800-766-7000 at the inflated price of about $5 
and many other places if you care to shop around.)
   
  I often use a two-holed rubber stopper at top of the carboy
for siphoning. I have a short glass tube that goes through
the stopper into the head space to use with the pipet bulb.
I use a longer glass tube (at least 3/8 inch diameter) which
can reach down to the bottom of the carboy and has a bend on 
top to avoid crimping the flexible tubing. 


  It is a much more sanitary solution to the same problem.

I have been noticing a lot of bandwidth about B-Brite and iodophor.  I just

I may be mistaken, but iodophor is a sanitizer, while B-Brite is a
detergent.  This is a big difference.  B-Brite does not sanitize.   On the
other side you still need to clean your equipment before you use iodophor.
I've noticed a number of people confusing what B-Brite does and what
iodophor does.  If I am wrong, someone please slap me around and set me
straight.


Relatedly, in HBD #1809, Fr. Bradley A.M. Barber writes,


>I have conflicting information on the use of Iodophor.  One source


My personal experience with iodophor is 12.5ppm.  That roughly translates
to 0.1 oz. per 1 gallon of cold water.  At this concentration no rinsing is
necessary, although you do need to drip dry your equipment.  I have never
had problems (or infections) with this concentration.  That seems to be
true with other people I've talked to about using iodophor.


On a completely different subject....


I hate to bring gelatin back up again, but there is one thing that is
driving me crazy at nights.  When do you add the gelatin?  I've heard right
before racking to the secondary, sometime during the secondary, and to the
bottling bucket.  I've added gelatin during the secondary with less than
specatcular results, i.e., clumps of gook floating in my brew.  Private
e-mail is fine.


Thanks in advance!

Subject: more siphoning


In HBD1809 David Wright presents a straightforward method of siphoning using 
a carboy cap. (I am assuming he is referring to one of the orange caps). I 
used to use a similar method but experienced a great deal of oxidation with 
the batches I siphoned doing this. I made a few simple changes to the basics 
(as outlined by David) and they eliminated my oxidation problem...
        1.        Instead of using 3/8 I.D. tubing I switched to 5/16 I.D.
                from the racking tube to the receiving vessel (carboy,
                bottling bucket, etc.) tubing. This gave a tighter seal
                which prevent any O2 (air) from getting sucked in between
                the wall of the tubing and the outer wall of the racking
                wand.
        2.        Instead of blowing on the tube attached to the carboy cap,
                I pumped CO2 into the tube. By keeping modest pressure
                applied to the "in" side of the carboy cap, then siphon
                just chugs along. I know this may seem like a waste of CO2,
                but if it saves a brew, it's worth it.
Hope this helps!

     I tried to siphon my cooled wort _once_. Partial wort boil. It 
     siphoned like molasses so I gave up on it (Perhaps I cooled it a bit 
     too much; to maybe 60F). It _did_ look pretty cool tho; oozing out in 
     a viscous stream under water....
     
     Was trying to avoid HSA. After reading more posts here, it seems that 
     cooling to below 80F is sufficient to avoid HSA, and at that temp I 
     shouldn't get the molasses effect.  Will give it another shot.

If pitch temps. are "supposed to be" low at around 60-70 degrees, why 
have I had two excellent batches of beer when I rehydrated my yeast in 
100 degree water (as recommended in two sources, one Charlie's) for 15 
mins. and then pitched it in about 100 degree wort?  I have experimented 
with this method of pitching and have derived two of my best batches.  I 
have done some minimalist brewing (e.g., not taking SG measurements, 
doing barebones sanitation, etc.) and it has turned out excellently, 
too.  Is it just my batches and brewing conditions, or can pitch temps. 
be played with more than we assume?

Subject: Alcoholic Lemonade


In Sydney last summer, my girlfriend and I tried some alcoholic lemonade 
brewed (?) at a brewpub there (can't remember the name).  It was very 
nice.  Very effervescent (sp?), and quite high in alcohol, but quite 
refreshing nonetheless. I have since taken up homebrewing and am now
contemplating trying to duplicate it, but am interested in what 
others have to say about it.  Is the acidity going to be a problem?  
Should I just make some Country-Time and throw some yeast in?  


My thought at this point is to do some gravity experiments with 
Country-Time, and aim for the high side (so as to end up with residual 
sweetness).  I'd boil this (10 minutes?) for sanitation only, pitch a 
yeast that poops out on high gravity brews, and some yeast nutrient (I 
assume lemonade is not as rich in nutrients as wort), and see what 
happens.  Also would like to finish with champagne yeast (the bubbles and 
flavor profile of the stuff we tried was something like a mimosa heavy on 
the champagne side), but that would probably defeat the goal of residual 
sweetness.


I suppose I'm most interested in whether anyone's tried this before, but 
would also appreciate educated guesses as to how I might make some. Any 
takers?

extract in Nut Brown Ale:


<< Has anyone brewed a batch using hazelnut extract?  How did it turn

        Steve Armbrust and Jeff Frane advise that the 1993 AHA convention was 
held in Portland and the commemorative brew was a hazelnut brown ale (brewed by 
Chris Studach (?)).  I checked and the recipe for this beer is in the Summer 
1994 issue of __Zymurgy__ (Volume 17, No. 2).


        I will need to check the actual recipe, but the recollection seemed to 
be that between two and three ounces of pure extract was called for.  
Apparently the hard part is finding someone who carries the real thing.  A lot 
of people carry hazelnut oil, but this is probably not appropriate.


        Any ideas on where to get the pure extract?  I have seen Royal Piper 
Cordial Extracts (used to make cordials by adding vodka).  Would this work?  
Thanks to all who responded.

Subject: Slow cooling = DMS???


     Last week, someone mentioned that one of the reasons to chill wort 
     quickly, other than for sanitation, was to minimize formation of DMS 
     in this critical period.  This triggered a thought about the common 
     methodology of adding fruit at the end of the boil and steeping for a 
     short period.  Wouldn't this almost guarantee a significant amount of 
     DMS formation?  I have used this method before, and ended up with a 
     very soft, rounded beer that could be described as having the typical 
     buttery character.  The funny thing is, I think this is a somewhat 
     desirable quality at low levels in SOME beers, but definitely not 
     fruit beers.  I definitely prefer crisp clean flavors in fruit beers, 
     and will stick with adding fruit and/or flavors in the secondary from 
     now on.  I have read recommendations for people to encourage some DMS 
     formation (by steeping after the boil) to enhance the malty characters 
     of some ales.  Does anyone do this?  How long should you steep before 
     you got too much?  What styles would this benefit?  Comments?

At a recent CABA (Canadian Amateur Brewers Assoc) event, we had a Molson
Bigwig give a talk (name of Moss?). He pointed out that ingredients 
constituted only 5-10% (I don't remember the exact figure) of the pre-tax
cost of a beer. After taxes, it's half again that cost. Further he claimed 
that they were able to easily reproduce various craft beers, and had done so
on occasion. The real reason for price differences between craft beer and
mega-swill beer is economies of scale: it's cheaper to brew in big volumes.
He said that the market didn't want what we call "good" beer. People like
swill. Now if more good beer was available, eventually people's tastes
will mature, but they are trying to make good beer available eg. through their
signature series. 
        I am no Molson fan, but I couldn't fault the argument. Though
certain styles they'll NEVER duplicate (lambics are the most obvious example)
, and they won't be as adventurous as craft brewers in their attitude, even
if most beer is mega-brewed in the future, who cares as long as it's beer

Subject: Immersion chill data / Mashout & extraction


Dear Friends, as the wort-chill discussion proceeds, we now have Jim DiPalma
requesting some info of a type I have handy.  I get immersion chill times of
30 to 40 minutes to 15-17 C (59-63 F) without stirring.  I don't stir
because I want the Junk to settle to the bottom of the kettle so as to bring
as little along into the fermenter as possible.  My particulars: chiller is
a 15 m (just shy of 50 ft) copper coil, OD 12 mm, ID 10 mm (0.47 and 0.39
in. respectively).  This time of year, in the depths of the Sydney "winter",
water temp is a respectable 12 to 15 C (54 to 59 F).  Cold water goes on the
*upper* end of the coil in order to bring the coldest water into play at the
top, where the warmest wort will always be (this, IMO, is the key to getting
shorter chill times without stirring).  My kettle is a 40 L (10.6 US gal)
aluminum pot, wall thickness about 4 mm (0.16 in.).  My typical situation is
to have from 20 to 23 L (5.3 to 6.1 US gal) of bitter wort to chill, having
gravities in the range 1045 to 1070--I've not made anything stronger in my
~1.3 year (15 US months :-}) in Sydney.  Also, I have not yet brewed through
an entire year with the same setup--have been accumulating gear as I go--so
can't offer much in the way of noticing seasonal changes.  I usually have
the water flow at only a modest rate at first, because it is quite easy to
chill when the wort is still very hot, then I open it up to a stronger flow
once the temperature of the returned water falls to about 22-25 C (71-77 F).
I think the main factors allowing me the short chill times I get are: inlet
arrangement as mentioned above; kettle is Al not SS; long chiller with a
generous OD and relatively thin wall (is it all that thin?).


*******


There has been some talk about mashouts increasing extraction efficiency in
the past couple digests too.  It should be kept in mind that one of the
effects of mashing out is to make the sweet wort less viscous, more fluid.
Thus whatever you have actually produced during conversion is physically
easier to extract.  There may of course be "chemical" benefits to the higher
T step as well.

For those who wondered about my comments using ice to cool the wort, I use
Britta filtered water (city water through a charcol/ion filter to get the
heavy metals and chlorine out) in sterilized tupperware-like plastic
containers.  I suppose I should sterilize the containers before I open them
again, just to make sure.  I use the aquarium bubbler and a sterilized
bubble stone to introduce O2 and even out the temps.  Interesting to have a
primary ice cold on top and hot on the bottom.  :-)


Now if I could figure out how to keep the aquarium bubbler from causing a
foam head to form and come squirting out over the bathroom floor, woodwork,
out under the door and in general causing the whole house to smell of pale
malt extract/Kent Golding (I'm not complaining about the aromas, mind you,
it's just so sticky....), I'd really have it knocked.
