Subject: Wheat / esters, phenols / hopback / new Web page


Whew!


I guess a lot of subjects built up while we were offline.  :-)


Let's get started...


####################
Wheat Malt Diastatic Power:


Yes, malted wheat has sufficient diastatic power to convert itself.  In
fact, according the info in the BJCP Study Guide (available at
http://www.umich.edu/~spencer/beer/judge/studyguide_v2)  malted wheat has a
little MORE power than Pale Ale malt.  Here are some numbers (in degrees
Lintner):


 6-row Lager      100-200
 2-row Lager      63-70
 Pale Ale         36
 Malted Wheat     49


####################
Esters & Phenols:


palmer`at`San-Jose.ate.slb.com (Eric Palmer) asks what esters and phenols
taste like.


My understanding is that they are two large classes of chemicals.  The
individual chemicals can taste very different.  But the terms usually used
to describe them are that esters tend to taste "fruity" (e.g., banana,
plum, citrus, etc).  Phenols tend to taste "medicinal" (e.g., Listerine,
band-aid, etc.)


####################
Hop Back:


I have been toying with the idea of using a hop back.  But I do not want to
move from my immersion chiller to a Counter Flow chiller (I like the ease
of use and the ease of cleaning, and I don't trust the sanitation of CFs).


Here is what I thought I might do:  construct a screen of some sort and
place it ~ 2-3 inches below the top of a 33 qt enamel-on-steel kettle.  I
could then place hops on the screen and laddle/pour cooled wort thru this
screen.  Then siphon the wort from under the screen into a fermenter.


Opinions?  Is this a really dumb idea?  My big problem that I have yet to
resolve is whether I will get any hop character at all using cooled wort.
It would be effective (I imagine) for removing break.  Any other (better)
ideas out there?

My Home Brew Club (Pacific Gravity from Culver City, CA) now has a Web
Page.  Check it out!  It's brand new, so stuff is being added all the time.

Subject: Irish WYEAST Bombs?


   
   Greetings, 
     I thought I had been either dropped from the list, or that the
majority of people were on vacation or something.  Luckily it was just
an AI Robot malfunction..."Open the HBD Door, Hal!" 


   I have a question about Wyeast #1684 (?) the Irish one.  Has anyone
had a similar experience of the extraordinarily quick fermentation
that I got? I brewed on a Sunday (First all grain batch in a while)
and was able to bottle on the very next Friday!  Wow! I tried it the
other day, and it is one of the better batches I've made. 


  Now for the real question:  Will the bottles be OK?  Did I just
create two cases of bombs?  Is this why they call the 22 ounce bottles
"Bombers?" 


      TIA, & Hurry up and get here, hockey season!

Subject: Re: scum skimming, pumps




Hi All,


  In HBD#1814, Brian Pickerill asks:


>Does anybody know
>of a cheap ($10) source for propane burners?


  About a year ago, I bought a multijet propane burner casting for $15.50
from Metal Fusion, (part# WKAF2, phone# (504)736-0201). I used the hose and
regulator (5 psi) from an old gas grill, and mounted the casting on an angle
iron rack under my mash tun.
  I'm not sure what the burner is rated for, but I've used it for temperature
step mashes with ~30# of grist in the tun, worked very well. Seems to put
out plenty of heat.
  You might consider calling Metal Fusion and asking for the catalog. They
sell a variety of different castings as "parts". I know the $15.50 is a
little over your price limit :-), and I'm not sure how that price would
compare to the cost of converting a natural gas heater. Just wanted to give
you another option.


*******************************************************************


  In HBD#1815, Kevin Imel asks about scum skimming:


>Should the foamy scum that forms during the boil (especially with wheat
>beers) be skimmed off?  Having started my illustrious brewing career making
>mead, I have a well learned impulse to skim the scum.  Is this the right
>idea or does it matter?  If I skim the scum am I removing some of the mouth
>and head of my beer? What is the collective wisdom of the HBD on this one?


  I confess, I've always been a scum skimmer. Gives me something to do while
hovering over the brew kettle, and flinging the gobs of scum around can be
way fun! I usually open the garage door and shoot for the basketball hoop
out in the driveway.
  All kidding aside, what I've read about this is the foamy scum is mostly
high molecular weight proteins, the kind that cause haze and stability
problems in the finished beer. Also, removing the scum seems to help prevent
boilovers. Once removed, the surface of the wort is exposed to the air, the
boil stabilizes faster than if I don't skim.
  Haven't noticed any negative effects on head retention from doing this. My
beers are fine in that regard, and I've developed great 3-point range!


*******************************************************************


  In HBD#1816, Rich Lenihan asks about pumps:


>I need a high-temp pump to complete my brewing system. It doesn't
>have to be self-priming (although that would be nice) but it should have
>enough force to move hot water and/or wort to a height of 8 feet. It should
>also be food-grade as well as easy to clean and operate. Finally, it should
>introduce little or no air into the liquid being moved. I've heard about the
>March pumps, but I don't have specific model #'s.


  March MDX-3 or MDXT-3, US Plastics Corp, 1-800-537-9724. The distinction
between these two models is that the MDX-3 has 1/2" O.D. smooth connectors
that you can slip tubing right over, the MDXT-3 has a 1/2" FPT threaded
connector on the inlet, 3/8" FPT on the outlet. At 8 feet of head space, the
graph in the catalog sez this pump will move about 4.5 GPM.
  I have the MDX-3, the housing is glass filled polypropylene. No temp specs
given, but I've pumped water at about 200F, and wort at ~160F, through it
with no problems. The catalog sez the pump is designed for "sanitary liquid
food applications."
  The pump doesn't introduce air, but it's not self-priming, either. I think
you're going to have a problem finding such a pump. Every pump I found that
was magnetic drive and produced a laminar flow was not self-priming. I think
you'd have to go with some kind of peristaltic pump if you want self-priming.
Personally, this hasn't been a problem. Mine is set up to be gravity fed, once
the housing fills up, the pump starts. No big deal.
  
>I would also
>appreciate any tips you might have regarding set-up, tubing, connectors, etc.


  One caveat: the standard poly tubing that many of us use gets a bit soft
at 150F-200F, the tubing attached to the pump inlet actually collapsed when I
started the pump. I had to use the braided, reinforced PVC to pump hot
liquids. YMMV.


         Cheers,

Subject: Wheat extract


<In HBD #1815 (August 26), Bill Bunning questioned whether 
<wheat malt had the diastatic power to permit a wheat beer to be 
<made from a 100% wheat grist.  In my opinion, a 100% wheat grist 
<can be used.


This is correct.


<I believe that had barley malt been added to the grain 
<bill of this beer that the extract yield would have been higher. 
<In my opinion, extract yield suffers as the percentage of wheat 
<in the grist increases.


Actually, wheat malt has the highest extract potential.  The difficulty
arises in getting this extract out of the mash and lauter tun and
into the brew kettle.  Thats why in practice 70% wheat is generally
accepted as the upper limit where one can still have acceptable
lauter results. 


FWIW, DeWolf Pale ale has 80.8% Fine Grind extract potential while
DeWolf Wheat has 83.5%, and Shreier 2 row has 81%.  (data from 
Shreier, probably on one shipment of 94 malt).


Good brewing,

Subject: Wyeast 1338 European Ale yeast




Has anyone else experienced long lag times with this yeast?  The first
time I used it, I just pitched the contents of the smack pack and it
took almost 36 hours for signs of fermentation to appear.  I used this
yeast again, this time pitching from a 1 quart starter that was
prepared the day before.  It's been 24 hours since I pitched from the
starter and nothing has happened yet.  Wort temperature was about 68^F
(this was a main goal for this batch) and the wort was as well aerated
as previous successful batches.  The only possible problem I can see
is that I usually keep the fermenter in a wash tub of water that is
around 70^F, but yesterday I just reused the ice water from the
chilling phase, and as a result the wort may have gotten down below
60^F for the first six hours.  Could this have caused the yeast to go
dormant or slowed them down, even with a higher pitching rate?

Subject: RTP yeast cultures  




RTP is a new product available in the Boston area.  The product has been made 
available by a professional microbiologist and home brewer.  He is a  member 
of Bostons largest home brew club and has supplied cultures to many Boston 
area brew pubs.  He recently introduced the product to a few homebrew shops 
and a brew on premisise.  RTP cultures are available for 5 and 12 gallon 
batches, there are about 6 ale yeast and a German lager yeast.     


I have no financial intrest in the venture though I would like to see it be 
successful.  Here is a homebrewer that saw the potential for a product and 
delivered it to the market at a competitive price.

Subject: Lagering Advice Please




     I want to make my first batch of German lager and I've got a couple of 
     questions about the temperature of fermentation.
     
     I've read a couple of things on it and there seems to be some 
     discrepancy regarding the temperature of fermentation and storage.
     
     My beer-supply-store guy says that it should be primary fermented at 
     45-55 degrees for about 3 weeks, then secondary fermented then stored 
     at the same temperature.  From what I read, these temperatures are for 
     american lagers, and I want to make a German Lager.
     
     A book I read says to primary ferment it at 45-55 degrees, then 
     secondary ferment it at 60-65 degrees, then store it at 32 degrees.
     
     Anybody know what the right way to do it is?
     
     Also -- I think the warmest I can get my refrigerator is 44 degrees.  
     Will this work?  Again What temp should it be at.  If it is still too 
     cold, how do I get an external thermostat -- what is THAT toy going to 
     cost me?  
     
     Please respond either direct or on this digest.

Subject: Re: MM Motorization


Kirk Fleming <FLEMINGKR`at`afmcfafb.fafb.af.mil> tried to reply to Rob ? 
about motorizing the MaltMill (tm) but couldn't find articles discussing 
optimum roller RPMs, etc.  I saved the information on my computer at 
home, knowing I'd want it someday.  Now, I don't have the reference 
memorized, but I recently decided to look at upgrading from my Corona to 
a roller miller.  [Anyone out there have a used one for a good price?]  
I'd be glad to provide the source if asked.  If I remember correctly, the 
reference related a discussion with Jack Schm. about motorizing his 
roller mills.  [Standard warning about invalidating the warranty.]  The 
suggestion was for no more than 200 RPM and 1/4 HP electric motor with a 
belt drive.  A geared, direct drive won't allow any slippage in the rare 
event that the rollers jam.  There was no mention of other safety devices 
like a hopper lid lockout or shear shaft keys.  I suppose if I were going 
to put it in a commercial shop, I'd consider it.  I'm looking at 
something I can mount to the work bench when I want to grind grain.


One other option you might consider.  I "motorized" my Corona by removing 
the bolt that held the handle on and replacing it with one that had a hex 
head.  I then keyed up a standard nut driver in my electric drill.  Short 
bursts on the trigger crank the grain through in no time at all.  A 
variable speed drill ought to be adjustable to ~200 RPM, making this an 
alternative.  The problem I ran into running the Corona continuously with 
the drill was all the flour in the air made a mess.

Subject: Hunter fix and defrost clock


   Well, add one more satisfied customer (at least for a day).  Last night I
did the two 12V 1W zener diode from RS fix on my broken Hunter unit.  It has
functioned properly for a day.
   On a related note.  I certainly hope that everybody who uses a
refridgerator for fermenting/lagering has remembered to either use an old
fashioned "defrost it yourself" fridge or disabled the defrost clock.  If you
explore underneath the fridge, probably near the back side you will find a
little "black box" with a knob on it and two wires plugged into it, this will
probably be the clock.  Just short the two wires and voila, no more auto
defrost cycle.  BTW this clock is in my limited experience the most common
cause of a "dead" refridgerator, they tend to break in the off cycle.

steep for a couple minutes, then transferred the whole shebang to
the fermenter.  I racked it again a couple of days later.


Tasting Notes:
The majority of the taste/aroma came from the ginger.  The spices
really came through.  The hops and malt were balanced and neither
dominated.  The pumpkin showed up in the color, a nice orangish/
brown.  I didn't get much taste though.  It was my wife's favorite
beer, it was also the hit of the Christmas party.  Good Luck I hope
this helps.


BTW this was based on a recipe in the zymurgy's Indigenous Beers
Issue, sorry don't remember the authors name.

Subject: Re: Mega Craft Breweries


I tried to send this a week ago, but it got lost in the shuffle to HBD's new
address. Hope I'm not beating a dead thread, but I wanted to toss in my two
p's on the megaswillery invasion of the micros.


The megaswilleries definitely don't want to eliminate the craft brewing
industry--they just want a piece of the action. In the first half of 1995,
beer sales at Anheuser-Busch grew by less than 1% from the first half of
1994, while sales at Miller and Coors actually declined. By contrast, craft
brewers have been growing by 50% or more annually, and they have pretty fat
profit margins.


As an example, take Redhook (I think I'll take one right now...), which went
public recently. Anheuser-Busch paid $18 million in October 1994 for a 25%
stake in Redhook. When Redhook issued stock two weeks ago, A-B invested
another $10 million to maintain its 25% stake. Based on the current share
price (as of 8/29) of $33 a share, A-B's stake (which originally cost $28
million) is now worth nearly $70 million!


So megas like A-B will gladly leave the actual brewing operations of the
micros alone, as long as they can siphon off their share of the profits. I
expect this unfortunate invasion to continue, since the micros are probably
willing to give up part ownership in order to have access to the megas'
national distribution system and big marketing dollars.


As for who's next...maybe one of the many Portland-area micros?

Subject: Low-Alcohol Beer Follow-Up, Pt. I


                        PART I
INTRODUCTION.
        In the July 6, 1995 issue of the Digest (HBD #1774), I 
requested information on making alcohol-free beer from the 
collective.  My motivation for making alcohol-free beer was 
that a friend of ours had recently become pregnant but still 
wanted to have an occasional beer.  I thought I would provide a 
summary of the responses I received and my experience with 
making low alcohol beer.


THE RESPONSES.
        I want to thank everyone who responded to my request.  
All of the responses were very helpful.  I received twenty-four 
responses to my post, which provided the following input:
        -- 4 responders suggested using heat (78-82 C) to 
remove the alcohol from regularly-made beer;
        -- 4 responders suggested freezing regularly-made beer, 
and pouring off the alcohol (that would not freeze at the 
temperature water freezes at).  Most of these responders were 
very pessimistic about the heating method, claiming that it 
would ruin the flavor of the beer;
        -- 2 responders suggested making the beer with non- or 
low-fermentables.  The primary suggestion was to make the beer 
entirely with Cara-pils, which would give an O.G. of no more 
than 1.010, and thus keep fermentation and alcohol production 
at a minimum;
        -- 1 responder suggested that using a reactant that 
would turn the alcohol into a type of salt might be a 
possibility;
        -- 1 responder felt that it was too expensive and 
impractical for a homebrewer to make non-alcohol beer;
        -- 7 responders though that pregnant women should just 
drink regular beer in moderation, and that reports of 
detrimental effects of moderate alcohol consumption on fetuses 
were largely exaggerated;
        -- 3 people then responded to those posts that any risk 
alcohol might pose to fetuses was too large to take;
        -- 2 responders suggested that non-alcohol malt 
beverages be substituted for beer during pregnancy.  
Specifically, a German product called "malzbier," and a 
Hispanic product called "malta goya," were suggested.
        Coincidentally, the Fall 1995 issue of Zymurgy 
contained a small blurb regarding an article written by Dr. 
Siegfried Gunther and Stefan Vetter for Brewing and Beverage 
Industry International (April 1994 edition) regarding 
alcohol-free brewing methods.  That article divided methods 
into "biologic" and "physical".  The three biologic methods 
noted were:
   1. Interrupting fermentation with a one minute 
pasteurization at 140 F at the desired alcohol level;
   2. Brewing a low-gravity beer and using yeast of the strain 
Saccharomyces iudwiggii, which will ferment only simple sugars;
   3. Mixing the yeast and wort at 32 F and filtering the yeast 
out after a rest period (duration not specified).
        The three physical methods noted were:
   1. Heating the finished beer at atmospheric pressure.  The 
authors noted damage to the beer that made this method 
undesirable;
   2. Reverse osmosis.  Removing alcohol by passage through 
diaphragms by use of pressure gradients;
   3. Dialysis.  Passing the beer through fibers that are 
bathed in a counterflow dialysate that produces a concentration 
gradient.


THE PLAN.
        Armed with this information, I decided to merge two of 
the most popular concepts together.  I decided to brew a fairly 
low gravity beer, and then to freeze it after fermentation so 
that the alcohol could be poured off.  For reasons that I will 
go into later, and although not planned, I also ended up using 
a third method of removal--heat--but in a different way that 
was suggested.
        The recipe I used was for a pale ale-type beer, and 
consisted of the following:


   3#     Domestic Malted Barley
   1.75#  Munich Malt
   1.25#  Cara-pils
  12 ozs. Canadian Wheat
   6 ozs. English Crystal (80L)
   2 ozs. Domestic Crystal (120L)
 .88 ozs. Northern Brewers (8.2% A)--60 mins.
2.69 ozs. Liberty (2.7% A)         --10 mins.
          Wyeast American Ale yeast (#1056)


        The mash was a standard infusion mash, except that the 
Cara-pils was not added until the mash was brought to 158 F.  
The boil was for 90 mins.  A 300 ml yeast starter and 3 tsp. 
yeast food were pitched into 6 gals.  The O.G. was 1.031.
        Primary fermentation lasted for four days at 68 F. 
Secondary fermentation was for another ten days at 68 F.  F.G. 
was 1.012.
        270.4 fl. ozs. was separated from the main batch after 
fermentation was complete for use in the "no alcohol 
experiment".


REMOVING THE ALCOHOL.
        The 270.4 "experimental" ozs. were racked into 4, 
2-liter plastic soda bottles.  Those bottles were placed 
upside-down (on their caps) in a freezer at between 0 and 10 F 
for 36 hours.  The fluid in the bottles was solid at the end of 
that period.  
        By inverting the bottles, the fluid that did not freeze 
(including the alcohol) was at the cap-end of the bottle, 
making it easier to pour it off.  The biggest surprise of this 
whole process was that when I opened the cap on the bottles, 
they virtually exploded.  After the first bottle, and cleaning 
the sink, cabinets, walls and ceilings of alcohol sludge, I 
opened the remaining three bottles underneath a plastic bucket. 
Each one of them exploded.  I estimate that 770 ml of the 
alcohol sludge (I will call the "extract") was lost on the 
walls and down the sink.  I did manage to save 950 ml of the
extract.
        There was an unexpected problem when I removed the 950 
ml extract.  I had been forewarned that this freezing method 
removed a lot of body and hop bitterness (thus the 1# Cara-pils 
and 35 IBUs), but no one had mentioned the loss of color.  This 
was supposed to be a pale ale, and had been the appropriate 
color when I froze the beer.  But when the extract was removed 
the beer remaining frozen in the 2 liter bottles was almost as 
clear as ice--no color at all.  The extract, on the other hand, 
was as dark as a stout.  The extract also had a S.G. of 1.039 
and smelled like alcohol and HOPS (capitalized on purpose and 
for effect).
        So, I was left with the problem of a colorless, no 
alcohol beer.  This is when I decided to employ the third 
method of de-alcoholization--heat.  Numerous people had warned 
me about the bad effects of heat on the beer for alcohol 
removal, and so I decided to heat only the extract.  After all, 
that's where the alcohol was.  After I removed the alcohol from 
the extract, I planned to put the extract back in the beer to 
give it color again.
        Those suggesting heat as an alcohol removal method 
instructed that alcohol evaporates at 78-82 C (I did not check 
this fact).  Therefore, I heated the 950 ml of extract at 
174-178 F for 13 minutes, which resulted in 600 ml of extract 
at 1.069.  After cooling, I returned this extract to the 
melting beer.


CARBONATION.
        After going to all this trouble, I did not want to add 
any alcohol back into the beer through priming.  I was also 
concerned about the viability of the yeast after the 
freezing/thawing/heating process.  So, I put the thawed beer 
into a 3 gallon keg and force carbonated the beer for 
approximately 2.6 volumes of CO(2).  The end result was 244 
ozs. (7,222.4 ml) of low alcohol beer.

content and extraction for the beer, will be sent in a separate

Subject: Low Alcohol Beer Follow-Up, Pt. II


INTRODUCTION.
        In Part I of this post, I described my attempt to 
make a low alcohol beer by starting with a low gravity beer 
and then removing the alcohol by freezing the beer and 
pouring off the alcohol.  In this follow-up post, I will set 
out my estimates of how efficient that alcohol removal process 
was.


THE NUMBERS.
        My Disclaimer:  I am not a chemist, physicist, 
mathemetician, professional brewer, alchemist, botanist, or 
floral arranger.  However, I am a lawyer and know how 
to write a disclaimer.  Accordingly, none of the following 
theories, theorems, equations, hypotheses, statements, opinions 
and conclusions should be relied on.  If you need a truly 
alcohol-free brew for health or safety reasons, please do not 
rely on my (probably flawed) methodology and results.  Instead, 
buy a tried and tested commercial, non-alcohol beer.  The 
purpose of this post is the amusement of the homebrewing 
collective.  If anyone sees an error in any of the following 
(and I'm sure there are a few), please point it out.  I don't 
mind admitting that I struggled greatly with these equations 
and the theory underlying them.


        The Alcohol Content of the Original Beer.
        I started by figuring the alcohol content of the beer 
before I did anything unnatural to it.  I used the following 
formulas (taken from the Summer 1995 Zymurgy):


   O.G. 1.031     F.G. 1.012


   A%(by weight)=76.08(OG-FG)/(1.775-OG)
                =76.08(1.031-1.012)/(1.775-1.031)
                =76.08(.019)/1.744
                =1.996574585


   A%(by volume)=A%(weight)[FG/.794]
                =1.996574585[1.012/.794]
                =2.544752491


        Thus the beer had a very low alcohol content of 
approximately 2.5% even before doing anything to it.
        I next computed the volume of actual alcohol in the 
beer.  The total beer volume was 244 ozs. (7,222.4 ml), and so 
I multiplied that number by the percent alcohol by volume to 
determine the number of milliliters of alcohol in the beer:


  7,222.4 ml beer x .02544752491 = 203.6779104 ml alcohol


        
        Composition of the Extract.
        Out of necessity, I made the assumption that the 
freezing method removed all of the alcohol in the beer with the 
extract, and that no alcohol remained in the frozen beer.  
Therefore, all 203.6779104 ml of alcohol were contained in the 
extract.
        I saved 950 ml of the extract and, based on the 
beginning and ending volumes of beer, estimate that I lost 
approximately 770 ml of the extract down the sink, on the 
walls, etc.  Therefore, the total volume of the extract was 950 
+ 770, or 1,720 ml.  
        Again, out of necessity I assumed that the percentage 
of alcohol in the extract I lost was the same as the percentage 
of alcohol in the extract I saved.  This does not seem to be an 
outrageous assumption to make.  Then I computed the volume of 
alcohol that was lost with the lost extract:
        
[770 ml lost extract/1,720 ml total extract volume] x 
   203.6779104 ml alcohol = 91.1813901199 ml alcohol lost


203.6779104 ml alcohol - 91.1813901199 ml alcohol lost =
   112.496520281 ml alcohol in 950 ml saved extract




        Specific Gravity of the Extract Without Alcohol.
        Next you must compute the specific gravity of the 
extract as if there were no alcohol in it.  I used the number 
 .796 as the S.G. of alcohol in this equation:


(extract gravity)(extract volume)=
   (SG alcohol)(alcohol volume)+(SG of extract without
    alcohol)(alcohol-free extract volume)
(1.039)(950 ml)=(.796)(112.496520281)+(SG)(837.503479719)
         987.05=89.5472301436+(SG)837.503479719
  897.502769857=(SG)837.503479719
  1.07164064578=SG of 950 ml extract without alcohol


        Adjusting the Specific Gravity for Volume.
        The next calculation adjusts the specific gravity of 
the extract without alcohol (1.07164064578) for the reduction 
in volume of the extract that occurred when it was heated.  The 
extract volume was reduced from 950 ml to 600 ml. From the 
above, though, it was determined that only 837.503479719 ml of 
the original extract was not alcohol.  Assuming there was a 
proportional decrease in the volume of extract that was alcohol 
and the volume of extract that was not alcohol, the non-alcohol 
portion of the extract would have been reduced from 
837.503479719 ml to 528.949566144.  [The reality is that the 
non-alcohol part of the extract actually evaporated slightly 
quicker than the alcohol part. This can be demonstrated through 
several equations which I have not included here.]
        The specific gravity of the non-alcohol part of the 
extract is adjusted for the reduction in volume as follows:


837.503479719 ml (begin volume)/528.949566144 (end volume) 
  x 1.07164064578 (SG non-alcohol part) 
  = 1.11343102248 (SG of non-alcohol part of 600 ml extract)




        Calculating the Alcohol Content of the Processed Beer.
        Finally, taking the results from the foregoing, the new 
alcohol content of the beer, after the freezing and heating 
processes, is calculated.


[Actual SG of extract]/[SG of extract without alcohol]
   = Efficiency Factor
Efficiency Factor x Original Alcohol Vol.=Actual Alcohol Volume


1.069/1.11343102248 = .60829919797 [efficiency factor]
 .60829919797 x 112.496520281 ml alcohol = 68.4315430613 ml alc.


        The remaining amount of alcohol in the extract, which 
is added back to the beer, is 68.4315430613 ml.  The total 
volume of the beer is 7,222.4 ml.  Thus, it is simple to do the 
final calculation and figure out the alcohol content of the 
beer by volume:


68.4315430613 ml/7,222.4 ml = .0094749035, or approximately 1% 


        The beer therefore still has about 1% alcohol by volume 
because the extraction method was only about 61% efficient.




COMPARISON OF BEERS.
        The untreated beer was only slightly darker (maybe 2-3 
SRM) than the beer which had been frozen and had alcohol 
removed.  The untreated beer also had slightly more hoppiness 
and a little more body.  However, on the whole I can not say 
that the alcohol removal process dramatically changed the beer. 
While I would certainly prefer a regular pale ale, I found both 
the treated and untreated versions of this beer to be very 
drinkable, and certainly recognizable as beer.




METHODS OF IMPROVEMENT.  
        If I were to attempt a no- or low-alcohol beer again, 
which, by the way, is a lot of work, I would use this same 
method.  Freezing the beer, removing the extract, heating only 
the extract, and returning the extract to the frozen beer gives 
the benefits of alcohol removal without losing all of the body, 
hoppiness and color found in the extract.
        Improvement is needed primarily on the efficiency of 
the heating process to remove alcohol.  A longer heating 
process is necessary.  Through a series of other calculations, 
I estimated that to get a beer of this OG/FG to less than .5% 
alcohol v/v (the legal definition for a no-alcohol beer), 
approximately 90% of the extract would have to be evaporated by 
heating.  One-half of the volume that evaporates could be 
replaced by water without harming the color or flavor of the 
extract.


        I would be very interested in receiving any comments or 
suggestions anyone might have.

Subject: Sour Mash Beer Recipes?


I have the interest span of a fruit fly - I'm not proud of it, but I accept
it. A month ago, I was possessed by brewing the perfect American Pale Ale.
I will get back to this obsession shortly. But for the moment I've found a
new diversion...


A couple of weeks ago, I tried brewing a minor spinoff of a sour mash beer
recipe by Micah Millspaw which I found on Cats Meow III. It's still in
secondary, but already it's apparent (to my taste) that this is something
worth pursuing. What (incredibly) little I can find to read on this style
suggests (nay, hints) that this is a truly native US style worthy of the
same respect as Steam Beer and Cream Ale. I'm presently working on my
second recipe, incorporating several hints from Randy Mosher's excellent
book (no connection, yada, yada, yada) and some suggestions posted by Bill
Vaughan (I forget where). My current thinking is as follows:


Sour Mash Beer (5 gal.)
8.5 lb American 2 row malt
1.5 lb Rye malt
1 lb Cara Pils malt
1 lb 95-115L Crystal malt
1 oz Galena hops (60 min)
1 oz Cascade hops (30 min)
1/4 tsp powdered Irish Moss (10 min)
Yogurt culture
American Ale yeast


Mash 2 lb of 2 row malt using 50-60-70 schedule
Mashout `at` 175=B0F for 5 minutes
Cool to 90=B0F and stir in yogurt culture
Sour for two days
Mash remaining malts using 50-60-70 schedule
Mashout at 175=B0F for 5 minutes
Combine mashes
Sparge at 170=B0F
Boil for 90 min
Cool and pitch yeast


Any comments on this formulation? Anybody got a REALLY GOOD RECIPE? C'mon,
let's bring this American classic back into vogue - I'm tired of having to
brewing funky European styles to dabble with bacterial "innoculations".
TIA.

 If it is available please post on where it is.  Also is Meow 3 available in

of one at a time.  Inquiring minds want to know.

Can someone post or send me a good recipe for a pilsner?  I was in the
Czech Republic recently and drank a lot of their Pilsner Urquell on tap
which turned out to be about the best I've ever had.  I've tried the 
pilsner recipes in "The new joy of..." but they were not very close to
the real thing.  


Thanks,

Subject: Carboy Hairline Cracks


I was taking a close look at my 5 Gal. carboy while I was cleaning it
and noticed many thin cracks encircling the conical section near the
neck.  It wasn't very noticeable because they're kind of hard to see.
Its only a year old and has seen a dozen batches.  I bought it new and
never looked at it really closely before so I'm not sure if I bought it
with the cracks.  I'm going to replace it because of the thought of it
breaking while I'm carring it full of beer in the house.  Is this
typical of 5 Gal. carboys made in Mexico?  Does anyone regularly recycle
their carboys?  TIA

For my 5 gallon Gott cooler I found that the spigot screwed right out and
that a plastic bulkhead fitting fit tightly in its place. I used the 3/8 "
tube size union made out of polypropylene, allowing access to the 3/8"
copper manifold on the inside, and a vinyl tube outflow with a tubing
clamp. The nice thing is that when I switched over to a larger tun, I could
just return the spigot to make the cooler usable for drinks again. I don't
know if the Igloo spigot just screws out or not.


I get my plastics parts from US Plastics 1-800-537-9724. The bulkhead union
is #61123, $1.30. There is a $2 addition for orders under $20. Their
catalog has a wide variety of valves, fittings, and tubing.


For my new tun I discovered another neat trick; Using a 48 quart
rectangular Coleman cooler, with a flip-up plug, I tried to unscrew that
one as described above. It became clear that it was going to be
irreversible, and I wanted not to destroy the cooler. Instead, I found that
a piece of vinyl "bubble tubing" placed from the inside would fit snugly in
the hole, leaving a segment inside to connect to the manifold and an
outflow piece too. Bubble tubing is the kind that has areas of enlarged
diameter spaced at meter intervals. Cutting the tubing at these bubbles
results in a funnel-shaped end that can be easily connected to other
tubing. I got mine from my lab, and I've never seen bubble tubing
elsewhere. The scientific supply houses carry it (Fisher, VWR, etc.) at
some high price for about 50 feet.  You might also accomplish the same end
by boring a 3/8" hole in a stopper to fit the opening, and sliding this
along the tubing to make a removable bulkhead union too.
