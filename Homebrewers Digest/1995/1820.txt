Ahhhh! I can finally post!. I have been chomping at the bit on this one and
am finally able to post, belated as it may be. Immersion chillers can work
well without stirring. Contrary to popular belief, the wort does not
necessarily have to be static (in the absence of stirring) in an immersion
chiller. When I built my chiller, I wanted to keep the lid on while cooling
the wort to keep bugs, dust, cat out of the wort while maximizing free
convection. In other words, no stirring. Before turning on the cooling
water, I usually give the wort a couple of good stirs, put the lid on and go
for it without further stirring. But after reading several recent posts, I
decided to chill a 7 gallon batch with no stirring what so ever. The wort
temperature went from boiling to 76 deg F in 18 minutes. Data as follows
(time:temp): 0:200, 1:160, 2:138, 3:125, 4:117, 5:109, 6:103, 7:97, 9:90,
10:87, 11:85, 13:82, 14:80, 15:78, 16:77, 17:76, 18:75. Here are the conditions:
 -tap water temperature (chiller inlet temp) - 66 deg F
 -ambient temperature - 75 deg F
 -flowrate through chiller - didn't measure but water is supplied by a
typical submersible well -pump in the back yard
 -7 gallons of wort in 33 qt enamel-on-steel canning/crab! pot with lid 
 -50 ft garden hose to the chiller and 25 ft  of exit hose


I think chiller construction is the key. We've heard talk about forced
convection(stirring) and natural convection(no stirring). I constructed a
double coil out of 34 ft of 3/8 copper. Read Kirk Flemings post in #1809.
His chiller sounds similar. The outer coil is 12 in diameter and the inner
is 7.5 in diameter. My reasoning behind this design was to develop
reenforcing circulation cells (sorta donut shaped) in the pot.  I initially
tested the design with two water boils.  Through refraction in the water, I
could see the currents generated during the cooling. Pretty amazing to
watch. Two tests yielded 16 and 18 minutes from boiling to 75 degrees F with
no stirring and the pot lid on. Now I have no idea whether this is an
optimum configuration, but it works good enough for me. Out of 5 batches,
all but one have chilled from boiling to 75 deg F in less than 20 minutes
with no stirring other than an initial stir before chilling. One batch went
from boiling to 75 degrees in 29 minutes which really had me puzzled until I
discovered the washing machine was running and in the rinse cycle so I guess
there was some reduction in flow rate through the chiller. One thing I
noticed when sweating copper joints; it's easy to overdo it and get an
excessive amount of solder inside of the tube. I discovered the opening in
one joint nearly half blocked by solder. In a chiller, this would
substantially reduce the flowrate through the chiller and the efficiency
along with it. May be why some chillers don't perform well. Then again,
maybe I'm the only one who has done this. The other thing you might consider
when building a double coil chiller, or a single coil for that matter, is
keeping the tubes well alligned over each other. I used my shop vac for
forming the outer bank and a paint can for the inner bank. Because the
convection flow of wort over the tubes is reenforcing, I think that neatly
stacked tubes is better than haphazardly stacked tubes where you probably
get lots of small eddie currents around the stack upsetting the circulation
effect. Your chiller will look like Mr. science and not like a Snuffy Smith
still. Just a thought and not intended to be an established truth (how about
that for a sign off line!)


On another subject, someone recently asked about a source for thermistors. I
purchased several from radio shack for less than two bucks apiece (blah). I
constructed a temperature probe as follows: 1) 1 inch long thin walled brass
tube (3/16 dia) and crimp one end, 2) Solder leads to the thermistor, 3)
fill the tube with epoxy and insert thermistor w/leads (intent is secure
thermistor in the tube and insulate the exposed wires), 4) slide the wire
leads through a length of flexible tubing and slide the tubing over the open
end of the brass tube, 5) clamp the flexible tube around the brass tube with
chromium iron wire (safety wire for those in the aviation business). You now
have a temperature probe that you can use in your mash or boiling pot. I use
a digital multimeter that, within the resistance range of the the
thermistor, reads to the nearest 1/10 ohm. These thermistors have
calibration data on the back of the packaging. I generated a calibration
curve with this data and use that to monitor temperature. I actually use two
curves, one for the range of mash temperatures and one for the
boiling/chilling temperature range. I satisfied myself as to the accuracy by
checking the readings in an ice bath and boiling water. I also always do a
sanity check by comparing to my standard thermometer. Works great and cheap
too if you neglect the cost of the multimeter. Of course we use them for
other things too, right?


What does fusel alcohol taste like? Got's me worrying now, what with my
rocky racoon's fermenting away happily in my unused basement sump pit at a
very steady 68 deg F.

Filtering out the break material is difficult at best.  Your best bet
is to siphon away from it and not worry too much if some gets into the
fermenter.  The same holds true if you're using hop pellets.  A copper
pad is good if you're using whole hops or hop plugs.  The pad doesn't
get clogged at all in my experience.

Subject: Vasectomy and Homebrew


Catching up on old digests, and ran across the post by Ray Ownby on
brewing and vasectomy.  I recently did the "Big V", did not brew beer, but
instead taught my wife how to draw a draft form my kegging setup in the 
basement.  Funny how she forgot how to do this for me after I recovered!
<g>  The doctor gave me a prescription for Tylenol #3's, but I found that a
homebrew every 1-2 hours did a much better job!

I am doing it!! and a few others do too.
But my guess is you are talking about an arab country. Well then, if you do
not intend to malt your own grain and grow your own hops, you will have to
bring them over from europe or the US. However, if you could visit Israel
from time to time, you could do your shopping for brewing supplies here.

Subject: Extraction efficiency


     Dear Digest,
     I have just completed my first attempt at all grain brewing. I am 
     curious about how to find my extraction efficiency. I have seen 
     several posts on this in the past but as I wasn't brewing all grain 
     they were passed over. I hate to ask the same questions over and over 
     but can someone provide me with a usable formula and hopefully a brief 
     description of how it all goes together? I would really appreciate it. 
     
     By the way, the beer seems to have turned out just fine!
     
     Thanks for the toleration!
     
     Cheers,

Subject: MarbleTtun


I haven't built my Brewhaus yet, but I've been going over a lot of plans in my
head. Regarding a false bottom fo the mash tun, does anyone see a problem with
using a couple of inches of marbles to support a layer of window screen (and
maybe a one-deep layer of marbles on top of that to keep it in place).


In my head, this is cheap, easy, and a breeze to wash up after. I've no desire
to walk into a disaster though if an experienced masher can point out some
obvious flaws. Thanks

<I am noticing a definite pattern: My beers often taste very good after

<in decline.
Sorry Steve I can't offer any suggestions since I experience the exact 
opposite. In Papazian's CJOHB he always says the beer should be ready to 
drink in 3-4 weeks, but I have found no matter what the style of beer 
I've made, the beer does not even begin to come into its own until after 
2-3 MONTHS! and remains very good at least up to 8 months (never any left 
after 8 months). The only suggestion I do have is my beers regardless of 
style benefit (taste wise that is) from a lagering period in the fridge 
for 2-3 weeks after they have been bottled and sitting in my basement for 
2-3 months.


On another subject, I tried the suggestion in the current issue of ZMRGY 
of using a 10 cc syringe as a beer engine. I must say this did more for 
my homebrew than I thought it would. I poured 12 ozs. (flat) into a 
buldge pint, withdrew 10 cc and than with moderate pressure shot the 10 
cc back into the glass. The beer "rained" in my glass ala Guiness and 
emerged with a thick creamy head that stayed there until the last drop. 
An already fine ale seemed to be rounded out better and even possibly 
perfected. I tried it on two ales, one an English Old Ale (O.G. 1.075) & 
an American Pale Ale (O.G. 1.047). The engine did more for the higher 
gravity beer? but did help both beers! Comments please.

What you see there is a working draft of the recipe collection.
Recipes are available via the web as soon as we fold 'em in, but

When Cats Meow 3 is ready, it will be available through usual

Subject: Moravian 2-Row barley malt - sources?


I want to brew more authentic German lagers and have decided to start by 
switching to Moravian 2-row vice domestic 2-row.  The problem I have run 
into is that most HB supply stores advertise their malts as German or 
Belgian, Pils or 2-row, but not specifically as Moravian.  (And 
amazingly, the proprietors don't know the difference).  Are these 
malts Moravian, and specifically, are the Pilsner 2-rows produced by DWC 
and Gambrinus Moravian?  Also, if any of you know of a good supplier of 
Moravian I'd like to know.

Subject:  Tap Tower


Hi all,


I have been lurking long enough.  I have a question for the collective.  I
have recently gotten into kegging and will never bottle again.  Since the
soft drink companies are going to plastic containers, one can get great
deals on corny kegs.


My question is that I have recently set up a 24" wide, 24" deep, and 36"
high refrigerator that will hold 3 corny kegs and a 5 lb C02 cylinder.  I
currently have a single tap tower with a single tap on top.  The tower is
the garden variety chrome plated brass kind.  I would obviously like to go
to a triple tap tower, but am interested in something a bit out of the
ordinary (e.g. antique).  I have absolutely no idea where to begin my
quest.  I would be most grateful for any information in this area.  Private
E-mail (ja33m`at`nih.gov) would be ideal.

Subject: New siphon tool


     Brewers,
     
     This is an update to a post I made earlier this year where I 
     proposed making a dyke to hold back hops and break material while 
     siphoning cooled wort from the boiler.  Due to house painting and 
     other chores, I've just now been able to FINALLY brew a batch and 
     here is the result.
     
     My original plan was to take a soup can and cut out the bottom and 
     top, slit the side, bend tabs to fit the radius of the kettle, and 
     drill a bunch of 1/16" holes.  Due to the aforementioned chores, I 
     was unable find the time to make the original design.  So with brew 
     day fast approaching, I decided to leave the can whole, cutting out 
     the top and bottom and drilling it with holes.  As it turns out, I 
     think a much better design.
     
     I used a 16 oz size can (baked beans) with a laser welded seam 
     approximately 4 3/8 inches high and a 3 inch diameter.  While 
     brewing a batch of house ale, I used a center punch and a narrow 
     piece of wood to lay out eight rows of holes approximately 1/4 inch 
     apart vertically and horizontally.  I ended up with 28 holes per row 
     by 8 rows for a total of 224 holes.  The first three rows were 
     drilled with 1/16 bit, the next two rows with a 5/64 bit and the 
     last three rows with a 3/32 bit.  The reasoning for the different 
     size holes was, besides the fact I was having a good time ;-), that 
     the smaller break and hop particles would be at the bottom and need 
     more filtration, but I didn't want to restrict the flow into the 
     cylinder too early.  In fact I was having such a good time making 
     this I had my first major boil over right after adding the bittering 
     hops (DOH!!!).  I wonder if the homebrews may have had anything to 
     do with the disaster? Naaaaa.  Anyway, I used a rat tail file to 
     smooth the inside of the can and clean out the holes and tossed the 
     can in my bucket of sanitizer (B-brite) along with a copper scrubby 
     to be used as the filter at the base. 
     
     I chilled the wort with my immersion chiller and whirlpooled with a 
     2 x 4 block under one side of the pot to get the hops and break 
     material to pile up at one end of the pot.  I began to siphon using 
     just the racking cane until I started getting into the cloudy wort.  
     I then took out the can and scrubby, rinsed it, and put the scrubby 
     into the bottom of the can and placed it on the high side of the 
     kettle.  I removed the wood block and placed the racking cane into 
     the can and continued to siphon.  It worked unbelievably well! I had 
     to slow down the siphon only when the level of wort went below the 
     level of hops/break material.  I was able to tip the pot up and 
     collect all of the wort without having break or hops clogging up my 
     racking cane.  The hop/break bed was so compacted, I was able to tip 
     the kettle up on its side and pour the last little bid of wort out

I'm planning on driving through the Oregon and California coasts over the

In the past I've been pleasantly surprised with both the quantity and

overlooked some of the newer, perhaps smaller and more out of the way, 
places in these sojourns.  Are there any listings of Oregon and/or

Sorry to contradict you, but while I agree that fizzy water is a place
to start practicing, it certainly does not mimic beer.  There are a
lot of components in beer which will make it foam quite differently
from fizzy water and the final test, IMHO, *must* done on beer.  I

solve the foaming problem.

We've talked this out a bit in private e-mail.  Maybe someone else who's 
done 100% wheat batches can back me up on this, but I did _not_ get full
conversion with 100% wheat malt.  Not sure how much starch was left, but
there was enough to blacken my iodine.  I did not do any protein or acid
rest, and didn't crush the stuff very thoroughly, all of which Jim mentioned
might contribute to incomplete conversion.


Despite that, I can't recommend 100% wheat highly enough.  Yum!

It might have slowed them down a bit, but probably wouldn't knock them out.

But, if they begin to worry about the profits, they'll be much quicker to

consumers have money to spend on quality beer, someone will have quality

Subject: re: scum skimming


I think I have to disagree with Jim Dipalma regarding scum skimming:


I always skim the scum off my mead, but never beer.  If these high-MW proteins
have been denatured (cooked) and form scum, they most likely will end up in
your hot/cold break and will not contribute significantly to protein haze in
your beer.  I have made some suprisingly clear beers without skimming the
scum; irish moss does help, however.

Flanders Brown has a very complex taste, you will be able to sour it 
following the above method, but it might not give you everything
you need.  Aeoubrau or Yeastlabs might have some cultures that might
be closer to the mark.

Subject: Hop Plug Utilization? 


Greetings!


I've been brewing mainly with whole hops in the past and just recently
started using hop plugs (compressed whole leaf hops).  The reason for 
the switch was to use traditional (British and German) hop varieties
in a fresh form.  The compressed hops are supposed to oxidise slower,
because being compressed there is less of the hop mass is exposed to 
air.  Similiar to pellets, but still have whole leaves in the kettle.
Now the question, has anyone gotten lower alpha acid utilization from
this type of hop?  How about aroma?  I was un-impressed in both of these 
departments.  One thought that made sense had to do with the amount of
time it took for the plug to break down into individual leaves or cones,
during that time not all the hops are in contact with the beer.  Anyone
have any experiences with plugs for boiling/taste/aroma additions.
Comments welcome.

YES YES YES...I had the same problem. I grew it up in a starter the second
time and got it to kick in about 20 hours (slowly at first) but it just
didn't work as well as I liked. I figured I was just spoiled because the
yeast I usually use is so vigorous. I'm glad someone else has this problem
too.


I pitched at about 72 degrees (F) andI grew my second starter for 2 days. I
think it's just  slow yeast and I'll probably give it more time to grow up
next time before I pitch it (probably about 4 days or until I get some major
signs of activity)

Subject: All-Wheat Mash Schedule


        In a prior issue of HBD, I responded to a post by Bill 
Bunning regarding all-wheat beers by posting my grain bill for 
a nearly all-wheat hefeweizen that I made.  In HBD #1817 
(August 29), Steve Alexander responded and asked me to post 
the mash schedule for that beer.  Here it is:


                        GANZ HEFEWEIZEN
7.25#        German wheat malt
 2.5#        Canadian wheat malt
 .75#        German caramel malt (10L)
   1#        Wheat flakes
4 qts.        Rice hulls




SINGLE DECOCTION MASH
        MASH-IN:  Grain added to 13 quarts of water at 100 F 
and held for 5 mins.;
        PROTEIN REST:  Mash raised to 128 F in 17 mins.; rest 
for 25 mins. at 128 F;
        DECOCTION:  Thick, 5 quart decoction pulled; raised to 
160 F in 12 mins.; starch conversion rest for 25 mins.; 
brought to boil in 6 mins. and boiled for 30 mins.; returned 
to main mash;
        STARCH CONVERSION:  Mash brought to 148 F and held for 
10 mins.; raised to 160 F and held for 25 mins.;
        MASH-OUT:  Mash raised to 170 F and held for 10 mins.


        Steve Alexander pointed out that the extraction 
efficiency was only about 70%.  While the extraction 
efficiency was low (actually about 75%), it needs to be put 
into perspective.  I don't want anyone to be put off of 
all-wheat grists by my misleadingly low extraction efficiency. 
        At the time I made this beer I was only getting an 
extraction efficiency of about 85% even with a "normal" barley 
malt mash.  Therefore, the 75% efficiency I experienced with 
this all-wheat grist was only about 11% less than what I 
normally obtained.  
        I have since corrected my extraction problem, which 
was caused by draining the wort from the lauter tun too 
quickly.  For an excellent discussion of this dynamic, which 
helped me to cure my problem, see the article by John J. 
Palmer and Paul Prozinski, "Fluid Dynamics--A Simple Key to 
the Mastery of Efficient Lautering," in the July/August 1995 
edition of Brewing Techniques magazine (vol. 3 no. 4).
        I have not had the opportunity to use an all-wheat 
grist since correcting my lautering problem.  However, I still 
believe that an all-wheat mash is going to have a slightly 
lower extraction efficiency (approximately 11% in my case) 
than a mash contaning significant amounts of barley.  IMHO, 
the difference in the beer well-justifies the use of a little 
more grain.

Please note that 10# of pureed berries is about 1.5Ga of slurp!  Use the biggest
fermenter you can find.  You lose about 1.5-2 Ga of liquid (remember you added
1.5 already) racking the beer off the slurry.  This beer had a harsh character
after a month, but is very nice now after about 3 mos.  The berry aroma is
strong, but the flavor is delicate and only a little pink color comes through.

   I would suggest using a boiler drain rather than a sillcock.  The
difference being the sillcock has a soil trap and the drain is straight thru.
 Some stores carry these made out of cellulose, CPVC, vinyl as well as brass.
 Also, if you can't find brass nuts, go to the electrical dept. at the
hardware store and get galvanized conduit nuts.  I have been using galvanized
parts inside my tun and boiler for a couple of years now and am still alive,
the only trouble is some of the really cheap ones will rust after awhile.

   The quick and dirty answer is:  They are no longer manufactured, for a
couple of years.

While it is normal for lagers to peak and fall off, my experience is
that ales, especially medium to high gravity ones, will evolve and
improve.  They often get drier and more carbonated as the slowly
fermenting sugars do ferment.  They will lose some hop bitterness and
aroma but gain in mellowness and what wine drinkers call "bottle
complexity."


It sounds to me like Steven especially may have some problems with
oxidation - either hot side aeration (HSA) and or handling oxidation at
racking/bottling.  Attention to these may improve the situation.  I have
enjoyed ales that were years old.
