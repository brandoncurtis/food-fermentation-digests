It is funny that you should mention this (TSP) as I have posted this 
idea twice before!!! (Don't ask me which issues though).


Your amount is WAY TOO MUCH THOUGH!!!!


They sell TSP at the local wine shop, here in Berkeley. The 
instuctions are either 1 tsp or 1 tbs. per gallon on warm water (I 
honestly don't remember and I don't have any tsp at home to look at. 
I'll check the bottle when I get a new batch and let you know.


While the labels don't just float off, you can generally pull them 
off by hand after 30 minutes of soaking. I have not tried soaking 
over night though.


How much are you paying for TSP at the paint store? It might be 
interesting to see if it is cheaper from the paint store than from 
the wine shop BEFORE I spend the money.


Talk to you soon,

Don't get the different types of extracts used confused. If you're using a
pre-hopped extract (i.e. a beerkit) you should boil as short as possible
(10 -15 min.) only to sterilize the wort, because the hop flavours will
deteriorize upon boiling. Here in holland a lot of these kits require only
to boil the water, cool it and then dissolve the (liquid) extract after
which the yeast can be added (no mention of areation whatsoever btw.). If
you use extracts and add hops separately you must boil longer to get the
right hop utilization, but limiting the boiling time to 60 min. is indeed
better, because of excess darkening of the wort. I've found it very
difficult to get a light colored beer (as you would get from malted grains)
from (dry) extracts. Light DME is already darker than pilsmalt so you need
to keep the OG down for a light colored beer and long boiling times add
even more to the color. Constant stirring (watch out for HSA) and tempering
the burner as much as possible during the boil should reduce darkening.
Otherwise if you treat dry extracts as all-grain during the boil (i.e do a
full boil) the results can be suprisingly good.

In my experience, the source of fermentables can have a dramatic 
impact on starter viability. Early this year I bought a bag of 
DME for starters and had a dreadful time getting them to go 
(*extremely* slow fermentation). Over a series of attempts I 
tried supplemental yeast nutrient, increasingly higher levels 
of aeration, and several different yeast types (all the slants 
I tried are still viable today). Result: little/no improvement. 
(A procedural note: my starter OG is always about 1.030).


Out of desperation I made up a starter from a little all-grain 
batch (but otherwise used the same starter prep procedure). 
Result: Massive Improvement. We're talking night and day here. 
Of course, I'll be happy to provide full details to all who 
ask.


I don't want to give the impression that I know why (I don't 
yet). Now here's the question:


For the sake of discussion, let's assume that my DME contains 
significant amounts of glucose and/or other "simple" sugars 
(this is pure speculation). Could my problem be a manifestation 
of the Crabtree effect?

Curt,


I made an Apricot Weizen with ~ 5 lbs. fresh apricots (frozen before 
steeping in
hot water and adding to secondary).  I used Wyeast 3068 Weihenstephan.


I also tasted a Raspberry Weizen, from a friend, also made with Wyeast 3068 
Weihenstephan.


My opinions, for what they are worth:


1) The Wyeast 3068 does a good job if you want a plain (non-fruit), 
authentic-tasting Weizen.  (Takes the longest to ferment of any yeast I've 
used--about 14 days in a closed primary fermenter, with 1 package/5 gal., no 


starter.)


2) Although I can recommend this yeast for a non-fruit beer, I don't think 
its 
flavor makes a good combination with fruit.  The fruit beers I've made and 
tasted are better when the fruit/malt/hops flavor and aroma are not 
competing 
with the dominating flavor and aroma of this type of yeast.  Good commercial 


offerings tend to agree with this theory--i.e., Pyramid Apricot Ale does not 


taste like it uses an authentic weizen yeast, and neither does Wynkoop 
Backyard 
Ale (peachy wheat).


3) I definitely recommend using the secondary for your addition of fruit 
flavor.
Frozen raspberries (I've used Bel-Air brand from Safeway), steeped in hot 
(160F)
water for 30 min. before addition to secondary, work great.  I used 4 - 5 
lbs. 
in a very successful Raspberry ESB recipe.  You could use less, especially 
for a
lighter, less flavorful beer.  I was less impressed with the use of fresh 
apricots--part of the pulp tends to float, and I had more problems during 
siphoning/bottling, resulting in less yield, and some apricot flowing out 
first 
from some bottles.  If I make an apricot or peach wheat beer again, I will 
use a
neutral yeast like Wyeast 1056, and might use all-natural extract flavoring, 
or 
just pour the steeping water into secondary, leaving the fruit pulp out.

Subject: Dark malt in lauter-tun


Hey All,


I mash on the stovetop and lauter in a zapap.  I've noticed that I tend to 
get oxidation with dark malts, a problem that I believe has two sources:  
transfer of hot mash to lauter-tun and manual recirculation.  Regardless of 
how careful I am not to induce HSA, the problem persists with varying degrees 
of intensity, but usually just enough to be irritating.  My proposed remedy 
is to add any dark-roasted malts to the lauter-tun AFTER the manual 
recirculation phase.  My questions are:  Will this work?  Is there any reason 
NOT to do this?  Could crystal malt be handled the same way?  Your opinions are 
welcome---I'll summarize any privately received info.  I have to get my 
stouts and porters back on-line with the early arrival of brisk fall weather 
here in Michigan!


BTW, many thanks to all of you for the advice on improving my American Pale 
recipe---I'm happily reaping the dividends!  I've found that a small 
proportion of Munich malt contributes a pleasant, soft, and creamy malt 
texture.  Having little experience with Munich malt, I'm wondering:  is this 
the standard Munich effect?

Subject:  Stuck Fermantation or High Finishing Gravity?


I brewed 10 gallons of all-grain using 19lbs English 2 row and 3 lbs of
English crystal.  Everything went perfectly, and I hit my target of an
OG of 60 a little high at 62.  I split the batch into two 5 gallon
carboys and pitched one with 10 grams(2 packages) of Doric dry yeast and
the other with 12 grams (2 packages) of Munton and Fison dry yeast.  The
yeast was properly hydrated and both fermentations went as expected
except that I thought they stopped bubbling perhaps a day too soon.  I
took a gravity reading on the 6th day after 3 days of absolute zero
activity and got readings of SG 26 in each carboy.  I thought this a
little high and added some yeast energizer.  1 day later nothing.  I
repitched with 11.5 grams (1 package) Edme dry yeast each. 2 days later-
nothing.  I tried rousing the yeast too - nothing.
My own conclusion is that I should have used a more attenuative yeast
(liquid?) to hit my desired final gravity of 14-15.  Is liquid yeast the
only answer or is there a better dry type to use with OGs over 50?  Any
comments would be appreciated; even flames for using dry yeast in the
first place.  TIA-  Jack

Subject: Yeast sludge / sediment in bottles




Hi All,


Bill Cole asked in HBD #1827 about saving the sludge from a previous
batch.


I'm a firm believer in using the yeast sludge from my last
batch, it gives me a huge starter and saves the $3.75 I pay for Wyeast
packs.  Here's my procedure;  Before I rack the beer off of the yeast
and start to bottle, I boil a mason jar in about 2 inches of water
(lid on the pot) for about 15 minutes then let it cool while I bottle.
I rack the beer into the bottling bucket leaving a little beer on top
of the yeast. I clean and flame the neck of my carboy, this is the
secondary fermenter, swirl the liquid around to get the yeast into
suspension and pour off the liquid into the sterilized jar.  Put the
sterilized lid on and put it in the fridge.  Once the yeast
settles out you can decant off the beer and replace it with cooled
boiled water to clean the yeast, I don't always do this part.  I've
collected the sludge from the primary fermenter also, but someone
(sorry, don't remember who) said that the yeast from the secondary are
more desirable because they are less flocculant?!  Anyway, either
method works.  I used the yeast sludge I had stored in the fridge two
months ago to make a 1/2 gal starter and this batch was underway in
less than two hours!


Alex Wetmore in HBD #1828 is concerned about the sediment in his
bottles.


The sediment is probably not the sugar, I don't bring the sugar to a
boil either and have had no problems, what you are seeing is the yeast
settling out.  I'm not sure when you should actually be seeing the
yeast sediment begin to form (I don't check the bottles that
regularly), but I wouldn't worry about your beer.  It sounds as if
your procedures are correct and your beer is going to be just fine.

As long as the sugar was liquefied prior to adding it to the batch, it
should not have settled out. Papazian (and others) recommend bringing to a
boil to assure that any contaminants (wild yeast, bacteria, etc) present in
the unboiled water wil be killed. By "mix" if you mean shake the bottles,
there will be no damage but the beer will simply have to settle again. If
you mean open the bottles, dont do it because you'll risk infection and/or
overcarbonating if you add more sugar.

For my birthday my wife gave me a 33 quart brew pot, a wort chiller, and
other materials needed to make the step to all-grain brewing (yes, I'm a
lucky man).  For my first batch I'd like to do a partial mash attempt at a
Guinness clone.  I have the basic recipe but know that I can't really
duplicate Guinness without adding sour beer.  Can I sour a can of
store-bought Guinness?  If so, how and when do I add the sour beer?
TIA.

Subject: ? yield has gone down :( 


Hi all,


My turn to ask a question (and start another thread).  Of course, thanks
to the whole for the insightful and entertaining reading material (I am
actually a contributor <g>).


Since I've gone all-grain, my yield has gone down.  I've done three
batches (w/two pots) and I've been getting 3-3.5 gallons of finished
product where I should be getting closer to 5.  <heavy sigh>


To correct the problem, I have just recently purchased an 8 gallon pot.
This should cut down on evaporation loses due to two pots.  This will
also, theoretically, allow me to start my boil with 7 gallons, losing
1.5 to evaporation and .5 to hot/cold break.  I realize I'll lose a
little more in the fermenter, but that would be ok. 


Does this make sense?  I don't think I've been sparging enough.  If I
sparge to 7 gallons with which to start the boil (60 minute boil), will
I be ok?  Am I better off sparging less and adding some water?  


(fyi, the next batch will be a doppelbock, starting with 17# of grain.)


Thanx,
joe.

I'm happy with my arrangement, done with inexpensive off-the-shelf brass
hardware.  The fitting that goes through the keg is a 3/8" compression to
1/2" female pipe thread adapter.  A 1/2" brass ball valve is spaced away from 
the outside of the keg with a 3-4" brass nipple.  The gasket (inside) is 
copper, which I made by cutting off the end of a copper pipe cap, then drilling
the appropriate sized hole.

Subject: ss airstones


A quick question for the collective...


Over the past few months I made the switch to full volume boils and chilling 
with a counterflow chiller. For aerating I was concerned that an aeration 
wand (drilled tubing) would clog with cold break from the chiller. Instead I 
have opted for using an aquarium pump to aerate my cooled wort. The two 
problems I have experienced with this method is 1) sanitizing the small 
aquarium airlines/tubing is a PITA (but I will tough it out) and 2) the 
airstones I have like to float to the surface. I am assuming that the weight 
of a stainless steel airstone will sink it to the bottom of my carboy. Am I 
right of am I wrong? I have looked around the local pet stores and cannot 
find SS airstones. Where do I obtain these ellusive goodies?


TIA

It's 90% ale yeast, 10% Brettanomyces Bruxellensis, so it's said.


Actually, there is talk on the Lambic Digest of a boycott of Wyeast, 
primarily because of this yeast.  First, they package and sell it labelled 
as B. Brux.  An interpid homebrewer plates the stuff and does some 
microbiology stuff to it and declares it to be almost purely S. Cerv'.  
He does this to a couple different batches, and posts his results.  
He and his net access provider get a threatening letters from Wyeast's 
lawyers.  Finally, they post saying that it was 90/10, and that this 
information was available for the asking.  


I said there, and will say here, that a boycott is a bit of a PITA for me.
But, now, well, READ ON.

I've heard it from numerous sources.  Last night, I was pitching a starter
(for use next weekend, FWIW), and I read the Wyeast Packet.


Wyeast recommends pitching a starter at high kreuzen.  


So, should I boycott Wyeast, boycott the HBD, or just start drinking Leiny's 
Ice and forget about brewing?


(As far LI goes, btw, I pretty much lost any 'faith' I had in them when they 
release their honey weisse.  Not a terrible beer, but the ad campaigns 
encouraging people to call it "Weece" didn't sit to well with me.  I still

Someone else was asking for my wheat recipe the other day.  I found it
last night, but forgot to bring it in.  But, what the heck, here it is
from memory.


10.5 lbs. Malted Wheat, poorly crushed.  (Helps with sparging?)
Mash start temp 151, ending temp 146 or 148, I forget.  
Mashed for ~110 minutes.
Sparged about 6.5 to 7 gallons of delicious wheat-only extract.
2 oz.  Hersbrucker (4.0% AA)
Boil 60 minutes.  
Pitch Wyeast's Weihenstephan Wheat strain, I think 3068 or 3608 or 3086,
a one gallon starter, two days after high kreuzen.  (Coincidence?  I think so.)

OG is not very closely tied to a beer's body.  Did this recipe involve any 
specialty malts or partial mash at all?  If not, specialty malts can
probably help.

Here's some information I got from Jeff Lebesch, the man behind New
Belgium Brewing.  It's from a handout he had at a talk he gave to the
local brew club a few years back:


"Most references recommend a minimum pitching rate of 10 million yeast
cells per milli-liter of wort, plus another 1 million cells/ml for every
0.004 gravity increase above 1.040.  ...The 10...15 million cells/ml
rate is easily achieved by adding 5 ml of thick yeast slurry per liter
of wort.  For ales, sometimes you can go as low as 3 ml/l, and for low
temperature lager fermentations 10 ml/l is suggested.


"During a healthy fermentation, the yeast cell count increases to a peak
of approximately 60 million cells/ml.  Then it seems to me, that given
the 10M cells/ml minimum pitching rate, the maximum wort volume increase
should be six-fold....  However, many references suggest that a 10-fold
increase is acceptable.


"...If 600 ml of starter culture is pitched into 18 l of wort (about 5
gallons), that is a 30-fold wort volume increase.  In most situations,
this is drastic underpitching.  The only way it will work is if the
yeast is at its peak activity and viability...  plus wort conditions are
optimal.


"OK, let's culture another generation, by adding the 600ml culture to 3
liters of wort, and adding that to the 18 liters.  Now each generation
has had a wort volume increase of less than 6....  But, adding 15% of a
cheap culture wort to your prized wort will ruin it.  One solution is
that the culture wort must be of the same composition as the beer....
This is common in breweries where the same beer is brewed every day....
The other solution is to let the 3 liter culture ferment to completion,
then refrigerate...  then pour off the top beer, and collect the yeast
slurry."


This doesn't address the question of when to step up or pitch your
starter (in fact, the last sentence says "ferment to completion"; that's
probably not what you would do normally when stepping up your starters).
However, it's clear that a 1L *yeast cake* would probably be over-
pitching by a bit.  The maximum liquid wort increase of 10-fold would
indicate a 1.8L starter for 18L (5.2 gal).

I would say that, yes, this is a problem.  Personally, I make most of my
beer in an EasyMasher(tm), so there is no transfer of mash at all.  Recently,
I did make a few non-EM batches in which I "glorped."  "Glorping" is a term
I picked up from someone (sorry) at the Chicago Beer Society and is the
transfer of mash from mash tun to laeuter tun by using either a saucepan
(or even better, a dedicated "glorper") one scoop at a time.  By doing this,
you can gently lay the mash down in the laeuter tun and minimize aeration.

>the top of the bin onto an inverted saucer--more splashing.  I can't reach

Again, I believe that this is a problem.  I use a small measureing cup for
catching the early runnings and therefore I can again gently lay down the
runnings back into the top of the laeuter tun without aeration or disturbing
the grain bed too much.  I must admit that there is a disadvantage to the
small measureing cup in that I have to stop the runnoff between cups of
runnings.  I have to think more about solving this problem since starting
and stopping the runnings has a tendancy to un-seat the grain bed a little
each time.

The scum is actually the infamous Hot Break.  It is literally cooked protein
and, according to DeClerck, *must* be removed.  Yes, it will settle out with
the cold break.  No, removing it does not reduce head retention because it is
made from the large (haze-forming) proteins and not the small (head-retaining)
proteins.  The fact that removing it does reduce the chances of boilover is
an added benefit.  Personally, I skim.

Subject: Stuck Belgian Ferment?


I brewed a Belgian Triple last week, OG 1.092, all grain, and
pitched probably about 20 oz of slurry that I recovered from
the end of a Belgian Single ferment, 1.049.  I went away for
a week and didn't even know if it was going to ferment but
when I returned I was glad to see the airlock slowly bubbling
and the marks on the carboy indicate that the krausen had risen
and fallen.  I checked the gravity and it was only 1.060!  I
know I didn't aerate very well, believe me I wanted to but don't
have the equipment yet.  Will soon though.  I was wondering what
I should do.  I think I will grow up some more yeast and repitch.
Any thoughts other than just wait and see?  I am using the Westmalle
yeast cultured from the bottle and have been told others have had
stuck ferments with it when doing high gravity brews such as this.  I
have used it before on a batch of double aroudn 1.065 and it worked
fine except for some sluggishness after racking.  


Also had a question about Belgian specialty grains.  How come most
of the roasted grains, chocolate, black, unmalted, have higher
Lovibond ratings than English and American grains.  I asked this
once before but didn't get any response.


Thanks,
