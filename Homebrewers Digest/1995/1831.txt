Subject:      All-grain starter wort?


Todd Mansfield has found that his starters do best when he uses all-
grain wort, presumably doing back-to-back batches or saving aliquots
of his wort for future use in starters.


Interesting.  How would you do this if you were starting from scratch?  A
mini-mash of 0.5 lb malted barley with a pint of water at 150 deg. for one
hour, sparged to get a total of 16-24 oz. wort?  Has anyone ever tried this
sort of thing?  It wouldnt be much more bother than breaking open a bag
of DME, measuring and spilling extract powder all over the kitchen!

I make my own labels by hand.  I write in a fine calligraphic

my own homemade papyrus (I grow the stuff down by the river).  I
stick the labels on the bottles using the gum of the jub-jub tree.
They never come off - ever.  If I want to re-use the bottles, I
have to make the same kind of beer again.

Subject: Propane Cookers


Several people have recommended Camp Chef and Superb 35K BTU cookers.


Does the Camp Chef require modification to work efficiently?  It appears
that the burner will be quite far from the keg when its placed on the
heating grate.  The model I looked at has four legs, a squarish grate,
and a cylindrical shield around the burner.  I found this unit priced 
at $65.00.


The only Superb model I have found is 13"X13" and 6.5" in height with
no legs, possibly a table top version, model # 16-20E.  The burner is
basically in a metal box.  This model was about $120.00.  I not sure
this is the model people have been recommending.


I would prefer something that didn't require modification.  Can somebody
straighten me out?  Model numbers would be helpful.


Thanks, Brian Barnett

I know that we've been through this before, but I'm interested to hear
responses

coffee or chocoate, what kind of recipe, what results etc.  I'll certainly take
private responses, and report back.  In fact, I may compile results if I get
enough and upload it somewhere.  I noticed some recipes in the Cat's Meow,
but not all of them had comments about the results.

Subject: Use of gelatin


[lurk mode off]
I've scanned the files at stanford, and a few other brewing resources, and 
can't find what I'm looking for.  What is the best way to use gelatin or 
other finings to reduce the suspended yeast in kegged beer?  The only 
information I have is from TNCJOHB, which says to add one tablespoon to to 
one pint of cold water and heat till desolved (but do not boil).  Does this 
method work?  If not, what does the collective recommend?


E-mail is fine, I'll summarize in a couple of days.

Subject: Temperature Control Unit Questions


Last weekend I installed a Johnson Controls Temperature Control Unit (model
no. A19ABC-24C) in my beer fridge. It seems to be working, but the actual
temperature seems to be around 5 degrees higher than the dial temperature on
the controller.  I mounted the unit on the inside wall of the fridge with
some velcro because I really didn't want to drill any holes.  The sensor
bulb is attached to about 8 feet of copper wire that is coiled up in the
shape of a mini immersion chiller.  I stretched out about 2 feet of the wire
and then ran the sensor and wire over the cooling elements and let it hang
in the center of the fridge.  The sensor itself is not touching the cooling
elements, but the copper wire is touching.


So... here are my questions:


1.) Is the fact that the unit is mounted inside the fridge affecting it's
accuracy?


2.) What should I do with the excess copper wire attached to the sensor?
Should I uncoil it or leave it alone?


3.)  Is the unit getting a false reading because the copper wire is touching
the cooling element?


4.) What is the proper placement of the sensor?




Any comments are appreciated.

In #1829 Robert wrote:


>They sell TSP at the local wine shop, here in Berkeley. 


I have purchased TSP in a local giant supermarket.  I was planing to use it
for general glass bottle and carboy cleaning.  Upon reading the product
label I read that the product was not to be used on glass.  WHAT!!!!!


So I turned the lights on brighter, put on reading glasses and tried again -
Do not use on glass!   Wait a minute, what is this???  The package had a
telephone number to call for further instructions or information.  I called
and the lady replied that yes the manufacturer strongly suggested that the
product not be used on glass.  


So I said why.  She said it's VERY hard to rinse off.


Any further information from fellow digest members on this?


The label read pure TSP so I do not think the product had any other
additives.  This just dosen't make sense - hard to rinse off.  Why would a
cleaner be hard to rinse off? On the other hand, the manufacturer surely has
no desire to limit sales so he may have very strong reasons to put the
warning on the label.

How to homebrew Sake
After the very hot summer, suitable season for Sake brewing
is approaching.Following is the one of the simple Sake brewing
procedures to enjoy Sake taste.
Materials:1500g(3.3lb) rice,400g(0.9lb)koji,5g(0.18oz)citric acid
               Water.Dry yeast(I used bread yeast.I heard wine is better.
               Sake yeast is not available at present.)5g(0.18oz)
               Koji is available at a grocery store in Japanese during 
               the winter time.
               Koji is sold as a cooking material to make "amasake",
               very sweet pasty liquid which has no alcohol and not 
               as a homebrew material.              
Equipment: electric rice cooker(steam cooker is better),
               10liters(2.6gal) enamel deep cooking pot with lid.
               big spoon(stainless is better)
1.Wash 1500g(3.3lb) rice and then put the rice in a basket for
    at least one hour.
2.Cook the rice with 1800ml(0.48gal)water using rice cooker.
3.After cooking the rice,cool down the rice to 20deg C(68deg F).
4. Melt the citric acid with 2.4liter water in the enamel cooking pot.
    Temperature to be lower than 20deg C(68deg F).
    Citric acid will prevent contamination of bacteria and add slight
    sour taste to Sake.
5.Add 400g koji  and well melt it by agitating with the big spoon. 
6.In thirty minuets,add the cooled rice and well mix by agitating
   with the big spoon.
7.Pitch the dry yeast and place the lid on the pot and keep it under
   20deg C(68deg F).
8.Stir it at least once a day.In two or three days you can enjoy
   Sake smell.Be careful about bacteria contamination.
   I used 70% ethyl alcohol spay around the pot and to myself.
9.In two weeks fermentation will stop.
10.Filter the sludge using a sterilized basket or cheese cloth.
11.Enjoy  the filtered Sake.Do not drink too much.
     Alcohol content is two to three times more than beer.
     Cooling the filtered Sake is the best way to taste.
12.Remaining sludge can be used to cook vegetable pickles in a
     refrigerator.Cucumber is the most suitable vegetable.


If real "Amasake"  is available (sake sludge mixed with suger is not
real amasake),directly pitch  dry yeast in a bottle.You can brew Sake.




In Japan,at present,fermenting more than 1% alcohol without
license is illegal.
Before world war one,I heard that every family had been enjoying
home sake brewing. It was the Japanese culture.
But the war destroyed the culture too.
At present,members of " Homebrew News Letter"  is only less
than 300.It is supposed that about ten thousand homebrewers exist
in Japan.We do not always brew beers but sometimes Sake.
Just two years ago the minimum amount of beer production
was reduced from 2000kl/year to 60kl/year by the pressure from
the USA. It was the beginning of small local beer brewers.
We,most of general Japanese people, are wanting more pressure
from the USA for free homebrew and for free trade.
Commercial Sake brewers use very expensive materials such as
50% polished specially selected kind of rice,which looks 
very small crystal beads because of the excessive polishing process.
We never eat such a rice, we usually eat normally slightly 
polished normal rice grown only for eating.
When I visited Sake brewer near my house,the manager told
me that he tried to eat that sake rice but that it was not tasty.
Homebrew Sake is very simple to make and satisfactorily  tasty
if you do not compare with commercial  real Sake.
I heard that US Sake brewer produce only real Sake because of
US tax law.Real Sake means Sake only from rice.In Japan,
tax law allows mixture of so called industrial ethyl alcohol to 
Sake within a certain percentage.Real sake (Junmaishu) is very
expensive.
I hope you enjoy homebrew Sake.

Think about using 2 small cups so you can alternate. This way you won't have
to stop the run-off any more.


Just a small hint from this long-time lurker (finally I can contribute
something to this high-quality digest. Keep up the good work, guys!).

Subject: What's Under Tomorrow's Lid ?


First, thanks for the thoughtful and interesting replies to my boiling 
questions from, Jim Busch, Algis Korzonas, Steven Lichtenberg, and Philip 
Gravel.


It seems that,


High pressure/temp (150C) boils must be brief to avoid excessive melanoiden or 
caramelization reactions. Alfa Laval doesn't boil at this temp, they just hold 
it for 2 monutes. They boil at 80C.


I understand the difference between batch and continous processes. However with 
the tiny ammounts that homebrewers brew, we can approximate an increment of the 
continous process if there is an advantage. I can go to 140C "instantly" as I 
have a 3000kW steam boiler! However it is more convenient to go from 100C to 
140c in 10 minutes with a 35kW gas burner and then flash cool to 80C by 
releasing the pressure and hooking up a 15litre/ min diaphram pump and lowering 
the pressure to 1 ATM..


It also seems hot break is pressure dependent, the higher the better. I'll find 
out why, I've emailed Alfa Laval..


Complete sterilization is possible at elevated temps.


If the desirable isomerization of hop bittering compounds and the protein break 
are accelerated in the short time at 140C, and a prolonged 80C boil does the 
DMS removal well (SMM coverts to DMS at >70C), the high temp/low temp 
combination may result in significant melanoid and caramel reduction. I have 
set up a test and when my gas fitters are finished I will "boil" three 
different ways and have the resulting wort analysed by our university.
If I post a positive conclusion in about 2 months, it will be relatively easy 
for a homebrewer to emulate the technique in part. The average beer keg can be 
used as a pressure vessel to 3 ATM, and a diaphram pump can be picked up 
cheaply.


The reason for my heavy metal approach to brewing techniques is my increasing 
allergy to some staling compounds in beer and wine. I can become violently ill 
on 1 litre of badly brewed or old beer. It was Sulphur headaches that drove me 
to building heat exchangers.
I am becoming an anti-oxidation and clean brew freak, I am researching every 
aspect of oxidation or off flavour production I can find.
 I am compiling a "Fresh Beer Guide" on every point of possible oxidation, if 
other members would like to contribute their wisdom it would be appreciated.

I forgot to mention in my arrangement that the copper pipe cap that 
serves as a metal gasket is left whole in the case of the mash tun.
The strainer arrangement consists of the appropriate sized copper pipe
slipped into the pipe cap on the inside and secured with a brass screw.
The pipe runs the length of the bottom of the keg, with a 90 deg elbow
on the end facing down for support.  The pipe is drilled with MANY 1/16"
holes.  After much experimentation, I found that this arrangement worked 
much better for sparging than others, such as hacksaw cuts in copper tubing.

Subject:       Saving $$$ on yeast


I understand the need to save $$$ when brewing but I think an easy 
way for getting the most bang for the buck has been overlooked.


I smack a fresh pack of Wyeast and prepare about 1 gallon of 1.030 
wort that has been highly aerated and supplemented with a good dose 
of yeast nutrient.  When the yeast pack has swollen properly I pitch 
the yeast.  Ferment lock in place, I let 'er go for about 10 days.  I 
carefully rouse the slurry back into solution and siphon the fluid 
into 11 12oz bottles.  I cap them, label them, and place them in the 
fridge.


When I get ready to brew a new batch, I pull one of my yeast bottles 
from the fridge, transfer the contents to a 22 oz bomber, top it off 
with fresh wort, and put on a ferment lock.  The next day I brew and 
then pitch the 22oz of high krausen yeast.


This method gives me 11 batches from a single pack of yeast.  That 
does not count any repitches of the slurry on the bottom of the 
carboy!


YMMV

that may be of interest.


Hanging beside my grandmother's fireplace (and now hanging beside 
my brother's fireplace) was/is a copper cone, about 12 inches 
tall, about 6 inches in diameter at the top, with a handle on the 
side (mug-style).  My gram called this (apparently rare) antique 
a 'beer warmer'.  An ale would be poured into the implement along 
with spices, and jammed into the coals of the fire to warm.  This 
was the more genteel method than the standard practice of 
plunging a hot fire-poker into your mug.


As I recall - and is written in Websters - 'wassail' is a hot, 
spiced ale traditionally drunk around Christmas.

Subject: ageing


Hello,
        Some tiem ago I posted regarding problems with ageing...  My beer is
best for a window of time, say between 2-6 weeks old.  I suspect, after
mulling over many responses, that the primary concern is oxidation.  This
could occur during handling of the hot wort (HSA), or at bottling.  Either
way, the end result is relatively unstable beer that may taste good at first
but then rapidly declines.  One 'supposed' signiture of oxidation is that
the hops aroma/ flavor is lost first, then sherry-like flavors begin to pop
up.  Note that I store beer in my basement, with temperatures ranging from
65 to 75 F.
        Now, this past weekend I was lurking in a friends basment refridge
and found 3 older bottles of beer that I made.  My supplies of these
particular batches have long since been metabolized.  So, I was extremly
interested to see how these bottles 'aged'.  Well, they taste pretty good,
sort of as they tasted when they were 'in the window'!  Obviously the
oxidation/ ageing reactions are slowed down thu spreserving the desired beer
characteristics.  One additional note, the beer was all crystal clear!  I
have admired this in others beer at our local homebrew club meetings.  The
response, 'my beer always comes out this way' by the knowledgeable (read
arrogant) all-grain brewer was crap.  He ages in the 'fridge.  
        I must admit that I have more recently altered my brew schedule and
gone to a partial mash, thus improving the overall quality a great deal (in
my opinion).  However, this tasting was an eye opener for me.
        The moral is, age at cool temperature if it is possible.  Otherwise,
don't save any!  This is a bummer, for me, since I enjoy haveing 2-3 styles
on-hand which means I brew 3 weekends in a row, take 2-3 weeks off, then
brew agin.  However, storeing 4-5 cases is no good at my basement temperature.  
        Someday, when I get a real job, I'll buy a beer 'fridge!
best of luck,

Subject:       WYeast 1338 / Hot break


In a recent issue of the HBD someone commented that they had used WYeast
1338 (European Ale) in a batch and had noticed it to be quite slow.  They
commented that the slap pack was slow to swell, the starter was slow to
start, and that once pitched in the batch of beer, had a fairly long lag
time.  A few others then responded to the HBD stating that they had
similar experiences and concluded that it was normal for this yeast.


I would like to add a data point to this by explaining my very different
experience with this yeast.  In a recent batch of Holiday Cheer
(Papazian) that is currently fermenting in my fridge, I used this yeast. 
The slap-pack swelled inside of 24 hours and the starter was at high
kreusen in 24 hours.  Furthermore, I split the starter in half since I had 
made a 10 gallon batch in 2 carboys.  The starter was pitched at about 
10:30 pm and was already at high kreusen (spewing out of the air locks and 
running down the carboys!) the next morning less than 12 hours later.  The 
only time I have seen a quicker and more vigorous fermentation is when I 
repitched the yeast sediment from a previous batch.


Besides relating another data point for this yeast, I am telling you this 
because it possibly relates to a comment made by Rolland Everitt in HBD 
#1830.


        > "The work of Wildiers...showed in 1901 that some yeasts would not

 *** > He goes on to identify the "bios factors" - they are vitamins.  


I found this interesting because, when making my starter, I noticed a 
bottle of multi-vitamins sitting on the kitchen counter and thought, "what 
the heck...it couldn't hurt" and crushed one and added it to the boiling 
wort.  Also, in preparation for pitching into 10 gallons I added about 3/4 
cup of corn sugar to the starter (in addition to 3/4 cup of DME) to give 
the yeasties a little boost.  I wonder if the addition of these vitamins 
could partially explain why this yeast responded so well, contrary to 
others' experiences.  Any comments?

I have not noticed this reference to 30 mins in any books, but perhaps I
have just over looked it.  In my experiences, the hot break always forms
at the beginning of the boil, within the first 5 or 10 minutes. As soon as
my wort begins to boil it tries to boil-over because of the surface
tension caused by the un-flocculated proteins holding the bubbles
together better. So I adjust the boil by backing the heat off in an
attempt to continue boiling without boiling-over (doesn't always work =)).
Within about five minutes the foam settles down because the hot break has
occurred, thus removing a lot of proteins from solution and lessening the
surface tension.  I can then crank the heat back up to a rolling boil
without worrying about a boil-over.  Am I incorrect in believing that this
is when the hot break is occuring?  Am I missing something? 


- -------------
One last thing:  should I conclude from the silence to my request for info 
on how to duplicate Red Seal Ale that nobody knows much about it?  I know 
how to make a Pale Ale, but this wonderful beer seems to have a unique 
hop flavor that I would like to know more about.  Besides what kind of 
hops, I would also like to know if it is acheived by dry hopping, hop 
backing, or just as finishing hops.  TIA.

Lots of good stuff.


I visited 2 micros and one brewpub:


ALI'I Brewing Company (micro)
500 Alakawa Street, #200
Hololulu, HI  96817
808-841-4883


Located on cannery row near the Dole pineapple canning factory - an 
*absolute must see*, this small micro is brewing some really good beer.  
Real "beer people", as opposed to the 
"build-it-to-go-public-and-make-money" type.  Far and away my favorite of 
the 3 establishments visited.  Samples served in _mugs_:-) ("Hey, You've 
got to have enough for a good taste").  Don't expect a fancy brewery - do 
expect quality brew.


Ali-i beers are hard to find - limited production and distribution.  BUT 
they told me that will improve.


Beers tasted:
Amber Ale (*REALLY REALLY REALLY* good)
Pineapple Pale Ale (ok; a little too pineapply for my taste)
Mango Wheat (I like mangos, this was *GREAT*! Just a hint of mango). Porter 
(also very good)
Barley Wine ("private stock", "ties up the equipment too long to be cost 
effective", good stuff! :-)


Others they make that were not being brewed during my visit: Macadamia Nut 
Brown Ale
Kona Coffee Stout 


Kona Brewing Company (micro, seemed to be "marketing driven" as opposed to 
"beer" driven, samples served in little cups :-(
75-5629 Kuakini Highway
Kailua-Kona, HI  96740


Beers tasted:
Golden Ale (ok)
Fire Rock Pale Ale (hoppy, pretty good, but kind of mono-flavored)


Others they make:
none at this time


Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (brew pub, they will give out decent-sized 
samples)
Aloha Tower Marketplace
101 Ala Moana Blvd
# 1123

Beers tasted:
Export (lighter color, pretty good)
Marzen (pretty good)
Dunkel (pretty good)


Others they make:
Hefeweizen, and probably some more occasionally


Misc:
the Maui Brewing Company (whale ale and another ale): beer made on the 
mainland; not in HI.  I tried the whale ale anyway-std mega brewery stuff.  
Cool label, tho.  All three establishments visited  had been in business 2 
yrs or less.

        Okay, I may have brewed my first bad batch (it's only my 4th 
batch). The beer is real cloudy which suggests bacterial infection, 
but there was no deposit ring on the bottle. The beer does not taste like 
it's supposed to (it's a weizen). The beer could be better but it does not 
taste bad. 
        My question is "can I still drink it?" The beer is definitely 
drinkable (although not the best tasting batch I've brewed). Will the 
bacteria make me ill or is the beer not really infected? I would
hate to have to pour out 5 gallons of beer. 
- --- End Quote


Yes...  A weizen may (should) be cloudy.  If the beer tastes ok then drink 
up.  If the beer tastes bad pitch it.  I am currently "pitching" a bad 
batch because I can not stand the flavor.  I did have one other "bad" batch 
 - which tasted fine (it showed the "ring" and had unidentifiable floating 
chunkies (techinical term :-) ).


The advice I got from my HomeBrew store was - "If you can drink it do so, 
if not pour it out".  They then added, "If it is infected drink it fast - 
it will only get worse".


For the record, this batch became infected from a siphon problem (got 
clogged every 5 minutes and had to be restarted).  I gave up on the batch 
and continued on through the process just to see what would happen.  The 
first bad batch was a bottle infection (some of the bottles had a problem 
some were fine - still don't know why, they were all cleaned the same way.)

Carl Etnier, "A Yankee in Sweden (now on assignment in Switzerland,

England centuries ago.  I remember a scene early in the movie "Lion in
Winter."  The plotters against Henry VIII met in a tavern, and one of
them pulled a hot poker out of the fire, plunged it into his mug of ale,
and left it there until it was steaming.  I thought at the time that
this would probably also introduce soot and flaked iron into the ale.
English ale back then was typically much stronger in OG than now
(>1.080), probably cloudy with yeast and suspended starch and protein
from poor mashing and sparging techniques, sweeter (higher FG), and
unhopped.  Probably a much different drink warm or cool than anything we
have now.

Tim Fields complains of carbonation problems even when he used a lot of 
priming sugar.  


A few weeks ago, I reported that my English Bitter (using Wyeast 1968) 
was flat and that a yeast layer seemed glued to the bottom of the 
bottles. As a test, I took some of the unopened bottles and swirled them 
until I loosened the yeast layer from the bottoms.  I left both swirled 
and unswirled in my cellar for a week.  Then I refrigerated some of 
each.  The swirled ones were carbonated and the unswirled ones weren't.


You might try shaking some of the bottles to see if getting the yeast 
back in suspension will help.

Oddly enough, the shop guy was right!  It appears that the truest weizen
flavor is generated by that yeast (assuming everything else -- grist, etc.
- -- is correct), when the fermentation is held around 68F.  Below that, it
doesn't generate the right compounds, although I'll have to say that in my
experience it didn't generate much banana, either.  The yeast tends to
produce clove and vanilla.  A friend did his first fermentation in a fridge,
that held the ferment at 65F and the beer was way too mild.  At an ambient
temperature of 68F (which presumes the actual temperature of fermentation is
maybe 5F higher), the flavor was spot on.

Hi All,

  I've had pretty good success fermenting with this yeast at 60F-62F. This
strain does seem to produce a lot more banana than clove, a little too much
so IMHO. Keeping fermentation temps in the low 60s helps to keep ester
production down somewhat, while still producing a reasonable clove character.
  The last batch of dunkelweizen I brewed was a 22 gallon brewlength, split
with fellow HBDer Lee Menegoni. We split it into 4 carboys, pitched 3068 and
Andechs weiss yeast. Lee fermented his in the high 60s, I fermented mine in
the low 60s, and his 3068-pitched beer had considerably more banana ester
than mine. In this case, 5-7 degrees made a noticeable difference.

   Not to my knowledge. Both chocolate and black patent are malted (as
opposed to roasted barley, which is not), then kilned at different
temperatures, typically 80F-100F apart.


>If you have a
>"chocolate" malt from one maltster than weighs in at 500L, is that a better

  Over the years, I've seen chocolate malt with ratings that ranged from
300L to 500L, this is clearly an *enormous* difference. Consequently, I have
gotten distinctly different color and roasted malt flavor contributions from
chocolate malt from different maltsters. This makes it a little tricky getting
batch-to-batch consistency in beers that use a high percentage of chocolate
malt, such as porters and stouts.

  What I've read of this is that hot break formation is not a distinct point,
but occurs throughout the boil. Much break material forms early in the boil,
rather less as the boil proceeds and there is less soluble protein in the wort
to coagulate and precipitate. Comments??

What is the general impression of Wild Goose brewery out there?  Has
anyone tasted these beers?  Have you noticed the distinct smokey-buttery
characteristic that all Wild Goose products seem to have?  I've tried
Wild Goose IPA, Wild Goose Wheat, and several others (I forget which
ones) but they all had this characteristic. What causes it?  I can't even
decide if I like it or not, but it is very distinct.  Is there anyway to
recreate this via homebrew?  (That is, if I decide I like it ;))


On a related note, I saw someone mention Red Seal Ale in a recent HBD.
In my opinion this is one of the best beer's in America, and one of the
best breweries in America.  IF you get a chance try their other products
(North Coast Brewery, Mendocino, CA) like Old No. 38 Stoudt, and
Scrimshaw Pilsener, and thank me later.
