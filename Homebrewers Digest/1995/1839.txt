Subject: False bottom


Never one to be satisfied, I'm now trying to come up with a fuss-free false
bottom for my mash-tun. I'm currently using Jack's EasyMasher(tm) and it
works fine, but I really have my heart set on a true false bottom. I don't
really like the idea of a hinged piece of SS, so I'm wondering whether a
3/16 to 3/8-inch piece of copper or polyethylene cutting board couldn't be
used, and fastening the two pieces in the middle with a "rabbet joint". (I'm
using a keg as my mash-tun and the top hole is too small for a full-sized
bottom). A rabbet joint looks like this:

        ...................................       ......................


I figure instead of drilling a bunch of holes, I could take a router to the
underside and cut a series of U-shaped slots parallel to one another, and
then flip the thing over and cut a bunch of U or V-shaped slots
perpendicular to the underside. If I set the depth of cut correctly, the
intersection would form the perforation. Anyone tried anything like this?
What about materials--will plastics work or should I use copper? Stainless
is out of the question since I don't have the tools to route it. And what
about optimum slot shape--any data?
Thanks in advance.

Subject: Are all extracts created =


Perhaps someone can help me with this one:


For those intimate with extract brewing, are all light syrup extracts
created equal or is there evidence some are "better" than others?


For example, Alexander's (domestic from CA) vs. Laaglander vs. Breiss
vs. Australian vs. British, etc... I have heard British light tends
darker than domestic, but other than that, are there any "quality"
issues with the above or is it (as I expect) simply subjective and
a matter of taste?


Aside from trying to brew the best beer possible with extract, here's
where I'm coming from on this. The recipe I'm following in my attempt
to clone that elusive Full Sale Amber (1st attempt not even in same
universe, but still a great pale ale) calls for Australian light.
My local brew shop only had this in DME so I used it. It made a great
beer but I am not convinced it's worth the higher price. In light syrup,
he only has Laaglander. In a response (direct email) to one of my 
earlier postings, someone (forget who) recommended against Laaglander.
Not sure why. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, I'm inclined to
use Alexander's from another shop (less convenient than 1st one).
I have a friend who buys it in 5 gal cans and swears by it.
On the other hand, I've also heard/read that British and Australian
extracts are "better" because the Brits/Aussies have been at this
longer than we have.


Can someone help separate myth from reality here?


Many thanks in advance...

hi to all,


    What are the best way(s) to get a good head on my ales.
I've seen many recipes that use crystal for mouthfeel and
body,but does this help with the head.I've also heard that
carapils does the same.Can these two be mixed together.Are
there any other things that might help.I read a paragraph
in vol. 18 no. 5 "95 Zymurgy page 33 that shooting 10cc of
beer back in to the glass,using a syringe,will duplicate the
head that a good beer engine produces.WHAT IS A BEER ENGINE?
Any help is greatly appreciated.

Subject: Boinked Mini-kegs


          HBDers -


          I too have had past problems with distended mini-kegs.  I
          traced my problem to simply kegging early -- no apparent
          signs of infection in the beer.  In some of these kegs, so
          much carbonation had built up that I didn't need to use a
          single CO2 charge to empty it!


          While the beer from the boinked kegs tasted OK, I threw the
          kegs out since they are tin or steel w/ some sort of enamel
          lining.  My fear was that the boink would eventally weaken
          the lining, exposing precious homebrew to exposed metal.


          I did not experience a single boink-out this past brewing
          season.  I have attrubuted this to longer secondary
          ferments, lower priming, and "cooler" storage (never above
          70F).  As always, YMMV.


          A few weeks back, I posted a question to the HBD collective,
          but received no responses.  I am looking for someone who has
          experience or simply can postulate on adapting a mini-keg
          tap to a CO2 bottle/regulator settup.  It seems that all I
          would need to do would be to "screw" some sort of adaptor to
          the mini-keg tap where the C02 charge currently is located.
          This adaptor would then support a ball or pin disconnect
          common to soda keg settups.


          But there are no commercial products out there that do this
          currently, making me think that there is some sort of
          problem with this line of thinking (exploding taps/kegs
          from no safety valve?)


          TIA,

Subject: March Pumps Temp Info


Harlan Bauer had requested temp info on March pumps.  I just happend to
have their catalog on hand. 


Two models he refrenced are both rated at 190 F max liquid temp.  Max internal
pressure (room temp) 50 psi.  Materials in contact with liquid are:


Model


MDX-1/2 & 5/8 - Glass Filled Polypropylene, Kynar, Ryton, Buna N, ceramic
                magnet


MDXT          - Glass Filled Polypropylene, Ceramic Shaft & Thrust Washer,
                Ceramic Magnet, Buna N Seal


These are the two models with the wing nuts.  To get their catalog, I sent
a fax to 1-708-729-7062 and requested catalog F0960-R7, titled:
Seal-Less Magnetic Drive pumps.  I am glad Harlan listed a source for these
pumps, as I was unable to locate a dealer in my area.  The prices he listed
are reasonable, as quality appears good.


Can any chemist/plastics experts out there tell us of the two materials above,
which would be most compatible with brewing-related applications?  Is Ceramic
and Polypropylene safe with wort? 190 F rating should even be compatible with
a RIMS system.


The catalog says March has available a "Chemical Resistance Guide" for their
pumps, catalog number R-2910, "concentration, temperature, time, impurities,
and degree of agitation" affect materials selection - - - lists hundreds of
chemical solutions and rates their suitability for use with a wide range of
plastic and metal parts as well as O-rings and bushings".  Think I'll request
this one today.


MDX models are rated at 5.5/6.0 gpm, 7 Ft max head, 1/50 HP, 1700 rpm, 64 watts.


MDXT rated at 6.0/7.6 gpm, 19 ft max head, 1/25 hp, 3400 rpm, 108 watts.


They are also available with air motors if you are brewing in an explosive
atmosphere. :)

One thing that usually happens to my beers when I age them is the hop levels
drop off sharply after a couple months.  A good alt will have a lot of hop
character.  One in which the hops have "aged away" will not be a good alt.
There may be more, or less, going on in yours.  What exactly was bad about it?

Not sure where to mail-order, but for stuff like that I always check 
health-food stores.  Many have huge selections of bulk herbs & spices for a
fraction of what it costs in the little jars in grocery stores.  If you find
a health-food store that has bulk spices but not blades of mace, ask someone
that works there, and they might be able to help point the way.

I'm under the impressoin that EE also takes into account how much of those
sugars you get out of the mash into the brew kettle.  I'm not sure how 
temperature would affect this, either.

The practical problem with this from a homebrewing perspective is that your
extract efficiency might vary wildly from mine.  (And will probably be several
point higher, too.)  Your best bet would be to try to work backwards from 
specific gravity.

You could try to schedule bottling and brewing on the same day, and then
use the secorndary dregs by simply "pitching" your wort straight from the
chiller onto the yeast.  I have only once actually bottled dregs, the rest
of the time I just pitch by leaving yeast in the 'boy.  


Still, if you can't work out the scheduling, your beer isn't ruined.  :-)

I missed the beginning of the thread, so forgive me if I ask: who says that
it doesn't?
If your starter is contaminated, your beer will be contaminated.  There is no
magic involved.  Pitching a contaminated culture into a starter will offer an
opportunity for the bacteria to reproduce, just as they would in the wort
(the starter,
after all, *is* wort, to all intents and purposes).  The idea is to pitch a
clean
culture, not use the starter to clean up the culture.  Makes no sense.

Pitching from a previous batch helps, yes, presuming that the yeast is clean.
But aeration is *always* desirable, and will always assure a better, quicker,
more complete fermentation.  Oxygen is an essential component in a good
fermentation, and while you can somewhat overcome the disadvantage of poor
aeration by a higher pitching rate, the *optimum* fermentation is a result of
both good aeration and a high pitching rate.


And what are "yeast growth byproducts", other than the natural results of a
good fermentation?

Here's another possibility: the guys at the store were poor judges.


If it's a good competition, they are very unlikely to mix up beers; using
just numbers
is standard procedure.  It doesn't seem likely that your bottles would have been
contaminated, although you might want to put the foil on *first* before they go
in the oven; that way the foil gets heated too and the bottles are never open.


The thing is, if the bottles were clean, they were unlikely sources for
contamination;
the odds are that the contamination was either lurking in the beer or somehow
introduced at bottling, in some other fashion (unlikely, because of the
alcohol, but...)


The other possibility: the judges at the competition were lousy judges.
Although you say "phenolics were plentiful," so maybe they were right.

Chris Barnhart asked about extract efficiency/conversion/mash temps:


> Isn't extract efficiency a measure of how completely you convert the

I say "it should be" but it isn't.  Because extract efficiency is measured
with a hydrometer, the numbers we get only indirectly tell anything about
conversion. That is, the hydrometer reading doesn't say if gravity is due
to starch, simple or complex sugars or anything else.


> Within limits the temperature is irrelevant to EE.


I think this is true; mash temp is irrelevant to 'apparent extraction',
ie, the extraction computed using gravity readings.

Yes, and since temp is a *major* tool used to control wort fermentability
and palate fullness etc, it's really moot whether or not it affects the
speed of conversion.  But back to conversion vs extraction-as-measured...


Brewers who've obtained low extraction will go on to say they are puzzled
because iodine indicates complete conversion but the yield was only 25 ppg
(for example).  This is a frequent rcb comment.  My feelings are:


1) There's hardly any connection between these two phenomena, and they
   shouldn't be puzzled, and


2) The errors brewers face in measuring batch volumes (brew length) and
   specific gravity (due to temp corrections, etc) influence extraction
   numbers more than does the nature of the conversion.


My point is this: when we think we're measuring extraction of sugars due
to a mashing process, we're only truly measuring how much soluble matter
we've been able to lauter from the grain.  It's a subtle distinction, but
I believe it's a valid one.


For the empirically-minded: given two otherwise identical mashes, but 
with one done (uh, I mean "conducted") at 150F and the other at 200F,
will the og's be significantly different?  I don't know the answer, so
if anyone has 100 Kg of Maris Otter they'd like to send me I'll be happy
to "conduct the research", heh heh heh. :-)

I tried this with my steam injection system and it didn't work because
of insufficient heat transfer.  I have a ~15 ft coil of 1/4" OD copper
that I use to preheat the mash water.  When heating water the steam exits 
the coil as water, at about the same temp. as the mash water.  When used
to heat the mash, with moderate stirring,  the steam exited the coil as
steam,  and the heating was very slow.  So, to make this work use a large
amount of copper, or pressurize the coil(control the exit of steam/water).

Subject: Reasons for One Yeast Breweries


In hbd1837 Al Korzonas states the reason for a one yeast brewery operation
is "lousy sanitation". Al may may have missed the the real reason: money.
>From conversations with many brewmasters, the reason for a one yeast 
operation is cross contamination. Sanitation to prevent cross contamination
cost money. 


Yeast tend to hide in a brewery in inconvienant places. The most frustrating 
place seems to be in the filter. The filter is a very difficult piece of 
equipment to clean. Since the beer is filtered before it goes to the 
brightening tank, cross cantanimation could occure before the beer is 
conditioned. Why not clean the filter: 1. filter paper is expensive, most 
breweries try to run more than one batch through the paper. 2. The fliter 
housing itself takes a conciderable amount of time to sanitize and has many 
hard to reach places. Labor equals time. Time is money. It just plain costs 
to much to sanatize the darn thing every time it is used. 


Fermentation tanks and conditioning tanks also require sanatation and 
thorough cleaning. Most operation seem to run several batches through before 
giving the tank a real scrub down though most operations do rinse the tanks 
between each batch. Yeast is transported between fermantation tanks. Multi 
yeast breweries would require more fermentaton tanks to keep the yeast 
cultures seperate. Tanks cost money and floor space is usually more 
expensive. So, a multi-yeast brewery would require more money for cleaning 
or for more equipment/floor space.


Most breweries buy yeast from the major yeast producers in varying volumes.
Wyeast is a major supplier in this area. Most brewers do not build a starter 
from a slant but from rather large cultures. You guessed it, it takes to much 
time. Yup, time equals money.


Money is the main reason for single yeast breweries. A brewery is factory
with differnet sanitation requirements, usually driven by the balance of
absolute required sanitation and desired sanatation levels versus money. 
The main object of a brewery is to make money so the doors stay open. The 
less money paid out, the more money goes to the bank. , the doors stay open.
The need to make money is perhaps the biggest difference between 
home breweries and pro breweries. 


(This is not meant as a flame at Al, just another view point.)

I have a setup like this with a keg fridge in the basement & taptower at
the kitchen sink (yes this is true decadence, marriage councilling may have
been my missed calling...)
Some important points:
Only use RV type antifreeze which is non-toxic.
Get a chemical recirculator type pump which has a low output, otherwise
friction will actually HEAT the viscous cold coolant.
Oversize all connections to again avoid restrictions & thus friction & heat.
Use a reservoir of coolant placed in the fridge, the bigger the better to
dilute the returning warmed coolant.
Insulate the lineparticularly wellunder the sink where hot water pipes,
dishwasher drain pipes & metal sinks really heat the surrounding area.
I put the pump inside the fridge as well to help cool it, YMMV.
I tape the beer line to the concrete wall in my unfinished basement & insulate
& find its cooling effect sufficient WITHOUT the pump running for at least
1/2 the year, but this IS the great white north...(-2 C this am!)


I find it a good practice to open faucet for a second or 2 when it hasn't
been used for a few days to purge the foam/stale beer in the upper line
before putting the glass under to fill. I rationalize that this also
mimimizes chances ofdrinking potentially infected beer.
Between kegs I tap a 1/4 keg of hotwater with baking sodato clean &
and soak the line & fittings untilthe next is tapped.

Subject:       Oak Chips


I have seen several notes about oak chips in recent HBD's.  I agree 
that the chips need to be "sterilized" prior to putting them in the 
secondary.  As a matter of fact I thought I'd share my method.  YMMV


I place the chips in a shallow pan.  Cover the chips with water and 
place on high heat.  The boiling water sanitizes the chips and also 
becomes flavored by the oak.  It also reduces in volume.  When I add 
the chips to the secondary I also go ahead and pour in the oak chip 
tea water.  Does a nice job of flavoring the IPA!

I totally agree with this statement.  However, even though these
qualities are not exclusive to a RIMS, it is my contention that a RIMS
will more consistently produce these qualities than any hand stirred
mashing system.  While your system may be excellently designed for
even heating, if you do not do an *excellent* job of stirring, you
will *not* get even heating.  The quality of the evenness of the heat
is left up a very large variable, your ability to evenly stir the mash
to distribute the heat throughout it.


Due to the way a RIMS heats the mash, the same temperature
distribution throughout the mash is guaranteed every mash, whether or
not the brewer remembers to stir, because no stirring is necessary.


While I agree that *you* may be able to produce consistency rivalling
a RIMS system, it requires a great deal of care on your part.  The
possibility of you introducing differences due to getting a phone
call, or just forgetting are high (regardless of whether you actally
get distracted does not matter, the possibility is exists).  The
repeatability of a RIMS system lies solely in the system.  The brewer
*CANNOT* forget to evenly heat the mash because it is not up to the
brewer.

The solution from a bar is neither simple nor cheap.  They run the
beer lines from the cooler to the taps in a race and along with the
beer lines, they run a glycol line.  The glycol line keeps the beer
cool all the way to the tap.  It has nothing to do with how quickly
bars go through beer, however, you will certainly have more problems
because of a home use situation being so infrequent.  Mostly with your
taps gumming up if they sit for any length of time (days).

Subject: Wyeast 1728 Attenuation / AB yeast 


 I'd like to bring up a point that someone on the HBD brought up about
 Wyeast 1728 (scotch ale) yeast and see what you all think.


 He observed as have I, a high attenuation rate with this yeast.  So much
 in fact that he used it to make a barley wine.  I on the other hand used
 it to make an imperial stout.  Well we both had a great attenuation, I
 believ his was 1.090 to 1.015 and mine was 1.110 to 1.020.  We both
 bottled as usual with a resonable amount of priming sugar and guess
 what?  His Bwine was flat and my Istout is too.


 Tastes good... just flat flat flat.


 Has anyone else observed this with this yeast.  Once it poops out, its
 out!  I find it hard to believe that it can do such a good job of
 fermenting and then crap out completely.  My Istout has been in the
 bottle now for over two-three months (I don't have my notes) and it
 should be showing SOME signs of fizz.


========


 I wanted to add a point about the discussion about AB using the same yeast 
in these "new" beers.  When I attended the Microbiology course at Siebel 
last year, AB made up 50% of the class.  These professionals made noises 
that they were there to study the "care and feeding" of yeast in preparation 
for maintaining new strains for a new "attitude" at AB.  So perhaps this was 
a prelude to that announcement.  Please note that the AB folks were from all 
over the country.


I got the impression that there were under some sort of gag order.

tech had gone home. Does anyone know whether this is, in fact, the actual
rating; or have the phone number to March Pumps? Also, since this temerature
rating is for continuous use, how far above it can I go for intermittent
