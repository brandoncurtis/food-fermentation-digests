Subject: Acidic porter & stout


Hey HBer's,


Made a porter from a kit (old English porter), and a Russian Imperial Stout
from a kit, both went well in the boiling, cooling , fermentation, pitching,
and racking process.
  The first was made about 2.5 months ago (porter).  Boiled it for 45
minutes, added no extra hops.  Used Wyeast British ale yeast to pitch at 70
degrees F.  One week in primary, one week in glass secondary.  Target O.G.
was fine.  Tasted great at bottling, using 3/4 cup corn sugar to prime.
When tasted two weeks later to check carbonation (left at 70 degrees in dark
room for two weeks following bottling) had a very strong acidic (not
vinigary) taste.  After reading a few notes on how porters and stouts
improve with age, and are sometimes undrinkable at first, I put this batch
in my 20.8 cuft. freezer with temp controller at 45 degrees.
  Stout was made a little more than a  month ago, boiled 45 minutes, no
extra hops, Wyeast Irish Ale yeast at 70 degrees.  One week in primary, one
week in secondary, good target O.G., 3/4 cup corn sugar to prime, also
tasted very good at bottling time.  Two weeks later to  check carbonation,
tasted good.  Put down at 45 degrees, and one week later has same acid taste
of porter.
  The porter now is very slightly lower in the acid taste, but still acid.
Suspecting some sort of bacterial or wild yeast infection during bottling, I
took a bottle of both to our lab folks here at the med school for analysis.
Nothing grew but pure strains of the yeast used to ferment.
  Used bottled water with pH of 7.0 to make, porter was bottled in 12 oz bar
bottles, well cleaned in clorox solution, and rinsed many times by hand,
then put in dishwasher, sans soap or anything else, and cycled through with
hot drying 3 times.
  Stout bottled in 16 oz. new bottles, but were cleaned in dishwasher using
cycle with hot dry 3 times.
  Any suggestions on what the cause is, or should I relax, drink another
variety of my homebrew, and let them keep sitting in the cooler a while?
Don't know their exact final pH, didn't think about that until today, will
bring in another sample and have our lab test.

Subject: Mash Temp Distribution




Ken Schroeder (kens`at`lan.nsc.com) questioned the importance, yea,
even the attractiveness of even mash temperatures, and solicited
opinions on the matter.  Not being one to hold back an opinion on
*any* topic...


First, I want absolute repeatability in the system, to the extent
I can afford it.  For mash temperature I want to mash at 152F, not
154F or 150F, and I want to subsequently brew that "same" beer at
150F and know that for any infinitesimal mash volume dV, it saw 150F
for 99.9% of its mash 'lifetime'.  This kind of control will answer
the question about how noticeable a 2F difference in mash temp
really is.  I really want to know, and I want to use the information.


Before you burst an internal organ with laughter, yes, I agree, this
seems absurd in view of all the other variables in the process. But,
I'm more or less convinced *this* variable is one of only a few
truly critical ones.  If it doesn't take too much effort to eliminate
it, it doesn't matter if it's really critical or not--it's been
eliminated from the equation.


Second, it frustrates me when, just as I've learned how to control
the mash temp for Product A, I brew Product B and have to relearn the
system all over again due to different mash temps, grain bills,
volumes, and so on.  I simply get tired of it.


On the the issue of temperature distribution, Ken questioned how
important it really is.  My view is a little different here--even
distribution is, in one sense, not really the goal as such.  What I
want is 1) the repeatability I mentioned earlier, 2) a guarantee
of no temp overshoot, and 3) a reasonable temp ramp-up to setpoint.


A static mash heated in any conventional way simply doesn't conduct
heat very rapidly.  Any temp measurements made represent very local
temps (VERY local), and to avoid extremely long heating times the
mash at the heat source will have to be seriously overheated (that's
called a decoction) relative to the mash far from the heat source.


So, one solution is to stir the mash--fair enough.  You either can
stir continuously or stir "often enough" and accept the resulting
gradients.  This allows you to meet all 3 requirements above, *with
practice*.  Impulse heating as opposed to continuous heat input) is
almost always required, am I right?  This adds to the excitement
during the session.


Recirulating is just another way to meet [my] 3 requirements.  With
the proper level of recirculation, overshoot can easily be eliminated
(with or without microprocessor control), and you get the added
attraction of a nicely set grain bed.  The Real Benefit it that when
I read the temperature of the wort, I know I'm reading the temperature
of the the wort, the whole wort, and nothing but the wort.  The even
temperature distribution is hopefully a *consequence*, then.


NOTE:  Uniform temperatures in the mash is NOT guaranteed simply with
recirculation!  The steady state flow through the grain bed can have
myriad character; it's easy to imagine almost no flow near the wall of
the tank, with a consequent temp gradient from high flow regions to
low flow regions.  The Channeling Bogeyman.  Tun insulation and wort
distribution then are design considerations.

Subject: Re: Heat Source


In response to Herb's questions about brewing with propane in the basement, I
too, brew in my basement and I use a propane stove.  I looked around at a lot
of different stoves before purchasing one and what I found were big
differences in stove quality.  I ended up purchasing a Supreme (can be found
at the East Coast Brewing Supply,
http://virtumall.com/EastCoastBrewing/ECBMain.html) and I'm confident that I
made the right decision.  One reason is efficiency.  I've made seven batches
(all-grain) and my propane tank (which was $20 to purchase and only $7 to
fill) is only about half empty.  It also has very nice flame control.  I
don't have the all-or-none blow torch effect like the King Kooker has (which
is cheap & inefficient).  Third, I can use it indoors.  I checked with
several sources before making my purchase and basically all sources told me
that propane stoves are NOT to be used indoors.  The Supreme, however, IS
usable indoors provided good ventalation.  I brew in a medium sized room in
my basement with one window open and a fan in the room to keep air crculating
and I have never had any problems.  Brewing all-grain requires you to boil
all of the wort (usually starting with 6-7 gallons for a 5 gallon batch) and
on the electric stove in my kitchen, it would take forever to boil that much
wort.  My Supreme boils 7 gallons in about 20 minutes.  Because I live in a
wet climate (Tacoma, WA), brewing outdoors is not really an option 9 months
out of the year.


Also, I also use a modified keg for boiling, which is exceptionally nice
because not only does it have a wonderful ball valve and such, it has a
curved bottom (which keeps the flame focused instead of wrapping around the
sides) and I can keep 10 gallons of wort at a full-tilt boil and never worry
about it boiling over.
 
Hope that helps... CDR

Which makes me wonder if the extra heating on the bottom of the mash/lauter
wouldn't be rather like a decoction.  We know that the enzymes in the
decocted mash are deactivated, yet there are plenty left in the rest of the
mash.  Could this be a case of RDWHAHB?  I'm no expert but it sounds like
it to me.

Subject: Re: Hop Util/Grain Conversion/Force Carbonating




  Hi All,


  In HBD#1843, KennyEddy`at`aol.com posts some good, thoughtful questions.


>(1) Hop Utilization:  Everybody seems to have different formulae for hop
>utilization.


  All of these formulae are designed to just get you in the ballpark. There
are far too many factors (kettle geometry, water chemistry, yeast strain,
the list goes on and on) that vary from brewery to brewery for any single
formula to accurately take into account.
  If I may make a suggestion, use Rager's formula and utilization factors
from the Zymurgy special issue on hops, they will get you close. Keep careful
notes on your hop additions, ie, how much of what type of hop at what AA
rating, and when it was added to the boil. When the beer is fully matured,
taste it, and make notes on whether the hop bitterness/flavor is too much/too
little/just right. This is how you can compensate for those factors I mentioned
above that are peculiar to your brewery and brewing procedures. After a
couple of passes and some tweaking, you should have it nailed.
  Personally, I use Rager's formula with slighlty lower utilization factors,
ie, 25% for a 60 minute boil. I arrived at this by comparing my brews to
commercial brews with known IBU ratings. Once I was getting comparable levels
of bitterness and thus a known IBU level, I did some algebraic extrapolation
on Rager's formula, and solved for the only remaining unknown term, the
utilization factor. I use this derived figure when designing new recipes, it's
worked well for me, I haven't brewed an underhopped or overhopped beer in
years. YMMV.


>(2) Grain Conversion:
>Fine.  But:  how much of that OG is actually fermentable?
> A program like SUDS lists a variety of grains and their OG potential, but
>assumes that the resulting OG is fully fermentable (and also assumes that 75%
>is converted to alcohol [75% apparent attenuation]).  What is needed is a
>chart that shows not only potential extract but also *percent
>fermentablilty*. 


  Percent fermentablility is determined to a large extent by your mashing
schedule. Mash at the higher end of the sacc. rest range, say 158F, and you'll
get more dextrins, and a less fermentable wort. Mash at the lower end, say
150F, and you'll get more simple sugars, and a more fermentable wort. Mash
schedule is another factor that is too highly variable for a piece of 
software or a malt spec sheet to take into account.


  If you're starting to get the idea that there are a lot of variables in
brewing that make it as much an art form as it is a science, then you're
starting to get the idea. :-)


>On sorta the same topic, I would think that roasting grains would destroy
>some to all of the starch's conversion capability, yet I see malts like
>chocolate or even black patent listed with extractions not much different
>that pale malts.


  The roasting does destroy the enzymes, but some starch is still there. If
you mash these grains along with a high-enzyme malt such as pils, pale, or
lager malt, you will still get some contribution to OG from these malts.


>The stock answer I get for these questions is "well, we
>don't use a high percentage of these grains so we just ignore those effects".


  Unless I'm brewing a porter or stout, I use small percentages of dark malts,
always add them at mashout, and just ignore their OG contribution. :-)


>(3) Force Carbonation:  Now that I'm kegging, I'm enjoying the convenience of
>sediment-free beer-on-demand.


  I started kegging 3 years ago, I will *NEVER* go back to bottling.


>Now I suspect two things should be happening here.
>One, the free CO2 will reduce in pressure due to the cooling temperatures.


  True.


>Two, the cooling beer would allow more CO2 to dissolve in (or would it...?).


Yes. Solubility of CO2 is inversely proportional to temperature. The cooler
the liquid, the more CO2 will dissolve in it.


>But I should end up with a pressure at final temperature euqla to that in
>the chart for the same CO2 volume I was originally after.  Right?


  Uh, guessing here, but I think that would depend on whether the solubility
to temperature relationship is linear or not, I suspect not. If you have the 
temperature/volume tables, it's easy to check. I don't have the tables in
front of me here either. 
  FWIW, what I do is put about 40 psi on right after racking, then place the
keg in my dispensing fridge. After the first day, I adjust the regulator for
the desired level of carbonation, and add gas to the keg twice a day. After
a couple of days, very little gas tranfers as the pressure inside the keg
reaches equilibrium for the temperature (I keep my dispensing fridge at 45F). 
At that point, the beer has the desired level of carbonation.


>Next question:  So assume I have my beer wonderfully carbonated at 2.5
>volumes and 38 degrees.  Now, I don't have the tables in front of me but I

  You need to balance your dispensing pressure with the total pressure drop
in your dispensing system. I've found that I need to keep ~12 psi on the keg
in order for the large oring to form a tight seal. I use 3.5 feet of the
3/16" beverage tubing, which drops about 3 psi/ft. There's another 1 psi
drop across the hose connect, yet another 1 across the cobra tap, total of
12 psi drop. When dispensing, open the tap all the way, and pour the beer
down the side of the glass.

Subject: Hoegaarden Witbier yeast 


Hello out there,


I just had a friend come back from Belgium with a fresh 6 pack 
of Hoegaarden Witbier (oh boy!).  This is a good example of a 
Belgian Wit beer.  Pale, cloudy, light body with a sour note.  
Nice yeast flavor with mild
clove and citrus flavor.  This is a bottle conditioned beer so 
as soon as I got the beer I cultivated the yeast with good 
success.  I brew alot of Witbier so when I transferred the 
yeast to the next step I was eager to smell and taste the 
yeast. I am not convinced that this is the primary yeast.  It 
smells clean and all that, but does not have the character that 


I expect out of a Witbier yeast.  I know that many breweries 
use a dirrerent yeast to condition there beer than what they 
use for primary fermentation so people like me ca'nt steal 
there prized yeast.  Does anyone out there know if this is the 
case with Hoegaarden?  If you know will you tell me?:)  I'm 
going to plate it out to have a look and do some test's with my 


next batch, but maby someone out there could give me some of 
there observations and knowledge.  TIA

For *my* system, based upon tests run at the Seibel Institute, I must say
that Rager's formulas work for me.  Here's my current system:


10 gallon Polar SS pot
pelletized hops
hops stored cold, purchased in CO2-purged, oxygen-barrier bags
12,000 btu natural gas stovetop burner
nylon hop bags used (one for each addition)
add 10% to the numbers I get from Rager's formulas to account for the hop bags
add 10% more to the numbers I get from Rager's formulas when I use whole hops
for 5 gal all-grain batches, add the 60 min hops when there's 6.5 gal left
for extract batches, add the 60 min hops after a 10 minute boil w/o hops


This works for me.  Since it does, for *MY* system, Mosher's and Tinseth's
formulas would give me beer with slightly higher IBUs than expected (I have
not looked at Papazian's formulas in a long time, but I believe they are
based upon Rager's) and Garetz's formulas would give me beer with 50 to 60%
higher IBUs than expected.  I've heard from a few homebrewers via private
email who have tried Garetz's formulas and have found them to make beer that
has *much* more bitterness than expected.

Don't reduce the pressure for dispensing.  The key to dispensing at the
right pressure is selecting the proper length and ID beer hose.  I've
found 6 feet of 1/4" ID vinyl hose and a standard, black cobra faucet to work
well for 12psi.  If you are still getting too much foam at the faucet, make
sure the faucet is clean and that you open it all the way.  If you still have
foam city, then try 7 feet of hose or 8 feet...

    Kenneth K Goodrow writes about a chiller design.  One note: do yourself 
 a favor and instead of using hose clamps, use a copper tube union for the 
 plastic hose to copper connection.  The size will be 3/8" to whatever the 
 OD of your 3/8" ID plastic hose is (5/8"? Can't recall...).

Herbs and spices were a standard additive to English Medieval
ales and meads through the 15th century. Use your imagination if
you would like to try to reproduce some of these drinks. Try
herbs and flowers, both fresh and dried, to make your brew
interesting, different and delicious.


A word of caution. Because a flower or herb smells wonderful
doesn't mean it is harmless if ingested. If you do not know the
make and model of a plant, take it to the county agent for
identification. Like with wild mushroom, do not guess!


Once identified, check the plant for possible toxic effects. An
excellent source is The Herb Book, by John Lust. It is available
at most book stores and is $6.99 (list) in paperback. This
text tells you the history, effects, toxicity, and instructions
on amounts to use to make a tea of the herb. A good investment!

>FROM: Rich Byrnes

Rich asked about articles on Beer and Cigar pairings. The issue before 
last of "Beer..the Magazine" had a article. The summer issue of "Cigar 
Aficionado" had an article as well. My impression was that the beer 
writer didn't know cigars and the cigar writer didn't know beer.


The traditional beverages to pair with cigars are port and scotch. 
That implies that Scaldis and dopplebocks would be the best beers. 
LaChouffe would also be good. Coffee is also good with cigars, so try 
sweet stouts and robust porters. Look for lingering sweetness and 
avoid beers with a lot of hop presence.


Pairings are tough. Are you supposed to light up a one hour smoke, sip 
a beer for 5 minutes, then put it out so you can light another? What a 
waste! Pick one cigar and alter the beers.


Personally, my cigar of choice is Cuba Aliados in Valentino or Corona 
de Luxe sizes. It is a medium bodied Honduran with lots of Cuban 
character. It was the highest scoring non-Cuban in the latest CA and 
is reasonably priced, especially by mail order. (~$2)

Now that I think about it, a RIMS is actually drawing off a little bit of
the mash liquor at a time, heating it, and mixing it back in the mash.
Sounds more like decoction mashing than infusion mashing to me.  Maybe a
more correct term would be Incremental Decoction Mashing System (IDMS).
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
And thanks to all of those who responded to my questions about amylase and
RIMS.  To quickly summarize: 


Amylase is a catalyst that is not consumed, but will degrade with time.
And it is also in solution, not in suspension. So I would be risking
exploding bottles if I were to try to lager it out of suspension and then
bottle the beer. Suggestions were to (1) wait it out , which could take a
month, or (2) heat the beer up to 170F for a few minutes and then quickly
chill.  This will denature the enzymes, but also the yeasts.  Yeast would
have to be repitched prior to bottling.  I am opting to wait it out,
since heat will effect the quality of the beer.


And for RIMS, it seems all but the Rodney-Morris-Purists (if there is
such a person, I heard from none) beleive that a RIMS *requires* a
heating element and computer chip.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
And finally, I have found a couple of quotes from some famous and well
respected people regarding prohibition.  I am including them so that we
may all be better armed to respond to those who wish to legislate their
moral views against alcohol on the rest of us:


"Prohibition...goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to
control a man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things
that are not crimes. A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very
principles upon which our government was founded." -- Abraham Lincoln,
December, 1840


"The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by
the Prohibition law. For nothing is more destructive of respect for the
government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be
enforced. It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in
this country is closely connected with this.  -- Albert Einstein, My
First Impression of the U.S.A, 1921 


[WARNING: These same quotes apply to the Prohibiton laws against other
drugs. Don't use these quotes if you beleive in the War On Drugs, as they

Well, I cannot disagree with your statements about the fact that your
"unevenness" creates the opportunity for pockets of slightly different
chemical reactions to exist.  And yes, these pockets will create
slightly different characteristics in wort produced.  These kind of
mixed compositions of the resulting sugars definitely do produce
character and a multitude of subtle flavor differences in the finished
product.


However, after long discussions with many people on mashing
temperatures and the effects on the wort produced, I don't think that
unevenness has anything to do with it.  A perfectly even
(theoretically) mash, chosen to mash at certain temperatures for
certain times can produce a varied wort.  Enzymes which produce short
sugar chains like low temps and long chain producers favor higher
temps.  Chose the time you stay in their range and you will choose the
proportions of the different characteristics you will get in the
resulting wort.  Leaving the differences to an uneven mash may be
interesting and produce excellent beer, but can you produce the same
one the next time?


I am not saying that evenness is necessary, but if you want
consistently repeatable results, it sure is helpful.  I contend that a
completely controlled mash with even heating could produce the same
kind of character you produce, given that the brewer had sufficient
information and artistry to control the heat in the correct manner.  I
also contend that while manually stirred systems may produce lots of
character, they stand a smaller chance of producing the same character
time and time again.  Of course, a RIMS system is susceptible to the
same problems, namely the nut behind the wheel, but I believe that it
makes it easier to achieve consistency from batch to batch because
the *possibliity* of introducing differences is greatly reduced.


I have nothing against manual methods and will agree that almost any
method can produce outstanding results.  I personally prefer more
automation.  If you don't that is your preference.  With regards to
the end product, any method is as good as any other.

Subject: Drinking age, brief note.




I know this thread is probably innappropriate, but some folks seem to be 
overlooking one of the main issues.  The main safety increase in raising 
the drinking age to 21 isn't in preventing 19 year-olds from drunk-driving,
but to prevent 16 and 17 year-olds.  Lower the drinking age, and high school
kids have more access, because they have more legal friends.  They are the
ones who are and were causing the most drunken driving havoc.  I do agree
that if the problem is with drunk driving, the regulation should be about
driving, not drinking.

I believe that a while back (maybe 9 years ago) the Federal government
forced all states to adopt a minimum 21 year drinking age by threatening
to withold highway money.  Some states, I know Louisiana, reluctantly
passed the law raising the age to 21 (and I think adding numerous 
grandfather clauses).  
Currently, the House is considering repealing the federal law, which
will allow states to set thier own restrictions lower if they feel like it.


As for what a reasonable drinking age should be, I find it hard to say.
I agree with all posts so far and for a variety of other reasons that raising
the drinking age is doing no one any good (except maybe some republicans)
and it should certainly be lower.  And drinking and driving laws should
be even stricter, especially if that is the only reason to have a high
drinking age.

I have the same setup in my garage here in Salt Lake City.


I've been thinking about getting a plain olde house water heater, and hooking
it up.  The burner should be able to heat the water inside within 30 min or so
right?   The capacity would be like 30 gal before cutting the top off, right? 
So the uncovered capacity could be like 20 gal.   Then it has a spigot, also. 
 And it is insulated!!! 


I see that a national hardware store (Ernst) has some hot water heaters on
sale for about $70.  I think I would buy new myself.  So thats really
inexpensive for a boiler!   Put in a thermometer, and a screen for sparging
the grain, and we've got ourselves a party!(Jerry Jeff Walker)


But the thermostat prob only goes up to 150 or so?  The same plumber that
comes to install a new junction from the existing gas pipe to the heater would
be able to replace the thermostat with a higher temp one, don'tcha think?


But I haven't been able to convince myself that this would work.


Now even though Paul states that he is a extract/partial mash brewer, and this
might be overkill for him; I say "look to the future Paul, you might want to
do all-grain mashes, and this setup seems pretty inexpensive."   


I would be very interested in any other replies you get to your post, Paul.

Subject: Terminology: Infusion Mash 


Al Z said:


> Infusion mashing is the heating of the mash with additions of boiling
> water...period, end paragraph


I completely disagree with Al on this and feel the common use and meaning
of the word infusion shouldn't be narrowed artificially or confused with
any particular technique used to conduct one--even if it has been in the
past.  This may be common brewing parlance based on how infusion mashes
were temperature controlled, but the definition of infusion is to steep
in hot water.  No more, no less. This is the definition I've seen used
in science, chemistry and I believe cooking. It says nothing at all about
how the hot water is obtained or maintained.  


Perhaps the easiest way to conduct an infusion mash commercially is to
underlet hot liquor into (rather than to direct fire) the tun, but this
should have no bearing on the definition of "infusion mash".


When instructions call for "steeping of grains", such as in many 
extract-based brews, those instructions could as well say "prepare an
infusion".  Infusions are distinguished by the fact that they extract
without boiling (a decoction).  Mashes are infusions, but all infusions
may not be mashes (mashing being distinguished by enzymatic action).
Infusion is strictly the leeching of solubles from something using hot
(but not boiling) water.  In the mashing process you happen to get very
significant side effects due to activation of enzymes.


If mashes are infusions, then what about decoction mashes?  Well, any
portion of the mash that hasn't been removed and boiled is an infusion.
Any portion that's been pulled and decocted is not.  So you certainly
start out with an infusion, but by the time you've finished 2 or 3
decoctions it's unreasonable to say you've achieved your result without
boiling.  To my mind it's truly a hybrid, but the predominant technique
for getting solubles out of the grain is what should define the mash.
You either get the solubles out by steeping (infusion) or by boiling
(decoction).


There, now I believe we have thread you can sink your teeth into.  I hope
I've at least stirred up a some controversy here--the HBD has become a
bit calm lately!

that no one has considered.  Here in Texas, it's illegal to be in pocession
or to drink under the age of 21.  So, by extension, homebrewing would be
illegal as well.  It has nothing to do with purchasing the beverage, just
having it.  But, as an added twist, a parent reserves the right to serve
his/her children an alcoholic beverage.  So, if you want to share a sip
