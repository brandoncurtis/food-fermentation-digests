I have enjoyed reading these notes since I have subscribed to the Digest and
tonight I feel that it is time to jump in with both feet. It is not my

Pierre, I take it you have not yet had an accident on your private property
because of your drinking. I will make the assumption you haven't run anyone
over yet or crashed into a tree because it looked like two trees and you
thought you would drive in between them. 


"But it is only me",  you say, "and the law should stay out."


 Well, the law will stay out if no one ever knows about it, but are you not
going to seek medical attention?? I have been to too many alcohol related
traffic accidents to believe that there can be any kind of responsible
drinking and driving. If you're going to drink, no matter what your age,
PLEASE don't drive.

 Good Morning Lady and Gents,


 just alittle correction before anything else is said about the drinking 
age is slandered.  Ffirst unless the law has changed in the last two 
months, Louisiana drinking age is still eighteen, that I am sure of.  Next 
of all I believe the drinking age should be twenty one with one exception, 
the military.  Not that military peolple should be regerded as better then 
anyone else but if your old enough to die in combat for your country you 
should be old enough to drink a beer legally! And this is in know means a 
bias opinion just because I am a U. S. Marine. I think alot of people will 
agree!


 Let me know your thoughts 


 Thanks

Subject: the old stalled fermentation


The old problem:


A number of beers I've brewed in the last while start off quickly (6 hours
from pitching), foam up well and then stop short at 1.025, 1.022, etc. and never
really move from these S.G.s (or take 2 weeks to do it).


I brew extracts with dry or liquid yeast, boil everything, cool the wort,
let sit, rack off the trub, shake the bejesus out of the carboy (for 5 min)
and then pitch.  The thing is - this problem is new to me
and might coincide with me doing full boils.  I'm tired of having to 
worry about it - how do I prevent these incomplete ferments?  Aerate more?
Could there be a problem with leaving too much trub behind?  I allready 
pitch from a 750ml starter - go to a 1.5l starter?  Go back to open ferments
(I use a carboy for the primary now)?


I have to get over this problem before I put all the effort into full grain.
TIA :)

Subject: Dry Spicing


I'm going to make a Holiday ale for the upcoming season, and was 
considering trying "dry-spicing" in the secondary to get more spice 
character.  Has anyone done this successfully?  Are there contamination 
problems to be considered?  Also, I'd be interested in hearing about 
spice amounts/mixtures that worked particularly well.


Thanks,

From: "Douglas Rasor" <drasor`at`HOFFMAN-ISSAA2.ARMY.MIL>
Subject: Drinking & Driving




     I just had to put my two cents worth in on this particular subject.  
     Gary wrote that we should all obey the speed limits, that no one 
     should smoke because it has killed millions, etc, etc.  On obeying the 
     posted speed limit:  1.  I normally, on the interstates, drive at 
     least 10 miles over the posted speed limit.  Why, because it is 
     decidely safer.  A vast majority of people on the rode drive at least 
     10 mile over the limit and those of you who do not follow this rule 
     and drive in the left or center lane at or below the limit are 
     creating a traffic hazard by not going with the flow of traffic.  In 
     case you did not know, if an accident occurs because you were not 
     going with the flow, you can be held liable and charged.  I do believe 
     it is not that the Federal Governement has no write imposing rules 
     regulation, etc that involve things the states are better able to deal 
     with, speed limits for one.  In the western states there are long 
     hauls between towns and a faster limit makes sense.  2. As for the 
     smoking and millions of death comment, I do not smoke, if a 
     reasonable, responsible adult wishes to suck on a cancer stick, then 
     it is his perogative.  Who am I to impose my personnal bias, however, 
     the individual should not intrude on my right to not breath in his 
     toxins.  3.  On the legal drinking age, I again believe the Federal 
     Government has no right to impose rules on the state.  I do believe 
     that laws should be imposed that, if an individual is picked up DWI or 
     found DWI by an officer, that that individual should be dealt with 
     quickly and severly and that if the age is to be 18 then the 
     individual who sells or purchases for an underage people they should 
     also be dealt with harshly, go to jail, lose their license etc.  Oh, 
     and the license thing.  It is not a right, it is a priviledge, be sure 
     and make the distinction between the two.

Gary, my experience with hot water heaters is that they are a glass tank
covered with insulation which is then covered with a steel jacket. Unless
you have a type different than from what Ive seen, it would be next to
impossible, if not expensive, to cut the standard gas water heater in half.
Further, although you can heat water to scalding temps, boiling temps might
be a problem even if the top is removed, i.e., I am not sure the insulation
and steel jacket on most is constructed to work with temps in excess of 212F
for an hour or more. I assume you're talking about boiling (not mashing)
since you mention cutting it in half (open top).

Subject: Evil bungs on pre-filled mini-kegs


I've just stared using mini-kegs to brew into, and needed to collect a
few of the things to actually use.  So I had the choice between buying
empty ones at a store for $7.50, or full of beer for $12.  Not a tough
choice.


One of the local beer stores got in some minis of Algonquin Country
Lager, which seemed like the right thing for a party this past
weekend.  (I can't recommend Algonquin Lager -- it's short on body and
character.)


When I went to un-bung the can to clean it out, I had an awful
discovery: they used an evil difficult-to-remove composite plastic and
rubber outer bung.  I had to cut the darn thing apart, and will have to
urethane over the scratches I put on the top before I can re-use the
can.


So, if you are in the store considering buying a nice mini that
happens to already contain some beer, try to gently lift an edge of
the rubber part of the bung.  If it bends up fairly easily, you've
probably okay.  If it won't bend up despite reasonable force, it's
likely to be an awful composite bung; try another brand.

Subject: Honey: clover or orange blossum?


     Fellow Homebrewers,
     
     I read once that using clover honey will result in "grassy" flavors.  
     That source (forgot who/where) suggested using orange blossom honey 
     instead.  I'm getting ready to make a barleywine that will have allot 
     of honey in it - any thoughts pro or con on clover vs orange blossom 
     (or any other variety)?

Subject: Candling Beers.




Rob Lauriston and Spencer Thomas both wrote me about the candling question.
(Shining a flashlight through your beer to see how it's doing.)  They have 
convinced me that it's nothing to worry about.  The light from a flashlight
is not terribly bright, not very strong around 520 nm (a greenish light) 
which is the active range for "skunking", and doesn't shine through a large
volume of the beer at one time like sunlight or other diffuse light would.


By my estimation, it would take several hours or days of direct flashilight
exposure to significantly skunk a beer.  So, if you use a glass carboy, spend
a couple minutes every week or so peering through it with a flashlight.  
It's fun.  And talk to your yeast, just like talking to your plants, it really
helps.  (Maybe not, but it does help remind your loved ones how weird you are,
and reminds them to cut you some slack once in awhile...)

Subject: SIPA  (Sour India Pale Ale)


Greetings!
I have been reading your posts for a couple of weeks.  Great information!  I
have been homebrewing for a few years, using extracts.  Have considered moving
into all grain, but not yet made the leap.  The info here certainly helps.  


Perhaps one of you could help me with something that worries me about my last
batch:


India Pale Ale attempt:
8 lbs Alexanders Pale malt extract
1 1/2 lbs crystal
1/2 lbs toasted malt
2 oz northern brewers `at` 9.6% 
1 oz casade `at` 4.6 (flavor)
1 oz cascade `at` 4.6 (aroma)


Brought crystal and toasted to a boil in 1 1/2 gallons water, removed grains,
added extract, brought to boil, tossed in bittering hops, boiled for 50
minutes, added 1 oz cascade, boiled for 9 more minutes, tossed in 1 oz
cascade, boiled one more minute, threw in carboy on top of 2 gallons cold
water, filled to 5 gallons, added yeastlab A04 liquid yeast (started the day
before) primary 5 days, racked to secondary, secondary 6 days.  Bottled.


The problem...when bottling, I took a little taste (admit it, we all do it). 
I detected a weird taste. Could be banana/sour esters?  Am I worrying too
much? is this normal with this much malt and hops?  Should I just go out and
buy a six-pack of Grant's IPA and dump the batch?  Any obvious screw-ups?


Also, should I increase the amount of water I boil the malt with? I have kept
it a low volume so that when I added it to the water, it would be cool enough
to pitch the yeast right away.  Do I get better results using more water for a
more robust boil, then staying up later waiting for temp to drop?


Thanks.

Subject: Extract Numbers & Conversion (yet again)


Just a follow-up, concurring with Kirk Fleming's reply to Kenny Eddy about
extract figures.    flemingk`at`usa.net (Kirk R Fleming) in # 1846 re
(KennyEddy`at`aol.com) in #1843.  (Apologies if I'm getting your name wrong.)


When doing a 'Congress mash' in the lab to produce the malt stats and you
are testing a malt which IS diastatic, the sample which you mash contains
only the grain for which you want values.  But when you are testing a malt
which is *NOT* diastatic, you use 50% of the malt you are trying to test and
50% of a diastatic pale malt of known characteristics (actually, a pale malt
which has a given set of characteristics).  You then take the results and
extrapolate what the contribution of the non-diastatic malt is to the
observed values for extract, colour, etc.  These are the numbers which are
reported in the analysis of a non-diastatic malt. 


That's why Kenny (?) observes, " I would think that roasting grains would
destroy
> some to all of the starch's conversion capability, yet I see malts like
> chocolate or even black patent listed with extractions not much different
> that pale malts.


 If you do a lab mash on sample which contains only non-diastatic malt (or
malt with very little diastatic power) you typically get lower extract
values, sometimes much lower.  (This is partly because you have to filter
the mash before taking a gravity, and a non-diastatic mash can be a bit
gooey.)  Since these grains aren't used by themselves, the numbers from such
analysis would have no practical meaning.  Instead, the numbers are meant to
indicate what the grains will do in a mash with diastatic grain, and so they
are observed and calculated from a mash with diastatic grain.  I'm pretty
sure both EBC and ASBC methods do this.


As Kirk says, " I'd like to stress that the 'extract' figures given for
grains of any kind are a measure of one thing and one thing only: the
specific gravity of the solubles in the grain, WHATEVER THEY MAY BE."

I don't think there are specific laws about it, but I do know that some 
homebrew stores do check IDs, and have signs posted that they won't sell to
people under 21.  I always assumed this was to avoid some secondary claim of
them "contributing to the delinquency" or something if some local sheriff took
it on themselves to crack down on this or that.

There is also evidence that, at least on major interstates, the faster drivers
tend to have fewer accidents per mile driven.  If you measure accidents per 
ticket, or something like that, you get different results.  (Think how much 
safer these drivers would be if they slowed down a little?)  Anyway, this is
not really relevant.


> Let me challenge you Kenneth, today on your way home

I'll bet it depends a lot on where Kenneth lives.  In Chicago, you get there
faster if you try to drive a little slower.  That doesn't work everywhere.  
(Also, in Chicago, we have more pothole than road.  YMMV, I hope.)


Back to brewing.

Subject: JOCKEY BOXES


     I am planning to make the move to kegging but have no dedicated 
     refrigerator for the kegs. I plan to make a jockey box using a small 
     ice chest (6-pack size) with copper tubing coiled and permanently 
     mounted inside. To allow the coil to drain (after the keg pressure is 
     released), the inlet will be near the top of the ice chest and the 
     outlet near the bottom. The *plan* is to fill the ice chest with water 
     and freeze the whole thing, coil and all. To chill my beer, I'll hook 
     the jockey box in-line between the keg and the tap. I'll empty the 
     beer from the inside of the coil before freezing.
     
     Does anyone see a problem with freezing the coils in a block of ice? 
     Will the coil break as the ice expands? Will the beer freeze as it 
     travels through the frozen copper? Any other ideas or suggestions?

While this is interesting so far, I haven't seen anyone specifically spell 
out the Federal position.  The sections of US law that exempt homebrewers 
from paying brewing taxes and related items (commonly referred to as the law
making homebrewing legal), define a homebrewer as someone at least 18 years 
old or of legal drinking age in their state, if higher.


So, no matter what the states do, you aren't a legal homebrewer federally 
until 18, even if the drinking age in your state becomes 3.

     This legal age to brew thing really has my curiosity, since my 2-year 
     old son helps with the process.  In fact, I can't brew without him 
     begging to participate (stir, measure, dump in stuff).  He thinks it's 
     his equipment anyway.
     
     The way I see it, on brewing day there isn't anything alcoholic about 
     it.  Just a bunch of organic things in a big ol' bucket of water.  A 
     whole lot like making soup or tea; just different ingredients.
     
     Outside of heat, there's generally little about the brewing process 
     that can hurt him.  He could get hurt a whole lot more helping me work 
     on the car.
     
     Homebrewing really is a family project.  We can make something 
     together and learn about recipes, ingredients, food preparation, 
     cleaning, organic and physical chemistry, thermodynamics, fluid 
     mechanics, mechanical engineering, microbiology, materials science, 
     economics, and patience.  If that doesn't qualify for a 
     family-oriented educational project, when what does?

     watch the yeast making bubbles, and putting bottle caps on anything 
     that resembles a bottle.  I'll bet you didn't know Barney fits into a

The Doubleday Dictionary defines infusion so:


"3. The process of steeping or soaking any substance in a liquid to extract
its properties without boiling."


American Heritage doesn't have "infusion" but defines "infuse" as:


"3. To steep or soak without boiling."


(both references were used without permission - shame on me)
(I've ignored other definitions - these two applied much more directly)


Now it seems to me that the term "infusion mashing" was used to distinguish
from decoction mashing, where the grain is not simply "steeped or soaked", it
is boiled, etc.  These definitions do not say anything about stepping up the
temperature by boiling water additions, as Al says.  So using these sources,
I could easily claim that (R)ecirculation (I)nfusion (M)ash (S)ystem is
perfectly appropriate, as is "upward infusion", "step infusion", and the like.


Proclaiming all of this as "simply wrong" seems dogmatic at best.  Can
you support your position, AL?  It sounds like Capt. Kirk is right on this
one.

Subject: 60-70: Nice mnemonic, but...


For those such as myself, who use Celsius and also are in need of all the
mental crutches we can get, the G. Fix 60 C.- 70 C. conversion schedule is a
godsend as a mnemonic.  (The two-rest conversion clearly also has the virtue
of easy manipulation by adjusting gross relative times, rather than
attempting to precision-tune the single temperature in a one-rest
conversion).  


However:  For those of us who do these rests by parking the temperature at a
certain point and letting the mash sit (imperfectly insulated) as the
temperature drifts down a little, I think the mnemonic needs a patch. In
line with my own recent results, apparently confirming Ross Brodeur's
observations on HBD the other day about beta activity at 60- being notably
less than at a couple of degrees above 60...  (And given that optimum temps.
for alpha without it disappearing too fast are 70 and a little below..)
Therefore..  


I think that for us drifters it probably makes sense to consider the
"60" degree rest to be a rest which ENDS at 60C., 
whereas the "70" degree rest BEGINS at 70C.
That's the patch I'd propose.

Absolutely not.  RIMS is the *OPPOSITE* of a decoction mashing system.
In a decoction mashing system, the THICKEST part of the mash (mostly grain,
very little liquid) is heated, whereas in the RIMS, the thinnest part of
the mash is heated.  Maybe a more correct term would be Recirculating
Runnings Mashing System (RRMS).

Standard College Dictionary, indeed, one of the meanings for "infusion" is
the extraction of something by soaking a substance in a liquid (often water).
However, if indeed this is the case, then aren't all mashes "infusion" mashes?
How else can we convert the starches to sugars and then separate them from
the husks than by soaking the malt in water?  I do not believe that I am
artificially narrowing the meaning of "infusion mash" but rather trying to
get the usage of the expression back on course.  British brewing books use
this terminology more often than American books as they commonly refer to the
temperature-control additions of hot water to the mash as "infusions."  This
is the source of my reasoning that the it is the *other* meaning of the word
"infuse," namely "to pour in" (from the Middle English word "infusen," Middle
French word "infuser" and the Latin word "infusus" pp. of "infundere" all
meaning "to pour in").  Also from Webster's: "INFUSE implies a pouring in of
something that gives new life or significance;"


I feel that the usage of the words "infuse" and "infusion" were corrupted a
long time ago to include the wider meaning of the resulting extraction made
from an infusion of liquid, but I'm quite sure that this was NOT the meaning
of the words as applied to mashing.  If that's not the case, then what's the
point?  "Infusion mashing" would then be no more specific than "mashing."


Furthermore, as if this thread needs more life, Kirk writes:
>You either get the solubles out by steeping (infusion) or by boiling
>(decoction).


The purpose of the decoctions is not to get solubles out of the grain, but
rather a way to increase the temperature of the mash.  I've read that the
need for decoctions arose from the need to raise the temperature of the
mash reproducably without the use of a thermometer, but I would not be
surprised to find that it may also have been partly due to the fact that
you can't apply direct flame to a wooden mash/laeuter tun.  Well, not for
long.  Therefore, in summation, it only makes sense that if one is to
add the qualifier "decoction" to one method of increasing mash temperature
then the other qualifier "infusion" refers to another method of increasing
mash temperature.

It might work, but you must, at least, be cautious of the pH.  The pH of
my tapwater is in the high 7's ususally and that will extract quite a bit
of tannin from the hops.  Ray Daniels, in a talk on beer colour at the
AHA Nationals, showed a *brown* liquid which was simply hops boiled in water.
The pH of beer is usually (hopefully) in the mid to low 5's.  I don't know,
however, whether acidifying your hop boiling water would solve all your
problems.

Subject: Hydrometer


Hi.  I'm pretty new to this...well, I'm working on my first batch right
now.  In fact, it's about ready to be bottled, but I'm not quite sure.
So, my question is, I've got this hydrometer, and I'm pretty sure I can
figure out how to use it, but then again, I don't want to risk five
gallons of beer if I'm wrong.  So, I think it's time to bottle, I open up
my fermenting bucket, drop the hydrometer in, take a reading and
then...what?  Close up tt and take another reading the next day?
Can you do that, or does it skunk the beer to open the fermenting bucket
and then not bottle it?  If I decide to risk bottling the beer without
taking a reading, how do I know how much more sugar to put in beer?
Anyway, I hope that these questions aren't too inane.
Thanks,
Sascha
