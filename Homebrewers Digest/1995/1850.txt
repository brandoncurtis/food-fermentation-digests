  I have only tried the cherry Kriek from BrewFerm.  My first Kriek
came out a little watery and I followed the included directions to the
letter.  One can of extract, 1lb corn sugar, 11 Liters of water and dry
ale yeast provided.
  The second batch I used double the extract and sugar, but only used
19 Liters of water.  This brew has a little more backbone and tastes
more like the Kriek from Belgium.  I used 1C. of corn sugar for priming
and would not exceed that as the bottles are highly carbonated (like a
soda pop).

Subject: decoction mashing/60C rests


Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm getting very bored
with this discussion of RIMS versus RDMS versus RRMS.  Call it whatever
you want... I don't care anymore.  As long as we all know what a poster
is referring to, then it doesn't matter what he/she calls it.

It is incorrect to say that you decoct runnings in a decoction mash
(except for the final decoction).  If you take only the liquid portion
of the mash and boil it, you are:


1. denaturing the enzymes (the enzymes are in the liquid of a mash), and


2. not increasing your extraction of starch from the steely tips of the
   malt (assuming you are using undermodified malt -- but as I've posted
   before, this is rather academic with current malts).


At this point, I don't care what dictionaries say, and I'm not going to
bother to look and see if you haven't conveniently omitted any definitions
that are contrary to your position.  Look at what brewing books say.  In a
decoction mash, you are supposed to take the thickest part of the mash for
the first one, two or three decoctions and the thinnest part (runnnings) for
the last decoction -- the one that takes you into mashout.  The reason that
you take only the runnings (no grain) in the final decoction is because once
you add this final decoction back, you will have denatured all the enzymes
in the entire mash and will not have enzymes to convert any starch released
in the boiling of the final decoction.


Sorry about the decoction lesson, but decoction mashing is confusing enough
without mixing up the steps in which you use thickest and thinnest parts of
the mash.  For more on decoction mashing (and simpler mashing techniques)
see the 1995 Special Issue of Zymurgy.


Now let's go on to other subjects, please?


Here's another subject:


Regan writes:

No.  The rest at 60C (140F) is at the very low end of the active range
of beta amylase and is at the high end of protease range.  Since the
rate of enzymatic action is temperature-dependent, the rest at 60C
does very little saccharification (unless we are talking hours) and thus 
is primarily for the action of protease.  Protease breaks big proteins
into medium-sized proteins.  So the 60C rest is a protein rest and
is not really much of a factor in the fermentability of the beer.

Subject: Can inserts for "pub style" beer


Greetings to the collective-
        One of my associates has brought several cans of beer from England
from a recent trip.  Cans with inserts (i.e. Guiness) apparently account
for almost half of the sales of can beer in England.  After drinking the
beers, he's been cutting the cans open and finding an amazing variety of
widgets inside.  Few are a simple as the Guiness insert - some are so
complex you can't believe that the person who designed them was actually
serious!
        Is there an information source about these gadgets anywhere?  I
realize these don't exactly have application for homebrewers, but would
appreciate a point in the right direction - patent, trade journal blurb,
anything...
                        TIA

Subject: RE: Dry hopping


Hi All!


     Charles asked in HBD #1847 about dry hopping.  I use a _nylon_ hop bag
that has a draw string sewn into the top of the bag.  I use pellets, and the
bag keeps most of the hops out of the final beer, but not the hop nose :^). 
It used to be a real pain to get the hop bag out of the carboy before
transferring to the bottling bucket.  Then I tied a length of dental floss
(unflavored, unwaxed) to the end of the draw string, and now have no problem
pulling the bag of hops out.  I just tie the hop bag closed, and push it into
the carboy, where the bag sinks under the liquid, and leave part of the dental
floss hanging out of the neck.  The fermentation lock and stopper easily seal
the opening from the outside, and keeps the dental floss from falling into the
carboy.  To remove, just grab the dental floss and pull the bag out.  I
permanently leave the dental floss tied to the hop bag, and sanitize
everything before using.  I Hope this helps :^)

Homebrewers


     I just got started kegging (two in the fridge). Question about idoine: I
live in a rural area with a lot of dairies. The local hardware store has an
iodine solution for wounds that is 7% iodine, 5%(iodine something) and 88%
alcohol. Can I use this mixture to sanitize my kegs and associated hardware
as long as I rinse well with hot water. If so how would I determine what the
ratio would be if I'm shooting for 12-14PPM. I used a heavy bleach solution
for the first two, which I understand is not recommended for SS, with only a
10 min contact time and lots of hot water rinse. The beer is fine a great
ESB.

Dave Rodger complains that his apartment has an old kitchen sink faucet that
is brewing impaired.  Try this:  get an old fashioned hand held shower hose
from your local drug store.  Less than $5.  At one end will be the shower
head and the other end will have a rubber coupling that is intended to fit
over a bath or kitchen sink faucet.  Pull off the shower head (useful for
sparging, BTW) and attach the now free end to your wort chiller.  Slip the
coupling over the faucet and you are in business.  Don't turn on too much
water pressure though or the coupling might slip off.  It worked for me when
I used to brew in the kitchen.

Bud Swings Ax At Budding Nation: Editorial Column
- -------------------------------------------------
You may call it a matter of business, but we call it nastiness. If 
you're still drinking Bud, perhaps you'll join us in a boycott to 
send the same message to them that they gave to the good people of the 
Czech Republic. In last month's RBPMail we spoke of Anheuser-Busch's 
thwarted plans to buy Budvar, the small Czech brewery also using the 
Budweiser name. The conspicuous reasons were to open the way to 
marketing the U.S. brand in Europe, probably by dismantling and 
destroying the older brewery. The Czech government decided it was in 
their best national interest to preserve the cultural integrity and 
historical property of their brewery. In a malicious adolescent tantrum, 
A-B has canceled all purchases of the Saaz hops from the budding 
democracy, presumable indefinitely. Although you'll be hard pressed 
to find hops in any single A-B beer, their products represent 4 of 
every 10 beers consumed in America, and therefore employ an enormous 
amount of hops overall. The move will deeply hurt the poorest people 
in the Czech Hops food chain - peasants, small farmers, dock workers, 
etc. Is this how we in the beer community want to be known around the 
world? Shame on Bud.

You can make a strong argument that it's not beer until you pitch the
yeast.  Prior to that, you're just making a malt-based beverage.  If
you never pitched yeast, it would never be beer, and there would be no
legal bar to the kids consuming it.


Perhaps the law has changed since I was a kid, but when I was growing
up (New York state), it was ok for parents to give alcoholic beverages

If the US legalized drugs, and they were available for over the counter 
purchase like alcohol and tobacco, there would be a couple of 
well-documented effects, based on US pre-prohibition and the experience 
in other coutries with legalized/decriminalized drug laws:


1 - the drugs would be marketed and sold by major corporations, not 
street gangs and organized crime.


2 - the drugs would drop in strength and price, increase in purity. Crack
is a direct result of the need for drugs to be sold in their most
concentrated form when they are illegal. Before it was illegal, cocaine
was found in any number of low-strength products, such as Coca-Cola. The
Kennedy family didn't make their fortune smuggling in wine and beer, but
in distilled spirits, which command the highest price per unit volume.
(Collector wines are the only execption to this).


3 - Social pressure can control use of drugs. The US has seen a major 
shift in the last 20 years in the perception of the use of tobacco and 
alcohol. In movies, the bad guys smoke nowdays. The "loveable drunk" is 
no longer a staple character. Conversely, it greatly effects how illegal 
drugs are used - there really is a "drug culture".

Most people that study organized crime in the US agree that if drugs were 
legalized, it would be a _major_ blow to organized crime and the gangs, 
as it would quickly be taken over by corporate interests. The gangs have 
essentially no other way to make money (bookmaking and prostitution are 
not in their areas of expertise.)

Most, but not all, junkies go in for non-violent crime. The drug related 
violence is mostly turf wars by the gang members who are not junkies.

In the late 70s, when I last was studying this, drug addiction was 
responsible for at least 75% of burglaries and other minor thefts.

But all governmental efforts to do so have _failed_. Addiction is a 
_medical_ problem, not a criminal one. Even when the drug laws were 
incredibly draconian, the demand was still there. One addiction expert I 
saw interviewed by William F. Buckley predicted a short term rise in use 
after a legalization, followed by a drop to lower levels than today.


The problem is complex, there are many competing interests and it 
involves private personal behavior, so don't count on the governments 
doing the right thing. :-(

Good idea. I made it last year, cutting back on the ginger slightly. It 
didn't hit peak flavor until 3-4 months in the bottle.

Yesterday I made a post about assembling a copper manifold using wire
threaded through holes in the joints.  I should mention that it would work
better to assemble the manifold using 1/16" holes instead of 1/4" holes - it
might pass a bit of grain with 1/4" holes :}.

Subject: Pumpkin Ale Recipes


Hi Y'all,


A friend of mine was recently raving about the Pumpkin Ale at Capitol City
Brewing in DC and I said to myself...."self, I should brew a pumpkin ale for
the holidays."  Unfortunately I quickly realized that I didn't know how to brew
such a beer.  Can anyone help me out here?


Can a pumpkin beer be made with extracts and pumpkin pie filling or is it
necessary to mash bits of pumpkin with the grain?  How should the pumpkin be
prepared prior to mashing?  I'd be interested to hear any good and or bad
experiences about brewing with pumpkin.


On another note, I made a post about a week ago requesting cider recipes to
which I received no replies.  Several people e-mailed me and expressed interest
in the recipes.  If anyone has a good cider recipe or knows of a place on the
net which I can find some I would really appreciate it.  TIA

Subject: Re: Scaling recipes


First, I'm happy to say I now have my own identity (and no longer have to 
masquerade as Mario).  :)


Jim, I believe, asked about scaling batches up to larger sizes.  It 
sounds from his setup like he is considering doing partial mashes, 
boiling 15 gallons of concentrated wort and diluting to 45 gallons (feel 
free to correct me if I missed something).  My first concern would be 
your anticipated OG.  Does anyone know the upper limites of OGs? (i.e., 
how much extract can be dissolved into wort until it is saturated?)  I 
think 1.120 is doable (seem to remember someone discussing if before), 
but when dilluted,  this would achieve a 1.040 OG.  How high can he go?


Other considerations that come to mind:  hop utilization is changed when 
doing a concentrated boil (higher gravity means lower hop util.).  A 
program like Suds is helpful in determining how much extra hopping you 
need to do (decide on the IBUs you want in the final product, and use 
Suds to calculate, in this case, 3 times the IBUs for the 15 gallon 
concentrated boil -- I believe IBUs will *dillute* in a linear fashion).  I 
have done this in doubling batches, with good results.  Let me know if you 
have more questions about it.


One last consideration: more darkening of the wort will occur in a 
concentrated boil than in a full boil (and don't forget that extracts 
will darken the result on their own -- even the extra-lights don't seem 
to be so light).


Hope this helps.

Subject: Two questions about sediment....


1)  Sometimes I'm too busy to rack out of the primary promptly and have let
brews sit there for as long as 2 weeks.


What are the dangers or problems (esp. in terms of taste) with letting the
brew sit too long on the primary sediment?  What is the optimum time to
rack from the primary?


I brew all-grain and use liquid yeast, and vigourous foamy fermentation is
usually over by the fourth or fifth day.


2)  For reusing yeast, all I do is pour the sediment from the previous
batch  into a sanitised jar, then stick it into the fridge for up to 2
weeks.  Come pitching time, I just dump it into the next brew as is (I let
it come to room temp. first).  I've only done this a few times, and haven't
noticed any obvious problems.  Is this a *bad* technique in the opinion of
the yeastily wise?


Also, which is better for such repitching:  the sediment from the primary
or the secondary?

Subject: Home casking Information?


A fellow brewer asked me if I had seen any information on cask conditioning
for homebrews. He's seen small casks, 2, 5, and 10 gallons available, and is
wondering if the process is too complicated for the casual homebrewer. 


My thoughts are: cleaning the cask has got to be tough, South Florida is not
the best place unless he has a fridge set up for ale temps, and even then,
he beter drink fast (or invite all of us over!)


Is there a faq, or does someone have personal experiences they can share?
Private email is ok, I will summarize for the group.


Thanks,

Hi everyone:


I've already received several replies regarding ordering internationally,
and it looks like even with shipping the price will be half what it is
in Japan at the stores.  I've also gotten some inquiries from a few fellow
ex-patriates, so as soon as I can organize everything I'll post so that
others can benefit.


One important bit of trivia is that 800 numbers cannot be accessed
from outside the U.S.  It is truly frustrating to discover an ad for
something useful that only gives an 800 number as a means of
contacting the company, since there's simply no way to call them from
Japan.  Of course, 800 numbers are so prevalent that most people
(including those who are responsible for creating ad copy) would never
dream there'd be a problem using them from far away--but there is.


Thanks again to all who've sent replies.

Subject: Alcohol & mortality:  New study


No responsibility is taken for relaying the following information, which I
quote as it was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, the local "quality"
newspaper.  I will try to obtain the actual full report when it is
published, and will relay the information at that time.  


A five-year study of alcohol consumption and mortality has been carried out
in the country town of Dubbo, New South Wales.  It involved (initially) 2805
persons over the age of 60, of whom 2300 were still alive at the end of the
period.  (I believe the five years were over in 1993, and the study is
continuing.) 


Results:


If you had "up to 2" standard drinks a day ("one standard drink" = approx.
10 ounces of beer, or the alcohol equivalent in wine or spirits), you were
10% more likely to be alive at the end of the period than if you had none.


If you had "2 to 3" standard drinks a day, you were 30% more likely to be
alive at the end of the period than if you had none.


If you had "3 or more" standard drinks a day, you were 60% more likely to
be alive at the end of the period than if you had none.


   This kind of information will not be startling news to anyone who has
seen the results of studies relating to, for example, the "Mediterranean
Diet", focused on red wine and other foods, where olive oil, natural
temperamental laid-back-ness [supposedly], etc., may be factors.  The
protective factor(s) in wine are under investigation.  But this Australian
study is the first I've seen where the predominant alcoholic beverage is
(almost certainly) beer...  (As you probably know or would surmise, the
drinking habits of the older generation in Australian country towns feature
beer very prominently.) 


    The above numbers are what the article said.  Naturally, take all such
stuff with a grain of ... well, not salt -- perhaps a grain of malt. 
Drink in moderation.
