  There are undoubtedly several valid critiques of what the stats are
saying, but it's unlikely that this is one of them, except perhaps in a
subsidiary, contributing way.  In order for this explanation to account for
the correlation, the population of people over 60 who survived through the
five year period of the study who were drinkers of "3 or more standard
drinks a day" would have to be postulated as being significantly *happier*,
*better* adjusted people than the five-year survivors who only drank "up to
2 standard drinks a day".  I have never encountered a <sacred book>-thumping
teetotaler who would think that drinking 3 is more wicked than drinking 2.
Once you have demonstrated your free-and-easy, life-loving qualities by
drinking "up to 2 standard drinks a day", I doubt very much that you
demonstrate those qualities MORE by having "3 or more".  And yet the stats
show much better survival numbers for the relatively heavier, as contrasted
with the somewhat more moderate drinkers.  


  OK, why then?  Try this:  Say there's an iron-constitutioned segment of
the older population, whom virtually NO amount of alcohol would kill.  Say
that being a heavy drinker increases your likelihood of being knocked out of
the total population *before* the age of 60.  The more you drink, above a
certain moderate level, the more likely it is that you will fall victim to
one of the ills that are known to be alcohol related.  Thus, the more you
drink, the less likely it is that you will pass the age-60 boundary, and
thus, past 60, the more statistically likely it is that you and your
surviving age-mates at your consumption level are members of the
iron-constitutioned elite.  OK, so we have a study -- (BTW a well funded
university study employing stats bods whose full-time occupation it is to
think about what correlations mean and don't mean...).  The study recruits
only persons who are over 60.  Among these, if my hypothesized scenario is
right, the members of the habitual "3 drinks and over" sub-group have been
to some extent naturally pre-selected for alcohol "immunity", while the
habitual "up to 2 drinks" population (undoubtedly more numerous) has only
been *partially* pre-selected for alcohol "immunity".  If such a picture is
correct, then you would predict that the habitual heavier drinking sub-group
in this population would, on average, survive longer than the
moderate-drinking group; with the "2 to 3 drinks" group in the middle.  And
this is just what the correlations do show.  OK, so that's one conceivable,
if perhaps somewhat far-fetched, explanation.  


   Another hypothesis is of course simply that alcohol or something else in
beer confers a survival advantage, so that the more you have (within reason)
the better. This I doubt, but obviously it's the port of first resort.  The
[what is sometimes referred to as the] Zorba-the-Greek hypothesis (i.e. that
it's all a matter of being laid-back, non-dogmatic, fun-loving folk who are
not uptight about drinking) doesn't explain why drinking quite a bit shows
up here as *so* much "better" for survival than drinking what is, after all,
still a pretty fun amount.  (Unless we're talking about *my* homebrew, in
which case you'd have to be out of your mind to stop at two...  ;-)

Subject: Pumpkin Recipes


I'll share two successful pumpkin recipes:


Pumpkin Ale:
  (for 12.5 gallons)
6.0 litres Ale Malt
  Grains:
   330g Carastan
   200g Wheat
   500g Oat groats
1 soccer-ball sized pumpkin (cleaned, cut in 1-2" cubes w/o skin, & mashed
with the grains)
500g turbinado sugar
   Hops:
   boil: 130g Hallertauer
   mid: 50g Fuggles (optional)
   finish: Bramlings
Irish moss
Nottingham (dry) Ale yeast


Notes:  A modified nut brown ale recipe.  
Pumpkin colored, I could definately taste the pumpkin, a not-too-sweet ale.  
I force carbonated & noticed this was very drinkable within 2 weeks.
"A do again"
________________
Holiday Harvest Ale:
  (for 12.5 gallons)
3.0 litres Ale Malt
3.0 litres Dark Malt
  Grains:
   330g Carastan
   200g Roasted barley
   200g Wheat
   500g Oat groats
   650g Rye
1 soccer-ball sized pumpkin (cleaned, cut in 1-2" cubes w/o skin, & mashed
with the grains)
500g turbinado sugar
   Hops:
   boil: 130g Hallertauer
   mid: 50g Fuggles
   finish: Bramlings
Thumb of Ginger (peeled, sliced, & tossed in at mid boil)
28g Nutmeg (tossed in at finish boil)
28g Cinnamon  (tossed in at finish boil)
Irish moss
Nottingham (dry) Ale yeast


Notes:  Lots of stuff in this recipe. stew brew?  
Initially I thought I ruined this batch, since the cinnamon was the dominant
smell during fermentation (and bottling).  Also force carbonated, then
bottled.  Best after 2 months, and got better with age. Fairly bitter, but
well balanced, I could taste everything.  "A definate do again"
Cheerio,

Something similar happened to me, except I still have my kids!  Someone
_anonomously_ reported me for child abuse because they saw me let my 4 year
old have a sip of beer in my own back yard.  (There is an alley in back
where, in early spring, you can see through the trees into my back yard.)


Child protection services came to my house and interrogated me while I was
home on my lunch hour.  (I came home to check on a ferment!)  They were
extremely rude about it and told me not to allow anyone to see this again.
(They didn't say not to do it!  As if it was legal, but that they didn't
want to be bothered again.)  I was shocked at first, and was very compliant
with them, but I'll probably never get over the feeling of harrassment and
injustice.  They insisted that I give them our pediatrician's name, and my
son's day care, etc... and for months whenever I went there all I could
think about was what they had been told or asked about.  I probably should
have told child protection to leave and called my lawyer, but out of fear,
or ignorance, I didn't.  If I had been as rude to them as they were to me,
who knows?


My son never actually drank _any_ beer--just tasted sips of it. At first, I
thought that it would be a good idea to let him try it thinking that he
woudn't like it.  (That probably works for Budweiser, but not for
homebrew!)  I certainly was not trying to promote it, but thinking that (as
Spencer said in #1851) that my son would probably be better adjusted to it
if it weren't "verboten."  He did start asking for it, and I think at the
time that we were probably "observed" he said that he "likes beer" or
something to that effect which might have been overheard.  Now, I just tell
him that it's a "grown up drink" and that he can have some when he grows
up, and he has completely stopped asking for it.  Besides what has already
happened, I'm concerned that he might tell someone (teachers, for example)
something like, "My Daddy lets me drink beer," and that is just too likely
to get blown WAY out of proportion.  I've never had him help me brew,
because I always brew after the kids are in bed.  He likes to watch the
airlock bubble though--Don't we all?


I have no idea what the Indiana law is, or who the child protection people
really are (agents of the court, I suppose).  Sorry this is so depressing,
especially at a time when it seems we have lost all sense of justice in
America.  I intend to find out before my son is actually old enough to
enjoy some of my brews.

Subject: GABF Trip Report


         Great American Beer Festival 1995 -- Trip Report


What a week of beer!  Living in Colorado has many rewards, excellant
homebrew clubs, first rate microbreweries and brewpub, and the GABF!
Between the GABF and the homebrew clubs this was one big week.


Tuesday night it's off to Boulder's Hop Barley and the Ale'rs.  This year
Geoff Larson from Alaskan Brewing Co. brought 2 cases of his 1993 and 2
cases of his 1994 Alaskan Smoked Porter.


He gave a great presentation on smoked beers and how to make them.  He
described how many different woods (including thistle and catus!) could
be used but certain hard woods are the best.  Geoff uses alder to brew
his porter every December.  This is one fine beer and it (again) took
the gold medal.




Wednesday night I was one of a few non-professionals invited to the
GABF's Brewers and Judges Gathering at the Westin Hotel in downtown
Denver.  This is the opening evening festivities for the GABF.  I and
11 others Professional Panel Blind Tasting (PPBT) table captains are
invited each year.


This is a great opportunity to start hob nobbing with the brewers and
other beer nobility.  Everybody in the craft brewing professional was
there.  Michael Jackson, Charlie Papazian, Carol Stoudt, Bruce Joseph,
Fred Eckhardt and the like.




All day Thursday and Friday I was a table captain at the PPBT at the
Executive Tower Inn.  This is the GABF judging session and this year we
had 1265 different beers divided amongst 78 judges.


As a PPBT volunteer we have the responsibility to serve the judges the
various styles.  This has many rewards including the opportunity to
taste the beers before the public sessions and get first hand knowledge
of the new and best beers .  This year I had the honor to work with Fred
Eckhardt, George Fix, Charlie Papazian, and Eric Warner to name a few.




Thursday night was the BIG night for my other homebrew club, the Keg Ran
Out Club.  This club is less than one year old but we are going strong. 
Myself and 2 others organized our First Annual KROC World Brewers Forum
conviently located at the Executive Towers Inn.  We were extremely fortunate
to have Pierre Celis and Greg Noonan be our guest speakers.


Pierre, for those who don't know, still lives in Belgium 10 months out of
the year.  His daughter Cristina and son-in-law Peter Camps run the
brewery in Austin.  Pierre is one of the most warm and cordial 70 year old
gentlemen I have ever met.  


He talked for 45 minutes on his background in brewing (his first
experience was at the age of 7), his partnership with Miller, and a
real tear-jerking of a WWII story.


Pierre was so found of the Americans that were stationed in Belguim
during the war that he felt he must give something back to the US.  His
beers are 100% American from everything from the malt, hops, to the labels.
His White and Grand Cru are truly wonderful gifts!


Greg Noonan, whom is more like a homebrewer than the professional he is,
talked passionately about his feelings toward the big boys (mainly
Anheuser-Busch) and their attempts to disspell the craft brewing trade.
He did commend Miller and their hands-off approach with Celis and stated
this type of partnership is what the craft brewers really want.


Greg also went into detail about various malts, their suppliers, and
how to weed out the good ones from the bad.  He encouraged the homebrewers
to get their homebrew shops to provide data sheets for the malts they
purchase.


My homebrew supplier, John Irwin from The Homebrew Hut (a sponser of the
World Brewers Forum), was on hand so I can expect this type of information
in the future.


Our meeting had over 90 attendendees from all of the country and we are
already looked forward to the second forum and a special event this
spring to coinincide with the World Beer Cup to be held in Denver.


This was a great deal of work we are not able to do this alone.  The
Homebrew Hut in Broomfield Colorado, The American Homebrewers Association,
and The Celis Brewery of Austin Texas were all sponsers.


Many homebrew shops and microbreweries in the Denver/Boulder area helped
us as well by donating hats, t-shirts, gift certificates, books, memberships,
and beer.  The clib name Keg Ran Out Club is really an inside joke--we have
only run out of beer once and that was as we concluded our 4th meeting
are were walking out the door!




Friday morning I finished my PPBT duties and headed over to the GABF.
Each year gets better as I become acquanted with more and more homebrewers
and professionals.  The GABF is beginning to feel more and more like a
big party with your old drinking buddies.  Hey wait a minute...that's what
it is all about!  I spent more time talking with old friends than serious
drinking but overall I had more fun than any of the years prior.


Peter Camps poured me a Celis "Cruberry" (pronouced with the proper
Flemish accent).  This is two parts Grand Cru to one part Celis Raspberry.
Needless to say after getting to know Pierre and Peter from Thursday I felt
very comfortable amongst the Celis elite and enjoying their brews
(repeatedly).




Saturday afternoon I attended both the AHA members only tasting and the
evening session.  Instead of sampling the beers I listened to the awards
ceremony.  Celis took home 2 medals, a gold for their White and a silver
for their Grand Cru.


The Colorado Rockies Coor's Field has a one of a kind brewpub in the
stadium, the Sandlot.  This guys are doing something right because they
took 2 awards, a bronze of their Rightfield Red Ale and a silver for
their Wild Pitch Hefeweizen.


This is by far the best GABF I've attended.  The KROC presentation, the
Brewers Gathering, PPBT judging, and the public sessions were fantastic.
I am already planning for next years week of beer!

         Great American Beer Festival 1995 -- Tasting Notes




Anchor Brewing Co.
Old Foghorn Barleywine
   While only taking the bronze, this years batch was exceptional.  Smooth
   and malty sweet and very mellow.  I had the opportunity to sample it
   (repeatedly) during the judging session and visited Anchor's booth
   religiously.




BBQ Iguana
Bubba's Sour Mash Ale
   Latic sour! This beer seems to be more like an infected beer that's
   beeing passed of as a traditional lambic.  Yucc!




Big Sky Brewing Co.
Moose Drool
   Almost an American Brown in it's bitterness.  Malty and slightly
   sweet.  Finishes dry.




Bitter End Bistro and Brewery
Sledgehammer Stout
   Bitter up front, malty and full bodied.  Finishes dry and malty.




Blue Moon Brewing Co.
White Ale
   Very similar to WIT's Belgian-style white beer.  A good white but no
   one touches Celis!




Broadway Brewing
Road Dog
   Malty sweet and finishes clean and malty sweet.  The label on this
   beer is very soon to become a collectors item (the liquor board is
   not happy).  It seems that Broadway Brewing contracted with Hunter Thompson
   to do the label so you can only imagine, A no shit beer that will get
   you ripped to the tits.




Celis Brewery
Celis White
   The Belgian white to which ALL others are compared.  A gold medal
   winner 3 times (including this year).  Perfection, need I say more.


Celis Grand Cru
   This beer is also fantasitic.  Tradiionally brewed for only special
   occasions it has many of the characteristics of the White only
   stronger.  This years took the silver in the Belgian-style catagory.


Celis Raspberry
   A very nice raspberry fruit beer.  Clean and crisp without the usual
   raspberry tartness.




Chophouse Brewery
Chophouse Mild
   Bitter in the beggining, has a malt character but seems to be a bit
   lactic.


Chophouse Red
    Lager clean taste but malty.  Finishes a litle dry but clean.




Crooked River Brewing Co.
Irish Red
   Clean and crisp.  Nice toasted malt flavor.




Eddie McStiff's
Blueberry Stout
   Not much blueberry in this one but overall a fairly good stout.


Lime Ale
   Has a noticable lime aroma but not much in the flavor.  Clean with
   no bitterness.




Great Basin Brewing Co.
Ichthyosaur Pale Ale
   "Gimme an Icky" is this ones trademark.  A little hoppy and bitter,
   really nothing special.




Great Lakes Brewing Co.
Holy Moses Grand Cru
   Spicy nose but this really has too much corriander.  Clean and malty.




Pacific Coast Brewing Co.
Belgian Tripel
   Nice Belgian-spicy aroma and flavor.  This beer has the Belgian,
   clovey nose .  A VERY nice beer that took the gold in the
   Belgian-style Ales.




Park Slope Brewing Co.
Belgian Style Wit
   Not spiced enough for the style but more like a "lite" Belgian white.
   Too much corriander.




Overall I have to say that Celis was my favorite (I think I visited
their booth at least 8 times).  A very close second goes to Anchor's old
Forghorn (probably 6 times).

Subject: Iodophor containing lanolin




In HBD 1851 both Jeff Renner and Pierre Jelenc mention not using "Udder
Wash" becaue it contains lanolin. I'd like to suggest that *everyone* 
should read the label on the Iodophor they purchase. I have a gal of
something called IodophorII (or is it UdderwashII?) . The directions 
suggest using it as an udderwash. It contains *no* lanolin (would that be
a *sheepish* ale, or 'ewe ale'?). I don't have the container in front of
my right now; however, from memory it contains: Iodine, Phosphoric acid, 
and lots of inert ingredients (probably to keep the correct concentrations
of the Iodine titratable). I've been using it at 15ppm with a 5min contact
time (Thanks Pierre, I believe it was in one of your posts in which I 1st 
read of that 5mins was the required contact duration for sanitation.) for
over a year without problems. (Unless you feel that a faint yellow/brown
tinge to vinyl hoses is a problem. :-) I don't have a problem with the
recommendation not to add lanolin to our sanitaion routines. I just think
that we all should take responsibility for our own procedures.

Subject: Repitching yeast


Hi,


I want to learn how to repitch my yeast from batch to batch.  I don't know
much about this subject.  How do I correctly collect, preserve and repitch
the yeast?  Do I take it from the primary?  How long can I keep yeast alive
inbetween brews?  Should I maintain it as one would maintain a starter
culture (i.e. in an Erlenmeyer flask with an airlock)?  What about feeding
the yeast?  And at what temperatures?


Basically, I don't know much about repitching and want to give it a try.
 Thanks for the advice.  Prost!

In 'Malting and Brewing Science' Volume 1 by Briggs, Hough, Stevens &
Young pp 281, table 9.7 states that the MAXIMAL activity range of
beta-amylase is 60-65C (140-149F).  The same table shows the highest
yield of permanently soluable nitrogen (a proxy for proteins & amino
acids in solution) to be 50-55C (122-131F), tho another table entry
shows the non-amino acid nitrogen to peak yield at 55-60C.  They also
note on pp 291 that "Beta-Amylase is destroyed in mashes in 40-60
minutes at 65C(149F)". Table 9.11 in same shows a constant temperature
mash of 60C at a mash thickness of 39% (approx 41 ounces of water per
pound) or 29%(55oz/lb)  demonstrates slightly higher extraction
efficiency and substantially higher fermentability than constant
temperature mashes at 65.6C or 68.3C and the same thickness. For very
thick mashes of 67%(24 oz/lb) the 60C mash produced poor extraction
efficiency.  Mash times are not given. 


Regarding starch gelatinization, "Malting and Brewing Science", pp
292-293 states, "In mashing it is the liquefying action of
alpha-amylase that is chiefly responsible for the dissolution of the
starch granules, which only begin to gelatinize at about 65C(149F),
but which slowly swell at lower temperatures [55-60C,(130-140F)] and
become progressively more susceptible to enzyme degradation".  A
further explanation indicates that stach in starch/protein complexes
are more susceptible to saccharification if the proteases are allowed
to break down the proteins first.


Dave Miller in "HBofHB" chapter in mashing states the optimal
beta-amylase temp as 140F(60C), but notes that a gelatinization temp
of 149F(65C) prevents complete conversion at this temperature.


George Fix in 'Principles of Brewing Science', pp 95 states, "One rest
is typically in the range of 55 to 60C, which is optimal for amylase
activity. During this rest, 70 to 80% of the starch is converted.  A
second rest in the range of 65 to 70C is use to finish off the starch
conversion at a faster rate".


My personal experiences with 60C rests agree with George Fix's quote
above.  Even after 15 minutes at 60C there is a very substantial
saccharification evident.  I guess I don't see any agreement that 60C
is at the low end of the active range for Beta-amylase, it appears to
be in the maximal activity range according to several reputable
sources.

Subject: Kinney Baughman Takes GABF Medal


Let me be the first to announce that HBD's own Kinney Baughman won a Bronze
Medal on Saturday at the Great American Beer Festival.  Congratulations
Kinney!  The award was for his Belgian Amber Framboise, hmm, but I can't
remember the category - maybe Belgian Specialty Ales.  It was a shock to him
because his Belgian Black Framboise was the one he considered a better beer.
I tasted both and I agreed with him, but they were both very interesting
beers, and very well made - wow!


I don't know if this is a first or not.  I know many HBDers take home awards
for homebrewed beers, but this is the first I've seen in the commercial
ranks, at least on this scale.  Are there any other commercial-prize-winning
brewers among us?


Cheers,
Norm

        Do it all the time.  Just put it into your regular compost box.
I already had one of these.  I just throw the grains into the box,
even when there hot.  If you have a small box, you may want to let the
stuff cool a bit.  Makes wonderful compost.  If you don't have a box,
and are starting from scratch, you may want to read up on composting.

Subject:       Great Bottling Experience


Thanks to everyone who has ever written anything in HBD.
By searching back issues and following certain threads, I found
some great techniques that I'd like to share briefly.  


My previous bottling evenings were more laborious and messy-
I rinsed bleach water from bottles one by one, inverted in paper towel 
lined case to drain, and filled with a siphon.


Two days ago I bottled easily and in much less time.  After soaking
bottles in bleach water, I loaded them in my dishwasher with no soap
(about 56 bottles). This ran through a cycle, ending with heated drying.
After preparing/adding  priming sugar to bucket, I opened  the 
now-cool dishwasher and set my newly-made priming bucket full of 
beer on the counter above the dishwasher.  To the spigot I attached
tubing and a bottle filler (wand type).  Then it was an easy task to reach 
in, retrieve a bottle, set it right side up on horizontal dishwasher door,
fill, place bottle on counter, where another person capped it.  After a 
few I realized I could even pull the rack out slightly and use the 
now-empty silverware holder to hold the upright bottle - one-handed 
filling! I even got ahead of the capper and was asked to slow down. 
And what about clean-up? Just  close the dishwasher door and all drips 
stay inside, to be washed away when the next load of dirty dishes is run. 
No mess on the floor whatsoever!


Thanks to everyone who answered my post about vanilla flavoring
in beer, I should be trying something inventive next wekend.

I am forever grateful to George Hummel of Philly's Home Sweet Homebrew for 
turning me on to using 'whippets' for carbonating 5L kegs of stout. They are 
unbelievably creamy and way better than bottle conditioned. Head retention is 
NOT a problem.

Subject: Hops/Pale Recipe


Hey All,


I've been trying to develop some house recipes.  Wyeast 1056
has been my yeast of choice for this task, because of its
clean nature.  In an attempt to isolate the malt portion of
the recipes, I've been sticking with strictly East Kent
Goldings hops for bittering and Cascade or Goldings for
aroma/flavor.  Now that I feel like I'm getting a handle on
the grain, I'm interested in exploring different hops
to add a more distinctive personal touch to my recipes.


I've been considering moving to high alpha bittering hops
and was curious to hear about other brewers' experience with
Eroica, Chinook, Cluster, and Centennial.  I've also been
wanting to inject some liveliness and spicey character in my
flavor/aroma hops and was wondering about using Saaz,
Centennial, Styrian Goldings, or Willamette for finishing
English and American style ales.  Any experiences or
recomendations would be greatly appreciated.
- ------------------------------------------------------------
In return for any kind info, here's my latest effort at
American Pale Ale, which also happens to be as close as I've
come to cloning Bell's Pale Ale.  However, I make no claims as the 
authenticity of the recipe against Bell's.  


Lucky 8 Pale Ale
     Grain:    8.0 lbs DWC Belgian pale malt
               1.0 lbs Hugh Baird 50 L crystal malt
               0.5 lbs Briess 10L Munich malt
               0.5 lbs Briess wheat malt
     Mash:     1.2 qts/lb (pre-boiled to remove carbonate, 1 tsp gypsum)
                   90 min `at` 68 C
                   10 min `at` 76 C
     Lauter:   Recirculate until clear
               5.0 gallon sparge (pre-boiled, 1 tbsp gypsum)
     Boil:     90 min total
       Hops:   2.00 oz. East Kent Goldings pellets, 80 min
               1.00 oz. East Kent Goldings pellets, 10 min
               1.00 oz. Cascade pellets, steep during chill
               (28.9 IBU by SUDS)
       1 tsp rehydrated IM, 15 min
     Chill to 17 C
     Aerate with aquarium pump system
     Pitch 1056 yeastcake from secondary of previous batch
           (about 300 mls slurry)
     10 day primary ferment
     Keg: rack to keg (in the English tradition)
          fine w/ 1/2 packet sanitized gelatin finings
          dry-hop w/ 1.00 oz. Cascade pellets in nylon
          force carbonate (NOT in the English tradition)


 A full pound of British crystal malt adds a distinct malty
sweetness.  The Munich malt seems to contribute a rich,
creamy malt texture.  Traditional English Goldings offer a
smooth bitterness and Cascades contribute that classic
American floral/citrusy aroma.  Drink and Enjoy!

Mark (mtruhe`at`ucdavis.edu) asked about molasses in beer.  I thought I'd pass
my thoughts on to all of you.  I just kegged a homebrew copy of Old Peculier,
in which I used black treacle and demorara sugar.  If these sugars are
foreign to you, treacle is basically a "high-grade" molasses while demorara
sugar is a minimally-refined granular sugar, not quite like brown sugar, but
more like "sugar-in-the-raw" (turbinado).  I used a pound of demorara and
about 4-5 ounces (about 1/4 to 1/3 of a 1-lb can) of treacle.  I must pat
myself on the back.  It tastes pretty authentic!!  The point not being to
stroke my own ego (OK maybe a little) but to illustrate the effect that this
level of such sugars has on the beer.  If you are not familiar with Old
Peculier, try to get some and have a taste.  That molasses-like or
brown-sugar-like taste in the background is quite close to the resulting
flavor in my version.  If it's to your liking, go with the numbers I used.
 If you substitute regular brown sugar for the demorara, cut back a bit on
the treacle -- the molasses in the brown sugar will "overlap" probably too
much.  The difference between molasses and treacle is probably slight
although I understand molasses might be a bit "harsher".


I haven't had a chance yet to do a true A/B comparison with the Real Thing,
so some recipe tweaking may be necessary, but here's what I used for my brew:


Pale Ale malt
1/2 lb roasted barley
1/2 lb black malt
Note about malts:
  If mashing use adequate pale 
  malt for a 1.032 gravity.  If using
  extract use about 4 lb pale extract
  and steep the grains until water
  is 170F.
4-5 oz treacle (add late in boil to preserve aroma)
1 lb demorara sugar
2 oz lactose (adds residual sweetness)
1.5 oz Fuggles, 45 minutes
No finishing hops
Wyeast British liquid

I have been looking for a company that manufactures an all-grain homebrew
gravity feed system.  I don't have all the time or effort required to build a
system from scratch.


Does anyone out there have any experience with the systems manufactured by:
Precision Brewing Systems ( wholesale division of East Coast Brewing Supply) of
Staten Island, New York.


It appears from there catalog that they use quality parts and they have a very
high opinion of the company's craftsmanship.  However, I would like the opinions
of real-life homebrewers and not there marketing department.
TIA   - private e-mail OK
