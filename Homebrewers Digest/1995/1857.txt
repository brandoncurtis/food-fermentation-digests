Subject:      Elephant Red, airstones


Yesterday I noticed a new beer in our local store - Elephant Red.  The
side label is what intrigued me - The beer is imported by A-B from Canada
where it is brewed by Labatt's under the supervision of Carlsborg.  WHat
is this stuff, and why such a strange business arrangement?  In the store
it was positioned with the other A-B products, and the alcohol content
was prominently posted on the label (5.7% or so) in the manner of ice
beers.
beers.  Is this just another move by the big guys to hog all the shelf space
in the stores?


   Like several recent posters I too get frustrated by froth when using
airstones on 5-gal batches of wort in 5 or 6.5 gal carboys.  I also use
an immersion chiller to cool the wort in a 10-gal brewpot.  Is there any
compelling reason not to use the airstone in the brewpot after the wort
has been chilled and before transfer to the carboy?  Head space problems
would be eliminated this way, but would it create other problems?  Like what?
You know, "aerated cold break causes SS to leach out cadmium, lead and mercury"
, "trub won't settle if its oxygenated", that sort of thing.

Subject:       Vanilla Summary / Wort Chiller


Thanks to all who responded to my query about vanilla
flavoring.  Here is a summary of the answers I got........


In stout, 3 or 4 drops added per bottle before capping was good.
Vanilla should be good with toasty flavors like stout or porter.
In porter, tried 2 beans cut lengthwise, not enough!
Added vanilla to Papazian's Rocky Raccoon Crystal Honey 
            Lager - very good.
Vanilla might be good in brown ale or English ale.
Vanilla is good in Christmas Spiced Ale.
Add vanilla in secondary or at bottling.  Volatile oils don't do
            well if boiled,  also don't do well in primary.


And so, in spite of all conventional wisdom, I brewed a pale ale
last night and I intend to add 3 or 4 vanilla beans to secondary.
At bottling I can decide if drops are needed depending on aroma
and taste.  I'll let you know how it goes.


Also last night I built and used an immersion chiller. Many thanks
to Kenneth Goodrow's most excellent plans, as posted here recently.
BTW, after much pondering and searching the hardware store for
a fitting that would connect the plastic tubing to the faucet, an idea
hit me.  I bought a simple 3/8 to 1/2 connector.  At home I slid the 3/8
end into the 3/8 ID hose and clamped it.  Then I took a large knife
outside and performed a 3-feet-length-ectomy at the faucet end of a
leaky garden hose (we were planning to buy a new hose anyway).
I brought my length of hose inside and clamped the 'cut' end to the
1/2" side of the connector.  The 'screw-on' end of the green hose 
easily screws on to a garden hose faucet adaptor, which is easily 
found at the store if you don't have one. 
I still can't believe that I cooled my boiling wort down in 20 minutes!


Cheers,
Herb

I bought the BruProbe and I like it a lot.  I went to an electronics store
and got a 
female plug to go on the plug on the BruProbe.  Then I just wired two leads
to a 
9V battery connector and 2 leads to RCA plugs to go into a digital
multimeter that 
I had.  I just read out volts on the multimeter which corresponds to
temperature.


Using the BruProbe is another matter.  Since it is so sensitive and the
readout is 
so precise, you start to wonder whether you want the top of the mash to be
at your 
temperature goal, the bottom of the mash or what.  I mash in a converted pony 
keg, so the bottom of the keg gets very hot from the burner, and thus continues 
to heat the mash after the burner is off.  A lot of stirring, of course,
helps even 
out the temperature, but that gets to be a PITA.  I wonder how people claim to 
get mash temps of 157F and know they are not at 156 or 159?  I believe someone
posted something like this earlier this week.


My second question is whether anyone has experience with the Austrailian ale
yeast from Yeast labs (I think).  Some members of my club professed great
results with this yeast, and remarked that it seemed to ferment out in three
days.  I've been using it the last few batches, the last two of which I
pitched on
the dregs of the secondary.  While fermentation did seem to be complete in
about three days, SG measurements indicated that fermentation continued
slowly over the next week or so.  I bottled when the FG got to about 12.  I
notice now that most of my bottles are overcarbonated.  Seems like this
yeast keeps going slowly for quite a while.  I'm going back to Wyeast.  Any 
comments?

Warning: Beer-related, but not homebrewing-related|  Just trying to
spread a little information....


A tiny item in the bottom corner of the front of the business section
(Milwaukee Journalsentinel) notes that Dutch giant Heineken has acquired
a 66% stake in Zlaty Bazant, a brewery in the Slovak Republic.


As a matter of international concern, this may not be anything on the
scale of Anheuser-Busch's attempt to swallow up Budvar, but I'm wondering
if any of you knows anything about the brewery and its beer.  How about
some of you folks who had the luxury of making beer trips to Central/Eastern
Europe this summer?  (And, more importantly, does Roger Baylor know
about this? :-) )

And now on to a more beer related note. I had the opportunity to 
induct several club members into the GABF ritual this year. It was 
excellent as usual. Watching them walk around wide-eyed and confused 
was even better. Did anybody think the winners of the medals this 
year, were off a bit( not entirely). Some of the golds seemed 
entirely average while the categories that had no gold medals...I 
found several. Difference of taste can account for some variance. I 
discussed it with my club members and they seemed to agree.
I don't know, but it would be interesting to hear some other 
reactions.

Subject:  Re: Aluminum Brew Pots


There have been two worries about using aluminum pots for brewing.  1) 
Possible metallic tastes from the aluminum.  2) Concern about dietary 
aluminum being unhealthful.


I wouldn't worry about either of these with a decent quality aluminum pot 
that is well cared for.  Treat it the way you would for cooking.  For 
instance, there is a reason it has a dull finish on the inside--don't remove
that coating to make the pot shiny!  The oxide coating (or whatever is used 
on your pot) helps keep the aluminum on the pot and out of your food/wort. 
I have definitely tasted the metallic aluminum when cooking spaghetti sauce 
for a couple of hours in a freshly scrubbed, shiny aluminum pot--neither of
us knew any better at the time.  


If you have *any* worries, I would simmer spaghetti sauce in there for a 
couple of hours--if any aluminum is capable of leaching in there, you will 
definitely taste it.  If the sauce tastes non-metallic, you can use it for 
your wort without worries.

Everytime you rack, you risk infection and oxidization.  If you want to 
"rouse" the yeast (not arouse, you perverts), just swish the carboy around
a bit.  Also, if you're going to add more yeast, why not just add it to the
secondary?

It's not sick, lots of good beers do on that.  Just do the things they tell 
you to avoid to prevent diacetyl.  (I forget what that is, though...)

Something went wrong with my post about Broadway Brewing: the _correction_
showed up in 1855, but not the original post sent immediately before it.
Here it is again, with the correction included.  (Now that the other post
in 1855 confirms that the brewery is indeed B'way Br., I've deleted a
disclaimer that I might not have heard the brewery name correctly, and
deleted some other text as well.)


D.J. Glantz <djgst7+`at`pitt.edu> asks about Broadway Brewing in Colorado:


I can't tell you very much about the beer, but I can share something I
heard on "As it Happens" last Friday.  Apparently, they ran into a little
trouble with the Colorado authorities over the label.  No, they didn't
commit the crime of providing nutritional information, as did Mr. Grant;
'twas far worse: apparently someone was upset about the following words
on the label: "Good Beer, No Shit!"  Something about references to excretory
functions being inappropriate.


Did anyone else hear that interview?
Maybe they could provide some additional information: aih`at`toronto.cbc.ca


It doesn't tell you a lot about the brewery, but it is an amusing anecdote
(or it would be if it weren't so sad to see a brewer being harassed) and it
was an opportunity for craft brewing to get on the airwaves.

   I have another question maybe someone could help me with.  I brew my first
all-grain batch a couple of weeks ago and used Saaz hops in it.  Just exactly
how SPICY is Saaz suppose to be?  I used it as a finishing hop.  And it came

Subject: Bavarian Weizen


My favorite beer style is a (southern Bavarian) Weizen.  When living in 
Germany (90-92'), I slowly fell in love with this style.  I have used
several different Weizen strains from yeast sources and streaked from 
bottles and still haven't decided what is the best strain for a really 
good BAVARIAN styled weizen. In Germany: Maisels, Erdinger, Schnieder,
Paulaner, ect the list goed on for local Bavarian GOOD Weizens.  In the 
states I like; Paulaner, Ayinger, Weinstepen and Erdinger.  It largely
depends on how old the batch was and how it was handled (if only 
alll retailers and distributors would realize this, they'd sell a lot 
more beer, fresh is good)


So..... what I am asking is one and all Weizen lovers. PLEASE let me know
your opinion and suggestions to brew a great Southern Bavarian Weizen Bier.
(All grain, 40/60 Barley Wheat??)(If you reply pls. also send to me directly)
I also enjoy Theo DeGroens Weizen `at` Baltimore Brewing Co.  His Weizen 
Bock was great!!!


Thanx to any and all lovers Liquid Bread!

My experience at sacch rest temps is that my burner has to be fired
for about 60s every 9-10 minutes to maintain within a 1F deadband.


Gerald Wirtz asked about his low yield and sparging:


> I think that I should have left the spigot only open so a trickle
> come out.  And also kept the water level above the grain bed.


I've found this to be true--try to maintain efflux and influx at the
same rate and try to maintain some grain bed cover.  Batch sparging
by draining the tank then filling with water seriously reduces the
extraction.  I have not found any important effects of letting the
water go below the grain bed surface, though, but still try to keep
a cover.  He also asked:


> Does 'cleared' mean clear like water or clear you can see thru?


Clear like a colored glass: having color but little turgidity due
to suspended particles.  Again, this is really nice to have but
I have seen no correlation between the clarity of the wort going
into the kettle and the ability of the beer to clear in the conditioning
tank (or secondary).  It may effect astringency, however.

     --------------------------------------------------
     I have been on a one person campaign for several months 
     now to get the LA Times to devote as much space for 
     beer as they do for wine.  I have written, faxed, and 
     phoned, but just one person's interest is not going to 
     get the attention of the LA Times.  I have even 
     provided them with written material they could print, 
     however they have not been responsive to me.  But, if 
     they get enough cards, letters, calls, faxes, etc. 
     perhaps they will realize that there is just as many, 
     maybe more out there that would like to read about 
     beer.  A column that talked about beer could cover a 
     wide range of topics and still be of interest to all 
     readers, not just homebrewers.  For example they could 
     cover a different style each week and not run out of 
     topics.  Not to mention all the new brew pubs oppening 
     up. 
     
     They have a regular wine column and is beer not 
     consumed by more people than wine?  Does it not deserve

     the beer drinkers in their audience.  If you agree

the warning should be made anyway. Anyone know anyhing more on this subject?
I for one would be REAL curious to know the level of danger present because
there is all kinds of Sassafras down in Carbondale, and I was very

some. 


On another note, I was paging thru a woodworking catalog today and ran
across the following: Router speed controls--Control the speed of your
router bit with the twist of a dial; works with any AC/DC universal motor;
can be used on drills, routers, grinders...110VAC/15Amp=$29.95;
110VAC/20Amp=$34.95; 220VAC/20Amp=$39.95. This is from a Trend-Lines catalog
1-800-767-9999. 


I've seen these things advertised before, and never gave them much thought
since my big router is already variable speed, but for controlling a pump
in a RIMS, they might be ideal. Anyone had any experience? When I get back
to Carbondale, I'll check some catalogs and post a list of suppliers (Don't
hold your breath, I'll be in Chicago until at least 7 Nov).

  I also use an immersion chiller, and brew 10 gallon batches. I've done the
same two things with my chiller, there's one more thing you might want to
try: take some more 8-gauge copper, wrap one end around the uppermost coil,
then loop it through the top 6-8 coils, such that they are "bunched up" at
the top of the chiller. Concentrating more of the cooling surface at the top
of the chiller where the wort is hottest helps achieve fast chilling times.


Chuck also writes:

I bought one of these about 2 years ago, it's every bit as flimsy looking

a lot sturdier than it looks. At $7.50, the price is right, it'd be tough to

  Drop the yeast out of suspension early, ie, near the end of primary.
Diacetyl is a natural by-product of fermentation, produced in the early
stages. Later, when most of the fermentables have been consumed, the yeast
will begin to reduce the diacetyl, assuming proper fermentation temperatures
are maintained.
  As a beginning brewer, I got into brewing beers with crystal clarity. My
standard procedure was to rack from primary about day 7 or so, just when the
krausen was falling, and then add polyclar to the secondary. Racking left
some yeast behind in primary, the polyclar dropped whatever yeast that was
carried into the secondary out of suspension, at a point in the fermentation
where diacetyl reduction would just be starting.
  I must warn you, this method will produce a *lot* of diacetyl. You might
want to try a yeast strain that leaves some diacetyl, ie, Wyeast 1084 or
1968 first.

I use the same setup with the same foamy results.  I am experimenting (so 
far successfully after 3-4 batches) with forming a cone/funnel around the 
neck of the carboy using a piece of aluminum foil.  Crimp it tight around 
the outside if the neck and form it upwards in a funnel.  As the foam 
comes out of the carboy, it collects in the funnel and I can periodically 
scoop it up with my "cleaned and sanitized" hands.  Seems to be no 
problem with infecting the wort because the foam doesn't "fall back" into 
the wort.  When done, I can simply remove the foil and toss it. When I am 
feeling particularly sanitize-crazed, I drop the foil into iodophor 
before making the funnel.  Using this, I can aerate for 30 mins before 
and after pitching.  Note I haven't given much thought to whether the 
post-pitching aeration will carry some of the pitched yeast out of the 
carboy....

how to use my lemon balm, and even better, how to make a lemon ale.
(So if your kids sip this, you call it lemonade?)


"Lemon balm is indeed part of the mint family.  It gives more scent than
lemon flavor.  You may want to try it in combination with other lemon
scented herbs.  I use lemon grass root a lot in my meads.  At higher
levels it gives a very nice taste.  There is also lemon sage, lemon thyme
(very strong lemon/herb flavor) lemon verbena, and a true mint called
grapefruit mint (but is more just citrusy).  Do not use any of the lemon
scented pelergoniums (formerly geranium).  These smell wonderful but
taste very odd.  The flowers contain almost no taste or smell.  They are
edible but useless if not harmful to a brew.  Also to watch out for when
using any of the mints is that they are natural disinfectants.  They will
kill yeast in high levels.  Oh, also, do not try lemon Eucalyptus.  Bad
stuff for brews.  Great for colds, but kills yeast and too much strong
(menthalatum sort of smell) extracted.  Well, hope this helps -- D. Thomas


When I said I'd probably try lemon balm by itself to see what it would do
(and 'cause that's what the garden grew), doing  'dry balming' by adding it
to a fermented pale brew, Douglas Thomas added,


 "Try "dry" lemon balm in one batch and then if you like what that did,
maybe make a tea of it and put that in the secondary.  That way, maybe
more flavor will be released.  Just an idea.  If you are interested in
more info about the medicinal properties of Lemon Balm check out the Herb
Book by John Lust, or the recently published color edition of Culpeppers
Herbal.  Both are good stuff."

Al - this certainly wasn't a 'blast'.  You posted a statement that
appeared questionable.  I simply posted an alternative point of
view including personal experience and published material.  I am
appreciative of your many fine posts, I just think that your statement
above required some further explanation.


In quoting the various published sources I purposely included relevant
information regardless of apparent discrepancies, (which I believe are
fairly minor) -  I'm looking for a good discussion of the issue - I'm
emphatically NOT trying to bash you - no impoliteness intended.

As a practical matter, when I brew dry ale styles using a 40-60-70
mash schedule (a la G.Fix) I do get most of my saccharification at 60C;
tho' it does require an extended period of time (1 to 1.5 hour rest).
The tables from Malting and Brewing Science mentioned in my original
post indicate a drop in fermentabilty from around (sorry - I don't
have the text in front of me today) 76% to around 67% as the mash
temperature rises from 60C to 68C.  This is a substantial drop and is
of practical concern.  The amounts of the various sugars as well as
nitrogen (soluable protein and amino acids) is also substantially
effected over this temperature range.


I agree that 60C is near the lower end of the practical saccharification
range, but I might consider using an even lower temperature if I had a
large adjunct load and wanted to insure maximum effectiveness of the
beta-amylase available.


I'm not overly enamoured of the higher amylase activity at 65C as a
homebrewer.  A-B may be in a hurry when they brew; I can afford the
extra 30 minutes.  A homebrewer's greater difficulty is in controlling
the process. I suspect that by timing a primarily beta-amylase rest
and a primarily alpha-amylase rest that I can achieve tighter control
and greater reproducability of recipes. The alternative is to choose an
intermediate temperature which results in the correct balance of alpha
& beta amylase activities (like your 65C).  Controlling mash results by
this fine temperature control is relatively difficult.  By the way, I
am not a religious advocate of 60C and 70C as the correct mash
temperature steps, and can easily see arguments that perhaps figures
like 62C and 68C would be better choices.


So why not mash at 65C ?  Quicker denaturing of enzymes and production
of less fermentable wort are the issues.  When a highly fermentable
wort is desired or adjuncts dilute the available beta-amylase, then
the lower temperature is certainly called for.  Step mashing for the
two amylases may offer better process control as well.

Enzyme activities ARE complex. One of the discussions in M&B Science
brings up the fact that the many different enzymes (yes there are a
lot more than alpha- and beta- amylase and protease) can work
synergistically. One example previously mentioned is the breakdown of
protein/starch complexes by proteolytic enzymes which makes starch
granules accessible by beta-amylase at sub-gelatinizing temperatures.


An interesting graph in M&B Sci also shows production of fermentable
sugars from a solution of flour, which has little or no enzymes
itself, with addition of several different ratios of alpha- and beta-
amylase as a function of temperature.  This graph indicates a roughly
three-fold decrease in fermentable product as the temperature rises
from 60C to 63C !!  Thankfully mashing an all-grain wort is a much
more forgiving process than this.  One problem in reaching an
understanding of activity of enzymes in mash is clearly that there are
complex interactions that won't admit a simple decompostion.


On the subject of protein degradation, there are many different
proteolytic enzymes - each of which undoubtedly have optimal 
temperature,  pH and mash thickness environments. The tables of
optimal temperature (and pH) ranges for various activities from M&B
Science indicate that 50-55C is better for producing soluable protein
(for head, body and haze), while 55-60C temperatures preferentially
degrade proteins into amino acids (yeast/human nutrient).  So
modulating the temperature of your protein rest should impact the
protein/amino acid ratio of the resulting wort.  Fix and
other(Narziss?) suggest a quick step from 40C to 60C, but I'm tempted
to try a rest at 50-55C.

In another post in this HBD I (may) have incorrectly stated a
relationship for protein degradation.  The relation for mash
temperature is:
50-55C for maximal soluable protein AND amino acid production
55-60C for maximal production of non-amino acid soluable protein.

homebreweryland has reinvented and argued about for years.
Its not called "RIMS" or Incremental Decoction etc,
It is the "Melle-Boinot" process, and no, it's not patented! This is a 
commercially available system for mash and fermentation temperature control.
I think someone is writing a book on "RIMS", they might research this process. 
It will save a lot of time on discovering technical data.
