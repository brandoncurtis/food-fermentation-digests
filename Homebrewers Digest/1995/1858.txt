Subject: 60c rests


Hello.


I don't think this should get into a long, drawn out argument, but I
personally always use a 60C rest for all my beers, and I think it works very
well as an aid to obtaining optimum balance for the particular style you are
making. I first got the idea from George Fix's posts from August last year
(although it is obviously a well established technique judging by Steve's post).


Suppose you want a dry beer (as I do because my beers used to be too sweet -
I guess I just don't know what I am doing!)


A 65C rest may well be the optimum (if you want dryness) for a single temp.
infusion system, on the balance of fermentability to extract yield. However,
I find this very difficult to hit accurately, for a few reasons:


 - I don't trust my thermometer (when did you last calibrate yours?)
 - I think it is difficult to add the correct amount of water to hit an
accurate target temperature in an infusion system (unless you are very
experienced)
 - unless you stir the **** out of it, you will get temperature differentials
all over the place (and just where did you read that thermometer again?)
 - unless you use a cooler system, you lose a lot of heat and the temp is not
easily maintainable for more than about 15 min.


The target temp in a single temp infusion is very important. Too low and you
will not get a decent extract; too high and you get sweet beer.


Solution?
Use a 60C rest in a step infusion system and raise to 70C after X minutes!


The problems above are not as important this way.


eg. single infusion at 67C desired. It is very easy to be *at least +/-2C*
(I'd suggest more) over the mash due to the above factors. This has a huge
effect on the outcome. ie. it is not very predictable.


60C +/-2 will still give a fermentable beer. Errors of +/-2C are not very
important. You will not get full conversion at this temp (about 75% Steve?),
but this is solved by raising to 70C afterwards. You can balance the dextrin
fraction easily by varying the amount of time at 60C. 15 min at 70C is ample
in my experience to complete conversion in any case, so the time at 60C is
critical to the final outcome.
(Fosters Special Bitter in Australia has a single temp infusion at 70C for
just 7 minutes to complete conversion: makes it cheap to make. add heaps of
sugar and it makes it fermentable)


eg.
(below are for full malt beers)
15 min at 60C => malty/sweet
30 min at 60C => balanced
45 min at 60C => dry
>45 min => thin


This is not an absolute guide, and you have to adapt it to individual's
setup and style. One advantage is you can keep the pot on the stove (check
temp every 15 min). This can be used for *any* style, although some may
benefit from 40C or 50C rests as well (I usually include a 40C beta glucan
rest with the malts we get here)


I believe many commercial brweries use a similar system.
eg. Hahn Premium (100% all malt Australian micro-brewed lager: NZ Super
Alpha hop)
40 min at 60C
15 min at 70C
(these are from brewers' mouths)
result? 
clean, dryish, malty lager (according to one of the brewers - "Would be the
best beer in the world if they used Saaz for finish hopping". Current
Brewmeister Chuck Hahn has achieved this award with NZ Steinlager before.)


Commercial brewers do not use the 60C step for protein rests, just for final
sweetness, malt balance (ie. they filter it anyway), although I must say I
get clear beer with this technique, without filtration (draw your own
conclusions).


Come on, you ESB lurkers! I know you do this too!
Where are you?


Andy Walsh.


PS. Congrats Kinney!

bpc 13oct:


The root beer extract that I made recently had two sets of instructions - one 
with all sugar, and one with only a cup per 5 gal for cabonation, and then add 
artificial sweetener to taste.  Most of the sugar should ferment out, leaving a 
low sugar soda.


hope this helps.

Subject: Betas/DMS/weighing


Just kegged another version of an IPA Im doing some pilot brewing of.
The first one was 14.9P and finished at 3.3P, had about 5% Munich and
a lot of CaraMunich and a touch of CaraPils.  Mash at 150-148F for one
hour, mash off at 170F, lauter 170.  ADA=78%, American Ale yeast.


Batch 2: same specialties, used Hugh Baird as base instead of DeWolf.
Doughed in at 149F and quickly adjusted with cold water to 145F.  This
dropped to 140F over 35 minutes and then was boosted with direct fire to
148F for 20 min, then 170F, lauter.  Same yeast.  OG=15.9P, FG=3.1P.
ADA=80.5%.


This shows that the beta amylase rest will have some impact on real degree
of fermentability, but the overall percentage in this example is only
2.5%.  It is very close to my target, and next time Ill try to dough in
closer to 142F, since I want a well attenuated IPA and there is enough
caramel/munich malts in this recipe to provide body/mouthfeel.


Al writes about DMS:


<While I'm at it, I might as well add that I'm well aware that the
<higher levels of SMM in the paler lager malts are the main (maybe
<the only) source of DMS in lagers.  The lack of DMS in Munich Dunkels
<is one possible argument to the contrary, but not a definitive one.


I think part of the reason for this might be the use of Munich malts
in high percentages in the grist of a Dunkle, but this surely varies
a lot in each brewery.  Malts that are kilned more have more precursors,
which is one of the reasons that Pale ale malt is near impossible to 
generate DMS beer.  As I suggested to Pat, the use of European Vienna
malts might be a good idea when aiming to minimize DMS production. Its
also interesting to note that a lot of German brewers use a dark coloring
syrup to make a dunkle beer, the syrup is basically a malt extract and
thus adheres to Reinheithsgebot.  I know a recent gold medal winner at 
the GABF was made with this stuff for coloring.


Rick asks:


<I've just made a paddle for stirring my mash and brew out of
<maple. Should I put a finish on it like polyurathane or clear
<epoxy, or leave it unfinished?


Mine is red oak and it is unfinished, I dont think you need to.


Barry asks about scales:


<What type of SCALES do people out there use to weigh out grains.


What I do is calibrate a measuring vessal, of late it has been a 2 Qt
plastic pitcher.  I level fill it with each of my most used grains,
then weigh the results.  Then I just use this as a "yardstick" and 
multiply how many pitchers of grain I need for a given recipe.  Works 
fine for me.  Sometimes you want high accuracy for less than full pitcher
volumes and in this case you can just weigh the remainder or calibrate
a smaller unit measure. You need to calibrate the vessal for each grain
type and crop as it will vary quite a bit from malt to malt and even
from year to year (kilning and moisture levels vary as does kernel size).
You need a good hop scale anyway, so a small capacity scale is a requirement. 
If I were to purcase a new scale, Id buy a digital Ohaus with auto-tar 
feature. Very handy but they run about $200.


Good brewing,

Subject: If Operating Systems Were Beers


     Fellow Homebrewers, 
     
     Happy Friday the 13th!  The following was forwarded to me by Gabriel 
     Goldberg, Computers and Publishing, Inc. (gabe`at`cpcug.org).  He gets 
     credit for the VM Beer, which he appended to the original (which 
     arrived completely unattributed). If anyone knows whom to credit for 
     the rest of this wonderful passage, pls post.  This you will like :-)
     
     If Operating Systems Were Beers...
     
     DOS Beer:
     
     Requires you to use your own can opener, and requires you to read the 
     directions carefully before opening the can. Originally only came in 
     an 8-oz. can, but now comes in a 16-oz. can. However, the can is 
     divided into 8 compartments of 2 oz. each, which have to be accessed 
     separately. Soon to be discontinued, although a lot of people are 
     going to keep drinking it after it's no longer available.
     
     
     Mac Beer:
     
     At first, came only a 16-oz. can, but now comes in a 32-oz. can. 
     Considered by many to be a "light" beer. All the cans look identical. 
     When you take one from the fridge, it opens itself. The ingredients 
     list is not on the can. If you call to ask about the ingredients, you 
     are told that "you don't need to know." A notice on the side reminds 
     you to drag your empties to the trashcan.
     
     
     Windows 3.1 Beer:
     
     The world's most popular. Comes in a 16-oz. can that looks a lot like 
     Mac Beer's. Requires that you already own a DOS Beer. Claims that it 
     allows you to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously, but in reality 
     you can only drink a few of them, very slowly, especially slowly if 
     you are drinking the Windows Beer at the same time. Sometimes, for 
     apparently no reason, a can of Windows Beer will explode when you open 
     it.
     
     
     OS/2 Beer:
     
     Comes in a 32-oz can. Does allow you to drink several DOS Beers 
     simultaneously. Allows you to drink Windows 3.1 Beer simultaneously 
     too, but somewhat slower. Advertises that its cans won't explode when 
     you open them, even if you shake them up. You never really see anyone 
     drinking OS/2 Beer, but the manufacturer (International Beer 
     Manufacturing) claims that 9 million six-packs have been sold.
     
     
     Windows 95 Beer:
     
     You can't buy it yet, but a lot of people have taste-tested it and 
     claim it's wonderful. The can looks a lot like Mac Beer's can, but 
     tastes more like Windows 3.1 Beer. It comes in 32-oz. cans, but when 
     you look inside, the cans only have 16 oz. of beer in them. Most 
     people will probably keep drinking Windows 3.1 Beer until their 
     friends try Windows 95 Beer and say they like it. The ingredients 
     list, when you look at the small print, has some of the same 
     ingredients that come in DOS beer, even though the manufacturer claims 
     that this is an entirely new brew.
     
     
     Windows NT Beer:
     
     Comes in 32-oz. cans, but you can only buy it by the truckload. This 
     causes most people to have to go out and buy bigger refrigerators.  
     The can looks just like Windows 3.1 Beer's, but the company promises 
     to change the can to look just like Windows 95 Beer's - after Windows 
     95 beer starts shipping. Touted as an "industrial strength" beer, and 
     suggested only for use in bars.
     
     
     Unix Beer:
     
     Comes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8 oz. to 64 
     oz. Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even though 
     they claim that all the different brands taste almost identical. 
     Sometimes the pop-tops break off when you try to open them, so you 
     have to have your own can opener around for those occasions, in which 
     case you either need a complete set of instructions, or a friend who 
     has been drinking Unix Beer for several years.
     
     
     AmigaDOS Beer:
     
     The company has gone out of business, but their recipe has been picked 
     up by some weird German company, so now this beer will be an import. 
     This beer never really sold very well because the original 
     manufacturer didn't understand marketing. Like Unix Beer, AmigaDOS 
     Beer fans are an extremely loyal and loud group. It originally came in 
     a 16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz. cans too. When this can was 
     originally introduced, it appeared flashy and colorful, but the design 
     hasn't changed much over the years, so it appears dated now. Critics 
     of this beer claim that it is only meant for watching TV anyway.
     
     
     VMS Beer:
     
     Requires minimal user interaction, except for popping the top and 
     sipping.  However cans have been known on occasion to explode, or 
     contain extremely un-beer-like contents.  Best drunk in high pressure 
     development environments.  When you call the manufacturer for the list 
     of ingredients, you're told that is proprietary and referred to an 
     unknown listing in the manuals published by the FDA.  Rumors are that 
     this was once listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference as a 
     tranquilizer, but no one can claim to have actually seen it.
     
     
     The biggest problem is before you can drink any one of them you have 
     to buy a really expensive bag of chips to go with it.
     
     
     VM Beer
     
     Originally (1972) marketed in 24-oz. cans, was repositioned in 1990 as 
     "Enterprise Beer for the 1990s" with 31-oz. cans.  The missing ounce 
     never mattered, because one can of VM beer could have the same effect 
     as dozens, hundreds, or thousands of cans, at minimal increased cost, 
     and without a corresponding increase in wastewater or solid waste.  
     Though VM beer suffered from neglect by its brewer (International Beer 
     Manufacturing), it can now be produced in industrial quantities by the 
     economical "homebrew" kit, BC (BeerCan) Server 500 System/390.

Subject: Re: Bronze Ball Valves


Jack Dickerson wondered whether Bronze (as opposed to Brass) ball valves are
safe to use in brewing equipment.


Yes.
Brass and Bronze are primarily copper and are safe for drinking water usage.
Some alloys contain a small percentage of lead to aid machining and these may
be soaked in a 2:1 vol:vol solution of white distilled vinegar and hydrogen
peroxide (common grocery store varieties) for 15 minutes to dissolve off any
surface lead. The metal will turn a buttery gold color when its done. If the
solution turns green, it means its past done and you are starting to dissolve
copper.

I made an inexpensive and accurate grain scale to use in my homebrewery.
It is the old Balance type scale, a suspended rod with a bucket on one side and
lead weights on the other.

accuracy on the gram balance here at the Lab, but could also have taken them to
a grocery store to weigh on their certified scales.  To use the grain balance,
its just a matter of measuring carefully to set the distances, add the
appropriate amount of lead weight to the moment arm and add or subtract grain
to make it balance. It can be Very accurate. I used standard galvanized steel
electrical conduit for the rod. Works great.

You need insulated wire- Magnet wire is best, especially with 200 turns.
 Magnet wire has very thin, clear insulation.  For best results, the windings
should be tightly spaced and placed on the rod one layer at a time.  A
ferrite rod is not the same as an iron rod.  I believe ferrite rod consists
of iron and non-ferrous material to produce inductors with more inductance
and better frequency response.  A good electronics store should stock the
magnet wire and the ferrite rod.

  Back to BEER...I'm looking make my siphoning easier.  I currently fill the
siphoning hose and racking cane with sterilized water but this can be a pain.
 (I should note I am in a condo and space is at a premium.)  My idea is to
add a branch line near the end of the hose with a one-way valve so I can
start the siphon with my mouth without risk of contamination. Once started, I
can switch over to the main line.
  US Plastics has 3-ways stopcocks for $15-25.  These are the chemical
resistant, high pressure variety.  I don't need and don't want to pay for
this level of quality.  I would expect a regular quality 3-way would not be
much more expensive than the standard 2-way (line on/off) version found in my
local brew shop for $1.19. Anyone know of other good sources of this type of
hardware?  Or, does anyone have a good low-tech siphoning solution?

Subject: Hello, re o/n mash, bottle removal


Greetings all,


        I have been lurking here for about 2 years, and have recieved a lot of 
good info.  I am a Biochem PhD student and have been brewing for 5 years 
with 30 all-grain batches in the last 2 years.  I also am the 
microbiologist for the Magic Hat Brewery in Burlington. VT.  So now that 
I am out of the lurker mode I will try to contribute when possible :-).


        Regarding OVERNIGHT MASHES I just read the recent Zymurgy and was 
motivated to do a brown ale using this method.  My method utilized two 5 
gallon pots in which I did my mash.  Both mash tuns were stabalized `at` 
158F with about 13 # of grain in each.  They were then put into the oven, 
which was stabalized at 130F, and kept there form 11pm til 6:60 am.  At 
this time the tepmerature in both pots ranged from 142F to 151F.  With 
the majority of recordings in the 145F range. A negative Iodine test 
for several samples was achieved.  The mash was then brought to 170F for 
5 min. mash out.  
        Results: My #1 concern was souring the mash by reaching too low a 
temp in the tuns.  This never occured, luckily, and I tasted no sour or 
off-flavors from the extended mash.  My new concern, however, is  that the 
body that I want will not be there because of the decrease in temp. 
Assuming some B-amylases survived there was plenty of dextrins available 
to convert to more simple sugars and plenty of time to do this.  I figure 
that I had 2-3 hours in the 150-158 range and the remaining 4 hours in 
the 142-149 range.  The beer is still fermenting, but I will update the 
"body" results when consumption ensues.
        Conclusions:  IMO I would raise the stove temp in my system to 
keep the final temp above 150F min.  If I were using a Gott cooler, I 
would definately pre-heat with warm water before mashing in.  Also I 
would do an O/N test w/ water alone.  Although this would not hold the 
temperature as well as water & grains it would give you some indication 
of the maximum temperature drop you could expect.  I will probably do 
this again, but I found that the time saved was small.  I still had to 
set up all my equipment the night before, and bring my sparge water to 
temp in the morning.


Finally,  what is the best reagent to use to remove bottle labels.  I 
have seen it posted before, but can not find it on the cat's meow or 
archived digests. 


I hoped this helped..or added more info..

IMHO, this is a good idea in that it will help with the 'access'

dump the contents to HBD on a _monthly_ basis (because a: it doesn't
change that frequently so far and b: that's about all the available

our cyber-community.


Vote 'Aye', 'Nay', or 'Abstain' in an e-mail not to

a lot of them), I'll start the echo at the end of this month.

I actually found and purchased two bottles of Road Dog last night at a
liquor store here in Fort Collins CO.  An article I had read in the
Rocky Mountain News implied the beers had never made it out of the
brewery, but apparently at least some did.


The front label has "Good Beer -- No Shit" in pretty prominent letters,
and there's a paper tag around the neck with some of Thompson's writing
where he refers to being "ripped to the tits."  But apparently that's
not all the story.  According to the newspaper article, Broadway/Flying
Dog started shipping the beer before the labels had been approved by the
BATF.  This is a big no-no, swear words notwithstanding.


I remember talking to Sandy Jones, owner of HC Berger brewing here, just
before his brewery opened.  We were talking about his labels, and he
mentioned that he had one label rejected because a colon in the Surgeon
General's warning was placed too low, or something utterly trivial like
that!


The label approval process for commercial breweries is a real pain in
the butt, so Broadway just tried to do an end-around.  It didn't quite
work.  I hope they don't get in too much trouble; I want to still be
able to buy Doggy Style.


Something to think about next time you're having trouble affixing labels
to your bottles of homebrew.  It could be worse :-(.

A couple of years ago, I wanted to brew but was very pressed for time. I
tried the overnight mash and it went very well. It was a five gallon batch,
in a 5 gallon gott cooler. I mixed the water and grain in the cooler about 10
or 11PM, adjusted the temp to 158F and went to bed. Next morning about 7 or
8AM the temp had only dropped to 140! (I was amazed.) I was done boiling and
cleaning up by 11AM.


Isn't there another potential drawback here? I'm sure I read or heard
somewhere that a long sparge can draw out tannins or chlorophenols or some
such from the husks? The beer I made was a trappist style dubble, and turned
out great, no worries at all.
Obviously, YMMV.

Subject: Overnight Mash in Cooler/Other Opinions




In #1856 Calvin Perilloux asked about experience with infection
when mashing in a cooler (overnight).  I only did this one time
quite by accident in preparing wort for a starter--fortunately
the amount was small because it was most definitely soured by
morning.  The aroma was unmistakably...well, bad.


Bob P mentioned the problem a brewery had here in Colorado with
The Authorities over its label ("Good Beer, No Shit!").  This
reminded me of the thread recently regarding how packaging vs
content influences sales.  I personally am not bothered at all
by the use of a four-letter word on the label, and find it very
amusing.  But, from a business perspective it doesn't say "We want
to be in business for a hundred years."  The message I get is
"We're having some fun now." I think it would be a poor choice,
Beer Gestapo or no.


Charlie brought up the issue of style guidelines, but it was the
proposal for shipping a 5 gal cask of pale ale via yacht that
intrigued me.  I know from personal experience with an American
white oak keg that yes, the pale ale would be almost undrinkable
due to oak flavor (and aroma).  Yet, I have to think ale in real
European oak casks properly conditioned should hold out quite
well--isn't that how wine is aged, as well as a lot of lambic?
I dunno, I just thought real ale was stored in oak for weeks
(at least) and haven't heard anyone describe oakiness as a real
ale attribute.  I don't know one way or another, just asking.

I can't quote verbatim, but I seem to remember Terry Foster in "Pale 
Ales" saying English oak is far different from other types of oak (i.e. 
does not have the strong oaky" character). Also, he indicates that 
the wood is treated with (pitch or tar) to seal it, further isolating 
the beer from gathering "woody" character. I suspect the worst 
conditions the beer was exposed to were constant agitation and warm 
temps... So if we add oak chips to our IPA we may not be in the 
"traditional" style. If there are any barrel "coopers" (cask 
craftsmen) out there, perhaps we could hear how the wood is actually 
processed to make a traditional cask...

would be OK to use it in soda pop. It would be best to have the parents
check with the medic.


I had 2 private e-mails about the N2O comments in #1856 both of which

Howdy All!


I am just getting into kegging my brew. I've got a half-size
fridge that I currently use to store beer and hops. Unfortunately,
it is about 2 inches too short inside to fit a corny keg. There has
been talk of a jockey box (coil of tubing in chest of ice) but I was
wondering if anyone has made a permanent jockey box. I think I
could drill a hole in the side or back of the fridge and run beverage
tubing thru it. Inside the fridge would be a coil of copper tubing in a
container of water (for increased thermal mass). Then the tapper would
connect to the other end of the tubing so beer would get cold as
it travels thru the copper tubing immersed in the cold water.


Has anyone done anything like this before? If the tubing is too long
will the beer go bad sitting in it inbetween servings?


In a similar vein, I just picked up a 20# CO2 tank (used but good shape)
and a *brand new* dual guage regulator for $50 at a restaurant supply/salvage
place. THey had all sorts of neato Stainless steel stuff. He even had
a SS beer fridge (about 3 ft wide and 3.5 ft tall) with a beer shank
and everything, but he wanted 200 bucks for it. Maybe I'll go back and
try to bargain him down..... Bargains can be had in the seedier portions
of town. (No the stuff is not stolen - they typically buy up all the 
fixtures when restaurants go out of business.)

A "choke" is an inductor; not a resistor. Ferrite is, as I recall,

Copper is non-magnetic and, therefore, will not work.

Subject: RIMS process questions


I have been experimenting with my RIMS system for 10 months now ( I only brew
on holiday weekends), trying to find the best place to read the temperature
for controlling the in-line heater. The temperature probe started out just
before the heater (attached to the SS piping, not in-line), but I found that
my mash temperature was low by about 10 degrees F. I then placed the temp.
probe closer to the mash output and in-line. This helped, but was still off
by around 4 degrees F. Finally I took a two foot SS temp. probe and inserted
it into the middle of the mash. I was right on temperature wise, but the
output of the heater was about 8 degrees F. higher than the mash temp. at the
bottom of the mash until equilibrium. BTW, my electronic thermometer was
verified by comparing its reading against the calibrated thermometer in the
sparge tank when measuring sparge water.


How critical are these temperature points? I made an alt last weekend with
temp. rests at 125, 144 and 158 with mashout at 169, and got 93% efficiency
according to SUDS. But while I was at the 158 rest I measured the temp. of
the outflow. It measured 165. 


Over a period of 20-30 minutes the temps equalize. This probably isn't a
problem for single mash temps, but what about when I have all these rests?
Should I move the temp probe to the top of the mash, rather than the middle?
I would assume that the mash would take even longer to reach temp. if I did
that.


What does the RIMS experienced collaborative have to say?

Somebody mentioned apparent leaks from aluminum pots.  I have had

would not use them for beer.  I use Al only for cooking bland 
foods like pasta.  If you can't plump for stainless steel, then
stick with enamel.  Yeah, it gets chipped, and you get rusty spots,
but I prefer the tiny amount of iron introduced in this way to
what may well be a greater amount of aluminum.  And enamel is so
cheap that you can probably afford to replace your cooker after
a few years of faithful service if necessary.  I'm more concerned
with the taste than the danger of Alzheimer's, which has 
probably been...um...I forget what I was going to say.
