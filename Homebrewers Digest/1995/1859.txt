Subject: Beta-amylase at 140F (60C)


Steve is looking for a discussion of lower temperature saccharification
rests.  It seems clear to me that although slow at 60 degrees,
saccharification is going on.  As Steve points out, maximum fermentability
is achieved somewhere around 60.  But that's as far as we agree.
Steve:
>I'm not overly enamoured of the higher amylase activity at 65C as a
>homebrewer.  A-B may be in a hurry when they brew; I can afford the
>extra 30 minutes.  A homebrewer's greater difficulty is in controlling

>intermediate temperature which results in the correct balance of alpha
>& beta amylase activities (like your 65C).  Controlling mash results by
>this fine temperature control is relatively difficult.


It's interesting to note that although a mash at 60 gives max
fermentability, a mash at 65 gives max extraction.  I know, craft brewers
are not mainly concerned with extraction but it illustrates that beta and
alpha amylases do not work in isolation.  For this reason I don't think it
can be as neat as separate rests for beta and alpha at their respective
optimum temperatures.  In a mash around 65 where both are active, I can
think of two ways alpha helps beta do its job.  Alpha amylase is the more
important liquefaction enzyme, it facilitates water uptake in the starch
granules so that beta can get to work.  Secondly, alpha can break 1-6 links
connecting the side chains of starch to make more ends available to beta.
So Steve, I'm afraid you'll have to stop mashing so low and come up to
around 65 like some of the rest of us. (Just kidding)  To be honest, my
main objection to low saccharification rests is the resulting  beer - too
dry for my tastes.

Subject: Aluminum Pots


In HBD #1854 Randy Barnes, San Diego, writes:

I used a 15 gallon aluminum lobster pot that I bought for $25 at a
closeout store for about four years.  I had no trouble with it and made
excellent beer.  Only problem with it was that it was impossible to find
anyone willing or able to weld a drain pipe and valve on it, which is
why I sold it and bought a Vollrath stainless 15 gallon pot.  I wanted
the convenience of no more damned hot wort siphons, and the advantage of
a false bottom for sparging all-grain batches and separating leaf hops
(and hot break) from the boiling wort at boil's end.


The only difference I noted was in the fermentation.  Certain ale yeasts
took 50% to 100% longer to ferment out completely when the wort was
boiled in aluminum.  In other words, instead of a 7-10 day primary
ferment, it always took about 2 1/2-3 weeks.  Of course, the beer tasted
excellent, so I never felt this to be a problem.  And re-pitches of the
yeast remained viable and continued to make good beer.  I won about
eight ribbons at various competitions with the beer brewed in this pot.


Alzheimers from aluminum pots?  Paranoid bullshit.  Autopsies performed
on Alzheimer's patients show elevated levels of aluminum, granted, but
nobody's been able to prove that aluminum is the cause rather than a
symptom.  Probably because aluminum is so common in so much of the food
we eat - it's almost impossible to keep from ingesting _some_ aluminum
in your diet.  An article in the New York Times cooking section a few
years ago demonstrated that even with low-pH foods (like beer wort) the
increase in ingested aluminum from aluminum cooking pots is negligible.


So if you have an aluminum pot, and don't mind not having a drain valve
and spigot, don't be afraid to use it.  You'll make great beer with it.


Prosit!

I didn't get to go to Eastern Europe this summer, but I did spend about an
hour in the Bratislava airport a couple summers ago. While waiting, a bunch
of people in my party had something that translates to Red Pheasant (or
maybe Rooster or maybe Bird or maybe Big Ol' Feathered Thing). It was a
strong yummy beer. I don't remember the name of the brewery, but it was
a Slovak beer and it was good. That's not much help I realize, but hey
I just wanted to contribute my $1/50.

Charlie,


I too, don't really like the brewing software that I've come across so far.
 Currently, I use a hodgepodge of Excel spreadsheets that are getting my by
until I can take the time to sit down and write my own program (I am a senior
CS major at The University of Puget Sound, Tacoma, WA).  Right now, I am
tossing around the far fetched idea of proposing to write a homebrew recipe
formulator next semester for my independent study class (I think I can pull
the wool over their eyes by proposing it as a software engineering project --
boy I hope none of my profs are reading this!  :-{ ).  Will make sure I post
the BB location of it if and when I ever get around to coding the
application.


Prost!

PS - I will make sure to poll HBD readers about what features, etc. to
include with the application sometime in the future.

Ale has long been the drink of thugs, convicts, rowdies, rakes and other
depraved outlaws who thrive on the quick bursts of night energy that ale
brings.  In the 17th century England gangs of ale-crazed fops would
often fight to the death in all-night brawls on public greenswards,
which terrified the citizenry and left many of the infamous "youngblood
horsemen" chopped up with grievous sword and dagger wounds...  These
were the Wild Boys of Olde English story and song, rich sots on
horseback who amused themselves in London by riding out at night, ripped
to the tits on strong ale, and "pooped old ladies into empty
booze-barrels and rolled them down steep, cobblestone hills with crazy
screams and shouts"*

First of all, let me offer this disclaimer, which other HBDers have
heard before: Dan McConnell, PhD, owner of YeastLab, is a good friend of
mine, and gives me starters as part of his Quality Assurance program.
So I never buy yeast.  However, as I have stated before, and as Dave
("I'm not from here, I just live here") Draper gleefully quoted me, I
can't be bought for a mere $3.50.  Furthermore, I have a bit of a
paternal feeling for this particular yeast (A01), since Dan cultured it
up (before he started YeastLab) from a bottle of Cooper's Sparkling Ale
hand carried from Oz by Aussie friends of mine, back before it was
available here.  At the time, we didn't know anything about the yeast,
but I was intrigued by the ale by Jackson's description of it and the
brewery (the brewery that time forgot, so to speak) in his original
World Guide to Beer.


It became and remains a favorite yeast of mine and of others in the Ann
Arbor Brewers Guild.  It is a good, general purpose ale yeast that
delivers a nice, complex fruitiness, especially when fermented in the
upper 60s to low 70s.  It also seems to me to emphasize the hops, as
opposed to other yeasts which seem to emphasize the malt (which I also
like in some styles). Right now, I have on tap two ales fermented with
this yeast: a best bitter (a bit darkish with dark medium crystal and
some special B; and a nice "cascadey" American pale ale (I called it
Sierra Foothills - at OG 1.040, it doesn't quite reach the summit of
Sierra Nevada).  The yeast makes a nice contribution to each of these
somewhat different ales.  Interestingly, the bitter, which was pitched
from a culture, keeps on ticking over, providing a continual source of
keg pressure.  The American Ale, which was repitched from the bitter,
fermented out and quit.  I kegged it, and a week later tapped it and was
surprised to find it had virtually no pressure.  Actually, this is a bit
of a bother, since I like to have the continual evolution of just enough
CO2 to keep the beer conditioned without a CO2 tank.


So, with all of that said, let me suggest that the source of your and my
continuing fermentation (more bothersome for you, since you have
bottled), is variation in the grain bill and mash schedule.  As you have
pointed out, different parts of the mash are likely to be different
temperatures, making it hard to say just what the oeprative temperature
actually is.  Dave Line recommends a higher mash temp for "ales from the
wood," so that the wort will have more dextrins, which provide that very
slow fermention that continually provides conditioning.  (Dextrins are
nominally unfermentable, but it seems to me that some of them, perhaps
the shortest, do so very slowly, ultimately producing a thinner, drier,
more carbonated beer over time).  I think that crystal malts may provide
some of this as well.  Perhaps a slightly lower mash temperature would
produce a better fermenting out wort.


The other possible explanation of continuing fermentations is
underpitching and/or under aeration.  I assume that since you repitched,
this is not your problem.  Anyhow, I don't think this is due to the
yeast strain.  I've used it dozens of times and have not seen it any
more or less than with any other yeast.

Sassafras contains safrole, which is a carcinogen, hence the ban. Nutmeg is
a hallucinogen which will trash your liver, but it's legal, because nobody
uses those amounts (unless they're in prison.) Has to do I believe with
something called the Delaney Amendment.  If it's proven to cause cancer in
lab rats, they have to ban it.

Probably not much, unless you're exposed to lots of other
carcinogens/mutagens at work.  This might be a question for
alt.folklore.herbs.  I would guess that the result of these rootbeer
recipes would be no more carcinogenic than your typical American commercial
beer. But then, I'm not drinking it.  Anybody got some hard science on
this?

Subject: Homemade Malt Mill


I've just completed a single roller malt mill.  It crushes the malt against
an adjustable tangential steel plate. I puzzled for a long time over what to
use for the roller since I wanted to avoid spending alot of $$$ at a machine
shop on a metal one.  I decided to use concrete.  Got a 4" diameter PVC pipe
cap, drilled a 5/8" hole in it's center, inserted a 5/8" steel rod which had
a 5/16" rod inserted into a hole (serves as torque reinforcement and
enhances the bond of the concrete to the shaft). The thing looks like this:


        +========= <----------4" pipe cap form
        |   ++
        |   ||<---------------5/16" rod
        |   ||
    +-------||-----------+<---5/8" rod shaft
    +-------||-----------+
        |   ||
        |   ||
        |   ++
        +=========
I used fast setting "quickcrete" to fill the pipe cap.  It's available in 10
pound yellow plastic buckets and has no gravel in it.  After the concrete
set (24 hours), I removed the pipe cap by cutting slots along it's periphery
with a table saw and then pried off the plastic in chunks. The roller was
then mounted into a wood frame with ball bearings.  It was a tad out of
round  and had a slight taper along it's axis so I used a right angle
grinder with a masonary disk to true it up. Did it by rotating the roller
while applying the grinder.  


The mill works great and cost less than $20.  I'd worried it might produce
too much flour, however, in a pound of grain, there's only about a
tablespoon or so of flour.  I'm doing my first partial mash today.
Wish me luck...

Tim Laatsch asked about using epoxy for his copper pipe assembly instead of
soldering.  


This past weekend I replaced my hot water heater (Sooo much more fun than
brewing.)  Instead of sweating on a new copper pressure release drain tube I
used some "Copper-Bond" by The Noble Company at my local hardware store.
<$8.00.  It's an epoxy that they say is specifically formulated for copper
pipe, is intended for hot and cold water service, contains no lead, and "is
made from food grade safe resins".  It seems to work fine - so far, but it's
not being used under pressure.  Of course I'm not associated with this

Subject: Wyeast 1056


I recently had a batch go bad during primary fermentation.  I was using Wyeast
1056, no starter, just pitched the swollen pack into the cooled wort.
Fermentation caught on after 24 hours and went for a week.  After fermentation
ended I racked to the secondary; I was confounded by the nasty, green apple
smell during the racking and almost puked when I stuck my head in the plastc
primary.  My initial conclusion was, hey, I lost it in my sanitation procedures
even though I cut no corners and had no problems before.
Well, I tried a little experiment with yeast propagation following  Dave Ebert's
technique outlined in a recent HBD posting as follows:


>
>I smack a fresh pack of Wyeast and prepare about 1 gallon of 1.030 
>wort that has been highly aerated and supplemented with a good dose 
>of yeast nutrient.  When the yeast pack has swollen properly I pitch

>carefully rouse the slurry back into solution and siphon the fluid 
>into 11 12oz bottles.  I cap them, label them, and place them in the 
>fridge.
>


I tried this using Wyeast 1056; I obtained this from a different retailer than
my bad batch yeast.  As I was transferring to the bottles after fermenting,
there it was again, the green apple, sick smell, a little less putrid  but quite
noticeable.


Both packets of yeast were stamped with a September '95 date, and, in between
these two run-ins with Wyeast 1056 I brewed a great batch of beer using a
different yeast!  Fermentation temperatures were in the proper range each time.


I have given a fellow brewer another packet of the same yeast to try propagation
at his home completely away from any house bacteria loitering around my brewery.
Before the results from this experiment come in, my question for the collective
is, Has anyone else had this problem with the September crop of Wyeast 1056?
Any other possible explanations out there?  Is there a WYeast Labs hot line?


Like all my other brewing adventures, I am looking forward to better brewing
from this run in.  If I can nail down the problem I'll post the solution.  Thanx

O2 is probably quicker, but I've heard it is possible to OVER aerate using 
O2.  Over aeration isn't really possible using an aquarium pump.  Don't

I rely on a couple brewing programs.  I use "Brewbe" to calculate infusion

If you're 
going to use oil, I recommend mineral oil since it's colorless,
odorless, 
doesn't have flavor and won't go rancid. The food grade variety 
goes for 
less than $3/pint at your local drug store. The drawback is that 
it's sold 
as a oral lubricant (perhaps a good thing), and laxative:^) From 
what I 
remember of steam distillations, most, if not all of any oil that
gets to 
the wort for the first couple of batches should get boiled off, as
long as 
it doesn't complex with anything. Remeber that lipids (oils) in 
your 
finished brew will be detrimental to head retention. You should 
probably 
apply any finish you decide on to preheated wood to open 
the pores for 
maximum penetration making it less likely to come out 
in your mash.

Well, I wouldn't use enough for that to happen - but you have a point I 
suppose. The idea is to use just enough finish so it is absorbed into the 
wood.  Just a little dab will do yah.  Anyway, my preference is for the 
unfinished approach. I'd just try and get a spoon (or paddle if my tun 
was large enough) made of dense-grained wood).


The concern I have with non-penetrating finishes (like poly or varnish) 
is that they could flake off eventually.

Hi Tom


> I under stand

In the UK cask conditioned beers are mainly dispensed from metal 
casks, these are either stainless steel or aluminium. The reason is 
simply cost, they are cheaper than wood casks and it doesn't seem to 
affect the flavour. That said there are still a large number of 
brewers and homebrewers who use wood casks, me included. The casks 
are made from European oak and are unlined. From conversations I've had 
with other American brewers it seems that the only casks you get in the US are 
made from American oak.  European oak doesn't impart any flavour to 
the beer which is why the casks are used unlined. American oak 
however gives the beer a strong oak flavour - I've never tried it 
but have been told that the flavour can be overpowering. Therefore if 
you can't get hold of casks made from European oak I would definitely 
recommend that you  use a lined cask. IPA brewers used to ship their 
beer to India in unlined European oak casks (I don't know where the 
story arose that they used pitch lined casks - it isn't true!).


Hope this helps.

Last call for entries, stewards and BJCP judges! The entry window
is open, and stays open to 6 PM on Halloween <;{>. Interested
judges and potential stewards should contact Wayne Gisiger, Judge
Coordinator at his office (202) 501-2100 x2798, or at home (703)
256-8838. The HC is sanctioned by the American Homebrewers
Association (AHA) and recognized by the Beer Judge Competition
Program (BJCP). Points for judges and stewards will be reported
to both organizations. The judging is closed to the public and
only judges, stewards and the agonizing committee will be
admitted to the competition site.


Once again, the competition will take place at the Hyatt Regency
Washington on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. The ice-breaker
beer is planned to be served at 10:00 AM, BoS judging is expected
around 2:30 PM. Winners will be announced and ribbons presented
immediately after the BoS is over. BTW, the ice-breaker brew this
year is an IPA.


Stewards should plan on arriving at 9:00 AM, and judges by 9:30
AM. Judges bringing pre-registered entries should arrive at 9:00
to give us time to get the brews into the correct flight.


The Hotel is at 400 New Jersey Avenue, NW, just a few blocks from
the Union Station Metro. For those driving, 1st St., NW (behind
the hotel) has free on-street parking on Saturday.


This year, the Dulles Regional Brewing Society has commissioned a
well known (to us) artist to create a unique and distinctive

out) on the back.


Although these are being produced at great expense, they are
available for $12.00 apiece in L and XL sizes. If you are not

We will mail it (them?) postage paid. Note: we can not accept
Postal Money Orders - also true for entries.


For those who will be participating on the 4th, just bring your

I think you may be a little too paranoid.  I just completed a test to
prove/disprove the theory that RIMS detractors put forth that you
cannot get a beer with body from only pale malt because the temp boost
from protein rest to sacchrification rest is so slow all starch will
be converted at temps favoring Beta amylase and complete
fermentability.  First batch mashed at 150F second batch at 158F.
First batch was dead dry (1.010 after 5 days primary ferment, FG
1.006).  Second batch just went to secondary after 8 days and it is
only down to 1.023 with tons of residual sweetness and body.  FG will
not be able to be tested for another 2 weeks, but I doubt if it will
get below 1.018.


I put my temp controller probe in the wort stream before the heater
and the digital temperature readout in the outflow stream from the
heater.  I have no temp measurement actually in the mash (soon I will
have my BruProbeand can take actual mash temps, but not now).  I base
my system calibration on the fact that if the outflow of the wort from
the heater is 158F, the mash will eventually come up to 158F and
cannot ever exceed that.  As proven by the results of my recent tests,
I have complete control over the results without any knowledge of the
actual temperature of the mash.


I would have to say that more accurate monitoring of the mash temps
may aid accuracy, but it does not seem necessary to me.  If you adjust
your setpoint based on the mash temp, you will *always* get returning
wort several degrees hotter than your mash setpoint until equilibrium
is reached and I feel that this is not a good plan, especially if you
are trying to mash at the upper limits of an enzyme's range.  I think
limiting the wort outflow temp is much safer, but you do have to deal
with the mash lagging behind.


Given your results of monitoring temperatures, I will be very
interested in monitoring my actual mash temps when I get my BruProbe
working and be able to see exactly how far behind the mash lags.

Last I read, about 4 years ago, it was not illegal to sell, but it had to be
marked as "not edible" or something like that.  A few years before that, it 
was quite popular as an herbal tea.  It turned out to be highly carcinogenic,
if memory serves correctly.  I used to buy it at a health food store, and one
time the jar was marked "not fit for human consumption".  (Several other jars
were also thusly marked, mostly stuff they geared towards people who were 
making potpourri, as far as I could tell.)  Later, when I went back there, the
jar was no longer marked "Not fit..." and I asked, and the guy there said that
it was specially processed to remove the toxins.  


So, it's probably not a great idea to dig up your own sassafras roots unless
you can d that processing.  I recall it having been something simple, but I
really don't remember what that was.  I suggest you ask at a health food store.

OK, I might as well, since EVERYONE seems to ask about it.  (Apologies

More Powerful than Homesickness".  No, it's not original from me.  I got
that on a post card showing a woozy beer swiller, still in the Gasthaus,
sipping his (German) suds well past closing time.  The beer is so good
than it overpowers his need to get home.  Likewise, perhaps it's also
stronger than my own desire to perhaps one day get back to the States
and my much missed weekly brewing, instead of being "stuck here in
Bavaria", where difficulty  getting supplies and equipment (really!),
lots of paperwork, and cheap & good commercial beer all "conspire" to
discourage the hobby.  Hmmm...  But we're working on that over here.
