Bob (Btalk`at`aol.com) & Tim Fields <74247.551`at`compuserve.com>
talk about their air pump setups/woes.


Here's what I've done:


I made a double hole stopper.  In one hole I insert a racking cane & attach
a SS "air stone" via various tubing pieces to the end.  I insert the air pump
hose (?1/4"?.) in the other end of the cane (curved end) .  In the other hole
of the stopper I insert a short piece (3") of 3/8 hard tubing (broken piece of
an old racking cane).  I then use short pieces of various dia tubing on that
to step up to a 5/8 tube which I run into a bucket of water.


I turn the pump on for 15 minutes at a time and let the foam blow
into the bucket.  I use an electronic timer ($20) to automatically cycle
the pump for the next 4 or 5 hours: on for 15 min, off for 1 hour.  After that,
I remove the assembly and replace with a 1" blowoff tube.  I loose less
than a qt of wort but that can easily be accounted for in advance.


The reason I use a 5/8 tube for the blow-off is because it takes less
pressure to push the foam thru the hose as compared to the same length
of 3/8 tube.


Now I need a little guidance and advice:


I'm ready to invest in a brewing fridge.  I've seen some of you mention
that you use a chest-type frezzer - others use an upright refridgerator.
What are the pros/cons of each?

Subject: Styles Again


Charlie Scandrett and Rob Lauriston have started the styles thread up 
again. To summarize from the last go round on this thread, it was
generally agreed by the paticipants, that styles are the common standards
by which beer is judged. As contrived as the styles may be, brewing to
a style helps any brewer refine brewing skills. The goal in refining
brewing skills is to be able to brew to a style and be consistant with
each batch (RIMS anyone?). This is about all that was agreed upon during 
the last conversation on this topic.


Charlie and Rob point out that styles are linked to history and due to the 
evolution of agriculture and technology, it is very difficult to brew true
to the orginial style. This idea has a lot of merit. But, in my opinion,
style definitions are based on today's interpretation of yesterday's style.
There is no reason to cask a barrel of beer and send it in a non-refigerated
slow sailing boat through the tropics to it's finial desitnation. Because 
this is no longer common practice, the IPA style has evolved. Today's
style "guideline" for IPA leans toward a much more balanced beer without
any mention of the oak flavor imparted by the cask trip in the slow boat. 
The style has evolved, reflecting today's brewing environment. I like to 
think styles are referanced to historical styles and are modified by modern
brewing practices. The most styles do evolve as time marches on.


Charlie and Bob's irritation source, IMHO, seem to be borne from the ridged 
definitions applied by a standard bearing association. I must agree that the 
current condition of style "guidelines" that are most often employed by 
competitions seem out of step with the current brewing practice. This opinion 
appears to be acknowledged by both the AHA and BJCP. The BJCP, I believe, is 
attempting to redefine styles and the sugested catagories the styles belong 
to. I am ignorant of any attemps from the AHA to do the same. We, the 
brewers, have influenance to the BJCP process, but I do not know the 
mechanisim of that influance. Help anyone?


Short of changing the style "guidelines", competitions have the power to
define styles and catagories employed in that competition. A large porporton 
of competitions rely on the AHA "guidelines" because they are recognized by 
virtually all brewers and judges as one "definition of beer characterisitics". 
Coordinating a competition is a tremendous amount of work, the AHA 
"guidelines" relieves a lot of work. It is just plain easy to do. On the left 
coast there are a few examples of competitions that have taken the time to 
evaluate the styles and their catagories. The Mayfair competition, organized 
by the Maltose Falcons, is a great example. They have taken the AHA 
"guidelines" and realigned many styles and their catagories. They have
defined a couple of styles that are not in the AHA "guidelines". The
"World Cup of Beers" (held by BAM?) catagorizes via country of style origin,
totally rejecting the AHA catagories. The California State Club Homebrew
Competition (San Andreas Malts) shortened the number of styles and catagories
and included a entry subcatagory of "other", for those beers which do not
conform to the stated styles of a catagory but are similar. The AHA 
"guidelines" are just that, guidelines. Each competition may alter those 
"guidelines" to suit the needs and desires of that competition.


Creating a new style is not hard to do. Obtaining the hard facts (color, 
bittering units, ect.) may be a little expensive (lab testing), but best 
estimates should suffice until the style is widely recognized. The verbal
description of the overall characteristics is required and should be a 
relatively easy task. The object in defining a style is to give the 
"guidelines" of the styles characteristic so a beer may be evaluated by 
agreed evaluation criteria. Recognition of a style is very difficult. The 
"hegemonistic" (great word Charlie) quality of standard organizations may 
prove the largest road block. Again, the BJCP may have a mechanism to 
circumvent this issue.  I am ignorant of any attempt by the AHA. Because
a style is not "recognized" does not preclude it's use in a competition. It
just is not recognized by one or another standards association. Big deal.


We, the brewers, have the power to define styles and catagories. We may 
choose to influance standards organizations or employ new styles in our 
competitions. Charlie claims "the market....will begin to rationalize 
styles." I disagree. I believe it is the influential brewers, both commercial 
and homebrewer that will define new styles. I think, as more brews take on a 
particular unique style, the brewers will demand the style be seperate from 
other styles. I believe the experienced judges will recognize that a style 
is emerging as larger number of competition entries don't not quite fit 
current style guidelines but yet, have common characteristics. One or two 
breweries producing a new style may not have enough horespower to create a 
new style. (Unless the one or two breweries are the likes of Budswilloors!) 
Hundreds of competition entries should. I am convinced that both the AHA and 
the BJCP are willing to listen to our opinions. The problem is finding the 
method to having our opinions heard in a strong enough voice that these 
standards associations are encouraged into action. 


Is there such a style as American or Californian Stout? Hmmm......

Subject: RIMS Process/Temperature Control




Steve Dragon (dragonsc`at`aol.com) asked about where to pick up the
temperature.  He noted getting different temperatures everywhere
in the system.  I see two criteria: you'd like to get a good
representative temperature, one that best describes what the bulk
of the enzymes see during the mash, and, you'd also like to read
the temperature in such a way as to guarantee no overshoot or
scorching.


The only way you can get a "good representative temperature" that
I can think of is to either design or use the system in such a way
as to eliminate gradients.  This means you can't have channeling
in the grain bed, and *may* mean the tun should be insulated too.
If you can do this, then the first criteria is met with the probe
placed anywhere--it just doesn't matter.  The main motivation for
building a RIMS is to maximize temperature control of the Whole
Mash.  It does no good at all to control the heater effluent
temp to a knat's ass, only to have it cool down 10 degrees at the
walls of the tun, IMO.


The best way to meet the second requirement is measure the temp
of the wort downstream of the heat application source.  If you're
using a heating chamber, then you should measure either in the
chamber or at the exit of the chamber.  If you heat the bottom of
the tun (with any method) then measure in the pipe exiting from
the tun.  Yes, you want to control the Whole Mash temperature,
but it's THIS temperature that absolutely cannot be allowed to
go above the setpoint (at least not by some unknown amount).


> How critical are these temperature points?


Well, I'll be opinions vary on this one, but...I did a stovetop
all-grain recently, using recirculation by hand to control temp.
Batch One was controlled very well at about 152F, and the beer
turned out tasty, but just a tad thinner than I wanted.  My notes
said "mash at about 154F next time to enhance body".  Okay.


I duplicated the recipe and procedure down to the millisecond/
microgram, but dorked up the temperature control.  Almost 45 minutes
of the Big Rest was done at precisely 150F, with the final 15 min
done at about 154F.  Result: noticeably watery porter.  That's all
I have to say about that.  YMMV.

Subject:       Low/no alcohol


I have a question for the collective wisdom out there.  How can a 
homebrewer reduce (or even eliminate) the alcohol content of his
brew?   With the variety of non-alcohol commercial "beers" available 
now (some LOOK like they are probably good) I am wondering if 
whatever commercial techniques are used can be transferred to 
homebrewing.  Of course, I would PREFER to hear about techniques that 
do not affect the taste ...

Subject: Thanks and Hops in Starters; Effective??


Beery G'day to you all,


    First, thanks to those responding to my query about the banana blasting
qualities of Wyeast 1214 (Abbey); the takehome on this is that it is a
notorious isoamyl acetate producer, almost regardlesss of temperature.  Some
recommended better pre-pitching aeration; one said use a wit yeast (3944) or
an altbier yeast (don't know how this would hold up to high OG/high alc.
concentration, though).  Encouragingly, some experience is out there that
their banana beer from hell conditioned after 6-12 months into something
wonderful. I'm packing mine away into a deep dark cold part of the cellar to
be revisited next summer.....


Question/Comments du jour.....


     USING HOPS IN STARTERS.....  What component of the hop chemical profile
has been shown to be of bacteriostatic value? (Note - it is not bacteriocidal,
per se, nor is it "antiseptic" as has been also disseminated).  
    Of course, using hops for bittering requires a boil induced
isomerization of alpha acids, etc.  If it is not this isomerized organic acid
which confers bacteriostatic properties to the sweet wort, what is it? 
Is/are the compound(s) known, and more importantly, what is/are its/their
solubility.  For example, is it necessary to boil hops for extended periods
to obtain bacteriostatic properties in starters, or is it sufficient to heat
to boiling for wort sterilization purposes as well as solubilzation of the
active compounds.
     I like having the possible 'built in' advantage that using hops in
starters may confer, but in practice does anyone have any data (or short of
this, opinions) as to how long hops (I use pellets) need to be boiled to
obtain bacteriostatic effects (I could care less about bittering my
starters; I decant the supernatant anyway, and only pitch the slurry of a 2-3
liter starter.)?   Have any experiments been done along these lines?


     I think many homebrewers would like to know this if they use starters
regularly (I always do); furthermore, suitable extracts might be developed
including the bacteriostatic compounds which would enable a few drops of
extract to keep potential infections at bay, particularly when yeast are
successively repitched.  Data??  Thoughts??  Opinions??  Speculation??


[I'm sorry if I am resurrecting an old thread, but I don't recall ever
discussing this in recent HBDs, nor ever getting an adequate answer from
printed info.... please direct me if I'm wrong or mis-/under-informed.]


     Good brewing,

Subject: white spots revisited






A couple of weeks ago I posted a message describing white spots
which appeared inide the bottles of a 4-week-old batch of ale.
I asked whether these were yeast or bacteria colonies.  Their
appearance was soon followed by a considerable increase in 
carbonation, and a tendency toward gushing.  The flavor and
aroma of this ale were fine - quite good in fact, but being
afraid that spoilage was in progress, and that explosions were
iminent, I consumed the batch.  None of those who assisted in
its disposal had any complaints.


Several people have responded to me privately to say that they
thought the spots were yeast.  One or two had seen something
similar (although nobody mentioned the gushing).  I used
Edme dried ale yeast for that batch, and am still wondering
what the spots are all about, and in general, what the 
symptoms of bacterial and wild yeast contamination are.  I hope
those more knowledgeable than myself will clue me in.  Private
responses or public are welcome - I will post a summary.

  Why not attach a 1" dia. blow off hose?  Run your smaller diameter tube
attached to the air pump and stone inside that fat one.  Immerse the
open end of the big tube in a pint container with a little sanitizing
solution in the bottom.
  When you're done aerating, just reel in the smaller tube out the open
end of the big one. Leave the big tube in place for the massive rocky head
that typically appears the next day.


  Personally, I'm too cheap to use the powered aereation method. I just 
shake the hell out of the carboy (or bucket).  It works pretty good. 
I could see the logic behind power aereating batches of 10 gallons or more.
10 gallons of beer probably weighs a ton.

Subject: Mead- Slow(No) Start w/Re-pitched Yeast


A question for the brewing gurus out there...


Though I am a fairly experienced beer brewer, I recently racked my first
ever batch of Mead to a secondary fermenter and I carefully salvaged and
refrigerated about 24 ounces of thick yeast sediment from the bottom of the
carboy.  I had used 3 packs (about 21 grams) of Red Star champaigne yeast
along with a teaspoon or so of yeast nutrient (some stuff called "fermax")
in that batch and had seen a rapid, vigorous and thorough fermentation
result.  I pitched the salvaged yeast into a second batch of mead this past
Sunday, along with a teaspoon of the "fermax" nutrient, fully expecting to
see another rapid fermentation start - perhaps even MORE rapid than the
first batch considering the much larger quantity of yeast being pitched.  I
should note that I have repitched yeast frequently in my 35 or so batches of
beer brewed previously, so I was careful to insure that #1, the temperature
was under 80 deg F (75 F when the yeast was pitched) and #2 that the wort
(excuse me - the 'must') was vigorously aerated prior to pitching the yeast.
I always use liquid yeast cultures in my beer, but went with the dried
champaigne yeast in my mead and figured there would be no problems with
re-pitching the sediment from the dried yeast.


Unfortunately, some 32 hours after pitching the yeast there is NO sign
whatsoever of fermentation.  Since all my nearby homebrew stores are closed
Mondays, I could not acquire any more champaigne yeast and in the effort to
get some sort of fermentation going before the bacteria get a foothold, I
pitched a Wyeast 1056 starter that I was culturing up for my planned beer
batch this week.  My questions for the collective:


#1 Any ideas why the champaigne yeast I re-pitched failed to "ignite"?  Is
it possible that the alcohol level of the mead killed the yeast rather than
the yeast going dormant after converting the available dextrins?  Is
re-pitching yeast in meads a brewing no no?


#2 What effect will the ale yeast I added today have on the mead?  (I plan
to add more dried champaigne yeast tomorrow evening, but felt it essential
to get some sort of fermentation head start on the bacteria.)


Perhaps I should note that the original batch from which the yeast was
salvaged started at 1.088 OG and at racking to secondary was .992 gravity.
This occurred within a month and the mead is already essentially clear.
(Recipe is Papazian's "White Angel Savior Mead" with 3 lbs of prickly pear
fruit & 13.5 mesquite honey).


The batch that failed to "ignite" is a higher gravity "sweet mead" with 7.5
pounds of raspberrys and 20 lbs of "generic" honey (OG 1.135).  I used
frozen raspberries but a check of the package indicated pure 100% fruit (no
yeast inhibiting preservatives).


Your input will be greatly appreciated!

    Come to think of it should I have put silicon tape on the heating element
threads in my copper heating chamber to avoid one of those unlike element
electrolytic thingies, or if there is a worry in that regard, would grounding
the copper do the job?

Subject: Carbonater


Hey all!
I found a used device called a "carbonater". Consists of a motor(probably
1/4 hp, small brass or bronz pump, a tank about the size of a propane torch
canister and made out of SS. The tank has electrical power feeding into a
connector on top. Somewhere on the device was stamped 190 psi. The name
plate had the manufacturer as "AVCO" (or something like that-definitely a
four letter name starting with "A") with "dispensing equipment" printed on
it. Anybody know what this thing does? Is it a device for carbonating
beverages?

Sorry Charile... the oak used in UK beer casks (and lambiek/lambic casks for
that matter) is *european* oak and imparts virtually no flavour or aroma even
when new.  After a few uses, it adds absolutely no flavour or aroma.  American
oak does add a lot of oaky flavour, but is not used for beer casks (it was
used for Ballentine's IPA years ago and their IPA did indeed have an oaky
flavour).


Note that there is a small amount of oak flavour imparted by fresh european
oak, most notably in Rodenbach Grand Cru.  Considering that the beer sits
in these huge oak tuns for 3 years and that the tuns are disassembled so
the staves can be scraped to expose fresh wood, but that Rodenbach Grand
Cru has but a mild oakiness shows how little oak flavour is imparted by
european oak.  Surely the ship to India did not take 3 years and they
probably did not use brand new casks.


Charlie also says:
>1/ Why can't an  excellent American Bock beat a very good  Helles Bock in a 
>competition? They are close enough to be compared and contest.


Of course it could, but only if the American Bock was judged as an American
Bock and the Helles Bock as a Helles Bock.  Head-to-head the American Bock
(e.g.  Augsburger Bock, Frankenmuth Bock...) would be far too weak and watery 
compared to Ayinger Mai Bock, Einbecker Mai Ur-Bock or Forschungs St. Jakobus
Bock.  Judged as American Bocks, these three would be tossed out for being
too big and too alcoholic for style.


Finally, Charlie says:
>Let the brewer woo the palate within broarder categories!


Is something broken?  Does something really need fixing?  Yes, there are
some commercial beers that don't fit into the current AHA guidelines
(Orval, for example), but how many people (although I'm not saying that
this is Charlie's or Rob's motivation) calling for relaxing the guidelines
are asking to do so in response to some judge writing that their beer was
"too this for style" or "not enough that for style?"  Judges' jobs are
tough enough already without having to artificially broaden the categories
that MOST judges have agreed are close to the mark.


Regarding historical depth to styles, perhaps there isn't and it would be
quite refreshing to see someone try to take a crack at "Original Porter"
albeit in the Specialty category.  Sure we can't buy brown malt anymore,
but who says we can't try and make it at home?

My EasyMasher is mounted in an enamel pot and although I know there is
a tiny amount of rust forming down there, I have not (in about 30 batches)
noticed any metallic or rust-like flavours in any of my beers, even the
very mildly-flavoured ones.

While Calvin had some other very good suggestions, I don't think that
settling of yeast is a likely candidate for undercarbonation.  I have
bottled several beers with no additional yeast that had sat in secondaries
for 3, 6 or even 12 months and had no carbonation problems.  Now, if the
beer was very strong (8%, 9%, 10%...) and the wort was underaerated, then
fresh yeast (a la Pierre Rajotte) added at botting might help.  Dan noted
that the fermentation was "very long."  This can be an indicator that
the wort was underaerated.

I've been following the recent thread on mashing temperatures,
saccharification, etc. with the greatest interest.  Just one quick
question:  when people speak of "sweetness" vs. "dryness" of the finished
beer, are we really talking about finishing gravity (F.G.)?  That is, is a
"sweet" beer one with a higher F.G., and a dry beer one with a lower F.G.?
Further, does "body" correlate with these?  Look, here's a little chart -
have I got it straight?


Higher temp. mash           Lower temp. mash
Higher F.G.                 Lower F.G.

I'm new to homebrewing and I'm about to attempt my second batch of beer

sanitation and I though I'd post them here to get your opinions.


What is the best sanitizer to use? I recently read in a homebrewing
book that B-Brite is not a sanitizer, it's a cleanser. Is a household
bleach solution a better sanitizer to use? Also, has anyone tried the
new no rinse C-Brite?


I also read (same book) that bottles can be sanitized by heating them
in your oven `at` 200 degrees for 10 minutes. Is this a good idea? Does
anyone use this process?


What is the best way to sanitize your bottle caps? Is it necessary to
boil them or can you just soak them in a sanitizer solution. Won't
boiling have an effect on the rubber seal inside the cap?

From: Delano Dugarm 36478 <ADUGARM`at`worldbank.org>
Subject: IPA and Oak


        In HBD 1856 Charlie Scandrett posted a very lively 
article about beer styles, and used as an example India Pale Ale.
 Here he repeats the old canard that IPA must be oaky.  It ain't 
true, folks.  I've been researching for a talk on IPA for our 
local homebrew club, so bear with a long post.  
        The reason homebrewers originally thought IPA must be 
oaked is that Ballentine Brewing Co. told them so.  Come to think 
of it, they still give that story on the bottle label of their 
IPA.   This goes to show that bottle labels aren't the best way 
to learn history.
        The best source for the history of India Pale Ale is Thom 
Tomlinson's two part article "IPA and Empire" published in 
_Brewing Techniques_ vol. 2, no. 2 & 3 (1994).  At the end of the 
article he tackles the wood issue, and maintains, "My research 
indicates that the oak used for cask production in 19th century 
Britain was harder and contained fewer tannins than the oak we 
use in this country.  I find no evidence that oak casks used in 
shipping contributed to the beer's flavor profile."  In a 
response to a letter to the editor, he also points to 
contemporary British practice, where brewers are horrified at the 
idea of an oaky beer.
        Regardless of the quality of the wood, a 19th century IPA 
would not taste of the oak because the cask was probably lined.  
We know from Wahl and Henius, the 1908 source book for American 
pre-prohibition brewing practices, that American brewers used 
varnishes and brewer's pitch to line both wood fermenters and 
wooden casks.  According to Wahl and Henius, American brewers 
used these substances to a) keep the wood from flavoring their 
beer, and b) keep the beer out of the pores of the wood, where an 
infection might take up residence.  From the descriptions of how 
to apply first aid to brewers injured when the pitch they are 
heating (to soften it) burst into flame, I'll stick with glass 
and stainless.
        Why did people think that Ballentine's oaky IPA was the 
proper example of the style?  Because it seems to have been the 
only one available in the US from at least World War II till 
1975, when Anchor first issued its Liberty Ale.  Tomlinson 
guesses that Ballentine was the last example of an American IPA 
style, based on stronger tasting American oak casks, but I think 
that the oak taste might have just been an eccentricity of 
Ballentine.
        I love India Pale Ale, and am always disappointed to 
encounter a home-brewed version that tastes like gnawing on a 
tree.  I say keep the wood out of the beer.

It sounds like you are basically using two temperature readings, although
a computer chip (temp controller) is monitoring one for you. For those of
us that are EE challenged and are willing to control things manually, I
wonder if two simple thermometers could achieve the same goal.  Here's my
idea:  Place one thermometer before, and one after an electrical hot
water heater element whos heat output is controlled by a dimmer switch. 
Then manually lower the power to the heating element as the outlet
temperature approaches your set point.  Once the two thermometers read the
same temperature you are at equilibrium and you can turn the element off,
until it's time for the next temp ramp.  


I must admit that I don't even have a RIMS system (or even an all grain
system for that matter) yet.  I'm just trying to think ahead as I plan to
build both very soon.  So, my question is, how naive is my idea?  Does it
sound like too much work?  Or conversely, is Dion's statement that the
outlet temp should not exceed the set point not true?  I know many of you
have a RIMS setup using a propane cooker as the heater which would be 
difficult to monitor inlet temp.  How do you keep from denaturing your 
enzymes by over heating, or is this not a real concern?

my first beer.)


Also a tidbit of information: marjoram (the spice) was used in making early
beers, prior to the discovery of hops.  I learned this from a cooking ency-
clopedia - it works!  (I tried it in my first beermaking attempt, in which
I did everything from scratch, including malting the grain.)


Thanks for any info.

This is a perfectly feasible solution.  In fact, I did it with a
simple on/off switch until I got my temp controller working.  The only
problem with both solutions is that you can get distracted and in the
case of an on/off switch, turn it on when you meant to turn it off.
Since the lag is long, this can be disastrous (as I nearly found
out).  It is quite easy to overshoot by 10 degrees before you realize
what is occurring.  Granted, the dimmer makes it easier to control.


The dimmer is a fine way to work your way into RIMS economically, it
just removes one of the benefits of a temp controller, you have to be
on the edge of your chair controlling the temp the whole time.


Keith> How do you keep from denaturing your enzymes by over heating,
Keith> or is this not a real concern?


This is definitely something I am concerned about.  If you get any
answers that are not posted, I would appreciate getting a copy very
much.


I would assume that denaturing of enzymes would be done in a decoction
because the removed portion is boiled.  However, there is a portion
left behind which is not subjected to high heat and therefore retains
lots of enzymes.  In a RIMS, you are potentially subjecting all the
enzymes to excessive heat.


Thanks,
dion
