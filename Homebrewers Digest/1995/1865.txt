Traditional root beer is flavored with the root bark of 
the sassafras tree (_Sassofras_variifolium_).  The root
bark cannot be sold for human consumption in the US.
Sassafras contains the chemical known as safrole which 
has been shown to be a carcinogen in laboratory animals.
Its oral toxicity in rats is 50% lethality at a dose of 
1.95 g per kg. (_TD50_ = 1.95 g/kg)
Oil of sassafras is about 75 percent safrole.


HEPR (%)        HUMAN EXPOSURE (PER DAY)        RAT CARCINOGEN
4.7             Wine (250ml)                    Ethanol (30 ml)
2.8             Beer  (12 oz; 354 ml)           Ethanol (18 ml)
0.3             Lettuce, 1/8 head (125 g)       Caffeic acid (66.3 mg)
0.2             Real Root Beer (12 oz; 354 ml)  Safrole (6.6 mg)
0.1             Apple, 1 whole (230 g)          Caffeic acid (24.4 mg)
 
_TD50_ = the daily lifetime dose (milligrams of chemical per kilo-
gram of body weight per day) which halves the proportion of rats
which remain cancer-free at the end of a standard lifetime.
_HEPR_ = (Human Exposure/Rat Potency) the percentage of TD50
received by a 70 kilogram human for the given lifetime intake
rate, i.e., (mg chemical per day) / (70 kg)/(TD50 for that chemical).
HEPR is not a direct estimate of the risk of a human getting cancer, 
but rather is an index of relative carcinogenicity.


One glass of beer is about 14 times more carcinogenic than one 
glass of root beer flavored with sassafras.  One glass of wine
is about 23.5 times more carcinogenic.

Subject: Trying to be brief about styles.




First, let me say that Rob Lauritsen pretty much sums up my opinion about
styles with his comments about "reifying", and that styles are good tools
for competetions but should not restrict brewing to your heart's content.

What would happen if I entered the best beer you've ever tasted in a wine 
competetion?

If you brew solely for winning competetions, or would like to, regardless of
whether you brew to style, I pity you, I pity you.  If you make good beer 
and you know it, who cares what some smelly old judge says about it?

Does it?  I've seen lots of new craft beers in the US that don't fit well 
within stylistic boundaries, and lots of which would have to be entered into
the catch-all "specialty beer" categories.  I hope the same is true Down Under.

Mason jars are made to hold in a vacuum. Your homebrew will be just the
opposite.
It's not the strength or thickness of the glass thats the problem, but the
seal that the lid makes.


Once, several years ago, (in the dark ages of sugar beer), I was bottling on
a sunday and had already primed before I realized that I didn't have enough
caps. I saw no other option and but up about 2 gallons in quart mason jars. I
screwed the lids down REALLY TIGHT. 


It worked. The beer was fine, carbonation was fine, no problems. However as I
would not recomend it, as I pointed out the lids of these jars are made to
seal well with a vacuum in the jar, not pressure.

I would also like to see a the Road Dog label.  I will gladly scan it if
someone sends it to me.  (send me email first).  Also, it would be cool if
we could see some other brewer's setups, and I'm sorry I missed the (satelite

It's a matter of personal pride I guess.  I have bottled once or twice in a
couple of bottles that still had the old label on it, but my homebrew
deserves better!  ;-)

Subject: Swollen bags of LME from James Page


I got a couple of cases of Breiss LME from James Page (got the free lb of
hops with it).  The bags are 3lb, and aren't marked as Breiss, but the
original ad said it was Breiss.


Subject line sez it though, several of the bags are swollen now, and there
was way too much air in the bag (IMHO).  All of the bags have air in them
and the swollen ones in particular are at least 1/3 air.  I will try to use
this up quickly, but I'm a bit concerned about it.  I haven't called them
about it yet.  BTW, the bags have not gotten hot or set in the sunlight or
anything like that.  Also, I brewed with a couple of bags of it already and
it seems OK.  What do you think about this?


It took about a month to get delivery.  I was not real happy about that,
still, it was the best price I could find, so I didn't expect the BEST
possible service.  I know that it didn't ship for about 3 weeks after I
initially ordered it because I called them after about 3 weeks.


If I had it to do over again, I would get the Northwestern and pay a bit
more per case.  (Std. disclaimers apply, of course.)

Subject: Stopper Stuck in Carboy






This morning, in getting ready to bottle my latest batch, I did
something really dumb.  I was having trouble getting the stopper
out of my carboy, and in the course of trying to pry it out
with a kitchen knife, I ended up pushing the whole thing into
the carboy.  It doesn't take much imagination to figure out
what my next words were.  This didn't cause any problems in
racking to the bottling bucket, so I proceeded with the
bottling chore, knowing that I had one more thing to do after I
cleaned up.  I did consider smashing the carboy to retrieve the
stopper, but I was determined to try to save both pieces of
valuable equipment.  Then a thought struck me.  After I got off
the floor, I took a piece of flexible electical wire (from a
lamp cord) and was able to run it through the hole in the
stopper.  A ran about an additional foot or so beyond the exit
hole of the stopper, and using a hook fashioned from a coat
hanger, retireved the other end of the wire.  Now having both
ends of the wire, I was able to pull the stopper out sideways.
Both the stopper and carboy managed to survive this generally
painful method of removal.  I hope none of you suffer this, but
just in case you do, this method was rather quick and easy.

True, and beyond that, the yeast from the old batch had probably started
to shut down.  0.992 is pretty much the end of the fermentation.

That might work, but it involves two extra steps where you've got to "keep
it clean" (not that contamination is a big problem with meads, but you
still have to fuss).  Also, consider whether the yeast are really going to
be the same in the new mead, _vs_ having mutated after they've fermented
the old one to about 13% alcohol.


(Personally, since I use dry yeasts for meads, I'd never bother with re-
using yeast from a previous batch.)


>...Also, a starting gravity of 1.135 puts your potential alcohol

If you could ferment out to dry from 1.135, you'd end up below 1.000, so
you'd be well over 18%.  The yeast simply won't make it that far, so it's
going to end up as a sweet mead.  Nothing wrong with that.


>         You may need more than 1t of yeast nutrient; two or three more 
> will probably not affect the final flavor...


Ed's right...if you can get the yeast working, they'll be busy for a long
time and will use up several t of nutrient.  Some folks say that yeast
hulls will do it; IMO they don't supply all you need.  (In Brian's case,
the raspberries are a help.)


>         If all else fails, dillute the must down to 1.100 and ferment.


Probably the best idea to get things going.  Good general rule is to keep
starting gravity of a mead must at/below 1.100.  The normal procedure for
making "high-gravity" meads is actually not to start at high gravity, but
to start at (say) 1.100 and add honey in stages as fermentation progresses.
You are likely to be racking more than once, so you can add honey (thinned
with water so you can mix it in, of course) at each racking.  It compli-
cates the question of the actual effective starting gravity, but the yeast
will be much happier.

Subject: Re: Wort chillers, etc.


I just had to throw in my two bits on this on-going discussion of wort 
chillers.  I have only been brewing for the last few months, but I the 
beer i make won't kill anyone ;)  Though some people will snub their 
noses at my technique, it DOES work just fine.  For beginners or people 
who can't/don't buy/make a chiller of some sort, i suggest simply 
immersing the wort in ice water.  Every time i've used this method i get 
a good cold break.  I just put the lid on my boiling pot and stick it in 
the sink (filled with ice water) and let it sit for about 15 min or so, 
stirring the water every so often.  Then i pour the cooled wort into the 
carboy and if the water i used to top it off doesn't cool it down enough 
i just fill the bathtub (or a bucket of some sort) with icewater and let 
it cool off until it's ready to pitch.  It usually only takes me 30-45 
min to do this, even less in the winter :), and it's never given me a 
problem with contamination yet!  It's a whole lot better than waiting 
overnight to cool the wort down.  


This procedure is by no means better, but it does work just as well so 
far as i can see.


Keep on brewin'!

The absolutely correct "C" to "F" formula is:


               F = C * 1.8 +32


The other way is:


                        F - 32
               C =   --------
                          1.8


Here is a simple "in your head trick":


          Temperature in "C" times 2, subtract 10%, add 32


Which gives you temp in F.


Example:


          You have a wort that measures 29 degrees C.  To get F, 
          
                              29 * 2 = 58
                      10% of this is 5.8 (round to 6)
                              58 - 6 = 52
                              52 + 32 = 84 F
                           Pitch that yeast!

Its two, a 1250 litre and a 3800 litre. Plate exchangers don't have ID, they 
have a small plate gap.  The plates can be configured parallel  to run at any 
flow rate. Carlton United Breweries in Brisbane cool at 8,000 Hl/ hour. Tube

Yes, I badly worded that. Aeration for a few hours will float the cold break 
with vigorous air flow. A further 12 hours is standard for letting the foam 
settle to a cake for skimming.The current "foaming with aquariun pumps" thread 
is this same effect. It is simply used commercially to seperate cold break. 
With air there are saturation limits on DO levels independent of time.

>Ive never heard of prefermentation centrifuging.  Why?
At present my flotation tank/ bright beer tank is a 120 litre inverted SS cone 
that spins with a washing machine motor. It is thus  a centrifuge that compacts 
anything at the outer circumference. All cold break doesn't float so I give it 
a spin. Ihave designed a dumping device as a test for larger models.

to prevent the last glass from the bottle being cloudy, I intend to centrifuge 
the bottles to compact it, it is a quite simple continuous machine. I have 
given the Cooper's ale yeast  a spin in a 12G homemade rig for a few munutes., 
it worked great. It will clarify your beer well for your competitions! The 
trick is not to burst the yeast cells with centrifical force which can be done 
at high G's.
(Please don't post me for the homemade centrifuge designs, I'll put them in the 
Brewery too.)

Which particular practice Jim, bottle conditioning with a seperate yeast, 
flotation tank, husk seperation? I'd love to know. Their reputation reached me 
in Oz long before I found the HBD.


I still need the answer to my  BIG QUESTION; Will the reducing power of the 
presence of yeast be a 
greater plus in flavour freshness preservation than the possible production of 
off flavours by autolysis or shock excretion from thermal abuse? I don't want 
to spend a year brewing experiments to find out, if expert advice can solve 
this now. What are European bottle conditioning practices?


This whole system is simply a traditional Quality Assurance approach. 
"Eliminate all variables possible by design and control those that can't be 
eliminated" The resources for formulation of recipies and hopping and mashing 
regimes are abundant for the homebrewer. The micro needs to also refine 
execution of technique to achieve consistency. I don't have people like Rob and 
 Jim's extensive  experience in what will have the most impact on quality, so I 
methodically attack each variable. I'm also concerned about fermentation 
byproducts that cause "seediness" and headaches some hours after the flavour 
has been appreciated. Call it after sales service!


Anyone know of literature on bottle conditioning chemistry and problems?

Your concern is very valid.  I have no measured scientific evidence to
prove or disprove whether I have too much O2.  Empirical observation
suggests I am not overoxygenating.  I pitched last night about 5pm,
oxygenated up to 20 psi for about an hour.  Let it sit at 20 psi until
8pm, at which time I released pressure and attached blowoff hose and
bucket.  At 7am this morning I had about 2" of krausen in my blowoff
bucket.  Do *you* think I am harming the yeast?  I have to admit that
I pitched 2 liters of very healthy yeast because this is a Belgain
Strong Ale with an OG of 1.090, if I damaged the yeast with
overoxygenation, I don't believe they would be as active as they are
this morning.


Neal> Dion, you have the stone and the oxygen tank, so why don't you

Just lazy I guess.  I started oxygenating with just the liquid dip
tube and when I got the stone, just using it instead in the same
manner was the easiest thing to do.  At that time, I had not seen Don
Put's in line oxygenator, nor did I have a convenient way of putting
the stone in line.  I still think that would be a ton of work to put
the stone inline.  Frankly, what I am doing right now works
fantastically, so until I run out of things to do, making permutations
is low on my list.


Neal> What advantages do you see in aerating for several hours in the
Neal> fermenting tank?


Over any other method which produces as vigorous ferments as I get,
none, it is a matter of style.  I do not claim my method is the
end-all be-all best way, only *one* excellent way.  Any way which
suits your brewery and style which achieves as good results is fine in
my book.  If your way suits your style and brewery, but does not give
you quick vigorous fermentation, due to under or over oxygenation,
then that is the *only* reason I would say to stay away from it.

Again, whatever is best for you.  The in line tube method works super

I agree that without a time machine it would be impossible to brew
a historically accurate reproduction of and original style (HAROS).
But everything I read in this thread states styles are ARBITRARY.
Would it be impossible for the AHA to formulate a style definition
which would be based on a interpation of historic brewing techniques
and ingredients?  


:Actually, there are some maltsters still producing a product called
:brown malt, Hugh Baird and Great Western among them. This malt has 
:a color rating of about 70L, and I've read it contributes a very 
:sharp, bitter flavor. I am dubious that this product is 
:"historically accurate", since it could not be used as a base malt,
:which brown malt was in original porters.


Hmmm, a sharp bitter flavor... possibly contributing bitterness
missing from aged, oxidized hops, no O2 barrier plastic after all.


:Another difficulty that would be encountered in trying to 
:reproduce an original porter is that the strains of hops specified 
:in documentation of the original recipes no longer exist. The type 
:of yeast used was apparently never documented, and is a complete 
:mystery. I think this example demonstrates the problems with using 
:modern style guidelines as a historical reference.


But aren't our modern British hops descendants of these strains,
some traits should have survived.  Yeast would be an ale strain,
most likely multi-strain, with a warm tempature profile.  The
flavor contribution of the yeast is unknowable but isn't a little
artistic license allowable in our craft?


Possible style guidelines // feel free to embellish
(HAROS) Original Porter style 
Base of 1/2 British pale ale malt,  1/2 Brown malt
Color: Dark brown to black
Flavor: Rich malt flavor with assertive bitterness, malt sweetness
        balanced partially with brown malt bitterness,hop flavor
        low to medimum, oak flavor ok ('twas aged in wood tuns)
        
(HAROS) Original Scotch ale
Base of British / Scottish pale ale malt with some roast barley
and peat smoked malt
Color: Dark red-brown to black
Flavor: High malt flavor, very low hop profile, caramel flavor
        due to kettle caramelization, some peat undertones (after
        all the decline of Scotch ale wasn't from OPEC cutting off
        their supply of natural gas) sweetness due to dextrins,
        some oxidation ok (from rousing the yeast, rolling the
        casks around the courtyard), high alcohol warmth with
        massive body and mouthfeel, low esters and fusels (cold

In HBD #1864 Bruce DeBolt (not Keith Frank) asks about home-toasted malt.


I gave toasting a try last month.  I used two trays on different racks in
the oven.  The top tray came out under-toasted.  I started to burn some
of the grains in the bottom tray.  I separated the unburnt grains from the
burnt grains in tray two and mashed on the same day I toasted.  The unburnt
grains were the color of very dark crystal malt, a lot lighter than
Special-B.  I'd guess somewhere in the mid 100's Lovibond.


The resultant beer is sharply bitter (not a nice bitterness like you get
from hops).  It's the worst beer I've brewed since my first batch (one can
of hopped malt extract, one can of corn sugar, pitch yeast taped to top of
can...).


If I do it again, I'll try toasting the grain a week or so in advance of
brewing and I'll discard entirely a tray of malt that burns at all.

Good Day Brew Collective!


I have some questions regarding brewing techniques.  I have only been 
recently enlightened to the phenomenom known as hot-side aeration.  After 
perusing some of the back issues of the hbd, I believe several of my 
techniques are flawed.  Here are some areas which I have been doing where I 
may be introducing HSA:


1.  Pouring runoff from pitcher to boiling pot.


2.  Filtering the hot wort through a colander with mesh bag to remove hop 
particles.


3.  Placing the fermentor (plastic) in a larger bucket of chilled water. 
(Alas no wort chiller & my next purchase)


A few items I am not clear on are 1) What are the affects of HSA? 2)  What 
can I do to mitigate the effects? 3)  Is there an authoritative source for 
HSA?  (Papazian gave me the ideas for what I am doing now).

Once again a bare footed, tree hugging, pachoulli smellin' liberal 
overreacts because a chemical that is otherwise very beneficial to humans 
is shown to *possibly* have some negative side effects.  Before you go an 
spread such lies you should do a little research, Dan!  My experiences 
have shown DHMO to be very beneficial, if used in the proper 
concentrations. In fact, I will dare to say that I could not make beer 
with out it!  I have also found that it is essential to the healthy 
propogation of yeast.


DHMO can easily and safely be used by the average homebrewer.  While it
can be bought in bottles or even delivered directly to your home, I'm
sure that many of you are gadget freaks and will be interested in hearing
how I make it myself.  It is simply chemistry, but will involve a little
bit of money in the initial setup.  You need to buy a tank of liquid
hydrogen and another of liquid oxygen and hook them up to a standard
combustion chamber.  You then need to build a reservoir for a cooling
liquid (water) to submerge the combustion chamber in.  The hydrogen and
oxygen are mixed in the combustion chamber where they are ignited.  My
experiences have shown that the proper mixing ratio of the two gases is
approximately 2:1 for hydrogen to oxygen. The products of combustion will
produce pure gaseous DHMO, which will then be cooled to its liquid state
by the blanket of cooling water surrounding the combustion chamber.


Have fun with your new gadget!  And as always, be careful playing with 
hydrogen and oxygen, for they can be very dangerous gases!

Well. I've been using Mason jars for about a year now to store yest 
from my primary.  This stuff develops considerable positive pressure 
and , so far, none of my jars have leaked/exploded.  Sure, some of the

I know this mainly due to my unbelievable ability

bottle in whatever pressure vessel looking thing may

        careful to not scratch the SS.  Also, scrape off any large
        deposits of glue.
6)        Remove any residual glue from the rubber and SS with a cloth
        and Goo-Gone or CitraSolve.  
7)        Remove Goo-Gone or CitraSolve with a heavy duty household
        cleaner.
8)        Open and rinse the inside with hot water.
9)        Brush out the interior with a hot water solution of 1 TBS
        TSP per gallon of water and rinse with hot water.  Use a
        nylon bristle brush.
10)        Disassemble, brush out the dip tubes and valve bodies with
        the TSP solution and rinse with hot water.  Again, use a nylon
        bristle brush.
11)        If there are any rust spots on the SS, use an oxalic acid based
        cleaner such as Bar Keeper's Friend or Kleen-King and a 
        Scotch Brite pad to remove the rust.
12)        Rinse everything thoroughly with hot water and let stand in
        the sun to dry. 
13)        If you needed to use an oxalic acid cleaner, store the keg
        inside for a week or two to let the natural oxidaton layer
        reform on the SS.
14)        Wipe the rubber top and bottom with a pure silicone spray
        put on a cloth.
15)        Obtain new O-rings and re-assemble.
16)        Store with the valve bodies and lid loose and a plastic bag
        over the top of the keg to prevent dust from entering.
