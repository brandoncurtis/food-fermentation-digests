Subject: Wheat Beer Yeast Question


Well its my first attempt at an all grain wheat beer this weekend! My wife
and I just spent 1.5 weeks in southern germany and I have become quite a
weisenbier fanatic. Problem is I purchased my ingredients before doing
proper research into the yeast and bought wyeast 3056. The yeast faq seems
to favor wyeast 3068 over 3056. Is my beer ruined? I would appreciate any
advice from those with 3056 experience. TIA

Subject: Heavy CO2 in fershly bottled


First time I have ever experineced this and wondering what to expect if
anything:
Transfered from secondary to bottling bucket to bottle.  While bottling,
each bottle evidenced a GREAT deal of CO2 bubbles and subsequent foam during
bottling.  Fairly certain I maintained the usual "quiet" tranfer ensuring
little aeration/agitation.  Each bottle had a head like it was already well
carbonated...looked ready to drink right then and there by golly; so glad I
restrained (forceably) myself.  
Just curious.

Subject: RE: Washed yeast, Bleach, Ring-around-the-collar 


Hi all,


Tim Fields and Richard Scotty were reporting about using washed yeast: 


I was wondering how long you kept the yeast.  The reason I ask is that I
have washed some yeast about a month ago and I haven't had time to 
use it.  I have heard estimates of 1 week - 1 month for refridgerated, 
washed yeast slurry.  I have a couple of questions: 


1) Whats the longest slurry can be kept and reused, without adverse effects?
2) What happens to the yeast, that causes it to change? It should be dormant
at this point right? and its under sterile water, so there's no beer for
bacteria 
to work on, right?
   
Tim>>Resulting fermentation had a short lag time and is VERY 
Tim>>active, in fact the most active 1056 ferment I've had.
Tim>>I do have one question/observation: this was an all-grain 
Tim>>batch (my first).  Compared to extract or partial mash (and asside
Tim>>from the effects of pitching more yeast), could this higher 
Tim>>fermentation activity be in prt the result of higher FAN levels?   
Tim>>If so, this is IMHO a very good argument for using yeast nutrient
Tim>>(which I never used).


My guess would be that the higher pitching rate produced the greater
kraeusen.
A lower FAN level would play more of an influence in producing a higher final
gravity.  This is just a guess though.


RE: BLEACH 
Gene>>The  man at this store mentioned that you should never use
Gene>> bleach as a cleanser at all becasue it adheres too much to 
Gene>>glass and plastic.  I use a diluted solution, like it says in the
Gene>>Complete Homebrew Guide  
Gene>>Any comments for this young brewmeister?


Unscented Bleach is fine. Its probably the most widely sanitizer in 
homebrewing today for 3 reasons: 1) It works  2) It's readily 
available  3) It's cheap.

I believe Don might be right because of the white spots, but bottle neck 
rings sometimes occur when priming with DME instead of corn sugar.
YMMV.

Subject:       slant inoculation / filtering 


In #1866 Dion asks about the advantages/disadvantages of smearing VS 
embedding the loop into the agar when inoculating a plate with yeast.
Then, in #1868 Tracy responds:


> These are actually two different methods, one is a slant, the other is
> a stab. Stabs tend to remain viable longer but it's easier to get more
> inoculum from a slant. I think slants are more appropriate for yeast
> cultures. 


Disclaimer:  I have never cultured my own yeast and I was previously 
unaware of the stab method.  However, based on my limited experience in a 
college laboratory class and also on explanations from other brewers, here 
is what I understand to be the reasoning behind the slant method.


When you first inoculate the loop, there are a large number of yeast cells 
on the end of the loop.  The loop is then drawn back and forth on the 
surface of the agar plate starting at the outer edge and moving toward the 
center, as if you are shading in a piece of a pie.  As you do this the 
largest number of yeasts will be deposited at the outer edge and less will 
be deposited toward the center.  The loop is then scraped across this 
"shaded area" near the center of the plate so as to pickup some more yeast 
cells on the loop, but less than was picked up the first time.  The agar 
plate is then rotated and another pie wedge area is shaded in.  This 
process is done 3 or 4 times until the whole plate has been inoculated.  


The theory behind the method, as I understand it, is that the last few 
strokes will have so few yeast cells on the loop, that individual cells 
will be deposited, separated from other cells.  These individual cells 
will then grow pure colonies.  The brewer can then look at his plate after 
the colonies have developed and pick out the perfectly circular colonies 
knowing that they came from individual cells.  This helps to eliminate the 
posibility of growing a contaminated yeast colony.  Supposedly colonies of 
"bad" organism would be easy to discern based on appearance and can 
therefore be avoided.
#####################################################################


And now for my question:  Has anyone ever built a simple/inexpensive beer
filter and would they be willing to share the design?


I currently have a keg of beer that I want to put in bottles with a CP
filler, but there is a considerable amount of sediment from polyclar and
gelatin (I forgot to use IM in the boil and had quite a bit of haze I was
trying to settle out).  Everytime I draw a pot, I can see these clearish
particles floating in the glass.  Not good! as I was hoping to bottle this 
beer and give as holiday gifts.


My idea is to force the beer from one keg to another with a filter 
mechanism in line.  Any ideas?  Oh ya, this beer is already carbonated. 
Would this cause a problem during the filtered transfer?

Subject: re: Using a Blowoff hose...good idea?






Gene Rafter <grafter`at`creighton.edu> asks about
>the blowoff method 
described in The Complete Homebrew Guide found any benefit from this 
besides reducing the risk of contamination?


I can't think of any way blowoff would *reduce* the risk of
contamination.  If anything, contamination risk will *increase*
because reused blowoff hoses are hard to clean and can harbor
bacteria.


>when I transfered to a secondary carboy I noticed 
how much I lost.


Another reason I prefer non-blowoff.  Really, it's a matter of
personal preference.  I've read that some of the harshly bitter
hop components oxidize into brown gunk in the kraeusen and that
it should be skimmed, but I haven't found any correlation between
amount of brown gunk and harshness in my homebrew.


Here's what I usually do:
I brew six gallon batches split between two five gallon carboys
for primary fermentation.  I aerate with a venturi "crimped tube
with holes" aeration wand followed by shaking.  I get DO levels
of 8-12 ppm (just kidding, never measured, don't know how).  I
siphon from the two fives into either a six or two threes
depending on whether I'm trying a "split batch" experiment.


The biggest problems I see with my method are that it requires
an extra carboy (not a problem for me, I have 2 5's, 2 6's, and
2 3's) and that it requires a bit more work (sanitizing carboy
number two on brew day and cleaning it on racking day).

Subject: Craft Brewing Beast


I entered the style thread because, in an effort to learn more about excellent 
beers, I was reading hundreds of reviews. I felt these placed too much emphasis 
on conformity.
Since then I have received a private post 
>Re: styles, I've never read anything from you other than complaints about

I had hoped people saw something positive and constructive in what I said. I am 
an outsider to  organized homebrew, very interested  in microbrewing. I will 
answer as an outsider.


Commercial and hobby craft brewing seem different limbs of a strange animal 
indeed. It's a beast really, and the heart of the beast bleeds daily on the HBD!
The hobbyist has no imperatives except enjoyment and goals set by competitions. 
What happens at competitions of homebrewers shouldn't  matter much to the 
health of the Craft Brewing Beast. However as Ken Schroeder  points out, 
homebrewing has enormous influence over the commercial side of the CBB.
> Most pro brewers in this area (SF Bay Area) that I know (and that is quite a

In no other industry I know does the amatuer side so influence the professional.


Well defined styles are essential for homebrew competitions and very useful to 
micros as references for marketing, and educating their market to better 
appreciate their product. The degree of emphasis is another thing. The hobbyist 
tends toward narrow styles and classic styles as that gives an air of 
objectivity and precision to proceedings. The commercial craft brewer has many 
judges who award points through product loyalty, they vote with their glasses. 
His/her ultimate gold medal is a collective subjective judgement. That "can't 
keep my lips of the glass" feeling becomes the only style that matters.
 ( I have just read that Ken calls this "character"or "making a statement",  Al 
calls it "wonderfulness". Hey, we're getting a consensus on technical terms 
here!)
 The health and future of the commercial part of the beast was my main concern. 
I am going to put my money where my mouth is and become a micro soon. If, 
influenced by the homebrew arm, micro brewers and reviewers continually put 
conformance to style on a pedastel, I beleive this will hinder the maturing of 
the industry that looks to homebrewing as its roots. Homebrewing already has 
the evaluation tools and judges, it is a question of emphasis. 
E.G.
1/ The Aussie wine industry now makes a better chardonnay than the French ever 
did. Why? Not because our French winemakers are more talented than theirs. It 
is partly because when their representatives came to Australia and said "you 
can't make champagne, moselle, bordeaux, burgundy, they are *our* classic 
regional styles", we stopped copying the classics. We stopped using second 
grade crush for chardonnays (the best French grape becomes champagne), we 
changed the growing and fermenting techniques in ways that would be scoffed at 
in Reims.
However the result was excellent and the French public are buying it faster 
than we can ferment it. Now Australian winemakers are working in France under 
contract, redefining the style and technique. The classic styles were the dead 
hand of history on progress. Winemaking all over the world has discovered new 
standards and has quite rightly forgotten some styles.(Imagine American craft 
brewers teaching the Germans, Belgians or English new techniques!) 
2/ I can drink 2 litres of a very good beer and enjoy myself. Another occasion, 
1 bottle of a different very good beer will make me violently ill the next day. 
I would love to scientifically define the hidden quality that my body is a 
litmus test for? Quality has other dimensions we now ignore.
3/ The Australian Ad Agencies organization loved to promote their annual awards 
for what they thought were great advertisments. Much fanfare and glory. One 
heretic, John Singleton, pointed out that in the last 3 years, of the 21 *top* 
TV and print ads, 16 agencies had lost that client! (way over normal agency 
rotation) The ads were not working in the real world! The awards were a false 
standard of excellence for the real world of selling things.


I would love to see the craft brewing industry challenge wine in the fine 
drinking market. To do that requires an emphasis on Quality Assurance, 
development and marketing.  All craft breweries are quite rightly flogging the 
personality aspect of their business to the max, it is one of their sustainable 
competitive advantages in marketing against industrial beer. Their QA 
techniques seem to be getting better, forced on them by an unstable process. 
But if we emphasis copying styles and give them great prominence in evaluating 
micros, then I beleive the CBB will not evolve as rapidly as it should. It will 
be in danger of becoming a sort of stuffed animal in a beer museum. 
The industry is on a high in the USA at present, it has barely started here. 
When the competition hots up, the CBB will experience a little brewing 
Darwinism. What styles will emerge?

I tried making cereal once. I spread enough of the grains out on a cookie
sheet to thinly cover the bottom. I sprinkled brown sugar over the top and
baked in the oven until dry, stirring occasionally. I sampled a pinch or two
that evening and decided that it was good enough to save for our family
breakfast next morning. 


The family didn't agree. No one even wanted to try it and I determined that
the beers I drank while brewing must have affected my judgement the night
before. Not one to waste anything, I pressed on. After pouring in the milk
and taking a big spoonful into my mouth, I realized that those people who
make the health food cereal must use more than husks and hulls. Although the
cereal was tasty (like brown sugar mostly), it took quite a while to get
what was in my mouth to a consistency where I felt comfortable swallowing.
My next spoonful was somewhat smaller and the following spoonful was my last. 


I haven't given up on the cereal idea and am planning to try again soon,
although a little differently. One positive aspect of this cereal is that
you won't need to brush you teeth in the morning after eating this. You
will, however, spent the next half hour flossing. Better stock up on
toothpicks.

The problem is that you racked and left behind in the first vessal
the bulk of the pitched yeast.  This is one of the main reasons I never
suggest to brewers that they rack off the cold trub.

 .................and I promise not to use large caps.............


Speaking of large caps, I like to bottle in champagne
bottles.  With a snazy label, it makes a great gift (with
Christmas right around the corner).  Consiquently I buy
inexpensive champagne for the bottle.  I'm always sure to
check if it has the characteristic lip that indicated a bottle that
can be sealed with a crown cap.  I came across a sale on a
champagne that came in a heavy green bottle that looked
built to hold 100psi.  When I came around to bottling, the caps
i used were too small for the bottle (so much for industry standards).
The question for the collective is; do crown caps come in larger
sizes and if so where do i get some???

Jim says:

Are these really "complex" sugars? I believe all the sugars listed above are
actually simple unfermentable sugars. Perhaps the trisaccharides can be
considered complex, although that would be pushing the definition a bit, but
mono and disaccharides are certainly not complex sugars; complex implies
that they're polymers (or at least oligomers). Part of the problem may be
the fact that the term sugar is often used rather loosely to describe any
and all carbohydrates, including starches.

On another note, I have been trying to follow the 40/60/70

In my Papazian/Miller library I find the recommended temperature for
the protein rest 122-135 or somewhere in between.  Personnally, I have
been using a rest at 131 F to increas head retention and cut down on
chill haze.  What's the benefit of 104F?  Also, what about the 60C
(140F) rest?  That's supposed to be the high end of the protein rest
and the optimal temp for beta-amylase activity.  Are these the two aims
of this rest?
Also, since there are many types of malt available, I would like to see
discussions of mash temps include a blurb about what types of malt
a particular mash-schedule is suited for.  Just a few thoughts.

A group of us who are opening a new homebrew supply shop have decided to

information from all of the usual suspects like Custom Brew and The Brew
Store who put these systems together. Unfortunately, they are pretty

that they had bought their system used from a place in Ontario that had gone
out of business.  Which brings me to the point of my posting.  Does anyone
know of a facility going out of business?  Or if not, could everyone keep
their ear to the ground for anyplace that may be going out of business?  I

In HBD 1864 Ken Schroeder responds to Rich Scotty about AOB, AB, Miller,
Budswilloors, $$$ etc.  I'm sorry but I take exception to this kind of big three
bashing.  The big three still provide more beer to more people than 'Craft
brewers'.  So how can AOB ignore their niche?  I ask the collective: how many of
you submitted American Lager to the competition only to have it mysteriously
disappear?


You want cynicism?  I live in Boulder Colorado and although I haven't been to
all the GABF's, I gone to most of them.  Back in the 80's we remember when Sam
Adams had the ladies in black danskins handing out hats, pins and shirts within
the confines of the GABF.  The theme: vote for Sam Adams!  The next year a
friend of mine got free tickets to GABF.  I asked where he got the tickets: "I
dunno, alls I know is that my friend who scored them said we had to vote for Sam
Adams."  That year the GABF banned the distribution of 'premiums' (those
freebies).  It didn't matter, the shrewdness of Jim Koch had the distribution
points moved to the parking lot and they hit people as they went into the hall.
SA won again.  Good beer, but come on.  Ken says "...Give'm medals to adorn
corporate headquarters",  different tactic - same result, no? 


I get the feeling sometimes that  we beersnobs (I admit it) think that the world
would be a better place if the big three disappeared today, or that we'd sooner
be dead than drink that swill.  What do you do when you're in BF Egypt and all
that they sell is that stuff?  


And its all relative, I remember 15 years ago I was on a train in California.  I
met a couple of British guys in the bar car.  They were drinking Budweiser (not
much choice).  I asked them what they thought of American beer.  "Its like
water"  "Yeah", I said, "in some circles it's universally disliked, imports
preferred.  What beer is widely disliked in Britain?"  "Watneys", they replied,
"It's plastic beer, nothing but chemicals, total rubbish!"


Look at what's happening in Germany.  Hell, there's only one operating brewery
left in Kulmbach they've all been bought out by the German biggies.  What's this
world coming to?


The big three have a hard time satisfying everybody all the time.  That's OK, if
they did, many of us might not spent as many late nights removing trub, wort
chilling, worrying etc.  Who of us wouldn't give our left gonad to have the
quality and consitency of the biggies?  They're here to stay, and I don't
understand why their presence irritates so many.

I think the attempt to roast or kiln malts at any temperature
approaching 375F is misguided.  'Malting and Brewing Science' by
Briggs et al., is a bit vague about some aspects of the process, but
does state that after drying the grain ... "In 'traditional' malting
the temperatures attained in curing will be about 80-105C(176-221F)
for pale malts or 95-105C(176-221F) for dark malts." [vol I, pp 176].
Times aren't stated but from the detailed description of old style
kiln units I would expect it to take many hours.


In Dave Miller's 'CHoHB' chapter 30, he creates Vienna and Munich
style malts by kilning pale grain in an oven at 212F - 225F (100-107C)
for three hours.  Obviously if you want something around 100L it will
take longer.  I tried Miller's method years ago w/o any off odors.


I suspect Rich is correct about the husk being a major source of the
problem. It's probably not from the starches based on experience
baking bread (mostly wheat starch) at similar temperatures and time.
The bread crust reaches oven temperature and certainly doesn't exhibit
any foul odors.

Hello All,


We've had several iodophor-related postings of late, some of which talk 
about rinsing vs not rinsing.  Some say rinse, some say they don't.  
Seems to me that the bottle I have indicates that you can *drip dry* (or 
words to that effect) without rinsing.  Big difference between using a 
WET non-rinsed item and a DRY non-rinsed item.  I always rinse because I 
never have the time to let it dry and I'm concerned about 1) iodophor 
flavored beer, and 2) sanitizing (aka killing) my yeast with any wet 
iodophor residue.


I could save a good bit of bottle sanitizing time if I eliminated the 
rinse step and just took them directly from the iodophor soak to the 
dishwasher (for heat cycle to dry them).  Would doing this risk 
iodophor-flavored beer or sanitized yeast-in-the-bottle?

Subject: Re: Fischer d'Alsace and french 


In regards to recipe formulation for a Fischer clone, well, I hope this
information will get you off on the right foot.


Alsace-Lorraine borders on the southern portion of Germany, and in many
ways the style of beer brewed there is similar to a German Alt.    
The main difference I can find is that Fischer seems to be somewhat higher in
alcohol content, and is hopped at a lower rate.  I tried brewing a clone of
this myself for about six months or so; I personally found it very
difficult to get the hop flavor of the original, and my beer had a lower
attenuation and more malty character due to the yeast (or methods) that I
used.  I eventually came up with a very nice mild brown, which tasted
nothing like the Fischer, but which suited my personal pallette so well
that I kept on brewing it.


YMMV, of course, so don't assume the style is hard to duplicate.  The
beers of this region have a lot to recommend them, so I wish you every
luck in your endeavor to duplicate them.

A ring around the neck _often_ signals an infection, but you (and beer
judges) should not make an automatic assumption about such things.
Priming with DME is said to cause a ring, stray hop particles in a dry
hopped beer can float to the top of the liquid and cause a ring, fruit or
spiced beers may also have bits of things that can float and adhere to the
neck, et cetera. Not aesthetically pleasing, perhaps, but not a guaranteed
infection either.  If you found that none of the bottles was bad, then you
ought to know....  There's no reason to find it suspect; lots of things can
make rings.  (It is, of course, always good to make sure you're being sanitary
anyway)

Subject: Chlorine Bleach


On the subject of bleach:  It's still the BEST and MOST ECONOMICAL sanitizer
for general purpose use in the home brewery.  The advantages of bleach over
the other sanitizers out there for sanitizing non-metallic items pretty much
outweigh the disadvantages.  Bleach is cheap, available anywhere, and does
the job extremely well.  Bleach also rinses off most equipment with warm
water; this only becomes a disadvantage if the bacteriological content of
your water is suspect (with Iodaphors you can air-dry without rinsing, but
Iodaphor is about six times as expensive as bleach).  Bleach is also an
excellent cleaner and dissolves organic matter, which most other sanitizers
don't do.  Disadvantages of bleach are mostly related to it's corrosive
tendencies, especially with respect to chrome-plated metal (like on pin-lock
hose disconnects) and copper (NEVER use bleach to sanitize copper items).  It
also can discolor hoses (makes them milky colored) if left in contact for
long periods.


I use bleach throughout my brewery, and only use Iodaphor for sanitizing my
copper wort chiller.  Even when cleaning/sanitizing my stainless kegs, I use
bleach (hot water + bleach+ TSP for cleaning; 3/4 cup bleach in 5 gallons
warm water for sanitizing) because I don't leave it in contact for more than
an hour.  In other words, for sanitizing carboys, hoses, bottles, and other
non-metallic items, bleach is hard to beat.  I've found the 3/4 cup of bleach
(5.25% hypochlorite strength) to five gallons works best, even though this is
overkill - with this concentration you can let the bucket of solution sit all
day without worrying about it losing strength.  If you use too much bleach it
won't work as well - "too much" is when it feels slippery between your
fingers - you need to add more water.

Subject: Labels and Bulging Cans


B-Brite sanitizer is by far the best method of getting rid of ALL labels,
including the metallic ones.  It dissolves the metal in the label, thereby
allowing the glue to be dissolved.  Of course, it destroys the label in the
process, so don't use it on any you want to save.  It's important if you use
B-Brite on metal labels to NEVER allow the B-brite and metal-particle
solution get INSIDE the bottle - otherwise the metal particles will coat the
inside of the bottle, rendering it useless.


My process is to fill a 5-gallon bucket 1/3 full with hot water, add about
three heaping tablespoons of B-Brite, and dissolve.  I'll fill the clean
bottles with hot water and stand them up in the bucket, which raises the
level.  When all are added I'll top up the bucket water until it's just above
the neck label, but well below the top of the bottle.  The labels will start
to come off in about 10-15 minutes.  Use a dishwashing sponge (abrasive side)
when rinsing the bottle to remove the last of the crud.  And don't throw the
used solution down the drain (unless you want to keep your plumber busy)!


On bulging extract cans:  I've had this happen occasionally and it's not
Botulism.  It means the extract is getting old and some delayed reactions are
taking place in the can.  You can still brew with it, but you'll get that
classic "extract" twang in the flavor, the taste that judges invariably mark
down (way down) as a flaw.  So if you don't mind that awful "extract" taste,
 it'll still make drinkable beer.  Just make sure the can hasn't been
punctured; don't use a dented can that bulges.  Best advice is to throw it
away and brew with fresh ingredients - or use it to make yeast starters.


Prosit!

Subject: Sparge Water Heater; N.A. Beer


****In-Line Sparge Water Heating:


The suggestion of using a hetart to heat sparge water in-line is intriguing.
 I might suggest something along the lines of a water-heater immersion
element in a copper pipe or a hot-water-compatible plastic pipe (ensuring the
element doesn't touch the sides!).  Some sort of temeprature control would be
necessary; a thermostat or simple manual operation.  Size the pipe to get the
temperature rise and volume desired.  A truly in-line or "real-time" system
would probably require a small-diameter pipe to heat the cool inlet water
quickly.  Again, temperature control seems tricky, especially since the
element will have significant thermal mass compared with the (small amount
of) water.


****Non-Alcoholic Beer:


I read an interesting apporach concerning Non-Alcoholic beer production, I
believe off a link from The Brewery's (http://alpha.rollanet.org) technical
article category.  It suggests heating the beer to only about 100F, and using
a vacuum pump to extract the alcohol, since its vapor pressure is so much
lower than water's.  What about hop volatiles?  The article suggests some
reduction in hop character but not total, meaning (I assume) that one could
simply increase the "hop bill" at brew-time to compensate.  The advantage of
this apprach is the elimination of the "cooked taste" associated with heat
de-alcoholization (is that really a word?).  Thought it was a good idea.
