Hi all
  I wanted to thank everybody for all the replys on my extract dillema.  
When I feel lazy (I'm a dedicated all-grain brewer/snob) I think I'll go 
ahead and slap those cans along with a fair amount of crystal and 
chocolate malt into a pot and see what happens.  Hey what the hell, its 
just sitting there and it won't cost me much.
  Thanks again for all the advice,
  I'll let you guys know what happens with it

Subject: WYeast 2112 responses


Thanks for all the rapid responsesabout my woes concerning ferment temp for
WYeast California Common yeast (#2112) Anchor steam attempt.  Bottom line of
responses was  ferment around 60 degrees (response range: 50-65 degrees).
Interestingly, I had the temp maintained at 50 degrees for 2 days....nothing
happened.  I slowly raised to 60 degrees for 1 days....nothing happened.  I
then slowly raised to 65 degrees....she took off!  I dont know what this
means aside from next time I will try at 65 degrees right off :^)   Those
who responded touting success at 55 degrees: whats the trick/magic touch!
Prost to one and all......

Subject: Electro-boil in the basement




  I thought I'd chip in my $0.02 about electric boiling.  I have a
2200W rangetop element that I bought for $15 from a local appliance
store (used).  I installed it into a box made out of 2x4's with angle
irons on top to support the element's metal pan.  To control the
current, I wired a heavy-duty relay inside the box, whose coil is
connected to a small phone jack on the outside of the box.  The main
power comes from a 220V dryer cord.  All of the dangerous 220V stuff
is sealed inside the box during operation, and some aluminum foil
covers the angle irons on top to prevent wort boil-overs from getting
into the box (of course, my wort never boils over anyway :)).
The system is pretty nice, because I can toggle the power myself, or
let some electronics outside the boiler do the temperature control.
What I found was that for boiling (I do a full wort boil on 5-7
gallons) I need about 45 minutes to reach a full boil if I start with
cold tap water (extract recipe).  This is longer than a big outdoor
propane burner requires, but it is safe (I think the propane probably
is too, if used with caution) and easy to control.  The bottom line
is, though, that 2200W is about the minimum you can get away with and
still have enough power to bring the wort to a good rolling boil. So
the 120V/15A elements are probably not worth the effort (separate
circuits, etc) because you'll just be frustrated with the lack of
heating power.  YMMV.

This message is not really about beer, although the word beer
will appear twice in this sentence.  I am not usually a stickler
for proper spelling, but one frequent error is worth mentioning.


"Frig" is not an app;liance, it is an activity.  The word you
want is "fridge".  Related words are refrigerator and
refrigerated.  :-)

Enlighten me, oh great collective--what does it take to start a contract brew 
(besides a good beer)?  Just the bare facts--cost, time invested, need of 
marketing experience, etc.  No need for great details.   Just curious, after

Subject: Airlock Fluid/Sanitizing Bottle Caps






I use 100 proof vodka in my airlocks and for sanitizing bottle
caps.  It's not as cheap as bleach, but it can't spoil beer in
case an airlock suffers a suck back.  It's easy to use, and
doesn't need rinsing or air drying.  BTW, I use iodophor for
most of my other sanitizing jobs because of the ease of not
having to rinse.  The only time I use bleach is when I run my
bottles through the dishwasher, and I let it do the rinsing.


Brew on!

Subject: water quality in Oakland/Berkeley (CA) area


In #1872,  Novices`at`piniecki.haas.berkeley.EDU enquired about his local
water quality.
I' m in San Jose so can't comment on East Bay water but suggest you
(anyone) call your
local water company. You may be pleasently surprised with the response. I
called the Santa Clara County Water Dist. and was put through to the lab
where a chemist spent 20 minutes on the phone with me. He then gave me the
name and number of a chemist for San Jose Water who is the actual
distributor (they buy from the county) so I could find out the percentage
of ground water vs. surface water my particular neighborhood is getting.
This naturally has an impact on hardness levels. My water tastes great with
no hint of clorine. I do boil everything, however, just to be safe.


If I had to guess, Oakland/Berkeley probably has excellent water from a
purity standpoint and probably not as hard as the South Bay which is
predominantly ground water (from aquafiers).
It may come from the hetch-hetchy (sp?) reservoir in the Sierra's which is
where SF get's their water. This is run-off from the Yosemitie area snow
pack. There are worse places to get your water.  Then again, I could be
wrong.

Subject: yeast preserving


Hi.
Sorry about the previous message, I forgot to enter a subject.


Just a note on storing yeast in the fridge. Someone mentioned they had some
trouble with autolysis after washing yeast. I must disagree with the yeast
faq on storing yeast on water in the fridge. In my experience they are not
very happy being stored this way, they much prefer wort or beer. This
provides both nutrients and a more natural osmotic environment.
So try storing in a bottle of wort (but use an airlock!). Even ale yeasts
will work slowly around 5C or so (I have some 3944 bubbling away now at this
temp). It will enable storage for much longer than using water.

Subject: Re: kettles - scorching hops?




  In HBD #1873, Don wrote about his boiler setup. He uses a Sanke keg with
inverted bottom, a manifold connected to the tap and an electric heating
element. I do not know anything about problems with inverting the bottom,
but I have some other questions.
  I am planning to do something similar but was afraid that the heating
element would scorch the hops. For this reason I have been thinking of
using a false bottom instead, sitting _above_ the element, to prevent hops
from reaching the element.
  Have you had any problems with this, Don? And by the way, what kind of
element are you using? Another problem I am thinking of is how to drill/saw
the holes for the element and the tap and making the seals tight.
  Thanks for any help!

Subject: Propane vs. Natural Gas


I'm sorry, but I simply can't let a half-truth go unchallenged. Although it
is true that Propane is heavier than air and therefore pools on the ground,
so does Natural Gas. Both gasses are heavier than air, and both have the
potential to pool. 


Could someone familiar with the relative molecular weights post the
densities of air, propane, and natural gas. Is propane really that much
heavier than natural gas?


The reason the tanks say not to use them indoors is mainly to keep the
manufacturer from getting sued. Just like the warning on ladders not to
stand on the top step which I do all the time, and I've NEVER fallen off a
ladder.


Sorry for all my ranting of late,

I use a 1 gal apple cider jug to build my starters - works fine for 
building up yeast.  However, I do not pour off the clear liquid/spent 
beer before each addition.  I do let each additon pretty much ferment out 
before adding the next addition.  I only pour off the clear liquid when 
ready to pitch.  Make sure to aerate each wort addition before adding to 
the jug.

Did you smak it and let it swell first?  did you build a starter?  I 
believe (memory only-havent used lager yeast) that lagers start slower, 
and also that one should pitch at higher rates than for ale yeast.


>Now, 36 hours later, I have not seen one bubble work its

More is always better. Std rule of thumb for ale is to pitch 1 to 10 - 
for 5 gal, this translates to the slurry from a 2 qt starter (.5 gal).  
In practice, most HBDers I've communicated with say that 1 qt is fine 
(mental averaging here - no flames please). For your lager, I would use 
the 2 qts - or more.


Also-did you aerate the wort before pitching?

I replaced the Gott valve with a standard bottling spigot, had to cut          
the outer wall of the gott so the spigot is now a bulkhead fitting             
up against the inner wall, sealed with Dow-Dap on the inside for               
absolute liquid proof seal.  The opening of the spigot on the inside           
accepts a ? dia hose (sorry, I'm at work and don't have my notes)              
The standard size hose from my Phils Phalse Bottom then snugs inside           
this hose (well, the last 2 inches anyways), works great, and comes            
out pretty easily for cleaning.                                                
                                                                               
                                                                               
  >2)Are there any good ways of insulating the lid?  I would be neat

By all means, remove the plastic "bung" from the inside and use the            
spray foam, it takes a while to cure in an enclosed space, but it              
will eventuall set.  Don't worry about the foam oozing out of the              
hole, that's natural and can be broken off after it cures.  The                
insulating effect is tremendous!  I had to spray the foam 2 or 3               
times, aiming the nozzle in different parts to get complete                    
coverage, I'm not sure if this is normal or not, but it worked!                
                                                                               
                                                                               
  >3)How can I monitor the temp inside the cooler w/o opening the lid?         
                                                                               
Well, you could buy a good compost thermometer, they usually have an           
18" stem, find one that you can calibrate, and CALIBRATE it first.             
Then poke a small hole in the lid, dead canter and slide the stem              
through the foam and the soft bung on the inside, you can then check           
the temps at different levels, mine has a 1.5" dial, easy to read.

I've been using bleach for years now (with at least 3 rinses).  One of the 
reasons I like it (besides the cost) is that it's a powerful sterilizer 
but it's still biodegradable (or so it says on the side of the Javex bottle).

Subject: Gott Spigot Construction




Several posts have indicated problems with construction of the Gott 
mash/lauter tun.
While not an expert in this, I can relate what I've found to be the quickest 
and easiest
construction technique; perhaps not the cheapest.


Buy a plastic spigot from your homebrew store that's used at the bottom of 
bottling
buckets.  Threaded, plastic nut, red handle and outlet that fits 3/8" 
tubing.  Also buy a
number 2 rubber stopper.   You will need some FDA approved Silicone Caulk 
(any
hardware store).


For the false bottom I used the Phils Phalse bottom, but an Easymasher 1/4" 
copper
tube and screen will work also.


Remove the Gott (mine was the 10gal) spigot assembly.  In order to get the 
new plastic
spigot assembly in place, I had to ream out the opening just a little with 
my Dremel tool.
The new spigot assembly was put in place and sealed with the FDA Silicone 
Caulk prior
to tightning down the nut.  This is allowed to cure overnight.


To connect the Phalse Bottom to the spigot on the inside, I got a piece of 
1/4" copper tube
about 5" in length and connected this to the Phalse Bottom with a 1/2" piece 
of plastic 3/8"
tubing as a more or less permanent assembly.  The #2 stopper is then placed 
over the
copper tube and this goes into the plastic spigot of the Gott.   The same 
concept could be
applied to the Easymasher assembly as well.


For sparging, I bought the rotating sparge assembly (Phils?), drilled an 
appropriate hole in
the Gott lid and mounted it in place.  A thermometer is also permanently in 
place via a small
hole about 3" above the spigot so I can read the mash temperture without 
taking the lid off.
I've not noticed any appreciable temperture loss during a one hour mash.


Good luck to those that use this; it works for me.

Eric writes regarding NA beer by the heating method:

>otherwise good (if not great) beer.


Eric - if you can search HBD look for Nov. 1994-Jan. 1995 for a lot of 
posts on this topic.


I've tried the heating method and can verify by gas chromatography analysis 
that it definitely makes low alcohol beer.  You have to reduce the beer 
volume significantly, 30% or more, to get below the 0.5% legal definition of 
no-alcohol.  Regarding flavor - I agree with Al Korzonas who mentioned 
losing fruitiness.  Some (perhaps all) of the aromatics will be driven off.  
BUT - if you just want something better than commercial NA beer I think 
this is still a good method.  The person I made it for (pregnant at the 
time) was very pleased compared to her other options.  Heating does affect 
the flavor, but I don't think it "totally trashes" it.  


There is another technique which avoids these problems but still has a few 
of its own.  I have the original posts at home but the summary is:
 - Pour beer into a PET bottle, attach cap
 - Turn upside and place in the freezer for 1-2 days
 - Gently open the cap and allow the small amount of liquid to drain
 - Attach a Carbonator(R) cap and pressurize with CO2 tank
   OR add yeast and priming sugar and bottle (be careful about sanitation)


One precaution - the liquid may gush out when the cap is cracked open.


The author stated that this made excellent flavored beer.  The drawbacks 
were removal of some hop bitterness and body.  The recommended solution was 
to use a beer with higher bitterness and body than normal.


I haven't tried it but it sounds like a good technique.  By the end of the 
year I should have something to report on the alcohol level by this method.


In Al Korzonas' response to Eric:
>I would recommend dryhopping after removing the alcohol to put back
>some kind of aroma.


My limited understanding is that dry hopping is an alcohol extraction 
process.  If the alcohol is removed or significantly reduced, will this 
work?  Or is dry hopping not due to alcohol extraction of hop aromatics?  
Another option would be to use aromatic hop extract, you could dose each 
glass according to preference.

Subject: Falsies in M/L tuns


Spencer noted that the Pico Brewing Systems tun has a gallon of dead space
beneath the false bottom and experiences no scorching problems:


I do tend to believe that the larger volume helps with circulation during
heating but I think the fact that the Pico systems have pumps and forced
recirculation is the big key.


Both Don Put and I have manifolds in our M/L Tuns and we stir the mash during
heating to prevent scorching. I hand stir mine, Don uses his Binford Mashmixer
6000. 


I would be willing to draw the conclusion that it is *necessary* to have forced
recirculation in conjunction with a false bottomed M/L tun to prevent scorching
during heating. One idea that I have had (as have others), is to put a central
pipe down thru the grainbed to the false bottom which act like the pipe in a
coffee perculator. Perhaps you would need a floating ball valve in the pipe to
encourage one way flow to the top of the grainbed...

last month.  They are:


1)Hunter-Gatherer Brewpub - small very cozy place that serves English-style
ales and porters.  The porter, I found was the best.


2)Columbia Brewing Company - large brewpub and restaurant.  They have a
couple of ale and a porter and I think they're working on a weizen.  Also
serve large selection of micros in the area.


3)Vista Brewing Company - Haven't been there yey, but it's right around
the corner from Columbia B.C.




Rumor has it another will be opening within a year.  Not bad for city of
less than 100,000.  More brewpubs than Atlanta or Washington,D.C.

I have to take exception to the above numbers. First, 3/4 cup of bleach
 to 5 gal is *way* too much ... about 1/3 cup/5 gal yields about 250ppm 
chlorine according to my chlorine papers. I'd say I get at least 
50 x 5gal = 250 gallons of chlorine water from a 64oz jug of 79 cent 
bleach (on sale, stock up). It doesn't get any cheaper than that.
I use iodophor for my stainless toys. The bottle directions call for 
1 oz./5gal for a 25ppm conc. (or was that 12.5? I'm doing this by memory,
always dangerous). This does not translate to 350 gal of sanitizer, 
more like 150. But with iodophor, who says that you have to *fill* the 
container with solution. I mix only a gallon and just swish the solution 
around for a minute or so. Contact time is short enough that I believe
just coating the surfaces suffices. This method really stretches the
iodophor. 
I won't argue for either since I use bleach for glass/plastic and iodophor for 
stainless.

One of my most commonly used yeast is the wy1007 german ale.  i like it
a lot for english ales and kolsch.  the only problem is clearing.  
I have fermented it in closed systems only (6.5g glass and keg).   
I just got the latest book by Miller and he mentioned that 1007 is 
listed as a good flouclator.
He aslo says that they don't tell you that it flouclates into a thick
pancake on the top and if it isn't skimmed it drops back through leaving
lots of particles in suspension.  This is exactly my experience.
In this case the 'sick to the sides' method doesn't work.
Now i'm in the market for a sutible vessil for open fermentation.
So i guess my point is that blowoff tube or 6.5 carboy or open fermenter
choice realy depends on the characteristics of the yeast.  I think
that if i used a 5 gallon carboy with a blowoff tube with a 5g batch using 
1007 to start i would end with about 3 gallons.  1007 gets rather active.

Subject: RE: Starter Bottle Geometry, Can Openers, Volumous Blow-offs


Hi Everyone!


I can't offer any comment on HBD discussions on Yeast lot contamination, but
have an observation on my experience with starters.  I use about 12-18 ounces
of hopped wort (saved from a previous batch), and used Yeast #1056 saved and
washed also from a previous batch.  I have noticed that when the starter is
made in a 1.5 liter Champagne bottle, there is more krausen  (a healthier
starter?) then when a 1 gal wine bottle is used (little to no krausen).  My
guess is that the low volume of started is affected by the geometry of the
bottle it sits in, similar to the effects of the fermentation tank geometry
mentioned by George Fix in an earlier HBD post.
                                     * * * * * * *
I was wondering if anyone has difficulties opening extract cans with their can
openers.  I don't know if its a problem with my can opener, but I usually have
no problems with other cans.  The can opener will skip a few places on the
can, which has forced me to use my trusty Swiss Knife to free the lid so I can
pour the extract into the brew pot.  I believe that soaking the can in warm
water for 5 minutes (to soften the extract) is the cause.  Any comments?
                                     * * * * * * *
My last item is with volumous blowoffs.  I have been averaging between 2/3-3/4
gallon of blowoff on each of my past 5 batches.  I brew Ales, ferment in 5 gal
carboys, 1" blowoff tubes, use Yeast #1056, basement temperature (69-75
degrees F), and don't rack the wort off the hops or hot/cold break for
fermentation.  I never had such large blowoffs with my first 40 batches over
the past 2 years.  So what's going on, and what can I do to reduce the volume
of lost beer?
Since I'm not happy about loosing so much potential beer, I've been
experimenting with saving the stuff.  After the blowoff finishes, I transfer
the blowoff into 1 gal wine jugs with airlocks, then transfer to secondary 1
gal wine jug, and bottling after a few weeks.  I've tried a few of the bottles
so far and haven't yet decided if this is worth the effort.  The two I've
tried were a little more bitter and thinner (less body) than the bottled beer
from the batch.  I expect to decide to continue this procedure after some more
samples (unless someone has an idea on how to loose less ... other than use 
a 6 1/2 gal carboy :^) ).  I'll post _my _definitive_ results :^)

GRAVITY OF BOTTLED BEER:  I just bottled a Kolsch, and I was very eager to

So I figure I'll just take a gravity reading of the bottled product.  Any

Beware cardamon!  I added 2 tsp. of cardamon seeds to a 5 gal. batch a

where I could drink it, but no one else would.  If you've ever tasted those

But you don't need that high a concentration at all, except maybe for
removing labels or some other heavy duty cleansing operation.  Papazian
recommends something like 1/2 tsp. per 5 gal.  I err on the side of safety
and add about 1-2 tbsp. per 5 gal., as does another brewing buddy.  We
haven't had any problems with sanitation at that rate.

different, so mine is just another data point. 


After all, you *can* still buy WonderBread(tm).  It is just that with more
educated bread consumers, fewer are willing to put up with it.  And you 
can't easily make that style at home, either.  Hopefully, it won't take too 
long for the beer consumers to be as unwilling as bread consumers to put up 
with bland, texture-free products (and maybe reduce market share from 98% to
well below 50%).  Not that anything you can buy in the supermarket is as 
good as bakery or home-made bread, but at least it is moving away from 
WonderBread.

Has anyone tried to put together a "Sanitizer FAQ"?  I seem to have read 
stuff along those lines, probably from beginner advice or general brewing 
FAQs.  Probably worth pulling out separately.


Anyway, one of the big lessons for me many years ago was learning how to 
sanitize properly with bleach.  Tips I picked up on the HBD.


Basically, it boiled down to (yes, pun intentional) using the minimum amount
of bleach needed to achieve on the order of 200 ppm chlorine.  And making 
sure everything was clean first (no organics, for example).  Then, I *drain*
all the liquid, let the drops settle, drain again, and let air-dry for ten 
minutes or so.  The result?  Not enough chlorine to affect the batch.  Never
any chlorine problems.


For those who worry, one 12-oz. can of cheap megabrew (which friends 
probably brought over before they knew you wouldn't stoop to drinking it) 
can effectively rinse a 6.5 gallon carboy--just swirl it around.

Subject: "Old" smack-packs


Dear Friends, I am a little bemused at the spate of posts recently 
that characterize Wyeast packs dated in September 1995 as "old".  
Here in Oz, I have never seen a Wyeast pack younger than about two or 
three months, and many at six months or older.  No problems from anyone 
I know.  My own personal experience is limited because I have bought 
only about 8 of them, and inoculated slants from there on.  But 
Wyeast packs are used extensively in our club, and to my knowledge 
none of the problems discussed here, attributed to this "age", have 
come up often enough to warrant mention.  If you want long travel 
distances and potential heat during handling & shipping, I think we 
take the cake!  This is not to say that a particular lot of 1056 
might not have been a problem; that's a separate issue.  Just some 
observations from Down Under.


Cheers, Dave in Sydney

Does anyone have a copy of the Sept/Oct 1994 issue of Brewing

Dan,


I used a bruheat for about 1 1/2 yrs before I got a propane cooker and 
an old keg. It worked well because at the time I had limited space. 
You have to stirr frequently or else the mash heats unevenly. You 
also need a 220 volt outlet. If you have an electric dryer you 
probably have one. I also boiled in it also, but once I picked it up 
by the metal handle while it was hot and the spigot popped out 
pouring hot wort onto my feet. (Ouch!)  


If you have the room I would use a different method for brewing, but 
if space is limited it is a good option.

Subject: oil bath kettle


In order to avoid scortching of mash or sweet wort I have considered steam
heating and decided it is too difficult for me to engineer.


I am considering immersing the bottom of the kettle/tun in an oil bath
and then applying the gas flame directly to the bottom of the oil bath.
That should (I hope) provide me with most of the benefits of a steam 
jacket without the engineering challenge necessary to make make a
steam jacket both workable and safe.


Any thoughts and criticisms of the idea would be greatly appreciated.
TIA

Hi guys!
So what's all this stuff about hot water tanks being bacteria breeding
grounds? I have my hot water thermostat set at 65C, which will knock off all
but a few thermophilic lactobacilli, no? Hot water should be less
contaminated than the cold water that feeds it, so if your cold water is OK,
why shouldn't your hot water be? It's not as if I go pouring malt extract
into my tank or anything like that: there's not much to encourage bacterial
growth anyway - low oxygen levels, no food *and* high temps. I guess the
heat would drive off the chlorine, but surely it's done its job by then? Or
am I missing something else?
