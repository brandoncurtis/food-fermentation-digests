Hello All,


Posters are asking about converting Gott coolers. Following are two posts 
from LT Alan D Czeszynski <czesz`at`nadn.navy.mil> Dated Sept 20 and 18, 
1995 that I saved.  The first is a followup post to his original that 
contains a slight design modification.  The second is the original.  
Since Alan hasnt posted, I hope his design didnt fall apart ;-)


++ Alan: how's your Gott working?


Subject: Gott Cooler Conversion - Bung Design Follow-Up


     I was reminded by fellow HBD reader Joe Passante that the
     flexible tube I was originally
     going to run from the elbow to the bung gets very pliable
     when hot, and chances are it would collapse under the weight
     of the mash.  So I've re-engineered my design to include a
     hard plastic tube between the elbow and the bung.  Since the
     elbow is about 1/3 inch higher than the bung opening, I had
     to ensure some compliance at each end of the hard tube.  I
     felt that if I straight-lined the hard tube through the
     bung, the offset would cause bung deformation, increasing
     the potential for leak-by. The specifics of the modified
     design follow:


     1.  Materials:


     (1) 12 inch Phalse bottom
     (2) 1-1/2 inch long sections of 3/8 in OD Flex tube
     (1) 5-1/4 inch long section of hard plastic racking cane
         tube
     (3) 2-1/2 inch long section of hard plastic racking cane
         tube (clear if possible)
     (1) Fass Frisch 5 liter keg bung
     (1) In-line ball valve with barbed fittings for 3/8 inch
         tubing


     2.  Set-up procedure:


     a.  Slide one end of the 5-1/2 inch racking cane tube about
     1/3 of an inch into one of the 1-1/2 inch long flex tube
     pieces.  Attach the other end of the flex tube to the barbed
     elbow connection, leaving about a 1/8 inch gap between the
     end of the hard tube and the elbow (this is on of the
     compliant joints).  Set this assembly aside.


     b.  Remove the hard plastic insert from the bung (save this
     important piece for later use when just using the cooler as
     a cooler, or when washing the cooler!).  Insert the second
     1-1/2 inch flex tube into the opening in the bung, ensure at
     least 1/2 inch projects out of the wide end of the bung (the
     side that will be on the inside of the cooler).


     c.  Insert the bung assembly into the cooler.


     d.  Insert the 2-1/2 inch long piece of clear racking tube
     into the bung assembly from the outside until the inside end
     just reaches the end of the bung.  About 2 inches will
     project out from the cooler.  I recommend using clear tubing
     here because this is a great place to check for clarity of
     wort run-off using a bright light and a white paper
     background.


     e.  Place the assembly from step (a) into the cooler,
     attaching the free end of the hard plastic tube to the flex
     tube projecting from the bung.  Ensure there is a 1/8 inch
     gap between the two ends of the hard plastic tubes.  This is
     the second compliant joint.


     f.  Attach the ball vale to the hard plastic tubing
     projecting out from the bung using the remaining short
     length of flex tube.


     I op-tested this rig last night with 8 gallons of water at
     150 deg.  There were no leaks after 10 hours.  The seal is
     sufficiently tight that there is no need for any adhesives
     or other sealing compounds.  The apparatus can be easily
     removed for cleaning, or to convert your cooler back to its
     original function.  You can also remove everything but the
     bung and re-insert the hard plastic plug that came with it
     for easy washing.


     A few people have asked where I got the bung and the valve,
     here is the info for all (standard no promo disclaimer
     applies):


     The valve is pretty common at homebrew stores.  One mail
     order source I know of is HopTech, p 19 of the summer
     catalog, for $2.25. 1-800-DRY-HOPS


     The bung should be sold anywhere the 5 liter kegs are sold.
     I bought mine from the Brew Pot in Bowie, MD (301) 805-6799.

Subject: 10 Gallon Gott cooler spigot conversion - THE ANSWER !


To all of those homebrewers with a 10 gallon Gott Mash/Lauter tun -


I spent the weekend searching for a good answer to the spigot replacement
problem.  I plan on using the Phil's Phalse bottom with the cooler, and
spent Friday at the hardware warehouse piecing together valves, nipples,
adapters, etc to meet my needs.  The device was getting pretty ugly, so I
decided to just go with a rubber stopper with flexible tubing through
it.


So on Saturday I went to my local homebrew store and picked out a
stopper, and started buying some other stuff (who can spend only $0.65 at
a homebrew store?), when the owner brought out a bin full of "bungs".
One look and I knew I had found the Holy Grail.  These bungs are designed
for the German Fass/Frisch 5 liter mini-kegs so you can transport/store
beer in the keg without pressurizing it.  It is really a bung within a
bung, because when you are ready to tap the keg, you remove a hard
plastic insert from the bung and insert the tap/charging device.


Well it just so happens that this bung fits into the hole left by
removing the spigot from the 10 gallon Gott perfectly (see graphics)!!

3/8 inch OD flexible tubing fits snugly into the gap left when the
plastic insert is removed.  The tubing is connected to the barbed elbow
coming out of the false bottom, and I put a plastic ball valve in-line
external to the cooler to control sparge flow rates.


I op-tested the integrity of the system over the weekend when I soaked
the cooler in ~9 gallons of warm water with baking soda (to get rid of
the plastic smell).  Result - not a drop leaked by!


IMHO, this is by far the easiest, cleanest solution to the cooler
conversion problem.  I hope this info helps.

Wyeast's greater popularity is undoubtedly due to their size and
availability.  Although not the first (MeV takes that distinction), it
has been active far longer than Yeast Lab, and has wider distribution
because Yeast Lab is exclusively distributed by GW Kent (Yeast Lab is
actually a trademark owned by GWK, not a company).  Yeast Lab can be
perceived as being more difficult to use, because the packaging
instructs you to make a starter.  Not a bad thing IMHO.


Yeast Lab cultures are produced by The Yeast Culture Kit Company.  YCKC
is owned and operated by Dan McConnell, who is a PhD and has a day job
as Research Scientist at the University of Michigan.  He is an
incredibly energetic guy, and very anal (good trait in a person you are
buying your yeast from).  He published the Yeast Lab Quality Assurance
procedures last March on Lambic Digest (available via archives on
Spencer's Beer Page - http://www-personal.umich.edu/~spencer/beer/).
They are impressive.  While it is a one man operation, it is a
sophisticated lab with modern, high quality production equipment.


Randy Reichwage, owner of GW Kent, and Dan are both friends of mine,
which is how I know this stuff, but I have no interest in either company
other than
seeing friends succeed and brewers have access to high quality yeast
(and Dan supplies me with yeast, usually old stuff for QA testing, but,
"I can't be bought for a mere $3.50," as Dave Draper's sig. line often
quotes me).


BTW, Dan, Randy, and Spencer, as well as Mike O'Brien and Dave West of
pico-Brewing Systems, are members of Ann Arbor Brewers' Guild.  Do we
have
a killer club or what?

Subject: Dream Pillow


Has anyone out there made the "Dream Pillow" that Papazian referrs to on
pages 59-60 of _The_Home_Brewer's_Companion_?  It is supposed to induce vivid
dreams through the aromatic combination of various herbs, including hops.  I
am asking because I recently made one and want to hear if anyone has had any
similar experiences.

   Try looking in your local yellow pages under "Drums & Barrels".  Here in
Denver I found a mom & pop packaging distributer that carries (or can get)
every size & shape of plastic FDA container imaginable, at about half the
price of HB shops.  They did have a $25 minimum, but finding someone to pool

   I had the same experience and tried everything, including boiling a strong

leaving about a quart of vinegar in the pot for a couple of days and heating
it up when I thought of it.  That seemed to loosen the crud enough to allow
it to be scrubbed out with steel wool. I can't catagorically state that the
vinegar was the one thing that did the job, but nothing I used before seemed

maybe that made the difference.

Dan, your cost of living must be pretty high if bleach where you live
costs $3 per gallon - I've never paid more than about a buck and a
quarter for a gallon of 5.25% chlorine bleach - and you sometimes can
get the white label kind (still 5.25%) for a buck or less a gallon.


Assuming $1.25 a gallon, this comes to a little over a penny an ounce. 
3/4 cup is six ounces, so you can make my extra-strong (yes, I know it's
overkill at this strength) 5 gallon solution for about 6.5 cents worth
of bleach.


The price for Iodaphors at my local homebrew shop is 50 cents an ounce. 
If you use 2 tablespoons to get the recommended 25 ppm strength, that's
one ounce (1 tablespoon = 1/2 ounce).  Thus bleach is 50/6.5, or 7.7
times cheaper even at my 3/4 ounce use level.  Even at $10/liter (70.4
ounces), which is an extremely good price for Iodaphors, that's about 14
cents an ounce, or 14/6.5 or about twice as expensive.


All figures aside, the point is that bleach is cheap and easy to find
and kills everything.  That's why I continue to use it - and will
continue to use it in the future.  What works best for a brewery or
micro is not necessarily the best for us homebrewers.  And as far as
what happens when it goes down the drain: I let my local sewage
authority worry about that.  They've been handling bleach for
generations and aren't complaining.  That's what my taxes and sewage
bills pay for.


Prosit!

Subject: Food Grade Plastic Q




Thanks to all you who answered my questions re the quality of Oakland 
water (good for brewing from the tap, boiled) and using oatmeal in stouts 
(most said to mix it in with other grains).  I have another question 
arising out of economics...


The question:  Can anyone tell me how to tell if a plastic bucket is
of food-grade quality suitable for making a lauter tun?  Specifically, I 
noted that the laundry detergent here comes in white 5-gallon buckets, which
look to be the right size for making my own lauter tun.  Would these white
plastic buckets be safe for pouring hot grains into without danger of 
chemicals or flavors leaching out?  The detergent brand is Clout, on the 
bottom of the bucket it has HDPE #2 (re recycling quality), and it looks 
like to me the bucket manuafacturer would be a company named HUISH.  Just 
wondering if maybe I have a free, in-house source for basic materials here.


Thanks in advance!

I love my Bruheat!  I have been using it for over a year and would recommend
it to anyone.  If you are going mash in it, be sure to buy the special
grain-bag for it.  This keeps the grains from sticking to and burning on the
heating element.  Most of the complaints I have heard from people are caused
by this.  


The temperature controller works, but sometimes the temperature can run away
from you if you're not careful.  What I do most of the time now is heat
water in the bruheat, mash and sparge in a gott cooler, and then boil in the
bruheat.  I still do extra high gravity batches in the bruheat because of
it's 6 gallon (5 Imperial) capacity.  Lets me stuff more grain in there.


I don't think that you can get the 110 volt models anymore.  If you can
DON'T.  The 220v model boils water perfectly.  Not real fast, but a
beautiful roiling boil (yes, roiling).  Once the initial foaming has
subsided, you can leave a full 6 gallons boiling with no fear of boilover.


Someone is sure to tell you that it will carmelize your wort and that you
can't brew a very light, delicate beer in a Bruheat.  Even Charlie Papazian,
who I normally agree with, is dead wrong on this matter.  It's kind of
funny, he praised the Bruheat in his first book, then slams it in his
second.  Rumor has it that he and Kinney Baughman (SP?), owner of BrewCo had
a little falling out.  
I've got a friend.. well, I work with a guy.. um, let's just say I know
someone who uses a bruheat and ended up with a batch of American lager that
is just as anemic looking as Bud Light.  He is wondering how he can add some
color, ANY color to it.  


Used properly, the Bruheat will not carmelize your wort, nor will it darken
your beer.


For under $100.00 you can get a five (actually 6) gallon boiler/mash tun
with a built in heat source.  It even has a grommeted hole on its very tight
fitting lid so that you could put an airlock in it and use it as a primary
fermenter(I don't recommend this).  Another option would be to insert a tube
into this hole to capture the vapors that evaporate from a liquid being
heated to a precise temperature in the Bruheat.  Now why would anyone want
to do that?  Perhaps Kinney's neighbors in Boone, N.C. know of some
potential use for this.


Did I mention that I love my Bruheat?


I am not affiliated with BrewCo in any way, but if Kinney sends me $5.00 or
free beer I will accept it.

Subject: Kettle Oil Baths, etc


David Hill in #1875 asks for opinions regarding his idea of an oil
bath "buffer" for heating a kettle.  I think the idea is not too
bad, but I'd recommend against using oil as the "working fluid".


Without getting everone's shorts in a twist with an unfounded
overreaction, it's safe to say that *you could* get called away
from the unit and find the oil at it's flash point, with a consequent
disaster of Biblical magnitude.  Even an accidental spill in the
presence of an open burner might prove rather incediary.


Consider instead a glycol solution--I have no idea what the boiling
point can be brought up to using a glycol-water mix, but I'd think
250F might be possible.  Just an idea.  A mercury bath would be
pretty cool, too--I believe the Binford ToxiTherm 4000 uses this
technology.


Another solution might be to take the portion of the keg that was
removed to make it a kettle and fastening that portion to the bottom
outside surface of the keg (with a steel retainer) you might get
improved heat distribution.  Obviously this idea stinks if you didn't
both make your own kettle AND save the scrap, if for no other reason.

Not according to my NIOSH pocket guide to chemical hazards, which has
propane's MW listed as 44.1 and natural gas (Methane) as 16.04.  The
average MW of air is 28.9 (according to the Engineer-In-Training
Reference Manual).  So apparently methane *is* lighter than air and will
not pool. But then again this won't really help you brew indoors unless
you have explosion proof light fixtures ;-)  But seriously folx, I think 
the main concern with either of these gases being used indoors is adequate 
ventilation for the products of combustion, not the fuels themselves.

On another topic, I recently explained to our brewclub members how I was 
working on a Web page for the club (http://149.168.19.21/brewmast.htm) and 
requested ideas from them for things to add to the page.  One of the ideas 
I already had (not original) was to include monthly club activities
such as brew sessions and beer tastings along with instructions on when 
and where to meet.  Several of the members expressed concern with this 
idea stating that they didn't want Mr. Neoprohibitionist Cop finding out 
on the web where & when to stake out these meetings so he can then pull 
people over when they try to leave for drinking and driving.  Now my 
initial reaction is that this is a bit extreme.  They might as well just 
not belong to the club (the cop could get our newsletter from the local 
brew stores too).  But maybe I'm being a bit naive (sp?).  I guess I could 
just leave out the details on the page and instruct visitors to contact a 
member for this info.  Whaddaz the collective think about this? If you 
respond, let me know where you live.  I'm curious if this us just a 
southern/babble-belt thing.


And one last question.  I was planning on asking for a Glatt Grain Mill 
for my birthday, but am now obviously concerned since they are going out 
of business that the warrently wouldn't be worth much.  It was my 
understanding that this was *the* mill to have.  So what would the 
experienced all-grainers recommend?  Buy the Glatt and cross the fingers, 
or is there a close second placer?

Subject: Freezing starters?


     I have a curious question for those who make up starters for their 
     yeast. Has anyone frozen fresh starter wort with any success? I have 
     made starters for the past year or so and enjoy the better start times 
     on fermentaton but the small amount of starter wort can take a 
     substantial amount of time to prepare. This is especially true of 
     building from cultures. 
     
     One quick word on airlocks. I get the impression that some people are 
     filling their airlocks to full with whatever solution they use. I have 
     always filled mine (S style) with water and with enough volume to keep 
     the nasties out but without enough to get sucked back through. The 
     airlock should work the other way too, right? Just a thought.

Honestly, the subject of propane use indoors is one that I am glad
occurs many times per year on the HBD. Quite selfishly, it helps me to
remember to treat propane with a lot of respect. I also use propane

Subject: Wheat beer question


hey all,
I have brewed several all grain wheat beers following eric warners directions
to the tee and they all turned out tasting like tea does when you steep the
teabag too long, BITTER. I am wondering why this might be. I've double
checked everything I can think of and can come up with nothing. None of my
other all grains turn out like this. The ONLY way I deviate from e.w. is my
use of 1# more grain. My gut feeling is this decoction crap, I just knew the
grains were never meant to be boiled.


If anyone has any suggestions, I am open to them. As it stands now my wheat
beer efforts will be put on hold, though I may try a non-decoction wheat
beer, such as a belgain wit.


thanks,
jim

Not that *I'd* ever brew anything with more than 1% ABV, but let's just
say the word "strictly" is, um, open to interpretation. And we have our

Even the figures quoted by Chris lose some of their scariness when you

less than US$60. Remember, this is the country where Schaefer sells for

blacksab`at`siu.edu (Harlan Bauer) asks    :

>is true that Propane is heavier than air and therefore pools on the ground,

>


Natural gas is predominantly methane (CH[4]), which has a molecular
weight of 16.  Propane is C[3]H[8], giving it a molecular weight
of 44.


Air, of course, doesn't have a "molecular weight" as such, since it
is not a pure gas, but a mixture thereof.  As a good first
approximation, however, we can consider air to be 80% nitrogen
(N[2]), molecular weight 28, and 20% oxygen (O[2]), molecular
weight 32.  Thus the average molecular weight of air is
(.8*28)+(.2*32) = 28.8.


As I dimly remember from my chemistry courses, all gases, at any
given temperature and pressure, have the same number of molecules
per unit volume, and therefore their densities are solely
dependent on their molecule weights.  Taking the density of air as
1.000, therefore, natural gas should have a density of 0.556, and
propane a density of 1.523.  


I would be surprised if natural gas had any tendency to "pool" _per
se_; I'd want to see the evidence.  Of course, let us remember that
the "pooling" effect will occur only if there are no convection
currents, etc., to mix the gases (and all gases are miscible in all
proportions).  Carbon dioxide, with the same molecular weight (and
therefore density) as propane, can and does "pool" under the
proper circumstances, but is usually found well-mixed with the
other components of the atmosphere.


A non-pooling gas will not necessarily be safer, either.  A "pool"
of pure gas will only burn along its boundary with fresh air (need
oxygen for burning, yes?), at least until the convection currents
produced by the burning break up the pool.  OTOH, a combustible gas
welll-mixed with the air will produce a nicely explosive mixture, a
la the mixture of gasoline vapor and air in an I/C engine cylinder.


Conclusion:  whether your cooker set-up burns propane, natural gas,
acetylene, hydrogen, or nitromethane, be sure that the area is
well-ventilated, to carry off combusition by-products and fuel
leaks.

Subject: Storing Wort


Thank you for all your responses on storing wort.  The following are a few of 
the  suggestions and ideas.
- -------
1)  With regards to storing wort for yeast starters, the real issue is 
maintaining 
sterility.  Despite boiling of the wort and transfer into sanitized bottles, 
it is not sterile and therefore long-term storage can be problematic.  Aside 
from actually autoclaving the wort after brewing, the other alternative is to 


use a procedure called Tyndallyzation or fractional sterilization.  This 
technique is used to sterilize liquids which decompose upon autoclaving.  
What you want to do is add wort to sanitized bottle on brew day then 1-2 days 
after bottling place the bottle (slightly loosened lid; I'd cover the lid  
with 
aluminum foil just in case of boilover, etc). in boiling water.  Heat for 
about 30 minutes and cool.  Repeat this one more time a couple days later.  
How this works is that the repeated heating cycles will kill any spores that 
may have survived and been activated after the first or second boil. The 
actual process is much like canning and does not require a pressure cooker.  
BTW this procedure is very similar to that used by some of the big brewery 
labs.
2) Canning wort via pressure cooker.


Thanks you.

Subject: counter pressure bottling


I seem to have a lot of trouble with my Benjamin Machine Products counter
pressure bottler. It works OK after you get the hang of it (low foaming); I
get nice clear beer that tastes just like the keg it came out of. The
trouble is that the shelf life, even when stored in the fridge, is about a
month, after which time it gets stale (oxidised). I theorise that this is
due to the lack of yeast sediment in the bottles, failing to take out the
small amount of O2 introduced in the bottling process (yes I purge the
bottle first, 3 times). Has anybody else had this problem with
counter-pressure bottling?

Subject: Kits


Hi.
I wanted to thank everybody who wrote me concerning my carbonation problems.
Also, I'll pass on the info to the other novices out there:
1. If you use the kits, don't use their instructions.
2. If you do use their instructions change the following things:
        a. boil the extract in several gallons of water instead of just 
the 1/2 gallon that the kit might recommend.  Add the wort to the 
remaing cold water in the recipe.
        b. Be patient.  Wait until there have been no bubbles in the 
airlock for several days, or you're hydrometer readings have been stable for 
several days in a row, before you bottle.
        c. boil your priming sugar in a cup and half of water before 
adding to the siphoned bucket of beer before bottling.
        d. It should take at least two weeks before the beer gets 
carbonated, but try a bottle every several days until the carbonation is 
right.  Then chill the bottles. (It has been exactly two weeks, and my 
batch is just getting it's first bubbles)
        e.  Most importantly, remember to taste everything!  If it tastes 
all right, then things are going well...I learned the hard way, I threw 
out a perfectly good wort because it didn't ferment.  If I had tasted it, 
I could have just added more yeast.

I've seen this suckback problem mentioned before in the digest but have
never experienced it myself. In fact I never see the levels in the airlock
indicate anything other than zero to positive differential pressure. What
causes this? Only thing I can think of is pitching to warm wort then cooling
the wort rapidly to fermentation temp such that as the wort/airspace cools,
a delta P in the wrong direction forms. Not good. You need to get your
yeasts off to the races as fast as possible so they are pumping CO2 and
pushing the bubbles in the right direction. In my opinion, any suck back
problem draws contaminated outside air into the fermenter and should be
avoided completely.

I use those small juice bottles, (you know, they sell them at the lunch counter)
for
storing sterile wort. When I need to make some, I brew up a standard pale ale,
and same enough wort to fill as many bottle as I have.
The proceedure:


Sterilize the bottles.
make some wort
fill the bottles 2/3 full
set the bottle in a canning pot, sitting on the rack, with enough water to cover
the bottles halfway up. put the caps in the pot as well.
boil the bejesus out of them!  ( a hard boil for about 30 minutes).
remove each bottle with canning tongs, fish out a cap, and tighten it down.


When cool, store in the pantry along with the tomato paste, beans, wort etc.


These bottles take a standard #7 stopper.  I put the contents of  my yeast
source, (vial, wack-pack, slant)  into one of these and fit with an airlock.
When the activity 
is present, I put this and another sterile into a larger bottle ( 1 quart milk
bottle).
This gives me a good quantity of active starter.
