Subject: Anaerobic Racking


Hello all.  I just tried out an idea I had for racking from a primary 
to a secondary,  and wanted to get the opinion of the collective.


I had a fermenting Helles in my primary,  and wanted to rack it to the 
secondary to drop clear.  The idea was to:


a)        disturb the primary as little as possible so a minimum of 
        sediment would be racked into the secondary. 


b)        Aerate as little as possible during transfer.


c)        accomplish everything as quickly and neatly as possible.


A siphon would have been a bit impractical  since I decided I didn't 
want to move the primary,  a full 5 gal. carboy,  from my refrigerator; 
additionally, working space was pretty tight -- there would be no way 
to elevate the primary above the secondary for a decent siphon.  So I 
opted to rack the beer under CO2 pressure to the secondary, another 5 
gal.  carboy.  This turned out to be exceedingly quick and easy.


All I did was to  put one of those rubber carboy caps -- you know,  the 
orange kind with a second opening for blowing in to start a siphon -- 
on the primary with the racking cane stuck through the main opening as 
usual,  so that when the cap was placed on the carboy the end of the 
cane came down to a little above the yeast cake.  After filling the 
secondary carboy with CO2 to purge any air present, I attached the gas 
out line from my tank to the second hole (the one used to blow into for 
starting a siphon) on the carboy cap.  It fit rather poorly, so I used 
a little duck tape to secure it.  I then attached a hose to the racking 
cane and ran it into the secondary.


Finally,  I applied a very small amount of pressure from the tank to 
the primary carboy,  forcing the beer into the secondary.   The whole 
process took about 10 minutes,  and worked quite well.  The beer 
went into the secondary extremely clear,  and should be sparkling by 
kegging time.  Furthermore,  I believe the entire process was pretty 
much anaerobic.  It was certainly easier than siphoning (yes,  I am 
moderately siphon-impaired),  especially given the tight space I had to 
work in (elevating the primary above the secondary would have been 
impossible),  and the low gas pressures used made the process pretty 
safe.


I think I will rack into my keg this same way when the beer is 
finished.

Subject: Re: Chapeau Mirabelle Lambic


Last night I had a truley unique beer, Chapeau Mirabelle Lambic, a true 
Belgian lambic flavored with plum juice. It had a very sweet taste like 
the fruit juice had just been added and none of the sugars had 
fermented out. Every fruit beer I have had including Kriek and 
Framboise have had fruit flavor but none of the sweetness. My question 
is how do they do this? The only thing I can think of is to filter out 
the yeast, add the juice, keg it and force-carbonate it using a CP 
filler to bottle with. Am I on the right track? Some may want to know 
why I want to brew a beer like this. First of all it was a really 
unique taste, second the Spousal Unit loved it and would probably give 
the authorization for purchase of the filter and CP filler I would 
need. I'll brew anything for more equipment.

Subject: Boil out Cloramine?/Boil time for canning/Propane brewing


Hi homebrewers,


Does anyone know if cloramine can be boiled out, or if it has to be removed
with a carbon filter?


Also, I recently pressure canned some starter wort.  Remembering the
cautions about boutilism that I had read quite some time ago in HBD, I made
sure that I boiled long enough.  Of course, the Ball guide to canning did
not have a recommended time for wort listed in the table of boil times.  It
would seem to me that the wort would be fairly acetic, so it might not even
need pressure canning, and there really isn't anywhere for the beasties to
hide, so it also seems a fairly short pressure time would be sufficient.
To be on the safe side though, I boiled for an hour.  It really is nice and
convienient to get starters going like this.  I have a canning lid with a
hole and grommet in which I can quickly pop an airlock.  The only thing
that is better and quicker is re-pitching.


Well, I have been homebrewing two years now.  I am surprised at how few
batches I have made, (17) but also at how much I have learned  from them
and from reading HBD.  To celebrate, I got a Brinkman 160,000 btu burner,
and will be doing all grain RSN--I also just got a 50lb bag of DeWolf
Cosigns PA malt!  I've brewed twice already with the Brinkman.  It's not as
fast a boil as I thought it would be, but I must admit that I'm torn
between brewing in the comfort of my garage (door up part way, window &
back door open, rock and roll playing) or brewing on my open back porch on
a nice night for my  neighbors to watch!  ;-)

Subject: Boil time before first hop addition


Hello all.


Mmmmmmm.  Hahhhhhps :-)


I'd appreciate some advice about boil time and bittering hops.  As I 
understand it, allowing at least 15 mins of boil before the first hop 
addition lets the hot break partially coagulate so it doesn't have as much 
chance to coat the hops and thus inhibit hop utilization.  (I may be a tad 
off on that explanation :-) - feel free to chime in).


I've been boiling partial mash recipes for 75 minutes, with first hop 
addition at 15 mins into the boil.  This gives the bittering hops a full 1 
hr boil (which I like for utilization) AND it gives me some boil time 
before they are added.  Based on the assumption it is a GOOD thing, I want 
to extend this boil-before-first-hop-addition logic to my all-grain and 
full extract batches.


All-grain:  Based on accumulated reading, I'd like to use a 90 min boil and 
am not sure whether to (1) add the first hop addition at 15 mins into the 
boil and thus boil them for 75 mins, or (2) add the first hop addition at 
30 mins into the boil and thus boil them for 60 mins.


Extract:  I'd tend to hold this to a 60 min boil to avoid over-darkening 
(altho I AM now doing a full-wort boil).  Adding first hop addition at 15 
mins into the boil means my bittering hops get only a 45 min boil, and I'm 
concerned about hop utilization with a boil of less than 1 hr.  Adding them 
up front would negate any pre-addition-boiling benefit.


BTW - if you think I'm nit picking this one to death, feel free to say so!

Subject: BBC judging




I found something a little odd when I took a look at the Sam Adams
homebrew contest packet. No, it wasn't all the pseudo-legalese about
what rights the entrant gives up. It was in the section about judging.
It appears that only finalists will get their scoresheets back. Has
anyone called to ask about that item? Am I correctly interpreting that
all the others will never find out about their entries?


I can't say that I'd be terribly enthusiastic about giving up three good
homebrews, going to the trouble of packing them, rushing home from work
early enough to get to UPS before they close at 6pm, paying to send them
off, and then never get back the score sheets (or, I suppose, have any
evidence that the beer was even judged).


No, they aren't charging an entry fee, and, yes, there's that bag of
hops and the wearable advertising. But if all I wanted was that bag of
hops, I could buy them for less at a homebrew shop than the UPS charge
to ship halfway across the country, YMMV. Presumably, most people send
their beers for judgings because they, uhhh, would like them judged. If
a beer is judged in the forest and you don't get the comments/scores,
did the tree really fall? :-)


Conceptually, the SA competition is a decent enough idea; I hope that
they will take care of this little deficiency if they choose to repeat
the event next year. Or, better, maybe _this_ year they'll send the
sheets to brewers anyway, even though they didn't initially promise to do it.


(I know, I know, no one is forcing anyone to enter, but I wonder how
many entrants missed that language, and then will wonder why they never
got their scoresheets. Maybe BBC/SA was looking to save postage and
envelopes, but perhaps they didn't consider how this could be a small
"PR" disaster in the homebrewing community.


Now go have a beer,

I also have white spots in my beer.  I sampled a little bit of it and it

Subject: trub settling for 24 hours


I tried something new this last batch to remove trub. 
After boiling the wort and putting it in the bucket, I chilled the wort 
down to 70 degrees.  I covered the wort and let it set for 24 hours.  I 
then transferred the wort to another bucket and then added the yeast.  I 
had about an inch of trub at the bottom of the pail left behind.  I 
wanted to know what everyone thought of this?  I noticed some don't like 
to let the wort sit that long before adding the yeast and unfortunately 
the beer isn't ready for drinking to find out for myself what I think.  
Happy Homebrewing!

Subject: Recycled buckets/false bottoms.


Greetings,
This is my first attempt at posting to the HBD, so please keep the flames to
a moderate level.  I'm a novice brewer who has questions to ask and ideas to
contribute.  Some of the questions I'll get answers to by lurking, others I
just gotta ask.


In hbd #1877, Br. Thompson asked about using plastic buckets that held
laundry detergent as a lauter-tun.  I too am curious about buckets that come
from other than the homebrew shops.  I use some found at the hardware/paint
store (new, not used) to collect wort, etc.  Is there a difference in "food
grade" HDPE other than the FDA approval??  What about vinyl tubing.  Is the
stuff sold at the hb shop any better than that sold at HardwareHeaven??


There has been numerous postings about propane/nat. gas recently.  My $.02 is
this.  Anybody remember the explosion in Brenham Tx a few years ago???
  Don't get me wrong. I love cooking with gas.  My SO won't have it in the
house, but loves to see me fire up the cooker outside ('cause  that means
something good is cooking).  I would be *very* hesistant to fire one up in
the basement though.  Too many things can go real wrong, real fast without
proper ventillation.

Subject: Re:  Kegging and Bottling




Dan Fitzgerald asks about the right amount of priming for splitting a batch
of bottles and for kegging.  Past discussions on this forum suggest that
the rate of priming for bottles differs from that for kegging. This
indicates that they need to be primed separately. I certainly am using far
less priming in my kegs, but then I also use CO2 to pressurise my (plastic)
keg.  I have bottled (without additional priming) under pressure straight
from the keg when I want to take a (plastic "coke") bottle(s) to a party.
I have found that enough pressure is retained for several months in
leftover bottles.


 This suggests that perhaps Dan might be able to pressurise his keg, fill
the required bottles under pressure, then use the keg, all without any
priming at all.  This assumes that Dan has some system for pressurising.
Anyone tried this to see if it works, or whether priming is still needed?

Why, yes, now that you ask ;}.


My last 5 batches have been successfully started from pre-prepared 100 ml
allotments of propagated, frozen Wyeast 1968 (ESB) and Wyeast 1728
(Scottish) starters. I got the idea from Papazian's
"Joy...Homebrewing" where he devoted a single sentence to the concept
of freezing starters. Here's my procedure:


1. I smak a pack and pitch it when ready it into a liter of 1.020
unhopped wort, being extremely careful with sanitization: swab all
glass lips with Everclear and flame contact surfaces before all
transfers.


2. When the starter is at high krausen, I take 100 ml glycerol (USP)
and heat it in the microwave til it's good & hot to kill off any
nasties (about 60 seconds for 100 ml). I let it cool to ~70F and add
it to the starter (swab, flame, don't breathe). I got the glycerol
from a local pharmacy, but I'm told you can get it lots of places.


3. I swirl the starter to thoroughly mix the glycerol & yeast, and
then pour out ten 100 ml allotments (swab, flame, don't breathe) which
I immediately stopper with sterilized (clorox) rubber stoppers. I
found some 100 ml pyrex sample bottles at an odds & ends-type store
that are ideal: they take a #2 rubber stopper perfectly. I push the
stopper in _tight_ because the starter is still active and will be
until frozen.


4. I cover the stopper & bottle top with foil to minimize air contact.


5. Freeze immediately in a _cold_ freezer (glycerol is an anti-freeze,
y'know).


When I want to brew, I thaw one of the allotments three days before
and pitch it into a liter of 1.020 unhopped wort (swab, flame, don't
breathe). 2, 2 1/2 days later it's at high krausen & ready to pitch. 


The re-constituted starter wort has always smelled & tasted good, and
the beer has never had an off flavor, leading me to believe that the
glycerol does a pretty good job of keeping a sufficient number of
yeasties from having their cell walls burst during freezing. 


Works for me...

Greetings all,


    As a brand new kegger, I have found a problem with pouring, that is all I
pour is 
foam.
     One book (Burch) suggested using 3/16 inch hose with 14 PSI.  Charlie P.
suggested using 5 PSI.  I switched from 1/4 inch to 3/16 and from 4 feet of
hose to 5 feet, and 
varied the pressures all over the place, and still all I get if foam.
     Any and all suggestions are appreciated.
     If it makes any difference, the beer is a bock, it was force carbinated
and is at about 50 degrees.  


     Also, for what it's worth, my reconditioned kegs leaked all over, but the 
William's Keg Lube seems to have sealed them OK.

Subject: Re: temperature calculations


In HBD #1878 Brian Dulisse asks:
>is there a formula for calculating the volume/temperature of infusions?


The following is based on an article called "Heat Capacity Calculations for
Mashing" by Kurt Froning in Zymurgy Spring 1994.


Let


CPG = heat capacity of grain in Btu/lb/degF
CPW = heat capacity of water = 1 Btu/lb/degF
WG  = weight of grain in pounds
WWI = initial weight of water in pounds
WWA = weight of added water in pounds
TD  = desired temperature in degF
TI  = initial temperature in degF
TA  = temperature of added water in degF
HL  = heat loss in % (decimal)


Now (heat needed) = (1-HL)*(heat from added water) which expands to


(CPG * WG + CPW * WW) * (TD - TI) = (1 - HL) * CPW * WWA * (TA - TD)   (**)


Froning gives the heat capacity of grain, CPG, as a function of moisture
content (a simplification of course, different grains probably have
different CPG:s) as follows:


% moisture      CPG in Btu/lb/degF
  0                     0.38
  2                     0.39
  4                     0.40
  6                     0.41


This is probably not very accurate but it doesn't matter since you have to
figure out the heat loss of your system by experimentation anyway. I use a
CPG of 0.4.


Now all you have to do is do some test runs to compute your heat loss, HL,
and then solve for the quantity desired.


Note 1: you need to convert volumes of water to weights and vice versa. One
quart of water weighs 2.08 pounds at room temperature.


Note 2: changing temperature or weight units doesn't change the equation
since it is linear in all arguments. This is nice if you work with metric
units.


Note 3: you could start with fixing your desired mash thickness. Compute
the amount of added water based on this and use the equation to calculate
the temperature of the added water.


Note 4: check at what temperature your water is boiling. This might be
lower than 212 degF if you live in a high area.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Yeast






In HBD #1878, Tracy Aquilla <aquilla`at`salus.med.uvm.edu> posts about yeast
(specifically about Wyeast, but I think her comments apply generally to all
yeast manufacturers).

Well, Tracy, if I found a rat in a Cheerios box, I'd probably contact both
General Mills and the press.  That's the sort of thing I'd hate to have swept
under the rug by my local grocer.


The case of yeast is a bit more subtle.  There's nothing rat-sized in a pouch
of yeast.  Any problem that might exist will be detectable only by doing a
lot more microbiological work than most homebrewers do.  It would be
difficult for any single brewer to state unequivocally that a problem is due
to the yeast producer and not to their own bad sanitation or recipe.  Only
by amassing a lot of trouble reports can we spot a trend that a yeast has
problems.  I think the posts in the "September Wyeast 1056" thread have done
just what they should do: point out a potential problem.  I don't, however,
believe that there is a problem with the yeast; if there were, I think we
would have seen many more posts, some of which would contain more substantial
"proof" that there is a problem.


As to replacing the yeast package when a problem is detected, it has been
pointed out before here on HBD that the replacement of a $3.50 package of
yeast doesn't go a long way toward making up for a spoiled batch of beer.
The malt, hops, and time cost much more.

        Um, actually Pierre, OSHA *DOES* regulate sand (the silica of which
it is composed is considered hazardous to breathe) as a hazardous material.
You should be able to get a HazMat sheet describing the evils and appropriate
handling of this dangerous substance.
        Unlike the Dihydrogen Monoxide thread, this is not a joke.  A recent
article in a local paper discussed the hyper-regulation of OSHA/EPA and cited
an OSHA requirement to label bricks and sand as hazardous because they contain
silica which is believed to cause lung cancer if inhaled over long periods of
time (a la the asbestos effect).
        So be careful, you wouldn't want your brewery to become a Superfund

As far as I know, a green tint in glass indicates the presence of _iron_
impurities. Lead is used to make crystal -- as in "crystal clear" -- an
absolutely colorless, sparkling soft glass. (That said, inorganic

OK, clearly the rat carcass wasn't the best example, but I think you get my
point. Anyone even remotely involved in agriculture or food production knows
that these things happen occasionally when processing on a commercial scale.
I'll return the defective item and I'm not going to make a big deal out of
it, as long as I end up getting what I paid for. Naturally, some people LOVE
to make a big deal out of things like this (which reminds me of Dave Barry's
article about someone who found a fist-sized lump of cornflakes in the box
and wound up in the news. This is hardly news-worthy, IMO).


>Any problem that might exist will be detectable only by doing a
>lot more microbiological work than most homebrewers do.


I disagree. I think most significant problems are easily detectable without
any micro work at all, although experience helps. Tasting the broth from the
starter is the best way to do QC on your yeast. It may smell funky
sometimes, but it should always taste like beer. If it doesn't, you probably
won't like the results if you pitch it into your wort. (I suppose if you
don't make a starter, you could pitch a contaminated culture without knowing
it, but one could also taste a portion of the liquid from the package before
pitching it.)


>It would be
>difficult for any single brewer to state unequivocally that a problem is due

Absolutely true, especially depending on at which point the "problem" is
detected. That's part of the reason one should take it up with the supplier
before posting public complaints.

Of course, but one can't legitimately hold the manufacturer responsible for
ruining your wort or wasting your time.

If I recall my optical crystalography course correctly, glass looks very
transparent in thin cross section but tends to filter out  the shorter
wavelengths of light in thicker cross sections.  You can see this effect
by looking at a thick chunk of glass (e.g. a window pane edge on or the 
thick
glass of a 5g carboy).  It will have a greenish/blueish tint.  Lead (lead 
oxide
really) in glass turns it into "lead" crystal, that "crystal" clear 
sparkling material
candlesticks holders are made out of so often.


I wouldn't worry too much about lead in the glass of the carboy as your tap
water probably has higher concentrations.  If you are prone to worry, go 
plastic.
I personally am not going to throw out my slightly green carboy; we have 
just
been through too much together. So relax, don't worry, ect.
