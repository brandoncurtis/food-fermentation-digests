Mashing at lower temperatures gives you more fermentables.
Even if you mash in at a relatively high temperature, the
extended time still is going to let those enzymes do a
rather complete job of conversion as you fall back through
the lower temperatures.  And you're probably going to end
up in the range where proteinase enzymes are working.  The
end result: a highly attenuated beer with little body and
no head.  If this is what you like, overnight mashing will
work well.  Probably ideal for Dry beers.

Subject: 90 Minute Boils/ToxiTherm Problems


In #1879 Tim asks (tfields`at`relay.com):


> All-grain:  Based on accumulated reading, I'd like to use a 90 min
> boil and am not sure whether to (1) add the first hop addition at
> 15 mins into the boil and thus boil them for 75 mins, or (2) add
> the first hop addition at 30 mins into the boil and thus boil them
> for 60 mins.


Is there any reason not to boil for 90 minutes?


In the same issue, Tom (temercha`at`hsv23.pcmail.ingr.com) mentions trouble
with the ToxiTherm unit he's using, and yes, more power *is* the solution.
What typically happens with this unit over time is that the mercury slowly
vaporizes, and little by little bath coverage of the kettle bottom is
diminished. Thus, there is little conductive xfer between the outer jacket
and the inner one.  This can be verified by careful inspection of glass,
chrome or other highly polished surfaces in the vicinity of the unit:
you'll see near-microscopic Hg droplets condensed all over these surfaces.


In Europe the solution is to properly dispose of the mercury and replace
the working fluid with a non-toxic substance such as certain hydrolyzed
plant extracts. Here in America, the clearly superior solution is to
open the burner orifice with a suitable drill bit, and tweak the gas
mains regulator pressure (late at night).  "Blowing" the burner using a
garage air compressor to inject the burner air inlet is also a slick way
to go.

Subject: SA IPO


In reading the SA IPO prospectus, I found an interesting fun fact.


Page 36 under the discription of Doulbe Bock:


"This classic style was first brewed by monks in the Middle Ages for
fortification during long Lenten fasting.  Over one-half pound of malt goes into
every bottle of this rich brew......"


Run the numbers on this: Thats over 24# of Malt for a 5 gallon batch! With an
extraction rate of 30+ pts OG should be over 1.140!  Or with a computed OG of
1.080, the extraction rate would be under 17 pts per pound.


At first I thought this was a typo with the information being transposed from
the Triple Bock profile.  But the triple bock bottle tag claims one pound malt
per (tiny) bottle.  I can't address the triple bock, but doesn't 1/2 pound malt
per bottle seem excessive for a double bock?

I will be traveling to Allentown, PA on business next week.  The
Holiday Inn where I will be staying is next door to the Stroh
brewery. I don't know if Stroh brews any craft beers, but if they
do, their flagship brand is not one of them (yecchh).  I need
to get away from the smell of that place and enjoy some good brew.
Any suggestions about brewpubs in the area?

Subject: ETOH calcs/hydrometer Question


A couple of quick brain ticklers (my brain's not ticklish you see).  I use
the standard Balling/Potential ETOH/Sp. Gravity calculations for  final
alcohol determination.  However, with each batch the final alcohol values
caclulated by the three methods are always different.  Should they not be
identicle (or at least REAL close considering standard error due to
"eyeballing" the hydrometer readings)?  I use the folowing formulas:
Balling:                    (Balling1-Balling2)(.42)(1.25)= Final ETOH by volume
Potential ETOH:    %1-%2=final ETOH by volume
Specific gravity:      (OG-FG)(105)(1.25)=Final ETOH by volume
My last batch calculations were as follows:
Balling:                    (14.75-4)(.42)(1.25)= 5.6% by volume
Potential ETOH:     7.5-1.0= 6.5%by volume
Specific gravity:      (1.060-1.015)(105)(1.25)=5.9% by volume


I always assume all three numbers will be identicle with only a slight
standard deviation.  Assuming I read hydro carefully at the correct temp for
hydro's calibration, is this just standard error due to "eyeballing" ?
sHould I just split the difference(s)? Just curious.


Q#2:  My hydrometer is calibrated for 70 degrees (I swear).  The batch I
made yesterday I accidentaly read with flask beer at 60 degrees.  Anyone
know a simple table/chart depicting specific gravity differences measured by
hydrometer per degree of temp at measurement (hope that made sense).

Subject: cheap false bottom


Dear Homebrewers,


I am sure, I am not the first who's decribing this "lauter tun" but I'll post
it anyway.


Cut a round piece of insect screen, with a radius of 3-6 cm (1-2 inch) bigger
than the radius of your bottling bucket. Place it in your bucket (or Cooler
or whatever you're using) and it works very well as a false bottom. 


I have used the "Zapp-Papp" (see Charlie Papazian in "The Joy of
Homebrewing") system before, but I found  the screen works much better for
me.


The insect screen material is, according to the manufacture, aluminum, which
shouldn't be a problem, but we' ll see how many critical answers I 'll get
about this.

Subject: Motorized Grain Mill (sortof)


A couple of weekends ago I was setting up to grind some grains for a
weisenbier. Known to be a scrounger at times I found a used flour mill at a
local junk dealer. This thing looks sortof like a Corona and has Molinos De
Mano Azteca S.A on the handle. Instead of metal grinding plates, I has two
surfaces made of a material that looks like your standard grinding wheel
with a special pattern to aid in the grinding. With a couple of washers
installed as spacers, it works adequately as a grain mill. Well back to my
grinding session. My 5 year old daughter, who is extremely curious, came out
on the porch to see what I was doing. To make a long story short, she
wouldn't let go of the crank. She just kept grinding and grinding while I
occasionally fed the mill while sipping a cold one. It's amazing the stamina
these youngin's have. Half way through the grind she asked me what it was
for and I said "we're making beer!" and she replied "I'm making beer?
YUCCH!" She kept on grinding though. Well trained.

Subject: Sand/breathing


I resumed receiving the HBD in the middle of a controversy over the 
effects of breathing sand (Sean Cox/Pierre Jelenc; 8 Nov). Sand is purely 
a size term: 0.0625 - 2 mm. Sand can be made out of silicon dioxide, 
water ice, basalt rock fragments, chert, calcium carbonate --you name it. 
Inhaling sand of any composition will result in rapid strangulation from 
inflamation and swelling of the respiritory membranes; that has nothing 
to do with its coposition ---although the effect would be much more rapid 
if the sand grains were composed of a genuinely irritating substance such 
as red pepper. Silt is composed of grains smaller than sand and silicon 
dioxide silt inhaled over a long period of time can result in silicosis. 
This fact is the excuse for the regulatory actions of OSHA and other 
government agencies. To extrapolate from the bad effects of silt-sized 
silicon dioxide to bricks, which have a minor component of SiO2, or even 
sand (which may or may not be composed of SiO2) is so ludicrous and 
intellectually dishonest as to be worthy of the French Revolutionary 
solution.

  I, too, use the oxygen scavenging caps right out of the bag - when I bottle 
  that is.  I tried soaking them in iodophor but I noticed that they tended 
  to "bleed" tiny drops of the sanitizer from the pores in the cap liner 
  after a short time.  I went ahead and bottled with these caps anyway 
  without rinsing and the beer turned out great (and I'm still kicking).  I 
  seem to remember that immersing these caps in an aqueous solution 
  deactivated them anyway.  I would probably used iodophor to sanitize 
  regular caps but I rarely bottle now (and then usually in Guinness bottles) 
  and I never use anything but the oxygen scavenging caps when I use standard 
  bottles.  Just another data point.
  
  Also, it is belated by about a month, but I wanted to publicly thank Kinney 
  Baughman for his hospitality when I brought my family up to Boone for 
  brunch at the Cottonwood Grille.  Kinney spent a lot of time with us and 
  gave me the grand tour of his brewing operation (along with plentiful 
  samples).  I highly recommend a stop here if you are ever in the area.  The 
  beers (and food) are excellent!

Good point, and good question.  The measurements are not really 
*necessary* at all if you are happy with your brews.  You are making beer 
you like, so by default they are not necessary for you :-).  You will 
probably find that such measurements (in particular temperature) become 
more important to you as you move into using more grains.


Here is a short list of why they are important to me. YMMV of course.


1. To replicate good results
2. To find out what caused bad results and avoid them in the future
3. To gauge what is happening
4. Techy details are cool :-)
5. Better control over every stage of the brewing process
6. Mashing pretty much demands attention to such details


IOW, to *improve* my homebrew.

\
   Yes I have converted one, yes the plastic/rubber is glued on, there are no
metal handles under there, won't work as a boiler over fire (unless you
construct a cradle to hold the keg after removing the ends), will work as a
boiler if you use an electric element inside the keg.  If you take the ends
off you end up with an egg shaped vessel.

Subject: Contract brewing


Hello All,


We've seen some recent postings about what constitutes a "micro" brewery. 
 I think there are generally recognized guidelines based on bbls per yr 
production??


I don't much care what label the brewery runs under so long as I like the 
beer.  I assume that those "micros" using contract breweries do so 
because it is more cost effective.  Up front costs for building a brewery 
from the ground up are probably pretty high.  Also, brewing at several 
geographic locations would help keep distribution costs down (and 
freshness up for that matter).  And, how much "quality beer" drinking 
capacity is there out there?  If everyone that entered the "micro" 
business built their own brewery, would we end up with over capacity?


One final thought:  let's look at this from the contract brewer's side.  
Do these contract breweries tend to fall into a certain size category?  
EG are they themselves "micros"?  I have absolutely no data on this, but 
I wonder how many contract breweries are "micros" that see contract 
brewing as an entry point into the market and a way to defray the expense 
of building the brewery (IOW they may want to eventually brew their own 
brand).  And, how many "smaller/micro" breweries are able to stay alive 
by contract brewing?  And, how many just want to BREW for a living, and 
see contract brewing as a way to do it?  Might be nice NOT to have to 
worry so much about marketing, selling, advertising, etc?


Anyone have any data on the contract brewing market?  How many are 
established breweries vs start-up; how many brew under contract ONLY vs 
those that have their own brand as well?

A short drive down the road is Bardo Rodeo. A must-see.  It's about a 
block off one of the metro stops (subway) - you can get on the subway at 
the Vienna Metro Station, which is just down Rt 66 from Manassas.  I dont 
know which stop :-(  There is also a pub (or whatever) in Manassas called 
Heros.  Havent been there, but I've heard good things about the beer 
selection (micro on tap).  I dont know if they brew.


Also, if you are here on Saturday from 1 to 3, the Potomac Brewing Co 
(micro) does tours.  They are close to the corner of Rt 28 and Rt 50 - 
again close to manassas.  NOTE they use the "old" spelling for Potomac - 
the one with the "W", but I cant remember it :-).  A bit farther would be 
Dominion Brewing Co in Ashburn, VA.  Maybe a half hour from Manassas via

Subject: Possible Contaminated Beer?!


okay, so maybe letting the trub settle out for 24 hours wasn't the thing 
to do, or maybe I didn't sanitize enough, or maybe I have no idea what I 
am talking about.  Those are the possible solutions to my problem.  Now, 
my problem.  The batch of beer I wrote about previously that I let sit 
for 24 hours to let the trub settle out seems to have a problem.  I 
transferred the beer from the primary fermenter to the secondary today 
and there was about 1/2 an inch of brown crust on top of the beer.  The 
smell wasn't anything unusual, but I have never had this happen before.  
Could this be contamination?  Well, for what its worth, here is my recipe 
and my brewing notes.


Sanitation:
     I always use to much bleach in my buckets.  I have been warned about 
this but I am paranoid of contamination.  In my 5 gallon bucket I put in 
1/2 cup of bleach and fill the bucket up with cold water and let sit for 
1/2 hour.  7 gallon bucket I use just shy of 3/4 cup of bleach and due 
the same.  


Recipe Name:  Bulwark American Lager
Volume:  5 gallons
Malt Extract


Extracts used:


3 lbs 5 oz Munton & Fison American Light Malt Syrup (boil 60 mins)
1 lb       Munton & Fison Light Dried Malt Extract (boil 60 mins)


Hops:


1 oz       Willamette Pellets (3.9% Alpha) (boil 45 mins)
1/2 oz     Cascade Pellets (5.6% Alpha) (boil 5 mins)


Yeast:


1.75 oz    WYeast #2035 American Lager 


Additives:


1 teaspoon Irish Moss (boil 10 mins)
4 oz       Malto Dextrin (boil 30 mins)(note:  I have no idea why I used this
           in a beer that traditionally is not supposed to have mouth feel,
           but it was there screaming to be used)


Yeast Activated on 30 Oct 95
Wort Boiled on 02 Nov 95


Brewing Log:
On commencing of boil, I added the Extracts and let boil for 15 minutes.
I added the Willamette and let boil for another 15 minutes.
I added the Malto Dextrin and let boil for 20 minutes.
I added the Irish Moss and let boil for 5 minutes.
I added the Cascade and let boil for the final 5 minutes.


I transferred the wort to my 5 gallon bucket and let sit overnight.
I transferred the wort from the 5 gallon bucket to my 7 gallon bucket, 
and aerated for 30 minutes using an aquarium pump (all equipment 
sanitized in bleach).  I let the head settle down, pitched the yeast and 
let sit at room temperature.
Once the yeast started showing signs of activity I moved the bucket to my 
garage which was at a temperature of 54 degrees (f).  After fermenting in 
the primary 1 week I transferred it to the secondary.  


And that's where I am at now.  Trying to relax, but its to early in the 
day to have a homebrew.  


Has anyone else experienced the floating brown crust?  What was your 
results?  If anyone is interested in how the beer turns out, I plan on 
leaving it in the secondary for at least 2 weeks and then bottling.  So 
it'll be mid December before I actually taste it.  Happy Homebrewing!

My Mexican Carboys are not tinted blue at all. I buy the five gallon
carboys manufactured by Corning (in Mexico) at Corning Outlet stores for
about $12 each.
If you want to test for lead, go to a hardware store or home center and buy
a Lead Test kit used for testing pottery (china and stuff). The test
consists of wiping a swab on the item and looking for a color change. I
have not tested mine but used the swabs back when we were looking into the

I originally sent this privately but it bounced back to me.  It is
probably of general interest anyhow if it has not been answered already:




I have appended a post to the HBD by Kelly Jones a couple of years ago.
I have found it invaluable!  If you are using a Gott water cooler, you
may have to experiment for a little bit to account for the heat absorbed
by the cooler.  I use a stock pot for my mash tun and put it into a
mountain of close fitting styrofoam to maintain the temps throughout the
mash.  Since I heat up the strike water in the mash tun, the numbers are
usually right on the nose.


Good luck!

Subject: An additional Anaerobic Racking


In HBD1879 Mikael Owings sugests using CO2 to push beer into the secondary
fermentor. For those who find this an attractive idea, there is an
improvement to this method. I fill the receiving vessel (carboy or keg)
to the very top with an iodine solution. After the sanitizing period,
I push the iodine solution out with the same racking cane and two hole
cap that Micheal uses, but I leave the racking cane cap (the little 
black guy) off so I can push the last drops out. I use the black cap to push 
beer out of the carboy into the receiving vessel. This method snatitizes
and fills the vessel with CO2, no oxigen, sanatized vessel.


I did find a troubling technique in Micheals method. Micheal duck tapes the
organge two hole cap to his carboy for better seal. This is potentially 
dangerous. If, by odd chance, something goes wrong, Micheal could have 
a highly pressurized glass bomb on his hands, and who knows when she'll 
blow. "The vessel can't take much more of that captian. She'll blown at 
moment." I have found that if I use the orange cap with out any fastening
device, I have an automatic pressure relief device. The cap simply pops
off if the pressure exceeds 8 or 9 lbs inside the carboy. Much safer.
Not all carboy's mouths are the same size, on some I get some CO2 leakage 
when pushing the beer out, but the amount is minor. Because this system can't
handel much pressure, a transfer takes about 10 minutes. Better this than
"Damn it Jim, I'm just a country doctor. I don't know how to pick shards 
glass out suck with beer out of this poor brewer!"

Subject: Wohlgemuth units


In HBD 1877, Andy "Wohlgemuth" Walsh asks:


        The sentens he refers is like this:"To prepare a typical 
        small batch of mash, 327,5 kg of the ground corn, 1007 L
         of tap water ...and 2.04 x 10^7 units of carbohydrase
        (modified Wohlgemuth units of Bacillus licheniformis)".


        I work in the field of fermentation but I dont know the 
        term "Wohlgemuth".


        I gess he have got the rescription from some beer source.


        Do You know this term or any who might ?

        Anyone who can answer this question will receive this 
        week's Homebrew Digest Egghead of the Week virtual award.


Okay, I'll take a chance of making an idiot of myself, in the hope of
winning an award. I think a Wohlgemuth unit is a measure of diastatic
"dosage" - specifically, the quantity of amylase required to digest a fixed
quantity of starch (I think 1 mg) at a fixed temperature (I think 37C) over
a fixed period of time (I think 30 min).  If it isn't, it ought to be.  A
solution containing 5000 modified Wohlgemuth units of amylase can digest
twice as much complex carbohydrates to glucose as can a solution containing
2500 units. Judging from the mash in question, the source of the quote might
be a text on sour-mash whiskey making.  Corn, I think, lacks diastatic
enzymes so they have to be introduced from somewhere else, like B.
licheniformis.

The keg dispensing pressure thread is back, and I would like
to add a comment about the pressure drop in the system. Use
of different size and length of dispensing hose does not change
the overall pressure drop through the system, it just shifts it
around a bit. The overall pressure drop is the difference
between the pressure in the keg and the pressure in the
atmosphere. So, by changing the size or length of hose you
are simply changing the proportion of the pressure drop that
is taken along the length of hose. The pressure drop can be
pictured as a set of discreet drops along the segments in
the beer's path to your cup:
1. the diptube,
2. the pin- or ball-lock fitting,
3. the dispensing hose, and
4. the faucet.
As you can see, the one that we have the easiest control over
is the dispensing hose. I would guess that the trick in selecting
the hose parameters is to balance the pressure drop as much
as possible along the beer's entire path, without taking too big
a drop at any one spot. I'm sure my fluid dynamics textbook
could be used to calculate these parameters, but my chemical
engineering skills are rustier than my trial-and-error skills.

     2 1/2 lbs Light Dried Malt Extract (boil 60 mins)
     2 1/2 lbs Amber Dried Malt Extract (boil 60 mins)
     1/2 lb Crystal Malt 60 L
     (I will bring the temperature of the water up to 150 degrees add the 
      crystal malt and leave at that temp for 30 mins, strain out the 
      crystal, bring the water to a boil then add the DME.)


I anticate that this will make this recipe definately an English Brown 
Ale.  Happy Homebrewing!

Subject: Electric stove problems


Hi all,
     
     While cleaning my electric stove I noticed a rather serious
problem.  The connector for the element that I use to brew had 
decomposed into a charred black mass.  I now have to replace the 
connector and the wire pair that runs from the connector to the 
control knob.  The element appears to be O.K.
     Has anybody else had this problem?  I do partial boils, 3 1/2
gal. (more or less) in a 4 gal SS pot.
     Also, as a related comment, it appears that my brewing is 
slowly destroying my stove, with cleaning off the burnt black 
wort on the stovetop, and now this.  The wife is patient but 
getting annoyed.  Any ideas, short of getting a propane setup 
(which I've been pondering)?  Thanks.

I agree, though I once heard at a Redhook (Seattle, WA, for all you
non-northwesterners) tour that the term "micro-brewery" applies to breweries
that brew (or contract brew, I suppose) less than 50,000 barrels a year;
50,000-100,000 barrels is defined as a "craft brewery"; over 100,000 barrels
is a "brewery".  Yes, it would be silly for any of the big three to use the
term "micro-brewery" but that is exactly what they are doing.  Has anyone
else heard the recent radio ads for A-B's new line of pre-prohibition beers?

Michael, you stated that you're doing kit or malt extract beers, and may soon
move into partial mashing.  I submit that when you move into mashing grains
(all-grain more so than partial mashing), you'll soon discover the importance
and necessity of the use of a thermometer and hydrometer.  Less necessary will
be pH test papers or meter, but nice to have. 


If you want to brew a certain style of beer well, and consistently, you'll
need to hit specific temperatures in your mash, at specific times.  Things like
beer mouthfeel, body, fermentability, and head retention are directly dependent
on the temperature of the mash at certain times.  A good, fast, and accurate
thermometer is an all-grain brewer's most important tool (perhaps equally
important is a clock).


The hydrometer will be necessary to tell you if you've achieved an expected
specific gravity; if not, you can modify the batch size to adjust.  It's used
by all-grain brewers as much before fermentation starts as after.


The pH measuring tool is nice to have, but usually not necessary unless you're
brewing with water that can introduce problems with the mash, like water high
in carbonates, for example, which tend to prevent the mash pH from falling into
the proper range.  The mash pH should ideally be within a narrow range (around
5.2 - 5.5) and, in most cases with water that's not really hard, the mash will
fall into that range by itself; no outside adjustment is necessary.  If the
mash pH is being buffered because of water chemistry, you'll need to make
adjustments with salts or acids.  Additionally, it's advised to monitor the
mash runoff to ensure that the pH doesn't rise too high, which is something it
would tend to do anyway as the mash becomes diluted with sparge water.  Again,
addition of salts or acids to the sparge water can control that.


As I mentioned, I don't consider measurements a bother.  I like to futz with
yeasts, brewing gadgets, recipes, and the tools of the brewer.  None of it is
absolutely necessary, but it's my hobby and hobbies are meant to be fun.
I homebrew because I really enjoy it; I don't consider the time or effort spent
in taking measurements to be wasted.  If it was just good beer I was after,
well, there's plenty of good commercial beer around now.
