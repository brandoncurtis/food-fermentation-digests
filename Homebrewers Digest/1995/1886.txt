I, too, have been trying to get my IBU calculations correct.  Yes,
utilization will differ with pellets vs. plugs vs. leaf.  I imagine util
will differ with a hop sack vs. not.  I have been told that the
difference with the sack is negligible, so ignore it.  


I have two different methods of calculations, both give different
answers.  Is there a definitive, accurate method of calculating IBUs
that someone can share?

Subject: Counter-pressure Bottle Filler


Dear HBD:


This is just to relay an experience that may be of interest to other
homebrewers.


I bottled about 1.25 gallons tonight with a counter-pressure filler,
homemade from the plans in BREW. It worked like a charm. (Except when I
inadvertently removed the filler tube before turning off the beer supply
valve.)


Finding all the parts was harder than anything else. (Isn't it always.) The
assembly instructions were clear and concise. The pictures were worth lots
of words. Building it took hardly any time at all. Using it turned out to
be much simpler than I anticipated.


I did have a slight problem when I connected the system, pressurized at
about 10 psi to a keg of beer being force-carbonated at about 30 psi.
Luckily, no beer flowed into my CO2 regulator and no damage was done.


After reading the Zymurgy reviews of counterpressure fillers, I believe
that this one is just about as good as any available.

Subject: Red Ale or Red Swell?


I got a HB kit for X-mas a couple of years ago.  I made nine brews
from extract (still have the can labels and recipes) and got 
dicouraged and retired it.  On a scale of a 1 to 9, I think I had 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and a 9!  Anyway, I pulled it back from the
garage sale and started a Wheat Ale a couple of week ago.  Not bad,
maybe a 6, better than domestic swell.  


I then started searching AOL for a board and found HBD (read "The
Virtuoso Digest").  I saw how many of you *occasion brew* and 
decided that I should brew a red ale to drink while rooting for 
the Huskers during the Fiesta Bowl.  Here my problem with my first
grains and extract batch, I cracked a 1/4# of roasted malt and a
1/2# of crystal malt and steeped for a half hour at 160-180F.  
Then I added my malt extracts and boiling hops, not straining out
the grains.  After 45 minutes, I added finishing hops for a minute
and poured in the fermenter, not straining out the hops or grains 
again.  A couple of days after high kruaesening, I racked off to a 
boy, this time leaving the hops and gains.  Am I screwed or should 
I relax, not worry, and have a homebrew (just got Charlie's NCJ of
HB).  I could have a new batch brewed and bottled by January and I
have everything I need except the malt extract, so I wouldn't feel
bad about doing it again and doing it right.


I am in loved with Pilsner Urquell, nectar of the gods.  I would 
like to make a clone of this mother's milk my house beer.  Charlie
has a recipe but I am sure someone has a better extract recipe  
(or just tweaked CP's a bit).  Also, what kind of lager yeast 
should I use?  I can get Wyeast 2007, 2035, 2112, 2124, 2206.  
Pilsen 2007 seems like the obvious choice or is it?  Got my fride 
all most ready.  Have a great  idea for my thermostat that I explain
in my next post.  While I'm asking, how about an extract recipe
for oatmeal stout.


While I'm on Urquell's, why was it a few years ago that it seemed
like quite a few of the 6-packs I bought were skunky and now I 
hardly ever find a bad one.  Did they change their shipping methods,
bottling methods, are they turning the stuff over faster or 
something else?


Is HBing an outlet for the perfectionist?  Knowing that you could
have done something just a bit better or different.  Hoping the 
judges don't notice an obvious flaw, a completely imagined defect. 
At least these imperfections have a use!


I won't need a can opener to brew this time next year,

Subject: Frig T-stats


Since my last post was for my own sake, I offer my insight on  
some of the few topics I know anything about, wiring and these 
confounded frig thermostats and ASCII art!!  I am a Nebraska 
Electrical Journeyman so there ;>.  The following is a great  
set-up for the HBer because it easy to make, it does no damage  
to to the frig it's hooked up to and it can be changed to a  
different frig (or any other appliance for that matter) in seconds.   
 
What I plan to do is get a stat that has a bulb on a coil that 
has *poles rated for 120V at 15 Amps*.  Needs to have a 1/2"  
knockout.  Be sure to check the temp. range.  Then I am going to 
get an orange 25" *14 gauge* extensions cord with ground and a  
1/2" romex connector and a couple of yellow wire nuts. 
 
Now I'm going to cut the cord about 5' from the female end (he  
he he, not very politically correct).  Cut about 8" off for scrap 
to use later if there is a ground screw in the stat.  Strip the  
orange insulation back 6" on both ends.  Put the romex connector  
in the stat's ko and tighten the locknut.  Then put the stripped  
ends in the connector till the orange insulation is just poking  
through the connector and tighten the screws.   
 
And now for Wiring 101.  Get that scrap and pull the green wire  
out and strip it back 2" to 1", so that the insulation is on the  
end of the wire.  I=insulation, W=wire 
 
IIIIIIIIIIIIII         IIIIIIIIIIII 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW     I 
IIIIIIIIIIIIII         IIIIIIIIIIII 
 
This way the wire doesn't fray and can be wrapped around the  
ground screw easily, if there isn't a ground screw, skip that 
part.  Strip and wirenut the two whites together.  Strip and  
wirenut the three (maybe two) greens together.  The black wires  
go under the contacter's screws and should be stripped as before  
if the screws allow.  Some screws have a little pressure plate and  
or molded slots that doesn't allow this.  If your stat has two 
throws (two switches that move together), I wouldn't recommend 
wiring the whites to the other contacts and NEVER switch the  
ground.  If for some reason the contacts would fail with the hot 
(black) on and the neutral (white) off, you have a hot neutral. 
I think that hot neutrals pack more of a shock than the hot.   
I have been shocked }:o by both but can't really prove it and have 
no intentions of doing so either.   
 
I love velcro, so I will put some on the stat, the bulb, and the  
frig to mount it.  Plug in the stat and the frig.  Set the stat 
and your done.  I plan on using a thermometer at first to double  
check the stat's calibration. 
 
- --- 
 
I have an idea about aeration filtration.  Take two hole stopper  
insert a tube that reaches near the bottom of your vessel and one 
that is about an inch past the stopper.  Fill the vessel half  
full with 190 proof and stopper.  Connect the long tube to air pump 
and the short on to the air stone.  Oh no, more ASCII art ... V=Vessel, 
T=Tubing, S=Stopper, B=190 Proof.

Subject: Help - Really slow fermentation of first fruit beer


Greetings oh wise and wonderful masters of the brewers art:


I attempted my first fruit beer this weekend (Sun) and the
fermentation has not been as active as I normally get.


I used a modified version of the Washington Apple Ale
on Cat Meow:


1lb Crystal Malt 120L (steeped for 30min)


Added
4lb Tefford Yorkshire Nut Brown Ale Extract
1lb Pure Clover Honey
1lb Light Dry Malt Extract
        Boiled 30min


        Reduced heat.
Added Apples (5lb) and spices
        Steeped 20mins.


Hopped as follows:
2.00oz Fuggles 4.5% 30min
1.00oz Hallertau Leaf 10min and still in primary.


Strained the wort through a fine grain bag over
ice water into bottling bucket.  Left cool to 65F.


Pitched Wyeast 1338 European Ale (packet activated 2days previous and had 
really expanded) into primary and racked beer on top. (Got some more hop 
sediment out that way). Areated really well by stirring.


Added water to bring to 5.5 gal.


O.G. 1.045


The brew has simply not had the active fermentation I am used to.
I cracked the primary today to take a hydrometer reading and there
was an inch of foam but not much pressure escaped.
The gravity today was just over 1.040 which means there has not
been much activity.  The brew tasted fine but I could really taste
the honey and was very sweet.


First should I just wait?
Repitch new yeast?


Did I boil the honey too long?
Did I activate the Wyeast too early (hence it was pretty well spent when I
pitched so didn't get a good start)?


I am considering starting to use a secondary to get clearer beer now that
I am using more speciality grains.  


Would adding some finings help clear this beer as it is pretty cloudy?


I await your sage advise.


In the mean time I won't worry and will relax with a homebrew.

Howdy,
  I'm thinking about getting an Oxynater from Liquid Bread.  It is an
oxygen tank, some sort of regulator deal, and SS diffusion stone.  The
price is $39.45 (including shipping).  Their ad claims you can oxygenate
75-100 gallons of wort with 1 tank (extra tanks are $12). 


Anybody have experience with these setups?  If so, can you get the tanks 
filled somewhere, such as a medical place, welding place, etc?

Howdy,
  I received 2 replies to my inquiry about the ABG Advance Homebrewers 
Weekend Classes.  One had taken the course and was dissappointed in the 
level of the material.  He and the other 'all-grainers' learned little.  
The 'extract brewers' in the class seemed much more satisfied.  The 
second replier hadn't taken the course, but had heard from people who did 
that the course is of little value if you can understand what is talked 
about in the HBD.


Thanks for the input.  FWIW, I'm saving my money.

There might indeed be people who have gone back to extract, though
I suspect that most people, once they have made the investment in time
and money to get through the first all grain batch will want to continue
at it, to do better next time, to tinker with the method or the recipe,
as most homebrewers seem to like to do.  I certainly doubt anyone would
go back to extract forever because of high equipment costs.  They have
already bought the stuff by then!  But that also does not mean that an
all-grain brewer will forsake extracts forever, either.
  
I "graduated" to all grain brewing after a year of brewing with extracts,
but I never gave up extracts entirely.  I thought the all grain brews
were great, but there comes a point when quality versus effort has to
be considered.  My premium beers that I would sip in the evening and
enter in competitions were usually all grain.  My first run with a new
yeast or other experimental batches were usually extract so that if it
turned out bad, then at least I haven't spent 6 hours in the kitchen
to crank out a bad batch.
  
When I would brew a batch of non-descript ale for the odd summer picnic,
I also often went the extract route.  It's easy, it's predictable (as
long as I used the same supplier of fresh extract), and it makes quite
good enough beer for a casual setting.  Heck, it even makes award
winning beer sometimes, as you can see from the winner lists in various
competitions.  So no, we don't all give up on extract, but maybe we
don't spend as much time discussing it as we do all-grain.

Greg Heiler writes about gushers after dry hopping with leaf hops.
  
>instantly foams up and fills the glass. When it settles, I'am left with

Yes, right on target.  Whether from leaf hops or from something else.
  
>Further evidence is the extended resurgence of air
>lock bubbling after dry hopping.
  
Resurgence is the key word here.  It is possible that the infection was
already in place and just took time for the bacteria to multiply to high
enough numbers to make fermentation appear to take off again; however,
if the leaf hops did introduce scads of new bacteria in there, then
this resurgence is exactly what you would expect.
  
How is the flavor?  I think that with a ring and serious gushing,
you are looking at infection problems, and the flavor should let you
know if it's bacteria and not slow working yeast.
  
>Is dry hopping with whole leaf riskier than plugs or pellets?
  
No idea, but don't believe anyone who tells you that bacteria CANNOT
live on leaf hops because hops are antibacterial.  The components in
hops, yes, when reacted in the brew kettle, are antibacterial (maybe
just bacteriostatic), but any kind of dust and stems and traces of
bird droppings and who knows what else on the hops can harbor bacteria.
It's just a chance you take in dry hopping beer.
  
I would NEVER repitch yeast left after a dry hop.  I would also tend
to dry hop batches that were already high in preservative hop bitter-

If I was to use the yeast, I would wash it instead of pitching onto the 
trub-laden yeast. Then again, your barleywine might well mask any off 
flavors from the trub?   However ... how do the OGs of your "Winter 
warner" and your "Barleywine" compare?  Your yeast is acclimated for the 
gravity environment of the "Winter Warmer", and might not do so well in 
your Barleywine if it has a substantially higher OG.

I have sort of settled on 4.75 to 5 OZ for my taste.  I used 4.5 OZ for 
an amber ale and got what I would term low-to-medium carbonation - nice 
and light, and it took 2 or 3 weeks to get there.  I would suspect that, 
for me, 4 OZ would either take forever to carbonate, or would be too 
"flat" for my taste.  My guess is that if you leave it long enough, you 
will get enough carbo to make it drinkable (depending you _your_ taste).


There should be enough yeast in there, especially with the bottling 
yeast. With an OG of 1080, it should hold ok for awhile in the bottles to 
see if it will eventually carbonate "as is", and if I were you, that's 
what I would do :-).  If I was to add anything, it would be some more 
priming sugar or extract.

Phil Seitz's Belgian series suggests for a 5 gal tripel batch:  bottling 
yeast (slurry from a 1 pt starter) and 1 cup priming sugar (i'd estimate 
abt 5 oz).

Subject: RE: Bleach/Dioxin


There are a few points that I really want to bring into the discussion about 
bleach and dioxin.


As Tim Lacy mentioned in HBD 1880 dioxins are a group of organic compounds.
One of those compounds got very famous in the mid-seventies when there was a
desaster
in a chemical plant in Seveso, Italy. There about 100g (~4 ounces) of
2,3,7,8-Tetrachloro-dibenzo-para-dioxin (TCDD) were blown into the air.
(Since that word is quite hard to pronounce, the mass-media made the word
dioxin famous.)
The people found out that something had happened when they found most of the
cattle
being dead the next morning. 
In Seveso no human died, but the people had serious problems with their skin.
Today twenty years after the desaster a lot of people suffer of
consequential diseases.
(I am sorry, but I do not know what kind of diseases right at the moment,but
if you are interested I am sure I can get that information.)
Furthermore the infant-mortality and the number of people suffering from
cancer seems to be higher in the area around Seveso (not scientifically
proofed).


Dioxin is synthesized when any material that contains chlorine (and almost
every material does so) is burnt at not very high temperatures.
Even if a campfire burns a very small amount dioxin of is formed 
(It`s not detectable, but fires are the reason why there is dioxin in our
nature that was not made by mankind).
Once a chemist told me that the reason why humans are quite resistant to
dioxin is that we are the only species that has been exposed to smoke for
more than 500000 years and we simple got used to it(I don`t know if it`s
true, but I really can imagine it is).




Nevertheless today it is known that dioxin is the most toxic substance that
has ever been made by mankind.
Only 0.0000000000005 g (!!!!!) of TCDD will have toxical effects on a human
being.
For that reason it is a little bit strange if Tracy Aquilla says in HBD 1880 :


>Recent estimates of the world-wide production of dioxin are about 35 pounds
per year.


You could kill more than the whole population of the earth with that 35
pounds!!!






But I don`t think that you can get dioxin into your homebrew if you use
bleach-solution to sanitize your equipment. I also clean my things with
bleach and I can tell you that I have had more than only one homebrew  (:-)
 . As you can see I am still in a good shape, so my theory is that no dioxin
can be found in a homebrew.
I do not really know how bad bleach is for the environment but 
I found a book which said that Hypochlorite-solution has been used since
1785 (!) as a bleaching agent. I would appreciate any info about that topic
but please mail private since I do not know if chemistry&environment is the
correct topic for the HBD




I hope I did not make anyone of you go wild, by talking about chemistry in
this forum,
but I think it is important to know all that dioxin-stuff.
And now I am rather thirsty.


Prost!!!

Ooops.  That was me, I believe.  I try to always shorten my posts when I 
re-read them, but sometimes that results in overly cryptic portions.


Pre-boiling the brewing water is important for lots of brewers--they may 
need to sanitize the water or may need to drive off chlorine or excess 
water hardness.  Some brewers may be able to brew with water straight from
the tap.  That is what I referred to (Brewer A has to pre-boil his well 
water because of hardness.  Brewer B can put his well water straight into
the brewpot because it is perfect for brewing right from the tap.  Everyone 
is different.).


Boiling the wort is a whole 'nother issue.  When using extracts and not 
adding hops or anything else (typically a "kit" brew), you may well benefit 
from not boiling very long.  Some kits are pre-boiled, others benefit from 
typical boiling--depends on how the kit or extract was prepared.


When you add your own hops or mash grains or do several other things, a good
vigorous boil for 60 minutes or more is almost mandatory.  This is also a 
whole 'nother topic.


How to avoid burning your wort?  Possibly just using a thicker bottomed pot 
would help spread the heat better.  If using extract, it helps to boil the 
water first, take the pot off the heat, add the extract, and stir until 
everything is dissolved.  Then put it back on the heat.  This stopped all my
wort burning problems long ago.  Factors include how the heat is applied 
(gas vs. electric and how hot), the pot (aluminum clad bottoms spread heat 
nicely, thin stainless steel bottoms don't and burn things more easily), 
whether anything settles on the bottom, etc.


Sorry to imply anything confusing earlier.  And the same goes for whatever I
have above that confuses, too. <grin>

Subject: Going Back To Extract


Mike Cinibulk asks if any all grain brewers have gone back to extract.  Well
Mike, I've been brewing all grain for about a year and a half now and in
front of the Digest I will now reveal my deepest, darkest secret.


This summer, the tanks were getting low and between kids, sports, and my
wife, my schedule was such a mess that I couldn't find a day to dedicate to
brewing.  I then decided that necessity dictated that an extract "quickie"
was in order.  I whipped up an extract ordianry bitter from extract with a
very small (and quick) mini-mash.  I did a full volume boil since I have that
capability anyway.  The whole process took 3 hours start to finish including
cleanup.


The resulting beer was a good, solid bitter.  Was it as good as my all grain
version?  Probably not.  Was it better than empty tanks?  Absolutely.


So there you have it - confessions of a (sometimes) closet extract brewer. 
Seriously, there seems to be a perception on the digest that there is
something "wrong" with extract brewing.  Nothing could be further from the
truth.  I've had some wonderful extract brews.  I enjoy the all grain brewing
process and the tinkering (and control) that the all grain process makes
possible and now that winter is upon us, I've bought a couple of 50 lb sacks
of grain and things are again busy at the Crapshoot Brewery.

Fellow beer aficionados, let me start this post by saying this

I have a patent pending on a beer trivia/educational board game that

Before proceeding any further with development and manufacturing, I would
like to check market viability. I feel that this is an excellent forum
in which to take a sample survey.


I would pose two questions:


1) Have you ever seen or heard of such a game ?
2) Do you think it will sell ?
   
Understandably, I can't go into the details of the game, but I can tell
you that it incorporates a wide variety of beer/brewing related elements
and is structured for novice, intermediate and advanced levels of play.
The game does not promote drinking, but rather a greater knowledge of the
subject we all know and love.

HBD MOMism.  RIP.


I am certain that there is no difference.  I have seen this argued wrt
bottle fermented champagne as well, but never in any way convincingly.
Bubble size is dependent on factors that have apparently not been well
resolved (protein size?), but the manner and speed in which CO2 is
dissolved is manifestly not a factor.  It does seem that coarse bubbles
and poor head retention may go together, but that may just be that
coarse bubbles make a coarse head, which collapses more quickly.  Right
now  I have on tap a lovely Dusseldorfer Alt that I kegged, force
carbonated, and tapped the first glass of all within one hour.  It has a
fine bead (as opposed to coarse, that's champagne talk, it means the
bubbles are tiny) and great head retention.

Subject: Boiling water/Ice chiller


In the HBD from 11/14/95, Phil.finkle ask if it is necessary to boil well
water.  I would have to say yes, it is necessary.  For the same reason you
boil water before feeding to newborn infants.  You should boil all water to
remove the chance of bacterial infection.  And after all, isn't a batch of
brew as helpless as a baby??  I would be especially careful of well water,
which may or may not be chlorinated.  Then there is the carbon filter angle.
 Would one of you chemist/water treatment types care to educate us further?


In the same issue Glen R. Geisen ask about using ice as a wort chiller.  I
had one experienced brewer tell me about a similar approach, but he kept the
ice sealed in small, plastic bottles that he debugged with a sanitizer before
adding to the hot wort.  He claimed it was fast, easy to reuse the bottles
and not as water intensive as an immersion chiller.  I like my immersion
chiller just fine.  Although I am thinking about adding a second coil to act
as a pre-chiller.  You know, say 5 or 10 feet of 3/8 od copper wound in an
ice bath.  Any suggestion would be appreciated.

   i recently left a bavarian pilsner in a glass carboy for 2-3 weeks
 after racking off the primary and then again a couple days later
 off the secondary (yeah, i know my subject line inappropriatly said 
 i left it in the secondary). i had a question prior to brewing 
 this batch about the effects of "quasi-long-term" aging in the carboy.
 responses generally said that some problems might arise in carbonation
 of the beer due to the lack of viable yeast. they suggested adding 
 some yeast to the carboy prior to priming. well....i did, i believe
 i added more than enough yeast. i added about 1/2 a pack of dry ale
 yeast (i know, i should measure, but didn't know appropriate amount, 
 hence my question) the night before bottling/priming. the next day,
 there was a considerable amount of "trub?" in the bottom, which
 kinda defeated by PART of my purpose of racking off the primary,
 i.e. less sediment in the bottles.
 
   how much yeast (5 gallon batch) should i have added and when?

Subject: Force vs natural CO2


The idea that force carbonated beer has different/coarser bubbles than
natural carbonation would create is just another momism.
I've been force carbonating since I started kegging about 2 years ago. The
counterpressure filled beers I've entered in contests have never been dinged
points for carbonation.
Even a force carbonated Weizen this past summer came out 'highly
effervescent' as per the style guideline, and took Best of Show.


My guess is that the make up of the beer itself has more to do with this than
anything else.
Doesn't club soda come across as being rather coarsely 
carbonated?

I think most of your argument holds water, but this is a needless
distinction to make.


The actual *contents* as required by law, read "liquid yeast & malt
nutrient" (I know this, because I've been typesetting their labels from the
beginning).

Actually, Tracy, most of the packaging refers to "pure yeast cultures" and
always have.  The label in question is used on several different packages:
"pure yeast cultures" is on the section with Wyeast's old line; the "advanced
yeast culture" is on the advanced strains (originally produced without the
smack pack); and the last group are the high volume yeast blends.
