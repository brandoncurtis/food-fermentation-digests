The Tenth Annual November Classic BJCP Homebrew Competition
Madison Homebrewers and Tasters Guild
12 November 1995


The competition gave _all_ judges a "Best of Show" judging experience in 
that entrants place their entries, identified and judged by style, as they
choose in three categories: This, That, and The Other Thing.  This year
we also added a "Just Plain Good Homebrew Category," judged solely on 
drinkability and whatever other criteria the JPGH judges chose to apply.


Best of Show: GEORGE FIX
2nd BOS: ROBB HARRIS
Total entries: 51


Thanks to all the entrants and judges, and thanks to the Wine and Hop Shop
(Madison) and HOPUNION, USA for their support and sponsorship.

And eight brewers stepped up to take the Great Dane Challenge....
The winner will be assistant brewer for the day (probably handling
spent grain :-) ) late in January to brew a scaled-up batch of the
winning homebrew.  The GDC beers were judged by Brewmaster Rob LoBreglio
and MHTG President Mitch Gelly.  Watch the Great Dane handpump in 
early February for a Columbus dry-hopped pale ale!  The brewer
might even treat you to a pint. :-)

Subject: Fermentation vessel seals


In some private e-mail, we have been discussing various vessels used 
for fermentation and how they are sealed.  My primary fermenter, a 
food grade plastic bucket, has a very tight fitting plastic lid.  So 
tight fitting in fact that I need to use Wesson oil on the rim of 
the bucket to get the lid in place.  Another HBDer also using a 
plastic bucket, has a much looser fitting lid.  As for carboys, some 
homebrewers use very tight fitting rubber stoppers with an airlock. 
Some use the orange carboy cap with twin extruded orifices, which
seems to be a very loose fit in comparison to the rubber stopper 
method.  But the looser fitting carboy cap method eliminates the 
possibility of a stopper being forced into the carboy and thus 
the ensuing expletives and efforts to remove the stopper.


Understand that no one has experienced a bad batch attributed
to these different methods, but I was left wondering why 
these differences exist, under what circumstances the homebrewing 
community prefers to use one method over another, by using one 
method versus another, are we setting ourselves up for failure, 
could our lives (at least with respect to homebrew attempts) be made 
easier my using one method over another, are there other sealing 
techniques to which we haven't even been exposed, etc. etc.?


Any and all comments/teachings on this subject would be greatly 
appreciated.

Subject: RE IBUs


In #1886, joep`at`informix.com (Joe Pearl) writes about IBU calculations:


>I have two different methods of calculations, both give different answers. 
>Is there a definitive, accurate method of calculating IBUs that someone can 
share?


No "definitive" method.  There are various methods and they each have 
their supporters.  People I have talked with use whichever they feel 
comes closest to their brewing results - most have used either Tinseth's 
or Rager's.  Personally I use Tinseth's new numbers.  I like them because 
they take into account the Gravity of the wort.  The hop FAQ has the 
calcs needed to calculate them.    


I used to calculate 6 IBU ratings using 3 factors (Tinseth, Rager, and 
Garetz) with 2 calculations each (one from hop FAQ and one from Brewers 
Resource catalog).  The ratings DID range all over the map.  For example:


chinook        3oz        60 mins        12% alpha
EKG            2oz 15 mins         5%alpha


yielded these IBUs (without taking gravity into account):


   IBUs>   166             146              130            173              152              136
Factors>  Rager   Tinseth   Garetz   Rager   Tinseth   Garetz
                   (old)                      (old)
         |-----------------------|  |------------------------|
            Brewers Resource Cat.            HOP FAQ
 
That's a range of 173 to 130, and an average (mean) of 147.


The same hop schedule run thru Tinseth's "new" numbers yields these IBUs:
       
  OG>     1040     1050     1060     1070
- -----------------------------------------
IBUs>      155      142      129      118


I use these calcs for whole hops.  If using pellets, I add 15%.


Of course all these numbers are only as good as my spreadsheet, so blame 
me of they are off.

There is really no mystery; what is going on is really very simple.
The
wort in the bottom of the kettle is hotter than that above it.  It
boils, bubbles of steam (gaseous phase of dihydrogen monoxide) are
formed, they rise, reach the cooler wort, and condense back into into
the liquid phase, never reaching the top for you to see.  Eventually,
the entire wort reaches 100C, steam bubbles don't condense and the rise
all the way to the surface for you to see.


The "rioting of marbles" is called "bumping," and is caused by
superheated (100+C) liquid water that has not changed phase into the
gaseous phase due to a lack of a nucleation point.  When a "cell" of
this does change phase (boil), it does so all at once with a
mini-explosive expansion, producing shock waves, which we hear.  A way
to produce smoother boils (without bumping) is to use boiling "chips."
I use a few bottle caps from which I've removed the plastic liners and
bent in half so I don't mistakenly bottle with them later (I've done
it).  These provide nucleation points for the phase change with the
result of smoother boils.

Al, that was a good experiment you wrote up for the Great Grains Issue. I found
it quite interesting. But what is your point with your last statement?
"look HAUNTINGLY SIMILAR..." What is your point in posting this to the HBD? 


If you will remember, we exchanged email on this very subject. The day after I
submitted my article to Brewing Techniques, I was browsing at The Brewery Web
Page and found your 1992 post listed there in the Technical Library. I
IMMEDIATELY emailed you and mentioned the similarity of the drawings to what
was going to appear in BT. You Thanked me for notifying you of the coincidence
and said that you would have indeed been upset to have seen those illustrations
without any reference to your previous post, assuming that they were the
source. I explained that I had not joined the HBD until the following spring
and had never seen your post until (today). I thought we ended the 4 post
exchange with the understanding that I had not plagiarized your work. Do you
wish to re-visit that discussion via your statement above, or is it merely a
misunderstanding over a poorly worded afterthought?

Subject: Weissbier


Dear Weissbier Fans,


I am looking for some tips about all grain Weissbier. I want to get that nice
banana fruity aroma like in Schneider Weisse or Ayingers. I have read Eric
Warner's book but feel his recipes (decoction mash) are a little too
complicated. But may be it's necessary to do it that way. 


My first attempt came close but I am not quite satisfied, it's too phenolic.
I used 6 lb wheat malt, 4 lb 2 row british barley (6 row was not available),
1/2 lb flaked barley, 1 oz Northern (90 min), 1 ozHallertauer 10 min and
Wyeast  bavarian wheat.
Mashed in with 2.5 gal 60 C hot water, hold at 50 C for 30 min, then
increased by adding a gal boiling water and heating to get to 68 C. Hold
there until Iodine test negative (3h !!!), sparged boiled, cooled (20 min)
pitched. Bottled after 4 days using 1 and 1/4 cup of corn sugar.

Subject: Partial mash


Dear Friends, hate to be picky, but...


In HBD 1884 Dan Wilson asks:


>And finally, when grain is used in the recipe (like crystal, or
>chocolate malt) is that what's referred to as a partial grain 
>batch?


To which Kurt Dschida replied:
>Yes.  Most often referred to as a "partial mash".


Sorry Kurt, not so.  If it is a mash then there must be base malt
undergoing conversion.  When crystal, chocolate, etc are being
steeped for addition to an extract batch, it is simply
that--steeping.  Around here, anyway, we call that "extract plus
specialty grains."  Partial mash means you get part of your
*fermentables* from mashing; crystal and roasted malts do not
contribute much in the way of fermentables.  This is also referred
to as a "mini-mash".  The size of the mash can range from quite
small (just a kilo [couple of pounds]) to extensive.  In my case, I
mash between 3.5 and 4 kg (7.5 to 9 lb) and use a kilo or less (2.2
lb or less) of extract for gravities of 1050-1060; for lesser OG's I
need no extract at all.  Don't know what that makes me...

Subject: TCDD


Tom Krivek writes (in #1886): "Only 0.0000000000005 g (!!!!!) of TCDD will
have toxical effects on a human being." That's 5E-13 grams or half a pico
gram. With a molecular weight of about 320 thats 1.6E-15 moles or about 25
million molecules; 5E-9ug/kg in a 100 kg human. The numbers I have indicate
that the TCDD acute lethal dose in lab animals (doesn't say whether that
thats MLD or LD50) is 0.6ug/kg in guinea pigs and 5000ug/kg in hamsters
with humans supposed to be at the less sensitive end of this range thus the
lethal dose for me would be close to half a gram (please don't work it out
 - the beer gut really isn't all that huge). Thus I am skeptical that an
exposure 12 orders (or 9 if I'm more of a guinea pig than a hamster) of
magnitude less than this would be too threatening. I'm guessing that either
a couple of 0's must have been slipped in there somehow or the number came
from expert testimony for the plaintiffs in some class action suit. I, for
one, shall continue to struggle on through life unencumbered by fears of
dioxin poisoning unless a herbicide plant opens in the vicinity.

Yes, I fully agree.  It is an easy thing to observe, you can do it with a
minimum of difficulty yourself.  I had recently brewed and pressurized two
beers with the regulator set at about 30 psig.  One keg happened to have a
one foot length of hose to the tap - the other had about seven feet of 3/16
diameter hose.  Both beers had been sitting in the fridge for about a week.  


I noticed MUCH more foam from the shorter hose than from the seven foot
hose.  So I simply swapped the hose/tap gizbobs from one beer keg to the
other.  No surprise to see the greater amount of foam upon dispensing was
still from the longer length hose.


Pardon me for rambling on but this simple test/demonstration is from the
most basic classic method of investigation known as the Scientific Method.
>From day one eons ago in grammar school science we were all taught the
quintessential method of go/no go testing.  Do a test and observe the results.


I think that so many questions can be easily answered by doing simple test
and observe
procedures.  Homebrewers should put this tool in the top drawer of their
toolkit.


Happy brewing

Subject: Priming Amount


I have a Bock beer sitting in my secondary that I'll be bottling soon.  
My question is:  Are Bock's supposed to have low carbonation?  I was 
going to bottle with 1 1/4 cups DME, but after trying a Bock the other 
day, it seemed to not be very carbonated.


Would 1 1/4 cups be too much?  Should I maybe use 3/4 cup?


I'd appreciate it if someone would respond.


Thanks,

Subject: Any wine makers out there?


Let's face it... brewers are 'hands-on' folks. Beer doesn't very readily
make itself. Wine on the other hand occurs spontaneously.  Squeeze it, wait
a while and then drink it. None the less, it is an interesting pursuit - as
long as you have lots of patience. Perhaps easier to make but much longer to
appreciate.  And you must make much larger quantities since you only make it
once a year. I've made a total of <3> vintages so far. It's fun but beer
produces results much faster and lends itself to much more variety and
experimentation.


Anyway, whenever I do a web search for wine making, I come up with maybe a
faq or two but have not yet found anything resembling HBDigest. So... does
anyone out there know of a home wine making digest? Mostly, I find pages on
the web for people selling wine or talking about where to go wine tasting
but not making wine.


Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.

Subject: Sankey boiler pickup tube


Hi All,


I have a question regarding design of a pickup tube in the bottom of a 
converted Sankey boiler.  Initially, I was planning to use a very small 
circular slotted copper manifold to strain hops out during transfer of the 
chilled wort to the fermenter.  However, I like to use pelletized hops and 
soon began to realize that the manifold hop-back is probably only effective 
with leaf hops.   My thoughts are that a hopback-type strainer would be 
unnecessary if using strictly pellets, due to the cylindroconical design of 
the keg bottom.  Specifically, a simple pickup tube from the fittings 
at the side of the keg to the very bottom of the keg may actually facilitate 
removal of the hop pellet debris *prior* to transfer of the wort---in much 
the same way yeast sediment is removed from a cylindroconical fermenter.  
Will this work?  Any experiences, comments, criticisms, suggestions welcome.   
Thanks and I'll summarize if interest warrants.


Tim

To all you yeast ranchers:  I just finished the last drop of a Young's Winter 
ale.  Holly butterscotch!!  I've never had butterscotch flavors so prominent 
and spectacular.  I want some.  What strain of yeast do they use (it did not 
taste like any Wyeast strains), or better yet, where can I get my hands on 
some?


If it is not commercially available, I'm willing to pay for a culture.

I think I'd say "All-grain IS an end in itself, as well as a means to an end.
There is something mystical about converting grain into sugar, and then into
beer.  Makes me feel so connected, so powerful, but also so much in awe of
nature (which can pretty much make beer without me).

Agreed, and I've made hideous all-grain beers, but I've also made hideous
extract beers.  Sigh.  BUT, I have more fun making all-grainers, good or
bad, than extracters.

As the bottom the the kettle, the liquid is heated to the boiling point
by the heat source and bubbles of vapor begin to form.  As these bubbles
encounter cooler liquid and the vapor condenses and the bubbles collapse.
It is the collapsing of the vapor bubbles that gives rise to this noise.
I would not consider the liquid to be boiling until the bubbles reach
the surface and one observes the rolling action.

A good visual/auditory indication of 170-180F is that a layer of steam forms
above the water, and it starts to make noise (that pre-boiling "roar" :-).


Works for me, anyway.

Subject: Grain Mills and Sam Adams


Thought I would add this to the grain mill thread.  I wanted a JS Mill
but at the time could not afford it ($100+).  Instead, I got a good
(read $56) deal on a lonely phillmill gathering dust in my local
homebrew shop.  The shop's big seller seemed to be the corona type. 
Anyway, it takes me about 45 minutes to mill 20lbs of grain on my
philmill, and the mill does a terrific job  adjusting to different grain
sizes.  This helps a lot since I normally use 3-5 different types of
grain and they often require a different setting for the right crush. 
Drawbacks are (1)it needs a better chute for collecting the grains, and
(2) it doesn't look as good as the JS Mill IMO.  My $0.02.


Regarding Sam Adams, I think it's great I can get an alternative to
megaswill just about anywhere and usually in the form of a Sammy.  But
it's ususally only the Bosten Lager that's available; I hope the Stock
Ale becomes as widespread. That's my $0.04 for this digest.

Subject: Boiling Stone Followup


     First I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my question about 
     Boiling Stones (HBD#1884.)  
     
     I had a couple people ask exactly what Boiling Stones were, so I will 
     explain:  They are used in Chemical applications (mostly R&D that I 
     know of) to bring solutions to a quicker boil without it being too 
     vigorous (I know - very simplistic answer - I'm trying to save 
     bandwidth.)
     
     To summarize the answers I received, though:  It seems people use a 
     number of things as boiling stones with varying amounts of success.  
     Among them were:
                        sections of copper tubing
                        non printed bottle caps
                        glass or ceramic disks
                        marbles, and
                        small (1/4") river rocks
     
     Most of these seemed to work fairly well for people, although a couple 
     people complained of the boiling stones (or whatever they used) 
     retaining heat and caramelizing their wort.  It seems to me (after 
     conferring with a colleague of mine - happy Shane?), that if one were 
     to use just a few pieces of some very light, porous material (ceramic 
     perhaps?) one would get the best results.  There would be decent 
     amounts of bubbles coming from them (to control the boil and prevent 
     the dreaded boil-over), and they would tend to drift around with the 
     currents in the kettle due to their light weight (which would prevent 
     caramelization.)
     
     Just a summary of the answers I got and my $.02 worth
     
     Thanks again all,
     Norm

I had the same problem last year, and living in Montreal, It snows 
half the year.  My solution to this was to install a 3500 watt hot 
water heater element in a keg and to plug the thing into my dryer 
outlet in the basement.  This setup works great!!  The whole thing 
cost less than $100 cdn (I did scrounge some parts..) and was money 
well spent. I'm out of the kitchen (read I can make as big a mess as I 
want) and I get nice fast boils.   Some people may speculate about 
scorching the wort, but I can tell you that this is not a problem.  
There is some residue on the heater element but it's not brurned and 
wipes off ithe a rag during cleanup.

In a tubing catalog listing stainless fittings available as part of
custom tubing assemblies are Tri-Clamp fittings and a second sanitary
type referred to simply as "Mini Sanitary".  It appears these Mini fittings 
clamp together like Tri-Clamps do, and maybe seal on the

about 1" OD.


Is anyone familiar with them and with the availability of matching

Does this include outright lying?  The fellow who claims to be Jim Koch on
the radio is actually an actor.  The recipe that he claims is his
grandfather's is actually a purchased recipe from a beer consultant.
Claim to some of his rewards have gotten him in trouble with the awarders.
To me, "misleading" is a nice way to put it.

In the prospectus of their stock offerings, they say that Boston Beer Co.'s
competition is Sierra Nevada, Pete's, & Anchor, and other craft-brewers.  I
don't remember A/B, Coor's, or Miller being mentioned.  This is basically
Koch's own admission.

I agree completely with you on this.  He has raised awareness, but couldn't
he have done it more honestly?  It doesn't cost more to be honest, & it can
be more impressive, if done right.


What about the lawsuit issues?  Koch is filing lawsuits left & right
against just about anyone he can.  He threatened to sue a brewpub here in
Austin for serving Sam Houston Austin Lager.  Koch cliamed to own the
trademark on Sam Houston.  He also keeps harrasing Boston Beer Works, a
small Boston brewpub, because he claims he owns the rights to the name of
Boston.  The courts keep laughing & turning him down, but he keeps
appealing, draining the finances of this small business.


As far as the quality of his beers, most of them are nice, clean, less than
full flavored facsimiles of the style.  I think they make great transition
beer, & will recommend them as such, but I've enjoyed the Rogue & Anchor
products much more as being more flavorful, and more challenging.


Mind you, I don't boycott Sam Adams products.  I have a bottle of the
Cranberry Lambic sitting in my fridge, & I like it, even if it is
mislabled.  But every time I buy a bottle of their brew, I keep in mind
what's up in Boston.  Lot's of big companies maintain the same practices.
Koch gets a lot of hell because the craftbrewing industry is generally more
honest & congenial than that.


Well, that's enough for now.  Time for a beer.

From: Russell Mast <rmast`at`fnbc.com>
Subject: Survey Results.




A few weeks ago I posted asking for people to e-mail me telling me their
educational backgrounds for a little survey.  I got 98 responses, a couple of
which included information on additional brewers.  (One guy responded for his
son who brews with him, another for his wife and brew-buddy.)  So, my total
n is 101.  Not bad.  I'm not sure what proportion of the population here that
is, and I don't want to claim any pretense to "accuracy" - this was for fun.
Nonetheless, I want to do this as well as I can.


A few notes.  I have lumped everyone into categories.  Some people responded
with their full life stories, how much they brew and how often, whether they
have kids, what they liked best about school, what they majored in, who they
were dating, etc. etc.  Other people responded with little one-liners like 
"BS Mathematics" or something similar.  Many people didn't mention areas of
study, many did.  Many mentioned whether or not they were still in school. 
I will probably go back and report figures for these later.  Most people were
pretty clear.  There were two people who's main education was not in the US 
and I fit them into categories as best I could.  


The sample.  The sample was, as I said, 101 voluntary respondents.  All of them
homebrewers, all (save 3) of them net-connected, all of them reading HBD that 
particular issue.  I suspect that net-connected homebrewers have more degrees
than non-net-connected homebrewers, and more than net-connected 
non-homebrewers, but I have no data to back that up.  It is possible that there
is a response bias in that people with more education were more (or less?) 
likely to respond to the survey.  There's nothing I can do to control that in
this setting.  Them's the breaks.  Some of you may have lied.  Shame on you.


One person mentioned that it might be interesting to know the sex of the 
various respondents.  There was only one respondent that identified herself
as a woman, and one brewer whose wife also brews responded for a total of two.
Many, but not all, of the other respondants either explicitely identified 
themselves as male or had masculine names.  No respondants (beside the two 
mentioned above) had feminine names.  Some people didn't give their names 
and had non-specific e-mail addresses.  I may report the exact numbers for 
this later.


I must point out that none of your identities will be revealed and that I
won't sell any of your addresses to direct-mail advertisers.  (Don't you hate
that when that happens?)  If anyone wants a copy of the responses with all 
the identifying information deleted, I can do that, but it would take a few
minutes to get together.


Without further ado, the general results.  This is in a "last year completed"
kind of way.

* one person didn't finish high school, but had a PhD anyway.  That was 
counted as a PhD.  One other person claimed to have been currently enrolled
in high school, but (from other statements made) might not have been totally 
honest.  (The level of maturity in the response was kindergarten, but he said
11th grade, so I say 11th grade...)


** This was more of a catch-all category.  Several respondants had 2 master's
degrees.  Several had no master's but more than 4 years in a PhD program, 
which I also counted in this category.  


Most respondants thought this was interesting, as did I.  A few were curious
or even suspicious about my motives.  Well, this was my motive, just making
this post.  Yay.  Several people, including those with advanced degrees, 
made the point that there's a lot about life you can't learn in school, and
I'd like to echo that sentiment.


Degrees don't make you smart - dogmatically agreeing with me makes you smart.
:-)  


Hope this has been interesting.

Hello all (Hola Schwartz),
 I would like to thank everyone who responded to my post about the slits
in the copper manifold. Most everyone was in agreement as to the placement
of the slits; 1/4 to 1/2 inch apart faced down in the tun. I'll be doing
my first all grain over the holidays (gulp) and if it turns out good I'll
let you know about it, if not...well...
                                Thanks again.

Interesting. I have been doing partial mashes (or at least what *I* call
partial mashes) for six months or more now. While it does a a bit more time
to the process it really hasn't been that much. I use the same equipment
that I do for extract only recipes. I have a 21 qt enamel on steel kettle
that I use on the electric stove (boy is it getting wimpy too). I mash 5 lbs
of grain in my old 16 qt kettle by heating up 1.25 qts of water/lb of grain
to strike temp. Add the grain and stir until everything is well incorporated
and the temp levels out. Around 155F - 158F. Then it goes into a warm oven
for an hour. I take it from the oven put it back on the stove and add heat
to raise the temp to mash out stirring continuously. Then into the lauter
tun and sparge with 2qts of water/lb of grain. This goes into the boil
kettle, add the extract (since evrything is already warm) and crank on the
heat stirring until I get a boil. Easy. The hour in the oven can be used for
lots of things, like feeding the kids lunch, or sanitizing. I think it has
improved my beers. Just another data point for those considering the move to
all grain.
