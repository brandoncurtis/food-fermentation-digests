Subject: Manifold Fluid Dynamics


Dave Ludwig makes some interesting insights into Lautering behavior:


>With water in the tun, can't argue with that too much but the grain bed
significantly changes the pressure drop across the slits which, in my
opinion invalidates any area matching (too many variables: type of grain,
crush, grain bed settling, etc). Like it was said in the rest of the post,
the false bottom design seems to offer the best choice as far as
distributing flow and preventing channeling. But I think the slotted
manifold with slots downward offers some clogging resistance. Picture this;
horizontal holes trap husks until the holes are blocked with the filtering
husks.


Well, I dont think the area matching arguement is totally invalidated; you
are probably correct that it is more complicated than just area, but the
point of our BT article was that to obtain uniform flow thru the
slits/holes in any lautering device, the outflow resistance needs to be
greater than the inflow. Therefore you need to provide as much inflow area
as practical, and make the valve at the outflow the control for the flow
rate. To this end, the area arguement certainly helps.


and


>I believe that, as with the false bottom, layers of filter
material are established above the lautering device. With the false bottom
holes, it's easy to see how a piece of husk with some flour piled on top
would stop flow (stuck sparge). With described manifold, the flour is
trapped between layers all the way to the bottom. The filtered liquid can
channel across the bottom of the tun and exit up through the manifold slots
on the bottom.This is the key. My opinion is the manifold is less prone to
clogging.


With a properly saturated, fluid mash, the grist will stratify (not sure if
thats the proper term...) such that the heavier particles and husks will
settle toward the bottom providing the filter bed. Greg Noonan has a
illustration of this in his book, Brewing Lager Beer. If you stir your mash
during, you will facilitate this alluvial stratification (any soil
scientists in the house? Dave?). My point is that False Bottom or Manifold,
the grainbed will be the same. However, you are probably correct that by
facing the manifold slits down, you allow better flow across the bottom of
the cooler to the outflow than you might otherwise get thru the false
bottom.


and


> I added a standpipe to the center manifold
which extends up through a hole in the cooler lid that I use to underlet the
grain bed when adding hot water. But the standpipe needs to be capped off
when the bed get compacted so as to get max gravity benefit from the fluid
column in the exit tube. Performance? With 2 or 6 row barley malts, flow is
too fast so I throttle it back to get about an hour sparge.


My friend Paul Prozinski talked about this when we were preparing the
article, If you use an open standpipe on your outflow, you can be assured
of uniform flow by watching the water level in the standpipe. If the water
level is sucked way down, then the inflow capability is being exceeded and
channeling is occuring in the grainbed. If the level is equal or only a bit
under the water level in the tun, then the inflow capability of the
lautering device is not being exceeded and the flow thru the grainbed is
more uniform. I forget exactly why we decided to not go into this in the
article, perhaps because most brewers dont use standpipes and because the
area/valve model should remove the need for standpipe monitering.


Longer sparges definitly improve extraction.

Subject: Thanks / Fitting source


     Howdy,
     
     Due to my unexpected vacation (furlough), I haven't been able to send 
     out the summary and thanks to the nine folks who responded to my 
     question of whether to add the grains or water first in my new Gott w/ 
     copper manifold mash tun.
     
     Domenick, Neal, Dave L., Stan, Bruce, and ? (Sorry, the message header 
     was deleted when I saved the message from ccmail) said they add the 
     grains to the water.  ? (sorry again) said adding water to the grain 
     would cause stuck runoff.  Neal and Bruce suggested it was beneficial 
     to preheat the tun to get more consistent results.
     
     Jeff, Dave H., and Phil all add the water to the grains.  Jeff 
     suggested to lay foundation water to fill the manifold but that adding 
     the grain to all of the water may denature the enzymes of the first 
     grains to hit the water.  Dave H. grinds the grain the night before to 
     save time on brew day.
     
     I found a good source for SS fittings in my area, the local hot rod 
     specialty store.  I used a 3/8" flare SS bulkhead fitting and a bung 
     from a Faas Frisch (sp?) mini keg to replace the stock gasket in the 
     Gott.  I put some Teflon tape on the threads of the bulkhead fitting 
     and screwed it into the bung (very tight fit) and it works great.  No 
     leaks.  Many thanks to the guy who suggested the mini keg bung!!
     
     Now I need my boiling keg and burner and I'm ready to go (can you say 
     can't wait for Christmas?).
     
     Many thanks to all the folks who responded to my question.  I'll 
     report back after the first of the year on how my first mash goes.
     
     Cheers,

Subject: Draining


Thanks to those who helped me troubleshoot the problems with my new false 
bottom.  As it turns out, priming the outlet tube / pump wasn't really the 
problem.  And the false bottom wasn't really the problem either, although 
the problem occurred when I installed it.  The problem was that the intake 
to the outlet tube was sitting flush on the bottom of the tank.  Nothing 
could physically get into the tube.
So now my question is how to prevent this from happening again.  I could 
shorten the tube, or I could continue to let the tube rest on the bottom 
and serrate/bevel/slit/perforate the opening.  Any ideas?

I don't know if tire valves are made from butyl rubber, but I believe that 
Al's right that the aroma may permeate your beer. There's a better way to
make one of these without the rubber problem, however. Go to any tire store
that sells magnesium (mag) wheels. They don't install rubber valves with these
wheels, they use tire valves made out of stainless steel. They're only a
couple of bucks, are threaded, and have a flat flange on the bottom which 
should easily fit inside a PET bottle cap.

Subject: O2 PET permeation


Regarding the use of PET bottles, the discussion has gone like this...


>>Seems PET is gas-permeable such that a bottle 
>>will go flat after several weeks.


>It's the other way around.  A lot of CO2 won't leak out, 
>but O2 will leak in.


Now, how does THAT work??  If the inside of the bottle is under that kind of
pressure from the CO2, how can O2 permeate it??  I don't get it.  It seems
to me that if the bottle is pressurized (and I've felt PET bottles, and
they're like rock), then no gas could get in.  Please explain...

Subject: Conversion check


Hello,


 A couple of questions. My local Homebrew shop sold me an Iodophor to 
check for starch conversion during mashing. I also made up an 
iodine/potassium iodide solution we use in the lab to check for the 
presence of starch in various substances. This is 5g iodine dissolved 
in a solution of 7.5g potassium iodide in 10 ml of water, then 
diluted to 1 liter. When I use my lab solution for conversion check, 
it continues to turn dark well past the point when the iodophor is 
telling me conversion is complete. If I go by the iodophor, I usually 
have conversion in about 1 hour. According to the iodine/potassium 
iodide I don't have full conversion for 1.5 - 2.0 hours. Which one is 
right? I have been using the latter so far. Have been achieving 78 - 
80 % eff. using a 10 gal Gott, but I'm not sure if too much mash time 
is detrimental.


Anyone have a good source for an accurate and reasonably priced scale 
for  hops, aside from an electronic balance which I'm too cheap to 
buy?


Anyone have a source to buy Michael Jackson's "The Beer Hunter" on CD 
ROM?


Thanks for the help.


PS. How about a two day vacation from the HBD for Thanksgiving, I'm 
75 pages behind, can't keep up!! ;-)

Subject: Electric vs Gas vs Propane


        OK, OK... So I broke down and bought a beautiful Vollrath 38.5
quart (40 liters) Stainless Steel brewpot. I got it at quite a bargain I
believe!?  $190.CAN (137.50 U.S. approx.).
        Now, how to fill it and keep it at a rolling boil with the lid off
on my electric stove??!!?? I have one of those stoves that doesn't have
coils, but a flat metal element that doesn't get red with heat. So far I
can keep approx. 5 gallons going at a rolling boil, but the lid is partly
on.
        If I can convince my wife to get a gas stove, will I *really* see a
big difference? I mean, will I be able to boil 6 gallons of wort down to
5.5 gallons at a rolling boil and not wait for an hour before the boil
starts?
        What about those outdoor cookers everybody is using. Can I use one
when it's -10F outside? Can they be modified to be used with natural gas?
(That way I could use it inside)

Subject: Brita pH/Yeast


In #1888 Bill Watt comented that water from his Brita filter measured pH 5.
This is probably because the water contains some carbonate that was not
removed by the ion exchange process. Upon standing, CO2 will escape to the
air and the pH will increase somewhat (5.2 - 5.4 or so). Upon boiling and
cooling the water should measure close to 7 but upon standing exposed to
the atmosphere the pH will creep back into the 5's as CO2 dissolves from
the air.


Wade Wallinger had some questions on starters. The fololowing answers are
my personal opinions:


Questios for the collective:
1. When stepping up, should the contents be re-aerated?
Definitely. In fact aeration can be carried out multiple times between
feedings. As long as nutrients (amino acids included) and oxygen are
available yeast will stay in a growth phase (if glucose is relatively low).
2. When stepping up, should the ;iquid be decanted?
Yes. Decant some of this liquid and taste it. See if you want this in your beer.
3. If not, does aerating introduce the potential for aldehydes?
The byproducts of the growth phase are different (at least in relative
proportions) from the byproducts of fermentation. The broth from a growing
yeast culture does not make very good beer.
4. If not, should subsequent steps simply double the volume each time?
After getting up to a couple of litres of starter simply decant and replace
to maintain that volume. The object is to get the mass of viable yeast
cells up.
5. Am I flaming the lip at the right step?
Ideally, flame whenever a container is opened.
6. When starting a lager yeast, should it ferment at room temperature?
Yes. It will produce an undesireable mixture of esters, fusels and
aldehydes at the higher temperatures which is why you decant the liquid but
the yeast will grow faster.
7. If so, will the resulting batch be estery?
Not if you throw the liquid out.
8. How much starter to I need for a barleywine with 15# LME in 5 gallons?
I'd say about 100 ml of thick paste ought to get you around 15-18E6 cells
per ml which should be good for a barley wine.
9. IMSR
I hope not.
10. any other comments?
When using extract for yeast food it is a good idea to add some yeast
nutrient/yeast starter/yeast hulls as extracts are often deficient in FAN.

Not so fast there, Russell, while they may look like yeast, you are
forgetting about the genera Streptomyces, Actinomyces, and
Thermoactinomyces, (and I'll bet there are others that I can't think
of) all of which are gloriously procaryotic.  These are all 
filamentous bacteria.  You can't always trust the name.


While I am on the subject of microbes, has anyone ever tried pombe
beer?  I hear it is fermented with Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
If it is palatable, does anyone have a brewing culture? recipes?
It sounds foul, but hey, I won't knock it 'till I try it.

I would suggest waiting till post-kraeusen.  High-kraeusen is the point
of lowest glycogen levels and the yeast will certainly need that coming
out of their frozen slumber.  Yeast store glycogen when they sense their
sugar source depleating so that waiting till the yeast are just beginning
to sediment (starter beginning to clear) would be the point at which the
glycogen levels would be highest.  Do you see any reason why you would
not want the glycogen levels to be high?  Comments from yeast geneticits?

Aeration of hot wort causes HSA, not DMS.  Hot-Side Aeration gives sherrylike
flavours and aromas, darkens the wort and shortens shelf life considerably.
It does not increase DMS unless there's Obesumbacterium in the air ;^).

You can use direct heat to increase the temperature, so that's not a problem
and when you add the sparge water you will be running off, so you don't need
to have room for both the entire mash and all the sparge water.  I'm assuming
this is a partial-mash recipe since you couldn't get any more than about 4.5
gallons of runnings from that amount of water (maybe 5 gallons).  Still,
you won't get the right amount of yield from your grain if you cut back on
the water and if you don't cut back, you still need room for the 5 gallons
of runnings.  What you propose would slightly mess up the recipe: you would
not get as much out of your grain as Charlie did and subsequently have a much
lower OG beer and then far too much bitterness for the OG.  Big stainless
steel pots are almost always available at restaurant surplus shops (those
that buy up used equipment from restaurants when they go out of business)
and will make your life as an allgrain brewer an order of magnitude easier.


Actually, I use a 10 gallon stainless steel kettle for heating strike and
sparge water and use a 8 gallon enamel kettle for mashing (EasyMasher(tm)).
I can then run off directly into the kettle on the floor while an insulated
bucket with a spigot holds the sparge water sitting on another bucket on the
countertop next to the EasyMasher.  Typically, I get about 32 pts/lb/g (or
5.2 gallons of 1.043 beer from 7 pounds of grain).

Randy writes:
>Why would one ever need to add yeast when priming with sugar?


If you are making a very high alcohol beer, the yeast is pretty pooped-out
and will take forever to carbonate if it does at all.  I lagered a 1.074 OG
beer in the secondary for three months at 45F and it carbonated just fine
with no additioal yeast.  Adding fresh yeast at bottling time is, however,
a very popular technique among Belgian commercial brewers, but then again
most Belgian beers are quite a bit stronger than the average US or UK or
German beer.

Subject: More forced carbonation vs. natural.


Okay, so it looks to me like we've decided that there is ultimately 
no qualitative difference in the bubbles between force-carbonated beer
vs. naturally-carbonated beer.  But this raises another question in my
mind:  are there advantages/disadvantages to one approach vs. the other?
For example, does the extra aging time (presumably at or near room
temperature) of naturally-carbonated beer benefit the beer?


I mostly naturally-carbonate my kegged beers, but have been thinking
that I could start drinking them sooner by force-carbonating.  But then
I got to thinking that maybe there were other trade-off's involved....

I've been mulling this over for some time. Propane is rather expensive. In 
addition to the propane burners that Walmart carries, they carry a nice 2 
burner Coleman "white-gas" stove($40-45). The cost of white gas is about 
$3/gallon. The newer stoves state they can be run on unleaded gasoline ($ 
1.0069 here). As  soon as Christmas is over, I plan to purchase on of these 
for camping, and brewing.


It may not help your situation (you must use these outdoors), but I thought 
I'd throw it on the table as a propane and electric alternative.

Subject: re: Philmill, SA Ads


I, too, would like to echo the praises of another HBDer and Dan Listermann for
putting out a good quality, reasonably priced product. The Philmill is a well
crafted, versatile grain mill that I think most folks would give a thumbs up
to.  After making extract + specialty grain beers for a year and a half, I
have now graduated to partial mash recipes.  For specialty grains, the
put-the-grain-in-a-ziploc-bag-and-work-it-over-with-a-rolling-pin method was
okay; but when you are looking at a couple pounds of belgian pilsner malt and
want to get some kind of decent extraction rate, the rolling pin method simply
will no longer cut it.  I have only had the Philmill a few weeks, but I am a
satisfied customer.  Reasonable price, too (I paid $75).
And has anyone else found themselves chuckling at the new series of Sam
Adams<tm> television ads - the "Do you like beer?" ads!  I find myself sitting
there answering the rhetorical beer questions they pose:


"Do you like beer?"  [Duh...]
"Do you have a favorite beer glass?"  [doesn't everyone?]
"When people argue over red or white wine, do you order beer?" [yep]
"Do you know the difference between lager and ale?" [of course!]
"Have you ever thought of making your own beer?" [No, I DO make my own beer!]
"Can you name the four ingredients in beer?" [who can't?!]
"Did you ever keep a real cool beer bottle?" [several]


I think these ads are great fun, and I think they are aimed at folks like us;
the american beer consumer that like something besides BudMilloors.
They appeal to beer snobs, which I guess many of us could consider
ourselves...a very clever ad campaign by Boston Beer Co.

>Also, just as Jeff says, don't forget to add water

I think this is slightly alarmist.  Not that it
doesn't have some basis in science, but in the
practical world, I think it's not such a risk.
Sometimes practice is simpler and, some might
say, more important than theory.


Consider those who do open fermentation.  This
oxidation "risk" is certainly greatest with that
method, yet there is little evidence to indicate 
this is real problem with open ferments.  It may
be where you draw the line on when "active CO2
production is over", but the bottom line for me
is that open ferments do not cause oxidation
issues.  Forgetting to put water in your closed-
ferment air lock is such a minuscule oxidation
risk, I just don't see it as an issue.

 problems.  However I have just started another mead with 8.2 kg honey. (OG=
 1.128).  Should I pitch again before bottling? Is this going to be a still=
 mead no matter what I do?

Well, IMHO, and to put it more accurately, Jim Koch may have done more in 
the past 5 years than Fritz or Pete. But, my vote would have to put Fritz 
Maytag as the "Grandfather" of the craft/micro/great beer revolution (big 
claim, eh?). When lookng into the what Fritz has done over the years, he, 
IMHO, has done more to get this whole thing off the ground and set the stage 
for people like Pete and Koch. Fritz help the New Albion brewery get started, 
then at its demise, helped Mendicino Brewing (Red Tail Ale) grow with cheap 
equipment and other arrangements which relieved some of the financial 
pressures. He helped Sierra Nevada with equipment, who in turn helped Mad 
River (Steelhead Ale, Jamacian Red). Anchor and Sierra Nevada were the first
widely marketed craft brews on the left coast. that's a lot of tounges to 
wake up. In my research, the great beer revolution started on the left coast
and quickly spread to the right. His company, Anchor Brewing, sponsors the 
California Homebrew Club of the Year Award which encourages homebrew clubs to 
further the art/science of brewing and give something back to the community. 
Many club which win this award produce fine craft brewers, currently brewing 
great beers in micros and pubs from Hawaii to Arizona to Oregon. Here is the 
part that gets me, he does it HONESTLY, and many times without financial gain 
(or law suites) (try both of those koch). Conclusion, Fritz is instrumental in 
setting the stage for all of us. Koch is using that stage to full advantage 
(mostly his advantage). Besides, Fritz bought Anchor in the 60's and brought 
it back to life by the early 70's. That's well before anybody else got 
started.(Don't mistake non-truthful advertizing as a history lesson, Fritz is 
the grandfather of America's great beer revolution, NOT koch the imposter and 
marketing genius).

In HBD 1886 Amos says:


<From: JAWeld`at`aol.com


<In the HBD from 11/14/95, Phil.finkle ask if it is necessary to boil 
well
<water.  I would have to say yes, it is necessary.  For the same 
reason you
<boil water before feeding to newborn infants.  You should boil all 
water to
<remove the chance of bacterial infection.  And after all, isn't a 
batch of
<brew as helpless as a baby??  I would be especially careful of well 
water,
<which may or may not be chlorinated. 


I have to disagree with two points. I have made both extract and all 
grain using unboiled well water, and all four of my kids from infants 
on up have drank unboiled well water. In fact, newborns have great 
immune systems, especially if breast fed, and well water, once 
checked for E. Coliform, is very safe and relatively bacteria free. 
(of course any water may have other contaminants such as fertilizer 
byproducts, metals, etc.) There are also different types of wells. I 
would normally prefer a drilled well (75 - 200 Ft deep) that taps an 
aquifier  as opposed to a "point", that may only be 10 ft deep and 
utilizes surface water runoff.  I have never had a problem with 
bacteria infections in any of my batches, and have never worried 
about tap water contributing to contamination. I also prefer the 
taste of my well water to most municipal water systems because I 
don't like chlorine flavored water. Anybody ever experience bacterial 
problems directly attributable to use of well water ?
