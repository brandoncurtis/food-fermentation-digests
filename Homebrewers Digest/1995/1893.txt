What I meant to say was the shorter length hose always dispensed beer with
more foam.
I could not have made a more confusing statement than what was done. Sorry.
I did proof read the post (really) before it was sent.  This experience
makes me more accepting of other mistakes, typos seen from time to time.
It's easy to do.


- --------------------


At first the beer head/foam dispensing was a mystery to me until I finally
began to realize that the beer could be lightly carbonated yet produce a lot
of foam upon dispensing.  The foam seems to come from the beer being whipped
up by rapid movement (usually caused by a lot of pressure).  On the other
hand a highly carbonated beer could be dispensed without much foam if it is
dispensed slowly with little agitation.


What I do now is look at the beer in the glass once it has been dispensed
and after a few minutes I will see tiny bubbles rising from the bottom from
a well carbonated beer.
If the beer has low carbonation, even if it has a lot of foam on top,  I
will not see the bubbles rising from the bottom.  The beer can be swirled,
shaken, taped and bubbles will not appear.  I use commercial beers as a
rough yardstick to practice with.


Happy Brewing

James Hojel asks about a yeast from the Young's Brewery.


Without knowing for *certain*, I would point out that Wyeast is
now offering London Ale Yeast III (I can't tell from the fax,
but it's either 1818 or 1318, probably the latter).  These
are part of the special order strains; if you want them,
you'll have to nag your retailer.  If the yeast strains do
well, they will be added to the regular list.


At any rate, given that they already have one strain out from
the *other* London brewery, there's a good possibility that
this yeast will answer for James.

     I found a huge funnel at a discount store that fit perfectly into the 
     opening of the mill.  It did not support itself, as the 2 liter pop 
     bottle it replaced did, but that was quickly remedied with a couple of 
     screws.  If you can't find one that fits directly, you could probably 
     route the opening through the neck of a pop bottle, secured with a 
     little duct tape.  Now I just start the mill and let it run until it 
     is finished -- no refilling the hopper.  As for (2), you're on your

But, if you're steeping grains in the water, and they are on the bottom of
the kettle, they will interrupt that noise.  (Though the steam test still 
works, that is affected by humidity and air pressure and temperature in your
kitchen.  Probably not all that much, though.

And Al said:  >No, no, no, no.


Yes, yes, yes, yes! Wade is absolutely right!  The total pressure drop IS
from the pressure in the keg (where the beer is not flowing) to the exit of
the faucet where it's velocity must be sufficiently low (so that the beer
doesn't go to foam as it splashes in to the glass) that it IS essentially at
ambient pressure.  If you try to drop the pressure (suddenly) at the faucet,
the high velocity/low flow rate combination will indeed cause it to foam. 
The trick is to move the pressure loss upstream in the line (just as Wade
said).   Interestingly, a restriction at the beginning of the hose (using a
pinch clamp, say), which assuredly results in a rapid (local) static pressure
drop, is a way to make a too-short-and-too-large delivery line work.  


Maybe Al misunderstood Wade's comment, because he went on to say, correctly,

On lauter flow visualization - John P. and Al; you both need to get a grip! 
Sketches conjecturing on the behavior of a fluid passing through a porous
medium to a localized sink were probably first made by Leonardo.  Kidding
aside,  a common-as-dirt (sorry) modern analogy is that of ground water flow
into a drainage pipe.

I agree, *much less* scientific.  The way in which the mash was split-up
leaves me with considerable doubt as to the value of the extraction levels
quoted for each system (to two decimal places of SG points, or 0.03%, yet!). 
Varying amounts of extract could well have been delivered to each lauter tun
as the mash was distributed.  Also, the fact that no underletting was done
could have had a varying effect on the mechanical performance of each design.
 While this could have been mitigated by stirring each lauter mash and
allowing it to resettle, the volume of wort recirculation required to clear
the run-off would still be suspect.  The article did not say if any stirring
was done or not.  Time permitting, a number of individual runs on each
system, with the results averaged, is the right way to make such a comparison


By the way, as long as we're sensitive to giving proper credit, what was
Steve Hamburg's role in this endeavor?  The text of the article refers to the
experimenters as "we," yet there's only one name on the by-line. What gives?

Subject: Fermenter Seals and IBUs




Bill Kitt in #1890 asked why folks use different methods for sealing
their carboys and so on. No mystery here--gear is supplied by a
spectrum of manufacturers and built by the brewers themselves. I use
a food grade 8 gal plastic storage container, and don't seal the lid
at all. When I see a good kraeusen, I remove the lid completely.  Different 
folks do different stuff, and in my opinion make way too worrying is done 
over the airborne risk.  This isn't a denial of the
existence of airborne Bad Things, but krauesen-covered wort is apparently 
very resistant to infection.


As a modest contribution to the IBU thread I have the following you
should be aware of:


Using SudsW 4.0 I dialed in a 90 gallon 1.045 recipe, for which I
want 10 IBU.  I had to add 160 ounces (!) of 3.2% aa hops to get
about 8 IBU.  Using Glenn T's online "Hop-o-Matic" calculator
determined that 16 ounces would yield 10.3 IBU for the same 3 bbl
batch size.  Although SudsW has several minor bugs that are fairly
obvious, this alleged bug could be insidious since I don't know at
what batch size it goes wacky.  If you try but can't reproduce this
on your machine, please email me.

Use HOT water and dish washer detergent.  In 20-30 minutes, they will
come off very easily.  Worse case senario is that you have to use a plastic

I have to object to the idea that wine can be made only once a year and 
that wine is more limited in variety than beer.  This may be true if you 
define wine very narrowly, as being made from freshly pressed grapes and 
nothing else.  But wine can be made from all sorts of things at any time 
of the year.  Any fruit can be used (cranberry and peach are personal 
favorites) as well as other things. Ok, my potato wine may have been 
questionable, but the tea wine was excellent (wakes you up while it gets 
you drunk...).  Even if you are making fruit wine, very good wine can be 
made from frozen concentrates or frozen fruit (or even jars of fruit 
preserves), so you are not limited to the harvest season.


When you've made wine from every fruit, vegetable or other liquid you can 
think of, make them over again using honey instead of sugar for new taste 
variations.  Or try mixtures of different fruits, or use apple cider as 
the base, or start adding spices.  All beer is made from some form of 
malted barley.  Isn't that more limiting?


You can make hundreds of different types of wine from ingredients you can
buy at the local grocery store, and they are usually much cheaper than the
same volume of beer.  You can also base wine on homegrown ingredients,
such as raspberries or blackberries (easy to grow and prolific).  Since
wine is stronger and you don't drink as much (in theory), you save even
more money. 


I could go on, but I think you get the point.  To answer your question: I 
don't know of a general wine making list (I think there is a news group) 
but there are lists devoted to mead making and cider making.  I can give 
you the addresses if you can't find them.

Subject: Priming temperatures


Dear Friends, I had a question today from a lurker who'd read my
priming notes.  He'd fermented a beer at ale temperatures and then
chilled it to near-lager temps for about a day in order to help
clarity.  His question was whether to prime assuming the ale
temperature or the colder temperature.  My response was to use the
ale temperature because I thought it unlikely that the beer could
absorb sufficient CO2 from the air at the colder temperature to
reach the same level of CO2 content that a beer fermented at that
temperature would have (keeping in mind that CO2 solubility is
higher at lower temperature and that production of CO2 during
fermentation maintains CO2 levels at near-saturation in most cases).
 If one was going the other way for some reason, i.e. a beer had
been fermented at a colder temperature but then raised to warmer
temperatures for a time, I would say that one should prime assuming
that warmer temperature because it would be quite easy for the beer
to lose the CO2 it contained at the colder temperature.  What I
don't have a good feeling for is how long the re-equilibration would
take at that higher temperature.  24 hours?  72?  a week?


I thought this would be of enough general interest to post here.  Any 
comments welcome--email or post, but post might be more appropriate.


Cheers, Dave in Sydney

Subject: SUDS and caramel sugar


Hello.
I know you are all going to think I am crazy or stupid (or both), but has
anyone noticed anything unusual about the SUDS4.0 bitterness calculations?
When I use Tinseth's numbers on my home computer I get IBU values about 20%
below what I would expect in comparison to Dave Draper's tinibu program (I
recommend this to all BTW, as it makes much better use of wort gravity than
the SUDS program does). When I use *identical* (I swear!) numbers in my work
computer (I have only ever done this once, outside of working hours, just to
check, of course!), I get more realistic numbers.
For instance,
80g of 7.3% aa for 60 mins in 1.050 wort
40g of 4.5% aa for 15 mins in 1.050 wort
40g of 4.5% aa for 2 mins in 1.050 wort
vol=45 litres


I get,


tinibu => 35.3 ibu
home computer => 30.3 ibu
work computer => 36.9 ibu


I believe tinibu gives me realistic numbers. I obtained utilisation numbers
from Glen Tinseth's 1.040 column of his new data from his website.
I know enough about computers to realise that this is not supposed to
happen! Has anyone else noticed anything like this? I should also point out
SUDS tells me to add negative amounts of water in the step infusion part of
the program. It does not seem to like metric units much.

I know this has been discussed before, but I was unable to use Spencer's

flavour in beer?

Did you make a mistake?  Your agreement with Al in the first paragraph
states that you agree hose length matters.  Your second paragraph says
that when you switched the hose, the foamiest was still the same keg.
In my mind, this is a contradiction and you are saying that the hose
length does *not* matter.  Typo???

On my request for help with M&F Pale and Lager malts, the consensus was

Be very careful here, Bruce. While I've never resorted to corn or other 
adjuncts, I have intentionally made my last couple of all-grain batches 
fairly pale and bland in an attempt to appeal to my Labbat's 50-drinking 
friends. However, it appears that I have underestimated them. A few days 
ago, we went out to a bar and my girlfriend promptly ordered a pitcher of 
the darkest, heaviest beer they had on tap. I guess I looked surprised, 
because she turned to me and said, "I needed a change. The stuff you've 
been making recently is too much like all the popular commercial beers. I 
liked your beer better when it was darker, nuttier, more flavourful". 
Well gee whiz; you think you know somebody. At any rate, I have learned 
my lesson. I will no longer aspire for mediocrity. I will no longer 
underestimate my friends. Now, where did I put all those porter recipes I 
used to have?

Subject: Weissbier


Dear Weissbier Fans,


Here is the summary of replies that I got about my question: 
"How to brew a real nice (banana) Weissbier"


Yeast:


Almost all suggested using Wyeast # 3068 Weihenstephan rather than Wyeast
#3056 bavarian wheat


Fermentation:


Higher temperature (>65 F) gives more banana, 
lower temperatures gives more phenol (clove like)


Mashing:


Two brewers said only decoction gives a good result
the other replies all suggest a 3 step infusion mash. 


Grist composition:


Most brewers use a 50:50 mix of barley and wheat 10-12 lb per 5 gal batch.
One brewer even used 100% wheat, which surprised me because I thought wheat
doesn't have enough enzymes (but he admits: "yeah, my starch tests always
show incomplete conversion".) Another brewer confirmed that: "You don't need
to use 6 row. Wheat malt has more than enough enzymes to convert itself, and
6 row leaves a husky, grainy flavor on the finished product"


Hoping:


The opinion on hoping is not to use high alpha hops for bittering, rather
noble hops like Hallertauer, Tettnang and Saaz and no aroma hops at all!!! I
quote: "Weizens are supposed to have no hop flavor or aroma, late additions
are not appropriate. ... The combination of hop flavor and clove is very
unpleasant, it tastes *very* phenolic."


I am closing here and thank you all very much for your tips. I am debating
with myself what I am going to do next have a homebrew or go to the shop and
buy Weissbier supply. Yeah, may be in this order.

Yeah, I had a couple of problems:


  1) The Phil's Phalse bottom wants to float which lets grain get
     underneath it.  I bent a piece of copper tubing to fit snuggly
     around the inside the Gott cooler and place it on top of the 
     Phalse bottom.


  2) The bottom of a Gott cooler has a small dome in the center that
     would contact the elbow fitting in the Phalse bottom and seal it
     off.  I drilled a couple holes in the side of the fitting just
     below the Phalse bottom.  BTW, since I had this problem, I've
     seen Phalse bottoms that already have the extra holes in the 
     fitting.


Haven't had a stuck sparge since.

Someone in some HBD commented on the time to do a partial mash.
I do mine in the microwave. Its great! It only takes 8 minutes.
No, seriously even in the microwave it takes 1 1/2 hrs.
Ten minutes to heat the initial infusion water. An hour in the
microwave to do the actual mash steps. 20 minutes to sparge.
This is for about 2 lbs of grain, which isn't much, however

Subject: RE: Sam Adams Comments 1


Wow! Love to start (or continue) a spirited discussion!  Especially if it's
about something I feel strongly about - like Sam Adams and making
quality beer ubiquitous.


Alan P. Van Dyke writes in HD1890:


>>Keep in mind who they're competing with - and the competition's

It'd be suicide to claim to take on the giants on their own turf.  The
prospectus is right that the other craft brewers are the main
competition - but only if you assume that drinkers don't switch between
factory swill and craft beer.  Jim Koch's marketing blitz is really
focused on getting swill drinkers to switch.  Koch is smart enough to
know that capturing 1% of the swill market is a hell of a lot better
than 20% of the craft market.


And as far as the actor in the commercials:  When was the last time you
saw any movie actor do his own stunts?  Or heard a commercial of any kind 
on the mass media for a craft beer?  I'm impressed by ANY commercial for 
a craft beer.  There's nothing that says that quality beer is not compatible
with mass production and mass marketing - it works in Europe with 
Guinness (one of the largest breweries in the world and one of the best 
beers in the world) and the Munich breweries, so why not here?

Most definitely he should sue.  In the highly competitive marketing world
your names and trademarks are your LIFE.  Terms like "Boston" and "Sam" (most
of us call Sam Adams simply as "Sam") are the means that the public uses to
identify Boston Beer Company's products - and, like any company posed with
the threat of somebody ripping off their name to promote a competing product,
they have every right in the world to take all legal measures possible to
prevent this from happening.


What would happen if the Boston brewpub would come out with names for their
beers like Boston Ale or Boston Lager?  This would be an obvious
trademark infringement.  Same with calling any other beer "Sam", regardless
as to who the "Sam" in question is - especially a closely alliterative name
like "Sam Houston Austin Lager."


Interesting exercise: Name your commercially-marketed microbrew Peter's Lager
or Horseshoe Curve Steam Engine Beer and count the days before you're served
with a suit.  You probably won't have to wait very long.


I caught a lot of flack a long time ago with my brewing  friends for fiercely
siding with  Rolling Rock's lawsuit against Triple Rock Brewing Company's
(Berkeley, CA) use of the beer name "Roaring Rock", which was an obvious
trademark infringement.  Why do I feel this way?  Because trademark
infringement is a CRIME every bit as reprehensible as software piracy or
copyright infringement.  And it doesn't matter if it's a big guy vs. a little
one.  It's still a crime, a ripoff of somebody else's efforts, and any
business has the legal right to try to stop it.


So much for now.

Gee, Rob, the last time I looked taste was the main difference between
drinking beer and drinking a mixed drink, or drinking quality, full-
flavored beers and drinking swill.  Unless you're out to get drunk, what 
other rational reason is there for drinking beer, and, specifically, a type 
or brand of beer, than taste?  Image?  Sex?  Would Budweiser be a better 
beer if they put an artsy label on it and marketed it like a craft beer?
 True, 
a label can make a beer seem to taste better,  and the proper glass
definitely can, but only if you have a great-tasting beer to start with.


Finally, Kelly Jones writes in HD1891:

Have you ever bought a Burgundy wine made in the Napa Valley of California?
"Burgundy" is an "appellation controlee", or trademarked name in France
referring to the region in which it was produced, not it's taste.  However,
in California (and New York State) it's used as a simple flavor descriptor.
And the California wineries don't use the suffix "style" either.  Cranberry
Lambic is really no different.  Just as I don't expect California Burgundies
to taste as complex as the genuine item from France, I don't expect a
Cranberry Lambic to taste like it was made and blended in the Senne Valley.
What the name DOES give me, however, is some indication that the beer in
question will have fruit in it and will be tart.


If you really want to go after somebody for misleading the public - try
Pierre Celis.  If his "Pale Bock" that's really an English Pale Ale isn't
grossly and unfairly misleading the public then what is?  Yes I know he
supposedly has to do this in Texas because of the archaic liquor laws
defining "ale" as a strength, but this kind of restriction didn't stop Sierra
Nevada from calling their Bigfoot a "Barleywine-style Ale" when BATF said
they couldn't call it a "barley wine".  If Celis had been more inventive he
could
have gotten around this - he could have called it a "bitter", for example.
Or he could have put some sort of description in the label's fine print.  And
this also doesn't explain why it's still called Pale Bock without any sticker
or explanation when I see it in in the coolers in the Northeast.  At least
with a Cranberry Lambic I know I'm getting something made with fruit that
will taste tart.

And MY choice is to drink good beer, based strictly on it's merits, whether 
it's made by Jim Koch, Fritz Maytag, my fellow brewers, or myself.  And 
if the big boys ever get serious about making fine, full-flavored high
quality 
all-malt beers with taste, I won't hesitate to drink these, either.


Personally, one of the things that bugs me the most about the
present state of the good beer revolution is having to go to "trendy" 
places full of yuppies and/or self-righteous politically-correct types to 
drink good beer when I go out, because these seem to be the only places at
present that attempt to serve more than one or two varieties of good beer.  
I'd much rather drink homebrew at home or with my friends than go to places 
like this.  I believe in choice - I should be able to go anywhere, a sports
bar, a neighborhood bar, even a country and western bar, and be able to drink
the good beer of my choice - like people can in Europe.  And it's
people like Jim Koch who are going the distance to make this happen.
More power to him.

Brewer's Resource also sells a 0.22 micron sterile air filter for $3.90.
 They recommend replacing it after 10 batches.  Attach the input of the

I've had the opposite experience.  If the wort is near boiling and I add
some hop pellets, the boil immediately begins frothing up and, if not
handled, boils over.  I stop the boil, let it sit for a few minutes, and
then add the hop pellets.

Regarding to cider fermentation,  I did try both the process you 
suggest. Dont worry, the natural fermentation is working well. And 
give pretty good results... The thing is that you never know if 
the microorganism taking place first are realy Yeast! It could 
be... mould or such other indesirable creature :-o  .


For that reason I suggest you to increase apple juice temperature 
to 20 - 25 degre C as soon as you decide to begin fermentation. 
This will give a chance to natural Yeast. Then, once the 
fermentation is proporly installed, try to cool down the 
temperature for a slow fermentation.


Since natural yeast are possibly less resistant to alcool than 
selected champagne yeast, you will probably not get a full sugar 
fermentation. It might give you a slightly sweet cider which is, 
IMHO, not bad at all ;-).


This year, for the first time, I tried two fermentation processes, 
one natural and the other started with commercial Yeast and both 
with the same pressing. The initial specific gravity was 1052 and 
roughly two months later, it is still fermenting slowly for the 
natural one with a 1010 gravity comparing to 1000 gravity for the 
other. The fermentation temperature is about 18 degre C. If you're 
patient, I will give you my appreciation in a few months.


In both cases, the major thing is the clarification. It has always 
been difficult to obtain a clear product, even after several 
months in the jug. This time, I would try filtration before 
bottling. Or if someone else have any suggestions, you're 
wellcome :-)


I count on your indulgence for the relative english i've used

I sympathise with the "what to put in the airlock" and "how to cope with
blowoff" threads. 
I finally got sick of airlocks and went scouting.
If you look under "Food Processing" equipment in your Yellow Pages, you will
eventually find suppliers to the yoghurt and other small fermenting industries.
A "Two Way Relief Valve"
1/ Is made from polyethylene, seals with a nut and washer.
2/The smallest handles about 15,000 litres an hourand is 3" high.
3/It works on a *one way* ball valve about the size of a ping pong ball.
However "two way" means it can be set for vacuum or pressure, your choice.
4/ It cannot suck back. Your plastic fermenter might suck it's belly in a
bit though, in adverse conditions.
5/ The best part, it costs about  Aust$5.50 !


 If your fermenter sits in a garden-type pot tray, just let it blow off and
wash it into the tray. No cleaning of airlocks or worry about suck back. The
industrial solution!


BTW, please note my new address, I have moved.

I bought one of these several years ago but haven't used it since getting
an oxy-acetylene rig about five years ago.  The regulator pictured in
Zymurgy looks the same to me too.  I can't help with a phone number though.
I was surprised by the amount of wort the ad said one could oxygenate with
one bottle. The orange oxygen tanks are under fairly low pressure so they
don't hold very much and they cost 8 to 10 bucks (Canadian) each.  It
certainly is an expensive way to weld.  I normally just aerate my wort but
a few weeks ago I needed a vigorous starter on short notice so I used the
Bernz-O-Matic regulator to oxygenate.  My big oxy-acetylene tanks are
stored at my parents house or I would use pure O2 more often but I find the
old Bernoulli tube and shake technique works well for me.  One drawback to
buying the regulator as a replacement part instead of from the company
advertising in Zymurgy is that you wouldn't get the air stone.
