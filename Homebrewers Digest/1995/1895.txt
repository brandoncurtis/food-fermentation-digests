My very dear fellow brewers:


I have a rather  inconvenient and extremely messy problem for y'all this 
fine day.  You see, I bottled some of that Toadspit Stout of Charlie's 
and I've just had a major scare.  I put some bottles in the fridge two 
days ago,  (two weeks to the day of bottling).  I drank them and they 
seemed fine.  Now, I'd left some others out for more carbonation time or 
something.  I was hoping the dark grains' bitter burnt flavor would 
mellow out some too. Well, I drank a chilled one earlier and I opened a 
room-temperature one right now.  What was my surprise when the bloody 
thing overflowed!!  There was a dome of bubbles coming from this 
huuuuuuuuuuuuuge kraeuzen in the botttle and the thing began to run down 
the sides. Like an ass, I went and put my mouth to it trying to stop it 
like that and like to drowned because I had to swallow so bloody fast 
since the beer didn't stop flowing.  Well, now my head is a-spinning and 
the room is a-turning 'round and 'round and I'm wishing to hell I'd gone 
to bed without a beer.  Can you tell me what this is a cause of?  None of 
my other batches have acted this way.   Thing acted like it'd been shaken 
up a lot!!  You know, like I'd just drove it around a bumby block wit the 
six pack sitting on the tire.  Is the beer infected?  


I sincerely hope you can come up with an answer for me.  Send it by 
e-mail or hbd.  If sent by e-mail and I don't see a similar suggestion on 
the hbd, I'll post it, of course.  


Alex


ps   I hope you can think after laughing as hard as you are at my 
expense.  *chuckle*

Subject: cherry weiss et cetera...




hi!  just a brief note, thanks to all for advice about the cherry
vanilla weiss beer, it came out great!


let's see if i can remember this...


3.3lbs wheat liquid extract (i used M & F)
3 lbs light dme (i used wheat)
1 oz. 5% cascade hops
3 cans good quality cherry juice concentrate
        (unfortunately couldn't get my hands on cherries fresh or froz)
3 gal. boil volume


american ale yeast (didn't go with the weiss yeast to reduce those
                    normally desired esters of banana and clove -
                    wanted to preserve the cherry/vanilla aroma 
                    the best i could)


OG - 1.054 (could be off a bit)




very rapid fermentation for 4 days, slowed _finally_ and racked to
secondary after 8 days, left it 6 more days in carboy, great clarity!
once in secondary i added 2tbs. pure vanilla extract for flavor and
mostly aroma, and i tbs. cherry essence for aroma (taste was grrrreat,
didn't need any more flavor, wanted better aroma)


at bottling added 8oz malto-dextrin for better head and mouth feel - 
was of course very dry...and priming sugar


after 7 days conditioning - WOW!


great stuff, i was very pleased, great pink color also!


thanks again for the advice!


PS        as far as really toxic substances how about this one:
        1g (that's one gram) of clostridium botulinum toxin
        (yes, that's the happy little guy that causes you to
        get botulism) would kill the entire human race off the
        planet :)


        now _that's_ nasty.  i love my work :)

Subject:       carbonation quality / club web page sponsor


Thanks to all who responded to my question regarding the quality of 
carbonation that is achieved by forced VS natural methods.  All responders
indicated that they believe that there is no real difference, so I guess 
we'll have to let that HBD MOMism die peacefully.


On another note, our brew club is interested in moving it's "unofficial"
web page from my office computer (shhh! don't tell the boss) to an
official web server so that we can more freely advertise it.   The problem
is that this costs money that we can't afford, so we are looking for
sponsors.  The deal is that if we can find two interested sponsors to
split the price, I would write them a full multi-page web page
advertisement each (at your own web address, not intermingled with the
club's and the other sponsor's page), including graphic images, catalogs,
and online order forms (total size up to 100K).  I would also maintain the
pages including monthly updates/changes to information such as prices and
advertised specials.  There would also be a clickable icon (your logo) on
our club's page noting you as a proud sponsor.  Visitors who click your
logo will be sent to your page.  The total cost to the sponsor is about
$70 per YEAR! each (or less than $6 per month) and I do all of the work. 


In the interest of saving band-width, please email me for more info,
including any questions you may have. And visit our club's unofficial
page at http://149.168.19.21/brewmast.htm (but realize that it is *very*
new and not in its final form).

Subject: Re: uncompress (.Z)






In HBD #1894, mmoss`at`PO-Box.McGill.CA asked about how to
handle .Z files from the archives.


This is a common question. If you're using FTP to retrieve the
files, just leave off the ".Z" when you do your "get" command
and it will uncompress automatically.


If you're not able to do that (for example, if you're using a
semi-brain-dead graphic FTP front-end), then you'll have to
uncompress it at your end. There are several ways to do that,
here are a few ideas for different platforms:


Unix: Use the "uncompress" command.


Macintosh: Use Stuffit Expander with Expander Enhancer
     (ftp://ftp.aladdinsys.com/Pub/)


PC running Windows: Use WinZIP
     (ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/cica/win3/util/)


If you've got questions about some of the other common formats
found on the net, look at a discussion of file formats that
we've got on the Brewery web server:

Subject: Cold Plates


I tried to search the archives for this, but short of ftp'ing the whole 
archive and grep'ing it, I couldn't find an easy way :(


I'm looking to set up a kegging system using a cold plate.  I've got Foxx's 
catalog and they have several different models.  I'm looking for advice from 
people who have used them.  The model they recommend for beer dispensing is 
expensive (compared to the others) and bigger than I'd like.  My feeling is, 
it's overkill for my application.  The goal is, a small cheap plate to fit in 
my little "dorm" fridge.  I have no intention of drawing glass after glass, so 
chilling speed isn't too big a factor.  The intent is to have ready access to 
a cool glass of beer without a big fuss.  If it takes 10-15 minutes to chill 
the next glass, it's not a big deal.  Here are the plates Foxx lists:


13A02-211 10"x15" Single Circuit 18' 1/4" stainless tubing designed for 
correct resistence in a beer system (21.6lbs resistence). $69.42


In the wine section:


13A02-201 6"x10" Single Circuit 5' 1/4" stainless tubing $38.18
13A02-202 8"x12" Single Circuit 12' 1/4" stainless tubing $44.51


The 201 is the ideal size, and I figure I can make up for the resistence with 
extra beer line.  In fact, that seems better, since it's tunable.  If the 18' 
of the 211 is too much, I can't shorten it (I guess I'd have to up the 
pressure).  All 3 will fit in the fridge, but the 201 is the most practical 
since I can place it in an unused portion of the fridge (bottle don't fit 
there).  Will 5' be too short for adequate cooling?


Does anyone have any practical experience with these things?

The .Z files are in UNIX "compress" format.  If you actually used the
ftp program, not some Windoze or Mac work-alike, you could have said
"get keg_conversion.faq" where keg_conversion.faq.Z was the file in
the directory.  It would have run the UNIX uncompress program on the
other end and pumped the ASCII results at you.


I am sure there are PC/Mac versions of the UNIX uncompress program
around as shareware/freeware.  If not, there is a fine version in the
MKS Toolkit which is a commercial set of UNIX tools for the PC.

Subject: Old fridge smells


All Hail the Collective,


I have recently had the good fortune to purchase a brewery/primary residence.
As an added bonus (besides the bar in the basement and 2nd gas stove in the
basement) I was left with an old fridge.  When I opened it for the first
time a lovely aroma wafted through the basement.  After a heavy duty scrubbing
with pinesol then bleach (including the drip tray) the smell will not leave.
Baking soda has not helped.  This is not a mild odor, literally your eyes
water.  Anyone have any helpful hints to get rid of the odor?


Thanks in advance.

I really works like this.  Koch had an intent to use trademark on the name
"Sam Houston".  The way it works is that the keeper of the trademark has
claims for six months.  If the keeper doesn't use the trademark, they lose
it.  Koch never used it; he just kept re-trademarking the name.  When
Waterloo Brewing here in Austin decided to use it, Koch threatened to sue.
Apparently, Waterloo won out.  They are still using the name two years
later.  Since Waterloo doesn't serve guest beers, & it's clear in their
advertising that they are -not- serving Sam Adams, there really is little
confusion.  Patrons laugh it off as a Texified pun.  Did you know that Koch
also does the same thing with the name George Washington & Thomas
Jefferson?    Sure, trademark & copyright infringements are crimes, & I
support those laws, but I also think that the holders should keep honest
intentions, & not simply lock others out of other marketing possibilities.

Texas law simply forbids him to do that, plain and simple.  He can't put
the words "Ale" or "Bitter" anywhere on the label at all.  There's another
brewer here in Austin that markets a "Pale Malt".  They don't like calling
it that, but what else can they do, short of an entire reformulation of
recipes?  I don't believe he's even allowed to put on stickers.  Sure, you
can calling it misleading, but he does what he can with it.  It's the same
law that prevents Texas from getting lots of good beers, by the way, simply
because of the word "Ale" or "Stout".  We're working on it, though, so be
patient.  You may get to drink a Celis Pale Ale soon enough.


Also,

Then come on down here to Austin & drink.  You'd be surprised how many
regular old guys are drinking good beer here.  We have several brewpubs &
two breweries running, plus several beer bars that feature many craftbrews,
& all have a good mix of patrons.


Wheeeee!  Ain't this fun?

Subject: fritz vs jim




the latest back and forth over jim koch's brewing/marketing/legal tactics 
has for some reason been more entertaining than the previous ones.  a number 
of folks have been discussing whether koch has done more to introduce 
americans to "better" beer than anyone else; some agree, some nominate 
someone else.  fair enough.  one thing that i think is interesting, though, 
was raised by ken schroeder's recent post.  the gist of his argument (in 
favor of fritz maytag as the person who's done the most to improve things) 
was that fritz has done alot of good guy things,  and that he does it 
honestly and without law suits.  no argument about the first part; this 
isn't intended to knock maytag (or ken) *at all*.  but let's not forget that 
only one brewery can market a "steam" beer, and that's anchor.  why? 
 because fritz maytag has a bunch of lawyers who are every bit as litigious 
as jim koch's, and if anyone tried to market a "steam" beer, fritz would be

Hi folks,


I was catching up on my HBDs after the long weekend and found a few things
to bring me out of a long lurk.


Denis Barsalo (denisb`at`CAM.ORG) said in HBD 1892:
>So I broke down and bought a beautiful Vollrath 38.5

Last I checked, 40.0 liters would be 42.27 US qt. or 33.81 Imp. qt.  On the
other hand, 38.5 liters is equal to 40.68 US qt. (perhaps a nominal 40 qt
container).  No flame intended, I just hope you're not diluting your beer
too much due to a bass-ackwards conversion!

I suggest you check the BTU rating of the Coleman stove (if I was at home,
I'd check it myself).  I have one of the dual-fuel models and love it for
camping, it doesn't throw off anywhere near the heat that my Cajun Cooker
jet burner does.  The Cajun Cooker brings several gallons of mash water up
to strike temperature in about 15 or 20 minutes depending on outside temp.
It takes the Coleman stove almost that long to start perking a pot of coffee
on a cold October morning.  Of course, if I knew then what I know now I
would have bought one of the ring-type propane burners described by Harlan
Bauer in HBD 1894.  The jet burner (pipe with a hole in it) Cajun Cooker
gives a very sooty flame when you try to turn it down.  From what I hear ,
the ring type burners turn way down with a blue flame the whole way.

Caramel for cooking is made with lots of butter and sugar.  The candy type
may have some corn starch or emulsifier to smooth it and give it the right
consistency.  Either way, I don't think you want it in your beer.

I didn't see any other responses to this post but it is important to
realize that this method is not only ineffective but more importantly
EXCEEDINGLY DANGEROUS !!


The purpose of using a pressure cooker as a sterilizer is to attain
complete eradication of sporulating organisms and is dependent on the
fact that water under pressure reaches a temperature above 212F.
without boiling.  Whether it is importantant to achieve a temperature
above 212F in order to sterilize wort for yeast starters is arguable,
but an oil bath surrounding open bottles containing wort will still
achieve a wort temperature of only 212F.


The huge danger with this method lies in the fact that the oil is
undoubtedly hotter than 212F - if any of these wort filled bottles
were to tip over or break the hot wort would hit the hot oil and could
immediately be raised over the boiling point causing a explosion
filling the room with spattered hot oil.  If there were any open
flames the aerosol oil could also explode.  Being covered with boiling
oil and set afire isn't a fun way to brew IMO.


You can acheive the same wort temperature by using a boiling water
bath, tho it may take a few minutes longer to reach temp.

I understand there was a big Irish Moss thread a couple of years ago, and I
heard the merits of one clearing agent over another.  My question is this:
Why use it at all (or polycar, or finings, etc.)?   I have been brewing for
several years now, and I used to always use Irish Moss.  I had the chance to
meet a pro brewer (Ben Pierson, if you're curious), and he recommended that
I try brewing a few batches without it.  Ever since then I have used no
clearing agents at all (truely, just the basic 4 ingredients), and 98% of
the time my beer is beautifully clear!  I also think my beer tastes better,
even the rare hazy ones.  The other members of our brew club also practice
this.  Granted, I use a vigorous boil during the brew, a wort chiller, good
sanitation, and two stage fermentation.  I mean, isn't that the point; good
beer through technique, rather than through additives?


Just an opinion, any others?

        I had read on the HBD that Laaglander dry malt extract was useful if 
you were trying to brew a beer with a high final gravity because it contains 
a lot of unfermentables.  However, after buying some (but before using it), I 
came across a posting on rec.crafts brewing that said that Laaglander should 
*not* be used because it turns out beer with a "sour off-flavor".  The post 
also mentioned that this extract has a small percentage of corn sugar in it.


        Does anyone know if this is true?

I certainly can't claim credit for this idea, but I and at least two other
Cajun Cooker equipped brewers I know have rejetted their cookers
successfully.  The factory orifice is 1/16".  This works OK at high output 
levels with large diameter kettles: smaller kettles result in excessive
flame splashing - localized atmospheric heating - and low output levels
result in incomplete combustion (carbon soot).  But with a simple 
modification, efficiency can be increased and low-end performance can
be improved at the expense of peak output.  


If you buy another brass cap, and drill a *smaller* hole (45-50 mils), you 
will greatly improve your low end performance. You may have to experiment, 
because my first attempt was an orifice about 0.043" diameter and at 
full power (you know, carrier launch with full ordnance), the flame 
tended to blow itself out.  I enlarged the hole to 50 mils and am 
satisfied.  This modification obviously reduced the maximum output, but 
with factory orifice, the unit advertises 200K BTU.  With a 50 mil 
diameter orifice, back of the envelope calculations suggest my power 
output is still in excess of 100K BTU.


In conclusion, I get 50-75% more batches per tank fill and at the lowest
setting used (typically used to maintain boil), I experience no 
sooting (my kettle doesn't either 8<{)

Tim makes a valid point.  There is one problem with it.  There are many
of us out here that will never know about the IBU's in our beer.  We do
not have access to an HPLC or any other lab equipment.  We
cannot accurately measure the mg/L of alpha acids in our beer.
Therefore, we will never know if the equations we are using are correct.


I, personally, have chosen to go with Glenn Tinseth's equations.  Why?
They make the most sense.  Read that as the numbers make the most sense
to me, after the fact.  I have tried Rager's calculations, but the IBUs
come out extremely high.  YMMV.  


Most of us are shooting blind, hoping that the equations that we choose
to use are, indeed, accurate for our own brewing.

Well, you're right -- two decimal places is well beyond the resolution of
my hydrometer -- I would have gotten points off for that in college.  The
general rule is that you should not include more precision in the result
than you have in any one of the factors contributing to that result.  Shame
on me.


>Varying amounts of extract could well have been delivered to each lauter tun
>as the mash was distributed.


That was mentioned in the article.  I admitted that the distribution was done
as evenly as possible: not filling one mash tun at a time, but rather putting
one quart of mash into each tun, then another, then another... I did the
best I possibly could and still I admitted in the summary that the errors
in the measurement are probably greater than the differences between the tuns.
This is not to say that one tun could have done much better if the errors
all happened to have added up against it in the first run of the experiment.
I think that the results are probably accurate to about 5%, but the bottom
line is that 30+ points per pound per gallon could be acheived from any one
of the designs.


My reason for doing the experiment was because of all the posts saying "oh,
you have got to get rid of that Zapap lauter tun -- you'll get 10 points
more per pound per gallon if you switch to a ..."  I was suspicious and
decided to do something about it.

There was a small amount of stirring done on each tun before doing the recirc
just to even out the surface of the grain bed, really.  Yes, the recirculation
was very subjective (yes, it was unscientific too), because my turbidity
analyser was in the shop ;^).  Since all were treated equally, without any
foundation water, the ones with smaller underlet volumes were at an advantage,
however, had you been there and seen the recirculation being done, you would
have seen that some designs simply ran clear almost immediately, some took
a quart or two and others simply would have taken gallons.  There were
disclaimers about that in the article too.


>Time permitting, a number of individual runs on each
>system, with the results averaged, is the right way to make such a comparison


Absolutely.  There was no time.  This was already an all day affair.  I
happen to know that you are working on some experiments (or are about to
start) too.  You should know as well as I that this unpaid experimentation
doesn't get the time it deserves.

Steve came over, helped me get all the equipment together (he is part owner
of the picoBrewing system that we used to make the huge mash) and helped me
run the experiment.  I wrote up the experiment and bounced the draft off of
Steve.  Perhaps I should have explicitly said to Dena, the managing editor,
to put both our names on the article.  Steve certainly did as much work
as I did and his risk of getting heat stroke was just as high as mine (it
was 100+ F that day).  I left for Germany and Belgium after submitting the
article and the next time I saw the article was when I got the assembled
Zymurgy proofs.  I had to review the entire issue's proofs in about two
days and I was more concerned about the accuracy of all the tables, graphs
and illustrations (the proofs are my first chance to see what these look
like) than any of the text including the by-lines.

Are you sure the temp is 65F?  Wyeast American Ale (#1056) is notorious
for shutting down when it gets cold (I have it in my notes at home, but
62F comes to mind).  Is the fermentor on a slab of concrete in the
basement?  If so, then the temperature of the beer can be quite a bit
lower than the room air temp.  I've solved several brewer's bottle
conditioning problems by simply telling them to put something between
the bottles and the cement floor in the basement.  Incidentally, if the
Wyeast #1056 gets too cold, it will eventually start up again when
you warm it, but it won't be quite the same -- I made that mistake once
(temp dropped down to 57F) and even at 70F the beer took two weeks to
finish.  Eventually the FG was a bit high and the beer overcarbonated
after six months in the bottle.  My advice: check your thermometer,
warm up the wort, pitch more yeast and keep the temp well above 63F
at all times this time if that was the problem.  I don't know about
the #1084's temperature sensitivity, but this certainly could not have
been the problem with the Czech Pils yeast.... Hmmmm....

Is boiling water a viable means of sanitizing cornelius kegs?  I have 
been pouring a couple of quarts of boiling water and sloshing in my 
cornys between the last few batches,  and haven't yet had an infection 
problem.  The keg seems to get plenty hot and stay that way for a 
while,  with some significant pressure built up inside from the steam 
(probably not autoclave pressure,  tho).  Of course,  I've had no prior 
infections in these kegs,  just clean beer,  so they're pretty sanitary 
at the outset.


So does the collective deem this a good way to sanitize kegs?  Or 
am I courting disaster?  Could this damage (melt,  deform) soft

Subject: Munich HEAVY


Still another high FG question for the collective:


I recently completed my first all-grain lager,  intended to be a Munich 
Helles-style lager.  The grain bill was:


        8 pounds pale lager malt
        1 pound home toasted (20 mins at 350 F) pale malt.


The original recipe ("Green Mountain Light" from the last Zymurgy Great
Grains Special Issue) called for starch conversion at 152 F. and OG 
1.050,  FG 1.012.  


In my infinite wisdom ,  however,  I decided it would be neat-o to  
conduct starch conversion at 158-159F to give the beer "just a tad 
more body".  The result was OG 1.048 (close enough) and a fairly high 
FG (1.020) using Wyeast 2206.  Apparent attenuation:  58%. I think 2206 
normally runs 72-75% attenuation.


Am I correct in assuming my high mash temp caused the high FG?  The 
resulting beer is actually pretty good,  and not particularly sweet,  
so I assume the yeast did their job.  Nothing like a Munich Helles,  
though ...  Also,  are there any rules/formulas for predicting 
fermentables vs. unfermentables based on mash temp?  Even a rule of 
thumb would be useful.  TIA -- mikey

Help!


Since going to a SABCO 1/2 barrel boiling kettle, I've been struggling with
the best way to separate the boiled wort from the spent hops and break
material.  As a matter of course, I've been using a stainless steel scrubbie
under the built-in pickup tube, leading to a ball valve.  This helps, but
still isn't great.  I've been avoiding pellets, which has also helped, but
just did a doppelbock with only 1/2 oz of Halletauer pellets and 2 oz of Saaz
flowers, figuring that the flowers would adequately filter the pellet goo.
 Wrong - totally plugged.


I've tried siphoning off the top of the cooled wort.  Also marginal - I get
80% of the way done, and plug my siphon (plastic pickup tube with a racking
"tip") if using flowers, or suck up vast quantities of hop goo if using
pellets.


There's got to be a better way - I'd like to be able to use pellets or
flowers interchangeably, and I'd like to be able to finish a long day of
brewing without swearing, worrying and POURING the wort out of the kettle
into the fermenter.  AAAARGH!
