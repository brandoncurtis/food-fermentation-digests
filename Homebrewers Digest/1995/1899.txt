     I was going to try one of these steam injectors, and have even scrounged
the pot, tubing etc.  My concerns lie in the use of pressurized steam, and
the potential safety hazards associated with its application to boost temps
in cooler type mashing systems, plus the need for a stove/burner.


     While expressing the TUL-1 gene found on the y-chromosome this past
weekend (i.e. wandering through the tool aisle at our local home improvement
center)  I came across a variable temp heat gun which blows high velocity
heated air (350 to 1,000+ ^F, adjustable) out its business end.  My first
thoughts were to try to build an "air-manifold" which would NOT have small
holes or slits in it, but would coil several times in the mash and then be
vented out the top of the mash tun (I use a 10 gallon Gott).  Obviously one
would not want to increase AIR flow *through* the tun, but some sort of hot
air flow through copper tubing could possibly be used to boost mash temps
(ever touch a hot exhaust pipe?).  This would essentially be a "reverse wort
chiller" made from several lengths of 5/8" or 3/4" soft copper tubing 
sufficient to allow high volume flow of air through coils (no condensate!)
submerged in the mash and out through open (opposite) ends of the tubes (i.e
low, if any, back pressure to the blower), substituting hot (very hot) air
for cool water.  Benefits of this system might be that the heat source could be
switched on and off easily, and the air temperature could be easily adjusted;
(steam never gets above 100^C unless superheated right?), there is no
explosion hazard, nor is there the need to replenish water to be boiled.
Furthermore it would free the brewer from the use of a stove, propane cooker,
or hotplate.  I like the idea of electric temperature boosts without the use
of resistive elements in contact with wort....


     I realize the heat capacity of air is a fraction of that of water, and
that copper isn't an ideal heat conductor.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK any of you
who are "thermodynamically competent" to tell me if this concept is so far
away from working (practically speaking) given the heat exchange
characteristics of the media involved, or any other considerations I'm missing. 
If I get some even remotely positive feedback, I think I'll experiment with
this, even if I'm just going to wind up building a fancy room warmer!

Sounds like somehow the airspace above the wort cooled and contracted
causing a suction thereby sucking in the stopper.  Reminds me of the old
hard-boiled-egg-in-the-glass-milk-bottle trick.  Reversing the process might
fix the problem.  Try getting the stopper slightly back into the neck of the
carboy then run hot water over the outside of the carboy.  This should cause
the air inside the carboy to heat up, expand and possibly blow the stopper
back out of the carboy.  


Some sort of lubricant put on the stopper may assist in not only allowing
the stopper to slip out, but also to help seal between the stopper and the
neck of the carboy.  You may want to consider some glycerine or cooking oil
smeared around the neck of the carboy as a lubricant. 


This method should not raise the air pressure inside of the carboy to
dangerous levels. 


Good luck.  Let us know how it "comes out".

I recently noticed after removing labels the same way there was a milky
white color to the rinse water.  I think that it was the glue from the
labels.  Some similarly colored goo was adhered to the bottles where the
labels were.


So I gently scrubbed the areas with a brillo pad.  Took the goo right off.


If your problem is sticky white goo where the labels were then it's most
probably glue.  Try scrubbing it off.  If you have some white film all over
the bottles then I don't know what the answer is.

A few years ago I purchased the multi-plate filter advertised in Zymurgy.
>From the outset, I had problems with beer loss from between the plates.(My
first attempt yielded 3.5 gal of clear beer from a 5 gal batch.)I was in 
contact with the manufacturer (in Canada) many times to detect the problem.
He was VERY helpful in trying to find the problem, sending me replacement 
plates, filters etc. at no cost.


I was very happy with the filter performance on the beer that did make it
back into my corny.  A major advantage of these systems is that the filter
pads are inexpensive and offer a wide variety of micron sizes, including 
activated carbon  for brewing water.  Even when using the 1 micron filter,
I did not notice any loss of flavor, although I didn't perform any 
empirical tests.


I almost hesitate to post this because I don't want to denigrate a company 
or its product publicly if I happened to have a "lemon".  Unfortunately I 
was the only brewer in the area to have one so I cannot compare.  I know 
the owner stands by his product and I experienced nothing but help from 
him when repeatedly calling him.  Could someone else out there let me/us 
in on their experiences?

Many wild yeasts are able to ferment relatively complex carbohydrates (eg.
dextrins) which brewers yeasts can't. That's why wild yeast infections can
produce gushers and glass grenades. Spontaneously fermented cider is
generally very dry, just like most other ciders, unless a relatively large
amount of sugar is added or the fermentation gets stuck. Last night I racked
a 5 gallon batch of "Real" Vermont Apple Cider to the secondary. It started
at 1.058 and went down to 1.002 in less than a month. It tastes quite like
brut champagne. It's fruity and tart. Excellent stuff, if you go for that
sort of thing.

This may be due to the pitching rate. You probably pitched a lot more yeast
than the natural fermented batch would have. I expect they both might
eventually end up fairly close to 1 by the time you bottle (or whatever).

Gelatin will do the trick, if you really want a clear product. (This would
technically be chaeating if you're a purist trying to make "Real" cider.)

It's easy to claim a trademark, but enforcement is much more difficult.
Without selling an actual product of that name, one can never enforce a
trademark.

While trademark infringement is illegal, it's a civil rather than criminal
offense. There's a big difference.

Subject: Flow gauges


     My problem:  I'd like to know how much hot water I'm gravity-flowing 
     onto the grain in my mash tun.
     
     My (known) options:  It would be nice to have a digital flow meter, 
     but I don't want to pay that much to just to measure elapsed water 
     passage.  I could calibrate the hot water tank with gallon markings, 
     but who wants to stick his/her head in a tank of 170+F water to watch 
     the level drop?  I could use one of those stainless-steel-framed, 
     glass cylinder window things often seen on industrial coffee pots, 
     drilled and welded onto my hot liquor tank.  But it looks too easy to 
     crack and I don't want to introduce additional leak points.  I could 
     use an open ended stainless steel/copper tube with a floating, 
     graduated dipstick in it (sort of like a hydrometer), but it requires 
     more engineering than I want to devote (since I don't know what to 
     make the floating dipstick out of).  And wouldn't it be fun to have a 
     device that automatically shuts off after you tell it how much water 
     flow you want?  (ex:  Let 6.2 gallons pass through, then shut yourself 
     off.)
     
     My question:  Does anyone have a low-cost, commercial, elegant 
     solution to measuring elapsed flow?  Accuracy to the nearest pint or 
     so would be sufficient.  Thanks!

Subject:      My First Easymasher Experience


Well, I finally got (and installed) and EM in my SS pot.  Since I dont have
a large brewpot yet, I tried it out on a partial mash batch yesterday.


The mash went OK - but there were two problems with the EM and I'm wondering
if they are common problems or just my dumb luck/stupid technique.


First:  The mash stuck twice, initially, and when I had to shut off the flow
once halfway through.  I was able to restart it by "underletting" (i.e 15ml
of water shot into the spigot with a syringe), but it did cause a bit of a
mess.  My mash was 5# of pale ale malt and 1/2# crystal - neither crushed
too fine. What was the problem? Stirring didnt help unstick it.


Second:  I put a hose on the spigot to collect the wort, and at any flow
less than max, the seam in the spigot made the seal leak - causing a flow
of tiny bubbles to enter the flow hose.  Needless to say - this was causing
oxidation from hell.  The only way to stop it was to apply pressure to the
plastic hose near the seam.  Since the damn little brass spigot gets hot, and
I really didnt feel like putting my finger on it for an hour, I just let the
sparge go at full speed for most of the time - giving me a poor yield.


On the other hand, the aeration worked great for transferring to the
fermenter!


Well, hopefully I'll figure out how to solve these little problems, and
do a full grain mash soon.

Subject:  Strike/Sparge water, Steam Injection... 


Hullo.


I'm a new subscriber to this list - I've been doing all-grain with a
BruHeat for a couple years now, and am starting to think out the details
of a 10 gallon brewery for my basement (its -20 degrees Celcius right now;
I really don't want to brew outside in the winter!)


I'm inclined to favour steam injection for raising mash temperatures,
and I've had some thoughts on how the same heat source could be used for
heating strike & sparge water.  BTW, I favour a tower (gravity) brewery
rather than using pumps to move hot liquids around.


My thought is this:  why not use large coolers for both the hot water tank
and the mash tun.  Form a conical coil of soft copper attached to my cold
water tap, and position a low power burner under it.  By controlling the
flame and water flow I should have good control over the temperature.  I
could fill the hot water "cooler" for strike water while grinding my 
grains, and could slowly fill it with sparge water while mashing.


When it comes time to raise mash temperatures, divert the flow from the
copper coil into the copper manifold in the bottom of the mash tun, and
crank up the flame / reduce the water flow until it is producing steam.
>From what I understand it takes very low steam pressure to heat the
mash this way.  I don't see any real safety issues (yes, I know steam
is dangerous, but I can't see how the line could get plugged in such
a way as to create dangerous pressures).

Prior to brewing this type of beer for the first time, I had the same 
questions.  After reading almost everything relating to this yeast, 
and calling Wyeast for additional info, I found that the smell and taste
 is hit or miss (see HBD 10/20/92 post by A. Korzonis (?)). 
My own experience is that even fermenting at 57 F, there is still *some*
banana, but I like this when it's subtle.
Wyeast suggests a fermentation temp. of 58F to 68F, but you might
do best to keep it under 60F for your next batch if you find the smell
and taste objectionable.

Personally, I make different infusions of a calculated amount of 203F
water at each step of the mashing process.  So far, so good.  My mash
wasn't too soupy, since I base the calculation on .8 gallons of water
per pound of grain as opposed to 1 gallon.

How well did you mix in the priming solution?  Without thorough mixing,
it is possible to get stratification and uneven carbonation.

Cooler types of mash tuns are best for single infusion mashes.  You can
do some stepping, but you will probably go through trial and error to
get the volumes and temperatures correct.  I believe others have said
that they've developed spreadsheets that calculate this information.
(It should be a straightforward calculation if you know the temperatures,
volumes, and heat capacities.)


A very efficient and relatively accurate way of doing a step mash in a
cooler mash tun is to use steam injection.  With steam, you can never
heat above 212^F and steam holds a lot of energy in the form of latent
heat of vaporization so you don't add much water.

The more concentrated the boil, the greater the opportunity for
caramelization.  It may give the beer a more caramel flavor.
Full volume boils reduce the likelihood of carmelization.

The burner isn't that hard to remove.  I just did it back in September.
Grab a couple of crescent wrenches, pliers, screwdriver, and hammer and
just take the burner out without dragging the heater home.

        This is in responce to the postings about this subject in the 
last few days. I have a rule of thumb about this subject. If your beer is 
not contaminated in the first place then don't worry about it. Once my 
kegs are empty I simply leave them in the frig(usually 2-3 weeks). When 
the next batch is done I take the empty out of the frig, release the 
pressure, rinse with cool water in my bathtub just to get the small 
amount of yeast off the bottom(less than a minute), and fill it up with a 
fresh batch. The only contamination(noticable) that I have ever had in 
the three and a half years of brewing was my first batch where I was 
anal as hell! 


I have also recently moved to eastern Washington from the Heart of the 
Redwoods. Home of Mad River Brewing Company who produce Steelhead Extra 
Stout, Stealhaed Extra Pale Ale, and Jamaca Red. Question: Has anybody 
out there ever formulated a recipe which has come close to the extra 
pale or the Jamaca red. Private Email would be great!

For the person with the stopper that got sucked in the carboy..


Learned a trick that might work on pulling out a cork that had been shoved 
down a wine bottle.


Stick a disk towel or something like it into the carboy (hold on to the 
end though). Lay carboy on its side and try to roll the stopper into the 
folds of the dish towel. Once that happens, pull out dish towel slowly 
and as the stopper gets to the neck of the bottle, start pulling in 
earnest. The stopper is firmly held by the towel so as you pull harder 
you should see the stopper come out. It works great with corks in wine 
bottles so it should work here

Subject: Lactic acid to drop pH


roberts`at`Rt66.com(Bird) asks about using lactic acid to drop his pH of 8.5.
I use lactic acid all the time to drop the pH of my sparge water,but not in
the mash. Here in Atlanta (home of the 1995 Wolrd Champion Atlanta Braves!)
we have unusual water, in that it is very soft (hardness = 33ppm) but also
has a very high pH (up to 8.0). 
The problem with using acids to drop the pH is that it is very easy to add
too much, resulting in a sour aftertaste. I use an electronic pH meter, then
dilute about 1\4 to 1\2 tsp lactic acid in 1 liter of water, then slowly
pour in the mixture,stir,take a reading,add,stir,etc. until my pH is about
5.7. Believe it or not it only takes about 1\4 tsp lactic acid to drop the
pH of 6 gallons of water down to 5.7 in my case.
I've never had much success with pH strips, but there are probably some out
there that are sensitive enough to work instead of buying a 40$ electronic
meter.
I would follow Rob Reeds advice and pre-boil all the water,then rack off the
chalk precipitates. If that doesn't help, try experimenting with lactic
acid, just be careful. Like I said, I use it all the time without any
problems and I brew a lot of Pilsners, with no detectable sourness. You can
purchase some via mail order from:

Subject:       Vanilla Ale, Fruit, Yeast


A few months ago I got advice from several of you about
using vanilla in an ale.  It was ready for tasting this week and
turned out yummy! My best yet - good head, smooth taste, just
a hint of vanilla.  Typical ale recipe, with 3 vanilla beans torn
apart and added to secondary for about 3 weeks.


Right now I've got a cherry weissbier in the primary with several
pounds of whole/smashed cherries.  Has anyone used fruit in the 
primary,  and then strained/rinsed it (to leave trub behind)  and used 
also in the secondary?  I think that conditioning in the secondary with 
the cherries would be good, and I sure hate to see them trashed upon 
racking.  Or perhaps I shouldn't go to a secondary with this one, as 
I've heard that secondary isn't desired for a wheat beer. Any advice?


The initial activity of the cherry weissbier was unbelievable - the lid
of the primary blew off!  I just used a regular ale yeast starter, so I 
wonder if wheat is notorious for vigorous fermentation. I just hope
I can get my primary bucket to seal again when this is over.  I had
to tape the lid down all around to achieve a seal, which was never a
problem before, and switched to a blow-by tube for 12 hours until 
foam activity ceased.  Now the air-lock is in place and all is well.
Side note - pleasant banana esters waft from the weissbier, though 
I thought this would only come from certain Bavarian yeast. 
Again, I suspect the wheat may be responsible.

I agree, the high carbonate content of the water acts as an alkalinity
buffer, it will likely require a lot of acid to overcome the buffering and
drop the pH. 


>Have you considered preboiling your water to remove excess carbonates?


>I have similarly hard water and use this process
>to decarbonate my  pale ale brewing water. 


I also have water that's high in carbonates, and pre-boil all my mash and
sparge water. I don't add gypsum or calcium chloride first as Rob does, and
I've found that pre-boiling alone does not lower pH significantly. The pH of
my water is about 8.0 both before and after boiling. However, the precipitation
of carbonate as bicarbonate that Rob described does remove the alkalinity
buffer, making it possible to acidify the water with a very small amount of 
acid.


For the mash, I don't add anything at all, the natural acidification that
occurs at mash-in drops the pH from 8.0 right down to 5.2 - 5.4, no further
treatment required.


For sparging, I add just 1/4 teaspoon of acidblend per 10 gallons of sparge
water, which drops the pH to about 5.7 - 5.8. This ensures the pH in the
lauter tun stays under 6.0 for the duration of the sparge, avoiding the 
extraction of tannins.


To the original poster (Doug Roberts?), try pre-boiling as Rob described. If
the pH is still too high, add a very small amount of acid, that should do it.

I've read that if the water is not decanted off the precipitate, the
bicarbonate will be re-dissolved. I don't know the timeframe, if it's several
hours, overnight, or what, but I basically do what Rob does. I pre-boil in
my hot liquor tank, wait 30 minutes to allow the bicarb to precipitate, then
open a valve and run the water into the mash tun.

If you're going to dilute post fermentation, be careful not to splash your
dilution water when adding it to secondary. I'd treat it like beer, rack the
water quietly. If the water picks up oxygen, and you add it to fermented beer,
you will likely oxidize the alcohol that's already been produced.


Personally, I second Jim Busch's advice to dilute pre-fermentation, then this
won't be a concern. The tradeoff is that the higher gravity ferment will
produce more esters, but I don't feel this is a good thing for milds. The
trick to this style is getting a lot of body from a beer with a very low OG.
Esters, with the exception of isoamyl acetate (banana), generally have a sharp
flavor, which is exactly what you don't want in a mild. Too many sharp flavors
(e.g., hop bitterness, esters, roasted malt) will contribute to the impression
of a thin-bodied beer. Dilute pre-ferment, go easy on the hops, use some high
Lovibond crystal, use just a little (2%-3% of the grain bill) chocolate malt
as the dark malt (no roasted barley or black patent), and use a yeast that
leaves a lot of diacetyl, such as Tadcaster or Wyeast 1084.


Brewing concentrated worts and diluting to make milds is a great way to get
more beer out of a brewday, I typically brew 10 gallons and dilute to 15. At
2.5 - 3.0% ABV, these are *great* session beers.

I titrated a gallon of my water to determine the necessary amount of 
lactic acid to bring the mash water ph down to 5.2. It turns out that
5.3 ml of 88% aqueous lactic acid is required per gallon: not an 
excessive amount. I brewed a Scotch ale with this water, and it was

Subject: Propane, once again!!!!


I am becoming increasingly tired of the propane threads as they have been 
popping up more and more recently.  Everyine seems to be of the 
misconception that ABSOLUTELY NO WAY should you use propane indoors.  
This is absolutely FALSE.  Just because you buy this flammable gas in a 
little white bottle doesn't make it any different a fuel than the stuff 
that comes into your house in a pipe.  While the specific formulations 
differ and the inherent thermal value (BTU/cubic foot) is different 
(propane has more BTUs, therefore it will burn hotter and use less gas 
hence the smaller orifice) They are both used extensively for cooking 
fuels and other domestic uses.  In many rural parts of the country (and 
some less rural as well) propane is the gas of choice for kitchen use.  
Just drive by an old farm house and look for the distinctive BIG silver 
bottles outside the back door.  In another life, I worked as a chef in 
many large commercial kitchens that were fueled with propane.  In some 
ways I prefered them to NG since you could turn the flame up to rock and 
roll and not get as much scorching.  The burn characteristics of propane 
are such that the flame spreads out more than NG so you are less likely 
to get hot spots.


While I agree that there is possibly unneseccary risk in bringing a 20# 
propane tank into the house, the gas itself is no more expolsive or 
dangerous than NG in a normal use environment.  Of course if you want to 
get foolhardy, thats on you.


Now that I have gotten that off my chest, I will tell you that my brewery 
is set up outside and I do use a Cajun cooker for my heat source.  I so 
this more for the convenience of clean up than anything else.  If I had a 
set up that would allow me to brew in my basement ( ready supply of 
water, tile floor with floor drains etc) I would not have a problem with 
using my current set up there. I would just make sure I had a commercial 
vent hood to guarantee enough air flow to the outside and a CO detector 
to make sure I don't pass out too quickly and I'm in...


Thanks for your patience in allowing me to get this off my chest.

I did a side-by-side comparison with an ale a couple years back, and I thought
the cooler-conditioned one was a bit better, but then I didn't take the time
to let them cold-condition for a couple days after carbonation, which I've
found makes a lot of difference, and that might have changed things.


However, I will say that brewing with Wyeast's (and probably other folks')
Weihenstephan Wheat yeast, conditioning temps definately make a difference.
(Again, it's warm for banana, cold for clove.)  
- ---
On a similar topic, am I the only one that thinks that the phenolic flavors
in high-phenol wheat beers tastes almost nothing like cloves do?  I mean, I
see the comparison, and I can't think of a better name, but it's nowhere near
as similar to cloves as isoamyl ester is to banana.  Maybe I'm extra-sensitive
to another flavor in cloves, or less sensitive to any number of things.

Obviously, it's nearing time for more side-by-side comparisons.  However,
I suspect that your effects may be due to other changes in procedures.


I began DME priming at the same time as I switched from extract (+steep)
to all grain, and the same time I switched to using liquid yeasts and real
starters.  My beers got better.  Eventually, on Al K's advice, I switched 
back to using corn sugar to prime, and I haven't detected any difference.
(Again, I haven't done side-by-side comparisons...)


So, anyone have any other experience with this?  I will attempt to split the
next batch I bottle and do some serious tasting for differences.

This got me thinking about something I've been meaning to ask you all:


In Dave Miller's new book, _Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide_, he states 
something to the effect that, when priming with corn sugar, the corn 
sugar in the bottle get fermented very quickly - something like 24 - 48 
hours. All the (newly produced) CO2 is in the head space at this point. 
It's the disolving of the CO2 _back into the beer_ that takes 2-3 weeks. 


Now, with the assumption that CO2 will disolve into _cold_ beer faster 
than warm beer (not sure if this is true?) - would it be possible to get 
to your desired carbonation level faster by bottling, let the bottles sit 
at room temperature for a day or two, then dropping the temp to say, 
35-38F (frig/fidge temp) ?
