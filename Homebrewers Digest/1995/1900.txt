Subject: Propane vs Natural Gas / Mashing in Oven - OK?






The propane/NG thread seems to still be going strong, so I
thought I'd jump into the fray.  I used to live in a house with
a propane-fired stove.  The previous resident also had a
propane-fired clothes dryer.  The tanks were outside, and the
gas company came by once a month or so to top off the tanks,
and read the meter.  (I only bought the gas I used, the gas
company owned the gas that was in the tanks.)  It worked pretty
much the same as with users of natural gas.  We had no
problems cooking with propane.  I don't believe the use of
propane indoors is a problem, as long as it is used properly.
As others have noted, many of the stoves built for outdoor use
produce CO.  Clearly, the indoor models shouldn't do that.  One
key point with my previous setup was that the gas was kept
outside, so any leaks in the tank (there were none) would not
result in indoor build ups.  Clearly, any gas system, propane
or NG, should not leak.  Any unit must be used as it was
intended.  Anyone who uses an outdoor burner indoors, even if
near a window or other vent is crazy.  But, I also believe, with
the proper equipment, propane can be used indoors.

Reagrding mashing in an oven - can it be done?


I am planning to move from extract/specialty grain to partial
mashes.  For a variety of reasons, I am not planning to go all
grain, but do want to use a few pounds of regular malt in my
brewing.  I am thinking about putting crushed grain in a pot 
with warm water, and putting it in the oven at 155 deg or so.
After about an hour, I would strain with hot water, like I
currently do with specialty grain.  Will this work?
I am also considering buying a mini lauter tun, and
putting it in the oven.  Is this idea any good? 


Thanks for any input on these ideas.

This has nothing to do with lautering, but it is interesting.
Not only is the situation Dave describes true, it even makes sense if
you think about it.  It's much easier for smaller spheres to slip down
through the empty spaces between larger spheres than for the opposite
to occur.  While the container is being shaken, the smaller spheres
continue to fall downward through the larger spheres until the empty
spaces become too small to slip through.  The net effect of this sorting
is to shift of the center of mass (or center of gravity, if you prefer)
of the spheres to a lower point, reducing the total gravitational energy
of the spheres.

Subject:       brew club drinking & driving


Way-back-when I posted to the digest relating some concerns of my fellow
brewclub members.  The concern arose when I suggested to my club that we
post information concerning the whens and wheres of our meetings and brew
sessions on our web page.  Some of the members felt that the local police
could find out about these meetings from the internet and stake them out
to harrass members as they leave.  I was curious if some of you out there
would have similar concerns, or if you felt the members were
overreacting.  I only received two responses, both of a similar nature,
which seemed to indicate that I did not make myself clear in my original
post.  Following is comments made by one of my responders along with my
responses to "HIM>".  I hope this clears things up.

I've used an NG converted Cajun Cooker indoors for most of a year.  I
have a CO detector (color change sort) in the vicinity which has never
shown any indication of CO.


It clearly burns a lot cleaner w/ NG than with Propane in terms of
sooty deposits, and probably cleaner combustion gases too (fewer
hydrocarbons, more CO2 & water).  The NG is 'somewhat' safer than the
propane version because of the cleaner combustion, the smaller
flame and lower BTU rating.  You can still kill yourself and blow up your
home w/ natural gas almost as well as with propane.


There is still a very real danger in using ANY high BTU burner
indoors, since all combustion uses oxygen.  It's quite possible to
imagine someone suffering from lack of oxygen by using one of these in
a closed space w/ poor ventilation.  Also there is the obvious danger
of having a large open flame in an enclosed indoor space.


IMO an NG converted Cajun is 'relatively' safe to use indoors, but I
would NEVER run it unattended or w/o lots of ventilation. Contact you
home fire loss insurer or local fire department for an alternate point
of view.

One issue that never seems to come up in discussions of indoor
brewing is that all water lost during the boil recondenses in the
interior of your home.  If I brew in the cold months in my basement,
this effectively means that something around 1 gallon of water
condenses and drops from my cold water pipes which run around 40F
during the winter. Tho' I personally like the rain forest effect, my
SO doesn't and I am banished to the unheated garage precisely at the
time of year when outdoor brewing is least appealing. 


If someone has a plan for an effective exhaust vent system this
problem as well as the combustion gas problem would both be reduced.

Ken, I don't remember reading about any litigation for the Steam name,
but I do remember reading about Fritz threatening to suit someone in
New Jersey for using the name Liberty Brewing for a brewpub. Apparently
the name is too close to Liberty Ale.

The hops I received from SA were both fresh and of excellent quality.
This was also the experience of several friends.

Just my 2 cents worth.

Subject: DMS in Lagers


     
     Rob Reed asserts that the cause of DMS in Lagers is caused 
     somehow by the malt.  
     
     I am not sure the roll malt plays, but I have read 
     somewhere (I'm sorry I can't remember the source; think it 
     may be G. Fixx) that a contributing factor to DMS is high 
     starting temperatures.  I can confirm that I have 
     experienced very high DMS in lagers when I pitched the 
     yeast while it was still cooling down.  I thought it would 
     get it off to a quick start if I pitched it at 85-90 and 
     proceeded to cool it down.  The result was a drinkable beer 
     when it was young, but very high DMS after it aged.

Thanksgiving, and was surrounded by Full Sail.  My slip.  Thanks to all 
that replied and let me know what's what.  
If anyone has any knowledge of the new brewery in Berkeley, I am still

Greetings All,


Back in September I posted to the HBD about a problem with the 
Thread21 file search program.  I also reported the location of a 
program (lfcrlf11.zip) that would fix the files that were downloaded 
from unix based systems and allow Thread21 to read those
files.  I have recently been informed that those locations can no 
longer be accessed.


Stephen Hansen loaded the file into the archives for me:


>I've placed the file lfcrlf11.zip in the thread program directory:

Thanks Steve.


The program is a DOS based, pkzipped program.  When unzipped there is 
a read.me file that explains how to use the files.  If you have any 
questions drop me an e-mail.  Good luck and hoppy brewing!

If the smell had been embedded in the plastic lining of the fridge, I have
another solution to add to the list.  Take the fridge outside, remove the
door and point it at the sun for a few days.  Sunlight will not only wipe
out the smell, but also will bleach out the stains from mould.  This worked
for me on a picnic cooler, so I can't see why it won't work on a fridge.  It's
just a little harder to carry outside.  Remove the door off the hinges so you
don't trap any little kids.

I have to disagree with Doug on this.  Glucose is a part of all worts.
Glucose and fructose together are typically 8.9% of the wort and sucrose
is another 5.5% (MBS, p.268).  I mention sucrose because yeast can't eat
sucrose diretly, so they release invertase which breaks the sucrose into
its component glucose and fructose molecules.  When you consider the
typical homebrewer's wort is, let's say 1.050 and that 1/2 cup of corn
sugar is about 2.5 ounces, that 1/2 cup of corn sugar adds about 0.0015
to the gravity of the beer. That's 3%.  This is such a small increase in
glucose content that I can't believe that anything except a HPLC can
tell the difference.  Furthermore, excessive refined sugars have been blamed
for *cidery* flavors, not winey.  Winey tastes have been attributed to
higher alcohols (Terry Foster, Zymurgy Troubleshooting SI, 1987), but
Philippe Perpette (studying for his phD in brewing in Belgium, I believe)
at his Spirit of Belium talk last year said that glucose actually *reduced*
the production of higher alcohols!  [Gosh, I just scared myself.]

A bad day, actually.  I wanted to discuss this with John before posting
a reply and, in fact, that's what I should have done before I made the
initial, rather underhanded, post.  My recollection of the email exchange
was that John said he would add a reference to my post in his article.  I
finally got caught up on my reading BT and came across John's article.  When
I didn't see any reference to my post, I was a little hurt.  That, combined
with a bad day and not enought sleep resulted in my adding the stab at John
at the end of my post.  In private email, John and I just discussed what
happened and all is well.  So I'd like to take this opportunity to publicly
appologize to John and to the HBD community for wasting all this bandwidth.

While a soil scientist may not be the right person to talk to regarding

person to talk to regarding the channelling that may occur during runoff.
I talked to my dad (a civil engineer) about this before my, now infamous,
post from October 1992 and he's the one who told me about channelling.
I mentioned channelling again in some more recent posts in which I said
that stirring the mash only increases channelling.  Think about it: if
you stick a knife or spoon into a mash and cut a "gorge" into it, the
sparge water above the mash will pour into this "gorge" you created.
Once the flow begins down this path (a sort of mini 3-D river in the
grain bed), this is now the path of least resistance and the sparge
water will tend to take this path down to the outlet -- whatever it's
design or configuration.


I think there are two issues here: 1) the layout of grain in the mash
tun and 2) the course that runnings take as they travel from the top
to the outlet of the lauter tun.


Incidentally, I'm pretty sure that the sorting of the grain particles
is not as compleat as Greg Noonan has pictured.  I know I posted about
this some time in 1995, but I can't think of what to search for.  Any
way, the point is that initially, there may be *some* stratification but,
as Dave said in his post, the particles will, for the most part, be
poorly sorted.  As we take runnings, the smallest particles near the
outlet will get washed out (that's the cloudy runnings).  Larger pieces
will get trapped by the screen, perforated bottom, whatever.  Smaller
particles *higher up* in the grain bed will be trapped by the larger
pieces that are now forming the beginnings of the filter bed.  If we
indeed had to wait until all the large pieces were at the bottom, followed
by medium-sized pieces, followed by the small pieces, then we would be
recirculating for hours.  Perhaps more ascii art.  In the following
drawings, the two tuns represent the same tun at the beginning of the
runoff and a short while after that.  The a, b, c and d represent small
particles of husk, acrospire and other small pieces of insoluble stuff:

I think that there may be a few legal squabbles if Hart Brewing starts
brewing Full Sail because Full Sail Ales are not brewed by Hart Brewing in
the first place.  Hart Brewing brews Pyramid and Thomas Kemper beers out of
Kalama (WA), Seattle (WA), and Polusbo (WA).  Full Sail Ales are brewed in
Hood River (OR) and Portland (OR) and from what I know, there is no
connection between the two breweries.

Subject: Dilution responses, Special-B in Scotch Ale?, Multiple Starters, Cal. Lager Yeast?


Thanks for all the responses about high gravity fermentation with a dilution
in the secondary!  Out of 10 replies I recieved, about half said that they had 
done so in the past with no problem and half said "no way dude".  The negative 
responders brought up the point that higher primary fermentation would produce 
more esters and fusil alcohols.  Because the final product will be a Mild Ale, 
I don't belive these effects will be large enough for concern.  The SG for 
primary will only be around 1.064 or so which is the same gravity I get for my 
strong brown ale.  Actually a few extra esters in a mild would be welcome.  
The problems would probably be magnified at higher SGs though.  Any more 
thoughts on the subject?  (Looks like I'll be trying it after Christmas.)
==============================================================================


I recently made a Scotch Ale using a little Special-B (2oz.) and some peated 
malt (4oz.).  Not enough smoky flavor and a weird rasiny taste.  I've gotten 
the raisin flavor from Special-B before but only when I used half a pound in a 
light ale.  The peated malt seems to have magnified it quite a bit.  This was 
the first time I've used peated malt so I think I used way to little.


Has anyone else had similar results mixing the two?
==============================================================================


A yeast "trick" that a friend and I use to stretch the scarce dollar is to 
make multiple starters from one pack of liquid yeast and trade them.  We make 
up a few pints of wort, split it among 3 or 4 starter jugs, inoculate one, 
then mix between all of them.  This makes several small starters that we step 
up and use.  I've not had any problems keeping starters that go dormant for up 
to a month.  About a week before using one, I add fresh wort and get it going 
well before brew day.  (I also repitch into the secondary to get more batches 
per packet.)


So far everything works well.  (Well, I told you I was frugal!!! :-)
==============================================================================


Can anyone tell me how well the Wyeast Cal. Lager yeast at lower temps?  I 
know it does well up to the mid 60's but don't know how low it will go.  Does 
it have good lager characteristics in the low 50's?
=============================================================================

"quality" means "I like the taste".  Since tastes vary between

Subject: Brew Schools


Greetings fellow brewers-


After months of consideration, I've decided to go back to school.  I am
seeking advice on Brewery Schools.  I've read the reviews of the various
brew-schools that have been featured in _Brewing Techniques_.  Because I
live fairly close to Davis, Ca., the American Brewer's Guild is the most
likely choice.  From what I could glean from the article; they train you for
4 weeks in classes, then apprentice you out to a brewery for 5 more weeks.
A final week of classes follows the apprenticeship period.




Questions:


Has anyone gone to this establishment?
What are the employment possibilities and expected salary ranges?
Would having a degree/certificate/training be required or is it possible to
apprentice with a brewery, then maybe go to school?
Are there any other Brewery Schools in the greater SF Bay area?




I desire to work in a brewery, but not as just full-time menial labor.
Don't get me wrong... I rather enjoy hard work...it makes the beer taste
better.  But I can do more.  I also realize that this a brewing forum and
not a career-guidance group.  There are plenty of smart and experienced
brewers out there who are doing this professionally.  I guess I wanna know
how they *did it*.


Any replies would be greatly appreciated.  Private e-mail preferred  as I
don't wish to waste bandwidth with something like this.  Again, thank you.

Subject: Stuck Corks/Laag/TempCtl


Another method of removing a stuck stopper is to use a cloth napkin. 
This is an old trick for removing corks from empty wine bottles.  The
method is to fold the napkin into a tube around the corner (corner is in
the center) and insert it into the carboy.  By shaking the carboy,
position the cork on the napkin such that it's surrounded by the napkin,
and slowly pull it out.  May be easier to get it out small side first. 
Never done this with a carboy, but it works great for wine bottle
salvage.


On Laaglander dry malt: Been using it for about seven years with great
results.  Never had any noticable problems with off-flavors due to the
malt.  As far as a high terminal gravity, never noticied any difference
between Laadlander DLME and, say, Briess Brewers Gold Dry or
Munton & Fison Dried Light when these were substituted for Laaglander
in the same multi-malt recipes.


Don't know about any added dextrose, but if there is any in there it
hasn't been possible to taste it, even in 100% Laaglander extract
lagers.


On Temperature Controls: Three basic choices: Williams Brewing
mechanical control, the Hunter AirStat, and the Brewers Resource digital
control, which also can control a heater.  All will work, but the
Williams will require an additional thermometer (max/min recording is
best), the Hunter only goes down to 40 degrees without modifying the
probe, and the Brewers Resource unit, which is functionally the best, is
also the most expensive.


Williams Unit: $59 from Williams Brewing, 2594 Nicholson St, San
Leandro, CA 94577, 1-800-759-6025


Hunter AirStat: $35 or so from a number of mail-order sources - check
the ads in your favorite homebrew mag.  If they advertise a "digital
override control" or something similar in this price range you can bet
it's this unit.  Note that this unit isn't made anymore; these units are
being sold until the supply runs out.


Brewers Resource FermTemp: $89.90 from Brewers Resource, 409 Calle San
Pablo #104, Camarillo, CA 93012, 1-800-827-3983


If you use a freezer or an old single-door fridge from the 1950s, note
that these can freeze a carboy solid if the override control fails (made
a great, but unintentional, "icebock" this way once).  A good idea is to
use the internal control as a failsafe - do a test with the internal
control set to it's lowest position and measure how cold it gets.  If it
gets below 35 degrees and no colder than 28 it won't freeze up your
carboy if the override control fails, but it'll still work OK to lager. 
Set to a setting that gives this temp range before connecting up
your override control.

Hot tap water and boiling water works; in the right proportions. I use a 5
gal Gott and usually use 10 lbs of grains for a 5 gal batch. I'm still
zeroing in on a procedure but for my last batch (a porter), I used 10 lbs
grains, added 1.5 gal hot tap water (127 deg F) yielding 112 deg F mash
followed by 2.5 gal <212 deg F water yielding 159 deg F! Too hot so I
stirred frequently to get the temp down.
My previous two wheat beer batches, I ended up too low on temp and just drew
off a gallon or so of liquid, heated and re-added to the mash. It's just a
matter of figuring out the right proportions of mass and heat. Point is, you
can get there. Just takes a little experimenting. There have been several
posts recently on controling/changing your mash heat. Search them out. -

Subject: Burner data 


  Howdy,
  
  With all of the talk about converting burners from propane to natural 
  gas, I thought I'd pass along info I learned in my quest for the perfect 
  burner.  
  
  My goal was to have a dual fuel burner to use natural gas for brewing in 
  my garage and propane for brewing and cooking elsewhere.  The guy at the 
  propane distributor (great supply of burners, heaters and grill parts) 
  explained the difference between jet burners and ring burners as:  
  
  Jet burners use high pressure fuel and have usually one burner jet.  They 
  produce very high BTUs and are designed to be run full blast.  They are 
  not very efficient and produce a higher level of combustion byproducts, 
  even more so when you try to throttle them down.  Because the fuel needs 
  to be "high pressure" (relative term of course) they can't be converted 
  to natural gas which is regulated at the house gas meter.
  
  Ring burners use low pressure fuel and have a number of jets in the 
  burner.  The low pressure design allows the flame to be easily adjusted 
  without losing much efficiency but they don't put out the high BTUs.  The 
  level of combustion byproducts is lower due to the better efficiency.  
  The low pressure design allows it to be converted to natural gas by 
  drilling a propane orifice to .035" (the regulated propane pressure is 
  about the same as the household natural gas pressure).
  
  I purchased the Superb 35K BTU burner, which comes set up for propane and 
  a second supply hose and control valve, with .035" orifice, to connect to 
  the natural gas line in my garage.  He said I could increase the diameter 
  of the orifice a bit more if it wasn't hot enough.  I got enough hose to 
  boil outside in the summer and inside in the winter (windows open of 
  course).  I'm waiting until I get my boiling keg to try it out, so I do 
  not yet know how it works.
  
  Hope this helps.
