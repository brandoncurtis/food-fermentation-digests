And Ken Schwartz replied

2)  Would the temperature gradient from "inlet" to "exhaust" cause problems
with "hot spots"?  Continuous stirring might be necessary.


3)  Perhaps you could *partially* fill the coil with water, and "bubble" the
hot air through it.  Depends on the force of the air from the gun.


Basically, what wattage(power) is this air gun? To heat a 40 litre (10 gal)
mash the basic 0.5C (~1F) per minute you will need at least (4.19 * 40 * 0.5
* 60) 1400 watts with no losses in exhausted hot air. You will probably need
>3000W. If it is a paint stripper gun it is probably about 2000 watts.


The copper tube is practically irrelevant to calculating heat flow. The real
barriers are the air/metal and metal/wort interfaces and any laminar flow
boundary layers. The overal heat transfer coefficient (air/matal/water)from
hot exhaust gases to water is about 140W/m2K, watts per square metre per
degree Kelvin temperature differential for *turbulent flow*. (Kelvin =
absolute entigrade)
The area of you tubing depends on the temperature differentials. Lets take a
look at the worst case scenario. Air at 176C (350F)in and 90C(195F)exit and
mash at 70C (160F). The log mean temperature difference is thus 51K. That
means  140 * 51K = 7.14 kilowatts/m2. That is 0.2 square metres of copper in
a perfect system. Unfortunately you will have to vigoursly stir your mash to
maintain turbulent flow in the mash. Your turbulent flow (no insulating
boundary layer) problems suggest you should overbuild to about 0.5 square
metres. In 25mm tube (1 inch) this is about 6.25 metres (20 feet)
I suggest 25mm because air is essentially incompressible at the velocities
of fans. This means it has to go faster in the tube than out of the gun, in
proportion to their cross sectional areas. The increase in friction
resistance and the energy needed to accelerate it are loads your air gun may
not handle. At reduced air velocities through the gun it will overheat and
burn out. This is why I suggest the lowest heat setting. Remember it was
designed for use in an open room.
The gun being able to push the air through the tube is your biggest problem.
Also air is capable of maintaining laminar boundary layers at high
velocities and without convection at the tube wall, the conduction
properties of air are about 1/23th those of water, which is about 1/280th
that of copper. Some method of roughening the inside of the tube would help.
Don't put water in it, too much air flow resistance.


Why use the air at all? If you want a hot coil in your mash, your local
heating element maker could wip up a SS low density element for about
US$120, which he could shape into a coil.


Making beer sometimes is so complex, it is a wonder it was made at all!

A question for the collective.


I received a bottle of Dunkles Hefe Weizen (Tucher) from a friend and I 
want to make one using the yeast from that bottle.  Do any of you know if 
that yeast is the right one or is it just for carbonation?


While I'm at it, I've been looking for a receipe for a Spatan clone.  Is 
there one out there?

Subject: Request - Summery mint brew?


Seeings as summer is well on it's way down under, I was wondering if
anyone has brewed a beer using mint with any success. IMHO a nice mint
drink is extremely refreshing during summer (even a hot mint tea), but I'm
unsure as to weather the beer should be based on a lager or something
substantially sweeter. Recipes and comments appreciated.

        John.

The Riverside Brewing Co. is on 7th and University very near the school.  They
have two or three GABF medal winners, but all of their beers (~5) are very
good.  Also, the Fullerton Hoffbrau is about 45 minutes west on the 91 freeway
in Fullerton on State College.  They also have several good brews to choose
from.  I am particularly fond of their Duke's Bock.  If I am not mistaken,
they brew 5 standards and one seasonal (Christmas, I think is a rasberry
weizen).

Subject: Orifice size clarification/correction


  Howdy folks,
  
  I received a message from Scott Kaczorowski (thanks Scott!) saying the 
  orifice sizes on his burner were both larger than the .035" I mentioned 
  in my previous post.  Last night I checked them with some drills from my 
  whimpy drill set and found the propane orifice was approximately 1/16" or 
  .063" and the natural gas was approximately 3/32" or .094".  I called the 
  gas company where I purchased the burner for clarification and found that 
  he didn't say .035" but a #35 drill or .110" which is just over 7/64".  
  Sorry for the confusion.  
  
  I received a bunch of private email for additional information so I'll 
  pass it along here:
  
  Superb Gas Products: (618) 234-6169  fax# (618) 234-5218 
  48 Empire drive, Belleville, IL 62220
  
  I purchased the model 35k BTU 16-20E "Professional Cooker"
  
  They don't sell directly but they gave me the 800 number of a distributor 
  800 441-4223.  I can't find the paper that I wrote the price they quoted 
  but I think it was $85 - $89 before shipping.  I called Superb for some 
  local distributors and they were able to provide them but it took a while 
  on the phone, their database was not very user friendly for the person on
  the phone.   
  
  I got mine locally at Van Dyke Gas in Centerline MI (810) 757-8500 for 
  $71.90 plus $39 for the extra gas valve, nipple, 10' of rubber gas hose 
  with fittings, and an extra stove control valve with the new .110" 
  orifice.  BTW he just used the #35 drill in a battery screw driver to 
  drill out the orifice.  No precision involved.  He said that home gas 
  pressure varies and the opening can be enlarged a bit if I wasn't getting 
  enough heat.  My chart shows 1/8 as the next fractional size which is 
  .0125 or close to drill #31 (not a recommendation disclaim, disclaim, 
  disclaim :-) ).
  
  They sell legs for the stove for an additional $15 but the stove would be 
  about 36" (my estimate) off the ground which is too high, in my opnion, 
  with the converted keg I plan to use.  I wouldn't be able to see inside 
  or stir the wort (I'm only 5'9").  The guy at VDG said he can sit on the 
  burner with legs and he was 185 lbs. so it seems sturdy enough.
  
  Sorry for the confusion and I hope this helps.

Subject: PH and SG of sparge




I need some help on the correct procedure for sparging.  Last week
I asked the collective about the recommended rate for sparging (gal / hr)
To summarize the responses (thanks y'all), it seems that the rate of
sparging is not too important.  What IS important is that you continue to
sparge until the runnings reach a SG of 1.010 or a PH of about 6.0 .
It was suggested that the minimum time involved should be no less
than 45 min.  Some responses did suggest flow rates of about 1qt/min.


Well I understand the concepts of stopping the sparge at SG 1.010,
(this keeps the sugar content of the wort high enough), and stopping
at a PH of 5.5 - 6.0 (this stops excess tannin extraction from the grains)
But how do you measure these?


The runnings are at about 75 deg. C.  There would have to be a
significant correction factor added to any SG reading taken with a
hydrometer.  Is this the procedure followed?  What is the correction
factor?


Are those test papers really accurate enough to nail the PH to within
a half a point?  What about the correction due to the high temperature
or the runnings?


One last question.  A few days ago someone in the HBD mentioned
that they add 1/4 tsp of acidblend per 10 gal. of sparge water to
ensure the PH stays below 6.0.  This seems like an interesting idea.
Any opinions on this procedure?


Well bye for now. I've got to go and frig with my fridge.

Sounds like it is time again for a "FOOP" discussion! BTW, FOOP = Foam only
once proteins, which is a theory previoulsy proposed on the digest that
proteins, which may be denatured by foam formation, are no longer able to
form foam after violent bubbling or shaking. I believe this theory was
mostly discounted after numerous empirical studies of the foam stability of
shaken/unshaken beer.

Subject: Quality


Hi -


  I've just got to weigh in on the "quality" thread. ;^)


  It is my opinion that, in the beer world, the word quality has gone the way 
of 'premium'. Premium beer comes from the era when large breweries first 
started transporting beer long distances from the brewery. This beer cost more 
than the locally produced beers: you had to pay a premium when you bought it.
For some reason, premium now means good not more expensive. 


  When thinking about quality I like to keep the words accuracy and precision
in mind. A quality beer is one that is produced in an accurate and precise
manner. In the world o' science, a measurement is accurate if you get the
same number when you repeat the measurement. The precision of a measurement
is how many units (furlongs, hogsheads, microliters, etc) separate two
divisions on your measuring tool. So, a quality beer is one that tastes the
same from one batch to another and that taste is exactly the taste that is
desired. By this measure Budmilloormolatts make quality beer. So does Fritz
Maytag. So does Jim(tm) Koch(tm). I do not. My beers, while usually pleasing
to my taste buds tend to taste different from batch to batch and I'm never
really sure what the beer will taste like when it's done. Budmilloormolatts
have managed to convince the beer drinking public that quality means good
not repeatable.

O.K., here's the direct quote from _Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide_ , 
Chapter 25, p. 218:


"In practice, saturation is not always easy to achieve. For example, 
with bottle-conditioned beer, the priming sugar will ferment in 24
hours or less. At the end of that time, all of the gas is in the bottle. 
However, most of it is in the headspace, because it just rises through 
the beer as it is produced. It can take weeks for the headspace gas 
to dissolve into the beer until, finally, equilibrium is achieved and
the beer is saturated."


I messed up when I said _all_ the gas is in headspace, Miller said _most_ 
of the gas. Is Miller wrong on this one?

Beep, wrong!!! (Disclaimer: I'm no chem engr or hydrologist, but.) The CO2 is
produced by the yeasties.  It is not "in solution", ie it has not been
absorbed between the water and other molecules in solution.  So a portion
escapes to a lower pressure area, ie the headspace.  As the pressure from the
gathering CO2 grows, some CO2 is forced back down into the solution, 
producing carbonation.  So the triggering mechanism you desire is pressure.


When you open a bottle, you heard the hiss, those are gases escaping to a
lower pressure environment.  Then you pour the carbonated beverage into a
glass.  You see the bubbles of CO2 bubbling out of the solution - escaping to
a lower pressure environment!


Conclusion:  Pressure is responsible for a great many systems in this world
(to name a few: carbonation, weather, software releases!).

Fellow Brewers,


I need your help on deciding which type of counter-flow chiller
to purchase.  I currently use an imersion type, but will be
switching to the counter-flow to use with my almost finished RIMS
system.  I'm undecided as to whether to buy/make the copper
tubing in the garden hose type or the coiled tubing in the PVC
pipe style.  The garden hose type seems a bit cumbersome, but I'm
a little apprehensive about the efficiency of the PVC type.  I
currently brew 5 gallon batches, but would like to move up to 8-
10 gallon.


Opinions and/or experiences?


Thanks very much for your help.  Private email is fine.  I'll
post results if there is enough interest.

 Phil Crosby, who originated the term "zero-defects", gives a relevant
 definition of "quality", which I paraphrase from memory:


        Quality is conformity to specifications, or the process
        whereby a specification is changed to what the producer
        and the customer really need.


 Thus, when I underhopped my English Pale Ale, I got a brew that lots
 of people liked, but it was a low-quality product, because it did not
 conform to the specifications for an English Pale Ale.  If my intent
 had been to redefine English Pale Ale, and I had succeeded, then my
 effort would have been a quality product.

 Excellence?  Judged against what standard?  I recall a college
 conversation about some ice cream "liberated" from the kitchen.
 "This is the worst chocolate ice cream I have ever eaten!"
 "Uh, Pete?  It's black raspberry ice cream."
 "Oh!"  Pete tastes some more.  "It's pretty good black raspberry."

Subject: Stuck kettle runoff




I'm having trouble with runoff from the kettle in my three-tier.
The system is new (only three batches so far), but the runoff from
the kettle has stuck immediately and completely on the last two.


There seems to be no correlation between OG or hopping.  The first
batch was a Dunkelweizen that came out way too big at 1.068 and 2
oz hops.  The second was a Belgian Strong at OG 1.096 and 1 oz hops
and some curacao and coriander (plus 3 oz in hop bags that were
removed before cooling).  The third was a Scottish Ale at OG 1.062
and 4 oz hops.  All hops were whole and all were 11 gallon batches.
The base malt for all has been domestic 2-row.


When I did the Belgian Strong Ale, I used hop bags.  And that is
why I didn't worry too much about a repeat of the problem for the
Scottish: I'd brewed the BSA previously at a friend's, and there was a
very large amount of hot break which clung to the hops in the kettle.
I figured with the break clinging to the hops, it was out of the way
and my error was not giving the break something to latch on to in
the BSA.  Well, even with 4 oz of hops to filter out the break, the
Scottish stuck just as hard.  However, none of this occurred with
the DW, though I don't remember a spectacular hot break with that one.


The manifold in my kettle is slotted copper tubing.  It is a short
length of tubing with an "S" bend in it so that about 3" of tubing
(the part that's slotted) sits right down in the very bottom of the
kettle. It is therefore buried absolutely as deep as it can go in
the trub and hops and whatever other muck is in there.  I used to
wonder what people were talking about when they discussed hot break.
Now I know.  I never used to see this stuff in my old stovetop system.


I think I need to get the manifold above the crud and take the loss
(about a gallon of wort!)  Who said "Life is short, grain is cheap"?
My thought is to make a large circular manifold that runs along the
top of the bottom bowl of the keg.  Whirlpool, let things settle,
and everything should proceed smoothly, yes?  (This was suggested
a while back by someone whose name I forget, and sounds like a good
idea to me.)


Another idea:  I can get SS screen, and my neighbor suggested that I
wrap the manifold in two layers of screen with the outer layer being
fairly course and the inner fairly fine.  There would have to be some
space between all the layers, of course.  This would also require that
I get the manifold up off the bottom a little.  Seems to me that the
thing would still be buried in muck and break material would make it
into my fermenter (that is, no different than the situation I have
now with emergency siphoning).


I do not want to go to a false bottom if it can be at all avoided.


Thanks in advance for any ideas or encouragement.

Mike for the most part the stove is only used to hold the temperature of the
mash.  I only set my stove on warm and then turn it off half way though the
mash.  This keeps the mash from losing any degrees during the mash and of
coarse if the mash temp does drop you can always heat easily enough.

I've had a mini lauter tun for about 1-1/2 years and I love it.  The only
problem is that it's a "MINI" lauter tun.  If it's Phills' mini it will only
hold 5lb.  I've wanted to move to all grain batches but have yet to acquire
a larger one.  (The a five gallon picnic cooler on the porch that I've had
my eye on.)


As for putting a plastic bucket in the stove, I wouldn't do it.  Just in case.

Just as a point of information, Brandy is a distilled liquor.  Either
distilled from grape wine or from fermented fruit.  Brandy is typically
about 80 proof (40% alcohol).


I'm not sure what the recipe (which I have omitted) will produce, but it
is not brandy.

Subject: Canning kit report


Hi,
     Not to beat this to death, but I just wanted to update everyone.
There were alot of private requests about info. on the canning kit.
For those of you who might be interested but didn't E-mail me,
my suggestion is to get the make and model number of your electric 
stove and go to an appliance store to order it.  The kit probably will
not be in stock.  Be sure to follow the (rather simple) instructions! 
(CYA disclaimer: consult an electrician if you have any questions).
    Onward.  I finally had the chance this week to try this thing out.
I boiled about 3 1/2 gallons of very-late-to-be-made (extract) Holiday 
Ale wort in my 4 gal. pot.  Maybe I'll call it "Spring Celebration Ale".
Now then, it seemed that the wort reached boiling sooner than usual, and 
boy was there alot of foaming!  Kind of like those science experiments
I did as a kid.  Anyway, as another check, fewer of the coils were glowing
orange when I lifted the pot, which means more of them were in direct 
contact.  The pot was supported *very* securly on the burner.  I took 
someones private E-mail suggestion and lined the stove top with extra 
wide aluminum foil.  This worked great to avoid my other big problem
of burnt wort drops on the stove top.  I lost the message, but to 
whomever sent it a big "thank you". 
     For me this kit is a winner.  At $58.00 though, it is kind of pricy
in my opinion for what you get and it interestingly enough is 
about the same price as some of the propane setups around here.  Buying 
this is kind of like a commitment/investment in electric stove top 
brewing, because you really don't need the kit for anything else, except
maybe canning veggies.  Your price may be different depending on your stove.  
Further testing is of course planned.
     If anybody has anymore questions feel free to E-mail me.  I'd also be
interested in the opinions of anybody else that decides to use one of these
kits.

Subject: Oven mashing


Dear Friends, I'd like to add to the thread on mashing using the oven 
and stove top combo.  It does in fact work great, and one need not 
restrict oneself to very small mashes.


I do this just about every time, about 50 batches so far since I 
moved from extract + specialty.  I can mash up to 4 kg (8.8 lb) of 
grain in my 17 L (4.5 US gal) SS pot (it was cheap--A$25 at the local 
Kmart equivalent).  These days I rarely get below 29 pt/lb/gal, 
usually better than 31, so that it is no problem getting normal batch 
sizes of 1040 to 1045 beers just from the grain if need be.  I 
usually add 0.5 to 1 kg (1.1 to 2.2 lb) of extract syrup because I 
make lots of 1050-1060 OG beers.


Multi step mashes in my setup go like this: dough in stiff for the 40 
C rest, then infuse boiling water for the 60 C rest, which brings the 
water:grain ratio to target values; then heat directly on the stove 
for the 70 C rest and the mashout.  Takes only about 5 min for each 
boost.  Then transfer to the lauter tun (slotted copper manifold) and 
away we go.


I find that at 40 C virtually no insulation is required because the 
mash loses only about a degree in the 30 min of the rest, so I just 
let it sit there on the stove (on a cool burner of course).  During 
this time I have preheated the oven on its lowest setting, and leave 
it there for both the 60 and 70 degree rests.  My temperatures are 
virtually invariant.


If you have an oven that cycles badly, like we heard about recently,
then just preheat the oven and then leave it shut off during the
rests.  All you want if for heat loss to be minimized, and the oven
is a well-insulated box to start with.  The higher heat capacity of
malt + water, plus its thermal mass, will keep things in good shape
for the duration of the mash period (90 min in my case).


Hope this helps, Dave in Sydney

Let's think for a minute about how CO2 is produced. Yes, they are
produced by yeast, but on a deeper level, they are produced inside
yeast cells (which are mostly water) by enzymatic reactions involving
a single sugar molecule, and producing a single CO2 molecule. A single
CO2 molecule produced in an aqueous environment will quickly dissolve,
as CO2 is highly soluble in H2O.  Miller's view, that this single CO2
molecule is generated inside a yeast cell, diffuses across the cell
membrane, and works its way past 'billions and billions' of H2O 
molecules in order to reach the headspace, without ever dissolving, 
seems absurd to me.


It is a fairly common procedure to monitor the degree of
carbonation of a naturally conditioned beer by monitoring the pressure
in the headspace.  As the liquid becomes carbonated, some of the CO2
outgasses into the headspace in order to reach an equilibrium
condition.  The pressure thus gradually rises as carbonation
progresses.  If Miller's view were correct, then monitoring the
headspace pressure would show a rapid rise (over 24-48
hours) to a pressure many times the equilibrium pressure, then
gradually drop over the next couple weeks as the headspace CO2 worked
its way back into solution.  This just doesn't happen.

While you are right that more water will be trapped in a finely ground
grist, it's not because of the flour -- the flour is starch and should,
if you run you mash well, be converted to sugar and swept away in the
runnings.  No, I believe that the reason for more absorption is that
the finely ground husks trap more water.


A few days ago someone blamed a set mash on too much water in the tun
"compacting the grain bed."  I don't believe this to be true either.
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I believe that the most common
cause for a set mash is too fine a crush, where the husks are overly
pulverized.  Other reasons for set mashes are very gummy worts from
high percentages of things like unmalted barley, rye, wheat, oats and
even malted rye and wheat.  Even with these grains, if your crush is
not too fine and you have included sufficient beta-glucan and protein
rests, you shouldn't have a problem (what I'm saying is that if you
add these grains to a simple mash program that never had problems with
slow runoff, you can have problems).  Now there may be those among
you that will say, "my crush wasn't too fine and I still had a set mash"
but then crush quality is so subjective and what seems "coarse" to you
may be "fine" to someone else.


As an exercise, I pose this question:  Have any of you had a set mash
(stuck runoff) while using a non-adjustable (one less variable) JSP
MaltMill(tm) on an all-barleymalt mash?  My guess is no.

I had never thought about it, and although I have Miller's new book, I
have not read that part yet, I believe that Miller may have a point.  How
long would it take to a completed batch of beer (assuming it hasn't been
sitting for two weeks) to ferment 1/2 cup of sugar if you did not put it
into a bottle and seal the cap?  Probably three days, no?  Now, there may
be some additional complexity in this issue regarding the yeast working
under pressure, but I would be hesitant to immediately say that Miller is
wrong and that the pressure causes the fermentation of a measly 1/2 cup
of glucose to take 2 weeks.  That's what you're saying, Kelly, isn't it?


When I read Jerry's post, I started thinking about this and realized that
I don't know enough about how yeast work under pressure to answer this
question definitively.  Does anyone?  An experiment to prove or disprove
this would be to prime a bottle with double the amount of corn sugar and
then to open it (venting the CO2 produced) after two days, recap it and
then see if, after two weeks, the carbonation is:


1. close to normal (in which case Miller is right), or


2. overcarbonated (in which case Miller was wrong).


Do I have this experiment right?  Any alternate suggestions?


As for Kelly's assertion that "The newly produced CO2 is produced
_in solution_..." I think that it is possible that it is not.  Note
that when you bottle the beer, it already contains as much CO2 as it
can in solution at whatever temperature it was fermenting.  It will
lose a bit of dissolved CO2 during siphoning because of the partial
vacuum just past the peak of the siphon setup.  However, as the CO2
gets produced, the CO2 would have to go somewhere and it can't so
that pressure would increase.  It is this increase in pressure that
causes more CO2 to go into solution in the beer.  Where the pressure
builds is an odd question because liquids are incompressable, for
the most part, right?  Time to hand off to the physicists...


Whoop, just thought of another experiment:


Bottle two bottles, primed normally.  After three days, shake one to
dissolve the alleged CO2 in the headspace.  After one more day, open
both.


1. If the shaken one is close to normally carbonated, then Miller is
right, but


2. if they are both flat and sweet, then Miller is wrong.


Furthermore, you could probably do this even less subjectively:


Bottle ten bottles, normally primed measureing the specific gravity of
the *primed* beer and recording it.  Every day, for 10 days, open a
bottle and measure the gravity.


1. If it plummets the first three days and then stays steady, then Miller
is right, but


2. if it drops slowly over the course of the ten days, then Miller is wrong.


I'm not about to bet either way, but my *gut* feeling (after saying all that)
is that Kelly is right and Miller is not.  I do still want proof, though.

It is important to add that this should *only* be done for the final
decoction.  Except for the final decoction (going from saccharification to
mashout), you should *not* remove and boil the *liquid* from the mash for use
in raising the mash temperature -- you must use the *thick* part of the mash
 -- the *grain*.  The liquid part contains the enzymes!  For the final
decoction you *should* use the liquid because boiling the grain in the final
decoction may release some starch which will not, after the mashout, have
any enzymes to convert it to sugars.

Many thanks to Spencer Thomas, Al Korzonas, Eric Miller, Russ Brodeur, 
 and Steve Alexander, all of whom know much more about decoction mashing 
than I do, and all of whom leapt on my error in heating the *liquor* 
instead of the grist; about the only thing I had right was that I knew 
that this destroys the enzymes. However, where does it say that the enzymes 
are mostly in the liquor? If it does I have missed it (obviously). 


There is one point that might be of interest: using the first- runnings 
sp. gr. with the original volume of mash liquor instead of the final 
volume after sparging with the final sp. gr. to calculate E.R. As usually 
calculated the E.R. includes both the effect of mash-conversion 
efficiency and the effect of extraction efficiency. I think there might 
be some merit in knowing what the conversion efficiency is independent of 
the extraction, and the way I did it should give that, n'ext-ce pas?
