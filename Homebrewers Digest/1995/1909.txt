Subject: Real Beer Page-December Issue


The following appeared on the Real Beer Page, December Issue.  I am
only passing along the information.  I do not have a vested interest in the
page or any of the merchants (Although I will take the advice to quietly
post the note at home).




* Holiday Wrap up:
The following list of gift ideas is for anyone who likes beer. If you're a
beer 
enthusiast, print this out and leave it around in strategic places --
windshields, 
the bathroom mirror, bird cage, etc. -- as a hint about what you'd like to
receive 
this year...


** For the Home and Pro Brewer on Your List **
The ultimate gift for homebrewers? Try a 10-week intensive brewer's 
apprenticeship program from the American Brewer's Guild. It costs
$6,950 but 
everyone who graduated last year is now brewing professionally, so
we think it 
pays for itself. A little more than you were thinking about spending? Try
the 2-
day advanced homebrewer course for $149.00 or for that special
someone 
interested in opening a micro or brewpub, the 2-day How-To course
complete 
with business plan for $395.00. Sign up at http://realbeer.com/abg/


If you want a gift that reminds your favorite brewer about your
generosity the 
whole year, we'd like to recommend a subscription to
BrewingTechniques

events in 
each issue. Best part of this magazine? Almost no advertising, and
they're 
interested in keeping it this way. 1-year subscription: $25.00, but get
two; you'll 
want a copy yourself. Travel to: 
http://realbeer.com/brew/subscription/subscription.html


Want to head out on the brew travels path yourself? Make sure you use
our 
brewtour database at http://realbeer.com/rbp/brewtour.html. And if you

Hop essential oils (the flavor and aroma culprits) are not completely gone
after 10-15 minutes of boiling. Even a 60 minute boil can leave hop flavor
components in addition to bitterness. Of course a longer boil removes more
hop oils, but there is always something left. The flavor contribution
changes, in character and magnitude as a function of boil time.

Subject: Thank you/Question about mash temps


First, I would like to thank all of you for the information about 
all-grain. Each and every response I got provided valuble insight into 
all-grain brewing. I will start to aquire the equipment needed and will 
do an all grain batch after the holidays. 


==================================


I did a partial grain/extract this last weekend and during the mash I 
let the temps get up to about 175F before settling at 158. Will elevated 
temps prevent the starch/sugar conversion from occuring even if you bring 
the temps back down? 


After the mash I tested the SG before adding the extract. Does the SG 
show sugars only or will soluble starches affect the SG as well.


One final question. Will unconverted starches affect the beer??

Subject: Decoction mashing in the 20th century...


  Hola, decoction gurus!  I've been sincerely trying to understand what's 
going on with decoction mashing and, of course, would like to clear some things 
up.  You remove "the thickest portion of the mash and boil it" for x? minutes 
 - lately I've been reading here that a strainer could/should be used for 
getting this "thick portion" to minimize the liquid drawn off (sorry 'bout the
lack of credits for the strainer, I used to use an Al pot and have several 
mercury amalgam fillings ;-)


  It seems as though what you're really doing is boiling a small amount of 
wort and _steaming_ the grains that were removed by the steam rising 
through the grain.  It also seems as though the depth of the grain being 
boiled in this manner would be rather critical, but I've never seen that 
issue addressed.


  If The Whole Point (TM) of this exercise is to raise the temperature of 
some of the grain to X degrees (212F ?) to work "chemistry magic", yet 
avoid scorching the bottom, mightn't one accomplish this rather handily and 
quickly by using a microwave oven and corningware/pyrex rather than direct 
heat to the bottom of a pot?


  Am I tragically off-track here, or the proud daddy of Lazy Brewer's Nuclear 
Lager?  If someone who understands the reactions involved would be kind enough
to summarize the process in a "raise X percent of the grain to X degrees for X 
minutes" manner I'd like to give it a shot.  If appropriate, explaining at 
which point I became full of beans would likewise be appreciated :-)

Subject: counter-flow chillers


I use the copper tube in a hose model. To make the chiller more manageable, I
coiled it around a 5 gallon bucket. I arranged the chiller in one orderly
layer from top to bottom, using nylon wire ties threaded through holes
drilled in the bucket to keep the coils from moving. The theory was to
maintain a 'grade' from top to bottom because I siphon the hot wort from my
boil pot. I'm sure it's overkill, but mine is 35' long; the tube diameter is
3/8". Needless to say, I can chill my wort down to the temperature of my tap
water with no problem. The bucket provides a handy handle and a place to
stash a few odds and ends.

The important thing is the change in gravity.  From 1.063 to 1.017 is
73% attenuation.  This is typical for Wyeast Irish Ale.  No problem.
Let the beer sit for a week to settle yeast and bottle.  It will
be fruity because of the heat, but should be tasty.  Personally, I
like fruity stouts.

A relevant book would be The New Complete Joy Of Homebrewing by Charlie

Still another is Dave Miller's Complete Handbook Of Homebrewing.

There is only one protein rest at about 40 degrees celsius or 122 degrees 
Farenheit which  is conducted.  The reason for a protein rest is so that 
adequate nutrients can be provided for the yeast to carry fermentation 
out to it's completeness.  The other one or, at times, two rest are 
related to converting starches to sugars.  In light-bodied beers, a rest 
of 149 to 152 degrees f or sixty degrees celsius is conducted in order 
for highly fermentable sugars to be extracted from the grains. In more 
high-bodied beers, a rest at 158 degrees aids in the production of 
unfermentable dextrines which will give mouth and body to the beer.

You deactivate the enzymes at this stage.

>From what I understand, Decoction mashing provides more melanoidins which 
contribute a malty flavor to beers.  This maltiness is the flavor which 
is associated with Bocks, hels, and other German styles.  It can be a 
more time consuming process since you have to watch it so that it doesn't 
burn.  BTW, I thank the person who responded to my question about mashing 
in 1901.  I'll e-mail you personally since I have, unfortunately, 
forgotten your name.  Some of the finalic flavors come from unconverted 
starches in the grain which the boiling brings to the fore.  These are 
converted to sugars when the decoct is added to the rest of the mash 
whose enzymes are still active.

Subject: Is it true that.....


Hey science guys...... Someone told me that the fermenting beer in a carboy
is several degrees warmer than the air outside the carboy because the
chemical reactions taking place within the carboy during fermentation
generate heat/energy.  In a 60 degree house during Winter, could one put
some faith in this "theory" and assume the fermenting ale to be at 65
degrees?  Im hoping what they meant by "several" degrees warmer means about
5 degrees.  Any brewers doing open fermentations able to test this theory or
is the theory wrong to begin with?

Subject: Protein rest during decoctions


I decoct my mashes for all dark lagers; the malt character in the beer is worth 
the effort. However, what is the effect of, what seems to me, to be an overlong 
protein rest on the wort? After pulling the decoction 10 min into the 50 C 
protein rest, it is at least 1 h (I do long boils) before the decoction is put 
back to the main mash to raise the temp to starch rest. I suspect that with the 
undermodified malts that Noonan spoke about in his book, that this was not a 
problem. I use Ireks malts - are these modified enough so that a 70 min protein 
rest is going to chop up too many proteins? Head retention on my beers is not 
spectatcular, however they taste ok.

I'm sorry, but this simply cannot be correct. The quantity of gas that will
dissolve (and stay dissolved) in liquid is *very* dependent on the pressure of
the gas above it. If this was not true, then you couldn't "force carbonate"
beer using a CO2 tank; and beer (and soft drinks) that were left uncapped
would never go flat!


The change in density of the beer itself due to external pressure is
practically nil; I'd be very surprised if it can even be measured, without
sophisticated equipment. When was the last time you saw the *beer* expand when
the bottle was uncapped? (I'm talking about the liquid itself, not any bubbles
that might come out of solution.)

I do not see how you can change the density of anything without changing its
concentration, as the two are proportional to each other.

The compressability of water is so slight that it is negligible at the
pressures encountered in a bottle of beer. The amount of dissolved CO2 is
determined primarily by the pressure and the temperature (colder liquids can
hold more dissolved gas).

Check me on this, but one of the few things I retained from
good old SUNY Cortland was that liquids are not generally
compressable.  Isn't that the basis of hydrolics in
general?  Thats why we put brake fluid in our cars and
why it is disasterous to get a very compressable air
bubble in your brake line.  The air would compress instead
of just pushing as the liquid would.  I've been scuba
diving in lakes before and havn't noticed thicker water near
the bottom (too scared of sudden death to notice much of
anything probably).  The water may be denser near the
bottom, but I would say it was caused by colder tempatures
and not due to compression.

so I "decocted" the following plan. First "sparge" the inverted carboy
(I'm not trying to resurrect the "inverted carboy" thread !) with
"propane inside" and heat to force the stopper out. I'm not sure which
would be the best heat source, "stove/oven", "steam injection" or a
full blown Cajun cooker.  I wouldn't want to turn the carboy into a
"Koch"-rocket with me as the pilot.  My main concern is, will this effect

To maintain a constant temp in an oven is impossible, but there is a way 
to mash in the oven and to be sure of the temperature. Put your 
thermometer into a pan of water and put the oven at it's lowest setting. 
close the oven and check it every 1/2 hour. Adjust the oven to achive the 
desired level of heat. I use this method to do an infusion mash.  It 
takes awhile to find this temperature, but I feel better knowing rather 
than guessing.  Remove the pan with the water and insert kettle with the 
mash.I leave the themometer in the mash and check it through the oven window.  
The oven timer reminds me to check every 30 min.

Hello HBDers,


DejNik`at`aol.com asks "does anyone know where I can get specifications for
different styles of beer, like O.G, F.G ranges, color, bitterness etc."


Charlie Papazians "The Homebrewer's Companion" has a pretty extensive listing
of beer
styles and thier specifics, also SUDS 4.0 has an AHA beer style data base,
you can find it in the downloads of AOL


Now for my .03 cents worth (inflation) on the carbonation thread,  it seems
to me in my limited knowledge that as CO2 is produced in solution, since
that's where the yeast is, that it will also leave solution so as to maintain
equlibrium as it is produced.  Therefore the carbonation level of the beer
and the amount of CO2 in the head space should be at approx. the same levels
until full carbonation is reached.  Maybe thats too simple an explanation
(and -maybe- wrong) but its something to think about.

Subject:  Heating  Sparge in Plastic Bucket 


Regarding heating sparge water in a plastic bucket using a water heater element:
If you get a 220V element, and run it on 110V, then it will produce about
1/4 of its rated power, which will reduce its temp considerably. I use
a 3000W 220V element at 100 volts mounted in a plastic juice bottle to 
heat sparges. We call it the HotRod. The plastic bottle acts as a handle,
a sheild against touching the wilres, and a float. That is you can throw it 
into a bucket and it floats with the element down. NOTE: the element sticks
out of the juice bottle, with the wires inside the bottle. The bottom of the
bottle has been cut off.
Now to get to the point, the element screw fitting screws fairly tightly into
the bottle neck, and this is sealed, strengthened with polyester resin. We have
had no problems with the element base or fitting getting hot enough, to melt or 
soften the polyethelene bottle so you should be OK?

I think that we are in agreement (and the rest of SLGibson's
post was well thought-out also) except for the loss of dissolved
CO2.  I'll grant you that some of the CO2 comes out of solution
due to agitation, but I feel that a significant portion of the lost
CO2 is due to the pressure changes involved in siphoning.


Consider this: take a bottle of filtered beer and shake it.  Are
there bubbles?  Not really.  If you immediately open the bottle,
you will have an outrush of CO2 because the turbulence of the
beer (eddy currents?) provide nucleation sites.  But this beer
is at equilibrium till you open it, so you don't have foaming
before you open the bottle.  (There was a long thread about this
in HBD back in 1988 or 89).


Similarly in the fermenter -- the beer is at equilibrium.  It is
holding as much CO2 as it can for the given temperature and pressure
(approx 1 atmosphere plus that due to the weight of the water displaced
in the airlock, right?).  Agitation will cause some CO2 to come out
of solution but since the CO2 in solution is not supersaturated, it
has no desire to leave.  Therefore, don't underestimate the losses due
to the pressures involved in siphoning.  Remember that it's more than
just the height differences -- we're talking dynamic system here and
moving fluids mean pressure (or density) drops.  Remember how many psi
drop there is in six feet of hose on a kegging system (albeit smaller
ID hose)?


As for the incompressability, yes, you caught me.  What I should
have said was that compared to the headspace (which is a mixture of
gasses), the beer is essentially incompressable.

I was just reading about this last night and read both DeClerck and
Malting and Brewing Science, so I'm not sure which said which, but
the bottom line was that there appeared to be no correlation between
break removal and stability.  Another factor was clarity and I believe
that there was less chill haze in the beer made with trub-free wort.


The most important factors associated with the break removal were yeast
activity and taster "preference." The yeast performed much better in
the trub-free batch, presumably (by the author) because the break
interfered with the yeast's ability to uptake some nutrients.  The
taster preference was rather nebulous.


The author did not specifically say that tasters preferred the trub-
free beer, but (paraphrasing) "...subsequent batches brewed with the
trub-free wort showed an increasing preference by the tasters..." or
something like that.  I don't know if I've written it quite right
here, but in effect, it sounded to me as if the tasters first like
the trub-full beer, but then after subsequent tastings of subsequent
batches, they began to like the trub-free beer.  Very strange.  I
read it over and over and still am not sure if I have the meaning
right.  If anyone else could read these passages and comment, I
would be interested in your opinions.


Jim's right though -- removal of break is recommended for a number of
reasons.

You've got that backwards.  The pin-lock are shorter and fatter -- at least
all the pin-lock that I've ever seen are shorter and fatter.

You also may be able to remove the fittings with a crescent wrench, it works

Yes you can compress anything but liquids such as water are essentially
incompressible. That is, if you transfer your cubic foot volume of water at
the surface of the lake to the bottom of the lake, it will still inhabit
about 1 cubic foot although at a higher static pressure. Of course gases in
the water will change things somewhat adding some compressibility to the
otherwise essentially incompressible volume of water. Not sure what this
adds to the thread. -Dave

Here's another solution. How about if everyone who posts, stop first and
consider whether their post is directly related to homebrewing? You'all who
post frequently know that there can be as many as 70 or 80 posts ahead of
you and it can take several days for the post to manifest itself in the HBD.
A lot of bandwidth has be devoted lately to subjects I would consider
irrelevent to homebrewing. Something to think about. Have a beer! -Dave

In response to a request for a Fuller's ESB clone, there are
some recipes for this in the Cat's Meow III, which can be
accessed through THE BREWERY on the World Wide Web
(http://alpha.rollanet.org/).  BTW, this web page is full of
good information for home brewers at all levels, and includes
numerous links to other related pages.  I highly recommend it
to those with web access.
