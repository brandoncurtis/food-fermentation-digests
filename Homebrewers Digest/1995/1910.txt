Subject: To replace blow-off, or not?


Submitted to the collective consciousness:


I've got a 5 gallon batch of Strong Scotch Ale in *very* active
fermentation.  After 24 hours, it's blown off about 2 quarts of bubbles, and
doesn't seem to be letting up.


I'm tempted to try to replace the lost volume with sterile water, but I also
figure I'll just end up lowering the FG.


Thoughts, suggestions, experiences?

Here is the formula I use.  I hope someone will jump in if it is "less 
than pure":


((((Farenheit temp - 60)/10)*.0025)+hydrometer reading).   for example, 
adjusting a reading of 1.050 at 75F:


(((75F - 60)/10)*.0025) + 1.050)
= (((15/10)*.0025)+1.050)
= (1.5*.0025)+1.050
= .00375+1.050
= 1.053 rounded.

I don't have an answer to this, but I do have a related question.  Why use
a rotating spray arm at all?  I have always been under the impression that
you should keep the surface of your grain bed submerged in about an inch
or so of water when sparging.  So trying to evenly distribute the sparge
water on the surface of the grain bed seems sorta pointless, doesn't it?

Subject: Converting a keg the hard way/kinder gentler brewing


I finally got my keg top cut out using only a jigsaw, not a sawsall.
Needless to say, the cutout is not completely round, but isn't too bad.  I
burned out 2 grit jigsaw blades in the process.  I still don't have the
spigot installed, but that won't keep me from brewing at least a few
batches.  After cutting out the top, I only had one problem:  The keg was
so beaten up that the bottom was too far out of round to fit on my Brinkman
cooker.  Doh!  I never really considered that too much, since I knew that I
had seen all the burners mentioned on the HBD I figured they would all fit
a keg bottom.  Eventually.


When shopping for the burner, I never really considered the fit to the keg
too much, except that it seemed that it would be sturdier to have a burner
that fit inside the keg bottom to one where the keg merely stood on top.
I'm generally very pleased with the unit, but it's been a major PITA to get
my beaten up converted keg to fit on the Brinkman.  The keg was out of
service because the tap was stripped out, but I guess they could have
retired it for the bottom, too. Anyway, after a few nights of very loud
pounding with a ball peen hamer, it finally fits, but it's still a tight
fit.

Subject: RIMS heater


   I am now using a "water wizard" water heater element in my RIMS (available
from Grainger).  Last brew session I somehow managed to turn the heater on
after the sparge when the element was dry.  SURPRISE!!!!! The element did NOT
self-destruct.  While I do not recommend running any element dry, I thought
the RIMS users out there would like to know of a product that will not
destroy itself when used by a homebrew besotted idiot.
   Kids, do not try this at home.

Subject: Gearing up for all grain


If my SO comes through with the Christmas goodies that I wanted (or even if 
she doesn't) I plan on doing my first all grain batch one weekend this January 
(as long as it is not bitter cold outside.. that's where I boil my wort). 
Because of space limitations I have decided to go with the following: A 10 
gallon SS stockpot to do the mash. This is the same as my boiling pot. I want 
to experiment and do more than single infusion mashes, so the brewpot seemed a 
natural choice (not to mention that I already had made the investment). I do 
not intend on modifying the brewpot, so I will be using a separate lautering 
system (probably something similar to the Listermann[TM] system). Adding heat 
is simple enough, I only have to turn the burner on and watch the temp.


My dilemma is this... I am trying to find something to insulate the pot with. 
It must be easily removable. Ideally, it can remain [wrapped] around the pot 
while it is on my cajun cooker. Any ideas out there???


TIA

After the recent postings on CF chillers, I went down to

able to go from the 3/4 to 3/8 in one fitting(no copper tubing
in between the fittings).  Then I went 3/4 pipe to 3/4 npt.  
They had 3/4 npt to garden hose fittings in male and female(brass).




Hope this helps

I will concede that everyone is taught in school that liquids are slightly 
compressible, so (theoretically) they are not incompressible.  However, for 
all practical purposes, liquids are simply not compressible.  The amount 
that they actually can be compressed is so small that it is completely 
ignored in virtually all fluid design cases.


Using the lake example as a data point (and with sincere apologies to the 
metric folks), let's assume that the lake is 100 feet deep, and is filled 
with pure, distilled, 50 deg F water.  The pressure at the bottom of the 
lake will be 43.3 psig, which increases the density from 62.4094 lbs/cu-ft 
to 62.4181 lbs/cu-ft, or about 0.01%.


I submit that a scuba diver cannot discern this increase in density.  He 
probably can, however, detect the increase in pressure and possibly the 
increase in density of the air that he breathes (gases are easily 
compressible).

I have added oak chips to IPA's before an fount it to add a little wood
flavor.  In your reading,  you might have read that the wood used is French
White Oak which in theory has a different tast that our American Red or
White Oak.  The last batch of IPA I brewed,  I used Am. Red Oak strips that
I cut on my table saw.  I boiled them in water for 20 minutes and poured the
water off then added a fist full into the secondary (5 gal.).  This worked
O.K. and gave me a nice oak tast but it took about 20 minutes to get the oak
strips out of the carboy wen it was done.


I have seen discussions about the value of adding oak to the IPA's.  Some
have indicated that the oak casks might have been waxed,  varnished,  or
sealed in some other way as to not allow the beer to even come in contact
with it.  I don't know about that but it sure would be something to have a
real oak cask to store my beer in :)

Subject: pH margins of error


I've got a bit of a problem: I've got two different brands of pH papers and
am getting consistently different readings from each. Here's what I'm using:


1. Precision Labs, Inc.--pH 4.6-6.2


2. Hydrion Papers--pH 4-9


During a mash, I'm consistently getting the following results with the same
sample:


Mash-in: Precision Labs--pH 4.9; Hydrion Papers--6.0
Sparge Water: Precision Labs--5.8; Hydrion Papers--7.0


What I want to know is how can I take a known pH, like vinegar, dilute it
with distilled water to arrive at a series of pH's to test the papers to
determine which is more accurate? I realize there are buffers for
calibrating meters, but I'd like to avoid the cost if that is possible.
Anyone got any ideas?

When I had a dishwasher, I did this too, but without the empty run

The correct OG is whatever you think is correct.  I routinely shoot for
about 1.055 since I like some body and maltiness to go with the 45IBUs
of hops.  If you like lighter beers (which I guess you don't) then brew
a smaller beer. If you like English bitters, however, you may indeed
want to shoot for 1.040 starting gravity.
As to your recipe, 6 # dried malt extract in a 5 gallon batch will give
you an OG near 1.050.  And I hope someone corrects me if I'm wrong,
but you can skip the gypsum in an extract beer.

We discussed this a few weeks back.  Although the original IPAs 
were stored in oak casks for the voyage to India, the oak imparted
no flavor to the beer (for various reasons).  Oak is not a proper
flavor in an IPA or any other beer.  Save your oak chips for a 
chardonnay.

Go for it, but wrap up and insulate the carboy(s) as best you can, to
prevent light penetration and to minimize temperature fluctuation.  The
insulation also acts as insurance in case you get a sudden cold snap and
the temperature dips below freezing.  I and a friend have both brewed
several lagers in this fashion with good results.  Also, pitch the yeast
inside at room temperature and don't move it outside until it gets going.

Subject: beer and bread


        I just wanted to direct people's attention to the Food Section in 
the December 13 edition of the Boston Globe.  In this section is an article 
documenting an interesting relationship between a baker and a brewery in 
Boston.  
        For those of you who are unable to get the Globe (most of you), I 
will summarize.  The Tremont brewing company which specializes in English 
style ales and the Biga bread company which specializes in Italian breads 
moved into the same building, and no they don't share yeast.  (in fact they 
say that Biga uses only wild yeast)  They share grains.  Biga produces a 
bread they call Second Harvest which is maded from wild yeast and spent 
grains from the brewer downstairs.
        This seems like an interesting variation on the thread which has 
been going on about baking bread from beer by-products(is this the proper 
term for spent grains and yeast?).
        The article also includes a recipe (the bread, not the beer) using 
dry yeast rather than wild yeast.  If anybody is interested I may be able 
to send it to them if they write me.

No way, I do this all the time!  Even with my low carbonated Pale ales.
Seems like you might be getting some kind of cap leak, possibly due to
overboiling the seals and damaging the caps or just a bad capping tool. 
[Can I sell you my old one? :)] Probably the former as you say this was
the first time this has happened.. 


The pressure difference is only about 2.3 psi from here to down there.
Maybe the CO2 leaked away during a plane trip where the pressure is

They Can't Give It Away: Brewpub Raffle Fizzles.


The owner of Riverwalk Brewery, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who solicited
worldwide for people to send $100 to enter a raffle to win the brewpub, has
locked the doors and canceled the contest. Not enough entries were received
to cover all the debt he had incurred in the 18 months he owned the brewpub,
Mr. Stasinos told the Miami Herald. He said entry checks were returned to
their senders uncashed. Edward C. Hill Jr., an assistant attorney general in
Tallahassee, Fla., said Florida statutes do not specifically address what
happens if someone advertises a prize for an essay contest and doesn't
deliver. "We were $200,000 short of paying the bills," Stasinos said. "I've
lost everything. I didn't take anything out of there. The bottom line is
we're losing $1,000 a day average." Makes you wonder how the winner
would have turned it around.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------


Remember the big to-do about this last summer?
Aren't you glad you didn't enter? And if you did, aren't you glad you didn't
win?


This really emphasizes the point that both marketing and good beer are
essential
to the sucess of a brewpub. I wouldn't be surprised if location didn't play
into
this as well.

Spelling has never been Jack's strong suit.  What he means is D-C Pils,
which is DeWolf-Cosyns Pils malt.  I typically get 31 to 32 points/lb/gal
and I primarily use DeWolf-Cosyns Pale Ale malt.

>1.  What's the proper quantity to add?


In an IPA, NONE.  IPAs are not oaky.  They were shipped in old, European
Oak casks.  European Oak imparts virtually no flavor or aroma even the first
time you use it and after several uses, there's no way it would impart any
flavor.  If you look in old brewing texts you will often see recommendations
that one should NOT use American Oak for casks because it imparts a flavor.
If you plan on making a pLambiek or a Flanders Brown (trying to imitate
Rodenbach Grand Cru) then I would use an ounce of American Oak chips in a
5 gallon batch and add them only for the last week in the fermenter.


>2.  When/where do you add them?


Last week in the fermenter.


>3.  Do they require any special sanitation?


I recommend a quick dip in boiling water -- not too long or you will extract
too much of their character .  Boil two cups of water, take it off the heat,
add the chips, wait 1 minute, pour through sieve to get the chips out.


>4.  What are they supposed to provide - flavor or clarification?


Aroma.  The clarification misconception is probably from the old story that
Anheuser-Busch uses Beachwood chips for clarifying their beer.  I believe
that even Malting and Brewing Science implies this.  That is not the case
at all -- I've just gotten off the phone with A-B and verified this before
posting -- A-B's yeast is quite flocculent... so much so that they need to
rely on the yeast *after* flocculation to finish attenuating the beer;  to
provide more yeast exposure to the beer, they loosely stack beechwood chips
(inch-wide shavings, roughly two feet long) in the aging tanks to give the
yeast a lot of surface area to settle on.  The beechwood adds no flavor.


The only way I could see wood providing clarification is if there was a lot
of protein in the beer and insufficient tannin.  The tannin from the wood
would then be provided to complex with the protein, in effect creating
chill haze when cooled which would be filtered out or lagered for many
months till the chill haze settled on its own.  There is a process by which
clarification is accelerated simply adding tannin powder (same as that
described above) but you have to get it just right -- I don't think we
homebrewers could ever have the means to measure the protein with such
accuracy so as to make this tannin addition method of clarification practical.


>Also, to make an IPA I was planning to take an ale recipe and add a
>little extra (about a pound of DME) and a bunch of hops.  Any suggestions

A bunch may be accurate, but not very precise ;^).  I recommend that you
brew up a 1.065 pale wort and add about 70 IBUs of English hops.  Measure
and calculate -- don't guess.  Refer to Jackie Rager's article in the
Hops Special Issue of Zymurgy to determine the proper amount for your
boil gravity and hop Alpha Acid percentage.

I think that the answer is, unfortunately, none of the above.  The best time
to pitch the starter is when the glycogen level is highest.  For a long time,
I had misinterpreted the article in which I read about this and was telling
everyone that the proper time was to wait till the yeast in the starter has
settled.  I have since figured out that this is a little later than ideal.
The best time to pitch is shortly after high krausen, when the yeast is still
active, but when the activity is beginning to slow down.


Another question Mike had was whether a 40-60F range of temperature is
okay.  If you use lager yeast and insulate the fermenter well, I think
that this range would not be too wide.  The key is keeping the temperature
from dropping suddenly, like putting 70 degree wort and yeast onto a 35
degree F slab of concrete.  The sudden temperature drop could cause the yeast
to go dormant and then you may have trouble reviving them.


***
David asks if his 1.095 wort, which stopped at 1.025, is stuck.


It is not.  This is 74% attenuation and is all that you can expect from
typical yeasts and actually a rather high attenuation for an Imperial
Stout which often has a lot of unfermentables.

First - you're listing two primary purposes.  "Selling good beer" and "making
$$$ profit".  Do you think anyone puts these two in perfect balance?  


Second, and I've taken Greg around the block with this in private and he
still doesn't get it - there's a difference between making enough "$$$"
to stay in business and make a living, and making "$$$ and PROFIT" and getting
fabulously wealthy.  


If being fabulously wealthy is more important to you than making good beer,
I don't believe that you'll make beer that is as good as someone else who 
thinks that good beer is more important than amassing a personal fortune.


There is a difference between "making a living" and "making a killing". 
That difference will often (not always) show in the quality of the product
in question.  


> SAM ADAMS   BOSTON LAGER
> SAM HOUSTON AUSTIN LAGER


If you grew up in Texas, they aren't really very close at all.  If anything,
SA would ride on SH's coat-tails in the area.


After spending a week in private e-mail trying to convince Brian Dulisse that
average consumers really are stupid enough to have their tastes manipulated
by advertisers, I'd like to spend a couple words here trying to convince 
everyone else that very few people are so stupid as to mistake Sam Adams and
Sam Houston.  


> The Austin brewpub that chose the Sam Houston name apparently did so
> with BBC's name in mind. 


I'm pretty skeptical of that claim.  Sam Houston is an important figure in 
Texas history, all kids growing up in Texas have been required to take state
history classes for years, and the beer's made in Austin.  


I think the issues of the legality of anyone's trademark claims and the 
fairness and validity of various trademark laws should take a backseat 
to the issue of whether or not one brewery is trying to squelch competetion 
for the purposes of profit, as opposed to encouraging good beer everywhere 
(while, obviously, trying to make a buck on the side.)

I say it's not.  Sounds like Grant's is being a turkey about it, and they 
are greatly encouraged to be unfriendly because the outcry over Sam Adams 
ruthless practices was so muted.  Harrumph harrumph, boycott everything.

Subject: Surplus Center temp controller




  A while back I bought two Sunne temp controllers from the
Surplus Center ( 800-488-3407 ).  They are listed on page 145
of the 1995 catalog and are item numbers 11-1911 or 11-1912
(BTW, they are now all sold out).  Since the description in
the catalog says "contacts close upon heat rise" I bought them
to use as a fridge (or is that frig <g>) temp controller.
Well it turns out that the catalog was WRONG.  These units are
actually heater controllers (ie. contacts open upon heat rise).
If anyone else bought some of these and found that they did'nt
work properly, I just wanted to let you know that you can
effectively invert the controller outputs using a normally
closed (NC) relay.  In a nutshell, you use the temp controller to
drive the coil on the NC relay and you then use the NC relay
contacts to switch the power to the fridge.  If anyone wants
more details (Radio Shack part #, schematic, etc.) just email
me at the address below.

Eh people,


Will someone who knows the "real deal" on serving and carbonating with 
nitrogen and CO2 PLEASE help me out?  I want to get a nice, what I call, 
"Nitrogen head and pour" (ie: ala Guiness on draft, ect...) I know 
kegging, carbonating and serving with CO2, but there's not enough info 
available on N2/CO2 mixes.  I plan to purchase a premix tank and extra
(high pressure reg?) reg to serve a creamy bitter and stout, but want to 
get it straight on how much carbonation is needed before serving with the 
70/30 mix and do I have to force carbonate with the 70/30 mix instead.  I 
can't believe Guiness just carbonates at a low CO2 rate and serves with a  
N2/Co2 mix, dosen't the N2 take a while to saturate into solution. 
Zymurgy and my mini-library of brewing literature has not had any good or 
enough info about this subject.  I'll summarize so the reply post is 
shorter and to the point.  Please reply to: emarzews`at`nova.umuc.edu

Shear forces within the fluid can break proteins.  I don't think this
is generally a problem - EXCEPT that enzymes are proteins too and
excessive shear force will denature them !!  I believe that
centrifugal pumps and large diameter/low flow rate & pressure tubing
was the suggested compromise (sorry, I don't have the reference with
me today).  I believe that I came across this in a book commercial
enzyme manufacture & applications.


If you're not having mash conversion troubles then this situation
probably isn't a problem for you.  You should keep in mind that this
book was written for and about commercial operations where everything
is measured in dollars.  If a process requires 15% more enzyme
addition, or requires 30 minutes additional conversion time the plant
may be unprofitable.  Homebrewers don't have the same constraints, but
be aware of the potential problem.  Your no speed control/gate valve
arrangement may be a pessimal design, particularly if you are using
this in a RIMS. You may need to take additional measures when using
unmalted adjuncts.

Gott RIMS false bottom                                5:35 PM       12/13/95


Dear RIMS gurus,


I have found that the Phil's Phalse Bottom doesn't work in my 10 gallon Gott
RIMS setup.  The outlet connection has too small a diameter, and causes
cavitation when the pump tries to suck into its 5/8 inch inlet port.  I tried
elevating the false bottom by setting it on a jury-rigged circular platform I
made by cutting the first 3 inches off the top of a plastic bucket.  This
allowed the wort to flow directly from the large dead space under the false
bottom through the 1/2 inch plastic NPT close nipple which replaced the
spigot.  It worked OK for my first RIMS batch -- I got a good laminar flow
with no cavitation or bubbles.  However, my second RIMS batch was a disaster!
 The hydrostatic pressure (or the weight of the mash, or both) caused the
false bottom to warp and collapse.  :O  Has anyone figured out a way to rig a
false bottom in a 10 gallon Gott RIMS system which can withstand the pressure
caused by recirculation?  Replies by email would be appreciated.
