Subject: VERY foamy brown ale from a keg


   I tried it for the first time last night.  When poured
   through my dandy new tap, it came out almost completely as head - a very
   Guinness-like foamy head.  It took at least 20 minutes for the beer to
   settle down enough for a taste.  


   What's causing the problem...  My beer (very possible, I haven't done this
   very many times)    My new tap?  Any ideas?


This happens to everybody all the time.  If your beer tastes ok when it does
settle down, your beer is probably fine.  What it means is that the pressure
of CO2 dissolved in the beer so high that when it leaves the keg, it comes out
of solution into millions of little bubbles.


The solution is to relieve the pressure in the keg.  You should have bought
kegs with a valve for doing this. (mine is a little ring in the center of the
cap, which I pull to allow the pressure to escape.) You will have to operate
the valve several times, as once you relieve the pressure, then more CO2 can
come out of solution, creating more pressure.  Make sure the CO2 tank is not
connected when you do this.  If you fill the keg too full, you will have to
wait before doing it again, as the head space in the keg is full of foam,
which oozes, or even gushes, out of the pressure relief valve.  I just put up
with my new kegs producing a lot of foam for the first couple of days.


In order to not have the problem next time, you should consider your priming
procedures.  I am effectively using my kegs as secondary fermenters (the
fermentation lock is still glugging every 10 seconds or so when I keg).  So I
find I don't have to prime at all, and I still get lots of foam.


There is also a lot of folklore about length of line from keg to tap, magic
black line, and maybe some other things.  I haven't ever experimented with
these, but I know I have gotten foamy beer from other people's kegs with
various lengths and colors of line.


I believe that the only people who avoid the problem completely are those who
do not use their kegs as secondary fermenters (or transfer to a new keg when
fermentation is complete), and force carbonate very carefully.  I find these
procedures more trouble than a little foam.


Anyway, cheer up.  Inside of a week you'll be swearing because you have to
apply more pressure to get any head at all.  (This is assuming you do what I
do and dispense with the pressure in the keg, rather than keeping the CO2 tank
connected.)

   Regarding that wild yeast in my fridge, anythoughts on harnessing it as a 
   potential "Guelph lambic" yeast or should I just ignore or destroy it?  I 
   suppose I could go to the trouble of finding out what genus and species 
   it is but that sounds like a lot of work and favours to call in.   And 
   yes I know fermenting with an unknown yeast isn't the safest idea but 
   where do you think our brewing ancestors got their yeast from, Smack 
   packs :).  It would probably make a lousy beer (or whatever), has anyone 
   tried this?


When the wild yeast in my refrigerator ferments unprocessed apple cider, it
does a very good job. Quite pleasant flavor, good head, no lambic character at
all.  So I wouldn't worry about trying it on a small amount of wort, although
I wouldn't expect to come out with Pilsener Urquell, either.

The best weizen I ever brewed was a single-step infusion.  Would it have been
better if I had used a decoction?  Maybe.  Was it yummy as heck?  You bet.


Of course, I brewed a pretty darned good Bock once with a single step

There's a pretty wide chasm between "directly related" and "totally 
irrelevant".  The only post *I* have seen lately that is -totally- 
irrelevant is YOURS.  It certainly isn't about homebrewing, I'm not really
sure what it's about.


If you or anyone has a problem with wasting bandwidth here, I think perhaps 
wasting bandwidth isn't the best solution for it.  Every post here has a 
private e-mail address associated with it.  (I know for sure that private 
e-mails to me can cut down my posting, but public posts will only draw more 
noise out - case in point, this e-mail.)

Subject: E.S.B. recipe


Hi, hbders,
My good friend Mark droped by about an hour ago and brought me a sixpack 
of his latest batch, an ESB he calls "batch no. 14" which tasted really 
incredible.  It was quite complex and I asked or rather begged him to 
give me the recipe. Here it is.  It's by no means an orthodox *english* 
esb but here it is:


ibu: around 32-33
Yield:  5 gallons
Method: extract and specialty grains


ingredients:


6 lbs munton amber dry malt extract
1 lb crystal 40l
1.5 oz. Kent goldings (5.3 alpha) 60 mins
0.5 oz. Fuggles 4.5 alpha 30 mins
1 oz. Tetnanger 5.0 alpha 15 minns
1 oz. czech saaz 3.5 alpha 5 mins
1/2 c cornsugar priming
1 tbsp gypsum
1/2 tsp irish moss
Wyeast 1028 London ale yeast or british 1094 works well




Put crystal in 1.5 gal water and bring to boiling. In a 1 qt vessel, 
scoop up some of the water and pour through the grains. He says it's to 
get the most flavour out of them. Remove grains and add gypsum. Now, add 
dme.  Bring water to boil and add goldings hops. Wait thirty minutes and 
add Fuggles.  Wait twenty minutes and add tetnanger.  Five minutes later, 
add Saaz which will be boiled for five minutes and then steeped for ten 
at 170 dg. 


og: 1.050
fg: 1.014


It turned out spectacular, the saaz making it smell wonderfully and the 
spiciness of the tetnanger contributing a delightfuly different flavor 
than I'm accustomed to in ESB's.  It had an wonderful head.  


Y'all take care now,


Alex

Before I got into home-brewing I talked to a very helpful, but hard to
understand, Chinese fellow in an oriental market in Blacksburg, VA about
brewing my own rice wine.  Apparently, many Chinese-Americans home-brew
their own sake (sake, b.t.w., is technically a beer).  Here is the crude
process which I followed:
1) Combine two cups of cooked sweet-rice with two cups of water.
2) Place contents in a 1-quart mason jar.
3) Add one package of a chalky, unidentifiable powder recommended by an old
Chinese man. (Available at you local oriental market; presumably some sort
of       yeast culture.)
4) Seal lid on jar and place in the refrigerator.
5) Worry greatly about your personal safety when the lid starts to bulge
from    fermantation gases.


[Disclaimer:  due to the danger of explosion, I do not recommend that the
reader of this article attempt to re-create the above receipe unless you
enjoy glass shards in you neck.  This did not happened to me --- but unless
your mason jars are built and designed to ASME Boiler code, it is very
possible that the jars could explode.]


Regarding the home-brewed sake which I made following this gentlman's
directions: it _was_ fermented a liquid; it _did_ have an alcholol content;
it did _not_ taste even close to the commercial product (I liked it and I
drank it :)  Knowing what I now know about home-brewint, looking back on the
process it is easy to see why my home-brewed sake differed so drastically
from the sake available in stores.


I have not attemped to brew sake since and I am sorry that I do not have any
further information on the subject other than the above anecdote.


Good luck.

Subject: Re:Is it true that...


I posted to my curiosity about having been told: "Beer fermenting in a
carboy is warmer than the air outside due to the chemical reactions taking
place and the energy being produced within."  Felt compelled to share the
responses (which were suprisingly many).  The majority of the responses
suggested that there would be no significant temp difference, if any, and
suggested I get a thermometer strip to place on my carboy (which I will do)
[ Does this strip thermometer on the carboy measure temp of ambient air, the
glass of the carboy, the beer within the carboy, or all of the above????]
The remainder of the responses (though the minority),  thought a 5 degree
difference in temp within the carboy during fermentation was a very
reasonable assumption - several such opinions were from people who fermented
openly (and I dont mean fermented with joyous abandon, in the open so
everyone could see).  I must admit and emphasize that I am not particularly
concerned about whether a few degrees difference will "effect" my ales, I
was just curious about the notion after having been told this statement.
And whenever I get a question stuck in my head Im forced to seek the answer
(so I posed the question to encyclopedia brewtanica).  In reality, I guess
the answer doesnt matter.
If there are any brewers who use open fermentation and who have a brewsite
whose room temp  remains the same despite season and time of day, you could
test this if so inclined :^)  Thanks all

Subject: First Recipe Help 


Hi all.


We have been lurking for a while now but this is our first question to the
collective.


We are new to brewing, about 4 extract batches under our belt.  All of
these have turned out great.  We just tried our first recipe -- a scottish
ale.  We used 6lbs of british light DME, and some specialty malts as well.
We raised the temperature to 180 degrees very slowly to steep the specialty
malts.  We followed normal brewing procedures, but it took a long time to
get the wort to a boil, and then cooked it for 60 min.  The long and the
short of it is we lost a lot of water to evaporation and the O.G. seemed
very high at 1.065 and it was clearly no longer 5 gal of wort.  We added
enough water to bring the SG down to 1.046 and ended up with just about 5
gal of wort.  It has been fermenting like wild and just for fun we checked
the specific gravity and it was 1.012 and it tasted a little weak.
Furthermore, it is not done fermenting yet.


Our question is will the flavor get stronger, and if not is there anything
we can do to remedy the situation?


Thanks in advance for any help with this matter.

Subject: Enough about Jim Koch and his suits


I'm about to stop reading the HBD.  Why?  Because there seems to be a lot
of bandwidth wasted on back and forth about lawsuits brought by
microbreweries against otehr microbreweries.  Am I wrong, or is the the
Home Brew Digest and not the Micro Brew Digest?


I don't care for Jim Koch and his practices, but since he has no bearing on
my homebrewing, I don't see why he is being discussed.


The past actions of Wyeast, on the other hand, are perhaps suitable for
discussion here in HBD.  But since that has been hashed to death, what's
the point.


How about we all smile in an evil way and say, "Use a lawyer, go to hell."


Now back to HOMEbrewing.

Subject: Thermometers / Oven Temp


     In HBD 1908, rbarnes`at`sdccd.cc writes about discrepancies between a
floating type thermometer and a probe type.  The probe indicated higher
temperatures as it was inserted deeper into the wort.  One of my duties in
the Navy was to calibrate gages and thermometers, so maybe I can explain
what's happening.  First, I am assuming from the description that the
thermometer has a solid, straight probe and is not the alcohol/freon type.
 Inside the probe is a bimetallic strip that is attached either directly or
through a gear mechanism to the dial needle.  As the temperature changes, the
difference in the temperature coefficients of the two metals in the strip
cause it to deflect, and move the needle proportionately.  If the entire
length of the strip is not inserted below the surface of the fluid, the full
length will not deflect and it will read a lower temperature.  The probe
should have (at least the ones from the Navy had) a line scribed around the
circumference about 6 to 10 inches from the end.  This indicates the length
of the bimetallic strip and must always be submerged in the fluid to get an
accurate reading.  It is always a good idea to check the calibration of a
thermometer at least at the freezing and boiling points if these are within
its indicating range.  If these are OK, everything in between should be OK.
 Calibration screws are located on the dial face and/or back side of the
thermometer.  Some are not adjustable and might as well be thrown out if they
are out of calibration ; )
     As for maintaining a constant oven temperature for mashing,  the oven
thermostat senses air temperature.  The mash liquid has a much higher thermal
capacity than air and should remain at a relatively constant temperature even
though the surrounding air temperature fluctuates as the oven cycles on and
off.  A thermometer in the liquid is the best indicator.

I don't like to waste space on the Sam Adams thread but Pierre Jelenc had
a good point about the SAM ADAMS BOSTON LAGER, SAM HOUSTON AUSTIN LAGER,
SAM SMITH YORKSHIRE LAGER similarities and who should be touchy.  I
particularly like some of the Sam Smith brews but have on occasion
found found myself saying Sam Adams when I meant Sam Smith.
Besides, as a Texan I am particular offended by some clown in Boston
sueing some one in Texas for using the names of two of Texas' most
significant heroes (Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin).  They have
gone too far now! Remember the Alamo!

Subject: Stone-age  lagering


As  promised,  I've compiled all the suggestions  people sent me on how 
to lager  in a cold,  but  non-temperature controlled area.  Though  many 
of the suggestions are common sense, several are innovative or at  least 
important.


First, the  brain trust  says it's important  to know the place  you 
want  to  lager in.  How  much does the temperature change?  Are  there  
any drafts?  And if you're going to  work in an attic  like  I  plan to,  
make  sure  the floor is  strong enough to support all  the beer you  
plan to put there.


Second, use the right yeast.  Wyeast's Czech  Pilsner and  California 
Lager  were both  suggested.  In general,  people warned about any yeast  
which produces  diactyls.


Third, deal with temperature fluctuations in a  couple  of ways.   The 
easiest way is wrapping the fermenter  in blankets.   Many say  putting 
the carboy in a  trash can full of water is a  good idea, but if  
temperatures could get  below freezing ths  isn't such  a  good idea.  
One person suggested taking  a cotton  t-shirt  and  draping it over the 
carboy and setting the shirt in a pan  of water.   The idea is the  shirt 
will act as a  wick and  through  evaporation the carboy will keep 
cool....this seem's like a  great idea for folks  in areas warmer than 
upstate New York  where I  live. When considering  how to keep the  
carboy  cool,  remember cold basement walls,  drafts and other cold  
sources can  help you  keep your  beer  cool.


Well, that's all  the  wisdom  given by the  brain trust on  wild 
lagering.   Thank  you  all  for  your messages and I hope  this has  
helped some of  you lurking on the  HBD.


I guess  I  should get back to work...

I'm working on a similar problem.  I posted a similar question a few

equipment insulated, so I spoke to the guy who did that.  He suggested a
flameproof fabric that is used for welding curtains.  I thought it

and the heat won't go through.  He hasn't got back to me with details,

Here's a solution for you more frugal types.  I use a spray attachment for a
kitchen sink.  I got one for $5-6 at Wal-mart and cut the hose off.  I
attached it to the spigot of my bottling bucket (tight fit, required hot
water to stretch).  If I elevate my bottling bucket with the sparge water
high enough, I get a perfectly spread spray that in no way disturbs my grain
bed.  6-7 batches so far without a hitch!

I'm a relative newbie (several extract batches) who is thinking of moving up
to all-grain. There's one hitch, though: I have a stove with a "double oven",
i.e. there's a second oven over the rangetop -- this restricts the size of pot
I can use for boiling. The pot I've been using for my extract batches barely
fits, and it looks like there's NO WAY I'll be able to get a pot large enough
to boil 6 gallons of wort on there.


The question I have is this: Are there any potential problems with splitting
the boil into two smaller pots? Can't I just do two 3-gallon boils (in
parallel), and combine them when I transfer to my primary?

I doubt a decent plumber would tap a domestic, aluminum pressure cooker. The

The local WalMart has a pressure cooker for about $40.  In addition to the
usual weighted pressure relief vent, there's also a pressure gauge which is
screwed into a *tapped* hole in the lid.  Its made by either Mirro or Presto
and is fairly large (17 qts as I recall).

The copper pipe usually used for enclosing the heating element in a RIMS is
over $2/ft AND, around here, you've got to buy at least 20 feet!  The
fittings ain't cheap either.  Being a cheapskate, I used a 1 1/2" diameter x
12" long chrome plated brass slipjoint sink drain tailpiece.  It's the type
with a slight bell at one end which is fitted with a nut.  A 1/16" thick
brass washer was made and soldered to the belled, threaded end.  The heating
element, with a 1/16" red rubber gasket is placed thru the washer and the
gasket seated against the washer. The nut is screwed on over the element's
head thereby compressing the gasket between the nut and the head of the
element.  A bit of oil on the nut helps.  The other end of the tube was
capped with a disk of 1/16" brass which was soldered on.  3/8" copper inlet
tube was soldered into a hole in the brass disk and the outlet tube was
soldered to a hole drilled in the tailpiece close to the nut.  Haven't
mashed with this heater yet, but it's been run in RIMS mode for 3+ hours at
with pH 5.0 water `at` 150-170 degF.

Subject: NG Water Heater Element




     I am currently experimenting with a NG hot water heater burner
     for a "speed boiler" in my basement.  I acquired an old hot water
     heater from my friend, and removed the element. One wouldn't need to
     bring home a heater and tear it apart in order to experiment with one.
     The gas element comes off by unhooking a single fitting and sliding it
     out. I would assume that most brands of heaters would be the same way
     so one could replace the element if needed.  Just keep a crescent
     wrench in your vehicle and stop if you see an old heater on a curb!


     The gas dryer heater element was a good idea as well, but my friend
     didn't have one of those that I could tear apart!


     I am going to hook up the element in my basement under a range fume
     hood that is vented outside.  In the same room, I'm going to install a
     CO detector to be safe.  I am going to use two in-line valves to
     control the gas flow to the burner.  The only thing about this setup
     is that the burner will have to be supervised while in use.  Since I
     could not get the safety control to work, one must watch the flame to
     make sure it doesn't go out and fill the basement with gas fumes.  I
     will post my results later.


     I strongly suggest that anyone else experimenting with a gas burner
     in their home in any way other than it is originally intended should
     use a good fume hood and a CO detector.  A large purchased range hood
     or homemade one should work fine, but make sure it is vented outside!
     Cheap range hoods simply filter out particles of smoke and blow the
     air somewhere else in the house.  As for CO detectors, all will work
     but not all are practical for this use.  First alert and some others
     are excellent detectors, but they are not recommended in this case
     because everytime they are set off, they require a new $20.00
     cartridge.  This could get expensive at startup of a new idea.  I
     recommend the types that are resettable, so they can be used over and
     over without additional costs other than batteries.


     Please post any warnings, comments, or other any designs or ideas
     pertaining to gas burners on a future HBD.  I would leave an internet
     address, but I am sending this from work since I don't have access at
     home.  Our company's connection is terrible, and I don't always get my
     messages.  I would hate to miss anyone's response.

The bubbles are most likely the result of your wort approaching it's the
vapor pressure. That is, entrained gases coming out of suspension due to
reduced static pressure. The low pressure at the tap is caused by the siphon
created when you are running off. If you throttle your flow, then the air
will come out of suspension at the valve. I you don't throttle, the air will
come out somewhere else. Bottom line, the air is already there and the
presence of bubbles is no problem with regards to oxidation. -Dave

        For those who, like me, have not been impressed with

It is very full in body with a hint of its alcoholic strength,
yet as smooth and pleasurable as a good lager should be.
I'd prefer a little more hop aroma, and maybe a hint more
hop flavor, but all in all this is a terrific and affordable
lager IMHO.  Something to remember when your homebrew (gasp) RUNS OUT.

I am starting to get together equipment for a cheap microbrewery and 
consider secondhand bulk milk tanks to be a good start as fermenters.  
However, obviously they are designed for a different purpose so I am 
seeking information about people experience using them as fermentation 
vessels.


A typical example is around 130 imp gallons (~700 litres).  It's circular 
and shallow.  Has a gentle slope to the outlet and is jacketed and cooled 
with a glycol system.  There are many available in sizes ranging from 
100-300 gallons and bigger, I'm sure.  I can see several problems.  The 
slope is not nearly as steep as in cylindroconical fermenters and so I 
doubt if trub and yeast removal will be possible by simple turning on the 
tap.  Can anyone suggest an alternative short of racking 130 gallons 
(shudder), such as muck raking to the side with tap with a large 
sanitised muck scraper.
