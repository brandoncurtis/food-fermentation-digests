Subject: Mugwort information - for what it's worth


Thanks to all that responed to my post asking about mugwort. There are a couple 
of responses that I would like to include here in the HBD, especially for those 
who are brewing with it.

Mugwort is the common name of the plant Artemisia Vulgaris.  It is also
sometimes called California Mugwort.  Other common names include: Green
ginger, Fat hen, Gall wood, Grey bulwand, Docko, Old uncle harry,
Sailor's/poor man's tobacco, Smotherwood, and many variations on muggert,
and muggins. 


Sometimes it is called Felon herb.


The Irish know it as Muggert kail..which suggests use as a vegetable.


Europeans call it St John's herb, Mother of herbs, or Motherwort....it is
one of the sacred midsummer herbs, 


HISTORY; most medieval herbal books call this herb Motherwort,
       ie. herb for the womb. Mugwort is a Saxon name,
       refering either to flavouring beer or keeping off
       midges or moths. 


       The latin name for Mugwort is derived from Artemis who is also known as
Diana, the virgin moon goddess, the hunter. 


PLACES; Northern europe, possibly native in Canada and eastern USA.
        Wasteland, hedgerows and waysides on a variety
        of soils, but prefers it well drained and
        especially likes waysides.


CONSTITUENTS; bitter sesqueterpenes, essential oils include thujone,
        resin, flavonoids, tannins, inulin in its roots.


QUALITIES; a gentle aromatic bitter, warm and dry.


Mugwort is a relative of Absinth (Wormwood), Tarragon, and the Sagebrush
common to the American west.  It is known as the mildest member of this family.


I have been unable to acquire a photo or a drawing of this plant.  According to
one dictionary the plant has small greenish-yellow flowers.


You may have trouble BUYING this herb in the U.S.  Although anyone who knows
what it looks like can presumeably pick it on any roadside or field, it is a
medicinal herb that falls through the cracks in the USDA/FDA drug/food labeling
rules.  It is not an herb that is on the FDA's G.R.A.S. list (that is the list
of herbs Generally Recognized As Safe for human use.)  Benzoin which is also in
your recipie IS on the G.R.A.S. list as well as chamomile, dandelion, and
marshmallow.  So while Benzoin can be sold as food, mugwort cannot.  


Neither has mugwort been approved for sale as a drug due to the millions of
dollars and years if research required to have it approved by the FDA.


You may be able to find it sold somewhere as a "food additive." A label
which is used to loosely comply with FDA labeling requirements.

Mugwort is an artemisia (like tarragon) that has hallucinagenic (SP?) and 
euphoric alkaloids in it.  It is one of the two active ingredients in 
"classic" absinthe.  The other ingredient being wormwood, another 
artemisia with similar properties.  Hops are related distantly to 
marijuana, the lupilin and other alkaloids in it having euphoric, 
narcotic effects.  All of these alkaloids can be taken in through the 
nose, skin and lungs, so have a blast and have good dreams.  


One word of caution.  When any artemisia is fermented it has extreme 
liver and kidney destroying properties as well as being quite illegal.  
Also, when smoked, it oxidisescreates a chemical which will give you a buzz, but
also clog and destroy the aveoli of the lungs about 5 times faster than cigs or
marijuana, so just be careful with it.  The dream pillow (skin nose and lung
intake) seems to have no adverse effect, the skin having some way to filter out
most of the dangerous ingredients.  Also, the dream pillow is meant to be used
for a month or two, whereas drinking or smokoing it does it all at once, so the
body has time to deal with it.


Sorry if this all sounds condesending, but I live in an area where 
mugwort grows wild and I have seen too many people hear about it, go out 
and make absinthe and end up on dialisis at age 50 or hack their lungs 
out or get bronchitis on a permanent basis.

- -- [ From: Carrick Legrismith * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --


I am building a RIMS system and have read in the "Brewcraft, Ltd." catalog that
soldered joints can cause haze in finished beer.
Has anyone heard or experienced this before? What is the max wattage heating
element that I should run in it? I have found a temperature controler  in an
old microbiology incubator that should be able to handle 1000 watts on the high
end with some J. rigging , but will that be too much?

Subject: "diacetyl rest" - Noonan vs. Miller


I've been reading Greg Noonan's "Brewing Lager Beer" and noticed that his 
description of "diacetyl rest" is completely different than Dave Miller's in 
"The Complete Handbook of Home Brewing".


Miller writes:


   "One interesting features of most lager fermentations is that the beer is 
never racked until diacetyl is reduced below taste threshold...If necessary, 
the temperature is lowered to about 35 degrees F. for a 'diacetyl rest' of 2 
to 3 days after the fermentation is over. The idea behind the low temperature 
is to forestall autolysis.  Diacetyl reduction tends to lag behind 
fermentation." (page 158)


Noonan writes (about the SAME subject):


    "It is relatively common in modern fermentation cycles to raise the 
temperature of the post-kraeusen beer to 52 degrees F., and to hold that 
temperature for 2 to 7 days. This is the diacetyl rest.  It encourages 
oxidation of yeast-excreted acetohydroxy acids to vicinal diketones, and it 
reinvigorates the yeast culture so that it metabolizes diacetyl, thereby 
removing it from solution." (page 156) 


Will the real Diacetyl Rest please stand up! For all you chemist/brewers out 
there, who's correct and is this "rest" worth worrying about (or using in 
one's lager brewing process)?

Subject: Carbonation in bottles


Dear Friends, sorry to contribute to a long thread that, undoubtedly, 
many wish would die.  But I'll be brief ("yeah, right"--I can hear you 
all from here!).


Back when I used to prime bottles with dry sugar individually, in the 
first days after bottling I often observed the bubbles formed from 
the conditioning process rising through the beer (yes, I sat there 
and stared at my bottles of beer).  At first, the bubbles produced at 
the bottom (where the sugar was) would progressively shrink as they 
rose through the bottle, and would not reach the surface.  As days 
passed, they would get closer and closer to making it to the top, and 
then finally succeed.  This supports Dave Harsh's point in #1911 
about the CO2 bubbles being able to equilibrate with the beer.


However, in batch-primed beer there is not this non-uniform 
distribution--the sugar is mixed in to the beer.  So initially-formed 
CO2 does not necessarily have to travel the length of the bottle.  
Don't know whether this observation can help decide whether Dave 
Miller's contentious idea is right; my intuition says he must be 
mistaken.


Cheers, Dave in Sydney

Subject: Last minute Xmas Ale; BFC 1.3


I've got a Kolsch (turned out a bit too dark, actually, due to my homebrew
shop selling me so-called 10 deg L crystal that I am now convinced was
really a lot darker, maybe 40 deg L) in the secondary, almost ready to
bottle.  I'm wondering if I can turn it into a last-minute Xmas Ale by just
simmering some spices in hot water to make a strong spice tea and adding
this to the secondary a few days before bottling.  Suggestions?
Experience?


Also, Greg Douhan <gdouhan`at`wsunix.wsu.edu> asked:


>        Has anybody out there used THE BEER FORMULA CALCULATOR 1.3 by
>Carlo Fusco.


Yes, I've used Beer Formula Calculator 1.3 for the past half dozen or so
batches, and I find it very useful for maintaining consistency across brews
and for calculating exactly how to change things like IBUs and deg's
Loviblond.  However, it doesn't have fields for entering mashing info -
temperatures, times, how much water added, etc. - but it would be easy to
add this yourself, since there's no calculations involved, just recording
the numbers.  One thing that I found out by e-mailing Fusco (& he's good
about responding) - the gallons are U.S. gallons, not Imperial.  There is a
new version available, 2.0, that is metric and provides conversion from
U.S. measures.  It also has some nifty new fields and calculations, but
still nothing for the mashing info.  Both versions are available at
<ftp://ftp.stanford.edu/pub/clubs/homebrew/beer/programs/>.

Thanks Tim, I'll try it!


Two questions:


Can anyone transform this formula to be used with the Celcius scale?


Is your hydrometer calibrated at 15.6 degrees C or at 20 degrees C
(whatever that is in F)? I think that would be neccesary to know.

Subject:  Re: Oak Chips in IPA -  and wooden barrels in general




I have to disagree with the statement that european white oak imparts
no flavor. French white oak barrels are widely used to hold wine, and
a premium price, on the order of $500 per barrel is paid for these
specifically because of the vanilla flavors and tannins they add.
American white oak is also widely used and prized for a similar flavor
profile.  Red oak is never used for barrels simply because the pore
size of the wood is so large that evaporation is a serious problem.
If you've ever been around a red oak tree being cut down you will
realize from the pungent smell alone that red oak is VERY tannic.


Wine barrels have their interior charred by open flames before they
are used.  Interestingly bourbon is made with hard maple charcoal and
oak barrel aging, and one of the two clearly produces a strong
vanilla note. I don't know anything about the historical processing of
barrels for IPAs but it is clearly possible that their interiors were
charred before use. Incidentally 'Malting and Brewing Science'
discusses charcoal as an effective fining agent for beers.  Perhaps
the wood chips should be toasted before use.  Anyone interested in
experimenting ?

How much warmer will depend on the activity in the wort.  I would
put it at 3 - 8 deg F depending on the level of activity
(empirical measurements made during brewing).  If you're relying on
this to keep the wort at a suitable fermentation temperature,
remember that it will occur only *after* the fermentation has
become vigorous; i.e., don't expect an ale yeast that goes dormant
at 60 deg F to *ever* begin fermentation in a wort of that
temperature, although the activity in the wort may *maintain* a
higher temperature if the ambient temperature after fermentation
starts.

"Kvass" ("kwass" is some ignorant West European's
mistransliteration, possibly via German -- German "w" is
pronounced like English "v:) is a traditional Russian beer, made
from rye or barley.  The rye-bread mutation is a traditional prison
variation, since lifers find it difficult to get quality malts.


The name of "kvass" for a fermented mare's-milk beverage is
probably some ignorant West European's confusion between the two. 
The milk beverage is called "kumiss" (from Turkish *kumyz*).


I've told that kumiss tastes like a light ale, and that kvass is
vile.  I've never had either.

It's my experience that using a frozen glass for anything but a low-flavor
light-bodied lawnmower beer is detrimental to the flavors that I've tried
hard to produce. I've heard the phenomenum referred to as "Shocking" the
beer.  Granted, I don't really know how the beer feels about it, but I was
indeed shocked at what happened to a stout that I treated this way awhile
back.  Still drank it though.

I was briefly in conversation with a surgeon at a party last night and home
brewing was raised as a topic of conversation.  He asked me if I ever used
sodium metabisulphite (SM) because he needed the business.  It appears
there are some thoughts in the medical profession that regular contact with
SM can  build up a reaction in the (human) body, leading to asthma, nasal

Ray's right on the mark!  Every pump has a spec. known as required NPSH (net
positive suction head, measured in psiA). Never seen this dataum published
for the smallish pumps used with RIMSs. If the pressure at the suction inlet
falls below the required NPSH, cavitation will occur and the pump
performance will decrease.  In severe cases, it sounds like gravel going
through the pump.  (The noise is from the collapse of the steam bubbles as
they enter a higher pressure region in the pump.)  I've witnessed not so
severe cases on large pump installations where there was no untoward noise,
but cavitation was occurring as evidenced by poor pump performance and
pitted impellers.  NPSH required also varies with temperature- my RIMS did
OK at 130 degF, but, at 160 there was audible cavitation. Raising the tun
(increasing the static pressure) solved the problem.  Other design
alternatives are to reduce the friction loss in the suction piping and/or
reducing the flow.  More pump poop for RIMSers:


Arrange the pump and piping so that there's no air pockets or install a
valve at the high point in the suction line to bleed the air.  Air in the
piping reduces flow.  It's particuliarly bad to have air in the pump casing.
My RIMS pump (and end-suction type) is mounted vertically with the suction
inlet up for this reason.  HSA is, perhaps, another consideration.


Try to have at least 10 pipe diameters of straight piping directly in front
of the pump suction inlet.


Throttling valves go on the discharge side of the pump.  If a shutoff valve
is needed in the suction line use one that doesn't increase turbulence and
friction loss (e.g. a ball valve).

For those of U looking for insulation for Mashing equipment.
There is a product available from A/C and Refrigeration suppliers.
It is a foam insulation available in sheets 3'x5' in 1/2" and 3/4"
thick versions. I use it around my mash vessels. It is easily cut with 
a utility knife and will adapt to any shape. I hold them on with ace
bandages which makes them quit easy to remove.
If used on a vessel that is direct fired a shield must be used because
it is falmable. One of the manufactures is Armaflex and is quit often
refered to as Armaflex by tradesmen. Not sure what the R value is.

I'd avoid reaerating at this point, but rather would add strongly fermenting

you add a strong kreusen (big starter a high kreusen should work), the yeast
should be vigorous and should hlp the fermentation finish.

I can understand why a long length of small-diameter hose will provide a

find great piles of used appliances of many types waiting to be loaded into

kitchens get the old heave ho.  Generally speaking people decide that their
appliances are completely dead and need replacement because some $5 part
burns out.
   Now go scrounge around.  You might be well advised to ask inside the store

Subject: Hops Toxicity in Dogs


        Greetings fellow brewers:


        At the risk of starting another mercury/aluminum/chlorine toxicity 
flame war, I feel the need to pass on some information to those of you 
brewers who own dogs.


        According to National Animal Poison Control Center at the University 
of Illinois, Urbana, there have been eight reported cases of hops toxicity in 
dogs.  Apparently, ingestion of hops results in malignant hyperthermia--an 
uncontrollable fever.  The first symptom to become apparent to an owner is 
heavy panting.  Rapid heart rate will also be present, up to 200 beats per 
minute.  The dog's body temperature may rise as quickly as 2 degrees F every 
five minutes.


        Hops toxicity in dogs has only come to light within the past twelve 
months (apparently due to the increasing popularity of homebrewing).  The 
evidence so far indicates that Greyhounds are most at risk (7 of the 8 
reported deaths were Greyhounds), but a Labrador Retriever cross also died 
from hops ingestion.   If anyone needs additional information, the number of 
the NAPCC is (800) 548-2423.  I am not on expert on this subject but recently 
read an article about the problem in one of my dog magazines.

My guess would be that the lagers contains more CO2 because they are at a 
lower temperature, hence, higher gas solubility.

A question to the Encyclopedia Brewtannica:  Is there a difference between 
"saturated with CO2" and "carbonated"?  I would have guessed that the 
former is the definition of the latter.

The Crabtree effect is exemplified by the fact that the availability of
glucose inhibits respiration, even in the presence of excess O2. The point
is, the inhibition of respiration is the result, not necessarily the
inhibition of yeast budding. In fact, there is also another effect known as
the reverse-Pasteur effect. In this case, increasing dissolved O2 causes an
increase in fermentation rate and yeast budding. The point here is that
yeast can and do grow (reproduce) in the presence of glucose, particularly
if O2 is available, but respiration does not occur in the presence of
glucose. I hope this isn't being too picky.

How y'all?
Got a question for you on converting a swimming pool filter canister to a
brew pot.  The canister is approx. 20" across.  Once the hole in the bottom
is capped, the thing will be able to boil ten gallons with plenty of
"freeboard".  When 5-6 gallons is added to the pot, the depth of the liquid
is only a couple of inches.  Will this cause any problems when doing my usual
5 gallon batches.  Or do I need to go to 10 gallon batches?  :-{ )
  Increased evaporation is one that comes to mind.  Anyone out there have any
experience with these things?? Private email is fine and I will post a

Subject: lagers/braggots


Got a couple questions for y'all;


     I'm working on my second lager and am just curious if it's going like
it should.  After pitching my yeast (Wyeast 2038), I let it sit for 24 hours
at 60 deg, then transferred to the fridge at 46 deg.  One week later I still
have >1/4" of krausen and it's still fermenting happily away.  Now I'm not
complaining, mind you, but I've been led to believe that this much activity
is not expected from a lager at these temps.  My only other attempt was
using the insulated box trick and I couldn't see what was happening.  Just
wondering if this is normal or if I have SuperYeast trapped in a carboy.


     I have also made an attempt at Braggot.  I have very little information
in my available reference books.  I've never tasted one nor known anyone who
has actually made one, so I'm kind of brewing blindly on this.  I used a
pound of Brewer's Gold DME and a pound of clover honey, boiled 15 minutes in
2 liters of water and pitched onto some Wyeast 1056, topping it off to make
a full gallon.  I really have no preconceived expectations on how it should
taste, but I did taste my hydrometer sample and I have some pretty high
hopes for this.  Is this normally carbonated or just a still beverage?
Anybody have any comparisons to what my end product should taste like?  I
think it's going to be pretty good, but with my lack of information on the
subject I'd just like a little extra information from someone who actually
knows.


     One last thing.  Since I switched to all grain about a year and a half
ago, I have seen many references to recirculating the mash runnings until
they are clear.  Is this refering to the wort having no husks or grain
particles flowing through, or does it refer to the wort itself being clear
rather than cloudy?  I have tried recirculating my wort for WAY too long to
acheive clearness in my runnoff, but have never succeeded in that.  It's
always cloudy no matter what I do, so then I'm thinking maybe the reference
is to husks and grain parts.  Could someone please enlighten me on this?
Sorry if it's obvious to everyone else, but I've never decided which is
correct.  


     Thanks for all the help.  I must admit since I've been reading the HBD
my beer has gone from just OK to VERY good!

A question to the Steam Fired Collective...


We are in the process of buying a new house with a steam heat
system in it, and on Saturday during the home inspection I was
measuring the space for my brewery and happened to look at the
steam boiler - a 200 K Btu/hr system with all the protective
stuff, water feed, pressure blow off, and vented combustion
path. This baby has all the stuff on it I'd need to convert to
steam feed mash and boil kettles. Has anyone out there ever
tapped into a steam heat system for their brewery?


Out of the boiler is a verticle 2' , 4" dia pipe that I could
install a T onto with 2 flow control valves, one for the house
and another for the brewery. then I'd need a flow control valve
on the gas line to be able to back off on the heat for a steady
boil. Controls would be manual for gas flow, and steam to the
house / kettles. Other than the cost of the piping and valves does
anyone see any problems with this? 


Comments and experiences are welcomed...
