Subject: Fermentation that won't stop, Inlaws.


About five weeks ago, I started a batch of ale that involves 5.5 pounds of 
light malt extract, half a pound of 40L crystal malt, the usual boiling hops 
and 1 oz Saaz for dry hopping in the secondary.  Active fermentation in the 
primary lasted two and half days and after a week I placed the Saaz and the 
beer in the secondary.  The secondary sat in my basement (temp 60 F) for a 
week.  At that point I decided to bottle it, so I brought it upstairs (temp 
70 F).  Within a couple hours the fermentation lock was bubbling quite 
vigorously.  Two weeks later, the bubbles are still coming about 1 every one 
to two minutes.  The beer looks fine and relatively clear, smells ok.  The 
hops are all floating at the top, and seem to be where the bubbles are 
forming. Can anyone tell me what this means.  Could it be an infection??


On another note, my inlaws are folks who appreciate a good beer, mostly 
english beers, however, they refuse to drink my homebrew, which is usually a 
stout or an ale.  In fact, when I offer one of them a homebrew, they often 
respond "Oh no, I am not drinking that stuff, you know how that homebrew is." 
 They even prefer a Bud or Millers to my homebrew (what an insult!!).  Now I 
know my homebrew is good because many others have told me so, and it is 
always in demand when friends come over.  Anyone else experience this strange 
behavior in family or friends?

Someone brought a homebrewed Kvass to a brewing club meeting this past summer.
I forget if Al K. or anyone else on the list was there, but I can provide some
sketchy details.


First, the stuff was delicious.  Citrusy, very yeasty, refreshing and light.
About 1.6% alcohol, if memory is served well, which it often isn't here.  
But definately low in alcohol.  It was very light in color and cloudy.  It was
a Russian recipe if I recall, but was like a Lithuanian recipe that a friend
of mine related to me.  (Not Al, a diff't Lith'.)  Also, it had been brewed
about two days before it was served, which is apparently the way it's supposed
to be done.  


If someone, myself included, can scratch up a good Kvass recipe, I think it
would be a "quality" move to post it here.  I'd like to try it once in awhile
for fun, maybe a one gallon knock-off batch here and there.

Last night, my SO was making Xmas cookies, and needed some frosting made.  
I grab a recipe, and realize we have no confectioner's sugar.  Rather than
make the 2 block trek to the local "convenience" store, I decided to try 
using brewer's corn sugar instead.  


Results:  We ended up going to the store to get some confectioner's sugar.
The stuff was painfully sweet, burned the throat a bit if you ate more than
a nibble, and the texture, well, it just wasn't quite right.  (Possibly because
corn sugar has less trapped moisture?  Just a guess, from the difficulty in 
making it.)  


I know, I'm a hopeless beer geek - I saved both batches of frosting, and I
intend to frost a couple cookies and do a side-by-side blind comparison.

     I am unfamiliar with Blue Moon.  I am told that Celis White is the 
     defining beer for this style.  It's brewed in Austin, TX at Pierre 
     Celis's (a reknowned brewer transplanted from Belgium) microbrewery.  
     The special flavor is achieved with Curacao orange peel and coriander. 
     There is a WYEAST variety, namely 3944 (Belgium White).  BTW, this is 
     a wheat beer.  My homebrew supply shop of choice (Austin Homebrew 
     Supply - (800)890-BREW) offers an extract-based recipe w/ all the 
     ingredients for a 5 gal batch incl the liquid yeast for about $19, but 
     I've never tried it.  I've seen recipes on the net for the same, but I 
     never saved them.  A friend of mine who supplies me with most of my 
     bottles drinks almost exclusively Celis White and Celis Grand Cru.  
     One of these days I will reward him with a homebrewed batch.  I'll let 
     you know how it turns out.

To Karen Barela and James Spence,


Bob Paolino made some recent comments on the Judgenet
Digest which ring true for myself.  These comments are
regarding the new judging scoresheet which appeared in
the most recent issue of ZYMURGY.  There is no meaningful
way for the judge to describe his or her credentials.  
All references to judge ranking has been omitted.  A judge
would describe him/herself as "Experienced/Novice/Other"  


>Is the AHA simply refusing to acknowledge the existence 
>of the independent BJCP?  If so, that seems just a little 
>bit petty.  Even if they want to pretend that there is no 
>judge certification program out there, why don't

>the brewer. 


Though some persons may be, The BJCP is not anti
AHA, and many, if not most, members want to participate 
in the National Competition as an entrant, a judge or both.
Entrants seek meaningful feedback on their  beers from
qualified judges.  As an entrant, I am very interested in
the qualifications of the judges who evaluate my beers.
I simply can't understand your motives in apparently
denying the existence of the BJCP.  Can't we all play
together and enjoy our mutual endeavor for what it is,
a pleasurable hobby, at the same time acknowledging
and respecting the positive contributions each of us has 
to offer.

Allergies to sulfites are reasonably common, although the symptoms vary
considerably.  American wines are now required to carry a notice on the 
label if sulfites were used in their production (quite common with wines,
and pretty pointless with beer).  


Here in Oregon, a girl died a few years ago in an acute allergic reaction
to the sulfites she received at (as I recall) the salad bar in a restaurant;
someone had gotten carried away or someone had forgotten to wash something.

It's not a bacteria, it's a fungus (aspergillus -- koji) used to break
down the starch so that the yeast can ferment the resulting sugar.  It
works the same way, in a sense, that the naturally-occurring enzymes in
malt do.

"John McCafferty" <johnm`at`giant.IntraNet.com> asks:


>Any linquists out there?  How about anyone from Germany? I'm wondering

The umlauted "o" (o with two dots over it; one can also write it as
"oe") is, unfortunately, one of those furrin sounds that just
doesn't exist in Standard English.  "E" as in "er", and "oy" are
both equally good (or bad) approximations.  (I'll qualify this by
saying that one of my German-speaking friends tells me that I have
the worst Plattdeutsch accent that she's ever heard -- not too
suprising, given my ancestry).


The "sch" trigraph is pronounced as English "sh"; the "ch"
digraph, when *not* preceeded by "s", is a velar fricative, another
non-English sound.  Form your mouth as for "k", but exhale
smoothly.  English speakers generally approximate this sound as
"k" (like "Bach", nicht wahr?).

I'd go with Noonan on this one, although I generally limit a diacetyl rest
to yeast strains which have been shown to need one (eg. 308). I typically
rest at about 60F for less than 48 hours (including ramp time) after the 1/3
gravity point.

Subject: kvass and IPA


        As several persons have noted, kvass is made from rye, 
while kumys or kumiss is made from fermented mare's milk.  John 
Braue, though, is incorrect in suggesting in HBD #1913 that the 
making kvass from rye bread is a prison varient.  It's actually 
the most common way to make kvass: soak dry, toasted rye bread in 
water with sugar and lemon (if possible), let ferment slightly 
and drink while still fermenting.  I've also had it made from rye 
flour.  Prepared properly, it's tart, effervesent, and quite 
refreshing, especially after a hard morning spent planting 
potatoes.  It's the base of several traditional Russian soups.
         Commercially-prepared kvass was considerably sweeter, 
rather insipid, and almost flat.  It was traditionally served 
direct from large tanker trailers.  The saleswoman had three 
mugs, usually, which she would take back from customers and rinse 
in a pail of filthy water before serving her next customer.  
Before perestroika, this was the most common way of selling beer 
as well, though by 1990 these mugs were in short supply, and beer 
drinkers generally brought their own containers.  I well remember 
standing with a couple of strangers draining a three-liter jar of 
beer outside a kiosk in Moscow in early '91.
        Alas, kvass production is now down something like 98% in 
Russia: Russians prefer western soft drinks.


        Steve Alexander writes about wine and oak.  It is true 
that wine is stored in oak barrels to extract the flavors and 
tannins they hold.  It is also true, though, that wine strips the 
wood of these flavors, and after several seasons barrels are 
either shaved to expose a new layer of wood or are discarded. 
This means that beer stored in the wood does not need to develop 
the flavors associated with oak, even if the barrel or cask is 
not lined.  
        Also, the oak used in making wine barrels is chosen, at 
least in part, for the flavor it imparts.  It might well be the 
case that French oak barrels command high prices *because* they 
give flavor that other European oak does not.  Coopers making 
beer casks would, I imagine, choose oak that didn't impart 
flavor.  That's why traditionally-made Czech pilsners, fermented 
in unlined Slovenian oak fermenters, have no oak taste to them.
        I've been searching old American brewing texts and can 
find no reference to aging in oak for the oak taste in strong 
ales before prohibition.  It makes me think that Ballentine came 
up with this idea on their own for their IPA, perhaps using a oak 
taste to replace the brettanomyces character that strong old ales 
had before prohibition.  This is just guessing, though.  Has 
anyone found any evidence one way or the other?
        Far be it from me to discourage brewing experiments.  
I'm far too enamoured of strange adjuncts to want to do that. 
(Tapioca bitter, anyone?)  But let's not imagine that an IPA 
requires any sort of oak taste.

Subject: Sparging and Aeration


Hail the HBD,


Finally caught up on the HBDs.  School always seems to get in the way ;-). 
I have a few questions that I haven't found satisfactory answers which you'll
find pretty easy I'm sure.


There have been a number of posts lately on sparging setups.  It appears
that a popular way of delivering the sparge water is through the use of a
rotating sparge arm.  Some brewers just adjust the flow rate of the water
going in to match the flow rate of the wort coming out.  


Most brewers seem to try to keep the sparge water about an inch above the
grain bed.  Why is this the case?  


If capacity is not an issue, why not fill the mash/lautter tun with all of the
sparge water as a batch and control the flow rate leaving the tun?  


Does using a rotating sparge arm (or splashing the sparge water in general)
introduce unwanted oxygen into the mash or is HSA only a problem after
the mash?


I preboil all of my brewing water the night before brewday.  By boiling, will
this reduce the amount of oxygen in the brewing water or will it reabsorb all
the oxygen as it cools?


TIA and Merry Christmas

Subject: Oatmeal-Wheat Stout


I recently brewed an Oatmeal-Wheat Stout (all-grain).  The recipe is 
adapted from Papazians "Barrel of Monkeys Oatmeal-Wheat Stout" 
(_The Home Brewer's Companion_), with some changes to the grain bill,  
hop types and mashing schedule.  Here's the recipe:


Grains:
    5 lbs British Pale malt
    2 lbs Wheat malt
    1 lb medium british crystal
    1 lb Quaker Rolled (Minute) oats
    1 lb roasted barley


Hops:
    1 oz Chinook (12 HBU) 75 minutes
    .5 oz Goldings (2.5 hbu) 30 mins
    .5 oz Goldings Steeped at end of boil


Yeast:
    Wyeast London ESB 1968 in 1 quart (liter, actually) starter.


Irish moss added at final 15 minutes of boil.  Total boil was 75 
minutes.


Mashing was done in my 8 gallon enamel canning pot with an EasyMasher 
(tm) installed.  Which reminds me:  anyone know how to extend the life of 
these pots once the enamel starts to go?  Or is the purchase of a large 
stainless pot just plain inevitable?


Doughed in with 2.5 gals water (which frankly seemed a bit low,  and 
made for a really thick mash) and rested at 104 F. for 20 mins.


Protein rest at 124F. for 20 mins. to ungum the gummies.


Starch conversion at `at` 155F. for 1 hour.


Mash out at 168F. for 15 minutes.


Begin sparge from hell.   Ran off and recirculated a little less than 1 
quart before the runnings ran clear.  Of course,  it's pretty d*mn hard 
to tell when the runnings from a stout wort are "clear",  so I was 
pretty much guessing.  My sparge,  when it finally began,  was a mere 
trickle,  even with the EasyMasher spigot wide open.  I forget exactly 
what I figured as the rate of outflow,  but I believe that my 
calculations indicated that I would have 6 gallons of wort collected 
just prior to Easter Sunday.


I tried everything to alleviate the problem,  including blowing gently 
into spigot to clear the screen (watch those lips!) as suggested in the 
EasyMasher instructions.  Finally (duh!) I just reheated everything to 
168F.,  including the sparge water that had been already added,  gave 
it 10 minutes for the filter bed to settle,  recirculated again and 
tried again.  Things went fine after that.  The short recirculation 
time for the EasyMasher seemed to be a real advantage in this 
situation.


I am guessing that the stuck sparge was due to a combination of the 
following:


1)        Gummy grains.
2)      I think think the mash was really a bit thick.  For the first
        time,  I got some scorching on the kettle bottom.   Maybe 3 - 
        3.5 galls of water next time?
3)      I don't think I gave the mash much time to settle prior to 
        starting the sparge. 


Any comments?   Is my beer ruined?  (Only kidding -- I just HADDA ask).


The remainder of the brewing session went like clockwork -- until I 
dropped that 5 gallon glass carboy filled to the brim with bleach water 
(gosh,  but those things are a LOT thinner-walled than they look ...).  
While the resulting semi-explosion of glass shards,  bleach solution,  
and blood from my newly opened wrist was indeed a spectacular sight,  
neveretheless I must caution readers to refrain from trying this at 
home (even under adult supervision,  really).  Appearances aside,  no 
major arteries appeared severed;  the trip to the emergency room could 
wait until after pitching,  and I had a spare carboy.


My stout now sits happily conditioning in the secondary.  My wrist has 
almost healed completely.  I got a new carboy.  


Extract brewing was NEVER this fun.

Recently after reading "Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide" cover-to-cover, I 
ended a 25 yr hiatus and began brewing again.  I'm working on Greg Noonan's 
_Brewing Lager Beer_ now.  Been following the HB Digest for almost a month 
and have learned a lot from you guys.
 
When I first started, brewing was an illegal Black Art.  The hassle of 
bottling caused me to quit.  I considered kegs but 1/4 kegs were too big 
and too expensive.  When I recently found out that homebrewers have been 
using soda kegs for quit some time, I began investigating.  I was pleasantly
amazed at the wealth of good, scientifically oriented information available 
to homebrewers.  Changed up by reading Homebrewing Guide I made the plunge
purchased a soda keg system and brewed my first batch in 25 year.  The beer
was better than any I had previously made. 
 
Now that I'm hooked, I can see that I will be needing more than the two
kegs I have now.  Do any of you know of a source local to the Baltimore-
Washington,DC area where I can get soda kegs for less than the $40.00
changed by my local HB shop?  I've seen some mail order kegs for $30, but 
shipping makes the price equal to the local shop.
 
Thanks, Lynn.

Seasons Greetings to All !


I have a question of the collective regarding how you all store your bulk 
malt extracts.  I would like to buy extract in bulk but have concerns about 
storage.  One thought is to utilise the freezer section of my newly acquired 
beer fridge and freeze the extract in 'brew size' portions.  Is there any 
advantage/disavantage to freexing extract?  Is it neccessary ?.  Is boiling 
the extract for 60min as in a normal brewing session enought to kill any 
nasties acquired during storage in a half empty pail ?


All responses appreciated.

I have been splitting my boils since I started...not into two parallel boils
but into two sequential boils (one pot big enough for about 3-3 1/2
gallons).  I do five gallon batches by preboiling 2 gallons of water,
transferring the 2 gallons to the fermenter, and boiling 3 gallons of water
with the ingredients.  I have had no problems so far.


I would recommend splitting the boil into unequal portions and putting all
the ingredients in the boil having the larger amount of liquid.  I say this
mainly because that is what I have always done, I don't know if equal boils
and splitting the ingredients would work better.  The larger amount of
liquid may hold the ingredients better, and you only need to boil the
water-only portion for about 5-10 mins...just to kill what might be living
in it.  Using this method, I have always acheived roughly the expected
original gravities and have gotten great beers.  Also, because the
water-only boil is so short the serial boiling method really doesn't take
all that much longer than a single boil would.

Subject: Re: Sake


There's been several posts regarding Sake recently, and while I've never
brewed it (too much trouble) I am familiar with the process. Here's what I know:


1. Sake is indeed a beer, because it's made from grain rather than a wine
made from fruit.
2. It is fermented using Cervisae Saccromyces (sp?) i.e. ALE YEAST
3. Saccarification is carried out _simultaneously_ with fermentation by
Oryzae Aspergillis (a fungi) called koji in Japanese.
4. The mash undergoes several long (2-3 day) temperature rests during which
more rice-water mix is added.
5. The rice is gelatinized by cooking before addition to the mash.


Like the German Reinheitgebot purity law, the Japanese have a law declaring
that only rice, water, koji, and yeast can go into Sake.


There are many grades of Sake ranging from the oldest, clearest to the
youngest unfiltered Sake.

book on the subject.

Subject: Diacetyl/SG Correctio/Yeast Heat


In #1913 Sharon Ritter asks about diacetyl rests:
Noonan is right. The temperature is raised (up to 50-60F) to increase the
activity level of the yeast just before they begin to flocculate. This
increased metabolic rate allows them to reabsorb VDKs relatively quickly
(i.e. it would proably happen in lagering as well but take forever) and
oxidize them to high flavor threshold diols before they (the yeast)
flocculate and settle out. Another approach is to add some kraeusen beer
whose numerous, vigorous yeast will do the same job.




Robert Bush asked about conversion of the SG correction formula to Centigrade:


0.00045*( 23.9 - C) + Hydrometer reading


John Brau commented that heat isn't evolved until the fermentation has
become vigorous. An experiment I did this weekend indicates the contrary. I
was trying to see how fast yeast grow if kept oxygenated for extended
periods. I innoculated a litre of air saturated 6.6 P wort in a 2L
Erlenmyer with about 4E6 cells/ml (Wyeast Czech Pils) and put it on a
stirrer. The wort was at 18C when I started and the room air at 21 C.
Within an hour the wort temperature was up to 21C which didn't surprise me
at all but at the end of the second hour it was up to 24C (cell count now
6E6/ml) and rising. At the end of the 3rd hour it was 26C and at the end of
the fourth 27C (cell count 11E6/ml). For the remainder of the experiment
the temperature hovered around 27C peaking at 27.7 i.e. about 6C above the
ambient. I expected some heat to be evolved but certainly not enough to
raise the temperature appreciably especially in a container with such a
high surface to volume ratio.
Conclusion: a fair amount of heat is produced by yeast during their growth
phase.


By the way, the cell count got up to 32E6/ml by the end of the 7th hour at
which time the investigator toddled off to bed.

Subject: Euro-kegs/diacetyl rests


Keith relates a story about European 50L kegs not being returned to
the brewer:


<Does anyone 
<have any thoughts or comments on this?  Do many of the imported kegs 
<really get trashed, thus making it legal for homebrewers to buy them from 
<these beer stores?


If the kegs are being trashed then the distributer/importer is not doing
their job (or the retailer is ignoring their responsibility).  A 50L keg
typically costs $80-$120 and no brewer anywhere in the world can survive
if this asset is consistently lost.  Id also like to remind all beer drinkers
to return empty kegs promptly.  We have all seen or done it, had a party
and drained several kegs only to let the empties sit for weeks or months.
I knew on guy who would have an annual bash and keep the empty till next
years bash!  This is not too big a deal for AB but most micros, especially
new ones need those kegs soon.  As someone involved in a new micro I know
the cost of kegs and the financial burden it is on a tight budget.


Dan and Jim talk about diacetyl rests:


>Will the real Diacetyl Rest please stand up!


<I don't own and have not read Miller's book, but all of the other literature
<I've read on this topic suggests that warm temperatures at the end of
<fermentation increases yeast activity and encourages the reduction of diacetyl,
<just as Noonan describes. Frankly, I don't understand Miller's position on
<this at all. Chilling the beer to 35F as he suggests will drop the yeast out
<of suspension, which would tend to *inhibit* the reduction of diacetyl.


Miller is not totally offbase with his suggestion although I think he is
on the low side of the temp range.  There are two common methods of doing
a diacetyl rest, one allows the temp to rise at the end of primary 
fermentation, often in the 55-62F range.  The other method is to rest a 
couple of days around 42F after primary.  In the first case a brewer can
ferment 7-9 days at 45-50F and as the terminal gravity approaches (I
would guess 10-20% from final gravity) the attemperation on the tank
is reduced or shutoff to gradually allow the temp to climb to the high 50s
or low 60s F.  This will fairly rapidly reduce diacetyl.  The beer is 
then lagered at 31F for 4 weeks (or less) and packaged.   Other brewers,
no doubt ones that have the time to do traditional lagering and use a
yeast that does not throw excessive amounts of diacetyl, use the rest
at 42F for 2-3 days as a reduction prior to lagering at 31F for 4-6 
weeks or more.  


As Jim notes, a clean yeast like 34/70 is a good candidate for the 42F
rest (or none), especially if one has the tank space and time to lager
6 weeks.  For brewers who want to push lagers out faster the elevated
temps at the conclusion of primary will lead to reduced lagering times
with similar results.  


Good brewing,

Bob,


What you have is known as chill haze.  What Papazian says from the TNCJHB is:




        "Some batches of beer that you will make may be perfectly clear at
first but will later develp a haze when chilled in the refrigerator.  This
"chill hate" is nothing to get ancious about.  It is mostly a visual
phenomenon and will not greatly affect the flavor.
        Chill haze is a result of a combining reaction between proteins and
tannins.  At room temperature it is souble and remains invisible.  At
cooler temperature it is no longer soluble and will precipitate as a haze.
        Chill haze can be minimized by controlling the malting and mashing
process more closely, but at the same time this control results in the
sacrifice of other aspects that the brewer wishes to achieve.  It's often a
trade-off.
        If the chill haze really annoys you, I could recommend that you
drink out of a stone jar, or wooden mug, but that would be facetious, so I
won't.  Following are some additives that can be introduced into your brew
to help eliminate chill haze."


<Pgs 102 and 103 from the New Complete Joy of Home Brewing.>


        Mr. P. goes on to talk about using various ingrediants such as
Papain (the active ingrediant in meat tenderizer), PVP (which is actually a
kind of plastic), and Activated Silica Gel (which apparently isn't
available to home brewers, the commercial breweries use it though).
        I've had plenty of batches with chill haze.  It doesn't really
bother me so long as the beer is yummy.


        Cheers!

Sounds like chill haze. When making the beer, try adding Irish Moss to the
wort in the final 5-10 min of boil.

45F? At all times of the year? If so, do you live in a very cold climate? I
would like to try lagering w/o a fridge - but in this part of New York State
(about 30 mi north of New York City), my basement stays ~65F March-November
and ~55F December-February with some consistency. My garage, built into the
house at basement level but having one wall consisting of garage doors, does
not remain as consistent, but ranges above freezing in the winter months and
~10-15F below the outside temp in the summer months. I too am thinking about
lagering, but if I dont use a fridge, I'm somewhat limited to a particular
time of year. BTW, I did use a fridge to lager a cream ale - it turned out
great but really increased by electric bill those months (the fridge was an
extra to my regular one that holds such unessentials as milk, eggs, meat and
vegetables ;-)

system (a copper racking tube connected directly to the chiller via a 
dishwasher supply line with 3/8 comp fittings), I can effectively keep the 
entire system sanitized (and avoid worrying).


With respect to the brewpot, there was a decisive split between using an 
insulated box (ala Dave Miller's Homebrewing Handbook) or using an insulated 
wrap. Regardless, the pot would have to be removed from direct heat for the 
temperature rests. I definitely see the box as a better method to hold heat, 
however the insultated wraps will have a use for me... I intended on lautering 
using the Phil's sparging/lautering system. Several folks indicated that the 
heat loss on this system is profound. So, I am going to take the suggestion of 
using the foil coated bubble wrap (whomever suggested this, thanks) and using 
velco to make a jacket that I can wrap around the plastic buckets.


Thanks again!
