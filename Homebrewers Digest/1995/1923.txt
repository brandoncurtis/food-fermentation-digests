Subject: Acid Sanitizers, Sugars in British Brewing


Collective, I have two questions that are not related: 1) I have been using an 
acid based sanitizer (Star-San) and love it (Oh, regarding the cost, I'm 
willing to pay for peace of mind!!).  Question: what is the shelf-life of 
Star-San?  
2) A fuzzy fat bearded man gave me some books last week on Real Ale.  
Reviewing the recipes, I noticed that the British are very fond of using 
sugars.  The two primary types used are cane and inverted sugars.  My first 
task is obtaining these sugars.  Does anyone know where one can purchase these 
sugars in the USA and/or how to make them (inverted)?  Another question that 
arose is what exactly do these sugars contributed to the beer.  Other than the 
obvious alcohol, what do these sugars contribute as far as taste, body, and 
aroma?  Is it possible to use 2-row and a low mash temp. to substitute using 
sugar?  In conclusion, I'm trying to get a grip on brewing with sugars and how 
to substitute for them while retaining the desired characteristics.


Thank You - - - - JTH

Hello,


I recently moved to the Chicago Suburbs (Naperville).  I've been told that I
don't have to worry about water treatment. Where I live receives city water
from Lake Michigan.


Does anyone know if Chicago water needs to be treated for all grain brewing?
 


Thanks,

Subject: Candi Sugar


Maybe I am unclear on the concept, but is candi-sugar any different than the
rock candy I used to eat when I was a kid (25-30 years ago)? As I recall, we
would sometimes make it ourselves by suspending a string in supersaturated
cane sugar water. 


And I forgot to post yesterday that the bottle of Iodaphor (B-T-F brand)
spcifically says NOT to use hot water.

Subject: How much sugar should I add?


Here is a quick question to the collective knowledge of HBD.  I have been a 
homebrewer now for almost two years and have had many people tell me to add 
anything from 1/2 cup to 1 cup corn sugar.  I understand that the answer will 
vary, but can anyone out there give me something scientific?  I currently use 
3/4 cup corn sugar and have been successful most of the time, but I have had a 
few beers that overcarbonate in the bottles and are almost useless.


I have two batches of beer currently in secondary fermenters.  Here's the info 
that I have collected so far:


     Batch #1: California Steam Beer, starting g 1046, currently still bubbling
every 70-80 seconds at 1016 g.


     Batch #2: Octoberfest, start 1044, currently 1015, still bubbling every 50
seconds.


I know that both of these batches are close to their final gravity and almost 
ready to bottle.  I just want to addd the right amount of sugar and not over 
prime them.


Any comments or help can be addressed to me directly at 
ncostanz`at`emh.kunsan.af.mil    or posted here.  Thanks.

Subject: Yeast Washing


I've been brewing all-grain beers with liquid yeasts for almost two years but 
have never attempted to "repitch" yeast from one batch into another.  I
downloaded the yeast.faq and after reading it, I thought the process of
"washing" the yeast sounded like a good method given my usual brewing schedule.


I racked a porter into the secondary last night and attempted the procedure as
it was outlined in the yeast.faq.  What I ended up with is a 1 quart mason 
jar about 80% full (appx. 4 oz of trub, 1/2-3/4 oz of yeast, and 20 oz of beer).


My questions are:


1)  How long should it take for the separation to take place after agitating
    the jar (with boiled water and trub/hops/yeast taken from the primary
    fermenter)?  I poured off about half of the first jar after 10-15 minutes.
    It looks like I got all the yeast but too much trub/hop material.


2)  Is 1/2 oz to 3/4 oz of yeast enough? (it's more than I typically get using
    a Wyeast package in a pint of starter)


4)  What's the best way to pitch the yeast I got into a starter before I brew
    another batch? (i.e. pour off the beer, try to separate the yeast from the
    trub one more time, etc.)


I've been reading the HBD for some time, it's a great resource of information!


Happy New Year!

Subject: Astringency


Don Rudolph wanted to discuss astringency
- -----------------------------------------
I recently racked a Pilsner to the secondary fermenter, and while tasting
the brew, I noticed a slight astringency, felt as a dryness on my cheeks 
and tongue.....
- ------------------------------------------
There should be some discussion of how you can tell youv'e got an astringency
problem.  Astringency, from a sensory evaluation standpoint, is often
confused with bitterness.    I have judged in competitions where judges take
off points for a beer being "too bitter".  In many cases,  after talking it
over, they are tasting astringency.   When I question them on where they are
tasting all the bitterness they say on the middle of their tongue.


To me this is astringency.  If you are not tasting it on the back of your
tongue, it must be something other than bitterness.   Don describes it as a
dryness on his cheeks and tongue.  It can be very puckering, or it can taste
like "bitternes" in the center of your tongue.  I write this so that the
discussion can focus on the right thing at least from a sensory evaluation
perspective.

Subject: Water




Greetings!


I am just getting started all-grain brewing.  I've done 3 extract batch and
one all-grain IPA.  I am getting ready to do a bock and was wondering what 
I should do to treat my local water or should I just give up and go buy RO
water at the water store.  Here's the analysis from my water department:


Calcium                 4 ppm                Chloride        71 ppm
Flouride       1.3 ppm                   Magnesium         1 ppm
Nitrate       .006 ppm                Sodium               266 ppm
Sulfate               112 ppm                
Total Hardness/CaCO3  15 ppm            ph          8.2
Total Alka as CaCO3  369 ppm
Bicarbonate    450 ppm                Carbonate        0 ppm
Dissolved Solids 678 ppm        P. Alka/CaCO3        0 ppm


I've read Dave Miller's and CP's books and I know to boil the water to get rid
of the Bicarbonate.  Will this drop my ph enough and what about all that Sodium?


Any help would be appreciated. TIA,

Subject: Growing and mixing up Hops




     I have been growing my own Hops in Western Washington for three years. 
     It is a wonderful addition to a homebrewing hobby. I have a question. 
     I have heard that if I plant and grow two different kinds of Hops next 
     to each other they will "cross polinate" and this will create a 
     problem. Does anyone know about this? It doesn't seem likely to me.
     
     Also a question on sweetness. I have heard that mashing at 160 degrees 
     F as opposed to 150 degrees F will result in a sweeter beer as the 
     sugars produced at the 160 range are less fermentable. Is this true?
     
     OK and now I should supply a couple of answers. I have found that 
     Flaked Wheat and of course Flaked Barley is a wonderful addition to 
     beer to add a nice foam or "head'. I use one quarter pound of flaked 
     wheat for each ten gallons and double that for flaked barley. The 
     flaked barley for dark beer and flaked wheat for light beer.

Subject: re: Columbus Hops


We got a first hand look at Columbus hops growing on the bine 
this summer in Yakima. The cones are quite large and fairly 
dense. Breaking the cones open reveals medium yellow lupulin in 
massive quantities. The head brewer at Fish brewing commented 
that when he gets boxes of vacuum sealed pellets the pellets 
often have to be chipped apart; they stick together due to the 
quantity of resin. As is typical with high alpha hops, the 
bines grew agressivly with large bunches at the tops of the 
trellises. The bines appeared to be rather prolific cone 
producers as well.


I got a warm reception at last month's brew club meeting for my 
very hoppy pale ale that had been late hopped and dry hopped with 
Columbus. At the time, the beer was still a little young. It 
has an even better nose now after two weeks in the fridge.


During the late summer, hops are more plentiful than grass 
clippings in Yakima.


  Cheers,
  Don

Without "highly technical, complicated, super precise information" we are in
danger of creating more momilies as Jack has here. A "momilie" is really
just a poorly researched assertion, or "factoid",  unsupported by scientific
method.


He is referring to bending of the shaft by the weight of the motor, this
bending becomes flexing as the shaft rotates, the alternate compression and
expansion of the metal lattice causes metal fatigue and the shaft snaps. I
decided to flex my library card and check this out.


When a shaft has a bending moment applied it curves in a "Radius of
Curvature". If a 20 lb motor was hung on a pully 1 inch out from the
bearing, on a 3/4" shaft its ROC would be about 450 yards, i.e. a deflection
of only 0.00003 inches! Steel can take this easliy. I didn't bother to
calculate how many millions of lbs of malt Dion would have to crack before
metal fatigue set in, because I am sure his liver would give out first. You
setup is safe for this lifetime Dion!


Jack Schmidling also created a couple of biological and chemical momilies.

 Jim  >      I don't have a problem with delaying pitching up to 8 hours,
providing the beer is cooled immediately.  The problem I have is the slow
cooling.  1st, you increase the opportunity for contamination, no matter how
careful you are with your sanitation.  Remember, sanitation is NOT
sterilization, and wort at 100 F is mighty tasty stuff and bacteria
replicate at incredible rates at that temp.  Air attemperation is just too
slow a cooling process.  2nd, DMS  production will be excessive,
particularly with the standard North American malts which are of the
low-kiln temperature variety (i.e. lager malts).

I can't imagine many bacteria surviving, but the spores of many (especially
"Pediococcus") would. The point to early pitching is simply that
fermentation lowers the pH of the wort making it a hostile environment for
bacterial growth.  
JS>For all practicle purposes, if you put a lid on the kettle after the
boil, it JS>is sterile and will stay that way for a long time.


It may remain not seriously infected, but "sterile" is a misuse of english,
sooner or later such a technique would produce noticible bacterial off
flavours. The cooling of headspace in the kettle must draw fresh air into
the pot. What you can sometimes get away with is not good brewing practice.

There is flavour threshold for Dimethyl Sulphide, determined by empirical
testing.(DMS is the sulphury stuff that is produced from SMM
(S-methylmethionine-yes, forget it now!) during heating) A guy called
Meillgard determined that less than this threshold is totally insignificant,
up to twice this level is noticable and over twice the flavour threshold is
a significant flavour. 
Some people like a bit of sulphur flavour in their beer. There is a HBD
subscriber from MT. Isa in NW Queensland, Australia who would *never* notice
DMS in his beer. That is because the local copper/zinc mine stack regularly
dumps choking sulphurous fumes on the town. These fumes are only "choking"
to outsiders because locals become desensitised to them. People become
desensitised to all kinds of brewing flaws.


The people at "The Brewery" (http://alpha.rollanet.org/) have a post of mine
in the technical library under "Thermodynamics of Wort Chilling" in which I
have tables for calculating the boil time and cooling time effects on the
DMS threshold. If you want a ready reckoner to determine the effect of your
technique on DMS, have a look. There is no doubt that Jack's technique will
smell/taste to most of us like a freshly opened can of corn. We can't all be
as desensitised as Jack Schmidling.


>  Geeze Gary!  You've got serious equipement there, surely building a

Putting the kettle is a bathtub of ice water and *stirring* both water and

There is simple, easy beer, and complicated, difficult beer, and there is
good beer and great beer. The ideal many strive for in homebrewing is to
make great beer easily. But, I sometimes throw together some hopped kits, no
sugar, well aerated, liquid yeast, some late hop and produce good beer.
However like quickie sex, good beer is OK when you don't have the time or
patience for the alternative. It lacks a certain "wonderfulness" Algis
Korzonas talks of.
 
JS>p.s. I am sure you are all delighted to see that I have solved my posting

We can "bust" real momilies simply by taking our library cards and a
*little* trouble to find out what some scientific folk have established with
a *lot* of trouble. But, we could flex our library cards till they broke and
we would still be ignoring the Mother of all Momilies. 


You see, our mothers usually taught us that, by presenting our demands and
objections as provocation or tantrums, they were:
        1/Likely to get attention more quickly
        2/ Less likely to be met with a reasoned response, and
        3/ Probably be rewarded in return for just shutting up.
Unfortunately, this formative lesson in life seems to come up cronically in
HBD discussions without ever being challenged.

>Anyone have any suggestions to improve this setup without getting

Bill,


Worse things could happen than to own a Phil Mill. I've had one for a 
couple of years now and really like it.


To better manage the mill's grist efflux, I made a funnel out of the top 
of a 2-liter soft drink bottle. I punched a hole at the 'wide end' of 
the funnel (just where the bottle's wall becomes vertical). The mill's 
set screw runs through this hole, holding the funnel in place at the 
bottom of the mill.


Till recently I drove my Phil Mill with a variable speed 3/8" drill. I 
could start, stop, re-start etc. with no problems, even with the hopper 
full. As always, your (drill's) mileage may vary.


I never liked the original mounts that came with the mill. I should have 
simply bolted the mill directly to the table (or whatever). But I never 
did, since I like to mill outdoors. 


Recently I mounted the mill in a small (home-made) table top with two 
pulleys, a belt and a 1/4 HP motor. It now turns at 240 RPM (the mill 
that is), with ample torque for those full-hopper starts. I *strongly* 
recommend using belt guards with a set up like this. I do. The motor 
simply wouldn't stop if clothing or body parts got caught in the 
pulleys.


I haven't gotten fixed up with a larger hopper yet, but would like to 
hear how other digesters have done it.


As always, I'll be happy to give more details if you send a note.

I did much the same thing...or rather my brew partner did. In our case the
metal beeads and some of the wax got into the kettle. I strained the wort
after boiling. I *think* I got some/most of the beads. Certainly some of the
wax was lost into the batch. I noticed no unusual flavors and I had seen no

bought the freezer (my wife sent me off with green light! Yee Ha) I
retrieved a Hunter "Set 'n Save I" which is a digital programable house
thermostat. Not sure if this is related to the Airstat or whatever it was
called. The unit is designed for 26 VAC so I built a
transformer/rectifier/relay arrangement. The thermostat uses a thermistor
which happens to be the same one sold at radio shack. I've used a temp probe
made from one of these thermistors for all of my more recent batches with
good results. I ended up frying the original thermistor and bought a new one
and made my new probe. So far the frig works pretty good. I am noticing some
condensate on the upper side surfaces of the frig interior but no pooling of
water after about a week of operation. Lowest programmable temp setting is
40 deg F. The unit will display down to 32 deg F. Compressor cuts on at 2
deg above set temp and cuts off at 1 deg below set temp. Freezer was $250
(floor model), thermostat - $27 and power supply/relay parts - $22. Now I'm
ready to Lager!  -Dave
