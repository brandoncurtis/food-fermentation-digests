 I also have PhilsMill.  I have replaced the plastic lid on a 3 gal plastic
pail with a woden lid.  I then attached the mill to the wooden lid at the
very edge.  I then cut a circular hole in the side of the pail near the top
to allow the "shaft" to fit through.  The down side is that I must detach the
crank handle before removing the crushed grain.  ( I supose that I could
fashion a hinged window to permit grain removal without disturbing the
assembled mechanism but haven't gotten to that yet.)  I  replaced the
standard handle with a Lil Nub (tm) that I attach my drill to but you still
have to disconnect the drill before getting into the collecting hopper.  If
you brew really BIG beers then you could simply use a larger pail but 6-10
lbs of grain fit easily into the 3 gal pail.

Subject: Any recent Wyeast 1056 problems?




In mid-October, someone posted about problems with a packet of Wyeast 1056.  
The packet had a September production date.  Has anyone had any problems with 
packets of more recent vintage?  On Fri (12/29), I smacked a packet w/ 
production date 11/15/95 (purchased Thanksgiving weekend), pitched it to a 1 
pt. starter on 12/31.  When I got ready to pitch the starter to my wort today 
(1/1/96), the yeast starter smelled awful (more like bread than like beer, but 
if I had been making bread that smelled like that, I would have tossed it).  
For the record, I've used 1056 up to three months after production date w/ no 
problems.


My questions:


1) any recent problems w/ 1056 that anyone can relate?


2) since I didn't have a back-up starter, I smacked new yeast (two packs, 
actually, one 1056 w/ 12/20/95 date, and an ESB w/ 12/20 date to be safe).  My 
wort is air-locked in the carboy.  Can I safely pitch a new starter in 2-3 
days when the starter is ready?  I guess this will be a chance to see just how 
good my sanitation procedures are.... 8*{)


Lesson Learned:  Check the starter before starting the boil.


Happy New Year,

Tungsten light bulbs do indeed produce more energy from the red end of 
the spectrum.  However, they do produce significant light energy at 
520 nm (about half as much as the same intensity of sunlight).  
Therefore, the light produced isn't quite as bad as sunlight of the 
same intensity, but it's definitely _not_ harmless to our beer!


here's a very crude representation of the wavelength distribution of 
regular tungsten light bulbs and sunlight:


          200 |                              xxxx tungsten
              |                            xx
              |                         xxx
              |                       xx
 relative     |                     xx
  amount  100 |     ooooooooooooooxxooo

              | oo         xxxx

Subject: Stainless Steel Mesh Hop Cages


Hi Brewers,


I recently found some fairly heavy gage S.S. mesh at a scrap metal yard (35
cents per pound).


Used the mesh to build a cylinder to contain whole hops for dry-hopping in
corny kegs. Also built larger cylinders to contain whole hops during the
boil. The containers won't work with hop pellets.


These cages (my wife calls them cricket cages) seem to work well for both
boiling and dry-hopping. I like them better than nylon hop bags: less
wettable, easier to sanitize, clean, etc.


The cylinders were formed and secured into shape using annealed S.S. wire.
The mesh disk for the bottom was secured with the same wire. The disk for
the lid was hinged with S.S. wire. Have tried various methods to keep the
lid in a closed position but haven't yet worked out an ideal/convenient
method of closure.


For boiling, I use a cylinder measuring 4.25 x 7 inches to contain one ounce
of whole hops. Cages measuring 2.5 x 6 inches work well for 0.5 oz hop
additions, and for dry-hopping in the keg. A long length of S.S. wire
attached to the dry-hopping cage allows the cage to be easily removed from
the keg if needed. The end of the wire is curled so it rests just beneath
the keg pressure plate. So far, we have consumed the brew before needing to
remove the dry-hop cage.


This mesh is a bitch to cut. I used a Dremel moto-tool with fiberglass
reinforced cutting disk for cutting. Works fine, but requires several disks.


The mesh also makes a good screen for mash-lautering purposes, but I prefer
a circular-type copper manifold with slits in the bottom (10 gal Gott cooler).


Hope some of you find this information useful. Would appreciate any
feedback, pro or con. E-mail is fine.


Happy 1996, and many thanks for all the useful information you folks have
provided on the HBD.

Subject: Beer-induced beer thoughts


Dear fellow beer nuts,


  There are a couple of minor things I'd like to address that I haven't seen
mentioned as yet.


  First of all, I've read here that the Phil's Phalse Bottom tends to float.
The first time I read this I thought "B.S."  Then I experienced this with my
very next batch.  
  I don't believe "float" is exactly right, however.  I believe what happens
is that when the mash water is added too fast, air is trapped underneath the
Phalse Bottom until it escapes as one big bubble.  With this particular
mash, I added the entire three gallons or so all at once, and developed the
stuck mash from hell.
  The next time, I'll add enough water to ensure that there's no air
underneath the Phalse Bottom before I add the grain, or leave the drain hose
open just long enough for the air to escape.


  Live and learn!  Now, if I can just live long enough _to_ learn!


  Secondly, as winter is in full swing here in Michigan's upper peninsula
(read: Redneck-land [read: I'm _not_ from here]) and I keep my fermenter in
my kitchen (which is directly over the concrete foundation) keeping my
fermenting ales at a high enough temperature was a slight problem. 
  Until I dug out a small heating pad and placed it a few inches beneath the
carboy (I use the Fermentap setup, and love it).
  Eureka!  It raised the wort temperature about six degrees and added no
light to damage the beer.


  Enough!  Time for a friggin' beer!


Dan
