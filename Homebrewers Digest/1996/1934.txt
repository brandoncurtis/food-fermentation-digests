I had this situation once when I took the gravity reading from a carboy into
which I had transferred concentrated wort and added makeup water.  I hadn't
shaken it at this point, and when I took a gravity sample from the top of the
fluid, I got below 1.030 for an extract brew which should've been 1.050.  I
shrugged, cursed a bit, but plowed on, and produced a fine beer with it.
 Wort is heavier than water and MUST be well-mixed before an accurate OG
reading can be taken.  Once fermentation has occurred (or is occurring), the
wort is well-mixed and a gravity reading may be obtained from any depth.


For evaporation, figure on *about* 1 gal per hour.  this varies considerably
due to kettle geometry, altitude, wort gravity, vigor of boil, and 1001 other
things, so benchmark your brewery and go from there.


On yeast temps -- true enough, but pitching at much above 75-80 can "shock"
yeast or encourage too-fast fermentation, with all the undesirable
by-products associated with it.  Best to pitch near room temp.

Wierd, huh?  When I was in Scotland this summer I asw the same thing; Bud and
Miller being pawned off as "premium American Lagers" with a price tag to
match the title.  Not may takers, though, from what I saw.  I did try a Coors
Extra-Gold in Edinburgh and found it noticibly more robust than its American
progenitor, so perhaps there's a bit of local taste accounted for in the
UK-brewed version (yes, they brew under license in the UK).


Gilad Barak wants to know about grain steeping:


Do it, dude!!  Best to toss the grains into the cold brew water (in a nylon
mesh bag for ease of removal), bring the temp up to about 155F (hi-60's C),
hold for 30 minutes, then remove the grains and continue.  Under no
circumstances should you boil the grains -- much nastiness will result in
your beer.  The 155-degree "rest" is best-suited if you have grains of some
diastastic power such as pale or Munich, in which case you will achieve
somewhat of a "mini-mash".  If no such grains are present, it still serves to
fully extract all the goodness of the grain.

Subject: Metabolism Simplified


C. D. Pritchard and John Wilkinson are interested in the metabolism
discussions but are suffering some vertigo.  If I really understand any of
this stuff I ought to be able to explain it neatly and concisely without
the jargon of the biochemist. Here's my attempt:


1. All living things require energy.
2. This energy is required in a readily useable form. In living things it
is stored in ATP (in a class of molecules known as "nucleotides") which is
(mother nature's bio-chemical battery.
3. Living things not capable of getting energy from the sun must obtain it
from a chemical source, i.e. sugar.
4. The simplest way to get ATP energy from sugar is to ferment it i.e. to
break its 6-carbon structure down into a simpler 2 carbon structure.
5. Simple organisms are capable of this simple means of energy conversion.
6. Fermentation is not very efficient. It extracts only about a fifteenth
of the total energy available from sugar (2 ATP molecules per glucose
molecule).
7. In fermentation the 6 carbon glucose is split into two 3 carbon sugars
(trioses) and these are oxidized ("oxidation" means to grab electrons in
the same way that oxygen does. No oxygen is involved in fermentation.) to
pyruvic acid (usually referred to as pyruvate). The reaction steps which
describe this process are referred to as the "Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
Pathway" (or just "EMP Pathway").
8. The oxidizing agent is NAD+, the oxidized form of the nucleotide NAD. It
grabs the electrons. In the course of oxidizing the trioses the NAD+ is
reduced (whenever something is reduced someting else is oxidized and
conversely) to NADH which symbolizes the reduced state of NAD.
9. The NAD+ must be regenerated if the fermentation is to continue. This
happens when pyruvate gives off CO2 to form 2-carbon acetaldehyde and the
acetaldehyde is reduced by NADH. When it reduces acetaldehyde the NADH
becomes oxidized to NAD+ which is reused in Step 8.
10. The other product of the reduction of acetaldehyde is 2-carbon ethanol.
11. More evolved organisms are capable of oxidizing the 3 carbon pyruvate
to obtain more energy (a total of 28 ATP molecules per molecule of
glucose).  This is called "respiration". Pyruvate gives up CO2 forming the
2 carbon acetyl group which binds with "coenzyme A" to form AcCoA. AcCoA
then enters a cyclical sequence of reactions called the "Citric Acid
Cycle", the "Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle" or the "Krebs Cycle". In this cycle
the 2 carbon acetyl group condenses with four carbon oxaloacetic acid
forming 6 carbon citric acid which then goes through a series of reactions
in which 2 carbons leave (as CO2) thus producing the 4 carbon succinic acid
which is eventually converted back to oxaloacetic acid completing the
cycle.
12. In addition to the CO2, electrons (bound to nucleotides) are also
thrown off. These enter the "electron transport" chain where they
eventually meet with hydrogen ions and oxygen to form water. The
nucleotides are transformed into ATP in this process.
13. Yeasts are among the more evolved organisms. They are "facultative
anaerobes" meaning that they can ferment in the absence of oxygen or
respire in the presence of oxygen.
14. Whether they ferment or respire depends, obviously, upon the presence
of oxygen (they cannot respire without it) but also on a complex series of
feedback control mechanisms involving dozens of enzymes whose activities
are dependent upon the concentrations of the various sources and products
of metabolism.
15. Pasteur observed that yeast which were fermenting (anaerobic) reverted
to respiration when oxygen was supplied. This makes sense because
respiration is so much more efficient in terms of energy production.
16. Some yeasts, notably brewing yeasts, will not respire, even though
oxygen is present, in the presence of glucose. They ferment (or continue to
ferment if O2 was introduced after fermentation was underway). This makes
sense because a simple pathway is being used. The organism reverts to its
most primitive method of metabolism. As Craig Amundsen noted, nature likes
the KISS system.
17. When oxygen is present and Crabtree effect is operating the yeast
respire the alcohol formed during fermentation. This is "diauxic"
metabolism.
16. The alcohol is oxidized to acetate and the acetate then enters another
cycle called the glyoxylate cycle. This cycle produces succinic acid which
can then enter the Krebs cycle to be respired by the mechanism of Steps 11
& 12.
18. Once the glucose level is reduced significantly, the cells synthesize
(this is called "induction") enzymes which allow maltose to enter the cell
and which cleave it into a pair of glucose molecules.
19. If oxygen is present these glucose molecules will flow down the EMP
pathway to form AcCoA. Rather than entering the Krebs cycle, much of this
combines with oxygen to form sterol, the stuff of the cell wall. Most of
the oxygen absorbed by brewing strains is not respired but rather used in
this way. In baking strains of S. cerevesiae more respiration takes place.
Some of the AcCoA is also used to synthesize amino acids and other products
required by the cell (including glycogen).
20. When the oxygen is depleted the cells then revert to simple
fermentation (although activities like growth and budding continue but at a
lower rate).


This obviously attempts to cram the whole nine yards into a nutshell. Two
questions follow.  First, to those who understand all this "Does it look
right?" Second, to those who don't: "Does this help to make it clear?"

Subject: More stuck sparge problems


Hi,


This past weekend, I brewed a Russian Imperial Stout.  I use an EasyMasher
fitted to a 5 gal. kettle (so I can handle about 12 lbs of grain at a
time), and for the second time this brew season, had a stuck sparge (the
first was when I made a Weizenbock).  At first I thought that the EM itself
might have been the source of the problems, but after checking it out in
between mashes (I had to do a double mash to get the proper gravity)
decided that it was probably my recipe.  It follows:
        8.5 lb. Pale
        14 oz. Biscuit
         7 oz. German Crystal
         7 oz. Belgian Special B
        10 oz. Black patent
        12 oz. Roasted barley
         8 oz. Flaked barley
Mash sched: 104=B0 for 30 min., 155=B0 for 90 min. (a mash schedule I have u=
sed
before, modified from G. Fix's 40-60-70 schedule)
My question is this: Can anyone tell me why this collection of grains would
have given me such sparging problems?  Was it just too much special malt?
Should I have done a protein rest?  I have done mashes this heavy and thick
before with no problem, I even did a Wee Heavy double mash (from G.
Noonan's _Scotch Ale_) just 3 weeks before, with no problem.  Everything is
fine now, my big and small stouts are fermenting happily, but I prefer not
having to stay up until 6:30 am making beer, and am curious as to why this
didn't work, and what I should change in the future so that it isn't such a
pain in the ass.


Also, I posted about this a while ago, but never got any responses: Does
anyone have any recommendations for avoiding a stuck sparge with wheat
beers?  As I mentioned, I tried a Weizenbock a few months ago (used the
recipe in Warner's _German Wheat Beer_) which stuck as hard as the ten year
old gum under my fifth grade desk.  I really like wheat beer, and would
like to do more in the future, but not if it will involve 18-20 hour brew
sessions.


Any comments/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.


Mike

Subject: Computing Final Gravity


Tell me if you think this is a valid procedure for computing
final gravity.


Assuming for a given amount of malt in a given amount of finished
product.... if one used 100% fermentables such as 2-Row, one
might expect a final gravity of something like 1.008 (assuming
the starting gravity was about 1.045 to 1.050.


If one takes out thier brewing calculator (I use "Brewbeer")
and calculates the "points" contributed by the non-fermentables
(Crystal, Caravienne, Cara Munich, Dextrine, etc.) alone. Can
you back that figure out of something like 1.008.


Let me give you an example. I'm putting together a Pale Ale (10 gallons)
with about 16 lbs of 2-row and 3 lbs of various non-fermentables. I
calculate that the non-fermentables alone would contribute about
8 points to the total. If I add those 8 points to a figure
of 1.008, should I be surprised that I am getting a FG of
about 1.016? Don't know if I should blame the Crystal or poor yeast
for a high FG.


Are my theories cock-eyed? How DO you predict the target final
gravity for a recipie?

In Digest #1932:

This isn't brew-related, but it's relevant nonetheless. I'm not a lawyer
(yet) but have looked into the copyright laws recently, particularly in
regards to email and usenet. The vast majority of the countries around the
world all adhere to the Berne convention, thus copyright protection is the
same essentially everywhere. Anything you produce yourself (including email
and articles posted to listservers and newsgroups) is protected by copyright
whether or not one makes any direct claims in the document itself. Nobody
may legally reproduce your work without your permission (including
forwarding email or news articles!), although there is a concept known as
fair use, which allows one to quote short passages for the purpose of
critique, for example, and makes certain exceptions for such purposes as
education, parody, etc. If you think your work may have some commercial
value, you should probably append a copyright notice (i.e. copyright 1996,
T. Aquilla) in case you ever decide to try and collect for infringement.
Without such a notice, you may sue for infringement but you can't collect
any money from the infringer. I don't think the digest really needs such a
notice, but it would be very easy to add one to every issue (why not, Rob?)
and if any unscrupulous person ever makes a fast buck selling our digest to
anyone else (like beer-related CD-ROMs containing stolen info) we could
possibly collect enough cash to set up a dedicated server somewhere. I
highly recommend that everyone using the internet read an article called "10
Big Myths About Copyright Explained" by Brad Templeton, as it pertains
directly to net-abuse of copyright and it's an excellent article. This
article can be found at: http://www.clari.net/brad/copymyths.html
For those who are web-challenged, I'll email you a copy (I do have

Subject: 


A quick question for those of you who label your beer: what do you use to 
stick the darn things on the bottles? A friend of mine in a band who does 
a lot of postering for gigs and such suggested mixing up some skim milk 
powder to a very weak liquid and painting it on the back of the labels. 
Apparently it sticks fast but --and this is the important part-- comes 
off with a quick soak (in his case, the posters come off naturally in a 
couple of days due to rain and snow). I am hesitant to try this at home 
simply because of the potential smell of room-temperature milk, but maybe 
a weak solution of the powder, which can be kept unrefrigerated in dry 
form, won't cause this problem. What I really want to stay away from is a
non-water-based glue, like the rubber cement I once used years ago, 
because it took forever to get off. So, has anyone out there used the 
milk powder method? How did it work? Are there any other methods anyone 
would recommend? I'd like to stay away from gummed paper; I'd sooner 
print out one copy of the label and photocopy it then abuse my printer by 
running a pile of gummed sheets through it.


Thanks in advance,

Subject: Re: Oak Barrels


It is true that French Oak barrels are important in imparting flavor to 
wines (and I guess beer).  


The optimal storage for red wine in a 53 or 59 gallon barrel is one 
year after primary fermentation.  This means that after 7 days (more or 
less) on the skins, the wine should go into the 53 or 59 gallon barrel 
for one year.  If you are using a 30 gallon barrel, the optimum time 
period is around 11 months.


The above are only general guidelines.  Many variables go into the 
formula but if you want the 50 cent answer, the above are good enough.  
However, I once put seven month old Cab into a new medium plus toast 
Innerstave.  I will probably be able to start drinking the Cab this 
fall.  The wine was made in 1992.  I am able to drink my 1993 before 
the 1992.  In other words, do regular barrel tastings.  


Oak is usually toasted over a fire.  Better barrels are toasted with 
fire fuels with oak chips and scrap pieces.  Toasting levels range from 
none, light, medium to heavy.  For my Cab and Zin, I like medium plus.

I spent a few months in Saudi Arabia. The drink of choice is Sadiq (friend)
which is distilled from fermented cane sugar. It can be made brown by the
addition of wood chips. Both are horrible, but people seemed to develop a
taste for it given enough time.


Beer drinkers were out of luck. It is hard to get malt extract and hops
there as the government knows there is only one use for them. Most simply
add Sadiq to near beer. Imagine adding bad gin to Kaliber. I would suggest
holding your nose, slamming a shot of Sadiq, then sip a VERY cold near beer.


If you were able to actually brew there, you would be the most popular

My guess it was a bad couple of bottles. As far as I can tell Miller has had
no affect on the operation of the brewery from a recipe/quality standpoint.
You can always visit their homepage at http://www.celis.com and leave them
some mail. I will pass your comments onto a friend inside the brewery.

Subject: Open Fermentation


Tim asks about open fermentation:


<I assume 
<that the "open" period should begin as soon as a krauesen layer covers the 
<surface of the fermenting beer and should last until the foam begins to 
<subside and break apart.  Any dissention yet?


Commercially, most open fermenters are never covered.  Some are housed
in positive pressure rooms, others are not.  Ive never seen a positive
pressure room in Belgium but they probably exist somewhere.  For homebrewing
I like to cover it at times when it is least active.  Its just a good idea.
As the beer hits high krausen (about 10-12 hours in my normal ales), I remove
the lid totally to allow the dense rocky krausen to form and to avoid 
spill over out of my fermenter.  Commercially, the beer is moved as soon
as the krausen dies down.  I sometimes allow it to sit covered as long
as 5 days after this.


<Some of the true British-style open fermentations I've seen (in pictures) use 
<a recirculating system, in which fermenting beer from the bottom of the 
<fermenter is redistributed to the top of the fermenter (spraying or stream).


This is very rare these days.  Yorkshire Squares and Burton Unions are
the vessels used.  Only one large brewer still uses Unions, Marstons, 
and they blend the beers between Union and non-Union fermenters.  Sam Smiths
and another Yorkshire brewer still use Squares.


<What is the purpose of recirculation:  rousing, aeration, mixing, all of the 
above?


Yes, and less losses.


<Wouldn't increased aeration lead to greatly elevated 
diacetyl production?


Yes, but dependent on yeast strain.


<Is recirculation necessary to get the true benefits of open fermentation?


No, but it is very useful with sleepy yeasts that want to flocc out
too soon.  Also useful with true top croppers, ones that sit on the 
top at the end of the ferment.


I would not suggest recircing in the home environment.  If you need to
rouse the yeast, use a sanitized spoon and stir it up, or use the
dropping method.


<My plan is to loosely cover the fermenter until fermentation 
<commences, then remove the lid and begin recirculation until fermentation 
<basically subsides, then rack to glass secondary or straight-away to keg.  
<Opinions are welcome.


Be sure to clean and scrub/sanitize the kettle before you ferment in it.
Skip the recircing.  If you want to rack to secondary, fine but you dont
have to.  If you skim the yeast then allow it to settle you can go straight
into the kegs with it.  I never do a secondary these days.

I use a Teledyne undersink charcoal chlorine filter (about $40 with cartidge
at the home stores) and have had no problems with chlorine since.  Since I
don't know whether the cartridge is truly bacteriostatic, the risk of
bacteria buildup due to lack of chlorine is a concern, but I have never had
an infected batch in the year that I have used the filter.  I usulaly run the
water for a bit before using it for brewing, just to try to flush out the
majority of whatever might be lurking.


Recent posting suggest that in addition to removing chlorine, the pH of the
water is changed which could affect mashing and other brewing chemistries.
 On my list of Things to Do is to take "before" and "after" water samples to
be analyzed, to see what effect the filter is having.  However, I have made
all-grain beers with filtered water (adding a bit of gypsum in the mash --
maybe a tblsp or so), with good results.

How about a tee-fitting in the tank-to-keg line?  Only caveat here is that
these chucks leak like sieves so be sure to put a valve or at least a clamp
in-line with the chuck to conserve CO2.

Subject: faucet consensus, coffee pots for hop "tea"


Greetings!


Thanks to all who responded to my request for advice about replacing 
the kitchen faucet to make brewing easier.  What follows is a brief 
consensus/synopsis of the responses I got (over a dozen!).


 - Everyone recommended that a hose type sprayer be a part of the 
package, either built in or as an accessory.  


 - Several people recommended either a tall faucet or one of those that 
can be extended upward to allow filling/washing of tall brew pots 
etc.  


 - Two people pointed out that if you want to use a bottle washer that 
you make sure that the new faucet will accept your bottle washer or 
else be of the type that an adapter can be found.  One of the two had 
made the mistake of not watching for this and now was relegated to 
washing bottles in the bathroom sink (ouch!).


Okay, nothing really earth shaking here but I really hadn't thought 
of the bottle washer part...I will now!


==========


Not long ago someone suggested using the coffee pot to make a hot 
"tea" for aroma hop additions but was afraid of the residue and the 
subsequent fallout from the wife.


Well, this isn't a problem around our house as a fair portion of my 
hop supply goes to making hopped coffee.  If you haven't tried this 
then by all means do it.  I suggest a nice, dark roasted bean to help 
complement the hop flavor and aroma.  Everyone that I have served 
this coffee to has really enjoyed it and several of those do not like 
the taste of beer and were greatly surprised that they liked the 
taste of the hops.


My favorite hop for this is Mt. Hood with Fuggles running a close 
second but, any good aroma hop should be fine.


Cheers!


Kevin

        It sounds like you are off to a good start, and you did fine on
     your first batch.  Some brown ales (there are several types - yours
     sounds similar to a Southern Brown Ale) are sweet at finish due to
     caramel malts.  This style is usually a low to medium alcohol brew and
     is light bodied (low final gravity).  This is one of my favorite
     brews!  You said that the fermenting temp of the brown ale was 62 F,
     which must have been warm enough.  I wouldn't go much lower in temp
     with an ale, they usually prefer 60 - 75 F as a general rule, but it
     depends on the yeast used.  I personally use 65 - 68 F for most of my
     ales since that is my basement temp.  I have had good results so far.


        So, to answer your question: "Did the cold temps stick my
     fermenting in the first batch and inhibit yeast activity in both
     batches??"  For the first batch, no it did not - but it may partly
     explain why it was a little slow starting.  My ales usually take off
     like a shot!  Bring the second batch (the IPA) back up to 68 F but
     don't repitch right away.  Check the specific gravity in about 4 days
     to see if it is working.  Bringing the temp. back up should bring the
     yeast out of dormancy.


        Be sure that you are aerating well pefore pitching the yeast.
     Also, if you are using liquid yeast,  always make a starter.  I used
     dry yeast for my first few batches, the amount of time to get started
     can vary also depending on the percent of viable yeast.  You didn't
     specify which type you used.  Like most serious homebrewers, I feel
     that liquid yeast is best - I soon made the switch.


         If you can get your basement down in the 55 - 58 F region, you may
     want to try a lager next.  I have a lager in my basement now at 55 F
     and it is doing ok.  The general rule (generic) for lager temp. is
     usually between 45 - 58 F, which varies with styles and yeast used.


        Good luck and happy brewing!

Seems to me that the serving pressure is a little easier to adjust, Al.
Either way, as we say here in Indiana, it's the "same difference."  :)


I have to confess that I've been winging it with my keg setup.  (I've only
had it like 6 months or so, haven't used it to fill anything exotic yet,
like tires.  :)   I need to be more systematic about it--my regulator is
reading way off (reads 10 lbs with the pressure off) and I've just been
force carbing by the seat of the pants without too much trouble.  I have a
6 ft line on one of my kegs and I can hold the faucet up and serve pretty
well when I over shoot the carb.  Also, I have decided not to drill the
fridge for carb lines.  I just charge them once a week or so and have no
problems with that.  Taps in the door would be great, but I think I'll do
all grain first.  :)

Gee, I read that one really close, didn't I?  :)  I think I should go into
lurker mode for awhile.  Let me ask one question while I'm here though...


What kind of efficiency should I expect from a Corona mill?  I wanted a
Malt Mill, but I got two Coronas for Christmas.  I'm not complaining too
much, but it still wasn't enough jack (pardon the pun) to get the MM.  Before
Christmas, somebody posted a "which mill should I buy" question on r.c.b and
I said "MM, no question."  A couple folks wrote to ask why they shouldn't
just get the much cheaper Corona.  I gave them the usual reasons, but it
eventually led to both of us wondering approximately how much more grain
would be needed and the eventual "break even" period (or number of
batches).  Of course, when you break even, you would have a much better
mill, but you see what I'm getting at, right?  What's the typical
effeciency difference?  What number should I plug into Suds as a starting
point?  I am going to use a slotted copper manifold in a 48 qt picnic
cooler, single infusion to start off with.

Hear, hear!  I warm the tubing with hot water, and bend slowly and smoothly.
I can't make tight bends and don't try.  I think practice helps.  But, bending

I haven't had any for about a month, and it was on tap, but it was wonderful.
If it's changed, it's been recent.  Did you buy from a reputable store?

Here's a better idea.  Between the regulator and the

stays closed tight enough to leave on all the time.  If
you're worried about leakage, place a good gas valve
between the tee and the chuck.

Jim Navecky asked about aerating canes: As far as I know, and what I ginned
up for my experiment, was an ordinary racking cane into which a small hole
was introduced at the top of the curve. The idea is that the vaccum created
by the falling wort will also suck in some air which will mix in with and
oxygenate the wort.


Neal Parker asked how dissolved O2 levels are measured. It is done with a
meter which applies a small bias (790 mV) across a silver and gold
electrode pair immersed in an electrolyte such as potassium bromide. The
electrode pair is adjacent to a very thin membrane through which oxygen
dissolved in the test sample can diffuse. Oxygen entering through the
membrane is reduced at the cathode (gold) by electrons supplied from the
bias supply and the current produced is then proportional to the amount of
oxygen which crosses the membrane which is, in turn, proportional to the
partial pressure of oxygen in the sample.
This is called a "Clark" or "polarographic" electrode. There is another
type, the "galvanic" which is not often used in brewing. I have no idea
what the principal is for this type.


Tracy Aquilla commented that the statistical sample size in my Wyeat
counting was too small. This is recognized. I got 4.1E9 and 2.1E9 from
which the estimated average count is 3.1E9 plus or minus 1.4E9 cells. At
$4.00 a pop I'm not going to increase the sample size dramatically but will
probably count each pack I use from now on to try to get a reasonable
estimate. In actuality, I don't even have the right to average these two
counts since one pack was old and one new, one incubated and the other not.
Use the numbers as order of magnitude estimates of the probable cell counts
per pack.


Tracy also commented that lager yeasts should take nearly 24 hours to
replicate because of they are polyploid. This is contrary to my experience
with another lager strain (Wyeast Czech Pils, #2278) which seems to double
every 3 hours or so. This is consistent with the value of u of 0.25
published in H, B, S & Y which calculates to 2.8. [ u goes in the formula
n(t) = n(0)exp(ut) ]. How does the ploidy effect the division time?

Even galactose exhibits it to some extent but it is a matter of degree. To
quote the scripture (H, B, S & Y) "The effect is expressed in the presence
of fructose as well as glucose but is less marked when maltose, mannose or
galactose is the fermentable carbohydrate. (Vol II, p 593). Then there is a
table on p 594 but maltose is not listed!

Subject: pectin






A couple of days ago, somebody posted a message about pectin. 
The author stated that pectin is a protein, and then proceeded to
explain why the light-absorbing properties of pectin could result
in cloudy beer.  This is an extreme simplification of the argument
given, and I apologize to the author for this, but I hope to keep
this post brief.
 
I disagree completely with that explanation.  Pectin is NOT a
protein; it is a complex carbohydrate made up of monosaccharides
that have had many of their hydrogen atoms replaced by methyl
groups.  Pectin and pectic acid salts are important structural
compounds in plant tissues.
 
Pectin is soluble in water (more so in hot, but even in cold).  In
the presence of acid and sugar, pectin, even in low concentrations,
can form a very stable colloidal suspension that traps particles of
other materials and prevents them from settling.  This is how the
presence of pectin results in cloudy beer (or wine).  Absorption of
light by pectin has nothing to do with it.  High temperatures are
not necessary to bring this condition about, although cooking
fruits can certainly cause much more pectin to be extracted.  
Pectin can be destroyed by pectinases - enzymes which hydrolyze
pectin.  Addition of such pectolytic enzymes can quickly clear beer
or wine if pectin is the cause of the cloudiness.
