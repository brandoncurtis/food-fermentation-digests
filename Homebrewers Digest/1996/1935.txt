I think the difference here is in the *mash* temperature as opposed to 
the strike temperature.  For example, by boiling the mash, the *mash*
reaches 203F (boiling temp here). 
However, by adding a pre-determined amount of 203F water *to* the 
mash, the temperature of the mash will stabilize at 128F or 155F or
whatever your target temperature may be.  
The important thing here is *to stir* while *slowly* adding the boiling 
water to the mash.  This reduces the possibility of *hot spots* in
your mash.

Subject: caramelising sugars and STEAM beer


Hello.
There has been some discussion recently on caramelising sucrose as a
replacement for candi sugar for brewing. I have some comments on this.


What is caramel? How do you make it? How far do you take the process? 


With reference to the "New Larousse Gastronomique", the world's greatest
cookery reference book, according to the cover (! - how many homebrewing
books make similar claims?), boiling sugar takes it through a number of
stages, named according to the manner the sugar behaves after being cooled.
The temperatures shown are the temperatures at which the stages are reached
(interestingly in another paragraph it makes contradictory claims about
these temperatures!)


small thread    
large thread
small ball
large ball
light crack             129C
medium crack            133C
hard crack              143C
extra hard crack        168C
caramel                 180C


The book says to first make a syrup by dissolving the sugar in 1/3 of its
weight of water, and to heat it in a heavy based saucepan, without stirring
as it causes graining. Another way of preventing graining is to add 100g
glucose per 500g sucrose. 


Charlie Scandrett has expressed concerns about heating in direct fired pots
causing uncontrollable scorching at the metal/solution boundary. Fortunately
us homebrewers usually would only want to make small quantities of caramel,
so if we heat sugar syrup in a clear glass bowl in a microwave oven, we can
observe the colour and remove it at the correct stage, and be assured of
fairly even heating.


I have done this twice now, in an attempt to get some caramel flavour into
Belgian ales. Both were around 1.070 OG. In the first (I'll call it Fred) I
caramelised 500g sugar (just to a light amber colour) in a 45 litre batch,
and added an additional (uncaramelised) 500g sucrose to the boil. In the
second darker beer (Pete) I caramelised 1Kg of sugar to a dark amber colour.
I added both as (hot!) liquid to boiling wort. (Be careful if you do this!
180C caramel has massive boilover potential. Add it slowly and carefully!)


Well it worked! Both beers have an excessive caramel/sweet flavour and
aroma. Fred finished at 1.016 and Pete at 1.022. The aroma is quite nice
with fragant caramel tones but strong. The flavour in both is just over the
top caramel. I fermented both with the same yeast strain (Yeastlabs Belgian)
and I use pure O2 aeration etc..


*If* I try caramelising sugar again, I would use possibly use just 100g in a
45l batch. I think some Belgian ales benefit from a little caramel
aroma/taste (eg. dubbels), but the amounts I used are excessive. I do not
know how the Belgians make their dark candi sugar but I think my technique
is way off the track somewhere. Probably a better way to get the caramel
taste is to use speciality Belgian crystal malts (unavailable to me). I am
yet to read in beer mags/books a thorough treatment of caramel.


**************


Steam beer? Is it true this has been trademarked worldwide? Could a brewery
open in Australia (just for *example*!) and make and sell "Steam" beer, or
would they risk the wrath/lawsuits of Fritz Maytag?

They are a bit of an endangered species DownUnder but there are  a few.
 
>I have a suggestion which would stop all such breakages. If the shaft is
3/8" and not 3/4", then it has a much lower resistance to bending.


Time for a reality check.  The "problem" I reported on has occurred 
possibly 3 times that I am aware of.  I simply brought it up because in 
all of the cases, chains and or gears were used to drive the mill and I
suspect a connection between the two.  Someone posted  a 
recommendation that I (the one who must honor the lifetime warranty)
do not agree with.


I pride myself in having a totally reliable product and need to really dig
to find problems at this stage in the evolution of the product.  This one
seems to be one that is best solved by the customer as opposed to 
a major redisign that would simply serve to increase the cost without
any serious impact on the reliability.  


Just for the record, the MMII has a 5/8" shaft

drill. The proprietor of Doc's Cellar in Pismo Beach used to grind his
customers malt with this method and I timed him at 10 pounds in about two
and a half minutes. I bought a mill and fretted when I found my drill had
only about 90% enough power to run it. ....


I used to demonstrate the MM with a Black and Decker Cordless with 
about 1% of the power required to run the mill fully loaded.  If you prefer
not to crank, just hand feed the malt at a rate your drill can accommodate.
You can also close up the grain guide opening with a piece of tape and
acomplish the same purpose.

>From: Tim Laatsch <LAATSCH`at`kbs.msu.edu>
 
>I would like to begin experimenting with open fermentation and 
would like to hear from those of you who do it routinely.... 
What exactly defines "open" fermentation?  Is it still considered "open" if I 
place the lid loosely on the fermenter?  (Yes, according to Jim B.) 


If you accept Jim's definition, then I "do it routinely" but I think it a
bit of a stretch to call something with a lid on it, "open".  Open 
fermenter brings to my mind, big wooden vats in dusty old
breweries with cob webs hanging all over.  There are all sorts of
risks in this approach but the results speak for themselves.


The idea of fermenting in a glass carboy with an airlock and mucking
around with blowoff  gives me a headache but is the other extreme.


I have been fermenting in my mash tun for years and would not do it
any other way.  After sparging is complete, I dump the spent grain.
(actually, I give it to the chickens now),  boil a quart of water for in
it for a few minutes  with the lid on and then put it in the fridge, 
ready for fermenting.


Nothing could be simpler or more convenient.


>I assume  that the "open" period should begin as soon as a krauesen
 layer covers the surface of the fermenting beer and should last until
 the foam begins to subside and break apart.  Any dissention yet?
 
Yes.  You will have to find a new word to make sense out of that
statement.  If you cover it, it ain't open and if you don't cover it , you
are nuts.  Well, lets just say there is no reason for not covering it.


I leave it in the primary fermenter with a lid on for about 10 days or until;
the wort clears.  I don't mean xtal clear but that point when a large
quantity of beer, seen from the top, turns from a milky look to very
dark.  It is then kegged and conditioned.  If you don't keg, you would
put it in a carboy with an airlock at this time to fully clear before
bottling.

From: dludwig`at`atc.ameritel.net
Subject: thermostats


Regarding my post on 1/5 concerning an application of the Hunter Set n Save
thermostat for a cool beer frig, I've had quite a few requests for details
so I decided to post my response to the HBD for public scrutiny. (I have no
affiliation with any of the companies mentioned in this post) 


The thermostat is a Hunter Set 'n Save I (model 42204) and costs about $27
at Lowes. It's powered by a AA battery, has an LCD and is programmable over
a temperature range of 40 to 90 deg F. It displays actual temperature down
to 32 deg F. This is the cheapest digital thermostat I could find. The stat
is designed to replace your home thermostat and for 26 VAC. My freezer has a
rudimentry thermostat that switches the 110 VAC house current to the
compressor and since the Hunter is designed to switch 26 VAC, I had to build
a transformer/rectifier/ relay(TRR) unit. My freezer draws 2.2 Amps so my
relay needed to handle that with some margin. The parts for the TRR came
from radio shack and are as follows:


273-1512 25.2V transformer (1)
276-1141 Epoxy Rectifier(diode) (2)
272-1020 2200 uF capacitor (1)
275-248  Mini 10A SPDT relay (1)
276-149  PC board (1)
270-744  PC-mount fuse clips (set)
271-110  Thermistor (1)
rubber grommets
Metal box 


The TRR is a simple transformer with full-wave rectifier and a capacitor to
smooth out the dc. I use a 1 amp fuse to the transformer but that's probably
overkill. The Mini 10amp relay is mounted to the board and has plenty of
rating for this application. All of the electronic parts cost about $22. But
you could get by cheaper if you had some old electronics laying around.  I
won't go into detail on how to build the board. Check out the "Building
Power Supplies" book at radio shack. I knew little about power supplies
until I bought that book and had a great time building it!


The set n save uses a thermistor that is also identical to the one sold at
radio shack. I removed the thermistor and attached leads to the stat board
that attach to the temp probe I made. I wanted to mount a temp probe
somewhere inside the freezer approximately mid level. I built the probe by
soldering leads to a new thermistor and coating the thermistor and soldered
leads (bare metal) with 5 minute epoxy. I put a pretty good glob of glue on
the thermistor/leads and rotated the mess around to form a hardened glob of
glue big enough in diameter so that a 3/16 ID tube would form an
interference fit over it and also made sure that the glob was not over the
actual thermistor, but over the soldered part. I formed a very thin layer of
epoxy over the thermistor by doing this. I think this helps with the
temperature sensing response of the thermistor although the mass of glue
over the leads has some negative effect but not a big deal in my opinion. I
wanted to slide the tube over the glue glob to form a tight seal and the
tube goes through the freezer wall protecting the leads. I installed the
temperature probe and soldered the leads to the board (where the old
thermistor was). Before I did all this I satisfied myself that the
thermistors were the same by comparing the resistances with a digital
multimeter. I am very familiar with this particular thermistor since I use a
similarly made probe for all my mashes by reading resistance and using
calibration curves made from the calibration data on the back of the
thermistor package. Once I assembled and soldered the leads to the board, I
calibrated the unit by soaking the probe in an ice bath(with some salt) and
made sure the unit read 32 degrees(actually 33 with occasional 32 deg
showing on the display). The set n save has a pot for calibration. Mine
didn't really need much fiddling to get it right. 


The wiring of the TRR takes a little creativity to make it neat. Mine is
wired so that the existing freezer thermostat is still operational which is
set at the highest setting(highest temp) so that if my thermostat fails, the
resulting beer sickles will be not as hard as they could be.  If I were to
do it over, I would make a plug in/plugout box rather than try to make an
integral installation. By doing so, you could easily take the unit from cold
box to cold box.


Everything is working good. I have the unit set at 40 deg F (I do like cold
beer!). Temperature varies from 39 to 41 deg F(unit kicks on after 12
seconds when 42 deg is reached). When I get ready to lager, it will be
simple to set my desired lagering temperature. The set n save will also
accept a time/day based temperature schedule although I have yet to find a
real use for this unless the feature could be used to gradually reduce the
fermentation temperature of a lager over a period of a week or less.  Hope
this helps. Have fun!

Subject: Air Ionizers and Sanitation


     Hi All,
     
     I was wondering the other day, are air ionizers beneficial to 
     sanitation.  Would the presence of one tend to reduce the possibility 
     of airborne contamination?  They apparently work by flooding the air 
     with negatively charged ions which attach themselves to dust, smoke 
     (and bacteria?) then rush towards the nearest postively charged 
     surface such as walls, ceilings, and appliances where they stick like 
     magnets.  This scrubbing action would seem to reduce some of the 
     airborne contaminents that are present when preparing yeast starters 
     or around open cooled wort.  Just curious.

Subject: 5 liter mini kegs




        Has anyone out there had success using a 5 liter mini keg setup
     with the CO2 bulb dispenser?  I wanted to know how to use one
     correctly before putting another batch of beer in one and finding that
     I can't get it to work right.


        I tried twice before - once with rootbeer and once with a
     strawberry ale.  The rootbeer came out very carbonated at first - it
     filled the glass with foam and left only 1 inch of pop after the foam
     settled - overkill!.  However, after the pop had settled, the
     remaining rootbeer was flat.  I turned down the serving pressure and
     ran a little out, then tried again.  Less foam evolved after lowering
     the pressure, and the pop came out in a steady stream with a nice head
     on it.  I thought I had it right, but the same thing happened - it
     went flat within 5 minutes of serving.  I had bottled the rest of the
     rootbeer batch for comparison, it was great.  The bottled rootbeer had
     a good head on it, but held the carbonation much better - it didn't go
     flat after 5 minutes.  Therefore, I proved to myself that there was
     something wrong with the keg and not the rootbeer.  I used rootbeer
     first because it is very cheap to make, I didn't want to mess up a
     precious batch of beer on the first try with the new kegs - good thing
     I didn't!


        I then tried with a batch of strawberry ale, which I later found to
     be infected.  The bottled strawberry ale had a good carbonation level,
     and had good head retention.  The kegged strawberry ale was the same
     as the kegged rootbeer - the head quickly disappeared, and the beer
     tasted flat within 5 minutes.  Of course, in either form, the
     strawberry ale was infected and tasted like s*&t!  Even though it was
     infected, the bottled form stayed carbonated longer - so I concluded
     again that it was the fault of the keg as far as carbonation problems
     were concerned.


        I want to try again , but am seeking advice first.  Can anyone out
     there give me some advice on how to use one of these with good results
     - or if it is even possible to get good results from them?  Yes, I
     know, buy a real kegging system ....   I am building a home-brewery in
     my basement and don't have the money right now - and I bought the kegs
     awhile ago and wish to get some of my moneys worth out of them.  Maybe
     I am using the wrong amount of priming sugar, or my serving pressure
     is adjusted incorrectly.  Are there any other tricks, like using more
     hops for better head retention or only using mini kegs for heavier
     bodied or lightly carbonated styles?  Please ...., someone .., I'm
     losing my mind!!!!

Okay, the reason I initially asked was that someone was saying it's special 
because it's been crytallized, and that makes it super-pure.  In fact, they
specifically said not to use regular table sugar because it wasn't pure enough.
This strikes me as, well, silly, now that I bother to think about it.  


On the other hand, when I was initially brewing, I had all kinds of people tell
me to -never- use table sugar, and only use corn sugar if I wanted to add pure
sugar.  So, what's the "real" story?  Is this just another example of Belgians
breaking the rules and getting great results?  I've been told that sucrose
adds "off" flavors that glucose doesn't.  Are these flavors important to some 
styles?  Is there something magical about larger crystals that makes them work
better for these styles?

It's American Scientific and Surplus, I thought.  Whichever.  I have pH strips
from there, and they're as good as any I've ever tried.  Which is to say -
not that good.  I can only read them to within a half a pH or so on a good 
day.  YMMV.


One thing I will say, though, is that AS&S is one of the greatest stores on 
the planet.  If you live in Chicago, or visit Chicago and have a couple hours,
definately go check them out.  I buy loads of stuff for brewing and my other
hobby (DIY stereo, with vacuum tubes and all that) at the store, as well as 
tons of toys and other weird crap.  Just browsing the store is loads of fun.
Order from the catalog if you see something you need, but there's always more 
stuff in the store than the catalogs.  Definately worth a side-trip now and 
then.

Pectin is a saccharidic (i.e. sugar) polymer, not a protein.  The
enzyme pectinase helps to break pectin into its constituent sugars.
I'm not sure if pectinase is commercially available or not.

Subject: Any experience with QUOIN "Party Pig"?


Richard Nantel asked for input (in HBD #1930 (01/09/96)) about
the pros and cons of Mini vs Corney Kegs. 


I am also new to HBD and am similarly considering buying a
kegging system.  My apologies to all if I expand this topic a
bit, but in addition to the Mini and Corney kegs, has anyone out
there had experience with the QUOIN "Party Pig"?  The
manufacturer tells me that a growing number of brewpubs are using
the party pigs to sell beer off-site to their regular customers. 
I would think that these "Pigs" must be durable if they are used
by brewpubs and that they must keep beer fresh for at least a few
weeks (unlike the Mini kegs which I'm told beer gets flat if not
consumed within a week or so).  However my local homebrew supply
store won't carry the party pig explaining that he the Pig uses
less than industrial grade materials (read "plastic") and that he
had heard (secondhand) that they leak.  I'm leaning toward the
Pig due to space limitations (they supposedly fit in a mini-
fridge) and the relatively low price (roughly $82 for 2 Pigs and
all accessories).  Yet, I'm nervous about wasting my money on a
products I've heard so little about.  Any input + or - would be
appreciated.


BTW - I did attempt to research this using the Archive files
before posting, but I'm not familiar with the type of files or
compression method used in the Archive files (i.e. "1995ind.z"). 
Pardon my ignorance but can any point me in the right direction?

Do you also open-ferment lagers (if you make lagers)? I do open fermentation
with certain top-cropping strains (ales, weizens, etc.), but wouldn't
recommend it for bottom-croppers for various reasons, including: 1) not much
of a mat to protect the wort from airborne contaminants, 2) the lager fridge
is full of these nasty critters, 3) lager strains ferment more slowly,
making contamination more of a potential problem. Personally, I haven't
noticed any differences in quality between ales produced using open and
closed fermentations, which can be attributed to the open fermentation.
Since you don't really want to get into the 'whys', I'll keep my question
simple. Would you please describe the improvements in quality you've noted
in your open-fermented beers? Thanks.

Excellent! Yes, I'd certainly like the reference and I'm glad to see others
contributing to this discussion. This post gives me the opportunity to
expound a bit on this rather obscure subject. This is where we get into the
exceptions to the rule and some minor biochemical pathways. It is
well-documented that Saccharomycetes do utilize oxygen during fermentation
(if it's available). However, the overwhelming majority of this O2 is used
in biosynthesis of ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids, not as the final
electron acceptor in respiration. OTOH, in the glucose repressed state,
yeast in aerobic culture are actually "respiro-fermentative", meaning that
both respiration and fermentation occur simultaneously, although to a very
limited extent. This may be the source of the common misconception that
yeast respire upon pitching. However, only a very small (essentially
negligible) amount respiration occurs in the presence of available sugars,
and the vast majority of enzymes involved in respiration are strongly
down-regulated (mitochondria are also rather small and poorly developed)
during glucose repression. This "leaky" control of expression allows carbon
to enter the biosynthetic pathways through the most efficient route. So now
we have three different modes for our yeast: 1) respiro-fermentative in the
presence of glucose and O2 (=aerobic fermentation), 2) fermentative in the
absence of O2 (=anaerobic fermentation), and 3) 'diauxic' in the presence of
O2 and ethanol and the absence of sugar (=respiration).

>>I am looking forward to Tracy's paper.

>Me too.  Where will we find it?


I'll post it to the digest and r.c.b, then I'll download it to the Brewery.
Since I have a day job and am preparing two 'real' manuscripts for
publication at this time, I'm lagging behind a little on the yeast article,
but it's coming.

Actually, I think "(More O2 => more propagation => more yeasties => shorter
lag)" is basically true, but I'd just like to add that not only is it
generally inferred in the homebrewing literature that O2 is needed for yeast
growth/reproduction (it isn't), but that this O2 is deemed necessary because
the yeast MUST respire in order to grow. This is patently false and I
believe is where the real problem lies and folks get confused. S. cerevisiae
is one of the few species of yeast which has absolutely no requirement for O2.




and finally, korz`at`pubs.ih.att.com (Algis R Korzonas) says:
[snip]

Saccharomyces species do not exhibit the Pasteur effect. In fact, they
exhibit what is called the reverse-Pasteur effect. When a fermenting culture
is given an excess of O2 the yeast actually ferment faster, instead of
switching to respiration. The more O2 you give them, the faster they ferment
and produce ethanol and CO2 (to a point), but with sugar available they
don't respire. The best way to study oxygen consumption in yeasts is to use
a chemostat. In a chemostat culture, one can get yeast to respire at
incredibly high levels if sugar is limiting and O2 is in excess
(particularly if the medium is supplemented with certain organic acids).
However, once glucose is introduced, ethanol is produced instantly. It is
virtually impossible to get yeast to respire in the presence of abundant
sugars (eg. wort).

I'd like to know how cold is too cold for Wyeast's Scottish Ale yeast.


I have a batch of "wee heavy" Scottish Ale (O.G. 1.076) that's been 3 or 4
weeks in the secondary.  All visible signs of fermentation have stopped,
but I don't know if this is because it's done, or because the temperature
in the brewing cupboard has dropped to 12-13 deg. C (53-55 deg. F).  It
fermented vigourously in the primary, but it was warmer in the cupboard
then, about 16 or 17 deg. C, from which the temperature has dropped
gradually.


I could find only one brief reference to Wyeast Scottish Ale yeast on the
whole web, including searching through the ftp.stanford.edu brewing
archive.  I haven't been able to search the HBD archives because the search
engine linked to from Spencer's Beer Page
(http://www-personal.umich.edu/~spencer/beer/) is down.


Does anyone know, either from datasheets or personal experience, how cold
this yeast can remain active?  Or even the typical attenuation, so I can at
least take a gravity reading and make a guess as to whether it's finished?

Subject: Good service from Quoin, too


Hello.  A friend of mine forwarded me the post praising customer
service at HopTech.  This inspired me to write in about the service I
got from Quoin Industries, the manufacturer of the Party Pig minikeg
system.  The two times I called them, they were very helpful.  


The first time was a technical issue.  When filling my pig for the
second time, I inserted the pressure pouch into the Pig upside-down by
mistake, and it did not inflate.  I called the number listed in
directory assistance (303 279-8731), hoping that someone there could
give me some advice.  They did!  The man I talked to was very
knowledgable (he may have been the Pig's inventor for all I know), and
he told me that all I had to do was turn the Pig upside down after
pressurizing it and the pouch would inflate.  Apparently the chemicals
in the pressure pouch weren't mixing because gravity was pulling the
wrong way.  I took his advice and everything was fine---and the beer
was good.


The second time I called, I was inquiring about replacing the Pig
itself (ie. the PET container), because I had deformed the original
one by rinsing it with near-boiling water (yes, a stupid idea).  They
were willing to send me a replacement for only $9.50, which seems
pretty good considering that the whole set-up costs about $40.


Anyway, I haven't dealt with any other kegging hardware or service
reps, but I'm very satisfied with both the Party Pig system and
Quoin's service.

     Jack S. has posted recently about making a hop tea and adding after 
     one week in the fermenter. I took in a tour this past year of the

     the hot wort through this as a hop back. I hope I am remembering the 
     process correctly. This seems very similar to what Jack was saying. 
     Shipyards beers, though good, are not my favorites and some have a 
     fair hop bite and very good aroma.
     
     On fruit beer:
     I had a thought about doing something similar to above with a fruit 
     beer. Is it possible to stew at a moderate temperature and add that to 
     your beer after the first few days in the primary? The pectin 
     shouldn't set and you don't have to worry about straining the spent 
     fruit out of the fermenter. Any fruit beer afficianados out there care 
     to comment?
