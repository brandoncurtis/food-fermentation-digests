I for one will vouch for the fact that aeration (oxygenation) after 
the onset of vigorous fermentation will cause aldehyde production.
I had a nice English brown that I brewed during the "dropping" thread
a while back.  As soon as vigorous fermentation kicked in, I racked 
while aerating (my misinterpretation of the thread) and ended up with 
an unintentional brown apple ale, the aroma was almost exactly like 
the smell of green apples.  AVOID AERATION DURING FERMENT!!!!!
By the way, the beer was not ruined, just different.  8^)


But remember that aeration and open ferments are NOT related:


As a convert to partially open fermentation (foam spraying from an airlock 
gets the spousal unit pissed off, so I cover the hole in my primary with 
a styrofoam plate, then the foam just drips down the sides), the layer 
of krauesen and the CO2 produced by the ferment shroud the beer so that 
O2 cannot get to the surface to aerate it, and airborne nasties just 
float on the foam.  Upon the end of primary fermentation, you rack the 
beer out from under the nasty-laden foam into a closed secondary 
fermenter.


In the same issue, Tracy says:

Tracy, does this mean that S. uvarum HAS an O2 requirement?

I have used the Venturi (or is it Bernoulli?) style aerating tube for 
a number of brews, but mine differs from that which A.J. describes in 
HBD 1934(?):


A. J. deLange writes:

My tube is a short piece of rigid, clear plastic tubing through which 
I put a bunch of holes.  I cut a 4 inch piece off an old racking cane 
and with a heated pin (I assume no respon....) I poked about 6 or 8 
holes through the sides of the tube.  The tube is placed in line 
below the level of the bottom of the kettle.  


My logic in the tubes placement is that a hole at the curve would make 
a siphon lose vacuum.  With the lower placement, the velocity of the 
wort when it is below the base of the kettle really pulls in a lot of 
air (it actually is kind of noisy).  Also, if you have a kettle with 
drain on it, operating a syphon would present a whole new 
challenge.  8^)

Only in Belgian breweries!  At Victory we use a tiled room that has air
filtered and SS tanks chilled by glycol.  In Germany the open ferment
rooms are extremely clean.  The UK breweries Ive been to are between
the two extremes.  (In my basement, there are cob webs over the fermenter).

I did a little test comparing table sugar, corn sugar and invert sugar
and their effects on flavour.  It turns out that... you'll have to buy
my book to find out.  Ha!  Just kidding, sort of.


No, I found that the corn sugar (glucose) gave a slightly less cidery aroma
and flavour than the invert and sucrose, which were close.  However, my
suspicion is not so much that the sugar causes cideryness, but rather
that the lack of nutrients from using excessive sugar perhaps causes the
yeast to make more acetaldehyde than it would if there was enough FAN
in the wort.  Testing continues...


Meanwhile, if my theory above is right, then a wort that is jam-packed
with FAN should be able to support a strong dose of "empty calories"
without problems.  Furthermore, with most Belgian Ales having very
assertive aromas (everything from bananas to bubblegum to cloves to
plums...), a small amount of cidery aromas and flavous would probably
be hidden by the yeast and Special B, no?


Just a theory.

I don't recall what Jeff's technique was for aeration, but quality of
aeration does not have to be tied to any type of fermentation method.
Aeration before fermentation is good, aeration during fermentation
increases diacetyl levels (which may be good or bad depending on your
yeast and the style which you are brewing) and aeration after fermentation
is done can oxidize alcohols into aldehydes which taste and smell awful
("morning-after kegger party dispensed with air pump beer" flavour (tm)).


Unless you let your beer sit in an open fermenter for weeks after
fermentation is over, you should not have any problems with aldehydes.
Also, while fermentation is going, there is a blanket of CO2 that covers
the beer.  Once the fermentation is over, the CO2 inevitably mixes with
the room air (that's just how gasses are -- heavier than air doesn't mean
that it stays in the container like a liquid -- it's the physics of gasses)
and no longer do you have that protection.  I would keep the lid on the
fermenter throughout the ferment anyway, just to prevent things from
falling in.  Once the kraeusen falls, wait two or three days and then
either rack to a keg or to a secondary to finish clearing.  As usual,
minimize splashing during transfer.


***
Pectinase should be available through usual homebrewing supply sources.
If your local supplier does not have it, ask them to get it from their
wholesalers.  I know L.D.Carlson has it.  Wherever you buy it, make
sure it is refrigerated -- this stuff is ruined when not refrigerated 
for a significant length of time.  I would assume that summer shipping
would be a definite no-no.

Thanks.  Eventually my brain engaged and I realised the polysaccharidic

O2 cylinders have a specific outlet type designed only to
fit an oxygen regulator (type CGA 540, should be marked 'Oxygen').  
This is because grease, dust and other marginally flammable materials 
become dangerously flammable when in the presence of pure oxygen.  
Compressed air, for example, often contains oil mist
from the compressor, which could burn quite nicely in 100% O2.


So, never use or adapt a regulator, valve or tubing that was once used for
another gas (or any other purpose), to use with pure O2. 


Maybe it would be sensible to immerse your airstone in (wet) wort before
turning the gas on. 


Furthermore, use of oxygen by anyone should be subject to 
some sensible precautions, e.g.


  Don't vent oxygen from your sparging operation next to your 
  propane burner, electrical equipment, furnace, small children,
  vodka, pet fish, etc. etc.  Keep a window open at least, and maybe 
  disperse the excess oxygen using a fan.  


Other precautions may be necessary.  Take a little care.  
Good beer is possible without conflagration (tm).

Subject: Carbon monoxide from propane:


Recent discussion leads me to point out that CO (carbon monoxide)
is more typically generated when inadequate ventilation leads to
a lack of O2 and build up of CO2 (carbon dioxide) in the combustion 
area.  Incomplete combustion results, leading to (toxic) CO production.
(Yellow flames also tend to produce CO).  Either way, you're in trouble.
Excess CO2 with adequate oxygen can also cause problems.


(Some recent posts implied that all propane/NG flames produce unacceptable
CO levels which must then be vented.  This is kinda backwards.  So flame me).

At the risk of starting a really gross thread, here goes nothing.


Has anyone out there in HBD land discovered a cure/preventative for
the personal emission of methane that seems to always accompany 
(with a time lag) drinking homebrew? In my case, it is orders of 
magnitude worse for homebrew than for commercial swill. This problem 
is really lessening my enjoyment of brewing (not to mention upsetting my wife).
Is it because of the yeast perhaps?

(Al explained how hotter sparge temps were just more likely to

My comment is basically re-iterating something JS said a *long* 
time ago, and was poo poo-ed for ..  that your sparge water can 
be ALOT hotter than 168, but that dosen't mean your *grain bed* 
will be ..  which is, after all, where all the action is.  


Just last weekend I made a Pale Ale with sparge water just off 
the boil.  I had done a Mashout and got the mash up to maybe 
70-72 degrees C, then started sparging (after recirculating a 
couple of litres).  At no point during my sparge did the grain 
bed go above 72 degC and in fact by the end of the sparge parts 
of the grain bed were down to 68.  I started using v.hot sparge 
water when I measured the temp of the grain bed during a previous 
sparges and it was getting as low as 58 degC.  


The important thing to stress is this is for my system, which is 
not terribly well insulated (a copper manifold in a 50L 
rectangular cooler), but it's worth checking the temps of your 
grain bed in your system to see if you need to use hotter sparge 
water.

I know a guy who was an Engineer in Saudi, he said that they used 
to bring in beer kits whenever they came back from overseas, and 
get everyone they knew to bring in "the makings".  Apparently 
they were allowed to brew it in their "compound" (I guess they 
were working somewhere a bit out of the way) and drink it in 
their houses, but not in public.  They certainly weren't brewers 
of any great skill, and he said it tasted pretty grim but they 
were grateful for anything!  


A mate of mine from Iran said they used to have a drink there 
which he claims tasted exactly like Guinness but without the 
alcohol (i suppose they distill it off).  


Anyone know about this beverage?

I think it's a matter of semantics, and of fermenter geometry.
If it's in an open fermenter, even with a lid on it, it's
open.  It really does make sense, if you look at the configuration
of your possibilities.


A cylindro-conical fermenter (most common thing to see in a 
micro or brewpub), it's clearly closed -- that is, completely
contained.  Same with a carboy, whether the hole is up or down;
the fermenter is clearly contained.


Open fermentation has to do with the shape (wide and wide
open, and with access.  In an open fermenter, even one with a 
loose-fitting lid, you can skim, you can dip, whatever, and
well, it's different.

What I don't fully understand is why it's taking Jack 10 days
to reach a stage that isn't even completely clear.  In 10 days,
I'm drinking my beer.

There is no discrepancy that I can see.  I get great aeration because
I have access to the wort when it runs into the fermenter.  I sanitize
a stainless steel kitchen whip, lean into the fermenter and beat
the wort into a froth.  Then I pitch a good starter and set a lid
on the fermenter (it sits very loosely, and in fact has gotten
moved around by rising CO2 from time to time).


Some of the Brit homebrewers maintain that this arrangement is
necessary for an exchange of O2 during primary fermentation, but
I'm skeptical; it's hard to believe any exchange could take 
place through 3 inches or more of high krausen -- but??

I haven't done any lagers in quite a while, but I suspect it
would depend.  I've used a few strains that seemed to produce
a distinct krausen, and they might work.  I *believe* I've
seen photographs in old texts of lager breweries that did
their primary open, but don't quote me on it.

Difficult to define, really, other than that the beer just tastes
better.  The main thing, for me, is that I'm finally able to 
aerate the wort properly, and am getting fermentations that mimic
those in commercial situations.  There's also an aesthetic value,
which is personal -- I love watching those huges rocky heads
develop.  I know I can taste a difference in the beer since I
switched but I don't know for certain whether the improvement in
flavor is directly linked to fermenter geometry or simply to
the change in fermentation time.

Silly isn't the word.  Idiotic is more accurate.  Sucrose, whether as
rock candy or table sugar, is thoroughly refined.  The *only* 
difference is the size of the crystals -- little, tiny ones in the
sugar bowl and great big ones on the string.

Lots of mis-information out there about sugar.  The Belgians and
the Brits use a variety of sugars; very little of it is corn sugar (if
any).  Some of the sugar is sucrose, some invert sugar, some
caramelized sugars; there are no rules, per se.  Sucrose does seem
to benefit the development of a tight, dense head in conjunction with
high carbonation (see various Belgian beers and Cooper's Ale); it
does allow higher alcohol with a drier finish; and it does allow

Subject: yeast metabolism


I am probably not fully appreciating the chatter on yeast
metabolism, but some of it may be sinking in. So, I'd like
to pose a question which, in light of the discussion, I hope
makes sense.


I recall a discussion several months ago about the proper
stage of yeast 'growth' at which to pitch a starter. There
were two schools of though, I also recall. One that you
should pitch at high krausen when the glycogen level was
highest, and the other that you should pitch just after the
krausen falls. No flames if this is wrong, I'm pulling this
from the remaining brain cells in my head.


Now to get to the question. It seems to me that starters
are used to build up the cell count needed for healthy
fermentation given the quantity of work to do (i.e., sugar
to ferment). Once that is achieved, it seems that the
starter should be pitched just after the oxygen is used to
fully develop the cell walls (which is what I gathered from
the metabolism discussion) rather than after fermentation
activity is underway. In other words, once you have enough
cells, you want to get them through the stage that *prepares*
them for fermentation rather than getting them into the
fermentation stage. Can one of the biologists in the crowd
comment on the best time to pitch in light of the yeast
metabolism discussion currently underway.

Sorry no one posted Mike. I'll have a go.
 With you Russian Imperial I see no grain problems that I know of and the EM
is clear of blame.
The following suggestions apply to both beers.
1/Try a coarser grind, it will have no discernable effect on your extraction.
2/Check your pH. Lowest viscosity for proteins is at their "isoelectric
point" (wait for my upcoming "Protein FAQ" for more details) which for
barley proteins is practically 5.2 -5.4. For the Imperial, the dark malts
should rule out pH problems as they have an acidifying action. For the
wheat, a 37-40C "acid rest" will help acidify through the action of  phytase
releasing phytic acid. This rest is also a B-glucan rest for breaking down
gums which can cause your problems. However if you use the 104F rest for
both beers, that shouldn't be a problem., perhaps extend it, especially for
wheat.
3/ A protein rest at 47-52C *would* help as you are using some European
grains which are usually not as well modified as US malts. With a wheat, I
think it is a must.
4/ Watch hot mash aeration with the wheat, the O2 can cause some high
molecular weight proteins (wheat is full of them) to form bonds that gum up
the sparge.
5/ Stir the mash, then let settle for 20 minutes before runoff to set the
bed slowly.
6/ Pre mash underletting is unneccessary with an EM.
7/ Most texts recommend a decoction with wheat, (the protein problem) but few
homebrewers want to go to the trouble.
8/ Thickness of mash? Are you close to 1.3 qts/lb?
9/ If a mash sticks, try "underletting", i.e. running sparge water back
through the EM to
lift the bed.


I hope this helps. My bet is grind or thickness.

Tom Gaskell sent e-mail describing his aeration device as follows:

This was easily fabricated (8 holes) from the racking cane I had ruined in
my earlier experiment. Some water was placed in a 15 gal stockpot with
valve and 1/2" compression fitting which mated to the aerator with the
plastic tubing which came with the racking cane. This water was
deoxygenated to 22% to simulate the amount of oxygen picked up during
cooling with an imersion chiller which is, I presume, the method Tom is
using. That's a big lie. Deoxygenating the water is a PIA. I came up with
the simulation idea to justify quitting when I got to 22%. When the valve
was opened and the water collected in a bucket at floor level (the stock
pot was at counter level) it measured 49%. I believe that the problem is
that, while a lot more air was sucked in with this arrangement, the bubbles
are not tiny enough.

Phil's recipe:


> Let me give you an example. I'm putting together a Pale Ale (10 gallons)

If I simplify his recipe to 16 lbs pale ale and 3 lbs 20L crystal, use
36 ppg and 31 ppg for yield, respectively, I should get:


1.058 from the pale ale         From the data above, for pale ale malt
1.009 from the 20L crystal      fg = .065 og, and for the 20L crystal,
- --------------------------      fg = .46 og.  Using these numbers with
1.067 og (at 100% efficiency)   the og's at left I get:


        58 * .065 = 3.8 and 9 * .46 = 4.1, for a total fg = 8


Note that these figures indicate the pale ale contributes half of what
Phil computed as the contribution to final gravity.  Personally, I'd
guess that 1.010 would be closer to the actual number you'd get!


One major problem here is that the fg data I've given is all over the
board, due mostly I think to differences in aeration of the wort used
in each test.  What I've taken to doing as a workaround until I have
unlimited spare time on my hands is to simply do a batch then increase
the percentage of crystal and lower the pale to maintain the same og
while boosting the fg (trial and error).  Kind of a long post...sorry.

I prefer the 6 gal carboy, partly because I brew all-grains and I 
end up with 5.5 gals.  The other difference is you'll blow off with 
the 5 gal, rarely with the 6(assuming a 5 gal batch) .  I'd be interested 
in the feedback regarding removing the krausen or letting it fall 
back in. I've been happier with the beers where I let it fall back in.

Subject: Boiling/Diacetyl


Irwin Gelman commented on spores and boiling. It is indeed true that only
the Bacilli and Clostridia sporulate (I even checked specifically to see if
Pedios could do it since they survive not only boiling but autoclacving -
they don't) but it is not true that an hour's boil will kill all spores.
Thus Tyndalisation in which the medium is boiled to kill bacteria then
allowed to sit 24 hours while the spores germinate, then boiled again to
kill the bacteria which sprang from the spores. Three cycles of boiling
will essentially sterilize the medium.


Curt Speaker asked how to get more diacetyl. Diacetyl is a byproduct of
valine synthesis and valine has an inhibitory effect on its production so
that one way to increase its yield is to ferment a valine poor wort. As
most of us can't control the amount of particular amino acids in our worts
we would have to fiddle with methods like under pitching and under aeration
which have other detrimental effects. Thus, IMO, the best approach is to
use a yeast strain which is an above average diacetyl producer. I believe
this is the secret of Pilsner Urquell: one of the five strains reportedly
used is a big diacetyl thrower. I cannot recommend one but as diactyl is
quite allowable in scotch ales I would expect the strains that normally
used for these beers to meet this criterion. Greg Noonan specifically
mentions #1084 and also #1338 as being suitable from this point of view.


Second, follow the protocols for brewing Scotch Ales. Higher fermentation
temperature will enhance diacetyl production but this is diametrically
opposed to the philosophy behind Scotch Ale and leads to fusels and esters
as well as higher diacetyl. Perhaps starting at a warmer temperature and
then lowering to a cooler one for the remainder of the fermentation then
plummeting to a very low one (so that there is no opportunity for the
yeaast to resorb and reduce any diacetyl formed) might work.

size bag you might need. Of course it looks kinda funny when a guy is in 
a cloth shop buying wedding veil, but you'll survive. And when you tell 
them you're using it brew beer, they'll immediately know you're not a 
flit-boy! I'd recommend buying enough to make it double-layered. Good Luck!

The reason I would not recommend plastic of any kind is that is
dangerous.  Sure, caution about never running dry is good, but I have
done it once.  I could have burned down my garage if I had been using
a plastic heater chamber.  I would not recommend brass *mostly* due to
its flimsiness and lack of fittings other than drain type fittings.
And of course, I am not overly fond of the leaching issue either, but
have no evidence for it.  My biggest objection is due to mechanical
properties.  It may work, but *I* would not recommend it.
