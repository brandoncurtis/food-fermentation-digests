I also had the same experience two weeks ago :') While brewing a Nut Brown
Ale, A honey bee would not let me increase the flow rate of my sparge. I
would chase it away and seconds later it would re-land on my flow regulator.
I thought it was an omen so I primed this batch with a cup of Honey. Down
here in Texas, I'm just thankful it was not Killer Bees heading north :-)

Subject: Alcohol reduction




First, hats off to Bruce DeBolt for doing the experiments on alcohol
reduction by freezing.  There seems to be a lot of hands-on
experimentation going on among the HBD readership these days. It's
looking as though the HBD is setting the standards for homebrewing
technology,  more so than any 'official' homebrew organization.


Although Bruce's results are disappointing (for those looking for a
simple alcohol reduction technique), they are not at all surprising.
The problem is that alcohol and water do not separate completely when
they freeze or boil. When an alcohol-water mixture is boiled, the
vapor being lost is not pure alcohol, but has a significant
concentration of water.  For example, boiling a 5% alcohol solution
produces a vapor which is 37% alcohol, 63% water.  You're removing
more water than alcohol!  Thus, by the time you've removed 90% of the
alcohol, you've also removed a great deal of water (for example Bruce
reports loss of 30% total volume).  The same deal goes for freezing,
the stuff that doesn't freeze is not pure alcohol, but a water-alcohol
mix, with the percentage of alcohol in the liquid fraction being
higher than it is in the slush.


One way to overcome this is via "fractional" distillation, in which
the solution is frozen once, the liquid separated from the slush, and each
of these two separate fractions is then partially refrozen, and the
liquid portions drawn off.  The two liquid portions are combined, as
are the two frozeen portions.  This process is repeated over and over,
until eventually one has one fraction with mostly alcohol, and another
which is mostly non-alcoholic beer.  But I imagine this is too much
trouble for most of us.

angelica herbs and root
fresh, ground together------32 parts
cinnamon--------------------16 parts
saffron--------------------- 4 parts

subject the above ingredients to maceration for a week with alcohol (96 
percent), 1000 parts, then squeeze off and distill the liquid obtained 
overn the same certain quantity of fresh herbs and hyssop.  After 125 
parts of sugar have benn added to the resultant liqueur, filter.


The genuine chartreuse comes in three different colors, viz, green, white 
and yellow.  The coloration, however is not artificial but is determined 
by the addition of varying quantities of fresh herbs in the 
distillation.  But since it would require long and tedious trials to 
produce the right color in a small manufacture, the yellow shade is best 
imparted by a little tincture of saffron, and the green one by the 
addition of a few drops of indigo solution for food.

Subject: Re: Aeration Cane


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Yikes! Since AJ was responding to a letter I'd sent him asking what
the DO from an aeration cane would be, I thought I would pipe in on
this newly revamped aeration cane thread. (Could we avoid the
Venturi/Bernoulli lessons this time, though? Please? Pretty
please?!?) In my note to AJ, I thought I had described how mine was
made, but, apparently, I had not as his description isn't quite like
the one that follows. 


Here's how I made mine...


Materials:


* One of those orange rubber carboy caps. The one with two tubes coming 
   from the top.
* A racking cane.
* Your siphon tube.


Procedure:


OK. Drill some holes about 14 inches from the bottom of the cane. I
drilled four holes at 90 degrees positions around the cane, 1/16"
dia, and at an angle of 135 degrees to the direction of flow (see
pitiful ASCII art to follow). I then drilled a second row about 3/8"
on center below the first, offset by 45 degrees around the cane, and,
again at 135 degrees to the flow. Saw off the 'hook' of the cane,
and put your siphon hose on it. Put the other end through the center
tube of the carboy cap, and attach a tube to the other port to carry
off the excess foam that will be generated (or, wait for the foam to
subside before continuing).


Now, keep the holes above the carboy cap, and it will draw air into
the wort stream, aerating your wort as you siphon. Works great.


Cheap ASCII art to follow. It is best viewed with a non-
proportionally spaced font, like Monospace 821 BT or any OCR font.

Subject: newbie kegger


Greetings all,
I recently purchased a keg setup (used keg, new co2 cyl, hoses seals & 
regulator) and have a few questions.
After bringing the keg home I replaced all of the o-ring seals on the gas in 
& beer out connections along with the ring on the dip tube and the big one 
on the lid. I then did an overnight soda ash soak to clean out the keg. The 
next evening (last night) I purged out the soda-ash solution, and rinsed the 
keg twice. Since I was about a week away from kegging (batch was transferred 
to secondary on Sunday night), I decided to test out the keg by making plain 
old seltzer water. I filled the keg to about 1 1/2 inches from the gas in 
tube, put it in the fridge and hit it with about 25 psi until I heard the 
gas stop running, then turned it down to 10 psi and left it on. Early this 
morning I decided to check on it before coming to work, Highly carbonated 
into the glass but went flat almost instantly. Looking at the gas gauges it 
seems that the high pressure guage dropped from 800 psi to just under 400 
psi, and was now reading in the "Order Gas Now" range on the dial.


Now the questions -
Is the gauge temp sensitive (reading lower after being chilled overnight)


DIHAGL/IMTE (do I have a gas leak/is my tank empty) ? I don't think so, 
since I checked all of the fittings with soapy water before putting the 
whole thing into the fridge.


When force carbonating should I leave the gas on, or hit it with pressure 
then turn it off.


Anyway I turned off the gas and am letting it sit until I get home tonight.


                                                        TIA
                                                             Alex


  ...
    7:30 am at work, too early for a homebrew, early enough to start 
worrying.

Subject: Skimming an Open Ferment


Hello All,


It would seem that we have an open fermentation thread going, so let me 
perpetuate.  I now have a Scottish Export Ale in strong open fermentation 
with Wyeast 1084.  As per recent suggestions, I skimmed the trub off 
the krauesen layer once per day until no further trub appeared (only 2 
days).  Being unafraid of anything beer and in the quest for knowledge, I 
tasted some of the trub-laden foam.  It was the most intensely bitter 
substance I've ever had the displeasure of tasting.  That started me 
thinking...how does skimming impact hop bitterness levels in the finished 
beer?  Logic would seem to say that bitterness would be decreased.  I've been 
very pleased with the previous bitterness levels in my beer, but my former 
method of fermentation allowed the trub to fall back in the beer.  Will I 
have to adjust IBUs in the future to compensate for the decrease in 
bitterness related to skimming??  


This batch is a pseudo-replicate of a previous recipe, so some direct 
comparison may be possible, but it's definitely not a controlled experiment.  
FWIW, this ferment smells better than any I've done previously---very fruity 
and aromatic.  Brew on,


Tim


PS  Someone asked about commercial bottle-conditioned beer.  I know Kalamazoo 
Brewing uses corn sugar to prime their kegs, but I'm pretty sure they also 
prime the bottled beer with corn sugar as well.  Any Kzoo people out there to 
corroberate of refute this factoid??

Sounds a little kinky.  Seriously, what is the size of the whip?  If it 
is the sort of device I am thinking of (for whipping cream, etc.), it 
wouldn't go very deep into the wort (I think I am thinking of a whisk; is 
a whip different?).  Are you beating at the surface or 
am I off base?  Also, curious whether this is the primary/sole means of 
aeration, or whether you also pump in air/oxygen?

Subject: Stupid homebrewer tricks


The other night, I racked my pale ale into a keg.  I hooked up a
direct connection from the racking cane to a tap (plugged into the
liquid connector), and I purged the tank with CO2, trying to avoid all
possible aeration of the beer during racking.  I attached another tap
to the gas connector to vent CO2 while racking.


Then, I suffered a momentary lapse of intelligence, and decided to suck
on the hose attached to the gas connector to start the siphon.


DON'T DO THAT!!!!  When I stopped coughing, I realized that inhaling
pure CO2 is not good for me.

Subject: Re: caramel 


My favorite way to make caramelized sugar is this:


Put the desired quantity of sugar in a heavy saucepan.  Heat it on the
stove, *STIRRING CONSTANTLY* until it melts and browns to the desired
degree.  Pour out onto greased foil to cool.  DO NOT pour it into
water, as it can cause explosive boiling.


It takes a bit of practice to do this reliably, and it's easier on a
gas stove where you can control the heat quickly, but I find it works
a lot better for me than trying to boil off a small quantity of water
to get to the caramel stage.  Note that there's only a small
(temperature) interval between the melting point and burning point of
sugar, so constant stirring is essential, as is proper heat
regulation.

Subject: Primary fermenter only - autolysis, flavor info request


Due to some recent problems with oxidation I've been re-thinking my whole
brewing process.  I believe the cause was a gradual accumulation of
sloppiness in transfer and lauter methods.   For all complacent brewers -
remember to transfer finished beer gently, don't add your priming sugar
solution on top of your racked beer because you forgot to do it before
siphoning, watch for air entrainment in the drain hose from your lauter
tun, make sure you have a good connection between your racking cane and
racking hose (air can get in there).   The previous sentence covers both
hot side aeration and oxidation of alcohol problems.  All obvious stuff,
but apparently one or more of these got me.  End result was beer that
tasted great at bottling, then deteriorated rapidly.   This problem was
caught because I submitted an entry to a contest and received my lowest
score ever.  I learned that detecting oxidation early on was not in my
tasting repetoire.  It helps to have someone else evaluate your beer.  


The problems may have been a blessing in disguise.  I made a batch using
only a primary fermenter for the first time in years, to eliminate the
secondary racking step.  The time and hassle saving was significant.   I
will probably brew this way a lot more often in the future.


I would like to hear from brewers who have used a primary fermenter only
and let the beer sit more than a week.  My concerns are autolysis and any
other flavor affects.  Clarity is not an issue.   I use glass fermenters.  
 This topic has been covered in the past (I remember Al K. commenting on
it) but I didn't pay close attention since it didn't apply to my
procedures.  Will summarize and post the results. 
TIA.

I will second this opinion.  I generally heat my sparge water to near
boiling and rack it to a Gott cooler.  My lauter tun is not terribly
insulated, and I keep my thermometer in the center of the grain bed.
Using the hotter sparge water, which is probably only about 185 or less
when it gets to the grain, helps keep the grain temp from dropping too
far.

        Yes it will, thank you Feddo!


        So what have we learned about all of this so far?  One, wheat beers
     have better head retention - so try one of those.  Mini-kegs work
     great for beers with lower carbonation levels, but sparkling light
     bodied beers don't work very well - which was my main mistake. Higher
     hop levels give better head retention.  Finally, higher bodied (FG)
     beers have larger proteins, which help hold CO2 in solution.


        Keeping this in mind, it is time to start experimenting again.  All
     of you out there with mini-keg systems - lets give it a try using
     these guidelines.  Please keep me posted on your results. The more
     data points we have with the more variety of beers in them, the more
     we can learn.  Please let me know good and bad results.  Keep those
     responses coming!  To all of you readers with one of these 5 L
     mini-keg setups, speak up and let me know your results and styles
     used.


        Thank you to all who responded.  I hope this helps everyone.

No, it doesn't. I should have said "Saccharomyces species of yeast have no
O2 requirement". Sorry for the confusion.

I don't feel it's really necessary. I'm covered under the Berne convention

Here's another controversy I just can't pass up (I'm gearing up to review
the literature on this topic too). Without getting into the details of when
glycogen levels are highest (yet), I think the best time to pitch is when
the culture is at or near the peak of the log phase (after high kraeusen,
but before activity slows), assuming one has grown a large enough starter to
begin with. What's much more critical is the SIZE of the culture (i.e.
number of cells). Pitching a 'big enough' starter will help to overcome many
common problems and it's generally difficult for homebrewers to overpitch.
(BTW, oxygen is used in the synthesis of sterols which are then used in the
synthesis of membranes, NOT cell walls. This is an important distinction, as
these are two entirely different cellular structures.)

Subject: First Decoction attempt ...


I will soon be attempting to brew a Munich Dunkel.  I wanted to try a 
double decoction,  but my experience so far has been with directly-fired 
kettle mashing with an easy masher.  My grain bill is as follows:


4 lbs Ayinger Pils malt
1 lb D-C Cara Munich
1 lb Ayinger wheat
5 lbs Ayinger Munich




My proposed mashing schedule:


First decoction
- ---------------
1) Mix grains with 3.5 gals water and rest at 98 degrees for 15 minutes.


2) Remove thickest 40% of the mash.  In a separate kettle,  heat this 
decocotion to `at` 155F. and hold for 20 minutes.


3) Bring decoction to a boil.  Boil for 30 minutes,  stirring constantly.


4) Slowly return decoction to main mash,  raising main mash temp to `at` 122 
F.  Hold temp for 20 minutes


Second Decoction
- ----------------
1) Repeat steps 2 and 3 above.


2) Return decoction to main mash slowly to achieve a target temp of 
152-155 F.  Hold until starch conversion is complete (20 minutes to an 
hour?).


I'll mash out and sparge as usual.




Anyone tried this before?  If so,  how does this procedure look?  Am I 
missing anything important here?  Thanx in advance ...

Subject: Aerating racking canes & open fermenters


I use an aerating racking cane, but since I have a pump between the cane and
the CF wort chiller, I don't have the problem with breaking the siphon. My
guess is that as long as the holes in the cane are below the liquid level of
the boiling kettle, the siphon cannot be broken, because at that point the
liquid is moving by gravity, and not siphon. 


As I understand it, the principle working here is a venturi--just like the
fuel mixture in a carburator. Efficiency could be improved if the flow were
constricted, speeding up the flow of liquid. I don't have mt automotive book
handy, so I don't remember whether the constriction should be before or
after the holes. BTW, since I'm really proud of my new cane, and it works
really well, and since my non-brewing friends think I'm a lunatic, I've got
to show someone...

The 2 X's are a 1/4-in ball valve. I have a male flare fitting threaded into
the left side, and to that I use beverage tubing and fittings to attatch the
thing to the pump/CF wort-chiller.


1. This is a brass, 1/4-in. NPT Tee


2. This is a dial thermometer, 1-in. dial. I covered the upper portion of
the stem with clear tubing allowing me to fit it into a compression fitting.
The stem extends the length of the Tee, allowing the wort to bathe enough of
the tip to get a reading. (The tip is NOT covered in tubing) PLEASE NOTE: I
suspect the tubing will have to be changed regularly since the compression
ring had to be omitted. If anyone has a better idea for this connection, I'm
open for suggestions. 


3. This is a flared piece of 3/8-in. copper tubing that attaches to the Tee
with a flare fitting. The holes begin ~1/8-in. below the flare nut. The
holes are 1/16-in. and there are 12 of them, 3 rows of 4 holes each,
staggered. After drilling, clean out the inside with some type of reamer (a
drill bit will do), and then polish the inside with a strip of green 3M pad
chucked into a drill. The 1/16-in. holes work better than four 1/8-in holes.
I'm getting LOADS of foam.


This device came about after forgetting to turn up the cold water into my
wort-chiller, and pitching way too hot. Now, I always know the temp. Also,
with the shut-off valve, I can fill my hydrometer flask, turn it off, feed
my ready to pitch yeast to accomodate them to their new home, turn it off,
and then fill the fermenter. IOW, I like it.


I'll chime in quickly on the open fermenter thread: I'm using a 7 1/2-gal
budwizer keg (1/4-barrel), with an opening cut in the top to accept a
commercial stockpot lid. At kraeusen, I remove the lid, and take a hunk of
styrofoam (I've got a piece laying around) and lay it on top of the
keg--resting on the upper chine. Open fermentation without stuff floating in
it, and plenty of air flow.


Favorable brewing to all of you on the east coast, hope you all got some
extra brewing in!

Subject: CO Safety


I just wanted to share my experience brewing this past
weekend. I do my brewing in the garage and use a
Cajun Cooker type propane burner. I fired up the burner
to heat up my mash water and while it was going I
decided to check the CO in the garage with my new
CO detector (Nighthawk 2000). Now the burner was
was going full blast (nice blue flame) so I thought
there would be minimal CO produced. Well after
about 2 min. the detector was reading a level of
22, after 4 min. the level jumped to 40 and after
6 min. the level was over 60 (enough to set off the
alarm). I had the main garage door opened about
4 inches, no other doors or windows were open. After
the alarm went off, I opened the door which leads
into my backyard thus providing cross ventilation.
The CO level dropped to zero in about 5 min. and
stayed at zero. This just serves as another warning to
make sure you have adequate ventilation when
brewing in confined areas.

Just a thought....


In HBD #1937, Rich Hampo queried the collective regarding Personal Emission
of Methane (PEM).  Couldn't that be plainer stated as Flatulence
Accompanying Rigorous Tippage (you KNOW that acronym).  BTW, I think it does
have something to do with ingestion of live yeast.  There have been numerous
cases of people who have flatulence problems attributable to ingestion of
yeast.  I think there was even a show on TV (60 min. or 20/20) about it (no
accounting for my taste in prime time programming).  In the show, the
afflicted parties changed their diet (i.e. omitted the offending foodstuffs,
gads!).


If it really bothers you, you could perhaps try filtering your beer (which
most of the commercial breweries do).  The economical solution might be to
invest in an extra can of Lysol.

Subject: Blowoff yeast


In Papazian's 2nd book, he say that blow off yeast from the primary
fermentor is the most flocculant. This yeast may be collected for
re-pitching as follows:


Extra Equipment: 


2-hole gum stopper (#11?)
Mayonnaise jar


Procedure:


Sanitize everything. Attach the blow off hose from the carboy to the 2-holed
stopper. Put the airlock in the other hole. Put the stopper in the jar. 
(Ascii cheese to follow):    H=Blow off hose    A=Airlock


       HHHHHHHHHHHHHH
      _H_           H
     |   |          H   
     /   \          H    
    /     \         H   A 
   /       \        H   A
  |         |      _H___A_  
  |         |     _\H____/_
  |         |     | H     |
  |         |     |       |
  | carboy  |     |  jar  |
  ===========     =========


This allows the blow off yeast to be collected in the jar while remaining
sanitary.


A simpler method is to put two airlocks together with a bottle stopper and
place atop carboy. The lower airlock will fill with yeast and remain sanitary.


It works good for me so far. Comments?

Hi all,


Sorry my mailer bounced the last HBD back, I've always hated it when that
has happened to other people, and now it happened to me!  I guess I 
shouldn't have subscribed to windev-l then gotten myself snowed in 
(although I did make it to the BURP meeting!)


Now on to a brewing question.  I brewed a helles bock this last weekend I 
used wyeast #2206.  I popped the slap pack and let it swell at about 60 
degrees F.  The pack didn't swell as quickly as I had thought it would, so 
I didn't have time to make a starter before brew day.  I know it would be 
better to have put off brewing until a proper starter is made but with a 
six month old baby and low spousal approval, these things have to be 
scheduled well in advance.  Anyway, I pitched the yeast when the wort temp
came down to about 60 deg. and put the wort in my basement expecting it 
to be about 55 deg F.  The next day when I checked the ambient temp in the
basement was 40 deg. and the fermometer read 45 deg.  There was no activity
at all in the wort, not even the usual fine lines of bubbles you sometimes
get when you under pitch like this.  I moved the wort to the attic, and 
checked the temp, at about 60 deg.  I will check it again tonight.  My 
question is how long should I give this yeast before pitching dry yeast?  
I have a packet of whitbred ale yeast for just such emergencies.  Since 
the fermometer temp was higher than ambient, I suspect my yeasties may 
have been reproducing.  Any opinions or suggestions on what I should do 
with this batch are more than welcome.

Subject: hops etc


    Chris  Strickland (HDB1917)  wonders what to do with the hops vines
after the harvest.  If the cold (what cold there is in Fla) hasn't
shriveled the vines by now, cut them back to the ground. The idea is
that in the first year, keep the vines pruned down to 4-5 feet, so all 
the growth occurs in root/rhizome structure, then the second year the
plants will be very strong, and shoot up to 20-25 feet.  But don't 
worry (are my vines ruined?)----if you keep their feet moist, and feed
them lots of rich fertilizer, they'll produce a nice crop for you.
   
   A recent thread mentioned an old quote from js, something about 
sparge temperature vs mash temp.  I made a batch of dunkelbock last 
weekend, and forgot to 'mash out'---I just started sparging after a 90
minute mash. (the Belgian ale I washed down lunch with must have addled
my brain) My sparge bucket is insulated with foil-coated bubble wrap, and
the sparge water went in at 180 degrees F.  I use a Phil's sparge arm, 
and keep about an inch above the grain bed.  Thinking that the hot water
would raise the temp of the mash to something like mash-out temp, I put
my thermometer in and was surprised to find that the mash never got above
160 dF, and the wort coming out stayed in the low 140's throughout the
sparge.  So ---I bet js is right, you could sparge with 200 degree water
and the mash would not get above 180 or so.  I think next batch I'll
try that (after mashing out, of course) and see just how much cooling
takes place between the lauter tank and the mash. It could be that the 
Phil's Rotating Arm (tm), which is copper and delivers a pretty fine
spray of droplets, cools the hot water by as much as 20dF.
 
   Unrelatedly---I would like a good recipe for a Thomas Hardy clone.
Had a bottle of the 1993 last week and it was chewily superb!

A local (excellent) microbrewery, George IV Inn at Picton, in NSW, =
Australia, makes only lagers. All of the beers are primary fermented in =
a single tiled room with 6 open fermenters. I do not remember the =
fermenter size, but it looked around 1000l each. The brewer gave us a =
tour and had no problems in letting us into the fermenting room, where =
we even climbed up a ladder and stuck our faces about a foot or so from =
fermenting beer! There was a massive krausen on the particular batch we =
saw. The room is kept around 7-8C. After the krausen drops, the beers =
are pumped into secondary serving tanks beneath the bar where they are =
lagered for 8 weeks before serving.




The brewery was designed by a now deceased German brewmeister.


Two principal beers are made, a lager and a bock. The lager suffers from =
excessive diacetyl. The superb bock probably has a similar amount, but =
the strong flavour effectively masks it, as the taste is imperceptible. =
Most attribute the high diacetyl levels to the lack of individual =
temperature control on each fermenter (diacetyl rests are impossible). =
This thread has made me wonder that perhaps the open fermentation has a =
significant contribution to the high levels of diacetyl in the lager. =
But why not the bock?=20


The beers are also kegged and delivered by truck (only recently =
refrigerated) to another hotel in Sydney (the Australian Hotel in the =
Rocks). The lager diacetyl levels here are even higher, making it almost =
undrinkable (sob). Fortunately the bock is generally still excellent at =
this second venue.
