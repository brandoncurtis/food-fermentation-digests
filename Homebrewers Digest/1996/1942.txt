Subject: Who is Crabtree?


I've certainly been enjoying the molecular biology lessons - thanks AJ
and Tracy.  It's been 20+ years since I had physiology - and that was
vertebrate phys., so it's taken some rust removal to bend my brain
around this stuff.  But my previous life as a history teacher leads me
to another question - who was/is Crabtree of the Crabtree Effect?  I
asssumed that he (possibly she) was old and dead like Pasteur, but in
February, 1996 Discover Magazine, there is an article about the
cellular/molecular biology of immunity, featuring the research of, among
others, Jerry Crabtree of Stanford.  With Crabtree being a fairly
uncommon name, I wondered if these were one and the same.  An now, in
the new issue of Science, there is an article about the breakdown of
Freon and other CFCs utilizing sodium oxalate, by Yale scientist Robert
H. Crabtree.  This isn't cellular biology, so this is probably not our
Crabtree, but what is this?  A big family of chemists?

Subject:       Adjusting hyrdrometer readings


In response to Roy Ogburn's question about adjusting hydrometer 
readings for high altitude, the answer is:


NO


Remember, the air pressure inside of the hydrometer has nothing to do 
with how a hydrometer works.  Using Archimedes principle, we know 
that the hydrometer will keep sinking into the liquid until it has 
displaced a volume of liquid that is equal in mass to its own.  The 
more dense the liquid, the less volume of liquid that has to be 
displaced and, therefore, the higher the hydrometer sits in the 
liquid.  Therefore, the pressure of the air in the hydrometer does 
not matter.  All that matters is that its mass remain constant, which 
it does since it is sealed.

Open ferment in the boiling kettle?  Why rack?


I use hop bags, so I don't need to rack to eliminate hops.  
Can I do the primary ferment in the boiling kettle after 
removing the hop bags, cooling the wort, and pitching?  Any 
disadvantages to this method?


Since I missed the beginning of the open fermentation 
discussion, I'd appreciate pointers to which hbd(s) contained 
the technique and benefits.

Skimming the trub laden foam serves much the same purpose as allowing the
fermentation to "blow off".  Have you ever tasted the material that comes
out the blow-off?  Or the material that sticks to the upper sholders of a
carboy?  It is the same intensly bitter material.  The harsh bitterness is
something that you don't want.


So Tim, did you save and repitch the yeast that rose after the trub?

Theoretical is fine, but if peak of the log phase occurs at 10 AM on a

I think that it is counter productive to worry too much about theoretical
details when practical details rule our lives.  In any case I think, and
agree 100% with Tracy, that the PRIMARY concern is ....

Absolutely!  The one with the biggest starter wins.


Now consider this:  Breweries that repitch their cultures (all) over many
generations, consequently ALWAYS  use yeast that has completed its work.
Since the fermentation is complete, this is certainly WELL past the log
growth phase.

To which Jack Replied:
*Glad you asked.  This is another one of those areas where my opinion is
*less than meek and equivocal.  Blowoff is probably the silliest procedure
*that has ever been developed for making beer.  I am hard pressed to think
*of even a single redeeming feature.  The advantages of "open" fermentation
*are as myriad as those for blowoff are lacking.


I have to agree with Jack here.  I think that blow-off is a step back.
About the only advantage is that it is good for those that can not check or
manage their fermentations frequently.  Does anyone know who first
published the blowoff technique?  It is not in the old British Homebrewing
books and seems to have started in the US homebrew literature.


Another nugget from Jack:


*How bout a carboy without an airlock?


I'd call it silly (and hopefully only an exercise in semantics).


Scott also asked about open fermentation and yeast collection in a post
that was sent to me (and HBD) but has not yet hit the HBD.  Apparently the
time lag for posting has you bugged.  Nobody is ignoring you.  This time of
the year you must be patient for answers due to the backlog.


Jim Busch has written an excellent article on open fermentation that
appeared in Zymurgy (?) a few months back.  It can be downloaded from the
YCKCo home page (see URL below).  Basically the process is simple:


1-Skim the dark trub laden material during the first few days.
2-When the clean yeast rises (about day 3-4) skim the yeast and save it in
a sanitized container.
3-Use the saved yeast in your next batch.  Brew soon (within a week or
so-depending on the strain).


Now YOU have the biggest starter.

Just depends on the plastic.  Polyethylene will deform  at about 180 to 190f

JUST Don't do IT!  besides getting bad beer, You will possibly get very sick
from drinking gasoline.  The plastic has a tendancy to absorb some of just
about whatever it holds.  If you  or anyone else for that matter, uses USED
plastic containers, make darn sure that the container is food grade.  It
should have NSF, FDA or some other statement signifying that it is food
grade.  In addition make sure that it truly has held only food/ foodstuffs.
Stay away from colored containers unless it is food grade.  Some older
containers may contain heavy metal pigments which can leach out.  
BTW, I use plastic exclusively as the company I work for manufactures food
containers.  This is not an advertisement, no  trade names being used.  It
is just the start of the PLASTIC FAQ.  Just what you need to safely brew
your very best HB in.( Ties in nicely with the open fermentation thread
don't you'all think?   I'll answer any question you want to throw this way
until I have the FAQ done.

Now that I have taken some time to look it up, here is the real deal.


Ref: De Clerck, A Textbook of Brewing, 1957, Vol 1, pp 401 (The text is
his, any typos are mine):


"Hop resins are largely eliminated during fermentation by the fall in pH as
well as by adsorption on the surface of the yeast cells and by coagulation
in the head.  There is, therefore, a considerable dimunition in bitter
flavour.


The eliminted bitter material is found partly in the head which should be
skimmed off carefully to avoid adding sharpness to the beer.  In top
fermentations, the resins are found mixed with the yeast which has risen to
the surface, and are removed along with the yeast at skimming.  So as not
to include too much bitter material in the yeast, the first heads formed on
the surface before purging of the yeast are skimmed off.  These are
sometimes called 'bitters'".

Sounds like a leak to me.  I use my system a lot and the CO2 lasts a long time.

Either way.  You were right to cool the water first, that makes a huge
difference.
Agitation also helps a great deal.  It really speeds up the dissolution of CO2.

Subject: Wort Aeration, rev. 4


There's been several posts about using racking holes/air holes for aerating
wort. I though add a bit to the thread:


A drawback to the racking hose/holes is that the air it sucks in may cause
an infected brew,  particuliarly if you brew outdoors as I do.  OTHO, I've
done it a couple of times- w/o any infections I could detect.  I now use an
air pump with an in-line sterile filter.  I pipe this via a check valve
(don't omit it- pet stores sell them) and an aquarium type needle to the top
outlet of a 3/8" nylon tee inserted in the racking hose:
   air in           ** The turbulance caused by the tee   
      |             ** helps form small air bubbles
 tee->|--wort in     
      |               
   wort out - jammed into big hole of orange carboy cap


The thing works great. Unlike a racking hose/holes, it will aerate well even
at low wort flows.  It usually takes me 20-30 minutes to rack off the boiler
since I immersion cool, whirlpool and rack with a slotted copper loop
manifold and fast racking tends to clog the manifold with hops and break
material.


I collect the foam ejected from the carboy via a 1/4" hose attached to an
orange 2-hole carboy cap.  The hose runs vertically out of the cap for about
1-2 feet then down to a sanitized 3 L plastic pop bottle or a 5 gal. carboy
if I have an empty one.   If I don't use a carboy, I have to keep a close
watch on the level of foam in the 3 L bottle or it will overflow. If it
starts to overfill, I just turn off the air pump.  I also aerate after
racking with a air stone with the same blowoff setup.  After the foam in the
blowoff container has settled, I pour the resulting wort back into the
fermenter.


Happy aerating to ya!

I've tried it and wouldn't recommend it.  I don't think it's mashed with
the intention of creating fermentable sugars, so it finishes with high FG
and very sweet.  If you already have some and are wondering what to do 
with it, I'd suggest using it in small proportions in beers where residual
sweetness is desired, such as scotch ales, etc., in place of cara pils.

Homogeneous, but not second-rate, at least when compared with North
American megabreweries. Lots of mild, lightly-hopped pale lagers with
substantially more body than Budmilloors. ABV ranges from 4.5 percent to
6 percent for some "winter" lagers.

A recent magazine article estimated the number of homebrewers at 10,000.
That sounds a little high, but I suspect there at least a few thousand
of us. As yet, though, liquid yeast and grain of any sort are
unavailable locally. People either source these goodies from overseas or
brew with extract and dry yeast.

I doubt whether many people brew sake at home (it's just as illegal as
beer and not nearly as palatable), but the country is peppered with sake
"micros" producing far better brews than the major refineries.

At last count there were 16 or 17 licensed micros and brewpubs, all of
which have sprung up in the last year or two, and few of which yet
produce beers on a par with North American breweries and brewpubs. They
can be found throughout Japan, from Hokkaido down to Kyushu, and maybe
Okinawa.

Hi,


I have an ale fermenting for 11 days now. Due to cool weather fermentation was
never vigorous. I did move it from primary to secondary after 5 days assuming
that it will take time. Yeast is M&F dry ale yeast, and temperature reading
of the beer is around 14C (57F).
SG was 1044 it is now 1017 but seems to be stuck - the inverted cup in a three 
piece lock is kept suspended on a CO2 cushion but there are no bubbles (at least
not in the several minutes range). 
So - what do I do?
Wait - it will take time but will go lower?
Pitch new yeast?
Increase the temperture (how much)?
Other suggestions?


Usualy I have problems keeping the temperature low enough. It is the first time
I have temperatures which I think are a bit low for ale.

Yes, they are the same.  "Glycerol" is the more proper name, as the
 -ol ending (properly) indicates an alcohol.  The older name,
"glycerin(e)", improperly suggests an amine component, which is
not present.


There was a lengthy thread on the use of glycerol in the recent

   Your sig line sums up my remark.  Why not use a control from an electric
stovetop?  They work on the same principle, but mechanical instead of
electrical.  They have a bi-metal strip with a heater coil on it so that the
contact goes intermittently at a rate determined by how far the contact has
to move.
   However, I am a gadget head so your idea does appeal to me.  FWIW a stove
control costs about $25 or can be had off of an old stove for free.  How much
do think your circuit might cost?

Subject: Lager yeast with Ale recipe?


Greetings from a long-time lurker, first-time poster,


I started a batch of pale ale this weekend only to find that the ambient
tempurature in our house is genereally too cool for the ale yeast to
ferment.  I'm using Edme dry ale yeast which says on the package to keep the
temp. between 65 and 75 deg. F.  Well, our house has been around 60 deg. F
(moral:  never buy a house with an electric heat pump) and the fermentation
has essentially stopped without ever reaching krausen.


Since I don't have a clever way of keeping the carboy at the required temp.
and cranking the heat up in the house is not an option (house is empty
during the day and can't justify heating it for the beer alone), I was
wondering:


1.  Is there an ale yeast that would work at 55-65 deg. F?
2.  Could I use a lager yeast if I moved the carboy to the basement or
garage       and kept it at 45-55 deg. F?
3.  If I did #2, how would the beer taste and should I dry hop as I was
planning?


I'm leaning towards the lager yeast solution for now.  It will be
interesting to see how this batch turns out.  Has anyone ever used both an
ale and a lager yeast in the same batch?  Kind of have all the tempurature
ranges covered that way, but have no real control over the yeast
contribution to the flavor.


TIA,
Russ

I've already built the unit but had a question regarding

that complies with all applicable safe drinking water laws.


Is it okay to use the solder to secure the joints or should

90 degree elbow joints, etc.?"
>>>>>>>>>>>


Don't bother soldering the fittings at all.  Just slip the straight pieces
into the elbows at brew time and put the thing into your cooler.  This
assumes, of course, that the manifold is big enough to sit next to the walls
of your cooler and therefore can't be forced apart once it's installed.  Any
little bit of wort that leaks out just mixes with the rest of the wort that's
in the cooler anyway, i.e. it's not going anywhere except back into the
manifold. Actually, now that I think about it, the flow of wort through the
manifold is more likely to pull wort *into* the joints which are even more
effective than the cut slots at holding back debris.  So I don't worry about
it. 


It's also much easier to clean separate short pieces of slotted copper and
elbows than a soldered continuous ring of same.


BTW, for anyone with other reasons to solder copper and don't wish to invest
in the necessary equipment, you might try "Copper-Bond" adhesive.  It's a
two-part food grade epoxy that can be used for hot and cold potable water
connections.  Cures in 20 minutes and worked great for my sparging

I have just had reason to try to revive three yeast strains that have been

The champagne yeast (WYeast) was strong and healthy and formed numerous
colonies on plate. 


The Chimay (Red) and the Sierra Nevada (Pale Ale) were both essentially
dead, giving respectively one and three colonies from a generous loopful.
Since they were both in good shape this past July, it seems that their

As an adjunct brewer, Jeff needs the 50C (122F) rest for amino acid levels
for yeast nutrition. (I suggest 47C(117F)). But this rest has little effect
on haze, and a negative one at that. 
A rest at 57C (135F) would stimulate Proteinase activity and reduce the High
Molecular Weight Proteins to more soluble forms. HMWP's are considered "bad"
for haze, but it is the structure of *some* of them that is more important.
Dave's wheat has lots of HMWP's but they are not that haze prone as the
classic barley fraction. They do contribute to head.
For an all malt brewer with less than 20% wheat and a base malt with *over*
37% Kolbach index of modification, a "protein" rest in the 45-52C range
(Peptidase)is counter productive. More than necessary FANs, more HWMP's
while you wait, reduction in albumin and medium weight polypeptides.
Also, because most(~75%) of the total soluble protein was hydrolysed in
malting *and* it continues quickly to its limit at a wide range of mash
temps, (35-65C), there is little point trying to limit it. The problematic
HWMP's will pass into the mash anyway, so
1/Reduce them by Proteinase activity in the 55-59C range.
2/Keep the pH low at start of boil ~5.5 max.
3/Keep the pH low at start of boil ~5.5 max.(yes, I repeated it)
4/ If your kettle has a tight lid, put on an oven mit and hold it down tight
for 10 minutes at the start of the boil. The little bit of pressure (~1 psi)
generated will have a noticible effect on the quantity of hot break, and an
invisible effect on the *quality* of the break. The problematic fraction of
HWMP's.
5/ Lauter/sparge slowly, especially for rice adjuncts. This reduces tannins
as we know (as does low pH), but it also reduces head destroying
lipids(oils). Protein rests are often blamed for the effects of these
lipids. It has been calculated that there is 3-5 times as much of the
positive head retaining protein fraction in pale, well modified malts that
are infusion mashed as is necessary for a good stable head.
6/ For a fine head bubble, "Keep the pH low at start of boil ~5.5 max."!


I will explain all this and more in the upcoming Protein FAQ. I expect a
lively debate.

Subject: pitching yeast




now that the "when to pitch" thread is coming back, i would like to raise an 
issue i've wondered about:  how much better is it to pitch at the optimal 
time in the life cycle of the starter than to wait until later (perhaps even 
until the yeast has fallen out of suspension)?  it seems to me there's a 
tradeoff involved here.  pitching soon after high kraeusen seems to imply 
that you are pitching the entire starter, and if following the 10:1 "rule", 
means that you are adding liquid equivalent to 10 percent of your wort 
volume by adding the starter.  although i have made the switch to all grain, 
i still use dme to make up my starters; this would imply that roughly 9 
percent of the resulting wort in the fermenter is the starter, which likely 
differs in significant ways from the wort i labored to create via my choice 
of grains, mashing schedule, etc.


so, accepting that the yeast are in the optimal state to pitch just after 
high kraeusen, how much worse off are the yeast if we wait, say, until 
they've settled out (so that we can pour off the liquid)?  presumably 
they've used up some of the built up glycogen, but how much?  a more 
subjective way of putting the question is does adding the yeast at the 
optimal point in the starter cycle offset the addition of the "alien" wort 
to the fermenter?


a related question: when we add yeast to a starter, is the size of the 
starter  the limiting factor determining the  "goodness" of the resulting 
material pitched into the wort (assuming an appropriate temperature, etc.)? 
 in other words, suppose i take two starters of a pint each, and innoculate 
one with a smak-pak worth of yeast, and innoculate the other with a big glob 
of yeast saved from a previous batch.  are the number of *healthy* cells at 
any point after high kraeusen the same?  if not, does this argue for the 
following starter procedure: taking saved yeast from previous batches, 
making a *small* starter (i.e., much less than the 10:1 "rule"), and 
pitching that just after high kraeusen?

Open fermenters are still relatively common in Bavaria.  The brewery 
I worked at had 8 open and 4 closed, and in summer used lager tanks 
as emergency primary fermenters.  Even the closed fermenters were 
little more than loosely covered open fermenters.  Lag times were 
kept low by carefully monitoring yeast viability--yeast was reused 
up to 12 times, within 8 hours of harvesting.  Air was filtered, and 
the room was under more or less counterpressure.  There were never 
any problems with infections during my year there.  We brewed only 
bottom fermenting beers there; for top fermenting beers, for example 
weiss beers, open fermenting is even more common.

This is not necessarily so. My position is not based on what Papazian,
Miller, or Noonan say, but rather my knowledge of microbiology and the
scientific literature. Since many people have complained about too much
biochemistry lately, I'm not going to get into that here. Suffice it to say
that glycogen metabolism is MUCH more complex than is indicated here and is
highly dependent on wort nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphate levels, as well as
availability of fermentable carbohydrates. Based on what I've found in the
literature, glycogen synthesis in fermenting beer (or a starter culture)
begins well before the stationary phase and yeast glycogen reserves may not
be rapidly depleted upon pitching, particularly if the culture is
well-adapted to the wort. There are also authors who have found that initial
glycogen levels in pitching yeast have no measurable impact on beer quality.
The point here is, it's probably not a good idea to rely on a single
reference when it comes to something this complex.


[snip]
>The bottom line, from all this reading is:

I think we may have a problem with semantics here. Actually, "shortly after"
high kraeusen (HK), the yeast are still budding fairly rapidly; they have
not stopped multiplying yet. It would not be good to wait until they stop
growing to pitch, as this would increase lag time significantly. My opinion
is that it is somewhat difficult for most homebrewers to time their yeast
starters with brew day. It is also somewhat tedious to determine glycogen
reserves (you can do a starch test). In light of these facts, even if it
were best to pitch when glycogen reserves were highest, and even if we had a
way of knowing this, it would generally be difficult to accomplish in
practice. Fortunately, we have alternatives, like pitching more cells and
aerating the wort thoroughly. IMO, if you adapt the starter to a wort
similar to the brew, grow it large enough, and aerate the wort, you
generally won't have any problems with off-flavors or poor attenuation,
whether you pitch at HK or after. In fact, if you do all these things AND
pitch at HK, you'll give the yeast the best chance to make good beer.

1) HOW?-use a bucket for a fermenter and remove the lid once a head forms.
If your home is infested with curious critters, you might leave the lid on
loosely. WHY?-some say 'it just tastes better'. So far, nobody here has been
able to put their finger on exactly why or how this works, or what the
improved flavors are.
2) Just as one would with any other fermenter, collect the yeast and save it
in a sanitized jar in the fridge or repitch onto the yeast cake after
transfer. Some believe that ideally, one should skim the yeast from the top
during high kraeusen. You'll certainly get more viable cells this way, but
it's a bit more work. If you save the yeast, try to use it ASAP (best within
a coupla weeks).
3) Whether or not contamination is a problem depends on your sanitation and
your philosophy. When repitching routinely, one is bound to accumulate
contaminants over time, but this may not develop into a serious problem and
may ultimately result in "house flavors", some good, others potentially bad.
If you repitch fairly fresh yeast, lag times should be pretty short and
contaminants shouldn't be a big problem, at least for many generations. Good
luck.

I had the same problem even with new O rings. I got around the problem

at a much higher pressure than 5 psi, so I figured that the O rings may
