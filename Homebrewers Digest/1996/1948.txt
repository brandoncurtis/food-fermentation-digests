Glad you pointed up the stovetop control idea.  I sort of forgot about that.  
Or maybee I was concerned about stress on the element because of full on/off 
power and all the thermal shock.  I may give it a try as I do think it will be 
the easiest and least expensive method to control the heater element.  
Scorching hasn't been a problem with my setup so I guess full on/off may be 
fine. 


The SSR will cost about $26.50, the dimmer about $5.00. The box and wires and 
bridge rectifier a few dollars. I guess the whole thing could be built for 
$50.00 or less. 


One thing I did not mention was that eventually the dimmer could be controlled 
by simply adding a photo-optical variable resistor (or whatever it's called) 
across the potentiometer in the dimmer. This would allow electronic control by 
using a temperature sensor and a controller of some kind. I guess I just like 
to tinker and it seems like fun to be able to control that 4500 watts with 
electronics. 


P.S. Today 01-26-96 I have bench wired and tested the SSR controller and it 
works.  I am planing to test it under full load tomorrow.

>
>1. how far from the bottom is the heating element?
>


I mounted it about 2 inches from the bottom.  The closer the better but leave 
enough room in case the element tends to sag. You do not want the element to 
touch the bottom.


>2. how do you mount it on the plastic so that there are no leaks?  What

>


Drill a hole.  I used the paddle type bits made for wood.  Works very well to 
drill the plastic. 


>3. how do you wire it to a cord so you can plug it in?
>


The element has two screw terminals built in.


>4. are there 110 volt versions of these heating element available?  Where is a 
>good place to get these water heating elements?  Can I use something like a 
>stove heating element, but how would it be mounted?
>


Yes 110 volt versions do exist.  I got mine from heating-plumbing department 
of Home Depot.  Any good hardware store should also have it.  There are two 
versions one is mounted through a single 1.25 inch hole. The other uses a 
square flange.  Get the one that mounts through a single hole.  Should pay 
about $10.00 for it. 


>5. What would be the minimum watts required to work in a 110 volt set up? ( I 
>would only boil about 6-7 gallons to make a 5 gallon batch, and I would not

>


You may find a 1500 watt for 110 volts.  But I don't know if it would be 
enough to attain a boil.  If you insulated the bucket with the foil coated 
bubble wrap it probably would be enough power to do the boil. 


Also if you insist on 110 volts - have a good supply of fuses on hand.  This 
will put a good strain on your wiring and any additional loads on the
circuit will 
have you quite friendly with your fuse box.

The first thing I did was to boil up some water for about two hours, cool it 
and then taste it.  Yumm, good water with no off taste.


I figured if any plastic taste leeched through that it would affect the LME 
that was stored in it so that's why I thought the LME container was safe.

Subject: Pronunciation....


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Just a curiousity: I've heard the word diacetyl pronounced three
different ways.  die-UH-set-ul where the "cet" is pronounced like
the one in acetylene (my personal favorite), Die-UH-seet-il where
the "cet" is pronounced like the one in acetic, and Die-ASS-it-il
where the - well, you get the picture...


My curiosity is this: how many pronounce it each way? Where are you 
from? Is this a regional thing? And, finally, does anyone have a 
dictionary entry or the like showing the "correct" pronunciation.


Let's treat the first three as a "survey", and the last as a bonus 
question. Private e-mail, please - I'll summarize.


See ya!

Subject: re:  Hot break/Cold break


In HBD #1946 John Wilkinson said:


> How do I get rid of hot break or cold break?


        Now I know there are as many ways to do this as there are ways to
brew so  I can only comment on the method I've been using.
        After I finish boiling my 6 or so gallons of wort, I whirlpool the
hops and I siphon the wort through  a round copper manifold and a CF
chiller into a bucket. This leaves behind lots of hot break material, most
of it clinging to the spent hops.
        I seal the bucket and let it sit for a couple of hours. By then,
there is a definate "layer" of cold break material on the bottom. I then
rack off it to a carboy, pitch and ferment as usual.
        This method worked great with a couple of lagers that I've brewed
recently. Seeing how lagers take a little longer to ferment, and spend a
bit more time in the primary, I wanted to remove as much break material as
possible.
        With ales, I usually don't bother with the cold break removal. I
pitch in the first bucket, then rack to a secondary 3 or 4 days after
fermenting in the primary.
        What do others do?

While it may not be strictly proper to inquire about this here, I do
wonder if anyone could provide me with a decent recipe for a dry cider
(along the lines of Woodpecker or Dry Blackthorn).  The American
varieties which have recently hit the market in this area are syrupy and
disappointing, and the imports frankly cost too much.  I would be most
grateful.

I investigated this material as a retrofit insulation material on a project
at work and did a bit of burn testing.  I've done a fair amount of testing
and this stuff is downright scarry when it burns.  The plastic bubbles
present alot of fuel surface area and the flame front often races through
the material much faster then one might expect due to the channeling effect
of the alumimum facings.  The material is very easily ignited at raw edges
where the plastic bubble material is exposed and fairly easily ignited
through the aluminum facing.  


DO NOT USE IT ANYWHERE NEAR A FLAME! 


I use it to insulate my RIMS.  After 2 batches and 2 wet runs w/o grain, the
only degradation is a discoloration of the aluminum around the RIMS lid-
probably due to acid vapors from the mash.  I also use it around my
internally heated sparge water tank (170 degF) and haven't noticed anything
untoward.


For high temps, the best stuff is ceramic fiber insulation (e.g. Cerafiber-
no connection ect...).  Kinda pricey tho'.

Subject: Pitching routine


Hello all! I've changed my pitching routine somewhat because I'm getting a
massive cold break from my CF wort chiller, and I'd like to have my
technique critiqued by the collective. What I'm doing is to transfer the
chilled wort (~45*F) to a carboy overnight in order to settle the cold break
and for the temperature to raise to 60-65*F. Then I rack to a primary, and
pitch my yeast in the morning. Let me say that so far, I've had no problems
and I've had some of the shortest lag phases ever. But since I just started
doing this (2 batches), I haven't tasted any beer yet. Here goes:


1. I start with a 1-qt. starter just after high kraeusen.


2. I have a ~40-ft. counterflow wort chiller that is able to cool the wort
to ~45*F.


3. I  fill, soak, and then evacuate Iodophor from a clean carboy with CO2
using one of those orange carboy caps with a gas connection on the long
tube, and a racking cane on the other. (I've got a narrow-range secondary
regulator that will hold the pressure at 2 o 3 lbs.) 


4. Now, before I start filling the CO2-purged carboy, I transfer my 1-qt.
starter to a 1-gal. jug, and use the first runnings from the WC to fill it
with brewing wort to acclimate my yeast to the specific wort I'm going to be
brewing with. When filled, I put on an airlock and set aside.


5. Now I'm ready to chill the wort. I switch carboy caps and insert a
different racking cane that reaches all the way down to the bottom of the
carboy. This in turn is attached to my pump which is on the cold side of the
WC. When I turn on the pump (I control it with a fan motor controller), cold
wort is gently introduced into the CO2-filled carboy--no oxygen is added at
this time. I fill to the top and add an airlock. I allow this to settle
overnight. In the morning HUGE amounts of cold break have settled to the
bottom and the temperature has raised to 60-65*F.


6. In the morning, I transfer this to a primary fermenter, adding copious
amounts of air, and pitch with the gallon starter which by now is nearly
crawling out of the bottle. My lag times are something like 6-8 hours for a
good kraeusen to begin to develop.


All comments are welcome, and thanks for taking the time to read this,

Subject: Cider Draft, Yeast Farms, GFI's


After reading several post on fermenting apple cider form the local 
orchards, I got 4 gallons and a packet of champagne yeast.  Rehydrated 
according to the packet, pitched it in the boy, and presto no changeo, 
nothing for ten days.  I then went to the quart I was going to use to 
prime with and it's label says '1/10th of 1% benzoate of soda added (a 
preservative)'.  So, did the soda kill my yeast as soon as it hit the 
cider?  If so, now what? Is the soda unstable at high temps and can be 
boiled off like chlorine?  Should I just rack it off, leaving the yeast, and 
forget the whole thing ever happened?  We've all heard of the Crabtree 
Effect, is this the Apple Tree Effect!?! 
 
- ---
 
I need some info on how to start a yeast farm where I can take a 
portion and make starters.  How often and how much to feed the 
farm?  Also, how is yeast conditioned for wort?  Is this done by making 
the starter at the same OG as the wort or is there more to it?  Are 
there some FAQ's on this somewhere?  
 
- ---
 
I have seen a few post about using electric water heater elements.  I 
would suggest installing a GFI breaker to protect yourselves.  A GFI 
breaker monitors the current flow in and out.  When there is a 
difference, ie current flow through you, the breaker trips.  A two pole 
GFI cost about $100, considerably cheaper than a casket!

If that's the plastic thingy that goes on the end of the racking hose, 
which divides the flow into a flat sheet-like spray, yes I have.  
(Obviously, I am using it without knowing who made it).


FWIW, I love it.  I get excellent aeration - - the yeasties really take 
off quite well, non-scientifically comparing via memory to other batches. 
 I think it's a very nice solution to the problem -- quick and dirty, and 
fairly cheap.

Subject: PU no longer brewed in wood?


Twice in the last few weeks, Al K has referred to Pilsner Urquell being brewed 
in wood vessels.


Ron Vavruska, a member of our homebrew club, visited Pilsner Urquell last 
summer.  He toured the brewery and reported that PU no longer uses wood at any 
stage in the brewing process. 


When did this happen?  To quote from an article he wrote for our newsletter:


"The first stop [on the tour] was to see the mash tuns and kettles in full
operation.  Then it was underground to visit a portion of the 7 kilometers of
tunnels dug by hand during the last century.  The tunnels house the huge open
wooden primary fermenters and the many wooden lagering kegs. Alas, these
marvelous wooden vessels are no longer used.  During January 1994 the brewery
switched over to an all stainless steel operation for fermenting and lagering
with only 4 weeks of lagering instead of  the traditional 8 weeks of lagering.
I know you're thinking that the beer can't be as good. Well you would be
partially right because the guide told us that the first batch from the
stainless steel wasn't any good.  The brewers worked the remainder of the year
to perfect their skills using this new method and considered it accomplished by
January 1995 when they hosted an international professional brewers convention.
The brewers were equally divided in saying the beer produced in wood was
better, the beer produced in stainless steel was better and that it didn't make
any difference."


So PU hasn't been brewed in wood for at least a year - that means that we 
should be getting the SS brewed version in the US any day now :-).

Subject: Health effects of "Green Beer"/Yeast trub




It is interesting that the discussion of these two topics coincided
perfictly with my purchase of Eric Warner's _German Wheat Beer_.  In this 
excellent book Warner address both of these issues, if only in passing.


On p.8 Warner referrs to a 1989 book written in German called the 
_Handbook of Brewery Practices_.  According to Warner's recounting, 
consumption of more that 30g of yeast per day can raise the levels of 
uric acid in the blood and, over time such behavior could lead to gout.  
However, Werner also points out that the average Weissbier has only 4g 
per liter--this would necessitate the habitual ingestion of over 7 L daily
to threaten any problems.  Perhaps this finding is outdated, but even if 
not, I can't imagine that the yeast levels of "green beer" could be
significantly higher.


As far as "trub" goes, Tracy is of course correct about the word's German 
origins.  However, the others who were so quickly chastized for using the 
word vis-a-vis the kraeusen stage were also, according to Werner, 
correct.  On p.73 he mentions that during the so-called hop drive (a 
phase preceeding high kraeusen in which the fermenting yeast carry hop 
resins to the beer's surface) some trub is also caught in fray, and is 
likewise brought to the top.  This trub is then removed along with the 
resins.

Personally, I would emphatically *not* recommend heat pads *under* the
fermenter. In my wanderings through the labyrinths of protein chemistry I
have found that, like an espionage message, yeast contain the mechanism of
their own destruction. They have, bound within the cell, a class of
protelytic(breaking down protein) enzymes that degrade and disolve the dead
yeast. 
This autolysis process can be triggered by some enzymes at temperatures
approaching 40C.(Proteinase ysc A) In the boundary layer of wort at the
bottom of a fermenter warmed to 25C, these temperatures are easily
achievable. This layer also contains the yeast which prevents convection.
The belt type electric warmer is a much better idea, it promotes convection,
reducing the boundary layer. It also affects much less yeast. If you are
getting yeasty flavours, an electric pad may be the problem.

I just finished a bottle of Hardy Country bitter, brewed by

ObBeer: Just started kegging our beer.  The beer from the kegs tastes 
noticeably better than a similar beer from bottles.  I attribute this to
either a) better carbonation level in the poured beer
          i.e. lower but with good head (TM).
       b) a couple of weeks of cold conditioning in the brewery/garage.


Still, we're not giving up on bottling, it is a painless process for us with
a good supply of free bottles, teamwork, our access to a large autoclave and
a bench capper, and it makes many more types of beer available at any given
time. 


One keg is going to a superbowl party later today.  So who cares if the 
game is dull?

Subject: Freezing yeast


In HB1941, ge083`at`cleveland.Freenet.Edu (G. M. Elliott) asks if glycerin is the
same as glycerol, and how to use it to freeze yeast.


 Yes, they are the same, but you can freeze yeast easier and quicker using
sucrose (table sugar).  Sterilize 3/8 cup sucrose in one cup of water by boiling
15 minutes.  Mix equal volumes of yeast slurry and cooled sucrose solution, then
freeze.  Thaw rapidly by immersion in warm water.
 If you do find glycerine, follow the same procedure, but use 1/3 cup glycerine
to 2/3 cup water.
 I recommend also that you read "Chemicals for Preserving and Freezing Yeast" by
Maribeth Raines in the 1992 Zymurgy special issue "Gadgets and Equipment".

I do not think that 1KW element would be enough power to give a decent boil,
if any.
With the full 4500 watts it still takes about 15 minutes to bring my 7 or 8
gals. to a boil.  If a boil was eventualy reached it would take much too
long and I would not want to add any more time to the brewing schedule.


Also I have something in mind on a grander scale than just boiling. I would
like to come up with a design that would also allow some sort of temperature
regulation.  Regulation as opposed to control.  With regulation one could
have a temperature sensing element connected to an electronic regulator that
would send an analog signal to a varistor connected in parallel with the
rheostat in the dimmer.


Building the high power controller is the first step to this goal.

Part of what I posted is wrong or confusing, I apologise for the sloppy
writing, I seem to have begun one sentence and finished another- too much
coffee too late. Let us preview parts of the Lauter FAQ and correct them as
necessary.


"Extract A" from LAUTER FAQ (under construction)


FAQ        2/ How is the "extract" extracted?
At the end of mashing the *already soluble* concentrated extract (SG~1.100)
is *uniformly dispersed between and within* the grain particles, large and
small. This "extract" is a mixture of sugars, soluble proteins, mineral
salts, lipids and polyphenols. There is also some coagulated protein (hot
break) dispersed throughout the bed in a mash/lauter, and in the top layer
of a stand alone lauter. Small particles are fairly even in a mash/lauter
and in the upper layers of a lauter.
The dense wort partially floats the particles and the first runoff is simply
fluid dynamics, it runs slowly down through the bed. Because there is no
concentration gradient between the particles and wort, and because of high
viscosity, some extract remains *within and partly between* the particles.
Sparge water is continuously added to maintain bouyancy and remove this
remaining extract.
We know from osmotic theory that a solvent (like water) with low solutes
will pass through a semi-permeable membrane towards a greater concentration,
evening the two concentrations.
As the dilute sparge water (SG~1.000) chases the first runnings down through
the bed it first dilutes and washes out the remaining extract *between* the
particles. It then passes *into* the very permeable pieces of malt, diluting
and extracting a portion of the solutes there.
 After most already soluble extract has been extracted, sparge water begins
again the process of hydrolysing and dissolving remaining starch, proteins,
minerals, lipids and polyphenols in the "spent" grains. This process is
accelerated at temperatures over 77C. As the mineral salts raise sparge
water pH, extraction of *some* polyphenols is accelerated. Acidifying sparge
water before lautering buys a little time, carbonate hardness below 25 ppm
is considered adequate.
 Unconverted starch can cause haze, lipids flavour and head problems, and
polyphenols haze and atringency problems. Some already coagulated protein is
removed but this is not problematic as freshly hydrolysised high molecular
weight protein can be.
These "undesirable" extractions begin first in the small particles, then the
large particles, at the top of the bed, then the bottom. Lautering *slowly*
maintains a more even concentration gradient and slows small particle
extraction until large particles can be penetrated. This increases overall
fermentable extraction.
The domino in this undesirable extraction process is the removal of most
already soluble extract. Thus a termination point of 1 Plato (SG~1.004) in
final runnings is commonly used to forstall undesirable extraction. If a
fast runoff is used, a higher termination point must be used (2 Plato),
sacrificing significant extract in the large particles.
 To prevent "channeling" (sparge runoff through narrow channels) and to
prevent grain bed compaction and posssibly a "stuck" lauter, runoff and
sparge is also conducted *slowly*.


FAQ        2/How slowly should I runoff?
<SNIP> (this contains various methods of calculating optimum runoff)


The next "Extract B" of this FAQ will be lipids.(fatty acids)
Extract "C" will be polyphenols.

Subject: white yeast and aeration


"Nice white yeast"  I've heard it so often, but what does it mean?  


I just added in-line oxygen aeration to my system and my yeast is now white
when it settles down in a propagating mason jar.  Even when fed with
autoclaved non-aerated wort starters, the yeast is much whiter than it was
when I did the splash-it-in and shake-the-carboy aeration.


I understand that yeast health can change over generations as well as from
batch to batch.  So a couple of generations of poor (oxygen) nutrition from
starters might be tolerated.  Perhaps that's why re-pitching all of the
yeast from one batch to the next gives good results for a few generations,
overpitched or not.  Anyway, I think that the whiteness of the yeast is due
to the aeration, but why?


Trub can make yeast look brown, but this is white settled yeast.  Wyeast
1028 popped last summer and fed since, to be specific.


Why is it white?  Absence of cell wall scarring?

of dark hair around the edges.  They live in the scum growing inside the 
drain.  Control:  sanitation - clean the drain with a stiff brush to remove
the goo, follow up with caustic drain cleaner and then lots of boiling-hot
water.  They'll also breed in potted plants or anywhere else that there's 
been water standing long enough to accumulate the goo upon which they feed.

Subject: Lauter FAQ Extract "B"


This is the next extract of the Lauter FAQ (under construction). Don't
bother saving them, they are in no particular order and it will be found
later, complete and corrected, at The Brewery and the Stanford archives.
Please send email for any corrections.


FAQ        8/What are lipids and how to control them?
 These are fatty acids and sterols arising from malt, stale hops and yeast
metabolism. In malt they are 3.5% by weight, with 60% of that in Aleurone
layer, atached to the Pericarp. This is the hardest part of malt and usually
forms the largest pieces in grist. Only about 2% of these malt lipids make
it into wort lipids, typically 50 to 120 ppm. They are saturated,
unsaturated and necessary for yeast nutrition in cell building, which
consumes significant oxygen metabolising the saturated ones. Without
adequate oxygen for this path, aldehyde and fusel alcohol production is
stimulated. 
 The Free Fatty acids (C-12 to C-18.3) supress ester formation in *wort* at
about 3.5 ppm, but have negative head stability effects in *beer* at 0.5
ppm. Fortunately yeast normally consumes them to below this level in beer.
Thus, achieving the correct balance of lipids in wort is delicate.
 Lipids pass into the wort both as solubles and, as insolubles, they form a
considerable portion (up to 50%) of "cold break" in colloidal complex with
phenols and proteins, and can be adsorbed by yeast from this cold break. 
 The conflicting and sometimes controversial results of investigations into
the necessity of cold break for yeast metabolism probably comes from the
dramatically different levels of lipids extracted by lauter/mash runoff
techniques. 
 Because of the flavour, staling and head stability problems of excesses of
*some* lipids ( triacylglycerols, free fatty acids, linoelic acid), I would
suggest keeping them low as possible at the lauter stage, and then removing
the last of the cold break after fermentation has begun, if at all before
final racking. Using these colloidal(semi-soluble) sources of lipids for
yeast nutrition (both aerobic and anaerobic) means that any excess
precipitates out of the maturing beer. 
 To reduce lauter lipids
1/ Recycle the initial part of the first runnings for clarity, cloudy first
runnings contains often 5 times the usual lipid level. Recycle any cloudy
runoff after cutting the grain bed.
2/ Terminate sparge at 1.5 Plato (SG 1.006), this prevents further lipid
hydrolysing from the larger aleurone/pericarp particles in the grain bed.
The last runnings have increased levels of lipids. The ratio of lipid to
other extraction is dramatically higher, favouring linoelic acid, a staling
suspect.
3/ Runoff and sparge slowly, faster flow promotes the extraction of lipids.
Strainmaster(TM) filters are notorious for this.
4/ Time efficient mash schedules. Excessivly long mashes will extract
greater quantities of lipids.

Why not just carry the carboy to a fairly clean-aired location and skim
