This is exactly the same situation as with croppping a top-fermenting yeast
from an open fermenter.  The yeast which is collected (selected) in either
case is the most flocculent fraction.  This is exactly what you want, and a
good reason *for* using a blow-off system, IMO.  As far as which cells are
doing most of the fermenting at any given time, it's the ones in suspension. 
Those guys that are still in suspension when the cake forms will finish up
for that particular batch, but will then be discarded, i.e., un-selected.

wouldn't it stand to reason that the same is true for the more flocculent

On another subject: A white I made recently lost points because it was too
clear - wasn't cloudy enough.  When it's first chilled, it's nice and cloudy.
After several days chilled, it clears.  If I remember ,the haze is due to the
protiens from the unmalted wheat.  Can anything be done to keep the haze
and cloudiness?

No, I never sanitize my caps in any way.  While I can't say I've
never had sanitation problems, I've never noticed bottle-to-bottle
problems.

I'll check to see which I have.  This is new information to me.

Quite right.  The improvements I have made wrt oxidation have been in this
area.  I was hoping that the oxidation I tasted was a cumulative effect
of HSA and O2 in the bottle and that I would be able to reduce it further
with these caps.  Probably I need to look at HSA even harder.

It was pointed out to me in email that I made mistakes in my points 2&3. 
In (2) 10g = 2.2E-2, perfectly consistant with Domenick's findings.
In (3) I omitted the obligatory delimiter ":)" from the end.

Cloning this ale is my goal as well. Here's what I've learned so far.  
>From the "Real Ale Almanac": Old Thumper OG 1.058, ABV 5.8 
Ingredients. 
Maris Otter Pale Malt (90%) crystal and choc malts (4%) and torrefied 
wheat (6%). 28 units of colour (european) and 35 units of bitterness. 
Hops are Challenger, Goldings and Progress hop pellets. Late hopped 
with Goldings.


What I don't know is how to "torrify" wheat. Papazian says torrefied 
grain is "similar" to pufffed wheat. How similar? Can anyone help on 
this one?


The beer is from the Ringwood Brewery, in Hampshire and was the 
Champion Beer of England in 1988. The brewer in the States who makes it
under license, Alan Pugsley of Shipyard/Kennebunkport, apprenticed at 
Ringwood brewery. Yeast Lab's English Ale yeast A09 is reputed to be 
Ringwood yeast, so that should be the yeast to use. I'm curious if one 
of the new Wyeast strains is Ringwood yeast, specifically #1335, 
British Ale II, but I don't know.


Shipyard/Kennebunkport has a web page (http://realbeer.com/shipyard/) 
which contains the folllowing info on Pugsley:
"He began his brewing career working under Peter Austin at the Ringwood
Brewery in Hampshire, in the West County of Britain.  Pugsley learned 
the brewing business from the ground up from Austin, a brewer of 30 
years' experience who is generally regarded as the "grandfather" of the
microbrewery revolution...He also collaborated with Austin on the 
development of the Calandria (external heating) system, copper 
whirlpool and hop percolator--the brewing system responsible for the 
unique taste of Old Thumper and the other Shipyard Ales."


Interestingly, their web page does not mentioned the torrefied wheat 
ingredient, although it has all the other info that the Almanac has.


Hope this helps. I hope to make some myself, yet I'm a new (extract) 
brewer. I guess my effort will be called "Young Humper".

Rubbermaid owns Gott and has for several years.  They make a 10 gallon and
a 5-gallon.  My five gallon, purchased a little over a year ago, says both
Rubbermaid and Gott on it, in different places.  Not sure how they're labelled
these days.  I'm pretty sure they only have one plant where they make any 
cylindrical coolers, and it's the old Gott plant.

Ah, there's a big difference.  I have no carpeting.  What I generally do is
drag the carboy out into an open area on the floor, sit down next to it, and
pick it up onto my lap.  With the carboy resting on one leg, I hold it with
both hands and give it a good hearty swirling.

Subject: Bruheat


       
Jeff Hewit asked about Bruheat boilers:


I've been using a Bruheat for mashing/boiling for 3.5 yrs and IMO is 
the way to go.  If I'm doing step-infusion I heat my water in the 
BH to the first rest temp+8F, add boiling water for the next step, 
and then use the heating element for any additional rests.  The 
reason for the additional water is twofold.  My first rest is a 
protein rest which is better done with a thick mash and secondly when 


raising the temp of the mash with the heating element you should stir 
frequently and the extra water makes that easier.  Some people 
have mentioned problems with scorching grains but with a little 
patience this shouldn't be a problem(Don't crank it up to max. and 
leave for 5 min.). I then transfer the mash into a Phils' rig with an 
Easy Masher installed and run my sparge into the Bruheat(after 
rinsing). I normally get 30+ pts with this setup and also use the BH 
for 6.5 gal boil. I start the boil after the heating element is 
covered 
and once Im done sparging, its another 15-20 min(never really timed 
it) to boiling. For what its
worth I recently insulated my BH with aluminized bubble wrap and it 
seems to be holding up well.

Subject: How fresh is fresh?


     Hi!
     
     The recent postings on green beer remind me of a question that I have 
     always had.  When does a beer reach its prime?  I know that it will 
     vary depending on the style and storage temperature.  I am currently 
     bottling all of my beer and I haven't started lagering yet.  But I 
     have tried just about every style possible w/o lagering.  Sam Adams, 
     for one, is proud of their product dating.  How old would it be when 
     it first gets to market? at the expiration date?  I would experiment, 
     but in the past 17 years of homebrewing, I've never managed to keep 
     any around for more than a couple months after bottling. Is there a 
     reference that gives an indication of quality vs time for different 
     styles?  Does anybody have any opinions? (nah, nobody in this 
     group...)  I would be hoppy to summarize all feedback.

Subject: Yeast Stepping and Homebrew Supplies


Hi All:
I have two unrelated questions.  First, I've followed the Yeast pitching 
thread with interest, but have to admit that a great deal of it is over my 
head being a financial type rather than a scientist type.  My question is: 
can someone give me a relatively simple step by step procedure for 
increasing the population of yeast cells in my samples to pitching levels. 
 I have taken samples (1 tbsp)of yeast from my primary fermenter, closed 
them in canning jars with a sterile wort solution (1 pint) and stored in 
the refrigerator.  I take the samples from that sludge at the bottom of 
the fermenter after racking.  I let the gas pressure out of the jars about 
once a week.  This process is a la an article in *Brew Your Own* a few 
months ago.  What I don't know is how to step the sample up to a pitchable 
quantity of yeast..help?


The second question is that I am going to put a business case together for 
a homebrew supply store.  I sick of driving a long way to shop for stuff.  
Any input, suggestions and special circumstances to consider from those of 
you with experience or opinions (as if any of us has an opinion on 
something)would be very much appreciated.  I am in Texas, so if anyone has 
knowledge of special laws etc. please pass it along.


Thanks,

Two years ago I ordered hops from Field's (I believe that Fields and

But if I had it to do over I would have bought cascade or mount hood or the
like.  You just can't be sure how bitter they are (unless some body out

Well Cam how about another bug question?


Late July though late September little winged monsters invade my brewing
area in the back hall.  They have red eyes and feel the need to climb in my
air locks and commit suicide.  And if I use vodka in my airlocks they
multiply.  Lucky as it cools in the fall they disappear until the next
summer.  If possible I'd like to find a way of controlling them naturally
without giving up brewing.


Its up to you Cam, name that bug.

Subject: Can oxidation happen early in the mash?


Persistent oxidation problem.
I've eliminated (I hope) all sources of HSA and other undesirable oxidation,
but I'm still getting some cardboardy taste, appearing as early as 4 weeks
after bottling, in beers with a high melanoidin content.  According to
Martin Lodahl, this fault is most commonly mediated by melanoidins which
get oxidized e.g. by splashing hot wort, and then are involved (way
"downstream") in the conversion of alcohol to aldehydes in the bottle. 
["One of the commonest symptoms of oxidation is a cardboard flavor caused by
2-trans-nonenal, a long-chain unsaturated aldehyde with a very low sensory
threshold." (Miller, CHHB, p.181)].  


What I'm wondering is, can melanoidins get oxidized in the mash water?  I
don't routinely pre-boil the mash water -- only draw it out of the foamy

Subject: Advantage of blowoff


Lately, the general consensus has been that blowoff is a silly idea that
provides no genuine advantages.  The advantage is not in the blowoff, which
is just a side effect, but rather in the closed container system.


To be more explicit....


I live in a small apartment and own a dog.


The closed system allows me to check on the progress of my ferment without
exposing the batch to dog hair -- I own a tri-colored beagle, so there are
many flavors of contamination that could float by.  The blowoff keeps the
unit from exploding or supplying midafternoon beverages for the canine (dogs
licking the airlock just ain't sanitary).


Enough said.

In my experience, a pound of grain is much larger than 0.32 quart.  A
pound of *water* is half a quart, and grain is lighter than water
(until you wet it, anyway).  Maybe you mean that a pound of grain,
added to sufficient water, increases its volume by 0.32 quarts?


Malted barley has a heat capacity about 0.3 - 0.4 that of water,
depending on its moisture content.  (Source: a posting by Rob Thomas a

What's the fuss about cleaning a carboy after a primary fermentation.  Just
dump in some B-brite, fill with hot tap water and leave it overnight.  In
the morning rinse it with hot water once or twice, rinse with iodophor, put
plastic wrap over the carboy mouth and put the carboy away until it's
needed.  Why scrub when the B-brite will do the work for you?

Subject: Carboy Cleaning


All this recent discussion of open fermentation vs. blowoff and Jack's
suggestion that cleaning the carboy was a PITA has finally given me the
uncontrollable urge to post to the HBD (I've been lurking for quite a while
but haven't felt the need to say anything...)


Cleaning a carboy with nasty gunk stuck to the inside of it is probably one
of the easiest things I run into in my brewing process. 1/2 cup of bleach,
some (very) warm water and about 24 hours is all it takes to *completely*
remove any trace of anything stuck to the inside of the thing - no scrubbing
and very little thought is involved - in fact, I don't even *own* a carboy
brush.  After a day's soaking, I just empty the carboy and it's sparkling clean.


Before anyone jumps on me, I should point out that one ought to use caution
when introducing warm liquids into a glass carboy, as differences in thermal
expansion between the cool outside and the suddenly warmed inside may cause
the thing to shatter. I usually put in the hottest tap water I can get
(around 135F) and it hasn't exploded yet.  But it might be a better idea to
use cooler water.  And in fact, I recently read where cool water helps the
bleach work better.  So use your own judgement.


Now, as far as open fermentation goes, it sounds neat but I remain
unconvinced that I should change my current closed carboy system... And as
for blowoff, that became a thing of the past when I went from a 5 to a 6.5
gallon carboy - with no perceptible difference in my beers.  So, as someone
recently pointed out, I've got something that's working for me and I'll
stick with it until curiosity gets to me and I feel like trying something
else...

     At the risk of sounding extremely anal, and getting Flamed, I submit 
     the following to the collective for assistance.
     For the past couple of years I have used dry yeast rehydrated and 
     "smack packs" with a starter.
     What I have tried lately is to use the "yeast" from some of the 
     commerical Trappist Ales I have enjoyed.
     What I do, without a great deal of sucess is to make a starter with 
     some dry malt extract, about 4 tablespoons, to a pint of water, heated 
     and cooled. When cooled to 75 degrees I pitch the yeast into a 
     Champange bottle and wait.  When adding this to my cooled wort on 
     brewing day, I wait, and wait, and still wait until I give in and 
     finally add a rehydrated dry "Ale" yeast.  Even after I have added 
     some yeast "energizers" to the stuck ferememtor.  It seems when trying 
     to re-use the commerical yeast, the only way I can acheive favorable 
     results is to add dry yeast and energizers.
     
     Where Am I going wrong??  I have heard from the digest good results 
     from others, have even read articles on the subject and yet I get poor 
     results.  Temps. are checked and pitching is at equal temps.  I have 
     even added 1-2 hop pellets to the starter to feed it, and still slow, 
     slower and dead still ferments going this route.
     
     Ok, send in the anal comments now :)

Unfortunately, I have only anecdotal stories about the hazards of the zinc 
on galvanized material.  I am reasonably sure that it is hazardous when 
oxidized, such as when cut with a torch or welded.  Perhaps the pH of your 
wort could cause leaching....  I don't know - I'm sure the chemists will 
post on this topic.


However, why not use another material and not worry?  Stainless may be too 
expensive, but surely your source for galvanized pipe also has copper?  I 
would think that copper pipe and fittings would be suitable for your 
application and less expensive than stainless.


Good luck!

Subject: oscura?/kegging observations


While on one of my pilgramiges to Philly last weekend, I had a chance to stop
at the Dock Street Brewery and sample a few of their finest.  The alt was
outstanding, the barleywine gigantic, but the beer that really caught my
interest was the Oscura.  The bartender explained that it was a "Mexican
Vienna Lager" - dark in color, but smooth and very drinkable.
Does anyone know anything more about this type of beer?  Origins?  Recipes?
What makes it unique?   I had never even heard the word "oscura" before last
Saturday...
Having recently converted to kegging, I now almost dread the aspect of
bottling my brew.  But I have noticed that the 2 week wait that is required
for bottle conditioning serves a valuable purpose.  While it is true that you
can keg and force carbonate your beer one night and drink it the next, the
beer is much better if allowed to sit for a week or two.  I guess this should
be intuatively obvious, but the extra time allows some of the hop harshness to
mellow and provides a much nicer, small-bubbled head than "new beer".
One last question:  with a properly santized keg and constant pressure
maintained, how long will homebrew keep in a corny keg?  Has anyone ever had
beer go bad in a keg?  Just curious...
Thanks for any info....

    Thanks for the vote of confidence! There was much discussion of this
issue last summer. I missed most of it, as I don't make root-beer (yet). My
guess is, there are probably several reasons you don't have glass-grenades.
The most likely explanation I can think of is, there aren't enough nutrients
for the yeast to keep growing long enough to finish fermenting all that
sugar. When making beer from barley malt, the wort has all the necessary
nutrients the yeast needs, including nitrogen (ammonium and amino acids),
essential salts (containing phosphate, sulfate, and minerals like calcium),
and various lipids essential for strong membranes. If you only mix sugar and
water, the yeast doesn't have access these nutrients and won't be able to
grow very much. I imagine if the temperature is high enough and the
root-beer is stored long enough, the bottles might eventually explode, so I
wouldn't let the kids handle them. I'd also try to store them in the fridge
once they're fully carbonated, just to slow the yeast down. Another
alternative might be to bottle the soda in empty plastic soda bottles. These
bottles can handle quite a bit of pressure, and even if they burst, I doubt
if anyone would be seriously injured.
    As an aside, root-beer is the only kind of soft drink I really like. I
think I'm going to make some soon!

I haven't done much fermenting under pressure, but I think 40 psi is OK for
the secondary. In fact, I usually just let the pressure build up in the
secondary (when using a keg). However, pressure this high will probably slow
the yeast down some, so I wouldn't try it for the primary fermentation.

I don't think one can provide too much oxygen during the first day or so
after pitching, especially with a lager fermented at a low temp. Should be fine.

>=Spencer


I'm simply quoting some previous postings, although in my experiences with
5-gallon cooler mashing, with a 10-lb grain bill and mash water, the volume
was pretty much 4+ gallons (10 lb x 0.32 qt/lb grain volume + 10lb x 1.3
qt/lb mash water = 4.05 gal) after the strike.  Seems there were a bunch of
numbers quoted for the heat capacity along the way; your figures may be
closer to the truth.


Anyhow, your comment about "a pound of grain added to sufficient water
increases is volume by 0.32 quarts" is probably applicable, since that is
what we're doing.  Dry grain probably would be "fluffy" enough to occupy more
"apparent" volume, at least until water is added to take up the fluffying
airspace.  I do get quite an evolution of bubbles when the strike water is
added.


I would refer you all to excellent articles in HBD 1796 (Dan Sherman
<dsherman`at`sdcc3.ucsd.edu>) for the source of my numbers on grain volume; for
heat capacity data I used info in HBD 1880 ("Wallinger, W. A."
<WAWA`at`chevron.com>) although another post I just now found in HBD 1879
(fredriks`at`abel.math.umu.se (Fredrik Stahl)) corroborates your numbers.

My contribution to the carboy cleaning thread is this : TSP. It has been
my practice to fill a dirty carboy about 25% full of water and add 
"some" TSP. "Some" is a purely unmeasured amount and probably way to much
but what's a couple of more teaspoons full gonna hurt? I shake the carboy to
disolve the TSP, then fill the carboy up. I let the carboy sit at least 4 
hours, but most often overnight. When it time actually clean the vessel, the 
caked on trub, crud and stuff, virtually wipes off. I do use a "carboy" brush, 
but the "crud" virtually falls right off without scrubbing. This works
very well for me, and might for you, give it a try!

I would definitely not recommend the use of this material for this application

galvanic corrosion. Plus, as soon at the zinc dissolves away, you will be
tasting iron.  Frankly, I would use aluminum or Plastic - HDPE, if stainless is
not an option.


You know, I bet if you work on it, you could probably find a way to use some
inexpensive piece of aluminum or stainless cookware as the chamber. Drill a few
holes, put a gasket under the lid, I bet it could work. 


Bear in mind that I have not built a RIMS unit myself, I am speaking from a
materials perspective to the working fluid.

I couldn't disagree more.  1 cup of bleach in a 5-7 gallon carboy, 
fill and let sit for a few days, then rinse.  Trivial.

Subject: Yeast storage temperatures


        I have a yeast bank and wonder what would be the prefered 
temperature for it to be stored?


        Also, is there a source of yeast bank stocks prepared for storage 
at freezer temperatures?
                
        Thanks for the advice and all the interesting submissions.
