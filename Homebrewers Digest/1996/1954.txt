Subject: kegging - prime or charge/plastic buckets


On the subject of using the 5 gal soda kegs for storage, I have read of
priming the keg much in the same way as if one were bottling. Also I have
read of charging the filled keg with CO2 and letting the beer absorb the gas,
or charge and shake the keg to encourage the absorbtion of CO2.


If anyone has thoughts on which process works best ( I know, different things
work best for different folks ) I would like to see the discussion.


I have read previously about using food grade plastic buckets for primary
fermentation but just the other day J. Matthew Saunders stated that one
should not use a bucket that contained pickles or olives - why?

Subject: More electric boiler questions






Thanks again for all the responses to my query about the
Bruheat electric boiler.  I am planning to buy one within the
few weeks.  I would like to get some more input on the
connection of the boiler.  In my house, the laundry room is off
the kitchen, and I plan to use the dryer outlet for my power
source.  I plan to make a heavy duty (12 guage) extension
cord with a dryer plug on one end, and whatever outlet is
needed on the other.  Does this sound OK, so far?  In previous
discussion on electric boilers, someone (sorry, I forget who)
sugggested including a ground fault interupter (GFI) in the
circuit.  This sounds like a good idea, but I'm not sure how to
do this.  I went to the local homeowners' outlet, and they had
plenty of GFI-equiped circuit breakers for 120 VAC, but didn't 
have a good replacement for the 240 VAC , 30 amp breaker on my dryer
circuit.  Does anyone know if such an item exists?  If it does,
I should be able to find it at an electical supply house.
Putting the GFI in the circuit box seems like the simplest way
to deal with this.  Anyone else have any suggestions?  Does
anyone know, for example, if it's possible/practicle to include
a GFI in the extension cord?  As always, any suggestions will
be greatly appreciated.


Brew on!

Subject: 5L Mini Kegging System


I am interested in comments on the 5L mini kegging system. =20


I am new to home brewing and ready to brew my first batch.  I think the =
mini keg system would be ideal for me.  It would probably take me 1 or 2 =
weeks to finish a mini keg.  They are small enough to fit into the frig, =
and convenient enough that I could let a friend borrow it. =20


I have read through HBD from 1995-present.  There seams to be mixed =
opinions on the mini keg system. =20


Being new to homebrewing, I would hate to invest in a system I would not =
be happy with.  I don't want to become discouraged and quit brewing. =20


I really like the idea of the mini kegging system but wonder if I would =
be better off with the Party Pig.  I have not read much here on the pig. =
=20


I really hate the idea of bottling.  I think if I bottle I won't be as =
likely to brew as much.  I really need some form of a "mini-kegging" =
system.  The corny system is not an option.


Being new to homebrewing I can use all the help I can get.


Thanks-Scott

Subject: Copper Pipe






In a recent posting about the use of galvanized pipe in a RIMS,
Keith Royster mentioned that others had suggested the use of
copper.  Keith responded that he needed 1" pipe, and had not
seen copper any larger than 1/2".  Larger sizes may not be
available from the standard homewners outlet, but copper pipe
in diameters of 1" and greater does exist, and should be 
readily available, in whatever length is needed, from a full
service plumbing supply house.

My last batch had a similar result. I also noticed some strange branching
type formation in the boiling pot before it reached a boil and the same thing
in the pot after cooling with my immersion chiller.  I used 1# Klages and
1/2# crystal 40L in a minimash with a 6# bag of Northwestern gold syrup.  My
boil volume was 3 gallons. I brought it up to 5.5gal in the primary. The s.g.
in the primary fermenter after cooling and shaking to aerate was 1.030.  I
chalked it up to stratification.  Now I wonder if there is something else.
 What type of malt syrup did you use? 


I just racked this beer to a secondary yesterday and it tasted fine but the
s.g. was still at 1.017.  The primary ferment was 7 days so I'm sure its
done.

Subject: Bottle/Carboy washer problem


I have had a problem with the "Jet carboy  bottle washer"  ever since I
bought it. The product really does work well, HOWEVER every time I take a
bottle off of the pin, I get a HUGE water hammer. I'm afraid that this will
harm my copper plumbing. (It's also annoying to others in the same home). 
 
I have thought that placing something compliant in the run would help - how
about one of those rubber drain flushers that expands to fit your sink
drain? 
 
Anyone else have one of these and/or this experience (or not)?

Dear Friends, just a quickie to advise anyone out there who cares 
that my web pages now have a new home.  Everything appears to be up 
and running fine as far as I can tell.  The new URL for my home page 
is


http://audio.apana.org.au/ddraper/home.html


and for the the beer page is


http://audio.apana.org.au/ddraper/beer.html


I'd also like to announce that my beer page is the proud Official
Home of Pat Anderson's new Windows program TINIBUw.  This is a
Windows version of a DOS-based program I wrote to calculate IBU
levels using Glenn Tinseth's recent utilization data.  Pat took the 
one or two lines of my code that did the calc and built a very nifty, 
easy to use Windows app.  It's free, folks, and that's a very good 
price (to paraphrase Tom Peterson!).  You will find it in the Other 
Items Of Interest section of the Beer page.


Cheers, Dave in Sydney

Subject: pressurised fermentation (correction)


I have a correction to my post on pressurised fermentation.


I said,
>The effect of this process with ale yeast is to increase diacetyl levels.
Fusel oils are not uniformally inhibited by CO2.


This is incorrect. In the paper referred to the fusel oil concentration
(n-propanol, iso-butanol and iso-amyl alcohols) were all decreased with
respect to the control fermentation with ale yeast. 


In summary, pressurised fermentation at 2 atm CO2 had the following effects:
slowed ethanol production
reduction in fusel oils
reduced yeast growth
increase in pH
increase of VDKs for ale yeast - no change or decreased VDKs for lager yeast.


My apologies in reposting about this, but I had just skimmed the article
beforehand and got some important information wrong! I thought it was better
to repost with the correct data, after a more careful reading.


Whether this works in a homebrewing setup is indeterminate. Note that the
CO2 pressure was maintained throughout the fermentation. The effect of not
applying pressure until mid-ferment was not discussed in the report. There
is some evidence that the slowed fermentation is responsible for the effects
listed. Agitating a pressurised fermentation increased ethanol production
rate, but also fusel oil levels, for example.


It also appears that a similar effect can be obtained simply by lowering the
fermentation temperature from 20C to 12C. This has the following effects:


temp * fermentation * fusel oil concentration * final cell  * final pH* VDKs
     * speed (hrs)  * n-prop * i-but * i-amyl * number x10e7*         * mg/l
*****************************************************************************
20NP * 18           * 14.5   * 52.5  * 86.0   * 9.2         * 4.25    * 0.1
20P  * 37           * 6.0    * 31.0  * 69.0   * 7.1         * 4.65    * 0.6
12NP * 58           * 5.0    * 43.5  * 68.5   * 7.5         * 4.55    * 0.6


key:
20NP - 20 degrees C not pressurised
20P - 20 degrees C pressurised to 28psi CO2
12NP - 12 degrees C not pressurised


VDKs = final vicinal diketone & precursor levels. Note that this is measured
after an extended rest period.


n-prop = n-propanol
i-but  = iso-butanol
i-amyl = iso-amyl alcohols


We already knew that lowering fermentation temperature slowed fermentation
speed and reduced fusel oil production. It appears that fermenting under
pressure gives a similar (but not identical) result. 


I hope I got it right this time!


Andy.

Subject: liquid vs. dry yeast


Hello fellow homebrewers,


I am a novice homewbrewer and am puzzled by the fermentation differences 
in dry vs. liquid yeast.


Previously I have used a liquid yeast in a foil package #1028 London 
English Ale which has a buldge inside that you pop and let sit 24 hrs 
before adding to a starter of h20 and malt extract.  Fermentation has 
always been completed in the 14 days as recommened.  No problem.


Feeling brave, or just wanting to test my nerve, this time I used a dry 
yeast which was simply disolved in 2 oz warm h20 15 minutes before pitching.


For the first 8 days I saw nothing happening and was growing concerned 
that either I missed the entire activity, or it was going to be a total 
bust.  Finally on day 9 the bubbles were visible in the air lock device 
and have continued with regularity since.  I am now on day 15 in the 
fermeneter.  I use a single fermentation process and wonder when I might 
expect the activity to subside.  Everything I've read indicates to wait 
3-4 days after visible activity before bottling/proceeding.


Any suggestions?  Besides patience :-}


Thanks,
ptown brewer

Hi guys (which is my p.c. way of also including women & that's the only p.c.
statement I'll ever make here):


I'm new to the digest, introduced by Kit Anderson of Bath, Maine (Hi Kit),
who is helping me learn to homebrew & set up my own home brewery.


I'm a writer working feverishly on a project called Pub Tours: A Travel
Guide to New England Brewpubs & Microbreweries for Down East Books of
Camden, Maine, due out in Oct. '96.


I need: 


        (1) a list of your favorite N.E. brewpubs w/comments about the
beer/s, food, atmosphere;


        (2) homebrew recipes from N.E. folks, especially if they've won
awards (make sure you tell me what award & from whom);


        (3) this is a long-shot, but if you know anyone from New England who
is even a tad famous/well-known (sports figure, writer, political figure,
etc) and they would like to be featured in the book (quaffing a pint at
their favorite brewpub), contact me off-digest & let me know.


        Thanks for your help, and I'm sure I'll be posting more when I begin

Subject: galvanized pipes safe?  Give me a break...


KBD Community,
        I am not a medical doctor so what follows is strictly my opinion.  I
will apologize right away for a waste of bandwidth.
        However, I can't sit idle when I read stuff like this.  Keith thinks
that zinc in his beer, leeched from galvanized pipes, might be good fo rhim.
        Well, after a nice treatise on zinc in a persons diet, and the
warning about the effects of too much zinc, Keith concludes that galvanized
pipes must be ok to use.
        Where do we learn how much zinc gets into the wort?  How do we know
if some other compound in the galvanized pipes is unsafe?  
       Zinc might not kill us but it could be toxic if the doeses are large?
Hmmm, what conclusion should be reached here?
        I don't know about this comment but I sure am suspicious: 'Whats
good for us in small doses must be good for the yeast'.
        Let me ask this, are there galvanized pipes in restaurant kitchens
or in residential  kitchens?  I'll just bet there is a good reason for this
and it isn't some over-reaction.
        I sure am glad that Keith is not in my home-brew club.

Bruheat is such a catchy name, that spelling errors would catch a few
different products.  My UK product was changed to 120V for the NA market.  I
used it with the brewbag of solid sailcloth sides with a mesh bottom.  This
maintained such a magnificent variety of different temperatures throughout
the mash that I now use it only for collecting sparge water.  I took the
trouble to clad it in wood.  But until I add acid to my sparge, this
equipment is useless for me.  YMMV, of course.

Jeff says about open fermentation and dogs:


<It

<really good reason to avoid the system.


My labrador retriever is an integral component of all my brewing,
he insists!  Ive come to conclude that he has no negative effects
on my brewing but I dont let him drink right out of the fermenter,
he has to wait till its done!!  


Despite being a happy advocate of open fermentation I have to admit
that soon I will be returning to the world of closed fermenters.  This
is not due to any problem with years of open fermentation but to my
recent purchase of a unitank.  See, I use my lauter tun as my open
fermenter and I have gotten sick of hauling the thing up and down my
basement stairs between my brewhouse and cellar.  The unitank will
allow me to control fermenter temps (as well as CIP the tank, spund,
push beer through a rough filter straight into kegs, etc.)  This will
also finally free up my lauter tun to be what it is, a dedicated unit.
I hope I still like my beers!

and actually, I see no benefit to removing the cold break so completely.

Over-kill again, IMO. However, I do think there may actually be some benefit
to using pure oxygen, since it's possible to get more O2 into solution, but
I don't really think it's necessary, at least not for me. If I had some cash
to burn I'd probably buy the pure O2, but I'm happy with 20% (air), since
it's still free.

I agree with the first part of this statement, but not the last sentence.
Aeration makes the yeast grow faster and thus decreases lag time.

Actually, cold break forms faster the faster you chill. I don't think
chilling the wort faster necessarily gives a "better" break, it just speeds
up the kinetics of precipitation. Solubility is dependent on temperature; to
get "better", more complete precipitation of the cold break, you need to
chill the wort to a lower final temperature. The rate at which this is
accomplished will not significantly affect the total yield, in most cases.
However, if you really want to remove ALL of it, chilling to near freezing
and waiting longer (like overnight) is the best way to go. I remove what
hot/cold break I can from the kettle and leave the remaining cold break in
the fermenter (nutrients, ya know).

Subject: Blow-off tubes, Yeast pitching rates


     Regarding HBD 1953:
     >>Tom Lombardo (favt3tl`at`rvcux1.RVC.CC.IL.US)
     >>Subject: Don't blow off the blow-off
     
     This post was really more about yeast pitching than about 
     blow-off tubes. 
     
     Tom was increasing his pitching rate by doing a starter.  The 
     result required a blow-off tube.  
        Solution: Get a larger fermenter, and get rid of the        
                  blow-off tube.
     ----BUT----
     Regarding yeast pitching rates, I read the following in 
     Zymurgy.  Since it was very interesting, and short, felt it 
     was worth putting out on HBD.
     
     Reprinted in  Zymurgy, Winter, Vol 18 No. 5.
     From: "Effects of Yeast Pitch Rates on Fermentation 
     Performance and Beer Quality" by Cindy Edelen Presented at the 
     MBAA Conference, Sept. 1994.  
     
     A 1.064 original gravity wort from one production brew was 
     split between four 10-barrel fermenters and pitched with 12.8, 
     30.3, 53.8 and 74.9 X 10(to the power of 6--couldn't show this 
     in txt) viable cells per milliliter, respectively.  This is 
     equivalent to about one-half to four times the normal amounts 
     used in brewing high-gravity lager beers. fermentation rates 
     were about two hours faster per additional million cells 
     permilliliter pitched.      <here comes the interesting part>  
     Increasing the pitching rates resulted in lower IBU levels and 
     lower free amino nitrogen (FAN) utilization.  Higher ester 
     levels resulted from lower pitching rates.  Higher alcohol 
     yield was found in higher pitch rates, including an increase 
     in fusel alcohol.  Panels found higher hop aroma and hop 
     intensities in low pitch rates.
         
     ------------------------------------------------------------
     BTW, I spoke to someone a while back regarding reprinting 
     articles from Zymurgy in club news letters.  The person I 
     talked to said they didn't mind so long as the reprinting of 
     any material was not for profit and due credit was given.
     Based on this, and the fact that the above was reprinted from 
     another publication, I don't think they would be offended 
     with the above post.
     ------------------------------------------------------------
     Cheers

No. I think that you just did a diacetyl rest!  It could clean up your beer
considerably.  Drop the temp back down slowly to 2F now and put it into your 
garage for lagering for a month or so.

Fellow Homebrewers,


Have you ever had trouble finding that just right grain in just the
right quantity?  Have you ever tried in vain to find that certain hard
to find piece of equipment?  Well so have I.


So I got busy and did something about it.  I am currently working to
compile a list of homebrew  mail-order suppliers.


WHAT MAKES THIS LIST DIFFERENT FROM OTHER LISTS ON THE INTERNET:
This list covers only suppliers that meet all of the following criteria:
(1) The supplier must offer a variety of products for home brewing (with a
few exceptions). 
(2) The supplier must ship those products anywhere in the continental USA. 
(3) The supplier must offer printed catalogs free to those who ask.
(4) The supplier must be based in the United States.
(5) The supplier must have either a toll free number or e-mail address for
ordering copies of their catalogs.
(6) Most importantly, I must have actually seen and held their catalog and
verified the information prior to its entry into this list.


There are reputable companies who do not meet the above criteria, but
generally speaking, they are not the focus of my list.


So...if you would like a copy of the list that has been compiled to date
drop me an e-mail at:


mike`at`datasync.com


The list is currently about 10 pages long.  By the time I finish with it
this spring I expect it will be about 30 pages.  


And PLEASE don't send me the names of any companies who are not on the
current list.  I already have a list of over 200 more campanies that I am
currently researching.  I will ask for the names of companies that have been
left out AFTER I finish this research.

     Here is a question that some of you may find a bit silly, but I'm 
     going to ask it...
     
     I have some beer which was brewed at least 10 years ago by my 
     ex-wife's grandfather (I don't remember what it is. It is amber in 
     colour, but I don't remember if it is an Ale or a Lager). I stumbled 
     across four bottles in my dads garage (he never drank it when I gave 
     it to him years ago). 
     
     Anyhow, I'm wondering if this beer is still good. I know that some 
     beers don't age well.
     
     It looks nice and clear, the sediment looks normal... 
     
     When I pop these open, what should I look for?

Why would you ever lift a _full_ carboy into a sink for cleaning. Way
too dangerous, IMO.


I set the carboy on the counter next to the sink, and fill it using an
a 1" tube just jammed into the faucet.  I put a little bleach and a
little tsp into it during the filling, and leave it there overnight.
Next morning I siphon from the bottle into the sink, and then scrub
with the bristle brush if neccessary. Generally it self cleans.


I then pick up and rinse the nearly empty carboy with one of those jet
spray things attached to the faucet. I also always use one of those
orange carboy handles to be sure I've got a good grip.


No straining with a possibly slippery heavy carboy, and a very easy
cleaning.


[I once sliced my fingers when a Sparkletts glass carboy just came
apart in my hands - cut tendons and nerves in one finger - 90%
recovery after surgery. Even though that was 24 years ago when I was
16, I still am _Very_ _Cautious_ when I handle these carboys. When the
glass in these carboys breaks, it's like what happens when a stretched
rubber band breaks. There's a release of tension, and it will actually
fly apart.]


I just offer this because I try to reduce the moving of full carboys
to a minimum, and I wouldn't want to see any other HB'ers get hurt.


Good brewing,

Subject: H2S and Lagering


I use yeasts that produce H2S, or at least a similar rank smell,
during primary fermentation. This smell doesn't end up in the 
finished product. I use the lagering procedure outlined by DeClerk
in his two-volume work. Basically, one lagers at 1-2 degrees C and
lets the evolving gases escape for a few days. DeClerk says as much as
7-14 days. Then, "bung it up". That is: close the pressure valve. Set
it at 0.3 atmospheres and leave it there for 2.5-3 months. Filter or
serve as is. I use corny kegs with a relief valve on the "IN" valve.
Once a week or so, I check the pressure and release any excess.


The escaping gas during early secondary fermentation helps to scrub the
oxygen and other gases out. The yeast continue to adjust the gas
composition (Fungbuckett, or stench, disappears as the beer matures).


I think that some of my lagers that smelled the worst during and after
primary tasted the best after a LONG lagering. Impatient brewers would
be well advised to stick to top-fermenting strains!


A question for those still reading...


Anybody have any data on the yeast cells still in suspension in a
naturally clarified lager beer?

I strongly recommend AGAINST the use of plastic of any kind.  No

time do something stupid like let the liquid out of the system with

you will get smoke and most likely burned on wort on the element by
the time you notice it.  Chances are good that with a plastic chamber
of any kind, you will get a fire.  If you were to install some kind of
thermal cutout switch set at around 200F, you may save your chestnuts
from the fire.

While a good idea, the volume of the chamber is critical.  If the
volume exceeds that of a 1 1/2" pipe by too much, the contact time
with the heater will be increased and there is a danger of scorching.
If the volume can be kept down, might just work out.

Actually, we were talking about pros and cons of the 'Blow-off method', and
I agreed with JS, that it was more difficult to clean your primary after
using a blow-off, than when using a plastic or steel primary.

While cleaning carboys in multiple sessions may be easy for some folks, it's
not at all convenient for others.  The beer I made was a weizen, and it took
two days of soaking (yes, with bleach) and still required a bottle brush.
Now, I don't know where some folks PITA-threshold is, but that's over mine.
If I had used my other fermenter, I could have had it clean in 5-10 minutes.
That's one session and no need for bleach at all!


I think C. Rosen (in HBD #1953) said it best...

Yeah, what HE said!


BTW, you computer guys never heard of attaching binary files to messages?
You sure as heck CAN spread viruses via e-mail!  That doesn't mean that the
virus mentioned is not a hoax, but be careful about calling folks amatures
when we live a world of ever-changing technology.  OK, I'll relinquish the
floor in favor of more scientific, cool stuff...
