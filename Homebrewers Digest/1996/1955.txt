  huh?  Something is wrong here.  Usually chrome is harder than nickel.
  Even if a hard nickel bath was used the end product would only be
  (approx.) 43c Rockwell, while hard chrome is 64-70c Rockwell. 
  (decorative nickel is less than 20c Rockwell, I dont know how hard
  decorative chrome is.)(1)
  Nickel is actually the bright silver you see on car bumpers, and
  chrome is put on top of that to protect the nickel.
  Does anyone have this mill?  If the rollers are yellow, like tarnished
  silver they are nickel, if they are still bright - chrome.


  On cylinder walls and rollers, usually hard chrome is used.

  this also is confusing.  more info please.  how does the knurling harden
  the steel?  I can't imagine it getting hotter than when it is formed or
  welded?  what kind of steel alloy has a significant amount of nickel?


  I dont mean to pick nits, but this is a topic that is close to home
  and kinda bugs me with misinformation.  Of course hard nickel may
  be harder than decorative chrome, and i'll have to eat my foot, if
  this is the case.
  I made my own mill, and i had the rollers nickel/chrome plated and 
  its holding up fine.  The main concern is the base metal.  You cant
  make steel softer by plating on it.  The plater could also be telling
  the manufacturer what he wants to hear.


  Jeez, this is getting off berwing.

I can't offer a certain explanation, but I can offer what Papazian
describes as his "educated" guess: yeast perform better at lower
pressures.  The beer in the normally filled bottle built up pressure
more rapidly (with less headspace, an equal amount of gas released
will obviously cause more pressure sooner), thus the yeast in that
bottle stopped "working" that much sooner.  The fact that the
difference is not particularly dramatic would even account for the
fact that the effect you noticed is "slight."

Subject: corking bottle-condiitioned saison


A humble question for the mighty collective:


i've been trying to duplicate a nectar-like Belgian saison, namely =
Saison de Pipaix. (Brasserie Vapeur.)  Since i'll be doing a healthy =
Belgian-style bottle-priming, i'd like to also cork and cap the 750 ml =
champagne bottles, similar to the original product.  These bottles would =
then be laid down for six months to 6 years or so.  so i'm getting a bit =
paranoid about oxidation and infections and such.  Most of my anxiety is =
coming from the corks.  i understand that corks are "sulphured" or =
"sulphited" in manufacture.  i guess vinists soak the corks in a =
sulphite solution before corking.  my worry (make that "concern") is =
that sulphite kills yeast; the last thing i want to do to a bottle =
conditioned ale!  my inclination is to boil or steam the corks for 15 =
minutes.  but i heard cork can not be sterilized in such a way.


So...  how do i sterilize the darn corks?  ..and ... Are off-the-shelf =
corks sulfited in such a way that would be bad for bottle-condidtioned =
beer?


much thanks in advance!

Subject: Good Times hoax


   I'm going to waste a little more bandwidth. This virus keeps reanimating
like zombies in "Night of the Living Dead". We actually had our network
administrator- who should know better- post an email warning to everyone on
the system. Sigh. Maybe we coul drive a stake through its heart after sewing
rock salt in its mouth to finish it off.


   Now a brewing question:
 I recently bottled an ESB using WYeast's London Ale yeast. Being out of town
a lot, I left the beer sitting in the secondary for about 3 months before
bottling. After 3 weeks the beer has a somewhat off-taste that I cannot
place. If appropriate care is taken regarding temperature stability, light
protection and sanitation, should there be any problem leaving beer in the
secondary for such an extended length of time? Does anyone think that the
beer might mellow with age? It tastes pretty good anyway.


   TIA,

Subject: First lager


- -- [ From: Mike Kidulich * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --


Greetings,


I am preparing to do my first lager (this is my third batch). I just
obtained a California Common kit, that includes hops, grains, malt extract,
and Wyeast California #2112 yeast. What temperature do I pitch at, and how
long will I need to wait before moving it to my basement? My basement has
been maintaining a relatively steady 58dF to 60dF. How long will the beer
need to ferment in the secondary? I also have an IPA kit, so I see a second
carboy in my future.


Also, what is a good method for removing pellet hops from the wort? I wound
up just dumping the whole mess into the primary when I did my last batch (a
very dark, dry stout), and racking the wort off the trub after one week.
Still had a lot of sediment in the secondary, and 24 hrs after bottling,
some of the bottles have a lot of sediment already.


TIA,


Mike Kidulich

Hmmm.  I have *never* heard of so slow a start to fermentation with
rehydrated ale yeast; 14 - 18 hours is typical in my experience.


The only question that I can think of off-hand (yeah, it's kind of
obvious, but ingoring the obvious can lead to overlooking facts
concealed in plain sight):  you did not rehydrate the yeast in
water so "warm" as to kill the yeast (and allow random chance knows
what to attack your wort)?

Subject: Stupid sink tricks - (was cleaning carboys), Zinc


Jay Reeves says to be careful about adding hot water to carboys.  I agree.  We
have kids and our hot water is set low enough so that 100% hot water still
won't burn you.  Maybe it's just "very warm".  We should all get Pyrex carboys.


As far a lifting full carboys onto the sink goes - don't do it.  Take the
carboy and set it on the counter next to the sink.  Take the handle off the
little sprayer used for rinsing dishes.  Stick the sprayer tubing into the
carboy and turn the water on.  Slower than a garden hose but it works.


As far as zinc goes, Noonan claims in "Brewing Lager Beers" that zinc  at .1
to .2 ppm is a yeast nutrient, but in excess of 1 ppm (~20 mg in a 5 gallon
batch) it is toxic to yeast.

If you see the word "Lacto" or "Lactobacillus" in the subject of an e-mail 
message, DO NOT READ IT!!!!!!  It will immediately contaminate any beer in 
the fermenter or bottle with Lactobacillus, causing an overly sour beer. 
(If you are brewing a Wit or Berliner Weiss, you may wish to read it anyway,
but BE CAREFUL!!!!!!)


Many uninformed newbies have already been affected by this.  Spread the word
to all brewing clubs and homebrew shops.  Simply print out this message and

From: Marty Tippin <martyt`at`sky.net>
Subject: Hot/Cold Break, Pickle Buckets


I just bottled my latest batch last night and was astonished at how clear it
was - usually, it takes several weeks in the bottle for my batches to get as
clear as this one was.  


I did a couple of things different on this batch and am trying to figure out
which one(s) contributed to this clear beer:


I made a manifold out of some 3/8" soft copper tubing with lots of small
holes drilled in the bottom, and attached it to the easy masher spigot
inside my kettle.  After the boil, I drained the kettle through the manifold
and into my newly constructed counterflow chiller and on to the fermenter.
(oh - I also left the hop plugs loose during the boil instead of in a bag).
After draining the kettle and having lots of trouble with the manifold
clogging, there was lots of gunk (hot break and the remains of 1 oz of
pellets I also used in the boil) and I didn't have nearly the amount of
break material in the fermenter as usual.


Normally, I use an immersion chiller in the kettle after the boil, have the
hops in a bag and just pour the whole thing into the fermenter after it's
cooled.  I usually wind up with a thick (like 4 to 6" deep) glob of break
material in the bottom of the fermenter which then floats to the top and
gets generally mixed around during the ferment, eventually settling back to
the bottom.  The result has been some less than sparkling beer, although
Polyclar and other agents used prior to bottling always seem to help.


*My* analysis is that the manifold helped strain out a lot of the hot break
material that normally goes into the fermenter and the absence of that hot
break is what helped make everything more clear.  The counterflow chiller
should have (and, in fact, may have) produced more cold break material than
the immersion chiller, but since I've been dumping the whole thing - hot and
cold break - into the fermenter, I never knew the difference.  


What do the rest of you think?  Did I do something right here or just get
lucky??  




On a totally unrelated note, Paul VanSlyke asks why one shouldn't use pickle
buckets for primary fermenters.


The general reasoning is that it's nearly impossible to get the pickle or
olive or whatever smell out of the buckets and you'll end up with
pickle-flavored beer.  Baloney.  I've been using several buckets for the
past year that were originally pickle containers and never was able to
notice any pickle aroma or flavor in my beer.  


It takes a little work, but ridding one of those buckets of most of the
pickle smell is no big deal.  Soak the bucket in a strong bleach solution
for several days, then rinse it and put in direct sunlight for a few more
days.  The UV from the sun does something to help get rid of the smell.  If
the smell is still there, wet the inside and sprinkle some baking soda on it
and wait another day or two.  By that point, most of the smell should be
gone - anything that remains certainly won't be enough to mess with the
flavor of your beer.  After fermenting a couple of batches in the bucket,
the pickle smell will be history.

Not 'must' be OK.  I beleive I said probably, or something to that 
effect.  I drew no definative conclusions, only informed opinions.


> Where do we learn how much zinc
> gets into the wort?  


We (I) didn't.  I even asked if someone else knew this information.
But I do know that it is safe to use copper or aluminum kettles, and
both of those elements are important in our diets at low levels and
also toxic at higher levels.  Now I know I can't just assume that
zinc dissolves at a similar rate as copper or aluminum, and I don't
know how their good VS toxic levels compare, but I'm willing to bet
that they are similar enough that, adding that zinc's toxic level is
a factor of AT LEAST ten times that of its RDA level, there is no
serious health risk.  And I had discussions with many other HBDers
who basically agreed that the risk was more of a ruined beer nature
(metallic taste) than a ruined health nature.  BTW, I have been using 
my boiling kettle with about 6 inches of galvanized pipe inside of it 
as a pickup/siphon for the spigot and noone's died yet ;)

Galvanized piping does exist that delivers potable (drinkable) water
to you.  In fact, as I mentioned in my post, David Miller even 
mentions that these pipes are of no concern to brewers becuase they 
do not leach zinc into the drinking water.  Of course, wort is a 
different story becuase of its lower pH.

You make your bets and I'll make mine.  You obviously view me as
careless and I view you as overreactionary.  Everyone has different
tolerances of risk.  I did my research, and made some assumptions,
and have concluded that my risk is insignificant.  I would just like
to point out that, while I supported my *opinions* with facts and
information, you have not offered any new information, only fear of
the unknown.

There are two reasons not to use a food grade pail that contained pickles
or olives.


1)  They have a strong flavour that lingers in the bucket and can create
off flavours in your beer.


2)  (This may well be my own paranoia.....) You want to keep wort (beer)
and must (wine) away from vinegar.  Vinegar is basically the same thing as
wine (or beer I suppose, though I've never heard of beer vinegar) but the
beasties that convert it are different.  Those beasties will happily turn a
lovely batch of Bitter or Stout into vinegar rather than yummy home-brew.


I'm curious to hear from others in the collective as to whether my second
suspicion is valid.  Can a pail that held vinegar be trusted?


Cheers!
Matthew.

Subject: Separating Hot Trub




I need some advice on how best to separate hot trub
from wort.  I use an 8 gallon enamel canning kettle for a
brew pot, and an immersion wort cooler.  Is it better to:


1) install a spigot in the side of the kettle, whirl-pool the
wort, and then drain it into the carboy?


    BUT: how do I install such a spigot without it leaking?
    Where do I find such a spigot?  An easy-masher would
    be possible, but I don't need it for mashing- I have a
    slotted manifold in my Gott cooler and use steam
     injection for step-mashing.  Any cheaper alternatives?


2) forget installing the spigot, and simply whirlpool and
siphon the cooled wort into the carboy?


   BUT: how do I start such a siphon without contaminating
   the wort?  When siphoning from a carboy I usually use a
   carboy cap and sanitized milk jug (like suggested in
   Brewing Techniques several issues ago).  I had used
   Charlie Papazian's "water in the siphon hose" technique
   previously, but am leery of using it with unfermented
   wort.  Needless to say, sucking on the siphon hose is
   also out.


Which would you recommend?  Thanks for the help.

I have found clear references in "Brewing" by Lewis and Young that aeration
is very necessary for the assimilation of *saturated* fatty acids. From
other references in Malting and Brewing Science I wouldn't want anything but
traces of those left in the beer.
I seem also to keep reading passing references to the negative effects of
*too fast* a ferment, caused by a combination of excess O2, excess Amino
acids, and excess lipids? Noone explains how but it apparently produces off
flavours at the expense of alcohol?


Jonathon also posts,

JM>aeration in order to saturate with the correct amounts of oxygen.  In fact,
JM>I've read that it is not possible to appropriately oxygenate such wort

I'd like the reference for that, as I'm investigating lipids. I think that
yeast, like us, are basically lazy and use unsaturated lipids first. If they
can't assimilate enough unsaturated fatty acids and sterols, they sythesise
them with O2 from saturated ones. Cold break is another source of lipids (in
colloidal suspension), without it *in a wort with low soluble lipids* (very
important) yeast needs to use lots of O2 to assimilate saturated lipids to
synthesise unsaturated ones and sterols for cell building. (BTW yeast also
excrete both kinds) 
I'm coming to the opinion that low soluble lipids is a "good thing", because
cold break can be used as a secondary source. The advantage of cold break as
a source is that the unused lipids can be removed after lag by removing the
cold break, enhancing head and staling stability.

The real Bruheat manufactured by Ritchie in Burton on Trent and =

I have only had two bottles crack/explode on me (I keep all in sturdy 
cardboard boxes with lids, and never saw/heard one actually explode, but saw
the results later).  Both were the last bottle filled, half full or less.


Up to then I never worried about it, but now I use that last half-full 
bottle to taste the beer early.


Two hypotheses come to mind, though.  This is the last bottle filled and 
occasionally (usually?) may have more sugar in it due to my batch-priming 
method that may leave some residue on the bottom of the bottling bucket.  Or
the fill-level may be significant.


I think it would be important to ensure that experiments eliminate the 
"too much sugar at end of bottling" possibility.

In Charlies book, in the step mashing chart, for 8 lbs:


8 qts 130=B0F water - mash in to reach 122=B0F.
4 qts 200=B0F water - added to reach 150=B0F.


The 8 qts 130=B0F water and 8 lbs grains does settle `at` 122=B0F, however
adding 4 qts 200=B0F water does not settle `at` 150=B0F, but rather 140=B0F.


He mentions 18=B0F temp rise for 1/2 qt water per pound of grain.


Do I need to heat the mash up to 132=B0F and then add the 4 qts 200=B0F=
 water?


This has caused me a couple of headaches, but no bad beer.

A friend gave me two buckets once: a pickle bucket and a pepperoncini
bucket. They had very strong odors of their former contents.  I bleached
'em, used TSP on 'em, put both bleach and TSP in 'em, left 'em in the
sunlight and still after two weeks of this treatment, they smelled strongly
of pickles and pepperoncinis. Then, I made beer in 'em.


The beer tasted fine. Absolutely no pickle or pepper flavors (damn!). After
bottling the beer, the buckets had that wonderful smell of a bucket just
used for brewing - sort of hoppy, malty, yeasty aroma.  Two weeks later, I
brewed another batch and got the pickle bucket out to use. It reeked of
pickles. I used it anyway and the beer was fine. 


Now after three years the smell is just about gone. If I had my choice of
free buckets, I would choose sweeter smelling ones but these two certainly
have worked out.  Under no means would I ever use buckets that had non food
items like detergent, chemicals, etc.


By the way, a local doughnut shop sells their buckets for a buck. And they
clean them first. They get them with fruit filling. I picked up four to
store grain in to keep the mice out. There's nothing quite like seeing a
mouse go through your malt mill.

What type of hoses do folks use for high temperature stuff (like sparge
water, siphon after the boil, etc)?  I've looked around and I can't find
anything that looks very good that is both ok for drinking water and able to
deal with the temperatures.   Here's what I've found:


polyethylene - This is a milky white tubing that is listed as drinking water
               safe.  It works ok, but is brittle and cracks quickly if used
               at high temps.
               
PVC - I found a braided tubing that works pretty well, but I'm not sure it's
      cool for drinking water.
      
vinyl - The standard tubing that all brew stores carry (right?  I think
        they're usually vinyl).  This stuff gets REAL soft at sparge
        temperatures.  Not sure it would work well at all at boiling
        temperatures....
        
Anyhow, what type of hoses do other folks use for these sorts of
applications?  Is the PVC safe to use for brewing?

Subject: Slow/no start with Scottish Ale Yeast


I have a fermentation worry.  I brewed a sortofakindofa Scottish strong ale
over the weekend (or more correctly, I mashed the grains, boiled the wort,
and pitched the yeast). This is a first for me with this yeast (Wyeast
Scottish, I forget the number). I ended up with a fairly big starter (big
for me, at least - about 200ml of slurry in 700ml of wort with a subsiding
kreusen. The product of two step-ups from the slap pack, the second step-up
consisting of pouring new wort on the slurry of the first).  I found a nice
cool uninsulated closet in my basement to store it during primary
(maintaining a constant 58F, which I have been led to believe is the proper
temp for this yeast, although the starter was cultured between 65-68F).


Anyway, this ale is high gravity with a lot of fermentables (and
non-fermentables).  It should be going like gangbusters by now. But the
yeast has done nothing in 48 hours.  Nothing.  Might as well have been sand
I poured in there.  Should I move it back to my usual fermenting corner
(temp ~68F), should I wait, or should I rouse the critters, or what?

This is what I've done for my electric stove.  You can buy a 220 
receptacle (single or dual) that looks very much like a 110 receptacle 
except one and or both of the terminals are parallel to the floor 
instead of vertical to the floor as is the case with 110.  House the 
receptacle in a plastic utility box (the box you would nail to the 
side of a stud if you were installing a receptacle in a house).  For 
my purposes, this gives me a convenient outlet that sticks out from under 
the stove, making it easy to plug and unplug the Bruheat when needed
during the brewing process.

You're talking about the Electrim Boiler, a Johnny Come Lately to the 
electric boiler market.  They have since removed the 110 version of 
this product from the market because of all the problems people were 
having with it.  Please don't confuse it with the Bruheat, a product 
that's been on the US market for 16 years and who knows how many years 
before that in England. 


Since I haven't posted in a while, a couple comments on previous 
threads: 


(1) To blow or not to blow:  I've always advised people to taste the 
brown scum on top of the kreusen head when deciding whether or not to 
use the blow-off method.  In short, I use the blow-off method!!


(2) From time to time at Cottonwood, we use dried yeast because of the 
peculiarities of our brewing system and the difficulty we have with 
harvesting yeast given our fermenters.  FWIW, Lallemand's Nottingham 
and Windsor are exceptionally good dried yeasts.


With the onset of winter, we noticed longer lag times and generally 
sluggish ferments.  Upon calling the labs, we discovered that the 
water we used to rehydrate our yeast had gotten too cold.  (We left 
our boiled rehydration water in capped bottles on a shelf in the 
brewing room which sometimes gets quite cold in the winter time.)  We 
were advised to rehydrate the yeast in 104 degree water! 


Now this went counter to my intuitions regarding how hot yeast should 
get and 104 degrees seemed awfully hot to me.  I was told that 
dehydrated yeast have a kind of "memory" for the last temperature they 
saw before going into dehydrated suspended animation and 104 degrees 
is the temperature they remember.  


When next we rehydrated, we went for 104 degrees and got a rocking 
start-off and very healthy fermentation.


I'd go so far as to say that rehydrating at 104 degrees is more 
important than using two packets of yeast given the kind of 
performance we've witnessed at Cottonwood labs!

Greetings:


        I am asking for any information on a beer that I like a lot. It's
name is Attenmunster. It comes in a brown flip-top style bottle. It is
brewed and bottled in Germany by a private brewer Franz Joseph Salier,
Marktoberdorf, Germany.


        My guess is a Munich Helles.  Why? It is light colored, with low hop
flavor and aroma and has a wonderful malt flavor.  I could drink 5 gals. of
this and still want more.  That's what I am getting at.  I would like to be
able to make something like this.  Maybee not exactly like this but close.
        
        This beer seems to be readily available, most good stores and
grocerys have it as a regular shelf item.  First chance I get I am going to
get the stocker and ask if he has any info on it.


        One thing that is very strange, I noticed some tiny dark specks in
the beer, the first time I thought it was something wrong.  I was drinking
it in a very clear small 200ml glass and I noticed the specks.  Since then I
have checked other bottles and they all have the specks.  I think it is part
of the flavoring, but what?  Anyone out there in hinterland have any info?
It would be greatly appreciated.

some infection would somehow appear.


        Then one day I was playing arround getting ready to rack, I filled
the hose and was going to connect to the racking cane and then proceed to
rack the beer from the carboy. At that moment I noticed that I could connect
the racking cane and rotate the whole thing and add more water and
completely fill the cane and hose up fully.  Then I could connect each end
of the cane to an end of the hose.


        Thats it! Now to store my hose, I fill it up with idophor, connect
the racking cane, rotate a little, fill completely, then connect both ends.
I leave the small cap off and this allows the tubing to connect at each end.
Now I have the neatest triangle loop completely filled with idophor that I
can store and good bye WORRY.

I have been reading all the messages on hot and cold break removal.
It seems as though it is more important to get the wort off the hot break
than the cold break. 


Is there any difference between the two break materials? 


I normally drain the chilled wort off the hot AND cold break. Does the hot
break go back into solution as the wort chills?
