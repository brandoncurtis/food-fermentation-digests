I think you've got it; less trub = faster clearing.

The CF chiller should only produce more cold break if you chill the wort to
a lower temperature than you did with your immersion chiller (which is often
the case when using CF chillers; who wants to wait 45 minutes or more for
their immersion chiller to do the job?). The final temperature reached is
really what counts; the rate of cooling generally isn't significant.

While this may be true, saturated FAs aren't really a big concern in the
nutrient department. Yeast can easily synthesize the required saturated FAs
and they don't need oxygen to do it. UNsaturated FAs and sterols, OTOH, must
either be provided in the medium or synthesized using free oxygen. IF the
yeast has been handled properly and at least some of the cold break is left
in the fermenter, I believe wort aeration is generally unnecessary (for
relatively low gravity beers). In fact, as you've pointed out, you really
don't want saturated FAs in the finished beer, so it's preferable to
minimize their presence in wort. This is one of the main reasons trub
removal is considered to be so important. It can decrease beer stability by
contributing to staling reactions.

Extremely rapid fermentation rates are undesirable because this leads to
excessive acetaldehyde and acid excretion and thus a depression of the wort
pH (TOO low), as well as fusel and ester formation. I suppose if one had
excess AAs and excess O2 or lipids, things could get out of hand, but a high
temperature is usually the main culprit responsible.

I agree here, but...


without it *in a wort with low soluble lipids* (very

 ...are you sure about this part? Yeast can synthesize saturated fatty acids
in an anaerobic environment, as long as energy (sugar) is available. If the
saturated FAs are available in the wort, the yeast will utilize them (just
as occurs with O2), but they generally aren't required in the medium. [Or am
I missing something here?]

First, I'm sure you HAVE heard of "beer" vinegar... but you probably saw it
labeled under the mysterious name of "malt" vinegar - they do that just to
throw you off.


Second, if you have any ability to sanitize your fermenting equipment, then
you have nothing to fear from vinegar - as well as the organism that creates
vinegar.

Well, I always recommend that you shake your hose before putting it away.  
If you want to be extra careful, you can take some tissue and dab the end 
to wick away the moisture.  Just don't let anyone else see you, it could be 
rather embarrasing.  Both methods should work nicely.  Don't forget to wash 
your hands, as sanitation is important.  If your hose is wet for several 
days, I suppose infection is possible.  Frankly, I'd be more worried about 
what people would say when they saw the wet spots.

Subject:  Attenmunster/ New fermenter




Ronald asked about Attenmunster.  I too love this beer.  The little
description my beer store has on the shelf says it is a Dortmunder
(Export) style.  Helles and Dortmunder are very close in OG and IBU with
Dortmunder ranging a little higher (1.048 to 1.056, 23-29) versus Helles
(1.044 to 1.052, 18-25).


Attenmunster has a grain taste that probably requires at least a partial
mash.  This beer is very pale, you'd probably want to go with pils or light
Vienna malt. I make a pretty decent Dortmunder (IMHO) with 7 lbs of
Alexanders and one pound of Light Munich mashed at 150 degrees for 1
hour.


I do a full volume boil to reduce caramelization and use a two oz pack of
Hallertau pellets 4.6 AA (1.25 oz boil, .75 oz end-of boil) and Wyeast
Bohemian.  Yum, yum!


This is BTW, the beer with the reddish-brown label.  Dave Miller's new
book talks about another beer from this brewery (a pilsner?) with a
green label which I've never tried.  Hope this helps and enjoy.  


*************


I recently came into possession of a 13.2 gallon keg which I wanted to
use to ferment 10 gallon batches.  The retaining ring was easy enough to
remove after a little prying with a screwdriver and the tap assembly lifted
right out.  For a number of years this keg had contained a small amount
of a substance totally incompatible with brewing, Moosehead!


I hauled the keg off to the local coin-op car wash and used US $2.50
worth of quarters and got it pretty well cleaned up inside and out (no
nasty sour beer aroma).  I then did several TSP and hot water soaks and
rinsed well.


I'm a little leery about using this though, because when I tilt the keg and
shine a light inside and have a look the remaining water drops slide
_very_ slowly down the inclined slope, more like the viscosity of oil,
rather than water.  I noticed this before all my cleaning and after.  Does
anyone know what might explain this?  Does anyone know what I'm
talking about?

Subject:      Pickle Buckets as Fermenters


  Being a dedicated plastic bucket primary guy (I too hate using blow off),
I can tell you that the main problem with pickle buckets is not the smell, it i
is the fact that they only hold five gallons, and unless you are brewing
batches smaller than this, they can cause quite a mess as a primary
fermenter.


  Speaking of this - heres a tip for all you new brewers:  before you use your
big 7+ gallon plastic primary fermenter, measure 5 gallons and mark the line
permanently (I use hot pink nail polish).  I have seen a couple new brewers
assume that the lower lip on the bucket is 5 gallons, where in reality, on mine
 it turns out to be closer to 6 gallons.

Most of the vinegar used in the food industry is distilled vinegar. White
vinegar is distilled vinegar (acetic acid) that is diluted with water to a
concentration 5%.  You can not get an infection from distilled vinegar. 


Raw apple cider vinegar is another story.  Much cider vinegar is actually
cider flavored vinegar, and as such does not have any live (dormant)
organisms.  There are health benefits associated with using cider vinegar,
but you must use raw cider vinegar.  This CAN contaminate beer.  But, as
far as contamination from pickle buckets, I don't think there is any
worry. 


As far as "Beer Vinegar," have you ever eaten at a fish 'n' chips place? 
Most often they have bottles of Malt Vinegar on the tables to sprinkle on
your fried fish.  There you have it!

A question for the collective:


Besides increased chill haze, what are the effects of temperature 
fluctuations
on homebrew?  My beer fridge is in an unheated garage and with the recent
weather bouncing between 13F and 60F my beer is cycling between a near 
freeze
and the normal 45F (minimum setting).  Thanks

Subject: Discussion of Roller Steels


Hi Group,
I guess I havent been paying close attention lately because I didnt notice this
thread until today, when Mike Cullen commented on John Parker's quote of Randy
Kay's email. Here is the original quote:


>In answer to your query, the rollers are made of steel tubing (the wall

>rust or become pitted from oxidization.


Mike is generally correct about the difference in plating hardnesses; Chrome
plating types are generally harder than Nickel platings. The caveat though is
that the coatings are very thin, around .001 - .005 inch, so the hardness of
the plating is very dependent on the hardness of the base metal. Using a
Vickers hardness indenter to measure the hardness of the coatings alone, the
hardness of Hard Chromium Plating (vis a vis Decorative Chromium Plating) is
about 1000 HV. Dec Chrome plating is very thin, .00001 inch, and has no effect
on overall hardness to speak of.


There are two main types of Nickel plating: General Purpose (Electrodeposited)
and Electroless. The hardness of GP varies depending on the type of plating
bath but varies between 100 - 600 HV. Nominally half of the Chrome value. GP
Nickel has very good corrosion resistance.


Electroless nickel is a very popular coating and can actually be heat treated
to improve its hardness, though at the expense of its corrosion resistance and
ductility. As deposited, it has a nominal hardness of 500 HV and heat treated
(400C for an hour) can have a hardness of 1200 HV. (Bear in mind though that
this temperature would cause some degree of tempering (softening) of some low
alloy carbon steels.) Coating thickness for corrosion protection are .003 -
 .005 inch. Electroless nickel coatings can be more ductile and have better
adhesion than GP Nickel. 


In conclusion, I would say Electroless Nickel plating would be the most
economical coating for knurled rollers, and would have very good corrosion and
wear resistance. Hard Chromium plating would be superior, but it would be more
expensive and overkill for the job.


Regarding knurling and nickel content of steel:
Knurling could be accomplished either of two ways: rolling or machining. The
effect of the knurling process on the properties of the steel will depend on
the steel, and there are three main classes of steel that would be used for
rollers: Plain Carbon, Low Alloy Carbon, and Stainless. The Plain Carbon type
would have only trace amounts of nickel, the Low Alloy types (ex. 4130, 4340)
contain about
zero or 1.5% depending on alloy, and the Stainless 400 series types contain
about 2% if at all, most dont have any. (The austenitic, 300 series that we
brewers love so well has 8%, but these soft steels are unsuitable for rollers.)
And, Nickel is not a steel hardener anyway, I should have stated that first.
Its function in steel is to increase corrosion resistance.


So, If the knurls are machined in using a high speed tool such that the steel
gets hot (ie. poor machining practice), then the rapid heat and cooling would
cause some degree of hardening of the surface material. But I would not like
this result as it tends to be brittle and nonuniform. Case hardening of all
these steels may be accomplished by Heat Treating with a torch or in an oven
and quenching in water. (This statement is very general, its more detailed than
this.) 
Knurling by rolling between dies would work-harden the steel to a degree and
would provide residual compressive stresses which would contribute to hardness.
But the overall hardness of the steel roller would depend on its bulk heat
treatment. 


To summarize, Chrome is harder than Nickel, Nickel is a good choice for
corrosion resistance for grain mill rollers, grain mill roller steel will not
contain appreciable amounts of nickel, and knurling via machining should not
significantly increase the case hardness of the roller because it would mean
that the machining is being done wrong. (I will revise my opinion if someone
can show me data otherwise.)

The only reasons I can think of why not are: Pouring hot wort over ice will
of course melt the ice and the water dilutes the wort; this will increase
the volume and lower the gravity but also encourage the protein (cold
break) to remain in solution and thereby give you the opposite effect of
what you were after.

True, and also the *colder* you can get the wort, the clearer the beer will be.

You mean if you poured the hot break back into the wort again? If you
separate them (wort and trub) I don't see how it could go back into
solution.

I've had no trouble using pickle buckets, either.  I used one for a
bottling bucket, the other for a zapap after soaking with bleach and
letting them sit in the sun for a week or so last summer.  The pickle smell
was still very noticeable at that time, but it's finally completely gone.
Moral:  these are great, you just have to work with them a while, and be
patient.

For those of you who are interested, I wrote a 115 page study guide for the
BJCP Exam that's now available free on the TRASH home page.  I wrote this
guide back in 1990 when I first took the BJCP exam, and I continue to use it
as a study aid when I've held pre-test study sessions for our members who
want to prepare for the Exam.


I've also included a four-page list of sample BJCP exam questions.  This
quesiton list appeared on the Net in 1994 and also in numerous homebrew club
newsletters.  I've organized them by type and included them in the same file
as the Study Guide.  Questions are a great way of studying because you can
practice handwriting answers in the same fashion as you'll be required to do
at the Exam.


Feel free to copy and distribute the Guide and the question list.  All I ask
is that the title page be included and that no money changes hands (i.e., you
can give it away but you can't sell it.)


The TRASH home page is at:  http://members.gnn.com/rcolaizzi/trash.htm

Fellow HBDers!


On Tuesday evening 2/6/96, I started brewing a Belgian strong  
ale.  I formulated the recipe using SUDS for Windows but ended up 
with a starting gravity of 1.072 at 50 degrees F., instead of 
something near the SUDS-calculated 1.095.  WHY??


I have experienced similar shortfalls before -- but not 
consistently.  A summary of both the SUDS recipe and brewing 
method follows; if anyone would be so kind as to offer some 
constructive criticism or analysis, I would really appreciate it.


- -----------------
Starting Gravity: 1.095
Ending Gravity:   1.024
Alcohol Content:  9.2%

Brewing Method Summary:
Steep specialty malts, in grain bag, in 1 gal. of 155 degree F. 
water for 1/2 hour.  Add this wort with other malts/sugars to 5.5 
gallons of additional water in a 15 gal aluminum pot.  Bring all 
to a vigorous boil for 1 hour over a 250,000 BTU propane cooker.  
Add hops as scheduled.  Add 1 tsp. Irish moss and immerse copper 
coil chiller (to sterilize) for last 10 minutes of boil.  Remove 
from heat, cover pot and force cool, reaching 45 degrees F. in 
1/2 hour.


I was able to only rack off 4 gallons of chilled wort from the 
trub and hops, and I didn't leave a lot of wasted wort in the 
brew kettle (my boil-off rate appears rather tremendous).  To 
these four gallons of wort I added 1 quart (+/-) of a 1.040 yeast 
starter and 3 quarts (+/-) of distilled water, topping everything 
off at 5 gallons with a S.G. of 1.072 `at` 50 degrees F.

Don't ya just hate the the junk that collects on the insides of your siphon

Go down to your local music store and get a cleaning brush for either a 
trumpet or trombone. The brushes are attached at each end of a 4-5 foot piece 
of stainless steel spring type material and work great. I got one for about $6.


Take a couple of your different sized tubes with you so you know what size of

I think you have gotten something wrong here. The idea is to use two rests
at 60C and 70C to control fermentability. For a less modified malt (i.e.
pilsener or lager malt) you need to use a protein rest at 50C because of
the high protein content. On the other hand, well modified malt has a much
lower protein content and you don't want the protein level to be too low,
or you would get a poor head. So George Fix idea is to do a low-temp rest
at _40C_ instead of 50C for well modified malt, keeping the transition time
from 40C to 60C under 15 mins. The gain of a low temperature rest is mainly
better gelatinization and dissolvability, resulting in higher extraction.


To repeat George Fix mash scedules:
Lager malt (low modification): 50-60-70C
Pale malt (high modification): 40-60-70C


I use the 40-60-70C scheme for my British ales. I usually dough in with a
little water in a bucket, giving a very thick mash at 40C. I then transfer
to the mash tun and use infusion to get the mash to 60C. The transition to
70C and to 77C for mash-out is then made with external heating. I think it
would be very hard to go through all the steps with infusion only,
especially if you want to minimize the time between 40C and 60C.


=46or lager malt and the 50-60-70C scheme you could use decoctions.

This reminds me of a story told as part of PBS's Cival War series that went
something like this:  General McClellen and some of his officers debated for
a long time over the depth of a river that they wished to cross.  Finally,
in disgust, Colonal George Custer rode out to the middle of the river and
said: "General McClellen Sir, THIS is how deep the river is, Sir."


The moral?  Open one and drink it.  THAT is how good it is.

From: Steve_Rosenzweig`at`wb.xerox.com (Rosenzweig,Steve)
Subject: On Ice Wort Cooling, Yeast Culture and Re-use


Mostly this post is in reponse to a couple of questions from Tracy 
 Thomason in HBD 1955/6:


On Ice Wort Cooling:  I am primarily an extract brewer with the 
 occasional specialty grains thrown in for good measure.  The method 
 that I have employed for the last 6 years is to boil an initial 3-4 
 gallons of water for 15-30 min (which sterilizes and pulls out some 
 chemicals, e.g. Chlorine) the day before I intend to brew.  After the 
 water has cooled to around room temp, transfer to your sterilized 
 primary fermenter (mine is a 6.5 gal carboy), cap and put the carboy 
 outside, in the garage,  or in the freezer (one good reason to love 
 living in the winter wonderland of upstate NY - you can easily chill 
 your water!).  BE CAREFUL not to freeze the bugger solid!  Monitor it 
 - some ice forming on the surface seems to be OK - and you know the 
 temp is around 32F, but a solid freeze would likely crack the carboy.  
 Then on brewday after your wort has been boiled (I use 1-2 gallons 
 plus 2 cans extract) you are ready to transfer to the primary.  


Safety Disclaimer ON!  The next step can be extremely dangerous, if you 
 are at all squeamish in nature, find another method (e.g. wort 
 chiller)!  Boiling hot wort on cold glass means at least a nasty crack 
 if not an outright explosion!  One time I did kill a carboy this way - 
 I used the wrong damn funnel - MAKE SURE you use a large funnel with 
 ridges along the neck to allow for air to escape from the carboy - I 
 used a cheapy and it allowed hot wort down the sides of the carboy.  
 (Note that I was able to save the beer in the cracked carboy by 
 slipping some plywood under it and having a friend help me lift it to 
 a countertop to siphon off to my trusty bucket!  Good beer from that 
 batch _and_ I learned something too!)  Safety Disclaimer OFF!


I usually put the carboy with the near-freezing water into a large 
 plastic tub, cover it with your brew towel (or better yet a big-a** 
 brew blanket), put your funnel in place - have someone hold it to 
 steady it if possible - and quickly but carefully pour the wort 
 through the funnel into the carboy.  The wort MUST NOT touch the sides 
 of the carboy - it must go directly into the center of the cold water! 
  The theory is that the cold water will absorb the thermal shock 
 rather than the glass.  For the last five years I haven't had a 
 problem with this method - and the water ratio I use seems to chill 
 the entire wort to around 70-80F immediately!  This also seems to give 
 me an excellent cold break - sometimes the wort almost looks 
 solidified!  The advantage of using the tub is that if you need to 
 further chill the wort, you can easily carry the entire setup outside 
 for a snow bath.  You then aerate your wort (I just shake the carboy 
 around in the tub), and pitch your yeast - which leads us to:


On Yeast Culture and Re-use:  I never thought to save and repitch the 
 sediment from my dry yeast batches - what was the point?  I must admit 
 that I only recently have started using liquid yeast (and I don't know 
 what took me so long!) and I am very pleased with the results!  I 
 cannot comment on yeast farming or slants (yet - wait till next 
 fall!), but I have successfully repitched the sediment from the bottom 
 of the secondary of a Wyeast Lager strain several times.  One thing 
 that I have noticed on yeast starters is that when you use the smack 
 pack to pitch into the starter, it does take a good 18 hours or so to 
 get to high krausen, but when I pitched the secondary sediment into a 
 starter, it was less than 4 hours (I was caught off guard - not ready 
 to brew - and had to pitch after high krausen - but everything worked 
 out alright).  I usually reuse only from the secondary since it seems 
 cleaner (whiter), there is much less trub, and the neck of my primary 
 is always covered in HopSpooge(tm) from the pellets I use that I don't 
 particulary want in my starter!  After I bottle or keg the brew, I use 
 some cool sanitized water (1-2 cups) to slosh around the yeast slurry 
 on the bottom of the carboy.  I boil up 1.5 cups DME in 2 cups water 
 and add to some chilled pre-boiled water in a glass gallon jug for 
 wort of around 1.040 - 1.050.  When the baby wort is at around 70-80F, 
 I reslosh the slurry (say that 5x fast!), and pitch.  Note that you 
 will probably need an odd size stopper and another spare airlock for 
 this baby brew.  The half gallon or so that results can be pitched to 
 5 gallons around high krausen with fair assurance that there are 
 plenty of little beasties rejoicing at the prospect of more food!  You 
 could split the starter to a couple of airlocked bottles as well, 
 saving them after fermentation for weeks/months in the fridge, but you 
 should repitch to a larger starter size before you pitch to a full 5 
 gallon batch.


I highly recommend getting The Homebrewers Companion as well - it is 
 truly a good companion work to TNCJOHB!


Hope that answered some questions for Tracy and any other relative 
 beginners out there!  Any questions on specifics will be gladly 
 answered either through HBD or email.


Sorry for the length, but I have been lurking for quite awhile and 
 obviously was ready to contribute!
