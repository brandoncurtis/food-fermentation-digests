Subject: good gott!


terrence asks about all-grain setups using gott coolers. i have
done three or four batches is my gott system, and i love it.


there is a perforated pizza pan on the market (walmart, kmart,
etc) that fits perfectly in the gott. i simply drilled four holes
around the perimeter and used stainless steel carriage bolts for
legs to stand the pan just above the spigot. the drawback to
this design is that it leaves about 1 gal dead space below the 
pan.


i place another perforated pizza pan on top of the grain bed
with a sainless steel eye bolts through the center. this helps
distribute the hot liquor during sparging.


i use 2 10-gallon gotts. one is the mash/lauter tun, and the
other is the hot liquor tun. in each i replace the spigot with a
fass-frisch reusable bung. the bung is made for the mini-keg
systems. it fits in the spigott hole perfectly. then use 5/8
inch (as i recall) thick-wall tubing through the bung, and use
tubing clamps (lab supply) to throttle the flow from each tun.
you get the hang of balancing these flows after a couple of
tries.


i doubt that you could mash graini for a 10-gal batch in a
5-gal tun. the larger tun also gives you the flexibility to make
big beers.


i must admit that i still have a problem with low efficiency.
perhaps this design has something to do with it. i have gotten
about 25 pt-gal/lb, and understand that 30 would be more like
it. i'm open for suggestions myself on how i might improve
this. as for the system, though, it is easy to use and easy to
clean up.

Subject: Floating in my beer (mold?)


Hi all,


I've had a superb porter sitting in my secondary (glass carboy) for about
2 1/2 weeks.  About a week a go, I noticed some small white things
clinging to the glass at just above the beer level.  I couldn't decide if
they were mold or liquified yeast particles, so I did nothing and waited. 
Now I have white clusters of bubbles floating on the top of the beer.  
They other day I also saw some bubbles in a definitive line.


Is this mold?  If not, is it some other kind of infection?  I was thinking
about tossing it, but haven't been able to bring myself to do it.  Could
it be drinkable.  If it is mold, will it provide full gastric distress?


Any advice would be most helpful -- I can't figure out what to do.

Subject: Re:boilers and heat conduction


Hello blokes and blokettes - in this neck of the world, everything 
related to brewing paraphanelia seems to cost a lot more than the 
States. I am looking to buy a 40 litre SS boiler, and have seen two 
types. One is made of thin SS all round, and runs $160. The other has an 
aluminium "sandwich" on the base, and costs $280 (!!!). So, in terms of 
heat transfer etc, is it worth the expense to get the better quality 
boiler? Thanks

In HBD 1958, Brad Fabbri wrote:

Me too!  I use it everywhere.


But I note that large diameter, thin wall silicone tube can flatten or 
kink. Silicone elastomer is pretty soft.  Use gentle hose clamping
techniques (I avoid the steel band type of hose clamp as they tear the tube's
surface).


AND silicone tubing is very permeable to oxygen.  If you are extremely 
paranoid about Hot Side Aeration, you might want to avoid it.


> and inert to any cleaner a homebrewer is likely to use.


True. It is attacked by concentrated, strong bases (alkalies) especially
at high temperatures, so if you're sanitizing with NaOH, (Sodium
hydroxide, lye, drano) I would also avoid it.  Also keep it out of flames,
solvents & acids.  _Prolonged_ exposure to dilute bleach can cause
discoloration & opacity.

e.g. Cole Parmer 5/16" ID 1/2" OD $53 for 25ft list price 1-800 323 4344
    Item no H-06411-76 max pressure 16psi. (This type is peroxide cured, 
    platinum cured costs more, few advantages to us).


or VWR Scientific same size, Dow Corning(R) Silastic(R) brand, 50ft = $114.20
   1-800 932 5000 Cat. No 62999-552


Many other sizes, brands, lengths available, all expensive.
Reinforced silicone tube is also available. ($15.50/ft!)


To avoid the oxygen permeability problem, you could use Pharmed(R) tubing.
This is also a pharmaceutical grade tube, good to 275F.  It's harder to clean
than silicone because it's opaque (silicone is translucent so you can see 
lumps stuck inside).  It's a good bit stiffer and harder, so thinner wall 
stuff might work.  You can heat-seal, -bond and -form it, but as it's 
pretty flexible, it's easy to use (cf vinyl tube).


e.g. Cole Parmer Item no H-06484-14 5/16" ID, 7/16" OD, 25 ft = $67.05
     VWR Same thing costs $73.25 (Item no 63007-336).
PharMed is made by Norton Performance Plastics if anyone wants to track them 
down.  


Final option is Norprene (R) Food Grade, Cole Parmer 3/8"x5/8" 126.10/50ft.
Opaque beige, good to 275F, good chemical resistance, item number H-95710-60
(VWR don't have it).  Norprene is also from Norton, I believe.  Regular 
Norprene is black and non-food grade.  Norprene and PharMed are available in 
other sizes too.


I have no connection with the above except as a customer etc etc.
You could also try Baxter/Scientific Products at 1-800 234 5227 if they 
still exist.

Subject: Am I Stuck?


I'm working on my second batch and think that I may have run into a 
problem.  I'm brewing an Ale based on the Munton & Fison Old Ale kit, 
with a few minor adjustments:


1 can M&F Old Ale Kit
1 can Bierkeller Amber Unhopped Extract
1/2 oz. Cascase Pellets (aroma)
1 pkg. M&F Dry Ale Yeast


O.G. 1.051


I racked to secondary after the Krausen subsided, and floated my 
hydrometer in the carboy I use for a secondary.  The reading at racking a 
week ago was 1.018.


Tonight's reading 1.018.  


My question is, is this batch ready for the bottle?  Do I need to rouse 
the yeasties or perhaps re-pitch?  I have extra yeast just in case of 
emergencies.


Thanks in Advance!
Dave

     The CARBOY (Cary-Apex-Raleigh Brewers Of Yore) will hold their first 
homebrew competition in Raleigh NC on March 16th. The Shamrock Open will 
use a sliding scale for entries-$6 for 1st, $5 for 2nd, $4 for 3rd, $3 
for 4th, $2 for 5th, and the sixth ones on us(no charge).
     Judges interested in assisting should email Bill MacKenzie at 
dedpetvet`at`aol.com. Folks wanting an entry form or more information, please 
email me at lmatt`at`nando.net 
     If you are in the Raleigh-Cary area and interested in joining a 
homebrew club, please contact me and I'll send out the last couple 
 of the CARBOY Fermenter newsletters for you to review. 
     Homebrew competitions are a great way for brewers of all skills to 
have their beers evaluated by 2 or more judges and possibly discover some 
area of brewing to improve or learn what you're doing right so you don't 
change it.

Subject: Bulkhead fittings & all grain mashing


1.  I did my first all grain the other day and (as predicted) had some problems 
and thoughts for improvemants which I wanted to bounce off the group.


  I had a difficult time bringing the mash up to 151 degrees (settled for 149 
deg). I used a cooler and carefully doughed the grains and water together, but 
the heat loss was quicker than expected (I started with 170 degree water). I 
noticed this too when sparging ( I used a phils lautern tun).  The mechanics of 
the sparging went well -- good clear wort....no stuck mash, etc ---but temp 
delta was a problem again.  I heated the water up to 170 degrees, transfered it 
to the sparging bucket, then gravity fed it to the rotating sparging arm 
etc....as expected the heat losses were large.


        Since my brewing budget is small, my thought on solving the problem is 
to take my stock pot (thin stainless), punch a hole in the bottom...use a 
bulkhead fitting and mount a nipple on it...connect a hose directly to the 
sparging arm.  That way i could maintain sparging temp at the stove.


         Appreciate any recommmendations or better ideas!




        Thanks,

From: Kirk R Fleming <flemingk`at`usa.net>
Subject: Stock Pot Secondary, Suds 4.0


In #1958 Bob Rogers asked about the use of silicone to seal his stock
pot secondary.  I see two ways to do this.  One is to actually apply
silicone sealant to the stock pot lid--I've done this before to seal
glass to stainless, and I strongly recommend against it.  The silicone
is nearly impossible to get off either surface completely (although
I'm sure you might find a solvent if you looked hard enough).


The second method would be to very carefully lay a fillet of silicone
onto the rin of the stock pot lid, so as to leave a smooth silicone
surface that, when hardened, would contact the rim of the stock pot
at about a 45 deg angle.  A weight could then be used to hold the lid
down tightly to the stock pot.


General Electric makes a "General Household Sealant" that is 100% clear
silcone, and which meets FDA Reg CFR 177-2600 required for use in food
contact surfaces.  It's odor and taste-free as near as I can tell, but
it doesn't matter much--I can't see why it would ever contact the beer.


Finally, for folks wanting to use ss stock pots or any other hard to
seal container for secondary ferment, my *real* recommendation is to not
worry about sealing them either!  I put mine inside my freezer chest (for
lagers), or inside a clean 72 quart picnic cooler with the lid down.  You
can simply put the pot lid on, wind a strip of cling-wrap around the
lid-pot interface, and put the whole pot in the cooler chest.  If you
rack to the secondary a little early when there's still considerable
evolution of gas--you're good to go.


Tom Wenck asks about a possible Suds 4.0 bug having to do with color
computation.  Suds 4.0 appears to have several bugs, but even if it
computed color improperly I wouldn't call that a bug--just a less-than
perfect algorithm.  But...I *don't* find it intuitive that there would
be any significant connection between extraction efficiency and color.
Dark grains, in my experience, will contribute about the same color to
the wort no matter how they're treated.  IOW, soaking them in warm water,
mashing them, boiling them, whatever...their color contribution is about
the same (undetectably influenced by the process).

Subject: Gott Mashing Questions


Terence asks about mashing in gott coolers...

>1.  If I go with the 5 gal cooler, would I be able to fit all the

A 5 gallon gott will hold between 10-12lbs of grain, this amount would 
not be suitable for most 10gal batches unless you are only brewing low 
gravity beers.


>2.  If I go with the 10 gal cooler, will the grain bed be to shallow

>    filtration of a 5 gal batch ?


Ideal grain bed depth is around six inches.  The 10 gal Gott is wider 
than the 5 gal unit (13" compared to 11.5") so it will provide a 
shallower grain depth with identical grain volumes.  With that said, I 
have mashed in both coolers of various sizes and have not found great 
differences in extraction efficiency.


>3.  Is there a Phil's Phalse Bottom to fit the 10 gal cooler as well
>    as the 5 gal cooler ?


Yes.


>4.  Is it easy and non cooler destructive to put a suitable spigot
>    that can control my runoff flow in place of the standard spigot ?


Yes, here is the way I set up my cooler for about $10 in parts.  
Unscrew the gott spigot and remove the rubber grommet that surrounds 
the hole.  The hole diameter is 5/8".  Go to a hardware store and buy a 
1/2" closed brass nipple fitting that is about 2" long (this looks like 
a threaded pipe).  Also get a couple of 1/2" brass nuts, 2 food grade 
rubber/nylon washers and a threaded brass ball valve.  Insert the 
nipple fitting through the hole, put the washers on, screw on the nuts 
to make a tight seal and attach your ball valve on the outside.

Subject: Two tips, two questions


Greetings, fellow brewmen (and women)!


First tip:      For those of us who do not have an external hose on our
                sinks, buy a 3 ft. length of 3/8" ID (1/2" OD) tubing and
                simply force it over the end of a jet carboy washer. Since
                it's a tight fit, the pin valve (or whatever it's called)
                is forced to stay open, and you can use this to fill 
                carboys, sanitation buckets, etc. Works great! Word of 
                Warning!! DO NOT attempt this with hot water!! The heat will
                loosen the plastic tubing,it will slip off and a very
                quick burst of scalding hot water will blast you between the
eyes (I will continue to deny this happened to me until any
witnesses come forward).
Second tip:     Having trouble cleaning your stove after brewing? Try Windex.
                One day I ran out of regular cleaner and tried Windex and
                it worked twice as well as anything else I've used,although
                you still need to add elbow grease.
First question: Am I the only person who heats the brewpot to go from a
protein rest to a saccharification rest? I never found it
worthwhile to add boiling water since it meant yet another
kettle, it thinned the mash considerably and it took forever  
                to recirculate. So I just add heat and stir, being careful not
                to scorch the bottom grains. It takes about 15 min. to go from
                122F to 152F. There is conflicting data on this matter (gee,
                what a suprise). Papazian: "Applying heat directly to the mash
                is usually avoided due to the time it takes to get from one
                temperature to the other. It is desirable to reach diastatic
                conversion from the previous stage as quickly as possible."
                Noonan: "After 30 minutes, apply heat to the mash tub to raise
                the temp to 122F. Heat to saccharification temp, following the
                decoction-mash time sequence (he's describing his method for
                step-infusion mashing). I've been brewing everything from 
                light pilsners to oatmeal stouts using this method, and have
                won a few awards in the process, so I can't be screwing up 
                too bad. I just can't imagine doing that much damage to the 
                malt or its enzymes by direct heating, especially since that
                is exactly how decoction mashing is done. Comments?
Second question: Does anybody know of a source for wholesale supply of koji?
                My local homebrew shop is interested. Any replies will be 
                forwarded. See Ya!!

Subject: Mashing Methods with a Gott Cooler?


Hi,


I was recently given a 10 gallon Gott cooler as a gift.  I plan to set it up
using a 12" Phil's Phalse Bottom as my mash/lauter tun.  In the past I have
done my all grain brewing using the "monitored brewpot" method of stovetop
mashing as it is described by Papazian in his two books.  I typically do a two
or three step infusion mash.


I would be interested to know what techniques/methods the "Gott mashers" out
there are using to do multi-step infusion mashing.   How is the mash "heated"
between the steps?


If you are doing specific heat type calculations to determine the amount of hot
water needed to reach the different step temperatures, how is the cooler itself 
included in these calculations?


TIA for you help.  Private e-mail is fine if you don't think that it is of
interest to the collective.

Subject: Belgian brown ale recipe?


   Does anyone have a grain/partial mash/extract recipe that could closely
duplicate Corsendonk Monk's Brown Ale? I've read closely the Belgian book
from the classic beer styles, but I can't find a description that is
similar. With such a variety both within styles and between styles I would
appreciate anyone's help in this matter.


   TIA,

Subject: Chocolate Amber Recipe




     Has anyone had Saranac's Chocolate Amber?  It's an extremely tasty sea-
sonal brew put out by Saranac around springtime and has recently begun to
reappear at the local stores.  Obviously, it derives most of its character
from chocolate malt, but I was wondering if anyone had come up with a decent
extract recipe to clone this beer.  I've been brewing for about a year now,
7-8 extract batches, mead and hard cider, and am partial to the more full-
bodied beers, usually stouts and porters.  I would love to come up with an
equivalent.  Any takers?


Jay Rustine


P.S.  I'll attempt to convert any all-grain recipes
      if that's all anyone can come up with.

Subject: Clear Wit Bier


I asked this a few weeks ago and never got any replies so I'll
try again.


I made a white beer that was enetered in competition and all judging
sheets commented that it was too clear for the style - wasn't
cloudy enough.  When it's first chilled, it's nice and cloudy.
After several days chilled, it clears.  If I remember ,the haze is
due to the protiens from the unmalted wheat.  Can anything be done to
keep the beer cloudy when chilled for extended lengths of time?

Greetings;                                                                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
Well, I finally went and did it, I challenged mama nature                       
to a duel of wits, and lost, miserably!   I made the mistake                    
of leaving a corny-keg full of iodophor solution in my garage                   
just waiting to keg a batch of Negra Medelo clone, and little                   
did I realize that when the outside temp dipped down to 8                       
below last week what effect this would have, the lid was pushed                 
straight up through the opening, splitting the keg opening                      
about 4 inches and destroying the lid.   OK everyone say                        
together....................DOH!.............................                   
                                                                                
Now, aside from the obvious spare parts I have (fittings) any                   
suggestions on what to do with the corny cylinder?  I remember                  
that alternative beverage sells a 9.25" (or something like that)                
dia ss. perf disk for making a corny keg a lauter tun, this could               
work on 5 gallon batches where my 1/2bbl system would make for                  
an awfully shallow grain bed, but other than that, maybe a nice                 
planter?  Obviously this would necessitate cutting the lid off.                 
                                                                                
The compuserve forum has had a thread going on worst brewing

Although, one of my retailers tells the story of a guy who

(carboy) on his dresser, I'm still trying to figure that one out,               
and when his blowoff hose clogged (obviously not a 1.25" dia hose)              
the carboy exploded and soaked all his clothes and sprayed wort

Subject: All purpose malt




        I understand that British malts are more modified than 
continental malts and mashing schedules (rests) for the less modified
British malts are different.  Also, with less? enzymes, the power to
 convert adjuncts is less for British malts?


        In my enthusiam for my winter brewing schedule I bot 50# of
 British malt and find myself needing to use it for both ales and lagers.
 What would be the preferred mashing schedule for using British malts on
 lagers, or more specifically, how should the mashing schedule change if 
at all?


        One lager I make is pre-prohibitation Budweiser, not like the 
current product.  This uses rice.  Will the British malt convert the 20% 
or so rice bill?


        In general, if one has to choose one malt for both ales and 
lagers, which is preferred......British or continental?

First, I want to thank people for their responses to my earlier posting, 
ie. the tan globules dancing in my fermenter were in fact flocculated 
yeast, and it seems to be particularly prevalent in this strain. By the 
way, I just had my first bottle, excellent!
That brings me to my next question. It was a Bitters (extract) that I was 
making, and I used Cascade hops for the first time. I have read that 
Cascade has a distinct citrus aroma, and they weren't kidding!!! The beer 
has a nice hop aroma and flavor with good bittering, but I wonder if this 
very distinctive (but pleasing) quality should be avoided if I'm trying 
to make an authentic Bitters?

Hi, fellow brewers, I have a question about making a yeast starter. Is there 
some reason why making a starter with corn sugar is not advised. I would like 
to make a cleaner starter and it seems like corn sugar would not leave all the

Last week Chris asked (ccooper`at`a2607.cc.msr.hp.com):
>I would be interestd in collecting and compiling feedback from the
>collective concerning your experiences with these new strains and any
>addittional info.  (I.E. comercial origins, temperature tollerance, etc.) 


  
My reply bounced so I will post.  Some of this info was in a previous post.


I've used Wyeast #1272, American Ale, for four batches to date.   Don't
know how much info you want so I'll give a brief summary of each.  All
beers have a clean background flavor.  If there is any fruitiness it is not


very strong.  Wyeast notes that this strain is more fruity than #1056.  I'm


planning to do a split IPA batch soon and compare directly to 1056 
American Ale.  Beers below fermented in glass, no secondary used 
(thanks to the collective for that recommendation!).


Batch 1 - All grain cream ale, SG 1.044, FG 1.012.  Fermented 8 days at
66-69 F.   Very clean flavor with a slight fruitiness.  Used a one pint
starter. 


Batch 2 - similar to #1 with 1 lb Gambrinus Honey malt.  Pitched on the
dregs of Batch 1 yeast cake.   SG 1.044, FG 1.010.   Fermented 70-72 first
3 days, then 65-68 for 5 days.  A much faster ferment than #1 due to more
yeast.  Most activity done in 3 days.   Clean background flavor.


Batch 3 -  Alt, "Munich" extract with 2 lb specialty grains.  SG 1.051, FG
1.014.  Fermented 68F for 4 days, then 64-68 F for 4 more days.   One pint
starter.  Higher FG presumable due to more unfermentables in wort.


Batch 4 - Oatmeal Stout with 1 lb Munich malt, all grain.  OG 1.051, FG
1.016.   Pitched on the dregs of Batch 3.  Fermented 3 days at 65 F,
activity pretty much over.  Final 5 days at 68-72 F.  Note this also has
more unfermentables (1 lb roast barley, Munich malt, 3/4 lb crystal malt)
than #1 or #2, so FG anticipated to be higher.  Tasted great at bottling
last night. 


Yeast attenuates well, flocculates well (but doesn't appear to need
"rousing"), finishes in a decent amount of time (note my ferment
temperatures are not high), and so far has made good beer.


I'll post additional info if I do the split IPA batch.

I have done this and it works great!  I only use the leg portion of the
stocking -
One leg for boiling hops, half a leg for flavor hops, and half a leg for
finishing
hops, so one pair works great for one batch.  The fine weave of the stockings
keeps the hop pellets contained very well.  As far as sanitizing goes, the
boiling wort will santize the nylon, just make sure the stockings are clean.
You may want manually rinse the stocking really well first to make sure all
of the laundry detergent is rinsed out.  You will probably get a slightly lower
hop utilization using stockings, but I have not done research to determine
just how much more hops to use, I don't worry about it the beer being a little
less bitter because I like my beer a little less bitter.  I you want to try to
compensate, I would suggest starting by adding an additional 10% hops.

Hell no.  A 5 gal. cooler is a bit too small for doing some of the "larger"
5 gallon styles.  You can get by with it if you're doing 5 gallon batches,
but I have one and I'm switching to a 10 gal cooler - to use with 5 gallon
batches.

Use a fitting for a Fass-Frisch mini-keg in place of the regular fitting.
The regular fitting comes unscrewed and can be removed without damaging
anything.

Subject: Beer Bottle Labels


To: INTERNET:homebrew`at`hpfcmgw.fc.hp.com
 
Remembering the hassle with bottles, I went directly to kegs when I recently 
got back into brewing.  I never thought I would fill another beer bottle.  
But never is a long time and I have ended up buying a counter-pressure filler 
and filling a few bottles for transport & archive.
 
I like to put labels on my beer bottles.  I have printed some nice ones on 
paper from the local homebrew shop which has a water activated rear adhesive 
(like old postage stamps).  Although they soak off easily, I can't get them 
applied smoothly without bubble ridges.  
 
I am able to smoothly apply regular paper with water soluble carpenter's 
glue.  And although the labels also soak off easily, the glue is messy 
and the labels are harder to work with.
 
In either case a coating of Krylon 'Crystal Clear' plastic spray only partly
protects the water soluble inks of my color ink jet printer.  Also the 
plastic spray slightly darken the labels.
 
Is there a better way?  If possible, I would like to continue using my color 
ink jet printer.  At reasonable prices, are there better and easier-to-use 
adhesive methods, papers and coatings (maybe glossy) available?

Okay, maybe I'm worrying too much and should just relax and have a homebrew,    
but I'm hoping you all could help.  Here's the scoop.  I just transfered my     
scottish export ale into the secondary last night and took the gravity reading. 
(OG = 1.050, now SG = 1.017)  After taking the reading, I tasted it.  It tasted 
a bit too bitter for a scottish ale.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how   
this ale could be improved?  Can I add something to the secondary or at         
bottling to bring the sweetness up to balance the bitterness?  I'll include the 
recipe and I would appreciate any feedback on it.  I received this recipe from  
one of you (can't remember the name right now) and the only thing I changed was 
to eliminate the peat smoked malt (not available at the time I was brewing) and 
changed the yeast to Wyeast Scottish Ale.

I would think the best way to know for sure is to take some spent hops or
grain, put it in the nylon material, and boil it in an old pot for an hour
or so.  Just a couple of things to remember:


1) Yes, make sure to properly clean the nylons.  You don't want a judge to
write:  "Tastes slightly infected... Athelete's Foot??"


2) Make ABSOLUTELY SURE to get the seams straight!!!


3) You probably don't want your wife to read the post where you say she has
'fairly clean' feet...


Good Luck.

Subject: RE:Critique my Technique\Austin Club\


In HBD #1958 Peter Naus asked for suggestions to _easily_ improve his  brewing 
technique...


First, he says:
I pour the hot wort (CAREFULLY) through a sanitized strainer into a sanitized 
5gal carboy with 3 gal cold (not boiled) tap water.


Suggestion - Look in HBD #1957 at the procedure by Steve Rosenzweig for using 
boiled, chilled water. I am not advocating ever pouring hot wort into a glass 
carboy, but if you are comfortable doing it that way, then at least pre-boil 
the cooling/diluting water to remove chlorine and partially sterilize it. Have 
the water as cold as possible to reduce the hot wort temperature quickly so 
that you can pitch the yeast as soon as possible. Maybe, instead of using the 
glass carboy, try the plastic bucket methods (open or closed fermentation) to 
reduce the risk of accidentally creating the carboy grenade. This would also 
give you the ability to use the carboy you use now for a secondary.


Then he says:
When wort is cooled, a pre-swelled liquid yeast pack is dumped in...


Suggestion - try dumping that swelled yeast pack into 1 qt. of sterilized 
starter a couple of days in advance and dump the starter into your cooled 
wort. This will reduce the lag time of the yeast from a couple of days (which 
you probably have now) to a few hours. Also, try aerating the cooled wort. It 
is pretty easy to do by just shaking the carboy filled with cool wort. Be 
_really_ careful not to drop it or you'll have another carboy grenade.


Both of these suggestions are mainly aimed at getting the right amount of 
yeast off to a good start with little competition from undesirable organisms. 
As side effects/benefits, among others, you should get shorter fermentations 
(by up to a week), slightly higher attenuation, lower fusel oil production and 
less chill haze by getting the finished beer off the trub/spent yeast sooner.


Good Luck!

Subject: Wyeast distributors/suppliers


I am a newish homebrewer transplanted here in the UK and to my dismay my
local homebrew shop does not believe liquid yeast exists any more!!  I told
her of Wyeast but she simply gave me a dull look.  I could drive 50 miles
to get it, but would prefer if it was available closer - on to the
question.  Does anyone know of the UK distibutor/supplier of Wyeast?  Can
yeast be imported with impunity?  (Maybe the quarantine it - the British
ARE a bit rabid about rabies.... ;-)


Thanks,
