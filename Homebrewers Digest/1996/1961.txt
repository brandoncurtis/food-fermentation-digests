Subject: Mash Acidification `at` 40 C


Hello All,


Mash acidification is an additional benefit of the 40 C rest.  I quote from 
George Fix's book "Principles of Brewing Science", p. 106:


"Some of the phosphatase enzymes (mainly phytase and nuclease) survive the 
kiln.  Their presence can be exploited to reduce the mash pH via the 
phosphate-calcium reactions cited in IA.  The best temperature range for this 
is 35 to 45 degrees C; these enzymes are inactivated above 55 degrees C."


I find this rest practically essential for producing a smooth pale ale, given 
my slightly alkaline brewing water---and the acidification is natural rather 
than induced by chemical additions which can alter flavor.  Please feel free 
to disagree (I'm sure someone will!).  ;-) 


Tim

Well, Belgium actually, for 10 days in March.  We've got some ideas and

Subject: The Big "Same Thing Only Different" Ale Experiment


Well, the results of the "same thing only different" experiment are in and
the results are fairly interesting.  The idea of this experiment was for me
and a fellow brewer to make the exact same recipe, but each of us using our
own techniques, to see if there would be any perceptible differences.  It was
a fairly generic pale ale which was light enough to allow potential flavor
differences through, hopped just enough to allow hop utilization & flavor
differences to be similarly noted.


Here is the recipe:


6 lb bulk light DME
1 lb light Munich
1/2 lb 40L crystal
2 oz Sam Adams Hallertauer Mittelfruh Hops (1 hour)
1 oz Sam Adams (30 min)
1/4 oz Fuggles (10 min)
1/4 oz Perle (10 min)
Irish Moss (10 min)
Wyeast British


Ingredients were purchased at the same time from the same store.  Hops were
split from the same pile.  Grain was milled, blended well, and split down the
middle.  The yeast had the exact same packaging date on it and was less than 
a month old.


Here are the notable differences in technique:

And here are the noted differences in the reuslting brew in a blind A/B test
by four 
other Club members (Gerry's and my conclusions were in line with these as
well):


Characteristic          Ken                     Gerry
==============          ===                     =====
Color                   Darker                  Lighter
Clarity (serving temp)  Clear                   Sl. hazy
Aroma                                           Sl. "fruitier" or
                                                "sweeter"
Conditioning/Head Ret   Same                    Same
Malt Flavor                                     Same or sl. sweeter
Hop Character           More hop character;     Less hop but
                        lingering bitterness    "smoother"


The color difference was attributed to increased caramelization in my brew
due to the smaller boil volume.  Clarity might be due in part to use of
powdered Irish Moss; I've used it in several batches lately and my beers are
much clearer than when I used flakes.  Slightly sweeter aroma and flavor is
expected from the FG; perhaps Gerry's lower fermentation temperature resulted
in incomplete fermentation, or the somewhat longer steep time may have
improved extraction from the specialty grains.  Use of a starter and
difference in aeration technique didn't seem to make a perceptible difference
in how "clean" the flavor was; aeration *could* be a factor in Gerry's higher
FG.


The main difference noted was in the hop character.  Mine had "more" hop
character yet my boil gravity was higher, which should have *reduced*
utilization to some degree.  Comments were along the lines of a "lingering
bitterness" and somewhat harsher hop character than Gerry's "smoother" but
"less-hoppy" brew.  So we're focusing on water chemistry.  I suppose my
filter removes chlorine and some sediment but leaves most of the ion content
intact; Gerry is likely getting lower bicarbonate levels with
boiling/decanting and later dilution with RO water. The stronger hop
character in my beer is possibly the result of higher levels of some ion or
ions which accentuate or harshen hop character, such as the bicarbonates.
 This may also explain some of the color difference (?). The somewhat
smoother character and sweeter aroma/flavor in Gerry's beer might also spring
from water chemistry as well.  We live near each other and we're (failrly)
certain that our tap water comes from the same well.  Our water is fairly
hard and alkaline here in El Paso, so this may be a bigger factor than we
have paid attention to before.


Our club has a pale-ale competition in July; we intend to enter these mostly
to see what if any score and comment differences are given (the beer was
tasty but unremarkable).


If anyone has any comments on this experiment or my interpretation of the
results, feel free to post and/or E-mail to KennyEddy`at`aol.com.

PS:


BTW this brings me to a question about "building" brewing water.  I have read
much of the general literature available about water treatment (Miller,
Pappazian, Draper, etc), and while I follow the general discussion, I just
plain get lost in the details of the chemistry.  Draper's papers (I'm a poet
and don't know it) seem to be very thorough but again I'm just a bit dizzy
after looking at it.  Can anybody offer some simple lazy-layman's "recipe"
for a couple major classes of brewing water, built on distilled water, using
*commonly available* salts/acids/other-stuffs and easy to make without
special equipment?  I know part of the answer is "you can't fool Mother
Nature", but somewhere in artificial-water-land between distilled water and
El Paso Tap must be a reasonable compromise that's better than either.
 Public humiliation or private flames welcome.  Thanks in Advance.

In HBD 1959 fredriks`at`abel.math.umu.se quotes at length
regarding Dr. Fix's 40-60-70 mash schedule and malt conversion.


"...a protein rest should be used with the Pils malts, 
provided that the total time spent under 40C (140F)..."


40 Degrees Celcius equals 104 Degrees Fahrenheit, not 140F.


60 Degrees Celcius equals 140 Degrees Fahrenheit.


A subtle distinction.

     Maybe this has been answered before, but I didn't see it.
     
     I use a balance scale to weigh out hops. 
     Most recipes call for (fractional) ounces.
     I can only find balance scale (brass) weights in grams. 
     I don't enjoy units conversions and lookup tables.
     
     Does anyone make balance scale (brass) weights in, say, quarter ounce 
     increments?  If so, who and how to order?

Subject: Suds Calculations


Thanks to all those who replied to my query (in HBD 1957) as to 
why Suds 4.0 for Windows produces estimated starting gravities 
that are often much higher than those I obtain.


Most individuals pointed to a problem with Suds incorporating 
specialty grains as part of the regular grain bill, which in my 
case often consists primarily of liquid and dry extracts, as well 
as cane sugar.  In fact, because specialty grains contribute 
little in the way of fermentables to the wort, they ought not to 
be included on an equal footing with the regular grain bill 
components when computing total points to gravity.  My problems 
seemed to stem from using 1-2 pounds of specialty grains in a 5 
gallon recipe, and having Suds include these grains when 
computing estimated S.G.


As a preliminary test of this hypothesis, I have gone back and 
used Suds to recalculate, omitting the specialty grains, the S.G. 
of my brewing efforts where I initially had experienced a S.G. 
shortfall.  In each of the six cases, the recalculated estimated 
S.G. was within .005 of my obtained value.


I next plan on going into the "Malt Maintenance" section of Suds 
and resetting the S.G. contributions of the selectable specialty 
grains to 0, while maintaining their respective color 
contributions.


I have found Suds for Windows to be a very valuable 
record-keeping tool for my brewing efforts. I hope that this 
small fixable problem doesn't deter others from considering its 
use.


By the way, my intended Belgian Strong Ale turned out to be a 
nice Double, and is now in secondary.  I added an additional 1 
lb. of light DME, dissolved and aerated in 1 quart of canned 
starter, to the main wort just before high kreusen.


Cheers,

I know what you mean.  I paid $60 for a severe compromise, an alunimum pot
Now looking back i wish i had just stuck with the idea of
using cut open kegs.  Last month i purchased 2 SS kegs from a local
homebrew shop for $40 each.  It took me about 30m each to cut them open
and install a drain.  This is the best deal going.  The edge finish
is not quite as good as a Voaporaph(sp) ss pot but it's about $200 less.
I can live with that.  Now all i have to do is find some lids that fit.

Subject: Mash pH


I am very fortunate in that the local municipal water supply is very soft
(less than 10 ppm).  However, the pH is 6.33.  Not terribly high but I would
like to adjust it to the optimum mash pH levels.  As I understand it the
mash pH varies from the water pH due to the grains present.  Is there any
way of telling by how much it varies?  As far as adjusting I can use gypsum
but there are times that I want to maintain the soft water profile.  Does
anyone know how I would adjust the pH using lactic acid?  Also, are there
any numbers regarding how an acid rest affects the pH of the mash?


Thanks,

     There has been talk lately, and in the past, about using food-
grade silicone for various jobs.  I went on a search for this and had a hell 


of a time finding silicone that said it was 'food-grade'.  I ended up 
phoning
 the Tremco Co. head office and asking them.  They said that their
'Sectrem 2' caulk was good for contact with food.  It has passed all
the Canadian government approvals.  Unfortunately, it doesn't mention
food-grade on it anywhere or even on the fact sheet that you can get
for it. It is made as a construction sealant.   It even says 'Toxic' on the
label, as do all silicone caulks but this only refers to when it is uncured.
They sent me documentation to prove their claim.  I used this product
and it is of excellent quality.
     I just thought I'd post this because I had a lot of trouble finding
food-grade.  The head office for Tremco in Canada is in Toronto, and
in the USA it's in Cleveland.

Subject:  Re: Using dishwasher for bottling table






In HBD 1959, Michael Lausin commented on Ben (? sorry) suggestion to use a
dishwasher door for bottling.  He said:


"Neat idea, I'm definitly gonna give it a try next time I bottle. I'd suggest
adding some kind of support under the door though."


In my experience this is not necessary if you do the following.  Clean out
the system first with a cycle with nothing in there, and ensure that
filters are clean, no cleaner for sparkling glasses etc. Hot wash/rinse the
bottles in the washer, using some bleach in the base of the washer.  When
the rinsing and drying is finished, wait until the bottles are cool enough
not to crack when the cold beer is poured in.  Place the bottling bucket
above the dishwasher with the capper in a convenient place on the kitchen
top.


Take the first bottle from the dishwasher and fill on the door.  Turn off
the tap on the siphon, or on the bucket. Leave the bottle to drain on the
door if overfilled.  Fill second bottle if the first is draining.  Cap the
first bottle on the kitchen top, close to the bottling bucket and if
convenient, place in the sink or on the drainer to catch any last drips.  .
Repeat until completed.  I always put a couple of smaller bottles in as
well in case the last amount in the bucket is insufficient for a full
(larger) bottle.  When bottling is finished, I rinse the outside of the
bottles, drain and then place in a warm place to ensure effective priming.
I prefer to rinse and drain as the draining is concurrent with the cleaning
and tidying up.


Using this method there is little strain on the door.  There is a maximum
of two full bottles at any one time, and  little delay between filling and
bottling.  I designed the kitchen (with my wife/better half) and can carry
out this whole process without having to move from the one spot.  There are
occasional drips onto the floor between the door and the top, but they only
take 10 seconds to wipe at the end of the process.


Hope this is useful

As many fans of Celis Grand Cru know, its distribution has been greatly
curtailed and is only available in a few states now.  Pity the fans who
became hooked, only to have their favorite product pulled from the shelves.


I'd like to propose that interested homebrewers engage in a project to
decode the recipe for Grand Cru.  Doing so is going to require analysis
of the flavor profile, lots of experiments, and perhaps ancedotal legend
and lore of Belgian brewing techniques.


The process I've got in mind is :
   1) Collect information on what might constitute a Grand Cru recipe
   2) Formulate a set of recipe expirements and distribute them to
        HBD volunteers.
   3) Exchange results with other volunteers.  Evaluate and adjust 
        recipe experiments
   4) goto (2)


Hmmm.... looks like an infinite loop.  And it might well be - the odds
are against a bunch of homebrewers stumbling onto the results of decades
of brewing tradition.  But you never know.  In any case, some interesting
and tasty beers are a sure result.


I'll volunteer to coordinate the project and basically serve as a focal
point for distributing information.  Anyone else interested or am I the only
one jonesing for a Grand Cru ?

Subject: Gott stories


The thread on Gott-ness brings to mind my most recent batch that attests 
to the potential flexibility of our little orange friends.  First some 
background:  my Gott has a circular copper manifold setup from Jay 
Hersch's design (found on Spencer Thomas' web page); usual yield is from 
29 to 32 points.  After a year or so of single-infusion mashes, I've 
lately been trying a variety of different methods for step-infusions.  
The easiest is to dough in a thick mash (something like 1qt/lb) for the 
first rest and raise to conversion temperatures with boiling water 
(usually .3qt/lb works for me).  However, I've been using the 40/60/70 
schedule of late with D-C malt, so I outfitted the Gott with a steam 
generator.  Ideally, my method is:  achieve 40C at dough in; add boiling 
water plus steam to get to 60C; add steam to get to 70C.  Anyway, with my 
latest batch, I was spaced out and added *all* of my water at dough in.  
Yikes!  Decoction, anyone?  So steam *plus* decoction to get to 60C and 
another decoction (and I'm talking pulling thick grist, not liquor), to 
get to 70C.  And then a long *slow* sparge (it was a pumpkin ale, which 
seems to really goo up the flow).  Yield was 30 points.  I crack the first 
bottle tonight.


I suppose with patience and a willingness to do *anything* to retrofit 
your Gott, you can pursue just about any temperature schedule.

Actually a cheaper and easier Gott spigot is to go to your HB store and buy

You bet.  I think that this is the main reason that the American Pale
Ale catarogy was created.  I happen to be a big fan of Cascade.  When
I restarted my brewing interest a couple of years ago I went back to what 
was familar and used my old love, cascade.  I made a pretty respectable 
northern brown ale but when my friend, the beer judge, tasted it he said 
that it couldn't be a real brown it had to be an "american brown" because
of the hops.

Yes, there is a reason not to grow your yeast starter on corn sugar
(glucose). Glucose is a "repressing" sugar (as in catabolite repression),
meaning it will prevent the yeast from making the enzymes needed to
transport other sugars (like maltose) into the cell. If you grow the starter
on glucose, the yeast will need more time after pitching to synthesize the
proteins needed to transport maltose into the cells, and this could
contribute to a longer than desirable lag time (likely) and possibly even a
high terminal gravity (less likely). It's best to grow the starter using a
wort similar to the one you'll be fermenting, thus malt extract is
preferable to corn sugar. Good luck.

I don't think this is that big a deal.  The most important thing with
a wit is getting it to taste right.  Clarity is just one little item
worth (I think) just 2 of the 50 points on the sheet.


>When it's first chilled, it's nice and cloudy.


That indicates that you've got chill haze.  Wits are supposed to
suffer from permanent haze, that is, they're supposed to be hazy
even when they're warm.


>After several days chilled, it clears.


Chill haze tends to settle out after time.  That's one of the reasons
lagerers lager: to get a nice bright product.  The only way to combat
the "problem" of chill haze going away is to make sure you've got lots
of it.


>If I remember ,the haze is
>due to the protiens from the unmalted wheat.


That's only half the story.  Chill haze is formed by protein combined
with tannin.  Tannin in beer comes from hops and grain husks.  Since
wits are not very bitter and get their aroma and flavor from stuff like
curacao orange and coriander, you won't get a lot of hop tannin in your
beer.  Since you're using about 50% or so wheat, which has no husk, and
your sparging techniques are impeccable :-), you're not getting much
tannin from husks.  Therefore, you won't be getting as much chill haze
as you get in, say, that tasty IPA you brewed last year.


>Can anything be done to
>keep the beer cloudy when chilled for extended lengths of time?


Starch haze to the rescue!  Use a less intensive mash program than you
normally use.  If you insist on doing a protein rest, keep it very short.
Keep your saccharification time as short as possible to convert most of
the starch to sugar and mash out at 170 to prevent further degradation
of starch.

I preach.

Subject: Re: Ice to cool wort




I've used pre-boiled ice to cool the wort.  It works pretty well, but
there are a few things to keep in mind.


1) If you add ice to the wort (if it doesn't cool down enough after
pouring the wort over the ice) you will develop a density and
temperature gradient -- cold thin wort on top, thick warm wort on
bottom.  So you have to make sure the wort is mixed well prior to
pitching.  


2) In order to end up with a final gravity close to your intentions,
you have to have pretty reliable measures of the exact volumes
involved.  Estimating evaporation during boiling is the most difficult
part.


3) In a standard run-of-the-mill refrigerator, it takes a while to
freeze warm water.  I busted mine by trying to freeze up 4 2-liter
bottles at once.  The water started at about 100 degrees when I put it
in.  The compressor ran constantly for 18 hours untill it froze the
internal workings-- and my sterile water still wasn't totally frozen
yet.  (good think I only rent)


Spend the 20 bucks and build a simple imersion chiller, its much
easier to deal with.

Subject: Wyeast #1098 question/worry


hi all.  lemme start this out by saying i'm new to brewing.  my second
batch is sitting in primary right now, and it's behaving quite
differently than my first batch, which is in secondary.


the first batch is a kolsh/alt kind of thing using the Wyeast kolsh
yeast (don't remember the number offhand).  it'd been in the bag for a
few months, so it took a few days for the package to swell, up and a
few days in the carboy before there was any visible activity.  once it
started, though, it spent about one day with some subtle bubbling,
then about 3 days spewing through the blowoff.  i racked it after it
had slowed down a bit.  it's now been over two weeks since i brewed
it, and there's still some very slow activity in there.


my second batch (the one i'm not sure if i should worry about or not)
is going to be a bitter using the Wyeast 1098 british ale yeast.  the
yeast i got was much fresher than the kolsh from above, and activated
sooner.  after about 36 hours, it was happily sending krausen through
the blowoff.  the next time i checked on it (18 hours later), the
krausen had clogged the blowoff, blown the lid off the carboy, and
spewed down the sides of the carboy.  rather than the thick foam type
of krausen from the previous batch, this stuff was some very solid
matter.  kinda like a loose sponge.  i scooped some of it out of the
top of the carboy before putting the cap back on, and was amazed at
how solid it was.  anyway, the next morning it was gurgling a bit as
expected, but not with the fury that the alt had at the same stage.
last night i removed the blowoff setup and put an airlock on it and
this morning it was bubbling very slowly.  it's been 4 days since i
brewed it.  should i be worried that there's so little activity now?
it had an OG of 1.054.  i may do a check tonight to see if the yeast
has already chowed through all the fermentable sugars or not.  if the
gravity hasn't dropped significantly, what should i do to get things
going again?  is the behavior i'm seeing typical of the #1098 yeast?


any info would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: PH of tapwater


I just recently purchased a PH meter, and have found that the tap water in
Seattle is ph 8.5, but filtered through a charcoal filter is 6.5 to 7.0. 


Any comments or thoughts on this?
