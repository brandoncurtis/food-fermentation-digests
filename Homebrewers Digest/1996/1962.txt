Subject: yeast starter question


Last Tuesday, I created a starter culture, because I was planning on
brewing Friday night.  In the meantime, my area (Salem, Oregon) had some
pretty serious flooding.  As a result of the flooding a we now have a
drinking water shortage.  It looks like it might go on for quite some
time.


I don't want to brew until the shortage is over.  What should I do about
my starter in the meantime?  Should I just pitch it when the time comes,
or do I need to do something special to get it going again?

Subject: Grainbags




Newbie, first time poster alert!
I'm planning to brew a dobble bock from C.Papazians book this weekend.
I have brewed with specialty malts in the past, but in small quantities, 
using
just a strainer.  I now have a grain bag and not sure how to use it.  Is it
essentially a giant strainer?
The plan was to steep the grains in my 5 gal. brewkettle.
Dump the grains into the grainbag.
Sparge into my bottling bucket, with the spigot open wide, plastic tube
going to bottom of brewkettle, for no aeration of hot wort.
Is this correct?


Should I steep the grains in the grainbag in brewkettle, and slowly sparge
into the same pot, removing the grainbag as soon as all sparge water is 
dumped?
Should the bag sit on the bottom of the brewkettle or bottling bucket?


Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: Re: Nylon stocking hop bag


Hello Group,


Just read a post in HBD 1960 about using nylons (the type women
wear) as hop bags.  I would just like to caution everyone that
most, if not all, nylons have dyes in them that you definitely
would not want in your beer.  I once used a section of an old
pair of nylons as a filter for the bottom of my racking cane.
I sanitized it by putting it in a bowl of water and microwaving
it.  When I did this the water in the bowl turned brown and I
had to repeat the process several times using fresh water to
get all of the dye out.  So, if you're going to use nylons
for hop bags I would strongly suggest that you pre-boil them to
get all of the dye out of them first.


Good Brewing,

Ever since reading an article from one of your Ausie compatriots on
steam, I have been converting and trying to fine tune my own steam
system.  My research condensed down is:  the aluminum pot will give
a give a better heat transfer but is a better heat transfer really
necessary?  You can just increase the btu a little with your burner.


Any thermal engineers out there can help...but what I came up with
is that you can make a 5 gal batch with 2 gallons of water in a 
steamer with 180,000 btu.  It does not take double to make a 10 gal
batch.  Approximately 3 gal and if you have one of the 200,000 plus
burners, you have everything you need.  By the way...this includes
coiling the SS steam tube back through the flame to superheat it.


So back to the steam pressure cooker...since you are only going to
have plain water at a fairly neutral ph, around 7, during steaming...
you don't have to worry about leaching the aluminum (and any heavy
metal would settle anyway)...you can get a completely aluminum 
cooker without the expense of the SS and still get the transfer.


I wanted to give myself a 100% margin on my calulations because 
murphy has found a home in my brewery.  I found a 21.5 qt (5.4 gal,
app. 20 liters) for $117 at OSH - Orchard Supply Hardware.
(805) 681-1500 - They are a chain so you might find them elswhere.
NDA (Normal Disclaimers Apply - No Assoc. etc)  The larger cookers
were not on the shelf but the price difference was insignificant.
ie the 15qt was $99!  The 40 if you really need it should not be
much more. -NDA   The lids have a pressure guage, and a weighted
pressure regulator with an emergency relief valve.  When you look
on the inside, there is a built up area that can be easily tapped
for the steam outlet port without modifying any of the safety 
features.


As I am still in the process of conversion/tuning any suggestions
or modifications to the above would be helpful.  ie how large of
a manifold can I go with and still maintain enough pressure for
mashing or a roiling boil?  If I put the manifold under the tun
screen can I replace the RIMS and how much pressure before I start
to upset the grain bed? etc. etc.


For those with an entrepreneural spirit...I would be very willing
to pay for this type of information...so go write a book!  I've
searched the libraries and ordered book transfers throughout CA
and still have questions about a good design.  But I now have the
information to work on boilers....yee ha. :-}   TIA

I know I'm stating the obvious here but....


Start with hotter water...before the RIMS and now my current conversion 
to steam, (which will work with coolers on the mash & sparge) I used 
almost 190 degree water.  See the previous HBDs (within the last 2-3 
months) and see that others have actually used boiling water.  I never 
got that high but the idea is the same.


Also you might want to increase the insulation on your cooler if it is 
decreasing that quickly.  I also used a small heating pad against the
wall and then covered with towels held in place with a bungee cord.


Save the stock pot for decoctions or infusions...its a better use. :-)

Subject: Mike's List of homebrew suppliers


Well you folks were right.  I have recieved and replied to over 150 e-mail
requests for my list of homebrew mail-order suppliers.  Many of you have
also asked for a copy of the final list when it is completed in a few
months.  (As of now the list is about 11 pages long, I expect the final list
to be about 30 pages in length.)


So to alleviate me from the burden of constantly having to reply to e-mail
requests I have put the latest update of the list on one of my web pages.
Set your browser to:


http://www.datasync.com/~mike/cafe.html


There you will find the latest update of the list, including the final
version when it is available.


I will no longer be accepting e-mail requests for the list.


Thanks for all of your interest, it makes me feel I am doing something
worthwhile.

Yeast cannot leave by sugar alone......(or something like that)
Yeast needs compounds besides sugars to function, which aren't provided by 
pure corn sugar.  DME not only contains the sugar, but other nutrients as 
well.


Your quart starter should work fine for a 5 gal. batch.  When I'm brewing an 
ale, I usually just step a smack pack up to 1 pint and pitch that.  (That's 
just me though!)

I've used them a few times now for filtering out fruit pulp, "floaties", and
such -- I tie one over the end of my racking cane. I've never tried using one
as a hop/grain bag for boiling.


As far as sanitizing goes: I could be wrong, but I don't think bleach or
Idophor would do a very good job. The fine mesh seems to trap a lot of tiny
air bubbles, which probably prevents contact sanitizers from getting at
everything. I've tried boiling them for a couple of minutes to sanitize them;
a lot of the color seemed to leach out into the water, but they seemed to be
otherwise unharmed. IMO this is actually a pretty strong argument for
pre-boiling them before trying to use them for anything beer related -- I'd
rather not have any of the dye (or whatever it is) leaching into my beer!


Food grade? Probably not, but close enough for me. You're not actually going
to *eat* them, after all! (My uneducated guess would be that they're
"non-toxic", but not strictly "food grade".) FWIW, anything that doesn't come
off when you boil them probably won't leach into the beer in significant
amounts.


> 1) Yes, make sure to properly clean the nylons.  You don't want a judge to

Or just buy *new* ones -- they're pretty cheap. If it's too embarrassing, get
your wife (or S.O.) to buy them for you. :-)

From: brewshop`at`coffey.com (Jeff Struman)
Subject: new mash tun problems




This is my first 'contribution' to the digest, although it is actually a
question.  I have been brewing for about 4 years, and all grain brewing for
about 1 year.


I recently set up a new brewery using a 52 quart Coleman rectangular
camping cooler with 1/2" pvc pipe false bottom plumbing.  (I used to use a
zapap system)  I have brewed two beers with this new system using a three
step infusion mash (protein rest, saccharification and mash out.)  Both of
of these beers have had terrible O.G.s.  Using the Amazing Wheel of Beer I
have calculated my efficiency at roughly 50%!  :(  I think I have a few
problems to iron out.  Following are what I think are the most serious
problems.  I would greatly appreciate any feedback on what needs fixin' and
what doesn't matter.


1)  I managed to use all pvc fittings to install a plastic spigot into the
existing drain plug hole in the cooler.  But, because the drain plug hole
is drilled so high into the end of the cooler, the plumbing on the spigot
end of the cooler is about 1" off the bottom of the cooler.  The plumbing
then slopes down and rests on the other end of the cooler.  Am I losing a
lot of fermentables in this space below the plumbing?  Or is there any
other reason why this may affect my efficiency?  I hack sawed slots into
the 1/2" pvc pipes every 1.5" and I have three pipes, each about 18" long.


2)  Second, this cooler is larger than I really wanted but I couldn't
resist the end-of-summer sale at Target and I bought it brand new for $13
(I live in Wyoming, where the demand for coolers meets that of sun tan
lotion during our eight months of winter.)  Anyway, twelve pounds of malt
in this mash tun gives me a grain bed depth of about 5 to 6 inches after
doughing-in.  Is this depth too shallow?  I know the 'experts' suggest a
deeper bed, but is this depth adequate?


3)  I sparge using my 6 gallon bottling bucket as a hot water tank.  I
built a sparge 'arm' out of two pvc pipes that span the length of the
cooler.  The two pipes have very tiny holes drilled in them and they seem
to work perfect.  But, in order for the sparge water to adequately spray
out of the pipes and cover the whole grain bed I have to keep the spigot on
the hot water tank about 3/4 open.  This means I circulate 5 gallons of
sparge water in about 10 minutes.  I know that is too fast.  Is this
causing me to lose a lot of gravity?


4)  Finally, I collect about 6 to 7 gallons of wort and boil down to 5
gallons over 60 to 90 minutes on the stove.  I don't think putting any more
water into my kettle is wise since it already takes well over 30 minutes to
get my wort boiling after sparging.  Should I be collecting more wort?  Is
the long lag time between sparging and boiling critical?  And, finally
finally, I have been exhausting my sparge water and then letting the mash
tun completely drain into my kettle before commencing my boil.  Is it ok to
completely drain the mash tun like this?  I have read and heard so many
conflicting reports on this procedure that I am totally befuddled.


Thanks a ton in advance for any help.

to cover half my brewery to get six inch depth?


I believe that I read in brewing techniques or that $130 set of books
on the science of...that the "IDEAL" depth was actually a ratio.  The
depth should be equal to the diameter...hmmmm was that right?


Sorry about so many responses in one day!  Just one of those moods :-}

Why bother to take a reading between primary and secondary anyway.  The
only reason for the transfer is to seperate the beer from the cold break,
trub, and dead yeasties.  A lot of people here will tell you even that 
is not necessary.  But to go on...You can improve this beer considerably 
by waiting until the secondary is finished and giving it a little aging 
time.  The proper amount of time is determined by your personal taste
buds as it will continue to mellow with age.


Hmmmm guess I'll look at the recipe now...

If you are improving the sugar extraction (better efficiency) by 
improving the hot water circulation and/or temperatures with...
raking, RIMS, flow or whatever other process.  It seems to me that
you will also increase the coloring effect, however minor.  There
will "obviously?" be a greater difference when considering percentages
of increase.  Thus improving the extraction by three percent when 
considering the total grain percentage of dark versus light malts
will necessitate a minor change.  But if you increased first the 
percentage of dark malts, then a change in effiency would make
a larger apparent change in color.  Taking it to the extreme, if
the extraction effiency had no effect,  the coloring agents must
not be dependant on the same changes as the sugar.  Thus dipping
the dark malt in cold water would result in the color release?!?


Hmmmmm got to go try it.  Personally, I think Tom Wenck has a firm
grasp of intuitive.

I think that these two paragraphs are related.  I would guess that the
low efficiency is due to sparge water simply going around the
perforated plate, between the plate and the wall of the cooler.  My
Gott modification solves this problem, has only about 1 quart of dead 
space and routinely gets over 30 pts/lb/gal, but it involves a bit 
more work.


At a boating supply store I bought a 5/8" a brass bulkhead fitting.
This fitting is threaded internally for 3/8".  I also purchased a
hose barb with 3/8" threads, and 2 flare elbows.  I flared a short 
arc of copper tubing (6") and drilled a larger hole in the side of 
the pizza plate that an flare elbow threads into.  The other elbow 
is on the inside side of the bulkhead fitting.  The hose barb goes on 
the outside side of the bulkhead fitting.


About 3.25 (cut to fit) feet of 1" thick-walled tubing (Tygon in my 
case) was slit lengthwise and fit all around the edge of the pizza pan.  


The bulkhead fitting with external hose barb and internal flare elbow
fits into the spigot hole of the Gott.  The perforated pizza pan with
circumferential tubing seal and flare elbow lays upside down on the
bottom of the cooler and the short arc of flared tubing connects the 2
flare elbows.  Everything fits together finger tight.

>I would be interested to know what techniques/methods the "Gott

>is the mash "heated" between the steps?


A few ways to do this.  Start with a stiff mash of 1qt/lb then add
boiling water at each step.  Often you end with a thin mash.


Do a decoction-like process.  Simply remove portions of the mash,
quickly bring them to a boil (no rests), and add them back.  Highly 
diastatic malts work best for this.  Watch the mash pH!


Some combination of the above, i.e., first step with boiling water, next 
step with removal/boil.


>If you are doing specific heat type calculations to determine the

I am doing these calculations and I preheat the cooler with HOT tap
water which gets it to about 130+F (I raised my water heater), then I
ignore it.  I prefer to err on the too cool side, because I can always
pull a couple quarts, boil, then return to adjust upward quickly.


Another trick is to preheat your grain in the oven to your first
target temp, then just combine it with water at the same temp.

My 2 cents:  Cooking catalogues sell heat diffusers made out of anodized 
aluminum that will prevent your wort from burning.  An 11" one goes for 
about $30 ("Chef's catalogue"), which is a lot cheaper than the $120 
difference between your two pots, and you can use it with different pots.

very little chance of gastric distress if the flavor isn't horrible as well. 
 Take a sip, then a chug, and then a glass-ful.  If you live to tell about 
it, then bottle it!  Really, it is fine to let the taste-buds be your judge.

Can anyone give some hints to a soldering newbie?

should I just put a bead on the outside, where the cane and the cap
meet?


Any help would be appreciated.

instruments.  Any suggestions on testing scales?  One thought I had
for a fairly easy and repeatable test was weighing coins.  Does anyone
know how much any of standard U.S. coins weigh?  Is this overkill?

I've been moving up the homebrewing chain mainly by following the
techniques in Dave Miller's "Brewing the World's Great Beers" (and of
course, HBD).  I would still recommend the book to any beginner.  I
like the way he takes you through the process in steps -- extract,
extract with specialty grains/liquid yeast/wort chillers/etc., partial
mash, and all grain.  But when I moved up to all grain, finally, I
realized that he was saying that he got more than 35 pts/lb/gal.  Does
anyone really approach these figures?  Basically his all-grain recipes
have been useless to me.


When modifying a recipe for your own brewery, when your yield does not
match the one of the recipe's formulator, is it better to adjust the
amount of base grain to match the recipe's gravity, or should I try to
keep the ratio of base/specialty grains the same as was in the
original recipe?

sometimes i use polyurethane spray on inkjet output. spray both sides of the
paper to saturation several times. if it still smears, apply more coats the
next time. i have been thinking of making some generic labels and afixing
them to the bottles with polyurethane, and then filling in the blanks with a
grease pencil. for temporary sticking, i plan on trying rubber cement, which
is waterproof (so if the bottles sweat the lables stay on) but it will rub
off easy.  you might also try using a better grade of paper. a paper with a
clay finish will allow you to "trap" the ink between the finish and the
plastic spray. i think the darkening you see is the plastic being absorbed
by the paper. at work we use an inkjet paper and the same brand of spray
does not effect color/density/contrast/etc. oh, also about bubbles in the
paper: try putting one of the lables printed side down on a sheet of plate
glass and tap the glue side with a very sharp needle all over. the
"microperf" might allow the air to escape. if you're careful it might not be
visible from the front. sorry if i ramble today, i've been at work too long

Jackson was actually in Hoboken a few months back, so they are sort 
of looking for someone different to speak not about the beers, but 
of the history and the culture of the American brewing tradition. 
If anyone out there can give me a name of someone who would fit this 
bill, please send email to me and I will pass the information along. 
The person could be famous or not so famous, but a requirement is 
that they would know what they are taling about. Thanks a million, 
and now back to your regularly scheduled homebrew digest...

Rather than pre-boil water, I have purchased 4L jugs at the grocery store
and frozen them no problem.

It all depends on how much ice you use.  Using 12L of ice to cool 8L of
wort is way too much. :)  I would recomend using 4L of ice to cool
8L of wort  and then making up the remaining volume with cold water.
This works best for all extract batches.  For all grain, one often
must chill 5 gallons of boiling wort to pitching temps.  My interest
in this subject comes from looking for ways to increase production.
Thus, if I boil a 1.090 wort to 5 gallons, and then split it into 
two 5 gallon batches, I only have 2.5 gallons / batch to cool, which 
could easily be done with two 4L ice cubes.

You need a good idea, but my technique is usually to under estimate, and then
top up in a 5 gallon US carboy.

I would never try to freeze hot water like that.  If you buy the water
jugs from the store and then use a clean serated knife to cut the jugs off
the ice blocks, you'll get lots of reasonably sanitized ice.

It also takes a lot longer.  Mine works reasonably well, but if I do keep
using a chiller I'll probably design and build a counterflow chiller soon.

Subject: Time to chill wort in summer


Several people have written saying that it takes a much longer time to chill
their wort in the summer with immersion chillers because the tap water is too
warm.  This problem can be solved by making a short initial chiller that is put
in an ice water bath and then lead to the main chiller in the wort. This way you
will always have water that is cold summer and winter.
