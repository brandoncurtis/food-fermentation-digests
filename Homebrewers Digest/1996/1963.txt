Subject: Questions about lagers


Hi all,


I am a newbie and until recently only brewed ales with good success.  About 
a month or so ago, I decided to brew the rocky raccoon honey lager in 
TNCJOHB.  Inplace of the specified yeast, I used Wyeast #2112.  The 
fermentation took a total of 3 weeks to complete (It did 10 days in the 
primary and 11 in the secondary).  The resulting beer is very clear. 


However, I may have rushed things a bit (probably due to my inexperience 
with lagers) and bottled it shortly after fermentation stopped.  Now for my 
problem.  The beer has been aging in the bottles for 2 weeks.  Well last 
night I thought I would try it to see how it is going.  First thing I 
noticed is that the sediment on the bottom of the bottle is a dark color.
Second problem is that the beer was flat.  Third problem is that it had a 
harsh taste to it.  Sort of reminded me of grain alcohol.  While I don't 
think that this beer will be salvagable, I was wondering if anyone has any 
idea of what I could have done wrong.


TIA

Subject: RE: rehydration of Irish moss


Hi all, Greg King asks:
>Should Irish moss should be rehydrated prior to being added to boiling wort?
>If the answer is yes, then what is the proper rehydration procedure?
This topic was covered extensively on the digest sometime early this year
but the general concensus seemmed to be that rehydration was a good idea.
I usually put a spoon full of Irish moss in a half cup of warm tap water
at the beginning of my brew session (or as soon as I remember !) give it a
quick stir and set it aside until the last few minutes of the boil.
This seems to work great.

What's the deal with this anyway? I thought the reason for Celis selling out
to Miller was to INCREASE distribution, not "curtail" it. Did the plan

Subject: Big Rock Pale Ale


I've just started brewing, and I would like to make a pale ale
similar to something I'm familiar with, and fond of. One of my
favourite commercial beers is Big Rock Pale Ale. I was wondering
if there are any Western Canadians who could suggest an extract
recipe that is close to this? If not, could you educate me about
what type of beer this is? (British or American pale ale,
IBUs, etc.)

Mike O'Brien (obrien`at`cyberspace.org), who handles the day to day
operations of Pico, is in CHINA demonstrating the Pico system!  A
Chinese national who lives in Atlanta bought three complete systems and
is paying Mike's way to go help them set up.  I don't know if this
Chinese is planning to market them there or what.  Mike left early this
week, taking with him enough ingredients to brew a batch or two.  He
didn't know what to expect when he got there as far as ingredients,
electricity, propane, propane fittings, etc, but the guy told him he'd
meet him there and take care of it.  Mike may be back by now as he said
he would be spending more time in the air than on the ground in China.
I'm looking forward to hearing from Mike about his trip.


I'm sure Mike will get back to you about the paddles.  BTW, he has them
made up for him from white oak by Jim Johnston, another member of the
Ann Arbor Brewers' Guild.  Jim made me a short one for my 10 gallon
imitation Pico.

Subject: Recall on galvanized pipe opinion / RIMS question


As some of you may remember I recently posted my rather unpopular
opinion that galvanized piping was probably safe to use in a brewing
system (RIMS, in my case) and that the worst that *might* happen is
a metallic taste to my beer.  Someone responded in private that it
seemed that my conclusion was pre-determined, that I knew what I
wanted to concluded before I did my research.  Well, this may very
well be the case, as I had already built my system out of galvanized
pipes and I didn't want to rebuild it.  So I rethought my conclusion
and looked for the weak spots in my thinking.


My conclusion was based on both facts and some assumptions.  I knew
that copper is MUCH more toxic than zinc in equal concentrations yet
we brew in copper all of the time.  So I assumed that, while zinc is
probably more soluable than copper, it was probably at least similar
in its soluability so as not to become a problem.  I pulled out my
old water chemistry book to check this assumption and boy was I
wrong!!!  Even considering the high probability that I made some
errors on my calculations, zinc appears to be many, many, MANY orders
of magnitude more soluable than copper.  I don't know the exact
concentraction of Zn++ that would occur, only it's approximate ratio
to Cu++ if copper pipes were used, all other things being equal, so
I still can't say if the levels would be toxic or not.  But the
chances of it being toxic, or even ruining the taste of my beer, are
no longer within my levels of tolerance, so I have rebuilt my RIMS
heating chamber.  Now you can all sleep better not having to worry
that one of my tainted beers will show up at your club's contest =)


Now I have some RIMS questions.  How do those of you with RIMS 
deliver the wort to the top of the grain bed gently and evenly?  And 
do you think occasional stirring of the grain bed is necessary (maybe 
between temp steps) to eliminate temperature pockets, or should the 
grain be be shallow enough (even with a 10 gallon batch in a modified 
sankey keg) so as not to have these temperature pockets?  TIA for all 
advice!

Subject: extraction efficency




Hi HBD,


I was wondering why the extraction efficency is generally lower with smaller
 batches??  I use a colman 48 Q coller and have a effiecncy around 27to 28.
  I read that somewhere around 30 is good for a homebrew.  Most micros?? seem
 to get closer to 35 pt/lb.  Is this have to do with the surface area to
 volume??  I'd really like to get an effiency that is higher.  I've made
 batches with decoction, 1 , 2 and 3 step infusion mashes and they all 
seem to yield about the same extraction.  A friend suggested to stop about
 halve way thru the sparge and stir up the grain bed and recirulate before
 resuming sparging.  I've also heard many people say it seemed completely
 dependant on false bottom.  


Is there any consensus??




Michael

Subject: Force carbonate with N2/CO2 mix?


Hi --


        I've seen some traffic here about the advantages of using a
nitrogen and carbon dioxide mix for dispensing from a corny keg setup, and
I'm tempted to try it out.  However, I have only one gas tank and don't
want to invest in another to try this experiment.  So, if I fill my one
tank with a N2/CO2 mix, is force carbonating (actually, "effervescing" is
probably the right word here) with the mix OK?  Or is that the whole idea
and I just didn't get it?


        Thanks for any advice.

Subject: Pin Lock Keg Tool


This may not be a revelation for anyone, but I was quite pleased with myself 
for adding to my gadgetry . . .


I use the pin lock style soda kegs for my brews, and have always had trouble 
getting the darn pin lock fixtures off so that I could clean.  My trusty 
crescent wrench would work, but only after much effort and possible damage to 
the fixture (such as popping one of the dang metal nips off - which I did!). 
 My grandfather's voice kept ringing through my head "the right tool for the 
job" or some such nonsense . . .  But then I saw in a recent issue of Zymurgy 
that someone was selling a socket for removing the pin lock fixtures for 
about $15.  Now, I'm way too cheap for that, and upon further review of the 
picture in the write-up, I saw that it was just a 13/16" deep well socket 
that had notches in the end to allow the metal nips to fit through.  


Since I didn't already have that particular type of socket . . . off to the 
hardware store I went.  A 13/16" deep well socket (spark plug style) was 
about $2.50.  I took it home and used a 4" hand held grinder to cut some 
notches in the correct pattern (four notches in the corners of the hex 
pattern - two across from each other, and two next to either one of those)- 
and viola! a new gadget for the brew box!


Nothing against those folks selling the tool for $15, I'm sure lots of people 
may not have the time, tools, or inclination to make their own gadget, and 
would gladly pay for the completed part.  Not I.


Not an earth shattering revelation, but if it saves a few kegs and or scraped 
knuckles, I've done my good deed for the day.

Subject: 8 Gal SS Pot - Reply summary


Thanks for the replies - here's a summary...


1) The most common recommendation was to cut up a keg (1/2 or 1/4),
and use that as a brewing vessel.  While this is a future possibility, I'm
still doing stove-top brewing, which makes this a difficult approach due
to space limitations.


2)  Apparently a $70 8 gal SS pot with top was located in southern
California at an Oriental grocery store.  So, my next trip into New York
will include a visit into Chinatown to see what I can find.  


3) The other recommendations included checking with a restaurant
supply house who might also carry used pots.


Thanks for all the responses - if I ever do locate one in the New York
metro area, I'll let everyone know.

This ad certainly implies that Zip City was at the GABF (they were not)

their beers won (of the many they entered).


I've also recently learned that the day before Christmas, Zip City was
closed and Heartland was open (within walking distance).  *Somebody*
plastered signs at the entrance to Zip City letting everyone know that
Heartland was open for business.  Gee, how thoughtful.

While the food grade contact is better answered by John Palmer, I
*can* tell you that 304 or 316 will be fine.  In fact, I am pretty
sure any SS will.


However, here is the cold water to splash on your face.  While the
pipe will be fine, you eventually have to connect it up to 1) 1"
female tapered pipe threads to accept the heater (yes, I know the
heater threads are MSPT, not MNPT, but they fit together) and 2) to
inlets and outlets of approximately 1/2" or so.  This means that you
will have to have fittings other than just the straight length of pipe
and the pipe will have to be welded or silver soldered to those
fittings.  Those fittings will be quite expensive.  Silver soldering
SS is not something you want to try, it is quite difficult to do
correctly and water tight.  TIG welding is your best bet, but getting
that done, IMHO, will end up costing you what you saved over getting
threaded pipe.


Parts for a complete heater chamber, ready to accept a 22" heater
element with T's and compression fittings on the input output side for
temperature probes will only cost about $130.  There is no welding, so
assembly should only cost the cost of a roll of teflon tape.

Subject: tannins in hop tea?


Greetings Brewers and Brewsters,


A quick question:


Some time back, someone (Algis, A. J.,?) said that if you boil hops to make
a hop tea instead of dry hopping that it would extract tannins that would be
added to your final product.  I also seem to remember someone saying that
the reason that the tannins are not extracted in a wort boil is because the
pH is so low.  So the question is: if you drop the pH in the tea with a 
little lactic acid would the tannin extraction be nullified?  


I've been dry hopping for quite some time now and even with a nylon bag
tied over the bottom of my racking cane it is a royal pain in the patootie
(PITP...) to move my beers to the keg or the bottling bucket.


Thanks for the BW and any replies.

I thought I might relate to you a story I heard the other day at my local
homebrew shop.  I will try to be as accurate as possible but I can't
guarantee it...


It seems that one of the employee's (or customer, not sure which) had 
entered the BBC's homebrew contest last fall and ended up winning one of 
the categories.  I guess he didn't make it to the final round because they 
never called him to fly to Boston.  Anyway, do you think he would have 
received some kind of award for winning the category?  He received the same 
shirt and hops that all the other entrants received.  You would think that 
they would have at least sent him a certificate or ribbon of some kind.  
The BBC at work again.




Also in #1961, Dave Houseman wrote about a replacement for Gott spigot...

Rag mode on...


Am I the only one that finds the spigots used in bottling buckets to be a 
pain in the butt?  The type I use is a plastic spigot that has a thin 
plastic disk through which the spigot attaches.  Whenever I try to attach 
tubing or turn the spigot open, the spigot spins toward the ceiling and I 
end up touching the end of the spigot with my hands to try to hold it in 
place.  Not very sanitary.  
And Heaven forbid if you put the bucket on a counter top and don't hang the 
spigot off the edge.  The spigot bends and pulls the disk away from where 
it is seated and ends up leaking, forever!  AAHHHH!!  


The next thing is that there are two holes in the spigot, one where the 
wort passes and a little hole on the opposite side.  Why that little hole 
is there I don't know, perhaps just to aggravate me.  Tell me if you have 
ever had this happen to you.  Occasionally, I have to move the filled 
bottles out of the way so I need to stop the flow of wort.  I turn the flow 
off and the little hole is now pointing towards me and the whatever else it 
may be aimed at.  I lift the racking cane a little bit and the wort comes 
shooting out all over the place!!  AAAHHH, AGAIN!


Why don't they seal the disk onto the housing so that the thing doesn't 
spin or leak? I usually end up with about a bottle of sugary, stickey, 
homebrew dripping on the dishwasher door, me, the floor...  What a waste.


Needless to say, I don't enjoy bottling at the moment and unfortunately I 
don't have room for kegging equipment.  Perhaps a Party Pig.


Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest.

Subject: Airlock Wierdness


Ok - now I'm stumped.  In preparation for brewing this weekend, I took out
two containers of yeast (salvaged through yeast washing) and fed them some
sterile 1.030 wort.  All appeared normal last night, but when I got home
tonight I noticed that one of the airlocks is actually running in reverse.


That's right, it's sucking air *into* the erlimyer flask.  I've been brewing
for some years now and I've never witnessed this before.  The flasks have
been side by side during propagation and there were no deviations from my
normal procedures.  The second flask exhibits normal activity.  I use
Iodophor as a sanitizer and am reasonably sure that sanitization isn't a
problem.  Even if it were, I'd still expect positive pressure in the airlock.
 The appearance of the starter is normal otherwise.


So my question to the collective is:  Can anyone explain this?  IMYP (Is My
Yeast Posessed?).  Needless to say, I won't be pitching this into my wort. 
I'll split the other starter between the carboys and make do.

The result of Erik's setting the specialty grains' sg contributions
to 0 may be better sg estimates, but I disagree completely with the
reasoning.  First, specialty grains may not contribute much in the
way of fermentables, percentage-wise, that's true.  This has nothing
to do with whether they contribute to the gravity of the wort.


Black patent contributes about 29 ppg, period.  Twenty-nine is the
number of the points, the number of points being 29.  It's not 25, nor
is it 30, but 29.  The fact that you only use 1 pound in a 20 pound
grain bill is how its contribution is accounted for.

You can do that, but the aluminum sandwich will spread the heat out evenly

Greetings, all;


  In a recent HBD, someone suggested washing bottles in a dishwasher
with two ounces of bleach.  Neat idea, but I didn't save the email
address of the author... and then when I tried to actually put the
bottles into the dishwasher, I became perplexed.  Placing them upside
down on the spines didn't work (the spines were too short, meaning the
bottles would rattle and possibly break in the wash) and I couldn't
figure any good way to anchor them.  What sort of geometry are you
using?  Are you doing bottles only, or mixing them with something else
to help them remain in place in the washer?


  I've been worrying (I know, its bad, but I'm new to the mantra)
about bottle sanitation, and this would be a wonderfully simple
solution.  Suggestions welcomed.

Thanks to Bruce Taber for his food-grade silicone posting.  I found another
which might be a bit more widely available.  It's made by Dow-Corning and is
sold as "DAP 100% Silicone Sealant" in the caulk-gun tube (about $4).  You
might also find it in a smaller squeeze tube too.  It doesn't have any more
identification that that, other than a note on the UPC symbol that says
"Reorder Cat No 8641.  It claims 25% joint mobility and -40F to +400F
operation.


There is a note on the tube which reads:


     "Safe for food contact: When cured and washed,
     ingredients which remain or which could migrate to 
     food are listed in FDA Regulation No. 21CFR177 2600"


I'd suggest you contact Dow Corning (ask for an MSDS for this product) and/or
the FDA (ask for info on the above regulation) concerning this before you
just plug away with it, but it appears from this note that you should be OK
especially using it in small amounts.

Subject: Mash Kettle/Chorine Sanitizer Questions


A couple of questions here:
First, after years of denial, I am finally in the market for a new mash 
kettle. The five-gallon enamelled steel canning vessel I inherited (okay, 
stole) from my stepmother was fine for my extract days, but now, after 
four or five all-grain mashes I've had it (believe me, there is nothing in 
the world less fun than trying to stir a mash kettle full to the rim, and 
don't even get me started on the logistics of a boil featuring said mash 
kettle and two other saucepans--yes indeed, folks; that's three burners 
going at once...on an electric stove). At any rate, my pot needs 
upgradin'--eight gallons at least, if only to keep the  spill rate down. 
Now, given the great price differential between aluminum and stainless 
steel, I'd like to ask everyone what they'd recommend buying. 
Alzheimer's is not a major concern here (nothing's been proved, etc 
etc...), but longevity and potential off-flavours are. Two aluminum pots 
are more expensive than one SS, but is it really likely I'll wear an 
aluminum pot out? (I brew about once a month, and I'm 23, so you do the 
math). Also, any personal anecdotes, warnings, words of wisdom, etc, 
would be appreciated.
Question two: I've always mixed my bleach solution up at home with cold 
water. I can't remember why, but I think Charlie recommends it in NCJHB. 
Whatever the case, that's how I do it. Last week, however, my boss (I 
work at a winemaking place) asked me why I was mixing up the chorine 
sanitizer (the pink powdery stuff; I think it's chemically pretty close 
to bleach) with cold water, as she's always used hot. Now this is a woman 
who's been making wine for twenty years, so I trust her unconditionally 
regarding matters fermentable, but sometimes her grasp on chemistry seems 
tenuous at best. So my question is: which of us is right? Does the 
temperature of the water prolong the potency of the sanitizer? Does it 
matter at all? 


TIA for your help,
Mitch.

I recently moved to Southern California from Colorado.  I've had to alter my

has a pH of over 8 (eight) and a hardness of over 300 ppm (San Diego).  I do 
not have a detailed water analysis yet, but my problems are obvious!  Adding 
to the problem is my limited knowledge of water chemistry (up until now, water 
was a commodity that I took for granted!).


I would like to find the best and most efficient way of treating my water.  
The options that I've discovered are running the water through a de-ionizer, 
adding an acid, and a sour mash.  Can someone explain the pros and cons of 
each process with detailed instructions; quantities; etc?

Subject: Them Crazy Germans


Somehow I managed to just get around to reading HBD 1931 tonight (you 
know, it's a good idea to take a look at your saved-messages file every 
now and then), and so I have a rather belated response to Carl Etnier's 
post about the Budwieser-craving German. Like Carl's father, my old man was
also stationed in Germany for a few years, and he too found a few of 
the locals who had developed a fondness for American beer. The worst 
offenders, however, were the enlisted folks who couldn't be bothered to 
try a few pints of Pils at the local bar but shopped at the CanEx (that 
would be the Canadian equivalent of the PX) for the latest offerings from 
Molson/Labatts. Somehow the fact that they were living in the land of 
beer didn't really sink in to these people. The CanEx also stocked only 
Ontario and California wines, even though the base was within spittin' 
distance of the Alsacian vinyards, but don't even get me started on that 
one. By far the funniest beer in the CanEx, however, was Heineken, whose 
box proclaimed proudly, "Imported and distributed in Toronto, Ontario". 
That's right, folks; the Dutch beer was sent all the way to Canada, 
bought by the Department of National Defense, and sent back to Germany. 
Your tax dollars at work. Never mind how markedly different the Heineken 
bought in Holland and that made for the export market taste, but just 
think about how old that stuff must've been. And in those unprotective 
green bottles, no less.

Wow, I think I got under a couple fingernails with my recent post on Ale
Experiments and Water Treatment!


Agreed -- the "experiment" was NOT scientific and controlled.  In its
inception it wasn't supposed to be.  It actually started as a "friendly
competition" betewen me and Gerry, always arguing (amiably) about "you do
this" and "I do that".  I guess I was just taken by the few notable
differences and just felt that given those differences, perhaps a few major
causes could be postulated.  Maybe not.


Also, on water treatment, I *have* dug out Mr deLange's articles but am just
not enough of a chemist to really figure out from them what to put in (or
even what some of the symbols are -- chemistry idiot at work here).  I can
certainly calculate ppm's of mineral ions from basic salt additions (gypsum,
epsom, NaCl, for example), but what this has done (if anything) to pH and
other things is what's stumping me.  If I get my basic salt ppm's in the
ballpark, is that close enough?  I'm not necessarily interested in making
Burton water to 10% accuracy; if I can make a profile (or a few profiles if
necessary) that's conducive to decent general purpose brewing, I'd be
thrilled.


WIth that I'll let it die.

First off, I'll state the obvious since you didn't mention it, that you 
must use lead-free solder.  No, you don't need much flux at all, if any,
your problem is that you are heating the solder and not the pipe. 
Solder will flow to the source of the heat.  The object is NOT to heat
the solder, but to heat the JOINT.  Once the piece is hot enough, THEN
touch solder to the rim of the cap and it will flow right into the
joint.  You don't want a "pool of solder" inside the pipe, you only want
the solder in the joint between the pipe and the cap.  The solder will
fill any void  between the pipe and the cap, and you should not have a
raised bead on the  outside nor any inside the pipe.  It's easy once you
get the hang of it.

For a cheap hop scale, try the local post office, or look elsewhere for
a postal scale.  These are only a couple of bucks.  You put some hops
(or whatever) in a baggie and clip them to the scale and hold it up till
it settles.  You have to compensate for the baggie of course.  It's 
quite accurate though.
