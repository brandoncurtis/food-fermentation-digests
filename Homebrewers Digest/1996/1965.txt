From: ajdel`at`interramp.com (A. J. deLange)
Subject: Water


In #1961 Ken Schwartz asked about simple water recipes using commonly
available salts:
For each 100 mg calcium carbonate (sometimes sold as precipitated chalk)
added per litre of deionized water water you will realize 40 mg/L (ppm)
calcium, 100 mg/L alkalinity as calcium carbonate and 100 mg/L total
hardness as calcium carbonate.


For each 43 mg gypsum added to one litre of water you will realize 10 mg/L
calcium, 25 mg/L hardness and 24 mg/L sulfate.


For each 16.5 mg table salt (not iodized) added to one litre of water you
will realize 10 mg/L chloride and 6.5 mg/L sodium.


For each 103 mg epsom salts added to 1 litre of water you will realize 10
mg/L magnesium, 41 ppm hardness and 40 mg/L sulfate.


Using these amounts gives:


           mg/L        Hardness     Alkalinity    Ca    Na    Mg   SO4     Cl
Chalk      100           100          100         40
Gypsum      43            25                      10                24
Table Salt  16.5                                         6.5               10
Epsom Salt 103            41                                  10    40


Totals                   166          100         50     6.5  10    64
10


These levels loosely approximate the waters of London, Munich and Dublin
and this water should be suitable for a pretty wide variety of beers. You
can adjust the proportions of the individual salts (all of which are
readily available) to acheive other ion contents. For example, 50 mg/L
chalk gives 50 mg/L hardness, 50 mg/L alkalinity and 20 mg/L calcium. A
good way to do this is to put the table above into a spread sheet and
fiddle with the left hand column as you watch the totals row.


When you have numbers you like, measure out the volume of deionized water
to be treated. Then add the salts. Now bubble carbon dioxide through the
water via an airstone (this is emulating mother nature) and stir until all
the chalk is dissolved i.e. until the water is clear. Now aerate it until
the pH gets a little over 7 or just let it stand. Eventually the pH will
reach 8.4 and you don't really need to check this. At this point the
profile should be about what you calculated.


* * * * * * * * * * * * *
In the same number Ron Thomson asks about pH of mashes made with his very
soft water. Very soft water has few minerals in it and so little "buffering
capacity". The pH of the mash is determined by the relative strengths of
the buffering systems of the malt and the water. As your water has little,
the malt will predominate and in the worst case, pale pilsner malt, you
should go to about pH 5.7 - 5.8. Any higher kilned malts in the grist will
result in a lower number.


When an acid rest is done, the calcium in the water reacts with the phytin
in the malt to release hydrogen ions and reduce the pH. As your water is so
soft (few calcium ions) it is unlikely that your pH will drop much during
an acid rest. Also note that acid rests take a long (hours) time. Typical
drops are about 0.1 pH unit i.e. to around 5.6 - 5.7.


The best way to determine the amount of lactic acid required to adjust to a
particular pH is to make a mini-mash i.e put a tenth of a pound of grist
into a beaker with about a tenth of the amount of water you intend to use
to dough in per pound. Mix well. Let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes
and check the pH. Now take 1 part 88% lactic acid and 9 parts water and mix
them thoroughly. Pipette a tenth of a mL of this at a time into the mini
mash, stir thoroughly and check the pH. When the pH reaches the desired
value, the number of mL you used to get to that pH is the number of mL of
88% lactic acid you will require PER POUND of grist in the actual mash.
When adding to the actual mash, add half the amount determined in this
tirtration, check the pH and then add the rest in increments, stirring and
checking after addition, to make sure you do not overshoot.


* * * * * * * *


Again in # 1961 David Pike asks why city water at pH 8.5 comes out of his
charcoal filter at pH 6.5 - 7. My usual suspicion in this case is that the
filter is more than a charcoal filter i.e. a filter like a Brita filter
which removes all cations and replaces them with hydrogen ions and all
anions, replacing them with hydroxyl ions in which case the water will be
neutral (pH 7). The other factor to consider is that de-ionized water in
contact with the air will pick up carbon dioxide (as will un-deionized
water but the ions mask the effect) which results in a lowering of the pH.
This is simply confirmed by boiling a sample of the water and checking the
pH. If it drops back to around 8.4 then CO2 was probably the cause
(assuming that the filter is really an ion exchanger with a carbon cleanup
filter).

Subject: Big Open Ferment Error


I brewed a 12 gal batch of a big stout (og=68) Sunday.  The fermenter
of choice was a 72-quart Igloo cooler, which I though would be perfect
as the open fermenter.  Bad call.


This morning the ferment was well underway, and tonight there was serious 
activity.  Three square feet of open fermenter really makes some noise 
(literally). Anyway, when I put my face down near the surface I detected 
warmth--wort temp read 88F--that's with a 68F room temp.  I moved the
unit to the garage to cool, but it's probably too late.


Moral: Containers of the right shape and volume do not necessarily make
good fermenters, and don't underestimate the heat produced by fermentation.

Subject: Homebrew BOF at SANS '96


Attention SANS '96 attendees!  I am attempting to organize (in the loosest
sense of the word) a Homebrew BOF at the upcoming SANS '96 conference.  If
you are attending and are interested, bring a six-pack of your favorite 
recipe and we'll get together, taste each others' fares, and share war 
stories.  Extract and full mash brewers alike are welcome.


SANS is the System Administration, Networking and Security Conference.
It takes place this year from May 12-18 in Washington, D.C.  For more
conference details, check out http://www.usenix.org/events/sans96.html.


Check the BOF board at the conference for final details.  Also, I'd like
to get a rough head count, so if you are interested, please email me and
let me know.


And it's not too late to get that batch brewing!  I just racked mine to
secondary; it should be quite ready by May.

From: "Ray Cooper" <Ray_Cooper`at`msn.com>
Subject: RE:RIMS Delivery


In HBD #1963, Keith Royster asked:
How do those of you with RIMS deliver the wort to the top of the grain bed 
gently and evenly?  And do you think occasional stirring of the grain bed is 
necessary (maybe between temp steps) to eliminate temperature pockets, or 
should the 
grain be be shallow enough (even with a 10 gallon batch in a modified sankey 
keg) so as not to have these temperature pockets?  


I kind of followed the idea in the Zymurgy, 1992 Special Edition where the 
mash liquor is delivered on top of a 1/8 inch thick piece of perforated 
acrylic (plexiglass) which sits on top of the grain bed. I make sure that the 
end of the delivery hose is beneath the level of mash liquor in the tun. This 
tends to diffuse the flow to allow gentle distribution across the entire top 
of the grain bed. This works great for delivering the sparge water as well. 
The only problem has been that at 167F, my acrylic disk has warped. Since I 
mash in a 10 gallon Gott cooler, perhaps a better solution would be one of the 
round perforated stainless steel pizza pans that has been discussed recently 
on the digest. I've been meaning to check those out.


This type of setup eliminates the ability to stir the mash except with 
possibly a concentric stirring paddle which I have considered. As long as the 
flow of wort liquor is sufficient to heat the grain bed thoroughly and 
quickly, additional stirring should not be nessesary. I've only done 5 gallon 
batches. I would probably incorporate a stirring paddle if I were to use a 
converted Sankey keg to do 10 gallon batches, especially if it was 
uninsulated.


On the subject of RIMS systems, after hearing of the problem of carmelization 
of the mash liquor on the heating element of RIMS direct heat chambers and 
cost considerations, I decided to try something a little different. I pump the 
mash liquor from the bottom of the tun through 20 feet of 3/8 inch coiled 
copper tubing placed in 2 gallons of water in a insulated plastic bucket 
heated with a 1000 watt electric heating element. Kind of like an immersion 
chiller. I was wondering if anyone else out there had tried something like 
this? I know the efficiency has to be about 40 percent less (5 gal batch) than 
a direct heat chamber when new because 2 additional gallons are heated, but 
how badly is the efficiency of the direct heater affected by carmelization as 
it gets used?

From: chemist`at`io.com (Brian McGovney)
Subject: Yeast and sore throats


        Here's a question for the med students out there ... is there any
reason why yeast would cause a sore throat for some people if they quaff
young beer?  I've made about seven batches now, all of which have been good,
if not stellar, with no overt signs of contamination (no scum, no bottleneck
rings after my first batch, no off flavors).  


In the last 3-4 batches, I've begun to notice that after primary
fermentation, after I take an S.G. reading and drink the green beer from my
hydrometer jug or mug, I get a scratchy throat within 12 hours.  The
possibility of a connection between the two has only occured to me recently,
and when it did, I immediately thought of some sort of otherwise
undetectable bacterial contamination as the cause.  


However.  Yesterday I brewed a batch of Pale Ale, and whoops, I pitched the
Wyeast packet before taking a hydrometer reading.  Ahhh, what the hell, I'll
just take a quick one now.  Syphon, measure, <gulp>.  It's been a day since
then, and, yep, scratchy throat.  But I had just pitched the yeast into wort
which had been at 212F less than an hour earlier!  There's no way a bacteria
could take hold in the wort that fast (is there?).


If it turns out that I'm allergic to yeast, I'm really going to be cheesed
off.  So, does anyone have an explanation?


I'm sure others would like to hear the answers to this on the digest, but as
I am temporarily unable to subscribe to the HBD, email replies would be
appreciated as well.  And thanks in advance, ya buncha hopheads.

This is a tricky subject since the scottish style has varied a lot historica=
lly.
What Al writes is certainly true for today's scottish ales (check out
Caledonian 80/- for example, an extremely hoppy and refreshing ale), and
what Ken and Gabrielle sais seems to apply to scottish ales of a century
ago, say.


Check out Greg Noonan's "Scotch and Scottish Ales" in the Classic Beer
Style series for a nice historical account of the style and both
present-day and 1850's recipes. The old scotch ales seems to have had much
higher OG:s (up to 1.120), FG:s (around 1.030) and low hopping rates. An
interesting detail is the similarity of the brewing method to lager
brewing. Roasted barley seems to be an important ingredient, though it is
not used in all present-day scottish ales.


Greg Noonan seems to follow the AHA style definition that states OG for
scottish ales between 1.030-50 and for scotch ale between 1.072-85. There
is quite a big gap between the styles - comments anyone?


I just transferred a wee heavy to the secondary and noted that I have
failed to the high FG I wanted. The OG was lower than expected due to a
disasterous sparge, around 1.059. I mashed using steps 30 mins `at` 40C, 20
mins `at` 60C and 50 mins `at` 70C. I expected to get an FG of around 1.020 but
when racking it was 1.012 !! The wort was pitched with the dregs from a
batch of Berghem Beamish fermented with WYeast #1084 Irish Ale. Even though
pitching rate was very high and lag time short, I thought that the long
rest at 70C would give a lot of unfermentable sugars. Not so! Next time I
will try a single-step mash at around 69C.


The beer was also fruitier than expected. It was fermented at 18C (measured
in the beer), but apparently I should have tried to lower the temperature
further.
Maybe the WYeast scottish ale would be a good idea too.

Can anyone explain why you would want to use Argon for beer?
Here in Montreal, there was a gas company selling what they called
"BeerGas" and I was told that it was a Carbon Dioxide and Nitrogen mix.
Nobody ever mentioned Argon.
Also nobody ever mentioned the need for a different gauge or valve for use
with this "BeerGas".


Anyone have experience with either "BeerGas", CO2/N2O mix or CO2/Ar mix?

I've written a web page detailing the new 2-tier, converted half-barrel

about building a similar system, you might check out my document for some 
pointers.  


You can reach it through the Library section of The Brewery 
(http://alpha.rollanet.org) - it's called "A Two-Tier Converted Keg 
Brewing System" or you can go directly to it at 
http://www.sky.net/~martyt/2tier.html


The document is still being worked on but is nearly complete - I 
anticipate being done with it by mid-week.  If you find anything wrong 
with the document or have questions or comments, please let me know via 
e-mail.  I'm also interested in opinions regarding the time it takes to load
the document on 14.4K modem lines - I may need to reduce the number of

I should have been clearer in my post.  My recollection is that ideal 
grain bed depth is 1/2 of the smallest dimension (height or length) of 
the mash tun.  In the case of the round gott coolers this is about six 
inches (the 5gal and 10gal gott have diameters of 11.5" and 13" 
respectively).  Could someone look this up?  I am sure there is a 
reference to this in one of the more scientific brewing resources.

Hi,
Sorry if this has been posted and I missed it... I have barely been 
lurking with school and all...
I would like to know if there is a FAQ or Wyeast homepage to know what 
all the strains are of known origin. I am particularly interested in 
finding out which particular strains come from which English Brewers.
One of particular interest is Whiteshield yeast (Bass) . A friend from 
Burton-on-Trent raves about it.
Thanks,

Subject: arm in beer


I just brewed my second batch of beer and made a grave error. While the 
wort was cooling and before I pitched the yeast, a vital piece of 
equipment fell in the beer! Being very tired, annoyed, and panicked I 
shoved my unsanitized arm into the wort to retrieve the object. I know 
this is about the worst thing one can do. My question is: do you think my 
beer is definitely ruined? I have it in the primary now and it is 
fermenting, but will the beer have some horrid flavor? Should I dump it?


Also, I use BTF (iodophor solution) to sanitize equipment. Should I allow 
everything to air dry without rinsing?

All I can say is that in the time I spent touring Scotland and England last
summer, I found this "fallacy" to be based in *general* fact.  Sure there
were exceptions but by and large the smaller "local" brews in Scotland were
sweet and mild while the English beers were stronger and more bitter.  One
could argue that the larger "national" brands were fairly similar to each
other in style; when we were able to find unique "house brands" (mostly in
"real ale" pubs), I'd say it was more than a generalization.  Perhaps the
WATER CHEMISTRY is coming into play here...(uh oh)...

     Hello all,
This is my first post so please be gentle.  I've been recieving the HBD for
about 1 month and have enjoyed the info. here very much.  Lot'sa big
brains(and heads?). I hope I'm not walking on trodden ground, but I would
like the collective's opinion on two of my brewing processes.


1.  I always rack to a secondary after initial activity has subsided, but I
recently read in the all-grain issue of Zymurgy in an article by Dr. George
Fix that many of us rack to secondary much to early (before fermentation
has stoped).  It separates yeast and wort at a time when yeast are in a
diacetyl reduction mode.  My question is this:  Is a secondary really
needed?  Is the quality of the finished beer that much higher or just
enough that only Micheal Jackson could tell the difference?


2.  After boiling my wort, I put my immersion chiller in the brewpot until
chilled ( about 20 min.), whirpool, then rack to primary.  Question:
Should I rack before I chill to remove the hot break and cold break
seperately?  Allmost all posting I've seen do this but not for this
specific reason.  Just wondering.


Ya'll have a good one.

Just thought I'd run one past the collective...


My SO just gave me a couple of 6 1/2 gallon glass carboys.  I've been using
only plastic for many years, and I was wondering about a few things...


1) Is a wine thief the only way to get samples (for SG checks, etc.) out of
the carboy?  Do they make one long enough for a 6 1/2 gallon carboy?


2) Has any one made weizzen with only 1 1/2 gallons of head space?  Won't
you need a blow-off tube?


3) Even tho I have a wort chiller, I'm asking this for a friend who also has
one...  Wouldn't syphoning hot wort into the carboy create HSA?  If so, how
do you avoid this?

In a past digest, someone suggested reusing iodophor in kegs.  It works this
way;  1) clean out a keg and fill it with an iodophor solution.  Keep it
until next time to keg.  2) When kegging day comes, clean out another keg
and transfer the solution from the old one to the new one.  3) Rinse the old
keg and fill normally.  Then keep the new one filled until next time.


I've sanitized 3 kegs this way with no loss of color or iodine odor from the
solution.  What a great way to maximize the value of your Iodophor.  It also
makes kegging day easy and fast.  Thanks HBD!

Don't get the wrong impression, I never suggested "using only maltose as a
yeast starter". Someone asked if there was a reason NOT to use glucose and I
gave one. Other fermentable sugars work also, including glucose and sucrose,
but the results might not be as good as if one had used malt extract.
Growing your yeast on maltose wouldn't be much better than using another
pure sugar solution lacking nutrients (particularly nitrogen). Malt EXTRACT,
OTOH, contains nutrients in addition to the sugar, and generally resembles
the composition of wort.

Well everyone, 


Since I got not one response with this posting last time, I am going to post
it again.


I have been running my tap with a 70/30 Nitrogen/Co2 mix for quite some time
(yes it is amazing) and everything works great. However, when I bottle with
this mix I get a so-so carbonation with little or no head (head is good- heh
heh heh). This is even after the beer has been fully carbonated and aged. 


I am bottling it under the same counter-pressure regime as when I bottle
with just a Co2 mix and the beer is carbonated perfectly from the tap with
th 70/30 mix.


Has anyone on the Digest bottled with this mix? Anybody have any pointers? 


Private email is welcome.

Hi Mike!


I just made a pilsner using the partial mash recipe for the Heineken
type in Papazians TNCJOHB.


I also used Wyeast's Bohemian yeast and my final gravity was 1.020.  I
thought I had screwed up my mashing part of the brew (my first partial
mash) by having too many unfermetables due to improper mashing
temperatures (boy, what an understatement), but you give me
encouragement. Maybe my mashing was perfect (ROTFLWP) , and it was the
yeast that caused the problem.


Anyway, I went ahead and bottled. After 1 week the beer was sweet and
flat. It's now been almost 4 weeks, I popped one open the other night,
it's drier and lightly carbonated. It doesn't appear to be a candidate
for grenades, but lager yeasts do take longer to carbonate than ales
(I did a 1 week primary `at` 55 degrees, followed by 4 weeks lagering `at`
~42 degrees, fermentation had mostly finished 4 days after pitching a
500ml starter ). 


Well, I guess we both will just have to monitor the carbonation as the
beer matures, and drink this batch right away :-)) if it starts to get
too fizzy.


Good luck, and let me know if any of the bottles go BOOM!

The Wyeast Bohemian is my pet hate yeast! Here are my notes for a batch I
used it in:


"#2124 Bohemian Lager from Wyeast: I don't know if this strain is supposed
to be this bad a fermenter. It started after bubbling in the air-lock after
12 hrs but then it took over a month (no speeding-tickets here!) to go from
OG1055 to 1017 (at 12 deg C) and even that is considered a high final
gravity!


Day 3: Nice white head without "hills and valleys" but some randomly spread
"islands" (about 1/2 cm)
Day 4: As day 3 but thicker (2 cm).
Day 6: A "looser" head. Bigger bubbles.


Attenuation: 69%
Temp.: 6-12 deg C
Use: No, unless you read something else somewhere else
Flocculation: OK


<end of notes>


I don't think I can help in any way but warn people of this strain. I used
it in a Czech pils which was awful! Since I'm now not the only one that had
problems with this strain I know I did nothing wrong. I'll never try it
again.

Yield is the increase in specific gravity you obtain from mashing
grain.  Since much of the increase is due to sugars released from the
starch of the barley (or whatever), it is a measure of how well this
conversion has gone and a also gauge to help you plan your next
recipe.


The units are the points ((SG-1)*1000) contributed by one pound of
grain to one gallon of water.  For example, 33 pts per pound is
usually considered to be a good figure.  If you mashed 10 pounds
of grain in 5 gallons of water and your SG was 1.066, you got 33
pts-gallons-per pound.

each arm is a 45 degree elbow, soldered on so that it is lifted from
the horizontal 45 degrees as well.  Even feeding the single input pipe
with water from the tap at 100psi, the outflow of all 6 pipes is
extremely gentle.


Be sure to have enough mash water in your system so that the manifold
is completely submerged.  For me, this is 1.1 qt./lb. grain plus a
constant 2 quarts (for the heater chamber, pump and hose volumes).

One of THE major benefits of a RIMS system is that the grain bed
temperature is very even due to the recirculation.  First, stirring is
not necessary, but more important, stirring will mess up the natural
filter bed and you will lose the clarity of your wort, which is
another big feature of a RIMS.  Don't do it, no matter how deep your
grain bed is, you should not have temperature variations.  I am about
to do a mash during which I will actually use a 36" BruProbe to test
the grain bed evenness of heating.  If there are any significant
uneven temperatures noted, I will surely post a retraction of the
above.

There has been a change in the location of the 1996
Brewers of South Suburbia competition.  It will still
be held on March 23rd, 1996 in the southwest suburbs
of Chicago, but the brewpub at which the judging was
to take place will not be able to accommodate us on
that date.  For more information please contact


Marty Nachel at 708-614-6258  or aleconner`at`aol.com


Please don't email me for info -- this is all the 
information I have.


Al.
