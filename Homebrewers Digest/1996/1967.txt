Just a clarification here:  N2O (nitrous oxide) is laughing gas and is
generally not sold to the public (hence the raised eyebrow).  N2 is nitrogen
gas - it is useful in serving kegged beer because it creates a great
'whippped cream' head with many tight, small bubbles.  Nitrogen gas does not
contribute to carbonation so it is ideal for pushing stouts from kegs where
a great head and low carbonation are desirable.  I think that bars that
serve Guinees with nitrogen are generally using a bottle of mixed gas (CO2
and N2).  I am not sure what N2O would do to beer, but it sounds interesting
 - has anyone tried?


A question:  I just tried out my new lauter tun.  I am happy with the
results - at least 33 pts.  But I did not end up with a 'flour' layer on the
top of the spent grains as I did with my old lauter tun.  I think this may
be due to not having enough sparge water covering the bed while sparging.
What do you all think?  Do you usually end up with a stratified layer of
fine grayish gunk on top of the grain?  Is this desirable?  What may I have
done this time that prevented its formation?

Subject: ? on grain


To the collective wisdom:


I have taken the plunge and done a few partial mashes and recently a couple of
all grain batches.  I've been reading a lot on the subject (Charlie P's new
book, Dave Miller's 1st book, the Zymurgy grain issue) and I need
clarification on something:


What (if any) is the difference between pale malt and lager malt?


Are we talking about different applications for the same grain, or is there a
difference between the malt used to make ales and the malt used to make
lagers?  The Zymurgy issue goes into a lot of detail to discuss the the
variety of grains that can be used, and talks a good deal about the specialty
malts, but no real discussion on pale malt vs. lager malt.
Can someone clear up my confusion???
Thanks

Subject: Potluck Ale


A couple of weeks batch I started making a batch of beer without taking
inventory first.  Well, to make a long story short, the beer was pretty
good.  Kinda smooth, without the stronger tastes I prefer, but a crowd
pleaser.  Here's the recipe:


Potluck Ale  (Chris Strickland's Leftovers)


4.5 lbs Klages
1.25 lbs 60lv Crystal Malt
5.25 lbs Rice
1.5 lbs LME (all of my starter wort)
1 lb clover honey
2nd generation American Ale Yeast
1 Tbs Gypsum
1/2 tps Irish Moss
3 oz Saaz (Only had finishing hops)


I ground up the klages and rice in my grainmill.


Used Gypsum in my mash water.


Mashed according to standard procedures.


Boiled until hot break finished.
 1hr 
         Added the 1.5 lbs of LME (would have rather used grain, but this is
potluck).
         Added 1oz Saaz (Why not, mild hop's taste).
         Put Irish Moss in hot tap water.
30 minutes
         Added 1oz Saaz
15 minutes
         Added Irish Moss
         Added Honey
5 minutes
        Added 1 oz Saaz


Let cool in sink (with hops in wort) for about 45 minutes ~90F


Poured in carboy with 2nd generation American Ale yeast.


Fermented two weeks,
Racked, in new carboy
Let sit two weeks, then bottled with standard 3/4's cup corn sugar (boiled
in water).

Subject: 2 questions: fast carbonation, and yeast harvesting


fast carbonation:
i usually keg, but this batch went into bottles. i used 4lbs of malt syrup,
1/3quart of honey, and 1/2lb. carmelized brown sugar in about 3 gal. of
water for an OG of 1.07.  after a week in an open fermenter the SG was 1.02.
after a week in an open secondary, it was still 1.02. i added about 2.5 oz
corn sugar and bottled. that was sunday night. this is wednessday and there
is already noticible pressure in the bottles. gently pouring a bottle
results in 3/8 inch of head. it tastes ok already, with a noticible fruit
taste (like the wild honey had). why is the carbonation there so quickly? i
expect i will end up with some beer bombs, but why?


yeast harvesting:
the reason i didn't use the keg for my "porter" is i have a lager in the
fridge which will be done before too long. am i better off harvesting the
yeast from the bottom of the primary or the bottom of the secondary, and why?


thanks for any help

 In HOMEBREW Digest #1965 Denis Barsalo asks:

For the same reason one would use nitrogen: It is poorly soluble in water.


Even though argon is a rare gas, it is relatively cheap because it is a 
by-product of the preparation of liquid air.


> Also nobody ever mentioned the need for a different gauge or valve for use

Nitrogen is under much higher pressure than CO2, so unless it is 
compressed only to CO2 pressure, which would not make much sense, it 
would require a nitrogen valve.

Subject: Vessel to expand yeast starters


Found a cheap container for expanding liquid yeast starters to large
volumes: the 3 liter bottle that Gallo Livingston Cellars Blush Chablis(tm)
comes in. This bottle seems to be very thick-walled and quite durable.
There's a large lip below the threaded portion that makes the container easy
to handle. The metal-lined plastic cap is readily modified to accept an
airlock: drill an appropriate sized hole in the cap and insert a grommet to
accomodate the airlock stem. Sanitize bottle, cap, grommet, etc in 12.5
iodophor. Iodophor is probably better for this metal-lined cap than bleach.
Or you could just modify a plain plastic cap that doesn't have the metal liner.


The two most important things I've learned about improving my beer are: use
a hell of a lot of yeast and aerate the bejesus out of the wort at pitching.


Have your wife drink the chablis.

A wine thief? Doesn't sound like anyone I'd like in _my_ house!


One poster before suggested using a 60 cc syringe and a catheter.
Sounds pretty easy, if you can get the stuff. Here's my method. I
have posted on it before, and am still satisfied with it.


Materials: a small plastic or glass container with a tightly
sealable lid, 100 cm aquarium aeration hose (ca 5 mm), and
silicone sealant. Cut off 10 cm of the aquarium hose. Drill two
holes in the lid and insert the 10 cm hose in one hole and the
rest in the other hole. Seal with silicone. (Sorry, no ASCII art.)


To use: Place lid, tightly sealed, on the plastic/glass container.
Sanitize the long aquarium hose. Remove the airlock from the
carboy. Stick the long hose down into the wort. Position the
container lower than the level of wort in the carboy and suck on
the short hose until a siphon is achieved. Allow the container to
fill up until you have enough wort for an s.g. test. Remove hose
from wort and replace airlock.

P.S. Jep, as they spell it here, I'm no longer "a transplanted
Yankee in Trosa, Sweden." The copious amounts of homebrew, mead,
and Belgian booty came through the move OK in the van, both with
respect to the cold (not frozen) and customs (not detected). This
country's amazing beer culture is worth a posting later. I'll give
you a hint--one of the most interesting beers available in the
local stores where I live, really 30 km outside of Oslo, is Miller
Genuine Draft. That goes for US$4.50 per 33 cl/11 oz bottle. Makes
the domestic swill look inexpensive at US$2 per bottle!


There is another side of it, I hasten to add, before Oeystein and

I've been doing overnight mashes for a couple of years now. I can't tell ya

That's correct, if the CaCl2 you use is free from water.


Chemical companies offer calcium chloride in several forms. Aside from its
plain form (without crystalline water), it is obtainable as dihydrate (with
two molecules of water for each molecule of CaCl2), as tetrahydrate (with
four H2O) and hexahydrate (with six H2O). This means that if you use a
hydrated form, the Ca and Cl don't add up to 100 %. For instance, the
dihydrate contains 27.3% calcium and 48.2% chloride, the rest being water.


This table, simply calculated from the atomic weights of the elements
involved, shows the amount of ions in milligrams released from one gram of
the various forms of the salt.


                      | Ca2+ | Cl-
        --------------|------|----
        CaCl2         | 361  | 639
        CaCl2 * 2H2O  | 273  | 482
        CaCl2 * 4H2O  | 219  | 387
        CaCl2 * 6H2O  | 183  | 324


Just divide by the number of liters of water you treat, and you get the
contribution in mg/l (or ppm, which is basically the same thing) from each
gram of the form of calcium chloride you are using.


The problem with "pure" CaCl2 is that it is hygroscopic; it attracts water
from the humidity of the air. So when you weigh up your 5 grams of salt,
you risk getting (5-x) grams of salt and x grams of water. What's worse,
you don't know what x is!


So, if you like being in control, you're probably better off with hydrated
calcium chloride, which contains a known amount of water. I myself use and
like the dihydrate. (I started out with the hexahydrate, but it was just
too wet and sticky. It has a melting point only slightly above room
temperature, and once melted, it seems to go into solution in its own
crystalline water.)


I agree with Miller and others that the taste qualities of calcium chloride
are preferable to those of calcium sulphate (gypsum) for most beer styles.
But if you brew a pale ale, and want that "Burton flavour", you need the
sulphate.

enough bottles in one wash to take a 5gal batch, with some bottles left
over. Again, I've never had a bottle break in washing, or any problems with
the beer that was bottled in them. Occasionally, a rubber gasket may come
loose from the grolsch style bottle, but I usually find it in the drain
strainer.

All this slagging of Wyeast Bohemian makes me feel a lot better.  The worst

DME -- high unfermentables with a low attenuating yeast.  Frustration
doesn't get much more complete.

 ...and he goes on about mini-kegs, about which, as I have no experience with
these, I'll defer discussion to someone else (there have been several
postings on this topic; no shortage of info).


But I will give one brewer's spin on kegging.  I enthusiastically jumped in
last summer with 6 used kegs, a 20# CO2 tank, and a $35 regulator. I swindled
a dear friend into fixing a "dead" refrigerator (cost me a few dusty old
Miller Lites), and installed two taps.  So I have a nice
draw-it-when-you-need-it setup.


Almost immediately I noticed that bringing beer to club meetings, giving away
bottles, and just letting brew sit long enough to age properly became
difficult/impossible.  Sure, there's Frankenbrau and counterpressure and all
that but it seems bottling a dozen homebrews from a keg is more hassle than
bottling four dozen out of the secondary ever was.


But on the it's great having easy, no-sediment access to one's handywork.  I
can have a small shot of homebrew after work without having to open a whole
bottle (or remember to refrigerate one in the first place), and when friends
come over, it's "help yourself" time.


So neither kegging nor bottling is perfect and there are major pro's and
con's both ways.  So here's my "solution":


Kegiing has become my packaging method of choice for "first-time" recipes and
my "house beers".  These are largely brews which don't need a long aging
period (light to medium ales, mostly), or other styles of which perhaps I
have some bottled versions 
stashed away.  Once I find a recipe I really like, or if I brew say a strong
ale, I'll bottle it.  This kind of approach gives you the best of both
worlds, in essence.


Bottom line (and I know I'll get argument here):  Don't rely on kegging to
solve all your packaging hassles.  Strike a balance and you'll be better off.

If you can wait a month ot two, just write to the Boston Beer Co.
(address for brewery on the label!) and ask them for some hops.
I did this, and a few weeks later, got a form letter asking for $12
for a pound of their Hallertauer Mittelfrueh hops.  With no further
action on my part, about a month later I got 400g of hops in a

cloning SA Boston Lager, using THEIR hops would be the best
way to go.  So send those letters!

Subject: Celis Tale


The story I get about the Celis rollback goes like this: When Miller bought
Celis they found that many of the distributors handling Celis were not
Miller brand houses. They want all their beers in Miller houses. By pulling
Celis out of a state, the contract with distributors can be cancelled. When
Celis comes back you will see it handled by a Miller house.


The Leinenkugel brand has had similar problems in Minnesota. Strict laws
protect distributors against breweries pulling their beer. When Miller took
over Leinie's they tried to put all the new specialty beers (Red, Autumn
Gold, etc.) in Miller houses. A messy lawsuit followed with the
distributors coming out on top. I suspect the end of the story is still not
at hand.


As someone else mentioned, brewery capacity is also a factor.

I was waiting for someone else to respond...but since no one has....


A mixture of CO2 with any inert gas is typically called "al eh gal" 
(phonetic spelling).  Aligal can mixed in almost any ratio of CO2
with an inert gas.  Typical is 12-40% inert gas.  This gas can be
Nitrogen (cheapest), Argon (more expensive) or something as wierd
as Helium...the idea is that it must be inert...non-reacting with
your beverage.  The usual use of inert gas is for the Guiness Style
stouts where you are trying to hold the foaming to a moderate level.


Excessive foaming is as undesirable as no head retition.  So if you
are commercial, the easiest way and cheapest is to add Nitrogen to
your driving gas.


You do not need a special regulator or equipment...just more money.
The fill stations will have a seperate tank that they make your mix
in and then do a normal transfer to your CO2 tank.  They do indeed
charge for the labor of mixing, the extra tanks, etc etc.  


For the typical home brewer is is not a desirable situation.  We have
enough problems keeping the caronation right without adding the
calculations for an inert percentage of gas.  Trying to adjust/calculate 
your percent of CO2 vs temp  vs style is already a challenge for most 
people.


If you want to experiment...do it with a beer that you are having
unreasonable foaming problems with already...you could be pleasantly
suprised...instead of having a flat Bitter.


No this will not help with foaming problems with your counter pressure
filler...(actual it will look like it but you will end up with flat
beer).  Someone elses suggestion here about chilling the entire setup
including the bottles has helped me considerably...Thanx whoever that
was, sorry I forgot your name...:-}

I did not ask directly, "Is Wyeast #1388 Duvel?" 
I asked for the origin of Wyeast #1388. He replied "Duvel."
Similar one word responses were received for other strains.
The only one that he used the words "might be" in describing
was Young's #1388. There were other yeasts in which he was not so
forthcoming. He said if the brewery did not want to be identified he
respected their wishes.
I don't think Dave has any motivation to lie about the origin of 
his yeast if the brewery of origin doesn't care.
Why don't you call him yourself and see if he gives the same answers
twice? Now that might be interesting and shed some light ...

Subject: Quiet Yeast (help a beginner)


Hi Y'all
        The discussions here on the HBD are quite interesting, and
everyone sounds quite knowledgeable.  I therefore hope that someone can
answer my question.
        I am in the midst of brewing my first batch, a barleywine
(beginner's ambition), which went through an initial fermentation on Edme
Ale Yeast with no problem, reducing from 1.110 to 1.048 s.g.  Now the
recipe calls for a second fermentation with champagne yeast.  I hydrated
the yeast at 104 degrees as indicated on the package, then pitched it into
my wort once it had cooled to room temperature (about 65).  By the next
morning, there was about one bubble every ten minutes out of my blow-by
but the next day there didn't seem to be anything going on.
        I suspect that the temperature is too cool for the yeast,
especially because I realized there is a draft in the corner where I had
the carboy.  I have now moved it next to the stove (warmest place in my
apt), away from the draft, and insulated it by placing it on newspaper and
wrapping it in a towel.  Can I expect fermentation to pick up with these
measures, or is there something else I should do?
        Thanks.

Special B is a trade name of De Wolf-Cosyns of Belgium for an extremely 
dark  "crystal"  (or caramel) malted barley.  I don't think the Lovibond is 100,
I think they list it at 180-190.  If your brew shop said it was 100, they either
were guessing, just trying to make a sale, or it wasn't true "Special B".  Most
'conventional' crystal malts I've seen top out at 140 deg. L max.   "Special
B" is like the missing link between crystal and chocolate malt.


6% of Special B is quite a bit to use;  generally 2-4% (4 oz /5 gal) imparts a
strong toffee-like flavor and DEEP red-brown color.  Potent (but good) stuff!
You might have gotten the color you wanted with about half the amount you
used, but it is pretty dark none the less.  Remember, 1 part Special B will
color about the same as 2 parts 100L crystal, but the taste will be VERY
different!

   [Nice description of how to make brass weights from brass rod deleted]


Another option is to use a combination of coins.  I weighed out an
assortment of coins (U.S. pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters) on a
fairly sensitive scale (accurate to 0.01 gram) and got the following
average masses (or weights, if you prefer):


      penny = 2.67 gram (average of 7 coins)
     nickel = 5.01 gram (average of 7 coins)
       dime = 2.28 gram (average of 4 coins)
    quarter = 5.66 gram (average of 8 coins)


Except for one badly-behaved penny with a mass of 3.08 gram, none of the
coins' masses varied from the corresponding average value by more than
0.07 gram.


By playing around with various combinations of coins, I came up with the
following:


      0.2550 oz = 1 penny + 2 dimes
      0.4984 oz = 1 nickel + 4 dimes
      0.9982 oz = 5 quarters
      1.9964 oz = 10 quarters


As you can see, these combinations of coins are good approximations for
1/4 oz, 1/2 oz, 1 oz, and 2 oz, respectively.


Here are the worst-case errors one could get using the above combinations,
assuming a 0.07 gram error per coin and using Ken's approximation 1 hop
pellet = 0.24 gram:


      1/4 oz:  3 coins * 0.07 gram/coin = 0.21 gram = 0.9 hop pellet
      1/2 oz:  5 coins * 0.07 gram/coin = 0.35 gram = 1.5 hop pellet
        1 oz:  5 coins * 0.07 gram/coin = 0.35 gram = 1.5 hop pellet
        2 oz: 10 coins * 0.07 gram/coin = 0.70 gram = 2.9 hop pellet


For statistical reasons, the errors are likely to be significantly less
than these worst-case values.

Recall that I suggested that interested parties checked Roger Protz's
Real Ale Drinker's Almanac, Issue 3 (issue 2 doesn't have the BUs listed).
I did this because far more HBD readers could access this than travel to
Britain.  My initial impression that Scottish Ales and English Bitters
are far less different than the AHA and most books say is from personal
experience tasting my way from Edinburgh to London via the Lake District,
Burton-on-Trent, Wales, Southampton and Kent over the course of three
weeks, two summers ago.  A couple of days at the Great British Beer Festival
helped me taste perhaps 50 more ales from Eastern and Far Western England.
After critically tasting more than 150 Scottish, Welsh and English Ales (a
very small percentage of them being National brands, incidentally), I would
have to say that you simply cannot generalize that Scottish Ales are maltier
and English Bitters are more bitter.  Please check Protz's book and see if
at least Roger's figures and tasting notes don't support my contention.

The particle settling is independent of the area of the grain bed and the
distribution of the particles is *not* at all compleat (large-then-medium-then-
small).  The physics simply don't work that way.  Consider this: let's say
that the commercial brewery has an 18-inch grain bed that's round and 25 feet
in diameter.  Assuming that we're talking about an infusion mash (i.e. no use
of rakes), you could put metal dividers into the mash (like the cardboard ones
in a cardboard wine box) so that each would contain 10 pounds of grain, right?
We then put an equal amount of sparge water into each "cell" and take runnings.
What we have at home is simply one of those "cells" that contains 10 pounds
of grain.  It's still 18 inches deep, right?


Now, let's discuss what "ideal" means.  To the commercial brewer, it probably
means that more depth would mean that it would be too difficult to draw the
runnings and more chance of a set mash.  Less depth would probably mean too
much channelling and therefore inefficient sugar extraction.  The too-deep
problem is one that we must contend with also, but the too-shallow one is
probably a matter of three or four points-per-pound-per-gallon.  To us the
difference between 32 ppg and 28 ppg is not a big deal.  To a pro it's $$$$$.


So, a *practical* grain bed depth to us is somewhere between 6 inches and 18
inches.  In a gummy mash (lots of rye, oats, wheat or glucans in general)
an 18-inch grain bed would probably be equivalent to damp cement (someday
I'll tell you about my 3-hour lauter of my 43% rye malt ale), but for standard,
all-barley malt mashes, it's not as critical as you might think.

Actually, I would say it's about a draw.  The standard first experiment
they teach you in microbiology courses is to pour two plates -- in one
you spit and in the other you put a thumbprint.  Guess what?  The thumbprint
one usually grows a lot more stuff than the salivaprint!  Amazing but true...


Jeff is right though about using your tastebuds -- if you pitch enough
healthy, active yeast, you can be *all* thumbs and still brew prize-winning
beer.  The odds that a homebrewed wort will be 100% sterile are 1 in a
billion, probably, but as long as you outnumber the nasties with yeast,
the beer will be in your tummy long before the nasties have a chance to
make a noticable contribution.


When I was in Britain two summers ago, it was one of the hottest summers
in recent memory.  I distinctly recall that all the windows were open at
the breweries and there were large fans blowing air into the fermentation
rooms just so the workers wouldn't pass out from the heat.  The vision of
outside air blowing with great force across the tops of the open fermenters
at Caledonian and Young's breweries is still fresh in my mind.


There's safety in numbers!

1. I am moving my brewing to my basement and am considering various options for 
heat sources.  I have seen Electric BREWCO Mash/Tun advertised and it looks
like it might
do the job.. Does anyone have any experience with it?  I'm particularly
concerned
whether it can handle 10-13lbs of grain.  As always any help/advice would be
appreciated.




2. Thanks

First, thanks to everyone who responded to "understanding Yield" 
I'm doing my 3rd batch of all grain this weekend and so far all I've 
done is the basic single temperature mash. I have no problem
 keeping good control of thetemp so any advice would be helpful. 
Should I stick with the 150 to 158 deg, or
do something different.
Here's the recipe, for the Bock Beer I'm making.


10 lbs Helles 2 row.
1.5  lbs crystal
1.0 lbs Munich        
 .25 lbs chocalate


2 oz hallertau bittering
1 oz hallertau finishing


Wyeast Munich Lager
