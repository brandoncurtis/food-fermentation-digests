Hello brewers!


Last Sunday (18 Feb) I brewed an American Pale Ale.  I used 6 lbs. Light DME
as well as some steeped specialty grains.  For a 5 gal batch, this should
have yielded a SG of approximately 1.050 (Assuming 1.042 for the DME).  After
it was in the fermenter I took a SG reading and it was 1.026! (It also tasted
incredibly bitter, which I think would make sense if the SG was half of what
I was shooting for.)  After a little contemplation that night I decided that
first thing in the morning I would  boil up some more DME,  put it in another
fermenter, and rack as much as I could out of the first fermenter into the
new one. Since I got half of what I wanted the first time, I used another 6
lbs. DME with 1 gal of water (as little water as I thought would work) the
second time.  Everything went well and I got most of the first batch into the
second fermenter (as well as a *really* clear wort because of all the trub
that settled overnight).  I took another reading and the SG was 1.080!  I
could see it being a little higher than the 1.050 I was origanally hoping
for, but not that high.  It has been fermenting very well throughout the
week, and I will rack to the secondary sometime this week.  Where did I mess
up?  Do you think this will turn out to be O.K. even though not exactly what
I was hoping for?


My second issue involves the water analysis I received.  Here is what I have:
pH: 7.3 - 7.7;  Hardness: 480 mg/l as CaC03; SO4: 10 ppm; Cl: 6 ppm; Na: 4.69
ppm.
I had also requested info on Ca, Mg, C03, and 2(HCO3), but they left that
blank.  I have read the section on water in both of C. Papazian's books, and
am still a little confused about what the results mean for me.  I plan to
stick to extracts with specialty grains for the near future (I will probably
be moving before I jump into any mashing), so do I need to worry that much
about my extra hard water.  I do use an activated charcoal filter for all my
brewing water, but do I need to do more?  Will using better water improve my
beer that much (both in taste and other qualities such as head retention)?


TIA for the help.  I feel very fortunate to have access to the wealth of
knowledge and experience that I have found in the HBD.

Subject: Questions on Zymurgy CF chiller test


Could someone help me understand the test results from Zymurgy's counterflow
wort chiller evaluation?  Perhaps I don't know what the authors mean by *Time To
Cool 5 Gal* of wort.  To me this implies the time it takes for 5 gal of wort to
gravitate through the inside copper tube.  If so, then why does it takes 20+ min
to go through 25' of 3/8 OD tubing but only 12+ to traverse 50'?  Are not the
Brewers Resource model and the 25' Listermann model identical except for the
garden hose?  Then how come the wort flow is 19.7 gal/hr for the former but 14.9
gal/hr for the latter?  I was a little suprised to note that the extra 25' of
tubing in the second Listermann chiller only dropped the wort temp by one
additional degree to 64F even though the coolent temperature is 52F.  Finally,
is the key to CF design a large diameter inner tube as in the Heart's chiller?
I was pleased to see this comparision as my current CF chiller is about shot and
I am in the market to buy/make a new one.  But this article left me a little
confused.

Subject: re: funky bock


     In HBD 1968, Maxwell McDaniel asks about improving a kit based on LME 
     for a bock.  The worst beers I ever made were kits obtained from 
     England by a coworker on a trip he made over there.  They were a Gordie 
     Gold Medal Bitter and a Gordie Mild.  I was trying to remain true to 
     the styles assuming that the kits were as advertised.  Therefore, I 
     made approximately 3 gal/batch rather than 5 gal and have to add the 
     recommended table sugar.  I questioned the viability of the yeasts 
     provided, so I used a nottingham dry yeast for each following the usual 
     procedures.  The "Gold Medal" kit contained a packet of hops which was 
     also suspect.  Therefore, hopped it with an oz of fuggles (1/2 at the 
     begin of the boil and 1/2 with about 5 minutes left).  Both beers 
     turned out nearly black in color and excessively bitter almost burnt 
     tasting.  I was embarrased, but glad to give away most of the batches 
     to the guy who asked me to make them.  (I did later give him some good 
     ESB made from extract & grains to protect my reputation) When I 
     examined the label on the LME cans, the 2nd ingredient was carmel.  
     That is what I suspect dominated the flavor and surely caused the dark 
     color.  I don't know if using corn sugar or corn syrup to make a 5 gal 
     batch would have been an improvement, but I doubt it.  It probably 
     wouldn't have been any worse though.  I found that blending them off 
     with domestic lite beer (kept in the fridge for some of my tasteless 
     friends, not for me) made them more drinkable.  I got the idea from 
     Black & Tans, but I'd rather have a real Black & Tan, anyday.
     
     Bottom Line: If carmel is a key ingredient, you may have to live with 
     the off flavor or find a way to dispose of it.  If you are determined 
     to consume it, try blending it off with something that will balance 
     out the flavor.  Take the advice for extract brewing offered earlier 
     in HBD, and if possible, brew w/ pale malt extract and use specialty 
     grains to achieve color and special taste objectives.  And consider 
     liquid yeast, especially when trying to achieve unusual styles.  Good 
     luck however it turns out!

Subject: ss pot/bleach temp/ESB recipe


<Mitch Hogg asks about upgrading from his enameled steel pot (HB1963).>


        I hemmed and hawed for a year about the cost of a quality SS pot. Just
like Mitch, my once-a-month all grain batches were taking a toll on my 
enameled pot. I recently bit my tongue (my wife bit hers too) and shelled out 
$160 for a Vollrath 38.5 quart stainless steel vessel (it's a "vessel" at that
price).  I love it and hope to pass it on to my children as a family heirloom.


<Mitch also inquired about the reason to use cold water, not hot, when mixing 
bleach.>


        I believe the primary reason is that hot water and bleach makes for 
more chlorine gas than mixing with cold water. I don't think there is a 
practical difference in terms of sanitizing effectiveness. But, what do I know
about science!?


Now MY question:


        I'm want to brew an Extra Special Bitter that tastes and smells like 
Deschutes' Bachelor Bitter and NOT like Red Hook's ESB. (What is that aroma I 
smell in the Red Hook variety?) I like the clean but fruity taste and the 
unmistakeable Kent Goldings hops flavor and aroma in the Bachelor Bitter.  I 
plan to use Wyeast #1968 `at` 62F, Hugh Baird 2-row, 8% 90L English Crystal, 5% 
Flaked Wheat, and 35 IBU's of Goldings hops. SG of about 1.044.  Any thoughts 
about this recipe and the taste profile I seek?

Subject: Special "B" is crystal??!!




        I could be corrected, but I read the post by (?) concerning the
use of special B and the comment was made that this was some sort of 
a special, high roast crystal malt.  This does not look to be the case
from my examination of this malt.  It appears to be some sort of high 
roast malt but I could not see any caramelization of the interiour of the
malt that would indicate a crystalization inside.  I chewed a several 
kernals and the perception is one of a drying roast, rather than a 
lusiousness (which would be perceived from crystal).  Has anyone seen
a spec. sheet on the production of this malt?


        I broke in half and chewed 20 odd kernals of DC caramunich and
it would seem to me that about half of these are caramelized and crystalized
malt (fairly high roast) and the other half appear to be some sort of 
high roast munich malt.  Does anyone know if this is a blended malt from
two different processes?


        BTW, the Special "B" I examined was Dewolf Cosyns.

"Keith Royster" <keith.royster`at`ponyexpress.com> posted in 1963:


>How do those of you with RIMS deliver the wort to the top of the grain bed
>gently and evenly?  


First try was a manifold made from about 4' of copper 3/8" tubing coiled
into a spiral.  The manifold had varing sized and spaced holes in an effort
to get both a uniform and a low velocity flow.  After much expermentation I
concluded it couldn't be done and used for both wort and sparge water
distribution as I'd hoped.  I was preparing to build another one from
perforated 1/2" copper pipe  
with a center feed nipple when I spied a 5 gallon poly pail and some
synapses fired in an unusual manner (IOW, a brain-fart).  I cut the pail
about 5" from the bottom except for 3 "ears" extending above it.  The bottom
was perforated with 90 uniformally spaced 3/32" holes.  I drilled out about
12 of the holes in the copper manifold to 3/16" and put it in the remains of
the pail.  The pail thing is hung from hooks made from 12 ga copper wire at
the top of the RIMS tun via chains fastened to the ears on the pail.  The
chains and hooks allow for easy adjustment of the height of the thing in the
tun and the ears hold it centered in the tun.  I haven't mashed with it yet,
but, holding it above the tun and observing the exit flow, it's very gentle
and very uniform.  I expect it will work well both for wort return and for
sparging.  At 2 GPM (as of now, my max flowrate) the fluid in the pail thing
is about 1/2" deep.  If you have the oft' recommended higher flowrate pump,
you may need larger or more holes in the thing.  At a sparge trickle, the
holes in the bottom of the copper manifold are just barely covered.  The
only potiential problem is that the rim at the bottom of the pail could trap
a bit of air if you don't put some holes there and don't jiggle the thing a
bit to ensure the air is bleed off.  Other than trying to find copper or SS
chain (I used brass but since it's not in the mash, I don't worry), the
thing is easy and cheap to build.

One of the advantages of the RIMS is that stirring isn't required except at
while doughing in!  Perhaps it's desirable if your tun isn't well insulated
or the flow through the bed isn't uniform but, you should deal with those
sorts of problems directly rather than by stirring.  With a good system you
*may* increase the extract a point or so.  IMHO, a few cents worth of
additional grain is a great bargin when compared with stirring! 


Once I get my 'puterized control fine-tuned, I plan on adding several
additional temp sensors to the tun.  I'll will report what I find; however,
like other variables, YMWillV.

Quite simply:  buy one approximately the same size as the primary
fermenter.


As you have noted, 5 US gallons is a pretty standard size for
recipes.  The primary fermenter should be somewhat larger than this
to allow for the vigorous production of kraeusen by the
fermenter.  The carboy, of 5 gal. size, can then be used secondary
fermentation, dry hopping, etc.


If you're not planning for the use of the carboy for these
purposes, don't buy one.

  Someone here recently asked about the project to recreate a Sumerian Beer.
One major contributors was Fritz Maytag.  


  There has apparently been a flurry of discussion of this on an ancient
near east mailing list.  A friend sent me a reference to an article on the
process.  Try:


    http://s-kanslia-3.hut.fi/SumerianBeer.html


 I suggest that you look at it, even if you aren't interested in Sumerian
beer, for the lovely and moving Sumerian "Hymn to Ninkasi".  One verse of
this hymn is quoted here: 


  When you pour out the filtered beer 
    of the collector vat,
  It is [like] the onrush of 
    Tigris and Euphrates.
  Ninkasi, you are the one who pours out the

Subject: malt/proteins


Charlie writes some good stuff about malts/protein:


<Also enzymic modification of the protein profile is dominated by malting,


This cannot be emphasized enough.  It is why I asked awhile ago what
types of malts are considered low in degree of modification and received
few good responses.  The bottom line is that the maltsters, for their
own benefits and not for brewers, are doing too much of the work of 
brewers.  Pro brewers must demand malt that meets the needs of the craft
brewer, and if that means one wants to make classic Bavarian lagers it
can be very difficult to find an adequate malt.




< If they step mash before going to bed they could produce up to 50% of their
<final Amino Acid content in their mash, but after 55C, very few increased
AA's


The bulk of the amino acid profile is also fixed by the maltster and not
by mashing techniques, although they play relatively minor role.


Lance Stronk babbles:


<Again, I understand that it is possible to blab away on the HBD but this is
garbage.  I am not the HBD police but, 


Piss off and scroll down for crissakes.  The post was just fine and 
fairly accurate.


And Rob says about domestic 2 row:


<As far as I'm concerned, the domestic 2-row malts out there are more like
<lager malt, because of the typically higher enzyme levels and the noticeable
<if not prodigious amount of DMS production during brewing.  Certainly, 
<brewers' techniques will affect the level of DMS in the final product, but
<I'm firmly rooted in the camp that English Style ales should not have DMS
<levels above flavor threshold.  As such I feel domestic malts are more suited
<for lagers, Belgian ales, Kolsch, and Alt.


In my experience I could wave a pot of 155F water over domestic 2 row 
and it would convert!  As for "better for non English ales", I would
point out that the vast majority of craft ales are produced with this
type of malt.  Many rave about the ales of Anchor, Sierra, etc and it
is domestic  2 row.   While a decent lager can be made with this malt,
a better lager can be made with the likes of malt from Bamberg.  I
dont feel that a traditional alt can be produced with domestic 2 row,
nor a clean Koelsch, it would be too grainy.

PET bottles are decidedly un-dishwasher safe.  I have several PET blobs
from sending them through the cycle.  Bleaching is enough. I've been
brewing for 7 years with them--sanitizing with bleach--and have never had a
problem.


I use two or three tablespoons of bleach per gallon of sanitizing water and
soak the bottles for ten minutes (same with the caps).  I then rinse them
and cap them lightly for bottling later.  Works dandy.


Cheers!

I have done this.  Purely subjective viewpoint - I think it produces
some minor differences in the beer.  I ended up with a beer that had
very fine bubbles and lots of carbonation and nice head retention.  How
much of that was due to the beer itself vs. how it was primed... well,
your guess is as good as mine.  It was a very fine beer though.


On a related topic, a while ago there was some discussion about canning
starters (I used to use one of my canned starters for "krausening" when
I did this).  Someone commented that they were worried about botulism in
a canned starter, which is why they didn't do this.  Well, just recently
I came across some really good info about botulism in a book on canning
and smoking fish.


Short answer:  there is no reason to be worried about botulism from
canned beer starters.


Long answer: Botulism is a toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium
Botulinum.  Simply boiling the wort kills any bacteria which might be
present, and also destroys the toxin.  And, from the "Health Protection
Branch, Botulism Reference Centre" at the Government of Canada --
"Canned fruits, jams and jellies, and pickles and relishes do not cause
botulism; high concentrations of acid, salt, or sugar prevent the growth
of botulinum bacteria".  I would guess that the heat of canning combined
with the fact that wort is basically sugary water is enough to deal with
those little botulism bacterias...

I picked up this book last year and after reading it I wasn't all that 
excited about it and sorry that I spent $20 for it.  I have found David 
Miller's new book much more interesting and a better use of my money.
For me TBC has about 20 pages of usefull information.  Much of it seems
to be targeted towards someone that doesn't have an online brewlog or
notebook. There are many pages dedicated to logging ones brew session.
There are some reference pages that can be usefull also, but not worth
the price.
All in all i wouldn't recommend it.

I don't think that increasing the volume of yeast will bring down the T.G.

I am having a very hard time responding to this post because it literaly
left me speechless.  Thankfully, it was a temporary condition.


First, John, this is a beer list.  I am not a beer snob but your recipe is
not for beer.  It appears to be a lightly flavored alcoholic solution, not
unlike Zima, though you do mention hops.  My guess is that its primary
function is the production of cheap, non-lethal, drunkedness.


If I understand your first line it means that you have been monitoring the
HBD for a week, and have missed its point entirely.  You are quite correct
in stating that there's not "much to help the average person who just
wants to make a batch of suds as simply as possible."  This is a list for
people who like to brew.  For people who enjoy the process and the
results.  Who strive for better beer, even better beer more simply, but
the operative adjective here is "better".  This list is the antithesis to
the cane sugar, molasses, and baker's yeast type beers of prohibition
of which yours is a modern example. 


You have been making this for twenty years with "considerable success".  I
am curious as to the definition of success in this case.

I live in San Fran. where the water is very soft and the pH is high (avg.
8.6).  I use a Brita filter and have observed the same effects as Mr. Pike.
 I recently tried boiling a sample and checking the pH:  Tap water pH was
7.6.  After Brita filtering it was 6.7.  After boiling and force chilling it
was 6.8.  When allowed to cool slowly, it went back to 7.6.


I was not aware that the Brita is more than a carbon filter.  Does it
completely remove all the ions (i.e. 0 ppm Ca, etc.)?  Also, I do not
understand what caused the pH to return to 7.6 when the water cooled.


Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.

I suggest bying two plastic buckets and skip the carboy! Plastic buckets
are cheap, durable and can be fitted with a tap (and "bubbler") for
instance. If you've followed the digest you can't have missed all the
stories about carboys cracking and people getting wort all over their
floors. They're heavier, more difficult to clean, fragile (dangerous if you
break them), they let light through, and, as you point out, are expensive
(compared to a plastic bucket anyway). I've been using plastic fermenters
for seven years now and don't regret for a minute that I got rid of my
glass carboy. The only reason I can see for using them is the fact that you
can see when the beer clears out.
One drawback with plastic buckets is that they get scratched over time if
you mistreat them but you would probably have dropped a couple of carboys
during that time.
I know all you carboy fans out there will try to convince me that they're
better but I'm not trying to create a battle similar to the Mac/PC-war
here, just give my opinions! BTW, welcome to a great hobby!

One warning / two recommendations: Guinness is oh so boooring! I went there
in 1985 (things might have changed but I doubt it) and it wasn't a brewery,
it was friggin factory! They took us on a "train"-tour on the outside to
see the pipes, the silos and the like and then we were shown a 45 min.
video shot inside the factory plus the standard beginners information on
what beer consists of and how it's brewed. After that it was in to the
sampling "room" (more of a giant restaurant) were we had a pint of
(excellent I must say) beer. The next group of people stood outside waiting
for their turn so we had to leave after half an hour.
I don't know if they're any better but I would try Beamish or Murphy's in
the southeast of Ireland (Cork) instead.
As for the recommendations, Fuller's of London is brilliant these days.
They used to charge you a fee of 2.5 GBP (which isn't bad) but they took
that away and opened up a souvenir shop with plenty of gear to drewl over.
The brewery tour is very good. You walk around in a small group (10-12
instead of the 50-60 at Guinness) and you can actually hear what the guide
is saying (if you can handle the British accent).
Young's is my favourite. It has a nice (almost homebrewery-) feel to it and
you walk around between the fermenters and you can grab a handful of yeast
if you dare ;-). It feels like you're really close to the brewing process
and everything. You also get to see the brewery stable and the famous ram.
Ask the guide to tell you the story about how they used to make a special
fishing-fly from the hair of the rams scrotum!

I brew AND I use a Mac.
I've never seen SUD's so I don't know what it can or can't do. I have found,
on the AOL brew forum, a piece of freeware called Brewer's Notebook that
pretty much suites my basic extract brewing needs. It is a small stand alone
application written by Tim Wiley. Some of the calculations include alcohol
content, apparent attenuation, specific gravity correction based on temp.,
hop utilization and IBU. There is also search capability for any field. Nice
thing is you can export a text file of any recipe, very convenient for
posting online for others, example:


Brew Name: 24 Black Silk
Category/Type: Coffee Stout
Date Brewed: 1-8-96
Date Bottled: 1-23
Original Gravity: 1.052
Final Gravity: 1.018
Batch Number: 25
Batch Size: 6 gal
Alcohol Content: 4.6%
Apparent Attenuation: 64%


Grains/Malt Extract: 
8 lb. Mountmellick stout kit
1/2 cup flaked barley
2 cups Quaker oats
1/2 cup black patent
1/4 cup chocolate malt


Hops: 
1/2 oz. Fuggles (60 min.)
1/2 oz. Fuggles (10 min.)


Special Ingredients: 
4 oz. unsweetened chocolate
1/4 lb. ground coffee of choice (Ghiradelli Chocolate Caramel this batch)


Yeast: Yeast Lab A05 Irish Ale (starter)


Brewing Procedure/Fermentation Log: 
Steeped grains and oats 30 min. `at` 140-145, then up to 155 for 10 min.
Add extract & 0.5 oz Fuggles, boil 50 min.
Add chocolate. 
With 5 min. to go add rest of Fuggles.
At 60 min., kill heat, add coffee and let it steep 20 min.
Pull coffee, cool, transfer to fermenter, top up with water.
Pitched starter `at` 74x. Shook like hell.
Bubbles in airlock within 12 hours.


Comments: 
Used bottled water.
Used nylon grain bags for grains, hops and coffee.
Racked to secondary 1-16, uumm tastes very fine.


Anyway, it works for me. I guess I could send it as an attachment to anyone
who's interested (I'm asking for it aren't I, or ARE there only 4 of us Mac
users).


Brew Well FWIW,

Excuse the bandwidth.


I'll be in Denver on March 5 and would like to know the best places to buy
bottled micros.  Especially interested in Doggie Style PA, Left Hand
Brewing, Avery, and Deschutes (from Oregon - Batchelor Bitter, Cascade
Golden).  Will be staying in the Tech Center area south of downtown just
off the interstate, but have a car so can drive further.


TIA,
