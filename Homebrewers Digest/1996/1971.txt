Subject: Stuck Fermentation


Dear Collective,
        First I want to thank everyone who reassured me that sticking my 
arm in my beer wasn't the worst thing to do. Now I have a new problem.
        I brewed a Harpoon Winter Warmer clone (from Cat's Meow). The OG 
was 1.061. Four days later the gravity was 1.039. Last night I transferred 
from the primary (it was in the primary for a week) to the secondary. 
The gravity was 1.036. 
There has been no activity in the fermentation lock over the last 
twenty-four 
hours. I do not know what the terminal gravity should be, but I know this 
is too high. I am assuming the stuck fermentation is due to the fact that 
I did not aerate the wort (this is only my second batch and I'm still 
catching on). I pitched a liquid Wyeast (British ale #1028). On my first 
batch the fermentation was also stuck so I added some priming sugar to 
the primary. This dropped the gravity very little, but left the beer with 
a very cidery taste. 
        Any suggestions for getting the fermentation going again? Is this 
actually no problem and the process is just EXTREMELY slow? 


Thanks in advance...Kevin...liquori`at`acc.fau.edu

A friend and I plan to give a presentation on hops to our homebrew club next

characteristics when used for bittering, flavor and aroma. We plan on using
hop tea's to do this. 


Has anyone done this with any success? If so, do you have a recipe for making
the tea's?


Private e-mail O.K. I'll post a summary.

Hello Everyone.


Can anyone give me a good reason to naturally carbonate beer in a corny keg
rather than simply force-carbonating it?  Does the method of carbonation
affect the character of the final product at all?


Also, I have a ~12oz starter of Wyeast London Ale that's been in my
refrigerator for around a month.  Is it worth saving, and if so, what would
be the best way to go about doing this?


Thoroughly enjoying this newsgroup,

You have demonstrated the law of conservation of mass-energy.  The
6 lbs. of light DME that you added at first did in fact remain in
the fermenter; the initial low OG reading may well have been due
to inadequate mixing (if you boiled a concentrated wort and diluted
it with water; that point isn't clear), misuse of the hydrometer,
or some cause that can't be diagnosed at the end of a modem.  Then,
when you added the second 6 lb. dose, the OG shot up to its final
incredible figure (which still sounds a little low; I'd expect it
to be in the 1.095 - 1.100 range.  Calibrate your hydrometer on
plain water).


Of course, the final result is not going to be, stylistically,
anything like a pale ale; it's going to be more like a barleywine
or an imperial stout (but probably won't be too close to those
either, since the rest of your ingredients are going to be
oriented towards a pale ale).  However, it ought to be eminently
drinkable anyway, and you may actually decide that you like it
better than the intended brew.


Moral:  measure carefully, mix thoroughly, and ensure that your
hydrometer is calibrated correctly.  If you still don't get the
right answer, assume that you did anyway.  Brewing is technology
and art, not science; it's perfectly alright to fudge the data if
that gives a better result.

Subject: Mash Questions




Dear Collective,


  First time poster, long time lurker.
 Forgive me for I have sinned. Over the weekend, due
to equipment problems, procedure problems, etc. 
I didn't relax, and I worried. I was making Charlie's
un-american recipe that calls for:
1 lbs rice
5 lbs 6 row-high enzyme.


After the prescribed mash schedule, I did
a starch test and noticed that all the starch was not
converted. I let it rest for another 15 minutes (at 158F)
and still all the starch had not converted. Another 15 minutes
and still nothing. I ASSuME that this was due to the
fact that I was using a 2-row instead of a 6-row?
What is the consensus?


Additionally, I have noticed that in my all grain batches
I get little or no hot break compared to my extract batches
which get plenty. Is there a reason for this?


Thanks for the support!!


  Bob

Subject: Water/Chillers/Special B/Water


In #1970 Steve asks about his water: "pH: 7.3 - 7.7;  Hardness: 480 mg/l as
CaC03; SO4: 10 ppm; Cl: 6 ppm; Na: 4.69 ppm." for extact brewing. Don't
worry.While that level of hardness is doubtless accompanied by about 400
ppm alkalinity (since chloride and sulfate are low) which is a lot there
should be no problem in extract brewing. I suppose there is a chance at
that level that the yeast might have a problem getting the pH of the
fermenting wort down as low as they like. This water is doubtless a
candidate for softening/dealkalinazation by boiling which should drop a
fair amount of the carbonate (and the calcium/magnesium too). The sulfate
is too low for english ales which require more for authentic hop character.


Steve also mentions that he uses a "charcoal" filter. As I have noted
before some of the small "charcoal"filters, such as the Brita, are charcoal
AND ion echange filters which remove not only chlorine but also most of the
ions in the water.


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


In the same number Mark Schmitt asked about interpretation of the wort
chiller comparisons in the latest Zymurgy. This is my opinion but I use the
Q number for comparison. If the chiller is provided a coolant flow greater
than or equal Q and the wort flow is less than Q/5 the wort will exit the
chiller within 3 degrees F of the coolant temperature for any wort entrance
temperature up to 212F. Thus I call the Q the "size" of the chiller. Thus I
think the Heart's chiller (I don't have the article in front of me) had a Q
near 100 and it will, thus, cool 20 gallons per hour to within 3 degrees of
the water temp if it is supplied 100 gph cooling water.


The reason for the development of the Q factor is that the actual
performace of a chiller is a function of coolant flow, wort flow rates,
coolant entry temp, and wort entry temperature, i.e. complex. There are
curves which plot allowable wort and coolant flow rates normalized by Q and
parametric in chiller efficiency. The Q; Q/5 point lepas off the page at
you. Performance increases only a little bit if the flow rate is increased
above Q. This means wasting more water for little benefit in chilling.
Similarly decreasing the wort flow doesn't improve things much, it takes
longer to cool a given volume, and, again, cooling water is wasted.
Conversely, dropping the coolant flow rate below Q or increasing the wort
flow rate above Q/5 will result in a sharp drop in performace (but there is
a little leeway). Thus the chiller should be operated at Q; Q/5. The
problem is that we often don't have the luxury of being able to set flow
rates in home brewing. The garden bib will certainly supply 100 gph but
more probably 250-300. This can be regulated by closing the valve but how
do you measure the rate? Flow meters are, of course, available from many
sources (Cole Parmer, Grainger) but they are a nuisance to install and cost
money. In many situations, cooling water is plentiful and is not "wasted"
if, for example, it is sent to the garden (but don't forget the water meter
if you are on a municipal supply).


Wort flow is more difficult to control as we are usually at the mercy of
gravity. The only away around this is a pump, valve and another flow meter
(more expense). The pump must be able to handle hot, acid wort (read about
$130 for a 1/25 HP magnetic coupled job) and the flow meters WILL clog up
with hop bits and cold trub.


As for the interior design of the Hart's, I am curious too. A larger inner
tube means a smaller ratio of surface area through which heat may pass to
volume of wort enclosed so the trick is to increase the heat transfer per
unit area. In the Stolting chiller this is done by affixing fins to the
outside of the tube. Perhaps the Hart does the same.

Don Walsh asks about Brita filters. They are indeed anion/cation exchangers
with a carbon filter and a smidgeon of, I believe, a silver salt to prevent
growth of bacteria in the filtered water. An ideal cation/anion exchanger
will produce water which is virtually ion free. These are often used in
laboratories where they produce water with resistances of 15 megohms/cm.
The Brita need not do so good a job and I don't know how effective they
actually are. I guess I'll just have to buy one and check it out.


Given that they remove all the ions, the pH of the resulting water would be
7.00. If the pH is other than 7.00 that means there are ions present. The
usual suspect, as I said before, is bicarbonate which comes from carbon
dioxide in the air. It takes a while for this to dissolve but the pH pretty
quickly starts to make it's way towards about 5.6. Boiling will drive the
CO2 off and the pH then returns to where it was. Thus, if the Brita removes
all ions, you might expect the pH of output water to be in the high 6's but
on boiling and cooling, by whatever method, the pH should return to 7.00.
The fact that Don's did not means that a) the basic assumption is wrong
(i.e. the output water is not pure) b) the boiling process introduced
something or c) the pH measurements were in error.


WRT a) the Brita is not supposed to produce lab water. It may therefore,
not get everything (such as perhaps silica). Someone suggested here (I
think) that organic acids used in the preparation of the charcoal might be
present in the Brita output. WRT b) very clean glassware would have to be
used and even then would introduce some sodium and silica. Only very small
amounts of ions ( < E-7 equivalents) are necessary to effect pH shifts of
these magnitudes). WRT c) a good stable electrode, fresh, accurate buffers
and good technique are necessary for accurate measurements in very dilute
solutions as ionic strength is low. I have seen even high quality
electrodes behave very strangely in water of high purity.


I could understand a lower pH with gradual cooling (allow CO2 to dissolve)
as opposed to force cooling, but not the other way around as reported.
Consider me equally puzzled by that one.

Subject: Brettanomyces Imperial Stout


        I've always been intrigued by the reference in Wahl and 
Henius to Brettanomyces secondary fermentation in traditional old 
ales and porters.  They imply that this was the reason that these 
beers were aged so long in wooden casks.  I have read that Strong 
Suffolk is still made this way, but I have never had this beer.
        Last fall I brewed an imperial stout.  When it came time 
to bottle, I learned that Scott Bickham was building up a 
Brettanomyces culture, and got 35 ml of the culture from him.  I 
primed the beer and bottled four gallons, then drained the last 
gallon into a one-gallon cider jug, added the Brettanomyces 
culture, and put an air lock on the jug.  There was some 
fermentation evident for a week or so, then nothing.  I left the 
beer in the jug for four and a half months.
        A few weeks ago my curiousity got the better of me.  I 
racked the beer into a keg and force-carbonated it.
        What did it taste like?  The base beer had some problems 
both in recipe formulation (it included roasted rye) and in 
fermentation (phenols and esters from over-active fermentation), 
but was reasonably in style.  Oddly, some judges have found it to 
have a slightly horsey nose, though it never got near the Brett.  
        The Bret beer was drier, and sour.  It had a definite 
horsey, goaty nose.  The dryness made the beer less drinkable, 
but this beer seemed to be an excellent aperitif in small 
quantities.  I say 'seems' because I made the mistake of taking 
this beer to a brew club meeting and it was quickly consumed.
        I want to try this again, but perhaps with a strong, 
bitter, lighter ale.  Without roasted rye.  
        The only negative was that I became paranoid after 
speaking to Scott Bickham about Brettanomyces 
cross-contamination and threw out or heavily sanitized everything 
that came in contact with the Brett Imperial Stout.

classes, then general instructions for additions and substitutions and
finally my guess at specifically how to use spent grains.


I  finally tried making a batch recently (from a mostly Munich alt), and
found that, contrary to my expectations, the cellulose of the husks
greatly softened with the ferment and bake.  I *wasn"t* picking them out
from my teeth the way I do if I just taste some raw spent grains, or
some spent grain cookies I have had.  I used some last runnings `at` ~1.006
instead of water.  It added to the maltiness of the bread.  I also used
a sourdough starter rather than cultured yeast.  All in all, I was quite
pleased.  I did find that I had underestimated the amount of liquid
remaining in the grains and had to add extra flour to get the proper
consistency dough, but that happens all the time with substitutions and
additions.

Howdy Brewers:


I just kegged for the first time and the world is a creamier, foamier,
heady-er place. It's a beautiful thing.  I'm having one problem, though,
which is is getting a perfect seal around the lid of the keg.  It's a
5 gal. ball-lock corney, reconditioned, new gaskets, in very nice shape.
When force carbonating at pressures of 8-9 psi and greater there is no
apparent leakage, but at dispensing pressure (about 5 psi) there is
significant gas leakage around to oval lid.  Thinking I had a bad O-ring
or micro-fissure in the lid itself, I replaced both.  Same problem,
same spot.  With both lid & O-ring assemblies, the leak occurs right
at the point where the long axis of the oval intersects the perimeter.
I cannot detect any deformities in the steel top of the keg.  I can feel
a little roughness just under the rim of the opening, where the O-ring is
seated, but I scrubbed and scrubbed and can't get rid of it, so I assume
it is part of the keg and not a residue.  I don't know what to try next.
Any suggestions?

Hi everyone!
  This is my first posting here, although I've been homebrewing in Austin, Texas
for 5.5 years.  I used to teach it for Univ. of Texas Informal Classes.
I'm a bit embarrassed to have to ask this, but I'm unclear about how
long you need to lager things.  I'd always used 2 months as a rule
of thumb, except for bocks (traditional, not American or Texas) and
Dbocks, which take 3 months.  Lately, however, I've been thinking that
the length of time required for lagering is probably related to the original
gravity.  A Dbock, at OG 1.075+, or bock, at 1.065-1.075, requires 3 months.
Lagers beers with lighter gravities require 2 months.  Right now, I am 
fermenting a summer Vienna, OG 1.045, and an organic ginger-pepper honey
lager, OG 1.040.  They will be ready to lager in a week-and-a-half.  I'm 
thinking that gravities below 1.045 could be lagered at around 32-34 F for,
say, 6 weeks. 
  I'd be very interested in anyone's thoughts on this.  My background is not,
repeat, not, in chemistry---I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering,
in mech. systems in design.  I'm also a lady.

I think you may be referring to my post in HBD 1668, March 1, 1995 (almost a 
year to the day!).  In researching canning techniques, several well-respected 
books made the difference between low-acid foods and high-acid foods.  I think 
the cutoff point is ph 4.6.  I had measured my wort's ph at about 5.3, which put
it in the low-acid category, which, according to the books, requires pressure 
canning.

The actual problem, as I understand it, is that the botulism spores can 
withstand boiling temperatures, and carry over into the finished product.  Some 
time after I posted this article, I read in Miller's book that the bacteria or 
spores could not live in beer wort anyway, which coincides with what you quote. 
Several people sent me mail that they had used regular canning procedures for 
years, with no problems.  Being incredibly anal retentive, I reached a 
compromise of adding acid to prepared wort to bring the ph down to 4.6 (a very 
small adjustment), and treat like a high-acid juice, requiring only a boiling 
water treatment.  My yeast seem to love it, and it cannot be detected in the 
final product.  I use the procedures as described in the Ball canning book (same
people that make the jars).  This is a very good resource, and is probably 
available in most public libraries.


Good luck!

I have to strongly disagree; Are we comparing Randy Mosher's book to

To me, there is no comparison. Miller's book is geared toward the

style is very drab and not at all interesting. Mosher is much more of
a "writer" with interesting historical facts and style related info.

People complain about the brewing log section of Mosher's book as a
waste, but you can tear it out if you don't like it and it still has
MUCH more useful information than Miller's book. Miller wastes many
pages glossing over topics such as filtering and kegging that really
can't be adequately covered in a beginner's book. Also, after the
beginners stage, you can throw out all the pages dedicated to recipes.
Some of these recipes seem dubious at best, and I wonder whether he
really ever made beer with these recipes. 


>>For me TBC has about 20 pages of usefull information.  Much of it seems

Again, I have to disagree. The majority of homebrewers DO NOT have an
online brewing log or calculator program. The Brewer's Companion has 
many useful sections on water treatment, enzyme activity, hop varieties
and IBU calculations, clarifying agents, extract potential, etc. 
I even used parts of Mosher's book to study for the bjcp exam. It 
presents some very technical info in an approachable manner. 
I frequently reference Mosher's book when I can't remember a certain
detail, but I haven't even opened Miller's book recently, In fact,
I'm not sure where it is ...

This is sometimes called 'top-dough' or by the German word 'tieg'
(prounounced 'teague' ;-) which means dough or paste.  Handy word just
'cause it's shorter.


There is no advantage to having this layer appear on the top of the mash.
In fact, it can be a disadvantage.  Because the layer is so gluey, the
sparge water can have difficulty penetrating it.  The layer can even act
like a piston and compact the whole bed, slowing the run-off to nil.  I had
this happen once on a 10 Hl system.  This is a good reason to stir up the
very top of the mash during lautering, so that the doughy stuff is
distributed among the larger particles, rather than in an impermeable layer.
The stirring also counter-acts channelling.  OTOH, if there aren't any
problems in run-off, then the appearance of the layer is certainly nothing
to worry about.


If you have quite a thin mash, then the large particles settle faster than
the fine ones and you are more likely to see this stuff appear.  In a thick
mash, everything stays mixed up together.  So the lack of sparge water on
the top of Neal's mash may be the reason why he didn't see it this time
around.  Also, the small particles which make the run-off cloudy contribute
to the tieg, so the more you have to recirculate, the more likely you might
be to get this layer.  So, Neal, maybe your fancy new LT has a better screen
that sets up a filterbed sooner, sucking less of the fines from the bottom?

This is a fact of heat exchanger design.  After the temperature differential
gets low enough, increasing the heat transfer area gives little return.  For
this type of chiller, 25' seems to be about right, so don't waste money on
extra tubing.


>Finally, is the key to CF design a large diameter inner tube as in the

Nope.  The Heart chiller must have fins in the coolant passage, on the
outside of the inner tube, which greatly increase heat transfer area for a
given length.  I'm pretty sure this is an off-the-shelf, general purpose heat
exchanger unit that Heart's is re-selling.

brewers have lying around the house.   It was easy and fun.  Here's how I
made it:


Take one of those big strainer funnels and stick a size 6 1/2 rubber stopper
in the neck.  Fit the 3/8 copper tubing from your CF wort chiller into the
hole in the stopper; pull the stopper in tight.  Check for leaks with water.
Shove a stainless or copper scrub pad into the neck of the funnel above the
stopper; this should prevent hops from clogging the chiller.  Direct the hot
wort flow into the funnel, adjusting the flow rate to keep the level in the
funnel constant, slightly above the tube from the wort kettle.  The wort
flows through the hops, and immediately goes into the chiller, (hopefully)
minimizing loss of aromatics.


Simple, easy and cheap.  There were no clogging problems, and adjusting the
level was not a problem, since the flow through the chiller is slower than
the wide-open flow out of the kettle; just adjust the kettle output valve.


It's an open hopback and could be susceptible to HSA, but keeping the level
above the bottom of the kettle tube should minimize HSA.  Of course you need
to watch it to keep the level OK.


I can't say whether it makes a difference in the beer because 1) the beer I
brewed won't be ready for a couple of weeks and 2) I don't have a control
batch, so maybe any changes I detect will be due to something else.


BTW, the funnel is also an easy way to run cleaner, sanitizer or boiling
water through the chiller.
