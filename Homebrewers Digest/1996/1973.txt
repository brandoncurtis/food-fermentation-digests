Subject: Don't fudge that data


John W. Braue, III (braue`at`ratsnest.win.net) wraps up his answer to
CASteveB`at`aol.com's question about the measurement of specific gravities
with:


>Moral:  measure carefully, mix thoroughly, and ensure that your
>hydrometer is calibrated correctly.  If you still don't get the
>right answer, assume that you did anyway.  Brewing is technology
>and art, not science; it's perfectly alright to fudge the data if
>that gives a better result.


John is much too quick in dismissing the role of science in brewing
(especially since he gave such a nice scientific explanation for Steve's
apparent problem!).


Measuring ingredients carefully, taking careful instrument readings,
and recording one's procedures all fall within the category of "The
Scientific Method", and are done with the idea of being able to repro-
duce the results of a particular brew session at a later time (as much
as this is possible in homebrewing) or to do some post-mortem trouble-
shooting if something happens to go wrong along the way.


Moral: Don't fudge the data.  If your data doesn't fit your expectations,
try to find the explanation (as John did for Steve's SG anomaly).

   If the rice was fully gelatinized and you didn't have any problems

for a while and have not had a problem with conversion.  What I have had a
problem with is getting to the point where I could read an iodine test and know
what I was looking at.  According to Dave Miller, suspended cellulose will give
the same reaction as unconverted starch.  That might have been what you were
seeing.  All I know is that I stopped trying to use iodine, and started
depending solely on time and temperature to know when conversion *should* be
complete.  It has worked for me.


   If anyone is interested, I have a short outline of my rice brewing method

Subject: Diacetyl - is it really a noun?


We brewers tend to use the term diacetyl as a noun, but from the structure
of the word it looks like an adjective.  Is it really a noun, or are we just
trashing ( turning a noun into a verb) the language?  If it's an adjective,
then diacetyl what?

It took 20+ min to drop the temperature to 65 in the 25' and 12+ min to
drop the temperature to 64 in the 50'.  This is not a measure of the rate
at which the wort CAN flow.   Unrestricted wort flow varied amoung the
chillers, therefore wort flow could be used to (attempt to) nomalize the
final wort temperture.  We restricted the flow in the 25' model so that the
output temperature would be in a usable range.   This was less of an issue
with the more efficient 50' models and that's why in the 50' chiller we
could let it flow faster.


>Are not the

They are the same length and design (the same guts), but apparently not
equal. It must mean that either or both the diameter of the hose or the
diameter of the coil plays an important role in the efficiency.  One could
argue that a smaller diameter coil, on the order of 12 inches might produce
more turbulence resulting in a more rapid cooling rate than a larger
diameter coil of 24 inches or a chiller that was linear.


>I was a little suprised to note that the extra 25' of

Yes, but it dropped it much faster. We were looking at rates, not how low
could it go.


> Finally,
>is the key to CF design a large diameter inner tube as in the Heart's chiller?


Heart's chiller has internal baffling (not fins, per Heart's) to produce
turbulent flow.  That's that key in this instance.  I suspect this unit was
originally designed as part of another piece of equipment (oil cooler?).

I think the best you could do is to add a fairly large quantity of settled
yeast that had been very well aerated in the starter, (being sure that the
temperature of the starter and the winter warmer wort were right for the
new yeast.)  I'm assuming that you didn't use a starter with the #1028?
Probably you would want to add more of that same yeast, but with a good dry
yeast you could add this within a couple of days.  The idea is to add yeast
that had plenty of O2 in their last generation, which should be able to
continue to ferment with less than ideal O2 situation in your wort, and not
to add more oxegenated wort.  Just adding some dry yeast would probably
help, since most of it is pretty well oxegenated when it's dried.

Subject: Botulinum


Regarding recent posts about botulism:  It is true that the Clostridium
botulinum bacteria and the endotoxic it produces are destroyed by boiling.
However, the spores may withstand 100 C for several hours and could therefore
potentially contaminate the wort.  Spore germination and toxin production
are both inhibited at low pH and toxin production is also reduced at
temperatures below 6 C, so contamination of wort (especially if refrigerated)
would be unlikely.  If one wanted to be absolutely certain that there was no
contamination, the spores can be destroyed by moist heat at 120 C for 30 min.

Subject: polyphenols (tannins) and silicates




Some thoughts a questions ...


Quite a few weeks ago (last year?) I believe it was Charlie Scandrett
who suggested some radical, challenging and intriguing suggestions for
a small brewery contstruction.  Among them the use of dehusked grain
in order to reduce tannin extraction as I recall (sorry if the
attribution and detail isn't quite right).  An interesting table in
M&B Sci makes a tabular display of extract, silicate and tannin
extraction of normal and dehusked malt for 1st wort, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and
4th sparging [taken from, 'Grey & Stone, 1948, Wallerstein Labs Comm.
11,301'].  The relevent parts of the table produced below:


Normal Malt:
          Extract%        Silicates        Tannins(mg/L)
                        (SiO2 mg/L)
        ---------------------------------------------
1st wort    20.5        37                78
1st sparge  16.9        39                49
2nd sparge   8.3        17                25
3nd sparge   6.0        18                24
4nd sparge   5.0        31                18


Dehusked Malt


          Extract%        Silicates        Tannins(mg/L)
                        (SiO2 mg/L)
        ---------------------------------------------
1st wort    25.4        nil                66
1st sparge  13.8        nil                --
2nd sparge   7.6        nil                24
3nd sparge   6.4        nil                25
4nd sparge   --         nil                --




The final hopped wort ended up w/ virtually the same extract, 91% less
silicates and 22% less tannins for the dehusked beer.  The dehusked
mash also sparged out somewhat faster.


Well without access to this paper (which isn't likely), it's a little
hard to interpret these results, but it's fairly clear that dehusking
will remove a very large portion of the silicates, but only a fraction
of the tannins.  The decrease in tannins appears to be mostly in the
first runnings.  The tannins from the 'normal malt' decrease in
successive runnings, but not as quickly as the decrease in extract.
It would be very nice to see this sort of table with a more detailed
breakdown into more specific phenolic compounds.
- --
Silicates are mostly in the outer husk, contribute harshness to the
final beer and, like tannins, are more readily extracted from the husk
at higher temperatures and higher pH values.


*Incidentally, rice hulls, which have been suggested as a mechanical
*aid to difficult to sparge wheat and rye beers, are very high in
*silicates.
- --
Polyphenols are concentrated in the pericarp and alleurone layers just
below the outer husk(pallea + lemma).  I believe that the pericarp
comes off with the outer husk, but if anyone can clarify this I'd like
to hear about it.


Are the polyphenols in the pericarp and alleurone attached in proteins
tannin complexes ?  Why is pH a factor in their release ?  Is cold
sparging a practical possibility ?

Subject: depth of grainbed




Just to add my $0.02 (Canadian) worth on the subject of the depth of the
grainbed in a lautertun.


My LT is 40.5 cm (16 inches) in diameter, for an area of 0.128 square meters
(1.39 square feet).  I normally use 10 kg (22 lb.) of grain because that
gives enough wort to fill my 60 quart kettle.  So that's 78 kg/m2 or 15.8
lb/ft2.  The depth of the grainbed is about 6-8 inches.


I have used up to 18 kg (40 lb) in this lautertun, but the run-off was a bit
slow.  That's 140 kg/m2 or 28 lb/ft2.  Then the grain is more like 14 inches
deep.  The false bottom is SS wedge-wire.


Rehberger and Luther in the Handbook of Brewing (ed. Hardwick) write,
"Specific loading varies from milling process and lauter tun design.  Dry
milling ranges from 33.5 - 61 lb/ft2 ..." p. 282.  However, since large
industrial brewers may run the rakes continually during sparging, they can
get away using a lot more grain.  So much for the references.  


Another way to look at it is according to the factors which determine the
minimum and maximum bed depths.  Here's a more verbose version of what Al K.
posted.


The minimum grain depth is the one in which you can establish a filter bed
and get even flow of spargewater through the grainbed.  I think it was last
summer that we went all through a discussion of particles moving up and down
in the mash and even whether there was such a thing as a filter bed.  To
repeat what I have observed on various brewing systems: the filter bed is
created because the very small particles in the mash are washed away from
the bottom of the mash in the recirculation leaving a filterbed of husks and
other larger particles behind.  I think this filterbed is only an inch or so
thick, based upon my experience of being able to run the rakes in a
commercial lauter tun an inch above the bottom without causing the wort to
become cloudy.


So the real factor that affects the minimum grain depth is the ability to
get an even flow through the grain.  I'm pretty sure that resistance to flow
is proportional to the square of the grain depth.  That is, if the grain
depth varies between three and four inches, sparge will travel through the
four inch areas at only 56% of the rate that it goes through the three inch
areas (3e2/4e2 = 9/16).  And especialy since the four inch area contains 33%
more extract (4/3), this is a problem.  It could work out to much more than
a few points per gallon.  Channeling would have a greater effect in a thin
bed too.  In short, it's easier to get an even flow with a thicker bed (to a
point).


I think that the only factor affecting the maximum depth is the length of
time it takes to lauter.  Does anyone out there have a grain bed deeper than
a foot?  


It seems right to me that the grain depth should be less than the diameter
or width of the lauter tun.  The only support I can give for this feeling is
that as the bed contracts during sparging, it can crack but almost *always*
pulls away from the sides of the vessel.  The effect of this channelling
would be more severe with a tall narrow LT than with a short wide LT.  This
is where proportionality comes in. 


I know this doesn't quite jive with what Jared wrote about Siebel's pilot
LT: "ideal grain depth is 18 inches. ...   The >mash-tun was a tall
rectagular box about 20 inches high, 10 inches depth and 5 >inches in
width."  Perhaps Siebel, oriented to larger scale commercial brewing, made a
mistake when scaling down?


The actual height of the lauter tun is irrelevant -- as long as it's higher
than the grain ;-)  Since the extra height of the LT above the grain serves
no purpose, it's silly (tm) to talk about grain depth as a fraction of the
lautertun height.


Conclusion?  When designing a LT, you decide what range of batchsizes you
want it to be able to accomodate, what amounts of grain that it will take to
make those batches, and then you try to get the weight of grain per area of
false bottom in the range of 12 to 25 lb/ft2.


I'll compile and post of summary of others experience if people want to send
me their numbers: size of LT, weights of grain used, perhaps with a
description of their false bottom and approximate flow rates.

Subject: Lactobacilli from malt grain




Several times I've read the suggestion on HDB that malted grains can
be used as a source of lactobaccilli for brewing acidification.  One
of the Cat's Meow recipes call for this as well.


As an experiment I made a 6 oz sterile wort starter from extract and
'pitched' with a tablespoon of pale malted barley.  The airlock
bubbled, tho never vigorously, and after 10 days I took a look.  The
wort was somewhat cloudy.  The aroma was sort of like (yeast)
fermenting wort but w/o the yeasty toasty smell, tho there was a
substantial DSM odor.  The flavor was most definitely lactic acid and
malty wort flavors.  I slipped a few drops under a microscope and -
WOW - enough distinct bacteria to make any swamp jealous !


Well I expected contamination but this was a jungle.  I did this
ferment at ambient room temps (around 70F) - if I was trying hard to
select thermophilic bacteria like L.Delbreuckii I should have kept the
temperature up - and bumped it up higher on signs of an infection.  My
conclusion is beware of those overnight acid rests - you can't tell
*what* is growing in there.


BTW - via private email I've found that The Yeast Kit Company will
sell a pure L.Delbreuckii culture (not a smack pack) for a modest
price.  So there is no reason for the bacterial cultural elite to make
inferior Dry stouts and Berliner Weiss.

That's not a good idea.  My admittedly limited knowledge of yeast physiology

It is a problem.  You already have the answer, grasshopper.  AERATE IT!  It's
not too late, it's never too late.  Well, sometimes it is - you might oxidize
the wort.  However, active yeast will 'reduce' those oxidized chemicals back
to what you want them.

Boiling hops in water doesn't do the same as boiling them in wort - different
chemicals come through in different proportions, and different reactions take
place on top of that.  The best way to present different hop characteristics 
is to brew a bunch of little test batches with an identical recipe but 
different hoppings.  A pain?  Yes, but the only way to get accurate hop 
representation.

I'd bet it's something different, maybe poorly crushed grain?  


My last batch never fully converted.  I got bored with waiting, and just 
made beer with it.  It took a long time to clear in the carboy, and wasn't
as high a gravity as I wanted, but it tastes great.  (It was also a bit 
overhopped, but that's waning with age.)

Weird.  I usually get a lot more.  Maybe you're not boiling vigorously enough?
Do you do larger boils with all grain than you did with extract?  It could
be that you have enough heat to do the smaller batches but not enough for 
the larger batches.

Subject: Ready-made RIMS & pump motor controllers?


I received a catalog at work today from Solid State Advanced Controls (315)
638-1300.  There are at least two items which may be of interest to y'all.  I
know nothing about this company; I probably requested the info for reference
some time ago.  Not even sure they'll sell to you as an "individual"
(although their price sheet does include single quantity), but it'd be worth
a shot if you're interested.


Item 1 is the TCR series temperature controller.  You add an NTC thermistor
and a pot, and wire it to the line and the heater element.  The unit switches
when the thermistor resistance equals the pot resistance plus about 1K.  You
can select a thermistor and pot for whatever range or sensitivity you're
after.  The 100K thermistor Morris recommends in his original RIMS circuit
article has a resistance of about 100K at 25C. about 25K at 55C, and about
7.5K at 85C (to give you an idea).  The unit is in a 2" x 2" x 3/4" package
(tiny!) with six 1/4" terminal lugs.  The package has a hole in the center
for mounting to a heat sink with a #8 to #12 screw.  It's powered entirely
off the AC line.  It's available in 120 or 230 VAC models, and 6, 10, or 20
amp operation.  Price range is $33.65 (6A, either voltage) to $47.76 (20A)
with discounts for higher volumes.  One possible drawback -- it lacks the
anticipator circuit Morris uses, so some overshoot is to be expected (how
much, I don't know -- depends on your system).  Accuracy is claimed to within
1 deg C of setpoint.


Item 2 is an AC Phase controller, which basically is a variable power
controller.  It'd be a nice RIMS pump speed control, and other available
models will handle much more power than that.  It's the PHS series, in a 2 x
2 x 1 package similar to the TCR.  You just add a cheapo pot (100K for 120V,
200K for 230V) and connect the unit to the line and the load.  It has three
terminal lugs for connection.  Again, it's available for 120 or 230 VAC, and
1, 6, 10, and 20A capacity (the 20A capacity is worth 2400W of control at
120VAC and 4800W at 240VAC!).  Pricing goes from $9.28 (1A) to $24.13 (20A).


In addition to controlling pump speed, another PHS could be used in
conjunction woth the TCR to control the max power of the element, to serve as
a temperature-rise rate controller.


No affiliation blah blah blah but it might help some of you
soldering-iron-challenged brewers out there.


Please direct all further questions about these products to the phone number
above...

Assuming there are no leaks in your keg, one solution is to buy an
oversize large o-ring - about $5 US - from Williams in CA.  I have several 
for older pin-lock kegs: they are fatter (larger cross section) and are more
pliable than stock o-rings.  Another option is to serve at your 8-9 psi: if
you choose your beverage line tubing diameter and length properly, you
should be able to serve at 8-9 psi in the 40's (F).  Based on HBD info,
I use 4' of 3/16" ID hose and can serve up to about 10 psi reliably.

  That's consistent with my experience with corny kegs. It takes 10-12 psi
to "seat" the large Oring and get a good seal. You can dispense at 10-12 psi
with no problem, but you'll need to adjust your tubing length/diameter to
compensate for the higher dispensing pressure.
  FWIW, I use just over 3 feet of 3/16" beverage tubing, which drops about
3 psi/ft (by comparison, the 1/4" tubing drops just 1 psi/ft). There's a 1 psi
drop across the hose connect, another 1 psi across the cobra head tap, so
the total pressure drop across the dispensing line is roughly equivalent to
10-12 psi also.

  IMHO, lagering times are related more to yeast strain and fermentation
schedule rather than OG. Some lager strains produce a lot of hydrogen sulfide
(smells like rotten eggs), diacetyl, etc., during primary, and require 3-4
months of lagering to eliminate. Conversely, other strains such as W 34/70
ferment very cleanly, and produce good results after just 4-6 weeks of
lagering. Use of a diacetyl rest can also shorten lagering times significantly.


  With that said, my schedule for lagering is similar to Tam's. I use Wyeast
2206 or 2308 for lagers above 1.060 such as bocks and festbiers, and lager
for 3-4 months. The 2206 is one of the aforementioned strains that produces
copious amounts of hydrogen sulfide during primary. A 1.048 pilsner pitched
with W34/70 is generally in the glass less than 2 months after brewday. So,
while I've also seen a correlation between lagering times and OG, I think it's
due more to the strain of yeast used.


>I'm
>thinking that gravities below 1.045 could be lagered at around 32-34 F for,

Try the W34/70, use a diacetyl rest, and this should work.

from what i have come across so far, 5 psi is about the minimum pressure any
corney keg will hold. the last batch i kegged started `at` about 25psi. i
didn't foam too much on dispensing--maybe an inch in a pint mug. i think

the beer is very light in color and has a very crisp taste. so the question

Soaking overnight (or longer) in a solution of 500 ml clear ammonia
to 20 l cold water has worked well for me in the past.  Judging
from the use of clear bottles (it's always difficult to tell if a
brown bottle is *really* clean, isn't it?), this removes
everything except some label-glue residue.

Use household bleach in the 250 - 330 ml range per 20 l of water. 
Rinse well (i.e., don't just stick the bottle under the tap and
call it done; actually swirl some water about on the inside) in the
hottest possible water (I don't believe in OSHA standards, and
have my water heater set to about 65 deg C).


Prepping bottles *is* a pain in whatever end of the spinal column

I visited the small geuzebrewery CATILLION in Anderlecht, a part of 
Bruxelles (don't no the adress), a couple of years ago. It's a fantastic 
experience. The brewery is run in a very small scale and in a traditional 
way. Don't miss it. It's really worth a visit.

Subject:       Storage of yeast.


Hi there


I have a few questions about storage of yeast.
What is the best way to store dry yeast. Can I freeze it ? How long 
can I store it ? I ask because it is difficult for me to get the 
right yeast for my purposes. I wish to order yeast from U.S. to my 
country (South Africa) and would like to store it as long as 
possible.
If any beer mail order business read this message, please send me a 
catalogue.
Thanks 
Bye
Braam

     In HBD#1972 Craig Stewart curses the chore of bottle washing and in 
     several past issues people have mentioned the chore as a major reason 
     for switching to kegging.  Well, to each their own, and maybe I'm so 
     new to homebrewing; but it seems like this is an attitude issue.
     
     I love to wash and fill bottles.  It's part of the Zen of brewing.  
     It's quiet time to reflect on the art and slow down the pace of life.  
     Put on some music, enjoy a brew, "Be still and know that I am brewing 
     (a twisted Biblical paraphrase)".
     
     Ski buffs sharpen their blades, fishers build their lures, homebrewers 
     bottle (apologies to those of the kegging persuasion).

A guy at my local brewshop swears by his "toasted almond" ale.  His method is to
spread a pound or so of grain on a cookie sheet, sprinkle a bottle of almond 
extract over it, then toast it in the oven as described in Papazian.  This 
sounded very suspect to me, but several people claim it is a fantastic beer, and
the almond flavor really comes through.  Disclaimer:  This is second-hand 
information only; I have never tried it.  I just thought it was an interesting 
idea that I may try in the future.  If you try this, I would definitely suggest 
grinding the grain before you wet it in any way.  Even the slightest amount of 
moisture makes quite a mess in a mill.  A safer approach may be to add the 
extract at bottling.  You could bottle half the batch as normal, and then add 
some extract to the remainder to do a side-by-side comparison and to adjust 
quantities.  Just remember to take very good notes.  Good Luck!
