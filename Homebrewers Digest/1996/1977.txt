Date-Warning: Date header was inserted by grove.iup.edu

Subject: Advice on thick & maybe stuck darkie?


On a modified Porter recipe I got from who knows where, the fermentation
activity quit after about a day and a half. My OG was around 1.072. I
pulled a sample to see what might be going on - SG of 1.032, and a taste
reminiscent of molasses.


The recipe I used called for 2 lbs Crystal, 1/2 lb of both chocolate and
black patent, plus 1 lb dry light extract and 6.6 lbs liquid light. The
only thing I did different this time was I rinsed (150 deg) and
squeeeeeeezed (again and again) the 6 boilbags of grains until they were
absolutely clear.


Thinking maybe the wort hadn't gotten enough oxygen, I pulled another
sample and boiled it, added cold and vigorously aerated it, and added yeast
in a 2-qt jar with lid and airlock to get myself a yeast culture that could
get it going again. The yeast sank to the bottom of the jar and went right
to sleep, nary a bubble.


Now I'm thinking that maybe it really IS all done, and the high SG is due
not to stuck fermentation but to a high percentage of unfermentables due to
all my squeezins. Any suggestions? And would you think it's worth
bottling/conditioning if my latest assumptions are likely?

In #1972 Scott Rudolph asked about microwaving chili peppers (I'm not
reproducing the post here because I find that seriously annoying).  My
experience with spicy foods is that microwave heating intensifies the
spiciness, sometimes a LOT.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but definitely
one to be aware of.  I'll let a biochemist take a shot at why this
happens.


After almost two years away, I've noticed a couple of seemingly derisive
references to copyright.  I also recall a fleeting reference to this
issue a few Brewing Techniques back.  Could someone supply references
to when this was a thread?

Subject: Boston Beer Bottles


I know were not supposed to use "non-returnable" bottles for our homebrews
but I have a question about reusing Boston Beer/Sam Adams bottles.  I used to
buy my 12 oz bottles from my local brew store (about $ 9.95 and tax for a
case of new empties).  Then I discovered Yuengling Porter in returnables at
my local beer distributer (about $ 16.50 a case filled with a wonderful
commercial brew) so I'd drink the porter and keep the bottles for my
homebrew.  Well, the other day I purchased a couple six packs of "Sam Adams"
Scotch Ale and Double Bock beer.  I was looking at the empty bottle and
didn't find the usual "NO RETURN/REFILL" statement.  Also the bottles looked
suspiciously like my new 12 oz bottles.  I weighed the brand new bottles
(about 8 oz of glass) and then my Yuengling porter empties (about 10 oz of
glass), and finally the "Sam Adams" bottles - 8 oz of glass!


My question is does anyone know any reason I couldn't or shouldn't reuse
these "Sam Adams" bottles.  Granted they are not the extra tough reusable
bottles the commercial breweries use, but they've got as much glass (and I
figure strength) as the empty bottles I'd been paying good money for.
 Stacked up with the new bottles I can't even tell the two apart (shape or
weight).  By the way, good old inexpensive "Arm & Hammer" washing soda (aka
extremely overpriced "B-Brite") even soaked off the resistent "Sam Adams"
 foil labels in under 30 minutes.

Subject: I'm Back in the E-Mail Loop -- and SUDS for Mac Redux!


Hello, All!


The bad news is that anyone who has tried to reach me by E-Mail since
February 24 has gotten mail kicked back to them because of, shall we say, a
"dispute" over billing with America On Line.  The good news is that I'm now
back "in the loop" at TAyres`at`aol.com.  So fear not, you have not lost contact
with me!!!  I'm now back on line.  Please resend anything you may have tried
to send me since 2/24.


The second bad news is that this loss of AOL for more than a week posed a
particular problem with regard to two questions I had raised on homebrew
group mail and newsgroup lists such as WortNet, Homebrew Digest, and Lambic
Digest.  Pardon my resubmitting these queries, but I never got answers the
first time because of the AOL snafu, so I'd like to try again.  Here are the
two queries, one to all parties with knowledge and the second to "lambic
geeks" like me:


1)  Does anyone know of any SUDS 4.0-like shareware for the MAC platform?  If
so, what is it like and where can I find it.  I'm very intrigued by SUDS,
which I can use on a 486 at work, but I run MAC most of the time at the
homebrew shop I coown and at home -- would love to find something as good as
SUDS for Mac.  Suggestions?  And where do I find it?


2)  Second questions is regarding my a framboise lambic I currently have in
production.  Sour-mashed, pitched Wyeast (pseudo) Brett and Boon/Cantillon
slurries, plus Wyeast 1056.  Lacks pedio character.  What is the feasibility
of pitching pedio at BOTTLING time.  I'm considering doing this with pedio
from GW Kent.  Any thought, lambic freaks?  Please post to Lambic Digest or
respond via private E-Mail -- now working again!!! -- at TAyres`at`aol.com


Sorry for all the waste bandwith repeating this silliness -- AOL f**cked me
over, what can I say?


Cheers,

Subject: changing channelling




Al K. quotes me on stirring the grain bed during lautering, "The stirring
also counter-acts channelling."  He writes,


>I contend that stirring the grain bed increases channelling.


>This is how I justify this.  Consider water running slowly through the
>grain bed.  Now here comes this rake or spoon that cuts a gorge into
>the grain bed.  The gorge disappears as quickly as it appeared because
>there is a layer of water on top of the grain bed.  What flowed into
>the gorge?  Grain?  Water?


I think that you could either increase or decrease channelling according to
exactly what you did.  When I've been impatient with gummy slow wheat
lauters, I've cut the bed with a knife praying that more liquid would go
through, *any* liquid --- extract, schmextract.


OTOH, with a 6 to 8 inch grain bed, I often stir up the top couple of inches
of grain when there's only about a half inch of water on top.  I stir the
*complete* area of the top of the mash with the result is that the top looks
like a rather thick porridge, like the original mash.  Besides eliminating
channels, the point of doing this was to mix the pasty teig in with other
mash particles.   This is quite different from my knife cutting or the
cutting that the rakes of a commercial tun would do.  There is no gorge into
which the stirred part flows, I don't think.  If there are any channels
remaining, BOTH water and grain flow in.  Hopefully the water keeps going
through the surrounding bed like a normal sparge, the grain is left behind
and voila, the channel is filled in.


>I theorize that cutting through
>the grain bed actually creates a "path of least resistance" which subsequent
>sparge water runs through.  Anybody willing to agree with me on this?


I agree with this.  I tread with trepidation into the touchy territory of
terminology, but do we want to distinguish 'stirring' from 'cutting'?

Subject: Yes, you can re-use primary trub


In response to Darcy Munger's inquiry on 3/2/96:
  Yes, you can re-use that primary  trub.  I used to do it all the time.
You can usually re-use that slurry about three times before it starts
to mutate too far into the unusable range.   This will save you much
money on Wyeast.  The caveats:  as Darcy mentioned, of course you
must put it in a sterilized bottle (be sure to do this using a 
sterilized funnel or hose) with an airlock on it, and store it in the 
fridge.  I like to use Duvel ale 12-oz bottles, since they are very short
and squatty.  I can put a stopper and airlock on top of them and they
still aren't very tall.  Also, be sure to label them with the date, the
batch they came from, what Wyeast it originally was, and how many times
you've used it before.  When I do weirdo brews, like organic ginger-pepper
honey lager, I don't save the slurry, since it's been flavored.  I save
it only from generic-type brews, like porter and Vienna lager.


  I have question, as well:  I have always saved this slurry out of the
primary.  On my recent porter and Belgian white (two separate ales), I
didn't remember to save any until bottling.  You CAN do this with the
slurry from the secondary, can't you (assuming that you haven't waited
eons to bottle, or frozen your yeast, or anything)?  


                   Hope this helps, and thanks in advance for answers,
                   Tam Thompson

Subject: It's Alive (Goofy Gravities Cont.)


On 2/29 I wrote about my fermentation slowing way down with the SG at 1.060.
 I took the measurements while racking to the secondary.  Now, 3 days later,
the beer is *alive* again!  There is a nice 1 to 1-1/2 in layer of kraeusen
and it is bubbling away. (a bubble every 2 sec.)  I was careful not to areate
the beer while racking, so I don't think a great increase in available O2 is
the cause.  Could it be a little disturbing of the trub and redistribution of
the yeast that would revive them?  just a shot in the dark on my "Great
Adventure in Beerland!"


Enjoying the Trip,

Here's another Mac program available from Info-Mac, the Mac shareware 
archive:


The Info-Mac Archive is available at 50 public and private sites around
the world.  For the site list, request it by mail (address below), or try:
  <ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/help/mirror-list.txt>
Also accessible by ftp.  Help files and indexes are also in info-mac/help/.




Attached please find the FREEWARE BrewMeister v1.0 by Frank and Becky
Grimaldi.  There is a serious lack of shareware/freeware homebrew software
for the Macintosh.  This software is a beer "recipe database and recipe
analysis tool" according to the readme.  I just got this from a friend who
got it on Compuserve.  (Thanks, Lance!) I've scanned it with Disinfectant
3.5, but haven't used it yet.


It is geared more to the "all-grain" (scratch if you will) homebrewer,
rather than the extract brewer.  Calculates original and final gravities,
potential alchohol, IBUs, and Color.  Looks pretty decent if you are into
homebrew and use a Mac, especially since there isn't much other shareware
available.

Subject: Channelling.




        No.  Im not a hydrological engineer, just a stream biologist.  
Obviously, erosion develops with water velocity and with time--streams
widen with time because of erosion.  The stream analogy with a grain-bed
would indicate that channelling would also develop with time.  Anything
that forces the process to start over again (e.g. stirring) would minimize
the development of channels.  Mind you, recirculation may be necessary
to reset the grain bed and minimize rubidity of the wort.  


        Raking the grain-bed results in reducing the compaction of the bed
and (according to Richman and Warner) is used in lautering of decoction
mashes.  I've been told by a commercial brew that rather than suffer through
a stuck mash (which often results in channeling--least flow of resistance
and all that) complete stiring and reseting of the grainbed is preferable.
If the mash has shown signs of sticking, it is best to do this
right away than deal with the concrete afterwards.


        I've seen signs of channelling in the two times I've had a stuck 
mash.  There was a mottling of the grainbed and parts were sweet and others
were not.  I suspect that I made the usual mistakes--recirculated too 
quickly, and too much; too fine a grind; too much grain.  Stirring at least
lets one give it another go and slow down the speed of recirculation.  It 
seems that a speed that you can get away with using 24 lbs of malt is higher
than with 35 pounds.

QUAFF Homebrew Club of San Diego. California is pleased to announce the 
results of our third annual competition.  We would like to thank all 
brewers, judges, and stewards who participated and helped to make this 
a successful event.  Once again, the proportion of excellent beers we 
received was very high.  Individual score sheets and ribbons will be 
mailed out to the brewers within a week.  The trophy for Best of Show, 
an engraved beer glass with the QUAFF logo, the competition 
information, the brewer's name and beer will take a while longer since 
it is being custom made.


Due to some categories having insufficient entries, those categories 
were combined with other categories for purposes of scoring.  Ribbons 
were awarded for the combined categories together.  To prevent beers

Hi from Terence in South Africa,
has anybody ever thought of using the pumps found in auto-washing =
machines in the home brewery?  They are supposed to work with hot =
liquids.(I would not use them for pumping hot wort, however) They seem =
ideal for moving cooled wort and beer around. I've used them for pumping =
sparge water with great success.  I'm sure the pumps used over there are =
much the same as those used here and a used pump from the repair shop =
comes out pretty cheap.

In HBD #1975, Greg Heiler asks about racking off cold break:

I used to follow that same process, based on Dave Miller's book.  I 
stopped doing it when I gave some thought to the contents of the 
"trub" I was leaving behind in the settling tank.  One of the big 
components is yeast!  I spend days building a decent size starter 
to pitch into my beer, then rack the just-beginning-to-ferment 
wort off the top of it a few hours later.  Sure, there's lots of
yeast in suspension, but not as much as I'd like to have. 
 
One of the results of the process back then was that my beers were 
much more prone to diacetyl (the noun that means the same as 
2,3-butanedione ;-).  Large quantities of yeast lead to more 
rapid fermentations and are necessary for reducing diacetyl at 
the end of primary fermentation.

(However it is CH3CO not CH3CO-; acetyl is a radical, not an anion)


               then


"Keith Royster" <keith.royster`at`ponyexpress.com>:

And there we have it, almost. It's not "diacetyl followed by what?", but
very simply "acetyl acetyl"! Hence colloquially "diacetyl" although it is
strictly speaking wrong: it should be (and is) "biacetyl". In such a
context, "di" means "two of A attached to the same B", while "bi" means
"two A attached to each other". 


Others of the same type: biphenyl, bibenzyl, and bivinyl.

And now for something completely different, KennyEddy`at`aol.com asks:

That's what the "old" bleach always was.

That's what it always did.


There must be more to the story.

In HBD 1975, Andy Kligerman looks for advice on how to enter a porter and a

>Some references say that porter can

I would recommend entering it as a specialty beer, giving it a title that
implies that you're trying to brew a historic porter, from back in the days 
when porters tasted a bit smokey. 
 
A porter judge would notice the smokey/phenolic character in sharp 
contrast with the other un-peated porters in the flight.  Would tell you to 
lose the smoked grains or enter the beer as a smoked beer if they knew it 
was from smoked grain, or would tell you that your beer is probably infected 
if they picked up just the phenolic character of the smoke. 
 
The smoked beer judge would say that your *lightly* smoked beer doesn't 
have nearly enough smoke in it.  It won't stand up well after a few great 
big smokey Rauchbiers. 
 
Good luck

I have a german style pilsner that was fermented with WY2124 at 48df

should i just wait it out and lager because it's too late (sg 50 tg 12)

Am I likely to reduce the diacetyl that is prob. at twice the taste

If you look at a good brewing text, you should find some information
explaining why people use rakes in mashing systems, and although your
theory may be intuitive, it's not how it works, either in the flower pot
or the mash tun.  


I suppose if you only drew a rake through the mash once, that you would
simply create a new channel, but in a proper system, the rakes move slowly
through the grain bed -- and usually deepen over the course of the mash/
lauter/ process.  This makes is impossible for the water to find fractures
in the bed and form channels, as the fractures are continually broken up.

Dan wrote:


I've been mashing in my converted 10 gallon Gott cooler for about 10, 
five gallon batches. I have had excellent results with one step infusion
mashes. I get about 82% extraction and beautifully clear runoff. 
However, each time I've tried a multiple step infusion mash (with a 
protein rest, conversion, and mash-out) I end up with a stuck sparge.
<snip>
- -----------------


I have experienced this doing step mashes in my Gott too.  It took
a couple of batches, but I finally realized what was causing it.  The
thin final mash allows finer particles to form a thick teig (as recently 
discussed in HBD).  I don't think it has anything to do with the "weight
of the water" on top of the grain, but rather it is the way the grain bed
forms in such a dilute mash:  heavy particles at bottom, teig-forming
"grain dust" settling last on the top.  Kind of like river sediment where
the big rocks settle first, and so forth, until the only thing still suspended
in the water is the silt particulate, which settles last.  If you use adjuncts
such as corn or oats, the teig is very pronounced and you get either
channeling down the sides of the cooler, or a stuck runoff, both not a
good situation.


My ways around this, as you appear to have already discovered, are
to scratch the surface of the grain bed often during the sparge  (or
even skim off some of the teig as it forms), or open the runoff flow
rapidly at first to set the grain bed before it has time to do the gradient
settling (or both).  The problem with an intial wide-open lauter spigot is 
you get a LOT of cloudy liquid you need to recirculate, but you have to 
recirculate it slowly, and only after the grain bed has formed a fairly
firm consistency.  It feels like a bucket brigade!  It's enough to drive 
you to build a RIMS setup!  But seriously, what I now do is dough-in
thick at .5 qt per pound for the protein rest, add boiling water to bring
to conversion temp, and skip the mash-out and use hotter (175F-ish)
sparge water.  The grain bed temp stays under 170F because the temp
differential of the 175-180F sparge water and the 152F mash is small.
I am not trying to re-hash the discussion about whether mash-out is 
required or not.  I'm just saying that's what _I_ do to keep the mash in
my Gott from getting too thin to point it becomes a PITA to sparge.  
You could, of course, use decoction or steam injection to raise mash-
step temps, but that's a whole different story.


Or, just do single-step infusion ;-).


Please, any brewing science students, feel free to enlighten us on the
dynamics of mash consistency and lautering.  Or why the protein rest
actually works better in a thick mash, while conversion works better in
a thin mash (which is a good thing for us Gott mashers!).

I was talking to a friend about equipment I need to buy soon the other 
night, and specifically mentioned getting a wort chiller. He suggested 
instead using liquid nitrogen, which he has ready access to through work.


Off hand I can't think of a reason why (with appropriate safety precautions) 
this wouldn't work. As has been discussed here, wrt carbonation, N2 doesn't 
react with beer. I can't imagine that there is an infection risk from it 
since it is pretty cold (~77 K). And the cold break would probably be 
awesome with cooling occuring in a very few minutes (< 1?).


Can anyone think of any problems beyond the safety issues (i.e. the N2 
flashing into gas and throwing hot wort all over the kitchen)?


TIA
David


PS We will probably try it next weekend and see how it works. If it is 
succesful I will report back.

I never stir my mash, but sometimes I have to increase my sparge water
flow rate, mid-sparge.  Once or twice, I've fumbled on this operation and
have subsequently disturbed the grain bed a little (8" grain beds or so).
A quick look at my runnings showed that they had gotten a little cloudy
suddenly, but then cleared back up quickly.


I think that if you were to:


1. stop taking runnings,
2. stir the grain bed,
3. restart taking runnings into another vessel,
4. recirculate till the runnings are back to "pretty clear,"
5. restart putting the runnings into the kettle,


you may be getting a *little* more extract than if you just let the
thing run without disturbing it.  Remember that 3-hour lauter that
I mentioned in passing?  During it, I was very tempted to stir the
grain bed (who wouldn't?), but I knew the problem was due to the 43%
rye malt and my botched beta-glucan rest (overshot!) and not because
I had a defective grain bed.  In the end I got 32 points/pound/gallon
and my final runnings were (after temperature adjustment) 1.013!!!
I could have gotten 34 points/pound/gallon if I had the patience to
wait another hour.  In three hours I got only 6 USgallons of runnings
in stead of my usual 7.5 or 8.

Isn't a spoon just a dull, bent knife?
