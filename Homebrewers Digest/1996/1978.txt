This is mostly correct, except that the term "radical" refers to a
molecular fragment with an unpaired electron, which is not the same
thing as having a net negative charge.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the noun usage of
"diacetyl" has been around for over a century.  They offer this 1872
quotation:


Watts Dict. Chem. VI. 30 [He] has obtained a colourless pungent
liquid, which is probably free acetyl or diacetyl (C2H3O)2.


We also find "acetyl", with its derivation:

Subject: flaked barley sticks sparge?


A few weeks ago I wrote in about some sparging problems I had with a
Russian Imperial Stout that I brewed.  I got some good advice for improving
my sparging technique, but I think I may have figured out the true culprit
for my stuck sparge.


I made another stout recently in which I used flaked barley, as I did with
the RIS.  I also used the George Fix mashing schedule (as I did with the
RIS), mashing in at 104 F, then skipping the protein rest.  Once again, my
sparge stuck like molasses.  I realized that the previous times I've used
flaked barley in stout, I either mashed in at protein rest temps. or at
saccrification temp. -- and had no problem sparging.  My theory, then,
(admittedly, based on a pretty small N) is that the 104 F rest is not good
for grain bills containing flaked barley.  Perhaps resting at this temp
gelatinizes the flaked barley, turning it into a gooey, gummy mess that
increases wort viscosity, making sparging difficult.


Any thoughts/opinions on this?


- -----------------------------------------------------
On a somewhat related note, has anyone heard about the next book in the
Classic Beer Styles series?  I heard that it might be about Stout.  Does
anyone know if this is true, and if so, who wrote it, and when it might be
out?


Thanks,

The way you present it, I would have to agree...but in application I find
it to be a different story.  No I am not that type engineer, but I have 
watched my grain beds closely while "cutting" (not stirred).


First, imperically I hold that my efficiency has improved with cutting or
"raking".  Regardless of what is filling the space.


Second, the water would have to have somewhere to go.  The grain is 
already in suspention so grain/water fills the cuts. My water table does
not decrease due to the cuts so the wort coming out is the only thing being 
displaced. This may not be true of a stir or vigorous aggitation.  There is
a reason for using a knife or long "thin" blade instead of a spoon.


Third, I do not go further than 1/2 to 3/4 down the bed when making my 
"cuts".  So, I think, I am not disturbing the final filter of the grain bed.
I do not get any added particulates coming out with the wort when making my
cuts so this again is imperical evidence that I have not increased any 
channeling.


OTOH, I do increase my flow if it has slowed down due to packing, etc...
so there may be a basis of truth in your statement.  Regardless, I go back 
to my opening statement...it works for me!

Subject: Plastic Brewery KickOff


Last Saturday was the Bluff Canyon Five-Gallon Plastic Electric Brewery
Inauguration Brawl.  I was going to keep quiet until I actually tasted the
beer, but I've already received a couple of "Well???" e-mails, so I figured
I'd spew some info about the brewery and the session itself, in anticipation
of good beer (please please please).  I'm compiling details on the
construction which will be made available pending successful sampling and
approval of the beer (hopefully in a couple of weeks).  If I end up with
"plastic beer" you can all chide me and hurl epithets and bottles.


A couple weeks ago I did a dry run by "brewing water" (a "wet run"?), with no
ill effects on taste or smell.  This was Confidence Builder Step 1.  Of
course, wort's lower pH makes this somewhat moot, but at least I didn't get
shut down before I started.


I brewed a pale ale, based on David Line's Bass clone, with a couple tweaks.
 I used 9 lb British 2-row, 1/2 lb 20L crystal, 1/4 lb Belgian Aromatic, 1/4
lb wheat, and 2 oz brown sugar,  1 ounce Fuggles pellets and two English
Kent-Goldings plugs for boiling, one plug for flavor (15 min before end of
boil).  I intend to add 1/2 to 1 plug for dry hopping but I may forego that
in deference to better allowing any off-aromas through.  I pitched Wyeast
London ESB directly from the pack.  I ended up with wort at 1.055 gravity.


I used RO water and added 1 gram baking soda, 1 gram canning salt
(non-iodized pure NaCl), 3.5 grams Epsom salt, and 9 grams gypsum per five
gallons, a' la Mosher's and Foster's "Ideal Pale Ale" water profile.  The
baking soda allowed me to add a bit of carbonate for buffering without using
chalk (which isn't very soluble); I had the tolerance in the target profile
for the sodium it added.


The HLT is a five-gal bucket with one 4500W element (State Industries
#9000095, about $7).  The system runs off 240V.  I heated 5 gal treated water
from room to 168F in about 15 minutes.  I struck through a tube attached to a
1/2" CPVC toilet stop valve, onto the top of the grain bed in my Coleman
Drinking Water 5.  While I get a fairly slow flow rate of about 1 gal per
minute, I only experience a degree or two more drop than with "dumping"; I
hit my single-infusion temperature of 151 degrees with 1.33 qt/lb right on
the money.  Mash pH (per my papers) was 5.2.


I incrementally added 10% phosphoric acid solution to the sparge water,
measuring pH with the same papers each time (which apparently worked well for
the mash), but the papers wouldn't budge.  After I added what I was sure was
too much acid, I tasted the water.  Lemon juice.  So I dumped it and rebuilt
five more gallons, and blew off the acid.  I also ordered a pH meter.


The boiler uses two 4500W elements wired in series for a total power of 2250W
(1125 each).  This keeps my power density down to about half of my 20-qt
stockpot on my stove (about 27 W/sq-in).  Judging from the light color of the
final wort, I don't think scorching was a problem.  I added a diode in series
with the boiler (with a bypass switch, forming a HI/LO control), which was a
good thing since full power resulted in boilover every time (I shut it back
down to LO before it actually boiled over!).  At LO power, the boil was
"perfect", and I lost 1/2 gal per hour to evaporation.


I used CPVC toilet "angle stop valves" on all three of my vessels.  These are
1/2" FPT on the inlet and 3/8" compression on the outlet.  This allows me to
use chrome-plated copper feed tubes on the outlet for transfer, which I cut
to various lengths for the different functions.  I used plastic tubing for
the fermenter fill; I drilled three 3/32" holes at a sharp downhill angle
near the top, resulting in 5 gal wort and 1-1/2 gal foam in my 6-1/2 gal
carboy!


I built an immersion chiller right into the boiler lid, so I can fully cover
my wort and "swing" the coil for more efficient cooling (thanks to Wim
Hielkema (HBD1798) for the idea!).  I add ice to a prechiller coil in a small
bucket when the wort is down to about 120F.  An aquarium thermometer affixed
to the boiler accurately tracked the wort temperature as it fell below 85F.


Everything went fine, nothing leaked or melted or burned or warped.  The
buckets were "flexible" due to the heat but held up just fine.  I would
caution you to use at least a 0.090" wall thickness (it's often "printed" on
the bottom of the bucket).  I originally used a 0.070" bucket for the HLT but
the elements sagged under their own weight during testing, so I found a
beefier bucket.  Problem solved.


Two colorful results:  (1) The element wire turned black.  I thought this
might've been scorched wort but it didn't rub off, and the wort was quite
light in the hydrometer vial.  Besides, I had the same effect in the HLT.  I
concluded it was oxide from the acid (wort in the boiler, phosphoric in the
HLT).  (2) The boiler turned green.  This is the same effect that you get
when you use a bucket for fermentation -- the hops discolor the plastic.  I
had already planned to do a post-brewing boil to clean the boiler; this
removed the majority of the discoloration and odor.  How much of batch #1 is
in batch #2 remains to be seen...


I'm very happy with the operation and ease of use of the brewery; of course,
the quality of the resulting brew will be the telling factor.  The brewery
was easy, fun, and relatively inexpensive to build (although I spent $bunch
on lots of dead-end ideas before ending up with the current configuration!).
 It's a five-gallon system -- ten gallons would probably push the
practicality of using regular house-current.  I used 240V; you could use 120V
but you'd need at least a 25A circuit and the HLT would take longer to heat,
but given that, it's possible.  A RIMS could be used for mashing instead of
the simple infusion cooler, of course.  The stand I built (2x4's and plywood)
stores everything very nicely, with room for more stuff, and being on casters
it goes wherever.  Now I must wait for the yeast gods to complete their work.

Subject: Priming: Fermentability coeff. of malt extract?


What's the ballpark rule-of-thumb fermentability of malt extract, in
comparison with a dextrose solution, for purposes of priming?  In moving
over to priming with wort, I was assuming that (given six weeks in the
bottle) a priming solution of malt extract would yield about 85% of the
carbonation that would have been yielded by the same volume of a dextrose
solution of the same SG.  But using this figure for calculating my priming
quantities has proved to be way off, clearly overestimating the carbonating
potential of wort:  i.e. at six weeks the beer is pretty flat.  Papazian's
figure for the relative fermentability of malt -- given as *volumes* of the
dry powders -- is 60% (i.e., use 1.25 cups DME to get the same carbonation
result as .75 cup dextrose).  Dry volumes are not what I'm working with, but
in any case this seemed to me to greatly underestimate the fermentability of
malt extract...  But maybe it was right?

2 gallons a day, eh?  Is there a larger version of this, either from Brita

water for homebrewing purposes?  (Sorry about the Gibsonian jargon there.
I mean "useful" not ecologically relevant.)

Also, was I the only one reading this that thought this thing read like an
infomercial?  Anyone ever see these guys posting before?  I mean, I'm sure
it'll work for brewing, but with such a small size, it seems far from ideal
to me, and, well, the phrasing really sounds more like something someone in
marketing would say than something a homebrewer would say.  I don't mean to
come across as the cynical anti-capitalist that I honestly am, but I haven't
gotten so used to the "no financial involvement, just a satisfied customer"
disclaimers that I didn't notice the absence of it here.


I love product reviews, and I have nothing against getting paid to give one,
but I do want to know when you're getting paid and when you're not.  So, how
about it?  Did Brita compensate you for the review, either in cash or 
merchandise or anything else?  Was the level of compensation at all contingent 
on the outcome of the review?

I have saved the yeast from my last several SECONDARIES, by washing with
boiled water twice, and storing in fridge up to 3 weeks so far.  A few days
before
brewing, I feed it some wort, and it explodes in activity.  Don't have
enough experience to know how often to repitch, or when to give up.  Plan to
try splitting the next batch into 4 different containers.  There is a good
paper on this process on the Brewery webpage.


BTW, I keep the boiled water and starter wort handy by making up a large
batch, and canning it standard mason jars.  Quarts of wort at 1.040.  Quarts
of previously filtered and boiled water.  Pour off about a pint of water,
and pour the rest into the carboy.  Slosh well.  Pour back into the mason
jar, cover and refrigerate overnight.  Pour off the liquid, and add water
from a second quart, slosh well and store in fridge till needed.  Two days
before brewing, pour off most of the liquid, add wort (yet another mason

Some days ago (I lost which digest, and who) someone asked about the pipe
hammering that accompanies the use of jet spray bottle washers.


The standard plumbing cure for this is to create an air-trap.  Plumbers
probably have a technical name for it.  Basically, it is a dead end pipe
that _rises_ from near the faucet that "hammers".  The air pocket absorbs
the shock of shut-off I guess.  I know it worked for me.  Funky ascii art
follows.


The trick seems to be to trap an air "bubble" (air is compressable, water is
not) in the line near the faucet.  Same sort of thing might be rigged with
hose and "Y" hose hook-ups.

Boiling will almost certainly kill the bacteria, but unfortunately
their smelly residues may remain.  The initially higher temperature of
mashing should limit the amount of bacteria, and select for
thermophilic ones - like some of the lactobaccili and ...?!?...
others.  Given the initial boost to say 150F and the limited amount of
time from infusion to boil (< 8 hours?) I wouldn't be overly concerned
(but don't tempt the fates by sticking a dirty mop, or even your arm
in the mash).


My test was carried out at lower than mash temps, to investigate how
'dirty' a bacterially effected acid rests would be.  The answer is
'rather dirty'.  Unless your the sort of person who emulates Belgian
brewing practice by exposing your wort to the night air in order to
encourage wild yeast, then I wouldn't recommend counting on husk
bacteria to generate a reasonably clean lacto ferment.

Yes...every time...between 12 and 16 inches...occassionally 18+...
OK so sue me...I like the bigger beers and I'm just now converting to SS LT.
Then again, maybe not depending on how this turns out.

This was what I had orginally heard/stated or more precisely, the closer the 
width is equal to the depth the better....(am I misinterpreting here)

Ok...help me here...I'm doing 12-13 gal. batches (two corneys and enough for
next batch yeast starters, kreausening (-sp) and normal losses.  I use between
25 to 40 lbs of malt & adjuncts (depending :-} )   


Now how do you suggest I calculate the above if I'm currently intending to
use the Keg LT.  I do have alternatives of a much wider shallower LT...what
are you suggesting and how do I measure it. 


With the current Phils LT and batches half that size I'm getting the above
depths and my sparge is taking between 1 - 1 1/2 hr.  That brings up another
question...if I'm supposed to start my boil as soon as I get an inch or so
in the kettle...I will be boiling for hours....somethings not clicking here.
I'm getting great beers but I don't start the boil until I'm almost done
sparging...contrary to what I've been reading.  What's the deal?

Subject: i've gott it!


i thought i'd report back to the digest on the progress of
my gott design and mash/lauter procedures to improve my
extraction efficiency. my attempts to date have gotten me
to 23-27 pt.gal/lb. my latest attempt reached over 30, which
was my goal.


for those who paged down at the time i last described my
gott setup... i use a perforated pizza pan as a false bottom,
which stood above the outlet (leaving about a gallon of dead
space below the pan). i use another perforated pizza pan as
a distribution header above the bed. my previous mash
attempts included ever increasing volumes of boiling water
for the various temperature infusions. i use a second gott to
keep the hot liquor at the desired temperature.


i received several suggestions for improving the design and
my procedures, thanks to russell, greg, domenick and dave:
1. sparge water might be channeling down the side of the bed,
   and the top pan may need to be rotated as a result
2. additional water for infusions may not be as effective for
   mashing as direct firing using a separate mash tun
3. fill the bottom with marbles (for example) to eliminate the
   volume of the dead space below the pan
4. increase the mashout temperature (i have been hitting the
   low 160s)
5. add 1 gm per gallon gypsum to the sparge water so that it
   can better buffer the grain bed
6. increase the sparge water temperature (maybe to boiling!)
7. redesign the pan so it sits lower and pipe the flow from
   below the pan to the spigot


well, i tried 2, 4, and 7. i dropped the pan to about a half inch
from the bottom by lowering the pan as much as possible on
the stainless steel carriage bolts that i use for legs. i still use
the rubber bung that fits snuggly in the spigot hole, and have
5/8 thick-wall tubing through the bung. i then use a 1/2" copper
elbow to route the flow from a hole i drilled in the side of the
pizza pan to the tubing. the flared end of the elbow fits snuggly
over the tubing, and the non-flared end of the elbow fits inside
the hole drilled in the pan. the sparge cleared quickly, and
continued effortlessly. i sparged with 5 gallons of hot liquor for
about an hour.


i used a pot for mashing, and used an outdoor propane cooker
with a deflected flame to heat the mash tun through the various
steps. i made the steam recipe in the feb brew your own, which
called for steps at 115, 126, 145, 156 and 170. i used about
2-1/2 gallons fo water in the mash for 9 pounds of grain. when
i reached the 156f step i placed the contents of the mash tun
into the lauter tun for the one hour rest, then mashed out by
adding a gallon of boiling water which took the mash to 168f.


since i changed several variables i cannot be certain which had
the biggest impact on the efficiency (how unscientific of me,
which is probably why i'm an engineer). as an added experiment,
i am fermenting at room temperature with a wetted towel around
the glass carboy to reduce the fermentation temperature.


any other comments or questions are welcome. for those still
contemplating the move to all grain - have at it, it's lots of fun!

Subject: Recycled Blow-Off


Hi All,


A few months ago I mentioned that I had been experiencing large
blow-off, around 1/2 to 3/4 gallons.  Not wanting to loose so
much potential beer, I experimented with the blow-off.  I bottled
some of the blow off after letting it sit in a secondary to
clear.  The bottled blow-off was drinkable, but was slightly more
bitter than the rest of the batch, and had a more watered down
body (less mouth feel).  I also saved the blow-off from other
batches and combined it with the rest of the batch when
transferring to the secondary.  


Well based on the past few batches, I have not tasted any off
flavors.  But since I don't like the trouble of catching and
saving the blow-off, I am considering going back to my plastic
bucket for the primary, and may even try open primary
fermentation :^)

The last time I heard a figure from the AHA was about three or four
years ago and the estimate was that the number of homebrewers in the US
is fast approaching 1,000,000 (yes, one million).  My guess is that the
way that the AHA makes these estimates is based partly on the percentage
of AHA members in registered clubs, the total number of club members and
maybe the percentage of non-club members entering competitions.


In Canada, where the taxes on beer are outrageous, I would guess that an
even larger percentage of the population homebrew or brew in BOPs.  My
guess is that by now there are well over 1 million homebrewers in North
America.


There are over 20,000 AHA members, yes, but look at the number of new
members and compare that with the growth of the total number of members.
There may be more former AHA members as there are current ones!

In #1976 Dave Zucchini suggests 1 molar sodium hydroxide in 95% ethanol as
a killer solvent. Note that sodium hydroxide is simply lye which is
available at any hardware store. 95% ethanol was available here in the Old
Dominion at state liquor stores until there was one too many episodes
involving this stuff and undergraduates at The University. Now we have to
go out of state to get it (or pinch it from the lab where they use it to
clean the heads on instrumentation recorders). A 1 molar solution would be
made up by dissolving 40 grams of lye in 1 liter of alcohol. Sounds like
really nasty stuff!

In my previous post on copper I should have noted that the EPA secondary
standard for copper in drinking water is 1 mg/L above which level one can
taste it rather plainly. Thus if your beer doesn't taste metalic it is
probably safe to assume that the copper is below 1 mg/l. If it does taste
metallic, that does not, of course, indicate that it is necessarily copper
which is responsible.

Don Walsh asks about ideal ion concentrations for various styles of beer.
I'm sure opinions on this will vary but mine is that one might as well ask
for the ideal amount of hops or the ideal amount of crystal malt. The
world's various beer styles were driven by the available water. These
styles evolved at a time when water treatment was not understood. As
technology evolved brewers were able to fiddle with ion concentration and
it became just another tweakable variable. Certainly there are general
guidelines i.e. one makes Pilsner with soft water and Burton ale with hard
but within those guidelines the optimum profile is the one that gives the
brewer the result which is most pleasing to him. Don's observation is an
intersting one. Very seldom does one see guidance on a suitable range of
ion concentrations. An exception which comes to mind is Terry Fosters "Pale
Ale" in which he recommends a range of concentrations for each of his
recipes.

Ken Schwarz feels that a pH of 7 does not necessarily imply pure water.
This is quite so although pure water does have a pH of 7. But so also does
a mixture of 1 N hydrochloric acid and 1 N sodium hydroxide which contains
12.5 grams sodium and 17.5 grams chloride per liter. I guess I'll just have
to go spring the 30 bucks for a Brita and see what the before/after ion
concentrations are. Watch this space.

I recently brewed my first wheat beer trying to replicate the types of
wheat ales and hefeweizens I used to drink in the Northwest; these types
include Widmer Hefeweizen, Pyramid Hefeweizen and Wheat Ale, and many
others I can't remember; but they all had a common, distinctive
character that I think specifically typified the Oregon/Washington-area
wheat beer.  I prefer these types over the German weizens/hefeweizens
like Paulaner Hefeweizen.
I am pleased with my wheat ale and would like to know if anyone has any
insight as to the particulars of those northwest wheat beers or any
recipes for clones.  I would like to experiment (read drink) in this
area for awhile.

Subject: Spent Grain Bread


This is to summarize responses to my request for information about 
Spent Grains in breads, I posted a while back.


   Jeff Renner referred me to an article of his available through 
http://www.priimenet.com/~johnj/index.html.  Follow the link to "more 
brewing files".  A nice page, and some good info.


   KJBREW`at`aol.com sent a nice sounding recipe with cracked crystal and 
malt extract, which wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but is filed 
for future reference!


   A whole bunch of folks asked for summaries of any info I got.


Well, bread making is easy, I decided to just do it and find out.  A 
week ago I brewed an all-grain bitter, and saved 4-5 cups of the spent 
grains, which I dried gently in the oven at 200-250 degrees for a few 
hours.  By the time we needed the oven for dinner, they weren't quite 
dry, but I froze them and they didn't freeze into a rock, so you get an 
idea how it was.


On friday last week I mixed 1 1/2 cups sourdough starter, 1 1/2 cups 
water, 1 cup of the dried spent grains, and about 2 cups or so of flour 
(through all this my flour was an equal mixture of bread white, whole 
wheat, and pumpernickle rye) to make a mash, which sat for about 12 
hours.  The next day, I mixed in 2T of yeast (Red Star bread, not 
beer), 2T of salt, 1/4 cup of molasses, 1/4 cup of oil, and enough 
flour to make a good stiff dough.  I really wasn't keeping track, but 
it was 6 or more cups.  Do it until it feels right!   The bread was 
risen twice, and them baked in freeform loaves at 375degrees until 
done, about 35-40 minutes, or so.


The bread had a good sourdough taste and aroma, slightly enhanced I 
think by the flavor of the grains, but not at all prominant.  The 
texture was moist and rich, the bread sliced well, and had a great 
taste.  The spent grains were not at all noticible in the body of the 
bread, although the crust was a bit crunchier than usual.  I'd call the 
experiment a success, an easy and non-objectional way to add bran and 
other nutrients to the the bread.


I summary, dry the spent grain as best you can, and add it to any bread 
recipe in quantities of a cup or maybe less.  While I made a sourdough, 
other bread styles ought to work.  See if you like it!

Subject: Hoegardden White Beer-The Yeast


Howdy Y'all!!


 The "original" (that's what the bottle said) Hoegardden White has shown
up in my local grocery store, and the bottle is LOADED with yeast cells.
I was thinking of culturing this yeast for a batch of wheat brew, but 
I would like to know if anyone knows anything about the yeast. Is it
the same yeast used for fermentation, or is it a conditioning yeast?
The dude at the local brewshop said he didn't know anything about it,
then he said he thinks it's the same as Wyeast Belgian White, so I think
he really doesn't know...
 The beer is imported by Paulaner-Northern in Denver, CO. I think. I
thought the beer itself was pretty good, but I still like Celis White
better, plus Celis isn't $6.77 for four bottles!!
 Anyone have opinions on the beer or yeast, lemme know.


Thanks
