I've got a strong suspicion that what we're calling "mutation" here is
actually "contamination". Unless you've got an extremely mutant-prone strain
of yeast, and/or top-notch sanitation procedures, my (uneducated) guess is
that increasing levels of wild yeast and bacteria would become a problem long
before mutation of the original strain was noticable.


Anyone more qualified care to comment?

What about fermentation temperature? Don't some yeasts produce phenolic
flavors if fermented too warm?

I usually use somewhat less than this, about 1/2 oz per 5 gallons. I still get
the brown stains at this concentration. I actually find the brown stains kind
of reassuring -- I figure if the hoses have absorbed enough iodine to stain
them like that, then nothing's gonna grow in them when they're not in use. :-)

There is one advantage, it is the *most* effective filter of lipids in the
recycled first runnings. However its' main disadvantage is impermeability
which, besides the hydrostatic piston effect, can be uneven, leading to
channeling. I agree with mixing it with the topmost layer (1").


Al K. writes,

It depends on if the prudent step of stopping the flow has been carried out.
Grains *underwater* weigh very little and settle out easily and evenly
depending on size. The dry SG of well modified malt is between 0.95 and 1.0
and would float if mashing-in had not replaced entrained air with water. The
pronounced Archimedes effect of covering the bed with water means that the
other factors are that much more important.  Under hydrodynamic compaction
from flow, hydrostatic compaction from teig (topdough piston effect), or
gravitational compaction from grains above the water table, the grist
particles don't settle easily into the raking void as they are "set".


Jim Cave astutely observes in the first of the rural analogies,

All of this is sound, time and flow rate are important in the development of
channeling. If cloudy wort results from raking, it should be recycled
because of the trub, lipids and unconverted starch in it.


Also he notes,

Stuck sparges and channeling are different manifestations of the same thing.
Watch for uneveness in the teig and flow rate and don't be afraid to start
again.        


Dave H uses a river analogy,

where

The "scratching" is more useful as the recycling of *lots* of cloudy first
runnings will create a thinner but more protein/lipid concentrated teig. The
gradient effect is useful for good filtering.


Al writes from experience,
>and have subsequently disturbed the grain bed a little (8" grain beds or so).

>suddenly, but then cleared back up quickly.


>I think that if you were to:

>5. restart putting the runnings into the kettle,


That is exactly the technique I would recommend to stir without more
channelling. You have answered your own question Al.


but then he distinguishes between "constant" or "occasional"

OK, and pH <5.5
> Cutting the grain bed or occasional stirring will increase channeling and
>reduce the efficiency of the extraction.


The elimination of hydrodynamic (flow pressure, I'll have a method of
monitoring that in the FAQ) and extra gravitational force(exposed grain) on
the *submerged* bed will alow *any* stirring to decrease channeling. Poorly
modified malts, decoction mashed, will not settle after stirring as readily
as they are heavier. In shallow homebrew lauter beds, there is not much
hydrodynamic compaction unless the brewer is really running fast. (more on
flow rates toomorrow) Thus, uneven teig (top dough) or too few wort outlets
(see AK's excellent graphics on flow dynamics at "The Brewery") are probably
the main cause of any channeling. Any stirring of the top of the bed while
*stopped* will aleviate this. Under these conditions (stopped runnings, I
see no logical distinction between "thorough" and "partial", or constant"
and "occasional" except in the degree of the positive effect.


This thread has added greatly to the upcoming Lauter FAQ which is obviously
needed. I'll post the Channelling/Stuck Sparge extract toomorrow for comment.

Consider that yeast, as a living organism, cannot convert maltose and
other sugars into alcohol without using a part of it to supply its own
metabolic needs.  Some fraction of the energy is lost.  (This might be
more complicated for nutrients that are more complex than the easily
convertible sugars and alcohol we're dealing with in beer.  Could
certain complex nutrients actually be made more digestible and hence
more calorie rich by certain conversions?  Quite possibly, but the
nutrients we're dealing with here are all very "convertible" as they
are by the human body, which makes our concept here easier to grasp.)
  
Given two wort samples of equal OG, the one ending in lower FG has
had more alcohol created (with less than 100% efficiency calorie-
wise) from the original sugars.  The one ending in the higher FG has
not had as much of this "calorie-wasting" metabolic activity going on,
and hence it is higher in calories.  Think of the heat generated by
a rapid ferment.  That's lost energy that could be going to your own
waistline!

Hi
I have been wondering. I started fermenting an pale ale a week ago. 
Yesterday I wanted to bottle it and when I tasted it I was HORRIFIED 
by the taste. Bacterial infection ! Me bad brewer,bad bad bad brewer
;-)
Now I was wondering. Could I re-'boil' this whole wort and yeast and 
everything.Maybe add some honey or sugar. And ferment it agian ?
I know I wont get an excellent beer out of this but maybe it is 
drinkable. Or is it better to feed the drain's cockroaches ?
Thanks

Hi there
I would like to make some bread with the used grains after I brewed 
my favourite ale. Are there any recipes on the internet for baking

Tracy Thomason asked about the practical differences between beer and malt
liquor having seen that label on a bottle of Paulaner Hefe-Weizen. In this
case it is a matter of definition by your state liquor control authority:
anything above x% (presumably 5.2 or so in this case) ABV is malt liquor.
There are, of course, lots of laughable regulations of this sort on the
books of the 50. I believe, for example, that in Texas anything, be it
barleywine or bock, above a certain strength must be labeled "ale".

Greg Dolbec has had carbonation problems and suspects that the secondary
fermentastion is not going forward. If this is indeed the case the beer
will taste sweet from the unfermented priming sugar. If it is the case try
placing a few drops of fermenting beer (as from the next batch) in each
bottle or mixing a couple of cups of fermenting beer into the bottling
bucket. It is possible (but unlikelyu) that a flocculant strain of yeast
may settle out before bottling to the point where bottle fermentation is
impeded. Do the bottles give a whoosh when opened? A common problem with
extract brews is that the beer has no head retention whatsoever so that the
carbonation, while there, escapes in huge bubbles in a couple of minutes.


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


Greg also asks about hangover cures. There are lots of "eye of newt and toe
of frog" sorts of things out there but it has been suggested that fructose
will do the job. Fructose starts metabolism by a different pathway than
glucose(for example it skips the points regulated by insulin) and hangover
metabolites try to run certain parts of the metabolic system backwards. All
the parts are coupled by elaborate feedback mechanisms so I suppose it's
possible that fructose may straighten out the tangle that ethanol causes.
Even if it is by placebo effect, it seems to work. It is readily available
at health food stores (diabetics use it as a sweetener). My recipe: squeeze
a lemmon into a small tumbler, add enough fructose to sweeten to lemonade
level, add some water, mix and swill.

Since were mostly talking about carbohydrates here, the source is
insignificant. Any carbos that dissolve will contribute to specific gravity.
The carbos yeast can't use (dextrins, starch, etc.) will just contribute to
the calories in the finished beer.

Umm, I'd be *real* carefull about this.  The "simple matter" of replacing 
the breaker with a bigger one reminds me of replacing an old screw type 
fuse with a penny.  Yeah, ask an electrician and see what he says.  Most 
electricians I know (and I do know more than a few) always match the 
current ratings of the wire and breaker.


Also, while I'm thinking of it.  There's been some talk about using the
burner connector on an electric stove as 240V access.  If you can make a 
good mechanical connection so that shorting and ohmic heating aren't a 
problem, the important thing you have to check is that you are not 
violating the wattage rating of the connector.  The wattage for electric 
elements is usually stamped on the burner support bracket.  Most small 
size burners are about 1800 watts, with the larger ones at around 2400 watts.  
DO NOT exceed these wattages with whatever you hook up to the burner 
connectors.

I am finding that mashing is not really taking that much more time than 
brewing with extracts, and that things are getting faster the more batches I 
make.   Here's a rough 5 hr schedule that I generally follow:


Water to strike temp - 15 min
Mash, get sparge water ready - 1.5 hrs
Lauter/sparge - 45 min
Boil & cleanup - 1.5 hrs
Chill & cleanup - 30 min
Aerate, pitch & final cleanup - 30 min.


SO - starting at about 6pm, I generally finish up at about 11.  Much of the 
1st 2 hrs is spent letting the mash work, so one has time to read to the kids, 
pet the dog, hug the spouse, etc.  I get as much sanitation out of the way as 
possible the night before brew night, and have generally been building a yeast 
starter in the days before as well.


I also find the incremental equipment expense minimal.  I mash on the stove 
with my original 5 gal. boiler.  A 2nd 4 gal. pot was purchased so all the 
wort could be boiled ($25), and a 2nd 5 gal. plastic bucket ($4) was purchased 
to drill holes in to make a lauter tun (already had a bottling bucket for the 
bottom half of the tun).  Chilling is done in a bathtub with water/snow/ice, 
along with 2l frozen pop bottle 'immersion chillers' (free).  This 'equipment' 
has worked well for me for many batches.


In short, I would encourage anyone interested in adding mashing to their 
brewing regimen to make the incremental $ investment, and not worry too much 
about the process taking too much time.  You will find your own way to improve 
upon the above and fit it in, and you will probably be very pleased with the 
results.

CO2 is *not* liquified when delivered in compressed gas cylinders.  The
saturation pressure of of CO2 at 70 F is 853.4 psia, size K cylinders come
at about 850 psia when full, the 5 lb cylinders most homebrewers use are
filled to 500 psia.  (Below the saturation pressure, CO2 exists as a gas.)
The pressure will change continuously while the supply is depleted.
Propane is delivered as a liquid, and Al's points are valid for propane
tank pressure gauges that some people sell.


I agree that the two gauge regulator for CO2 is only  marginally better,
but I would still get a two gauge regulator if I had it to do over - my
experience has been that the pressure falls extremely rapidly at the lower
end of the pressure gauge and it would be nice to have *some* warning.

WHOA!  Slow down!


* A 20A circuit requires 12 gauge wire, while a 15A circuit requires
only 14 gauge (14 gauge is smaller than 12 gauge).  DO NOT replace a
15A breaker with a 20A breaker without being SURE that the wire is the
right gauge *all the way* from the breaker panel to the outlet, AND
that all the switches and outlets on the circuit are rated for 20A
(most modern fixtures are).


* Kitchen outlets, under *current* electric code, must be on 20A
circuits.  This is good news.


* A 15A circuit is only rated for 13A continuous load, although it
won't trip the breaker.


* You should be able to get 1125W out of a 15A circuit. Heck, some
hair dryers are rated at 1500 W.

Subject: culturing a 3 strain yeast...


        I recently aquired some yeat from a friend of mine that works in a 
brewpub.  Technically speaking he wasn't supposed to do that, but that is 
the advantage of having friends.  The yeast is supposed to be a triple 
strain: a strong starting yeast, a strong middle yeast and a strong 
finishing yeast.  This is a top flocculating ale yeast that I am 
interested in culturing.  I would think that I could harvest that yeast 
off of the top of a primary fermenting bucket right before I rack it into 
the secondary fermenter.  But here is the question:
        Since it is a triple strain, at the point of harvesting (after primary 
fermentation) will most of the begginer and middle strain have droppped to 
the bottom, or will there be enough to ensure an even mix in the 
subsequent culture?  
        I think that if I "relax and have a homebrew" while 
I am culturing, all will be fine, but I am interested in any comments 
 people might have.  By the way, the yeast really kicks!

In HBD 1982 (I think), Tracy Thomason asks about the
practical difference in malt liquor and beer/ale.
Paulaner Hefe-Weizen was labelled as "malt liquor".
  
Tracy, are you doing you drinking in the Great State of Texas?
During my time there, I remember drinking the very same beer,
and it was also labelled Malt Liquor back then.  Actually, the
label was overstamped after the fact, with the word "BEER" and
the alcohol content blotted out, and then the new "Malt Liquor"
words were printed next to there!
  
The rule, as I heard at the time but did not see myself
in print in the law books, is that alcoholic malt beverages
like beer that are over 5% alcohol must be labelled as
malt liquor.  Paulaner Hefe-Weizen was 5.1% if I remember
correctly (from there and bottles here).  Hence, you are
not allowed to call it beer.  Ale, stout, malt liquor.
But not beer.
  
It's a ridiculous law that turns the truth-in-labelling
rules on their heads, but I guess it's still a current law.

Subject: Uncl: Homebrewers in Berlin??


  
Jeff Mizener, in HBD 1982, is looking for homebrewers in Germany.
Here's some information about that, for Jeff and whoever else
is interested in joining the ranks of homebrewers in Germany.
  
Yes, there are a few of us here, perhaps not as many as we'd like
to see, but with the cheap, excellent beer available all over out
here, we don't have as much incentive to brew.  Not only that, the
price of apartments is a bit high, and so most people are cramped
for room, a further disincentive.  Then, with fewer homebrewers to
feed the market, there are far fewer homebrew shops here than in
relatively well covered North America, and so fewer people are
introduced to homebrewing, and so...  anyway...
  
A group called Vereinigung der Haus- und Hobbybrauer in Deutschland e.V.
(German Homebrewers Association) promotes homebrewing in Germany.
I'm currently the treasurer, for another week anyway, so I can pass on
a bit of information about it if needed.  We currently have 60-something
members from throughout Germany, with a noticeable concentration in
Franken.  Members get our newsletter, which contains a list of homebrew
suppliers in Germany and information about homebrew activities and
a planned magazine that will come out later this year.
  
We're electing a new Board of Directors in the next week, so the
addresses for information will probably change from those we have
right now.  Members come from all over Germany, and we have no
main office, so the address is wherever the President lives.
Anyone wanting more details in English, send me a personal e-mail
(see address below) and I'll send back info on how to join.
  
My suggestion to Jeff, judging from my own experience as a homebrewer
moving here from the States and then looking for more equipment and
ingredients here in Germany is to try to bring everything you
think you might need.  Everything, all equipment, spare parts, your
brewing pot, grain mill, etc.  It's all much more expensive here,
if you can even find what you want.  (Cascade hops?  Good luck!)
  
Even bring over hops, yeast (if you can) and even malt and malt extract
if your move is paid for.  Hops are surprisingly expensive when you try
to buy them in small, homebrew quantities.  Finding North American and
even English ingredients isn't easy at all, and those are the types of
beers I brew.  (When I want a fresh Helles I step across the street
for better stuff than I ever brewed in the States, and cheaper.)
It's quite feasible, if your German is good enough, to beg malt and
hops and yeast from your local brewmaster, which is what a few of our
members do, keeping in mind that you won't have a big variety of
ingredients to choose from, restricting part of the fun of homebrewing.
(Oh, I miss the dozens of malt types in the States.)
  
Don't forget to register to brew beer once you get here.  You didn't
think you'd be able to do anything fun here without filling out a few
forms, did you?  This is, after all, Germany.  Fonrtunately, rules for
homebrew have been simplified in the last couple of years, so there is
not so much paperwork as before, but you still are required to register
with a simple letter sent to the nearest Hauptzollamt stating where and
when you plan to brew, liters per batch, what the degree Plato (approx)
will be, and (ideally) state that you will not be brewing over 200 liters
  
  
  
  
  
  
per year.  More than that gets complicated, as I found out after spending
an afternoon at the Hauptzollamt-Muenchen-West recently on my quest for
information about homebrew regulations.
  
The good news about brewing here is that the temperatures are generally
pretty conducive to beer brewing.  It's no problem keeping your home
down in the 60's for 8 months out of the year!  During the summer,
cellars still are cold enough for cool ale ferments.  That makes for
nice, clean beer.  Just make sure your ale yeast doesn't go into
hibernation in the cellar in winter.
  
So for anyone in D-land wanting information on brewing, drop me
an E-mail.  Because of constant job hassles, I can't guarantee quick
response, but I'll do my best.

        Your beer may not be infected.  In fact, those little bubbles may 
be the result of continuing fermentation.  I am not familiar with the 
recipie for Brown Ale, but if it contains slow fermenting sugars such as 
honey, it may just be that it is still fermenting.  I am brewing a mead 
(actually, has been fermenting since December) and have experienced 
similar sights and fears.  Al it was was tiny bubbles of CO2 that were 
coming together at the surface.  The best way to tell if it is infected 
is to taste it.  I recommend getting a sterilized turkey baster and 
taking a sampler of your beer.  It would be a pity to throw away a 
perfectly good batch.

All right, I was wrong.  Compatible threads between pin-lock and ball-lock
fittings are the exception rather than the rule - sorry for the miss-info.
I do use a mixed system of ball and pin-lock kegs.  The way I deal with it
is to make all of my lines with threaded nuts to connect to threaded
connectors rather than hose-barb connectors.  That way I can easily use
either type of keg and connector in-line.

FWIW, I've been doing partial mashes with a split brew day for about six
months with excellent results.  I usually mash 2-4 lb of grain and sparge
out to a total of 1-2 gal.  I put the runnings in the fridge in washed
milk jugs until the next day (sometimes 2-3 days), then boil the runnings
plus water plus extract/specialty grains/hops etc as usual for a
full-volume boil.  Why not?  The runnings are nearly sterile when they go
in the milk
jugs, they are then kept cold, and they are boiled again anyway.  This allows
me to concentrate on doing a good job with the mashing and sparging without
worrying about the long brew day ahead.  It also means not tying up an entire
weekend day with brewing and thus avoids BRSD (brewing-related spousal
disapproval).

Subject: Wire Gauges and Circuit Breakers for Electric Boilers


Spencer called my hand with a comment about 15A and 20A circuits "usually"
having the same wire gauge.  He's right, using the word "usually" was overly
optimistic, although it's certainly not unheard-of.  I DID however also
admonish the reader to have their particular situation verified before making
any assumptions, and I REITERATE that point:


*******************************************************************
DON'T ASSUME THAT YOUR 15A CIRCUIT IS 20A-CAPABLE WITHOUT HAVING IT CHECKED
BY A QUALIFIED ELECTRICIAN!!
*******************************************************************


Please also note that my wiring suggestions in the previous post ARE based on
the use of a 20A circuit!!  I said you could try it on a 15A circuit but
you'd probably trip the breaker.  The way I presented it was potentially
confusing, however.  Spencer's concern is apparently that the boiler could
operate in the no-man's land between the 13A max rating and the 15A trip
level, which *is* about where it would end up.  And he's right about the
kitchen wiring being 20A, which *is* good news (in this case, the addition of
a GFI outlet is all that's needed, if there's not one already there).
 Spencer's emphasis of the wire gauge issue is VITAL to the safe operation of
this setup.  I thank him for pointing this out, and I apologize if I confused
or misled anyone.


USE ONLY A 20A MINIMUM RATED CIRCUIT -- WIRING *AND* BREAKER --
FOR THESE ELECTRIC BOILERS !!


There.

What are the thoughts of using a 15+ gallon fish tank as a primary
open fermenter. Or can anyone tell me where to find carboys in the 
10+ gallon range?

Hi, Dan Pack asked about Royal Oak in HBD #1982:


>I thought I detected a hint of oak in this beer.  And that fact, together with
>the name....
>Does anyone know anything about this beer?  Possibly aged in oak?


I have found this beer very toffee-ish in both nose and mouth and also some
pear flavour (and of course lots of hops) but I can't say I have detected
any oak in it. The following recipe comes from a book by a British author
(Roger Protz):


23 litres (final volume), OG 1048, FG 1011, 30 EBU


4 200 g Pale malt
  530 g Crystal malt


In the copper:


  530 g Maltose syrup


42 g Fuggles (90 min)
35 g Goldings (90 min)
10 g Goldings (15 min)
1 tsp Irish moss (15 min)


It's infusion mashed `at` 65 deg C for 90 minutes and Protz suggests a boil
time of 2 hrs but IMO a 90 min boil is enough for most beers. I also
wouldn't be afraid of dry-hopping this beer with some Goldings (even
Styrian).
If anyone tries this, let us know how it was.

DO NOT CHANGE YOUR BREAKERS/FUSES FROM 15 to 20 amps UNLESS YOU ARE
ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT THE ENTIRE CIRCUIT IS 12gauge WIRE!!!!!!!


Passing 20 amps through a 14guage wire will cause the wire to heat
excessively and can start a fire. If the cause of the fire is traced
to this modification your home owners insurance WILL NOT cover any
damages.
