This is strictly a matter of luck.  *Externally* to the user, there are
only four types of connectors:


pin-lock gas, 
pin-lock liquid,
ball-lock gas, and
ball-lock liquid.


*Internally* (the diameter and thread of the fitting as it screws onto the
body of the keg over the dip tube), you have a different story.  There are
6 types (three gas-liquid pairs) of ball-lock "tank plug assemblys" (that's
what Foxx calls them) and 6 types (three gas-liquid pairs) of pin-lock
"tank plug assemblys."  There is only one pair that has common dimensions.


If you are lucky enough to have 9/16-18 threads on your tank then you can
buy the other (pin-lock or ball-lock) type of connector and it will fit.
If you have anything else, you are stuck with the type you have.

Before you started worrying about whether the glass will protect your beer,
I assume you have already checked that your capper can handle the bottles,
right?  Remember that many (primarily imported) Sparkling wine and Champagne
bottles take 29-mm caps and won't work with our standard 1" caps or cappers.
There are cappers that will handle the caps, but I've get to find a source
of the caps in the US.


Regarding the blue glass, no, it will no protect your beer as well as brown
glass, but brown glass is not 100% protection anyway.  If the caps fit, I
would go ahead and use the bottles, but just be *more* careful regarding
exposing them to light.

There are a couple of other reasons you might have undercarbonated beer.
If you are boiling your bottlecaps you may be ruining their linings and
therefore not getting a good seal.  Your capper may be defective (I once
had a customer who could turn the caps after sealing them with a brand
new capper -- obviously I exchanged his capper for another one).  How
much corn sugar are you using?  Since you mentioned Charlie, I suspect
that you are using his method of boiling 3/4 cup of priming sugar in a
cup or two of water for a 5 gallon batch.  If you are using less than
3/4 cup then you may be getting less carbonation that you are used to.
If you are not boiling it in water, then you may be getting poor distribution
and some of the bottles will be overcarbonated -- check the other case.
If you had said that your beer had no head, but it had carbonation, then
the obvious problems would be either not enough malt, too much refined
sugar or a bacterial infection.  How strong is the beer?  If you made a
really strong beer, the yeast may not have the strength to carbonate it.
Finally, are you waiting long enough?  On standard-strength beers, you
should wait at least two weeks, but on stronger beers, it could take a
month or more.

The name comes from a tree that King Charles (don't recall which one)
hid in to escape from some revolutionaries that were busy overthrowing
the Monarchy.  I have tasted this beer and although I like it, I cannot
say that I recall an oaky character in it.  I would, however, like
to point out that Wyeast #1028 London Ale lends a slight woody note to
the beer.  You can get the Royal Oak yeast from the Yeast Culture Kit
Company -- it may be the yeast that is the source of this character.


Now that I think about it, there is an English beer that is aged in oak,
but most certainly this would be well-used, European oak and therefore
would not add much oak character at all.  I'm afraid I can't recall
which brewery it is that uses those oak secondaries.

Subject: Corny Keg and accessory sources


Someone was asking if a dual gauge regulator is better or not and the 
subject came up of costs and sources.  Let me tell you how I got my gear 
and what it costs...


I called a couple of restaurant supply stores in town that sell used 
equipment.  These guys carry everything from bar stools to spatula's and 
everything in between, both new and used.  Here I purchased:


1. Used ball lock Corny keg for $10.00 (lots o'yucky stuff in bottom)
2. Used dual regulator for $10.00 (in great shape)
3. One each in and out fitting for CO2 for $1.00 each


Next stop: Soft drink distributor.  Here I purchased:


1. 3' section of high pressure hose from reg to "in" fitting.  With the 
associated hardware.  $2.00 total cost.


Next stop: Home-brew store.  Here I purchased:


1. Party tap
2. ~5' of low pressure dispensing hose.  Total cost about $6.00


Last stop: Gas distributor.  Here I purchased:


1. Used CO2 tank, full.  ~$40.00




So for around $75.00 I'm setup to keg.

Subject: How to Predict the Terminal Gravity


Does anyone know a good way to predit a recipe's terminal gravity?  I
realize that there are a lot of variables involved (temperature, yeast
attenuation, ingredients, etc.), however there must be a good formula for
making a ballpark estimate.  I've searched all over and can't find one.  The
yeast FAQ has a lot of good stuff, but all of the equations require you to
know the FG.

I was reviewing the Winter '95 Zymurgy and remembered filling out the AHA

to get some feedback on this before I start.  


Please respond with your thoughts, feelings, warnings, encouragement, or

This is very SCARY advice !!  15A circuits are normally wired with 14 gauge wire
, stamped  14/2 and ARE NOT rated for 20A.
 20A circuits will use 12 gauge wire  which will be stamped 12/2 or 12/3 for
split phase (220 V).  Never arbitrarily change the size of a circuit breaker !
it is there to protect you !                        


With so much good advice in the HBD, please be careful in area's outside your

If you can easily slide the elements in and out, then the connectors on the
element probably look like two  eyes (as in hook and eyes). If this is the case,
you could put your heater element in place of your burner ONLY IF IT  IS THE
SAME WATTAGE OR LESS (yelling intended). Putting a bigger element in a circuit
designed for a smaller one is asking for trouble (damage to  your stove, fires
etc).  Get a length of 12 gauge wire (12/2) and strip about 3/4 inch at one end.
Make eyes in the wire the same size as the ones on your stove element. these
should slide into the element with no bare copper showing sticking out of the
connector. Connect the other end of the wire to the element on your boiler, and
there you have it. I would suggest trying this out with water first to get the
hang of the controls.


Good luck

Very wrong!  Pin lock and ball lock threads are not the same.  While
there may be a few pin lock kegs which are compatible with ball
threads, the majority are not.

Does carbonation have any effect on the lagering process?


A hypothetical case:  I have just brewed a German Pilsener. I'm planning
to lager the beer in a corny keg for 4-6 weeks at 34 degrees F.. During 
the final two weeks of lagering, can I hook up my CO2 tank to the keg 
and force carbonate while finishing the lagering? Or, is there some 
benefit to conducting the lagering phase while the beer is flat? I don't
force carbonate by the often used "keg shaking method" but prefer to 
hook up the gas to my refrigerated keg for about ten days.

Subject: IR Technology in Brewing (malting)


 "In #1977 Tom Penn asked about applications for IR technology in
brewing. None come to mind."


There are actually several uses for IR technology in the brewing and
malting industry.  The most useful application is probably the
immediate measurement (30secs.) of total disolved nitorgen in beer
and in malt using either near infered transmission(IRT) or reflexion
(IRR) technology.  The traditonal method (Kjeldahl) takes almost 4 hours
and requires a serious ventilation and caustic setup..  It can also
be reliably used to determine extract and water conent (malt).  The
main advatges of IRT or IRR are the speed and convience (malt or
barley samples can be measured whole), whereas the disadvatges are
accuracy (eg. water content +-1%) and price (roughly $80000).

Since reviving the thread on first wort hopping about a week ago
I have become thoroughly confused by Jim Dipalma's posts in which
he seems to refer to sparge and boil as though they were the same

Is first wort hopping nothing more than adding hops at the start
of the boil (something I have always done)?  Don't we all do that?
If so, then what's all the fuss?

and as usual, ftpmail isn't working.  Has anyone ever had any
luck with ftpmail (as advertised at the beginning of every digest)?
I get a response from ftpmail saying that there are over 3,000
entries ahead of mine in the queue.  The number gets larger with
each request I send, and I conclude that it isn't working.  I
guess I'm just another road kill on the information superhighway.

Subject: First wort hopping and decoction mashes


Jim Dipalma mentions that Dave Draper says that many brewers boil for 15
minutes or so before adding hops.  This is to form the hot break, and
improves utilization, and is most effective for infusion mashes.


In a decoction mash, a lot of the hot-break proteins are left behind in the
mash tun, and the hops are typically added as soon as there is enough wort
to start a boil.  In my case first wort hopping consists of leaving the
flame off under the kettle during the sparge.  


By this argument, when decoction mashing you should subtract the first-wort
hopping from the bittering hops. When infusion mashing, however, you should
not subtract the first-wort hops ( or maybe prorate them) from  the
bittering hops.




Guy Mason asks about kegs and filtering:


I don't, and none of the homebrewers that I know filter their beer either.
Given some time most of the yeast will drop out on their own.  Some of the
brewpubs filter, but they often are serving beer within 2 weeks of brewing
it.  Freshness is good, but I find that the brewpubs that rush their beer
and filter it tend to have lackluster beers.  Maybe they're filtering out
too much, leaving the beer thin.  They're a business, and serving the beer
in 2 weeks rather than 4 allows them to run with half as many fermentors
($$) - not an issue for us homebrewers, to whom money is no object :)

Subject: Advice needed for teaching a beginning homebrew class


     I volunteered to teach a beginning homebrew class for
our local club.  Rather than have two or three sessions, I
am going to have one 2-3 hour session which will cover an
entire extract batch:  from boiling, to chilling, to aeration,
to (simulated) fermentation, to racking, to bottling, to
capping. (Thank you, Don Walworth, for this great idea).


     My major concern is what corners to cut and how to stream-
line my presentation.  For example, it should not be necessary
to boil the extract wort for a full hour---ten minutes should
be enough time to get the idea across.  But should I even
use extract--since the beer will never be fermented, shouldn't
I just use colored water?  And should I even boil the wort?---
if I do, I'll need to use a good amount of time to chill it before
I transfer it to the fermenter.


     As you can see, this is more complicated than it first
appears.  Has anyone out there ever taught a course like this? 
I would greatly appreciate *any* input on this project. Private
email is fine. TIA.

Subject: Water


Clark Ritchie had a couple of questions on water adjustment. He starts by
asking what happens if a certain amount of calcium carbonate is added to
water which is free of calcium and carbonates. Suppose 100 mg of chalk is
put into 1 L of water. The flask or bottle now contains 100mg/L CaCO3 (or
100 ppm) but it probably won't all dissolve. The water will be at a
distressingly high pH. To get it to dissolve and bring the pH to a
reasonable value acid must be added and, as those who have read my stuff
before know, I advocate the use of carbonic acid because this is the way in
which nature gets calcium carbonate into solution and the result is more
likely to approximate the overall balance of a natural water than if
another mineral acid is used. The reaction is


    CaCO3 + H2CO3 --> Ca++ + 2HCO3-


but there are other reactions going on as well so that the water actually
contains Ca++, HCO3-, CO3--, H+, OH- and H2CO3. The relative amounts of
these are controlled by the pH (H+ ion concentration). For pH values less
than 8 the amount of CO3-- present is less than 1% of the total carbonic
species and can thus be neglected. The number of H+ and OH- ions is small
and their difference smaller for the pH range of interest so they can be
neglected. This leaves Ca++ and HCO3- ions as the significant charge
carriers and as the water must be electrically neutral there must be twice
as many bicarbonate ions as calcium ions (calcium carries two positive
cahrges and bicarbonte 1 negative). To calculate the levels using the
example in Clark's post (1 gram chalk in 1 gallon water) start by finding
the amount of chalk per litre: 1000 mg/3.78 litre = 264.6 mg/L. Convert
this to millimoles per litre using the molecular weight of chalk which is
100 (does that give a clue as to why concentrations are often expressed "as
calcium carbonate"?): 264.6/100 = 2.646 mM/L. Each molecule of calcium
carbonate contains 1 atom of calcium and one carbonate ion so that one mole
of calcium carbonate contains one mole of each and we have, thus, 2.646 mM
of Ca++ released into the solution if enough CO2 is bubbled through it to
dissolve all the chalk. If the CO2 is bubbled until the pH reaches about 7
then there must be (2)(2.646) mM/L = 5.298 mM/L bicarbonate. 2.646 came
from the chalk and 2.646 came from carbonic acid. At pH 7 there is
additional carbonic acid in the amount of one quarter of the bicarbonate of
5.298/4 = 1.324 mM/L.
The 2.646 mM/L Ca++ can be reported in that way or the mM/L can be
multiplied by by the  mg/mM for calcium (40) to get (40)(2.646)= 105.8 mg/L
Ca or the 2.646 can be multipled by the mg/L for calcium carbonate (100) to
get 264.6 mg/L Ca as CaCO3 (which is what we started with). For bicarbonate
the molecular weight is 61 so that (5.298)(61) = 323.2 mg/L HCO3-.
Bicarbonate can also be expressed in terms of CaCO3 by multipling by 100.
This gives 529.8 mg/L HCO3- as calcium carbonate. Note that this is twice
the calcium level when it is expressed as calcium carbonate. All this boils
down to: for each mg/L calcium carbonate DISSOLVED with CO2, the resultant
bicarbonate level is 2 mg/L expressed as CaCO3 and .61 mg/L expressed as
bicarbonate. The 1.324 mM/L carbonic are usually expressed in terms of the
CO2 they carry by multiplying by 44, the molecular weight of CO2. This
gives 58.3 mg/L carbon dioxide as carbon dioxide or 132.4 mg/L as calcium
carbonate.


Hardness can be expressed in several ways but where "as calcium carbonate"
is used the hardness does increase 1 mg/L for each mg/L of calcium
carbonate you add. It is also increased by any other calcium salt (gypsum,
calcium chloride) or magnesium (Epsom) salt you add. The total hardness is:
    100*[(mg/L Calcium)/40 + (mg/L Magnesium)/24.31)]

Hello Homebrewers:


Been reading this newsgroup with much interest since last Fall and this

brewing.  One of these days soon I'll better understand some of your 
posts.  I'm very new to brewing, only brewed my second batch last week.  
I've been using LME and DRE along with a grain "teabag" for my batches.  
I'm not quite ready to plunge into the all grain method (probably not 
even the partial mash method).


Can anyone tell me if there's a good recipe out there for a Bass Ale 
clone?  The Cats Meow 3 has three different recipes.  Have any of you 
tried one with any success or is there another one you might recommend 
that's worked well for you?

        According to my Encyclopedia of Beer (BTW I have found to be

Sam Adam's Triple Bock is the strongest lager beer in the world at

Algis Korzonas provided a very good response to the original question, but I'd
like to add a few more pieces of information.  The CGA [Compressed Gas Assoc.]
recommends check valves downstream of all regulators.  I don't know if their
advice has been incorporated into law; but the extra valve is such a
convenience in other applications, I always put one on.  They're also cheaper
to replace than a cylinder valve.


On the subject of two guages, be aware that two stages and two guages are
different concepts.  For many years we had people that assumed that a regulator
with two gauges was a two stage regulator.  Basically a two stage regulator is
two regulators where the output of the first is the input for the second.  They
are used where an even flow of gas is essential.  The bottom line for the home
beer lover is that this is wasted money.  Just another pitfall.

Guy asked for opinions on filtering before kegging:


For the record, I allow all of my beers to fall bright in the secondary before
racking to the keg and force carbonating. For my ales, this is 2-3 weeks and
for the lagers, well by the time they are done lagering, they're clear. I have
almost no sediment in my kegs when the batch is done. 


So, for me and my beer, no filtering is needed. I dont see a need for finings
either. I may have a small amount of chill haze, but by and large, my beer is
clear. I remember Jim Busch commenting on his use of finings and planning on
using filtration. But Jim likes "Cask Conditioned Real Ale" which is consumed
only 2 wks or so after pitching. It really is a wholly different way of
producing and serving beer so fining and filtering are part of that
Style/Method. You see what I am saying? 


**
I have been meaning to thank AJ for posting his data on copper dissolution in
water and his beer. When Kelly responded to my post asking for hard data and
the reasons, I thought to myself, "Good Questions, I intuitively know why, but
I am not sure how to explain it, and dont have any measurements to illustrate
it."


And then AJ came along and saved me the trouble. Yea! So just to summarize:
Copper will have a different Ionization Constant for each solvent (water or
wort or beer), depending on the chemistry of the solvent. Distilled water which
has no metal ions in it will be vary aggressive to a metal until the
equilibrium contstant for that metals ions in solution is reached. As AJ
illustrated with his Brewing Water Synthesis posts last year, the solubility of
various salts ie. ions, is influenced by all of the ions present. My point in
my earlier post on copper vs Wort was that the chemistry of wort was not
usually aggressive to copper. And AJ was able to collaborate this.

With spring & summer just around the corner (for the

This is true and exemplifies the fact that mutation is generally not a
problem with brewers' yeast. I remember reading somewhere that the Samuel
Smith's Brewery has been using the same culture for over 100 years!

Performance in the brewery is probably the best way to monitor yeast
quality. Unfortunately, one can produce a bad batch of beer before noticing
that something has gone wrong.

Yeast does not suddenly mutate after three generations in the brewery. The
'3 generation rule' is arbitrary and basically makes little sense. I
consider it to be a paranoid, over-kill safety measure somebody just dreamed
up. Contamination from wild yeasts or bacteria is an entirely different
problem from the selection of a mutant brewing strain, and thus should be
handled as a separate problem.


>As far as mutations, it depends on the strain of yeast and how much you

True, mutation rates are somewhat strain dependent, however "stress" doesn't
necessarily induce mutations and it's incorrect to assume that all mutants
will have greater fitness under a particular set of conditions and will thus
be selected. The vast majority of mutants won't dominate the population and
many are lethal, thus instantly self-destructing. While it's true that high
gravity worts stress the yeast, the main reason this yeast usually isn't
repitched is that high concentrations of alcohol weaken the yeast and one
should never start a fermentation with a weak culture.


>Lager yeasts are more prone than ale yeasts.

Are you sure about this (both statements, particularly the first)? Can you
provide a reference please? (I'm a skeptic, sorry.) From what I understand,
most strains of brewers' yeast are quite stable genetically.

Based solely on the size of the genome and the error rate of DNA polymerase,
there is probably at least one point mutation in every daughter cell!
Mutations are extremely common in nearly all species, however, most
mutations are neutral or 'silent', meaning they have no observable effect.
However, your point is well taken; problems developing from mutant yeast are
probably infrequent.


>What Tam is referring to is more appropriately termed "genetic drift".
[snip some theory]


Genetic drift can be defined in very simple terms. It's basically the same
as sampling error (a statistical term). The smaller a population is, the
larger the potential effect of genetic drift. For example, if you pick a
single colony from a plate, you've sampled a very small subset from the
larger population, thus altering the genotype of the subsequent population
through sampling error (i.e. by selecting an unrepresentative sample from
the population). Evolutionary biologists think of genetic drift and mutation
rates as the two main forces providing the raw material needed for natural
selection to do its thing (i.e. drive evolution). It's important to note
that genetic drift and natural selection are two entirely different concepts.

This really depends on whether one is trying to develop a clone or to
maintain some level of diversity. I agree, however, if you want more
diversity, it would be better not to pick a single colony.


Getting back to the original question: >"wondering if anyone can profile the
flavor, behavior, or appearance of "mutated" brewers yeast."...
Two of the more common yeast mutations occuring in the brewhouse result in
the loss of the ability to ferment melibiose and the loss of floculation. In
the first case, one might observe higher than normal terminal gravities, in
the second, cloudiness from the suspended yeast. I don't think homebrewers
need to worry about mutations. Contamination is potentially a much bigger
problem when 'recycling' yeast cultures.

I've done this with several recent batches now, basically following George's

The improved aroma is unmistakable.

I think that would really depend on the hops you're using. For example, in
George's posts he described using Columbus hops for first wort hopping. With
such a high alpha acid cultivar, I think the bittering contribution would be
quite significant indeed! However, since this method is generally seen as a
'Pilsener procedure', if you're using Saaz, it might not be so critical.

I've used the first wort hopping method in several recent beers so we should
