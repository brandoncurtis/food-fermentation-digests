Subject: Summary of EasyMasher Responses


Thanks to all for the very helpful responses!  A special thank you to Dan
Listermann ( the manufacturer of my Phalse Bottom and Sparge Arm) for taking the
time to evaluate my use of his products unsolicited.  Here are some tips I
received on the EasyMasher (which I have not decided whether or not to
purchase):

My conclusion (I'm still looking forward to Mr. Listermann's opinion) is that my
problem may lie in the temp of the sparge water.  I've been boiling all water
prior to mashing, then putting in a heavily insulated plastic bucket until
sparging.  Bucket temp is 170 to 168 at the start, but exit temp may be lower,
and may fall substantially during the sparge.  I will also try Mr. Fix's
schedule rather than my 122 (20min)/152-156 (60 min)/170 (10 min) schedule.


I am very happy with the mechanics of the Phalse Bottom -- I get clear runoff in
5-10 minutes, and have only gotten a stuck sparge twice when I wasn't paying
attention and let the water level fall too much.  By the way, I have absolutely
no afilliation with Listermann manufacturing or Mr. Listermann.  I am, however,
very interested in the effect of hot side aeration since I have simply been
dumping my grains into the lauter tun after filling the tun w/ water 1" over the
bottom.  I am also interested the process of whirlpooling the wort after
chilling to drop hops and trub.  E-mail responses would be appreciated.


Thanks for the info!

Subject: Re: Calories Revisited


This probably will not help solve any questions on this matter but I =
thought I would ramble on about the subject a little.  First of all, it =
seems logical that the lower the final gravity, the fewer the calories.  =
I come to this conclusion by looking at what a gravity reading really =
measures.  This would be sugar content, right?  Sugar is a primary =
source of energy for many animals.  The brain and nervous system must =
use glucose for energy, and without sugars we could not completely =
metabolise fat (just for starters).  I will not get into the trace =
elements and vitamins and all that mess but we get approximately 60% of =
our calories from carbohydrates, which are starches and sugars.  Sugars =
have about 4 kcals per gram whether it comes from corn, wheat, barley, =
honey, whatever.


As far as alcohol is concerned, your muscles, etc. cannot use it as an =
energy source, but alcohol does have about 7 kcals per gram.  It is =
treated as a drug which is to be distroyed.  About 20% is absorbed from =
the stomach, the remainder in the small intestine.  Having food in the =
stomach, less alcohol will be able to reach the stomach lining (decrease =
rate of absorption), you will get a delay in stomach emptying (decrease =
rate of absorption in small intestine), and you will stimulate enzymes =
that can begin to break down the alcohol.  Drinking on an empty stomach =
will make the alcohol go to your head more rapidly. About three percent =
passes out the body unchanged through breath , persperation and urine.  =
The remainder goes to the liver where liver enzymes act to detoxify it.  =
If consumed faster than the liver can handle it, alcohol builds up in =
the bloodstream and will begin to have effects on the brain (Surprise).  =
I'm only guessing here, but I would think that the calories taken in by =
beer can be negated by a fraction because of the calories burned in =
order to detoxify the alcohol and possibly some extra heat given off as =
well as other factors ( I use negated because I want to only consider =
beer and not the ten slices of pizza you had for dinner).  Of course, if =
you use this philosophy, you will probably just consume alot of hard =
liquer in stead of going on a diet.  I'll end with a nice bit of trivia. =
 A six pack of beer has the caloric equivalent of about ten slices of =
bread (this would be a typical US beer like budweiser or something).  =
The average number of alcoholic drinks that college students with "A" =
averages cunsume is 3.5 per week.  The average number of alcoholic =
drinks that college students with "D" or "F" averages is 11 per week.  I =
got this info in a nutrition class I had while at N.C. State.

Subject: Electric Boilers -- Please Read This


I feel I must pause in my development and reporting of the Electric Brewery
for a moment and regroup.  The attractiveness of electric boilers is
definitely offset by the safety issues at hand, and a couple hastily-made
comments of mine haven't helped.  Safety is and must be of PRIME concern; as
Jeff Hewitt pointed out in HBD1983, none of this brewing stuff is worth dying
for, or having a fire or other damage ensue.


It's easy for someone like me who has played with electrons nearly all his
life to easily and successfully rig up a safe working system, and it's just
as easy for me to overlook the fact that someone with less knowledge in the
field may put their enthusiasm ahead of safety and prudence.  The Electric
Brewery is not difficult to safely create, but if you lack the knowledge or
experience, or are new to dealing with house-current wiring projects, please
DON'T DO IT!!  I know that many readers who have been interested in creating
such a system do possess the required skills and safety-mindedness, but many
more don't.  There is help available.  If you build the vessels mechanically
(mount but do not hook up the elements, for example), you can hire an
electrician to wire it up neatly and safely for you, and to inspect your
house wiring for comapatibility.  Sure, it'll cost money, but it's a
worthwhile investment in peace of mind.


We homebrewers are by definition "do-it-yourselfers".  How much talent we
have for different aspects of the job varies.  That's why the Digest is what
it is -- a repository of idea exchange to help bolster our individual weak
spots and to help round out our mastery of this hobby.  Any of you who have
corresponded privately with me know me to be naturally inquisitive and eager
to share my experiences.  While the Electric Brewery is certainly not my
original idea, I felt that my brewery was a success and that I could offer
some helpful tips based on things I learned while building mine.  However, in
my enthusiasm I spoke out of turn, but fortunately people were paying
attention and raised a flag.  I am happy to provide information about how I
built my system, but not at the risk of encouraging someone with inadequate
skills to rig up a death machine.


BTW the "Pail Ale" that I brewed in the Electric Brewery last week is shaping
up very nicely, with no plastic character whatsoever.  The water treatment I
used definitely lent a dry, crisp character to the hops.  As the beer
finishes and matures I'll post an update.


Please brew safely!

I'm curious.  Since most yeast strains claim to be cultured from a 
single cell (and we are taught to do that when propogating yeast), and 
since yeast reproduction is via budding rather than sexual 
reproduction, how do we get yeast which are not genetically identical 
without mutation?  I'm not trying to be a smart-aleck, just hoping that 
someone with more understanding of genetics than my 20 year old college 
memories can shed some light.

Hallo all,
there have been discussions in the HBD about beer/brewing software for the
Macintosh. So far I have kept my mouth shut because I was working on an
update of a HyperCard stack that I wrote a while back. However, now it's
"finished" and version 1.1 is available (see below). For those of you who
can obtain MacFormat (a UK mag) you can check out version 1.0 on the March
issue cover disc / CD-ROM. The BeerStack 1.1 (the name of the program) can
be downloaded from most Info-Mac sites. It's called The BeerStack but it's
archived as /info-mac/art/beer-11-hc.hqx; 145K. If you use some kind of
search-engine you'll find it if you search for "beer-11-hc.hqx". I hope
someone on the digest finds it interesting.
If you have any questions just E-mail me:

This may be true, but that brewer doesn't know that the odds are against
him.  Most mutations are undesirable.  Natural selection was covered very
nicely in Domenic's post (that's a keeper).
 
>All brewers have their own methods of monitering their yeast. Some go by the

Good point, but I feel you could elaborate on it.  It is my understanding
(I'm no microbiologist) that the most common mutations are (in no particular
order):


* losing the ability to reabsorb diacetyl,
* losing the ability to ferment some sugars,
* losing the ability to flocculate, and
* respiratory deficient (RD) mutants -- aka "Petit Mutants" (this mutation
  exhibits itself as some combination of the first three... I don't recall
  which).


As you can see, none of these are particularly appealing mutations.  This is
why Bob points out that you need to watch the yeast's performance and if
something starts to increase or decrease suddenly, you should toss the yeast
and start from stratch (or a master, if you've got it).

Actually, we are probably cleaner than most commercial setups (we have far
less to sanitize and we can see into or even through all of our equipment...
except for maybe our counterflow chillers, which is partly why I use an
immersion chiller), it's just that they pitch far more yeast than us and a
small infection will take quite a few batches to become noticable.  There are
a couple of brewpubs that I've visited, at which they were serving severely
infected beer (lactic acid bacteria).  Every beer had the problem.  One had a
darn good Berliner Weiss, though...  What I'm trying to point out here is
that many brewpubs reuse yeast more than they should.


As for us homebrewers and how many generations are safe, it depends a lot on
your system and how well you keep to good sanitation procedures.  Some
homebrewers I know could probably go 20 or 30 generations without a problem.
Others, should probably start with a new package of Wyeast each time.  I'm
somewhere in the middle, but my problem is that I use so many different yeasts
and brew such a variety of styles that I rarely use the same yeast twice in
one month.  I just build up 2 liter starters from slants or liquid yeast
packages as I need them.  Lately, I've been brewing less than I want to and
I've got three yeasts that I should either use or dump soon!  I've been
feeding them weekly, but that's an invitation for infection too.  Every
time I open the flasks, I'm risking contamination.

I had not heard that about lager yeasts or Weizen yeasts.  Could you point
to a reference?  I think that the Weizen yeast problem may be due to
rumours started about the Wyeast #3056 Bavarian Weizen (which is a blend of
two yeasts -- I think that with age, the clove-producing yeast pooped-out).


It has been posted to HBD many times that Chico Brewing Company has said
that they reuse the yeast from all their beers except the Sierra Nevada
Celebration Ale and Bigfoot Barleywine-style Ale because the high alcohol
content tends to increase the risk of mutation.

Well... polypropylene is 2.5 times *more* oxygen-permeable than high density
polyethylene, which is notorious for being oxygen-permeable.  However, you
need to consider thickness and surface area too.  If you are debating between
3 mil polyethylene bags (Freezer bags) and 1/8" polypropylene containers,
you can clearly see that the thick PP would be better than the PE film.  Can't
you use the packages in which the hops came?  Virtually all suppliers now
are selling their hops in oxygen-barrier bags.  You can buy a heat sealer
these days for less than $20.  Or what about glass?  Glass would be far
better than either PP or PE.

I have been brewing for a few years now, and mostly do a partial

Homebrewers needn't be humble about their sanitation -- they can often be
*cleaner* than a commercial setup.  First, a homebrewery is staffed with far
more conscientious and motivated personnel than the average mid- to large
size brewery <g>.  I use caustic, an acid sanitizer and boiling water on all
my equipment at home and I know of others who do too.  (Well, I don't put
acid on the copper equipment or boiling water on the glass, but you get the
idea.)


I agree with the 3 generations rule of thumb for most situations, so this is
not a flame, criticism or correction, it's just part of the Homebrew Pride
Manifesto.  We're not called ARB's for nothin'


My method / experience:  When I pitch the yeast from a mason jar into the
carboy, I leave a half inch or so of slurry in the jar.  Then I put cool
wort back into the mason jar as well as in the main fermenters, so that I
propagate more yeast in the mason jar for the next batch.  I've been doing
this for the last dozen batches over the past six months.  Just like most
other breweries, pico- to mega-, there must be some contamination, but it
hasn't appeared in the flavour yet.  (I did have a problem on one batch from
another source.)  I'll start a new yeast soon, before the bugs _do_ catch up
with me.

Subject: Why build up starters?


Hello all - I am wondering about the practice of building up yeast 
starters into ever increasing volumes of wort (ie 500ml->1000ml->2000ml). 
Why not just pitch the few cells into the large volume to begin with, and 
do away with the steps in the middle? I would have thought, aside from 
maybe a longer lag time, the yeast will multiply up to the limit of the 
available nutrient, and it would be easier to just make up the desired  
volume of starter and leave it at that. None of the books I've read make 
any mention of the reason for "steps". Any ideas?

Subject: Pressure Gauges


I read some confusing things in recent articles...Several people have said
that a second gauge on a regulated tap system is useless until the CO2
tank is almost empty. I don't understand why the gauge is not continuously
dropping as the contents of the tank are depleted. How can the pressure
exiting the tank remain constant until it's almost empty, then suddenly drop?
It seems to me that since the tank volume is constant, and the number of
CO2 molecules is decreasing, the pressure must also decrease. PV=nRT.
Welding tanks (oxy-acetelene) use a second gauge to monitor tank contents....
Someone please let me know what I may be missing. I currently don't use
a second gauge on my regulator, but I plan to add one, so I'm very interested
in a response....Thanks to anyone who helps me straighten out my confusion!

Subject: Bad to be a glad plaid clad lad...


In HBD 1983, Domenick Venezia aptly warns brewers not to wear plaid due to
detrimental effects observed in yeast culturing.


As a matter of fact, recent government studies has shown this to be true. Worts
fermented by all except for the hardiest Scottish Ale strains demonstrated
signs of disfunctional yeast when exposed to various plaid patterns. Even
Scottish strains could only tolerate the best tartans.


Studies indicate that the plaid need not be in line-of-sight to the fermenter
for the abherrations to manifest themselves. It was discovered that the
reaction to concealed plaid boxer shorts was equal to that of exposure to plaid
table cloths; though less that the effects observed from exposure to plaid
pants.


Studies also indicate that the detrimental effects of plaid are mitigated if
the pattern is printed on good, heavy flannel shirts of sensible colors, worn
by beard bearing brewers.


Microscopic investigation has revealed myriad yeast having ruptured cell walls
following even the shortest exposure to bright green and red plaid pants.
Exposure to the same pattern on double knit materials has been shown to reduce
the yeast to a viscous goo having no resemblance to the yeast from whence it
came. Surviving yeast appears to be unable for process even the simplest
sugars, and immediately flocculates upon pitching; some continuously rising and
falling, seeming to bump off the bottom of the fermenter only to rise back to
the top and repeat.


Electron microscoice scans have revealed pained, laughing expressions on the
faces of the deceased yeast. Surviving yeast, not surprisingly, bear
expressions similar to those seen in human beings afflicted by catatonia.


The American Civil Liberties Union has a suit pending against the yeast for
insensitivity to the chromatically challenged. However, until yeast learns to
be more politically correct in their reactive patterns, it is advised that the
chromatically challenged restrict themselves to monochromatic outfits (colors
selected from the gray scale are recommended to assure no inadvertent clashes)
to avoid problems with fermentation.


We now return you to your normally scheduled reading...

Subject: CO2/Triple Strain


While I'm sure this is in a FAQ somewhere Dave Harsh's post on CO2 makes it
look as if a review of this subject is timely. CO2 is delivered and stored
as a liquid as long as it is below the critical tempature (31C/89F). The
delivery trucks often are marked "liquid carbonic" and they have
arrangements which ensure that the temperature is kept below the critical
temperature. The fact that the critical temperature (the temperature above
which the gas cannot exist as a liquid) is exceded on a warm summer's day
may be responsible for some of the confusion over this.


The pressure read on the tank guage attached to a CO2 bottle is the
saturated varpor pressure of liquid CO2 at the temperature of the liquid.
At 70F this is 853 psi and that is why the guage reads somewhere around
that level at room temperature. There is a simple test which can be used to
determine whether the a bottle contains liquid. Draw some gas off gradually
and see if the pressure drops. If the bottle contains liquid it will not
(unless the gas is drawn off so fast that the liquid cools to a temperature
with a lower vapor pressure). The liquid will simple boil as its vapor is
drawn off. If the bottle contains gas the pressure will drop linearly with
the amount of gas drawn off. When the pressure guage on your bottle begins
to drop, therefore, it is indicative that the liquid is all gone and you
are "running on fumes" as the aviators used to say. Time for a refil. On
the hot summers day, conversely, the pressure read by the guage will be
over 1000 psig (if there was liquid in the bottle at room temperature) and
will gradually decline over the course of the afternoon as the liquid level
in your kegs declines and/or as the day cools. As the temperature drops
below 89F the gas will recondense to a liquid.


Refill is done from a "siphon" bottle. This is a bottle with a tube running
from the valve stem to the bottom of the cylinder. The target bottle should
be colder than the source bottle. When the target bottle is connected to
the source bottle gas in the source bottle pushes liquid CO2 into the
target bottle through the connectic hose. At first this liquid condenses
cooling the target bottle somewhat. Now you have liquid in both bottles but
the target bottle is colder so the vapor pressure is lower and liquid from
the warm source bottle will continue to flow until the pressure in the head
space is higher than the vapor pressure in the source bottle. Bottles are
(or should be) filled to weight. In most cases the operator goes through
the process described above and shuts off when the flow stops. You get 2-4
pounds of CO2 is a 5 pound bottle depending on how warm your bottle was
when you brought it in and how much liquid is left in the siphon bottle. To
get the maximum fill bring in a cold bottle. This is hard to do if you have
to travel any distance. Leave it in the bed of your pickup in winter. In
the summer dont leave it in a closed car all morning and then go to the
fill station at lunch. I put the empty cylinder in the freezer overnight.
In the morning I take it out, let it cover with frost and immediately fill
it. A couple of seconds after the flow stops the warm liquid from the
siphon will melt the frost up to the fill level and you can see how much is
in the bottle. With a little experience you learn the 5 pound level. One of
the neatest bits I picked up from the internet was the suggestion that you
can tell how much liquid is left in your CO2 bottle using this same idea.
Put it in the freezer overnight and bring it out in the AM. It will frost
over. In this case the frost will melt above the liquid level first as the
CO2 in this case is colder than room temperature.


A fill station operator determined to give 5 pounds will weigh your bottle
before and after filling. If you didn't get 5 pounds he would chill the
bottle and repeat the process until there are 5 pounds of liquid in there.
I have yet to hear of such an individual. It is, of course, possible to get
5.5# into a 5# bottle (I've never done this but I did get > 2.5 # into a
2.5 # bottle). As soon as the bottle warms up the pressure relief valve
blows making enough noise to frighten wives, dogs and small children.
Perhaps gas supply houses are more likely to give a complete fill than the
bar owner or bar supply shop. This could be verified by weighing cylinders
empty and full (i.e. when you get a new one and after it is empty: most of
the gas houses swap you a full bottle for your empty rather than refilling
your bottle). They may be using more elaborate filling apparatus with
automatic shutoff at target weight.

Victor Farren asked about use of a purloined triple strain culture. The
fact that the "strength" of the individual strains peaks at different times
in the course of the fermentation does not mean that their flocculation
properties are different. Nor does it imply that they are the same. As
Domenick Venizia pointed out in his excellent posting in #1983 (thank you!)
each strain will have members with short, middle and long flocculation
times. I would think that the best thing to do would be to top crop in the
middel of the cropping period so as to be sure of having some cells from
each of each of the three strains. Now the tough part which is going to be
a lot of work. Dilute way down to single cell level and make multiple
plates. Harvest lots of single cell colonies, grow them up on slants and
make mini brews watching, measuring and tasting very carefully. You should
get "beers" in three distinct groups distinguishable by taste, aroma, pH,
time to form kraeusen, time to flocculate, degreee of flocculation, color
etc. If you are really, really lucky you may be able to distinguish the
yeasts by morphology. I expect that only an expert could do that though.
Anyway, at this point you have separated the three strains, can maintain
them separately and blend starters made from them when you brew. Doubtless
more trouble than it is worth.

Don't even think about it. Or if you do, for your own sake don't tell anyone 
you're doing it. Distillation is quite illegal (at least in the US and 
Canada), the primary reason for which is that it is potentially harmful. 
The stakes are much higher for distillation than fermentation. To wit, if 
you screw up your beer, it tastes bad; if you screw up a distilled beverage, 
it could kill you (or at least make you good and sick). In fact, a friend of 
mine who runs a wine supply shop was once visited by the police, who 
told her that if anyone ever came in even asking about distillation she 
was to notify the authorities immediately. She hasn't, of course (I 
don't think merely thinking about distilling is illegal yet), but this 
shows how seriously this law is being taken. I've even heard horror 
stories about police raids on private houses where distillation was 
taking place.
In short, leave that still alone. During prohibition, people were far 
more interested in booze at any cost than safety, and I doubt your 
friend's grandfather's still has aged well. However, if you really want 
distilled/fortified beverages, do not despair; there are other, safer 
ways to do it. The first option is freeze distillation. According to 
Dennis Davison's eisbock article in Zymurgy (winter 1995), freezing beer or 
wine and removing the non-alcoholic ice crystals that form is not legally 
distillation but "fractional crystallisation", and is perfectly 
above-board. The other option is fortification. I have made brandy, 
port, and sherry by adding a bottle of grain alcohol or vodka to the 
appropriate type of wine.
I hope this advice is helpful, even if it is not what you wanted to hear. 
Trust me, I can sympathise. A friend and I were all gung-ho on the idea 
of distillation and building a still a few months back (he's a soil 
scientist and has access to all the parts we would have needed), but 
after a little research we realized it just wasn't worth the risk. We 
homebrewers love to play with new gadgets, but I don't think a still 
should be one of them.

John, a few things to consider first.


1)  Use a brand new one (this seems self evident but I thought I'd mention it)


2)  Do NOT pour any hot liquid at all into the tank.  Make sure your wort
is down to pitching temperature.  I can think of two reasons.


        o The glass is very very likely to crack.
        o The glass panes in a tank are held together with a kind of non-toxic
        caulking.  Heating it could weaken it.  It could, perhaps, cause it to
        leech into your beer.  Yuck!


3)  Once its full of liquid, you can't move it.  Moving a full fish tank
will weaken the joins and cause it to leak.


4)  Make sure that the caulking inside *IS* rated safe for food.  Make sure
that the acidic wort won't break down the caulking.


On the other hand, I purchased a 20 gallon food grade Rubbermaid bucket
from a restaurant supply store quite in-expensively a few years ago.  Its
sturdy, crack resistant, great for soaking bottles in, moveable (though you
have to be careful when its full....20 gallons of water or wort is VERY
heavy).  It makes a fantastic primary for large batches.  It was certainly
less expensive than a 20 gallon fish tank and no worries of
breakage/melting caulking/leeching.


Cheers!
Matthew

So everyone knows how hard it is to brew your first all-grain batch after
brewing with extract. But what about your first extract batch after brewing
strictly all-grain???


How do you lauter an extract brew? I had problems with the sparge going too
fast and the mash seemed... let's just say a little thin.


Where is the actual grain??? I couldn't find it in the lauter-tun. Did it
simply "go to Vegas" or something?


Also, packet yeast (5 gram packet of High quality English Ale)... I couldn't
break the inner seal and it never swelled up like wyeast does. Is this a
problem???


**********On a serious note I was showing someone how to brew their first
beer with an extract kit and I found that after brewing with an all-grain
regiment for many many years I really have no idea how to brew with an
extract (I know it seems easy, but I'm a creature of habit). I just kept
feeling that I was missing something with all those grain procedures missing
from the brewing process***********

Here is an interesting way to determine what material your pennies are made

Flip the penny in the air (spinning them end-over-end as fast as possible).
If you hear a ringing sound it is a pre'82 penny therefore weighs 3 grams.
If you don't hear anything than it is a post'82 penny weighing 2.5 grams.

Yesterday, I said (based on what my gas cylinder supplier told me) that CO2

frost line if he takes his CO2 tank out of the fridge and lets it warm up.
Since I couldn't think of anything besides a liquid level that could cause
it, I asked our supplier to fax me a spec sheet.  The description starts
off as follows:


"A colorless, liquified, high pressure gas shipped at its vapor
pressure...some research grades are shipped at reduced pressures"


Al K. was right on target.  If you do decide to weigh your cylinders
remember that only about 25% of the total weight is the gas so you need to
be accurate.
