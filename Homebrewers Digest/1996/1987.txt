Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...                                  
                                                                                
Many, many, many, many people have been asking about two day brew days lately.  
The answer to your query is, simply, yes. Yes, you can extend the brew day      
over two days. Here are the conditions:                                         
                                                                                
  1.) Your sanitation/cleanliness MUST be impeccable.                           
  2.) Your mash out must be of sufficient temperature and duration to           
      denature your mash enzymes.                                               
  3.) Your sanitation/cleanliness MUST be impeccable.                           
  4.) The storage conditions must inhibit any beasties that were in the wort    
      or were introduced during the transfer to the storage vessel with which   
      your sanitation/cleanliness was impeccable.                               
                                                                                
You'll note SANITATION, SANITATION, SANITATION!!! The number-one risk to the    
method is infection. The number two risk is that the enzymes continue on        
during storage. Other than that? Have at it!

Subject: Re: Alt Recipe correction


Mark--
Yesterday, I reviewed my best Duesseldorfer Altbier recipe and realized
that my memory failed me.  I will Cc this to the HBD.  Note that when I
brewed the recipe below, I fermented at 63F and it was a little too
fruity.  The Duesseldorfer Altbiers I tasted were a little fruity but
not as fruity as this beer when fermented at 63 F with Wyeast #1338.






The recipe for 5 gallons should be:


8.5#  Munich malt (I used DeWolf-Cosyns, you can also use German malts)
0.75# DeWolf-Cosyns *Aromatic* malt
3 ounces of Spalt hops (4.1% AA, pellets, boiled 60 min in a hop bag)
Wyeast #1338


Mash at 140 F for 30 minutes and then 156 F for 1 hour.
Take 7.5 gallons of runnings and boil it down to 5.125.


OG = 1.053
FG = 1.012


Use a big starter and ferment at 60 degrees F.
The above hop rate is assuming no skimming or blowoff removal.


Lager for four weeks at 40 degrees F.


Before I go, let me explain the Aromatic malt.  I used that in an effort
to compensate for the fact that I was not going to do a decoction mash.
DWC Aromatic malt is kind of a "dark Munich" and is about 25 Lovibond.
I added it an effort to get a little more of that richness in the malt
profile.  I feel that it worked.  If you were to actually do a decoction
mash, I would just use 9 pounds of Munich malt.


Prosit!

And anything -not- above that strength cannot be labelled "ale", which is 
why Celis' Pale Ale is called a Pale Bock.  It's an ale, but you can't call
it that in Texas.


fwiw, I've had several Weizens in Chicago labelled "Malt Liquor".


> Greg also asks about hangover cures....
> Fructose....


I hadn't heard that one yet.  I'll have to try it.  Are there natural foods
which are high in fructose?


The best things for hangovers are usually "night before" things.  Have some 
B-vitamins.  The dregs from bottle-conditioned beer are full of'em.  Drink a
lot of water, and have a little food before going to bed.  Aspirin before
sleeping helps, too, even if you don't yet have a headache.  


This is probably covered a lot, but there are several sources of hangovers.
Dehydration is a big one, and easy to 'cure', beforehand.  Fusel alcohols are
very hard to deal with.  Vitamin B deficiency is another one like dehydration,
and very important to deal with - most alcohol-related brain damage, both long
and short term, is from vitamin B deficiency.  


Another thing, in the morning after, drinking a lot of fluids and peeing a
lot are a real good idea.  But, when you're dehydrated, be careful about 
drinking just water.  When you get really dehydrated, water alone can dehydrate
you further.  I think it has something to do with osmotic pressure.  Something
with a little higher SG, like juice or non-diet soda or milk (if your highly
lactose tolerant) can help.  Or, water with a little food, if the food is 
soluble.  I think a little bit of salt can help you retain water, too.  (This
might be getting into the "eye of newt" category here...)

How many grams of carbohydrate become how many grams of ethanol during 
fermentation?  


Also, I've always been a bit suspicious of the caloric content of alcohol.
I know that it contains calories of energy, but is it energy that your body
can use?  For example, insoluble carbohydrates (dietary fiber, wood pulp, etc)
have a caloric content, technically, but you can't use them, so they don't 
have any calories in a dietary sense.  I don't think that we use none of the
calories in alcohol, but I suspect we may use less than all of them.  I 
welcome any correction on my suspicion.  


You notice how many of us have a beer gut, but no one ever gets a whiskey 
gut.  Granted, we get more of the residual sugars than they do, but I know 
people who drink a lot more whiskey than I do beer, and they don't bulge 
like me.  Maybe they exercise more?

Try something Belgian, they ferment many ales warm.  I'll send you a recipe in
private e-mail.  It's all-grain.


> Subject: Electric elements, wiring


All this talk of hooking a heater element to the connections on your stove
or laundry chute.  Um, this is not a real good idea.  Your best bet is to
build a seperate power supply for your heater element, with it's own 
transformer and it's own fuse.  American Science and Surplus has tons of 
120V - 240V transformers of various amperage rating.  Also - if you haven't
done electrical stuff before, find someone who has to help.  (And, yeah, the
12 guage thing, don't forget that.)

Actually, the sugars in honey are pretty fast fermenting - meads ferment slowly
due to lower nutrient levels and the Crabtree effect, I thought.  But, you're
right - his "infection" is probably not an infection.

Instead of messy around with your current electrical wiring and possibly
screwing something up, why don't you just install a new 220 volt circuit
that you can devote exclusively to your brewing.  Most newer electrical
boxes have empty slots for new circuit breakers and a 20 amp-220 volt
breaker can be had for less than $20.  These things are usually easily
installed by someone who knows a bit about electrical installation, but if
you are unsure of yourself, you should get someone in who knows what they
are doing.  A bit of 12 gauge wire and a 220 volt outlet and you have an
exclusive setup in your basement for brewing.  The downside to this would be
the difficulty in installing this outlet in your kitchen (running the wires
into the walls).  However, if your basement ceiling (where your electrical
panel is located) is not finished, it should be a simple operation to run
the wiring into your kitchen.  It isn't as hard as you might think.  I have
run cable connections up through the basement ceiling and into a wall in the
kitchen in a similar manner.  The hardest part was making the hole in the
wall to put the utility box for the outlet (which wasn't that hard). By
doing this, you can make sure that your 220 volt circuit is rated properly
and you won't have to worry about burning down your house.

Subject: 1st 10 gal batch questions


Dear collective: 
I recently decided that brewing 10 gal. batches would not be much more of a 
PITA than 5 gal. The jury is still out. I'm getting some kinda funny gravities 
as the fermentation proceeds. Your analysis and observations would be most 
welcome. The batch was a "hellesbier" ale. 
grain bill:
21.5# German Pilsner
5.0# German light Crystal (5.5L)
0.5# German Munich
Calculated o.g. 1.076, Calculated f.g. 1.020 (Brewer's Assistant version 2.1)
Water analysis: Ca++ 32 ppm, Mg++ 7 ppm, SO4-- 51 ppm, Cl- 22 ppm
All grains milled with a "Valley Mill" at approximately 0.040" gap. Good 
grist.
I used 30 Qts. water (1.11:1 ratio). Strike temp `at` 130f = mash at 124f for 30 
min.
Removed 3 gal of thick mash. raised to boil over 30 min. Boiled 15 min. 
Retrurned to mash tun (10 gal. Gott with a Phil's Phalse bottom). Mash temp 
146f. Added 2 tsp. Amylase enzyme. 2 hour rest (final mash temp 140f). Removed 
3 gal. thick mash. Heated to boil over 30 min. Boiled 15 min. Returned to mash 
tun. Mash temp 156f. Added 2 tsp. Amylase enzyme. 2 hour rest. Final mash temp 
152f. Good Iodine test. No mash out. Recirculated first runnings until clear 
(approx. 1.5 gal.) Sparge with 170f water. Collected 34 qts. first runnings 
1.092 gravity. Collected 12 qts. last runnings 1.032 gravity. Combined first 
and last runnings. Gravity 1.076. Raised volume to 12 gal. Split boil, 8 gal. 
on propane burner and 4 gal on gas stove top (10,000 btu). 60 min. boil. 
Re-combined boiled wort. Force chilled to 64f. Split the wort to 2 6.5 gal. 
carboys. topped off to 5 gal. each with boiled/cooled water. Aerated each 
carboy in parallel for 45 min. with aquarium stone setup (air not O2). Initial 
gravity in each carboy 1.082. (WOW) Pitched each carboy with 3 qt. starter of 
Wyeast 1007 German Ale (2nd generation). Placed both carboys in garage 
overnight (50f). Found 2" cold break and trub in #1 carboy and 0.5" in #2 
carboy. Racked #1 carboy off trub/cold break into clean carboy. DID NOT rack 
#2 carboy. Fermentation temp 55f. 7 days later racked both carboys to 
secondary (5 gal. carboys). #1 gravity 1.050. #2 1.046. 21 days later racked 
to corny kegs for further conditioning (dry hopping and cold conditioning). 
#1 gravity 1.032, #2 1.036.


Now that the background has been disclosed, here are my questions:


1. Why did #1 carboy have nearly all of the cold break/trub? The chilled wort 
was       "pretty thoroughly" mixed before racking to the carboys. Yes, the 
carboys were       filled sequentially not in parallel. I will fill in 
parallel next time.
2. What is the collective opinion on racking off cold break/trub soon (12 
hrs.) after    pitching?
3. Why are the gravities different?
4. Will Wyeast 1007 attenuate much more than the present gravity? (There was 
still       some fermentation activity when I racked to the kegs)?
5. Why was my original gravity so high? (too much grain)?
6. Should I relieve the pressure build up in the kegs from time to time?
7. As I have no idea how much further this stuff will attenuate, when should I 
begin     the gradual warm up for diacetyl rest, or should I have done the 
diacetyl rest at     the end of the secondary fermentation?
8. How would one calculate the brew house efficiency for this batch.


Clueless in Lonetree.  TIA, private email welcome. Sorry for the bandwidth.

No. The quassia is a completely different animal. It is so incredibly
bitter that great care must be used when adding to the brew. This is one of
those "lost beer" recipes that is not made anywhere else in the world
today. Bill makes most of his beers to coincide with old examples of the
style rather than the current models. If you ever get to Minnesota,
definitely check the place out.

Subject: European Beer Tour


Greetings,


I know that this question has been asked in the past, so maybe it is time for
a FAQ concerning beer related travel sights.  My wife and I are contemplating
a trip to Europe and would like to get some info.  She has graciously agreed
to "help further my education" in relation to beer and brewing by indulging
me in some beer related adventures.  Tasting, Tours, you name it! :) 


Where will I be traveling? Most likely Great Britain, Germany, France, and
Italy.  Since I am in the Air force, my wife and I can hitch rides on Air
Force planes throughout Eurpoe for little or no cost.  So our itenerary is
pretty flexible.


With this in mind, I would appreciate all suggestions.  I don't know anything
about putting together a FAQ, but if I get enough info, I will summerize and
organize it for whoever wants it, and will post it in any appropriate place
for public access.  If something like this already exists, please point it
out to me.


The HBD has been consistantly helpfully in the past.
So Thanks Again,

     Alternative Beverage here in Charlotte carries a 15 gallon glass

     sell an 11 gallon plastic fermenter for $9.55 plus 5 pounds shipping.

     drive down and pick it up at Alternative.  This is largely due to the 
     exorbitant $.50/pound fee they charge for cracking the grain while St. 
     Pat's charges $.05/pound.  I guess I really should spring for that 
     MaltMill soon.

Aesoph, Michael asked in HBD  1984         


A freind of mine has an old still that his grandfather made during
prohibition.  He states that it is not illegal to distill your own
beverages.  Is there any truth to this?  If so, is distilling safe? 
I've thought about distilling some of my wine or pseudo-brandy into
Brandy.  Anyone know any good recipes for distilled beverages?


Home winemaking and brewing are legal in USA and Canada.
But if lawyers find that you distil (separate ethanol from the other
components of the wash) one drop of alcohol at home without a licence,
they  will throw you in jail. So, operating a still at home is
illegal. Theoretically the HBD does not have discussion about
distillation. As manufacturing distilled beverage is closely related
to our hobby... Learning the science and the technic of distillation
is not illegal. Be sure that your friend's grandfather's still is
<food grade> i.e. build with copper or SS and welded so that it is
food-acid-high/temperature safe. Moonshiners often use car radiator
condenser; their still are often solderedwith stuffs containing lead,
cadmium, antimony. Those metals are volatile and very toxic. There is
no problem if you use the concentrated beer to fuel your car.
Distilled beverage are the <coeur de chauffe> i.e. the heads (rich in
methanol *poison*) and the tails (rich in higher alcohol) are
discarded. Books about the manufacture of cognac, armagnac, whisky are
full of <recipes>.

Geoff Scott's brewing page (http://www.io.org/~gscott).
 He connected the unmodified

 equiped with a small electric fan connected to a domestic

If you would like the best mash pot,then in my opinion you build a double
jacketed stainless steel unit which is sitting on a gas burner being
controlled by a computer which turns heat on and off as is needed.Then you
can select any mashing temperature and number of temperature changes and on
and on.That is what i have build and been using it for a 1 1/2 year.
But that may be seen as a overkill to some brewers, but i love it and it is
easy way to mash 10lb or 45 lb of grain. It just depends on the size of the
mashing kettle. Also i am using the same setup for sparging after mashing.


I have been trough the process of RIMS and did not like it at all.
So if you are a builder of things and like lagers and such you sure can do
them almost like they do them in Europe.
Anyway good luck with your building and brewing.

You could then use the under gravel filter to aerate as well!  Anyway, 
here's a carboy lead (thanks to Keith Christian), place an ad in the

This isn't quite correct.  # 14 will not melt down at 20 amps.  National 
Electric Code Table 310-16 has # 14 rated at 25 amps, # 12 at 30, and # 10 
at 40 with an obelisk (asterisk) beside them.  The obelisk note states:
        "Unless otherwise specifically permitted elsewhere in this Code, 
        the overcurrent protection for conductors type marked with an 
        obelisk shall not exceed 15 amperes for No. 14, 20 amperes for No. 
        12, and 30 amperes for No. 10 copper;"  
So what this is saying is that # 14 is rated for 25 amps but must have a 
15 amp breaker.  Some of the older houses I've worked on have had 30 amp 
fuses or larger on # 14 wire.  "We just kept blowing fuses and these were 
all we had left" is what the owners say.  I certainly _do not_ condone 
improper sizing up breakers or fuses. 


Anyway, the info I really wanted to pass along about house circuits is 
that the code requires # 12 in kitchens, pantries, breakfast rooms, dining 
rooms, and laundry rooms.  You can start looking for 20 amp circuits in 
these rooms first.

Subject: Lagering


In #1985 Dan Ritter asks about applying CO2 pressure to a Cornelius keg in
which lagering is taking place:


Don't forget that lagering is the tail end of fermentation and that CO2 is
(or should be) evolved during the lagering period. The beer filled into the
keg for lagering should have a fair amount of yeasst in suspensions, and
should be cold as lager fermentations are carried out at low temperatures.
Thus it should have a fair amount of dissolved CO2 and should evolve more
in the coming weeks. The Cornelius keg should be purged of air with CO2
before filling, filled and sealed, then purged again. Now pressurize to
10-15 psi and disconnect the gas line. Put the keg in the lagering
refrigerator/freezer and check the gas pressure from time to time. I find
that the rate of evolution of gas about equals the rate it leaks out so
that the pressure stays at about 10 -12 psi. With some kegs I have to top
up occasionally and with others I have to bleed gas from time to
time.(there are automatic bleed valves which will hold the pressure at
about 10 psi). Thus the beer carbonates itself and you can tell your
friends that it is "naturally" carbonated. Note also that the CO2 evolved
during lagering "scrubs" smelly sulfides and other volatiles out of the
beer.

Since I live in wine country (Sonoma County, California) I have plenty of
access to good juice and looked into distilling both wine (for grappa or
brandy) and beer (for wiskey) a few years ago.  Bottom line: It is ILLEGAL to
distill spirits for consumption without a permit/license from the B.A.T.  And
they don't give them (sell them) to anyone wanting to make it at home for
themselves unless you prove that you are making it to use as a fuel
alternative/additive. There are books in your library that show how to
distill small amounts of liquor for one's personal use and they go into the
permit application procedure. To make anything other than harsh, raw,
headache inducing firewater is no small feat however.  That's why the good
stuff costs so much in the stores. I would imagine that it's also why, after
Prohibition, most folks stopped making it themselves and bought it from the
big distilleries instead.

Subject: re: 2 day mashing 


On the 12th Brewizard`at`aol.com questioned splitting the brew day into two days.
Following the instructions in previous HBD's by several people, (apologies
to all, don't have that info handy) I boiled my water, cooled and reheated
to mash temp while I weighted and ground the grains.  I did simple infusion
and after making sure the temp was about right, (162f wanted to hit a little
high to increase unfermentables as most of my previous brews were a little
light in body for my liking)  I then put the pot I use to mash into the
oven.  I tried to turn on the oven every now and again for about 2 hours
till I went to bed.  Temp stayed where I wanted really well.  The next
morning I removed pot and after heating sparge water did sparge.  Did not
mash  choc, and crystal & maize - added at start of sparge.  Ended up pretty
light color, pretty close to Young's Special that I was drinking at bottling
last night.  I think, after drinking my SG test last night, that all went
well except I am way to light in hop bitterness.  I didn't hit that part
very well at all but I have a good mild bitter just waiting for me.  Will
probably try again to see if I can duplicate.
FWIW, here is the recipe:
7# Breiss malt
1# malted wheat- mine, not the best ~70% malted
2 oz Victory
2 oz choc.
2 oz Flaked Maize did not mash -should have
6 oz 20l crystal
  
1 oz N Brewer `at` 6.9 60min
1.5 oz Fluggles `at` 4.2 60 min


1 oz Fluggles  `at` 10 min
1 oz Kent Goldings `at` 0min
SUDS says the IBU's are 39.2 NOT!   Hops may be losing bitterness, getting a
little old.
Will let you know how it really tastes in a couple of weeks.

I'll be.  And here I thought my problem was unique.  Since it's
common, I'll bite and toss this out to the collective.


I have not yet found a good source of detailed information on
adjuncts and suspect this is one avenue to pursue in the quest
for more body and head retention in my extract brews. 


Currently I'm a stovetop steeper and a firm believer in holding
crystal malt at target temp for 30 min. v. the remove when it
starts to boil method.  While this certainly has added a fresher
taste to the beer and a little more body, head retention is still
pitiful.


Any leads on good adjunct info. sources or suggestions on other
ways to enhance head retention in extract brewing would be

Simple estimate is to take one-fourth of the original gravity "points".  For
example, if your OG is 1.048, you have 48 points; one-fourth is 12, so figure
FG = 1.012.  And you're right -- all those factors you mention will impact
this, but for a "typical" recipe this is pretty close.

Subject: Yeast


Can anyone explain the term agglomeration in terms of yeast performance?
I know the word means grittiness or macroscopic cell aggregates but is
this a huge detriment to the whole fermentation cycle?  I have noticed
what looks to be this phenomena in the Special London Ale strain
(#1968). Also with this strain and the german ale strain (#1007) I
noticed microscopically that there were "small yeast" present.  What
caused me to look at the yeast was a gusher batch of IPA and some
cloudiness in a Belgian Pale Ale.  The fact that I see this but no
bacteria make me think that it might be a "wild yeast" finding its way
into my scrupulously clean brewing practices.  This is a little
disturbing.  What do I mean by "small yeast?  Amongst all the large
Saccharomyces which are very large is a population of smaller yeast
looking organisms......... about 1/10the size of the Saccharomyces.
Under 100X magnification I even think I can see them budding.  I have
never seen these before in other yeasts, for example the Sierra Nevada
strain.  I keep -70C frozen glycerol stocks of all my yeasts and limit
the number of thaw cycles......... and I plate for single colonies.
Even off a fresh plate and a single colonies these little guys can be
seen among the larger Saccharomyces.  I cannot isolate single colonies
of just these little guys.  Any suggestions of experiments I could
perform to figure this one out??? Also, microscopically, the large
Saccharomyces look like they are loaded with refractile bodies.....maybe
glycogen stores???  Whatever these little guys are I assume that the
gusher problem was due to the fact that they could nibble on the higher
dextrans causing excess carbonation. Just an observation............ the
Irish Ale yeast (#1084) when allowed to sit for a long time in YNB +2%
glucose will start "creeping" up the side of the vessel.  Under the
microscope pseudohyphae can be observed.................rather
interesting phenomena presumably due to nutrient starvation.......I
think Dr. Finks lab at MIT is big on this. One last thing....... does
anyone know of or have heard of "gushing - inducing peptides" which are
formed by wild yeast/fungi living on the grains.  I guess this can
happen if the grains are not properly stored and processed.  The reason
I mention this is that I recently got a bag of Schreier Malt that just
didn't taste very good.....not even close to being as good as the
Belgian Grains.  Well, that's about it........guess I'll have to brew
another IPA and try this yeast thing again.  Any comments would be
appreciated. The address at the top of this note can be used to reach
me.  Cheers!!!!!!!

There are published data which suggest lagering under pressure may actually
be beneficial. Specifically, lagering under about 30 psi CO2 will definitely
decrease the levels of fusel alcohols in the finished beer and may also
reduce diacetyl levels as well, when using a lager yeast. With ale yeast,
the story is a bit different. In this case, diacetyl is INcreased and fusels
generally aren't reduced, but this may be acceptable for ales anyway. Since
CO2 pressure will inhibit yeast activity significantly, you should wait
until reaching the secondary to apply pressure. Also, some yeast strains may
exhibit a loss of viability upon exposure to CO2 pressure for multiple
generations.


See the Journal of the Institute of Brewing 90: 81-84 (March-April 1984),
