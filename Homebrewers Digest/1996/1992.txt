     Barry Finley asked about Brew-Pubs in Panama City Fl in yesterdays 
     post.  Well Barry, GOOD LUCK in this search. ( The Holy Roller's here 
     only concerned with your $$ but not in your having a good time 
     spending them!)  Yeah, down here we do have a couple of resturaunts 
     who claim to have good Homebrew, which is a matter of one's opinion's. 
      The brew they sell are contracted from Alabama and to some they may 
     good brews, to me they are not.
     Places like Uncle Ernie, The Hawknes, and Jp.  Anyone can direct you 
     to these locations from the beach.
     If you want to venture out to Pennsacola FL, roughly a 1 hour drive 
     west on route 98, you'll come across McQuires Pub, now that is a place 
     wort visiting!! Excellant Stout's, Porters, and Ales.
     
     Carbonation for me with 3/4 cups corn sugar to 5 gallons, usually 
     takes 1 to 2 weeks after bottling, provided the rest of my process was

Subject: Dry Hopping in a Corny Keg


What is the technique for dry hopping in a Corny keg?  I know that it's
possible, I'm just not sure how to do it.


One method that I've heard of is to just put your hop pellets in the
keg...no sock, no marble, no nuthin'.  Supposedly, it creates a hop bed
that floats on the beer, imparting itself in a uniform matter into the
beer.  You'd be using the keg as a secondary fermenter or serving out of
it at this point.


Any info is appreciated.

I have only been brewing since late 1995, but I have had the same 
question as you.  I think I have lucked into a good way to find out
how the carbonation is going.


I started collecting 20oz plastic soft drink bottles because I read
somewhere that these make good bottles to give away to people with your
homebrew inside because you don't have to worry about them getting 
returned.  So I started collecting them from a guy at work who drinks
diet coke a lot from those 20oz plastic bottles.  I just take them home,
wash them out with plain water, and then put them into a sanitizing 
solution made from the normal bleach and water and let them soak for
a few days.  When I take them out I don't rinse them at all, just empty
them (leaving the few drops of sanitizing solution inside) and screw on
the plastic caps.  Then when I get ready to bottle, I wash open them up
and wash them out with a hot water spray to get rid of any chlorine
taste inside.  I then bottle them and screw the plastic cap on tight.
I bottle most of my batch in brown glass bottles but make sure I bottle
at least two plastic bottles worth of the batch.  


Why do I do this?  Well, have you ever squeezed a glass bottle to find
out how much carbonation pressure is inside?  Had any luck?  How about
a plastic soft drink bottle?  Works a little different, doesn't it?
So I squeeze the plastic bottle inward a little just before tightening
the cap, to remove a bit of the excess air.  Now the bottle is indented
a little.  It's surprising how you can go by and check the plastic 
bottles each day to see how much carbonation has occurred.  The indentation
will decrease each day and finally the bottle will get almost rock hard,
much like when it contains the soft drink right from the store before
you opened it.  When the bottle is almost rock hard you can be assured
that your beer is fairly well carbonated, and that goes also for the
beer that you bottled in the glass bottles as well.  You're just using
the plastic bottles as a guage to see how your carbonation is going.


As long as you keep the plastic bottles out of the light for the most
part, you won't give the beer inside a bad taste, and the beer inside
is very drinkable.  You can imbibe or give away as you wish.

Subject: FWH / New Miller Beer Campaign


Hi Group,
Just a follow up to my last posting on FWH, I have sampled both my Vienna and
Steam that were FWHd looking for Aroma and my conclusion is that I did not get
a lot of Aroma from it. Now maybe I am comparing Apples and Oranges, imagining
the kind of aroma I get from robust late hop additions and/or dry hopping.
Neither Vienna or Steam are supposed to have much in the way of hop aroma, so
in that sense, the rougly 1/3 of the total Hoppage that was FWH resulted in
beers that were on target for the style. Perhaps FWH does not work as well with
higher gravity, toasted malt beers, due to the heavy malt notes?? I am guessing
here.
I will say that the hop profile for the Vienna is everything that I would have
wanted for the style but I would have preferred a bit more aroma for my taste.
**


I dont know how many of you may have seen this recently, but there was a new ad
campaign from Miller recently in which they describe Hops and how Miller is now
able to extract the Best Qualities from the Heart of the Hops to use in their
beer. (Just kills you doesnt it?!) Anyway they said that Miller is so taken
with the results (I am paraphrasing here) that they are just calling the new
beer, Miller. It has a red label, looking similar to the MGD label.
Has anyone else seen this or tried the beer? I am curious if this is Only a
marketing scam or if indeed the corporation is heading down the road to hoppier
beer.

Subject: re: First Wort Hopping Summary








Dave Draper <david.draper`at`mq.edu.au> gave a good summary of the FWH article
in HBD #1989.  However, I disagree that one of his conclusions follows from
the article.


He notes that the article says:


>At each brewery, the FWH beer was brewed with a reference beer alongside.
<snip>
>No aroma hopping was done in either brew.


and later concludes:


>The recommendation
>is to use at least 30% of the total hops as first- wort
>hops--basically, this means adding the aroma hops as first-wort hops
>rather than late kettle additions (at least for my setup, and I
>suspect for many others' too).


It seems to me the article only compares use of first wort hops with use
of *no* aroma hops, not first wort hops to normal late kettle additions.
It may be true that FWH gives better hop qualities than LKA, but it
doesn't sound like that's what was compared in the article.


Also, as George Fix noted in an earlier post, the best hop aroma can
still be had by dry hopping.


Hopefully, first wort hopping will become another item to add to our
homebrewing bag of tricks.  The technique should be used in addition
to other hopping strategies, not across the board instead of the other
strategies.


Experience note: I used both FWH and dry hopping (both with Columbus hops)
in a recent APA.  The Columbus (15% alpha) first wort hops definitely
added substantially to the bitterness of this infusion-mashed beer.  It
is much more bitter than I targetted (more like an IPA) but wonderfully
aromatic.  Unfortunately, no control batch to say how much aroma was
contributed by FWH.


Cheers,

Subject: Slow Fermentation


Bob asked in HB1989:


>1. Is using DME a lot slower than corn sugar?


Yes.  Check out NCJHB pages 84-85 for a quick reference on the
fermentation rate of Glucose (corn sugar) and Maltose (major fermentable
component of DME).  I primed with DME a couple of times before and found
it took MUCH longer to get the same carbonation as Corn Sugar; as I
remember, about twice as long; that's why I didn't stick with it.  It
will carbonate just as well in time, however.  Try a bottle again in 3
weeks.


>2. Is the #1084 a slow acting yeast?


Never used it myself.  I checked the literature and it says 1084 is the
least attenuative of the Wyeast line.  So that would tend to slow your
carbonation but not by a whole lot;  The dme is the main factor.


>3. Did the gelatin settle out to much yeast?(I Have used it
>before,worked OK)


I've used gelatin a lot and never had a problem with natural carbonation
after using it.  I don't think there is a problem there as long as you
did'nt use more than 1 or 2 tablespoons per 5 gallons.


>4. What about temp for aging? I have them at constant 68-70 degs.


Good to go.  Back to the literature; it says 68F is the optimum temp for
W1084.


Bob, I think your beer will be great if you can just wait it out.

Jeremy, asks in HBD #1989...

Not likely.  Northwestern extracts are very popular and have produced
predictable results for homebrewers for years.  (No, they don't pay me to
say that...)


>My beers (pale ales) have been too sweet.


Sounds like a fermentation/yeast problem.  What yeast, what process, and
what temps have you been using?  Are you killing your yeast with heat or
freezing?  Fermenting too cold?

Sounds like you're not boiling long enough.  You typically need at least
45-60 minutes to release the hop bitterness from loose/plug/pellet hops.

The above two problems would certainly explain your consistent problem.

Amylase enzyme *creates* sweetness by converting starch into sugar.
However, extract already has the sweetness converted (hence the name).

3/8" seems to be the norm, in lengths of 25 to 50'.

Yes, 3/4 corn sugar or brown sugar (my favorite) to 5 gallons will carbonate
to the desired level for pale ales/IPAs.  I'm sure there is a formula
somewhere, but I've used this ratio for 10 years with great success.


>Finally, when using grains in a strainer bag before adding extracts, is it

That's not really what sparging is.  Sparging is the rinsing of extracted
sugars from mashed grain while using the grain hulls to act as a filter bed
that strains your beer.  When our group uses a grain bag, we just let it
drain and toss it.

Ok Group,
I read all the posts about grain brewing and need some convincing. I've extract
brewed around 35 batches over several years and have gotten excellent results.
I'm told as much by others and have been kegging for about the last 10 or
12 batches.
Is it cheaper? I know I don't brew a perfect batch every time, but they're
most about as good as it gets. If it's just for the 'fun' of the process, I
can understand some people enjoying it, but....is it cheaper? better results?
almost as easy as extract?? Someone who's made the switch, please let me know

Do a full boil, and your color will be much lighter.  (That is, for a 5 gallon
batch, boil all 5-6 gallons in one pot, rather than boiling half and adding
to cold water, a la Papazian.)

I just want to say make sure you have plenty of time.  My first all-grain 
attempt took about 5 times as long as the previous batch, including cleanup
and everything.  Of course, the beer was fantastic, and the experience in 
general was a lot of fun.  I just got a lot less done that weekend than I 
had planned.  (Like that's something new?)

I've made several one-gallon all-grain batches, using improvised equipment.
(Often as "yeast starters" but, hey, why dump the liquid, especially if it's
not that much extra trouble to make it tasty?)

But, if you're -in- the property when it doesn't catch on fire, that's a

If you're doing all-grain, you don't have a sparge.  What would you recommend
for those folks?


Is it the lower temperature of steeping them that allows more of the flavor
chemicals to come through than just boiling them?  I'm really confused why 
this steep will do more (or less?) than simply adding them at the start of 
the boil.

after they've steeped, or do you leave them in for the boil, also.  (And, if
you do that, have you, in effect, added some bittering hops at the start of
the boil?)

I was under the impression that, at least in this beer, the 2,3 pd was presumed
to come not from honey itself but as a fermentation by-product.  Honey-like,
not honey-origin.

Subject: best manifold openings?


I'm building a copper manifold for my combined brewpot/lautertun. I
(obviously) need to provide openings on the underside of the manifold to
allow liquid to flow in, but I can't decide between drilling small holes or
cutting slots.  I've seen people post about doing it both ways.


I speculate that holes would do a better job of siphoning off the last
traces of wort before the siphon breaks.  However, I worry about the holes
getting plugged by grain during lautering.


Anyone have advice or opinions on which sort of opening works best?  If I
went with holes, what size would you recommend?  With slots, how deep
should I make the cuts?

All this talk of mutations and genetic drift.  I would think, naively
maybe, that a brewing yeast would be unusually stable in its genetic
makeup since there are multiple copies of each gene.  Unless a mutation
was dominant I would think the chances of getting a really detrimental
change in brewing character would be extremly remote.  Just a

Subject: pH adjustment in Carbonate water


I have a question about pH adjustment in water with moderate to high
carbonate hardness:


I am aware that some homebrewers and professional brewers adjust
their carbonate brewing water with various acids to obtain the 
proper pH for mashing and sparging.  My question is that given
sufficient Ca ions available, most or all of the bi/carbonate ions
will be precipitated during the boil as calcium carbonate, no?  So
if I adjust my carbonate brewing water with acid for mashing and
sparging purposes, won't I obtain different results, that I would
had I pre-treated (boiled) my brewing water to remove carbonate
hardness?  It seems to me that I would end up with a lower wort pH
at knockout if I acidify carbonate brewing water (due to
precipitation of carbonate hardness during the boil).  Am I off
base here?


One motivation for this question is that before I pre-treated my
carbonate brewing water (boiling with CaSO4), I could not make very 
elegant highly hopped pale beers: these beers always had a coarse 
hop bitterness, regardless of the variety of bittering hops 
employed.  Thanks.


Cheers,

Subject: FWH article summary clarifications


Dear Friends, not surprisingly my coverage of the Brauwelt article in 
a recent digest was not *quite* thorough enough, and several 
questions have come my way via private email.


Several people wondered at my comment that decoction was not used. 
In a careful re-examination, I find that no mention is made of the
mashing procedure at all.  For all I know, they *were* decocted. 
Whichever is true, the exact same procedures and ingredients were
used in all the beers described--FWH and reference.  This is stated
very clearly.  So there *is* a common baseline, and hopefully we can 
somehow find out which mashing procedure was used sometime...


Gregg Howard asked about how long the worts were boiled.  Brew A was 
boiled for 90 minutes and Brew B for 80 minutes, both at atmospheric 
pressure.


Wade Wallinger asked whether my wording of X% of hops as FWH meant of 
the total or of what would have been used as aroma hops.  It is the 
former; as stated in my post, no aroma additions were used in the FWH 
beers.  So in the FWH beers, only FW and bittering hops were used.


Eric Miller suggested that the valid comparison is between FWH beers
and bittering-hop only beers, and not with bittering + late-kettle
hopped beers.  This is my fault, I was not complete enough in my
description.  The reference beers were hopped normally (for the
breweries in question), meaning there were two late kettle additions.
In Brew A, it says "34% of [the total hop addition] (corresponding
to the two last additions originally used) into the first wort in the
form of Tettnanger type 45 and Saazer type 45 in the test brew". 
Similarly for FWH Brew B it was 52%.  This wording seems to clearly
imply that the reference beers were hopped with late kettle
additions.  Sorry for the incompleteness of my summary in this
regard.


Eric goes on to attribute a conclusion to me rather than to the 
article: not so, this is straight reporting on the piece, the only 
thing not in the article is the parenthetical comment that in my 
setup the described procedure corresponds to shifting late-kettle 
additions to first-wort additions.  The conclusion in question is of 
this particular idea, and here I quote the original article (p. 315):


"...But we recommend that first wort hopping be carried out with at
least 30% of the total hop addition, using the later aroma
additions. [New paragraph]  As far as the use of hops is concerned,
the alpha-acid quantity should not be reduced even in the case of an
improved bitterness utilisation.  The results of the tastings showed
that the bitterness of the beers is regarded as very good and also
as very mild.  A reduction of the hop quantity added [to compensate
for the presence of more hops early in the boil--this note added by
Dave, it is clear from the context of the preceding paragraphs]
could result in the bitterness being excessively weakened, and the
good "hop flavor impression" could be totally lost."


Eric also points out George Fix's assertion that the best aroma comes 
from dry hopping.  Although I am inclined to agree with this, what is 
"best" is subjective--there are hop heads and there are malt heads, 
and not everyone will agree on what constitutes the "best" hop aroma.


Tracy Aquilla also asked about whether IBUs corresponding to the FWH
addition should be subtracted from the total, and noted that with
high-alpha hops one would of course get more bitterness.  The hops
used in the reported beers were Tettnang and Saaz, both low to medium
alpha varieties.  No comments were given in the article for use of
higher alpha hops.  However, because the results were discussed in
terms of mg of iso-alphas per unit volume of wort and percentage of
total hops added as FWH, there is at least the implicit suggestion
that the concepts are general; that is, if one was using high alpha
hops, then less would be used anyway in order to achieve a given
bitterness.  Obviously one must apply some common sense and knowledge 
of one's own setup to this.  Eric Miller included in his message his 
experience that using very high-alpha hops as FW additions increased 
his bitterness more than he wanted, for example.


Tracy also expressed confusion that the level of bitterness should 
affect the perceptions of aroma and flavor.  Yup, Tracy, it *does* 
seem counter-intuitive.  It would seem that despite this, there is in 
fact an effect, and as noted by both the Brauwelt authors and by Dr. 
George last year, the complexity of the aroma producing reactions is 
immense and no one fully understands why it appears to work the way 
it does.


Hope this goes some way toward tying up some loose ends from my first 
post.  Keep those comments coming, I look forward to seeing what we 
all determine for applying the FWH principle to our home setups.


Cheers, Dave in Sydney

Subject: Stupid Brewers Tricks/Throwing away beer


About two years ago I decided it was time to my first traditional weizen.
My Batch was partial mash and 3 lb. 2-row 1 lb. wheat malt with a 3.3 lb.
pack of Northwest weizen added.  I used Yeast lab Bavarian Weizen (W51)
yeast in a 2 cup starter.  Everything had went well until I racked it.  It
was just awful. I let it sit in the secondary for six months, got my nerve
and tried it again.  Still bad.  I needed the carboy by then so I dumped it.  


I'm sure this is often told tale.  The batch so bad it ended in the loo.
But as Paul Harvey says, "Here is the rest of the story.".  Where as I had
made wheat beers before they had always been made with dry ale yeast.  And
to be truthful I don't think I had tried any commercial wheat beer of any
type. If you can't see where this is going, last summer I spent some time at
lake with my wife's family from Milwaukee.  Some of the beer they brought
was Speacers Bavarian Wheat (?).  By the second drink I had realized my
weizen of the year before wasn't bad, I just don't like weizens.

Subject: Bottle Washing


     Bottle washing doesn't need to be complicated or time
consuming, if you have room for a bottle tree and a container large
enough to soak several bottles at a time.  Naturally, the bottles
must be thoroughly rinsed.  If you do this as soon as you empty
them, most of the work is already done.


     When you have accumulated a few bottles, soak them in dilute
iodophor solution.  If the bottles are clean and soak a long time,
the iodophor needs to be only strong enough to have a pale orange
color.  Unless you are disinfecting after a contaminated batch, 12
ppm ought to be more than enough - send for the free test strips
that come with a large bottle of BTF (tm) sanitizer.  At normal
room temperatures 20 or 30 min would probably be long  enough, but
I soak them at least a day - the bottles stay there  till I need
to put some more in.  Drain and place on your bottle  tree.
That's all.  You can get away without rinsing because any iodophor
remaining in the bottle will gassify - dissolve into the air and
go away.   After a couple of days on the bottle tree, I'd
challenge anybody to taste it or smell it.


      As long as your iodophor solution is reasonably clean,
there's no need to dump it.  Just add a little more as needed to
keep a  nice pale orange color.  In a container with a tight
fitting lid, the iodophor lasts a long time.


      I've never been able to see much sense in using a dishwasher
for beer bottles.  It seems unlikely that much wash water ever gets
inside.  If it's heat we want, wouldn't the oven be better?

I would like to comment on Jim's post and on his excellent
article on filtering in Brewing Techniques. (Jan/Feb '96)
I was going to e-mail Jim but thought this might be of general interest.


Jim:
>As for lackluster beers from filtering, this can be a result of micro-

>very undesirable.


Why do you feel it very undesirable? I think there is a definite point
where micro-filtration strips beer of too much protein, but I have not
found any definitive guide as to what level is harmful. The level may
depend on the number and sizes of proteins left in the finished, pre-
filtered beer, which of course varies widely based on process and
ingredients. I currently use 1 micron and .5 micron absolute (99.9% eff.)
filters for lagers and some light ales (pale ale, IPA, Koelsch, etc.) and 
have not noticed a lack of body or head retention. I've also done some
side by side comparison with filtered and unfiltered versions of the same
batch. I did not notice any difference in the mouth feel of the two beers,
but I could easily taste the difference, even blind. With a recent hoppy
pale ale, I much preferred the filtered version; there was no yeast bite,
the hop bitterness seemed cleaner, and the hop aroma more refined. I
especially recommend filtering for lagers, where clean flavors are the 
goal. 
I was also under the impression (sorry, no reference) that "sterile" 
filtration was accomplished below .3 micron (also called "cold" filter-
ing, like MGD lite ice?). Anyone out there have any firm numbers on 
filtering to remove all yeast and bacteria?


Jim writes on p. 24 of BT Jan/Feb '96:
"Yeast cell sizes tend to fall in the 5 - 10 micron range, which is why
a rough or polish filtration is usually done at 5 microns."


Do you have a reference for the range of yeast sizes? Anybody? The range 
I remember but don't have a reference for is .8 - 5 micron. 


Jim:
>While I dont filter much beer, its
>a great tool to have as an option and I feel it improves some beers,
>assuming we are talking a 3-5 micron filtration and not sterile.


Agreed, I don't filter a lot either and it's not appropriate for a
lot of styles, but it *does* improve some beers. I also would like
to point out that filtering at the 3-5 micron level produces clear
but not brilliant beer. There is no comparison in clarity between a
 .5 micron filtered and a 5 micron filtered beer. I toyed with numerous
filtering cartridges and configurations before settling on my current
setup, and there was a definite improvement in clarity at the 1 micron
level. I'd like to have a 3 micron filter for some styles too, but those 
cartridges are expensive! 


Prospective filterers:
Please follow Jim's advice and use the pleated polypropylene cartrides
with a 99.9% efficiency rating (absolute), no matter what level you're
filtering to (such as available from the Filter Store). From my exper-
ience the cheap spun or resin cartridges do not deliver the performance
for the money. They are usually rated as something like "3 micron 
nominal", the nominal meaning they are 80% efficient. This means that
80% of particles larger than 3 microns are trapped. The other 20% are
still in your beer and the result is you wasted your time and money.


I'd like to comment on some of Jim's filtering techniques as related 
in his BT article (especially when filtering below 1 micron), but I
don't have any more time today. If there's any mileage to this thread
I'll follow up.
Here's to a clear beer!
