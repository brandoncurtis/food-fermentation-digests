Subject: In violation of the Reinheitsgebot


Hi All,


Every March, a bunch of us gather to celebrate the fermented 
beverage we call beer by staging a beer tasting dinner. We have done 
it for three years now, and it has always been a huge success. What 
a wondeful way it has been to educate people about good brew. 
Nothing warms my heart more than seeing a previous bud drinker start 
to order Sierra Nevada at a bar!


Anyway, this year we want to try to highlight Microbrews that are in 
violation of the Reinheitsgebot. You know, beers made with honey, 
fruit, pumpkin, spices, chocolate, etc. I am not all that crazy 
about fruit beers, but there are a few pleasant ones out there.
I have some other ideas for good commercial examples of beers made 
with odd ingredients, but I was hoping to tap the collective wisdom 
and ask anyone with reccomendations to email me directly. Keep in 
mind that we want these to be good-tasting brews as well (we don't 
want to scare away the converts!)TIA! Also, the Frederick Brewing 
Company out here in Frederick, MD, makes a wonderful "Steeple Stout" 
containing Rye grain. Is Rye condsidered a violation of the 
Reinheitsgebot? Are any ingredients besides barley malt, water, 
yeast, and hops allowed?


Thanks for the help. I raise my glass to you!!

Subject: Burton Salts & Water Primer TXT File


As far as 've read, it's a mixture of gypsum *sodium* chloride (table salt),
and epsom salt.  I don't know the mix, but I've had success "building" an
"idealized" Burton pale ale water using five gallons of distilled water with
1 gram salt, 9 grams gypsum, 3.5 grams Epsom salt, and 1 gram baking soda.
 The baking soda adds a little alkalinity to help avoid overacidification of
the mash.  I hit 5.2 pH without any further adjustments so I know it's
suitable for brewing.  The pail ale came out nice with accentuated and "dry"
hop bitternenss from the high sulphate content (I presume).  Sulphates this
high (~340 ppm) is totally unsuitable for practically anything other than a
Burton-style ale, or other minerally ale that you want the hops to really
stand out.


I mentioned I had posted a water chemistry promer in WRI format.  For the
WRI-challenged I also posted an ASCII text file at


ftp://users.aol.com/kennyeddy/water/wchemprm.txt


I included a few "water recipes"; the above Burton profile is the  only one
I've personally tried but the others should yield the indicated profiles,
which were "modeled" after published information.

[snip nice summary of 1st wort hopping]
"But the alpha-acid quantity should *not* be reduced, even if one
gets more bitterness than one would get in the usual way."


As I mentioned previously, I think that would really depend a lot on the
particular hops being used. What if one uses high-alpha hops (e.g. Columbus,
as per George's recommendation)? In such a case, I think the IBUs might be
significantly higher than desired if the bittering contribution of the FW
hops aren't taken into account and the bittering hops aren't adjusted
accordingly. 


Dave goes on to say:
"If the hops are reduced to compensate for the extra IBUs one gets from the
first-wort hops, then the whole benefit of doing it might be lost."


I think I'm getting lost here! How would the amount of bittering hops used
during the boil significantly affect the results of adding (a fraction or
all of) the aroma hops as first wort hops? It seems to me that aroma and
bitterness are two different effects of hopping and in this case, I don't
see how reducing the IBU contribution of the bittering hops would affect the
quality/quantity of the aroma produced by first wort hopping. What am I
missing here?


Finally, Dave adds:
"If I read the Brauwelt article properly, 
infusion beers were the only ones being discussed."


I'm a bit surprised by this. Infusion-mashed Pilseners? No decoctions at
all? What's the world coming to!

That shouldn't hurt things much.  I once dropped a spoon of questionable 
cleanliness in a fermenter.  The beer was fine.  Some dude here shoved his
whole arm into a primary, before the yeast had gotten a start, and his beer
turned out okay.

Uh oh.  That sounds really bad.  Sounds like you have a fermenter full of 
beer there.  Better dump it just in case.  


Seriously - it sounds fine.  Beer looks funny when it ferments.  You've got 
live yeast in there, they do strange things.  They're neither animal nor 
vegetable, and yet - THEY LIVE.  Swoosh your fermenter a little one night and
see how much settles by morning.  Then just bottle it.

Sorry if my tone is overly cranky.  But it pains me to hear about perfectly
good beer going to waste.  Also, hearing about you wasting your time worrying
when you should just chill and have fun and marvel in the delight that comes
from being a yeast rancher.  (After all, you just make wort, not beer.  It's
the yeast that make beer.  Who's quote am I stealing, btw?)

I made this recipe up myself and I'm calling it a honey porter but I
really don't if it is or not.  Maybe it's a stout.  I don't know??
Does any know what kind and how much hops are in Premiere Light Malt
Extract (hopped)?  It was on special at the local grocery store so I
bought some.  I tasted this when I bottled and it was pretty good at
that time; I can hardly wait until it's aged a bit.


March Hare Honey Porter


6.6 lbs Premiere Light Malt Extract (hopped)
1 lb 40L crystal malt
1 lb chocolate malt
3 lbs honey

1 oz cascade hops
WYeast American Ale #1056
3/4 cup corn sugar


I brought 1 gal of water to 170 degrees F with both speciality grains
in a muslin bag, removed from heat, and let it steep for 2 hrs.  I
then sparged the grain with 1.5 gals hot water.  Added all ingredients
(except the yeast and hops), brought to a boil, and let it cook for 2
hrs.  Removed from heat and added hops in a boil bag.  Cooled, removed
hop bag, poured to primary, brought to 6 gal volume, and added yeast `at`
80 degrees F.

Subject: Yeast starters


There has been some more discussion recently about yeast starters and that
has raised some questions in my mind.  They may have been answered before
but it is still not clear to me.
As Russell Mast said recently, I can see why a large starter would be good
from the standpoint of staving off infection by bacteria and/or undesirable
wild yeast but why is a large starter deemed necessary for complete
fermentation?  It was my understanding that inadequate aeration and
underpitching were likely causes of incomplete or stuck fermentations.  If
so, why would that be?  It would seem that the yeast would continue to work
as long as fermentables were present and with or without reproduction should 
eventually complete the fermentation with no fermentable sugars left.  What
is wrong with this scenario?

A relative of mine once burned down the barn doing this. The 110 proof rye

Bob McCowan <bob.mccowan`at`cfrp.varian.com> wrote:
"A local microbrewer told me that if you filter to remove nearly all the
yeast (clearly ;) unnecessary for clear beer) you had better filter out the
bacteria as well.  I don't know the required pore sizes for yeast/bacteria,
but the implication was that too fine a filter removes various body-building
components."


I think a pore size of 3-5 microns will generally remove most but not all of
the yeast. Most brewing strains average over 5 microns in diameter. If you
want to make sure there is still yeast in there, use a 5 mike filter to
'polish' the beer. To remove most of the bacteria, you really need to use
something much smaller, like about 0.2 microns (some bacteria are even
smaller than this). This will definitely remove some of the 'good stuff'
too. FWIW, I have never used fining agents nor filtered my beer and it's
almost always brilliantly clear, but I know a brewer (twice Vermont
homebrewer of the year) who filters, sometimes two or three times. I guess
maybe I should try it some time!


Bob also wrote:
"He also stated that a small amount of yeast had a stabilizing effect on the
beer. I've seen this mentioned elsewhere, but don't remember the reference."


Yeast is basically an 'oxygen sponge'. Leaving some in the beer can help
prevent oxidation and can thus contribute to stability, to a point, as the
yeast can absorb introduced oxygen from solution, preventing it from
participating in oxidation reactions.


previously, Jim Busch (I think) said:
>Beer that will be around for a extended time is best removed from the
>fermentation yeast to avoid the autolysis problem.


and Bob replied:
"Is this true if there's only a little fermentation yeast left?  What's the
difference between cold conditioning and racking off the yeast sediment and
filtering and the reintroducing yeast?"


I think it's basically a trade-off. Removing the yeast can potentially
prevent the eventual formation of certain staling compounds resulting from
autolysis (mostly fatty acids and long-chain aldehydes), but leaving the
yeast can potentially prevent certain oxidation reactions, as mentioned
above. This is one of those debatable issues. Sorry, but I guess I'm
avoiding your last question. It really depends on the particular beer, how
and how long it will be stored, etc.

Subject: oxygen barrier bags


I recently went to use some of my home grown Willamette
hops to dry hop a pale ale and found that they smelled
much more like (surprise) the inside of my freezer than 
hops. I knew when I packed them that this was likely to 
happen since I merely double packed them in standard zip 
lock bags. I do not keg so I was not even able to purge
the bags with C02.


Does anyone know of a retail source of oxygen barrier 
bags suitable for preserving hops? I have a vague
recollection of someone refering to resealable oxygen 
barrier bags in HBD. My local retailer of choice does
not pack their own hops and was not aware of a source.

Subject: Deadspace in Keg Boiler


     Hello All,
     
     I have a problem for which I hope the collective can provide a 
     solution, as well as to critique my own proposed solution:
     
     1.  My dilemma:
     
     My brew kettle is a converted keg, with a stainless steel nipple 
     welded in.  Connected to this is a slotted copper manifold which  
     (sort of) conforms to the interior circumference of the keg.  It works 
     very well at straining out floating hop flowers and lets me drain 
     without disturbing the break material.  However, the nipple/manifold 
     assembly is positioned too high and leaves at least a gallon (if not 
     two) of wort in the keg when I drain the cooled wort.  If I tip the 
     keg to get more wort, the break material comes with it.
     
     How would you solve this problem?
     
     
     2.  What do you think of this idea:
     
     Obtain a gallon or two volume worth of glass balls (marbles or ?) and 
     encase them in one or more fine mesh bags.  Sanitize by boiling, 
     iodofor, bleach or some combination thereof.  When the wort is cool, 
     drop the bags in the keg, thus taking up the deadspace and allowing me 
     to drain off almost all of my wort.
     
     I thought about just boiling the bags in the wort to sanitize, but 
     think that would risk breaking my ***** or losing my marbles!  ;)

Hello All,


I would like to thank those fine people that replied with advice about my
Honey-Wheat
recipe.
It will be racked and bottled soon, and I'll post the result.


I have been experimenting recently, trying to make an amber - red ale (Along
the 
lines of a red dog clone) and have been moderately successfull with the
following 
recipe. 


My Friend George Shutelock has pronounced this recipe a Russian Red Bitter,
and since
it practically blew the lid of my fermenter, I dubbed it the "Red Russian
Atomic Ale",
after more consideration, since it does not run true to any given style, I
have renamed
it............ enjoy.


NEBRASKA RED       
- ------------------
 6.6 Lbs Munton & Fison Amber Malt Extract (Unhopped)
 1.0 Lbs Crystal Malt  (Steeped 45 minutes at 150-170 F)
 2.0 Oz  Roasted Barley  (Same as above)
 1.0 Oz  Cascade Hops (for bittering, First wort Hopped, added with specialty
grain,
             steeped 45 minutes then boiled for one hour)
 0.5 Oz  Cascade Hops ( For flavor, Boiled 15 minutes)  
 0.5 Oz Cascade hops (for aroma, Boiled 2 minutes)         
 1.0 Tsp Irish moss, (Rehydrated and added for fining added for last 15
minutes of boil.)
  2  - 6 Gram packets of Muntons Dry yeast.  (Rehydrated and started in a
quart
         of boiled / cooled water-extract slurry.


Wort cooled to 85 F, aerated by stirring, and pitched the yeast starter at
85F.


Original Gravity reading was 1.062,  Final Gravity was 1.015.


This ale is very lightly hopped, it does have a nice balance between the
sweetness
added by the crystal malt and the hops that were used.
Next time I try this recipe (Which will be soon) I will use more hops to
bring up the 
bitterness a little.
But for now, I have a very nice red ale that is highly enjoyed by my friends
that 
normally don't light darker beers.


Thanks for the bandwith.


Keep brewing!

I never really sat down and figured out how much liquid iodophor to use so

that turned out to be about 781ppm, not the recommended 12.5 ppm.  Am I

First off,  yep, it has a lot of alcohol in it.  Just the same, the 
last thing that SA 3Bock is is a lager.  This brew is clearly a 
barley wine; primary fermentation is at ale temps, and 
secondary/aging is done in a winery and as such is probably aged 
at temperatures well above normal lagering temps.


Notice:  The following is from memory, which has failed me before...


I believe that 3Bock is brewed in a Northern state (Wisconsin or 
Minnesota), primaried there, then shipped to a winery in central 
California (town of Ceres?) for aging and finishing.  


Regarding the yeast:  it is virtually assured that a wine yeast of 
some type is used to get the alcohol up there in the stratosphere.
The sweetness indicates that if the alcohol didn't kill the yeast, 
there is still plenty of sugars for them to munch on.


At some point in aging, the young barley wine is racked to barrels 
that once held Jack Daniels Bourbon.  


My advice: Go ahead, try this at home, but keep your expectations 
low.  I am pretty well convinced that this beer is clone-proof.

This has indeed been beaten to death both on HBD and r.c.b., and we
probably need an aluminum FAQ.


I will state unequivocally that aluminum adds no flavor to beer.  This
is based on my own experience of heating water, mashing, lautering and
boiling wort in my three vessel, 10 gallon aluminum recirculating system
(restaurant stock pots).  Recently, I've even been fermenting in the
sparge water kettle.  No off flavors or weird ferments or anything,
including in very pale, light flavored beers such as "Your Father's
Mustache" classic American pilsner, which took a first place in regional
competition.  I have used my own carbonaceous well water both as is for
dark beers and boiled/decanted with CaSO4 or CaCl2 added.


Further, an article in Brewing Techniques a year ago reported exactly
the same, barely detectable levels of aluminum in identical worts which
were boiled in stainless steel and aluminum - the same level as in the
water itself.

Subject: Quick fermenting barleywine


I put together my first barleywine last weekend using the "revenge" recipe from
Cat's Meow 3.  I pitched the yeast (Lalvin 1118) at noon on Saturday.  By
Saturday night I had a strong fermentation going and Sunday afternoon it was
"boiling."  However, by Monday evening fermentation had stopped and no activity
seemed present and there's been none since.  Does it seem possible that this
could have fermented that fast considering the amount of  fermentables?  There
appears to be very little yeast settlement in the fermenter at this point and
I'm concerned that something is going on that shouldn't be.  Any suggestions
and/or observations would be more than welcome as this barleywine thing is new
to me.

All fron # 1991:


Shelby posted a dialogue concerning the metabolism of ethanol. While
everyone is entitled to his opinion and the exact mechanisms of ethanol
metabolism are not fully understood at this time I strongly recommend that
anyone really interested in this subject consult a biochemistry text (or
texts). In a couple of sentences: alcohol which is not directly eliminated
(breath, urine) is oxidized either relatively quickly (Krebs cycle, MEOS)
or eventually after conversion to fat. In either event it leaves the body
as CO2 and water and the energy in the alcohol carbon bonds is available.


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


Al Korzonas asked about the amino acids involved in 2,3 Pentane dione
synthesis. It is produced when thge yeast sythesze isoleucine from
threonine. The answer to the original question (how to get 2,3 PD without
diacetyl) is to find a yeast strain which produces one and not the other
and operate it under conditions which optimize the ratio. I fully realize
that this answer is about as valuable as no answer.


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


Pat Humphrey asked about iron in brewing water. Iron gives a metalic taste
to beer (Greg Noonan says "inky" as if we have all been around long enough
to have tasted ink!). It also interferes with saccharification, causes hazy
worts and weakens the yeast. It should be at 0.1 ppm or less.


It is fairly easy to remove from z small volume of water. Thorough aeration
will convert the invisible, soluble ferrous (Fe++) ion to ferric (Fe+++)
which coalesces with hydroxyl ions to form insoluble Fe(OH)3. This is then
filtered out, usually through a sand bed. In-home iron removal equipment
uses this principal. Normal home water softeners (cation exchangers) should
get iron but their effectiveness at this is sometimes enhanced by the use
of special resins or recharging the resins with specially treated salt. In
stubborn cases, powerful oxidizers are used.

  I've been brewing 10 gallon batches for ~1.5 years now, here's my standard
recipe for English pale ale:


16# M+F pale malt
1#  60L crystal
1 cup torrified wheat (helps with head retention in style with low carbonation)


Single infusion mash `at`152F
Target ~32 IBUs, East Kent Goldings
Have used 1/4 oz EKG for last 10 minutes, but lately first wort-hop with this
amount for hop flavor.
I tend to play with different yeast strains, so for this recipe I've used
Wyeast 1098, 1028, 1968, Tadcaster yeast from Samuel Smith, and Young's.
So much for "standard" recipes :-). I've been most pleased with 1098 and the
Young's yeast.


   Depending on your extraction efficiency, this should yield 11-12 gallons
at ~1.050 OG. BTW, you're eventually going to discover that there is more to
scaling up to 10 gallon recipes than simply doubling the ingredients in a 5
gallon recipe. The darker specialty malts, chocolate, roasted barley, etc.,
simply do not scale up in a linear fashion. I've been multiplying the dark
grains in my 5 gallon recipes by 1.5, and doing some tweaking. Just something
to be aware of when you go to brew a stout or porter on your new system.

  I agree a Vienna should not have significant hop aroma. However, for all

  Up until a few years ago, Anchor steam had a Hallertaur nose. I've since
read that they now use Northern Brewer for all hop additions, and indeed,
today's Anchor steam has the distinctive Northern Brewer aroma that Al
described. A steam beer should have hop aroma to be to style. If you want to
clone Anchor steam, use Northern Brewer.

Subject: Beer Color / Iron In Water


Scott Bukofsky asks about calculating beer color.


The formula is basically to take *each* ingredient -- grain, extract, sugar,
fruit, old nylons -- and multiply its weight in pounds times its lovibond
color rating.  Add these all together, and divide by the batch size in
gallons.  The lovibond rating is in degrees lovibond per pound per gallon, so
this is why the formula works.  Example:  a five gallon batch containing 6
pounds DME at 2L, 1/2 lb crystal at 40L, 1/4 lb chocolate at 350lb.  We have
(6*2 + 0.5*40 + 0.25*350) / 5 = 23.9 L.


************************


Patrick E. Humphrey asks about iron in beer.  I'd say if you can taste it in
the water, you'll taste it in the beer.  A darker, more minerally beer might
tolerate it better but certainly a light delicate beer will suffer.

Subject: Full boils...


For close to 30 batches now, I've been doing extract/specialty grain
concentrated wort boils. I can get about 3.5 gal. in my current pot and
usually lose close to a gal to evaporation. I'm content to use
extract/specialty grain, but am considering getting a big ass brew pot and,
maybe, a propane burner to cook outside or in the garage. 


My question is: what positive improvements could I expect doing full boils?


I can think of two off hand; 
1. less carmelization = lighter colored beers
2. I could boil a much bigger concentrate to split between two 5-6 gal.
primaries (same brewing time, for double the batch size).

Subject: Style Faux Pas


Al points out a mistatement in a post I made last week:
>Anyway, the beers turned out very good, and true to style.


Since when are Vienna and Steam beers supposed to have a significant
hop aroma and a Styrian/Ultra nose, at that?  If there is any hop
aroma in a Steam beer, it should be the woody/rustic US Northern
Brewer and not the resiny Styrian Golding or the spicy Ultra (which
have a lot of Saaz in their lineage).  Care to `splain this, John?  ;^).


I knew someone would Call Me on this one. Its true, Vienna and Steam are not
known for Hop Aroma in the style. Some in the Vienna, but not the Steam
certainly. What I should have said instead of "True to Style", was "True to
What I Intended". (Although as you will all see in (tomorrow's HBD,1992?), I
had intended for both beers to be More Aromatic than they actually turned out,
as a matter of personal taste. In fact, I am now considering Dry Hopping the
"Steam" Batch.)


Anchor Steam is defined by Northern Brewer of course. If we broaden the style
to California Common, I should still be using American cultivar hops
exclusively. But, the first beer I wanted out of the batch was Vienna
(Graf-Style) and Vienna and Steam are not that far apart with respect to the
malts. So, I nominally made the Vienna recipe (from Fix's book) adding a bit
here and there, and brewed with the hops on hand, and knowing that I wanted to
try FWHing, bought some Ultra, which I had wanted to try anyway. So, I split
the 11 gallons or so into two fermenters, pitched different yeasts, and wahlah
(voila) two different beers. I had boiled a gallon of wort for the Steam with
more hops to up the IBUs for the Steam. 
"True to Style" was a mistatement to say the least.

Here's a real simple one that resembles an English Bitter
This is what I brew most of the time, I call it "Liquid Sunshine"
Ingredients (for 10 Gallons)
16 Lbs. 2-row Barley
2 Lbs Crystal Malt (medium)
3 Oz. Cascade hops
1 Jar Grandma's Molasses (unsulphered)
Yeast 1098 liquid yeast 


1) Add crushed grains to 4.5 Gallons of 140 deg. water for protein rest
`at`122 deg. for .5 hr. 2) Raise to 152 deg. for mash (1 - 1.5 hrs)
3) Sparge with 170 deg. water to get 11 gallons. 4) Boil for 1 hr.(with
molasses and hops) 5) Cool wort and pitch yeast.


Note: You may want to vary the amount and/or type of hops, depending on
the bitterness you desire. I have recently started making this using the 
"Early Hop Addition" method discussed here in this very forum. The results
have been more than spectacular. I have started using Columbus hops (A=15%!!!)
and just throwing them into my boil kettle at the start of the sparge. The
beer has NOT been overly bitter as would be expected, but you can definitely
taste the hops (yum!). Also, I too use a converted keg system, and usually
brew 15 gallon batches. One keg for mash tun, one keg for boil kettle.
I use an 80 quart cooler fitted with a slotted copper manifold for my lauter 
tun. You may want to consider doing this, as I have been very happy with my
system.

Subject:  Recirculating Wort


Hey Neighbors,


With only four all grain batches behind me I am curious
about the process of recirculating the wort during the sparge.
 I currently drain off a couple quarts of the cloudy wort and
pour it back into the mash tun.  However, this tend to kick up
the grains and cause more turbidity and possibly HSA.  


My question is...can I not just pour these couple of quarts
into my sparge bucket and just continue along with my
sparge?  I have my sparge water calculated so that I use all
of it.  What do you think?  Is anyone doing this?


P.S.- Now that I am doing all grain there is no going back. 
The beer taste great.  I was never able to achive this quality
with extract.


Thanks,

        This is for Howard and other lurkers who are looking for a reason
to go all-grain.


        My grain recipes are fresher tasting, cleaner and definitely
yummier than any of my extract beers. I find I have a lot more control on
color, taste, sweetness, etc. Start with a partial-mash to get your feet
wet and you can decide for yourself.


        As far as cost is concerned, an all-grain batch costs me approx.
1/2 to 1/3 of an all-extract batch. (5 gallons)


        The *only* drawback to all-grain brewing is time! It takes me about
5 to 6 hours for an all-grain batch. (Mostly because I'm boiling 6 gallons
of wort on an electric stove!) If I'm doing a partial-mash, then I'll also
do a partial boil and knock off an hour or so on my time. For comparision
purposes, an extract batch will take me approx. 3 hours. When I borrow my
buddy's propane stove, the all-grain time is closer to 4 hours.


        Just brew it! (Sorry Nike)
