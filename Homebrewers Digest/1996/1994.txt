Since their has been so much talk about this subject, why don't we read just
what George really said.

I'd boil until I got a hot break so the students can see what it looks like
and then tell 'em that it's appearance and volume may vary.  I'd really be
tempted to let it boil over so that they gain an appreciation of how fast
and violently it can occur.  I know I would have appreciated such a demo- I
had to replace all of the ranges' insulation when my first boil resulted in
a wort volcano.  Since a "real" brew isn't planned, what about a low volume
(but normal gravity) wort and cooling rapidly by adding cold water.  This
would allow for a quicker boil (and perhaps a bit of head space for a
boilover 8-) ).  I'd still a chiller tho'.

Tasting the brew resulting from the starter before you pitch (or, much
better yet, before you start a batch) helps avoid this.

Subject: Slow Carbonation


Thanks to all who responded to my post on slow rate of carbonation. Thay ran
from shake up the bottles to wake up yeast,open up and add corn sugar, big
PITA, foamed up all over the kitchen counter and I had to drink it right
away oh well.
The yeast used is a little slower then others. Always use corn sugar. Type
of DME used. If I may quote Russel Mast "BINGO", and thank John McCauly for
his unrelated post in HBD1991 for lighting up the light bulb over my head. I
used Laaglander DME which is said to have a lot of dextrins and other
unfermentables in it. I think thats the problem. So in conclusion I will
never use Laaglander DME to prime again.I may try another brand some time
but for now I will use corn sugar. The beer aint bad just a little flat.
I'll just have to wait and see, 
in the mean time I will  enjoy my Pale Ale and wait for the Alt thats going
into the secondary today to come about. What would I do with out all you
HBDers out there??? Be drinking flat beer and wondering what the hell went
wrong.

Subject: Carbonates


In # 1992 Rob Reed had some questions about the differences compensating
for alkalinity in water by boiling as opposed to treatment with acid. In
boiling


         Ca++ + 2HCO3- --> CaCO3(s) + CO2(g) + H2O


Boiling drives off the dissolved carbon dioxide and this lowers the pH. At
lower pH bicarbonate is converted to carbonate and, as calcium carbonate is
not very soluble in water, the carbonate pairs with calcium ions to form
the solid, indicated by (s) calcium carbonate which precipitates out. The
extent of precipitation and whether it will happen depends on several
factors and is not that easy to predict. There are a couple of indices
which try to do this job but don't seem to work that well for the brewer's
purposes (or more likely, I don't know how to interpret them correctly). To
give a bit of a feel for this my well water has, typically, 23 mg/L
calcium, alkalinity (bicarbonate) at 72 mg/L as CaCO3 and TDS (by
conductivity) of about 150 mg/L. This gives a saturation pH of about 8.
Upon boiling the pH of this water goes to a pH of a bit over 9 at which
time it is super saturated but no precipitation occurs. The alkalinity and
hardness do not change. By contrast, sythetic Burton water with calcium at
194 mg/L, magnesium at 66 mg/L alkalinity of 130 mg/L and TDS at 800 mg/L
has a saturation pH of 7.04. Upon boiling its pH goes into the nines and
precipitation does occur. After cooling and settling the calcium has
decreased to 66 mg/L (down to about a third of what it was), the magnesium
is unchanged and the alkalinity is 40 mg/L as CaCO3, about a third of what
it was. Note that the hardness of Burton water is mostly permanent due to
the large sulfate ion concentration.


In treatment with acid


   Ca++ + 2HCO3- + 2HA  -->  2H2CO3  + Ca++ + 2A-


"A" represents the acid anion. Upon standing or when the water is heated,
some of the carbonic acid escapes as CO2


  H2CO3 --> H2O + CO2(g)


The net effect is that SOME of the bicarbonate ion has been driven off as
CO2 gas and has been replaced with the A- (typically phosphate, lactate,
chloride, or sulfate) anion. Contrast this with the boiling case where SOME
of the bicarbonate is paired with calcium, removed and not replaced. In the
acid treatment case you must be prepared to deal with the flavor effects of
the anion (in the case of strong mineral acids) and the anion and acid in
the case of the organic acids as they are not fully dissociated at beer
pH's.


Rob specifically mentions problems with coarse bitterness in highly hopped
beers. The problem here is usually sulfate ion which must be at very low
levels (<15 ppm) where beers like Bohemian pilsner are desired. Bicarbonate
is often labeled bitter when it is actually the effects of alkalinity in
raising mash/sparge pH that are really responsible. Bicarbonate paired with
magnesium can be bitter, however. The bottom line is that for highly hopped
pale beers a nearly ion free water is required such as that of the home
town of these beers: Plzen. Very few brewers are fortunate to have water
this soft and must rely on use of distilled water, RO water or their tap
water diluted with deionized water.

Subject: Priming with honey...


        I have been searching PApazian's book trying to find out how much 
honey to use to prime a 5 gallon batch but I can't find it!  does anyone 
here know how much to use?  I have heard that honey does great things for 
head retention and that is one area in which I am trying to improve.  I 
plan on using a light clover honey that I an get from a nearby health 
food store.


        On another point, I have experienced different levels of 
carbonation depending on whta type of bottles I use.  I have a collection 
of pop-top bottles that I have been using for my last two batches.  I 
have experienced that they do not have as high a level of carbonation as 
those bottles that I cap with bottle caps.  I know the seal on the 
pop-top bottles is good because they are new seals.  Someone once told me 
that those seals leak.  Is there any truth to that?  I have also used 
clay pop-top bottles that originally contained belgian ale.  While I like 
these because they block out all light and maintain a steady temperature, 
I find that the carbonation level in those bottles is the lowest of all, 
even the glass pop-top bottles.  Has anyone experienced similar results?  
Can anyone shed some light on this?  Much thanks in advance.

Subject: Rookie Recipe question 


For my second batch, I decided to attempt the "Danger Knows No
Favorites Dunkel" recipe from page 204 of Papazian's NCJHB.  I picked
up all of the ingredients today, and realized after I got home, that
the recipe calls for lager yeast.  I know that Papazian states that
it's OK to substitute ale yeast for lager yeast and vice-versa, but I
think I'm more of a worrier than he is (though relaxing with some of
the homebrews from my first-batch does help considerably).


Is it OK for me to use ale yeast for this recipe and ferment it at ale
temperatures (68 F)?  Will it dramatically change the character of the
recipe?


Thanks for your help,
Mike DeRousse

Subject: "Convincing" AGB / Lautering Manifold / Carboante Water Boiling


Howard in Baltimore needs "convincing" about all-grain brewing.  I think it's
been said a million times that, properly and carefully done, an extract beer
can be every bit as good as an all-grain beer.   AGB has advantages in
ingredient and "character" control, and the character obtained from mashing
is "different", in general, than simple steeping.  It's largely a matter of
preference.  If you use the highest-quality pale (as opposed to colored)
extracts for all your beer, and obtain flavor and color from properly-steeped
specialty grains (add a pound of pale malt to the steep to obtain a
"mini-mash" -- even simpler than a true "partial mash"), you can get a
wonderful extract beer, no doubt.  Remember, even AGB grain bills use pale
malt for the bulk (generally speaking), and the color and character comes
largely from the specialty grains. This is why I advocate using pale extract
as a base even for say a stout.  As for something like Oktoberfest, where a
"specialty" grain (Munich, let's say) is a more significant part of the bill,
you can get Munich extract (I know St Pat's has it).  If your extract beers
do everything they need to do for you, why mess with AGB?

Dave Whitman asked about holes versus slots for lautering manifold.  I used
3/32" holes about every 1/4", drilled all the way through the tubing.  The
larger diameter of the fittings compared to the tubing (pipe) "suspends" the
pipe above the cooler bottom, so the holes aren't blocked (in fact, this gap
forms a long, narrow slot itself, the length of the pipe, and it's too narrow
for most grain chunks to get into).  I also toss a cut-to-size sheet of
8-holes per inch nylon needlepoint mesh over the manifold to protect it fom
my spoon as well as to increase the apparent "false bottom" area.  Works real
well for me (last mash I got 80%-85%).


*****


Rob Reed asks about water treatment.  This is a topic recently near and dear
to my heart, so I will take a stab at it.  Carbonate reduction from boiling
is only as effective as the amount of calcium in the water, as this is what
forms the carbonate precipitate (CaCO3).  Even then, there will be CO3 left
in the water as it won't all come out (but the ~50 ppm leftover should be
tolerable).  Acidiy in the mash will arise primarily from calcium's reactions
with the mash, so if your boiled water had just enough calcium to get rid of
the carbonate, you may not reach your 5.2 pH target (or thereabouts) without
other acidification.  "Acidification" with acids will help in this case, but
acidification form calcium is arguably more "natural".  As for your hop
character comment, the sulphates (SO4) you pick up from the gypsum are
definitely going to hop enhancement, from the sounds of it.  However, if you
were to use the same technique to brew say an Oktoberfest, the hop
accentuation would be totally out of character.


Sparge water should be acidified to prevent the rising pH from helping to
leach tannins and othere junk from the grain.  What else is in this water is
probably not that important for the sparge, but can be important in the boil.
 In the mash, it's the calcium and carbonates that will have the greatest
role; in the boil, the other ions (magnesium, sulfate, sodium, chloride) will
also have their effects along with the other two.  The calcium/carbonate
balance is the main thing in your mash; the *total* ionic makeup of your
boiling wort is important in the boil for overall beer character.  Note that
if you have water that's high, say, in sodium, you could try sparging with
acidified (lactic or phosphoric) *distilled* water; this in effect "dilutes"
the original mash water and reduces the ppm's of *all* the ions going into
the boil.  As long as your mash & sparge pH's were properly managed, this
will reduce any other "offending" ions' ppm's.


Get a water analysis from your municipal supplier (should be free for the
asking).  It may not be totally accurate or reliable (I got one last week
dated "2/94"), but it'll give you an idea of your water makeup.  Sulphates,
sodium, or chloride over ~75-100 ppm might indicate trouble with harshness in
more-delicate beers; low (<~30-50 ppm) calcium might cause problems in
acheiving proper mash pH; magnesium over ~30 ppm will begin to taste
unpleasantly bitter.  Carbonates will react with calcium to precipitate in a
pre-boil in the ratio of roughly 3 CO3 to 2 Ca; about 30-50 ppm carbonate
will not react at all and will remain (per Dave Miller).  So for example if
you have CO3 at 100 ppm, and Ca at 30 ppm, you'll use up all your calcium and
still have 50 ppm CO3 leftover.  A mash performed with this water may not
drop much below the "high-five's" in pH.  Adding gypsum will give adequate
residual calcium to set the mash pH but will also boost your sulphate, which
may not be what you want.


If after this kind of a review, your water starts to look ugly to you (mine
did -- sodium 145 ppm, sulphates 154 ppm; yuk!), you may have to consider
using another approach (for example, adding salts to distilled water), or
sticking to brewing beers within a certain style which benefits from your
particular water.

freezer to hold the kegs.  I had in mind drilling holes in the side and
front to run CO2 line and in front, the tap shank.  I have since been
advised not to do this because of the possibility of running into some
cooling coils. A friend of mine, Wade W. (hi Wade), suggested putting a
"collar" of wood between the box and lid and tapping through that.  To me
that sounds like a lot of trouble.  Does anyone have any advice for mounting
a shank meant for a vertical wall on top of a chest freezer, or advice on
how I can safely drill through the vertical walls of a chest freezer?  Post
or private mail would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks in advance.  This is my first post to the HBD, but have been lurking
for a while.  I've learned alot by reading the digest.

Subject: 1st wort & decocted vs. infused


First of all, thanks to Dave Draper for an excellent summary of the
article on First Wort Hopping by Freis et al.


I would like to see a little more discussion about how the amounts of
break materials in infusion mashed vs. decoction mashed beers affect the
bitterness contributed by the FWH.


Dave stated:


>One quick comment: Bob McCowan mentioned, quite correctly, that the
>above commentary applies to infused beers--in decocted beers,
>comparatively little break is formed in early part of the boil, so
>one needs to consider this.




Since there is less hot break material in the boil of a decocted beer,
will a decocted beer that is hopped the same as an infused beer end up
with higher IBUs?  Is this a general phenomenon, or would this only apply
with the hops added before the hot break (as in FWH)?  Can someone give
a good explanation as to *why* this is so?


Thanks!

To answer John Palmer and to the list:


I tried the new Miller.  It was not a taste knockout, but I don't remember
what the old Miller tasted like, except the skunky taste when it came in
clear bottles.  I don't mean to say it is not a solid American light lager
if you are stuck at a bad bar.


I also tried the new twice-hopped Southpaw by Miller (or is it Plank Road?),
even though it is a light beer, to see what kind of hop flavor/aroma they
were shooting for.  If you have to drink a light beer, this one is not as
bad as most.

Those are among what you would get, with the trademarks scrubbed off, if you
bought them at a homebrew store.


Typically the deposit is less than you would pay to buy them.  I've seen
much hand-wringing about the morality of acquiring kegs, particularly big
and very expensive draft kegs, this way.  I respect that concern for private
property and obeying the rules, but I have to wonder whether mini-kegs are
actually shipped back to Germany for refill.  I doubt even more that most
glass bottles are shipped back to bottling plants from those states that
require deposits, especially because I've seen them crunched into shards by
return centers.  Thus, I have a special appreciation for Jim Koch and Fritz
Maytag for not using twist-offs, whereas Pete's I suppose figures it's
better for sales to use them.


I'd appreciate being informed of usual practices after return for deposit of
mini-kegs, bar longneck and Grolsch/Fischer-type bottles, and lighter-weight
bottles, in states that have a bottle deposit regime.


In any event, you can get various taps for dispensing from the mini-kegs and
replacement bungs for sealing them, at homebrew stores.

Subject: Brewing Addiction


I'm not brewing this weekend, Oh the pain, fortunately I still have one
fermenting upstairs. I can sit there and watch it bubble. 


I'm starting to think my local supplier is limited to certain malts. All my
recipes seem to basically be the same. 8-10 lbs of Helles 2 row malt. A
little crystal malt. Then the hop varities and yeast change for all the
recipes, but I seem to think I should be changing the malt varities. They do
have a nice selection of speciaty malts, chocalate and other roasted things.
They only sell one type of 2 row because they say it's the best and they can
offer a good price because they buy it in bulk.(They use it in their own
brew). I read all these recipes with all the different types of malt and
wonder if my stuff would be better with them. I hate to say it but I'm
getting bored with my beer flavor. (Don't worry, I'm addicted to this hobby
, I'll never stop.) I think I need to switch to some more flavorful ales.
I'm allways making dark lagers and I allways seem to use Hallertau hops.
Hopefully the Steam beer fermenting is going to be different. 


Could some of you send me one of your favorite recipes for a light colored,
hoppy  ale. (all grain). 


Well, happy brewing.
Gonna go watch it bubble for a while.

Subject: CO2 as dry ice




The recent discussion of whether a 5 or 20 lb bottle of CO2 is
liquid or gas caused me to consider the following.  If I took the 
valve off of my 5 lb CO2 bottle and stuffed 5 lbs of dry ice into 
it then sealed it back up would I end up with a full bottle or
a bomb?  Dry ice benzene contamination aside, it seems to me that
this would work.  The problem would be the fact that "dry ice" is
not really dry and much water frost accumulates.  Water in a pressure
bottle is bad as it can cause rusting and eventual failure.  So
how about 5 lbs of dry ice and a few packs of silica gel?

- -- [ From: Mike Kidulich * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --


In HBD 1983, the question of hop storage was raised, and in a later HBD,
oxygen-barrier bags were mentioned. I work in the electronics industry, and
these oxygen-barrier bags seem to be what we use as static-shielding bags,
to store delicate electronic components. I don't know if these bags are food
 -grade, but since the hops will be boiled anyway, it may be a moot point.
These bags may be obtained from Contact East, 508-682-2000. The bags have an
aluminum outer layer, and (I think-don't have the catalog in front of me), a
polypropolene inner layer. The bags are amine free. There is a series of zip
 -loc bags (4x6" are $13.10/100), and heat sealable, (4x6" are $8.20/100).
Sizes from 3x5" and up are available.

Subject: DMS and yeast strain.


I helped a club member ferment a single batch of beer with several different
yeast strains a few weeks ago. The beer was a pale ale, OG=1.045, 19IBU zero
late hop additions, to emphasize the yeast characteristics. All were
fermented in identical 1 gallon jugs at the same ambient temp (21C or so). A
friendly laboratory at the local megabrewery did an analysis for us on
alcohol, esters, DMS, aldehydes, diacetyl etc. 


Our club members tasted the beers at our monthly meeting and had the lab
results as reference notes (those members who bothered to turn up - you know
who I'm talking to!)


The results were all interesting, but the one that really stood out for me
was DMS. It varied over a very wide range depending upon the yeast strain (I
don't have the results handy, so cannot quantify this accurately, but as I
recall it was over about a 3:1 range). This is a very interesting result, as
most books say DMS comes mainly from the malting and cooling processes. It
should be about the same for a given wort, independent of the yeast strain.


Well, so much for that theory!

Subject: Mash scaling revisited


Today, Jim Dipalma alluded:


 "Depending on your extraction efficiency, this should yield 11-12 gallons
at ~1.050 OG. BTW, you're eventually going to discover that there is more to
scaling up to 10 gallon recipes than simply doubling the ingredients in a 5
gallon recipe. The darker specialty malts, chocolate, roasted barley, etc.,
simply do not scale up in a linear fashion. I've been multiplying the dark
grains in my 5 gallon recipes by 1.5, and doing some tweaking. Just something
to be aware of when you go to brew a stout or porter on your new system."


Now, I've never heard this explained: why is the scaling of some grains 
linear and some not?  This implies that my calculated mash efficiency 
should vary both with the ammount of grain mashed as well as with the  
proportions of grain used?  Why should mashing two 5gal. batches separately
not yield the same results as mashing them together (assuming identical 
mash schedules and mash thicknesses)?

RE:  Summary of responses on extract beer head retention


Sorry the summary took so long .... don't you hate it when work
gets in the way!  Thanks to all who responded with suggestions to
increase head retention in extract based brews.  They were:


 - use specialty grains. Far and away the most responses.
    Many suggested #1/2 - #1 Crystal Malt.  
    Some suggested mashing with some #1/2 - #1 Dextrin/Carapils


 - One respondent reported using 8 oz. of malto dextrin in a 5 
  gallon batch of ale as an experiment.  No final data yet, but 
  seems to be a success.  Used this so that mashing was not
  needed.


 -  Others noted the myriad of non-grain related variables: how to
   wash glasses 101; fresh hops are critical, etc....


 -  Use of Laaglander (or extracts with more unfermentables) was
   suggested.


 -  I noticed a recent post citing that water can even impact
   extract brews and plan on looking into that since I suspect
   our well water is pretty hard even though it goes through a
   filter/softening system.


Thanks all - Bill Gladden

degree on sanitizing ability as well as increased cleaning capability. The
Sodium silicate is an inhibiter which protects metals against corrosion.

Does the "collective intelligence" out there know if Tygon brand tubing is 
safe for use with racking canes?

Subject: Bass Ale recipe (extract please)


i just tried Bass Ale. i would like to make something close. i perfer
extract recipes, but i can closely approximate the appropriate grain
to extract (i hope). TIA

<Why do you feel it very undesirable? I think there is a definite point
<where micro-filtration strips beer of too much protein, but I have not
<found any definitive guide as to what level is harmful. The level may
<depend on the number and sizes of proteins left in the finished, pre-
<filtered beer, which of course varies widely based on process and
<ingredients. I currently use 1 micron and .5 micron absolute (99.9% eff.)
<filters for lagers and some light ales (pale ale, IPA, Koelsch, etc.) and 
<have not noticed a lack of body or head retention.


There are no absolutes and this is certainly up to the brewers preference.
Sterile filtration is generally done at .45 microns.   Proteins are a
big part of mouthfeel and duration of foam stand.  If you are happy with
the carts you are using and the results then stick to it.  I prefer to
chill the kegs for a week at 32F, then filter at 3-5 mikes.  I get
better hop aroma with this method over finer filtration.  I also prefer
the beer overall, mouthfeel and body/malt character.


<Do you have a reference for the range of yeast sizes? Anybody? The range 
I remember but don't have a reference for is .8 - 5 micron. 


I think that very few survive below a 3 micron filtration.  Mature beer
in the tank should have very few small cells.


<I also would like
<to point out that filtering at the 3-5 micron level produces clear
<but not brilliant beer. There is no comparison in clarity between a
< .5 micron filtered and a 5 micron filtered beer.


This is true in some cases.  This is where you have to differentiate
between haze and yeast turbidity.  Haze can be reduced through different
methods than filtration, and the success of this will vary with the
brewhouse, raw materials and fermentation methods.  This is an area
where trub formation and removal is essential.  My preference is to
remove yeast with a filter or by aging/cold conditioning and deal with
haze seperately.  (BTW, push those boils as vigorous as your kettle
can handle, many homebrewers boils are not vigorous enough to produce
brilliant wort, you should look at some of the boils achieved in
steam systems where even 30% freeboard is barely adequate to contain
the wort).


<I'd like to have a 3 micron filter for some styles too, but those 
cartridges are expensive!


Thats why Im a fan of the ~$5 disposable versions sold by Crystal Clear.
The price per use is higher than the reusable ones but the ease of use
and numerous pore sizes available are attractive.  It is also more cost
effective as your brewlength increases.  If Im filtering 1 BBL of beer
through a $5 filter and spending no time cleaning, then Im ahead of
the game over a $35 filter that will take me 30 minutes each time I
have to use it to clean (not to mention that you could never push
1 BBl of beer through a .5 or 1 micron resuable cart without backflushing).  


Brew on,
