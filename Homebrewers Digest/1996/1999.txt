according to the little test papers you can get. It was prob. closer to
the 12.5 ppm. At any rate, it didn't stain my filter. I pushed 5 gal
through the filter then filtered my beer into the keg that the iodophor
was in. I didn't rinse the filter after the iodophor, just connected it to
the source keg and kept on gettin' it. After filtering I backflushed with
water until my filter was clean. I took it apart a couple of times and
emptied the housing to speed things up. I just stored my filter in light

anyone see any problems here?

Subject: Coriander and orange peel boil experiment results


Last night, I completed an experiment to determine the proper boil times
for coriander and bitter orange peels, two ingredients thought to be in
Celis Grand Cru.  Here are the results.


Executive summary - Boil the heck out of the orange peels, don't boil 
the coriander.


Description of experiment : Two saucepans containing about 12 ounces of water
each were brought to a boil.  About two tablespoons of sugar were added to
each to make the tasting solution closer to a completed beer.  In one pan,
a teaspoon of ground coriander is added.  In the other, a piece of orange
peel, perhaps 1/10 ounce was added.  The orange peel was labelled "Belgian
bitter orange peel, curacao type" from Fermentation Frenzy in Los Altos, CA,
USA.


During the boil, 1 ounce samples were drawn at various intervals and set aside
to cool.  Therein lies the primary flaw in this experiment - the solution
volume significantly lowered during the process due to the sampling and 
evaporation.  I attempted to counteract this in the last 30 minutes by adding
a little more water (4 ounces or so).  Still, I think that the results are
useful.  The samples were drawn at 1, 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after 
the boil began.  All samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and
then tasted.  Here's my perceptions :


boil
time        coriander                        orange peels
- ----        ------------------------------        --------------------------------------
1        quite tasty - distinct flavor        almost no orange flavor.  little color


5        flavor significantly faded        similar to the flavor of the 1
                                        minute sample, perhaps a bit more


15        even less flavor                orange flavor begins to come through
                                        in earnest


30        little flavor                        more orange flavor, a bit of a sharp
                                        edge


60        tasteless sugar water                strong orange flavor with a bitter
                                        tinge.  Definite orange color.


So my recommendations would be to use orange peels for a full hour boil
and add coriander at the very end.


I hope this info helps !  As a reminder, if you would like to join in the
Celis Grand Cru recipe project, please reply to me and I'll add you to the
mailing list.

Subject: White hangers from Lalvin champagne


Hello all!
I am currently on the second racking of some strawberry wine.  A very 
potent one indeed.  To get this potency, I used Lalvin Champagne yeast, 
with a tolerance somewhere near 18% and a good fruity nose.  Well, my 
first racking revealed to my unbelieving eyes, floating mats of what I 
later had confirmed as yeast (i baked with one, and it made great, 
sorta winey bread).  Now that the wine has been racked, I have not 
encountered any more mats, but have found some white stringy floaters.  
Could it be that the yeast is trying to form more mats?  If not, what are 
they?  The wine tastes fine so far.  Has the typical green flavor, but no 
off tastes or bouquet.  Any ideas?

I visited Las Vegas recently and was only able to dig up 1 Brew Pub.  
(I was desperate for decent beer, and searched hard!)  


  "Holy Cow"
  NE corner of Las Vegas Strip and Sahara Ave 
  (just a bit north of the Las Vegas Convention Center)


  phone (702) 732-COWS (or 732-2697)


They make a great Red Ale and Pale Ale, and pleasant Hefe Weiss.  Also 
have at least one special "Brew Master" beer on tap (I had a wicked 
"Hacker Pale Ale").  Good food and service.  Tours available sometimes 
(but you can just wander upstairs and have a look any time).  Well worth 
a visit, even if they weren't the only place around.  


Check around a bit and you might be able to find some discount 
certificates (look for cows with sunglasses) -- I found a free beer 
certificate at the Budget rent-a-car place as I was checking out on my 
way home...  :-/


BTW, There's NO SHORTAGE of other trouble to be found in Vegas!

jim mitchell askes about non-alcoholic beer. i too am working on na =
brew. my father is now on medication for arthritis that prevents him =
from drinking alcohol. so he has taken to drinking na, and i have taken =
to brewing it.


i have read with dismay the attempts to heat the finished beer to drive =
off the alcohol, or to freeze the beer to drain off the alcohol. the =
descriptions suggest that the result is not adequate.


so, i am taking another tack (as i do in most of my activities). i have =
brewed a 1-gal and then a 5-gal batch with carapils (dextrine) malt. =
with the first batch i confirmed that carapils extract does not ferment. =
my father rated it equal to the european offerings. so my 5-gal batch =
simply scaled up to strike a gravity of 1.006 by extracting what was =
there from 2 lbs of carapils malt. i expected 1.008-1.010, but what the =
heck. i boiled the all grain extract (wort) just like a regular all =
grain batch, adding hops along the way.


the 5-gal result is a drinkable beer, but not quite as good as some of =
the european offerings. the taste is slightly grainy and a bit thin =
(which i think is do to my poor extract efficiency leaving only 1.006 =
og).  i have not given up. my next attempt may include just enough pale =
malt to end up with 0.5% alcohol (legally na) and ferment it to see if =
the beer improves.

The 5 ltr Mini-Kegs are known as 'Party-Cans' here in Germany. There is no
deposit and they are most definitely not refilled. They cost the brewery
pennies and Fass-Frisch is milking homebrewers in the US and elsewhere at $5 or
more a pop. 


One filled with a decent beer (e.g. Wahrsteiner, Frueh Koelsch, or Czech Bud)
costs about $10-14 here in Cologne. 


I refill them all the time because it's easier than kegging and they fit easily
into the small german refridgerators for lagering.  


Question for the HBD: Has anyone out there tried to build an adapter to force
carbonate beer in one of these 5 ltr cans?


By the way, be careful not to scratch the coating off the metal around the
opening when removing the stopper. These cans are ordinary sheet metal with a
non-toxic coating. Remove the coating, and they rust.


I prime the cans with 25-35 g of sugar for a full 5 ltr can. Leave about an
inch of air space to aid in fast carbonation. Good luck.

Bleach is very corrosive against stainless steel at higher concentrations and
temperatures. I would suggest reducing the amount of bleach if you don't want
to ruin your dishwasher. Short soaking in dilute bleach, a rinse with a jet
washer and drip dry is also easy and should work just as well.

Same experience I had- I call it a phloating phalse bottom.  Tis a pity the
instructions that come with the thing don't include a warning...  Scrap
brass fastened to the false bottom helps as does jiggling it about in the
foundation water to dislodge the air bubbles adhearing to the holes in the
thing. I now use a slotted copper manifold instead- it's much better and

Subject: +/-'s of 6-row malt??


Greetings all,
I am gearing up to brew a Belgian Wit and planning on using unmalted 
wheat to make up about 45% of the grain bill.  Concerned about the 
possibility of a stuck sparge, I was thinking of using a 6-row pale malt 
to make up some (or all) of the remaining bill.  This would guarantee a 
better filter bed and would also increase the mash's diastatic power.   
Unfortunately, any discussion of the pros and cons of 6-row is scarce 
and, so far, Noonan's in BLB is the best I have been able to find.  As 
many of your know, his evaluation of this type of malt is 
less-than-flattering and rather curt.  Here are his misgivings and my 
questions:


1)He says that this type of malt's high protein content will cause problems 
with "clairity and stability"--What does he mean by stability?  Won't a 
good protein rest(s) do the trick here? 


2)The finished beer will be darker and heavier tasting--Why is this?  
6-row is generally rated as only contributing 1.7L/lb/gal.


3)The husk to endosperm ratio will lead to "harsh flavors"--Is he merely
referring to tannins here?  Won't attention to mash pH obviate any 
problems here?


Any additional info would be greatly appreciated.


FWIW, I found a fantastic source for hard-to-find brewing ingredients.  It's 
the Mountain Malt&Hop Shop in Syracuse, NY, ph# 1 800 295-MALT.  They 
have a lot of good stuff including dried bitter orange peel for sale by the 
ounce!  They fellow I talked to was very kind and helpful.  No 
affiliations etc.


Cheers,

Subject: First Wort Hopping Web Page


Dear Friends, I have put together a short web page containing an 
augmented version of  the summary of the FWH article that I posted 
recently.  I have expanded certain sections of  the post to address 
some of  the questions that were raised, and which I addressed in my 
second FWH post; and I have included a brief section at the end 
containing some of  the comments and opinions that have come up here 
since then.  The page is accessible via my beer page: 


http://audio.apana.org.au/ddraper/beer.html


What I would also like to call for is some input from those of you
Out There who have used the FWH technique already.  What I'd like is
to have the page also act as a sort of repository for brief
descriptions of applications of this technique and your subjective
assessment of how successful you think it was.  What I have in mind
is putting together a little table consisiting of the following
info: brewer, style made, amount & variety of FWH added, other
hopping details (bittering additions, dry-hopped or not, etc), target
IBUs, OG, FG, and comments.  Real simple stuff--just so folks can, as
the data accumulate, get a sense for how well it works on a homebrew
scale, which styles it seems to work best for, that sort of thing.


I will simply keep an eye peeled for FWH posts here in HBDland, and
add the results to the page as they are posted, so I am asking anyone
who posts on the procedure in future to include the data above. 
Those of you whom I know for sure have already brewed FWH beers
include Eric Miller, Tracy Aquilla, John Palmer, Andy Walsh, and Jim
DiPalma.  For those of you who have already got the complete data, if
you guys would be willing to email me these details, I'd be very
grateful--your results (along with those on my first attempts, to be
reported within a couple weeks here) will be the first on the page. 
If you'd rather just post it once here and have done (e.g., Tracy, I
know you've got stuff in the pipe that you will be posting here
eventually), that's fine too.  Whatever you're willing to do.


Thanks for all input, and hope you all find the thing useful.

Subject: Hand stuck in carboy






After bottling a batch yesterday, I washed my carboy, as I 
always do, by putting a couple of quarts of strong, hot ammonia
solution in it, and shaking vigorously, followed by several hot
rinses.  I made a serious error and used cold water for the last
rinse.  When I shook the carboy (with my hand sealing the opening),
the vacuum suddenly created was strong enough to suck my hand 
into the neck up to my wrist, where it remains firmly (and
uncomfortably) lodged.


I don't want to break the carboy if I don't have to, but this
is a serious inconvenience, as you can imagine (for example,
I am forced to dictate this message to a friend).  Has anyone
had a similar experience?  I remember the copious stopper-
stuck-in-carboy thread a few months ago, and I am really hoping
for similar concern about my predicament.  Please write soon.


Is my hand ruined?

Subject: cleaning a real gross corny keg


        I just bought a used Corny keg that used to have the lemon-lime 
soda Slice, in it.  I have tried to clean it using just Clorox and 
water.  I have let it soak for days on two seperate occasions, but I 
can't get the sweet smell out of it.  Is there a better cleaner that I 
can use.  I have never used B-bright or idiophor (?) so I have no 
experience with these products.  Will they work better than Clorox?  Is 
there anthing else I can use?  Thanks in advance...

Subject: Recipe request


I just opened my first bottles of my first batch of homebrew and
I am extremely pleased with the outcome. The only problem that I have
with the brew is that I was expecting a lighter bodied brew, with
not quite as much hop distincion. With all of the talk on the list, I
assume that most subscribers would frown upon my taste in beer. Don't
get me wrong, I love brews like Sam Adams and Bass Ale, but for an
every day brew that everyone in the house likes, I'd have to make
a more typical American brew. Since I'm not the only person that
invested in the equipment and supplies, I need to make everyone else
a batch of their favorite brew, a Michelob clone. Can anyone help
me out here?  I don't even have a clue as to make clones, since I've
only brewed one batch of brew, which was a kit of pale ale.  I want to
brew my next batch by getting away from the kit and adding my own hops,
etc.  I guess that I want more control of the outcome, not have a kit
determine what the brew will taste like.
I hope that someone out there can give me a recipe for the typical
American beer (preferably a Michelob clone)
Thanks in advance

Ladies and Gentlebrewers......


This first (potentialy last) batch of stout has been an unmitigated (is 
that a word?) disaster!  For the first time in my <short> brewing history 
did a blow off tube carry more than a thimble full of crap out of the 
carboy!  I should have POURED it out of the carboy, it would have been 
less painfull.  This was also the first time that I tried a 4 litre yeast 
starter that had chugged away fir a couple of days prior to B-day.  I 
also tried out Irish Moss (seaweed).  A 'nice clear beer' I was told.  I 
expected trub, not as much as I got though!  I simply figured that this 
would settle to the bottem and I could siphon off it when the time came.  
WRONG AGAIN!  This 'stuff' seemed to combine with the disintigrated hop 
pellets (hate them, but can't get the whole ones around here.  Plugs make 
a diff?) and was like trying to siphon wet concrete!  Anyway, I ended up 
with about 3 1/2 gal in the secondary.  The good news is, that with all 
of my troubles so far, I don't seem to have an infected batch on my 
hands.  Any sugestions as to what I can do so that I don't go bald, or 
put a large dent in my supply of brew, and in so doing and in so doing 
becopming rather intoxicated?  I started this hobby because I enjoy good 
beer.  I didn't expect it to drive me to drink!  I bought a 'hop bag' 
with my supplies for the next batch.  I'm skeptical about how well this 
will work.  The bags are made out of cheese cloth.  That MIGHT filter out 
the trub, but I'm not sure.  I'm on the verg of trying a German style 
Wheat Beer, but damn, I don't want this nightmare to happen again.  So, 
in closing:




                        HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!
