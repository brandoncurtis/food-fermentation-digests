and commented that his light lagers suffer from "bite". He suspects that
this has something to do with the bicarbonates and this is probably correct
but sulfate, even at this low level, could also be a contributor at the
high hopping levels found in Pilsners. The effects of carbonate are largely
felt through the alkalinity (which is mostly caused by carbonate) which
results in higher mash pH's than might be desired. One approach is to
neutralize the alkalinity with acid (such as lactic) in the mash to the
extent that the mash pH is within the desired range (5.2 - 5.4) at
sachharification temperature. Some authors believe that high levels of
bicarbonate, even if neutralized, will have a negative effect on the beer.


The obvious approach is to try to remove the bicarbonate from the water and
the usual method is boiling. Boiling is unlikely to precipitate any
carbonate from this water. Precipitation is predicted from a couple of
"indices". Neither indicates that precipitation will occur although the
water will be supersaturated with chalk if boiling raises the pH to above
7.6 which it is, of course, likely to do. While the indices are not
infallible, my limited experience also suggests that precipitation is not
likely with this water. Remember that leaving boiled water to cool over
night will allow it to pick up CO2 from the air so that the pH goes back
down and some of the precipitated chalk, if any, redissolves.


The bicarbonate can be precipitated by adding lots of calcium (which will
benefit the beer in other ways as well) but there are catches to this
approach. Gypsum is a source of calcium but also of sulfate so that adding
gypsum will aggravate the bite problem. Calcium chloride adds the calcium
without sulfate but the chloride also goes up and this may be an approach
that could be explored for ales but you already have more chloride than is
desireable for some lagers. Calcium chloride is a little difficult to find
but someone mentioned that there is a homebrew mailorder house that sells
the dihidrate in food grade. Unfortunately, I can't remember who that is.
Another source of calcium is lime either as quick lime (calcium oxide) or
slaked lime (calcium hydroxide). The problem with them is that a source of
food grade lime is difficult to find and that detailed, accurate
calculations are required for the addition and even then the results are
not fully predictable. DeClerk recommends working with test batches of
water followed by analysis before making the adjustments to the production
water. All this is too elaborate for the homebrewer.


What seems to make most sense in this case is dilution of the municipal
water with distilled water. 50:50 dilution will get the alkalinity down to
around 100 ppm and this is adequate for most brews. Bohemian Pilsners are
always the exception. They must be brewed with very soft water and few
brewers are fortunate enough to have water that soft (but I have seen a
couple of analyses posted here that fit the bill). For these beers brewers
must use distilled or deionized or reverse osmosis water in order to
eliminate the bite. You may wish to try a brew with 100% distilled or RO
water. Be careful not to sparge past the point where runoff pH excedes 6
(or maybe a bit less, say 5.8) and don't expect great conversion efficiency
but the difference between the distilles water beer and what you usually
brew will tell you what the effects of your water are.

Given enough time Brettanomyces will attenuate to 90% or greater. So the 65-75%

From: Paul Ward <paulw`at`doc.state.vt.us>
Subject: Adjunct Question(s)


Well, I', finally moving up one carefull notch at a time in this
brewing hobby.  After several all extract batches, I brewed
'Elbro Nerkte' this past weekend, which was my first experience
using adjunct grains (crystal and black patent).


Following the guidance of St. Charles the Papazian (and this
collective), I placed my grains in one of those heavy plastic
bags with a "zipper" closure, set it on my marble pastry board
abd beset it with my marble rolling pin.  My wife wandered out to
see what I was doing in her kitchen.  "Crushing my grains," I
replied.  She asked why I didn't use our electric coffee grinder
(one of those new fangled devices with blades in it that can
pulverize coffee beans in 12 seconds).  I explained that the
grains needed to be 'cracked' into 3 to 5 pieces, leaving the
hulls intact.  "Why," she asked?  "So I don't get a stuck sparge
or undesirable tannins from the husks in my wort," I answered. 
"What's a sparge," she innocently inquired?  Only then did it
dawn on me, I DON'T HAVE A SPARGE TO GET STUCK!  "How do the
grain husks cause tannins," she next asked?  I explained how the
husks would release tannic acid if boiled, and it dawned on me
that the grains (and husks) are removed from the water BEFORE the
boil.  My wife smirked and told me to make sure I cleaned her
stove when I was done 'playing.'


So anyway,  my questions are:


     If I use the rolling pin method, how do I know when I've
     sufficientlly crushed the grains?  That 3 to 5 piece rule
     leaves a little something to be desired if you don't know
     what you're looking for.


     Since I'm not sparging (other than straining througha seive
     with cheesecloth in it), what difference does it make how
     small the grain pieces are?  Wouldn't finely pulverized
     particles dissolve more readily (not the particles, the
     sugars in them)?


     I heated a gallon and a half of cold water to ~150 F and
     held the grains at that temperature for about 15 minutes,
     then raised the temp to the start of boiling when I
     strained out the grains.  Can I cause HSA by aerating this
     hot 'adjunct tea' by straning before adding the malt
     extract?


Well, that's enough for one morning.  I appreciate this forum and
the help I have received in the past. 


Thanks all.


Paul

I'm sure most of you out there have stories you could tell 
about the effects of drinking cheap beer on one's behaviour.
My wife gets particularly squirrely when she drinks beer with 
lots of adjuncts/additives/preservatives. Can anyone point me 
to any studies or reference material on how and/or why
adjuncts/additives in beer affect us physically or mentally. 
My wife is taking a graduate course relating to alcohol use

Tom, I'm willing to help you out here. Give your wife lots of whatever it is
that makes her "squirrely" and send her to me.  I'll test and report back.

Subject: My First Partial Mash - Description and Questions






  Well, I did my first partial-mash Saturday night,                             
and I must say that all-in-all it was a good experience.                        
I'm glad I did a partial rather than a full mash, as I did                      
make some mistakes, and the 50% extract may help save the                       
batch.                                                                          
  I wanted to do the partial mash with -no- purchase of                         
extra equipment, so my sparge vessel consisted of a 2                           
gallon bucket with lots-o-holes drilled in the bottom                           
suspended over the top of my 6 gallon bottling bucket.  As                      
you might guess, this resulted in the sparge water dripping                     
about 1 ? feet from the sparge vessel to the bottom of the                      
bucket.                                                                         
 After collecting my wort, and adding my extract, I had                         
about 2 7/8 gallons to boil (in a 3 gallon boiler) so I                         
had to be very careful of boil over.  I successfully                            
avoided boil over, and within 30 minutes had a good                             
rolling boil going.                                                             
  Throughout the process, I was chanting the mantra...                          
Relax... Don't Worry...  Have a Homebrew... (And I did)                         


On to my questions.                                                             


1:  Is hot side aeration going to seriously affect my brew.                     


2a:  The recipe called for 1 lb. brown sugar.  I                                
     mistakenly added this to the mash, and I'm afraid                          
     it all got filtered out during sparge.  Will I lose                        
     the flavor the Brown Sugar was supposed to add?                            


2b:  My Starting Gravity was Way low.  1.034 instead of                         
     1.047 predicted.  I believe this may be due to 2a,                         
     or poor extraction during sparge.  Will this seriously                     
     affect the flavor, or simply lower the Alcohol                             
     content?                                                                   


The batch is now in the primary fermenter, and                                  
appears to be progessingnicely despite all my                                   
attempts to kill it...  :-)

Subject: Advice on getting that "bitter" flavor






        My brewing partner and I have been fairly
successful so far in the brews we're putting together.
We've not tried grain brewing yet, but will get there
eventually.  One problem we've had is getting a truely
sharp, bitter taste in our bitters.  By and large, we've
wound up with a tendency for a somewhat sweet and 
gentle bitter.  What's the secret?  We've certainly
let things ferment to the end, and have applied what
seems to have been the right variety and amount of
hops.  It there something we're missing here?
Any help appreciated.

Subject: Carbonates and Water Analysis & Synthesis


I've been in some discussions about water analysis/synthesis with regards to
"carbonate" and "alkalinity" and am presenting the following for review and
comment.


In developing BreWater as a tool for massaging water makeup for brewing
purposes, I've discovered that there are certain aspects of the problem which
are simple and straightforward and certain others which are aggravatingly
flaky.  Adding one gram of table salt to a gallon of ion-free water DOES
result in 104 ppm sodium ion and 160 ppm chloride ion.  Adding one gram of
chalk DOES result in 106 ppm calcium ion and 158 ppm carbonate.  The
difference is that in the case of table salt, what you see is what you get.
It's it and that's that. In the case of chalk (and baking soda), the
"carbonate" has its own plan...


"Carbonates" exist in water as a mixture of carbonate (CO3--), bicarbonate
(HCO3-), and carbonic (dissolved CO2).  with the relative concentrations of
these "species" depending on the pH of the water.  In the case of water
synthesized with only chalk and/or baking soda, the concentration ratios and
the resulting pH is actually predictible from the amount of chalk and baking
soda added.  On the other hand, the pH of a "natural" water may be further
influenced by any number of other water components.


The problem is compounded by the fact that published water profiles may give
the carbonates under either "CO3" or "HCO3" labels.  This may be based on an
assumption that at the pH of the "natural" water, there is a predominance of
one or the other.  It may also be a default, blind "lumping" of all three
carbon species into one figure for "simplicity".  In any case, it's only part
of the story.


The "buffering" capacity ("alkalinity") of a given concentration of
*carbonate* (say from chalk) versus *bicarbonate* (say from baking soda) is
different, and it's the *buffering capacity* that we are really interested
in, since this is what counteracts the mash's ability to acidify to "optimum"
pH levels.  If one profile gives "carbonate" and the next "bicarbonate", is
the author blindly "lumping" all the species under one label or is s/he
assuming a predominance of one over the other based on other water
characteristics?  Or perhaps s/he is giving the equivalent (bi)carbonate
concentration which gives rise to the water's alkalinity?  How should we deal
with the "carbonate", "bicarbonate", and "alkalinity" figures in working with
BreWater (or any other water adjustment plan)?


For additions of chalk and baking soda, BreWater adjusts the alkalinity
contributed by them based on the fact that bicarbonate (from baking soda) is
half as "alkaline" (half the buffering capacity) of the carbonate contributed
by chalk.  100 ppm "CO3" from chalk is twice as alkaline (166 ppm) as the
alkalinity from 100 ppm of what's labelled "CO3" (actually HCO3) from baking
soda (alk = 83 ppm).  Whether the alkalinity exists as carbonate or
bicarbonate doesn't matter as much as the solution's alkalinity or buffering
capacity.  The label "CO3" in BreWater could perhaps be more accurately
labelled "HCO3" since water synthesized only from BreWater's salts will have
a pH in a range where bicarbonates dominate, but in "natural" water further
treated with salts, it's not an easy task to determine the mix without lots
of additional information.  In either case it's not going to be totally right
since it will always be a mix anyway.  The use of the "CO3" label arises from
the desire to express "as CaCO3", which is typical of a municipal analysis.


Bottom line is that if the alkalinity is kept under control, the number under
the "CO3" label is not that important.  In a few rare cases the target
profile's alkalinity is given, but in most it is not.  Fortunately, the
*total alkalinity* of "your" starting water (tap water or whatever) is
usually given in the municipal supplier's analysis.  The additional
alkalinity supplied by additions of chalk and/or baking soda will yield a
final alkalinity figure that should accurately represent the resulting
*alkalinity* of the brewing water.


But how does that relate to a target profile giving only "carbonate" or
"bicarbonate", but not "alkalinity"?  If a target calls for "75 ppm CO3"
without stating "alkalinity", what's the synthesis plan?


This is where I get dizzy and begin wheezing, so if I'm off-base here, I'd
appreciate some help.  The following will result in rough estimates rather
than exact figures, but should at least put you on the right planet.


One very rough approach might be to assume that the resulting water will be
in the range of pH where bicarbonate predominates, and to go with the
equivalent 1 ppm bicarbonate = 0.83 ppm alkalinity.  So "75 ppm CO3" means
"75 ppm bicarbonate" which equates to 62 ppm alkalinity.  This will most
likely be "wrong" but in the absence of other information it should give you
an order-of-magnitude figure to use.  Once you have the alkalinity figure,
use it as a target rather than "CO3" when adding chalk and/or baking soda.


What about dealing with a municipal analysis in terms of deriving "CO3" and
"alkalinity" figures for starting water makeup?  In situations where neither
is given outright, you'll have to play some games too.  Using the "total
alkalinity" figure for "alkalinity" should be accurate.  In the range of pH <
8.4, the "bicarbonate" and the analysis' "total alkalinity" figure would be
roughly the same.  Above this pH the picture changes.  But realizing that
municipal analyses are averages and often vary greatly over time, this is
probably as good a "guess" as any, and again will give you a starting figure
which will give you an idea of where your water is on the brewability scale.
 So using "total alkalinity" for both "alkalinity" and "CO3" would be
reasonable.


Now you have both beginning and target estimates for alkalinity, so add your
chalk and baking soda using target alkalinity rather than target "CO3" as a
guide.  In any event, it's a good general "rule" to minimize alkalinity, so
view this estimate as a maximum in any event.


For straight synthesis from ion-free water, BreWater equates the bicarbonate
from baking soda to the equivalent amount of CO3 by accounting for the extra
hydrogen atom in bicarb (it multiplies HCO3 by 60/61).  The 2:1 ratio of
alkalinity between CO3 (chalk) and HCO3 (baking soda) as described above is
also accounted for.  So the resulting calculation yields an "as CaCO3" figure
for CO3, and an adjusted "alkalinity" figure.

In HBD 1999, Bob Bloodworth asked:

Force carbonation in these cans is simple.  All you need is a tap that
accepts CO2 cartridges and a Liquid Bread carbonator cap.  The carbonator
cap screws onto the threads that hold in the CO2 cartridge and you can
connect your ball lock fitting from for CO2 cylinder.  Fill the keg, chill,
carbonate as usual.


One word of warning - the newer version of the carbonator cap has a ridge
around the inside that helps the seal against the PET bottle.  You will
either have to cut/chip the ridge out or use an old version for force
carbonating.


This works great - its an easy way to take some of your beer to a party
with minimal brain damage and bottle transport.  And its a lot easier to
shake a 5l keg to force carbonate that it is a soda keg!  I've actually
kegged a portion of a batch and dispensed it this way connected to the CO2
line instead of using the cartridges.


Thanks to Ed Westemeier for originally describing this technique in an
article for the Bloatarian Bulletin.

There's a solution to your problem that involves a bit more time and
expense than you would normally want to expend to recover a stopper
from your carboy.  The trick is to find a mathematician who is a
glass-blowing hobbiest.  Have him (CAREFULLY!) re-configure the carboy
as a Klein bottle (more-or-less the 3-D equivalent of a Moebius
strip).  Once that is done, the carboy will no longer have an "inside"
or an "outside", and you should have no difficulty removing your hand.
Of course, a "Klein carboy" may pose some unique problems for filling
and sanitizing, but I leave the solution to those as an exercise for
the student.

Subject: Force Priming Mini-kegs




Robert asks about force carbonating in mini-kegs.   The answer is a very 
simple yes.  At the auto supply shops, one can buy rubber tire air valve 
that will just fit into the press out bung hole in the mini-keg stopper from 
the inside.  By fitting your CO2 tank with and tire air filler assembly 
(again from the auto supply store) you can then force carbonate the 
mini-kegs.  When you get ready to tap the keg simply push in the air valve 
into the keg as you would the normally push in the bung.  Works like a 
champ.  My original concern with this was that the rubber in the air valve 
would add an unwanted flavor to the beer, but having tried beer dispensed in 
this manner, I can report that it worked and didn't taste any different. 
 The cost to try this is only a few dollars.

        Goodday All,

                the temp had risen to 180 F.  It took a while to cool down.
                I usually "mash out" for 5 minutes at the end of the mash 
                by raising the temp to 167 F.  Mashing out slows down

Unmalted Rye will give you -no- color and a -lot- of flavor.  I have no 
experience, firsthand or otherwise, with malted rye.  If you want to use 
unmalted rye (which can be great in some recipes), try to find "flaked rye"
from a healthfood store - already gelatinized and much easier than boiling 
rye berries or something like that.

If I had to take a guess, I'd say it's not what -is- in those beers,
but rather what is -not- in them.  First, most of "cheap beer" you 
buy is going to be heavily filtered, which will take out the zinc and
B vitamins and other nutrients you might get from yeast in -some- 
good beers.  Second, most cheap beers have very little in the way of
protein and residual sugars, compared to Guiness or a good bock or a 
homebrew.  A serious deficit in any of these things can influence 
behavior, and people vary in their sensitivity to them.  However, all
of them can also be found in a good meal.  So, have your wife eat while
drinking.  Do some experiments.  :-)


The one thing that some really cheap beers will have more than "regular"
beers, but less than many homebrews and exotic beers, are fusel alcohols.
I mostly associate those with a "harsh" taste, a headache (both before 
and during a regular hangover), and a 'confused' feeling.  I don't know
if they'll make someone resemble a squirrel or other small mammals,
but it's feasible.

Definately.  Adjust your expectations of extraction based on the different
content of your mash.


btw, crystal malt is a 'specialty grain' which is very different from an
adjunct.  If you're going to be picky enough to worry about extraction
rates, you should learn the lingo.

I would never waste my time with a hydrometer during a sparge.  Taste the 
stuff.  If it tastes bad, don't use it.  I always stop sparging when I have
7 gallons unless I have a lot of time to kill and a few extra containers.

Who cares?  The only thing I'd recommend you change is to include your 
adjuncts.  I have a ballpark idea of my rather variable extraction rate, and
I use that to figure how much grain I'll need.  Beyond that, I don't worry
much about it, and I don't really know why anyone does.  (Enlighten me!)

Tannins.  I'll bet you 20 bucks.  Your sparge water might be too hot.
Your thermometer might be slower than you think.  (Like, it slows down 
and seems to stop at some temp, but if you leave it long enough, you
realize it's warmer than you thought.)  Or, it might just be giving
you bad readings.

Is that the mash in the lauter tun, or is that the sparge water?  THat's 
pretty darned hot - if that's your grain temp, that's the source of your
tannins.

I saw a nice idea. Mike O'Brien of Pico Brew showed me that the

a corney keg to carbonate PET bottles) screws right onto the mini keg
tapper where the CO2 cartridges go. The tapper he showed me was one of the

Subject: Wyeast Strains


Remember a while back when Tom Fitzpatrick said that he spoke to Dave
Logsdon at Wyeast and got the origins for many of the yeasts?  Remember
when I posted that Dave usually doesn't give out the the sources and
that I was suspicious of Tom's confidence in the yeast sources.


Well, I just got off the phone with Dave and asked him straight up if he
told Tom that Thames Valley Ale (#1275) is from Henley and that Belgian
Strong (#1388) was from Duvel.  Dave responded just as I remember him 
responding when I asked him about sources three years ago:  He said
"...well, Tom may have gotten the impression... we don't usually
give out the sources... these may or may not be the sources..."


I'm not saying that they are the sources of the yeasts, nor am I saying
that they are not.  Furthermore, I'm not saying that Dave is not telling
the truth nor that Tom is not telling the truth.  What I suspect, is that
Tom asked Dave point blank and that Dave gave a half-yes-half-maybe
answer (as he has always done with me) and Tom interpreted that as being
a yes.


I have talked to Dave about sources many times over the last six years or
so and he has always been rather protective and non-committal.  I don't
blame him.  I don't blame Tom for thinking he got a definate yes from
Dave.  I thought the same thing when I first talked to Dave about sources.


So, if you think that you know where a particular yeast is from and it
makes you happy and you can brew a killer Duvel clone from #1388, great!
But, don't take any of the matchings of Wyeasts with sources too seriously
because there is an awful lot of speculation infused into those matchings.

Subject: Hollander Extract Substitute




I have obtained a recipe calling for Hollander light malt syrup and
wonder if anyone is familiar enough with it to recommend a substitute
of a grain.  Just pale malt?  I have no trouble with hitting OG, I
just don't know how fermentable/unfermentable or how malty this
extract is.


thanks,
dion

A similar thing happened to me just a year ago.  Only I put my lips on the 
carbouy before I shook it and it sucked my brains into it.

Oh, by the way to get my brains back out I just put some boiling water in 
the carbouy and gave it a good shake and the resulting pressure blew them 
back out.  Maybe you can do something similar with your hand.

Subject: Sam Smith's Oat Stout Clone recipe?


I was looking through the March issue of All Aboout Beer magazine and =
noticed that one of my favorite beers, Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, =
scored a whopping 99 out of 100 at the 96 world beer championships.  I =
have tried many oatmeal stout recipes but have never come close to this =
one.  Does anyone have a clone recipe for this beer?

I suggest that you ask your shop to suggest some unhopped malt
extracts from which to choose.  I have had great success with the
Alexanders Sun Country Pale Malt Extract.  I have decided to use
this in a base for most of my future brews because I understand
that most brews begin as pale.  The eventual color, taste...of
the finished product depends on where you go from there(hops,
grains...).  Anyways, I can elaborate on a real easy recipe for
using an unhopped malt extract (Alexanders or otherwise) if you
want to e-mail me. We don't want to plug up the bands with
Extract gibberish now do we???  The finished product comes
"close"(I use quotes because I don't want to degrade my brew
anymore than needed) to the taste of a comercial brew you want to
serve your non adventerous/handcrafting appreciative friends.


My first comminique with the HBD, I might as well respond to a
fellow Bulldog!  Sick em!  Whole hearted thanks to all for the
input here.

I'm now a believer! Had samples of my very first homebrew batches set 
aside for aging for quite a few months, and I'm really impressed. Even 
my very first batch, which I forgot to strain the hops from, had a much 
smoother and mellower taste than it did at first. Now all I have to do 
is get another 20 cases of empties so I can be patient enough to wait 
the proper time, and still have some "good" beer to drink!

Subject: Wort Cooling


Hi, Clay. Had the same problem here, as house is kept fairly warm for 
tropical birds. This tip from the local Brewmeister did the trick for 
me. I keep my 6 gallon carboy in a plastic (metal would work) tub, with 
about 3 to 6 inches of water in the bottom. A good sized towel wrapped 
around the carboy and touching the water will act like a wick, sucking 
up the water, and cooling the wort by evaporation. That kept the wort 
temp down to about 68. I picked up a cheap ($7) clip-on fan at Target, 
and on low setting aimed at the towel, the wort stays a nice chilly 60 
degrees! Just a couple of warnings! I go through about a gallon of water 
a day, and that's here in Iowa. You'll probably go through more if your 
part of Texas is arid. Also, if you use a water-filled airlock on top of 
your fermentor, set this up prior to adding the yeast. If you drop the 
wort temp with the yeast added, it can (and has) sucked the water right 
out of the airlock into the wort. This cooling will also extend the 
fermentation time, and also result in much less violent fermentation. 
I've CC'd this to the collective, just in case I really have taken leave 
of my (few) senses and someone wants to set me straight! On the other 
hand, this may be a valuable hint! Good luck.

Cedar Rapids has a new brew-pub named "Cedar Brewing Company" on 
Blairs Ferry Road. This is not a commercial post - I have not yet even 
sampled their brew!
