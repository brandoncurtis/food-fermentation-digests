I'm skeptical.  Curacao orange peel is not orange (it's kind of grayish-
green) and it does not add a "grocery store" orange flavour.  The flavour
it adds has been called "similar to Chamomille."  Incidentally, I think
that it is the yeast that gives Celis White its orange-like flavour.  I
made a clone in which I did not add any orange peel at all and used the
Wyeast Belgian Witbier (#3944) and got a strong orange aroma and flavour.

Have you ever seen very old bottles of some imports with a sort of jelly-
like white stuff in the bottom?  This is coagulated protein.  I suspect
that this is what Noonan's talking about.  Yes, a good protein rest will
take care of those proteins.

Hmmm... Perhaps he's thinking more tannins would mean more colour (which
it would if you're not careful), but if you watch the pH it should not be
a problem.

Yes.  If you watch pH, it's not a problem.

Just crush them till 90% or more of the grains are broken open.

Earlier in his post, Paul's wife was suggesting a coffee grinder, so
this is why he asks about why pulverized grains (which is definitely
what you would get in a coffee grinder) would be a problem.  Well, if
you crush the grains too fine, you won't be able to get a lot of the
husk pieces out of the wort (a lot will slip through your cheesecloth)
and you would end up boiling them.

Yes, aerating this crystal malt and dark malt "tea" (they are not really
adjuncts -- adjucts are things like potatoes, corn, cornstarch, wheat
flour... non-malt starch sources) would cause oxidation of malt compounds
which would give similar flavours to those you get from aerating hot wort.
Not as noticeable as if you aerated the whole 5 gallons of finished 1.050
wort when it was hot, but I recommend avoiding it anyway.

Sulphates!  That's the key.  That long, dry, bitter finish is a
result of high hop rates and high levels of sulphates.  Find out
what your water has and add gypsum till you get it up to about
500-700 ppm of sulphate.

Yes it is a problem but not as much as with an all-barley malt beer since
the wheat has no husks.  You should still watch the pH and keep it from
getting too much over 5.8 or so.

Sounds like a great temperature for ales.  Some yeasts work rather slowly
at these temperatures, but there are very few that won't work at all.  If
you use a decent-sized starter (500ml or more), virtually any yeast will
be very happy.

Entries are now being accepted for the 2nd Small and Tiny Homebrew
Competition, through April 12.  See


        http://realbeer.com/spencer/AABG/Small_and_Tiny.html


or send me e-mail and I'll snail-mail you entry info ASAP.


The web page includes an on-line entry form that will create bottle
labels for you to print out and attach to your entry.


What's it about?  The S&T competition recognizes those low-gravity
beers with real character.  Sure, big beers are fun to make (and drink
:-), but some of the best beers I've had have been "poundable"
(that's one you can "pound" all night and still drive home).  


In ordinary competitions, these beers usually don't do well, because
they're overpowered by the big guys.  Well, the big guys can't enter
this competition.


Any beer with an OG 1.043 or less is eligible to enter and win!  Beers
with an OG 1.035 or less get their own category ("Tiny"), too.

Those aren't adjunct grains.  Those are specialty malts.  It may
sound picky, but they are two very different things.

Don't powder them, and make sure that their husks are broken.

That's the problem - the particles ALSO dissolve more readily, and you
don't want them in your beer.  (Many of them become suspended rather 
than dissolve, but you still don't want them in yer wort.)

Are you doing full-volume boils?  If you're not, your hop utilization will 
be really low.  (FVB is when you boil all of it together at once, as opposed
to boiling up part of it and adding to cold water.)

Well, unless you're doing 100% wheat, the barley in there will be as 
problematic as barley anywhere else.  I think there is less tannin in 
wheat malt than barley malt, maybe none at all, but I don't really know.

Two of my friends and I did the same thing on Sunday.  Expect a full report 
soon.  The stuff smelled GREAT while brewing, very spicey.  The sample in the 
hydrometer tasted good, but not overhopped.  I'm pretty hopeful.


>  I had no problems with runnoff.


Neither did we.  We decided to try using a little barley in there, and some 
rice hulls, too.  (I've done it without rice hulls, and it seemed to work 
fine, too.)


For Seven Gallons (two batches, one 3 gal, one 4 gal, details fuzzy):


10# Belgian Wheat
2# Belgian Pils
1# rice hulls.  (You fargin rice hulls!)


I don't have the whole mash schedule here.  We did a step infusion mash.


We got pretty low extraction, which I usually get with so much wheat.  


In the 4 gallon, we FWH'd with 1 oz Hersbrucker Hallertau 3%, and then 
added 1.5 more 60 minutes before the end of the boil.  In the 3 gallon, we
did no FWH, but added 2 oz. to the boil, all of it 60 minutes before the end.  
Then, 15 minutes before the end, we added about 1 2/3 oz freshly grated 
ginger.  We'll see how it turns out.


Michael - what kind of hops and how much did you use?

I live in Central Florida, where we think it's an Artic cold-front when it
drops to below freezing.  It does get that cold a couple of days a year.
But in the summer I keep the house at 80, my carboy in a pan of water,
wrapped with a towel.  It's amazing, but the wort is kept around 67F.  I
wouldn't have believed that the evaporating cooling effect would drop it 13F.

I was wondering why I don't get violent ferments anymore.  They went away
about the time I starting putting my carboy in a pan of water.  (Actually a

Subject: Hmm!  Must be doing something wrong


I don't use my hydrometer anymore.  I just watch the bubbles drop to about
2-3 per minute, and the beer's done.


I don't measure points, I just use a 3lb coffee can (three times) and 1lb
coffee can to scoop out my grain.


I do actually weight my hops, but don't really pay attention to the alpha
levels, though I do try and use the same type of hops.


My conversation stage temp (whatever the technical term is)  is anywhere
from 150-165F.


My sparge is starts around 180-190F, I believe it drops to about 170F by the
time it hits the grain.  Not sure, I just make sure it goes slow, and use
somewhere around 7 gallons of water.  I think that's out big my water bucket is.


But darn it, the beer keeps coming out tasting good.  What the heck am I
doing right?  Maybe one day I'll start paying more attention to the
scientific stuff.


So what's this moron trying to say?  For you newbies out there, worrying,
well darn it, just stop it.  Make the beer, drink it and relax.

Regarding mushroom "Pilsner"...Al Stevens is the victim of 
a punster. Germans frequently refer to pilsner beer as "pils"
and usually order it as such. The pronunciation is identical
to "Pilz" which is German for "mushroom". There is no connection
to the flora of the Czech Republic.

Subject: Mushrooms in my beer!


All,


I don't know about you, but I find this recent thread on mushroom beer
rather amusing.  For the record, I agree with Steve Alexander that many
mushrooms are poisionous and should be avoided.  Other mushrooms, however,
are quite tasty and in fact, can make really great beer!


Here in the Pacific North West, it rains a lot and the damp environment is
ideal for all sorts of wild mushrooms.  As a result, local brewers have
adapted amazingly well and many have developed quite a repetoire of
mushroom-related beers.  Some, in fact, are so wonderful that they'll keep
you up for hours just thinking (as if in circles) about them!


If you are ever in this neck of the woods, check out some of the local
favorites like Cubenza Cream Ale, Blue Ringer Stout, Fat Cap Lager and my
personal favorite, Psilocybin Porter.  You won't believe your eyes... CDR

carbonate solution. The relative concentrations depend upon the pH. The
ASCII art is crude so some key pH's are marked. At pH 4.3 99% of the ions
are carbonic, 1% bicarbonate and while carbonate ions are present they are
orders of magnitude less present than bicarbonate. At pH 6.38 carbonic and
bicarbonate are present in equal amounts (about 50% each) and carbonate
unappreciable. At pH 8.35, 98% of ions are bicarbonate and there are about
1% carbonic and carbonate. At 10.32 bicarbonate and carbonate are at equal
concentration (about 50%) and carbonic is unappreciable and at pH 12.6 all
but about 1% of ions are carbonate ions. The curves are easily constructed.
Calculate r1 = 10^(pH - 6.38) and r2 = 10^(pH - 10.32). The fraction of
carbonic is then 1/(1 + r1 + r1*r2), the fraction of bicarbonate is r1
times this and the fraction of carbonate is r2 times the bicarbonate
fraction.


The total alkalinity is defined as the number of millilitres of "normal"
acid required to change the pH of 1 L of the water sample to 4.3 which pH
is chosen because the indicator methyl orange begins to show a color change
at that point and at that pH most (99%) of the ions have been converted to
carbonic. One milliliter of "normal" acid contains 1 milliequivalent of
hydrogen ions and thus the definition of total alkalinity is the number of
milliequivalents of H+ required to bring one litre of the test water to a
pH where virtually all the bicarbonate and carbonate have been converted.


If you put 50 mg of calcium carbonate into a litre of water and slowly add
acid to the point where pH 4.3 is reached you will find that 1
milliequivalent of acid was required. Somewhere along the line someone
decided that it would be nice to have alkalinity reflect the amount of
calcium carbonate dissolved and so the practice of expressing alkalinity in
mg/L (or ppm) "as CaCO3" came into being. This causes lots of confusion
because it is really only another way of expressing the number of
milliequivalents. All alkalinty does not come from calcium carbonate. It
may also come from sodium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, sodium
bicarbonate etc. To express alkalinity "as CaCO3", multiply
milliequivalents per litre (mEq/L) by 50.


As Ken mentioned in his post, life is easy if the pH is less than 8.35 (as
it is for most but not all drinking waters). Below this pH the only thing
in the solution to convert to carbonic is bicarbonate (ignoring the tiny
amount of carbonate). The reaction is HCO3- + H+ --> H2CO3 which indicates
that 1 milliequivalent of acid converts one millimole of bicarbonate ion to
carbonic. Thus the total alkalinity is the amount of bicarbonate in the
water both, at this point, expressed as milliequivalents. Multiplying by 50
gives "as CaCO3" units but remember that this is just another way of
expressing the milliequivalents. It does not mean that that much calcium
carbonate is or ever was in the water nor that caclium carbonate was the
source of the bicarbonate ions. In fact if the water is natural much of the
bicarbonate probably came from dissolved CO2.  The ppm for bicarbonate ion
is obtained by multiplying the mEq/L by 61.


If the pH is above 8.35 the amount of carbonate starts to become
appreciable as does the concentration of hydroxyl ions. The alkalinity is
now the amount of acid required to convert the bicarbonate to carbonic PLUS
the amount required to convert the carbonate PLUS the amount required to
neutralize the hydroxyl ions. Carbonate converts as  CO3-- + 2H+  --> H2CO3
which says that TWO milliequivalents of acid are required for the
conversion of each millimole of carbonate. The amount of carbonate present
in a water at pH > 8.35 can be determined by adding acid until pH 8.35
(usually 8.3 is used as this is the pH at which the indicator
phenolpthalein changes) is reached. This is the pH at which the carbonate
is converted to bicarbonate by CO3-- + H+ --> HCO3-. Thus the number of
milliequivalents required to do this is equal to the number of millimoles
of carbonate present and is sometimes referred to as the "phenolpthalein
alkalinity". This is, as above, multiplied by 50 to give the phenolpthalein
ALKALINITY as ppm CaCO3. In what has got to be the most confusing thing in
water chemistry, the amount of calcium carbonate which causes a
phenolphtalein alkalinity of P (as CaCO3) is 2P because twice as much acid
is required to convert from carbonate to carbonic as from carbonate to
bicarbonate and the "as CaCO3" definition can be thought of as being based
on total conversion.


What all this means is that of one wishes to compute the alkalinity of a
water he has synthesized he must sum the number of millimoles/L of all
bicarbonates he adds (computed by dividing the milligrams/L of the salt by
the gram molecular weight of the salt) with TWICE the sum of the number of
millimoles/L of all the carbonates. This is the total alkalinity expressed
as milliequivalents per litre and I wish everyone would use these units
instead of mg/L as CaCO3 but they dont so multiply mEq/L by 50 to get mg/L
(ppm) as CaCO3.


In attempting to synthesize water from a given profile one needs r1 and r2
which are easily calculated if either the pH or the
carbonic/bicarbonate/carbonate rations are given. In the typical case where
one is attempting to sythesize, say, Munich water, the pH is usually not
given and a number for "carbonate" or "bicarbonate" is given without it
being clear exactly what that is. While it is reasonable to assume that it
refers to bicarbonate we usually don't know whether the value is in ppm as
CaCO3 or ppm as HCO3- or ppm as CaO.


To do the synthesis one makes an assumption about what "carbonate" means
then "experiments" (in a computer) with varying salt additions trying to
minimize some function (I use the log of the ratio) of the ion
concentrations brought about by the trial salt additions and the desired
ion concentrations. The unknown pH can be dealt with in several ways. It
can be a "don't care" parameter, i.e. allowed to go to any value to which
it must in order to mimimize the ion concentration error. The analyst
(actuallu synthesist) can then decide whether the resultant pH is
reasonable. The pH can also be constrained to remain within certain limits
or it can be fixed at a chosen value and the ion concentrations optimized
based on this constraint. This is the approach to take when the pH is
known. Another big problem in trying to synthesize the published profiles
is that some of them have become distorted with passage about the
literature and among members of the community. A quick check of many of the
popularly accepted profiles shows that they are not nearly electrically
neutral and thus must be in error. As our syntheses must be neutral there
may be large errors in idividual ion concentrations.

Subject: Bitterness


In #2000 Francis Ferguson complains about not being able to get sharp
bitterness in bitter. The secret is a combination of hop variety, hoping
amounts and schedule  and sulfate ion. Bitters are not that highly hopped
(to my way of thinking) in the range of high 20's to mid 30's. Sulfate ion
concentration should be around 300 ppm ( 1 gram of gypsum in 1 gal of water
will give about 147 ppm, 1 gram of epsom salts in 1 gal 103). To hit a
controlled level you should know the starting sulfate content of the water
but as you are not getting the bitterness bite we can assume that your
water is low in sulfate and you can probably just forge ahead blind. With
some beers having sulfate contents over 500 ppm you don't need to worry
about overshooting a bit.


The hops variety chosen will change the quality of the bitterness with the
high alpha varieties generally having a "coarse" quality. I would think in
terms of Fuggles and Kent Goldings for ales but note that Terry Foster (who
knows a hell of a lot more about ales than I do) recommends Bullion,
Cluster and Northern Brewer for bittering and Cascades, as well as
Goldings, for aroma in his recipes.

Subject: O2 Regulator


Harry Houck asked about oxygen regulators in #2001. Oxygen has a density of
32 grams per mole and CO2 44 so oxygen is about 3/4 as dense as CO2. The
orifice in a medical rig is for metering. If you look closely at the flow
rate gauge you will probably see that it is labeled "Litres flow per miunte
through #77 drill aperture" or something similar. In other words, the gauge
measures the pressure on the upstream side of the orifice and the downsream
side is presumably at the ambient so the pressure is proportional to the
flow and the dial is calibrated in litres/min. The regulator should be
capable of controlling to pressures much lower than 40 psig. I can't help
feeling that the fact that it doesn't is somehow related to its being sold
for a buck.

Subject: Seltzer aftertaste


Greetings all,


     I was visiting a local brewpub last night, hoping that they 
figured out how to brew beer, and I tried their Blueberry Blonde ale 
and Golden Ale, each one of these brews had a harsh seltzer water kind 
of aftertaste.  The off-flavor was more pronounced in the Golden, 
which is the lighter body ale, than it was in the Blueberry Blonde.  
They actually put a teaspoon of blueberries in the glass.  The 
blueberries didn't impart much flavor, however, the carbonation kept 
the blueberries floating up and down and I did find that rather 
amusing.


     My question is: What could be the cause of this flavor?  I think 
they figured out what was causing the overpowering, nasty, 
undrinkable, malty flavor in some of their previous beers, (It's 
pretty bad when there's a brewpub right next door and you can't stand 
the beer) :^( I'd like to know what could be causing this problem.  
Thanks.


(P.S. They did have a Pale Ale that was pretty good, maybe there's 
still hope!)

I think that the fluccuating temperature is the most likely cause. If your
house is warm during the day and cold at night, the yeast will be thermally
stressed and drop out. 


The other likely problem is a lack of yeast nutrients, though you said you

     What a shame.  My company had a regional meeting in Key West about a year 
     and a half ago and we spent the better part of a week down there.  Several 
     of us went to Kelly's at least once a day and had no problems being served 
     great food and good beer (my favorite was the Havana Red Ale).  In fact, 
     one night there were a dozen or so of us who wandered in after spending 
     some time on Duval Street and they put us upstairs where no one else was.  
     There was a bar up there that they opened just for us.  Kelly (McGillis) 
     herself even came up and spent some time talking at the table with us.  It 
     was a warm, clear night with a tropical breeze blowing, great beer 
     (especially considering that the most exotic beer readily available on the 
     island is Red Stripe), and Jimmy Buffett on the sound system.  I was in 
     heaven!  There must've been some sort of "MVP" in the house when you were 
     there.  I talked beer with Kelly so much (and drank so much of the Havana 
     Red) that she gave me a Havana Red Ale T-shirt before I left.  
     Unfortunately, I "donated" it to someone, somewhere on one of my many 
     business trips.  I would definitely go back again.  If we could have just 
     caught a Buffett show in Margaritaville, the trip would have been complete.

Subject: Yeast Generations and Attenuation


In an attempt to understand why (I thought) my final gravities 
recently have been higher than expected I went back over 18 batches
trying to find some correlation.  I looked at ingredients (i.e. yeast 
and fermentables), additives (i.e. Irish Moss, ...), fermentation 
temperature... everything that I recorded.*  I compared the FG with 
what I calculated the FG should be based on a spreadsheet of mine
which list ingredients, their contribution to the gravity, and their
fermentability.**


None of the factors seemed significant except the generation of yeast
that was being used.  (I reclaim yeast from the secondary as described
in the yeast FAQ and store it in the fridge for 3-5 weeks between 
batches).  In the 12 batches using 1st generation yeast my FGs were 
an average of 1.3 points higher than expected (0.8 points if I remove 
a rogue strawberry beer).  On the other hand the 6 2nd/3rd generation 
yeast batches averaged 6.5 points above what I expected.  


For both 1st generation and 2nd/3rd generation yeasts I make a 2 
stage starter in the same way, and there seems to be no difference 
in lag times.  The yeasts I use are mostly Yeast Lab A05, A09 & A04 - 
in any case Ale yeasts.


At first I was surprised because I would have thought that yeast
scavenged from the secondary is yeast that 'hangs around' longer 
and therefore would tend to ferment the beer more, not less.  On the 
other hand these are top cropping Ale yeasts that I am recovering 
from the bottom of the secondary...


So does this 5 point difference surprise anyone else besides me?


Doug


* I didn't record how well I had aerated each batch and I suspect 
that this would be significant.


** I don't know how accurate my calculations are but I guess that I 
can argue that any error would be systematic.

Rule of thumb as I've picked up is about 1 gal / hour of evaporation at 
 a decent boil.  If you are going from 6 to 3.5 gal in 90 min, it 
 sounds like your "rolling boil" is really rolling!  Even with the rule 
 of thumb, you would be at about 4.5 gal.  How dry/humid is your area?  
 I assume low humidity would increase the evap rate.  What's your 
 elevation?  Also - maybe you can adjust your cooker down somewhat to 
 keep a boil that isn't rolling so quickly!  


If your pot is big enough, start with 7 or 8 gal . . .

 for getting any more specifically for homebrewing.  Then if you don't 
 care for the process, you can ditch it not having invested too much 
 and at least had some decent beer along the way.


I reused several - the only problem that I had was over priming the 
 first batch to go in one!  I used a rate of about 1/2 cup corn sugar 
 and all was well until the sucker punched a corner in the top of the 
 keg.  (It was amazing to see a 90 degree angle jut out from an 
 otherwise circular ring!)  One leaked, others were deformed and 
 recycled.  The beer in those kegs always seemed to taste better than 
 the bottles for some reason - that's why I moved to corny kegs in a

I think #1968 has an attenuation of 67%-71%, this would mean that a brew
that starts at 1.055 would end at 1.016-1.018, assuming that all of the
gravity points are due to fermentables (and this is seldom the case).
Depending on your grain bill I would expect your F.G. to be 1.018-1.020.


Attenuation % indicates the degree of fermentation the yeast strain
is capable of, this does not directly translate into how quickly it will
ferment.  The time required for fermentation is related to pitching rate,
temperature, oxygenation, the strain's degree of flocculation, and how
you held your toungue while boiling the wort.

Subject: Water Questions


Ok guys, I have been reading and trying to follow the posts on water
adjustment for brewing to simulate other regions in the world.  One thing
that pops out at me is that after getting my local water test, (done in 1992
not very current), I then preboil the water to mainly remove the clorine and
kill any other nasties in the water that might remain.  I then will add
whatever chemicals to change the water to the "right" specs.  Depending on
the hardness, etc. would not I lose some of the minerals that were in the
water originally, and how would I then correlate this water to my original
water?  Should I spend the dough on a separate water test?  If so should I
then test post boiled water too?  Or should I give up and keep brewing as I
have been (and getting relatively good beer IMHO)?  Or should I just brew
with distilled water and add correct doses to adjust the water?   TIA,
