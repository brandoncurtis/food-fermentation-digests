Subject: lagering temperature stratification


        Greetings.  The chest freezer I lager in went kaput and I'm 
trying to chill by freezing plastic milk containers of water in an 
upright and then placing them in the broken chest freezer.  The 
temperature at the top of the fermenters is 49 degrees F and at the 
bottom the temp is 38 d F.  


        As the yeast is more at the bottom, is that the effective lagering
 temperature?  Has anybody lagered under similar circumstances of 
stratified temperatures and how did it work out?   Thanks and Cheers Jim 
Booth, Lansing, MI

Subject: Brown Oxide Ale


OK, I'm stupid at times, I'll admit it, but jeesh.....


I had brewed Papazian's Elbro Nerkte, followed directions to the
letter this time, and was feeling really good about the beer.  It
looked and smelled fantastic as I was bottling yesterday, maybe a
little too sweet, I have to improve my hop utilization.


Anyway,...after bottling about 24 bottles I slapped my forehead
and said, "Oh, shucks!" (or something to that effect).  I forgot
to add priming sugar (how do you spell 'DOH!').  Being a creature
of habit, I imediatley threw my 3/4 c. corn sugar into 2 cups of
water and set it on to boil as I uncapped 24 bottles of beer. 
Now at this point it dawned on me that, had I kept the sugar as
powder, I could have just added some to each of the bottles, and
then boiled the rest to add to the bottling bucket.  Sigh.  So I
did the next illogical thing and emptied the 24 bottles of beer
back into the bottling bucket, assuring that all 5 gallons would
be equally oxidized.  I added the cooled sugar solution, stirred,
and re-bottled.


So anyway, I now have 5 gallons of oxidized brown ale.  What's it
gonna taste like?  Should I plan on drinking this one quickly, 
letting it age longer to mellow out, or just quitting and giving
it away?


Am I going to have to turn in my learner's permit?

Subject: Malt Mills


Fellow HBDers,
 
I am looking to purchase a malt mill. My local homebrew supply shop
has two that are within my price range: a PhilMill (125$ Cnd) and a 
three-roller Italian mill (95$ Cnd). I've previously used the PhilMill
and like its results, but I've never heard of this three-roller
Italian mill... So, before dishing out an additional 30$ for a PhilMill,
I thought I'd give the collective a chance to comment on the three-roller
Italian mill first... Has anyone used this mill before and is it any good
and worth the money? I love to get some feedback...


Thanks in advance.

The pitching rate normally _won't_ affect the FG; just the rate at
which you get there. A larger, healthier population will ferment the
sugars faster, that's all. The "banquet" is the same size - just a
whole lot more dining on it.

Don't know why a "professional" brewer would think that rousing the 
yeast would be crazy. Common practice, particularly with highly 
flocculent strains. Don't be fooled into thinking that the bubbling 
you get immediately after swirling the fermenter is an increase in 
the rate of fermentation, though. Not only will swirling the 
fermenter get the yeast back ingot suspension, but it will also knock 
a lot of the CO2 out of solution, causing increased bubbling of the 
airlock...

Without that hydrometer reading, it's hard to tell whether rousing 
had any affect at all. I've had increase fermentation by rousing 1968 
in some recipes, none in others. 1968 is a sluggish fermenter at 
best. As indicated it floccs out pretty quickly once the turbulence 
of the kraeusen is past.

72 * 5 / 10 = 36 pg/p - A phenomenal extraction rate! Most brewers
strain to achieve 30, let alone 36. You sure about these numbers?!?
If so, you're a little confused. That OG isn't low for the grain bill
 - it's huge! (Yes, in comparison to the extract recipe, the OG is
lower; however, you really can't ask for much more out of ten pounds
of barley!) Whatever you did, keep doing it. You've achieved as near
a lab-mash as any I've seen...


To up the gravity in future batches, up the grain bill. The 1.010 
rule-of-thumb is more to protect your brew from defects resulting 
from rinsing nasty stuff from the grain than it is to ensure you get 
all the sugars.


See ya!

Hi Mark...read your question about culturing yeasts from Triples/Saisons =
with interest.  I don't know about the Rochefort yeast, but I recently =
cultured the yeast from a bottle of Dupont "Avec les Bons Voeux" (a =
Christmas beer from Dupont, but very much in the saison style), and to my =
surprise it started growing very quickly.  I was able to plate some out =
and examine the culture under a microscope;  colony morphology appeared =
uniform on the plates and I couldn't see anything but yeast under the =
scope, so I decided to try it in a batch.  It's two weeks in the bottle =
now and I haven't tried any yet, but I can say that it produced a very =
vigorous fermentation.  I did note some banana esters when I bottled it, =
but I don't know if those will stick around or not.  Hope this helps and =
good luck,

The "hot break" is denatured medium to high molecular weight proteins in
complex  with other things. This means that the hydrogen and disulphide
bonds that hold these polypeptides in their pleated, helical  and globular
shapes have been broken, leaving sites exposed for intermolecular bonds to
form "flocs" (gooey lumps), usually with polyphenolics and tannins and
starch and lipids and iso-alpha acids etc. The solubility of these proteins
is also changed because their electrical polarity is changed by this
denaturing. The net polarity of various proteins gives them a pH of minimum
solubility called their "isoelectric point", but the structure also
influences solubility and colloidal dispersability.


Cooling may change the pH slightly and affect the strength of floc bonding?
I do know it cannot "renature" proteins, i.e. rebuild the broken structures,
they are simply too complex to reform. The only way to redissolve hot break
is to boil the hell out of it for hours on end until the denatured
polypeptides (a little like a ball of spaghetti) break down into simple
polypeptides, ( a few peptides joined in linear structure, like short 1"
bits of spaghetti) these are highly soluble.


Cold break is simpler hot break,( i.e. the polypeptides and polyphenolics
are less complex, hence more soluble) with a much higher and variable lipid
content. Anyone who has watched a fatty scum form on a cooling bowl of soup
will realise that fatty things are less soluble at colder temperatures,
hence Matthew's cloudy jars the following morning. They also tend to rise,
hence the success of seperating cold break by flotation during aeration, and
hence its slower settling period.


Cold break contains nothing that can redissolve hot break, you *can* cool in
the kettle safely with immersion chillers.


The Protein FAQ I'm working on is almost finished and will take up a whole
HBD soon.

Subject: my water treatment error


Could someone help me out here?  (I need it!)


After a long while brewing with my water as is, I began treating my water
with gypsum (CaSO4) by adding it directly to the mash. 


I'm wondering how many other people may be doing the same thing that I was
- -- adding all of their salts to the mash, and calculating the amount of
salts according to the total amount of beer  being made rather than
according to the amount of mash water.  Since the volume of mash water is
less than the amount of beer, I end up with higher concentrations than
intended, no?  I should use more salts for a thin mash than for a thick one
to arrive at the same ppms?    I was (am) confused by not really thinking
about what I was doing, and by articles that talk about how much salt you
have to add for a five gallon batch.


My other question was about a shortcut I've been taking, adding the gypsum
with the grist when I am mashing in.  How would this be different from
treating all the mash water first?  Generally it would mean that I'm mashing
with untreated water for the first few minutes, but what would be the
specific effects?  I'm doing a temperature program mash starting at around
60'C in a thin mash, but protecting B-amylase at the very beginning
shouldn't be a problem, should it?  For things that happen in the boil
(sulphates and hops) it shouldn't matter?


I'm starting with quite soft water, pH 7.0, total alkalinity 23, bicarbonate
23, carbonate 0 mg/L all given as CaCO3; calcium 0.6 mg/L and sulphate 8
mg/L.  I've been adding 30 g gypsum to make 55 litres of beer.


Thanks in advance,

In reference to my question about what beers are to be had in Egypt, I went

There is Stella and Stella Export, the export is harder to find.  All in all,
for the only beer available it is better than the standard American Lager on
the market here.  It is served in what appears to be about 20 oz bottle, just
a bit smaller than a bomber bottle.  It sold from around $2.50 to $3.00 in the

Subject: Historical Trivia




I recently looked through a combination recipe/advice/advertisements book 
given to my grandmother after she got married in Tacoma back in 1928.  There 
were no less than three ads for local hopped malt extract, and this in what 
was not a particularly large city.  One of these, by Berg & Son,  touted 
their "Hop Flavored Malt Syrup" for "Hop Scotch Candy".  My question is 
this: has there ever been any common use for malt extract other than 
brewing?


I suspect each can came with:  Warning! - Do not add yeast and let ferment 
or an illegal alcoholic beverage might result! :-)

I'm looking for something large enough to do some decent sized starters.
In particular, I tend to use 1, 1.5 and 3 liter Luminarc (rubber gasket flip

a 22 qt canner.


I saw an online source, once, for a 30qt pressure canner, but I didn't save it

As obnoxious and inconvenient as it is, they are a private company
and can pretty much do whatever they want to.  Obviously, we can go
somewhere else.  I think that shipipng homebrew should be perfectly
legal and acceptable to everyone.  Chances are they wouldn't bug you 
anyway, and after they open the package, you can still lie to them and
say it's homemade root beer.  I think they have a right to protect 
themselves from bombs and similar weird shit people might ship.

That's what I do anyway since one of those places is a block from my house

They're a private business.  Taking your stuff and putting it on their 
trucks.  I think they have a right to check what's in it first.


If they were a monopoly, or in any way involved in the government, the
"police state" language would be called for.  As it is, it's just crying
wolf.  When the real police state comes, people will be so fed up with 
overstated accusations that they won't take the warnings seriously.

They have been scientifically proven to work, in limited circumstances, via 
an as-yet-unknown mechanism.  It's been in the last month or two that they
were shown to work.  So, don't say "NEVER" unless you've read every study
done on them.


I'm not trying to say these things live up to the claims they make in their
advertisements.  I'm not advising anyone to buy one without independently 
confirming they work, and maybe not even then.  I'm just saying, there IS
evidence they work, and I think people who claim to know things they don't 
need a little thump now and then.  <thump>  There ya go.


Finally, these things are useless for brewing even if they work exactly as
advertised.  So, don't buy one for your beer.

Subject: Wyeast Ale Test 


     I am, with the help of several club members from the Long 
     Beach Homebrewers, doing a test of the basic Wyeast ale 
     strains.  All packets were obtained at the same time with 
     the same date.  They were only a few weeks old at time of 
     popping the pouch. We are using all the same wort, half of 
     which was provided from our local brew-pub and half from 
     extract.  We did 2 gal batches in 2.8 gal carboys so that 
     we would have sufficient results from each batch to go 
     around at the club.  
     
     While the purpose of the test is to taste the different 
     strains that are fermented with the same wort and under the 
     same conditions, we noticed a dramatically different rate 
     of growth among the different strains.  I devised a way of 
     measuring the packets by laying a stick across the middle 
     of the packet with one end of the stick taped down.  The 
     height of the other end became my measure of the packet.  
     With a scale of 1-10, 10 being a fully inflated packet, 
     here is the results of those measurements.
     
     Temp. Range 68-70F
     WYEAST  TYPE      12 Hrs   24Hrs   38 Hrs 
     1007  German       1.6     3.2     7.4 
     1028  London       5       10      10 
     1056  American     5.2     10      10 
     1084  Irish        4       8.6     10 
     1098  British      6.6     10      10 
     1338  European     2.4     4       7.4 
     1728  Scottish     5       10      10 
     1968  London ESB   1.4     3       5.8
     
     They are still in the carboys and the ultimate test is in 
     sampling the results, but it looks like the race being won 
     by British 1098 which is appearing nearly finished after 
     only 2 days.  
     
     Will update as results become available.

Subject: Using a 2ndary/irish moss/ups




1.USING A 2NDARY:  What are the collective's thoughts on using a secondary
before bottling/kegging?  I've done both -- bottled after fermenting only
in a primary and after transferring to a secondary -- and I can see only
one benefit and several costs to transferring to a 2ndary: 


benefit:  after bottling, there is less yeast sediment in the bottles, 
making it easier to pour.  (But I've never noticed any significant 
degradation due to the greater amount of yeast in my bottled beer taken 
directly from the primary, even after 8 months in the bottle.)


costs:  Using a 2ndary adds hassle and introduces some oxygen, no matter 
how careful I am. 


Thus, using only a primary (glass) has only 1 cost (less yeast in bottle)
and great benefits in less oxygen introduced.  Also, I've never had any
off-tastes from leaving the fermented beer on the yeast (and I've left it
on up to 4 weeks after the start of fermentation) (as others noted here,
there seems to be no problem with this). 


QUESTION: are there any real benefits to using a 2ndary?


2: IRISH MOSS: does using Irish Moss affect hop utilization, especially
the level of hop character in the finished beer? 


3. UPS & THE CONSTITUTION:  Pat Babcock speculates that the Constitution
will somehow prohibit UPS from inspecting our packages (if indeed they
do).  He's wrong.  The Constitution limits only what government or
government officials may do.  UPS is a private organization and, like any
other business corporation, can do whatever they want to your
constitutional rights (except for practicing discrimination, which is
prohibited by the Civil Rights Act, a congressional statute).

Subject: Old yeast into boil?


I was browsing the book rack at the local HB retailer the other day and
came across someting I'd never heard before in a book called "50 tips for
homebrewers" or some such title.


Anyway, this book recommended that kit brewerss take the generic yeast that
came with the kit and toss it into the boiling wort, claiming that this
added nutritive value to the wort.  The book did go onto say to use a
decent dry or liquid yeast for fermenting.


Does anyone know if the claim is true? Or is it an old brewer's tale?  I
teach beginning and intermediate HB classes and tell people to use the kit
yeast to make bread, but every so often, someone who's seen this tip asks
about its veracity.


Thanks.  private e-mail is fine...

I called UPS and asked them if they open packages.  They just laughed and
said we would never have time to open packages and reseal them.  The post may
have been  an
April Fool's joke or maybe some local aberration.


On another subject, what are the current hop profiles for Liberty Ale and
Anchor Steam
and if they are dry hopped, what type is used? Also, what are their optimal
fermintation temps?

Hi All,


I have been reading HBD for a couple of months now. I really enjoy the 
wit and knowledge of so many of you. This is a very simple question, but 
I don't know where else to turn. I went to the archive folder for HBD 
1995 and downloaded several files. I would like to know what utility I 
need to decompress these files. The extension of the compressed files is 
z  as (1620.z) I would love to read them, so any help would be 
appreciated.

Hey, I'm not a lawyer either, but I believe that the crucial factor in 
this case is that the Constitution ONLY applies to the Government.  
Because UPS is a private shipper, the relationship between you the 
customer and them the shipper is purely contractual.  If you don't want 
your package opened, don't ship UPS.  It's not a "police state tactic" 
because it's not the state.  The Constitution doesn't apply.

Subject: Dilute Bleach Solution


I have been mixing up a dilute solution of bleach, and storing it for 
several months to sanitize fermenters and associated equipment that comes 
in contact with wort.  Papazian recommends this in one of his books.  I 
prefer bleach over iodophor due to cost.  I've stored this dilute solution 
for several months and still get a strong chlorine odor from anything 
extracted from the solution.


I've noticed that if the bleach is used in low concentrations a gray sandy 
precipitate develops in the bottom of the solution after a couple of weeks. 
If stirred it won't dissolve again, but will cause the solution to become 
cloudy and will quickly precipitate again.  Higher concentrations do not 
have any indications of precipitates.


The bleach is a cheap off-brand, but it does say that the active ingredient 
is 5% sodium hypochlorite, the same as Chlorox.  Any ideas from the 
chemists in the group as to the nature of the precipitate, and the 
sanitizing effectiveness of long-stored dilute bleach solution?  I've never 
had an infection problem that I know of.

Mike Bell

Yeah. One: I do a very similar thingy when canning starters - the
exception being that I measure the extract directly to the jar, top
up, and pressure can. I have the jungle of break material at the
bottom of the jar; however, all my starters are crystal clear - from
the time the product is hot to to now, six months later. 


Go figure.
