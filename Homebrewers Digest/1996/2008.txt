Subject: Water Analysis


There are a number of companies that offer complete water analysis.  
I have used one extremely successfully and they offer an option to 
test for pesticides as well.  It is important to note that there is a 
difference between compliance testing for legal requirements and the 
testing that I would order.  In some cases the government specifies 
the testing required and the method to be used.  This is often much more 
laborious than modern methods--and no more accurate.  Thus the high 
cost of compliance testing.


For more information on testing or treatment contact the Water 
Quality Association.   


Thanks.

Hi beerboys (oops! and beergirls)


I am going to brew  my 4th all grain batch soon. I got some barley 
flakes from the guy who supply me with grain. I am not sure what 
quantities I should use. I also have some wheat malt, chocolate malt
crystal malt and Cara-Vienna malt. 
I only do infusion mash. All my malts are fully modified, I think !
What quantities of the flakes should I use ? What effect will it have 
on my beer ? How will it influence the taste, body, colour and head ?
Can I use it with infusion mash ?
I brew 5 gallon batches. 
Thanks !

Greetings and welcome to my stomping grounds!  I was born and raised in
Wmsbg and am currently residing in DC.  Your best bet is to get your hands
on an issue of Barley Corn, a free monthly (I think) newspaper about beer,
brewing, and microbreweries and crafthouses of the east.  It will provide
the most complete listing of the many establishments and events in this
area.  If you can't get it wherever you are, send a private e-mail with an
address to which I can send an issue.  I'll be happy to.


If the weather turns warm on your trip, drop by the King's Arm's Tavern
in the historic area for a frosty pitcher of Lieberscheiner Ale out in the
garden under the trellises for a truly pleasant afternoon.  You must not
overlook Legend Brewing Co. in Richmond, Va. on your way from DC, about 50
miles before you get to Wmsbg.  The owner and head brewer, Tom Martin, is
a childhood friend of mine and makes beer so good it'll spoil you!  Brewing
runs in his family and he has finally realized his 15-20 yr. dream to be a
brewer too.  Tell him I sent ya!

Subject: Canning Wort




I can 1 cup, 1 pint and 1 qt. jars of sterile wort for using as starter. I
have been doing this for years with excellent results. Everything I know
about it I learned from "Yeast Culturing for the Homebrewer," by Roger
Leistad - G.W. Kent Inc., 1983. This little handbook is available at most
homebrew shops for about $4.00.


I also use the information in the book to make agar medium for capturing
commercial yeast strains for subsequent use. Leistad's text is, IMO, a
brewing classic worth many time its cover price.


Cheers, Fred

Greetings Collective,                                                           


I posted recently about my first partial mash, a                                
Brown Ale from Miller's TCHOHB.  I just wanted to                               
comment, that even with the errors I'd made during                              
the mash, and sparge, that this is my best beer yet.                            
It has been bottled only one week, but is very                                  
good, if a little flat....                                                      


On to new things!                                                               
In preperation for doing an All-Grain in the near                               
future, I requested a water analisis from my                                    
Utility District, (MUD-7 in Katy, TX) which they                                
readily supplied at no cost.  However, all ION counts                           
are in MG/L rather than the PPM that Miller describes                           
in his book.  How do I convert between the two?

Subject: Sodium Hydrox for bottles


nir asked about the level of caustic in bottle washing operations:


the big breweries that rewash use alot about 3%.  this is at a relative
low temperature about 160F or so.  the higher the temp the less caustic you 
can use but the glass can be thermally shocked (watch the next bottling if
bottle conditioning). 


we rewash the 1/2 gallon growlers at 175 to 180 with about a 1-2%
caustic for 5 minutes.  good impingment on the interior surface and
the neck are required (A/B quotes a 7ft/sec as good cleaning impingment).
so to get this - a higher speed pump with a large inlet and smaller outlet
(2" in 1" or so outlet 3450 rpm and a few horses should do it).  we built a 
jig outs copper (dont tell the fda;) to clean 24 at a shot and use a 3hp
3450 pump.  the nozzels need work but washes very well and quickly. 


not a lot of fun tho.....nir - hows the brewery doing?

Subject: sparge worthy spigot/water analysis




Hello Brew Collective!


I have two hopefully simple problems I need some help with:


1.  I use my bottling bucket to hold my sparge water. You know the type 
white hdpe bucket with standard plastic spigot.  The problem I have is that 
is leaks like a sieve when I put hot sparge water in it.  I've gone through 
5 of these in the last year and a half.  The cost is not an issue (they are 
only about 3 bucks) but trying to sparge and clean up 170 degree water off 
the kitchen floor is not fun.  Any recommendations as to a solution for 
this.  I would like to maintain the same arrangement.


2. Had a request for any brewers in the Fairfax VA area:  How is the water 
in this area and does it require treatment.  I hope to avoid a nut roll with 
the local water authority (much like the recent experiences on the HBD). 
 Also any recommended homebrew stores in the area would be a help


Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I've got waaaay too much time to think of these. (Generally between 12-5

The best (worst?) pun will go in the fermenter and on the label (with

BTW, as another data point, my Dopplebock did not carbonate after bottling. 
 Probably the yeast flocculated due to rapid temperature changes.  Had to 
add yeast to the bottles & recap.

Does anyone know of a source for a digital scale suitable for weighing 
fractions of ounces (grams) for hops and salts etc but also able to weigh 
up to 10 lbs of grain for mashing ? A scale with a range of 1g - 5000g 
(or 0.1 oz to 10 lbs) would be ideal.

Subject: Distinctive Foods / Dead Skunk In the Middle of My Beer / Is My Beer Ruined?


I really enjoyed Kristine's sharing of the verbage on the label of old malt
extract she has.  "Distinctive Foods"!  HAH!  Perhaps this is a kindler and
gentler way of writing a disclaimer than the usual "don't blame me if you get
in trouble using this" line.


*********************


Chris DiIorio (how do you pronounce that, Chris?) asks about "skunky" beers.
 I suupose there could be any number of things going on but the #1 culprit is
usually light.  Light-struck hops become "skunky" and this is why beer is
best packaged in dark bottles.  The hops can be light-struck either before OR
after brewing (or both, I suppose), so be sure your hops are stored out of
the light (wrap in aluminum foil for light-tightness) and so is your bottled
beer.  Direct sunlight will skunk hops in short order; flourescent lights
supposedly can too but it takes longer.  If you are already taking these
steps, complain to the store that sold you the skunky hops.

If you can do this for $300 we'd like to learn how!  I've got my wife trained
to appreciate homebrew and fine imports so as long as I keep the incremental
costs down I can get away with "making beer cheaper".


As far as your Hop IBU and recipe formulation goes, try this.  An "IBU" is
supposed to be equivalent to 1 mg/l alpha acid.  So you must figure how many
mg of AA is getting into how many litres of beer.  Each ounce of hops weighs
28.4 grams (28,400 mg), and each gallon of beer is 3.8 litres.  The
"utilization" is simply the percent of the AA that actually gets into your
beer and depends on so many things it's usually a crapshoot, but figure 25%
to 30% max for long boils (there are tables and formulae out there to get
utilzation figures for shorter boil times).  The number of mg AA in hops is
28,400 x ounces x AA%/100.  The number of litres is 3.8 * gallons.  The mg/l
that ends up in your beer is the mg/l times the utilization or mg/l x
UTIL%/100.  


So IBU = mg/l = ((28,400 x oz x AA%/100) / (3.8 x gal) ) x UTIL%/100.  This
reduces to:


** IBU = 0.75 x OZ x AA% x UTIL% / GALLONS **


One ounce of 5% AA hops in 5 gallons at a utilization of 30% gives


IBU = 0.75 x 1 x 5 x 30 / 5 = 22.5 IBU


To figure how much grain you need for a given OG, note that a quantity of
grain yields a certain number of "potential extract points per pound per
gallon" or just "points".  This varies for different grains but is around 36
for typical base malt.  Specialty grains contribute at lower rates but are
often not included at all due to the low percentage they usually represent,
but you can toss'em in if you like.  So you must first figure how much of
this 36 points you're actually gonna get; this is your "efficiency".  To
complicate things, your "efficiency" might be different for the different
grains, but if you figure based on the base malt (assuming it's the bulk of
the grain bill), you'll be real close.


So if you are getting an 80% efficiency, the base malt at 36 points would
yield 36 x 80%/100 = 28.8 points per gallon per pound.  To figure the gravity
from a given number of pounds in a given number of gallons, take this figure,
multiply by the number of pounds, and divide by the gallons:


OG (POINTS) = POINTS x EFF%/100 x POUNDS / GAL
OG (Spec. Grav) = 1 + POINTS/1000


Example:  10 pounds of 36-point grain in 5 gallons at 80%:
OG (POINTS) = 36 x 80/100 x 10 / 5 = 57.6 points
OG (SG) = 1 + 57.6/1000 = 1.058


If you have figures for the potential points and efficiencies for each grain
in the bill, do this calculation separately and add the resulting points,
then lastly convert to SG.  This is the ultimate in A-R brewing.


Rearranging the equation we can figure the amount of grain needed for a
specific OG:


POUNDS = (OG(POINTS) x GALLONS) / (POINTS x EFF%/100)


If we want a 1.075 OG (75 points) in 5 gallons with 36-point grain and 80%
efficiency,


POUNDS = (75 x 5) / (36 x 80/100) = 13 pounds


This is the 5-gallon FINAL RECIPE gravity; your 6-1/2 gallon BOIL gravity
will be lower since it gets more concentrated as it boils off the water.  The
BOIL gravity is


BG(POINTS) = (RECIPE GAL / BOIL GAL) x RECIPE OG(POINTS)
BG(SG) = 1 + BG(points)/1000


For the 1.075 OG wort, we'll look for 5/6.5 x 75 = 58 points (1.058 SG) in
the boiler just after sparging 6-1/2 gal wort.  Remember that most
hydrometers are calibrated at 60 degrees F so chill the sparge sample before
reading, or consult a correction table.

Subject: The Abita Brewery




Greetings members of the collective,


     Last weekend a friend and I took a trip
to New Orleans to catch the scene around Easter.
On Saturday, we went to Abita Springs to catch the
Abita Brewery tour.  I can easily get Abita here in
Texas and was about all I drank while working in
Alabama, so I expected a large professional
operation.  The place was less organized than I
expected.  Sacks of malted barley were stacked
floor to ceiling along with boxes of bottles, filter
substrate, six pack containers, labels, and other
brewing paraphernalia.


     Brian, our tour guide and one of the
brewers, lead the tour with a plastic cup of
TurboDog in one hand.  He gave a competent
overview of brewing for the laypeople and fielded
more complex questions from the home brewing
crowd.  Free samples flowed from the tasting
room/employee lounge/latrine.  All were
encouraged to refill at any time during the tour
with any of the brewery's fare (and rootbeer
for the tykes). A lot of the brewery's equipment
was recycled dairy equipment.  Their pride and
joy was an automatic labeler with eliminated a
bottleneck in the line.  At the end we were
encouraged to wander around the brewery at
will if we promised not to "turn anything on."


     The beer was all excellent, however
I was a little disappointed in the TurboDog, it
seemed to have a lot more hop aroma when
I drank it in Anniston Alabama.  My female
friend liked it very much (certainly gets points
for having a really cool name).  I was impressed
with their "Red Ale" although I thought it could
be a tad more bitter.  I also enjoyed their
barley wine at their restaurant in town.  I think
it is called Andigator or something to that
effect.  Some obscure law prohibits them from
bottling it so you have to get it on tap.  Also
ate a "poor boy" there, I can see why the poor
eat them, I tasted it all day.


     Overall impression was that of a
quaint, relaxed small town brewery. A lot of
fun.


     Another beer I encountered in
New Orleans was Dixie beer.  Looked like
a megaswill bottle but with good beer inside.
Also liked something called hand grenade
beer (available at the Funky Pirate bar).
Tasted a little like a bock I brewed once.


     BTW I'm not associated in any way
with the Abita brewing.......Blah..........Blah.......
 ..Blah........not now nor have ever been a member
of the communist party.

    Anyone care to take a guess?  AJ?


  The solution is a 10% Calcium Gluconate solution, delivering about .5 mEq

Subject: which yeast/ferment temp.


I am planning on brewing a continental pilzner, so I bought a kit
(I think the name of the kit was something like Mutons gold?).
Anyway, the kit came with a packet of dried yeast. I want to know if
I would obtain a better product if I used liquid yeast? From what I
read on the newsgroup, most people do, in fact, prefer Wyeast
over the dried.  So, for all of the people that have brewed cnt. pilz's
before, what strain of yeast did you use, and how did everthing turn out
I also bought 1 oz of Saaz pellets and 1 oz of Saaz plugs to use as
flavoring and aroma hops. I plan on using the pellets at 15 min. and the
plugs at 5 min., does this sound reasonable (I've never used finishing
hops before)?  I am trying to obtain a result similar to that of
a typical American Pilzner, somewhat like that of Michelob. Any further
suggestions on how this can be done?
Also, I am curious about the best fermenting temp. for this type of
brew.  What are the best temps, and what are the highest temps that
I could get away with?
Thanks in advance,

Hey Neighbors,


Would someone out there please help?  I would like to
reduce the O.G. from .60 to about .45.  I would like to do this
at priming time.  I have about 2.75 gal. of beer in the 'boy
now fermenting.  I'm thinking of adding a half gal. of
sugar/water at bottling but this is only a guess.  Can
someone send more accurate calculations?


With my all grain training wheels still on I am confused why I
ended up with such a high O.G.  With my last batch I hit the
mark of .38 so this time I increase the grain bill with one
additional pound of grain.  I did over boil a bit and missed my
3 gal. mark, guess I got carried away with my new propane
cooker.  I ran my grain bill through the Brewmeister and it
projected an O.G. of .43.  I did substituted a half pound of 60
degree crystal for Vienna on this batch over the last one.


One last thing, I also incorporated a homemade Phil's sparge
arm thing on this batch but I hardly think this increased my
extraction so much.  What gives, how did I get this high
O.G.?

In HBD #2007 Nir Navot asks:-

The standard concentration in the biotech industry is 0.1 molar
or 4 grams per liter (half an ounce per gallon is close enough).
A less concentrate solution (say 0.01 molar) could be used for storage.


Just to cover my rear (JTCMA), I note that NaOH is a toxic, hazardous
chemical, which is of course why it's commonly known as caustic soda.
I suggest we all read the MSDS at http://www.fisher1.com/ ,
(in full, <http://www.fisher1.com/fb/itv?2..fsc95.1.msf0006.78.2x48...>)
and then rinse the bottles well (to neutral pH) before use.


Nb. Some plastics and other materials are not chemically resistant to NaOH.


IMHO, I think bleach or iodophor is a much friendlier choice for home use..

The brewer at Barley's should listen to you more -- you have it absolutely
right.  At The Old Brewery Tadcaster (where they make Samuel Smith's) their
yeast is so flocculent they have to use pumps to keep it in suspension.


The Wyeast pamphlet is wrong about the aeration.  Aeration is not required,
just rousing.  If you swirl the carboy to get the yeast back into suspension
that should be sufficient. As long as you don't remove the airlock, the
headspace will be all CO2 and you won't be aerating.


Regarding your recipe which contiained an ounce of oak chips, I'd like
to point out (again) that the only IPAs to have any oak character are those
made by Ballentine's, here in the US.  The original English IPAs would not
have had any oak character because:


1. they used european oak which takes more than a year to impart any oak
   character,


2. many of the breweries used pitch-lined casks, and


3. if you were shipping beer to India and never expected to see the cask
   again, would you use a new cask or one of your well-worn ones?  Wineries
   replace their oak casks frequently because they lose what little oaky
   character they had with repeated use.  At Rodenbach, they disassemble the
   tuns and scrape a thin layer of wood off to expose fresh wood.  There is
   virtually no oak character in the regular Rodenbach (most of the blend
   which is made of beer that spends only a year in the tuns) and a
   significant amount in the Grand Cru which spends three years in the oak
   tuns.  Since the trip around the cape was less than 4 months, I don't
   think that would be enough time to give the original IPAs to have picked
   up any oak from the old, well-used casks.


Sorry... pet peave.

IMO, we are all on the learning curve. great to have you aboard, and we =
welcome the questions.


>I needed bottles so I (ugh!) dumped it, not saving a one.


my general advice, which i no doubt picked up on the hbd, is to let any =
batch age for awhile before giving up. even if you have to buy more =
bottles - they'll come in handy some day :-)


>Now I have a similar problem, although this time it is a lager. =20
>I made this batch two weeks ago and, when I went to bottle it, I =
noticed
>the same skunky odor (and taste) the porter had.=20


a skunky odor implies that you have a lightstruck beer. hops form some =
nasty smelly compounds when exposed to light. on the other hand, lager =
yeasts will generate h2s, which smells like rotten eggs. if the smell is =
not skunky, but rather eggy, then wait it out. this 'aroma' will go away =
with age.


>Since my homebrew store was all out of liquid yeast (less than 8 months
>old) I used the dry yeast that came with the Blue Mtn Lager (I can feel
>you all cringe) and began what I hoped would be fermentation at 52 deg. =




dry yeast is ok, but liquid yeast is better. i've never tried a true =
lager with dry lager yeast. my understanding is that most dry lager =
yeasts will not ferment at true lager temperatures. (your 52 degrees is =
what i consider a true lager temp.)


>When no activity occured after 5 days


oh oh. plenty of time for the beasties to take over. at 52 degrees, =
though, the beasties will be slowed down just like the yeasties.


>I asked my (sold out of good liquid yeast) homebrew supplier what he
>recommended.  He told me to use the old Wyeast he had, but I didn't =
trust it.


although i have no data to support this, i think i would trust old =
wyeast more than old dry yeast, which is what the yeast was that was =
under the lid of your can in the kit.


>Now, however, I have this odor and taste and, hence, my questions:


>What could have caused this?=20
yeast, light, or perhaps autolysis after fermentation. however, it =
sounds like there were enough problems before fermentation that =
autolysis would not be the culprit


>Could it just be the yeast?
perhaps


Will it go away with time (and get better)?
give it a try. if it doesn't, that's another data point


>Was it the temperature changes (from 52 to 74 to 54)?
naaaaah.


>How about all the hops?
ditto


>Have I harmed the beer by racking it to the other fermenter?
>What about oxidation?

lurking for a few months. All this new HBD information has helped me 
greatly. I thank you. Now for my query. I've seen Fermentaps advertised 
in most magazines, but don't know anyone that has used one. Does anyone 
have any insight as to it's usefullness or it's pitfalls. I think this 
was asked not too long ago, but I don't remember seeing a reply.
Thanks in advance. Larry Davids, Glen Head, NY

The only times I've had that Heineken skunk odor/flavor develop in my homebrew 
was before I knew better, I allowed the sun to hit my primary fermentor for 
only about 10 or 15 minutes while transferring to my secondary. Initially, I 
blamed it on the East Kent Golding hops as it was the first time I used them, 
but my subsequent batch, using Fuggles, resulted in the same offending 
odor/flavor. Only then, after very little research, did I come to the 
conclusion that my "new" racking procedure in the open sunlight was causing 
this phenomenon. I haven't had a reoccurrance since I started paying attention 
to the light conditions of my environment. It was suprising how such a short 
exposure to direct sunlight caused this problem. I ended up throwing these two 
batches out as I still have never seen any information as to how to get rid of 
that flavor once it's affected your beer.


Good luck solving your light struck beer problem.
