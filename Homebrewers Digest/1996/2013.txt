Subject: Advice needed on incorporating homebrew club


        I have been looking into preparing the documents to incorporate a 
homebrew club as a non-profit, tax exempt organization.  I read a few of the 
articles about this on the AHA web site but still have some questions.


        Has anyone out there incorporated their club within the last few 
years?  The state incorporation documents are fairly straightforward.  The 
tricky part is getting the IRS to issue an "exemption letter."  Apparently, 
the IRS is picky about the "purpose statement" of the club contained in its 
articles of incorporation.  If anyone has been successful in obtaining this 
exemption letter from the IRS, I would greatly appreciate if you could email 
me your purpose statement and related documents.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: The elusive 5/8 garden hose


Please forgive me for what I know is a very regional question, but I'm 
hoping those who don't live in Toronto will treat it like yet another 
request for a brewpub in [insert city you where don't live here] and 
simply scroll past.
There, now that they've all gone, I've got a question for brewers in 
Toronto. I'm in the process of making a counterflow chiller, and have 
the copper pipe and the Phil's Phittings. What I can't find is the 5/8 
inch garden hose. I thought it would be easy, but it seems the skinny 
little 1/2 inch has become the industry standard, and there are no 5/8 
to be found. Over the last few weeks, I've gone to Canadian Tire, 
Wal-Mart, various Home Hardwares, and every mom n' pop hardware store 
I've happened by. Nothing doing, and I'm getting desperate. Please, if 
anyone knows a source for 5/8 hose in Toronto, let me know, wouldja? 
Alternately, if anyone has cobbled together a workable chiller from 1/2 
inch hose, I'd be interested in hearing from you too, because if it does 
work, I know plenty of sources for _that_ stuff. Thanks. BTW, it has to be a 
garden hose, not just some tubing of the appropriate diameter, because the 
hose's threaded tap fittings are needed for the chiller.
Thanks again,
Mitch.

In HBD 2010,  Tim Martin posted about "Dating Wyeast Packs".
I was in a hurry and only skimmed the post, something about
'38-D cup' and 'will I love it?'.  


Tim, you have many fine qualities, and I'm sure there are many
lovely micro-organisms who would love to go out with you.  Don't
sell yourself short and date Wyeast for cup size.  Oh sure,  a 
swelling smack-pack is a quick thrill.   We've all been there. 
Don't overlook M&F ale yeast or Red Star or Edme.  They're all
attractive and should offer stimulating companionship for a fine 
brewer such as yourself.


Wish I could offer more help, but I only had a chance to scan the
post quickly.       ;-)

Tho' it's undoubtedly true that the malting conditions are responsible
for the available DMS, it's also quite true that different yeasts
produce vastly different amounts of H2S.  I've made many ales from
Breiss 2-row - usually using Wyeast 1028 without a wiff of rotten egg
smell, but when using the same malt and Wyeast 2308 it's sulphur city.


As the smell dissipates it seems to leave a sharp, crisp edge and a
characteristic full aroma, which admitedly may be due to other factors
than the H2S.

You should mix the mash real well once per decoction/infusion/whatever..  
After that, the temperature should be pretty consistent throughout and pretty
stable.

That's unnecessary and probably not a good idea.  Also, when you stir, you may
notice that steam rises from the grain bed.  That's a sign of heat loss from
your mash.


9 deg F is a huge difference.  Are you keeping the lid of the Gott on during
the mash?  That's what it's there for, after all.  Without that, it's not much
better than a plastic bucket.  


My first guess would be that your thermometers are either different "speeds" 
or not calibrated well.  I have three or four thermometers, maybe more, and
they all tend to give the same readings, though one always shows a couple 
degrees cooler than the others.  More importantly, one is much slower reacting
than the rest.  (Those metal-dial ones are speedy.)  Anyway, if you put this 
slow one and another in the mash and read after 20 seconds, it will look 10 
or more degrees cooler.  CLose it up, walk away, come back after 2-3 minutes 
and they match pretty close.


As for what effects a temperature gradient will have on your mash...  I dunno,
I guess it'd be like mashing some of it at one temp and some at another.

No sir.  Most big commercial breweries treat their beer to make it immune to 
skunking.  I forget if they add a chemical or remove one, but they prevent 
that reaction from taking place.

I find that dipping the seeds in a little mercury before you plant them 
really helps keep your coriander from being skunked.  (Use you bare hands.)

1) You bake your bottles more carefully than I did, and 2) you started with 
stronger bottles than I did.  I think I made it pretty clear in my post that 
I was using cheap weak bottles and letting them cool down too fast.  


I find it pretty hard to believe you've never broken a single bottle - I know 
a lot of bleach sanitizers who've had a broken bottle or two now and then.

But, you have to decide three days in advance when you're going to bottle
a batch.  That works for a lot of people, but not for me.  I usually would 
bake the bottles only a few hours in advance.  That's real bad.

Can they still?  I read some recent cases, in Utah I believe, where some folks
were prosecuted for possession.  I'm not positive which nation, I think Ute.


Either way, the religious exception for Catholics during Prohibition was on
First Amendment grounds, I think.

Subject: CO2 bottle security




Art McGregor  has a kegging question in HBD 2012:
"... securing the CO2 tank.  Does anyone have a simple,
but effective way to make sure the CO2 tank won't fall over, which could 
cause
the valve to bust off, thus sending the tank off like a rocket thru the 
house?
What I might do is build a wooden box that is a little bit larger than the
diameter of the tank and then bolt the box to the concrete floor, then put 
CO2
tank inside of wood box.  If there is a simpler method I would like to 
know."


OK...I have 2.  First, I put my tank in a 5 gallon plastic bucket, saved 
from a failed attempt at constructing a Zapap lauter tun.  It holds my 5 lb 
CO2 bottle and regulator quite nicely.  Second, I have a small diameter 
bungee cord wrapped around the bottle just below the valve.  When the bottle 
isn't in the bucket, it is bungee'd ever so slightly to some table leg or 
other object so that dogs and kids and clumsy adults like me don't kick it 
over accidentally.  It seems to take only a little effort and forethought to 
protect everybody from this potentially very dramatic problem.  The box is 
good, but these are cheap, portable, and handy...and you can do either one 
now, before you turn your computer off.

Hi HBers,


I just got to try a few bottles of my second batch of extract brew! 
Unfortunately and unlike my first good batch, I am having flat beer 
problems in SOME bottles and not in others of the same batch. I am 
puzzled but would like to question the group for ideas.
I think maybe I stopped the yeast in an 80 degree room. The only other 
thing I can think of is the bleach not being completely rinsed (I rinsed 
three times).

OG: 1.054
FG: 1.014
Primary carboy 1 week
Secondary carboy 2 weeks

Bottle caps of opened bottles were not apparently damaged


Thanks for any and all help!

From: Russell Mast <rmast`at`fnbc.com>
Subject: Flavenoids?




There is an article in today's Chicago Tribune (4/16/96 section 1, p 12)
that describes research of John Folts at University Wisconson at Madison,
and implies that "dark beer may prevent heart disease".  Which is cool with
me, but the level of technical detail of the article is pretty shabby.  


For instance, it says "That's because particles called wort are removed 
earlier in the processing of light-colored beer".  That's the tribune's 
writing up of an AP wire's paraphrase of the researcher, hopefully pretty 
far from Folts' original words.


Anyway, the meat of it says "Like red wine and grape juice, dark beer 
contains vitamin-like compounds called flavenoids that inhibit platelet 
activity in the blood, making it less sticky and less likely to clog 
arteries."  It also mentions that black tea and many fruits and vegetables 
are rich in flavenoids, and that coffee is low in flavenoids.  


Okay, perfesser, what are flavenoids, and how do they get in beer?  Somehow,
"particles called wort" doesn't do it for me.  Are these melanoidens, tannins,
or something totally different?  Is it really a dark/light distinction, or is
there more/less to it?  Inquiring minds want to know.  Anyone know some facts
about this?


This Folts guy is the same one who, in 1974, showed that aspirin was good for
treating heart disease, again by slowing platelet activity.  They have one 
direct quote from him "We're not suggesting people go out and drink beer or 
other alcoholic beverages.  They may be better off drinking tea, grape juice 
or eating fruits and vegetables."  Well - I'm suggesting you go out and drink
beer.  (Or stay home and drink beer.  That's fine, too.)

This works great for me. Before filling, put a pint of water into the 
keg, cover with a lid and put a flame under it for a couple of minutes.
This will sanitize it nicely with steam (leave the valve at the bottom 
open during this and it should get blasted as well). Pitch the yeast and
cover the keg with a trash bag. A couple of days later, skim the
hops/trub/yeast that rises up, and then skim again a couple of days
later (save this second skimming for pitching into next batch). Skimming
will serve to reduce the final amount of sediment enough so you can use
the valve to drain to your secondary.


Hope this helps.

Subject:  Freezing Yeast Question


Hey Neighbors,


This weekend I wanted to try and freeze yeast in glycerine for
the first time so I slipped down to my friend Revco drug store
to pick up a bottle of glycerine.  After locating the bottle and
reading the contents it had the word "emollient", a skin
softener, for external use only on the label.  On the back it
gave the 1-800 phone number for the National Poison Control
Center.  Needles to say I didn't buy it.


My question is... is this the right stuff, if not what is or should
I bag glycerine and use sugar as a few people have posted?


All help is appreciated.
TIA
Tim Martin

Still more water questions.
I had a water analysis done on my two wells with the following results:


                  Well #1       Well #2
                    ppm           ppm
                  _______       _______


Calcium              1            28
Magnesium            1             1
Sodium              18             8
Potassium            2             4
Bi-carbonate         8            77
Sulfate              9             6
Chloride            24            12
pH                  5.4           6.6
Total Cations       22            41
Total Anions        41            95
Total ppm           63           136
Percent Sodium


I am not sure yet what it all means, but one thing I wondered about was
something A.J. DeLange said in hbd #2011 about calcium being necessary in
mashing to allow the grains to bring the water pH down.  Since my pH is already
low on well #1, whose water I usually use, is this a concern to me?  The few
times I have tested my mash pH it was in the 5.0-5.4 area, I think.
I have added gypsum when doing ales, although blindly before I got the results
of the water test.  I was going by hardness test strips indicating soft water.
Would this lower pH even more or does the low calcium level prevent this?
I was adding gypsum to the kettle after the sparge.


I would think well #1 water would be best for pilsners and #2 for ales, if I
treated neither.
Is it practical or even worthwhile to add salts to try to approximate the
water of the location of the beer style I am brewing?
*******************************************************************************


On another subject, Kirk Fleming was commenting in the same issue on extraction
efficiency.  I think I see his point about the difference between extraction
efficiency and system efficiency, but I find it most useful to me to compute
my efficiency on the amount of grain used and the volume of wort in the
fermenter.  It may not compare to published efficiencies but it tells me how
much grain to use to arrive at the desired OG in the fermenter.  I have given
up on reaching Dave Miller numbers anyway.

Subject: Where To Get Cool Tap Handles


Here's an odd, strange or [borderline] pathetic query to anyone out there
who runs, owns, distributes or is otherwise affiliated with the microbrew
industry: where can I get a cool tap handle?


I ask because I am constructing a bar and, while my existing tap handle is
perfectly functional, the stock black handle that came with my tap is rather
plain in comparison to the artsy and often clever tap handles that we all
see in the bars.  If anyone out there in HBD land has access to cool or
otherwise nifty tap handles, I'd be willing to pay for one.  Thanks... CDR

Heya Barry!


An imersion chiller is basically taking runnning cold water and putting it
inside the brewpot instead of having static cold water around the outside.
This is more efficient if you get enough flow through the tube, and enough 
surface area to allow for good heat transfer.  If your going to make one
to chill a 5 gal batch of wort, I would reccomend using about 1/2" Cu tubing
(or pipe) 10' - 15' long.  Coil it so it fits inside the kettle (can't kink
it!) and run one end to your cold water faucet, and the other to the sink
drain.


I made a wort chiller by using a counterflow heat exchanger.  This is a 
double walled tube where you run one liquid thru the center tube in one
direction, and the other fluid thru the outer tube in the opposite direction.
I used two refrigeration condensing coils linked together.  The inner tube is
about 1/2" dia, and the outer tube (jacket) is about 3/4" or 7/8" dia.  I run
the wort thru the inner tube (sanitizing with idophor and rinsing with *hot*
water beforehand) and cold tap water thru the jacket.  This gets 95 C wort
down to 10 C between the kettle and fermenting tank.  Your mileage will vary
depending on flow rates and what your cooling water temp is.


I don't have the heat transfer calc's handy, but if you don't have a HVAC or
heat transfer book around, and you want to run your own numbers, I can send
you the formulae.

You can do that, but it'd be a lot of work - the place where you got your
cylinder
should sell/have mounts for cylinders that clamp on to tables/desks or can
be bolted 
directly to a wall.  There are also cylinder stands for 'laboratory and
demonstration'
purposes, which basically are steel versions of your wooden box, but aren't
bolted
to the floor.  If you can't get/afford one of these, you can get by just
making the
base of the box  sufficiently wide - say by attaching it to a 2' x 2' piece
of plywood - 
so it can't tip over.


I'd also reccomend making one side hinged with a latch so you don't have to
pick up
the cylinder, increasing the risk of dropping it and knocking the valve
off..  Also,
whenever your cylinder is not in use, make sure the cap is on it.  If you
transport the
cylinder in a vehicle, DOT requires this as well as making sure it's
properly secured.


An additional point, concerning regulations/safety, make sure you have adequate
ventillation - 20# of liquid CO2 at 800 psi is a lot of gas, and while not
poisonous,
CO2 is an asphyziant that is heavier than air and will displace available O2
if you
get a big leak.


Whatever way you decide to go, make sure you do secure the cylinder, 'cause 
not only will it be a rocket, it'll be an uncontrolled rocket that will go
through
your house *many* times (including brick walls)

Subject: Carbonation Question


OK... it's my turn for a question.  I just completed my first attempt
at using a CO2 tank for carbonation on a corny keg, and have run into
a problem that I didn't imagine happening.


After carbonating, during bottleing, the dissolved CO2 rapidly
comes out of solution in the hose running from the corny keg to the
bottle, causing it to come out as 98% foam (well ok, maybe only 95% :)


I've kept the keg in my garage (natures fridge) and it's at about 40F.
CO2 pressure was at 40psi, and the keg was agitated for about 15 minutes.
After this time, I released the pressure, and re-applied appx. 1psi to
push the beer out of the keg.  As soon as the beer gets past the quick
disconnect and into the PVC hose, it starts to bubble and foam.
At first I thought I was overpressurizing it, and backed the pressure
off - no difference.  Then, I removed the plug from the keg and tried
a plain old-fashioned siphon.  Same damn thing, and the gas coming out
killed the siphon in short order too.


My current theory is that the relatively warm PVC line caused a vapor
pressure difference, allowing the CO2 to come out.  My temporary solution
was pitchers of beer, but after all that, it was still a bit flat from
foaming all over the place.  For the next batch I'm going to try making
sure that the beer is really chilled (closer to 32F) and that the fill
line is chilled as well to minimize the delta T.


Does this sound like an appropriate solution, or am I missing something
and just pissing in the wind?

    To: 
        homebrew`at`hpfcmgw.fc.hp.com




Several weeks ago I asked the groups advice on installing a beer shank on 
the
vertical wall of a chest freezer.  I was concerned about running into 
cooler
or condenser coils running through the sides.  I received many replys and 
I
thank you one and all for your help.  The methods offered are summarized:


1.  Cut a probe hole into the skin of the freezer, clean out some 
insulation
and see where it is safe to drill.  Drill the required 1" hole and cover 
any
exploratory holes with steel plates or caulk.


2.  Build a wooden "collar" that fits between the top of the freezer and 
the
lid.  Then drill required holes in the wood.


3.  Build a box out of foam and fiberglass and glass it on to the top and
then cut a hole in the lid under the box and mount the shank on front of 
the
fiberglass box.


Although I really wanted to go with option 1 originally, I ultimately
chickened out due to fear of ruining the freezer. A also wanted to keep 
the
co2 bottle outside the box so this doubled my risk (2 holes).  Plus if I 
ever
wanted to add a second shank, I'd be playing roullette again. Option 3
sounded good, but I have no experience with fiberglass so didn't go with 
this
one either.  I think this would be a good option for someone who knows 
what
they are doing.


I finally settled on option 2.  I was afraid of just raising the lid up 
the
height of a 2X4 as this would mean drilling more holes in the back of the
freezer to reposition the lid hinges, so I built the collar out of 1x10 
pine
shelving.  I went whole hog and sandwiched 3/4" cellotex insullating
sheathing between two pieces of 1x10.  This made the collar almost the 
exact
thickness of the freezer walls.  I'm very happy with the outcome.  The 
shank
is up at a comfortable level, and best of all I now have beer on tap!


Thanks again to all the valuable advice I got from the group.  I really 
enjoy
reading the articles posted here.  I think I'm actually learning 
something
about home brewing.


BTW, does anyone have a source for a drain pan that I can use with my new 
keg
cooler to catch the drips and foam from the beer shank?


TIA

Greetings,
  Caution! Delurking for a first post to HBD! Please forgive any problems I
may encounter.
  I have two questions. First, can any of the metallurgists out there tell me
if a stainless half barrel keg can be damaged by being partially filled with
water for several weeks at a time. A friend uses his brew kettles for water
baths for his carboys and is wondering if this can cause pitting or any other
damage.
  Second, is there anyone out there who can tell me if Celis is shipping
their products to Arizona, Nevada, or New Mexico? I need some Celis White,
and am willing to travel to get some.
TIA, Doug in California
