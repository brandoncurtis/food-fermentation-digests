Greetings All!


   This is my first post after lurking for over 1 1/2 years!  I wish to
thank the collective for the vast amount of experience I feel like I have
'absorbed'.  I've only brewed 8 extract-based batches, but have learned much 
from you all!  I know I have and will have saved much $$$ and heartache from 
the posts of this digest. Again, Thanks!


   Stationed in Germany with the U.S. Army, I began homebrewing shortly
after arriving here and have not had ANY face-to-face contact with a fellow
homebrewer.  I am lucky :) to have many friends on which I am able to test
my product and am ALWAYS striving to pleasantly surprise them.  I have
usually been sucessful!


   I would enjoy making a face-to-face with a fellow homebrewer and would be 
grateful to have someone convert ME to all-grain!  I haven't been able to
thoroughly visualize the process and the steps involved.  I need to know
what to order (all through mail-order) and where to go from there.  I would
gladly treat to great German food and a trip to the WORLD'S LARGEST BEER
STORE in Darmstadt, Germany (I don't represent them, but they carry over
1200 beers from over 250 countries!) if someone could spend a day or so with 
my wife and I (+ a newborn which SHOULD be here by the time this is
POSTED!!!)  Please email if interested!

A thought occurred to me as I was reading the debate about H2S and DMS. =
I would assume that some of the H2S production by yeast is from the =
reduction of DMS. That would suggest that high H2S producers would have =
less of a DMS note than low H2S producers, given the same wort. Perhaps =
those looking to enhance the DMS note in their beers would best look for =
a low H2S producing yeast. The logic is infallible, even if the facts =

Subject: germany's Roggen beer clone


HBDers,
I'm planning this weekend to brew a beer similar to Roggen from Germany.  I
beleive
it's a wheat beer with a certain portion of rye in it.  Anyway, I'm thinking of
12# wheat malt,
3# rye flakes. 5# of pale malt and 2# of rice hulls to help with sparge.
10 gallon batch  applies.  Yeast will be Wyeast 3068.


I'm planning a single decoction mash.  So how 'bout it?
          1)  Can rye flakes be safely decocted along with the other grains?
           2) Does anyone know what Roggen's grain mix is?
           3)  Am I creating the "sparge from hell"?


On another topic:


I saw in the April/May edition of the Ale Street News (pg.15) that a Jim Simpson
of 
Queens NY won the Sam Adams homebrew contest.  They will be releasing the Sam 
Adams Pale Ale this summer adapted from his recipe.

40psi!!!  Whoa Nelly!  At 40F you probably want more like 16psi, and that's
for a fairly high 2.5-2.6 volumes (approx.).  Heck, I don't think my chart
even goes all the way to 40!  As for fixing your problem, I think there was
a past digest that described a procedure for correcting this problem.
Anyone remember how this is done??

Hello all,


I am in the midst of making a Scotch Ale and was given a couple
ounces of Heather. I was just wondering if anyone has any
experience using heather. My thought s on the subject are to do
one of the following two things.


1. Bring a small amount of WORT to a boil add the heather, turn
off heat pour into secondary than rack Ale from primary into
secondary and allow it to condition this way.


2. Just dump heather into secondary than rack directly on top of
this.


Given the mild aroma of the heather I was concerned #2 would not
infuse much flavour.




Private Email is great I will condense the responses and post the
answers.

   The DOT also requires the tank be within current hydro approval. Some
places will no fill the tank if it is not, others may not notice.  I know I
have a tank that is at least 10 years out of hydro inspection yet the local
gas place filled it last time.  I have since been certified as a tank
inspector (scuba cylinders) and have dubbed myself as a bad example!
Hopefully my tank isn't a recalled one and won't descide to explode any
time soon!  It's also a good idea to have the tank visually inspected.  I
don't know the requirements for CO2 tanks but SCUBA tanks should be
visually inspected once a year (usually) and hydrostatically tested once
every 5 years.  I assume CO2 has some sort of guidelines as well.

   And the people who may happen to be in the way.  You will also gain a
new respect for the things if you view some of the aftermath of tank
explosions.  Granted, scuba tanks are at about 3000 psi but the 700 psi of
a CO2 cylinder is still enough to attract your attention.

You might not have gotten the priming sugar mixed well with the beer before 
bottling.  I usually stir *very gently*  with a sanitized SS spoon before I 
begin to bottle.


Also, if they were filled to different levels, the amount of headspace could 
effect the carbonation in individual bottles.

I know that some people on the list use or want to use PET bottles for beer 
storage.  The consensus is that long term storage (over a month or so) will 
cause massive oxidation of your precious brew.


WELL, I just read somewhere that the PET bottle makers have come up with a 
new type of bottle for tomato juice (V-8?) that keeps the contents safe 
from oxygen.  Apparently, tomato juice also has a problem with oxidation...

From: Spencer W Thomas <spencer`at`engin.umich.edu>
Subject: Re: Carbonation Question 


Jim asks about how to keep his beer from foaming when bottling from
the keg. 


What he needs is a counter-pressure bottle filler.  Here's how he can
make one for (almost) free.


What you need:


* CO2 tank with two hoses (you can get by with one, but it's harder.)
* Two kegs, one with beer, one empty.
* A "cobra tap".  I have one with a "hose" about 3 inches long that's
  ideal for this purpose.
* A 1 1/2-inch piece of plastic tubing
* A 12-inch piece of hard plastic tubing, cut from a racking cane.
* A small (number 3?) one-hole stopper that will fit into the mouth
  of a beer bottle. 
* Patience & practice


What you do:
   
At any time before you want to bottle:


1. Slide the racking cane through the stopper, so that the long part
   reaches to the bottom of your bottles when the stopper is inserted
   firmly into the mouth of the bottle.   Sanitize it.


2. Attach the cane to the tap with the short plastic tubing.  It's
   hard getting the tubing over the tap -- warming it will help.  


Before bottling:


1. Chill your beer and bottles as cold as possible.  32F is good.
   (Sanitize the bottles and cover them with little squares of
   aluminum foil first.)


2. Flush the empty keg with CO2.  I routinely fill my kegs with
   iodophor, then push it out with CO2 before storing.  Thus, my empty
   kegs are full of CO2.


3. Attach the tank hoses to the "In" connectors on the kegs, and set
   the pressure to about 10lbs.  Make sure that the pressure in the
   beer keg is not higher than this.


To fill a bottle (repeat as many times as necessary):


1. Place the tap-cane assembly onto the empty keg.  Do NOT open the
   tap yet! :-)


2. Push a bottle onto the filler, seating the stopper firmly.  Now
   repeat several times: open and close the tap, pressurizing the
   bottle.  Release the pressure by moving the bottle down slightly.
   You can also allow a continuous flow of CO2 into (and out of) the
   bottle, if you prefer.  Finish by pushing the bottle firmly onto
   the stopper and pressurizing it.  Close the tap.  Do NOT let go of
   the bottle and stopper -- you want to keep it pressurized.


3. Remove the tap-filler-bottle assembly from the empty keg and attach
   it to the full keg.  Open the tap.  No beer should flow because the
   pressures are equal.


4. Carefully push "up" on the side of the stopper until beer starts
   flowing slowly into the bottle.  This takes strong fingers and good
   control to do right.  After a few gushers you'll get the hang of
   it!  Let the beer flow until the bottle is almost full.  Close the
   tap.  Now, gently release the stopper to relieve the pressure in
   the bottle.  You may get a small amount of foaming, but shouldn't
   get much.


5. Move the whole assembly back to the empty keg.  Lower the bottle
   until the cane (full of beer, still) is just at the beer level in
   the bottle.  Now, *carefully* open the tap *very slightly* so that
   the remaining beer flows into the bottle, and a little CO2 follows
   to help drive oxygen from the headspace.


6. Quickly cap the bottle.




It sounds like a painful process, but it's not too bad once you get
the hang of it.  I bottled almost a full case (3 different beers) this
way the other night, and got NO BEER ON THE CEILING!  And only a
little bit on my hands!


You've probably got most of the parts already, so it might cost you a
grand total of $0!

 This talk about securing CO2 tanks reminds me of an incident which happened 
when I was an orderly at a hospital in Bay City, Mich. back in the 60's.  We 
hooked up oxygen tents, and schlepped the tanks around on little hand trucks
to which they were strapped, and I'm talking BIG tanks----about 5 feet tall, 
maybe 75 lbs full.  One afternoon a tank tipped over on Dave, just as he 
passed a concrete stairwell.  The tank bounced down the stairs, hit the 
bottom, and snnapped off the valve----that tank took off, blew through a 
concrete block wall like tissue paper, hit a Ford Ranchero on the outside 
and shot up and over the 8 story hospital, making a ghastly whirring roar 
as it went. It landed on a street corner about 2 blocks away. 
   We were most impressed, especially Dave-- a lot of times he would loop 
his hand thru the web strap securing the tank to the hand truck "for better 
control".  What a ride that would have been! 
   
   If the guy in the Ranchero is a homebrewer, maybe he's reading this and 
taking a trip thru "bad memory lane".

I don't know which nations, but I remember the case you are thinking of. 
I think what it boiled down to (pun intended) was that only the clergy 
(medicine 
men? -I don't know the PC term) could grow & prepare the peyote.  Anybody
else could be prosecuted.  The intent is to permit legitimate, traditional
use but prohibit the bogus legal-sidestepping by other wannabes.  I think the
people in Utah were busted because they were distributing the stuff to anyone
willing to pay for it.


He also asks about "flavenoids":

I recall reading about flavin in George Fix's "Brewing Science", but I don't
remember any connection to the color of the malt.  I thought it was a phenolic
compund.  Going back to a biochem textbook, flavonoids appears to be a class
of water-soluble nitrogenous pigments derived from isoalloxazine.  Riboflavin 
(vitamin B2) is an example.  Flavin is apparently found in a variety of yellow 
plant pigments. It's also found in malted barley.


I have a feeling that the news media distorted the story to say it was only
in "dark beer".  What they probably should have said was "all-malt beers",
but since the media and the general public are clueless, the story read "dark
beers" in contrast to "regular beer" meaning good old American high-adjunct
beer.  It wouldn't have pleased the budmilloors for the media to say flavenoids
were found in just about all beer but theirs.  Since budmilloors are big 
sponsors
of the media, I think the story line got slanted to make people think it has to 
do
with the color of the beer rather than the malt content.  The big 3 are quite
carefull to avoid admitting their beers are high in adjuncts or have the public
even know what an "adjunct" is.


Gee, didn't most of us beer enthusiasts know that "real beer" has lots of 
B vitamins in it?  And no, it has nothing to do with "The last real beer"!


Disclaimer - when it comes to biochem, I don't really know what I'm talking
about, but I can fake it from time to time.  Hopefully a real expert will go 
into
more depth on this flavonoid topic.

In his process, Nigel adds dry yeast to a bottle and adds wort to it.


If you don't rehydrate your dry yeast, you can have longer lag times than
with dry yeast than with Wyeast *without* a starter.  I once had a 3 day
lag with a package of dry yeast that I did not rehydrate.  I regularly
get a layer of foam on top within 12 hours with one package of dry yeast,
rehydrated for 15-30 minutes in 90-110F water (32-43C).


If you insist on using a starter for dry yeast (although I, personally, don't
feel it is necessary if you rehydrate), I suggest you rehydrate in 90-110F
water, let that cool to 80F while the yeast rehydrates and then pitch that
into your starter at 80F (27C).


Another reason for having long lag times is temperature-shocking the
yeast when it is rehydrating -- i.e. rehydrating in too-cool a liquid,
be it water or wort.  I don't recall the exact temperature from the
Lallemand Newsletter, but it was not much cooler than 90F.


While we are on the subject of dry yeast, it wouldn't hurt to mention
that it should ideally be refrigerated till use.  I've had relatively
good luck with dry yeast stored at room temperature, but not nearly
as good fermentations as those with refrigerated yeast.

I have a couple of thoughts on the question:


1. The hops i've found wild in this area (Minnesota) grow in semi-shade.
   So maybe the sun isn't much of a problem under those growing
   conditions.


2. As I understand it, the active principle in hops is the
   bright-colored powder at the base of the brachts. If this is so, it
   seems unlikely that it could be affected by sunlight until it is
   forced from its protective home.


Be gentle. This is my first post.

Greetings from Western New York!


I just joined this list a couple days ago, but have some questions which need
to be answered.  I am attempting to use isinglass for the first time on a 5
gal. batch of porter, but am unsure as to how to correctly proceed.  The guy
at the local homebrew supply store (Hobby House - Clarence, NY) suggested
adding it immediately after pitching the yeast at the inception of
fermentation.  Another fellow homebrewer suggested adding it 2-3days before
bottling.  Which, if either, is correct?  Is a specific isinglass temp.
necessary?  Is stirring recommended?  I really need detailed instructions to
avoid disaster... Please?


Secondly, what are possible side effects of incomplete rinsing of bottles &
equipment following a bleach soak?  I've been triple rinsing all my equipment
and especially bottles, but am not really sure if this is enough.  Please
advise.


Finally, I'd like to plug a homebrew supplier that has never failed me for
the lowest prices, widest selection, and most knowledgeable staff I've ever
encountered.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone who has trouble finding

Definitely true if the pitcher is transparent and the lager is hopped
any higher than the megaswill brands.  Last summer I wandered into
my garden with a glass of ale knowing full well that I was tempting

>
Exactly! I tried building an outlet tube that was set at the level of the
grainbed, with a TEE pointing up that functioned as a siphon break. It
worked, but not very well, and because of the capillary action, the siphon
break aerated the wort the way a venturi would. The concept won't scale down
to the 3/8-in copper tubing that I use throughout my system.


Even without the bubbling, there is another problem: even using just water,
because of friction in the tubing (resistence), the water level in the mash
tun DOES rise above the highest point in the outfeed, so there is more
sparge water IN than there is sweet wort OUT.

>


Yes and no--Here's how I think the U-tube is supposed to work in theory, but
not at a small scale (speculation to follow):


The inverted U IS the siphon break. The distance between the top of the U
and the bottom of the outfeed leg function as the set points, ie, the sparge
water fills the mash tun until it can induce a siphon over the top of the U.
The siphon increases the flow rate, thereby draining the grainbed. But as
soon as the level in the grainbed falls to the level of the bottom of the
outfeed leg, the siphon is broken, and the mash tun must again fill high
enough to induce a siphon over the top of the U. Therefore, if the distance
between the top of the U and the bottom of the outlet tube were say 6-in,
then in a large mash, the sparge water level would fluctuate 6-in.


Since the outfeed of sweet wort is not contained in tubing or a pipe, the
bubbling is eliminated as well as the capillary action that Rob pointed to.
The sweet wort simply drains into the boiling kettle in a steady stream.


>In short, I found that a valve is an easier way to control run-off.


That's how I've been doing it. I set the runoff from the mash tun, and then
manually regulate the amount of sparge water I spray over the top of the
grainbed. I try to maintain no more than 1/4-in above the grainbed. It works
fine this way, I was just looking for a way to slave the sparge water input
to the sweet wort out. Hence, automated, hands-off sparging.

>


If I understand the theory (see above), then it would--the bottom of the
U-tube would function as a siphon break, so the water level in the mash tun
could never fall below that level. If the bottom of the U-pipe was level
with the top of the grainbed, the water level would never drop below it, and
the mash would sort of float.

Yes, I think you are exactly right. As I said above, I think the U-tube
functions as a high/low guage.


>I don't know if a U-tube can help automate your sparging.  If there was only
>water and no grain, for every drop of sparge in, you'd get a drop out.


Nope, that's what I thought too, but we both forgot about resistence within
the dip tube and outlet tube. I tried it with just water and the water level
continued to rise above the theoretical set point. There needs to be a
certain amount of new sparge water on top to PUSH the water thru the tubing.
I think this might work on a large scale, where LOTS of water is being
sprayed on a large mash, but my Phil's sparge arm (which I love, BTW)
doesn't add enough water to push the overflow out, and so, it accumulates
until there is enough weight to overcome the resistence of the pipes.


 
>with the grain, you _can_ add lots of sparge without getting _anything_ out.
>You're relying on the bed remaining very fluffy and permeable.
>


I use an EasyMasher and my grainbed does remain VERY fluffy. BTW, I do my
mashing-in in a 5-gal bucket, adding hot water to it slowly (a spigot from
the boiling kettle) until I have thoroughly mixed in 1.33-qts of mash water
for each pound of grain. Then I pour this into my mash tun and heat to the
set temperature...


>It's a great idea, though, and I hope it works for you.  Please keep up posted.

It was; it didn't; and I have...;-D


Thanks for the input Rob. I had really hoped it would work,

Try a counter pressure bottle filler bottle it has a couple of valves that 
hook up to your co2 tank and to the corny keg. It basically pressurizes (and 
purges the air at the same time) the bottle with co2 and then you run the 
beer into it while you bleed off the co2. We had a demo at our homebrew club
