Subject: Testing CO2 Tanks


Greetings from Motown, well close enough anyways                                


As far as hydro-testing CO2 tanks my advice is CALL AROUND!  And                
yes, I was yelling!  I found a place that really specializes in                 
dry ice but also does a nice business with plain old CO2 gas.                   
They test tanks for $8 (and fill my 20lber for the same.)                       


I have also found a welding gas supplier that would fill a 20lb                 
tank of CO2-N2 mixture for $8, but a hydro test runs about $20,                 
so the moral is "let your fingers do the walking!"  Look up                     
carbonation, welding gases, dry ice, gas, etc in your yellow                    
pages and you might be surprised what you come up with.

Subject: Bottling for competition


        I've been making beer for over a year now and have been brewing all
grain for about six months. I'm starting to make some really good beer from
some of my formulated recipes and I would like to enter some in competition
so I can get some feedback from "decent" beer judging. My problem is, that
I bottle exclusively with swing-top bottles (Grolsch like) and these are
not usually accepted in competition.
        Can someone please tell me why?
        Would it be possible to "transfer" the beer from one of my
swing-tops to another type of bottle without introducing to much oxygen,
and without loosing too much carbonation? I could even leave behind the
sediment!
        I guess I should just crimp a few ordinary bottles (like 6 to 8)
and save those for competition. If the beer turns out to be another winner,
I'll already have it in "regular" bottles to ship out to the judges! But
seeing how I've accumulated a few hundred swing-tops, I don't really have
anymore room for bottle storage.
        Any advice would be apreciated.


Thanks

In fairness to Dr. Folts, I should pint out that the article I read was from
an AP newswire, and he likely had little control over the content thereof.


Still, I would like to know what gives beer flavenoids, and why some are more
equal than others.

Subject: Temp changes


In HBD 2016, David asks about temperature changes affecting his beer:


>I store my bottles of beer in an unused room 
>in my apartment to age out.  We never heat it during the winter because it 
>would cost too much (electric heat's durn expensive!).  Now in the spring 
>we will experience 70 degree weather on day and 30 degree weather the 
>very next (I live in Montana where it's actually the weather that's 
>crazy, not the people :).  Could the radical change in temperature (more 
>like a difference of 20 F inside the room) shock the yeast and kill it or 
>something?  


Temp fluctuations may wreak havoc on your aging beer - my guess is that 
 it can't be beneficial.


My experience says that carbonation is mostly done after a week, so I 
 keep my cases at around 68F for the first week after bottling then 
 move them to the basement - so you might want to keep them out of that 
 room initially, then move them in for longer term storage/aging.  


For your case, if practical in your storage room, you could get a 
 plastic utility tub or two, put your bottles in that, and fill the tub 
 with water up to the neck of the bottles.  If you are _really_ 
 confident of your capping job, I suppose you could fill the entire 
 thing and put as many bottles as possible - all that should happen is 
 possibly rusty caps . . .


The water will create a thermal blanket that will ease the sway of 
 temperatures.  This is also a good trick to use for primary/secondary 
 fermenting as well if you don't have a good temp controlled environment.

Now how many times does this problem need to be discussed before these damn
Homebrewers get it through their skulls...


One more time...


DO NOT... I REPEAT!


DO NOT BREW AROUND PLAID (the dark side is too strong)!!!


This is no joking matter. An awful lot of brewers just don't seem to follow
this simple rule.

Subject: All-grain recipe


I recently tried my first all-grain batch and the results were very
disappointing.  After carefully going over the whole procedure I was able to
pinpoint many of my mistakes.  I would like to know, if this recipe sounds
like a good one?  I would like to try it again and see how the beer improves
by fixing my errors.  Any suggestions or modifications to the recipe would
be welcome.  Here is the recipe:  
        Ingredients: (5 gal.)
        10 lbs. British Pale Ale Malted Barley
        1 lb.    Roasted Unmalted Barley
        1 lb.    Flaked Barley
        2 lbs.  Flaked Oats
        1 lb.    Chocolate Malted Barley
        1 lb.   Crystal 40L
        1 lb.   Black Malted Barley
        2 lbs. Dark Malt Extract (For an X-tra kick)
        3 oz.  Centennial Hop Pellets (Boiling)
        1 oz.  Tettnang Hop Pellets (Finishing)
        #1028 Brewers Choice London Liquid Yeast
 
        OG 1.096   FG 1.024    Alcohol Content about 9.5%


Also, how much will step mashing improve the overall product?  Is it worth
doing? 
You can either post your responses to the list or e-mail me directly
(george`at`smarts.com).  
Thanks in advance for everybody's help and input.


A new and hopefully improving brewer.

Subject: dry ice in brewing


 .int homebrew`at`hpfcmgw.fc.hp.com


 Having become curious again over the dry ice in brewing thread, I asked
 a chemist at one of our major corn based adjunct brewing companies
 about the possibility of contaminants, especially oil in the dry ice.
 His response is that there is very little concern for contaminants, and
 that there are steps in their process that use it. They test for oil
 by dissolving the dry ice in clean water and add a chip of camphor to the
 water, if there is any oil present, the camphor will scoot around on the
 surface of the water. According to him, this test is done for security,
 and they have never found a problem with the dry ice. Hope this helps
 satisfy the curiousity.


 BTW, bring on more of the automated sparge thread! Would love to see mine
 take less time and 'adjustment'. Any good ideas on how to throttle down the
 outgoing end of the lautertun? I have been using a restrictor on the end
 of my hose, but that can get clogged up by grain husks rather easily. I was
 thinking about making a new copper tube bottom with approx .050" holes,
 using about 15-20 of them. My current version with 1/16" holes can flow
 as fast as a 5/16 hose can carry it out. Any comments on how well this might
 work? TIA.

Subject: CaraPils and Dextrine in the Wort






I asked this question a week or so ago and didn't receive any responses.   
 I can't believe with the combined knowledge of the collective that I   
can't get a response. If you take that as a challenge, it is!
Carapils malt or Dextrin malt is suppose to add unfermentables and   
dextrin to the finished product.  I can see how this works when added as   
specialty grains to an extract-based beer since there's no enzymes to   
break the dextrin down.  However, when doing an all-grain mash, do the   
enzymes break the dextrin down into simpler sugars (depending on mash   
temperature, of course)?  Or, do the dextrin chains remain intact (would   
also apply to caramel and dark roasted malts), and if they do, why?   
 Inquiring minds want to know.

The problem with your use of the Carbonator is that it is not designed to
be removed and the bottle recapped. The Carbonator should be used as the
cap. Of course that does not deal with your cost concerns.
Bottles to pass out to friends should probably be done the "old fashioned"
bottle-conditioned way. Another alternative that I've heard (but not tried
myself) is to get some Schrader valves (tire valve stems) from your local
auto supply store. Drill a hole in the PET bottle cap (about 3/8" - measure
the hole in a wheel) - and insert the valve stem from the inside of the
cap. All you need to do is add a standard tire fitting on the end of a CO2
line and go from there. Cost should be less than a buck a piece. Not as
slick as the commercial unit, but the price is right.

Subject: To rack or not to rack


Three weeks ago, planning ahead for the winter, I brewed a barleywine. The
wort went straight from my chiller onto the primary dregs of a fairly
high-gravity IPA that had spent two weeks in primary before I transferred
it, that morning, to a secondary fermenter. 


So. The BW got lots of yeast (Wyeast 1098), though surely inadequate oxygen
(the only method I have besides shaking is the 'holes in a piece of racking
cane' trick that was discussed here a few months back.)  It took off very
quickly: airlock activity within four hours, active fermentation with a
thick kreuzen within 12 hours. Then it seemed to slow down to nothing after
about 4 days but when I tested it, as I expected, it was still WAY underdone
(O.G. 1.095; after 1 week, 1.060) so I left it alone, meaning to give it at
least another week before tranferring and, maybe, pitching some fresh yeast.
Well, I got busy and was unable to transfer right at two weeks. Now, at
three weeks, it seems to have taken on new life. There's lots of airlock
activity, a creamy white layer of foam on top, the gravity continues to drop
(now at 1.048). I tasted some when I took last night's reading, and it
tasted fine (no off flavors, although still obviously too sweet). My question:


I'm nervous about it sitting on all that old yeast and trub but nervous
about moving it off (I've had batches stop cold when I've racked too early
and this one still has at least 20 points to drop). What should I do? What
should I do?

OK, my first batch has been in the bottle for a little over two
weeks.  It is a Williams Brewery Brown Ale.   I Followed the recipe
that came with it exactly.  It spent one week in the primary and I
let it sit another week in a secondary until I was ready to bottle. 
Added the priming sugar, bottled then waited.


     Here's the problem.  Now after two weeks in the bottle I have
a alcoholic club soda that is colored brown.  There is very little
taste in the beer.  I guess it is not infected because there is no
raunchy taste or smell.  Just a well carbonated alcoholic club
soda.


     Has anyone in the collective experienced this problem and
better yet does anyone know the cause/remedy.  I plan on starting
my next batch in a few days and do not want this to happen again.


Private or Public response.

The solution is clear, then.  We wait for this guy to publish the CD ROM, and
then run a class action lawsuit and demand a free copy of the CD for each of us.


Maybe someone should jump the gun and release it as a "co-op" type of effort.
Like, non-profit for us guys, just pay the cost of the CD plus a tiny bit to
cover the time of some dude to put it together.  Maybe with the proceeds going
to some worthy cause.  (Like free beer for Russ.)

We used to use about 3 tbsp or so, and even on a hot day that would take 
10-30 minutes.  But, yeah, it really blows the heck out of the thing.  And
those are really loud.  The bottle is torn to little shreds, too.  I would
think this could cause painful cuts if you're too close, so be careful.


I would estimate that in a regular strength (not designed to be refilled) 
bottle, a couple grains would take a day or two to blow up.  So, uh, don't 
use this to carbonate your beer.  (We got bored with dry ice and moved up to 
HCl and Al foil.  Those go off faster, but not as loud, because the plastic 
is weakened by the heat.  I think this makes some nasty fumes, though, so 
again, don't try this yourself at home.)

I recently read, I think in Cider Digest, someone say that the recommended 
dosage for priming beer is 6 oz for 5 gallons.  (I always use 3/4 cup, but
I always pack it the same, and so forth.)  If this is correct, and my 
calculations are accurate, this will raise the SG of your beer by about .003
or so.  So, figure out how much maple to use on that basis.  (Take an SG 
reading of it, and work from there.)  So, like, if it's 1.060, you'd want to
use approximately 1/20th of a gallon to prime five gallons.  I'm not 100% 
positive on the .003 number, though.  Anyone more certain?  (It's a decent
ballpark figure, though, I think.)  


I asked about this on Cider Digest, but I'll ask here, too.  Lactose is often
used as a sweetener for some beers (etc).  Would someone who is "lactose 
intolerant" have a bad reaction to the levels of lactose used to sweeten a
beer (or cider or mead)?  Even if so, how much would one use?

From: Marty Tippin <martyt`at`sky.net>
Subject: Explain My Extract Yield Increase!


I've now done about 6 batches in my converted keg "pseudo-RIMS" system and
have gotten consistently higher extract yields from the grain than my old
system.  I'm wondering if others with similar systems have seen the same
sort of increase or if I'm just getting lucky...


Background:  The mash/lauter tun in my new system consists of a Sankey keg
with a Sabco folding SS false bottom (many of you have probably seen my web
page detailing the system; if not, the URL is below).  I use a magnetic
drive pump to recirculate the wort during the entire mash, and a propane
burner under the kettle for temperature boosting and maintenance.  The old
system was an easy-masher in a 34-qt. enamel-on-steel kettle, with an
electric stove and the oven for temperature boosting and maintenance.


My usual mash schedule for both systems is pretty much the 40-60-70c
schedule advocated by Dr. Fix (about 30 minutes at each step), with a
mash-out at 165F for about 10 minutes.  Sparging is done with 168F, pH 5.7
water at a rate of about 5 or 6 minutes per gallon (it was a little slower
in the old system; more like 10 minutes per gallon).


Since starting to use the new system, my extract yields have gone from a
consistent 28 to 29 pts/lb/gal to 34+ pts/lb/gal!  The first couple of
batches, this caught me totally off guard and I wound up with a much higher
OG than I intended...


I've been trying to figure out what it is about the new system that caused
this huge (18%+) increase in my efficiency - the most likely cause seems to
be the fact that I'm recirculating the wort during the entire mash - my
guess here is that I'm exposing the grain to more enzymes, more uniformly
than I used to (in the easymasher system, I stirred every 15 minutes or so)
Another thing it could be is the stainless steel false bottom vs. the easy
masher, but it seems like I've seen results that said there were negligible
differences between the two.  The only other factors that come to mind are
possibly better temperature accuracy and control - the hysteresis of my old
system seemed to be a bit more than the new one; I can hit my target temps
now and stay within a degree or so for 45 minutes or longer if necessary


I'm interested in any ideas or comments as to whether the recirculation of
the mash really causes the higher efficiency, and what implications this
might have for others - perhaps it would be a good idea (if one were
interested in increased yield) to stir the grainbed constantly or otherwise
find some way of recirculating the wort.


Thanks!

Subject: Reverse Osmosis Filtered Water


While in the past I have boiled all my brewing water, I have found it
easier, on may occasions, to go to the supermarket and buy filtered 
water for $0.25/gal (just bring in my carboy and fill'er up).  
The dispenser says it is carbon filtered and UV sanitized, but I
just realized it also says it is reverse osmosis filtered.  


Since I've recently begun playing with salt additions to match
brewing water to my beer style, I'm concered my use of R.O. water has
thrown off my water calculations.  


Can someone with appropriate knowledge tell me what ions are removed
and/or added in the reverse osmosis filter process.


Also, just as a sanity check, my first impression of distilled water 
is that it contains no (or almost no) ions.  Is this correct?

Subject: My clean out the closet recipie


Here's the final results of my latest batch.  Actually it turned out very
good.  Nice and dark but no heavy burnt taste.  It probably could have used
a little more hops, or maybe fresher hops.  The alcohol content is rather
low and the flavor is excellent, good head too.  This beer takes on a
decidedly bitter taste when overchilled.  Best consumed cool but not cold.


For about 2 gallons (21 twelve ounce bottles):


1/4 lb. Munton's Crushed Crystal 2-row Malt
1/4 lb. Roast Barley Crushed
1/2 oz. Willamette Hops Pellets (boiling) 
1/2 oz. Northern Brewer Hops Pelletts (finishing)
2  lbs. Laaglander Dark Dried Malt Extract
1  packet Canadian Ale yeast this came with an Ironmaster Canadian Ale Kit 
1  packet Irist Stout yeast this came with a Mountmellick Irish Stout Kit
1/2 to 3/4 cup of corn sugar


What I did: Placed Munton's & Roast Barley in grain bag and put in pot with 
2 1/2 gallons of cold water.  Brought water to a boil.  Removed grain bag as
soon as water started boiling.  Added Willamette Hops and Laaglander DME.
Boiled for 1 hour.  Added Northern Brewer hops and boiled 5 more minutes.
Cooled and added to fermenter.  Pitched Canadian Ale yeast, oops forgot to
rehydrate it first.  Waited 3 days, no activity, yeast must have been too
old.  Repitched with rehydrated Irish Stout yeast which showed good activity
within 8 hours. Fermented until done.  Bottled with 1/2 cup corn sugar. Aged
2 weeks.

Subject: Long slow fermentation


I haven't seen this addressed before, although I've seen variants in the
books...


I started a wheat beer--dunkelweizen, actually, using an Irek's 6.6# can and
another # of DME--on 29 March, using a 10g packet of GlenBrew "secret"
brewer's yeast.  Never tried this type before but it's a typical dried yeast.
 Within 3 hours, fermentation was already underway!  Well, on 1 or 2 April, I
transferred it to a secondary, and I had to leave for a few weeks but I was
sure I'd have to bottle as soon as I got back as most beers I have brewed
have taken no more than 12 days total.


On the 18th of April I returned from my trip and the beer was still kicking!
 I would say poor aeration or inferior yeast; however, I have to say the
fermentation, though long, has been far from sluggish.  It was very active in
the beginning, and now it is pretty slow but steady, and here we are on the
22nd of April.


The SG is at about 1.008 now, and I know that's usually sufficient to bottle,
but I'm afraid to bottle when it's still bubbling this steadily (about once a
minute, realizing that all airlocks are probably different) for fear of a
mess in about a week when the pressure has built up.


Has anyone else had this experience with this yeast or with a wheat?  Any
Ideas?  TIA

I know this was beaten to death a while back, but                               
I don't have access to the archives, and am about                               
to invest in a kegging system.  The store I am going                            
to buy from has both, with only a $1 price differance.                          
Which should I get?  Ball Lock, or Pin Lock?                                    


Does someone have a pro/con type summary of                                     
what was discussed?  E-Mail is fine.                                            


Thanks in advance,
