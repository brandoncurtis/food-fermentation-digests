This past weekend I enjoyed a beer new to me, finding it tasty
and intriguing in profile.  Yes, it is Belgian in origin.


::Hoogstraten Poorter, brewed by Brewery Sterkens in Hoogstraten.


For those who have tried it, what did you think?  It seems to be
unique, reminiscent of an Abbey dubble to me...golden but with
more amber striations...not highly attenuated like Duval, etc.
This beer being unlike a "typical" porter, I wonder if its label
of porter was meant to imply this beer's kinship to an Abbey ale
without any of that "was it then truly Monk-brewed in the Abbey?"


I'd be interested in any of your impressions of this product!
Private Email is probably most appropriate.

in 2 Liter bottles.


May I humbly suggest that you re-pressurize the bottles to 30 psi 
at least once a day, for the first few days that you chill them.  
I have not used bottles for root beer in a while (don't ask, it 
was REALLY bad), instead I force carbonate 4 gallons of RB in a 
5 gallon corny keg (more headspace and surface area for the CO2 
to be absorbed).


The amount of CO2 that was dissolved into the RB was amazing, and 
RB requires quite a bit of CO2 to form a good head, at least a lot 
more than beer.  Also, chilling allows more CO2 to dissolve into 
the liquid.  After a day or so in the fridge with a single blast 
of CO2, the bottles will become pretty squishy with most of the CO2 
absorbed into the RB.


My kids (I swear the kids are "Root Beer Geeks") made faces before 
the carbonation was where they wanted it (they would probably call 
a cask conditioned bitter flat), but now they are into the stuff 
all the time.  Pretty soon they should have the keg emptied, then 
I can fill it with wit!   8^)

A couple of brewers in the Midwest make wild rice beer (James Page in
Minnesota and Capital Brewing of Middleton, WI). They both boil the rice up
ahead of mashing and add it to the mash tun. It does add an interesting,
sort of nutty, flavor.
They don't use anywhere near 1/2 wild rice, though. Maybe 5-10% maximum.


Good luck.

Subject: Beer Nutrients / Bud billboard


A couple of beer nutrient opinions and questions.


On Flavenoids: Flavenoids are, from what I have been able to gather, 
sort-of vitamins. There are lots of them, they are only now being 
understood. Some are believed to be anti-oxidants, which is why they are 
thought to help in preventing heart disease. The ranking of goodness in 
alcohol is, IIRC from an article in Wine Spectator:
 - Red wine - most help, high in flavenoids
 - Darker beers - good amount of help
 - White wine - pretty much tied with Dark beers
 - Lighter beers - some help
 - Distilled spirits - better than not drinking, it is thought that it is 
the alcohol that provides the protection. (BTW, cholesterol is an alcohol!)


The recommended "doses" are one to two glasses of wine or beer per day. 
Go much over that and there are bad effects. This may be the explanation 
for why heart disease rates are lower in France, where the diet is pretty 
unhealthy by US standards. The latest piece of evidence that helped the 
FDA to come over to recommending moderate alcohol consumption was a long 
term study in Denmark of 10-20K adults that confirmed all this. My guess 
is that the flavenoids would be found in the non-starchy parts of the 
grain. Beers brewed with adjuncts would be lower in them.


That said: Don't drink and drive. Fasten your seat belts. Remember the 
Pueblo!


A question on beer nutrition: I have a need to find out the carbohydrate 
content of beers for dietary reasons. The only one I have found is, alas, 
Miller Lite at 3.2 grams/can. Given that it is 1/3 less tasty, IMHO, than 
regular American Lager, I avoid it. Anyone know of where I can dig out 
this info? Info on Anchor, Red Hook and Celis products would be great.


Latest shot over the bow of small brewers: New billboard in town: A 
sweaty Bud longneck on it's side, with the caption: "Hand crafted at a 
brewery near you." With all due respect to the great job that AB does in 
producing a consistent product on a large scale, I don't really think of 
their brewery on I-10 as "hand crafting" beer in a 15 story plant with 
attached grain silos.

Subject: Floating "sediment" question


Hello to All,


I recently brewed and bottled my first beer (Bohemian Pilsner) with a 
friend that is quite experienced in the art of homebrewing.  After a week 
or so of letting the beer carbonate at room temperature, I decided to take 
a look at a bottle to note any activity (clearing up and sediment 
formation).  To my surprise, I found a bottle that had a thick, flowing 
object that was about 4-5 inches long and 1/2-1 inches wide floating in the 
center of my bottle.  I asked two other brewers about this phenomenon, but 
they had never heard of this nor could tell me why this happened.  After 
looking at other bottles and noticing a strong blanket of sediment, I 
thought something went on in that bottle that simply make the blanket float 
up and stand elongated.  


Is this a common occurrence?  If so, why does this happen?  Is it an 
indication that something may be wrong with that particular bottle of beer, 
like contamination?


By the way, I popped open my first bottle last night and was very pleased 
with my first creation.  Perfect color, carbonation, and hoppiness.


Happy Brewing,
Mike

A freind and I have been brewing Oktoberfests and Bocks for a year now.  
We have been fairly succesful with our efforts and even won a first place 
last weekend with our Dopple Bock.  We feel and the judges agree that the 
flavor profile is correct. What we are lacking is that wonderful 
malt/carmel aroma you find with the imported versions.


Does anyone have any suggestions as to how we can improve and intensify

<I think step mashing would be beneficial, given the large amount of
<unmalted barley and oats.  Was your sparge really sluggish?  Try a rest at
<about 140F.  This would help break down beta-glucans and excess protein.


The adjuncts are flaked products.  The base malt is highly modified
British Pale Ale malt.  Beta glucanase, which acts on beta glucans,
is active in a narrow band around 104F (40C).  Beta glucanase is mainly
active during malting and little to none survives in British Pale Ale malt.
(lager malts on the other hand do retain beta glucanase after kilning).
A rest above 135F will do little to change the protein composition of
the wort, particularly with pale ale malt.  This means that a rest at
140F will do little to alter either the glucan or protein composition
of the wort.


As for the necessity of a beta glucan rest when mashing flaked 
adjuncts, I just did two pilot brews using 25% flaked barley.  The
first employed the 40/50/60/70 schedule and the second a simpler
60/70 program.  Both worts lautered easily and the apparent degree
of attenuation in both cases was very close.  The total grist was
low with a target OG of 10P but with a well designed lauter tun using
a perf sheet bottom this should be possible with OGs in the 16P 
range at least.  Tasting the results I can say conclusively that
flaked barley is a fantastic addition to a stout recipe.


As for the rest of the recipe, Id eliminate the black malt and
reduce the chocolate malt to 1/8 lb.  I generally hate black malt
for anything other than coloring purposes.  YMMV.

US Dextrin malt, often called carapils malt is distinctly different from
the German caraHell or the Belgium caraPils malts.  The US versions will
break your tooth if bitten while the continental counterparts are indeed
very light caramel malts.  The glassy interior of the US version is
a different beast and another malt I tend to avoid at all costs.

  Judging in a competition is done "blind", i.e., the judges are not supposed
to know the identity of the brewer. Swing-top bottles are considered to be
sufficiently "unique" so as to provide a possible clue to the brewer's 
identity. The same reasoning is applied to bottles with raised lettering, and
bottle caps that have not been "blacked out".
  This does vary from competition to competition, it's really up to the
organizer. I've judged at competitions that did not require that the caps be
blacked out, since the stewards were pouring and bringing the beer to the
judging table in pitchers. I've also seen competitions advertised that had no
restrictions on bottles, swing-tops, raised lettering, etc., was OK.
  So, you can either look for competitions that are more relaxed in this 
regard, or pick up a few standard bottles. Most competitions require only 3
per entry.

Sure. Rather than guess what is going on, use your hydrometer. Wait a day or
so, then take another reading. If it's still ~1.008, the beer is done, go
ahead and bottle. If the SG dropped more than a point or two, wait two days,
then take another reading. When you get two consecutive readings a couple of 
days apart that are about the same, fermentation is done. I'm inclined to
think it's done at 1.008 though.

Hello, gang.  Could those of you who've tried Sam Adams' Cream Stout 
recently comment on its diacetyl content?  I remembered it being much less 
noticeable in the Midwest than it is here in the Northwest.  A local brewer 
friend who just moved here from Boston says it's a lot better on the East 
Coast, and that the likely cause is variations between the breweries they 
contract.  Anybody noticed this?  Is this a plausible explanation?


Just curious,
Bob Grabhorn

Subject: Chill Haze


Esteemed Brewers -


My question today concerns chill haze.  I recently brewed a partial extract
kit obtained at my local homebrew store.  It was an Extra Special Bitter
which got bottled on March 1 after a one week primary and a two week
secondary fermentation.  After about three weeks in the bottle, the beer
tasted great.  The only problem to note was that a distinct haze developed in
the bottles when placed in the refrigerator.  Now, I have noticed that after
the bottles are in the fridge for a certain period of time (a week or so),
the haze goes completely away leaving a beautiful amber, crystal clear brew.


Can anyone shed any light on what's going on here?   TIA.

Subject: Why Some Clear-bottled Beer Does Not Become Lightstruck


        The lightstruck (aka sunstruck, skunky, or import beer) flavor
arises when ultraviolet light from the sun or fluorescent bulbs cleaves the
3-methylbut-2enyl radical from the isohumulone molecule. Isohumulone is
isomerized alpha-acid that is the bittering agent of hops.  The cleaved
radical is then free to react with hydrogen sulfide or other sulfur
containing compounds to form isopentenyl mercaptan, that yummy aroma.


        Some breweries (I believe Miller is one, Samuel Smith, I'm not sure)
can reduce the isohumulone with sodium borohydride to form a secondary
alcohol known as the rho-isohumulones.  This compound is claimed to be less
susceptible to photolysis but also has less bittering power.


        Now that the chemistry lesson is over, let's quaff some fine malt
beverages.

Subject: Possible <gasp> infection?


Folks,


I bottled a bitter a few days ago, and I put a couple in the green 
bottles, just so I could take a peak.  Today, I find that I have some 
things adhearing to the sides of the bottles.  Could this be:


1) The yeast working  to condition the beer, and it will fall out...


2) A possible <shudder> infection in my brew?


As this is the first time I can see THROUGH the beer in the bottle, (I 
like stouts and browns) am I just seeing something that always happens.  
My cleaning was the same as usual, bleach soak & rinse, but I had to 
bottle in the basement, because of my 'better half's' friends.  They 
think beer and especialy homebrewing is immoral.  If I didn't want to 
keep peace in the house, I'd down one in fromt of 'em!


Anyway, I just don't know what it is.  Who knows, maybe it will be the 
best batch yet!


Thanks.
