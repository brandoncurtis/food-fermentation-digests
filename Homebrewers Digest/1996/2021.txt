Subject: Rauch beer


I recently (about a month ago) brewed a rauch beer using 7 lbs of smoked
malt, 2 lbs of 2-row and 1 lb of crystal-60.  It was one of the smoothest
brewing sessions I've had since I went all grain about 6 batches ago.  I'm
actually beginning to think I have this thing figured out!


My question is this:  The beer has been in the bottle for about two weeks and
been conditioning at basement temps (65F).  When put into the fridge for a
couple of hours, it develops a real cloudiness.  It doesn't look like the
standard "chill haze" and I was wondering if this is a characteristic of
rauch beers?  The beer tastes great and has a great smokey flavor--went real
well with the bbq'd chicken last night!


Any comments from rauch beer brewers would be appreciated.

Subject: Mugworts and other 'worts


I've read, in a variety of places, that the herb known as Mugwort was used,
in ancient times, to flavor beverages, notably BEER.


I see also in the herbal seed catalogs another plant with the same ending,
St John's Wort.


If anyone's used either of these, how'd it work out? Any comments/ advice/
warnings/ recipes?

        Anyway, if I remember my optical crystallography correctly,
glass is UV opaque.  I remember that a UV prospecting device had to have
quartz glass window for that reason.  I always kinda thought that it was
the warmth that skunked beer??

I recently brewed up a batch of palidia IPA. The wort was to thick to 
strain into the fermenter so poured in the spent hops along with it.
After a week of bottle age I tried one for carbonation and taste. It 
was horrible: very bitter with off-flavors. Will these efects decay 
with age?

Subject: ball/pin locks




I use both and thought I'd chime in and agree wholeheartedly with Brian's
answer concerning ball-locks. The bleed valve on top is the difference.
If you can get a keg with one, do it. It is a must. Since there's really
no other differences (assuming keg shape/size isn't an issue with your fridge),
there's no question ball-lock with a bleed valve is what you want.
Happy kegging. Oh, and make sure you find a nice FREE tap handle from a
friendly neighborhood bar owner or distributor. I asked for a cool Oriole
handle at Camden Yards and they said 'sure, they're 50 bucks'!  I don't think
so...I'll stick with my Hacker-Pschorr handle I got for free (all legal, too).

Continuing Clarks posting of tap handle leads....                               


What Clark left off the end of my comment about making your own                 
was how to make them!  The "bolt" on the top of your beer faucet                
is a 3/8-16 thread, so go to a woodworking store and buy some                   
3/8-16" brass threaded wood inserts.  If you're handy with a                    
drill, you can turn lots of things into tap handles.  Bowling pins,             
the ends of a ski handle, corved wooden tiki-gods, etc.....                     


Use your imagination and experiment, lets get away from those little            
black plastic knobs (yawn!) I discovered that a set of old fireplace            
tools my alewife was about to pitch had some very ornate oak/brass              
handles.......which were threaded to the brass tools..........which             
were also 3.8-16 size thread!   Voila!  a set of 4 matching oak/brass           
tops!                                                                           


Find a friend who is a wood worker and have a paddle shaped tapper made         
up with a big enough area to put your own homebrewery logo or unique            
beer logo on.                                                                   


Most of all, if you are creative enough to be homebrewin, well then you         
are definitely creative enough to find someting to stick a 3/8-16 insert        
into!  ;-)   (no punchline there, sheesh!)                                      


I also got a copy of that Golden Lion Pub catalog, neat catalog, only           
3-4 tap handles though.  Although one of them was a mahogany beer bottle        
with cap so you could affix your own label to ($40?).  This should be easy      
enough turn on a lathe, hmmmmm.                                                 


Just had some brain farts (Oh I'm on a roll now!)  Golf clubs & ski poles       
could be cut to size and plugged/epoxied with a large wood dowel, then the      
insert could be put in, voila!  Sports taps, hey baseball bats/hockey           
sticks/Tennis rackets  (well, the top 8" or so anyways!)                        


Gotta go before I start getting silly, oops, too late!

Greetings all!  Just curious what other clubs are doing for                     
National Homebrewers Day (May 4th!  AND HEY, when is Hallmark                   
or Shoebox gonna recognize the potential for marketing this                     
great holiday!  ;-)                                                             


We have for the last couple of years done brewing demo's at a                   
homebrew supply shop, parking lot brews.  We set up a pico                      
system and a burner/boilpot for extract brewing.  This year                     
we have actually expanded to doing this demo at 3, yes 3!                       
(oooohhhhhhh I'm just so proud of my people) different                          
locations on this upcoming "better be sunny" holiday.                           


We have talked about getting the whole club together and everyone               
bringing brewing eqpt. to see how many gallons we could brew but                
I think one of the Alaskan clubs has a pretty good lock on that record.         


The suppliers donate the ingredients and we provide the entertainment           
and education for the day.  It's a great way to get the public involved         
and educated on the brewing process.  A lot of people have a pre-               
conceived notion that brewing is a really difficult and involved                
process that is best left up to the micros & mega swillers, many                
are pleasently surprised how easy an extract batch is to make.

Subject: Why Avoid US Dextrin Malt ?




I have been following the Dextrin/carapils malt discussion recently with 
interest since I have a batch in the fermenter which included 1/2lb in a 
3gal batch which was included at the start of the mash.  Most of the 
discussion was consistent with what I have read, but the following post 
caught my interest:


>From: Jim Busch <busch`at`eosdev2.gsfc.nasa.gov>
>US Dextrin malt, often called carapils malt is distinctly different from
>the German caraHell or the Belgium caraPils malts.  The US versions will

>very light caramel malts.  The glassy interior of the US version is
>a different beast and another malt I tend to avoid at all costs.


I did notice the glassy interior and the fact it was very hard when I tasted 
it (tiny jaw breakers). Jim, why do you  avoid the US version at all costs? 
What other malts do you tend to avoid and why?

        It all started with Arts question in HBD #2017:


   >Is there some other way to use the carbonator to charge these 2 liter
   >bottles with CO2, or some other simple, cheap way to charge these
   >bottles homebrew to be gifts for friends?


   Mark wrote a letter to me in reguards to my post to Al's question.  It
   turns out that he has been using the Carbonator for some time just as I
   described on  HBD #2019.  He also included a few additional tips that I
   thought I should share with everyone. (He said to try it with koolaid,
   the nieces and nephews will love this one!)


   From Mark's letter:


   >I mix the ingredients right in a 2L PET bottle, and carbonate as you

   >attention to verify that it does.  Works good with Koolaid too :)


   Another possibility is described by Mike Urseth in HBD #2018:


   >Another alternative that I've heard (but not tried myself) is to get
   >some Schrader valves (tire valve stems) from your local auto supply
   >store. Drill a hole in the PET bottle cap (about 3/8" - measure

   >CO2 line and go from there. Cost should be less than a buck a piece.
   >Not as slick as the commercial unit, but the price is right.


        I made one of these.  I haven't tried it yet since I am still
   making the CO2 line with tire fitting on the end.  It looks like it
   should work great, and they are cheap to make.  I paid $1.40 for two

     I get what might be the same during the early days after bottling when 
     carbonation occurs - it happens regularly, and tends to disappear over 
     time. I believe it is just little CO2 bubbles that adheres to minor 
     irregularities on the insides of the bottles, perhaps supplemented by 
     being covered with a touch of sediment starting to come out.
     
     
     In other news, I'm presently working in Geneva, and saw this Bud ad on

Subject: autolysis


   I recently tasted a beer that had spent *eleven* months in the primary
(glass) at room temperature, probably reaching at least 80F at some point last
summer, with its full complement of yeast (one packet of Yeast Lab Amsterdam
Lager; it was arguably underpitched).  Aside from a decided lack of hop
character, the beer was pretty good.  This got me to wondering; is autolysis
oversold as a brewing danger, or was this a freak occurrence?  Miller and
Papazian are both fairly nebulous as to circumstances under which autolysis will
actually take place.  Any similar experiences?  Has there been much research on
autolysis?  How the heck do you pronounce it?  :-)


  Pardon the bandwidth, but before I started kegging I had way too many bottles.
Now that number is verging on the pathological.  I've got 5 excess cases of Sam
Adams bottles and 12 of Steinlager bottles (yes, I know they're green, but you
can't leave brown bottles in the sun either.  I've never had a skunky one yet,
and pale beers look gorgeous in them).  If anyone in the Denver area is
interested, please e-mail.  They're all clean, label-free, in 6-pack sleeves in

I have enjoyed the mix of applied science and bold adventures that the list
has provided.  My first post - a request.....
 
I am a new grain brewer and would like to double my batch size to 10 gal to
create enough brew to satisfy the more discriminating guests at my sister's
wedding.  I use a 6 gal bucket/phalse bottom system.  My kettle can handle 14
gal so that's not a problem.  I figure I will split the wort into two carboys
and pitch two different strains of yeast for a little variety.
 
The questions:
     Does anyone have a tried and true 10 gal recipe that is widely
pleasing?  I was thinking in terms of a Brown Ale (which could be close to a
dunkle with lager yeast in the other carboy.)
     How much grain can my 6 gal lautering system handle?  I'm happy to
augment with extract.
     Any sage advise in approaching this endeavor would be appreciated!

Subject: What Fools We Mortals Be


I know I'm using up all my free tech support on beginner
questions, but there are some things I just gotta know.  This
became evident this past weekend as I was brewing a porter, which
was also my second time using specialty grains.  I ended up
naming this brew "Apocalytic Porter."


My wife had been sick since Thursday with an ever worsening
cold/flu.  I decided to do some quiet brewing at about 6:30 A.M.
on Saturday so she could sleep in.  I crushed 1 lb. of black
patent and 1/2 lb. of crystal and put them on to steep.  The
house filled with the (what I though of as) great smell of
'Maltex' (TM) cereal.  As I was removing the grains before adding
the extract, I heard the pitter patter of little feet running to
the bathroom followed by the sound of retching.  After the sounds
of brushing and gargling, my wife walked into the kitchen looking
rather pale and informed me that if I ever made anything that
smelled that foul again, I could brew my next batch in my tent in
the back yard, because that was where I would be living.  Her
exact words were, "I don't think there is a worse smell than that
STUFF!"


I kissed her on the forhead, wiped some drool from the corner of
her mouth and gently pushed her back into the bedroom so she
could get some much needed rest.  I then resumed brewing, adding
the hop pellets and extract syrup.  I got a really good rolling
boil going.  Armed with the knowledge that I *NEVER* had a
boilover, I started doing some of my saturday morning chores such
as sorting my recylcables.  Now I have to say that I tried
improving my hops utilization with this batch.  In the past I
used hop bags, sewn coffee filters, and cheesecloth wraps to
contain my hops pellets and never got good bittering or flavor. 
This time I just threw 2 oz. of Northern Brewer pellets into the
pot.  To say that I was surprised as I looked up and saw froth
bubbling out of the pot would be an understatement.  I ran to the
stove, grabbed the pot and swung it over to the sink.  The wort
that had run down the side of the pot fell onto the (electric)
stove's red hot burner and filled the kitchen with quite a bit of
smoke.  As I was cleaning this up, I looked up to see my wife in
the doorway with a wisp of hair hanging across her face.  "Thanks
for proving me wrong!", was her only comment before trundling
back into bed.


*QUESION 1* Since this wsa my first boilover, and the first time
my hop pellets weren't contained in any sort of bag, is there a
relationship here?


After cleaning up the stove, I put the (now partially cooled)
wort back onto the burner and brought it back to boil.  The boil
seemed very good, staying where it should in the pot and all.  I
figured everything was fine at last, and went back to my
recylcing.  What happened next can only be descibed as biblical
in proportion.  If I thought the boilover I had before was
impressive, I was mistaken.  It looked like all of my wort was
attempting a mass escape (bear in mind, I started with 8 quarts
in a 20 quart SS pot).  This boilover reminded me of a science
fiction movies I saw in the late 50's or early 60's called 'The
Blob'.  I again raced to the stove and moved my pot into the
sink.  When I looked back at the stove, I had flames jumping 8"
off the burner!  I put my face next to the burner and started
blowing the flames out, the kitchen was full of black smoke, and
standing like a wraith from the pits of hell, my wife stared at
me with slitted eyes and said, "we'll talk later!"  She then went
back to bed, closing the bedroom door behind her.


*QUESTION 2*  Is my domestic harmony ruined?


Although I strained my wort as well as I could though cheeselcoth
and a seive, quite a bit of the hop pellet particles made it into
the fermentor.  This brew is fermenting *STRONGLY*!  I checked on
it this morning, and found my airlock lying on top of my white
plastic fermentor's lid, full of brown liquid.  It's tube was
plugged with hop particles.  There was kreu....kraeu...brown
foamy s**t bubbling out of the small hole in the lid, down the
side of the fermentor and all over the carpeting of the spare
bedroom I use for fermenting.  I cleaned out the airlock, put
fresh water in it and stuck it back in the lid. Amazing amount of
CO2 just blowing out of the lock.


*QUESTION 3*  Anything special I should use to remove beer
stains/odor from the bedroom carpet before my wife finds out?  I
plan on trying some of that RESOLVE (tm) stuff tonight when I get
home.


*QUESTION 4* What is the 'correct' way to use hop pellets?  It's
all my homebrew supply shop carries, so I don't have options. 
Whenever I try 'bagging' them, they just float around in my pot
in a solid brick like mass (amazing how much they swell up).  My
beers have been too sweet (insufficient bittering), and I haven't
been able to get any hop aroma.  Throwing them in the pot loose
seems way too messy (and potentialy dangerous if they contribute
to boilover).


All in all, this is proving to be quite a fun hobby.

This may sound like a stupid question but here goes...


Can anyone tell me what are the advantages of RIMS versus single or step 
infusion mash schedules are ? I think the main benefit is more uniform 
and possibly more accurate mash temps in the mash tun ? I personally find 
it difficult to single step infusion mash at a constant/uniform 
temperature. I always stir the grains but my thermometer reads higher in 
the middle of my tun (igloo cooler) than on the sides and there is a 
temperature gradient from top to bottom. I suppose this kind of problem 
is eliminated using RIMS ? Anyone, anyone.....

Greetings Collective!


Now officially off 'lurk' status, I'd like to share my experience with
you about last nite.  Last nite, I attended a beer tasting at the 
Anheuser Busch Brewery in St. Louis, which I was invited to by some
unknown mailing list affiliation.  The brewery was introducing three
beers made from recipes that dated back to the turn of the century
from when Adolphus Busch was running their show.  The three beers,
(Faust, Muenchener, and a Black&Tan) are described below for those
interested in what I experienced (save the flames and page down
if you don't care to hear this... I KNOW htis is a forum for 
HOME brewing...)


One more disclaimer: I am by no means a registered/professional beer taster,
just an avid micro/homebrew conoseur (sp?).


Faust Lager: A golden, light colored beer with full flavor (for a 
light beer) which IMHO, would be a beer that I would drink from time
to time. Overall, good head retention, good flavor, but I'm not sure
I would buy it based on my microbrew-induced prejudice towards
Megaswill brews.


Black&Tan: The first I have ever seen through the glass (B&T). The
flavor was 'unfinished' in a sense, as the pre-consumption esters
didn't match up too well with the after-taste (make sense?). The
initial aroma indicated a smooth drink, but after tasting the beer,
I had a bitter, crusty tastee in my mouth. Won't be buying that one.:P


and finally,
Muenchener: I wasn't sure what style or taste to expect from this beer,
but I was pleasantly suprised by the taste of this beer. It had a 
full (yeah, full for Megaswill) taste that was actually pretty good.
It was a dark amber with a smooth taste and a nice balance of malt
and hop flavors (did I say that?). Overall very good (even for...)


Just thought I'd pass this on, since this seems to be an obvious attempt
by the big boy to pass off a micro-styled brew.  All in all, it was
enjoyed by most there, including some homebrewers that I attended with.


Please be gentle with the flames, talking about the big guns of brewing.
I just thought some might enjoy hearing about some new beer that
may/may not end up on the local shelves. 


Thanks to the collective for all the great info, as I hope to start 
my first batch within the month! <fingers crossed!>

Yes, but it does not have to be ultraviolet... in fact very little
ultraviolet light makes it through glass.  Through a process called
non-radiative energy transfer, visible light (in some places it says
green and below, in other places I've read that it is light in a
narrower range, somewhere around blue-green) reacts with what is called
a sensitizer (believed to be riboflavin in this particular reaction --
the skunking of beer) and then transfers this energy to the isohumulone.


Indeed, Miller Brewing Co. uses treated hop extracts.  Tadcaster Brewery
(Samuel Smith's) and the makers of Newcastle Brown Ale (another beer bottled
in clear glass) do not.

Hello,
    I have some interesting information about Carapils/Dextrine malt.  
First, to clear up any confusion, Carapils and Dextrine malt are one in 
the same.  Carapils is the trademarked name of Dextrine malt.  Dextrine 
malt contains a high percentage of dextrins which are unfermentable by 
the malt enzymes, alpha and beta amylase.  No matter how long or at 
what temperatures the Dextrine malt sits in the mash tun, little or no 
breakdown will occur.
    This malt is made by a complex process that is proprietary to the 
Briess Malting Company.  When I talked to a spokeperson for Briess I 
was told that the process was a secret but that it is completely 
different from the production of crystal/caramel malts.  I was also 
told it is 18% soluble in water, meaning the extract brewer would only 
realize 18% of the malts potential.  To fully utilize the benefits, you 
need to mash it with a good percentage of enzyme bearing 2-row or 6-row 
malt.
    What the enzymes do to effectively 'release' the dextrin chains 
from the malt witout breaking them down I do not know.  Perhaps there 
is a partial breakdown.  I'm sure it would be appreciated by all if 
someone with a greater understanding of these processes can answer this 
question.  I do know that Carapils does not add any flavor or color.  
The benefits, as expressed to me by the Briess spokesperson, are 
increased body/mouthfeel, increased head retention, and some 
anti-oxidation properties.
    Extract brewers are recommended to use dextrin powder in place of 
Carapils.  The spelling *Dextrine* with an e is how Briess spells it... 
and since this is their proprietary malt who am I to argue.  
    In conclusion, no the dextrins do not get broken down to simpler 
sugars(because of their structure).  Carapils/Dextrine malt should not 
be treated as lighter version of crystal because the types of sugars 
within the malt are completely different.  Taste Carapils and 
crystal... Carapils is not sweet at all.


Anyways, gotta run...4 very active taps and tons of thirsty friends....

kits that use cane sugar, water and 2 oz. of flavoring, plus a minute 
quantity of champagne yeast.  (Homebrew stores and mail-order supply 
the soda flavoring.)  They have come out too fizzy, not very tasty, and 
for the work involved I'd rather drink cheap commercial soda (which I 
don't).

In hbd 2020 Jim Busch mentioned that he tends to avoid US carapils malt.  
Why? Does it have something to do with mashing?  He mentioned only that 
it will break your tooth if bitten.
The only reason I ask is because I recently used US carapils for the 
first time, hoping to add some extra body (or "mouthfeel") to a dark
ale.  Since I'm an extract brewer and use grains for flavor only, will
US carapils suffice or am I better off using Belgian or German
varieties?  Also, how much should be used?


Trying to create an ale somewhat on the lighter side of a porter, here's
the recipe if anyone wants to comment-


                Lord Stanley Dark Ale 


                6 # light malt extract syrup 
                1+ # NW Gold dry malt extract
                8 oz crystal (60 L.)
                8 oz carapils
                4 oz chocolate malt
                2 oz roasted malt
                1 oz perle pellets (boil)
                .5 oz cascade pellets (boil)
                .5 oz cascade (flavor)
                1 oz williamette (Aroma)
                2 tsp gypsum
                Wyeast American Ale II
                O.G 1.045


I'll probably be able to answer these questions myself once I taste the 
finished product (It's still in the secondary), but I felt like finally 
posting something. TIA and for all your previous knowledge.

Hi, folks.  Hey, I've been at this since mid-February.  I've brewed 8 
batches now, two of which were all-grain.  I'm very happy with my results, 
and am definitely getting better with each batch.


This summer, I'd like to scale back my brewing severely to devote more time 
to my gardening and other outdoor hobbies.  But I don't think I can 
completely drag myself away from brewing.  So here's what I'd like to do 
during the summer.


I'd like to get a better handle on the real effects of different specialty 
malts and hops.  I was thinking I'd do several one-gallon batches, all made 
almost entirely from pale malt.  The variation would be a handful of a 
different specialty grain or different hop in each.


Here are my questions:


Does this seem like a worthwhile experiment?


Should I use pale malt, or would I do just as well to use extract?


What's a good quantity for the "handful" of specialty grains?


What's a good (ale, please) yeast to use so that I'll taste the differences 
in specialty grains, without spending $4 on a Wyeast pack for each batch?


How long should I mash, boil, etc. for a one-gallon batch?




Thanks everyone!


                                Bob Grabhorn
