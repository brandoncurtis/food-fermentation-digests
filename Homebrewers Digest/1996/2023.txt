Subject: Boilovers.


Hello all.


I unintentionally conducted a wholly unscientific test today during my boil.


Previously, in my brewing process I had come to expect the hazard of
boilovers.
And accordingly, watched my brewpot carefully.


With this latest recipe, I used a different brand of malt extract,  Northwest
verses
the previous M & F.


Also I added burton water salts at the beginning of the boil.


And throughout the boil, it didn't even TRY to boil over?


This circumstance leaves me happily puzzled.


All other aspects of the recipe were the same as in previous boils.


Perhaps my water is too soft, and I have "cured" it?


(My water hardness is 15 grains).


Anyway, thanks for adding my rambling observations to the collective.

Subject: Labels


This is a question for all you beer lovers and label makers,


I love to dink around with my current desktop publishing program (Publish 
It) but it is for dos and has a tendency to crash now and again.  It's a 
great program, but I can't just cut and past like I can in Windows, or 
use all my groovy TT Fonts from Windows.  So, does anyone know of a great 
windows based program that is suitable for making labels?  


Thanks in advance,


Dave

From: hollen`at`vigra.com
Subject: RIMS Temp Gradients




This is a followup on temperature measurement of the grain bed in a
RIMS system.  Earlier, I measured the temp in many places in the grain
bed and reported that it did not differ by more than 1 degree.  While
that is still the case, I did my previous measurements after the
grain bed had stabilized temperature, about 1/2 hour into the mash.
Today, I placed the probe in the mash while the boost was occurring
and found a very interesting data point.


Understand that the probe for the temp controller is on the input side
of the heater chamber and the probe for my digital thermometer is on
the output side.  The controller is set to cause the output side to
read correctly to the desired set point.  I had always assumed that if
I wanted a 150F mash bed, set the output of the heater to 150F and
*some time* later, the mash bed would come to equilibrium with the
heater chamber outflow temp.  I never know how long this would take.


My observations today show that it takes about 15 minutes with the
controller set at the setpoint.  When the controller backed off the
heater, the mash bed was about 4 degrees behind.  Since the
differential between the wort temp and the grain bed was small, and
getting smaller, the grain bed came up slowly to the setpoint.


This leads to the following suggestion which I still will have to
prove in practice, it is still a theory.  If you want the temp to
stabilize sooner, run the setpoint about 4 degrees above what you
want, then when it reaches it, turn it down 4 degrees to your actual
temp.  This should hit the setpoint in the grainbed sooner.  Of
course, without measurements, I do not know what "sooner" is.


The ideal arrangement would be to have the temp controller's sensor
actually in the mash, but this would tend to get dicey if you were
trying to mash at the high end of the enzyme range because the heater
would put out much hotter wort than the end setpoint for about 10 to
15 minutes and you could denature the enzymes while reaching the
setpoint in the grain bed.


Another method would be to leave the sensor in the heater chamber, set
to the exact set point, take measurements on *your* system so that you
know the lag time and just not start timing the mash until setpoint
reached plus lag time.


Any comments on my logic, or other measurement experiences?

Subject: Pump Cavitation and Flow Rates




I have been exchanging Email with a couple of people about pump
cavitation and flow rates and said that I would test my system out and
report.  Seemed useful to a lot of people, so I am posting.


First issue is whether my Little Giant 5-MD-SC pump cavitated when
starved on the input side.  Answer is yes.  When I close the valve on
my mash tun outlet to the pump, the "sandy, gritty" sound occurs.


Next question was what my flow rates are like.  I was able to measure
the flow rate with no grain, just recirculating my mash water.  It was
4GPM.  I just switched to the latest issue of the Phil's Phalse Bottom
which has a much more open percentage than the one that I bought 3
years ago.  When a grain bed of 14.5# is in, I have a rate of about
3GPM.  I do have problems with slow flow rate (almost nil) when I get
up to 18#, but that is with the old PPB.  I will report flow rates for
the new PPB with 18# when I brew my Belgian Strong Ale in two weeks.
I strongly suspect that more open area will alleviate the problem.

Subject: Dry hop scum?


Greetings to all,


I dry-hopped an ESB one week ago Sunday. After about four days, a white 
"skin" has formed atop my beer. It is fairly heavy, but is not fuzzy and 
has not changed in appearance in several days. As this my first dry-hop, 
should I be concerned? It looks really gross. I have not tasted the beer 
for off flavors. 


BTW, I used 1/2 oz. Fuggles pellets, just dumped into the secondary.


TIA

Subject: Lager fermentation is too SLOW???




Hi,


I'm brewing my first lager, a Helles Municher from the Papazian book, modified 
for all extract.  It has been in the primary fermenter for 2 weeks happily 
bubbling away, in my basement at 52 F (I live in NH).  I used Wyeast Bohemian 
yeast.  Being impatient, and since the foam was starting to subside, I took a 
hydrometer reading 3 days ago and it read 1.042!  Original gravity was 1.058.  
I was panicked, but I relaxed and waited.  Today I took another hydrometer 
reading and got 1.041.  Now I'm bummin'.  Is this the dreaded stuck 
fermentation?  What should I do?  What caused this?  


Two other things of note:  1) I pitched the yeast too warm, about 84F.  2) The 
fermentation is releasing CO2 steadily, even as the foam dies down.  In my 
mushroom style airlock, I get a bubble every 10 seconds.  This has been steady 
for a week.


Any help or comments are much appreciated.

Subject: silymarin: another hangover cure ??


I read in the w/e's newspaper about another "great hangover cure that is all
the rage on the internet": milk thistle.
I have never heard of this stuff, but was interested, as some of you may also 
be.
So I did a search on it and came up with the following information, taken from 
the web page:


http://planetmaggie.pcchcs.saic.com/thistle.html


I have removed most of the text, for brevity.
*************
Milk Thistle, Nature's Liver Protector


Milk Thistle is native to the Kashmir region of India and Pakistan, but it now
flourishes throughout the temperate world. The plant grows from five to ten 
feet tall,and has large prickly leaves and reddish purple flowers with sharp 
spines that resemble artichokes. When despined, milk thistle leaves are edible, 
and some vegetable gardeners cultivate the plant as a substitute for spinach. 
When broken or crushed, the stems and leaves exude a milky white juice, hence 
this herb's common name. 


With the rise of the modern pharmaceutical industry, research of herbal 
medicines declined considerably in the United States. Fortunately, this did 
not happen in Germany, where in 1949, scientists noticed that milk thistle 
seemed to protect animal livers from poisoning from highly toxic carbon 
tetrachloride. In 1968, scientists isolated the three specific liver 
protective molecules in milk thistle -- silibinin, silidianin, and silicristin 
- -- now collectively known as silymarin.


More than 100 studies have confirmed silymarin's liver-protective value. 
Here's a brief overview of what researchers have discovered:


Alcoholic Cirrhosis. A 1989 report in the Journal of Hepatology (the study of 
the liver) described a study involving 170 people with advanced alcoholic 
cirrhosis, an often-fatal condition, and the nation's 11th leading cause of 
death, claiming 25,000 lives each year. The study participants were divided 
into two groups. One received 200 mg of milk thistle extract (140 mg of 
silymarin) three times a day, the other received a medically inactive 
look-alike placebo. Both groups were followed for four years. During that 
time, the death rate in the placebo group was about 60 percent, but among 
those taking silymarin, only 40 percent died, a highly statistically 
significant difference. Other studies have shown that silymarin provides
similar benefits for people suffering cirrhosis.


<snip other studies, including amanita muscaria poisoning, hepatitis, 
gallstones...>


Recently, Scandinavian researchers tested silymarin's effect on livers that 
were stressed but not seriously diseased. They selected 106 consecutive 
patients who had abnormal liver function tests from alcohol, but who did not 
have cirrhosis. Half took silymarin; the other half received a placebo. 
After four weeks, the placebo group showed no change in liver function, but 
the silymarin group showed highly significant improvement, in some cases, 
complete normalization of liver function, despite their alcohol consumption.


Silymarin is available at herb shops and natural food stores.

None of the above is my personal view etc.


Might be worthy of a bit of homebrewers' research, heh? (yeah, I know this 
does not mention hangovers - but the newspaper article I read certainly did).
I'll buy some tablets and try some.
Maybe even add some milk thistle to your next brew? (The silymarin is derived
from the seeds, I believe).

I found another page with abstracts from a variety of scientific papers 
concerning silymarin. Check out,


http://www.thorne.com/silymarin.html


These give a bit more weight (for you scientific types) to the benefits 
of this drug.

Subject: Is this fruity or WHAT?!


I recently brewed and kegged an English Special Bitter style ale using 
Wyeast 1968. The recipe looked like this:
 
6 1/2 lbs. English 2-row
8 oz. Belgian CaraMunich
4 oz. Flaked Wheat
1 1/2 oz. Chocolate
35 IBU's East Kent Goldings + 1 oz Goldings dry-hopped in the keg
OG: 1040  FG: 1.007
Primary fermentation 7 days `at` 68F
No process problems other than a difficult sparge (culprit: the flaked 
wheat?)


As I poured my first glass this afternoon (drum roll), I carefully 
examined the color (clear and appropriately deep amber), the aroma 
(Goldings loud and clear - no diacetyl as I was expecting), and the 
taste (um...what's this?...something I've never tasted in my ales..I 
guess it's..ah.. FRUITY...yes VERY FRUITY!).


I've used Wyeast #1056 exclusively until this batch.  I remember a 
warning from one of you to be ready for something really different when 
using #1968!  The spec sheet for #1968 refers to the taste as MILDLY 
fruity and malty.  The sensations as I drink this brew are: hops aroma, 
followed by immediate in-your-face fruitiness on the roof of the mouth, 
followed by hop bitterness at the back of the tongue. Hardly any malt 
flavors at all.  I'd run this beer by a beer tasting expert if I knew 
one that lived within 100 miles of me!


Questions: Is this what I should expect from 1968?  Since I've never 
tasted an authentic english bitter, and I live far away from anyone that
has (only Budweiser spoken here), I'm relying on Digest experts to say 
"relax and enjoy an authentic bitter" or, "Ritter you screwed up 
somewhere, nothing tastes THAT fruity!".  Is there a commercially 
available special bitter reflecting this level of frutiness that I can 
compare to?
