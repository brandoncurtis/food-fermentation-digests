From: Marty Tippin <martyt`at`sky.net>
Subject: Recirculating RIMS, Nat'l HB Day


In #2024, Chuck Volle asks about recirculating the mash in a RIMS system.
As I posted about a week ago, my system isn't a true RIMS, but I *do*
recirculate during the entire mash.  I've found a much more uniform
temperature distribution and *much* higher yields (like 34+ pts/lb/gal) -
plus there's almost no work involved; aside from stirring every 15 or 20
minutes just for good measure, all I have to do is keep an eye on the pump
and make sure the recirculated liquor is being evenly distributed over the
grainbed (I used a cobbled together manifold to help in this area). 


With regard to oversparging, it's nothing I worry about - I collect about
the same amount of sweet wort in this system as I always did (around 7.25
gals for a 5 gal batch) - so oversparging is no more of an issue here than
elsewhere.  I always make sure the sparge water is around pH 5.7 or so and
right at 168F and haven't had any problems with tannins (at least none that
I could tell).


As for the decoction vs. infusion question, can't say for sure.  But I do
know the one triple decoction I did took about 10 hours from start to finish
and the results weren't noticeably different than my regular infusion
batches, so I'm not inclined to do it again.


Also in #2024, Al Korzonas writes:
>I end up fielding dozens of calls in June and July.  I have to tell these
>people that summer is not the time to brew and do call me in the fall.


int doneRanting = 0;
while (!doneRanting)
{
I guess I don't get it - unless you're a traditional german brewer who's got
crops to tend in the summer, I don't see any reason not to brew all year
around. 


Sure, it's a bit more challenging to get the right fermentation temps in the
summer, but aside from that, there's no reason to discourage people from
brewing whenever they want.  If you've got someone who's interested in
starting, who has *cash* in their pocket, and you tell them "not now," it's
no wonder they don't call back - they probably go to some other store and
get the stuff and have a ball learning to brew - summer or not.   Or else
they decide homebrewing was a stupid idea and don't even bother - either
way, you lose out on some potential business.  


I'm not arguing whether national homebrew day should be in the spring or
fall; it certainly makes more sense in the fall if for no other reason than
tradition.  But the idea that you shouldn't (or can't) brew whenever you
want is a bit silly.

Another bit o' info on autolysis.  Please use this information 
only in a well ventilated area:


In HBD #2024, Al. wrote:


> I, personally, have noted autolysis in very few of my beers.


and in HBD #2022, A.J. says:

In my three years of brewing, I have experienced autolysis only 
once.  After my first couple of batches, I received one of the 
"Beer in a Bag" kits as a gift from someone who thought that 
brewing was an odd pastime and I would appreciate the ease of 
such a kit.  I made the kit up according to the directions, 
and used the packet of dried yeast that came with the brew bag. 
My only deviations from the instructions was when they were 
clearly risking sanitation, and then I set it in a cool place to 
ferment.


After 3-4 weeks, I figured, "What the hey!" and decided to try 
a pint.  As I drew off the first bit, the stench was incredible,
similar to burning rubber, and nearly knocked me to the floor 
because it was so intense.  Unsure of what had gone so horribly 
wrong, I continued to lurk on HBD and learned the basics of 
what autolysis is and smells like. 


I'm sorry that I don't have a preventive nor a cure, but I 
think this qualifies as Another Data Point(tm).

No, because you control the amount of sparge water you use just like
any other all grain system.  Stop when the SG gets low.  Don't
confusion continuous recirculation with sparging, the two are not the
same.  And yes, during the sparge, you can oversparge if you use too
much sparge water.

If you mash out at too high a temp, sure, but stay at 170F or below
and there is no problem.  George Fix did a write up on the BrewMagic
RIMS system and admitted that in the beginning, he had some of the
same concerns, but the system proved them false.  There is no
astringency due to tannin extraction in a properly designed RIMS
system used properly.  Someone who goofs up can get bad beer from any
kind of equipment, so don't count that.

While I am a dyed in the wool proponent of RMS mashing, I am not
kidding myself about it replacing decoction mashing.  Yes, both RIMS
and decoction mashing have similar elements in that they use upward
steps, but that is where the similarity stops.  The enhanced maltiness
occurring with a decoction mash would never be produced by a RIMS mash
because the heavy part of the mash in a decoction is taken out and
*boiled*.  During the boiling, Maillard (sp?) reactions occur that
enhance the malty character due to the high heat used.  In a RIMS
system, all is designed to introduce heat at a very low density and
thus prevent scorching, so the potential for Maillard reactions is
nil.  It sure would be nice if a RIMS system could do decoction
mashes, but it is just a dream.

Subject: Stuck Fermentation




     It seems I have found the dreaded Stucky.  I am brewing a
pseudo-cider and the fermentation has stopped after 3 days.
OG 1.047 and now sits at about 1.030.  I do not believe it is
done>(at least I hope not).  The recipe looks like this:


3 Gal. Aplle juice ( not from COncentrate)
1 lb. X-tra light DME
1 lb. Malto-Dextrin (for the sweetness)
Irish Ale WYeast


Boiled the DME and Malto-Dextrin for 60 min.  Cooled, added to
Apple juice and pitched at 70 deg.


Now there is no activity in the airlock.  What are some suggestions
on getting it going again?  Shake? Addd suppliment? add more yeast?
Hold a ritual in front of the Fermenter wearing all Al Borlin
plaid?(scary)

I didn't know there was an end to the brewing season. Granted summer creates
some challenges for brewers, but we are an ingeneous lot and have come up
with a number of ways to keep the fermenter cool during those times.


Sounds to me like you're turning away a lot of potential business, but it's 
your money.

hi all


i'm heading off to a wedding in scotland in mid- may, and am staying on 
after for about 10 days.  i'd appreciate any tips on a) good brewery tours, 
b) good local pubs and/or c) enjoyable distillery tours.  (if anyone has 
some insights into - gasp -  non-barley related fun, i'll take that too  ;-) 
 i've been searching the net for information, but haven't really found 
anything outside the big cities.  we're planning on spending most of our 
time in the highlands (i know, most scottish brewing activity is in the 
south), but will likely be able to get to anyplace we put our minds to . . . 
 it's unlikely we'll get down to england (going there in july . . . ). 
 email preferred.


thanks

When my wife began nursing our first, she had problems associated with stress.
Doctor *recomended* a beer 15-30 minutes before to "help calm you both down".
Worked great.  Kid is now 21.  Beer still calms mom, almost daily.

Are you SERIOUS?!? C'mon, Al! This is the 20th century! The brewing 
season is when YOU want it to be! We are not hostages of nature as 
were our ancestors - we all have the ability to control our 
environments to varying degrees.


I agree that those living in apartments without air-conditioning, or 
in houses with out basements should, perhaps, be discouraged from 
brewing in the summer - but only after explaining how one can control 
temperature through such high-tech means as wrapping the fermenter in 
a tee-shirt, and standing it in a pan of water. Perhaps upping the 
technology ante by directing a fan at it...


As a homebrew supplier, if your opinion of brewing seasonallity was
upheld, how would you expect your business to support itself? Ever
consider that the calls that you don't get back in the fall are
because the requester called someone else, and is now happily
brewing away - disgruntled at that first yahoo who said they should
wait until fall?


Al, Al, Al! I'm truly surprised at you. The AHA probably thinks 
you're a putz!


As for having National Homebrew Day in the fall, a billion million 
college students might disagree with you. So, why not have two? :-)

First of all, just cooling 15 gallons of wort outside is unlikely to be
quick enough unless you live above the arctic circle.  You should use
some kind of force-cooling like an immersion or counterflow wort chiller.


Regarding dry ice for cooling wort, I recommend against it (as well as
other uses of dry ice with brewing) if for no other reason that we don't
know how much wild yeast or bacteria may be trapped in the ice.  Recently,
we have also read that the dry ice may contain oil which would ruin head
retention.  There may be other reasons (I've long since buried my Thermo
books), but for my money, the risk of infection and oil are enough to
avoid dry ice.

I have not seen the book yet, but either you are oversimplifying their
discussion of decoction mashing or they do not understand the issues
involved.  It is true that with modern, well-modified malts, you do not
need to use a decoction mash to get decent extract yield but with these
grains you don't even need a temperature-stepped mash either.


Furthermore, I am of the opinion that decoction mashing does a lot more
for the flavour than it does for extract yield (**especially** with modern
malts).  The temperatures in the main mash may be the same, but the resulting
beer flavours are not the same.  Decoction mashing adds a type of toasty
flavour I have been unable to get with step mashes.

Sorry Woody... you've got big problems.  First of all, that 1.5 oz of
Chinook, assuming a 5-gallon batch size and a generous 30% utilization
(*before* accounting for the high-gravity wort) will give you only about
28 IBUs.  That's probably about 1/4 of what you should have used.  The
high-gravity of the wort means you only got a fraction of that 30%.


Secondly, for such a high-gravity beer, a 250ml starter is 1/8th to 1/16th
of what you should have used.


Thirdly, with this amount of fermentables, it is likely that your yeast
will generate quite a bit of heat and may raise the temperature a good
10F.  If it is practical, you may want to slowly reduce the ambient
temperature (say, move it to a cooler part of the cellar, for example)
as the fermentation kicks in.  Tossing it into a regular fridge is
right out -- a sudden temperature drop is a shock to these yeast and
given the amount of work they will have to do for you, you had better
be kind to them.  The warmer the fermentation the esterier the beer
will be and the more higher alcohols you will make -- these will take
longer to mellow-out.


You did not mention aeration.  This is most crucial for high-gravity
beers.  Without pure oxygen, you probably can't get enough oxygen
dissoved into this syrup for the yeast to deal with the alcohol levels
they are expected to tolerate.  Dry yeast need less oxygen so you
may be able to save yourself with the champagne yeast you plan to add
later.


>My plan is to let it
>sit in the primary about two weeks, rack to the secondary and add
>champagne yeast for about another two weeks before bottling.


If your yeast get down to *1.065* in four weeks, you'll be blessed and
that's only 50% apparent attenuation.  75% apparent attenuation means
an FG of 1.033 which would require 13% alcohol tolerance (a feat even
for Champagne yeast).  You may not get below 1.050 FG.  My 1.120 Imperial
Stout stopped at 1.050.

You should go to the HB supply store, buy yourself a 6 gallon carboy,
a 1 1/4" OD blowoff hose, and some isomerized hop extract.  After
the primary yeast expire, transfer the beer into the glass secondary,
rehydrate two or three packages of Champagne yeast in 90-110F sterile
water and pitch that.  You may have to wait a good six months for this
to finish.  At that point in time, bitter to taste with the hop extrct,
borrow a kegging system and a counter-pressure bottle filler and
CPB-fill this batch.  It may be drinkable in a year, but will take
more than two years to taste good.  I seriously doubt that it will
carbonate in bottles.


Also, it is not oxygenation that you worry about in plastic fementers
but rather oxidation.

        I used to use the two plastic bucket, homemade lauter tun as well.
   I made some decent beers with it, it was a simple and inexpensive way to
   move into the all-grain level.


        I would advise sanding off the labels.  The adhesives and dyes
   could be leached into the beer by the hot, acidic mash that will be put
   into it.  I have not done studies on this or anything, but sanding them
   off can't hurt.  As far as having scratches left behind for bacteria to
   hide - don't worry about it.  Just keep them clean when not using them
   to prevent an excessive amount of bacteria from living.  This is not
   much of a concern for a lauter tun because after transfering the beer to
   the boiling kettle, you are going to boil the snot out of it for awhile
   anyway.  The scratches in your plastic buckets are only a concern if you
   are using them as primary fermenters.  To be honest, I use my plastic
   buckets as  primary fermentors all of the time, even though they do have
   some scratches. I just allow them to be in contact with iodophor
   solution for about a half-hour or so.  I make good yeast starters, so
   the small amount of bacteria remaining doesn't have much of a chance
   with the big initial yeast population.  I have had no problems so far.

Uuuuuuuuh, let's see... how do I put this... You underpitched, underhopped,
and used the "wrong" yeast (if you want a barleywine) :*) <-- (note
good-natured smiley, signifying that this is not a flame, just some friendly
ribbing). I have brewed a grand total of one (1) barlewine, so I consider
myself an expert on the subject - so don't you professional brewers in Chico
try to correct me, dagnabbit! 


Here's one way to pitch enough yeast: Brew a big IPA. Not a wimpy AHA IPA, a
_real_ one, say around 1075 (I made Delano DuGarm's Columbian IPA recipe
from this digest a few months back). Save the yeast cake from the primary (I
got about 1/3 gallon of slurry, which I saved in a gallon glass jug). Make
the mother-of-all-starters a day or two before you brew your barleywine
(decant any liquid of the slurry, add ~1080-ish wort, and aerate like hell).
Stand back.
When I made my starter, the thing was a friggin' volcano. It was frothing
outta the airlock in _less than an hour_!! I had to put my gallon jug in a
sink in the basement, there was no containing it. It was really cool to
watch. Anyway, it fermented my 1105 barleywine down to 1020 in about two
weeks. BTW, this was good ol 1056. Maybe the champagne yeast will be able to
chomp your FG down a bit. 


You probably shoulda used more hops. OK, a lot more hops. I ran this thru
Tinseth's hop claculator and got somthing like 38 IBU's. It'll be malty, to
say the least.


Lastly, if you used Belgain Abbey (Wyeast 1214), expect to wait a while
(months and months) for it to be drinkable (in Mister Rogers voice: can you
say banana?, I thought you could). Maybe just a personal preference, but I
found this yeast Nasty with a capital "N".


That's it. (Hey, You asked for advice!)


Good luck,

Hello All!
         After months of research and development, here is the oft requested
and seldom (if ever) seen clone recipe for Deschutes Brewing's Black Butte
Porter!  The first attempt was VERY close, but lacked the roasty flavor
overtone and sweetness of the Real Thing.  I've adjusted the recipe
accordingly, and here it is:


6 oz. chocolate malt
6 oz. black patent malt
8 oz. honey malt
8 oz. 10L crystal malt
4 oz. toasted barley (buy it pre-toasted, or DIY `at` 350       deg./10minutes)
8 oz. malto-dextrin
6 lbs. Light malt extract syrup
1 lb. Light D.M.E
1 1/2 oz. Galena hops (60 min. bittering)
1 oz. Cascade hops (1/2 hour bittering/finishing)
1 oz. Tettnanger hops (5 min. aroma)
Wyeast #1338 European Ale yeast
2 tsp. each Gypsum and Burton Water Salts (We have very soft H2O)


Add salts, gypsum to 1 1/2 gal. H2O.  Steep grains for 1/2 hour `at` 158 deg.
Sparge with 1/2 gal. 170 deg. H2O, and strain out any loose grain.  Mix in
extract and malto-dextrin, and top off with H2O to desired optimum level for
your brew pot.  Bring to a boil, and boil for 10 minutes before adding
Galena hops.  After 30 more min., add Cascade hops.  Last 5 min. add
Tettnanger hops.  Cool wort with hops in it.  Remove hops at pitching temp.,
and pitch yeast.  Ferment to completion according to your desired method.


Enjoy it, I sure did!

Secondary still going slowly. I put the secondary in my basement the temp 
stayed between 58 and 60 degs for about 5 weeks the temp is starting to 
go up now around 68 degs. Its been kinda of hot this last week here( San

I took a reading was about a week and a half ago and it was 1.030. I 
think it should be a bit lower than that. SG was 1.056

Subject: Berliner Weisse Recipe Wanted




I'm looking for a recipe for an *authentic* Berliner Weisse. I have seen
recipies on the Web and in books for Berlin-style wheat beers (characterized by
a sourness not unlike Belgian Whites), but I have yet to run across one that
calls for Lactobacillus Delbrueckii, the bacteria found in milk (?) that imparts
the sour flavors.


A description I found in a style guide reads thusly: tart, refreshing...
anywhere up to 75% malted wheat is used and results in a characteristic foamy
large white head. The ale-type yeast and lactic combination produces a light
body which is dry, tart, and has a sharp lactic sourness... very pale yellow
color, effervescent, modest alcohol content, no bitterness, no hop flavor or
aroma, and low fruity ester notes.


Any recipes and/or advice on where to find Lactobacillus Delbrueckii would be
appreciated. Thanks!
