Subject: Kids!  Don't try this at home!


Greetings, everyone.


Ah, the perils of brewing big brews without thinking!  Clearly, I made
a number of mistakes in that batch, and I wanted to summarize for the
net.  (Some of the authors also commented to the digest, so some of
these points are repeated.)


IMHO, the errors in order of importance:


1.  Don't dry hop in the primary.


My intent was to have a nice clean secondary, to facilitate a clearer
beer.  As was pointed out, not only did I not achieve the objective
(since the outgassing of CO2 tends to remove the hop aromas) but I ran
a real risk of infection.  Dry hopping in the secondary minimizes the
problem of the CO2 scrubbing out the hop aromatics, and in addition
the alcohol content and the high yeast count helps keep the yeast tops
in the ecological niche, minimizing the risk of infection.  That was a
definate no.


2.  Don't _expect_ to have to use the champagne yeast.


The particular yeast I used, Wyeast Belgian Abbey, is fairly alcohol
tolerant.  The wort may want fresh yeast as it gets close to the end,
or it may progress normally (in practise, for this experiment, all
seems well).  The champagne yeast should be considered last resort to
fix a stuck fermentation.


3.  Pitch big.


When doing high gravity beers, it appears the higher the pitching rate
the better.  I did a little 250 ml pitch.  One correspondent suggested
1.5 liters of yeast slurry!  Probably the best idea (that I intend to
use next time I try a really big beer) is to brew something like an
India Pale Ale and throw the high gravity wort on the dregs.
Curiously, I did almost that with a 1.090 Imperial stout -- brewed a
sweet stout with the Wyeast Scottish Ale yeast, and then through the
1.090 on top of its dregs.  It (predictably) exploded out through the
airlock, and all over the floor... but brought the 1.090 down to a dry
1.018 after a two week primary/secondary.


4.  Think numerically about the hopping rate.


Unfortunately, I didn't -- and its clear I underhopped.  Had I thought
about it, I probably should have used Tinseth's calculator, and
checked the style guidelines for typical numbers.  It really didn't
strike me that the beer has almost *half again* as much sugar as the
imperial, and so probably wants something like half again as much HBU.




Kids!  Try this at home!


On the good side, I managed to not worry too much about it (can you
say "learning experience"?  Sure.  I knew you could.) and at this
point I'm pretty happy about how things are going.  Yesterday, I went
to the friendly neighborhood brew store (quick plug: BREW, on Marina
just west of 880 in San Leandro, San Francisco Bay area -- nice place,
about 10,000 sq ft, fresh extract for $1.39/lb, nice owners, lots of
extra junk, no affiliation etc just happy customer) and picked up a
glass carboy.  I racked the brandywine into the carboy.  At this
point, its at 1.052 and still bubbling happily -- about a bloop per
minute through the S-shaped airlock (as opposed to 10-20 bloops per
minute at peak fermentation).  The tasting at this point showed that
it wasn't in fact infected, was already pretty high-alcohol, and was
indeed too sweet.  (One correspondent suggested hopping the heck out
of some wort, and bittering the brandywine that way, but I think I'm
going to keep it as it is -- spouse likes sweet.)  So far, so good.


Incidentally, this is my first experience with this yeast.  The
brandywine has a unique taste which is I assume the yeast.  I strongly
associated it with North Coast Brewing's seasonal "PranQster" beer.
(NCB is a brewpub/microbrew in Ft. Bragg, CA.)  Does anyone know if
this is the same yeast as they use?  Can anyone tell me of a
commercial brew that uses this yeast available in the SF Bay area?
(One correspondent mentioned that this is the Celis yeast, but I am
not aware of seeing Celis available for sale here.)


Thanks to the HBD and all who responded to my query.  I think you all
have improved my beer making technique.  Thanks!

Subject: Hot Summer?  Who Cares?


Well, now, with all the talk about National Homebrew Day being May or Fall or
hot or whatever, I thought I'd toss in another shameless plug for my
"Fermentation Chiller", plans for which are available at


http://oeonline.com/~pbabcock/lagcab.html


Keeps beer fermenting happily at 60 - 70 deg F even when it's 90F in the
garage!  Or ferment at lager temperatures if you have a cool basement.  Holds
fermenting wort temp to ~2F variation.  It's just a glorified chambered
icebox with a thermostat and fan, and it "runs" on two gallon jugs of ice.
 Surprisingly efficient (change the ice ~2 days when it's 90F ambient; 3-4
days when 75-80F), inexpensive to build ($60 or so with brand new material;
much less if parts are "scrounged"), compact (16" x 2' x ~3'), lightweight
(lift with one hand...store it in the attic or a closet in the non-National
Homebrew Months).


In the year or so since I originally published the plans, I've received some
feedback from folks who have built one (or more).  A couple good ones to keep
in mind:


* Tie a string to the handle of the lower water jug.  My arms are long but
it's still a reach to get that one out!


* If using a liquid-metal thermometer, mount it to the cabinet with Velcro to
make re-levelling (for accuracy) easier if it's moved.


* Use duct tape on the seams, and cover with loud (but NOT plaid) contact
paper.


* Use a heavy book instead of dowels to secure the top.  A good fit on the
front panel eliminates the need for them there too.


* You could substitute 1/2" plywood for the Fan Board, and 1/4" for the
Baffle Board.  The Fan Board needs only to be somewhat insulative (since it's
inside the box); the Baffle Board merely redirects airflow.  This might make
resizing the cut plan easier to use with various fermenter shapes.


* Add a condensation drain (a hole with a short length of tubing) at the
bottom of the Ice Chamber.  In our dry environment this isn't much of a
problem but a Chiller in Mississippi in August will likely need to take a
leak.


This weekend project has enabled me to keep my cool while brewing year round.
 I used it all last year in 100+F heat and we're already having 95-ish
temperatures here in El Paso, so I know it'll work well in milder parts of
the country.

Hello fellow homebrewers


I'm a Dutch homebrewer and I have beer in a 5 Liter keg (about 2 gallon).
I found a lot of N2O patrons (?), and now I have the next question.

Subject: Grain Mills


Just wanted to add the Valley Mill to the list of available grain mills -
it's a new dual-roller, adjustable mill somewhat similar to the JSP
MaltMill.  I've got one and have used it on the last 4 batches or so with
great success - gives a very nice crush, high throughput and basically
trouble free.  The crush is quite similar to that of the MaltMill the local
homebrew store has which I used to use.  Overall, I really like the mill -
one of the nicest features is a much larger grain hopper than any other mill
I've seen - I can get around 4 or 5 lbs. of grain in it at once, so it's not
as much of a chore as other mills.  The locking adjustable rollers are quite
nice also - there are about 8 adjustments in all, giving plenty of range for
wheat, barley, etc. - and one of the best features is the price: $99 plus
shipping (from Canada, about $20).  


I recently motorized mine using a GE "Minagear" motor (used surplus, ~$25,
172 RPM `at` 40 in-lb torque, available from Surplus Center - contact me if you
need the phone number since I don't have it handy).  The motor works great
and frees me from having to crank by hand.  The mill also comes with an
adaptor for your hand drill, but I got tired of wrangling that thing.


They've got a web page at:


http://www.web.apc.org/~valley/valleymill.html


Now, the astute reader will note that I wrote the web page for the Valley
Mill and thus probably am a bit biased.  Well, for the record:
1.) I'm not the manufacturer, just a satisfied customer.
and
2.) I only offered to help them get a page online after I had ordered, paid
for, and used my mill.  That's how impressed with it I was...

   Where have you been for the last year, Dave?  The Valley Mill was
introduced in early 1995.  I've been putting this adjustable two roller
mill through its paces for the last couple of months and am quite pleased.
Today, I'm scanning some pictures for the much promised update to my page.
There should be some new mill pictures up by the end of the week.
   And by the way, no connection with Valley except we're both in Ontario,
but that only means I paid more sales tax.

Subject: corny keg repair / cleaning scortched wort / grain mills


Howdy fellow HBDers!


I recently siphoned a batch from the secondary into a new (to me) 
corny keg only to find a pin-hole leak near the top.  Apparently when 
this keg was sitting in the back of some restaraunt, some kids 
thought it amusing to shoot at it with their new Red Rider BB-gun.  
Most of the shot just dented it, but one created a small, almost 
undetectable crack in the dent.  


Anyway, does anyone know of a simple but safe way to fix this, short
of taking it to a welder?  I'm looking for something like a non-toxic
glue that will bond strong enough with the SS to hold under the
pressures of forced carbonation. I tried a hot-glue gun but that gave
way after 3 days under pressure:) Fortunately I had a spare corny and 
was able to salvage most of that beer.

Mike Spinelli asks about removing scorched wort from his bottom (keg, 
that is).


Mike, try using an oven cleaner foam.  Should scrub right off after
letting it sit for a few minutes.  But be careful with the stuff (use
gloves) and don't use it on anything aluminum.  And clean your keg
well afterwards.


And on a similar note, does anyone know if such oven cleaners can be 
used to passivate SS?  Isn't the active ingredient nitric acid?

John Van Huffel asks about using a Kitchen Aid Grain Mill


John, I've never used one, but I did inquire about the idea a long
time ago before I bought my MaltMill.  If I remember the responses
correctly, it was that it creates too fine of a crush since it is
made for milling flour. If its free, then maybe go ahead and try it.
But if your buying one, you'd be better off spending that money on a
mill made for milling barley. 


 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


And on the subject of grain mills, David C. Harsh writes:


> Personally,the PhillMill is the least expensive, can be easily
> motorized 


Yes, but will motorizing it void any warranties?  I'm asking, I
don't know.  I do know that Jack Schmidling's MaltMill has a
lifetime warranty even if you motorize it, which, besides the
quality of the crush, is why I bought one.


> Any single pass mill is almost guaranteed to give the same sort of

Why do you say this?  Just curious, but it seems to me that roller
length, roller spacing, and whether the spacing increases from one
end to the other (or not) would at least effect the ease of use, if
not also create noticable differences in the size distribution of
the crushed grain.

Greetings from a lurker. (it sounds so mysterious...)


I've found that (no endorsement, blah, blah, blah) 3M has a spray on
product called something like Artist's Adhesive (the word temorary or
repositionable may be in there, too).  It acts like a spray on Sticky Note
Pad glue.  It fits all the criteria, 1) it's easy (although there is some
over-spray when you have small labels) b)  it lets the labels come off
easily, and iii) it leaves no residue after water washing.


(now that I'm almost caught up on week-old mail, I think I'll try a glue
stick for the next batch.)

Van, 


My mom bought me this attachment for christmas. The thing works great and I
get a very good grind. 


A couple of points:


1.      You can only grind about 7-8 pounds of grain at a time because the
motor         overheats around this point.


2.      Adjustment of the grinding plates is a little weird at first.


3.      The grain reservoir is kind of small but some brainstorming on your
behalf can         fix this problem.


Overall the Kitchen Aid mill is a pleasure to work with.

Subject: Extraction Yield Sucks!


All grainers,


        I know I'm not suppose to worry about my extraction and just use
more grain if it's too low, but this is the third recipe in a row that I
end up with a much lower OG than expected. I buy my grain as I need it, so
it's a little tricky now because I don't know how much to buy for my next
recipe.
        I'm doing everything "by the book". Step infusion, mash out, sparge
at the right temperature, at the "proper" rate, etc. I take a sample before
I start boiling, figure out the math and WHAT! 22 pts!!?? I'm using 10
pounds of grain, how can that be.
        I've decided that it *must* be the crush. I'm using a grain mill at
the homebrew store, and I have a feeling that it's set too loose.
        What does properly crushed grain *really* look like anyway? In the
last batch I crushed, I remember seeing quite a few grains that seemed
intact. Should I be seeing a few pulverised grains ?


        BTW, I'm assuming you figure out the math for extraction rate
*before* you boil, right?


TIA

In the end the success or failure of this digest rest on our shoulders,
those that lurk and contribute, not those of the service provider for
it is the collective that through their comments and input create the
heart and soul of the HBD.  Now here's a toast to the next 2000 issues
of the HBD, CHEERS!


And now for a beer related issue, in HBD 2030 Jamie asked:

I have modified a Hoover Universal 304L "Miller Keg" for use in
my brewery.  If all you want to do is use this keg for a fermentor of
serving keg then you need to remove the ball valve from the keg:


     To remove the valve and dip tube assembly us a screwdriver or
     an awl to remove the circular spring clip from the inside
     of the tapper fitting.  Make sure that ALL PRESSURE IS RELEASED
     first !!! (or you could launch a valve steam into orbit or
     take an impressive beer bath, the second option is at least
     good for your hair)


     The valve stem is held in place by a spring clip.


   *****          --          --    === <- spring clip
   *****         |  |        |  |   ### <- valve and dip tube

   ***|                 ##                  |***


The 304L on the keg signifies that the keg is manufactured from 304 
stainless steel but note that it is not as thick a gauge of 304L as that used
in more conventional kegs (the ones that are not rubber coated).  I decided
to remove the rubber coating and use my keg as a mashing kettle, this was 
not an easy process!  After making many top-to-bottom cuts in the the
rubber coating using a hack saw and a utility knife (be very careful to 
avoid cutting the metal or removing any important body parts, like fingers)
I was able to peel the rubber away from the keg, I used a scotchbrite pad
on a finish sander to completely clean the exterior of the keg and was
rewarded with a very nice looking pot.  One thing, these kegs are basically
a 15 gal. oval tank once the rubber is removed, they have no handles or base
ring welded to the tank, those functions are molded in the rubber so I 
had to design a burner stand with it's own supports to keep the tank
upright.  Although this type of keg conversion takes more effort the final
result is worth it.

To me, they are.  Even though the particular analysis may not apply to
my water, I feel that every time I read one of A. J.'s discussion of
water chemistry I come a little closer to escaping my abysmal ignorance
of the subject.  There is a lot I don't know about water as it pertains
to brewing and I would like to know more.


As far as I am concerned, the bandwidth is better spent than on many things

By the way, thanks Rob.  I really appreciate the hbd and all the work you have

        The musical show "Forever Plaid" toured thru our fair city and I 
went and enjoyed the great 40's and 50's "boy" tunes of male harmonization.
Great Fun.  See it if you like the better side of the 50's.


        However, I did experience a stuck fermentation and now I find out 
that a local theatre group is scheduling "Forever Plaid" on its theatre 
bill for the 96-97 season.  I suspect it is a greater threat to brewing 
then the "summer" thread that weaves on and on.  


        Question, did any of you experience stuck fermentations when the 
show toured your city? It may not have been related at all.


        Also, I really like it when contributors sign with first and last

nice to have the email address at the end in case I want a private

You took the words of of my fingers.  I have never had a stuck sparge AND
I have never used flaked barley.   For what it is worth, I have used flaked
corn with no problems.  This is not double blind science but the finger points
that way.


Aside from the flaked barley as a potential problem, my standard advice
is to let it rest a full 30 mins before starting to drain tun.  Even more 
importantly, if a problem does occur, resist the urge to stir it up, you
will only aggrivate it.  Try blowing gently on the end of the hose, just a
short poof.

>Any single pass mill is almost guaranteed to give the same sort of

In my not so humble opinion, I do not believe this is an accurate 
statement.  The length of the rollers can be a significant factor in
determining the grist distribution.


If the rollers are sufficiently long, they can be skewed to provide
non-linear spacing from one end to the other without damaging
the bearings.  I won't repeat here why this is useful because it
is documented with details and drawings on our web page.


However, I will point out that MM rollers are 3" longer than the
Valley Mill and two or three TIMES longer then the rest of the ones
you mentioned and does NOT use plastic bearings.

Subject: Jack's Offer




Well folks,
It appears to me that we have a reasonable compromise to the ownership of 
the HBD on the table.  I believe that in issue #2029, Jack Schmidling 
offered to provide the resources necessary to run the HBD, if Al Korzonas 
would provide the labor....  I'm assuming that Jack would follow through 
with his offer even if Rob thinks there is another individual more suited 
for janitorial work <g>.
FWIW, I think this idea is great because it gives us a kind of "separation 
of church & state".  If an organization or individual is willing to provide 
the physical resources, so that the HBD can be maintained by an org. or 
individual not otherwise affiliated with or employed by said benefactor, the 
arrangement should serve to preserve the ideals and integrity of the forum. 
 If this type of arrangement can be reached, I believe it should remain the 
responsibility of the outgoing janitor to name and train the incoming 
janitor, as well as find the HBD's new home, if the existing benefactor 
chooses to withdraw support.  Hopefully, any incoming benefactors/janitors 
could be persuaded to make a minimum time commitment to the effort (say 1-3 
yrs) to ensure the forum's stability.
I personally have survived changes in editors of my favorite magazines, but 
have also cancelled subscriptions when format changes came through more than 
once per year.  Change is inevitable...I just prefer the chance to get used 
to something before making another switch.
OTOH, I would hate to see the HBD fall apart to due to lack of a 
semi-permanent home.  I have learned alot in the past few months...enough so 
that I feel comfortable waiting on all the brewers (not just beginners, like 
me) at my husband's homebrew shop when he needs a day off.  So I guess I 
should also thank the collective for making me look good.  All the knowledge 
I've gleaned from here tends to counteract  the "cash register from hell"'s, 
tendency to make me look dumb & blonde!

There is another, the Valley Mill.  I have one and have been quite happy

I believe that it's not the solubility that is changed with oxidation, but
rather the bitterness.  I've read that un-oxidized beta acids are not very
bitter but oxidized ones are.  I believe that DeKlerck writes that we should
not be expecing less bitterness when we use older hops, but I'm not sure if
he specifically said that it's because of the beta acids increasing bitterness
balances the decreasing bitterness in the alpha acids.  (This does not mean
I condone using stale, old hops for brewing most styles!)


Note there is a counter to this: the aged hops used for Lambic/Lambiek
brewing.  There, three-year-old hops are used in relatively large quantities.
It is said that the reason for this is to get the antibacterial benefits
from the hops while not getting much bitterness out of them.  Given the
high hop rates used, Lambieks/Lambics are surprisingly low in bitterness.


It has been a long, long time since I've made beer with old, oxidized hops
(pLambic/pLambiek notwithstanding and these were baked) so I can't tell you
if the burnt quality you note has anything to do with oxidation or age, but
if switching suppliers has solved the problem, then I believe you have
solved the problem!


Regarding the cheesey aroma, every hop smells different as it ages, just as
every hop smells different fresh.  I personally feel that old, oxidized
Fuggles smell cheesey, whereas old, oxidized Cascades smell piney.  Other
oxidized hops smell grassy, minty or sweaty.  Since I buy a lot of whole hops
and have been intentionally aging them for brewing pLambiek/pLambic, I have
quite a bit of familiarity with the smell of old hops.

Erik is worried about his new aluminum pot dissolving into the wort.


Fears about alzheimer's aside, there was an article on aluminum and brewing
in Brewing Techniques a few issues ago.  The bottom line is that there was
no higher level of aluminum in beer made in an aluminum kettle as there was
in a parallel batch made in a stainless steel kettle.  Two points of caution:


1. don't scrub it till the aluminum shines -- I've heard this will give
you an off flavour, and


2. don't use strong acids or bases for cleaning.


***
Erik also is worried about his Pilsner made without a starter.


Yes, without a starter, a two or even three day lag time is not uncommon.
What you've read about starting warm and then cooling versus starting
cool are two different ways to make a lager.  Starting warm then cooling
is faster but has two disadvantages: 1. more esters (which are unwelcome
in a lager) and 2. risk of shocking the yeast if you cool too quickly.
The textbooks say to cool no faster than 2C per day, but many yeasts can
easily handle 5C per day.  This is true even for the starter if you are
using the "starting cool" method -- you should very slowly cool your
starter down to the wort temperature if it is not already at wort temp.


You really should use a starter for lagers and a big starter (at least
2L and 4L would not be too big) is recommended.


***
There have been a number of people who have mentioned fermenting in kegs
lately.  I belive that one person said they have removed the gas-in fitting
and attached an airlock.  The other person connected a gas-in connector to
the keg which then goes to a tube which is submerged in a liquid in a
jar.  I would like to caution that these connector openings (especially
if you are going through the whole connector assembly) are very small
and are very likely to clog if there is blowoff.  While these kegs are
rated to 130psi, I think it's a good idea to not try and see if yeast
can generate 130psi.  I know that a lot of people will write and say that
they have fermented in Corny kegs for years with no problems, but I
still contend (after two carboy explosions due to clogged blowoff tubes:
one 5/16" ID the other 3/8" ID) that it is better to be safe than sorry and
any chance of blowing off through a Corny fitting can be *dangerous*.

I am very skeptical -- recall that Miller was the one who said that
after bottling all the CO2 is quickly produced but requires several weeks
to dissolve in the beer.  Both scientifically and experimentally we (the
HBD collective) have proven that this is false.


Firstly, many American megabrewed Lagers are "naturally carbonated" meaning
that the fermenters are sealed with a certain amount of fermentables left
and (with the help of special pressure valves) are carbonated via the
remaining extract.  Since glucose is always the first to be fermented there
are nothing but larger sugars left at the end of fermentation and we can
safely say there is no fruitiness in American Megabrewed Lagers.


Secondly, kraeusening has been used by German brewmasters to carbonate
beer for centuries and nobody is criticizing their beers for being
too estery for style, are they?  The German beers that are brewed following
Reinheitsgebot are not even allowed by law to use refined sugar to prime!


Ken continues:

I suspect it was not esters that you were sensing but something else.
Furthermore, there is nothing inherently different between the yeast's
oxygen uptake with various primings.  They consume the oxygen because they
desire it and the type of sugar used for priming doesn't affect that.

Subject: Please unsubscribe Jake from your mailing list.




Jake and I brew together regularly.  In fact, it was Jake that first turned
me on to subscribing to HBD, way back in, oh, 1992 or something.  One day,
he mentioned to me that he had left HBD because it was mostly filled with
junk.


Well, the quality had been steadily improving for the last few months.  It
seemed to reach a plateau, and almost every day I was forwarding tidbits 
to Jake.  So, finally, he decided to resubscribe.


Within seconds, the quality here plummetted.  First, we have Al and Pat 
spanking each other about the National Homebrew Day.  Then, we have the
discussion of the HBD being handed off to AoB, and everyone has to air 
their opinion about it.  Twice.  Then, joy of joys, the "Does shitty beer
actually suck, or do we?" thread rears it's ugly head.


Randy Huyck posts a 22 line sig.  Twice in a row.  Mike Bell posts a long, 
rambling flame about how obnoxious flaming is.  Thanks, Mike.  I'd flame you
for it, but I thought speaking calmly about it, in public, would be a more
egregious waste of bandwidth.  Barry Finkling Curtis really takes the cake,
however, by taking a bunch of PRIVATE e-mails, presumably not posted here 
in the name of saving bandwidth, and perhaps in the name of decency and 
discretion, and proceeds to post them, for all our benefit, along with his
commentary about their commentary, all of which is apparently commentary 
about commentary, and it's value.  And something about cussin', too.  Sheeit.


Finally, of course, are the clueless masses asking publicly to be unsubscribed.
What, am *I* supposed to do it?  Seriously - I assume that this is due to 
the fact that Rob is handing the digest off soon.  Still, I think the message
is pretty clear - Jake must leave.  I'll forward stuff about first-wort 
hopping and hot-side aeration and iodophor and all the other wonderful things
we USUALLY talk about.  


Anyway, hats off and bottoms up to Rob Gardner for his fantastic work!  


To anyone considering a legitimate response to this, remember - If you take 
things too seriously, you wind up sounding even stupider than I do.  If
there is sufficient interest in private e-mail, I'll post a summary.

Try this:  Simply attach a length of hose to a corny "in" connector and run
the hose into a beer bottle half full of water.  Simple easy air lock.


A twist that I may try next time I lager is this:  Leave the dip tube full
length, when it comes time to keg, attach the CO2 and dispenser and blow
out the gunk on the bottom before you shake the key to carbonate,  Then
simply carbonate in the same keg you used for lagering.  Note that I have
not tried this yet, it is a thought I had.  Can anyone see any problems?
