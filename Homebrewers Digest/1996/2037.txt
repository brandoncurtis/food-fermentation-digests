Subject: First Wort Hopping


I was looking through some old posts on first wort hopping, in particular
those posted by Jim Dipalma and John Palmer.  I understand the concept, but
there is one thing that confuses me:  if the hops are placed in the kettle
during the sparge, which is prior to the boiling, how come the aroma is not
boiled off during the boil (like bittering hops) or scrubbed off during
fermentation (which is why you dry hop in the secondary).

Subject: Infected brews...




Fellow Brewers,
 I have had 3 infected brews in a row and never had a problem with 20 
previous batches. The symptoms are small stringy white stuff on the top of 
the bottle, gushing of the brew after opened, and a distinct off-flavor in 
the brew. I am hoping that I have narrowed down what the problem is. I had 
purchased 2 Hop-Tech bags of E.Kent Goldings hop flowers. I have used these 
only for dry hopping. Upon opening the first bag they suggest to put the 
hops into mason jars and put them in the freezer. I did not have a problem 
with the first couple of batches but I think after the length of time of 
being in the freezer some bacteria got into the hops. The reason I think 
that the problem is due to the dry hopping is because the beer smells 
excellent after the primary  fermentation. Toward the end of the secondary 
fermentation with dry hopping I start to see this whitish material on top of 
the brew. Then this is perpetuated into the bottle or keg.


 I just brewed on Saturday and I am going to leave out the dry hopping and 
see what happens. If this appears to be the problem I will probably go back 
to using pellets. Does anyone else have a similar experience with these 
symptoms. The beer itself is very clear but this stringy white stuff is at 
the top of the bottle. It is very depressing to have this happen after every 
other beer I have made has tasted outstanding to me, especially since the 
move to all-grain. I would love to hear the collective wisdom on this one. 
Please email me directly at bob.bessette`at`lamrc.com and I will keep you 
updated on my experiment with leaving out the dry hopping.


Cheers,
Bob Bessette

When I do brew extract batches (still about 25% of my batches are extract
and 75% all-grain) I do use DME (dried malt extract, a.k.a. Spray Malt).
Although the lower moisture content of DME means that it will age and
darken slower than LME (liquid malt extract, a.k.a. malt extract syrup),
as long as both are fresh, it should not make much of a difference which
you use.  Note that since most LMEs are 80% solids and most DMEs are 97%
solids, you need about 22% more liquid extract when substituting for
dry.  Conversely, if you use dry, you only need about 82% as much when
substituting for liquid.


Why do I use both DME and syrup?  Because it is much easier to store a
partially used package of DME.  If I need 7.2 pounds of syrup, I will
use two 3.3 pound cans and 1/2 pound of DME (0.6 pounds times 0.82).
If you can buy 7.2 pounds of syrup or brew so often that you can handle
a half-used can or bag of syrup for a week in the fridge, then use all
syrup!


There was a post which suggested that there is some kind of association
with "paler color and not as strong a taste" and LME.  I disagree.  In
terms of strength of flavour, there is no more variation between DME and
LME as there is between various manufacturers extracts (i.e. not much).
When it comes to lightness of colour, Extra Pale DME makes some of the
palest extract beers.  Old LME is notorious for making dark beers even
if you do use something labeled "gold" or "pale."

You are confusing S. delbrueckii with L. delbrueckii.  The former is
a yeast and the latter a lactic bacteria.  They were both isolated by
Mr. Delbrueck (Hans?), which is why they bear his name.


Wyeast #3056 is NOT a good yeast for a Berliner Weissbier.  You need to
use a clean ale yeast like Wyeast #1007 or #1056 along with a lactic
acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii.

Wouldn't a electomechanical relay be far less expensive than $15-30?  Just
make sure to put it outside of your fridge so that condensation doesn't ruin

It's not air that ruins Iodophor, per se... it's the iodine in the Iodophor
that evaporates.  I store it in a sealed Corny keg and in a sealed,
gasketted-lid HDPE 7-gallon bucket.  I have to remember to shake them a little
before opening since the iodine seems to condense on the "ceiling" of the
vessels and shaking before opening redissolves it.  It lasts basically forever
in the Corny and certainly a month or more in the HDPE.  It does stain the
HDPE, but I have designated this bucket just for Iodophor and so I don't
worry about the orange staining.

I recently brewed this very tasty Rye Beer which I think beats the heck out
of Red Hook's Rye beer. The recipe follows single infusion mashing
techniques used in a 10 gallon Gott Cooler. The results were a somewhat
cloudy light & hoppy summer brew that I really reccomend to anyone who wants
a little Rye in their lives. Recipe:
8# Belgian Pale Malt
4# Rye Malt (Not flaked)
2oz Cascade leaf 60min.
Hallertauer leaf 1oz. 30 min.
Hallertauer leaf 1oz. 2 min.
1TBSP irish moss last 10 min.

Subject: FWH Data Point, Boil Over


Howdy, 


I just tried my first batch of first wort hopped pilsner.  I do think that
the procedure resulted in a nice hop FLAVOR profile (not bitterness, but hop
flavor).  And, as I understand, the usual procedure of hopping 5 minutes
before the end of the boil is to enhance hop flavor and aroma.  Well I was
having a problem with understanding how the volatile aroma hop oils could
survive a FWH schedule.  IMHO, my pilsner has an improved hop flavor
profile, but lacks the aroma I was looking for.  I used noble hop plugs in
the FWH and did not add any hops at the end.  I'm now thinking that I will
use both FWH and a final 5-minute hop on my next pilsner.  Hopefully this
will provide both a great hop flavor and aroma profile.  Any thoughts on this?


For the most part, I have solved the boil-over problem on my system.  I use
a converted 1/2 brl boiling pot.  The trick is to vent the steam.  I use the
cut off top of my mash tun keg as a lid for my boiling pot (the lid needs to
be larger diameter than the opening in the boiling pot).  I removed the
valve from the lid - leaving a domed lid with an opening in the middle.  To
the top of the opening I attached a dryer vent hose and connected the other
end to an exhaust fan.  Turn the fan on and crank the flame!  Removing the
steam allows for a rolling boil with no build-up of foam to cause a
boil-over.  I got this idea from a past Brewing Techniques (last year I
think) and I'm real happy with the results.  Kettle venting is a common
procedure in commercial breweries.

Subject: Extract Brewing & Water Treatment


Not long ago Gregory King sent me a copy of this letter he received in
response to his question about water treatment in the manufacture of malt
extract:


==============================


Dear Mr King


Thank you for your letter of the 18th April 1996 regarding ion
concentrations.


Firstly, the water we use for the manufacture of malt extract is primarily
recovered condensate from malt extract concentration by evaporation.


Any deficiency is made up using natural water which we extract from deep bore
holes on our site at Stowmarket.


We are sited in a particularly hard water area but this make up water only
constitutes a small part of the water used in manufacture.


I can, however, provide you with typical analyses of the cations present in
our
malt extracts:-


Calcium               250 mgs/litre
Magnesium             550 mgs/litre
Sodium                400 mgs/litre
Potassium            6000 mgs/litre


We do not analyse for any anions, nor do we routinely analyse our bore hole
water.  However, most of the above originate from the barley.


The wort pH prior to concentration is between 5.4 and 5.8.


Yours sincerely

==============================


In other words, they basically use "distilled" water!  An interesting result
is the pre-concentration pH -- 5.4 to 5.8 -- which is higher than the ~5.0 to
5.4 range we typically shoot for.  The lack of additional calcium might be
preventing further acidification (although there is some leftover!?); sources
I have seen (Pappazzian? I forget which) indicate that adding distilled water
to plain pale grain results in pH's in the "high-five's".  Perhaps the small
amount of hard makeup water they use has sufficient calcium to bring them
into a suitable range.


As far as the "untested cations" go, I'm just guessing here but I'd say the
malt would not contain any appreciable SO4- or Cl- anyway; so the above
analysis should be complete as far as ions relevent to brewing go.  Anyone
care to elaborate?


Since they start with essentially "ion-free" water, the ions they are listing
above, as they state, come from the grain, and would therefore be present in
those ballpark quantities in all our worts made with ion-free water, whether
extract or all-grain.  Any ion concentrations we're adding with salt
treaments would end up *in addition* to these, although it's still the
original water's ionic makeup we want to watch.  The exception would be Ca
since some is consumed during the mash.  Note that they give concentrations
*per litre of extract*; assuming dilution in water to typical wort gravities
these reduce to around 30 ppm Ca, 40 ppm Mg, and 30 ppm Na, in very round
figures (I'm estimating pounds-to-litres conversion).


What does this mean for extract brewers and water treatment?  Obviously not
all the calcium available (in the malt itself) is being used, although the pH
is still a bit high.  Perhaps another 10 ppm or so (SWAG) would drop it to
the "ideal range".  Other ions are not of significant consequence during the
mash, so I'd be inclined to try to duplicate those concentrations closely.
 The exception would be carbonates, which for extract brewing we would
ideally want to totally eliminate anyway; try to minimize CO3 in the original
water.


Calcium contributes to the beer character in the boil (hop extraction & break
action) as well as in the mash, but I'd guess its contribution is subtle.  If
this is the case, then, one could argue that you could take a given profile
and not worry too much about the calcium; let its level be set as a
consequence of other ion adjustments instead of targeting a particular
number.  Since it appears that perhaps only a small amount of additional
calcium would properly acidify the extract mash, one could speculate that
just using the approximate Ca concentrations in a target profile would be
adequate, but far less than that may be suitable as well since we're now only
worried about secondary effects.  This is good news since a common source of
Ca is gypsum, which carries sulphate with it.  Sulphate can harshen
bitterness if used in excess.  If we're having trouble establishing a profile
due to high sulphate, cutting back on gypsum would be appropriate for extract
brewers since the calcium is not as important.  Epsom salt, which also
contributes sulphate, is typically used in *small* quantities to add
magnesium, so it shouldn't be as difficult to deal with as far as managing
sulphate.


As far as other manufacturers are concerned, it makes sense that they would
recycle much of their water; if so, most extracts should have similar ionic
content regardless of manufacturer.


Bottom line:  If all this speculation is true, then water treatment for
extract brewers should be no different than that for grain brewers, with the
possible exception that using much lower levels of calcium than proposed in a
target profile would not have significant effect.  Also, carbonate should be
avoided as well, due to its secondary effects on color and bitterness.

Well, I have an adjustable JSP MaltMill, and I just leave where the mark is
on the green line.  I only thought adjustability was important when using
corn, wheat or rice.   So I guess even though I have an adjustable mill, I
don't think it's important for grain.

Actually, if I listened to my own words (never a stuck sparge) I would

Blowing helps when hops get stuck draining the boiler but would
probably only aggrivate problems while lautering.

Good point.  I don't think I was into the pump mode when I had the
problem and never tried it again.

Subject: Brewing with Rye


     I just wanted to mention my rye brewing experience.  I brewed a beer 
     with ~60% malted rye.  The final product was great (it's done very 
     well in competitions), but I doubt that I could duplicate it.
     
     I used a single decoction mash, with a protein rest and low 
     saccharification temp.  In the beginning, everything seemed fine, but 
     as saccharification proceeded the mash began to resemble very goopy 
     oatmeal.  By the time I was ready to sparge, it was effectively 
     impermeable to the sparge water!  There's no hyperbole there, I mean 
     it was STUCK.
     
     My solution was to use a spatula to scrape and stir the grain-goop (to 
     call it a grain bed would be a gross misrepresentation of its 
     appearance) while running the sparge water through.  I collected the 
     extremely draff laden run-off in my boiler.  I decided that to boil it 
     with all the husk particles would make for an unpalatably astringent 
     beer, so I stuck it in the refrigerator to allow the draff to settle 
     out.
     
     Well, I got distracted by other stuff and it sat in there for 4 days, 
     by which time it had soured nicely.  I was going to chuck it, but 
     decided,"Oh, what the hell.  The hard part is done.  Finish it."  So I 
     siphoned the wort off the settled draff and boiled, etc.
     
     Damned if the stuff wasn't good!  The sourness was (miraculously) not 
     overwhelming.  In fact, it gave the beer a complexity that many people 
     seem to love.  Admittedly, I never intended it to taste anything like 
     the way it came out, but you've got to take what you can get!
     
     If anybody still wants to try this, here's my recipe:
     
     2.7 kg malted rye,  0.9 kg Ireks Pils,  0.9 kg Ireks Munich, 
     0.2 kg 20L crystal.  (1 kg=2.2 pounds, and I am American, I just like 
     Metrics)
     
     Hallertauer pellets, 3.7% AA, 12.25g for 20 min., 12.25g for 7 min.
     
     OG=1.051, FG=1.015.  Yeast=Wyeast 3068.  Primed with 40 ounces of 
     saved wort.
     
     The mash and souring specifics are in the above text.  One last note:  
     a friend made a 100% Rye beer using rice hulls to set up the grain 
     bed.  They didn't really help him much.

Greetings!
        This is the official announcement for the Second Annual BUZZ
Boneyard Brewoff, to be held July 20, 1996 at Joe's Brewery, Champaign, IL.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.


Thanks!
Joe




                The Boneyard Union of Zymurgical Zealots
                Second Annual Boneyard Brew-Off


This is the official announcement of the second homebrew competition of the
Boneyard Union of Zymurgical Zealots of Champaign, Illinois. The
competition, to be held on July 20 1996, will be a BJCP sanctioned
competition with all the standard AHA categories (except for cider and
sake).  In our standard advertising packet is a list of rules, an entry
form, bottle forms and a judge registration form.  We need entries, judges
and stewards!


The competition will be held at


                        Boneyard Brew-Off
                        c/o Joe's Brewery
                        706 S. Fifth St.
                        Champaign IL, 61820.


The judging will commence at 9:00am.  We will need two unmarked 10 to 16 oz.
brown or green bottles, with bottle identification forms attached to each
bottle with a rubber band, a completed entry form and $5 sent to Joe's
brewery for each entry.  We would appreciate entries as soon as possible
after July 6, but we will accept walk-on entries as long as they are
accompanied by the completed paperwork.  Four or more entries by the same
brewer qualify for our special, low, low rate of $4 per entry.


As in our last competition, the highlight will be our special category: The
No One Gets Out Alive High Gravity Brew-Off.  In this category we will judge
any beer with a gravity over 1.070 purely on the basis of drinkability and
octane.  We will allow any high gravity style, but if you wish the beer to
also be judged in another category, you must separately enter it in that
category.  No fortification of the beer is allowed.  The winners in this
category will not be eligible for best of show.


Those who contribute their judging expertise will reap many rewards. This
includes a beer sodden tour of Joe's Brewery, a bed for the night (make a
note on the judge form if you need a place to stay) and lunch on Saturday.
For those who wish to come on Friday, we plan to have a party on Friday
night featuring the efforts of our local brewers.

No, Ive never suggested this approach.  I recommend cutting the bed or

Subject: Malt Mills (somebody stop me!)


Jake and I have an adjustable JSP MaltMill, which we bought from Al Korzonas 
(before he stopped selling them, I guess).  Works great.  Wouldn't mind a 
bigger hopper, though.  Also - I wouldn't recommend getting an adjustable one.
More PITA than it's worth, IMO.  (Jake may disagree.)  


I've never gotten anything but a poor crush from a Corona.  Maybe I didn't
have it adjusted right, but I still think they suck.  (Easier than a rolling
pin, though.)  My girlfriend used to drive a Toyota Corona.  Great car.  I
wouldn't try to crush grain with it, though.  (Especially not after it died.)


Jack, I think you take criticisms of your product too personally.  It makes 
you look goofy, and it encourages you to use way too much bandwidth, which is
inconsiderate to everyone else who have such lovely posts they want to get
through.  And it encourages me to act like an old nag, and nobody likes that.

Well, I say joy and jubilation, for the HBD has been sort of boring lately,
and this may be just what is needed to liven things up. It's been so dull
that some members have gone on and on with aimless posts about plaid shirts,
etc.


I have been a HBD cruiser for about a year now and have enjoyed and
benefitted greatly from the various articles. I have missed Jack's posts and
I am glad to see he is back on a more regular basis.

I know that Jack just seems to get the goat of some of the posters and I
have heard some people express dismay about all of this as a waste of resources.


Not at all I say -- for here is a lesson in personality and manners (in real
time, almost) for everyone to see and evaluate.


My wife once asked me, Ron, how do you know the information you get on the
computer is accurate or true if anyone can just say whatever they want?  And
I told her that you just sort of get a feel for it.  True information and
facts hold up on their own, while dribble, hogwash, and bogeys have a way of
revealing themselves.


I see Jack's products proudly on display at the local homebrew shop.


I use Jack's EasyMasher (actually I made it from his plans) in my masher and
it is great.


Jack's MaltMill is probably used by some of the best homebrewers. (Ouch,
that buckshot almost got me).


I think Jack has presented the homebrew universe with a great maltmill, a
great easy mashing/sparging device, and a lot of good information here on
the HBD.  What can the goats claim they have done?

I recommend you first let satisfied customers point out errors in your
critics' assertions.  Unsolicited, unbiased testimonials are worth
a hundred of your posts and are much less taxing on the HBD.  As I
said in my post which apparently did not get to you in time, advertisements
are really bad form in the HBD.

I agree... don't try this at home.  That you have experienced no problems
with contamination either means that:


1. you have been blessed by God and could brew prize-winning beer from
spent laundry water,
2. you drank the beer before the contamination became obvious, or
3. you are not very sensitive to acidity and phenolic flavours/aromas and
you did not notice their presence.

Bingo!  Real ale brewers are not very anal retentive when it comes to
sanitation, but since their casks should be empty within three weeks of
brewing, infections don't have time to rise above human threshold levels.


We all brew infected beer -- we simply cannot make sterile wort in our homes.
The key is to keep the infections under control so that they don't become
noticeable.  Sanitizing the spoon, bottles, racking tube and bottlecaps would
be my suggested improvements, since you asked.

Lenny writes:
>Subject: How do I use TSP for sanitizing?


You don't.  It's not a sanitizer -- if you can get it (many communities
have outlawed phosphate-based cleaners) it's a good cleaner, but does
not sanitize.  You might be able to get chlorinated TSP which would
do some sanitizing.  If you can find out what the concentration of the
chlorine is in the solution, you can mix it to a level of 200 ppm of
free chlorine and use a 15 minute contact time.  I doubt that you could
find the data you need to figure out how much CTSP will give you 200ppm,
though.

I recommend 4 ounce of dried malt extract 32 fluid ounces of water,
boiled for 10 minutes, chilled to room temperature and aerated well.
If you use all-malt DME you won't need nutrients and personally, I
don't use hops in my starters.

I would have to see it to believe it.  I've seen malt crushed with many
different Coronas and the bottom line is that either the husks are damaged
siginificantly or there are many uncrushed kernels.  The Corona works by
rubbing one ridged plate against another plate and this, by itself, is
inherently problematic when trying to retain the integrity of the husks.


I know a commercial brewer that uses a motorized Corona.  His pale beers
tend to have a grainy character which I don't like.  On the other hand,
his dark beers are outstanding, IMO.  I'm just pointing this out because
powdered husks don't present as big a problem when the pH is low (as you
would get in dark beers).  You can brew prize-winning beer with a Corona,
but I personally feel that either you must sacrifice yield (crush coarsely)
or make VERY sure your pH is right on.

Fermentation gives off heat itself, as we know, and the thermal intertia
of 5 gallons of wort and another three pounds of glass is pretty high so
that a 10 degree drop in a day should not be a problem for most yeasts.
If the beer had dropped clear the next day and the FG read only 50% or 60%
of the OG, then I would say warm the fermenter and pitch more yeast, but
since it kept fermenting, I would say it's probably just fine.  65-68F
is a fine (ideal, some would say) temperature range for ales.  If you
usually ferment much warmer, you may be getting a lot of higher alcohols
in your beer, which for stronger beers could take a long time to mellow.

Question has occured to me about finings in the secondary if you repitch
slurry from the secondary.


I use polyclar in the secondary (1 to 1.5 Tbsp).  Last batch was pitched
from slurry of the previous batch's secondary.  Seemed more light bodied
than previous with that recipe, but I don't yet get good repeatability.


Any thoughts?  Should I skip repitching if I use polyclar?  Other finings?
(or should I just skip polyclar if I repitch?)

It has been interesting to read some of the comments regarding various features
of commercial mills and their purported effects on milling quality. I have
found in tinkering with my home made mill that playing with the spacing of the
rollers does not affect the yield much, but careful setting can dramatically
reduce the amount of flour produced.

All of the 2-row malts I crush (~8 different types over the last year)
require minimal adjustments from one type to the next. They would all
run well on my mill at the same 'nominal' setting.


Even so, I sometimes choose a clearance outside the 'nominal' range.
Sometimes for learning (i.e. how do runoff and extraction depend on
crush?) and other times because of grain. A good example is Cara-
Pils Malt (U.S. 6-row). The kernels are small and tough. I prefer a
smaller roller clearance for it. (For reasons unrelated to milling, I
rarely use this malt anymore.) As always, YMMV.


js,
Using the term "skewed brains" amounts to an ad hominem attack. It has
no place in rational discouse.
