Subject: FWH, O2 Bags


A lot of people have posted little or no hop aroma with FWH.  I made a
pilsener with whole saaz, 5 oz in 8 gallons, 25% FWH, 50% at the start of
the boil, the remaining 25% 30 minutes before strike.  The wort was
decoction mashed ans had an OG of 1.051.  Fermentation was done at 50F with
L09 from Yeast culture kit co.


The hops I used were whole flower Saaz, fresh from the O2 bag from Just
Hops.  Very nice hops.  The beer has a moderate hop aroma - very nice, with
no grassiness.  There is also a fairly strong hop flavor and bitterness,
again with no grassiness.




George Fix's original post on FWH implied that only the *finest* hops should
be used for FWH.  Maybe this is the difference.


- ----------------------------


O2 Bags-


I have a dazey vacuum seal-a-meal, and the vacuum is not particularly
effective. You'd do much better with a straw to suck the air out.  The
sealing part works well, and will reseal the O2 bags from Just Hops.  I
imagine it will reseal other O2 bags as well.


I am dismayed to hear that the bags in the vacuum seal-a-meal are not good
O2 bags.  What good is a vacuum sealer if the bags are not good bariers?

I think you are confused.  The MM never had a bad review.  You are
referring to a comment I made about a comment someone else made
about an EASYMASHER review in said magazine.  I did not see
the review and simply offered a gratitutous opinion.

Are you implying some connection between those number and
the MM?  If so, you need to elaborate.


>  I would much rather have a yeild of 31-35 pppg. 


One can change the yield that much just by using a different malt
or any number of  variable changes.


> That last 10 per cent is where a lot of the flavor
resides.


That I find very hard to believe and many would contend that
is where most of the evils lie.


 Aside from better flavor.  I paid for the malt and I will get
everything I can out of it.  


No one is discouraging you from doing that but what does it have 
to do with a MM.


>For doubting Tracy.  That was the crush I got with my poor old beat up,
terrrible Corona....


I have posted several times, a study I did comparing the Corona with
several variations of the MM.  It was actually a test of  the 
EASYMASHER because I used the Corona to make flour and I
wanted to see how the EM dealt with it.  Bottom line is, the yield
was about the same but the flour wort from the Corona was clearer.
You figure that one out.


I never claimed that you couldn't make good beer with a Corona and
people who buy rollers mills for that reason are being mislead.  Most
people like their MM's because it turns a chore into a really fun
part of brewing.  It's the right tool for the job and a pleasure to use.
The Corona is a compromise that works but is a pain in the butt
to use BUT it's cheap..

Look for a product called Keg Lube from Williams Brewing.  It is food grade 
and has the look and feel of Vasoline.  It worked great on my 5L kegs.  
Should be very good for your purposes.

It's both more interesting, and more sinister.


They are not surgically removing the leaves, the lupilin, the gizzards,
or anything of that sort to get at the hop's heart organ.


Instead, it is basically a waste product. Miller extracts the alpha-acid
from hops for use (admittedly, by the thimblefull per zillion-gallon
batch) in its regular beers such as MGD, High Life, etc. What is left
over is all this wet green vegetable material that was formerly
landfilled or used as garden mulch. Now they're brewing with it.


The end product is a remarkable brew. I have never before tasted a beer
which had such high hop flavor and such low hop bitterness, together. But
it makes sense when you know how it is made with the "Heart of the Hops".
I'm not saying new Miller Beer is good beer, or bad beer, but rather more
of a curiosity.

Subject: Causes of stuck runoff & haze in rye & wheat beers


     In HBD #2041 Guy Gregory states that it is the fine grain particles of 
     rye and wheat that cause stuck sparges and hazy beer.  This is not 
     entirely correct.  If the grain is milled too fine, then the small 
     particles will indeed clog the lauter tun (as Guy states).  If the 
     grains are milled properly, you can still experience trouble in the 
     lauter tun because of the high protein content of these grains (see 
     Eric Warner's book about Wheat Beers).  Rye is especially gummy 
     (protein gum, that is) but unmalted grains (like raw barley) are also 
     high in protein and can cause problems.  During malting, proteins are 
     degraded.  That's why you can skip the protein rest with highly 
     modified malts (like English Pale Malt) and not have any lautering 
     problems.
     
     The haze in these beers is also caused by the high protein content of 
     the grains, not by fine grain particles.  Remember that chill haze is 
     caused by protein-tannin complexes.  If fine particles were making it 
     all the way to your finished beer, they would cause more problems than 
     just haze!  Unconverted starch particles would leave the beer VERY 
     vulnerable to infection (because brewing yeasts don't metabolize 
     starch, but some bacteria do) and husk fines would very likely make 
     the beer unpalatably astringent.
     
     My wheat worts are quite clear before the boil-no fine particles are 
     getting through.  If you desire clear wheat and rye beers, use a 
     protein rest, a relatively long boil (good hot break), quick wort 
     chilling (good cold break), and cold-lager the beer to settle out the 
     chill haze (or filter it if you're in a rush).

Subject: Priming rates for Mini-Kegs


All,


I have just started using the approximate 1.25 gallon kegs. I was told
to prime with 1 level tablespoon of corn sugar / keg. The first keg I
tapped was/is flat. The beer conditioned for 2 weeks at room
temperature and then for 6 days in the fridge. The beer is a rather
heavy stout. Maybe it needed longer to condition. Now to my
questions...


1.) Is the 1 level tablespoon the right amount?


2.) I boiled about 1/2 cup of water and disolved the sugar
    in the water and added to the keg as the beer was being siphoned
    into the keg. Right or wrong procedure? Too much water?
    Don't use water at all...? Just add dry sugar to keg...?


Please advise.....I'm tired of bottlin'!!


Thanx................


d:-)

I work at a company which produces filtered, pastuerized, and 
concentrated juices from raw fruits.  I am experimenting with the proper
dilution rates for wines.  I dilute down to single strength presently, 
then add sugar to bring the specific gravity up to where I want it.  I 
am using the acids to adjust the total acid content to 0.60%.  As far as 
costs go, I get the sugars, juice concentrates and chemicals for free as 
samples.  My cost is in the equipment and time.  I have been told that 
1/3 to 1/2 cup per 5 gallons for bottle priming will work, haven't tried 
it yet.  Just did a batch of red cherry wine today!  Hope it's good.


Thanks for your reply, will have to try your recipe, I have some grapes 
growing every year (small patch maybe 50 lbs.)

50 people in the club, all "non-subscribers".  Does this mean that              
us 50 can't post if this plan goes through, what's to prevent                   
someone for subscribing for a day, posting his ad, then unsubscribing.

Well I just gotta toss in my $.02.  


I totally agree that this is not the place for advertisements, but taking it
to the other extreme, I implore you not to support ANY type of censorship.
This talk about unsubscribing someone is silly - they can just re-up if they
want - even under another or an assumed name!  If someone REALLY wants to
mess with the digest - or an individual - they're gonna find a way to do it.
Flame throwers and spam hurlers should just be ignored, and MAYBE they'll go
away.  Of course, maybe they won't, but that's the price, blah, blah.  


Especially now that the AoB has taken the reins (and this is NOT an AoB
slam!), imagine if somebody formed the _Nat'l_Homebrewers_Association_ (can
you see it - the Superbowl of Homebrew!), but they weren't allowed to post
to HBD because they're "the enemy!"  That would be silly.  


We must be tolerant - - and allow even stupid people to participate!

Subject: The Great Crabtree Debate....


        Al talks about the crabtree effects and notes that this still
occurs with maltose.  However, malt extract contains other sugars than
maltose and other simple sugars.  In my opinion, and it is only an opinion,
the crabtree effect is irrelevent with the levels of sugars added to 
bottle condition.  Yeast health is probably far more important.  I have found
far better and faster bottle conditioning, when I add a small (250 ml) starter
to 20 litres of beer for bottle conditioning.  Conditioning will take place 
very rapidly.  As for oxygen, I would suspect that a healthy yeast from an
all malt starter would likely very quickly assimilate any oxygen in a head 
space in a bottle of beer.


        On adding Dextrose to beer....


        I made a Duvel clone with two (reputedly) different strains of the 
Duvel yeasts.  Duvel is mashed to about 1.058 and then the gravity is raise
to the 1.070's with dextrose.  For fear of Crabtree with the very high levels 
of dextrose to be added, I prepared a very large starter (2.5 litres) with 
45 litres of beer. I pitched this in a conventional gravity 1.058 wort, well 
oxygenated, and got a very happy ferment going.  My thoughts were to get a 
vigorous ferment and then add liquid dextrose...wrong!  I added the Dextrose
and the ferment virtually came to a halt.  It took 3 weeks for the yeast to
finally poop out and as it was still sweet, I ended up finishing the beer
with some Celis yeast which I had collected from a Primary.  This finished 
quickly.


        The moral to the story is...make a small beer first and pitch all
of this yeast into a strong beer made with dextrose.  BTW this beer was 
bottle conditioned with fresh Duvel yeast and was fully conditioned in 5 days. 
The resulting beer was judged quite close to Duvel and in a side-by-side blind
taste test with the real duvel, judges, thought the real "Duvel" tasted 
"old", which may have been the case.  Both were bottled in Duvel bottles with
Duvel caps.

Subject: Hydrogen sulfide


I brewed my first batch of wheat beer this last weekend and have noted
an odor of hydrogen sulfide from the fermentation:
8 lbs. DeWolf Cosyns Pils malt
8 lbs. Great Western white winter wheat
Infusion mash at 155 F with 1 tsp gypsum
Chilled wort split into 2 carboys - total 11 gallons, O.G. 1.042
2 quart starter Wyeast #3068 pitched into each carboy
Fermentation began quickly at 65 F


There has been a strong hydrogen sulfide odor throughout the
fermentation.  Is this characteristic of this particular yeast strain or
is there another cause for this?  Will this eventually be purged by CO2;
if so, long will this take?

Subject: Carbonator (TM) trick


  Hola, zymurgists,  I'm back from an extended lack of anything useful to 
write about!  I'm up to early April with my HBD readings (that durned 
vacation set me back big-time), so if this is common knowlege I apologize...


  In reply to Art McGregor's Carbonator post of April 9th or thereabouts.  
Paraphrasing:  "Carbonators are expensive and I don't wanna give 'em out to 
my friends".  Here's my as-yet unpatented method ;-)


  After pressurizing the bottle, you refrigerate it to help the CO2 go into 
solution and you shake the bottle occasionally.  Once it's "fully carbonated"
(mine tends to end up "fizzy" - lack of practice?), shake the bottle again to 
get a good head of foam at the top and transfer the bottle to the freezer.  
It may take a re-shake or two until the temperature gets low enough, but with 
minimal effort you can get a "plug" of frozen foam at the top of the bottle.  
Pray silently, then quickly unscrew the Carbonator and replace it with the 
original plastic cap.  Now you're ready to go on the road with 
fully-disposable-beer-gear.
  I'll now vanish silently into the ether; hope that helps someone.

Subject: re:immersion chiller dimensions


Hello All,


Greg King in HBD 2039 inquired about immersion chiller diameter and efficiency.
I just completed mine with recommendations from my father-in-law, who has been
working in the nuclear powerplant industry, pump division, specializing in heat
transfer.


He reports that the difference in efficiency of  1/4" O.D. and 3.8"O.D. copper
tubing is nil, given the  length of tubing required and the flow of water at the
rate that homebrewers use (mostly straight from the tap).  The most important
considerations in the construction of the chiller are:


1) to have the input end of the tube enter the coil from the top (heat rises).


2) build the coil diameter large enough to facilitate stirring.


3) build the maximum surface area of tubing that will fit in the boiling vessel
as long   as the  entire coil structure remains submerged.


4) for those using a pump (I use a 3gl/min submersible in an icebath after  10
min     of  pumping  straight tap water)  you must route the input tube to a
height      of 24     inches  above the pump, then into the coil structure.
This is to maintain the              proper resistance for the pump.


Also, I use SS hose clamps to attach plastic tubing to the ends of the chiller
for input from the pump and output to the sink.  With my boiler mostly covered,
my drop in temp (5gal) goes from boiling to 70F in  ~20 min.  I only uncover the
pot to stir.  


Hope this helps,

Subject: Re: All grain vs. Partial extract


>>Are there any easy ways to brew all grain with out having to buy all
of the equipment?


I made the jump to all grain for about $50 dollars.  I have brewed 4 
all grain batches to date.  My extraction rate is on the low side at 
27-28 pts*lbs/gal. My ability to brew specific styles has taken a 
quantum leap and my all grain batches are the best I have made.


I have the grain crushed at my local homebrew store so I don't have 
to buy a grain mill.  I bought a 8 gallon enamal brew pot (slightly 
dented) for $29.00.  My 6.5 gallon bottling bucket has a 3/4" threaded 
spigot; so I created a square manifold (with drilled holes in the 
manifold sections) out of PVC for $5.00.  I mash the grains in the brew 
pot and sparge in my bottling bucket with manifold.  I borrow my 
neighbors cajun cooker to mash and boil the wort (if purchased it costs 
about $39.00).  You can do it on the stove, but it takes forever to 
heat large volumes of water.  When sparging, I heat the sparge water in 
my brew pot and trasfer it to anouther bucket ($10 dollars) to free up 
my brew pot for collecting the wort.  Total cost was about $45 dollars 
or $85 with the cajun cooker (I prefer the neighbor approach myself).


The manifold design was based upon an early post to the HBD a few years
ago.  The design uses a 3/4" threaded to 3/4" smooth elbow, three 3/4" 
smooth elbows, a 3/4" cap, and 4 sections of 3/4" PVC pipe.  I took 3 
sections of 3/4" PVC pipe (approx 4.5 inches each) and drilled three 
rows of 7/32" holes in on the bottom of each piece.  The section from 
the spigot/threaded elbow to the first smooth elbow (approx 3.5 inches) 
does not require holes.  The manifold should sit snug in the bottom 
of the bottling bucket.  The PVC elbows keep the manifold sections about 
a 1/8 inch off the bottom.  Make sure the holes are facing down.  Do 
not glue the pieces together, they should fit together snug and are 
very easy to clean after each batch by disassembling and reassembling 
the manafold.  Put together it looks like the diagram below.


      |_| <-- 3/4" threaded spigot
      |_| <-- 3/4" threaded to 3/4" smooth elbow
       |____
   |        |
   |        |  <-- 3 elbows + 1 cap + 4 sections of 3/4" pipe
   |        |
   |________|




I hope this helps in your quest for all grain brewing on a budget.  All grain
brewing takes me about 5 hours compared to 2 hours for extract, but the beer
is much better.  Have fun.

Subject: liquid yeast woes


Hi folks.  I just tried liquid yeast for the first time (Wyeast 1272 - 
American Ale II).  I followed the advice I received from the collective 
and made a starter, which never got very active over the 2 days it sat.
I pitched it yesterday, and I'm finally seeing some activity.  My 
question is, is the starter (I used a 22 oz. bottle, a couple tbsps. of 
malt extract, and some hops) supposed to ferment vigorously?


I noticed some krausen, which died down quickly.  When the starter is 
pitched into the fermenter, should fermentation commence quickly?


I'm not sure if I was anal retentive enough about sanitization with 
regards to the starter bottle.  I've been advised so many different ways 
from so many different people (and I appreciate all of the help!).


My second question pertains to my hydrometer readings, which are usually 
discrepant with the recipe or the calculated gravity.  This time I boiled 
about 3.5 gals of wort and tried to mix as well as I could with the 
water in the fermenter.  Suds4.0 gave me a O.G. of 1.046, yet my reading 
was about 1.038 (after cooling below 80 deg.)
This has happened with most of my batches.  Has anyone had similar 
experiences?


Thanks again

Subject: Pressure drop in hose


Jay Reeves asks about pressure drop in hoses.


Again, the simple answer to this question is that if your keg is at 12
psi, then the pressure drop from the keg to your glass is always 12 psi,
regardless of your hose length.  It is not possible to specify a pressure
drop per foot of hose, as the pressure drop per foot is dependant both
upon hose diameter AND flow rate.
It is surprising that you needed to increase your tubing length to 16' in
order to reduce your flow rate enough to cause foaming.  Perhaps
something else is causing your foaming?  What type of tap are you using?
Do you have fittings or obstruction in your flow path?  What is your flow
rate (How long does it take to fill a 12 oz glass)?

Subject: Dry Hopping


Dear Friends, in #2041 C.D. Pritchard reported that out of his 30+
batches, he has had one infection, which he attributes to
dry-hopping, and said he will never dry hop again.  Well... consider
the thousands and thousands of dry-hopped batches represented by the
collective experience of the HBD, and the exceedingly small
frequency of any problems (I have yet to hear of a *single* one that
can definitely be attributed to dry hopping) and I think this
conclusion is a bit hasty.  C.D., I do not doubt your conclusion
that your batch was infected and that you take every precaution to
reduce the risk of contamination.  But to conclude that dry hopping
should never be tried again seems just a bit premature to me.


Yes, hops are a product of agribusiness and cannot be trusted to be  
squeaky clean.  Yes, you can get good results from hop teas.  But 
there is something about dry hopping, intangible though it may be, 
that is achievable no other way.


All I'm saying is maybe try it a few more times, see how it goes... 
an infected batch is no fun but a good dry-hopped beer is simply 
wonderful, and no one should be deprived of such a thing.  The weight 
of experience, from homebrew to micro scale, is *drastically* in 
favor of the notion that the risk of infection is very low.

My guess is that since Miller is (I'm told by people in the hop trade) using 
hop extracts/oils, not whole or pellets, they are using this as an advertising 
ploy to call these extracts "the heart of the hop", ie, extracts use only the 
essence, the heart of the hops.


The breweries that use hop extract, buy the stuff in 55 gal drums.  They can 
control quite precisely the amount, the bitterness, aroma etc., without any 
waste.  I have heard that among the breweries that use hop oil/extracts are:
Heiniken, Miller and several of the Japanese breweries.

Intuatively AND in my experience, this theory that "trapped air is 'used
up' no further deterioration..." is false.  Especially in whole hops, there
is more than enough air (and therefore oxygen) left in the bags to deteriorate
the hops SIGNIFICANTLY.  This is especially true of the hop aromatics.


If you don't own a CO2 tank, get one of those sport bottles, pull the straw
out an inch or two, add a teaspoon of baking soda and two tablespoons of
distilled vinegar (heck, you can use AlkaSeltzer and water if you want),
seal up the bottle and then direct the escaping CO2 into your bag of hops.
Incidentally, if you need to buy O2 barrier bags, I'm sure you can buy them
from either Freshops (541-929-2736) or Just Hops (217-864-4216).
[No affiliation, actually, if I did mailorder, they would be competetors!]


Secondly, Mark's book, articles and posts are the *only* places I have
seen any mention of light negatively affecting hops.  When Mark initially
posted this idea on HBD, I asked Dr. Alfred Haunold (the world's foremost
hop researcher and developer of Mt. Hood, Liberty and many other new hops)
whether light negatively affects hops.  His response was "they may lose
a little green colour, but their brewing capabilities are unaffected.
Think about it... the hops spend all summer in the sun!!!

When you mentioned Coopers Sparkling Ale, that rang a bell in my head.
This beer has a rather strong phenolic aroma/flavour.  I have tried
many different varieties of those "100% fruit" extracts and every
one of them seems to have a little of that sort of phenolic/medicinal
aftertaste.  Furthermore, many of them are rather bitter.  I was
experimenting with them by adding them to finished beer with a pipette.
By the time I put enough in to get an acceptable flavour/aroma, the
beer was too bitter and took on that phenolic/medicinal character.
Some people have reported success with them, but I've yet to taste
a good homebrewed or commercial beer made with fruit extracts.


This weekend, at the International Beer Exposition in Chicago, there
were two raspberry beers I had not tasted yet.  One was from Estes Park
Brewing Co. and the other from Big Buck Brewing Co.  The EPBC beer
was made with extract and the BBBC with real fruit.  In my opinion,
the difference was striking.  The real fruit beer was far superior,
in fact, I told the server "this is made with extract" or "this is made
with real fruit" and they confirmed.  There are others: Samuel Adams
Cherry Wheat (extract), Brimstone Brewing Blueberry Ale (real fruit).

As there are various grades of maltrodextrin is one more suitable than another?

Well, either no one is downloading BW2.0 or they didn't notice (as one person
pointed out to me) that the BREWATER.HLP file does not copy from the install
directory!  I've updated the ZIP file (still 2.0); you can manually copy
BREWATER.HLP into your BreWater directory.

Hey all, 


Does anyone here have an opinion on a good grain mill to buy?
