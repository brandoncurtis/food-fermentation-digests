I have just built a counter flow bottle filler and I was wondering if 
anyone had any info on how much carbonation I should have so that the 
beer comes out ok in the bottle. I have a gauge that fits my keg so I 
can control the amount of co2 build up. (I was planning on conditioning
the beer naturally.)

Subject: immersion chiller summary


Hello HBDfolk,


Here is a summary of the replies I received regarding a question I posted
last week about the optimal dimensions for an immersion chiller.  The original
question was:


>I am going to build an immersion chiller, and would like to get your ideas
>(or hard data if you have it) regarding the best size of copper tubing to
>use (apologies if this is a topic that has been beaten to death at an earlier
>time).
>
>The 3/8" O.D. and 1/2" O.D. tubing seem to be popular choices.  I'm considering
>the narrower 1/4" O.D. tubing because the surface-to-volume ratio is greater
>for narrower tubing than it is for wider tubing (for a given volume of water).
>My thinking is that in the narrower tubing more of the water will come into
>contact with the hot copper surface, and more heat will be transferred to the
>water.
>
>Of course theory is one thing, and reality is sometimes another thing.  How do
>your real-life experiences correspond with this idea?


I mentioned only tubing diameter, and several respondents brought up two
other important factors: length and throughput.  There is a much higher
resistance to flow in the 1/4" tubing compared to 3/8" or 1/2" tubing, so a
higher pressure is required to achieve the same throughput in 1/4" tubing.
This means all the fittings (i.e. hose clamps, etc.) have to withstand this
higher pressure also.


To get the same volume of water flowing through chillers with different
tubing diameters, the chiller with the narrower tubing must be longer.
The relationship is inversely proportional to the square of the tubing
diameters.  For example, 3/8" tubing is 1.5 times wider than 1/4" tubing,
so the length of the 1/4" tubing chiller must be 1.5*1.5 = 2.25 times
longer than the 3/8" tubing chiller to hold the same volume of water.


In constructing an immersion chiller, the tubing is most commonly wound
around a cylindrical object like a paint can to produce a coil that looks
like a bed spring.  Three alternatives to this configuration were mentioned:


1) Wind the tubing into a tighter coil (2.5" diameter) to produce a chilling
   "wand".  The wort is then manually stirred with the wand.


2) Wind the tubing into a tighter inner coil surrounded by an outer coil.


3) Wind the tubing into a 2-dimensional spiral, and then rig it so that
   the chiller is suspended (flat) about 1-2" from the top of the hot wort.
   This arrangement apparently creates a convection current within the
   wort, thus reducing (or eliminating) the need to stir/agitate the wort
   while it's cooling.




Recap:
The consensus was that a good immersion chiller can be made from 1/4", 3/8"
or 1/2" tubing, keeping in mind that chillers made with narrower tubing
should be longer than those made with wider tubing, with fittings that must
be able to withstand higher pressures.


Also, when comparing two chillers with equal diameter tubing but different
lengths, the longer chiller is better.


Thanks to all who replied!

Subject: barrier bags


My 2 cents on O2 barrier bags...Barrier bags are typically more than one 
layer either colaminated or coextruded. They ALL transmit oxygen, CO2, etc, 
but some at slower rates than others. "Baggie" (even heat-sealed) are 
relative window screens when it comes to keeping gasses in or out. The 
inside of barrier bags is typically heat-sealable and the outside not. 
Because of this you can seal some barrier bags very well with an iron (yes, 
like you iron clothes with). Don't try it with a "baggie" though, these are 
one material (polyethylene) all the way through and will seal instantly TO 
your iron.  I've been sealing bags that have a zipper about 5/8" down from 
the top so I can seal the bag hermetically with an iron above the zipper and 
it stays sealed 'rill I tear the seal off. Then I still have the zipper to 
open and close the bag with.  Some zippers do have pin-holes at the ends but 
these zippers are bonded tight all the way to the ends with no pin-holes. If 
anyone's interested in trying out "my" bags, send me a SASE and I'll send 
you a couple.

Subject: Raspberry / Fruit Tips?


I'm planning a 10 gallon batch of wheat beer this weekend and want to make a
raspberry wheat out of half of it (I use 2 fermenters...)


Looking for tips on how much fruit to use and how best to use it:


- - I've heard 1 lb per gal? More? less?
- - Add to the Primary or Secondary?  How long?
- - Steep or just dump 'em in? How to steep?
- - Frozen, Fresh, Concentrate or Extract?


E-mail is fine; I'll post a summary.


Thanks!

I vote for this too.  Limiting who can post in this way doesn't prohibit

I agree.


- ------------
About rye, is the stuff generally sold in brewing supply stores malted rye
 or unmalted rye?  Or does it depend?  I assume rye flakes are unmalted.


- -----------
Now my real question.
Does anyone have any comments about the Zymurgy road test of 
counterpressure bottle fillers from last summer or so?  Anyone want to
really recommend the one they use?
One thing I didn't understand in the article is the air reports.  They
expressed air as a percentage, + or -, of the baseline, which was 2 ml.
The "worst case" bottle filler was just filling a bottle from the picnic
tap, which causes a lot of CO2 loss but also adds air.  The test
results on the beer were -30% air.  Why minus?  I read this as 30%
less air than the 2 ml. baseline.  This can't be right.  
Although I don't know the numbers, I have to assume that minus is
bad and plus is good.  The expensive fillers all come out on the plus
side.


The one filler I've seen in operation, a homeade job, had a connector
on the pressure release valve so tubing could be attached.  You will
almost always get some foaming as you fill a bottle, so you might want
to let some of that foam escape through the pressure release valve
and into a jar or bucket.  Will all the fillers described allow this, or
will you get into trouble if more than just gas escapes through the 
pressure release valve.  


Based on the article, I'm leaning towards the cheaper Benjamin
Machine product or the Braukunst.

Subject: A new pre-chiller idea


HBDers,
With the weather heating up 'round here, I'm breaking out the small pre-chiller
copper coil which I usually submerge in ice water _prior _ to the water going
into the large chiller inside the keg.  In the past summers, this technique
worked
pretty well.


Well the other day as I was chillin' down a brew I got to thinkin'.  Last year I
came up with
this insane idea of making a micro-chiller out of 1/4" copper to fit inside a
2000ml
Ehrlemeyer flask to chill down my starter worts.  It's about the size of a
Philly cheesesteak
(local plug).  I attached a compression type 1/2"
hose barb to the chiller ends so I could hook it up to a hose attached to my
kitchen
sink.  I tried it once and that was it.  Too long to cool and too much trouble. 
I now just
boil the 1/2 gallon starter wort in a 5 gallon pot and cool in the sink.


So here's my idea to make good use of that micro-chiller.  purge all the water
out of it,
stick it in a large plastic cup or mug, fill mug with water, then stick in
freezer.  the water
will freeze with the chiller submerged.   When you're ready to chill down, just
take the micro-chiller out of the freezer and hook it up to the main chiller. 
All the water passing thru
should be close to freezing.  It eliminates the bulky pre-chiller and the use of
tons of ice. 


I'm off to Bavaria for 3 weeks on the 22nd, so when I get back and I still have
some brain
cells left and I _still_ want to look at beer, I'll give the micro-chiller a
test run.

No, there is no way to calibrate it. However, the problem you describe is
fairly common. I own three Hunter airstats, and they have all displayed this
behavior at one point.


What you need to do is replace the battery in the unit (size AA I think).
Press the very small and very recessed RESET button (you'll need something
like a straightened paper clip), and re-program it. Works every time.

Subject: Yeast question...


Greetings!


A question for the brewing collective... A friend of mine brewed this 
past weekend. The yeast he used was a new pack of WYeast London Ale yeast 
that had been stepped up to about 2 cups. The picthing temperature of 
the wort was about 77F, and the surprisingly warm weather (spring has 
*finally* arrived in Montreal!) kept it a that temperature for the 
remainder of the fermentation period... 48 hours after pitching, the SG 
was 1.010! There will undoubtedly be some fruity notes in this brew, but 
his/my real question is whether the yeast can be safely re-used? The 
intention was to re-pitch the yeast in a gallon of wort, bottle the 
yeasty beer and keep it refrigerated for future use...
Can you guys tell me whether the fact that the fermentation was a wee bit 
too warm, and that it finished soooo fast can/will affect future batches 
of beer made with this yeast? Is this yeast still good, or is it likely 
to have mutated?


Thank in advance for the info...

Dazey (Of Seal-A-Meal fame) makes one that sells for $50.00US.  It works
pretty good, but lacks some of the bells 'n whistles of the FoodSaver unit.

requested to be present by 9:00am for final assignments.


Bed and Brew

Valley Forge, The Sly Fox and the Lancaster Malt Brewing Company in addition 
to the fine Victory Brewing Company so come in early the day before and tour 
the breweries in the area.   BUZZ club members are opening their homes for 
those traveling from some distance who would like to have a place to stay 
for Saturday June 29th and Sunday June 30th.  Please indicate your desire to 
have a place to stay on the Judge/Steward Registration Form and you will be 
contacted several weeks prior to the contest.

Subject: 1996 Small & Tiny results (at last!)


The 1996 Small & Tiny homebrew competition turned out to be pretty
small and tiny itself.  I blame this on insufficient publicity efforts
on my part (we'll do better next year, or we won't do it -- I've
learned my lesson).  But, many of our 15 entries were very good to
excellent, with three of the winners scoring over 40 points.  If your
beer placed it was because it was a good beer.


Due to the small number of entries, the categories were collapsed
back to the original 2: small and tiny.


SMALL BEERS (OG 1.035 - 1.043)
- ----------------------------------------------------------------
1st        Bill Holmes                        English Special Bitter
2nd        John P Skryski III and IV        Honey Ginger Wheat
3rd        John P Skryski III and IV        Brown Ale


TINY BEERS (OG < 1.035)
- ----------------------------------------------------------------
1st        Tom Dimmer                        American Amber
2nd        Stephen Klump                        English Ordinary Bitter
3rd        Bill Holmes                        Cream Ale


BEST OF SHOW went to Tom Dimmer for his excellent "Tiny American
Amber".  This beer had a wonderful malty nose and was exceptionally
drinkable, although it was a tough pick between it and the "small" bitter.


I apologize for the delay in getting results out, and can only plead
work pressures.  Score sheets (but probably not ribbons) will be in
the mail by this weekend.  I will post some winning recipes in coming
weeks, as time permits.


My thanks to all of you who took the time and effort to enter your
beers, and to Dan McConnell and Paul Philippon for judging.

Subject: RE: Gas leaks


In hbd #2042 Howard asked about some kind of grease for keg gaskets.  I use
a keg lube from Williams Brewing at (800) 759-6025.  It is $3.90 for a
1 oz. container of what appears to be silicone grease.  That seems high
but it goes a long way and I could not readily find another source.
The important thing is that it has worked very well for me.  I use it on all
the o-rings with particular attention to the lid ring.  It really seems to
help seal my kegs.  Also, the grease on the qd post rings helps attach lines
without binding.  I would recommend it or an equivalent.  Of course, as with
all mail order, don't forget the cost of delivery.

Subject: More Foam Finds


Domenick Venezia dropped me an E-mail with an excellent suggestion for
finding foam for Chillers:
************************
Ken,


Refridgerators and freezers are shipped in large boxes lined with 2" 
styrofoam slabs.  I know because as a biotechnology company we buy a lot of
refridgerators and freezers.  My guess is that most household appliances
are similarly shipped.  Someone looking for styrofoam sheets might want to
visit an appliance store dumpster or just ask if they could save some
for you.

************************


So you see, there is a wide range of possible places from which to obtain the
stuff.  Hospitals (as I mentioned), appliance stores, industrial facilities,
machine shops, etc, are all good places to start.   My local insulation
supplier will part with a brand new 4x8 sheet of 2" extruded polystyrene for
$25.44 plus tax.


I'm working on an alternate cut plan to allow construction of a Chiller which
will accomodate a 7-gal bucket as well as the 6 - 7 gal carboys.  The
footprint is only slightly larger than the current layout; 19" x 27".  It
appears that the size may allow up to *four* jugs of ice to be used, which
will extend the time between changes and/or allow operation at lower
temperatures.  Being an ale man, I haven't tried lagering in it, but a friend
was able to maintain 55F wort temperature without running the thing full-on,
with 2 jugs of ice.  In the interim I've posted bucket.gif in my ftp site;
it's my preliminary layout for the larger unit (still fits on a 4x8 sheet).
 Once I've built another one and made sure it's sized correctly I'll rewrite
the CHILLER.ZIP document to include it as well as other info I've collected
since releasing the design.

Subject: Attenuation or Loss of Mass?


Here's a technical (and probably useless) question for you yeast
gurus (cross-posted to r.c.b and the h.b.d)


How much of the apparent attenuation in a fermenting wort is
actually due to alcohol production, and how much can be
attributed to production of bio-mass (dead yeast) (and also mass
loss through CO2 evolution)? 


Based upon the amount of yeast I find on the bottom of my
primaries, I would imagine that this represents a significant
proportion. And as we're all aware ;) , CO2 production from a
vigorous ferment is not exactly trivial, although I wouldn't
imagine that a lot of _mass_ gets lost.


Who knows ???

     Hello brewseekers,
     
     For those of you who hve built a brewery in your home, what one detail 
     would you change if you had it to do over again? 
     
     I am designing my brewery now and have gotten some excellent ideas 
     from those who have looked at my page 
     (http://www.dnh.mv.net/ipusers/peanut/brewbild.htm) and written to me. 
     I hope to have some new additions to the site this week. I am working 
     on a drawing right now of the plumbing for the set up. I am wanting to 
     make a manifold that I can use to transfer fluids from one vessel to 
     another using only one pump, or one pump and gravity. Any thoughts?
     
     Thanks,

Does anyone have a suggestion for obtaining bottles to house my "Beloved

Ideally, the typical nip bottles would be great, but, I don't know where to
find them.


I think a twelve ouncer will be too large and, altho' consuming a case of
Grimbergen small guys sounds like a party, there's got to be another way!


I've got a 2 1/2 gallon batch dry hoppin right now, so I've got a little
time, but I want to "put it up" pretty soon.

Subject: Ants in the Air-Lock


My carboys are on the floor of the garage because it's 
cooler there.  (Californians don't have basements.)  Two 
days ago I noticed a stream of ants making a beeline for the 
carboys, so I pulled out my can of Raid and let 'em have it. 
(I think they got tired of drinking 12 ounces of Bud at the 
old ant hill and were going for the 5-gallon sized Weizen.)  
Last night I found about a dozen ants had crawled into the 
air-lock and died.  I don't know if they were Raided or not 
before they went swimming, but I assume so.  Is my beer 
ruined?  ;-)
It's just an air-lock, a "one-way" valve of sorts, without 
beer contact, so there shouldn't be any problem, right?
My two questions are:
1.  Should I leave the ants (and risk nano parts per million 
Raid contamination) or should I remove the ants (and risk 
ordinary air-nasties contamination)?
2.  Has anyone done a study on fumes passing through 
air-locks?  For example, auto exhaust (being in the garage 
and all that.)
Thanks,   Ken Koupal     krkoupa`at`ccmail2.pacbell.com

Hey all, 


Does anyone here have an opinion on a good grain mill to buy?


I mean what are the differences really?


Is a roller mill better than a plate mill???


How bout my coffee grinder? Is this a good way to mill my grain?


Anybody here make their own mills and sell them?

Subject: HELP: Water filters?  Water treatment?


I live in St. Louis, where we have, according to the EPA, an excessive
amount of carinogens in our water (due to fertilizer and pesticides).
Also, as many of the houses around here were built before The
Depression, much of the plumbing (including, I believe, my house) has
lead in the piping.


I want to buy a water filter -- one of those cylinders that goes
in-line with my faucet (i.e. not a Brita filter that holds less than a
gallon at a time, and which I need to fill up).  Does anyone have
recommendations which one I should buy?  How much will this thing
cost?  Is there anything I need to do to my water (minerals) in order
to make up for the filtering when I brew?


        Thanks,

Subject: The Move


Unfortunatly there seem to be a few technical problems with the move.
I am working on them as we speak.


1.  Our computer is sending mail slowly, but as far as I know it is
getting to everyone on the list, just a bit slowly.  I am working on
our system's mailer configuration to improve performance.


2.  Digest #2042 was large.  This is due to the conversion from Rob's
system to majordomo and 4 users mail size limits were exceeded.  The
size has dropped and the digest has been moved from 6 days/week to 7
days/week to try to combat large digests.  I intend to pay attention to
size and limit it if necessary.


3.  The digest does not respond to new submissions like it used to.  I
intend to add an acknowledgement message, but that will have to wait
until I get the e-mail speed problem solved.


I hope to have everything working more normally very shortly and I
apologize for any glitches.

Subject: Keeping the hose on your chiller


If you have (or have access to) a flaring tool for copper tubing 
you can work a small flare onto the end of the tube where you 
attach the pressure hose.  By then clamping behind the flare you 
should be able to keep the hose on.  Just don't flare too much 
or the increase in diameter will prevent your attaching the hose.

Subject: AHA NHC Bashing


My post on the results coming from Florida has fostered a number of posts
very critical of the AHA. It was my intent to be critical of the
organizers who I feel were at fault. Suggestions that the AHA find better
organizers and/or sites with a plethora of judges is a gross
oversimplification of the effort required to run the NHC.


The Washington, DC, area has a plethora of judges AND experienced
organizers. The AHA approached several of us in the area about organizing
a 1st round NHC regional site. There were no takers, and the AHA was
forced to seek other sites. Why were there no takers?


Members of my club (we're small) cited risk of financial ruin (the AHA and
the regional organizers operate on a very tight budget) as one of two main
reasons. The other was that it is a bunch of work, and they saw no payoff
for their efforts.


I suspect somewhat similar reasons were given by the area's megaclub.


I was willing to be an organizer, but the support just wasn't available
for such minor issues as a site, fund raising activities and the like.


Putting on one of these HBCs is a bear, folks. The Spirit of Free Beer in 
the spring and the Capitol District Open in the fall, plus usually one
single style competition already chews up a lot of the voluntary fervor of
the area. I just feel that the Florida organizers could have done better.


As for the scores I received, they don't bother me a bit. A win at one
competition says nothing about how that beverage will be perceived
elsewhere. I'm irked because I suspect the organizers did not tell the
obviously inexperienced judges that two of my entries were braggot, not
honey flavored rocket fuel (though I did enter one of those, too).


As for next year? Well, I'm going to spend some time seeing if maybe the
DC area has enough interest for a consortium of area clubs to organize a
1st round AHA NHC mid-Atlantic regional site. I'd like to see if we can do
better.


BTW, thanks, AHA for the NHC. I look forward to it every year - worts and
all.

I'm moving.  I need to find brewers, brewclubs, and supplies in my new home.
I will be relocating to Michigan.  My wife and I haven't decided exactly
where we will be, but my job is in Saginaw.  So, anybody out there that can
help make my relocation more pleasurable, please do so.  TIA

Sorry guys, when you mention one of my favourite commercial beers I have to 
make a comment.
As a good Adelaide boy I was weaned off mother's milk onto this stuff. I have
to say that it has a huge bottle variation, no doubt due to the bottle 
conditioning (it has *large* yeast deposits), and transport treatments.
Some samples (especially recently) are extremely phenolic, and that's been
noticed by our beer club members over the last year or so. (I am Sydney
based now). I find it hard to believe that you'd get any decent samples
at all in the US, due to the long transport times from Australia. The very 
best samples are the kegged ones, and these must be carefully handled
by the cellarmaster to be any good at all, anyway. 
Good samples are not phenolic, and *do* have a fruity apple/pear character.
Bad samples are really phenolic, and virtually undrinkable.
Coopers Sparkling Ale must be about the most temperamental beer on this earth.


Coopers doesn't travel!

I too have tried adding dextrose mid-ferment to Belgians for fear of Crabtree.
I agree it doesn't work, and is a great way to get a stuck ferment. When using
high dextrose concentrations, it seems to be best added in the boil, but even
then some yeasts just won't ferment out. I persisted with 3944 for a long time, 
tossing out batch after batch. (sob). The new Wyeast 1388 is supposedly one 
of the Duvel yeasts. I have a Duvel clone in the secondary now made in a similar 
way to Jim's (but with the sugar added to the boil) and had a good quick 
fermentation. Talk about low flocculation though!


BTW, Duvel is supposedly lagered around 0C for a few weeks as well, according
to Jackson.

This may seem like a dumb question, but have you calibrated your
hydrometer? Test your hydometer by taking a reading using distilled water.
It should read 1.000. If not, the difference is the correction factor you
need to add or substract to your measurements in the future.


Now, to the first question:

First, there really is no need to add hops to your starter. The lack of
activity in your starter is likely due to the amount of malt you used. A
couple of tablespoons is not enough. You need to use closer to a cup in two
cups of water. to start. With only two tbls, the yeast finished with the
sugar before you could have noticed and before it could reproduce to
sufficient numbers for pitching.
If you have the time and inclination, you should step up from the two cups
again before pitching. I usually don't, but the more yeast the better.

Subject: tea.. serious brew,  heart of the hops


I have only seen one mention of a "hop tea" while reading the FHW tread, I have tried the "hop tea" method and found it to work very well for both flavor and aroma.  At bottling time add the priming sugar to a quart of water, add .5 oz of you preferred hops and bring to a boil (1 min or so boil), add to the brew and bottle.  My experience is that this adds a prnounced hop aroma, no bitter and plenty of flavor (so much you might make it .25 oz).


Having said that, what experience does the group have with hop oil?  I have never tried it for dry hopping, is it worth the effort?


The heart of the hops ad (by Miller), they really only show someone holding a hop bud, it is as others have said, marketing BS.  I may try one though just to see if there is any hop taste....


BTW yes, it's my real name.

I made one myself from plans I found in the beer archives of AOL.  I think
those are the plans that you are referring to.  I don't have the name of
guy or the plans on this computer right now, but I can get them to you if
you wish.  Plus, I can give you some tips from my experience in making the
contraption.


Just some quick info:  There were two sets of plans, the first being how to
build the basic setup and the second on how to adjust the thermostat to get
the temps down to a lagering level.  It holds one five-gallon carboy with
airlock and two 1-gallon milk bottles of ice.  I find that it is great to
maintain good temperature control, especially during the summer, for both
ales and lagers for those of us in which it is impractical to get a second
fridge, i.e., living in an apartment, very little space, etc.  However, you
will need the second set of plans to have any success at getting down to
lager temps.  Even then, I find that the contraption will struggle to get
down to anything colder than around45-48 degrees F.  But that may have more
to do with my poor building skills than the design of the contraption :).

Subject: Keg Beer lines and Carbonator


Hi Every One!


I've only kegged two batches so far, but thought I should
chime in.  I've not had great success with the
3/8 od (1/4 id) vinyl hoes that came with the kegs. 
I feel safer with pressure at 10 psi, but the beer comes out as foam
at that pressure.  I needed to reduce the pressure down to 2-3 psi each
time  I would draw a beer.  However, after some reading, I bought 3/16
id vinyl tubing and just tonight tried it out.  I can keep the pressure
at 10 psi in the keg and get a good non-foam mug of beer.  I use about
4 ft of tubing.  The friction of the smaller diameter beer line is 
much higher for 3/16 id (I think around 2 or 2.2 psi/ft of hose versus
the 1/4 id hose I used before (around .6 psi/ft of hose).  So with around
4 ft of hose, the pressure needed to push the beer thru the line is 9-10
psi and so far (only one mug), it works much better.


My success with the carbonator has improved with filling the 2 liter
bottles.  I now pressurize to 30 psi, then put in freezer and shake 
every 30 min-hour.  When it starts to freeze, I remove carbonator, the screw
bottle cap on.  So far so good.  It is still much more of a process than I 
would like though ...


Hoppy Brewing! :^)
