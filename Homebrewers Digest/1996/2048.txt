        Three bucks is perfectly acceptable for a pint, but that's beside
the point.  If you're being sold a glass of beer, you should get a glass
of beer; investing tens of thousands of dollars in brewing equipment gives
nobody the right to rip off customers.  Considering the usage of "cheater"
pint glasses (look like ordinary pint glasses, they call 'em pint glasses,
but they hold 14 oz -- ha, ha, very funny) and other chicanery, you're
well within your rights to ask that a glass be filled completely (within
reason.) Take your cue from the bartender's behavior, not the waitress'.

Dan Aldrich asks about propane cookers that can hold the weight of

The Cajun Cooker is quite sturdy, 170,000btu, and about $45 at my 
local brew store.  The down side is that it is a jet burner, which 
IMO is inferior to the ring burners for controlling heat output.  I 
was always more likely to scortch my wort with the old jet burner.


Another alternative is to take the burner you have and build a
stronger frame for it.  I was at Sam's (Div. of WalMart) last night
and they have a little propane cooker for only $35.  The frame is
flimsy and would not hold up a brewing kettle, but the ring burner
is rated at 160,000 Btu and it could easily be removed from its
housing and attached to another frame of your choice.

>From: Charlie Scandrett <merino`at`cynergy.com.au>


>Scroll down unless you are interested in the finer points of crushing sizes,
perhaps we are crushing bores?


Ditto...


Your detailed critique of my dissertation  is cleary from the heart but
misguided on a fundamental premise...


>The object of six roller mills is *evenness* of crush.


Just where is that written?   And just what do YOU mean
by "evenness" as I doubt that any scientific description of the
job would choose that word.


The object of  milling (it doesn't matter what you use) is to provide
the prescribed statistical distribution of grist.  Evenness would imply
that each sieve would pass exactly the same amount of grist and 
you would end up with nice even piles.  This clearly is not the case
and therefore anyway one can achieve the "proper" quantity of each
specific grist size would be as good as any other if time were not
an issue.


If you crushed the malt with a rolling pin and trained monkies to pick
up the particles, weigh them and drop them into appropriate bins in
the agreed to numbers, you could achieve the "text book crush" if 
you just threw away what was not needed.


> If Jack were right, brewers would simply crush half the grist one 
setting and the other half at another setting and save themselves a 
lot of money in multi-stage mills!




That is not a good analogy but it would be a step in the right 
direction.  It would be better to run all the malt through at 
both settings.  A better analogy would be to run it through one 
pass with the rollers set to different spacings at each end.
This would provide an infinite number of different spacing
across the rollers and not just two as in your analogy.


To bring you back on course and hopefully end this thing,
the advantages of the multistage mill are two:


Because of the independent roller spacing and sieving, the grist
is accurately controllable.  With my way it is serendipitous that 
is comes out close to the "textbook" look but little can be done
to fine tune it.


> This even crushing of outer layers is difficult because they are 
fused to the husk. To perform this task De Clerck recommends 
that "Great care must be taken in fitting the rolls, so that they are 
set exactly parallel." 


Pardon me for challenging such an august authority but that seems
a bit of a non sequitir and needs to be substantiated.  Nothing I
know of would offer credence to that statement.  It makes no
sense at all.


>Malting and Brewing Science says "there should be no uncrushed 
kernels, the endosperm particles should be reasonably uniform in 
size, and the majority of husks should be entire".


Who on earth would argue with that?  It's what we all want but if
it were an absolute need, none of us would be making beer, would
we?


Fact is, we buy the mill that comes closest to that goal and is within
our budget.


>One commercial brewer told me that with well modified malt he
 would ideally like a complete husk and the rest of the corn in 8
to 10 equal pieces. Fineness wasn't important to him, he was 
trying to keep phenol and lipid extraction down. 


Good prospect for a pre-adjusted MM.  The coarser crush is 
designed with that in mind.


>However I know the MM doesn't crush so evenly that it must 
be set out of parallel to aproximate the *best* a six roller with 
grading sieves can do!


Don't know what that means and doesn't sound like anything I ever 
said.


>Jack is claiming a better, more even crush set parallel than high tech mills
can do, so he has to downgrade it?? Setting out of parallel gives a more
uneven crush!


This makes even less sense.


>Yes, yes. Crush coarse and accept *some* unevenness and 
hang the extraction! You will make a better and easier beer. 
Setting your maltmill out of parallel may have a placebo effect 
on your beer quality....


It is my contention that an adjustable mill has a placebo effect.
The pre-adjusted MM will satisfy your guidelines.


>but I am unconvinced of it's technical merit!


At this point and to end this...  I would be contented
with a concession that it is not a dis-advantage.  Whether
you agree that it is a feature or not was never my point.  I
just don't like folks spreading mis-information about my
products.
 
>"Good humour" suggests a generosity of spirit, it does not 
include sarcasm.


Surely you jest?  Much of the world's best humour is sarcastic
in tone.

Subject: NHC comments


FWIW, I entered a beer in the Florida section of the NHC.  The score sheets
came back 37 and 39, so not bad.  There were some strange inconsistencies
between judges comments (e. g. full bodied on one and thin on the other),
but no more than any other competition.

These remearks were rather surprising.  When you see the official national
competition run by the official national homebrew organization, you expect
that it will be run the best that it can be.  Small, local competitions
suffer from lack of capital and lack of volunteers occasionally, but for
this competition, I would expect enough backing that these problems would
not be a factor.  After all, the entry fee is higher than most competitions
and there are more entries than any other competition.  


Any other comments.

Subject: apparent attenuation


  
  In HBD #2046, Michael Higuchi asks if the attenuation of the gravity 
  in our alchemy experiments is more than the simple conversion of 
  sugar to alcohol.  I'm no yeast guru, but the answer is yes.  There 
  is a Universal Truth principle in chemistry called Conservation of 
  Mass.  Unless you do an Einstein (convert mass to energy), the mass 
  has got to be somewhere.  Some mass is lost due to CO2 evolution (no 
  not like monkeys to megabrewery owners), some drops out like you 
  said (so it doesn't contribute to the density of the solution), and 
  alcohol is produced wich has a lower density than water.  But I 
  don't think that anticipated alcohol is calculated on a molar basis 
  from the sugar, it's sort of like the math sociologists use.

Y'know if that waitstaff-person-individual (pc-bs) is so damn high and   
mighty concerned about market analysis and price per pint then maybe that   
establishment should invest in German produced commercial glassware.   
 Each and every glass would be marked at a point where the level of   
product should rest. Otherwise fill it to the rim, damnit!  You did not   
say you had a problem with the price but the volume (now the service and   
atmosphere).
   


I never had a pint miss the mark the whole month that I was in southern   
Germany and here in the good ole US of A  (aka Land of the Bountiful   
Amber Waves of Grain(beer)) I get the response that you initially got-   
"No problem".


Is it true that in the old days that if a customer was served a draft   
with excessive foam/head that the customer would be inclined to blow it   
off into the bartender's face?  yikes, no wonder there are so many fight   
scenes in western movies.

I question this.  An appropriate amount is 1 lb in 1 gallon.  I find
it hard to believe that there are 8 cups of extract in a pound.  1/2
cup is probably closer if you *must* measure by volume (a notoriously

Nope, your skills are intact.  Being mostly an ale guy I haven't messed with
really pushiung this thing, although a friend who just built one is
maintaining regulation at 55F.   The *air temperature* will drop to around
45F as Chris says; given enough time the wort will approach this.  The new
cut plan which should allow for *4* jugs of ice ?may? improve this
performance.


The Chiller was first posted erroneously described as a "lagering cabinet";
its intent was more for controlling fermentation temperature at reasonable
levels (especially for ales) but true "lagering" is perhaps overstating the
capability.  Bottom line is that for some lagers, using the present design,
you should be able to get at least the fermentation stage done at a
reasonable temperature (~45 - 50F) but you'll require "real" refrigeration
for the "cold conditioning" portion of the lager schedule.

Subject: pub etiquette


I don't know where you are located, but our local brewpub here feels the 
need to price their beer at $3.00 per pint, and it's not even very good. 
They have no competition, for that matter, the only draft beer you can 
get in Montgomery, AL, is in that brewpub. I have discussed the 
economics with the owner, and he freely says he could make a good profit 
at $2 or even less per pint. I've been to brewpubs in other cities, and 
it is common for the prices where there is competition to be about $2 to 
 $2.50 per pint. 


I think you were well within your rights to insist that the glass at 
least be full. Besides, the waitress was clueless to the fact that the 
extra ounce or so actually cost fractions of a cent. You had already 
paid the $3.00 that they were counting on getting from the beer, thus

Hey all, 


Does anyone here have an opinion on a good grain mill to buy?


I mean what are the differences really?


Is a roller mill better than a plate mill???


How bout my coffee grinder? Is this a good way to mill my grain?


Anybody here make their own mills and sell them?

It's called "Getting a full measure".  You didn't get ALL of that $3 pint.
Sounds like a perfectly reasonable request to me.  BTW,  I recall that
Oktoberfest has a form of beer police that check for this.  They want to
make sure that you don't get too much foam (not enough beer) or perhaps too
little that would suggest a beer not poured just before serving.

I have, on several occations, asked to have my glass topped off when it
was obviously low.  Maybe U.S. pubs should take after thier European
counterparts.  In England, (imperial) pint glasses are clearly marked to
indicate the fill line for one pint and the glass is large enough to
contain several fluid ounces of foam!

First, I think you guys may be confusing the Crabtree effect with catabolite
repression. The Crabtree effect is a metabolic regulatory mechanism whereby
respiration is inhibited by the presence of fermentable sugars (all of
them), even when oxygen is available. This is why yeast don't respire in
wort. Catabolite repression is a different metabolic regulatory mechanism,
although it is frequently either confused with or erroneously lumped
together with the Crabtree effect. Whenever glucose (dextrose) is present,
yeast will consume it preferentially over any other sugar, including
maltose. This is called catabolite repression. Glucose is always consumed
first and the other sugars will not be consumed until essentially all of the
glucose is gone.


Secondly, by waiting until mid-fermentation to add the glucose, you're
essentially 'shocking' your yeast. In this case, I'd expect them to quit on
you. It's true that high glucose levels in wort (or particularly in a yeast
starter) can result in a relatively long lag time and/or poor attenuation
with some strains. This is due to catabolite repression. If the yeast is
adapted to glucose, it will take some time to adapt to maltose because the
enzymes involved in the uptake of these two sugars are different, and when
switching substrates the yeast must 'shift gears' to induce the biosynthesis
of these different enzymes. If you add glucose to mid-ferment beer, when the
yeast are munching away on maltose, you'll basically shock the yeast. It
won't continue to consume the maltose because glucose represses maltose
uptake and catabolism, and it won't be able to consume the glucose yet
because the cells have to 'shift gears' first. So they usually end up just
sitting there, settling to the bottom. Add the glucose at the beginning
(i.e. during the boil). Then the yeast will consume all of the glucose
before consuming any of the maltose. This gives the cells the time needed to
switch substrates efficiently. Then also, if the beer "just won't ferment
out", it isn't because of the 'excess' glucose, but instead may be
attributed to other factors, like the level of alcohol, the attenuation of
the yeast strain, or even wort fermentability (i.e. dextrins).

I have and I don't think it's rude (or whatever) to ask for that which
you're paying! If you only paid them 3/4 of your bar bill, would they be
rude to ask you to pay your bill in full? Last night I ordered a local bock
(Otter Creek Spring Mud Bock) while having dinner in a restaurant. The
waitress brought me a very pale yellow beer with a thick white head which
smelled like an ale. I asked if it was the bock and she said it was. I told
her it didn't look or smell like a bock to me, so I SENT IT BACK! It turns
out they had just replaced the bock with the "Summer Wheat" (figures the
help wouldn't know the difference).The point is, if I'm paying for a beer, I
expect to get what I'm paying for, whether it's the particular beer I
ordered or the quantity. You were right to ask to have your beer topped off
and if I ever get such a lecture from a waitress, she gets no tip from me.

>Are there any easy ways to brew all grain with out having to buy all
>of the equipment?


Somehow my original post got lost in the transition.  This reply
is in response to a question of brewing all-grain for minimal dollars.


I made the jump to all grain for about $50 dollars.  I have brewed 4 
all grain batches to date.  My extraction rate is on the low side at 
27-28 pts*lbs/gal. My ability to brew specific styles has taken a 
quantum leap and my all grain batches are the best I have made.


I have the grain crushed at my local homebrew store so I don't have 
to buy a grain mill.  I bought a 8 gallon enamal brew pot (slightly 
dented) for $29.00.  My 6.5 gallon bottling bucket has a 3/4" threaded 
spigot; so I created a square manifold (with drilled holes in the 
manifold sections) out of PVC for $5.00.  I mash the grains in the brew 
pot and sparge in my bottling bucket with manifold.  I borrow my 
neighbors cajun cooker to mash and boil the wort (if purchased it costs 
about $39.00).  You can do it on the stove, but it takes forever to 
heat large volumes of water.  When sparging, I heat the sparge water in 
my brew pot and trasfer it to anouther bucket ($10 dollars) to free up 
my brew pot for collecting the wort.  Total cost was about $45 dollars 
or $85 with the cajun cooker (I prefer the neighbor approach myself).


The manifold design was based upon an early post to the HBD a few years
ago.  The design uses a 3/4" threaded to 3/4" smooth elbow, three 3/4" 
smooth elbows, a 3/4" cap, and 4 sections of 3/4" PVC pipe.  I took 3 
sections of 3/4" PVC pipe (approx 4.5 inches each) and drilled three 
rows of 7/32" holes in on the bottom of each piece.  The section from 
the spigot/threaded elbow to the first smooth elbow (approx 3.5 inches) 
does not require holes.  The manifold should sit snug in the bottom 
of the bottling bucket.  The PVC elbows keep the manifold sections about 
a 1/8 inch off the bottom.  Make sure the holes are facing down.  Do 
not glue the pieces together, they should fit together snug and are 
very easy to clean after each batch by disassembling and reassembling 
the manafold.  Put together it looks like the diagram below.


      |_| <-- 3/4" threaded spigot
      |_| <-- 3/4" threaded to 3/4" smooth elbow
       |____
   |        |
   |        |  <-- 3 elbows + 1 cap + 4 sections of 3/4" pipe
   |        |
   |________|




I hope this helps in your quest for all grain brewing on a budget.  All grain
brewing takes me about 5 hours compared to 2 hours for extract, but the beer
is much better.  Have fun.

Yr. waitress must have been having a seriously bad day - which is no 
excuse whatever for so crappy an attitude.  Yes, the equipment was 
(is) expensive.  Yes, they'd done market research.  Yes, their 
researcher told 'em $3/pint was "perfectly acceptable."  How nice.  


How would she have responded when told by their raw materials source 
that their grain bags were only partly full because their equipment was so 
expensive etc. etc.?  How would you have responded when your new 
Chevrolet lacked its spare tire & they told you how expensive THEIR 
equipment was, & etc.?


Ask her next time (assuming there's a next time), in your best "Mr. 
Roger's Neighborhood" voice "Can you spell 'value for money?'" or 
"Can you spell 'good business sense?'"  Short-counting the customer 
is decidely BAD pub etiquette, and you were (in my view) neither rude 
nor tactless.  (If they'd have tried that on in some of the pubs I 
went to in Deepest Yorkshire, there'd have been a brawl!)

Many thanks to everybody who replied by private email about the propriety
of asking to have one's beer glass topped off when it's served less than
full.  The unanimous view is that this is perfectly acceptable and, 
moreover, (several said) the right thing to do.  I appreciated all of the 
comments.


On a related note, whatever happened to the speculation not long ago that 
government regulators were looking into the fairly common practice of 
calling 14-oz beer glasses "pints"?  Was this something that was

  This is in reply to Art McGregor's post of April 9th or thereabouts.  
Paraphrasing:  "Carbonators are expensive and I don't wanna give 'em out to

  After pressurizing the bottle, you refrigerate it to help the CO2 go into 
solution, and you shake the bottle occasionally (nothing new so far, eh?).
  Once it's "fully carbonated" shake the bottle again to get a good head of 
foam at the top and transfer the bottle to the *freezer*.  
  It may take a re-shake or two but in short order, with minimal effort 
(a recurring theme with my brewing tips) you'll have a plug of frozen 
foam at the top of the bottle.
  Pray to your fave deity, then quickly unscrew the Carbonator and replace 
it with the original plastic cap.  Now you're ready to go on the road with 
fully-disposable-beer-gear.

I love my Bayou Cooker. Brings 5 gal. of wort to a boil in less than 10 min.   


Only problem is that it LOVES propane.  I use one cooker to heat water and

I don't know about generally, but my local brewshop has malted rye.  It's 
quality and consistency is not what I have grown to be accustomed for 
barley, but, it still seems to work.  Rye flakes are not malted, but the

Well, I use a JSP MaltMill.  While I do think it's a high quality product,
if I was in the market for one now, I don't think I'd buy one, because 
frankly the guy uses too damned much bandwidth here.  (I have, in fact, 
been in private e-mail with someone in the market for a new grain mill who
has decided not to purchase a JSP because of Jack's posting habits.  I 
encouraged him to post this valuable information, but I don't think he has.)

I have recently produced the RMP MaltMill, which is just two rolling pins

Regardless of whether it's appropriate to ask to have your pint topped off,
is was -not- at all appropriate for her to lecture you about -anything-.  If
you had insisted that she serve you beer in a salt-rimmed glass with a little
pink umbrella in it, that's how she should serve you.  Proper ettiquette when
faced with self-righteous waitstaff is to simply leave the establishment 
immediately.  Get up and leave.  Don't finish, don't pay.  


The kicker is using "market research" to justify anything.  Market research is
supposed to tell THEM what YOU think, not vice versa.  You -are- the market.

Subject: CaCl source & Poor Hot Break


Searching for a source for Calcium Chloride.


With the assistance of Brewing Water Treatment Calc.[thanks Ken Schwartz 
(kennyeddy`at`aol.com] I have started
tweaking\playing with H20. My water supply (Detroit) analysis: Ca 27, SO4 16, 
Mg 7, Na 5, Cl 8, CO3 75,
Hrdns 99. To get fairly close to Mosher's Ideal Pale Ale target water I would 
have to add: 5.9g Epson Salt, 1.6
Kosher salt, 2.7g calcium chloride, and 26.68 GRAMS of GYPSUM. That seems like 
a lot of gypsom. Doesn't it?
The treatment is for 13.5 gallons of water. 


One of my reasons for my interest in adjusting my water is the fact that I am 
getting little if ANY Hot break.
I do a single infusion in a 10 Gallon Gott Mash\lauter tun for ~90 minutes and 
sparge with 5.7 PH sparge water.
My mash PH is typically from 5.1-5.4. My PH in the Kettle is ~5.5 preboil and 
5.2 post boil. Everything seems
to be "on target". Is it the lack of Ca that is the culprit or an I looking 
down the wrong road. I use "fully
modified" pale ale malts either DeWolf-Cosyns or Biard in the brewing of all 
my ales.


TIA

Subject: The Move


The computer bugs that plagued the HBD earlier this week have been
corrected and the HBD should be more regular soon.  If you are missing
issues, they are available from ftp.stanford.edu and by e-mail from
majordomo`at`aob.org by including the following at the start of your
message to majordomo`at`aob.org:


get homebrew n2042
get homebrew n2043
get homebrew n2044
get homebrew n2045
end


(You may substitute other numbers as appropriate for the digest
number.)  There seems to be a backlog of requests due to this mixup, so
the digest may be sent more often than normal for a few days.


The HBD is also resent by several other mailing lists, some of which
may not yet be configured to accept mail from the new address.  Those
list owners are working on updating their aliases as soon as they can.
