Subject: stuck fermentations


I order yeasties during the winter and I fear it got frozen in shipment.  
A partial mash ale quit at 1.021 and was decidedly sweet.  I mixed up 3 
gal more of wort and tried to get it to finish but it quit at 1.020.(All 
well aereated)


I bottled 4 gal anyway to try it carbonated and cold.  It was too sweet.


I got 3#more of dme and a new yeast and got a rolling ferment and 
combined with the previous brew. After a day+ I added in the contents of 
the bottles, but it seemed to quit fermenting.


Given the order of sugars that yeasties prefer, what would be the best 
way to referment stuck fermentation. All at once ...some of the previous 
wort bit by bit.....lots of splash for aeration?  Your advises would be 
appreciated.  Cheers....Jim Booth in Lansing, Mi


P.S. Thanks to Shawn for the work in getting the changeover on the HBD. 
These computer retoolings never seem to go as smooth as we'd hoped.

What steps are needed to convert my Cajun Cooker to natural gas
from propane?
Can this be done?  Anyone tried it?


Thanks

Hello,
        I would say that if you receive a pint that isn't full with beer 
(head counts too) that you should feel just in asking for it to be topped 
up.  You may look a little penny-wise, but its your right as a consumer.  
Consider this: most pint glasses I've seen only hold a 16 oz if you have 
them filled to the very brim(I did this with water, which has no head, at 
least not where I'm from) and about 4 pubs in the SF bay area just got 
busted by county weights and measures for selling "pints" that were as 
low as 12oz.  I think if a pub says pints are $3, then for $3 they should 
serve an honest pint!  (I do cut some slack if its spilled by serving or 
they're in a hurry)

Subject: Beer fridge question


Wouldn't you know it?  Two weeks after I get my kegging system and
have a couple corny's filled with homebrew, the fan that blows the air
from the freezer to the fridge has gone out.  I'm 99% sure it is just
the bearing, but it is useless none the less.  The refrigerator is
probably 20 years old, and is a Sears brand.


Question is, is this a problem is that is repairable, or is it not
really "worth the money"?  And does anyone know what a good source is
for parts for old fridges?


I guess if all else fails I can use it for lagering.  It seems to stay
at about 50 degrees without any airflow :-)


TIA,

Subject: HBD Problems


- -- [ From: John C. Thompson * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --


All:


I have know received ~20 copies of HBD 2044.  I have tried every thing I can
think of to get this to stop, including unsubscribing and they are still 
coming.
Are any other subscribers having this kind of problem? These extra copies are  


coming in on my business email and creating a lot of problems and 
frustrations.


If this is the best AOB can do, I cast my vote for someone who knows what 
there
doing to take over the digest.


Sorry if I sound like I'm upset, but I am.


John Thompson

??? Other variables being equal, the narrower tubing requires a shorter 
length.
Also, per the empirically derived Hazen-Williams equation, the flow varies
with diameter^4.87, not 2.  A good Mech. or Civil Engr. text has the details.

Here's something that works even better:  Smear some silicone over the
thing, insert into some heat-shrink tubing, shrink the tubing and wipe away
the excess silicone that's extruded via the shrinking.
