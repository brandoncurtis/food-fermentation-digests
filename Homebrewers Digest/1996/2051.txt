Subject: motorizing a phillmill


       I am interested in talking to anybody who has sucessfully
motorized a phillmill.  Dan Listerman rec: using a drill but I want less
hassle than that.  Besides,  my 3/8 drill really didn't like being used
that way and my 1/2  drill kept tryign to rip my hand from my wrist.  My
concerns are that side loading the bronze bushings will cause premature
failure and so I thing a direct connection to a pillow block that is
driven by belts and pulleys.  This would allow for speed reduction while
preventing sideloading of the mill.  Dan quit responding to my e-mail,
maybe he is on vacation.

For those looking to make their own wort boiler, chech your local Lowes
building supply store. Ours has a bunch of ring type propane burners for
$18.  Made in China (probably with slave labor...).  They look alot like the
burners in the 100kBTU cookers they also sell.

Rich,


You can probably get a new fan for about $20 at an appliance parts store.
Look them up in your yellow pages.  You might also think about buying a used
fridge.  I got one for $35 4 years ago and it's crankin' away.  50F is a bit
warm for lagering, but it's better than 60 <g>......

John,


I'm only getting one copy. In the beginning, the Digests were a little slow,
but that's better.  I can understand your frustration, but jumping on AOB
and Shawn this way is a bit rough.  It seems to me that Shawn _knows_ what
he's doing.  He's just ironing out problems the differences between the old
way and the new way.  I bet if you contact him directly, he'll fix your
problem.......

Need more info about the recipe, the yeast type etc. Folks freeze yeast all

When my old man retired to Aussie in 1970, he took everything he owned,
'cept the cars, (Oz gov't convinced him it wasn't worth it, they were
wrong!), including all appliances, most of which were Sears' Kenmore brands.
Of course this required some electrical management (doubled sockets, with
one set at 115v, 50hz, the other set at 220v, 50 hz. Everything worked
great, 'cept hz sensitive stuff like turntables), but when his ancient deep
freeze went blitz, he called Sears in Hawaii and they expressed the new
compressor within days. Sears, IMHO, is very likely to have your needs in
stock. Price for parts to be evaluated.

Sorry, you are upset..but take a few minutes to cool down. I, too, have
experienced problems, and I know we are not the only ones. We have been
fortunate in the past to have had Rob Gardner's YEARS of tweaking the system
to arrive at the standard of performance that we have all come to expect.
Now, Shawn has only had a week to transfer a not insignificant package to
the AOB's net, and I'm just as dissappointed as the rest of you to discover
it is not a perfect world that we live in.
Some folk's ( not anyone specifically, but collectively, it's hit my
critical mass) remind me of the surgeons who would go out of their way to be
a PITA to newly training Operating Room personnel. So, after getting reamed
out and in a bit of a funk (to quote the Clown in Chief), one kind senior
nurse took me aside and said, "Nobody was born knowing how to do this
stuff!"  And it was the same way twenty years earlier when I was a student
skydiver, some of the hot shots were nasty to neophytes and were a PITA to
them. It turned many away, who said, "I've had enough jumps to have
satisfied my curiosity, but I don't want to be seen wth blokes like that!"
It's sort of the way some newbies are treated, IMHO. Yes, its a PITA. Yes, I
liked getting my HBD first thing in the morning, to go over before getting
down to the humdrum of brewery life. Yes, I liked getting it in one piece
and having the 'Auto-Magical' let me know it got there. But, please, take
two shots of "Tincture of Time," and give the lad a chance to prove that he
can't live up to the task before calling for his summary execution. He has
some pretty big shoes to fill. Rome wasn't built in a day!

Is just so much whining!  Nothing in the homebrewing community makes me as
mad or as sad as the bad-mouthing that the AOB gets over damn near anything.
theY'RE doing a great job, I appreciate their efforts, and theY'RE the only
ones out there representing us on a national, and a non-profit level.  


I suggest you try unsubscribing a few more times, and I'm sure that'll solve
the problem.

        Finally!!  I can now get Widmer Bros. (Portland, Or) brews in

the bottles of their Amberbier that I just purchased.  Does anyone out there
know if Widmer bottle conditions their brews?  If so, do they use the
altbier yeast they use in primary?  If so, I'd like to recover some from one
of their bottles and brew an Alt.  No affiliations, yadda, yadda, yadda,

Subject: Anglo-American Wheat Beer


I twisted the American Wheat Beer style just slightly and came up with a
very tasty beer.  Using the recipe below, I made 4 gallons:
      Malt:
        5 lbs wheat malt
        1 lb  British pale ale malt
      Hops:
        0.5 oz Cascade whole hops (alpha acid = 5.5%)   60 min
        0.5 oz Cascade                                  10 min
        0.5 oz Cascade                                  steep
      Mash Schedule:
        30 min protein rest at 125F
        90 min mash at 145F
      SG - 1.044
      FG - 1.014        


I poured the cooled wort over the Wyeast #1968 London ESB yeast cake from a
batch of pale ale and fermented at 60-65F.  After 4 days, I racked to the
secondary, more for clarity than for any additional attenuation.  For
bottling, I primed the batch with a scant 2/3c of corn sugar.


The resulting beer has the floral nose that is one of the chief
characteristics of the #1968 yeast.  Indeed, with the low hopping in a wheat
beer, the yeast nose comes through very clearly. I would perhaps add a bit
more late-addition hops, but my wife is very happy with the taste --
although she would prefer an increase in the carbonation.  The color came
out a touch darker than what I had hoped -- more of a dirty straw color --
but compared against a standard pilsener, it's not that much darker.


All in all, the Anglo-American Wheat is a nice summer beer that allows an
assertive yeast to show its stuff.

Subject: RE: Beer fridge question


Rich Edmondson asks about old fridge parts, 
specifically the blower fan bearing.


I had the same thing happen to me, with about
the same timing.  I took the fan and motor apart
to find the problem.  The problem would have
been the bearings, if there were any.  The shaft
that goes through the center of the motor and
rides in metal seleves was worn.  What I did 
to fix mine was this:  The center rod went 
through either a magnet or a big coil (can't
remember which) that seemed to be permenantly
attached.  I hit the rod with a hammer a few times
and pushed it slightly through the coil/magnet.
What this did was slightly change where the shaft 
spun in the sleves.  The worn part was no loner where
the shaft was riding.  A drop of oil, reassembly,
and presto-chango, a fixed fridge with 0$ spent.
My old fridge is a Gibson, so not sure this would
work for you, but what you got to loose?


This even fixed the awful racket the fridge had
been making for a while before breaking.


BTW, running the fridge without a blower could
be bad news.  My cooling coils got encased in 
ice without the airflow.
