Howdy, from a first time homebrewer. I am brewing an all malt beer using
Superbrau dark, hopped and unhopped. I added Perle hop pellets and used
Superbrau yeast. The first 36 hours of fermentation were quite active but
stalled rather abruptly. I called the brewer's supply and they suggested a
hot water bath for the fermenter which stimulated some activity, they also
suggested transfering the wort to another fermenter to wake up the yeast,
which I also did. Sp. grav. was 1.026, the wort tasted like beer (much to my
relief) but was quite turbid and sweet, suggesting the obvious that it still
had a ways to go. Any help would be greatly appreciated, should I add more
yeast? House temp is 62-67 degrees, should I buy a brew belt to keep the
fermenter warm? Am I worrying too much? 
Thanks,
Dean

My analysis:


1.  8 qts/8 lbs = 1.0 qt/lb -->  this is a bit on the low side
    *  The recommended water/grist ratio is ~ 1.3 qt/lb
    *  The lower ratio used makes it difficult to separate the thick and thin


2.  Make sure to draw off enough decoct.  The rule-of-thumb is supposed to
be ~1/3 of the mash.  I generally decoct ~ 1/2 when they call for 1/3, just
to be on the safe side.  It is far easier to cool some of the decoct to the
target temp than to raise the temp of the entire mash using unscheduled
infusions of   boiling water.


3.  If the "thick" decoct is "too thick", eg. a strainer is used to separate
the grist from the liquid, the decoct will not have a great enough heat
capacity to raise the temp of the main mash to the desired level.  Water has
a much higher heat capacity than grain (at least on a volume basis).  I
"discovered" this the hard way!
    *  IMHO, the ideal decoction thickness is such that there is liquid
throughout the grains, but no free liquid on top of them.  This should leave
plenty of thin, enzyme-rich mash in the mash-tun.
    *  Of course, as conversion proceeds, the liquid/grist ratio will
increase in the decoction, especially when going from 122- 145F.


4.  Boil the !`at`#$ out of the decoction!!!
    *  I have found that even though the decoction is "boiling", or
bubbling, its overall temp is not there yet.  It just "appears" to be boiling.
    *  I let it go at a good rolling boil for at least 10 min to ensure the
temp reaches boiling.


When I originally switched form extract to all-grain, I bought "Brewing
Lager Beer", by Greg Noonan, and immediately plunged into decoction mashing
in 10 gal batch-sizes.  The 8 h+ brew days and frustrations associated with
trying to hit the desired temp finally led me to switch to simpler infusion
schedules, although I still used a mash-out decoction.  I have recently
returned to decoction mashing for my lagers and German-style ales.  In
particular, I find the technique advantageous to those wishing to use G.
Fix's 40-60-70 mash profile.  Doing a decoction to go from 40-60 C produces
a great deal of soluble carbo's which are readily digested by beta-amylase
at the 60 C rest.  BTW, almost ALL the grist must be decocted to raise the
temp from 40 - 60 C.

Greetings,
I will be able to acquire a brand new fridge destined for beer. Can it
be used for lagering as is without a fancier temperature control gadget?
Has anyone used a fridge with the thermostat it came with? Does the
inside temperature vary enough to hurt beer? The fridge will go in the
garage where ambient temperature can get pretty darn hot here in Georgia.
Comments will be welcomed.


On a separate note, for those coming to Athens for the soccer or volleball

     In many states(disclaimer), not all, It is illegal to sell beer made at 
your place of residence.  You would have to brew it in the facillity that was 
going to be sold and the owner would have to conform to any state 
regulations concerning brewing.
     Depending on your zoning, you could make your house a brewery.  The 
downside of this is the cost (thousands) of meeting state codes.

Here here!  As a software developer, let me chime in by saying it's that
it's not easy to move a significant piece of software from one UNIX system
to another, considering the variety of hardware out there.  Then there is
the matter of training the new administrator, and all of this without
interrupting service (so to speak). I think the transfer was handled 
admirably.

You asked a mouthful!  Usually, I add fruit first so that I can remove the
pulp/seeds/skins (whatever) after a few days, then strain and top off with
water.  I have also added fruit later, but it sort of depends on the fruit.
I've seen it done with raspberries and cherries, but I hear it's *not*
recommended for raisins or very pulpy fruit.  You also need to be careful
about pectin which will cloud up your final product.  As far as leaving it
still or making it sparkling, that depends on the alcohol %, attenuation of
the yeast, whether or not you use campden, or some other method of
inhibiting bacteria growth (including yeast).  I suggest you find a good
book on meads.  There is a nice section in a book called _Country Wines_
(author unknown).  For sparkling meads, I've had great success with
Papazian's method (NCJOHB).

I don't have a kegging system (yet) nor do I plan to use mini-kegs.   
 However I thought those of you who do use the mini kegs may be   
interested in this info.  Apparently the 'Carbonator' (used on 2 liter   
plastic bottles) can be used as an adapter on mini keg taps.  The   
'Carbonator' can fit where the CO cartridge screws in when retrofitted   
with a Grolsh gasket and then a regular kegging system's CO tank can be   
hooked up.


Has anyone ever tried this?  Sounds interesting for transporting   
sample/party quantities of home-brosia.

Hi All,


In HBD #2054, Wade Wallinger writes about his first decoction mash:


>1. I developed heat and material balance equations for determining the =
>strike temperatures for each decoction. It seems to me that the heat =
>capacity of the decoction and the heat capacity of the remaining stuff =

I'm not entirely sure we're talking about the same thing, but when I fill
a 1 gallon ziplog bag with grain, it weighs just about 5 pounds, not 12. If
you relied on this measurement, then I think you didn't pull enough for the
thick decoctions.


>2. What led me to the first question is that these equation do not match =
>what I did in reality (damn theory). I was led to believe from the =
>literature that a thick decoction should be pulled.


Absolutely. Take as little liquid as possible when pulling the thick
decoction. The mash liquid contains most of the enzymes, you want to leave
them in the rest mash.


What I do is tip the tun so the liquid runs to one side, then use a small
saucepan to scoop grain from the "high" side of the tun, ensuring I get
mostly grain with very little liquid. Once I've transferred the decoction to
the decoction kettle, I add about 3/4 gallon of boiling water to the 
decoction.
The extra water helps prevent scorching the decoction (a critical point), 
*and*
starts your temperature boost. I.e., adding grist from a rest mash at 115F to
the boiling water in the decoction vessel boosts the temp to ~140F 
immediately.
I only need to run the decoction burner for a few minutes to get to sacc. 
rest,
saving both time and propane. While the decoction is boiling, the extra water
is lost as steam, so the rest mash doesn't get too thin when the decoction is
added back.

You definitely are not pulling enough grain, that's why you're undershooting
the target temperatures. This can be a real problem if you mash in a cooler
as I do, and can't heat the tun directly.


I just eyeball it, and pull about half the grain. If you are unsure as to
whether you have pulled enough grain, guess high rather than low. If you pull
too much, what will happen is that you'll hit the target temperature and 
still have some of the boiled decoction left. Simply cool the remaining
decoction to the desired temperature, which usually takes just a few minutes,
then add it back.


>Could someone more experienced describe the =
>thickness of a thick decoct in either subjective or technical terms?


It should have roughly the same consistency as loose oatmeal. If in doubt,
use more water (not mash liquid!) rather than less. It's much easier to avoid
scorching the decoction if you have a little more water in the kettle.


>3. For those who are still with me, I am also curious about the risk of =

Yes, this is a big problem. The boiled decoction is both very hot, and very
high in melanoidin content, two prime conditions for HSA to occur. It is very
important to transfer the decoction and combine the mashes with as little
splashing and agitation of the mash as possible. Transfer gently, and use a
folding rather than a stirring motion when combining the decoction and rest
mashes. It's also *EXTREMELY* important that the decoction and rest mashes be
thoroughly combined. If pockets of unconverted starch remain in the rest mash
due to inadequate combination, starch will be leeched into the wort during
lautering, and a starch haze will result.


Wade, I'm going to forward a copy of a handout I used about a year ago when
I demonstrated decoction mashing for the members of my homebrewing club. If
you'll read it, I think it will help answer many of your questions. Drop
some email if you still have any questions.


            Cheers,

Subject: Bottling Buckets


Dave Mercer asks why can't he add bottling sugar to his secondary and bottle
directly, being concerned about contamination possiblities from using the
bottling bucket.


First of all, the major concern when adding sugar solution for bottling is
uniformity of distribution throughout the beer.  With five or ten gallons of
liquid with a density and viscosity near 1.00 and a sugar solution with a much
higher density and viscosity, getting good mixing is very difficult just by
stirring in.  Adding the sugar solution to the bucket and then the beer will
ensure better mixing.  You are right about possible contamination, but I think
the posssibility of oxidation of the beer ( particularly if it has been 
lagered
in a carboy and is virtually still, i.e. no residual CO2) is even more likely
and perhaps even more devastating. Recently, a first time, young woman brewer 
(
who had been extremely careful about sanitation, preparation, temperatures,
etc.) came to me with a problem.  Her problem had all the manifestations of
improper mixing- blown bottles and flat bottles.  Turns out she added bottling
sugar to the secondary and obviously didn't  stir well enough.  So that's the
risk you take. Oxidation and contamination with bottling buckets, non-uniform
carbonation, with the attendant broken bottles, flat beers. foamy beers, etc.,
without.


HOWEVER, I've been brewing since 1968 ( yep, before it was legalized - thanks
Blue Ribbon) and have never used a bottling bucket because of the above
problems.  I use what has been largely poo-pooed in Pap's book
 ( I think) and by others as too labor intensive or maybe old fashioned, since
adding sugar to bottles was the old Prohibition technology. I add a  measuring
spoon of cool, boiled sugar SOLUTION to each bottle and then add the beer
directly from the secondary fermenter. Adding the sugar solution takes me less 


than five minutes and I don't really find it tedious.  I avoid the possibility
of contamination and oxidation and I know for sure if I get an undercarbonated
bottle that "it isn't ready to drink yet ",because I know the correct amount 
of
sugar has been added to each bottle.


In all these years ( has it really been almost thirty?!) I have never had a
burst bottle.  Knock on wood!


Try this method, I think you will be pleased.

secondary carboy.  The first time I did it, I had various levels of 
carbonation, obviously due to lack of complete mixing.  I recently 
bottled another batch 1 1/2 weeks ago and will start to 'crack' some of 
those this weekend.  I was much more careful to make sure I completely 
mixed the the priming sugar in with the beer, using a long stemmed spoon 
to push the dry hop bag (its a very bitter recipe for a California Common 
Beer - one of my favorites!) up and down within the secondary.  I too 
would be interested to hear from anyone else who uses this method.  If I 
don't get consistent carbonation on this second batch, I will probably go 
back to using the bottling bucket (unless someone else convinces me 
otherwise).

Please explain HOW. It seems to me that getting 10% of additional extract
does little more than save a few pennies. Exactly how does that improve the
beer?

Subject: lager vaseline?


This is strange...


I just brewed a lager using 6# DWC pilsener and 1.5# flaked corn.  
Mashed
in at 125 F for 20 minutes, removed 1/3 decoction and returned to raise
mash to ~ 154 F and rested until conversion.  Took second 1/3 decoction
and raised mash to ~ 175 F for mash out.  Collected 7 gallons wort and
boiled ~ 90 minutes.  Chilled and pitched 48 hour old, 18 oz. St. Louis
Lager starter into 55 F wort.  Bubbles appeared in airlock after ~ 12
hours.  The problem is there is a LOT of vaseline-looking stuff floating
on top of the wort in the carboy.  I have brewed lots of beer, but not
many lagers, and I have never used flaked corn.  The wort is already
fairly clear, and the sediment layer on the bottom is mainly hallertau 
and saaz hops, but this floating gunk is absolutely amazing!  LOTS of
vaseline-like stuff, sort of formed in ribbons, fibers and clumps that
(honestly) resemble brains.  Has anybody experienced this?  I have never
heard of it, please help...

Subject: Chilling ales prior to bottling


I've been reading about and contemplating a lot lately about chilling down
my brews after fermentation to help settle stuff out.  I tend to brew
ales (since I haven't adapted my spare fridge to do lagers yet) and was 
curious
if anyone else does this.


I figgered I could rack to a secondary (maybe) and then put the carboy into 
the
fridge for a day or so.  


If you do this:


1) How long do you chill it for?


2) What's the maximum I should consider chilling it for before I have to pitch
    extra yeast at bottling time to get the beer to prime properly?


3) Is it worth it?
Have you noticed any improvements in your beer that you can really attribute   


    to the process, such as clarity or less astringent tastes & off flavors?




Thanks all!

Prepare the receiving keg with slightly less co2 pressure than is currently
in the dispensing keg. Hok up the beer out line from the dispensing keg to
the beer out line of the receiving keg. Put co2 pressure at what you
consider normal dispensing pressure, say 12 psi, on the co2 side of the
dispensing keg. As flow occurs, simply release co2 from the receiving keg
until the transfer is complete. I always allow a few minutes, post transfer
to re-establish full pressurization, so the customers beer isn't a wee bit 
flat.

I use these fittings. New ones don't have any grease on them. The only
problem occurs when pressure differentials allow beer to flow back to them
past a sticking check valve. The female portion is usually brass, with a
ferrous steel spring with in, and the male portion is often ferrous and they
rust. I have seen all brass males, made by Dixon, but have been unable to
find them at my normal suppliers. Foxx in Kansas City has some pretty nice
and fairly cheap plastic quick connects, that have shut offs in both male
and female units.They work just fine. I also use a silicone based food grade
(for incidental contact) spray lubricant to keep the o-rings on the plastic
units in shape. The metal unit are reliably air tight, 'cept when corrosion
has occurred, andwhile disconnected. When connected, I have never had a
leak. But when corroded, they are often difficult to connect and disconnect.
If anyone knows where to find the Dixon units, please let me know. The male
unit says "Dixon DCP-20" and the female is the highest quality Q-C I ahve
ever used. Just wish I could find more of them!

All kinds of things change when you scale up or down, but for the relatively
modest change you propose, I would simply halve the recipe, make it, see
what it's like and then adjust accordingly. Gets a lot more problematic when
scaling up from 5 gallons to 7 BBl's!

Sounds like some of the specialized gas cylinders that I have seen used in
hospitals for running Aortic Balloon Pumps, and perfusion machines, etc. I
know Luxfer is a manufacturer of medical devices, the most obvious examples
being the head light units you see surgeons wear.
If the manufacturer knows nothing about them, you might keep one for a
souvenir and throw the rest away. You have already learned that one supplier
wouldn't refill it, although I'm sure that if the tank tested out fine,
there would be no reason why "I" wouldn't replace the valve assembly myself
with a unit from Foxx or Rapids.
 But just because I would do it is no recommendation that you do it. But my
reasoning would be, if the tank is tested and certified to a certain
pressure standard by a reputable facility, what the hell difference does it
make what kind of valve is on the top? (Exotic and un-available threads to
prevent such a move notwithstanding.) As long as the valve is rated for that
purpose?


Actually, sounds like just the thing for sending out with kegs rather than
party pumps! Sized right, in any case.

Subject: Stout Marinade


Sorry about the empty message yesterday, I don't know how that happened.
I'll try again now.....


I reciently made the marinade below with steaks and thought it was great.
I had some of the marinade left over, so I just used the Guinness bottle
to store the rest in the refrigerator, after recapping. About a week later
we decided to cook some hamburgers on the grill, and I thought it might be
good to mix the remaining marinade with the burger. We used about 8 oz
of the marinade in 2 lbs burger. I think they were the best burgers I've
ever eaten. The taste comes through even if you load the burger up with
lettuce, tomato, cheese, onions, or whatever.


Here's the recipe for the marinade and directions. This is by Joseph
Ascoli, executive chef of the Camden Harbour Inn in Camden, Maine. Taken
from Zymurgy(Vol 19, Number 2) Summer 1996 issue, page 30.


Enough for 1 steak, multiply as necessary.


2 cloves garlic
1 tsp shallot (3g)
1 tbsp Vidalia onion (15g)
1/4 tsp fresh tarragon (1g)
1/4 tsp parsley (1g)
1 tsp Worcestershire sause (10g)
1 tsp Dijon mustard (10g)
4 oz Guinness Stout or Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout (118 ml) (room temp.)
1 oz tamari (30 ml) (or dark soy sauce)
1/8 tsp black pepper, coarsely ground (1g)
1/8 tsp salt (1g)


(1) Finely chop garlic, challot and onion and place in a small bowl.
(2) Finely chop parsley and tarragon and add to the bowl.
(3) Add the Worcestershire, Dijon, Guinness, tamari and seasonings then mix
    well to combine. Let stand for 30 minutes to blend flavors.
(4) Place the ribeye in the marinade and make sure it is well-coated.
    Cover the bowl and place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or overnight
    if being used for a picnic entree the following day.
(5) Preheat the gas, charcoal or wood grill until the ashes are gray, thn
    cook the ribeye.
(6) Place the remaining marinade in a small saucepan on the grill and
    reduce it for one or two minutes until slightly thickened. Add more beer
    to the marinade at this stage, if desired. Pour over the ribeye and serve.

Marty,


I've used pneumatic quick-disconnect on the air side of kegs for 5 years.
As long as they're connected, male to female, I've never had a problem, no
air loss.  Here's a kicker, I also use quick-disconnects on the beer side
when kegging to sankey kegs, and also out of a sankey to bottles for comps
or carrying.  Not a hitch, if it'll hold liquid, it'll hold air....  Go for
it.  BTW, I sometimes spray some WD40 on em, 'cause they often get bathed in
Iodophor and get a little sticky.  Still no problem.

I just leave it open to the air.  Unless someone is dusting the house

Weeks later, they explode!  Happened to Jake recently.  Make fer dang 
sure it's done fermenting and not infected.  One thing you can do to 
minimize risk is to use swing-top (Grolsch, etc) bottles, and release 
the top briefly every so often, to make sure it's not restarted.  


What I do more often is simply wait to rack until I'm ready to brew again,
and just pour the cooled wort into the old primary without cleaning.  Works
great.

Subject: Fermenting in kegs


     I read a posting about fermenting in Sankey kegs.  While I have 
     actually not used it yet, I have prepared a keg for use as a 
     fermenter.  Mine will be easy to scrub out by hand because I cut a 
     hole in the top (~9 inches across-22 cm if you're metric).  "How will 
     you do closed fermentations in such a thing?" you may ask.  Here's 
     how:
     
     1.  Solder 4 machine screws at each compass point around the hole, 
     about 1/2" from the rim of the hole.
     
     2.  Cut a piece of Plexiglas large enough to fit over the hole and 
     screws.
     
     3.  Drill holes in the Plexiglas so that it can be fit over the 
     screws.
     
     4.  Use a piece of vinyl tubing or the like as a gasket to form an 
     airtight seal between the keg and the Plexiglas.
     
     5.  Oh yeah, drill a hole in the Plexiglas that will fit a stopper 
     (for the airlock - don't want to make a bomb!)
     
     6.  After you put your cooled wort in the keg/fermenter, put the 
     gasket in place between the rim of the hole and the screws, slip the 
     Plexiglas over the screws and secure it with wing nuts.  Put a stopper 
     and airlock in the hole and you're set.
     
     I had a valve welded near the bottom so I will (hopefully) never have 
     to siphon again.  Having not used it yet, I don't know if the yeast 
     cake will be in the way of my valve.
     
     This fermenter will be easy to clean with ordinary elbow grease.  By 
     the way, you shouldn't sanitize stainless steel with bleach - it's 
     corrosive to it.  Use iodine or just fill the fermenter with some 
     water and boil it a while.  It doesn't have to be full, the steam will 
     kill whatever is on the sides (notice how hot the sides get).  Just 
     cover the hole on top with a metal lid when doing this to keep the  
     interior hotter.
     
     I'm planning on using this contraption next week.  I'll keep the 
     Digested posted (I know you all can't wait!).  If anybody out there 
     has already done this, how did it go?

Subject: quick disconnects, a sex change may be advisable!


Regarding the use of quick disconnects(QD) for CO2 lines, 
Wade Wallinger writes ...

The female QD fittings are closed when disconnected, open when
connected. The male QD fittings are open at all times. This is true at
least for type 'M' QDs, and I suspect for all common ones.  If you are
pressurizing a keg and the QD opens either by accidentally tugging it,
or by unthinkingly opening it, then male side will be open, the female
side closed.


If this accident occurs in Wade's arrangement, with the female QD on
the -CO2 tank- side, then you save your CO2, but you are sprayed by
beer foam from the suddenly depressurized keg and have a mess to clean
up. In Wade's arrangement, you must be careful to *always* remove the
keg (pin or ball) gas side fitting before opening the QD.


Alternatively, if the female is on the -keg- side when this accident 
occurs, then you just lose a little CO2.  The order in which you
remove fittings is unimportant, except for the potential loss of a
little CO2.


The other issue is connector cost.  The male QD is about $1, the
female QD is ~$4, and as Wade points out you really just need 1 CO2
tank connection, but a number of exit side connections. It costs a bit
more but a male connector on the CO2 side can prevent a messy
mistake.

Subject: pts/lb/gal formula


Kerry asks about the pts/lb/gal formula.  Well, I'll post since there's
another half to it, which I don't recall ever being posted.


To calculate how many pts/lb/gal you got, multiply the OG pts. by the gallons
and then divide by the number of pounds of grain or extract you used.


For example, if you got 5 gallons of 1.050 wort from 9 pounds of grain,
the math would be (5*50)/9 = 27.78 pts/lb/gal.


Once you know how many pts/lb/gal you are getting from each grain and
extract, you can estimate your OG by multiplying all the grains/extracts
times their pts/lb/gal values and then dividing by the number of gallons
you are making (I'm just making up numbers here):


5 pounds of M&F Pale Ale malt    5 * 28 = 140
1 pound of DWC CaraVienne malt   1 * 24 =  24
2 pounds of M&F light DME        2 * 45 =  90
                                         ----
                 total points             254


         divided by 5 gallons           50.80


                        expected OG: 1.051

Dave, I'm sure many brewers have had this idea before.  I think the basic
reason you don't hear of hundreds of brewers adding the carbonating sugar to
the secondary is because what you end up with is one big bottle of carbonated
beer instead of 48 little ones.  Many brewers carbonate their beer in kegs and
use something called a "counterpresser filler" to move the carbonated beer
that's under pressure in a keg, to a bottle. I did that for a few bottles once 


and it was even less fun than regular bottling.


If you've added your primary sugar to your secondary your going to be a bit
unhappy when you take off the lid and most of the carbonation blows away just
like opening a bottle of soda. Much of the rest will leak out while you siphon 


probably causing all kinds of fun problems.  What beer you do manage to get
into the bottle won't be very carbonated at all, sorry to say.

Subject: Weizenbock/Honey


Dave Mercer asked about Aventinus Weizenbock: I have twice tried to revive
the yeast from this beer without success. I'll note that neither bottle
tasted very fresh and will also note that this product as served in Munich
is heavenly. As for recipe formulation I strongly recommend Eric Warner'a
book on wheat beer. A weizenbock is simply a wheat beer brewed to bock
strength. How much grain you need depends on your system's efficency. You
also have a choice as to the fraction of wheat you want (I like 2/3). Be
prepared for a stuck mash. The old rule of thumb is that pitching and
fermentation temperatures should sum to 30C (I use 54/64F per Warner's
recommendation).


Ted Davidson asked about the weight of honey: apiculturists buy 12 Oz jars
for packaging 1 pound of honey. Also, the honey must be at least 82 Brix.
Thus three pounds would be about 36 Oz depending on the water content.

In a hammer mill, a hammer that is attached to a shaft by a hinge beats
the grain against the corrugated wall of a cylindrical chamber.  Product
fineness is adjustable by using different mesh screens that fit in the
perimeter of the mill.  When the pulverized grain is small enough, it is
thrown through the screen by the hammer and the air which is blown into
the mill with the grain.  Our local food co-op flour mill (The Daily
Grind - great name!) uses a hammer mill with different screens for fine
flour, coarser corn meal, and still coarser wheat meal.  The local feed
mill uses the same kind of mill.


I have no idea what fineness Guinness might use.

Well, I guess I am not alone in this project this summer.  I was going
to wait to post the final design somewhere, but I guess I will share
my results to date.


So far I have constructed my roller out of wood, but the rest of the 
mill is still in my head.  It is likely to be a while until I finish
because my wife will not let me run power tools after the kid's bedtime.


First, here is what I have done and then the problems.


What I did:


I turned a 3.5 inch roller about 8 inches long from black walnut.
Any hardwood should do.  Hard maple would also be a good choice.
I used 8 in. scraps glued together to form a 4 x 4 x 8" block.  You
definately want to use lots of peices glued together.  It
makes the wood more stable to have the different grain in the 
different pieces of wood (it won't warp or split if it is several
pieces glued together).  My block is about 12 (yes, twelve) pieces
of wood glued together.  Don't worry about glueing, a proper glue
glue joint is actually stronger than the wood itself.


For a shaft for the roller, I got a 3' long, 3/8" steel rod from the
hardware store ($3.00).  This is actually enough to make 3 or 4 
rollers.  You could also use the kind of 3/8" bolts
do not have the threads at the top, just smooth metal.  Anyway, the
idea is to bore a hole into either end of the roller then epoxy
a steel rod into both ends.  One end should stick out about an
inch, to ride on the bearing.  The other end should stick out
4-6" so there is room to eventially attach a crank.  Speaking of
bearings, I got 2 brass sleeve bearings at the hardware store
($2.00 ea).  These are just brass 3/8" ID tubes that the shaft
can ride in. I figured roller bearing were overkill for a hand
crank mill that will make 10 - 15 batches a year.  A drop of motor
oil should make it last a good long time.


Problems encountered:


When I bored the holes into either end of the roller, I discovered
it is virtually impossible to get them lined up properly.  You
need to turn the wood on the shaft to get a even, wobble free spin.
I do not know how to rig a convwentional lathe to do this, but
fortunately for me I have a Shopsmith and was ablle to rig it to 
turn wood on the metal shaft.  I replaced the lathe attachment
on the motor with a 1/2" drill chuck so that the drill chuck 
can grip and drive the metal shaft.  For the other end I clamped
a wood block in place, drilled a hole in it and put one of the 
sleeve bearings in the hole.  The other end of the shaft 
then rided in the bearing.  I then evened up the roller as it
spun on it's shaft.  It is important to attach the drill chuck to
the short shaft, and push the long shaft all the way through the
bearing so that the bearing rides as close to the wood as possible.
this helps eliminate inadvertant wobble.  If you do not have a 
Shopsmith, try to find someone who does to help you turn the
roller.


If I do this again, I would have a solid shaft all the way through
the roller by epoxying the steel rod into the center of the block
of wood as I glued the block of wood together.  Then simple do all
the turning on the shaft.


Next step for the roller:


Based on previous posts here, the roller should be textured (or 
something) to allow it to grip the grain and pull it throught the
mill.  I have not done this yet, but I plan to cut groves along
the length of the roller (parallel to the shaft).  I am thinking 
a hack saw blade may make good groves.


Well, that sums it up to date. hopefully I will have the body done
by end of summer and be able to report on effectiveness.

Subject: RIMS Pump Power


In #2053 Dion said:


> With anything other than a 70% open area false bottom, even
> 1/20hp is severely underpowered.


First, I respect Dion very much, and since he has on several occassions
helped me with my stupid questions, I owe him a great deal.  But, (and
you knew this was coming), the assertion regarding pump power doesn't
make sense nor does it agree even remotely with my experience.  Again,
I ASSUME BECAUSE DION SAID IT THAT IT AGREES PERFECTLY WITH HIS!


First, with anywhere from 12-25 lbs of grain sitting on a 6% open false
bottom, the wort drains out *under gravity alone* at a rate greater than
I would want to pump it with my system.


Second, if a pump can produce from 3 to 7 foot of head with a 1/25 hp
motor, that spec *defines* how much a non-positive displacement pump can
"pull" on the wort.  I assert that if I put a 1 hp motor on this same
pump mechanism and turn it at the same rpm, the increased torque won't
increase the head.  The goofy impeller mechanism is all played out due
to an inherent design limitation--more power won't make much difference.


Third, with a 6% open false bottom, about 14" grain bed depth, and 22 lbs
of grain, a 1/25 hp pump will fire the wort clear across the garage on a
continuous basis through a 5/8" ID tube--no brag, just fact.  I have to
close off my ball valves to AT MOST 10% open (est) to maintain a reasonable
recirc rate--anything more open and there's just too much flow.


My first and third comments are simply facts--my second comment is an
opinion based on engineering gut feel.  So be it.  Dion's experience is
obviously different.  I'd greatly appreciate any pertinent RIMS Reality
Reports (from either viewpoint), but please include false bottom *total
area* and percentage open areas.  I think it's intuitive that Dion's
comments and mine *might* be consistent if we're talking about wildly
different false bottom total areas (70% open with 1000cm^2 area isn't the
same as 70% open with 100cm^2 total area from the pump's point of view, eh?).
