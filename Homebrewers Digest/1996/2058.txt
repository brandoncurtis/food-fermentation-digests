For an informative article on dropping the pressure of the keg from xx
pounds to dispensing pressure, check out the AHA's COnference
Proceedings, "Brew Free or Die." Not sure of the year. Dave Miller has an
article on exactly how much a foot of hose reduces the pressure. it is,
in fact, 2-3 lbs per foot, depending on the ID of the hose.

Subject: kosher brewing


I deleted the original post but recall questions on kosher ingredients and
rabinical supervision required to make a true kosher batch of homebrew.


A couple of points:


1.  Since malting and extract preparation involve a degree of "cooking"  I
would guess that that you should try to find materails made from a plant
that has been kosher certified.  Look for "K" or a U with a circle around it
on the label.  I do not know if one exists.  Chances are that malt and
extract are coincidently prepared "kosher" but how to really be sure?


2. Kosher certification is expensive.  Where I work, we hire a company to
consult with and provide certification  ( the circle U one).  They have a
fermentation specialist and the issues are quite complext.  However if you
were not brewing for profit a local rabbi, trained in certification,  might
come by your house and help you out for free.


3. I am not sure what the carrier is for dry yeast (gelitin?) so would use
liquid.


4. Pre boil all pots and pans and utensils spoons in contact with the beer
or wort.  This is standard practice in kosherizing equipment.


5. Use whole flower hops to get around any processing issues that might
arise with pellets (like trace additives).


6.  Most corn sugar is kosher (or at least our rabbi is not too concerned
about which supplier we buy from).  Same with sucrose.


7. To be safe, I would not uses clarifing aids.   Especially the one that
originates from fish gills.   I think some fish are kosher and some are not.


8. Any beer will not be "kosher for passover" because of the barley and/or
wheat.  I'm sure your friend will know this.


Well, good luck.  I hope this helps.

Given that I know I am not lying and having corresponded a *lot* with
Kirk, I respect him and know he is not lying, then I think the best
thing is for him and I to take this offline, see what the differences
are and try to come to some explanation of why we are seeing such
different behaviors.  When we have a theory we can bring it back on
line for general discussion.  Hopefully, there will also be some
experimental data to back it up.  I think these two very different
experiences can help me solve the problem I have been having with slow
flow rates.

Subject: aeration of stuck wort


I posted recently asking about aerating a stuck wort.


Domenick Venezia responded that aeration  was advisable but several others 
recommended against oxygen introduction. Domenick advised me to split my 
stuck worts and aerate one and not the other as an experiment.  At that 
point I'd added a 3# dme in 3g water with a new yeast with aeration, and 
when at krausen added to the stuck wort with aeration  and the
 fermentation completed at 1.012. 


Has anyone ever experimented with splitting a stuck wort, aerating one 
part and not aerating the other?  Did the stuck wort ferment with aeration?
Did the aerated beer suffer from oxyidation?  My bottled pale ale was a 
hit at a friend's retirement party, but the wages of oxyidation may pay 
with shelf life.  I'll get the opinion of the homebrew club in a couple 
of weeks.


I realize there are many causes of stuck fermentations with inadequate 
aeration as the most frequent cause. Extract brews may lack FAN and need 
nutients, Ambient temps may be too low, and yeasties may be weak as I 
remember that the most obvious measure of a "drifted yeast" was lack of 
attenuation.; and of course "Plaid".


Cheers    jim booth, lansing, mi


P.S.  On the water thread;  what does "RO"  as in RO water mean?

Howdy!


I'm going to be doing a little yeast culturing soon for the first time. I've   


read the paper in the Brewery InfoBase and still have a few questions.


1. I'm using plastic petri dishes instead of glass test tubes. Can you still   


use the double boiler method to sterilize with steam, or will they just   
wilt?


2.  I'm using agar instead of gelatin.  Do I still need to add dme?  How much?


3.  Any suggestions?


TIA

Dave Woodstock's caution about handling sodium hydroxide - lye - is seconded
here.  Remember that lye solution dissolves animal fat to make soap, it also
dissolves or softens various other animal tissue and makes the skin slough 
off.
It is worse  to get in your eye than acid - not that either is a desirable
alternative. Dave's solution of lye in alcohol is more effective in removing
residue but it is at least  as dangerous as lye in water and I believe moreso
because the alcohol dissolves oil from the skin and dehydrates the skin by
displacing skin moisture, helping the lye do its damage. ALWAYS wear safety
glasses and rubber gloves and a long sleeved shirt and long pants when 
handling
lye at any temperature. Cold lye solution is just as effective in the long run
as warm lye solution in removing carbonaceous crud, it just takes longer.  If
you have to have it warm, put it in the vessel cold and warm the vessel.  The
hotter the lye solution is the faster it works, but is is also true that it
works faster you. Also, don't forget chlorine bleach is a solution of lye with 


chlorine in it, so be double careful.  Familiarity breeds sloppiness, so train
yourself early on to be careful and remind yourself and any assistants of the
dangers of these chemical helpers whenever you use them. I have yet to drink a 


beer I would give up my sight for.  
- ----------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Aesop has friends who turn down his home brew because they fear 
methanol
poisoning.  Assuming they are not being polite, having tasted homebrew that
wasn't at it best (not yours of course, Michael), you owe them a clear
explanation that the methanol content is largely beyond your control, as it is
for all brewers who have a clean wort, fermented with yeast intended for 
brewing
beer.


Methanol is a by product of all fermentations using S. Cervesiae, whether it 
is
used for wine or beer, it is just that occurs as a low concentration 
by-product
and in low concentrations it is apparently not harmful. When methanol, as well 


as ketones and aldehydes, are harmful is whenthey are concentrated during
distillation to give a high concentration in an alcoholic beverage.  This can
occur if the early part of the distillate is not removed, a poor separation
column ( or perhaps none at all) is used and distillate outside a certain
temperature range is collected. I have had a distilled "beverage" in China ( 
the
name escapes me for the moment) which would have been more at home in a
fingernail polish remover bottle. It smelled of ketones and I did not doubt it
had been roughly distilled once, was a grain product and probably had a high
level of methanol.  Campai or not I played W.C. Fields and spilled more than I
drank.  Thank goodness it came in thimble size cups. 


Michael, your friends have no more worry with your home brewed beverages than
with commercial brews. If they really are your friends, you have the 
obligation
to convert them to a really good drink.  
- -----------------------------------------------------
Rob Moline says he when he was home brewing, he didn't bother to stir in the
sugar solution into his secondary, just added cool, boiled dextrose solution,
waited 15/60 minutes and bottled. He characterized this approach as a Forrest
Gump approach. Maybe Forrest Gump wouldn't have noticed variations in the
bottles, I don't know. But lots of other people who use this method end up 
with
bottles broken and some flat. Brownian motion is not a dependable way to mix
sugar and brew together, in the first place the mean free path of the 
molecules
in a condensed phase is extremely short ( like angstroms) and we're talking 
tens
of centimeters in five or ten gallons here.  In the second place we're talking
major density differences in the sugar solution and the brew, so the syrup 
will
immediately fall to the bottom and stay there. I have in the past added sugar
crystals to rapidly fermenting wine and been surprized when at the end of the
fermentation the sugar crysytals were still in the bottom of the tun even 
after
some weeks, despite the agitation of the wine by the carbon dioxide bubbles.
Thirdly, diffusion is a process which is logarithmic in nature and you will
never have a uniform concentration if you waited for diffusion.  Physical
agitation whether in the secondary, a bottling bucket, or my recommendation,
each bottle, is a necessary part of uniformity of carbonation over the whole
batch of beer.


I had some inquiries by e-mail about the volume of sugar solution I add to 
each
bottle.  So here's my formula for a 5 gallon batch: for 12 oz botles I add 2
tsp; for quarts I add 2 Tlbs. of a solution of 10 oz sugar to 14 oz water,
boiled and cooled. Papazian's recommendation would be half that much sugar.

  Assuming you RECIRCULATE your INFUSION thru your MASH in a fairly constant

Subject: RIMS Definition


In #2057 jstone`at`stratacom.com (Joseph Stone) asked about what the "official" 
defintion of RIMS is.  Naturally, there isn't one, and each of us probably
has an opinion.  I think the salient features of a RIMS system, based on the
original article, are: continuous recirculation of the wort to ensure a
uniform temperature distribution throughout the wort, and some means of
feedback-based temperature control.


I like to leave the feeback loop issue open and simply say that heat energy
is applied somehwere in the system, and system response is monitored and used
to control heat input in order to maintain desired mash temperature.  I think
it's reasonable for others to say, "Well, the use of an automated feedback
control loop was pretty significant in the Morris design--that's what made it
unique."  I like to be able to include my system, which uses manual feedback
control, in the RIMS definition, since the objective is met using the same
fundamental tech: namely, recirculation to ensure uniform temp distribution.


Automated vs manual feedback control aside, note that some time back Al K.
suggested the whole thing was a misnomer: it can't be "infusion mashing" since
there are no infusions of hot liquor.  We all argued about this for a while
and Al even chastised me for selective use of the dictionary.  Since there are
already several precedents for the term "temperature control mashing" to
denote steam jacket, direct fire, or heat exchanger control of the mash, it
might be useful to call RIMS technology "control loop mashing", or
"automated feedback control (AFC) mashing" where the use of a feedback control
loop with recirculation was the essential feature.


I suggest Recirculating Automated Temperature Control mashing, or RATC, as the
most descriptive of systems using temperature controllers and recirculation.
Unfortunately, it's not an acronym, so it's doomed from the start!
