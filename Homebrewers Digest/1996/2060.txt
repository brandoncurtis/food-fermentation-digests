Subject: Cold-conditioning ales leads to O2 staling?


Thank you to those who set me straight on priming with wort vs. priming with
glucose, as a way of absorbing potentially-staling oxygen out of the
headspace etc. in bottled beer.  The consensus is that glucose will work as
well for this purpose as wort, since maltose OR glucose will be happily
consumed by the yeast, despite the Crabtree effect. 


So I'm back to my original question:  Is headspace O2 a legitimate concern,
or is it unlikely as a source of O2 leading to staling? (I'm referring to
high-melanoidin ales whose staling problem I initially thought was
melanoidin mediated; but hot-side aeration has been radically eliminated, so
it seems doubtful that early melanoidin oxidation is the cause.)


For some time, I've been fining my ales with gelatin and then
cold-conditioning them in the secondary vessel at around 4C. for a couple of
weeks, before bottling.  I have a persistent problem of these beers going
cardboardy, muddy, with loss of distinctiveness of flavor, etc., as early as
6 weeks in the bottle.  Given this kind of cold-conditioning, full
carbonation after priming/bottling can take up to a month; so the beer is
sometimes good to drink for only about two weeks...  


My question is: After cold-conditioning that drops nearly all the yeast out
of suspension, is it conceivable that the remaining low yeast contingent in
the bottle is simply insufficient to absorb oxygen quickly enough to prevent
reactions with dissolved and headspace O2 to form staling compounds? 


Thanks for any help.

Reverse Osmosis...a practice very heavily relied upon in the Dialysis
industry...(Artificial Kidney Machines)..Standard practice---> incoming h2o
passed through a resin module, you might know it as a Water Softener..thence
to a series of RO machines...(boy, if you want to learn about sanitation,
apply here... These things are monitored stricter than *.*,  daily, each
individual dialysis unit (not RO) is cleansed internally with BLEACH (and
don't you know that it wears everything out, fast!, but that's what your
Preventive Maintenances are for!)..and then each 7 days the entire h2o
structure is treated to formalin (including RO), that sits in the lines for
24/24 , prior to rinse and quant and qual checks for residuals...biological
checks done more often than the Bud Frogs croak...if you listen to the
international news, you'll know that scores have died recently from bad
water through their dialyzer... fact is, if your life's blood if going past
a membrane, and the osmotic potential on the other side is infested, you're
toast...these folks fade faster than 911 can be dialled! (And you think
sanitation is good for beer!)


RO can produce 99.99 % h2o... with only barely measureable quantities of
anything else.


Also interesting... the best known approach to CHEAP de-ETOH'ing of beer is
through dialysis..it's a well known fact amongst dialysis nurses that their
least well managed patients, despite marginal or ZERO kidney function, will
come in to be dialyzed, from time to time, totally TOASTED!  And then, when
their shunts are hooked up, and dialysis initiated , they undergo the most
RAPID detox clinically capable. Talk about early hangover!!..(can you say
happy to very unhappy in four minutes!..and then it gets bad!!..)... The
alcohol LEAPS across the membrane.. not for the squeamish!

Subject: kosher beer


I don't remember the original post (I've got it at home somewhere-maybe I'll
check it out later), but I can give you the following comments:


Kosher does not mean that some rabbi has given his blessing.  It simply
means that the preparation of the food has been in accordance with accepted
laws of Kashrut (maintaining a kosher state).  If I cook in my home, my
friends will eat my food because they know that I follow these laws.  


Now the problem of the original poster is that he/she is not familiar with
these laws.  No problem.  Beer is made from four major ingredients.  Malted
grain is simple grain which has been sprouted and kilned.  I doubt if the
large maltsters have kosher certification (maybe some surprises there,
though) and the breweries in Israel use malt to produce kosher beer. Malt
extract is boiled in some sort of vessel.  It's probably safe to assume that
the vessels are used exclusively for boiling wort and therefore ok.   


Hops is a plant.  All plants are kosher if not tampered with.  Whole leaf
hops are safest as someone commented, but pellets are simply compressed
whole leaf hops, so should be no problem there.  Yeast is used in many
applications for kosher food from breadmaking to winemaking and including
beer brewing.  I am not familiar with any adulterants in dry yeast cultures.
I'm not sure about Wyeast, but it looks to me like the liquid in the smack
packs is simply dark wort.  Water is kosher.


Regarding clearing agents.  Someone mentioned in a previous post to avoid
fish gill derived agents.  I agree.  I never use them anyway.  So the beer's
a bit cloudy, but I digress.  Irish moss, being plant in origin, is OK.


Bottom line, FWIW: I brew beer from grain and on occasion from extract.  I
use both leaf and pellet hops.  I use both dry and Wyeast.  I don't use
clearing agents.  BTW, I use gypsum and phosphoric acid to acidify my mash
and sparge, respectively.  These are ok.  A lot depends on how fanatical
your friend is about his kashrut.  Ask him.  I drink my beer.  So do my
friends.  


Your biggest problem is likely to be not your ingredients, but your vessels.
If any of your vessels, mash tun, cooker, fermentor, bottles, stirrers,
spoons, etc., have come in contact in the past with anything non-kosher,
then they will render the brew non-kosher.  Consult with your friend.


Final warning.  I am not a rabbi.  Nor am I familiar intimately with every
detail of malting, malt extract preparation, hops harvest and storage, hop
pellet preparation, commercial yeast production, Wyeast production.
However, what I outlined above seems reasonable to me and I have grown up
keeping Kashrut.


Glad to help.

Subject: Reverse Rims?


Here's a thought for all you all grain brewers:


Instead of recirculating and heating the wort while mashing in a Gott
cooler, why not pump your hot sparge water through 1/2 inch 
copper coils immersed in the mash?  It seems to me that with some gentle 
stirring (using the copper coils already in the mash) one could maintain
a reasonably even temperature distrubution and even raise the mash
temp by pumping near boiling water through the coils.


Any thoughts positive or negative would be appreciated.

Subject: Acetaldehyde


Last night's TV  evening news had a story on an ingredient that cigarette
manufacturers were adding to their product to make them more addictive. The
culprit was acetaldehyde. Yes, that same acetaldehyde found in beer. It is
the compound  that gives the green apple character found in those beers with
kraeusening and/or incomplete fermentation.
It was found that rats given acetaldehyde will crave increasingly larger
doses, especially if combined with nicotine. This may explain why former
cigarette smokers backslide while drinking Bud ( The King of Green Apple
Beers) and why Bud drinkers a such fanatics.
So, watch out all you homebrewing rats. The FDA may be after you next.

Subject: RE:  What does RO mean?


     Kathy asks what RO means:
     
     RO means "reverse osmosis."  It is a method of water purification.  It 
     is the opposite of osmosis, the phenomenon in which concentration 
     gradients will spontaneously approach equilibrium.  As an example of 
     osmosis, you have a membrane that is permeable to water, but 
     impermeable to ions. On one side of the membrane is pure water, on the 
     other is water with a high concentration of sodium ions (Na+).  Pure 
     water will flow spontaneously through the membrane to the side with 
     the high concentration of Na+, so as to try to equilibrate the ion 
     concentration in the system.
     
     This effect has relevance to brewers: it can kill your yeast cells.  
     If your yeast have been raised in a high-sugar environment, and are 
     suddenly put into a lower-sugar environment, water may enter the cells 
     (by osmosis) faster than the cells can pump it out, causing them to 
     burst.
     
     RO purifies water by forcing water (using pressure) through the 
     membrane against the concentration gradient, leaving pure water on one 
     side and a high concentration of "junk" on the other.  In this way 
     organics, inorganic ions, microbes, and particles are removed from 
     water.

Subject: Kosher!


Reading through the Kosher beer text, I have one point to question.  
Although not a home beer-brewer, I do make wine at home, and have done 
quite a bit of traveling in the wine country, including kosher wineries.  
>From my understanding, yeast is never kosher, in any form.  Ever for 
bread.  Bread must be made from a starter batch that has risen naturally, 
and wine must be made through airborn yeast or through repitching from 
the lees of a batch made from the same-said.  Fining agents that may be 
used (as far as I understand it) are egg whites and skim milk.  But check 
me on those.  I know that milk is not allowed with meat, so if any 
residual milk were present when bottled, and you drank it with a meal of 
a steak, then that would be out of the question.  
As I say, I have not read up on this, but have figured it through some 
questions to Jewish friends and kosher wineries.  It is possible it is 
completely different for beer.  
post or private e-mail ok

I've had very good results using silicone tubing. Temp. range is -50 to +450
deg. F. At boiling wort temps, it does not soften like vinyl tubing sold at 
brew
shops and hardware stores. I do not have to use tubing clamps when I siphon 
from
the boiling kettle to the wort chiller, and there is no 'plastic' smell or
taste. The only problem is $$; about $4/ft for 3/8" id. But, it lasts a long
time. Try looking under "scientific supply" in the yellow pages. VWR, for one,
has the product (1-800-932-5000; no connections, etc.). Anyone else have a 
good
source for silicone tubing for a good price? Good luck!

Why not? Isn't matzoh made from wheat?  I thought it was the combination of 
grain and yeast that was not kosher. Would filtering a beer make it kosher (as 


well as less-flavorful)?

Subject: Gott Coolers/Partial Mashes


Greetings Fellow Beerlings:


Does anyone have the model number of the 10 gal. round Gott cooler that
will handle hot as well as cold liquids???  The salesperson at my local
big orange hardware mega-store looked at me like I was nuts (does it
show?).


Also I started doing partial mashes on the road to all-grain brewing.
After mashing and sparging I had to leave the wert in the brewpot for
about 1.5~2 hours before finishing up the brew.  There was "stuff" in
the bottom of the pot when I stirred the wert and it became very cloudy.
Should I have siphoned off the clear wert and tossed the "stuff" before
continuing???  For what its worth the recipe was Bohemian Rhapsody Pils
from Homebrew Favorites.  The first attempt at this recipe came out
beyond great and well into spectacular (IMHO) and I'm hoping to recreate
it.


Thanks for any info.

You do not need rabbinical supervision.  Uncooked ingredients (such as
hops, yeast, raw grain) are kosher.

I don't know about malt extract.  You're probably alright, though, as
long as these companies don't produce anything other than malt
extract (see below).


Malting grains does not make them non-kosher (nothing but water is
being added, and no cooking is involved).


Cooked ingredients (kilned grains) are kosher if the vessels in which
they are cooked were not used for trafe (nonkosher) cooking (pork or
shellfish; or for cooking both meat- and dairy-containing dishes)).


Generally, kilned grains are kosher.  I have a friend who is a
chassidic rabbi, and he's told me that pretty much all commercially
available beers are considered kosher, as they don't produce anything
else with that same equipment (he loves Shmuel (Sam) Adams -- he
"kashers" it by drawing the traditional Lebovich beard and hat on
Sam's face [as a joke, of course]).  His wife drinks AB products.


> 4.  Is there a traditional Jewish style of beer?


No, the kicker in Judaism is wine (which does need rabbinical
supervision to make, as it is used in other religious ceremonies).
Maccabee Brown Ale is very popular in Israel, though.


> 5.  Is there a fee structure for Rabbinical supervision?


I don't know, but, as I said, it is not necessary.  If you'd like, you
should go to a synogogue and look up the local rabbi.  I'm sure he or
she would be happy to answer your questions.


> 6.  Would I need the Rabbi's signature on the label?


No.


> 7.  Is this a bridge too far for the ordinary home brewer?


Well, the biggest hurdle is making sure that YOUR equipment is kosher.
Have any of the vessels or implements (anything that will touch the
beer when it is cooking) been used in non-kosher cooking?  Or has all
of your stuff only been used for beer making?  Have you ever boiled
lobsters in your pot?  Used your spoon for both meat and dairy dishes?


You can kasher (make kosher) your own equipment if you feel it is
necessary.  A pot can be kashered by filling it with water, bringing
the water to a boil, and dropping a rock into it so that the water
overflows -- if you are using an enameled pot, be careful!.  You can
kasher your cooking implements by filling a kosher pot with water,
bringing it to a boil, and dropping in your spoons and the like so
that the water overflows.


        Hope this helps,
        Bill

Subject: Brewery (RIMS?) Pump


To:  INTERNET:homebrew`at`aob.org
 
I've received a lot of response from my post in which I asked about the 
suitability of a particular cheap pump for RIMS.  The consensus of numbers 
suggest that it probable is suitable, but I'll leave the final resolution 
of that issue for Dion, et al.
 
So many people wrote to ask where to buy the pump because they just 
wanted something inexpensive to move water and wort around, that I'm 
posting the info:
 
     Surplus Center                800 488 3407   
     1015 West "O" Street
     PO Box 82209
     Lincoln, NE 68501
     
     Circulator Pump, item 2-1045, $13,
     1996 catalog, top left of page 103.
 
I have no affiliation with Surplus Center.  If I did I might try and do 
something about their poor service.  Telephones are usually busy.  If you do 
get through, then it's a long hold.  But the worse part is their very bad 
delivery.  In today's world of instant gratification, their delivery via 
standard UPS to the east coast is often OVER 2 weeks.  I doubt that this is 
due to UPS who normally delivers within ~5 work days even from the west coast.
________
 
NOTE: One of the reasons this pump may be cheap is that the 240VAC it
requires may make it unpopular.  Even if you don't have a 240VAC circuit 
available, it is simple to get the required supply voltage using a step-up 
transformer.  Surplus Center carries some inexpensive step-up transformers.
 
Another factor affecting it price may be that the pump is physically small.  
Its housing is only 1.5" Dia X 2.0" L.

Flint Harding writes:


>8. Any beer will not be "kosher for passover" because of the barley and/or
>wheat.  I'm sure your friend will know this.


There is nothing inherent in either wheat or barley that would keep them
from being "kosher for passover".  Matzoh (the traditional unleavened
Passover cracker) is made from primarily wheat and barley is a common
ingredient in many Jewish soup recipes, served sometimes at Passover (but
mostly you get matzohball soup).


What is not kosher for passover is any bread or cake that has been leavened
or in other words allowed to rise.  This is usually caused by yeast, but
leavening by baking powder is out too.


One might assume, therefore, that NO beer can be kosher for passover because
it contains yeast.  Can't say for sure, but my opinion would be that yeast
itself is not a problem because WINE is an integral part of the passover
seder (meal) and we know that is fermented by the actions of yeast the same
as beer.  Using this reasoning, I would assume that beer could be construed
to be kosher for passover.  When the dietary laws were written, they didn't
know yeast existed, and various rabbinical bodies over the years have
interpreted and reinterpreted the laws (dietary and otherwise) to fit the
times.  


The key to producing kosher beer is probably that NONE of the vessels or
utensils used in the process can have ever been used to make or have touched
something that was non-kosher - certain types of gelatin being the most
likely suspects in a brewery.  This is doubly true if you're conecerned
about kosher for passover.  Another tangent is that any utensil or equipment
that has been used to cook dairy products can not be used to prepare meat
dishes and vice versa.  Therefore it follows that if any of your utensils
have been used for dairy and/or meat (but not both) then it doesn't make the
beer non-kosher, but "dairy utensil made beer" could not be consumed with
meat and vice versa.  Utensils used for both are therfore non-kosher and
can't be used at all.


Beer, BTW, would be considered pareve (you may have seen that word on food
products) which means it is neither dairy or meat and can be served with 
either.


All of this pretty esoteric, I realize.  You'll need to talk to your friend
and find out how he/she keeps kosher.  Some are strict - three sets of
plates and utensils - one for dairy, one for meat one for passover.  Some
are not so strict - just don't eat meat with dairy and avoid "traif" foods
like pork and shellfish.  Once you know the level of kosher, you can decide
how to proceed accordingly.  A rabbi's certification is absolutely
unnecessary in any case.

Subject: Irish brown ale


Hello all,


I would like to get some ideas for brewing an Irish brown ale.
I am attempting to brew all grain soon, but for this brew, I want to
brew mostly extract (I'm trying to teach some people the basics of home-
brewing). The only problem is that I don't even know where to start for
this type of brew. I have never brewed anything other than pale ale and
light bodied brews. According to "The New Complete Jow of Home Brewing",
there are to basic ways of making a brown ale.
1) 5-6 lbs. Light malt extract ; .5 lbs. crystal ; .25 lbs black patent
   and .25 lbs chocolate malt.
2) 5-6 lbs. amber malt extract ; .25 lbs black patent or .25 lbs choc.


I assume that I will use Irish ale yest since I'm brewing an Irish ale.
Any ideas for the boiling hops? I din't want to use much finishing hops
because I don't want the hop character to be too strong (I'm not much on
hop flavor overpowering the malt).
All help is greatly apprecialted.

Subject: Yeast growth


I have been recently reading the CAMRA Homebrewing book and a very nice
read it is, too.  The author stated that oxygen in the wort caused the
yeast to respire and multiply.  From my understanding, what has been said
before in hbd, the yeast will not respire in the presence of fermentable
sugars in the wort.  Is this not correct?  The gist of what the books author
said was fine in that he was pointing out that oxygen was necessary for
yeast growth and should not be present later.  I just wanted to make sure
I really understood the process.  A part I am still not sure of, though,
is what causes the yeast to go into a reproductive phase.  Is it the
presence of oxygen and fermentable sugars?  If this is the case, will they
enter their reproductive stage again if oxygen is introduced later while
there are still fermentable sugars present?  I think A.J. deLange said that
in hbd #2059.  It would seem to make sense.  Also, if the reproductive or
growth stage produces undesirable byproducts then most of us must get them
in our brews as we usually underpitch and aerate the wort.  If reusing
yeast from a previous batch where there is probably an adequate amount,
should we avoid aerating the wort to avoid yeast entering a growth phase and
producing these undesirable byproducts?  I suppose for brews done from
starters we have to aerate our wort and just accept the byproducts as an
adequate amount of yeast from a starter seems unlikely.  I usually begin
my starter with 8 oz. of 1.020 wort, add a pint of 1.040 a couple of days
later and then a quart of 1.040 a couple of days later.  I am never sure
if the yeast has settled out at each addition so do not know whether to
decant the liquid before the new addition of wort.  It would seem that it
should be decanted before pitching, though.  My three step starters never
seem to have what looks to me to be enough yeast for me to pitch without
aerating the wort.  I try to aerate the wort for the starter by pouring
back and forth several times and then shaking the hell out of the jar after
adding.  I am thinking of buying an oxygen bottle so I can be sure I have
enough O2 in solution.  I understand the yeast clear the O2 from the wort
in short order but how long should it take for them to complete what growth
they are going to have and settle out?  How long should I wait after each
step to be safe in decanting the liquid.  Or should I even worry until
time to pitch?


In another vein, the author of the CAMRA book also said to store hops in
a cold dark place but to not freeze them.  I keep my hops in purged Mason
jars in the freezer.  Am I screwing up?  Could his advice apply only to fresh
hops?  I use plugs and pellets.


In still another vein, my brewing water is very soft and low ph.  I don't
see that I would need added calcium for acidification since the water is
already acidic but do I need it for break formation and for the yeast?  If so,
won't the mash be acidified even more?  Will adding calcium carbonate add
the required (if any) calcium and raise the ph?  For my pilsners, I suppose
my water should be fine as is but I wonder about the calcium thing and the
break.  Since the water in Pilzen (sp?) is reputed to be quite soft, I guess
I should be o.k.  But what about the acidity?
Also, when brewing ales, I suppose I would need gypsum for the sulphate but
wouldn't that lower the ph unacceptably?  It seems most things I read about
water treatment is for hard, high ph water, just the opposite of mine.


Lots of questions, eh?  Sorry for the use of bandwidth but these things
have been puzzling me.


Thanks,

Subject: RE: Washing Yeast (Thompson HBD2059)


In HBD2059 Greg Thompson asked about washing yeast. Greg, it sounds like
you're not washing it enough. Here's how I do it:


1. Prepare 3 one qt mason jars with lids by filling each half way with
water. Place the jars in a canning pot (like your brewpot), filling the
brewpot with about 2 inches of water. Lay the lids (do not screw them on) on
top of the jars, and bring the pot with jars and water to a boil. Simmer
with lid on pot for 15-20 mins. Let this cool, and when cool enough to
handle, screw the lids on the jars. Within minutes, they will seal. Let them
cool to room temp. You now have 3 sealed one-half full mason jars of
sanitized water.


2. After siphoning, open one of the jars and pour the water into your
bucket. Swish it around until all the settled yeast, hops, etc. are loose
and pour this back into your now-empty mason jar. Don't worry that you can't
get all the slurry into the jar. Put the lid on the jar and shake well. Let
sit 10-15 minutes - you will now note a separation of a somewhat light
greenish milky water and darker greenish trub at the bottom.


3. Open jar #2 and pour off the lighter liquid from jar #1 into jar #2.
Shake again. Wait again 10-15 minutes.


4. Open jar #3 and pour off the lighter liquid from jar #2 into jar #3.
Shake well. Place this jar in your fridge for 3-5 days.


5. After 3-5 days, your jar will have 85-90 percent what appears to be beer
(amber-brown liquid), a layer of white (yeast), and some minimal trub
(green). I usually, for the sake of space, pour off the beer and pour the
yeast/trub into a smaller jar with some cooled boiled water. I have put this
in the fridge for three months and reused it with great results.


Another recent post stated that you could simply retrieve the trub and store
it for re-use within a few weeks. This is probably true, but from what I've
read, the washing removes the heavier particles from the yeast, allowing the
yeast to survive longer.


Also don't worry that you appear to end up with only a few ounces of yeast.
Mine become active within 6 - 12 hours.


BTW, I've also found that Wyeast 1056, when washed and reused, appears to
have higher flocculation resulting in a clearer beer. 


Happy brewing!

I think the most likely explanation for your observation is simple
coincidence. In fact, it's quite likely that the differences you've observed
in extraction efficiency are not significant at a commonly accepted level of
statistical confidence (eg. 95%), indicating a high probability of random
correlation between unrelated variables. If higher extraction rates
invariably produced higher quality beer, I'm certain this observation would
have been previously reported in the brewing literature, yet I've never come
across such a reference. Another possibility stems from 'beer judge bias'.
Bigger beers tend to win in competitions. Most experienced brewers know this
and use it to advantage when brewing beers for competitions. I don't doubt
the fact that the beers that you say did better in competitions tasted
better, but I do doubt that this can be attributed to increased extraction
efficiency with any confidence. There's more to making great beer than just
squeezing every last drop of sugar from the malt. The process used is
extremely important, particularly for certain specific beer styles.

Aha! It's highly probable that your observation can be attributed to
"improving the process" (i.e. extraction rate increased along with improved
beer quality). The fact that the two events are correlated does not indicate
causation. For example, if I use the same ingredients for two batches of
doppelbock, but mash one using a step infusion program and the other using a
triple decoction (i.e. same recipe, different processes), the
decoction-mashed beer tastes better (otherwise, why bother?). Sometimes the
extraction rate is slightly increased as well, as a result of the long,
intensive decoction mashing program. In this case, the increased extract is
a bonus; the improvement in flavor is due to the formation of melanoidins
during boiling of the decoctions, not an increase in extraction efficiency.
This is demonstrated by the fact that even in decoction-mashed beers which
didn't have a higher extraction efficiency, the distinctive malty aromas and
flavors are obviously present.

Please cite the source of this information. I have yet to see any

True, to some extent, but I don't think that extraction is one of those
elusive mysteries of the brewers art. While I agree that there isn't a
viable scientific explanation for everything, the volume of scientific
literature pertaining to the brewing process is truly immense, and most of
the details of the physical process of extraction are understood quite well
(and have been for quite some time). I submit that there are good
explanations available for the vast majority of brewing processes which
affect malt flavor and that through diligent scientific inquiry and
subsequent discussion, we can obtain answers to the rest of our questions as
well. Welcome to the 21st century!

How illegal does it need to be?  I've provided homebrew for charity purposes

system.  I sell the cups, and note that with a cup, free homebrew is 
available.  Without a cup, you're drinking Bud, baby.  Price?  Whatever the 
traffic will bear, usually 2-5 bucks for our relatively broke conservation

The first year was rough, not too many takers, but this last year a bottle

the money went for a good cause, and again because people I'd never met 
liked my beer.
We all won.


In your situation, sell the bottle.  Put it in a swing-top or some other

A saccharification rest at 155-160F is (at best) at the upper limit of the
saccharification temperature range, and will produce a very high ratio of
unfermentables to fermentables. Additionally, conversion at these
temperatures requires a much longer period than at cooler temps (say 150F),
so I don't think a 30 minute rest is going to do the job. Even if you did
get full conversion, you're leaving quite a bit of sugars in the grain by
just lifting the grain bag out of the mash pot and letting the mash liquid
drain. You need to have some kind of system where you run hot water (~170F)
through the grain bed in order to "rinse" the sugars from the grain. If you
intend to progress to all-grain brewing, my advice is to build a sparge tun
(I think that the cheapest and easisest is the "zapap" described in
Papazians  book).


Chris' post got me thinking about a question that has been on my mind for a
while now: When we make high gravity beers, we usually take the first
runnings from the mash for the high gravity beer, and then either use
subsequent runnings for a "small" beer or just discard the remaining sugars
with the grain. My question is why don't we just keep recirculating the
first runnings until all the soluble sugars are "rinsed" from the grain? The
first runnings are obviously not saturated with sugars (or else we wouldn't
be able to perform concentrated boils with malt extract) so we should still
be able to dissolve additional sugars into these runnings. I guess the
easiest way to answer this question would be just to try it and see what
happens, but if anyone has any ideas or insights, I'd love to hear them.

Hi


I've got some great stuff that I have to sell in the SF Bay Area.  I need to
sell this by Friday 6/7 if possible:


1. One 5-foot refridgerator with a tap on the front door.  Works perfect, very
   clean, very quiet.  $75


2. Two 5-gallon soda kegs, all the fittings, no leaks.  $30 for both.


3. One dual-guage regulator, almost new, very clean.  $40


4. One CO2 tank, no leaks, almost full.  $45


These prices are really just a guess, so if I'm asking too much, feel free to
make me a more reasonable offer.  I'm not selling these to get rich (I'm just
moving, and I don't have the room anymore) but I should still get at least as
much as the local homebrew supply store would give me.


You can email me at either of these addresses:

I thought she got married and didn't do stuff like that anymore.  I hear

I think that "thistle" is the same plant, or nearly so, as Heather.  Not

Subject: When does your beer become beer?


My boyfriend and I began brewing beer early this year.  The cost and
unavailablility of good beer (except at some of the few excellent
microbreweries) in UTAH pushed us into doing it.  We have had great
success so far, but we have an ongoing dispute.


In determining the age of your beer, when is ground zero?  Or, when
does your beer become beer?  I won't say which one of us holds which
opinion, in case there is a tendency to gender bias.  Here are the differing
opinions we have:


- - - - One of us says it is beer as soon as you pitch the yeast.


- - - - The other of us says it is beer when it has finished
conditioning/carbonating...about a week or so after bottling.


What does the homebrewing public have to say about it?

Subject: Muddy brew


I've been brewing almost 3 years and doing all grains about a year.  I had a
really strange brew experience the last batch and would welcome comments.


I made an all grain batch to use as my first kegged batch.  I wanted a simple
beer just in case something didn't work out and I ruined it in the kegging
process.  The grain bill was:  8 lb of two row, 0.75 lb of crystal 60 and 0.5
lb of Munich.  The mash, sparge and boil went great and I was beginning to
think I got this all grain thing down pat!  I used 2oz of Hallertau pellets
(60 min and 15 min).  I collected about 7 gallons from the sparge and boiled
it down to 5 gallons.  I used a CF chiller and cooled the batch within 10
minutes.  Primary fermentation was at about 68 F for a week in glass.
 Secondary was at about 55 F (thanks to Ken Schwartz's chiller box) in glass
for a week.


Now, here's the problem.  The batch looks like muddy water!  The OG was 1.052
and after a week it was 1.019.  It dropped to 1.012 after a week in the
secondary.  Once in the fermenter it always looked muddy and never really
cleared.  I used one pack of dry ale yeast since I didn't have time to make a
starter.


I figure my problem could be one of several things:


1.  When I chilled the batch, I adjusted the flow of both cooling water and
wort so the wort cooled to about 70F.  It ran into the chiller quite clear
but came out cloudy.  I think maybe I din't precipitate the cold break enough
and instead of dropping out in the fermenter it just stayed as a sort of
emulsion.


2.  The yeast is a really lousy flocculator and is just staying in
suspension.


3.  The yeast is contaminated and I have bacterial growth.  I kinda doubt
this since the batch has no strange odor or flavor.  Its not the best batch I
ever made, but it's not really that bad.


4.  The beer gods were angry with me on brewing day.


BTW, I kegged the batch and haven't had any trouble with that part so far.
 Problem is that dispensing it makes it look even worse.  That's why I think
"1" is the most probable problem.


Oh yeah, I did a single infusion with the strike water at about 170 and
setlling in to about 155 for an hour.  No protein rest.


I'd appreciat any comments either in HBD or private Email.


Thanks to anyone who responds.

Either way, I think the point is that temperature *control* is not done with
hot liquor infusions.  I would assume most RIMS users try to do an initial
mash-in with water at an appropriate strike temperature (or lower) for the
first rest, but thereafter no water is added.

Perhaps. But I'll have had the enjoyment of building my RIMS, I'll be
done sooner and with much less effort, especially if you're brewing
a style that calls for a stepped infusion mash or a decoction mash.
And I'll also be able to reproduce it much more accurately.

Some experience here, although I'm still sorta new at this RIMS
thing.  Here's my data point.  My (hot water) heating element is
electrical, about 8" long, and rated at 1500W/120V.  It's actually
sorta under-powered, as I think it takes me a bit longer than normal
to boost my mashing temps.  One to 1.5 degrees F per minute is
average, but mine takes a bit longer.  I wonder if a longer element
would solve this, as opposed more power.  Also, I've noticed only
very small delta-Ts across my heating element (2oF).  At any rate, I
think the answer to you question is, No, you shouldn't have to worry
about scortching your wort or denaturing your enzymes with the unit 
you describe."

Heh.  After all is said and done, I'd like to see if there _is_ any
gender bias.

Wrongo.  At the moment of pitching, one has a 5 gallon drum of really
nasty sweet stuff.  This is known as wort...

We all know that you would NEVER sell your homebrews. Illegal. Tut tut. But
what could it hurt for you to DONATE a few bottles to the charitable
organization. Someone who wanted to sample them could DONATE some money to
the charity.


Now let's be clear here, I'm no lawyer. (No applause, please.) But let's
hope that the powers that be have better things to do.
