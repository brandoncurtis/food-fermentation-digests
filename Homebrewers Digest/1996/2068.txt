chlorine + acid = ?   death?


My question is: what is the reaction between chlorine and acids which are
harmful to people?  I'd like to have some firm info on what quantities of
reactants produce something harmful to humans.  My ingnorant guess is that
chlorine, in the miniscule quantities neede to sanitize homebrew equipment,
poses no threat when mixed with acid. But I'd prefer not to be dead wrong <g!>

Has anyone taken their CO2-based kegging wisdom and done 
anything to emulate nitro-dispensed Guinness?  I'm 
getting hitched and wanted to include Guinness at the 
after-wedding party.  


Quick-n-dirty ways of faking a good pour for a few 
hours of party service come to mind first.  For example,
perhaps doing the appropriate amount of nitrogen pressure
into a second (empty) keg connected to the gas-in point of
the Guinness keg might work to get me thru the night more
or less.  Or (though this one seems doomed by the absorption
rate of CO2, etc.) somehow using CO2 and getting the
pour I want.


Second would be advice from anyone that's done a home-
cobbled nitrogen regulator setup.  As I understand, US
bars that are serving Guinness under nitrogen are doing
a high-p.s.i. (70p.s.i.g.?) system, since that much
pressure is needed to get the nitrogen to dissolve into
solution (compared to the 8-12p.s.i.g. range needed for
similar solubility with CO2).  Then, there's a mechanism
at the tap they fiddle with that seems to be acting as
another pressure drop to avoid Guinness geysers.  A
home job of this would seem to involve a nitrogen tank,
dual regulator, perhaps that pressure-valve tap... whew...
just to get that remarkable head and taste...


Come to think of it, maybe I'll just buy six dozen
widget cans...

I was perusing the list of winners of the National Homebrew Competition 
in the last special issue of Zymurgy and happened to note the following 
facts:
     +     Not one of the winners was brewed in a single-stage 
fermentation, every one used a secondary fermentation and a substantial 
number went on to a tertiary.
     +     Not one was brewed at a fermentation temperature of over 72F, 
and all but one were at 70F or below.
     +     Plastic fermenters were all but absent; in the few cases where 
they did appear they were used only for the primary fermentation with the 
secondary and tertiary, if any, in glass or stainless.
     +     Not one (I'm working from memory and am not positive about 
this) used extract as its primary malt base, though some used it to 
supplement their grain bill.
     (The foregoing comments do not include the mead, cider, or saki 
winners, but they do apply to all the others, ales and lagers alike.)
      Being a beginning brewer who is getting ready to do an 
extract-plus-steeped-specialty-malts brew in a single-stage plastic 
fermenter at a fermentation temperature of 72-79F, should this be telling 
me something?
      If I wanted to change one or more of these factors, and 
presuming that I'm currently interested only in brewing ales, how would 
you rank them in importance?  My guess would be that the plastic issue 
would be last, presuming that I properly control sanitation and 
avoid scratching the plastic.  The secondary fermentation would probably 
be next from the bottom, since I'm limiting myself to ales (i.e. short 
periods of time on the yeast and trub).  The other two, I'm not so 
certain about.  I'm just not certain which would have the more important 
impact on the finished product.  I _suspect_ it would be grain vs. 
extract, but the longer conditioning made possible by the lower 
temperatures could be just as important.  In fact, instinct tells me that 
the temperature and secondary fermentation issues are, per se, less 
important than extract vs. grain because, I suspect, they just don't have 
as much effect on an extract or extract+specialties brew as they do on a 
partial mash or all-grain brew.
     Your comments would be much appreciated...

    Malignant hyperthermia is rare, but has been fairly well-characterized
(particularly in pigs) and approximately one in ten-thousand anesthetized
individuals develop the chain reaction of symptoms: the muscles contract
uncontrollably and get very hot, causing a high fever, then muscular
rigidity, rapid heartbeat, increased blood CO2 levels, and convulsions soon
follow. Usually it occurs during surgery under general anesthesia, and thus
is often not fatal, since the victim is already in the hospital and doctors
are readily available to treat the condition. Administration of dantrolene
(a calcium-channel blocker) has proved effective in saving 93% of
hospitalized patients (mostly humans and pigs) exhibiting this reaction.
    In pigs, a mutation (somatic dominant) has been identified in one of the
genes (calcium release channel, aka ryanodine receptor [RYR]) controlling
muscle contraction. This mutation has been shown to be the cause of
predisposition to malignant hyperthermia in pigs. However, the prevalence of
this mutation is unknown in all species, and it would be prudent to assume
that all animals, including humans, dogs (all breeds, not just Greyhounds),
cats, livestock, etc. are potentially susceptible to hops poisoning, until
more data are collected and analyzed.

Okay, I've been trying to send this for days, and I just realized I've been 
sending it to aob.COM instead of aob.ORG!!!  Sometimes it really is just 
operator error (as hard as it is for me to admit that <g>).  This is a 
little late, but I've updated it somewhat:
 ---------
(Bob `at` Flour Daniel in Greenville, SC provided a critique of a local 
brewery)
Bob, Bob, Bob, <shaking head in dismay>


The place you visited was NOT a microbrewery!  You were in one of the THREE 
BrewPUBS in Greenville.  And since there IS also a Microbrewery in 
Greenville, I think you owe Dave Bracken, head brewer of same, a public 
apology for casting aspersions upon his product and his practices.  BTW, 
Dave started out as a homebrewer (I suspect he even owns a copy of "TCJHB") 
and he is currently producing 2 excellent beers: Caesar's Head Amber, and 
Caesar's Head Pale Ale, both available at local restaurants (e.g. Macaroni 
Grill) on tap and at Biermeisters in bottles.


Bob, next time you want to slam someone, either name them or make sure that 
noone will be confused about your target.


You may want to visit the Downtown Brewing Company or the Blue Ridge Brewery 
for technical advice (and I bet our local homebrew shop, aka Biermeisters, 
would be happy to answer questions), as The Chicago Brew Pub has closed its 
doors.  It seems there were just too many obstacles for them to overcome, 
ranging from lack of a knowledgable brewer, to inattention to details like 
service and quality.  Additionally, with 2 more professionally run brewpubs 
slated to open here soon, there wasn't enough time to turn the operation 
around.  (This is entirely my own opinion, based on very slim info gleaned 
from locals "in-the-know").  And I bet I know where there's a reasonably 
priced brewpub available if anyone is interested... <g>


As for the newest brewer having the "TCJHB" at his side, considering the 
lack of training he received, I give him credit for at least trying to learn 
what his new job was about.  And face it, who do we regularly refer newbies 
to?  He learned enough from Charlie to know that he needed help, and then he 
went looking for help.  It was just too little, too late.


Sorry if my being rubbed the wrong way chafes anyone else...its just that 
the specialty beer industry is an infant here in Greenville, and I for one, 
would like to see it flourish.

My 1.055ish ESB's typically ferment down to 1.015 or so with this yeast.
It is extremely flocculant, and needs to be roused 3-4 days after pitching.

Gee, I dunno Russ. I can't conceive of any situation in life where a person
is worse off by virtue of being knowledgable. Of course, some people actually
believe ignorance is bliss, so I guess such people would not share that
opinion.

Consider then how you would feel when you encounter a beer that's free
of defects, a perfect example of a style. Like the time I wandered into a
pub in Bath, England just as a fresh cask of Worthington's IPA was being
tapped. Pronounced, clean hop bitterness, beautifully balanced by a malt
character with slight caramel notes, and a dry, hoppy finish that lingered
forever - heaven! Or last fall at a cider picnic I attended where a keg of
fresh Spaten Ur Octoberfest was served. Clean, incredibly smooth malt
character, felt like silk on the palate. I don't think I moved more than
10 feet from that keg all afternoon.


Of course, if one doesn't have enough knowledge to appreciate what's in the
glass on such occasions, the whole, joyous experience is lost. Now who's
the poorer??

Subject: Silly troob question


Hi all,


First, I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my query regarding
dry yeast vs. liquid yeast cultures.  The 100% opinion is that I
should use liquid yeast and it will be the biggest improvement to my
home brewing that I will make.  Even a larger improvement than going
to all-grain!  I'll be making the switch.  Cheers!


Anyway, on with my silly question.


I am still having a slight troob problem.  After boiling my wort I
use an immersion wort chiller and cool the wort to +-70 f in about 15
min.  There is a definite / visible cold break.  However, not all of
the coagulated proteins drop to the bottom, a significant amount is
free floating.  Also, after racking or transferring to a secondary
there is still a significant amount of troob  in the bottom of my
primary.  BTW, I use hop pellets in a bag, so I don't have a natural
filter bed of leaves.


Question:
Should I let my cooled wort settle in the brewpot for an unspecified
amount of time (in order to let the troob settle) before I transfer to
my primary?  Even more trivial.... *How* should I transfer the cooled
wort from my brew pot to the secondary???  I can pick the silly pot up
and pour it through a funnel right into the primary, but this may
transfer the troob as well if I'm not careful.  I seem to recall in
Papazian that the wort was transferred via a smaller (2 quart pot??). 
Is this the way people do it?


Any advice people could offer would be appreciated.  Maybe I'm missing
some simple piece of information.


Thanks in advance.
Happy Brewing!!!
Dave

I don't think you have a problem.  I have been an all extract/specialty 
 grain brewer for over 6 years now, and those gravities seem acceptable 
 for that type of brewing.  1.048 to 1.018 is quite acceptable.  The 
 first batch, (dark = stout or porter?), may have had an even higher 
 starting gravity, so 1.022 is ok as well.  Most importantly - how does 
 the beer taste?  Is it good?  Is it the best damn beer you've ever 
 made?  Does it make you want to keep brewing?  If so, you're on the 
 right track!


There are a couple of things that you may already have picked up 
 through HBD and r.c.b.  If not, I'll give you a brief starting point:  
 pitching sufficient amounts of liquid yeast and aeration of your 
 cooled  wort;  I've found that these have improved my beer immensely!!  


>My understanding is that SG denotes density of

>extract-no sugar until priming) would have a higher overall ending SG?


Be aware that different extracts provide different amounts of 
 fermentables.  I've found that Munton&Fison seems to ferment out more 
 fully than John Bull (but in the JB Amber - I *like* that quality!).


>Should I throw away the hydrometer and have a homebrew?


No, and yes!!  You don't need to master (or even use) use the tools of 
 the trade; but I am an advocate of *learning* about them for process, 
 form, and function; then if you decide that it's not a step necessary 
 in _your_ process, at least you will have made an informed decision! 


>What would be a good transition to malt extract/partial grain brew? Is it too
>soon to attempt it? 


Never!  I suggest a porter or a stout - my first specialty grain brew 
 was Sparrow Hawk Porter from CP's first book, and it came out damn 
 good!  Stepping from all malt to specialty grain to partial grain to 
 all grain is a good way to gauge your brewing interest/experience.  My 
 own experience was that I got *really* into extract brewing the first 
 couple of years (30-40 batches), then I moved out of my house, went 
 back to school, found that I didn't have the time, space, or interest 
 to continue brewing for a couple of years (besides - I still had 
 *cases* of reserve to drink through - and I have ;->).  Now that I am 
 back working and bought another house, I'm back into brewing (12 
 batches since last T'giving), still extract/specialty grain to get my 
 chops back, but with the knowlegde from HBD and r.c.b, I'm planning on 
 making the move to all grain starting in the fall . . . 


>Any direction is certainly appreciated, thanks in advance.


One of the best parts about brewing is bringing others into it and 
 along through the processes.

Subject: Re: When is it beer?


After catching up on this discussion, let me just add one more question.


When is wort no longer wort?


When discussing the process in between boiling and bottling, you have the
question of when is it legally beer, but you also have the question, when is 
it
no longer wort? Unless you have an intermediate stage "in fermentation" with a 


name, it presumably stops being wort at about the same time as it becomes 
beer.


I think it is no longer wort after fermentation has begun.  I say this happens
after the "lag time" has finished, though I can see why legal types would opt
for something simpler.


In the meantime, I call it wort until I see signs of fermentation and then I
call it beer.

The issue is often not your fellows so much as your fellows' insurance 
company. If someone gets in an accident leaving any event, the insurance 
company would like to spread the cost out as much as possible, and will 
often initiate a law suit under a state's dram shop laws.


The approach that our club takes is to find a willing local bar with a back 
room that they will let us use. It is good advertising for them, since we 
are obviously people who like beer. The club meetings are then covered (we 
believe) under the massive liability insurance that all bars carry, so that 
we have to worry less about that issue.


I'm not a lawyer, so take that into account when considering the above 
advice.

>I want to take the "homemade" beer taste off my beer. How do I do that?


The four things that I found removed that "homemade" taste were:


1. reducing Hot-Side Aeration (I used to aerate the wort when it was still
hot -- cooling before aerating improved my beer more than anything else),


2. using *fresh* malt extract (old extract gives a similar flavour to HSA
and has been blamed by some for that "extract twang"),


3. switching to good yeast (at the time, the dry yeast I was using was
pretty bad -- when I switched to liquid there was a big improvement...
since then I've often used Nottingham, Windsor, Coopers, Muntona... all
with very good results), and


4. steeping the crystal malts in no more than a gallon of water per pound
(if you steep them in any more than that, you will extract excessive
tannins which will take a long time to mellow out).

Quick question, longer answer.


The protein rest is for breaking big proteins into medium and small proteins
and amino acids.  If you have excessive big proteins you increase your hot
and cold break (and the associated beer losses) and your risk of chill haze.
Medium-sized and small proteins increase head retention and body.  If you
already have well-modified malt (most modern malt is well-modified) you can
break your medium and small proteins down to amino acids -- good for yeast
nutrition, but bad for body and head retention.

     volatiles, purged from the beer by CO2), so they do not usually make

Tracy's right, George.  Kirk, Miller and Noonan are wrong (at least
regarding yeast and respiration).  Look in more bio (not homebrew!)
books till you find "Crabtree Effect."  It is because of the Crabtree
Effect that yeast do not respire.  They do use oxygen for sterol synthesis
which is essential to healthy cell membranes which, in turn, are important
for alcohol tolerance, among other things.

Both, but Fix says that proteins have a bigger effect on body/mouthfeel
than dextrins.  I believe that only proteins increase head retention,
although I would be interested in a reference or experience that
indicates otherwise.  I believe that there are plenty of medium and
small proteins in crystal malt which is why it helps with head retention.

I believe that some would be converted and some would not.  Limit dextrins
are not converted by beta amylase.  I have it on my list of things to do
to find out what percentage of crystal malts' dextrins are limit dextrins.
Flaked adjuncts MUST be mashed.  They contain starch, so you cannot add
them later in the mash as you can with crystal malts.

Unless your setup is set up such that your fermenter can suck back liquid
from the vessel that catches the blowoff (i.e. unless you are using narrow
ID tubing, which is not recommended for MANY reasons) there should be no
risk.  This is a closed system and therefore there is no more risk of
infection with a blowoff system than with an airlock.  Personally, I prefer
to use plain water in airlocks and blowoff buckets, because if I do get
suckback of airlock water, I would rather it be plain water than bleach.

CANADIAN TAX ON BEER & WINE MAKING FOOD ITEMS  The 
government of Quebec announced in its budget Thursday that starting  May 
16, the 6.5-per-cent provincial sales tax will be added to grapes, 
concentrated or nonconcentrated, malt, malt extracts and similar products 
used to make wine or beer. Federal tax will not apply. "They  want  to tax 
food and that's not fair," said beermaker Nicolas Balikci at a supply store. 
He was referring to the sugar, yeast, malt  and other  products lining the 
shelves. "They sometimes sell honey in  this store," said  Mary Schurman, 
another customer. "How do they know  I'm not going to  put it on my 
toast?" Some home brewers even suggested  that extending the provincial 
sales tax to beer and wine-making  ingredients is an attack on ethnic 
communities. The tax will hit people like Garcia  Moutinho, who estimates 
he spends $1,000 on grapes to make about 150  gallons of wine a year. 
"It's bad for  me and for all the guys like me -  Italians, Portuguese, 
Greeks."  Grape-seller Claudio  Porco wondered how the  government  can 
tell the difference between grapes that are eaten and those  that are 
 pressed to 
make wine. (Source: Yvonne Zacharias; The Gazette -  Montreal; May 11, 
Saturday,  News; Pg. A3) A local merchant due to open a microbrewery in 
Quebec soon insists that this is not an ethnic issue. If consumers or home 
brewers want  food items without taxes, they can buy them at the local retail 
stores. The group affected by the tax and therefore most vociferous will be 
the home and wine making suppliers.

     In response to the question about the 5 liter mini kegs, I have

     Since I bottle part of the batch and put the rest in the mini kegs, I 
     use the normal priming rates of 2/3 to 3/4 cup of corn sugar, and the 
     carbonation has come out fine. As for the cost of the CO2 cartriges, 
     if you can get a good seal with your tap (not always gaurenteed on the

Subject: Dogs+ Hops= Malignant Hyperthermia


Dave Hinkle writes about the human equivalent of Hopped up Dogs-
It's called Malignant Hyperthermia, or malignant hyperpyrexia, 1st
identified in the 1960's. A rare, life threatening condition, triggered by
succinylcholine and volatile anaesthesia agents, notably halothane, though
it may also be induced by trauma, emotional stress, and strenuous exercise.
The syndrome begins with a hypermetabolic state in muscle tissue and is
believed to involve altered calcium mechanisms at the cellular level.
Symptoms include generalized contracture of skeletal muscle, tachycardia,
marked temp elevation, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, and dysrythmias. Death
rates of 50 - 80% were common until Dantrolene was introduced as a
treatment. Immediate infusions and total body ice baths are used.
Dantrolene is a VERY expensive drug and has a limited shelf life, and will
not be found in quantities greater than that necessary to treat 1 or 2 cases
at any one time. But it will be found in EVERY operating room in the
developed world and further supplies are air ambulanced in, when necessary.
That's why the anaesthetist asks you about 'any problems with previous
anaesthesia,' that you or any family member may have had. Muscle biopsy may
be required in suspected individuals. As you amy understand, this is a big
concern when surgery must be done on a susceptible individual.

<According to Greg Noonan, "this is another source of controversy-much of the

<brewing literature and empirical observations.


At the first Spirit of Belgium conference, Weihenstephan Diplom Braumeister
Eric Toft presented some general material relating fermentation parameters
to fermentation byproducts.  He was careful to point out these are
generalizations and each brewery/strain must be monitored to see the
cause and effects.   That said he did present this:


Decreasing wort aeration generally results in a vast increase of esters.
Late O2 injection, Drauflassen, generally results in a vast decrease of
esters.  In the former case, higher alcohols are decreased while in the
latter case they are increased.


An increase of pitching rate can either increase or decrease esters and
fusel alcohols.  Open fermenters also tend to increase esters.


<However, for those wishing

Maybe with Scotch ales but I would not make a doppelbock without saturation

Greg wrote:

Now it is all becoming very clear indeed! What Noonan considers "high
pitching rate" is what most professionally trained brewers consider
minimal pitching rate!  The rule of the trade is 1 million cells/degree Plato,
so a 18 P doppelbock would be pitched with 18 million cells/ml.  Not what
I consider high, but normal pitching rate.  This is probably another 
example where words can be misleading when not defined in a more rigorous
fashion.


Good lagering!

Date: Sat, 8 Jun 1996 22:53:38 -0500 (CDT) 
Subject: Re: Wort Chilling
     
I was wondering....   I never use a wort chiller.  I usually put my wort 
directly into the fermentation tank (carboy)  top it up with water, then 
set it in the bath tub.  It usually takes about three hours to cool to 
about 85-95 degrees F.   At this time I rack off the trub, and then pitch 
in my yeast.  This gives me a pretty short lag time.  What risk am I 
actually running.  I've only done it the last 4 or 5 batches with no 
problems.  Any opinions?
     
     That is basically my approach.  I use a galvanized washtub instead of 
     the bathtub because I use ice and it takes a lot of ice to fill the 
     bathtub.  Also, if you can, you might want to try cooling the hot wort 
     first before adding to carboy and water.  Several benefits to this:
     
     You can cool your boiling pot much faster and with less risk of 
     breakage than you can your carboy.  Presumably, you'll get a better 
     break by cooling faster and less HSA by pooring cooler wort rather 
     than hotter wort.  In fact, I cool the wort far enough that I can pour 
     it vigorously (of course I ferment in a plastic bucket) to achieve 
     some degree of aeration prior to pitching without detecting any HSA 
     affect.  I guess the only downside is if your water is not sterile, 
     but then if that's the case, it probably won't get sterile by simply 
     adding hot wort to it.
     
     It takes me about 30 - 45 minutes to cool 3 gal in my kettle to 80F - 
     90F which I add to 60F tap water (added with the sink sprayer to 
     increase aeration) and pitch.  I cool in 2 stages.  First I cool with 
     tap water in the wash tub until it feels hot (about 10 or 15 minutes.  
     Then I remove about a gallon of the water and add 8lbs of ice.  The 
     ice is usually melted a few minutes before cooling is complete, so 
     another bag of ice could be used.  I just don't think it would help 
     that much, because the water is still pretty cold and I'm too cheap to 
     spend the xtra 87 cents for another bag. I swish the water around my 
     kettle by hand to improve heat transfer and monitor water temp.  
     Sometimes I'll move the kettle around in the tub in such a way as to 
     get some stirring action inside of the kettle.  However, I'm always 
     worried about HSA and my back, so I usually don't.  I do keep the lid 
     on the kettle at this time to minimize the chance of contamination, 
     since this is done on the floor. I also put a couple of bricks in the 
     bottom of the tub under the kettle to enhance water flow under the 
     kettle as well as around it.
     
     On another note, I find it is always useful to check a mechanical or 
     bi-metallic thermometer against a known standard before using it.  
     Boiling water, ice water bath, room temperature are all easy to 
     achieve and verify them.  Probably a good idea for liquid thermometers 
     as well, but I've never found them to be innacurate.  This may sound a 
     little anal retentive, but it comes from one who usually forgoes 
     testing SG and still manages to make pretty good brew IMHO.

Now, personally, I don't care for fly in my homebrew. But if you must, I

common black fly will most likely work. If you want to brew with fruitfly, 
use a mildly hopped wheat beer for a base. I would personally add the fly

Subject: Longshot American Pale Ale, misfire ?


I just tasted Sam Adam/Boston Brewing/Jim Koch - Longshot American
Pale Ale.  As has been reported in HBD previously Boston Brewing chose
3 homebrew contest winning beer recipes and are commercially producing
these.  A previous HBD post spoke about their Hazelnut ale.  There are
also a black lager and an american pale ale.


The Amer. Pale Ale is from Jim Simpson(Simson?) recipe and altho it's
a nice drinkable beer it tastes a lot more like Marzen/Octoberfest
brewed with an ale yeast. The Vienna or Munich malt is the dominant
flavor, and the evidence of the four varieties of hops advertised on
the label is minor - the label claims 31 hops units whatever that
means - IBUs ?  There isn't much hop aroma/flavor evident, and the
bitterness is masked by the vienna malts dryness. The color is a
medium brown, a bit lighter than most Octoberfest beers. It is drier
and softer than an Octoberfest.  I'm putting this one in the (colder)
upstairs fridge with the lager beers.


OK - so I'm not a purist, a good beer is a good beer - *BUT* when the
label says 'American Pale Ale' a beer more in line with Sierra Nevada
Pale Ale or Anchor Liberty Ale comes to mind. I expect an IPA minus
the molasses/sugar cane note of a Bass, plus a heavy hit of US varietal
hops aroma and flavor.


Not to pick on Boston Brewing or Jim Simpson, vienna and munich malt
in pale ales is becoming epidemic around here. One local brewery
(Crooked River) uses this malt to excess in all of their ales that I
have tried.  A new local brewpub, with a German brewmaster is also
adding a heavy dose of vienna to his hoppy ale.  I guess I wouldn't
object to vienna as a minor side note in an ales flavor,  but these
don't taste like APAs to me.  Comments ? Am I alone ?  Would a BJCP
judge allow such a beer in the Amer Pale Ale category - Al ?
APA=Austrian Pale Ale maybe ?

Hmmm - well there certainly seems to be a disconnect between gallons
and larger units as far as powers of two go, but US pints are 16
US fl.oz., against a 20 british fluid ounces in a  british pint. 3
taespoons per tablespoon loses its 2-ness as well.  I can't verify all
of your units, but it appears that people have very small mouths in
your part of the world. From a Unix utility source we have gill or
noggin = 4 floz.  The 31.5 US gallons (or sometimes 31 gallon) seems
to apply to brewing/fermenting. The 42 gallon barrel is a petroleum
measure. I suspect that ther are several other barrel definitions.


approaching barrel sizes we get back to factors of 2  ...


firkin                  0.25 barrel
kilderkin               0.5 barrel
barrel (US fermenter's)        31.5 gallon
hogshead                2 barrel
pipe                    4 barrel
tun                     8 barrel


Interestingly a tun of water (2016 pints) should weigh a ton (2000lbs)
at some reasonable temperature.


And clearly there is little reason to take offense when someone asks about
your firkin homebrewery!

Greg's book was written over 10 years ago; he's probably learned a few new
things since then. I discussed this with him just last month; he now sees
things quite a bit differently. I seem to remember that Pierre Rajotte was
also recently quoted saying at a conference that esters are produced during
yeast growth. I think this is worth investigating further.

Greg's brewery experiences relating to this discussion were much more
extensive than just "some poxy IPA". They had so many problems with their
yeast at the VP&B (possibly due to following conventional wisdom?) that they
were finally forced to switch strains. What was the problem? It seems that
the level of esters in their ales was never up to par, unless aerated
continuously throughout the fermentation. So at least in that particular
brewery, with that particular yeast strain, decreased aeration led to
decreased esters, while increased aeration led to increased ester synthesis.
I have no motivation to synthesize this account, these are just the facts as
they were reported to me by Greg Noonan.


Concerning the weight of scientific opinion, are you forgetting the
Copernican Revolution and the fact that it wasn't too long ago when many
regulars reading the HBD thought that yeast respires in wort! Scientific
opinion can (and does) change to accommodate new observations and
interpretations. I'm certainly willing to take some heat on thisa(fter all,
it flies in the face of conventional wisdom), however, I think this is an
intriguing observation and I believe it's definitely worth further
investigation.


>If there is enough interest I can summarise (from the above articles) what

I'm quite interested, if it's not too much trouble for you. I'm particularly
interested in factors which are known to influence yeast esterase activity.

Alpha-acetolactate is produced in the cytoplasm of the yeast cell as a
by-product of valine biosynthesis, and leaks from the cell into the medium
at a strain-dependent rate. Alpha-acetolactate is then oxidized to diacetyl;
this  reaction apparently does NOT require a catalyst (eg. yeast encoded
enzymes) and can be accelerated by dissolved oxygen. Hence, increased
availability of O2, particularly once fermentation has started, can increase
diacetyl levels, and this oxidation reaction occurs outside the cell.
Interestingly, acetohydroxy acids (eg. alpha-acetolactate) can not be
assimilated and reduced by the yeast until they have been oxidized to the
vicinal diketone (eg. diacetyl). The rate at which VDKs are re-absorbed and
reduced by the yeast is also strain-dependent.
(See Malting and Brewing Science (2nd ed.) vol. II, ch. 17 for review).


This brings up another interesting point. Certain yeast strains which have a
very high O2 requirement (eg. Ringwood) produce the highest levels of
diacetyl only when the wort is heavily aerated, often requiring aeration
well into the fermentation. In fact, the Ringwood strain often requires pure
O2 to perform as desired. The extremely buttery ales produced are certainly
unique, however.

Subject: Hydrometer vessel - any differences?


I recently made a honey/wheat lager and I suddenly couldn't find the tube my 
hydrometer came with so I improvised with a salad dressing bottle (classic 
wishbone shaped one).   I filled it to the top and took a reading of .1080 (7 
pounds of malt in 5 gallons + 1 pound of honey).


Would this have given a different reading as compared to the straight tube it 
came in?

For the record I haven't had and problems.  I got this method from the 
bible (it seems) Complete Handbook of Homebrewing -Miller-.  Although it 
many cool their wort in the boiler, which obviously takes less time, it 
would seem to me that you are running the greater risk of infection doing 
it this way.  Your lid on your boiler is not airtight.  I put my boiling 
wort directly into a sealed (airtight) and sterile carboy.  What do you 
think?
