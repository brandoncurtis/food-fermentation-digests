Although I am reluctant to post this for general consumption, at
least one person in the past expressed the view that this sort of
thing is useful and educational for the group as a whole.  Having
been encouraged by this singular opinion, what follows is my just
received water analysis.  This analysis is of my tap water, after it has run
through my under-the-sink carbon filter.  If anyone has comments
about my water for brewing purposes, I would love to hear them.  I am
at the dawn of my knowledge of brewing water chemistry, so all input
is welcome.

Subject: RE: moonshine


In HBD 2074 Greg Tompkins asked about moonshine & a recipe for it. Moonshine
is a distilled spirit, where some malted grain (corn, rye, barley, etc) is
fermented, sometimes with added sugars (cane/beet, honey, etc.), and the
resultant fermented liquid (known as beer - not necessarily the fizzy barley
stuff we speak of)is then heated in a closed system which allows the vapors
to escape and be cooled back to a liquid (called distillation - the unit is
called a "still"). The vapors that escape are alcohol, so the cooled liquid
is somewhat pure alcohol. This is then mixed ("cut") with water to make
moonshine.


For a real thorough reading on the matter, check out the Foxfire books -
probably volume 1 or 2. They not only discuss how it was done, but the
dangers, the illegality, etc. Unlike brewing beer or making wine,
distillation is illegal in the U.S., unless properly licensed such as the
major distillers (Seagrams, etc.).


Moonshine was a term given to the practice of typically making this in the
middle of a "hollow" in the woods at night, by the light of the full moon,
when it was less likely for police or other officials to catch you.

Subject: CO2 / N2 gases


After 2 years of playing with my Guinness system and not getting it right,
(then moving), the (new) local supplier finally set me straight.


Don't expect to take your CO2 tank in and get it filled with CO2/N2 mix.
("beer gas").


They can partially pressurize it with CO2 and N2, but not force it to
condense, if you wish (In which case, it's good for about 2 kegs), but
to fill it full of liquid (note that pure CO2 will form a solid in the
tank, where as beer gas forms a liquid), you need a special tank.


First of all, the tank must (should) be rated at 2000+ psi, not the 1800
psi that regular CO2 tanks are rated at.  Second, it must have what is
referred to as a "dip tube".  i.e., beer gas containers are filled and
dispensed from the bottom, not the top.  You cannot fill a such a cylinder
with pure CO2 - as the CO2 begins to freeze, it will clog the dip tube.


I'm not sure why you cannot (should not?) dispense beer gas from the top.


>From playing around with the pressure, and obsering the results compared
to what you see in a bar, I'm pretty certain that most bars dispense
Guinness in the 15-30 psi range.  If you dispense at 40 psi, the beer comes
out almost as completey white, and it takes a minute just to get to the
rolling/raining effect that you normally see when a Guinness is poured.
Not that it doesn't work - dispensing at 40 psi gives a wounderfully
creamy head - I just don't think that most bars do it.

Subject: Stuck Fermentations


In hbd #2073, in response to a question from Domenick Venezia about stuck
fermentations, Tracy Aquilla said:


>Considering that you may have overpitched this
>batch and the OG is only about 'average', it's also possible that yeast

>in the recipe.


If the batch was overpitched why would it matter that the growth became
FAN-limited?  Wouldn't there be enough yeast to do the job without growth?
Or won't yeast ferment without growing at the same time?
Also, it has been mentioned by some (AL K. and others, I think) that as the
yeast population grows, the growth rate slows.  Is the population density
growth limiting?  If so, wouldn't this have the same effect as low
FAN levels of an overpitched batch?

Subject: iodophor


Robs writes:
     Interesting to note that while working in Operating Rooms, it was
not uncommon for certain surgeons to rinse out an open abdomen with an
Iodophor/saline solution, suction it out and repeat. Particularly in the
presence of abdominal infection, or when spilled bowel contents were
present. One surgeon noted that the patient would be able to taste it for a
few days post-op, but that was a small price to pay for an opportunity to
offset any further infection.


I can't really comment on the taste. But the practice of irrigating an
abdomen with iodophor is no longer done.  It was found that the patient could
easily absorb toxic quanities of iodine. In the studies that were done a
catheter was left in at surgery and continous irrigation was done after the
abdomen was closed, so they did have more than a brief exposure. Other
studies have shown no therapeutic benefit to using iodophor intra
abdominally.  Usually just saline is used or sometimes with an antibiotic.

Most of the "style defining" beers not present on the winners list were
not entered.  I know for a fact that Anchor did not enter, and I don't
remember seeing SNPA either.  As did Rob, I also heard that there will be
a list of the breweries and what they entered on the AOB web page sometime
soon.


Make sure you look at the winners list a little closer also.  For
example, Edelweiss a silver in the weizen category and a gold in the
dunkel weizen category.  Edelweiss is in either Austria or Germany, but
is listed under Pa's Bier, Inc. Long Beach CA -- the importer.  Paulaner
dunkel weizen won the silver in the dunkel weizen category.  Paulaner is
obviously in Germany.  Aventinus won the gold in the weizenbock category,
another German beer.  The winners list is a bit confusing because of the
importers, but my impression was that the imported beers won more medals
based on a per entry status.  (A greater percentage of the imported beers
won medals than the american beers entered, I believe).

Just because Augsburger calls their bock a doppelbock doesn't mean it is
a doppelbock.  Brewers call their beers whatever they want.  Do you
really think Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic was supposed to be a lambic?
Neither did Jim Koch.  It is all marketing.

Not only that, something a brewery calls a porter may well be brewed as a
dark lager.

The judges obviously do not see the names of the beers until the awards
ceremony.  And just as in homebrew competitions, it is not the organizers
job to second guess the category a brewer entered a certain beer in.
When beers that seemed to be entered wrong by name came up they were
double checked against all the paperwork (which was confirmed by the
brewer) to make sure everything was correct (I know the people who
organized the judging, which is how I know this info).

I think most of it is "My doppelbock is really a bock, so I am going to
enter it there, as the doppelbock judges slammed it last year" kind of thing.

Again check the beer/brewery name.  More German and British beers won
than you think.

Seriously, what other reasons are there than marketing to enter such a
competition?  You spend $100 per beer and shipping to enter the WBC.  Do
you think a brewer is going to do this to stroke their ego?  Do you
really think the brewer is not thinking of the good press his brewery
will get by doing well?


I agree that the competition needs the big names to enter to really gain
prestige though.

What

What you are missing is that HSA (hot side aeration) is not just dissolving
O2 in wort. It is the oxygenation of Mellanoids and fatty acids. This
reaction slows exponentially I think below about 70C, it is considered
insignificant below that threshold. The darkening mellanoids form in
unoxygenated wort, but are in a reduced state. This lowers the redox
potential of the final beer, greatly prolonging its shelf life.

The solubility of O2 is about 1.54 x 10E-5 at 100C (boiling)i.e. 2/3 that at
pitching temps, however the one way passage of water vapour (steam)
effectively insulates your wort by excluding air, even in an open boil. A
wind blowing across your kettle may change this, but the scrubbing effect of
steam bubble movement is still very significant.
 And, yes, volatile byproducts of maillard reactions are removed. In fact a
lot of design effort has gone into heating calandria in commercial boilers
to do this because they have a negative effect on aroma.(mainly the
methyl-butanals). I am fabricating a similar calandria/fountain for
direct-fired homebrew kettles. If successful, I'll offer the design free to
some appropriate homebrew manufacturer.

Radler bier is indeed a great thrist quencher.  Since it is literally
"the bicycle riders beer"  is was so designed.  As a cyclist who lived
in Bavaria for 6 years and one who spent many hours  in the gasthaus I
must say that radler bier is made from what the house pils is and an
equal amount of limonade (white lemonade).  I have a cool clear stein

Suppose it is designed to warn pedestrians when the drunk cyclist is

I've been force carbonating beer for about six months ... When I do, my

Subject: Chlorine Filter Addendum


I posted a brief reply an HBD or three ago about charcoal filters for
chlorine removal, where I said they remove chlorine but "not much else".  I
received this E-mail from an on-line brewing buddy -- name withheld to
protect the insolent:

Poultry-feces or not, I thought his own words said it better than I could

What *I* meant as far as "not much else" was in terms of the
"brewing-related" ions, but the filter certainly is designed to otherwise
"clean up" your water as noted above.

Subject: RE:  Strange mash schedule


     Jerry Cunningham writes that he used a 127-164-146-148-150-152-170
     mash schedule, and was wondering what it did.


     In short, the rest at 127 broke down large proteins into smaller ones
     (127 favors protease over peptidase).  The step up to 164 is quite
     unconventional.  Even though you rested there a short time (2-3 min. I
     think), the mash was probably over 150 for a while time during the
     trip to 164, so I would bet that most (if not all) the beta amylase
     was denatured.  You probably denatured a good amount of your alpha
     amylase, also (most homebrew texts recommend mash-out at 165-168F for
     5 min. to denature all enzymes).


     Bringing the mash back down to 146 was almost pointless, because there
     could not have been enough beta amylase left to do anything.  If you
     had some alpha amylase left, some conversion of starch to
     unfermentable dextrins would occur.


     The same holds true for the small steps you took up to 152.  These low
     temps favor beta amylase activity, but there probably wasn't any left!


     My guess would be that you ended up with a very unfermentable wort,
     possibly with a lot of starch left in it (did you do an iodine test to
     check for conversion?).


     The weird smell in your fermenter can be caused by the yeast you're
     using, or by invading microbes munching on the starch that the yeast
     can't metabolize.


     In the future, you can do a mash schedule featuring a dextrin rest
     before the lower temp saccharification by following a decoction
     schedule.  This way, only part of the mash is heated to the high temp
     that denatures the beta amylase.  Dextrins are made, then the thick
     mash is added back and they can be broken down to fermentable sugars
     by beta amylase at ~150F.

Subject: High gravity brewing


Good morning,


Both George DePiro and Jim DiPalma  are correct in their assessements
of the high gravity brewing thread.


The use of the proper yeast, the proper mash temps, and the
fermentation temps will determine the final character of the finished
beer.


Newcastle Brown is a blend which blends a low gravity beer with a
high gravity beer after fermentation.  I think this gives some credence
to the reduction of gravity at the end of primary fermentation.


It is easier to brew a high gravity beer that ferments out to  a 1/3
gravity  then it is with a low gravity beer.  The low gravity beer is quite
apt to have too low a terminal gravity.  Having a higher final gravity
can add to the mouthfeel and the malty character of the beer.  This adds
too George's case for dilution after primary fermentation.


Jim says:
>Conversely, sharp flavors such as hop bitterness and dark roasted
malts are Bad  Things(tm), since they will contribute to the impression
that the beer is thin and watery.


Hops and speciality grains such as dark malt are like salt and pepper.
They have to be in balance with the beer.  Can I use "Bad Things(tm)"
Jim?  I will anyway .  Hops and dark malts in low gravity beers are not
Bad Things.  It is only when they are used in too high a quantity for a
low gravity beer are they unpleasant.


In fact roasted barley when used in low quantities, say an ounce for a
five gallon batch, adds a sweet malty note to the beer.

Subject: Enzymes/Maltiness


Brewsters:


Jim Busch responded to my comments on high gravity beers resulting  sometimes
from too short a saccharification time at high temperatures.


Jim, you and I both agree, I think. I am talking about relative rates of
disappearance. A wort is a dynamic thing. Enzyme accelerated reaction rates, in
fact, cover a broad range of temperatures, generally bell curve type in shape (
at a constant enzyme concentration).  The temperatures we normally associate
with an enzyme is its maximum rate in a temp vs rate plot ( at a constant enzyme
concentration). It is of course active at much lower and higher temperatures.
e.g. The amylases are active in the 130 deg F range, it is just that unless the
starch has been pre-gelatinized, they don't do anything. Likewise at the high
end they are also active, but their concentration and rate constant  are both
substantially reduced over time and therefore their effect is less.


 The issue I was trying to bring out in my discussion was that enzymes degrade
faster at the higher temperatures and therefore we have competing reactions in
the wort - the  decomposition of the enzyme which is temperature dependent and
amylolysis whose rate constant is dependent on the temperature and on the enzyme
concentration.  Ways to counteract this is by 1) increasing the time at the
upper temperatures so the beta amylase( even though its concentration and
efficiency is declining at the upper temperatures) can do its stuff and to 2)
increase the concentration of all enzymes present by using a little stiffer
mash.  Both of these actions will improve the chances of increasing the
concentration of fermentables for a saccharification step carried out at a
higher temperature. I know that the production of sugar interferes with the
amylolytic enzyme's action and, therefore, we have this peculiar phenomenon that
reducing the concentration of the enzyme increases the net rate of reaction over
the complete reaction, but this really only becomes important at the end of the
reaction, which in our high temperature case won't make much difference in the
profile, since the beta Amylase will be substantially reduced.


Paulaner Octoberfest's  "malty" taste is due to caramel type malts used in its
production. For a given recipe, having a higher FG will produce a maltier beer.

Why don't we give the politicians something else to play with, so they will
leave our beer alone!

Harold:
re: your question on Ginjo Beer


The Koji ferment used in the production of Sake is a mixture of an amylase
producing mold called Aspergillus Niger and yeasts. Amylase acting on the 
starch
produces sugar from unmalted grains.  Rice beer has been produced for centuries
using this method. I presume this method is used to produce the starting
material for Sochu, the 30% alc distilled liquor ( reputed by some to be 
derived
from sweet potatoes - but this may be a translation problem) drunk mixed with
hot water. I always presumed it was rice based, but it may use other forms of
starch ,
 e. g.potatoes (like vodka).  The Koreans and Chinese have a similar drink that
on some occasions is darker and sweeter called Soju.


I suppose it is an easy transition to use Koji fement with barley, but in my
many visits to Japan, I never tasted Ginjo Beer.

Tony,


I don't have MJ's World Book of Beers which I think is the one you want, I have
his 1993 orig copyright "Beer Companion" a very good hardbound.


Anyway here's the contents on Ireland


1) Beamish and Crawford pp 176,181
        Dry Stout  - Located in Cork
        B&C is owned by Carling O'Keefe of Canada and now by Foster's


2) Cherry's p112
        Ale brewery (presumably a bitter)
        owned by Guiness
        used to brew Phoenix, now brewed at MacCardle see below


3)Dempsey's p112
        Opened in late 1980's with cask conditioned ale, but closed, bottom
fermented version is brewed by Huber in Monroe, Wis. USA        


4) Guiness p 112, 176-8, 181-2
        Three ale breweries:
                Cherry's of Waterford
                Smithwick's of Kilkenny
                MacCardle of Dundalk
        Dry Stout (of course)
        
5) GH Lett p 111
        15 th century brewery closed in 1956,licenses to Coors in US under
George Killian ale name


6)Macardle  p112
        ale owned by Guiness
        Phoenix Beer


7) Murphy p176, 182
        Dry Stout


8) Perry's  of Rathdowney, County Laois p 112
        closed in 1960's - the last independent ale brewery in Ireland


9) Smithwick's of Kilkenny p112,113
        ale house owned by Guiness, ale can be called Kilkenny, but Smithwick's
is the name of the  principal Irish Ale


SO, it looks like most of the brewing in Ireland is done by Guiness (which I
think you already knew).

Subject: Re: Priming


Bruce Herron mentions problems with uneven carbonation due to uneven mixing
of priming syrup.  So here is my contribution towards improving that
process.


1) Since you want to boil your priming syrup for sanitation anyway, mix it
in while it is still warm--the overall thermal influence should be small.


2) Put the priming syrup in the bottling bucket first, then rack onto it.
Direct the siphon tube along the edge of the bottling bucket to cause the
wort to swirl around in the bottling bucket as it siphons in.


3) Don't bother to stir, as everything should be mixed very well now.

I am having a terrible problem with infections in my yeast starters.
Four packs of Wyeast have bitten the dust and I'm at my wit's end.
Each time I have stepped up sanitation measures, washing and soaking
with chlorine everything that comes in contact with the starter.The
last time I switched to iodine, confident that that would kill this
nasty chlorine-resistant bug that must be living in my kitchen. But
no luck. Within six hours the starter was bubbling and emiting a
sour, cider-like odor, just like the other three did.


Has anyone else had a problem like this? What can I do?

My opinion is that this is highly dependent on the yeast strain. I also
believe pitching rate is significant, although there is some literature to
the contrary. For now, let's just say it's a complex process and broad
generalizations may not mean much.

Doubtful, although I suppose it's possible. As far as I know, the folks
involved in the discussion so far know what esters are.


>I understand that oxygen can (and is necesssary to) oxidize ( directly or

Oxygen isn't really necessary for oxidation; other oxidizers work too (eg.
melanoidins). Since esters don't form spontaneously at any appreciable rate,
enzymes are the key to ester synthesis. However, it has been demonstrated
experimentally that increasing the concentration of the substrate pools
(alcohols and acids) can increase the rate of ester synthesis. So you are
correct, increasing concentrations of acids (and alcohols) can lead to
increased ester levels.


>that aldehydes and ketones are partial oxidation products of alcohols on the

Not necessarily. Ester synthase activity is needed to catalyze the reaction.
If these enzymes aren't present and active, no esters will be formed, even
if the substrate pools are huge.


>Since these products are require oxygen, how could increasing the oxygenation
>reduce the formation of ester and related intemediates? What am I missing?


For one thing, oxygen is not required for oxidation. The current dogma is
that oxygenation inhibits esterification by redirecting substrates through a
different pathway. I'm researching another article now, this time on esters.
I expect it to take me at least a couple of months to complete. Expect more
tidbits as the data flow in.
