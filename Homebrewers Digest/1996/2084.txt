David R. Burley Wrote:
>>SNIP<<
In the absence of clear proof, I basically challenge the idea that in a 5
gallon kettle boiling away for an hour or more, open to the air, that no
oxidation of the wort will occur.
>>Stuff Deleted<<
a rolling boil which constantly exposes all of the volume of
the wort to oxygen at the highest possible temperature, 212F or 100C for a
period of an hour or more. I do not believe that all of the gas above our
kettles is water vapor. Some of it is air. I believe this is real, but this is
only my intuition.
>>UN-SNIP<<


I've always thought the same thing.  My intuition has always been that some
oxidation of the wort does take place during boiling.  As a wine maker I've
always been interested in how sherry is oxidized by slowly baking it in an
"estufa".
 It is interesting to note that it is actually a closed system, yet the sherry
will be
oxidized by the length of the baking process.


I would also be interested in proof of the level of the oxidation of the wort
from the
boil. Is the dreaded HSA nothing more then a momily?


Is this why breweries use closed boilers?


Also; is there conclusive evidence for the temperature at which
aerating the wort is safe so HSA does not occur?  I've seen references
that say that aeration during sparging causes HSA.  So assume that introducing
oxygen
at 170 degrees is not safe, is 165 safe? Is 160?


What is the highest temperature at which you can aerate wort without causing
HSA?


High Temp Hoses
- ----------------------------


There has been a lot of discussion with regards to High temp hoses in the last
while.
I have recently obtained (but not yet used) surgical tubing.  It is pure latex,
can be
boiled to sterilize, and it can be purchased in different wall thicknesses and
interior diameters.  I bought 5/16 id with a wall thickness of 3/16.  It is
quite sturdy.
Can be purchased at most surgical or hospital supply places for
a reasonable amount (approximately $ 1/foot).


Anyone else using them?

Sloppy posting by me actually John, keep the O2 out till much lower
temperatures post boil.


Maillard reactions virtually stop below 70C. However oxidising of the
resulting "mellanoids" takes place well below that temperature. I'm not sure
if the suggested decline of 1/2 rate for each 10C for O2 dissolving in water
is relevant to oxidation of organic compunds. Does anybody have references?


But Al Korzonas correctly pointed out that the *low temperature rate of
reaction* and *short length of oxygen exposure* rule out significant
oxidation during fermentation aeration.


HSA oxidation of polyphenols is not a problem *preboil*, because they
complex out with proteins. It actually helps remove them. Post boil it
promotes haze, staling and some astringency. (depending on what polyphenol)
Polyphenols oxidise easily to form tannins (tannoids) which complex with
protein to form haze.


The role of O2 in beer is *very complex*. Basically the cons outweigh the
pros at all points except pitching. It is used up at that stage very
quickly.  Narziss, the German brew scientist recomends even de-oxygenated
mash and sparge  water! That would involve boiling it and keeping the cooled
water under CO2.


Enzymic oxidation of fatty acids by lipoxygenase is a problem at *low
temperatures* in mashes esp with lightly kilned lager malts, but is not such
a problem over 65C when it is denatured in solution. I've been doing some
flavour research and lipoxygenase is active in changing aroma and flavour
compounds after harvesting in many fruits, herbs and cereals, including
hops. This strange enzyme (actually enzymes) is catalysised by iron and
inhibited by low pH. It is in the mash where it forms the water soluble
hydroperoxide derivatives of the fatty acids (esp linoleic). Oxygen oxidises
these into heat stable precursors of the staling aldehyde "trans-2-nonenal".
Because hydroperoxide derivatives of fatty acids are destroyed in the boil,
HSA is more of a *mash* problem for lipid>staling aldehyde production.
Mashout is important in denaturing the lipoxygenase, and air should be
excluded from the lauter.


I am building an experiment with a University professor to test the complete
removal of O2 from kegs of beer with his new gas membrane technology. By
complete we mean < 0.01 ppm! We would be finished months ago, but the
"basic" research of variables for our experimental model turned out to be a
bloody mammoth task! HSA reared its ugly head very quickly.(I would
appreciate any references from organic chemists/brew scientists that would
shorten the investigation.)


In fact, current research suggests HSA in the *mash* and bottling air pickup
as the two main O2-mediated flavour degradations of beer. With higher kilned
malts, de-oxygenated mash water, O2 scavenging bottle caps, the new hot CO2
jetted bottling lines, and my professor's new O2 removal technology  applied
to bright beer tanks, I think very long term beer flavour and aroma
stability can be achieved. Wine buffs look out!


I will report next year!

Actually a 15 minute rest at 70C (=158F) in a pCA=4 (calcium rich)
solution has been used as a method of isolating alpha-amylase (AA).
In other words it is used specifically to destroy beta-amylase!  The
specific acivity of the AA and BA do not decrease with temperature,
even at high temperature.  Only the denaturing, primarily of the BA
but to some  extent of AA is an issue at 70C.  There are some enzymes
that experience a REVERSIBLE deactivation at temperature, some of the
lipases for example. These few enzymes do have a decrease in activity
at higher temps.  Amylase enzymes do NOT experience this phenomenon.

I'm not sure if my previous post got dumped by the HBD gods or what
but to re-iterate.


A BA only mash would produces a lot of maltose (~73% of carbs) and a
lot of beta-limit starches (~22% of carbs).  Alpha-amylase is thus
necessary to break down the beta-limit starchs. (results from 'Enzymes
in Food Science' edited by Gerald Reed, Academic Press 1975.).


An AA only mash produces a wide spectrum of poly-saccharides.  The
precise spectrum of poly-saccharides is dependent on the source of the
AA (Yes, all AA is NOT the same!).  Wheat AA differes from Barley AA
results, tho' they are similar.  Bacterial source AA is different yet,
as is mammalian AA!   The point is that AA eliminates high molecular
weight almost completely, but contrary to popular belief is doesn't
produce a wort full of glucose in any reasonable amount of time, if
ever. Generally speaking the AA produces < 20% fermentable sugars
(from M&B Sci) and only 5% G1 (mono-saccharides), 12% G2
(di-saccharides), 20% G3 (not all fermantable), 10% G4, 15% G5, 30%
G6, 5% G7, which accounts for virtually all of the carbs!!  These
figures were taken after a 180 minute AA only rest of an amylose
substrate from (Robyt and French, 1963, Recent Advan. Food Sci.).  The
point is that AA is selective about which 1-4 bonds is breaks.  The
well substantiated fact that AA won't cleave linkages in
polysaccharides with fewer than 3 1-4 linked glucose units doesn't
mean that it's equally likely to cleave a link in a G5 as in a G500.
It is not.


Your 158F(70C) mash is a pretty close approximation of an
alpha-amylase AA only mash after the first few minutes.  You can mash
it till the cows come home, but you'll still get a very dextrinous
wort and a correspondingly high FG.  The other point in my previous
post is that there is relatively little AA as compared to BA in any
malt, tho' pale ale malts are likely to be weaker in AA.  Plan on
spending 2X to 3X as long mashing at 70C as you would at 60C to break
the same number of links.  The temp increases activity 2X, but you'll
lose 80% to 85% of your total amylase, and BA lost is a bit active
that AA per unit weight.


>range 144-158F except this is the range found in Malting and Brewing
>science - a British book about using well modified British malts that
>have the enzyme system


Whoa - this is dead wrong. M&B Sci is decidedly NOT just about using
english malts.


M&B Sci is by British authors, and includes some chapters primarily on
commercial practice that are IMO Anglocentrically slanted.  You are
likely to see more details on English commercial malt kilns, but never
to the exclusion of info on continental practice. The theory and
experimental results chapters are quite general and many of the
experimental data tables call out results from German lagers and
American lagers as well. Many if not most of the experimental results
presented reference papers originating in continental europe and NA.
The practical differences in beer production in many different
geographical regions are mentioned including some emdedded references
to beer in the far east and in the carribean!

True - and some of those beers will be uniquely bad if you don't
account for the known facts about enzymes and mashing and use them. I
agree that breaking the tyranny of historical methods can produce
useful and improved results.  But 144-158 isn't just a Britishism,
it's well accepted the world around for some good reasons.  To
successfully break out of this limit YOU have to demonstrate an
improvement, and hopefully explain what you are doing and why it
works. You need a goal other than just being different - perhaps I
scanned over it - but what are you trying to achieve w/ a high temp
mash ?

Agreed.  I like the bit on diabetic tests.  Do you know if the same
reactions are used to assay blood sugar level in the electronic test
strip readers ?

Any oxidation during boil *is* HSA. However during a vigorous 25 litre boil
for 60 minutes about 2.5 litres of wort is lost. This is ~40,000 litres of
steam. (water vapour) If your kettle is ~350mm in diameter, steam is leaving
your kettle surface at 115mm/sec or about 4.5 inches/sec. This is a "steam
wind" protecting the surface of your wort. You would need a healthy cross
draught to get air in contact with the surface of your wort?

 Stetson asks about reducing over - carbonation in the bottle.  I had a
similar problem when I overprimed (in  a bottling bucket) a lager which I
forgot that I had taken I gallon out to trial a fruit lager.


Using advice on the HBD, I placed the bottles in the freezer for between 1
and 2 hours to chill and absorb more CO2.  I then took them to the sink and
eased off the edge of the crown caps without removing them completely.  Out
spurted a lot of foam.  I waited until it was finished and then recapped
using the same cap.


I have not had a problem with infection since,


You should trial a couple of bottles with letting out different amounts of
foam as I had some which ended up pretty flat, but still drinkable.  They
were also a bit of a lower risk of glass grenades, or fountains on the best
lounge carpet (each a risk to life and limb).  A bit of trial and error on
a few bottles should be sufficient to get a reasonable pressure on the
rest.


I wouldnt throw it away, but dont leave it too long.  I over primed and
blew up several flagons (thicker than modern champagne botles) of home made
ginger beer as a kid, missing my mum by about 2 minutes.   Very messy, but
flying glass shards are also very dangerous as any one with the misfortune
to be in  the vicinity of a car bomb will know.

I only got B's in OChem, but I believe these are known as
*reducing* sugars, explaining your confusion.  Also note
that the ends of starches are reducing (each amylase
"bite" creates one new reducing end) so the starches themselves
should react with the test, regardless of length (of course

(neuroscience) there is no textbook that is anything like up to date or
complete.  Original research articles and reviews are the only way
to get the state of knowledge.  MABS, being a textbook and being,
what is it, 20+ years old, can't be very state of the art.  Just think
how much basic biochemistry has been learned since then, not to mention
brewing science.  Unfortunately, like most of you, I don't have ready
access to real brewing journals, so keep those summaries coming!

I just got wind that Chancellor Group just announced a stock dividend for
July 31.  SGA Goldstar has sent out a "buy" recommendation.  I understand
other investment advisors are looking to recommend CHAG. The company has a
strong book value.  The short sellers need to cover.  This looks like a
good situation to me.  What do you think?  They are located at:

Subject: Quickie Mead Recipe


Thought I would post my favorite summertime mead recipe (ready in about 3
weeks!)


Peel one large grapefruit (set fruit part aside)
Grate 1 oz of ginger


Boil peel and ginger in 2 gallons water for about 15 minutes.  Turn off heat,
skim out most of the solids.


Add 8 lbs honey (go ahead and boil it if you must, but I don't)


cool, top with cold water to equal 5 1/2 or so gallons


Cut up grapefruit and dump in.  Note: You can use a carboy if you want, but I
recommend a PLASTIC fermenter for the primary.  It's easier to clean,
scratches and all.


Add a scant palmful of yeast nutrient and one package of Edme yeast.  Don't
try to get fancy.  I maintain about a dozen yeasts on slant, including mead
yeasts, but for this recipe, use one package of Edme dry yeast. (Yeah, I
usually rehydrate it)


Ferment about two weeks in primary to let the yeast break down the citrus
globules.  Try to keep below 75 F.  Rack to secondary.  Start siphon by
sucking hose.  Let clear for one week.  Rack to keg, carbonate to about 15
psi.  If botting, use a bit more suger (or honey) than you usually use for
beer.


I am pretty sure that it will continue to improve if aged, but I have never
had 5 gallons last more than 2 months past brew day.  This stuff is great on
a hot summer day!

I agree with this whole-heartedly, and my previous post was worded poorly.


I pointed to Alan Moen's article, not as a reference to suggest that one

distillation should be legalized.  Distillation can be an extension of
brewing and, with modern technology and information, can be safe and
enjoyable.  There is a long history of distillation in America, especially
the South.


While I have no desire to begin distillation should it become legal, I support
any efforts for its legalization.

In HBD #2077 or #2078, Paul Sovcik suggest the use of Sodium Thiosulfate
to remove chlorine from brewing water.


I would like to see more homework done before anyone follows Paul's
suggestion. I agree that Thiosulfate neutralizes chlorine, but to make the
leap from its use in aquarium keeping to its appropriateness in brewing
water leaves me troubled. Just because Sodium Thiosulfate is used in
medical applications it doesn't mean that it is safe for food use. When
there are safe and effective (and inexpensive) alternatives for the removal
of chlorine from brewing water, why take the chance on a method that hasn't
been shown to be safe? If there are any readers out there that may know
more about the potential toxicity of this suggestion, perhaps you can add
to the discussion. In the meantime Paul, I hope you are labeling your
product to reflect this added ingredient so that your consumers know what
they're getting.

Just to clarify, I suggested using water simply so that if there
was suck-back, it would be water and not bleach solution.  The
chlorophenols would be created upon reaction between the bleach and
the beer.  Darrell's post implied I said that chlorophenols were
actually being sucked into the fermenter.

Regarding "Sheila in the gutter," after my three week trip motoring

oncoming traffic!

Ken asks about sacks and bales.


It's not really 55 pounds -- it's 25 kilos and that's only for European
grains.  US grains are sold in 50 pounds sacks.  One exception is
DeWolf-Cosysns malts, which are Belgian, but also sold in 50-pound
sacks.  It's because they come to the US in containers and then are
bagged by Schreier Malting.  A bale of hops is very close to 200 pounds.

For the record, I didn't question the statement that thicker mashes
favoured enzyme stability (actually, I supported it), but rather, I
said I had never read about stiffer mashes resulting in faster conversion
and asked for a reference for that.

Sorry... that's pure speculation and if it were true, we would not be able

Again, I disagree.  Too short a time at 158F and you have remaining starch.
I contend that the beta amylase denatures much faster than you suggest and
this is why we are able to control fermentability (i.e. FG) via mash
temperature.

It's the time below 153F or so that determines the fermentability (i.e.
FG, aka dextrin/maltose ratio) and not the time at 158F.

Sounds just like Chicago water (and probably is, since we both get it from
Lake Michigan).  Despite the 7.8pH out of the tap, that's virtually no
indication of what your mash pH will be.  For making American Pale Ales, I
would stick with lactic acid, but ONLY if you need it.  Try mashing in
at no more than 1.5 quarts per pound and I'll bet that your pH will be
in the 5.1 - 5.5 range.  When you start taking runnings, monitor the pH
and if it starts to get above 5.8, shut off the sparge and runnings.
Add lactic acid a drop at a time to your remaining sparge water till it's
about 5.5 pH.  Then restart the runnnings and sparge.  You may have to
recirculate a little because the initial runnings when you restart may
be cloudy.  I've made all pale malt beers with Chicago water and no
water treatment and the pH never went above 5.8.

That wasn't restarting fermentation.  The CO2 in the headspace warmed up
from 68 to 75F and expanded, which is what restarted your airlock.  I don't
use DME for priming, but for a Weizen I would use about 1 cup of corn sugar.

Subject: Yeast Washing


I have been recycling my yeast by saving wort from the bottom of a
carboy that has just completed fermentation.  I store the wort/yeast
in a quart mason jar.
This wort contains a mix of trub and yeast.  After about 24 hours the
liquid in the jar separates leaving an inch or two of white slurry on
the bottom of the jar.  I have never been sure as to were most of the
yeast cells are residing, so when I repitch the yeast, I pour off
some liquid and shake the rest to create a pourable slurry.
I have heard about yeast washing and would appreciate any advice as
to how to save the yeast and discard the trub.

Subject: Grapefruit in my beer


I recently got back the tasting notes from a competition I entered and for
an IPA one of the judges noted a slight 'grapefruit' flavor which, he said,
was appropriate (this beer scored fairly high and took second place, so I'm
not complaining). Frankly, I hadn't noticed it. But in my most recent batch,
where I used the same grain bill and yeast (Wyeast 1098) but substituted
milder Challenger hops (for about half the IBUs of the IPA, which used
Columbus) and dry-hopped with East Kent Goldings, the grapefruit notes are
more noticable. In fact, they are fairly prominent. This is a good beer -
very complex with good malt flavor and hop nose - but there's no mistaking
that grapefruit. Where the heck does that come from? The yeast? Hops?
Temperature?

Yup.  I've considered using them (the cooling element itself, not the whole
cooler) in the Fermentation Chiller (see web page below).  For a company like
Coleman or whoever to buy them cheap is no problem; for you or me, they're
about $20 - $30 for starters -- you'll need about a 25W unit minimum, if you
have a decent insulated box and can be patient about lowering your
temperature in warm ambient weather.  But another drawback, even if you're
using the ready-made cooler, is that you must SUPPLY more energy than you are
WITHDRAWING (cooling); this means that your 12 volt supply must be capable of
supplying several amps (like 5 to 10 or more for these icechests).  That gets
to be an expensive power supply.  Your car can deliver this from the
alternator or the battery (though maybe not from the battery for long!), but
a homemade line-powered supply would probably be bulky and expensive.
 Surplus power supplies are an option.  You must supply a lot more power when
cooling as opposed to "maintaining" a temperature; that must be taken into
account.  If you can wait two days to chill your 80F wort to 45F, that's one
thing.  If not, you'll have to crank up the electrons.  Finally, do these
icechests have air circulating fans?  I suppose they do but it'd be worth
checking.


That said, I suppose someone is using one right now to make ice beer, powered
by a hearing aid battery and making me look stupid.  Cut it out!

I think you're on the right track; for such a high bicarb, your calcium
(required to acidify the mash) is probably a bit too low to offset it.  I did
a brew last weekend using a soft water I "made" with about 25 ppm Ca and less
than 50 ppm alkalinity; it only dropped to ~5.5 (pale malt, light crystal, a
touch of biscuit and wheat).  Incidentally, my efficiency was much lower than
my usual ~80%, though a few other things happened which might have
contributed.  Dark grains are naturally acidic and tend to result in lower
pH's.  I'm leaning toward a Rule o' Thumb that one needs a good 30 ppm Ca to
get to the 5.2 - 5.4 pH range if the alkalinity is relatively low (~50 ppm or
less); more for higher alkalinities.


You could tolerate a gypsum infusion in the mash or strike water to boost
your sulphate for APA's without too much harsh side effect; to get your Ca to
35 ppm you'll need about 1/8 tsp (~1/4 gram) per gallon; this puts your
sulphate aroun 60 ppm.


Sparge water cannot be appreciably acidified with gypsum!  Because gypsum is
often used to help acidify a mash, the misconception is that it is an acid.
 It's the *calcium* in gypsum that *reacts with the mash* to lower the pH.
 Calcium Chloride is another salt that can be used to acidify a mash without
the sulphate boost.  Calcium Carbonate (chalk) has calcium but also has
carbonate (an alkali); the carbonate "wins" and the pH will rise.


Acidify your sparge water with lactic or phosphoric.  I use 10% phosphoric at
the ballpark rate of ~ 5 - 10 ml per 5 gal, depending on the water makeup.
 Use pH papers or a meter to monitor your pH drop since it's easy to overdo
it; add no more than about 1 ml (~1/4 tsp I think) at a time.  Mix, measure,
lather, rinse, repeat.

Subject: Pint Glasses/Beer Labels/55lb Sacks/Old Wyeast


A note on the "not quite full" pine glass discussion: There was an
article I read somewhere (mainstream press I beleive) a few years ago
about a brewpub in Colorado who got burned by Weights and Measures for
pouring 14 oz "pints." It turned out their glasses (Libby?) were not the
16oz they thought. They ended up renaming their beers "small, medium and
large." I don't think it is written anywhere that you have to serve beer
in 16oz glasses, but if they call it a pint, it had better be 16oz or
they are shorting the customer -- just like the butcher who sells short
weight meat.


There was an article in the LA Times this morning about a state Senator
who was pushing a bill (backed by the industrial brewers) that would do
away with our law that says anything over 4% cannot be called "beer." A
Morman Assemblyman was blocking it saying it would encourage underage
drinking (???) and that now kids bought "beer" instead of the stronger
"ale", "stout" and "malt liquour" because of the label. "Who wants to go
to an ale bust" he said. Well, I would :)


Ken Koupal askes why grain comes in 55lb sacks instead of 50lb sacks.
Well, some grain does come in 50lb sacks, but the 55lb sacks are really
25kg sacks and those of us who are metrically challanged use the US
approximation.


A while back someone asked about how long a Wyeast package lasted. I
found a yeast dated 12/01/93 that had been sitting at room temperature
since this past February. I smacked it, it swelled up in about 4 days.
The starter smells OK and I will pitch the yeast in a brew on Thursday.
