I just finished building a RIMS setup using a 40 qt cooler and PVC
manifold. While all the bells and whistles arent attached yet, the
equipment seems to operate fine, but I have no experience with procedure
and operation.
My question is: during a protein rest at around 120 deg, should I run
the pump and circulate or just let it sit and "rest"?
Any help on RIMS operation would be appreciated.

Subject: Re: hop drying, new hop question


Several people have panned the idea of using a clothes dryer to dry fresh
hops. While I agree that the tumbling action would be harmful, what about
those dryers that include a special shelf used for drying shoes. The
inserted shelf holds the shoes in the middle of the dryer without tumbling.


Now a new question about hop use. How does the use of hop socks affect
utilization (I usually use hop plugs)?


Although I have no references, I've suspected keeping the hops bunched
together in the sock instead of allowing them to spread throughout the
boiling wort cuts utilization. The problem with free floating hops is the
difficulty of removing the spent hops from the wort during cooling. Out of
fear of the dreaded HSA, I've just let the hops stay in the boil. This
seems to me to be counterproductive with aroma hops added at the end of the
boil. Does leaving the hops in the wort while cooling (with an immersion
chiller) continue to drive off the aroma qualities as with hops used in the
full boil?

I just got back from Seattle about a month.  Go down to the Pikes Place
Market, and there is a great shop there.  Called Liberty Malt Supply
Company, they have a microbrewery there on premises, and a decent
representation of beer making supplies. The other interesting thing that
they have going for them is a cold supply of microbrews from all over.  I
really recommend them, the sales staff is extremely knowledgable and
forthright with info.


However, if they don't have what you're looking for, I can probably find it
from my sources down here in sunny Southern Califonia, where we have a shop
that has everything you can think of for making not only homemade beers, but
wines, cheeses, soda pop, and even vinegar!

Subject: Recycled bottles


Brewsters:


Ron asks if it is ok to use recycled bottles rather than paying an exhorbitant
amount for *empty* bottles.
I have also asked myself why are these so expensive when they can ship bottles
from overseas with beer in them for hardly any more money.  Why such a ripoff?
I used to go dump picking for wine bottles, but now even that isn't possible,
since they break them up.  I'm sure the fact that they mix plastic and glass
together( at least in NJ) means they aren't recycling anything.  It is just for
show.


Sure, I have "returnable" quart bottles with crown cap tops that I have been
re-using for more than twenty or more years ( they aren't available any more to


my knowledge). The more you use them, the better they get, if you rinse them 
out
immediately after you pour your beer.


Personally,I would redo your sterilization, since you may be in for trouble 
from
the soap residue in the bottles, which could negatively affect the head on your
beer. There is no need for the antibacterial soap , bleach is MUCH stronger and
doesn't leave a residue.  I would re-rinse them in strong  bleach solution ( a
tablespoon in a little over a half bottle of warm water and rinse them three
times with near boiling water, just before you bottle. Wear safety glasses and
rubber gloves.  Don't get burned, use a funnel to pour the water into the
bottles and use something to protect your fingers from the hot glass.

It would seem to me that the best way to dry hops would be to use a food
dehydrator.  I'm currently raising a couple varieties of hops (Cascade and
Fuggles) and if I get any kind of crop this year intended to pop the cones
into the dehydrator that I use for drying herbs and veggies.  The dehydrator
has a temperature control and fan for even heat distribution.  Anyone see any
reason that this wouldn't work?

Subject: All grain  "mashing time"


Hello All:


        I am a new all grain brewer ( just made my third batch). My questions are on
mashing time and the iodine test.


        The last two times I brewed the iodine never turned black. I am using Iodines
Tincture (Decolorized Iodine):


                Question 1 -         Should I be using colorized or something else???


        I have read that the longer you hold the temperature during the mash the lower
the FG will be.


                Question 2 -        Is this True???


        I recently made a doppelbock with an OG of 1.100.


                Question 3-        should I refrigerate the beer just until fermentation
stops or for the full 9 months (the recommended time), and when I bottle should
the
bottles be kept at a certain temperature.


        As you can see I have a lot of novice questions, but I am willing to learn.
Thanks for your help.

good

Subject: force carbonation w/ SS airstone


I have a SS airstone (nominal porosity: 2 microns) that I use with an
aquarium pump to inject air into my wort. I'm contemplating using the
same stone to speed up the carbonation of my kegged beer. I've been able
to glean bits of info from those that have written about this technique
so here goes:


1. Connect the airstone to the short CO2 "in" downtube inside my keg
using 1/4 hose - long enough for the stone to reach the bottom of the
keg.


2. Hook up the CO2 and apply the appropriate pressure for the temp. of
beer (according to The Chart).


Do I open the release valve on the lid during this process? (My
intuition tells me "foam!").  If the release valve stays closed, won't
the CO2 injection be over in a matter of minutes? In either case, how
long do I keep the CO2 hooked up for full carbonation?  After it's over,
do I have to stick my grubby hands in the keg to remove the airstone or
can I keep the thing hooked up during dispensing?


For those of you wondering why I don't just hook up the CO2 and shake
the keg as many recommend...it's because of an unknown phobia and
completely irrational fear of shaking my beer. I can't explain it!

Answer: Sure, you can use Kayro syrup. Customers have asked me for many years
if they could.......because they figured they could be cheap and avoid buying

that it has a vanilla flavor. Vanilla is fine in ice cream....but do you want

I'm not sure what time period you happen to live in or planet you happen
to live on (Venus?),but lucky for us, you're wrong about CO2 in the here
and now.  The last time CO2 approached anything near such
a significant portion of the earth's atmosphere was about 2.5 billion years
ago, before O2-producing and CO2-consuming photosynthetic organisms evolved.
N2 and O2 are the two most prevalent gases in the atmosphere today, accounting
for about 76% and 21% of the atmosphere, respectively. Water vapor varies
from about 1-4% (it's not the heat, it's the stupidity), while CO2
currently makes up a measly 0.03% (and apparently rising).  Sorry for the
lesson in atmospheric composition, but it seems at least obliquely relevant
to homebrewing.

Get a pack of cigarettes (cigars & pipe tobacco are too nice to waste)
and dump into a quart of water.  Soak until the water is a dark brown.
Remove the cigarettes and spray the brown water on your plants.  This
will kill most bugs until it rains, after which it will wash off.
  This is concentrated nicotine.  Don't get it on any open wound,
don't ingest it, don't inhale it &c.  It is DEADLY.  But it washes
right off, so it's safe.
  Anyone know how much tobacco would be poisonous in 5 gallons of
water?  I'd like to make a vaguely tobacco flavored beer, but I don't
want it enough to die for it...  I remain

Subject: oxygenation of wort 


I remember some discussion of oxygenating wort prior to fermentation using
pure oxygen in the Digest some time back and had a question.  I have a
Bernzomatic MAPP gas/Oxygen torch that uses cannisters of oxygen and was
considering using this for this purpose.  Two questions:


1.)  Is this a safe source of oxygen?  Is there anything in these cannisters
that would be bad, like any sort of oil or other impurities?
2.)  Has anyone else tried this and were the results acceptable?


I have been using the aquarium air pump method up until now but have had some
concerns about the possibilties of getting some strange wayward wild yeasties
in my wort.  I haven't had any problems as yet, but figured since I basically
have the setup to use the oxygen I might give it a try.  Any comments would
be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Hydrometer Use and Temp


First let me thank EVERYONE who responded to my very first post here a few
days ago!  Being very new to brewing it is GREAT to know that I can find
support when I need it.  Hopefully, I will one day be knowledgeable enough
to help out someone myself!  For now, I have yet another question.


After reading some posts I decided to buy a hydrometer.  I now have one, but
the instructions are limited and just for wine, not beer.  It appears that I
know my wert is "done" when the reading changes on the hydrometer.  Question
is, how much change am I looking for?  Is there such a thing as too much
change?  I started with a small Mr. Beer package and they mentioned nothing
about a hydrometer.  Now that Ive graduated to a five gallon container I
find the brewing to be somewhat more difficult.


Finally, being from the Southwest it gets very hot here.  My bottles bake in
95 degree air all day and then drop down to 80 when I get in from work and
kick the air on.  I am diligent, however, in keeping them out of light.  So
my question is, in the summertime, should I just prime the bottles in the
fridge around 65 degrees or would that not work?


Thanks again for the help!

A question on Belgian ale strains.
I want to make a Chimay copy, so want to use the Chimay yeast. 1214 is
supposedly the one, but usually gives a huge (unpleasant) banana ester. For
those who have cultured the yeast out of Chimay bottles, have you
encountered this characteristic from real Chimay yeast too? If not, then
this means 1214 is not really the real thing, no?

Andrew Kligerman asks about Coopers stout...
>Come on you Aussies--you must have tried some %^!  .


Us? Nope, never! We just drink XXXX, VB and Fosters over here.
(Well, maybe I've had it just once or twice).
I honestly have never tried to make this beer. Why should I when I can buy
it anywhere? I have looked up my books for specs, but could not find
anything concrete, so I'll just have to have a stab at it.


It is basically a foreign style stout: quite bitter (maybe 45 IBU),
alcoholic (6.8%), coffeeish and oily. I believe Coopers use dextrose in all
their beers, including this one. My Roger Protz (a Pom) book says they use
lager malt, crystal and roast barley. I would have guessed a little
chocolate as well. Pride of Ringwood hops are certainly used.


So here goes nothing!

You get the idea. Maybe a little more chocolate, hops and roast?


Culture yeast from a bottle of either Coopers sparkling ale or Coopers
stout. If that doesn't work or you can't find any, Yeastlabs Australian ale
yeast is the Coopers one. If you can't find yeastlabs, Wyeast London is a
pretty good general purpose ale yeast. Do *not* use the packet Coopers yeast
as it is actually the Maori Foods ale yeast in disguise. Drinking beer made
from this yeast will render the punter incapable of pronouncing the vowel 'i'.

Subject: dried yeast, extract, aeration, esters, sugar syrups, 2112


Fellow followers of the HBD:


I'd first like to ask about people's experience using Wyeast 2112,
California lager, especially fermenting at 17-18'C.  Anyone?  Is that
pushing it too far on the warm side?


I thought some of you might be interested in my experience last month
brewing fifty batches of beer, fifty litres (13 US gallons) apiece.  This
was at a BOP  (Brew On Premise).


The objective in most cases was to produce a product resembling mainstream
beers in two weeks.  Unhopped malt extract syrups were the starting point on
the barley end of the wort.  The recipes in use called for large amounts of
powdered dextrose or a sugar syrup.  One of the refined sugars is a mixture
of mono-, di-, tri and higher saccharides, and is IMHO, an excellent
adjunct.  It is distributed in BC by a company called Sandoz under the name
Clear Brew.  Also check out Hidex, though I haven't used it myself.


Just as it is possible to make beer from extract, and with dried yeast, it
is also quite possible to use sugar adjuncts.  I'd say it's recommended for
imitating mainstream beers.  At this BOP, the customers were pleased with
products that broke all three of these purist taboos.  And these were
customers are not indiscriminate.


I adjusted the recipes to ensure a minimum of 50% malt extract and added a
yeast derived nutrient called Fermaid by Lalvin/Lallemand at the rate of
10g/50L to compensate for the refined sugars.  I rehydrated the dried yeast
(Nottingham, also Lalvin, and the one Kinney Baughman reported using at his
esteemed establishment) for fifteen minutes in room temperature sterile
water.  This is what is practicable; the manufacturer's rehydration
instructions are re-posted below.


Note in the rehydration instructions below the reference to (this) yeasts
max temp. differential tolerance -- 10'C, as someone else posted earlier.


I also aerated by injecting pure 02.  So here's the aeration/ester thread,
reports on the behaviour of this particular yeast, fed as I've described.  I
get a consistent (50/50 batches) apricot ester flavour (aroma included) in a
product which the customers have found to be highly satisfying.  The weird
candy sweetness that I find in most BOP beers has been eliminated.  The
beers that turn out on the sweet side get there by being underhopped, not
due to the adjuncts.


I've changed the procedures at this brewery in several ways so it's hard to
isolate cause and effect,  but I believe the pure O2 is key to the ester
formation in this situation.  It was not present in other beers using this
yeast.

- -=-=-=-=-
P.S.


Lallemand / Lalvin sheet on their Nottingham English ale yeast give the
following instructions for rehydration.  Recommended pitching rate works out
to 10g / 20 litres.


"Mix the yeast with ten (10) times its weight of clean chemical-free water
at 37/42' Celsius (98/102'F), leave undisturbed for fifteen (15) minutes,
stir and mix with wort.  Do not rehydrate in wort.   [... our yeast has
sufficient nutrients for this phase...]


"Beer yeast cells tend to be vulnerable to mutation (petit colony for
nation) because of temperature shock.  A temperature difference of 10'C can
shock the yeast and induce mutations that could affect the flavour of the
beer.  Thus the rehydrated yeast chould be atemperated, by mixing the wort,
so that the temperature between the yeast slurry and the main wort is less
than 10'C.   For an ale wort pitched at about 20'C this would involve a
50/50 dilution with wort after the 15 minute rehydration rest.  This rest at
30'C chould last for between 5 and 10 minutes.  After, the yeast may be
pitched directly into the body of the wort.  Should the pitching temperature
be 10'C (for a lager or cold fermented ale) then one more intermediate
temperature rest stage would be necessary.  Do not allow the yeast slurry
rehydrated at 40'C to atemperate naturally.  This would take to long and
would result in many of the cells dying."

Subject: Re:  Bottles for Beer


Dear Ron:


        When it comes to beer bottles, there's only one place to go in my
book.....  Go to the nearest beer retailer and get 16 ounce returnable
bottles.  They are typically $1.50 - $2.00 for a case of 24.  Keep in
mind the following things:






1)        They are NOT clean and can (and do) have everything from mold to
cigarrette butts in them and must be washed thouroughly before use...






2)        Get the same kind every time...  Initially, you can mix and match, but
later on when you have to start mixing bottles, they may or may not fit
in each other's cases.  This is the situation I am in now.  I've decided
to "standardize" to Busch / Bud light bottles.  These have the TAPERED
NECK and do not "glug" as much when you pour them!!!  Long necks tend to
"glug" alot and stir up the yeast.  I've also had some trouble with long
necks bursting - I dont know why, but I haven't had ANY tapered necked
bottles burst yet.  NOTE:  I am having this trouble with home soda
only....






3)        They must be returnable.  No threads on the lip or they won't seal.






4)        Watch out for foreign brands, they may have metric sized necks.  They
look the same size, but they are not and can't be capped.






5)        That's all I can think of for now......






Have a nice day and keep brewing........  Broaden your horizons and try
wines / sodas!

My second batch boiled over two days ago, and now I have carbonized wort
stuck to my wife's enameled white stove. How can I get this stuff off
without ruining the finish of the stove? Also, there are stubborn stains on
the drip trays that I need to remove.

Subject: Iodine / decoction mashing


I've been reading some messages debating the iodine test, saying that
it is a poor indicator for conversion as the husks may react with the
iodine.  So I wanted to post my results from yesterdays brewing:


To start off, we took a crushed grain of barley, put it in a bowl with
a touch of water, and added a drop of iodine.  The grain and the water
around it turned purplish black, from the iodine's original light
yellowish-reddish-brown.


We then started mashing (double decoction -- protein rest -> boil 1/2
of the grain -> add it back for sacchrification rest -> boil liquid ->
mashout) and tested the liquor with iodine throughout.


After doughing in, the liquor, which was fairly turbid, turned black
immediately.  During sacchrification, after about an hour, the
reaction became less and less intense.  After an hour and a half of
sacchrification, the liquor tested negative (almost no change from the
iodine's original color).  To test for good extraction from the grain,
we took out a kernal of spent grain and a drop of iodine to it: no
reaction.


So, I wanted to supply my experience with iodine: that it can be used,
reliably, to detect the degree of sacchrification, and that
sacchrification is not complete until iodine tests negative.


        Bill


p.s. This was my first experience with decoction mashing.  While it
was alot more work than infusion mashing, the resulting wort tasted
incredible!  No tannin astringency, as they precipitated out in the
first decoction.  I can't wait to taste the finished product (Red Ant
Lager).

Subject: Hop skunkage...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Taking a quick break during the sparge of my 15 gallon batch of
nondescript pale ale 6,70 to share this observation:


After bagging the hops (plugs; Cascade) in preparation fo rhte boil,
I continued working outside in the sun. About 15 minutes later, I
happenned to wipe my nose. Skunk city, folks! So: did some of the
oils isomerize on my hands to be skunked by the UV affect? What's the
deal? I thought that isomerization was required for this to happen...


Anyone care to weigh in on this? (I _DO_ have witnesses...)


See ya!

I've had a Hunter Airstat on an old upright freezer for a couple of years

freezer on (the opposite problem referenced above).  It wasn't a difficult

Here's a recipe I like so far.  I recently bottled this batch and it is
lagering now.  It is based on a recipe I've had success with in the past.


Mac's Maerzen or Galileo Electro-Optoberfest
(makes 5 US gallons)
10 lb. German 2 row Pilsner malt
3/4 lb. German 2 row Light Crystal Malt
3/4 lb. British 2 row Crystal Malt (I'd estimate the color at around 60
lovibond)
1-1/2 oz. Saaz hop plug (3.1% AA) 45 min.
1/4 oz. Hallertau Hersbruker hop plug (2.7% AA) 45 min.
1/2 oz. Saaz hop plug (3.1% AA) 15 min.
Wyeast Munich Lager Yeast #2308


Single decoction mash.
OG = 1.066
FG =  1.008


Bottled in 5 liter minikegs with 1/3 cup corn sugar boiled in 1 pint of
water.


I pitched 1 qt. of yeast starter.  4 liters sounds excessive to me.
 Everything I've read says, 1 qt. should be plenty for lagers unless you are
brewing a real big beer like a double bock.

You could do this all at once and not worry about sanitizing the inside of
the second stage chiller by linking these two chillers in series.  Hook the
10 ft coil  to your water supply and place it inside a bucket of ice water.
 Connect your immersion chiller to the outflow of the coil in the ice water.
 The first coil will act to chill the cooling water supply to the immersion
chiller.

Subject: Freezing UNDRIED hop


Hey Neighbors,


Jim asked:
>Has anyone here experimented with freezing UNDRIED hops?  Comments?


I wouldn't call it an experiment but I froze last years crop (my first) of
N.Brew hops.  I picked them off the vine and stuffed them into glass baby
food jars, tightened the lid and packed these into plastic wet wipe boxes
and all went into the freezer.  At brew time I pulled one out to thaw and
used only for aroma since these are home grown and I didn't know the % AA.
I did find that they stayed moist and bright green, kept their aroma and
remained whole unlike the broken and flatten store bought ones.  As to
whether they made a difference to the beer I really can't say for sure,
there was definitly a hop aroma to the beer but perhaps from the other
hops.  I am going to do the same with this years crop, maybe I'm lazy,
no...I'm definitly lazy but it just doesn't make any sence to dry them
first and then freeze.


Perhaps it would be a good practice to squeeze the little buggers between
my fingers first to crush their glands...OUCH, to extract more of the good
stuff and then pop them into the wort.

Subject: N2 and Guiness faucets


There has been quite a bit of bandwidth about the use of nitrogen for
dispencing beer. So I'll throw in as well. ( it may be that this topis has
come up in the past ) After using mixed gas 70/30, N2 /CO2 with fair sucess
on the home draft system for about 5 years. I switched to straight N2 as it
is cheaper than CO2 and easier to get. The cost of change over was a adaptor
for the regulator to fit the N2 cylinder approx $10. I am using Guiness flow
control faucets ( the old ones ) and dispencing at 18 - 20 psig. It works
very well with no great loss of carbonation, in spite of info to the
contrary. I am certain that this statement may be nay sayed. But I invite any
to stop by for a homebrew on the N2 to back it up.
