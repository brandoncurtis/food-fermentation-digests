Candi sugar is almost pure sucrose: it is the last stage of refining
before the common crystallized sugar. Brown sugar is either refined sugar
with some molasses added, or ("raw sugar") slightly less refined sucrose.


Invert sugar does not crystallize (it turns into a glassy mass with
microcrystals, at best).

Sweet proteins, indeed. Starting with the dipeptide aspartame, of course,
but most notable the monellins from the tropical Serendipity Berry. These
dipeptides (about 100 aminoacids) are intensely sweet and carbohydrate-
free.


Not to be confused with miraculin from the Miracle Fruit, which makes sour
taste sweet but is not itself sweet. Artichokes also contain a similar
protein.

A 10 minute boil in beer will not break the disaccharide bonds. Much too
short and far from being acidic enough. When making syrup one adds a
little lemon juice or vinegar to hydrolyse a tiny portion of the sucrose
in order to prevent crystallization; this produces a few percent at most
of glucose and fructose, but it is sufficient to inhibit the formation of
sucrose crystals. At the pH of beer it would take days to hydrolyse all
the sucrose.

Concerning the idea of spinning the fermentor in space to simulate

This will still pretty much be the situation in PEI.  Bringing beer, wine
or spirits into PEI is strictly controlled.  Things may change after the
opening of the fixed link next year.


Since nine years ago, however, NB has changed somewhat.  In an effort to
raise revenue while decreasing costs, the NB government has introduced
a system allowing selected convenience stores in smaller communities
to sell beer, wine and spirits.  Interestingly enough, these stores do
not have to curtail the sale of alcohol on Sunday or holidays and can sell
whenever the store is open.  This means that in some smaller communities,
you can buy alcohol at times when you can not in the larger centres because
in the cities, sale of alcohol is through government stores only (except
of course, licensed restaurants, taverns or bars each being controlled by
its own set of legislation.)  From mid-June to December, however, the
province will allow one government store in each city to open on Sunday
and holidays for restricted hours as a concession to the tourists.


At this time, there is a micro-brewery in Fredericton, Picaroons, which
has been in operation for about a year but very recently opened its own
retail outlet (a rooftop patio and indoor tap room.)  Picaroons will
offer brewery tours (call 1-506-455-ALES.) and specializes in seasonal
beers.  Looking at the ad in yesterday's paper, I see Timber Hog Stout
being the featured beer of the day.  Picaroons in located on Piper's Lane,
a pedestrian walkway between Queen and King streets in the block between
York and Westmorland.


The main problem with alcohol purchases in NB and PEI is price.  Even
after you discount for the price being in Canadian funds, the amount of
taxes makes the price prohibitive.  A 473ml bottle of Grolsch will run
about $2.80 and I am not sure what the domestic beers would set me back
these days.

To get an equivalent amount of glucose molecules you need about the same
amount of corn sugar as sucrose (see below).  This means that if you used
half the amount of corn sugar that you usually use of sucrose then you
were using about 1/2 the number of monosaccharide molecules than usual.


Maltose is a disaccharide composed of 2 glucose molecules.  The use of
maltose as a food source first entails getting the maltose into the cell,
then maltase (an enzyme) breaks the alpha-1,4 bonds between the 2 glucose
molecules.  The resulting 2 glucose molecules are then metabolized in the
glycolysis pathway.  This means that during maltose fermentation the
glucose pathways are fully active and I don't see how adding glucose could
cause the yeast to stall in such a situation.  To the contrary I would
think that adding glucose (corn sugar) to a maltose fermentation would
cause the yeast to ignore the maltose until the newly available glucose
was used up.  Which is basically the Crabtree effect.


In the case of sucrose, which is a disaccharide composed of a molecule of
glucose and a molecule of fructose, not only does the sucrose get split
but the fructose part is converted enzymatically to glucose and then
metabolized in the glycolysis pathway.  Since the metabolism of sucrose
involves the additional conversion of fructose to glucose I don't see how
it could be more efficient for priming than corn sugar.  And again, I
doubt that a fermentation would be stalled by the addition of corn
sugar.


In my long-winded way what I am saying is that I think glucose metabolism
is never inhibited by other sugars and I doubt the use of corn sugar is
causing a fermentative stall and causing your priming problems.


> Does anyone weigh their corn sugar? How much is enough?


Yes, I typically use 80 grams for a 5 gallon batch, but I tend to like
my brews more lightly carbonated than others, so perhaps 100-120 grams
would be more generally acceptable.  The corn sugar that I have is about
80 grams per 1/2 cup.


Speculations on the source of your problem:


Not enough viable yeast making it into the bottles.
Not enough corn sugar.  Measure it by weight.  (28 grams/ounce)
Low temperature during conditioning.
Space/time warp shunting carbonation into the gamma quadrant.


Here is a way to test the "efficiency" of priming with glucose versus
sucrose.  We are looking to generate the same number of monosaccharide
molecules (glucose + fructose from sucrose) as glucose from corn sugar.
The molecular weight in grams of any substance contains the same number
of moelcules (Avogadro's number, ~6 x 10**23).


Mol wt of glucose  = 180.16 grams
Mol wt of fructose = 180.16 grams
Mol wt of sucrose  = 342.30 grams


sucrose/glucose ratio = (342.30/180.16)/2 = 1.9/2 = 0.95


So, split a batch of beer in half and prime one half with corn sugar
(glucose) and one half with cane sugar (sucrose) using 95% of the weight
of sucrose as glucose.  For example, if you use 100 grams of glucose use
95 grams of sucrose.  Mark and store the bottles under identical
conditions and pop one of each every few days and check on the carbonation
level.


If you do this please report your results back to the HBD.

"Wiley's Twisted Lemon Alcohol Drink,"  and the fellas who import Bass to

    I have dried "herbal" matter in my past.  The best flavor after drying
seemed to occur when I have dried the matter slowly.  This allows for
somewhat of a curing process.  Typically I would place a single layer of
herbs in the bottom of a large paper grocery sack and folded the top over
and closed.  It would take about a week for it to dry and the resulting
"cured herbs" tasted significantly better than the the stuff I dried much
more quickly i.e., microwave, oven, hanging in open room.  I wonder if
curing would significantly improve the flavor of hops?

I keep reading questions from brewers who want to insulate their fermentation
vessels. I would only reccomend this if you want to keep it warm.
Fermentation (especially primary) produces a lot of heat and insulation would
cause your brew to retain this heat. FYI I found a great idea for a cooled
fermentation chamber on the web at http://oeonline.com/~pbabcock/labcab.html.
Cudos to Ken Schwartz for sharing such a great idea.


I have a question about using an aspirator to start a siphon. I ran across
this idea in an old issue of Zyrmurgy and am curious to know if anyone has
tried this. I do recall using an aspirator in chem labs and it was very easy.
Siphoning is such a PIA!

Hello HOMEBREWERS


I am sorry if I waste bandwidth. What I ask here is really for the
sake of homebrewing.


South Africa has a small homebrew community.
I am trying to put together a list of everybody and every thing
related to South African homebrewing.
We really need to know about each other. This can make our hobbie
easier and could get more people interested in homebrewing.


If you are a homebrewer or have any related stuff to
homebrewing  and live in SOUTHERN AFRICA
please fill in this form and e-mail it to me DIRECTLY.


acg`at`nanoteq.co.za


Do NOT send it to the Digest please. I allready waste a lot of
bandwidth.
Also tell me about everybody that you know of that does not have
e-mail.  I really want to get everybody together.

Hey Dave;
        I can't speak to any technical aspects, but I use 3/4 cup
glucose per 4-gal. batch. I find it's just about right. I've used
cane sugar when I had forgotten that I was out. I noticed no
difference. Perhaps there's another variable at work here?

Subject: Corn sugar, Split full boil


     Bill responds to Dave that corn sugar is only 70-80% fermentable.
     That is not correct.  Corn sugar is glucose and is 100% fermentable.


     Dave says that his beers are underprimed when using 3/4 cup corn sugar
     (per 5 gallons, I assume).  I've never had a problem using that rate,
     nor has anyone else that I know.  Is your carbonation (or lack
     thereof) consistent from bottle to bottle?  Are you making high
     gravity beers that may be undercarbonated because of tired yeast?


     It is more accurate to measure sugar by volume in the absence of
     moisture analysis, especially in New York this time of year! (although
     the differences will be small).


     Jim Booth says that he splits his boil between two pots.  I thought
     this was fine until I read on to where he said that he starts one when
     it is full and continues to collect runoff in the second.


     That means that your boiling a high gravity wort and a low gravity
     wort.  Which one do you hop?  The gravity will definitely affect your
     utilization, but you've probably taken that into  account.


     Why not buy an eight gallon enamel pot for ~$40?  It fits over two
     burners and you can dispense with fancy plumbing for wort chillers.


     I use a 1/4 keg (Sankey type) with the top cut out and a nipple welded
     to the bottom for a spigot for 5-6 gallon batches.  They're cheaply
     available and it is great to use a counterflow chiller with the
     spigot.  I can whirlpool in the boiler to remove hot break and hop
     debris.


     Have fun!

I have a Westinghouse round top with a small cubish freezer at the top of
the main (only) compartment.  It *can't* be removed as far as I know,
because the freon lines run right thru the walls the freezer itself.  You
may want to check yours just to make sure you don't have the same feature.

Subject: Beer in spaaaace experiment


     Considering the bandwidth that has recently been spent on this subject
     which, I'm sure, is near and dear to all of our hearts, I thought I would
     unselfishly attempt an experiment to help verify the theories put forth
     here.  Since my wife and I are flying to Maui at the end of next week and
     since I had a batch of CherryDunkel in the fermenter, I thought this would
     be a perfect opportunity to set up the experiment.  We will be in an
     aircraft spending a great deal of time over the ocean, but the people at
     Delta seem to have a problem with flying parabolic arcs for me over the
Pacific. They are also not too thrilled with my plan to bring 5 gallons of     


     fermenting beer aboard.  Undaunted, I did the next best thing.


     I inserted a racking cane through the stopper in my carboy into the
approximate center of the fermenting liquid and affixed an airlock. I then     


     hauled the carboy to the roof of my house (damn those steep Cape Cod
     roofs!) and stationed my wife near its projected impact point.  Then, to
     simulate the micro G environment, I dropped the sucker off the roof.  My
     wife says that the airlock was bubbling furiously as the carboy raced by
     her so the CO2 bubble in the center seems plausible.  However, this
     literally ground (and carboy!) breaking experiment ends sadly.  When the
     carboy impacted the earth, it shattered sending partially fermented beer
     all over my wife, the ground, and the surrounding plant life.  The ground
was so dry that it sucked up all the beer before I could climb down so none    


     is available for in depth analysis of how this brief period at near zero G
     affected the ferment.  A pity.


     My conclusion is that there is little to no practical application of this
     particular discussion to brewing here on earth, save for allowing us to
     whip out our Theoretical Intellects and see who's is bigger.  Of course,
there is one factor I forgot to take into account - the amount of time this    


     particular mash spent at 158 F.


     The mind boggles...

I can't help you with your actual question, Jerry, but you don't _have_ to
keep the CO2 inside the fridge.  you can drill a hole in the side to run the
hose through.  We're getting ready to set up our beer fridge this way, after
seeing how wonderfully its working for a buddy of ours....he has room for 3
kegs since he moved the CO2 outside.


good luck!

Subject: magical carbonation?


Greetings HBDers,


There is some interesting stuff in the book "Brew Your Own Real Ale at Home"
by Wheeler and Protz besides all of the British ale recipes.


For instance, they recommend that all ales (even those batches that will
be bottled) be matured in barrels after secondary fermentation.  Maturation
times range from a couple of weeks to a year or more, depending on the type
of ale.  Their reasoning is that this extra time allows the beer to clarify
even further, and that some of the harsher aromas are given a chance to vent.


Do any of you follow this practice?  Would an extended period in the
secondary fermenter accomplish the same thing?  Does the extra maturation
time really make a difference?


The authors also state that although priming the ale prior to bottling will
produce carbonation quickly, it is not necessary(!), as CO2 will be produced
by the slow fermentation of the residual dextrins in the ale over a several-
month period.


I'm wondering if any of you have had the patience to try bottling without
priming, and then waiting for this (magical?) carbonation.


Curiously,

Subject: Priming with honey/N.VA. Brewers/Carboys


     I have only a few questions for the HBD Collective.


     1.  I have brewed a five gallon batch of a honey amber ale.  I racked
     it into a cornelious keg on Sunday.  I would like to prime it with
     honey, Orange Blossom Honey to be exact.
         The yield after numerous carboy transfers was a little over 4
     gallons.


     2.  I currently live in Arlington Va and have just started all-grain
     brewing.  I am in search of other frugal brewers who would like to go
     in on a few different 50lb. sacks of grain and possibly other
     supplies.  If there are enough people that respond I think it would be
     easy to get it at wholesale prices.


     3.  In a long quest to find a keg like container that would fit in my
     fridge a friend came upon the idea of taking a 3 gallon glass carboy,
     putting a siphoning cap on it, then put a racking cane down one side
     of the cap with a siphoning hose fitted with a plastic tap head
     attached, then hook the other side of the siphoning cap up to a CO2
     tank via more siphoning hose, crank up to 5psi and you're ready to go.
     ---My concern is the amount of pressure a regular glass carboy can
     take.  I force carbonated a stout and about 30psi before it even
     registered that the carboy could explode with me in front of the
     fridge and then in the hospital for months for reconstructive surgery.
     Does anyone know if there are any pressure ratings for glass carboys?


     I would be grateful to receive private responses to #2, and any
     response to 1 and 3.


     Wearing protective clothing anytime I go for food,
           Craig

I am not sure what your hops are - if they are cultivated hops going wild,
maybe they are usefull.
Main problem with wild hops is that they may contain male plants
which polinate the female plants used in brewing.
Polinated hops grow to seeds and are quite useless (at least I was told
so). So the male plants are destroyed in commercial planting.
I have lived in central Europe where wild hops are commonplace - they are
supposedly native from there - and the abundance of male plants rendered wild
hops useless. It also made the comercial plantators  go out of their way to
destroy any possible wild hops around their fields.
I am not a hop expert, take it on its 2c worth.

Actually, you want something higher than 75% fermentable.  Wheeler
states that the syrups he refers to
"contain about 20% non-fermenable sugars."


This is also supported from the context of Wheelers use of maltose
syrup.  The Wheeler-Protz book, "Brew
Your Own Real Ale at Home," contains recipes based on the information
in the Protz book, "The Real Ale
Almanac."  Some of the recipes add maltose syrup where none is listed
as an ingrediant in the Almanac.
Wheeler explains that these are instances where his brewing software
indicated that the end ABV could not
be achieved from the stated OG if only the listed grains were used.  He
states that some English brewers are
reluctant to admit to the use of sugar syrups. He implies that one such
case is Ringwood's "Old Thumper"
where no syrup is listed in the Almanac. Wheeler's recipe calls for 4%
maltose syrup. The OG is listed at
1.058 and the ABV is listed at 5.9%, The Almanac lists the the ABV of
Old Thumper at 5.8%.
