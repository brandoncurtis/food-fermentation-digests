Subject: Kwak, raw wheat


Curt asks: 
 
<I have become a big fan of Kwak (from Beglium).  In Michael Jacksons book, a 
<picture is shown of a dark brown beer in what looks like a quarter yard glass;


<the only Kwak that I have ever had is orange/copper in color...is there a Kwak


<dark that can only be obtained in Belgium? 
 
Pauwel Kwak is a classic strong Belgian Ale of 8% ABV.  It is produced 
by the Bosteels brewery in Buggenhout.   Bosteels also makes Prosit Pils 
and t'Zelfde at 4.8 and 6.1% respectively. 
 
(see Crombecqs excellent page: http://www.dma.be/p/bier/beer.htm   ) 
 
In Belgium beer bars each beer is paired with a unique glass and probably 
none is as distinctive as the foot glass and holder that Pauwel Kwak is served 
in.  I doubt that Jackson would pour a different beer in this glass but 
more likely is that the lighting made the beer look darker than what you 
see in person.  The same thing happened with the Zymurgy photo of my 
conference beer, Esprit de Boire.  It looked much darker in the glass as 
seen in the photo. 
 
John writes:

This is not necessary.  Decoct if you wish, but multiple step infusions 
will convert raw wheat just fine.  Dilute the mash prior to lautering, 
or dough in very loose, and lauter slowly.

Subject: HDB size


Hi, 
 
I've been following the thread about the HDB getting too large. 
I really cannot see a problem with that. I think it's great that 
the digest is growing, there is a lot more info here than there was 
a couple of years ago. There are also many dicussions concentrating 
on a very small part of the brewing science; not that many general 
discussions. 
You have to read the HDB like you read a newspaper. I suppose you 
don't read everything in a newspaper, at least I don't. You are 
selective, and read what you are interested in, do the same with 
the HDB, and you will not be spending all day reading the HBD. 
Also, there are down arrow/PGDOWN on my keyboard, how about yours???? 
I'm looking forward to the HDB getting even larger, which probably 
means more info, if we can keep up the quality of the discussions. 
Just my opinion. 
Any opinins on the above. Post here or use private e-mail.

FWIW I've recently noticed a candi-like crystalized rock sugar in both 
Indian and Thai markets here in Chicago.  The Indian variety is very light 
and looks just like Belgian candi sugars that I've seen in home brew 
stores.  The Thai variety is a yellow crystal rock sugar and is possibly 
made from palm sugar.  Has anyone out there had a chance to use these, or 
possibly know if they could be substituted for the Belgian varieties?

Howdy beerlings: 
Just a couple of quick notes. In the May/June edition of Chile Pepper

Dear Collective: 
 
 
 
 Doe sanyone out there know where one can locate large, food grade, 
plastic containers that could be used as a fermenter?  By large I mean 
10-20 gallons or so..  5 gallons at a time just doesn't cut it anymore - 
especially for wine, which ties up a fermenter for 6 weeks or so.

Al wrote in hbd#2109: 
"I've done some experiments with fill level that seem to indicate that a 
high fill level (like 0 to 15ml of headspace) appears to inhibit carbonation. 
It not only goes slower, but the final carbonation level may be significantly 
lower too!" 
 
I've also done some experiments with fill level in 12 oz. bottles, with fills 
ranging from ca. 6oz (1/2 full bottle) to almost all the way to the top of the 
bottle. Beer (pale ale) was batch-primed with 4.5oz (by weight) glucose in 5 
gal. All bottles were blanketed with CO2 before capping. Slightly lower 
carbonation was observed in the 1/2 full bottles. No significant difference was
observed (via mouthfeel) in any of the more 'normal' fill levels (1.5 inch to 
nearly zero head space), either in carbonation time, or amount. More 'hiss' is 
heard when uncapping bottles with increasing head space for obvious reasons. 
 
Bottom line for me; I now leave almost no head space (easy to do with a 
PhillsPhiller; no relationship, bla bla bla) with the idea of reducing 
oxidation
potential. This has worked well for me for the last 25 batches or so.

Subject: Party Pigs


 
Carl Hattenburg asked about Party Pigs. 
 
With due respect, you're better off going to Corny's.  As an owner of pigs, 
my experience is thus: 1. Pigs are a pain to seal.  The valve and screwclamp 
assembly is not for the mechanically disadvantaged.  It must be sanitary, it 
must be centered, the screwheads must be ungoobered, and the gasket (!) must 
be seated correctly, all with 2.5 gal or so of beer in your lap.  2. Pigs 
are a pain to clean.  Hot water of dishwasher temp turns them into 
provacative plastic sculpture.  Otherwise, it's elbow grease, and long 
handled brushing. 3. Pigs are pricey.  Initial cost is good, but the 4 buck 
per batch cost for the bag here locally (and in most catalogs I've seen) 
puts O&M costs outa site.  It'll take about 5 batches, but capitalizing the 
pigs, the bags, and a new set of screws (a power screwdriver is real handy) 
evens out to a used corny keg setup. 
 
Pigs are convenient.  They do fit well in the fridge.  They do dispense 
well.  They transport easily, and they are always something to talk about at 
the party.  I went to cornys, and haven't looked back. 
Cheers.

The only Kwak I've seen or tasted is the orange/copper/medium amber that you 
refer to.  Indeed, in Jackson's New World Guide to Beer, it is pictured as 
a brown beer.  His Beer Companion doesn't even mention it, but in Jackson's 
The Great Beers of Belgium, there are two pictures.  The one inside the back 
cover is brown, but the one on page 223 is medium amber coloured. In the text, 
Jackson calls the colour "garnet" which would be reddish amber.  It could be 
that from the shape of the glass, the colour of the beer is strongly influenced
by the background or even the colour of the stand in which the beer glass must 
rest.  All of my beer books have but one type of Kwak Pauel listed.

First of all, welcome back.  Your idea of glazed concrete fermenters is 
already in use... at Whitbread, if I'm not mistaken.  I've visited many 
breweries in the UK and on the continent that use open fermenters, but 
virtually all these beers (almost all the ones I can think of) have at least 
one of following things in common: high serving rate, pasteurization and/or 
they are Lambics. 
 
The breweries that immediately come to mind are: 
 
Rodenbach (only the secondaries are open and the bottled beer is pasteurized), 
Ram (Young's - cask beers served quickly, bottled beers pasteurized), 
Tadcaster (Samuel Smith's - same as Ram), 
all the traditional Lambic/Lambiek breweries (well, they are sour beers), 
Traquair House (same as Ram), 
Caledonian (same as Ram), and 
Shepherd Neame (same as Ram). 
 
Hmmm... Zum Uerige uses open primaries and then lagers their Altbier in 
closed tanks, but it is served very quickly once ready, so this is a slight 
variation. 
 
Another variant is the Paulaner Hausbraueri (brewpub) in Munich which used 
open primaries and lagers in closed tanks, but in typical Bavarian fashion 
they seal their open fermenters in a glass case.  Oddly, their beers are 
unfiltered and murkier than Witbier (very un-Bavarian)! 
 
One brewery that does not pasteurize their bottled beers but uses open 
fermenters (actually, they cover the tops with plastic sheets) is Bell's 
in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  I have not had any of their average-strength beers 
in quite some time, so they may have cleaned up their act, but they used 
to be invariably infected and would gush after a few weeks, even refrigerated. 
Despite this, I love their beers, especially the stronger ones like the 
Expedition Stout and Third Coast Old Ale. 
 
Godspeed on your new venture and please don't forget us here in the middle 
of the country when you begin wider distribution!

>Actually, you want something higher than 75% fermentable.  Wheeler states 
>that the syrups he refers to "contain about 20% non-fermenable sugars." 
 
Wheeler also says "In the recipes the terms 'maltose syrup' and 'glucose syrup'
refer to maize [corn] derived syrups.  For home brewing purposes it matters 
not whether high maltose or high glucose syrup is used, the end result is 
about the same." 
 
While it may be true that in the UK "maltose syrup" is only 20% unfermentable, 
in the US "high-maltose corn syrup" is typically 25% unfermentable as I posted 
earlier.  I contend that besides the difference in fermentability, if you are 
using a significant amount of these syrups there would be an important 
difference: too much glucose syrup (more than say 20%) could possibily lead 
to a stuck fermentation (depending on the yeast strain). 
 
sprialc continues: 
>Wheeler explains that these are instances where his brewing software 
>indicated that the end ABV could not be achieved from the stated OG if 
>only the listed grains were used. 
 
If Wheeler's use of small amounts (like the 4% in the Old Thumper recipe) is 
indeed to increase apparent attenuation, I contend that it is not necessary. 
The apparent attenuation in the Old Thumper is 76% which could very well 
be reached without the use of maltose syrup.  While he discusses different 
sources of yeast and even covers recovering yeast from bottle-conditioned 
beers, I disagree most strongly with his contention that "The best type 
of beer to brew for [yeast] propogation purposes is a strong, dark, all malt, 
hoppy brew of OG 1065 or greater; the higher the better."  High alcohol 
beers are known to stress yeasts and it is for this reason that Sierra 
Nevada repitches yeast from all their beers except the Celebration Ale and 
Bigfoot Barleywine. 
 
If this is the kind of wort he uses for propogating yeast, this may be one 
reason why he has difficulty getting 76% apparent attenuation without the 
use of maltose or glucose syrup.  More than likely, he uses only a few 
strains of yeast for all his brewing and it just so happens that they are 
all relatively unattenuative yeasts.  Then again, on page 137, he gives a 
recipe for Woodforde's Phoenix XXX, which has an OG of 1047, no sugar 
syrups and an FG of 1011 which is an apparent attenuation of 77%! 
 
Despite quite a few errors, I think this is a very interesting book for 
anyone who already brews (everything from all-extract to all-grain is 
covered in only 43 pages!).  The biggest problem I have with the book is 
that only *after* 100+ pages of recipes is there a "Explanatory Key to 
Recipes" in which he explains that the recipes assume only a mash 
efficiency of 75%.  Furthermore, his hop utilization is extremely low, 
so I recommend that, before you use his recipes, you recalculate the 
grain and hop weights based upon your efficiency and utilization.

No doubt this post will precede my other post, but I wanted to correct

Is this correct?  Does anyone else pre-gelatinize unmalted wheat for a Wit? 
 I've read that unmalted grain adjuncts need to be pre-gelatinized before 
mashing for other styles.  However, I've made a number of Wits and I've 
never seen gelatinizing as a requirement in any Wit recipe.  I've just 
mashed the unmalted wheat starting with a protein rest, but just crushed not 
gelatinized.  My yield hasn't apparently been hurt as a result.  I ended up 
with the characteristic cloudiness, of course. 
 
You are on target about the milling.  Good time to invite your 
brother-in-law over :) 
 
FWIW, I just made a light ale with 2 lbs of rice (pre-gelatinized by boiling 
for a solid hour, of course) that I call "Reinheitsgebot be damned".  It's 
for the spousal unit, but it's actually a pretty effective lawnmower beer.

Subject: Open Fermenter Coatings


 
Father Barleywine writes: 
>I strongly suspect that raw concrete would be a poor surface for 
fermentation, carrying the high risk of culturing contaminants in crevices 
and leaching various non-food-grade substances into the acidic beer. 
 
Right you are!  Concrete is made up of portland cement (composed of lime, 
kiln dust or fly ash, marine shells, sand, iron ore, etc), aggregate and 
water.  Curing concrete is a chemical process, called hydration, by which 
the water and lime combine, producing a lot of heat, and leaving behind a 
solid.  This is not the result of "drying" of the wet mix.  About 2-1/2 
gallons of potable water are required to hydrate one bag of cement, but this 
produces a very stiff mix which is difficult to work with.  You can safely 
increase the water upto a max. of 6 gal/sack, but be aware that the extra 
water  will reduce the tensile strength, and increase the permeability of 
your concrete.  The   residual pH will be rather high also, so you'll 
definitely want a coating. 
 
For coatings, there are various epoxy compounds, and you may be able to find 
something food-grade, but I'm not sure....I know who to ask if you'd like 
more info.  Plan on at least $3 per square foot for a 2 coat system.  Your 
application will be smaller than a professional installer will want to fool 
with though, so the $3 will probably cover you for materials (I usually get 
it installed for that price). 
 
Barring that, there is a new surfacing material in the swimming pool 
industry.  It's a flowable plastic that sets up as an impermeable coating. 
 It is usually applied 1/4" thick, and has small fiberglass reinforcing 
threads in it, that give it a bit of texture (slip resistant).  I'd check 
this one out, as they guarantee the product for 20-30 years, claiming that 
algae will never grow on it (no place for the buggers to grab on), and it 
requires zero maintenance.  They also claim that chemical usage will be 
drastically reduced because the coating leaches nothing into the water 
(unlike traditional plaster coatings), so I would guess that this could 
possibly be safe for food contact, as well as durable enough to cope with 
the chemical reactions of fermenting wort.  One drawback, for pools, you 
must always keep it filled (weighted) with water to prevent the surface from 
popping up.  It doesn't actually bond to the concrete base, and is only 
attached at the edges.  Might not be a problem for a smallish open 
fermenter. 
 
Once you settle on  a coating, the next most important thing to figure out 
will be your formwork design.  This is different from the "design" of your 
structure, and deals with building forms that can handle the liquid 
properties of your concrete, until it becomes the solid you have envisioned. 
 I have a couple of excellent references on hand, when you get to that 
point. 
 
If it were me though, I'd be on the lookout for auctions of restaurant/food 
industry equipment or places going out of business.  Virtually everything is 
stainless, and you can find tanks, tubs, containers of various sizes for 
relatively little cost.  Also, dairy farm equipment can be converted...just 
ask the boys at the Marthasville brewery in GA!! 
 
Hope this helps...let me know if you'd like more details.

Many have stated their preference for freezers over refrigerators.  My 
question is:  how do you load a 5 gal carboy into a chest freezer?

pH probes should definitely last longer than 6 months.  You can purchase 
"storage solution" for probes, but that is a little pricey.  I use a pH 4 
buffer saturated with potassium chloride. 
 
You may be able to recondition the probe by soaking it in a series of 
strong acid solutions for short periods of time - check the literature that 
came with the probe for details!  The likely problem is precipitates from 
your tap water clogging the holes in the glass membrane of the probe. 
These can be easily removed.

I am taking a two week vacation in late August.  My wife and I will leave 
Detroit, drive to Pittsburgh, PA.  We will stay there one night.  Then we will 
drive to Johnstown, PA for one night.  We will also stay near Gettysburg, PA 
for one night.  Then we will head for Mystic, Connecticutt to stay for about 
a week.  On our way back, we will make our way through Massachusetts, Vermont, 
New Hampshire, Quebec City, Canada, Montreal, and Ottawa then back to Detroit. 
I would appreciate any tips on beer/brewing places and sites to see along the 
way.  Oh, by the way, you can bet we will stop at the Ben & Jerry's company 
and see if they have any beer sorbet.  I'll also keep an eye out for a 
Guinness shake(any clues?).

i keep reading posts about the evil miller e-mail and i wonder 
this:  is hop extract really cost effective for a megabrewery? 
i doubt it and think that miller probably is using the same hop 
pellets that many other micros and megas use these days. the 
'heart' is the hop after separation from the outer portion of 
the cone. in other words, i'd call the spiel 100% bull b/c 
besides hiding behind proprietorship they don't have any real 
claim to a significant difference from the competition. besides, 
in the dog eat wolf world of mass brewing, who's going to tell 
you how much hops they add so that you can claim to use 4 times 
as much?

According to HBRCP, you should use 10.5 lbs of 2-row for 5 gallons of 1.053 
wort at 70%. 
 
Try my Homebrew Recipe Calculator Program (HBRCP11) for an easy to use full 
screen homebrew log. It has been on the web for awhile but unfortunately 
it could not be downloaded proper...(stupid timeout). It has all the nice 
tables you've come to expect: Grains, hops, misc ingredients, yeast strains, 
styles, misc notes, and hop utilization. It also has converters for weight, 
volume, and temperature as well as calculators for IBU's, Priming sugar by 
weight (based on Dave Drapers experiments), and Mash Temp changes for 
infusion and decoction for volumes. It prints blank brew logs (for those 
who don't mash by thier computers), recipe books, simple labels (12 to 
a page) and a clipboard paste routine. Special features are the ability to 
copy, scale, and convert between metric and U.S. units.

This is the Blueberry ale I plan on doing this weekend. 
I am assuming that blueberry juice has a gravity of about 1.009 pts/gal. 
Can anyone shed some light on this? Perhaps I need to do some experiments

I also recall this beer from my childhood in the Pittsburgh area in the 
60's.  I believe that it was brewed by Pittsburgh Brewing Company, home of 
Iron City and Sam Adams.  As I recall, it was a seasonal beer, but I don't 
remember any more about it.  I have no idea if it's still being brewed.

Subject: Tap sneezes


Greetings everyone! 
 
I have kegged my beer for about two years now and have figured most 
things out.  There is one problem I can't lick though. 
 
If the tap sits around for a little while after dispensing, some of the 
CO2 comes out of solution in the beer out line.  When I draw the next 
glass, I get a little beer, a sneeze of CO2 and more beer.  The problem 
is that the sneeze produces quite a bit of foam.  My father in law's 
system does not seem to suffer from the same problem. 
 
My beer out line is about 4 feet long, if that makes any difference. 
Any help would be appreciated. 
 
Thank's

I'm currently building a 3-tier system using a 10-gallon Gott cooler as my top 
level hot liquor tank. I removed the plastic valve assembly and punched out    
the button/spindle that's normally used to control water flow. I reattached    
    the valve assembly to the cooler and attached a hose and hose clamp to the 
plastic spigot. What I can't seem to figure out is how to plug the hole left   
    by the button/spindle. 
 
   Has anyone gone through this drill? 
 
I'm sure there are higher-tech ways to do it, but what I did was get a 
drilled rubber stopper of the right size, hacksaw a piece of an old 
racking cane to go through the stopper, and use tubing to connect the 
racking cane to a phalse bottom and a stopcock. 
 
I think the right size rubber stopper is the same one you use for a 
regular beer bottle, so you may already have one.

     We used to sell Hanna pH meters, but they had a high failure rate. 
Try an Oakton or a ProPen pH Meter (try a hydroponic store).  You can buy 
an electrode storage solution (typically $12 for a pint) and there are also 
electrode cleaning solutions.  This will help extend the life of your Pen.
