Subject: Priming amounts


Dear Friends, 
 
Now that I am finally caught up with the last 10 HBDs I'd like to 
toot my own horn slightly to remind readers that there is an article 
on calculating priming amounts written by myself and Mark Hibberd, 
available on my web page and slated to appear in the next issue of 
BT.  I don't claim it to be the last word by any means but most of 
the issues regarding how much carbonation one can expect for a given 
amount of glucose and sucrose are covered; in addition, I report some 
experimental data showing that water adsorption increases the weight 
of sugar by wholly trivial amounts, so that weight *is* better than 
volume-- and these trials were done here in Sydney where it is 
Bleedin' humid during the summer too.

I would like to clone Breckenridge IPA.  I have enjoyed this beer on 
many occasions but it is really hard to find with any regularity in 
these parts.  I am new to homebrewing, having brewed two batches with 
Coopers kits.  I think my time would be better spent looking for a

Subject: Refrigerator vs. Upright Freezer


 
 
 
Maxwell McDaniel asks: 
 
Which is better, refrigerator or freezer?  And if it's a freezer, do I 
go for upright of the other kind (coffin style)? 
 
Can anyone give me guidance on how to hook up taps and CO2 lines without 
disturbing any freon coils? 
 
Reply: 
 
Since I own both an upright freezer, and a refrigerator for brewing purposes, 
I will give you the pros and cons as I see them. 
 
The pros of an upright freezer: 
 
With an appropriate add-on temperature controller, you get a better range of 
temperature control than with a refrigerator. There is no wasted space as in 
contrast to a refrigerater, which has the freezer space above, which is not 
really usable. 
 
The cons of an upright freezer: 
 
The upright freezer owned is a not a frost free freezer.  This means that 
that during the hot and humid days of summer in Texas, you have an 
unreasonable amount of condensation that accumulates on the freon coils that 
are under each shelf.  Anything in the freezer made of something that will 
mildew, will do so.  You cannot store six-pax holders in the freezer for 
this reason, and the bottle lables will end up less than pristine for the 
same reason.  However, if you store your fine cigars in a ziplock baggy on 
the upper shelf, the freezer makes a reasonably good approximation of a 
humidor, at least during the summer months :-)  Once the heat breaks in 
October, condensation is usually not a problem.  The shelves on a 
non-frostfree freezer are fixed because they have coils underneath them.  I 
have read, in the Homebrew Digest, about people bending the coils and 
shelves down to make for more headspace, but each time I decide to attempt 
this project, tommorrow always looks like a better day to start this.  I was 
unable to find a freezer that would allow room for anything except for 
plastic brewing bucket, so at least on a non-frost free freezer, you will 
have to re-engineer to accept upright Corny Kegs. 
 
An upright frost-free freezer eliminates most of the problems mention 
above.  While I do not own one, it is believed that the shelves are 
adjustable.  For this reason, your Corny kegs will easily fit.  You have no 
condensation problems.  You have the extended temperature range that 
refrigerators do not allow.  Unfortunately, they are generally more 
expensive. 
 
Chest type freezers would be a problem for me because bending over at the 
waist to lift 5 gallon containers out would cause back problems. 
 
The pros of a refrigerator: 
 
Almost all of the used ones left on the used market, are are frost free. 
Unless you wish to lager below say 40 F, extended temperature range is not a 
problem.  They are cheap. 
 
The cons of a refrigerator: 
 
The freezer space is wasted. 
 
Conclusion: 
 
Buy a frost free upright freezer, that has adjustable shelves.  You will pay 
more, but you will have a more versatile brewing apparatus.  In fact, I 
would buy one for myself, but my wife is currently watching my homebrewing 
budget very closely :-)

I got a 20 gallon food grade Rubbermaid (tm) 'garbage' can from a

including soaking bottles.  I had intended to make a 20 gal batch of beer

Subject: Gelatin


Homebrewers, 
 I recently read in BYOB that by adding gelatin to secondary 
fermentation you can increase the clarity of the beer. The directions say 
to boil 1/2 to 3/4 of a packet of unflavored gelatin in a cup of water, 
then add it to the carboy. Does this work? Is it worth it? 
 I recently tried this with a stout I brewed, but it's a little 
difficult to see if it worked with a dark stout. 
 
       Thanks in advance,

Subject: Fridge for Kegging


Ok guys, I am planning to convert to kegs in the near future.  SO is having 
major fit about the bottles that are filling the house and wishes me to rid 
our house of these **** things.  Little does she know that kegs will take up 
more room if you include the refrig. 
  Well, I would like any info/ suggestions on how to cool the kegs.  I would 
like to build a bar on one end of my living room to house the fridge and 
kegs along with glasses and other beverages.  Would not like an upright 
fridge in this area, just something small enough for say, three kegs.  Has 
anyone built such a beast?  Have seen the advert for a "beer home" which 
looks about like an old Ice box with the taps on top.  Would you tear the 
guts out of an old fridge and build a new cooler for this application. 
Com'on fess up, someone is smarter than me, tell me about it...Please?

aesoph`at`ncemt1.ctc.com (Aesoph, Michael) asks about sources for large

Back in May I had a discussion Guy McConnell (guym`at`exabyte.com) 
about this.  He sent me the following info

Subject: Too Much HBD


OK, so we'll waste gobs of bandwith decrying the length 
of the HBD. 
 
I for one second this motion, and have decided to be 
hypocritical and waste your time and mine to get some 
issues off of my chest. The fate of my prior message to 
the 'janitor' is unknown, so I offer these comments to all. 
 
I was gone for two weeks and it took me two weeks to 
catch up by one of those two weeks. After two weeks of 
saving each and every HBD I decided to jump ahead to 
see if Al and Dave (and Steve and Tracy) were still at it. 
This is like watching a soap opera - if you miss watching 
a few days you find that you really haven't missed 
anything. 
 
One reader advises that this forum is like a newspaper, 
just page down through items that are not of interest. 
Unfortunately, journalism isn't what it used to be. That 
advice takes the heat off of the contributor to make a 
useful contribution. I say bring back the days of limited 
throughput so people who submit comments have to 
THINK about what they are saying before saying it. 
 
By the way, I have trouble picking up my newspaper 
anymore because so-called journalists have more 
political crap to offer than real news. 
 
Where does this leave us? Well, I for one am beginning 
to question the value of the HBD. After all, I may have time 
to tackle reading all of the reference books on brewing 
in the time I would otherwise spend on this dribble. That 
way I would have more confidence in the information I was 
receiving than much of the heresay that is published here. 
 
I can only suggest that folks show a bit more restraint 
and thought when they post publicly. I personally trust you 
all to work through your differences of opinion (and 
observation) privately so that you can reach concensus 
(or an agreement to disagree), followed up with a summary 
of the pertinent facts, issues, opinions, datapoints, etc that 
you raised with each other prior to the public post. 
 
And now I must apologize for this. Yes, this was extremely 
hypocritical of me. But I offer these comments in the best 
interest of the HBD, and I remain,

Subject: pH Meters


In reference to Esbitter`at`aol.com questions regarding pH meters, it would 
probably be a good idea to store the electrode in a buffer with a pH as 
close to the middle of the range you typically measure as possible. Don't 
store the electrode in dH2O, especially if it is the membrane type. You 
might try Fisher Scientific as one source. Obviously, make sure the 
solution is non-toxic, and rinse well with dH2O before using. If your 
meter can be calibrated, it's probably a good idea to keep some around 
anyway to insure your instrument is working properly. 
 
OK, I guess everyone can get back to such relevant brewing discussions as 
Beer in Spaace. (Geesh, and people are complaining about HBD being too 
long).

Jeff Frane quite accurately states: 
 
>>>>> 
The critical factor in any process is that hops be adequately 
dried, which means *very* low numbers on moisture level (check 
Garetz/Wills and other sources for the numbers).  If the hops are 
not thoroughly dried, 
they will rapidly mold (believe me!) and spoil. 
 
Hops apparently gain in quality from a period of storage; as I 
recall, oxidation in the bale is a necessary step in producing 
good flavor (once again, check a good text, but this was garnered 
from conversations 
with hop growers in the Willamette Valley).  There may be good, 
non-obvious reasons why hops are still dried instead of being 
frozen. 
>>>>>> 
 
In addition to mold decomposition, poor levels of hop oasting can 
also result in that (rapid, rabid?) other form of oxidation -- 
combustion. Hops have quite a high redox potential (read: 
signifcant stored energy), and microbial decomposition has been 
known to lead to smoldering combustion, which then leads to 
flaming combustion, which then leads to end of warehouse.  I 
beleive HopUnion has lost two hop storage facilities to this 
evil.  Also seems that this process is effectively eliminated 
below 10% moisture content (dry weight basis).  Hop bales are 
routinely cored and checked, and if 10% or higher they are broken 
down.  Ideal storage moisture is around 6-8% if memory serves, 
which is unlikley.  It is, however, below ten percent. 
Homebrewers needn't worry much about this though, as baling 
appears to be a requirement for creating microsites capable of 
spontaneous combustion (a process that is quite poorly understood 
from a fire research point of view).  So if you aren't baling 
them things, dry them well anyway and watch for mold.  Interested 
parties are encouraged to search past HBD (late summer 1994) for 
a study of dryhopping fresh vs. dry homegrown hops.  In this 
instance, the dried materials were judged a superior form, albeit 
with some obvious control variable differences other than 
moisture content possibly confounding the (percieved) effects.

Subject: Brewing an ORVAL-/DUVEL-taste-alike


Although I haven't had time to read this outstanding magazine much lately, 
I'm frivolous enough to put forward a question. I spent 10 days in Belgium a 
couple of weeks ago, and tasted over 50 different beers. Most of them are 
not available in Norway, where I live. 
 
I took a special liking in the hoppy trappist ORVAL (I brought with me a 
few), and would like to brew something close. Another hoppy belgian beer I 
would like to imitate is DUVEL. Any recipies? 
 
I'm an extract/specialty grain brewer, and have produced 7 or 8 batches so 
far, most of them good. 
 
BTW, Belgium is really Beer Heaven. Great beers, great cafes. 
 
Thanks in advance,

Greeting everyone, 
 
In this month's copy of the Grew Your Own magazine (August 1996 Vol. 2, 
No.8), there are three different articles on building different 
homebrewing components. 
 
The first is on Draft Box, Keg Jacket and Tombstone Tower. 
The second is on Mash/Lauter Tun. 
And the third is on a Brew Cactus. 
 
I have read the first two so fore but I haven't got to the third 
article yet.

Subject: RE: Pre-Gelatinized Wheat?


In HBD #2111, the subject of unmalted wheat in witbier was 
discussed:

My brewing partner Wendy Aaronson and I had gotten several 
different opinions on this subject when we planned our witbier. 
We finally decided to pre-boil the unmalted wheat and steel-cut 
oats in the hope that it would help with lautering. These grains 
were boiled for about 20 minutes and then added to the mash tun 
along with the requisite pilsner malt. 
 
We also used a 45 minute protein rest at 120 degrees F per the 
recommendations in Phil Seitz's excellent Zymurgy article on 
Belgian brewing. 
 
The result? The wort lautered without a hitch, and the finished 
beer turned out crystal clear! For most other styles, this would 
have been a welcome result, but for an intentionally cloudy beer 
like a wit, it was a bit disconcerting. 
 
Nonetheless, the beer was extremely tasty and ended up taking 1st 
place in Belgian Ales (and 4th Best of Show) at this year's 
Spirit of Free Beer competition (beating out Jim Busch's 
illustrious Esprit de Boire by a hair). 
 
Next time we brew a wit, we'll skip the pre-boiling step and just 
go with a long protein rest. 
 
BTW, I feel the most important variable in brewing a witbier is 
the selection of the coriander. There are many grades on the 
market, so if you can find high-quality, fresh coriander in your 
area, use it instead of the industrial-grade McCormicks brand 
found in nearly every grocery store. 
 
Also, be adventurous and use a good ester-forming Belgian yeast. 
We used La Chouffe, and the aromatics produced by this yeast 
nicely complimented the coriander in the beer.

That's what I did too.  And Laura is write about the bottle sized 
stopper. 
 
I run a 1/4" piece of copper tubing through the stopper, a short 
piece of plastic tubing with a hose clamp, which goes into a copper 
coil.  I've got a bunch of slits drilled in the coiled end with a 
Dremel tool.  I shove the stopper in the hole in the cooler, shove 
the short copper tube through the stopper, fill the cooler with 
sparge water, and open the hose clamp slightly.  I get sparge water 
dripping from my copper coil into the lauter tun. 
 
I'm suprised Phil (TM) or no one has come up with a commercial 
solution the the hole in the cooler.  There is certainly a market 
for something...

Subject: pH and % acidity


Remember the kid who always slept through Chemistry class, and vowed 
he would "never use this stuff anyway"???  Well, now he needs help. 
How do you convert between pH and %acidity?  The reason I'm asking 
this is that I need to monitor the acidity of a mead as it ferments, 
and I would like to just take a quick pH reading instead of titration. 
My references suggest a final pH of about .60%, and that it is best to 
save adjustments until bottling to keep the yeast from being shocked 
(I'm using ale yeast -- not wine yeast).

Subject: ginger


Once again, this is Doug Thomas home wine/mead maker.  For a ginger mead 
I made last year (that turned out strong, but mellowed nicely, so you may 
want to cut back) I used: 
15 oz. fresh chopped ginger root 
10 bulbs of lemon grass, fine chopped 
2 cups of lemon juice 
2 Tbsp. lemon zest 
 
this was for a five gallon batch.  Since it took awhile for the ginger to 
mellow, like I say, you may want to cut back (unless you want one hell of 
a ginger kick) 
BTW: my mead came out with a final alcohol content of 7.5% by weight. 
Hope this helps all ginger lovers.

 I would try using a large plastic bag in any container that will hold the 
bag.  After filling, pitching, and aerating, I would place a sterile cotton 
ball up top and gather the bag around it and tie it closed so that the 
carbon dioxide can escape through the cotton ball.  To rack, I would punch 
or cut a small hole in the bag, insert racking cane, etc.. This would 
minimize any disturbance to the grunge from fermentation.  Might be able to 
use a rubber stopper and airlock for the secondary fermenter if you can rig 
up some way to hold it upright.  Don't know how sterile the new bags are but 
I read somewhere that they are considered fairly sterile.  Would just try it 
and see how it goes. 
 
The main thing going here is CHEAP and easy. Also no cleaning needed, just 
toss when done. No - wait, do not toss yet, use for trash, fill, then toss!

That half filled bottles undercarbonate is no mystery, the added gas 
from priming fermentation will only half the gas per unit volume  to a 
half filled bottle. (See the brewery web site pages on Priming - 
really good technical detail from Mark Hibberd and Dave Draper).

This doesn't correspond w/ my lager experiment posted here around the 
beginning of the year.  I, and later AlK, found that very full bottles 
carbonate much more slowly than normal or underfilled bottles.  Note 
that I'm NOT saying your wrong, just that we have three experiments w/ 
different results.  Al determined that overfilled bottles 
undercarbonate. I strongly suspect that my final carbonation was a bit 
low in overfilled bottles, but not by a very obvious amount. 
 
That overfilled bottles can undercarbonate and carbonate slowly *may* 
be attributable to poor yeast growth at higher pressures.  A known 
effect. Need more experiments here guys.  Perhaps the yeast strain 
used has an effect.  I used Wyeast 2308.. Al ? Brad ?

I doubt the oxidation potential is a big issue with normal fill levels 
and bottle conditioning (I do attempt to eliminate headspace air). 
>From experience, bottle conditioned beer just doesn't oxidise much. 
I suspect that yeast drive the redox potential of the beer toward the 
reduced state, and consume some free oxygen along the way.  How much 
oxygen might yeast reasonably consume in primed beer bottle ? Tracy ? 
 
OTOH bottles filled from kegs w/ various filler apparati do have the 
potential for serious oxidation problems, and I've experienced 
substantial oxidation in such bottles after as little as 4 weeks in a 
fridge. 
 
Commercial breweries back in the 1940-1960 era used to go to great 
lengths to try to eliminate oxygen including adding .25 to .5 Units of 
glucose-oxidase enzyme per ounce of beer.  I suspect HB fillers are no 
better, probably worse than these old bottlers.  Modern commercial 
bottling equipment is more than an order of magnitude better at 
eliminating included oxygen.

Raw wheat and Wit beers 
A quick comment on whether or not to boil/gelatinize wheat for a wit beer. 
Others have commented that it is not necessary and this is correct.  Among 
adjunct grains, wheat is relatively unique in that its gelatinization 
temperature is sufficiently low that it will gelatinize at normal mashing 
temperatures.  There is a table that indicates this in de Clerck's book (or it 
may be the Practical Brewer, I'm playing hooky from work as I write this and 
don't have my books with me). 
 
One other point, the wheat pretty much does turn into cream o' wheat during the
mash and lautering can be a tedious and painful experience. A way to help this 
out is to add a few handfuls of rice hulls at mash out. I now use this as part 
of
my SOP when I brew with wheat and it works great.
