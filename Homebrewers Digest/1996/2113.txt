There are "roadmaps" available that show different micros around the 
country.  I think they are called Coops Guides or something.  You chould 
be able to find a northeast edition. 
 
Based on personal travels, try the Vermont Pub and Brewery in 
Burlington.  There are also a couple of micros in Amherst, Mass.  I have 
never been , but I hear the Catamount Brewery in VT is nice.  Of course 
you have Sam Adams in Bean Town. 
 
If you contact the AHA, they will fax you a list of micros for a particular 
state. I think (but am not totally positive) that they have that info on their 
homepage  (I don't know their URL, but you can access the AHA from my 
homebrew clubs page at 
http://www.dimensional.com/~godbey/louthan.html 
 
I was in Ottowa last month, and don't recall any breweries there, but I 
was only there for a day and a half. 
 
Good luck!

Yes, Guinness and vanilla ice cream work very well together, 
but there's an even better way. Try it with Mackeson's stout. 
 
Fred Eckhardt used this at the beer & chocolate tasting he 
conducted at the AHA conference in Manchester NH a number of 
years ago: 
 
    A chocolate brownie at the bottom of a tall glass. 
    A scoop of vanilla ice cream on the brownie. 
    Fill the glass with Mackeson's, then use a long spoon. 
 
I've used this at tastings I've conducted several times (thanks, Fred!) 
and it has always been met with wild acclaim.

Subject: Beer Fridge


Hi All, 
 
With all the talk of beer fridge making, I thought I'd pipe in my 
$0.02.  When I got into kegging, I perused the restaurant salvage 
stores for stuff. I happened upon a guy who had 2 beer fridges. These 
are roughly 30 wide by 30 deep by 36 high and fit 4 cornys  perfectly. 
Being made for serving beer, it already had a tap column on it. 
Works great, and I am saving up for a multi-tap column. They list 
for over $700 new from a place like RAPIDS, but mine was used and 
a little dirty, but only cost $225. Best money I ever spent. 
In Detroit, there are a number of used restaurant supply places 
on Gratiot Ave, near the Eastern Market. 
 
Scour those salvage places!

Hello all, I have two questions: 
 
1)  I'm a graduate student and beginning (all extract/specialty grain ....so 
far!!) homebrewer.  My degree will be in Cell Biology but I'm working in 
yeast genetics (that's how I got interested in homebrewing, I'll be trying 
some lab strains in my brews!!)  :=).  I would love to try and find a job in 
the microbrew industry when I graduate and was wondering if anyone in this 
forum had any ideas how I could find some info on this.  I'm going to tour 
the various microbreweries in my state (Vermont, GREAT beers here IMO), and 
will try to talk to the people who run them and work there.  I'm also 
reading up on the industry as much as I can.  If there's anything else I can 
be doing, I'll do it!! 
 
2) here's a homebrewing question: I've got a maple wine in the secondary 
right now ( 1.5 qt grade B medium amber syrup per gallon  OG 1.12, SG on 
racking 1.005) which I fermented with champagne yeast (2months primary,  2.5 
months secondary so far and I haven't taken a FG yet).  It has in the past 3 
weeks stopped fermenting and the liquid in my airlock has stabilized.  It's 
crystal clear and not too much sediment, tastes good but pretty harsh yet. 
I know I have to age this but I can't decide whether to bottle now (I want 
it sparkling so I'll add priming sugar and fresh yeast), or to leave it in 
the secondary for a few more weeks/months and then bottling.  Are there any 
opinions on this or should I flip a coin??? 
 
Thanks!!

Wasn't there a post quite a while back about not storing beer in the 
basements of new houses for a period of time (5 years?)?  It was due of a 
chemical either in the concrete of the basement walls, or something they 
used to treat it.  I had a friend brew for the first time in a new house 
(before I read the post), and his beer had a distinct 'off' flavor.  Also, 
it was different from any of the usual beer beasties.  Does this have any 
bearing on what Father Barleywine wants to do?

Subject: Infusion only wor all grain wheat?


All, 
I plan on doing an all grain wheat brew. I am concerned if a single 
infusion `at`~155 degrees for 1 hour will work with all that wheat. I am 
new to all-grain brewing (one batch). Here is the grain bill. 
 
5# Gambrinus Premium 2-Row Malt 
 
1# Gambrinus "Light" Munich 
 
6# Great Western Winter Wheat Malt 
 
I will be adding some freshly picked blackberries to the secondary. 
Would ~2# be enough to give this a light (not heavy or overpowering) but 
perceivable taste? 
 
Any advice is welcome. email if fine.

Subject: gelatin


Hello there! 
In winemaking, gelatin (about 3 grams dissolved in 1 cup water per 5 
gallons to be cleared) does great.  The only thing is that it 
reacts/bonds/clings to tannin, which is desirable in reds.  As far a beer 
goes, I would guess it does the same thing.  Bonding with tannin from the 
husks, and then getting heavier than the surrounding liquid and falling 
out of suspension.  If you try this, stir the gelatin in well and then 
let it sit for a week. 
hope this helps

Subject: Gelatin as a clarifier, kegging question


     Daniel wrote in asking about using gelatin to clarify a stout.  He 
     says that he boiled it.  DON'T DO THIS!  Just heat it to ~160F and 
     hold a few minutes, than add it to the beer. 
 
     Also, you really don't have to bother clarifying a stout (or any other 
     dark, opaque styles).  As you observed, you can't tell anyway! 
 
     Next, a question:  Does anybody dispense beer from kegs at "proper" 
     temperatures (50-55F)? I've read all about 
     pressure-drop-per-length-of-tubing, etc., and calculated that I needed 
     31 FEET of hose to dispense ale `at` 55F and 28-30 psi. 
 
     I tried it, and STILL had foaming problems.  Thinking that the 
     formulas from "Zymurgy" made some assumptions that didn't fit my 
     equipment, I reduced the pressure a bit and was able to eliminate the 
     foam, but there were no visible bubbles in the beer (one or two 
     glasses were OK, which confused me more!). 
 
     My friends were quite amused by the 31' of tubing, and laughed harder 
     when it didn't help (until they realized it would take them 5 min. to 
     pour a beer!). 
 
     I ran the line (1/4" vinyl tubing) through a cooler filled with ice 
     water so that it wouldn't warm up on its voyage to the glass. 
 
     I've noticed that draft beer at many bars is devoid of visible 
     bubbles, too.  Am I chasing windmills here?  Can you pour a bubbly 
     glass from a keg, or should I just be happy there's no foam? 
 
     When I counter-pressure bottle these beers at the same pressure, the 
     carbonation is perfect, but I really would like to drink straight from 
     the keg once in a while!

Subject: substitute for invert sugar


Hello HBDers, 
 
The following will be of interest to those of you who brew recipes that 
call for invert sugar. 
 
400 g of honey may be used as a substitute for each 300 g of invert sugar. 
 
Invert sugar is sucrose (also known as cane sugar, beet sugar, or table 
sugar) which has been chemically broken down into its two component simple 
sugars glucose and fructose.  When I learned this recently, it made me 
remember that honey contains glucose and fructose.  I was able to find a 
book that lists the chemical composition of honey.  The book was old, but 
I'd bet that the percentages listed below haven't changed much over the last 
100 million years or so.  The following is an excerpt from the book "Honey 
and Health" by B.F. Beck (Robert M. McBride and Company, New York, 1938). 
 
   "The main chemical components of honey (in percentages) are: 
 
 
        Invert sugars .............. 73.31   (dextrose, 36.20) 
                                             (levulose, 37.11) 
        Sucrose (cane-sugar) .......  2.63 
        Dextrin ....................  2.89 
        Nitrogen substances ........  1.08 
        Water ...................... 18.96 
        Ash ........................  0.24 
 
   These component parts vary in different honeys." 
 
 
Dextrose and levulose are commonly used names for glucose and fructose, 
respectively.  The term "ash" refers to residual inorganic matter (e.g. 
salts, minerals), and I would guess that "nitrogen substances" are primarily 
proteins. 
 
Luckily, honey contains glucose and fructose in roughly equal proportions 
(as is the case in invert sugar), so for our purposes as homebrewers, honey 
is essentially invert sugar diluted with water.  Use 4 parts of honey (by 
weight) for each 3 parts of invert sugar called for in your recipes. 
 
Oh, the disclaimer:  I think honeybees are cute, but I have no personal 
affiliation with the honey-producing industry.  Just a satisfied customer, 
etc. ;^)

Yes.  The White Rubbermaid "Brute" trash bins are FDA approved for food. 
I foolishly ordered two from Cole-Parmer for about $25 each and when they 
came, I realized that they were exactly the same as the white trash bins 
at the local hardware store.  I don't know about the coloured ones or square 
ones, but the round, white, HDPE "Brute" bins are FDA-approved for food 
and it's probably stamped on the bottom somewhere.  It may alternatively 
say NSF-approved... I'm not sure... I'm here and my bins are at home. 
 
Michael continues: 
>5 gallons at a time just doesn't cut it anymore - 
>especially for wine, which ties up a fermenter for 6 weeks or so. 
 
Hmmm... 6 weeks... I don't know if I would want to use these bins for 
any fermentable that long (although I kept my pLambic in one of my 20-gal 
Brutes for 3-months, but what works for pLambic usually doesn't work for 
any other beverage).  The lid seals very poorly (even with the weather- 
stripping I affixed inside the lid) and I'm quite certain the alcohols 
will oxidize quite readily.  There is also the issue of oxygen-permiability, 
which is quite high in HDPE (but these containers are nearly 1/4" thick, 
so the lid leaks are really the issue). 
 
Incidentally, you can forget about drilling a hole for an airlock.  Even 
with the self-adhesive weatherstripping there was so much leakage that 
15 gallons of fermenting beer didn't move the airlock. 
 
*** 
I've been holding off posting about this "Heart of the Hops" thing 
expecting that the person who told me about it would post, but perhaps 
he's too busy or doesn't want to continue the thread.  There has been 
a lot of speculation about what this "Heart of the Hops" is and I can 
assure you that this information is almost as accurate as it gets (it is 
second hand from a person who toured the Miller Brewery). 
 
The "Heart of the Hops" is what's left of whole Galena flowers once most 
of the bitter resins have been removed for use in Miller's other beers. 
The reason they use this hop extract in stead of whole hops is because 
it must be first processed so that the resulting beer doesn't skunk 
(remember... they use clear bottles for several of their beers).  Try it. 
You can't skunk Miller High Life using light of any kind. 
 
What's left of the hops after extracting most of the bitterness is used 
in the new Miller Beer (with the red label).  They have to use 4 times 
the hops because there's only a fraction of the bitterness left.

Didn't forget it... I wrote only about the breweries that I've *been* to. 
I faintly recall something about Anchor using positive pressure with 
filtered air in their fermentation room which probably makes a difference 
wrt sanitation worries.  It would be good if someone could confirm this 
just for compleatness. 
 
Also, Spencer told me via private email that Bell's has cleaned up their 
act.  If it's in your budget, perhaps you could even visit Bell's and 
find out how they solved their problems.

Food grade garbage can ? I doubt it.  Your beer may end up tasting of 
plasticiser. 
 
A local 'junk' store sells used plastic barrels (~31gal I believe) 
used to ship fruit juice, mostly apple for about $10.  Typically they 
have 2 - 2" plastic screw-on bungs on the top (and they throw in 
some juice and wild yeast for free ;^) .  Be certain they're from a 
food application, since the same type barrels are also used for 
shipping chemicals and fertlizer. 
 
Some farm/shop supply places also sell plastic containers meant to 
hold potable water.  Northern Hydraulics and Grainger come to mind as 
likely sources. 
 
I'd look for one of these.

Subject: bottle fill level


 
collective homebrew conscience: 
 
just my contribution on the discussion regarding bottle fill levels and 
rate of/lack of/ carbonation. 
 
i have experienced slow and low carbonation from fill levels that could be 
considered high, probably about 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch from the top. 
 
i purposely started leaving about an inch of headspace in my homebrews, and 
voila! - no more problems. 
 
i should point out that none of the high fill level hb's were flat, just 
lower carbonation/ lower rate of carbonation.  the bottles that sat for 
4 or 5 months eventually came around, but i'm still debating whether they've 
come around to the same degree as the beers that were filled lower. 
 
i brewed 21 5 gallon batches between oct. and may, so there was plenty of 
"test material" so to speak.  or write. whatever. 
 
i should also point out that none of any of these beers have ever exhibited 
problems with oxidation.  all are bottle conditioned. 
 
brew hard, men.

Subject: Ground Ivy instead of Hops


 
Last summer a friend of mine was involved in a research study of the common 
weed known as Creeping Charlie, or Ground Ivy.  He stumbled upon several 
references claimimg that this herb can be used to brew beer. 
 
So I did a little research. 
 
It turns out that before hops were introduced to England, ales were being 
bittered by various wild herbs, including ground ivy, also known as gill- 
over-the-ground, cat's foot, robin-in-the-hedge, alehoof, alecost, field balm. 
The plant grows low to the ground, with fan-like leaves, and "creeps" along 
by sending out stolons, quickly populating your lawn.  Its taste 
has been described as very bitter, somewhat minty, and has been used 
traditionally to make a bitter tea, as well as having uses as a folk medicinal 
herb and in beer. 
 
MY goal is to try and brew up a batch of a traditional English ale bittered 
with ground ivy, in hopes of reproducing a beer with some historical 
accuracy. 
 
According to _Wines and Beers of Old New England_ by Sanborn C. Brown:  "It 
takes one half peck of fresh plants to make an ounce of dried 
leaves. Gathering them is easy, since you can usually find a lush 
patch where you can reach down and pull up the plants by the 
handful.  They break off easily from their roots so that what you get 
is clean.  Separating the dried leaves from the runners is much more 
time consuming (and boring).  Allow yourself several hours to pick 
over your dried weeds to get the one ounce of leaves you need for a 
ground ivy substitute for hops in the standard [5 gal.?] beer recipe (p.66)." 
 
Has anyone out there made beer with ground ivy??  How did it turn out?  Please 
let me know any suggestions, etc.  How different were ales in, say, the 
fourteenth centuury?  Hopefully not TOO different, because soon I plan to 
brew an extract batch of some standard English "Bitter" (probably Papazian's 
Righteous Real Ale) replacing hops with Minnesota-grown ground ivy from my 
back yard! 
 
I'll keep you all posted as to the results....

Subject: fridge vs. freezer


 Jay Williams <jayw7`at`airmail.net> reported on the pros and cons of 
a converted refridgerator vs. a freezer. 
 
First, realize that it is difficult to use the same device for fermenting 
in and for serving from.  Fermentation temperature can often be 
too warm or too cold for serving beer, even if you have the room 
for cornys and carboys. 
 
That said, Jay remarks: 
>The pros of a refrigerator: 
> 
>Almost all of the used ones left on the used market, are are frost free. 
>Unless you wish to lager below say 40 F, extended temperature range is not a 
>problem. 
 
Below 40 is usually easy to get with the refridgerator's own thermostat.  Use 
a thermometer in a jar of water and some experimentation. 
 
Another pro is that, if you're planning to run a CO2 line into the fridge, 
you can often pull off the peg from the inside wall which held the shelves 
up.  You don't need the shelves anymore, so pull off that peg and drill 
a small hole in the outer wall with a drill.  Put a piece of 1/4" OD copper 
tubing through the hole you drilled.  Now you can run a line from the 
regulator to the copper tubing, and then from the copper tubing to a 
manifold inside the fridge.  Then run lines to each keg.  Just check 
all those hose clamps well. 
 
>The cons of a refrigerator: 
> 
>The freezer space is wasted. 
Unless you're serving real ales, you can generally keep the fridge cold 
enough to keep the freezer compartment below freezing.  Good for 
storing hops and even that extra chicken that won't fit in the kitchen 
freezer. 
 
One con may be that, if you're planning to install tap handles on the 
door, you have to put them rather low on the door. Otherwise, when 
you open the freezer door, you'll hit the handles and douse your 
shoes with your prized IPA. 
 
****** 
One other thing.  I was at McDonalds the other day for a drink 
and the people were refilling the shake machine.  They opened 
the doors at the bottom of the machine and low and behold but 
there appeared little kegs!  They looked to be about a gallon or 
two, with two ball-lock fittings.  McDs uses these kegs to hold 
the shake flavorings.  They had a wide opening at the top like 
Corny kegs.  It would be great if there was a way to get one or 
two of these things.

Another solution may be demijohns (sp?) available at some homebrew stores. 
They are big (approx 15 gallon) glass carboys that once held something 
else. Most come with a plastic basket arrangement to make it possible to 
move them around. The last place I saw some was at Highlanders homebrew in 
Littleton CO, but I've seen them other places in the past.

Interesting disagreement. I wonder WHY our observations are different? And, 
what
do you mean by "much slower" carbonation? Twice as long? More? 
 
>That overfilled bottles can undercarbonate and carbonate slowly *may*

I used WY-1007 for the experiment I reported, but use a variety of WY lager and
ale yeasts for my 'high fill' beers, and have never noted a problem in 
carbonation. Steve (or others), do you think the pressure is going to vary 
between bottles with head space differences in the 'normal' range, say between 
two and 1/4 inches (data anywhere)? My intuition (read, no data) says no. If 
pressure is not the factor which caused your (but not my) observed correlation 
between fill level and carbonation, do you have any other ideas to explain your
observations?  Time to drink a beer and think about this.

Attention people interested in becoming beer judges who 
live in Northern California: 
 
I have started the process of scheduling a BJCP exam for mid 
January 1997.  If anyone is interested in taking it then, 
please drop me a line.  If you don't think you are ready 
please contact me anyway, my club (Worts of Wisdom) will be 
doing some prep classes.  There should be no problem getting 
ready by then.

You've got to look into the Atlanta Brewing Company, makers of Red Brick 
Ale.  Located in downtown Atlanta they give personal tours on request and 
samples in the sample room.  Their flagship product Red Brick Ale is 
definately on of my most favorite micorbrews (even if it is filtered.) 
 
My wife and I visited there last summer with a few friends and they 
treated us like royalty.  I called the day before and asked for a tour, 
really just on a whim, and they were more than glad to set us up the next 
day. 
 
I can't say enough about their Red Brick (no financial connections just a 
staisfied, blah, blah) Ale, it has a flavor that I have yet to come close 
to duplicating in my homebrews, and I have tried. 
 
If anybody out there in the collective knows of a recipe approximating Red 
Brick please post me a note.

        I have had very sucessful results with gelatine in my secondary, 
but I don't boil it! I've been told that boiling it will ruin the 
properties that it has as far as a clearing agent. I boil water, take the 
pot off the element, put in the gelatine, and dissolve it completely. I 
then add it to my filled carboy. 
        I tried this on a all-grain wheat beer that had about 55% malted 
wheat, and 10% flaked wheat. The beer was so clear, it looked like a 
Bohemian Pils! 
My usual clearing technique involves using irish moss at the end of the 
boil, gelatine in the carboy if I think it will need it, a long stay in the 
secondary, and then a long stay in the beer fridge to let the chill haze 
drop out. I never have a problem with "unclear" beer. 
        If I do, I close my eyes and drink it faster. :-P
