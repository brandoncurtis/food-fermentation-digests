>> 
Can anyone recommend a better way to store a pH meter so that I get more 
than 6 months from the new electrode? Is 6 months only what I should 
expect? Do any of you have better solutions to taking pH readings for 
brewing? (better brands, better papers, better ways to care for the 
electrode...) 
<< 
 
I did some research when I was in the market for a hand-held PH meter. 
My findings led me back to the pH papers I've always used: colorpHast. 
pH meters are apparently notorious for being fickle and most of the 
reasonably priced ones ($75 or so) have a accuracy of only +/-.1.  Not 
very good for the price and hassle involved in a meter (IMO). The 
colorpHast papers come in two ranges - I use the pH 4.0-7.0. With a 
little practice, one can achieve almost the same accuracy as the above 
mentioned meters.  They're pricey ($15 for 100 strips) and not readily 
available (I get mine from Brewer's Resource 1-800-827-3983 - no 
affiliation) but I like 'em.  And no messy electrode to store!

Perhaps I should be clearer....it LOOKS like a garbage can, it is made of 
the same stuff as Rubbermaid style tupperwear.  It is used by restaurants 
to hold everything from tomato sauce to iced tea.

Thought I would give an all-grain attempt, so I was fortunate enough(it 
wasn't easy) to find a couple of 5 gallon pickle buckets(very very kosher 
from the smell !)  I have had them soaking with up to 3 cups of bleach mixed 
up with water and still can't get the smell out ! 
Anyone run into this problem ?   Any help would be appreciated, thanx.

I had a chance recently to visit some breweries in St. Petersburg, Russia. 
Particularly the Vienna (BEHA) brewery.  Their mash vessels and 
boilers were made from cast concrete, and although they didn't 
make exactly award winning (or even very good) beer, the concrete 
wasn't a health risk.  It definately contributes off flavors and 
the fact that both Vienna and Stephan-Raziu breweries had fermentors 
made of pot iron (i.e. rusty) contributed more to the beers off flavors. 
 
Making due with concrete seemed to be common in breweries functioning 
under the former Soviet rule.

 Does anyone out there know where one can locate large, food grade, 
plastic containers that could be used as a fermenter?  By large I mean 
10-20 gallons or so..  5 gallons at a time just doesn't cut it anymore - 
 
especially for wine, which ties up a fermenter for 6 weeks or so.

Run to your phone and dial 1-800-537-9724 and ask them to send you a

                "The Jethro Gump Report" 
Wheeler's Porter History- 
        I have had a few responses to Graham Wheeler's blasphemous analysis 
of the history of Porter....(in this politically correct age, do I call it 
'de-construction?, no, actually, I think it's merely "addition")...but the 
thing sort of completes the circle for me and fills in where others have 
begun, and by their own word's elaborated....  "...I am certain that 
somewhere out there is some definitive piece of evidence as to the true 
nature of porter in it's original form, and that it will come to light 
immediately after this book is published. If you are the one to find this 
brewer's version of the "Philosopher's Stone", please pass it on to me 
immediately!" (Foster) It also elaborates on another definition of "Mild." I 
haven't yet read the last Zymurgy's Porter article, but judging from the 
private responses...this is different. 
        This is to, in no way, diminish my respect for Terry Foster. His was 
one of the first books on brewing that I bought, and I would be VERY pleased 
to meet him and say so....but like I said...Wheeler's info seems spot on to 
me.... 
        I spoke to Graham today and have received his permission, as well as 
that of the publisher of "Homebrew Today", Evelyn Barrett, to re-print the 
text in the HBD...but it is long and I hesitate to put it out, for fear of 
alienating the collective with it's length....(9K).. so, I will leave it up 
to you, the collective...say so and I will put it on the HBD...say no, and I 
won't....private responses appreciated...but I think it is pertinent and 
that you would enjoy it....it may even change your approach to brewing 
porter...it certainly has me thinking about the next batch!! 
 
Plastics- 
        Someone asked about various sources for plastic vessels for 
brewing.... and on the same day I received my latest copy of the cattle-dog 
from "U.S. Plastics," 1-(800)-537-9724. These folks have the BEST catalog 
(not as comprehensive as Grainger, but, who is?) of plastic vessels, 
tubings, safety products, valves, pumps, mixers, hoses, castings, rods, 
totes, shelving...etc...and the nice thing is the "Chemical Resistance Data" 
chart they have put in the back, so that you know exactly what it will and 
won't tolerate....They even have some nice stainless bits...including one 
VERY nice, and expensive stainless version of the Zapap lauter inner bucket! 
In 2 different perforation sizes, too! Jethro has never bought from them, 
but they do offer a 100 % satisfaction guarantee...or a refund, etc, ... 
 
Al K.- 
        Have tried to return your posts...but your server won't let 
me...what's up?

perpetuate the myth that boiling somehow anihilates "the heart of the 
gelatin". 
 
Once and for all, please, gelatin is made by BOILING collagen FOR HOURS. 
It is fully denatured. Everything that can happen to it has already 
happened.

Subject: Burners


 
I am living overseas for a couple of years.  I recently purchased a 10 gallon 
pot and Gott setup to start all grain brewing.  Over the weekend I was at a 
friends house and we brewed an extract IPA.  I also have my new wort chiller, 
so we did a full boil.  It took forever to boil 5 gallons, yet alone 7. 
my dilemma is that I want to brew soon.  My local gas store has (2) burners. 
One is 6 kW and the other 11.6.  According to my Machinery's Handbook that is 
roughly 20,500 BTU's and 39,600 BTU's.  I could convert them when I come home, 
but my concern is when I put the European regulator on my American grill, it 
nearly burned the grill up because it was regulated at a higher pressure.  My 
concern is that the opposite will happen.  I will go down in heating ability 
when I return to the states and put an American regulator on it.  Also there 
seems to be no flow valve on these. 
1.  I assume the King Kooker, etc. have control valves, correct? 
2.  Can I cook without a control valve? 
3.  Is 20,000 BTU's/6 kW enough heat for the occasional brewer (once every 
    month or two)? 
4.  Should I buy the cheap one for now in Europe and get a better one when I 
    return to America?

Subject: Large fermenters, Anchor and positive pressure


In an HBD far, far away (hbd1832), Dave in Indy had some info on 
larger fermenters.  Here's what he had to say: 
 
                In looking through the current (1995 #1) 
                catalog from US Plastics, I saw what I think to be 
                a new offering: conical bottom medium-size tanks! 
                This shape makes a great potential fermenter (see 
                discussions earlier this year in HBD).  The only 
                "bad" news is the smallest size is 15gal.  The details 
                FYI follow...15gal tank made of medium density poly- 
                ethylene, FDA approved for water use, 60 degree 
                sloped conical section, 2" FPT bottom outlet, a 
                10" top opening "positive locking fillwell" (sealing 
                is a question to ask them!).  Cost is ONLY $62!!! 
                Also comes in 30gal and larger sizes.  This is almost 
                enough to make me scale up!  US Plastics, (800) 537-9724

Yes, Anchor uses positive pressure via filtered air in their 
fermentation rooms.  I specifically asked this question during the 
tour.  Their large, shallow open fermenters are something to behold. 
Of course, the whole brewery is something to behold, and the tasting 
sessions at the end of the tour are truly memorable.

After 30 years of home brewing I can't believe the stupidity of the 
conversation regarding priming a batch of beer. 
What don't you understand? 
All you do is dump 1 cup of corn sugar (OR 3/4 CUP OF CANE SUGAR) into a 5 
gallon batch and it carbonates!

Fellow Brewers,

is one of my favorites and one of the most frequently repeated.  I have = 
never seen the "reason."  Can someone tell me why we can NEVER boil the = 
gelatine?  It didn't come from my mom, she always boiled the Jello (tm) = 
and it never failed. =20 
 
My other favorite is that we can NEVER boil the wort covered.  Is there =

more vigorous boil covered, without a boil over (big pot).  Isn't that =

don't like "always" and "never" without substantiation. 
 
Thanx for all the good advice in the past and thanks for allowing my =

for the down arrow, or in emergencies, the delete button.

At 155 dF you will get full conversion in less than an hour. If I were 
doing this brew I would plan 1 hour at closer to 150 dF (65 dC) to produce 
a lighter mouthfeel, but that's personal taste. Malted wheat has very high 
enzyme levels, so conversion is never a problem. It also has no hulls, so 
stuck runoff can be a problem with high percentages of malted wheat in the 
grist bill. Your 50/50 should cause no problems. I have never had a 
problem at 60% wheat. Above that I use oat hulls in the mash, just in 
case.

Your analysis is correct if you discount the flavor and aroma effects of 
honey. Many recipes which lend themselves to the use of invert sugar would 
not fare well with a healthy dollop (say, 1lb or more) of honey thrown in. 
 
Making invert sugar is very easy. Dissolve 1 pound of cane sugar in 1/4 
cup of water in a stainless steel or enamel pot. Warm until syrupy, then 
add 1/8 teaspoon tartaric acid and heat a few minutes until light golden. 
Do not boil. [source: Zymurgy,Vol 17, No. 1, Spring 1994, "How Sweet It Is 
- - Brewing With Sugar" by Jeff Frane. 
 
NOTE: If you continue to heat the syrup (do not boil) it will get 
progressively darker which may be desireable in some recipes for brown 
beers. Also, Lyle's Golden Syrup, available locally in both Super Markets 
and Homebrew shops, is simply invert sugar.

I hate to see these comments. They reflect a limited knowledge of beer 
styles, many of which are considered "world class" yet have little or no 
perceptible hop bitterness. As for Miller Beer, I think it may lead the 
pack for this style. I don't drink it regularly, 'cause I don't care for 
the style, but if I did, I think Miller Beer would be my choice.

Subject: Herbal Flavorings -- Has Anyone Tried...?


OK, Summer's dragging on and I've been brewing up a lot of standard 
old pale ales and Bavarian weiss.  Suddenly I get this stupid 
urge to get creative.  My homegrown herbs are full and fat. 
 
So, I'm thinking of taking a 5 gal batch of a simple light 
ale, low hopping; splitting it to 2-5 secondaries and 
experimenting with a gallon or two of various fresh-herbed 
ales.  The old stand-by of jalepenos just seems a bit too 
common.  A few of the things I've considered putting into 
the mix, alone or in combination, are horseraddish, dill (Maybe 
with some cucumber too -- beer and a pickle in a glass?), 
rosemary, sage, mustard, and basil. 
 
Anyone had any experience putting any of these (or anything 
else really unique) into an ale? 
 
Should I have any concerns with killing or suppressing the yeast 
(do these fella's like spicy food?) 
 
Any advice or experience would be welcome.  Private e-mail 
between us freak-brewers if you prefer.

- ----------------------------------- 
Dan, I read this too, and have used it both in secondary, and in other cases 
at bottling time. The gelatine does seem to add some clarity. One thing I've 
noted is that after bottling, wait a day and twist the bottles back and 
forth a bit. It seems the gelatine particles settle sometimes on the side of 
Grolsch type bottles. On the other hand, I've also used isinglas and found 
it to be a better clarifier, and in many cases, additional clarity is not 
needed if the yeast settles out well. Good luck either way.

   I believe that was in reference to a fungus or bacteria that lives in soil 
and emerges when the soil is disturbed.  I have a randomly occuring similar 
problem in my brew-basement; only half of the basement is floored, the other 
half is bare earth sometimes below the water table.  The infections I get do 
strange things to my beer, like funny colors, green apple vinegar etc. even 
when I use a large starter and get very fast startups.  The really curious 
thing is that if I throw another batch of wort ontop of the dregs from one of 
these bad batches the resulting brew turns out fine (it was an accident, 
don't ask).

Thanks to one and all for your responses.   In general, use ice cream, 
malted milk, and your favorite stout -- mix slowly and/or a little at a 
time.  Like/dislike responses were mixed.  Also in the movie Cannery Row, 
starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger, Nick orders one at a .  Also, I 
will try one next time in B'ham. 
 
On the subject of Atlanta Brewpubs ... there are 3 located in Buckhead: 
John Harvards, Atlanta Beergarten, and one opening 7/20, Cherokee 
Brewing (located about 3 blocks north of the other 2 on Roswell Road). 
There is also one in Athens, don't know the name.  Other than 
that, there are several fine bars that serve many micros.  Taco Mac, 3-4 
locations, has the largest selection.

        Have seen the advert for a "beer home" which

        I used to build wine cellars for a living.  One of my most popular 
items was a portable cellar that we built using the guts from one of those 
little office fridges.  I believe one could be built into a keg cooler 
using about the same techniques we did building the wine cellars. 
        The metal located around the freezer compartment is actually the 
cooling unit.  We housed it in a false top and ventilated into the main 
compartment with a small computer fan.  Make sure the cabinet is very well 
insulated.  Because of the weather stripping, getting doors to close tight 
enough was a major problem.  I think if I were to do it again I would build 
something using brass ice box hardware which is available from specialty 
woodworking suppliers such as the Wood Workers Store or Woodcraft supply. 
They have a very positive closing latch. 
 
>>>>> 
The "Heart of the Hops" is what's left of whole Galena flowers once most 
of the bitter resins have been removed for use in Miller's other beers. 
The reason they use this hop extract in stead of whole hops is because 
it must be first processed so that the resulting beer doesn't skunk 
(remember... they use clear bottles for several of their beers).  Try it. 
You can't skunk Miller High Life using light of any kind. 
<<<<< 
 
        I wondered why miller wouldn't skunk.  I recall a thread not long 
back where the consensous was that Heineken and Mickey's must intentionally 
skunk their beer as even new from sealed case bottles have the taste. 
        Is it possible that they are using UV sterilizers to cold 
pastureize their beer?  From my understanding of the issue, skunking is 
caused by exposure to UV light. 
        Can anyone shed...er.. more light on the subject?

Subject: Full Boil


Hi All, 
 I've switched to a ten gallon system and am having 
a difficult time achieving a good boil on my converted keg brewpot. 
It takes 30-45 minutes to get the wort to simmer and another 30-45 
minutes to bring it to a full boil.  Do I have to wait for the full 
boil to add my bittering hops and start timing or is it OK to begin 
when after it starts to simmer?  Also, the reason the boil is so slow 
is that my system is partially automated and I'm using a seloniod 
H2O heater valve to control the gas to my burner.  The problem with 
the valve is it can only take 1/2 psi without destroying it which only 
give me 30,000-35,000 btu's on my 135,000 btu burner.  Does anyone know 
of a way to overcome this? 
 
Thanks,

Subject: Removing haze from flaked barley batch


Need help. 
 
Background: My last batch grain bill was 10# 2-row Klages, 1/4# flaked barley, 
1oz. roasted barley. My brew day was tight on time, so I did a single infusion 
w/ sac. temp of 159F for 60 minutes.  I know, I know! I should have done a 
protein rest, but time wasn't on my side that day, and the single infusion 
allowed me to do other things during the mash. 
 
The good news:  OG (fermenter) 1.050 / 6 gal.;  fermented w/ Wyeast 1335 (my 
new favorite ale yeast) at 68F for 8 days in primary down to SG=1.014. This is 
the target SG I was shooting for (012-015 range).  Now sitting in a secondary 
at 68F, and it tasted great - hoppy, w/ a big "chewy", bread-y malty beer 
taste.
 
The bad news:  Haze.  Not just chill haze (but I'm sure it'll get worse when 
cold), but major haze even at 68F. Some seems to have settled since racking to 
secondary 5 days ago.  But still has that "muddy" look when I do the penlight 
test. 
 
The question:  I usually do a protein rest, and have good clarity (using same 
yeast - it's a great floc'r).  But since I did things the "wrong" way, what is 
the best remedy for the secondary to reduce the haze to an acceptable amount? 
I'm pretty certain it isn't yeast or starch, but most likely to be big 
proteins. I've read about papain and Polyclar in several books, but have never 
used either.  I knew going into this batch that flaked barley can cause haze 
problems, so it's usually used only in porters.  But I like to experiment, and 
1/4# flaked barley didn't seem like a large amount for a pale ale.  The last 
time I had a batch this cloudy in the secondary it was from 3# of  mango pulp, 
and pectic enzyme cured it w/ amazing results (after gelatine was tried to no 
avail), so I'm optimistic that there is a magic bullet for this batch too. 
 
Any advice / experience with either fining? My concern w/ papain is the effect 
it will have on the big body the batch seems to have.  Will it go too far and 
make the beer seem "watery"?  I understand that Polyclar precipitates out 
tannins, but I'm not so sure that this is the problem.  Is the best answer to 
try BOTH?  When best to use these?  Is it worth the time and expense? Is a 
stoneware mug the only answer?  Can we make a new AHA category for "Haze Ale"?
