It's the only way I drink my beer,except for a few grolsch bottles for 
compititions. I use a 2.5 gal "Beer Machine(TM)" keg, plastic with CO2 bulb 
pressurizing and a tap at the bottom with a fiter on the intake.

works great keeps batch fresh for months ( rarely takes that long to finish 
;-) 
I pressurize the keg and prime it with corn sugar at "bottling time", chill 
for a week 
and drink great carbonated, good head, no extra foam down to the last dregs. 
I don't know how to fix your problem george, but I'm thinking of getting a 
couple 
of corny kegs for my new/old beer fridge. Just adding to the bandwidth.

Actually, Ed, the beer Fred used in Manchester was Blackwell Stout from the New
Haven Brewing Company. It's a fairly 'light' stout, being only slightly roasty 
and not quite opaque.  It's a wonderful beer though, and went very well with 
the ice cream and the brownie. 
 
I've tried using Mackeson's but didn't care for it as much.  I can't recall 
exactly why now, but it may have been too sweet, or it tasted odd due to the 
lactose.  But to each his own.  Regardless, everyone should try this.  It's a 
great way to gross out your friends, until they actually taste it.

I didn't respond to the poll.  But one of the best beers I've made was 
brewed in July.  I am amazed it didn't get infected: 
 
* We brewed outside on a 100 degree day. 
* It rained (POURED) while we were boiling. 
* The hop pellets clogged the screen in the boiling kettle, and we had 
  to "bail" the beer into the fermenter using a plastic measuring cup! 
 
It turned out to be probably the best Pilsner I've made to date 
(although my brew partner's half of the batch did get infected.)

An old problem with a surprisingly simple solution. 
 
Sunlight. 
 
Leave them out in bright sunshine for a couple of days (taking them 
back in at night is entirely optional) and the odor will magically 
disappear. Completely. Best oxidizer in the world; far superior to bleach.

Subject: PH meters (and gelatine question)


Hi there, just signed on...good group! 
 
 
As far as pH meters go.  I do NOT use them in a homebrew type setting.  I do, 
however, use them in my research lab on a daily basis and have learned a few 
things (over the course of ten or so years): 
 
1.  They will eventually break down.  Some last longer than others, but even 
w/ the most scrupulous care, sooner or later that electrode will go south on 
you.  It may last several years, so if this is a good lifespan, go for it! 
 
2.  As for me, when I'm brewing at home, I rely on the pH papers.  They 
provide an accuracy of +/- 0.1, which is close enough for me.  If you need +/- 
 0.01, an electrode is the way to go...but it's just not worth the hassle & 
expense IMHO. 
 
One quick question...does anyone out there incorporate gelatine at the 
priming stage?  I tried this on my last batch and the end product (IPA) was 
really clear, but I'm wondering if this was just a fluke. 
 
Thanks, 
 
Dan

Subject: Invert sugar/honey


In hbd #2113 Gregory King said that honey should do as a replacement for 
invert sugar if used in a 4/3 ratio. 
A few months ago when I asked about invert sugar, A. J. deLange told me 
how to invert cane sugar but noted that an alternative was to let bees make 
the conversion.  I see now what he was referring to.  I suspected he must 
have meant honey but was not sure of what else might be in there. 
The thing I wonder about, though, is why honey is said to take longer to 
ferment than malt if it is mostly glucose and fructose?  Shouldn't they be 
more readily fermentable than maltose since the yeast has to break down 
maltose into glucose just as it has to break down sucrose into glucose 
and fructose?  Or am I off in left field here? 
 
On the "heart of the hops" thread, what is the difference between that and 
using low alpha acid hops, except for saving money by separating the two 
components to allow two different beers to use the same high alpha acid 
hops?

Hey, Jeff, 
        On your way through Connecticut, you might want to sample 
a brown ale from Hammer & Nail Brewers of Watertown, CT. Near the 
intersection of I-84 and Rt. 8. By the time of your trip they 
should be set up for visitors. If you're interested, e-mail me, 
and I'll give better directions, and a list of local 
establishments that carry the beer.

Subject: Ground Ivy Beer/ Boilovers


Vincent Voelz asked about using Ground Ivy (Creeping Charlie) as a beer 
flavoring. I've never actually tried to do anything like this myself, but I'd 
guess that a good first batch might be something like Fraoch Heather Ale: 
light colored and malty, to let the spice show through. I'm just working on a 
hunch here, but I'd guess it might be smart to try a batch to get the flavor 
itself  so you know what it might go well with. I don't know if this is a 
"traditional  English" ale to you or not; the folks who make Fraoch seemed to 
think it was, but then, they seemed to think they were working off of an old 
Pictish recipie too. ;-)  (As far as Fraoch goes, its heather flavor is 
interesting, but not quite up to the level of its price, IMO. Might be worth 
tracking down a bottle or two if you're looking into playing with herbed 
beers, though.) Let us know if you get anywhere working with just the "heart 
of the ivy." ;-)

Howdy! 
To boil or not to boil?  Well, all I can say is that I have tried it both 
ways, and that just dissolving it in 1 cup of water has worked better for 
me.  When boiled (I stirred the whole while) it tends to clump together 
in larger lumps, and does not grab the tannin, and other particulates, 
nearly as well.  I have been told there is also an electrostatic side to 
this, which with a greater surface area, i.e. smaller particles, more 
charge is available to attract suspendend material.  I say try both ways 
for yourself, if unsure.  Maybe I did not stir enough, or heated too 
long, but boiling never works as well for me.

Normal fill at ~day 10 was comparable to overfilled at ~day 20 roughly 
in my experiment. And somewhere between day 16 and 20 my overfill case 
started catching up but, a followup note (also from a 1996 HBD post) 
from day 37 after bottling reveals that the overfilled bottle still 
has less carbonation.  And the underfill mysteriously was more 
carbonated!??! 
 
I explain how after being called away from the critial tasting on for 
~5 minutes I found the carbonation foam. 
 
day 37: 
>The three beers were each in identical glasses, at nearly the same 
>level - each glass about 2/3rd full.  When I returned, the overfill 
>glass had just a thin white ring of head foam, the normal fill level 
>glass had a ring of head foam from the edge of the glass in about 1/4 to 
>3/8th inch, and the underfilled bottle had a fine layer of foam 
>covering the entire glass !! 
 
Tho' all tasted & appeared to be inthe 'normal' carbonation range at 
this point (day 37). 
 
There are many variables here.  I used Wy2308, AlK used 1056, you've 
used several including 1007.  Mark Bayer states a similar experience 
(slow carbonation). 
 
It's possible that the difference may be attributable to factors like 
the yeast cell count in the bottling.  Perhaps yeast have trouble 
reproducing in the presumeably higher pressure of an overfilled 
bottle.  So indirectly flocculation, and the precision of the racking 
might be involved. 
 
As osmotic pressure increases yeast and other simple organisms can 
excrete some of their goodies into the surrounding environment, it's 
discussed briefly in M&B Sci.  Quite possibly this effect is yeast 
variety/condition dependent.  I'm open to better explanations, or 
suggestions for more specific experiments. 
 
Until a persuasive body of evidence accrues, it's probably fair to 
state that some people under some circumstances experience slow 
carbonation or under-carbonation in overfilled bottles. Others 
apparantly don't.

This sounds like the perfect fermenter for my 15 gal. batches! Only one 
concern - will oxidation be a problem? Does anybody know how permeable 
polyethylene is to oxygen? Is oxidation even a concern if I was to use 
this as a primary only, racking off after a week or so? Of course, using 
a conical fermenter is supposed to eliminate the need for racking, so it 
would be nice if oxidation was not even a concern. What is polyethylene 
anyway? Will the spent yeast cling to the sides, or will it fall to the 
bottom like it does in a stainless, conical fermenter?

Don, this is just a guess, but I think that when you put a second batch on top 
of the dregs, you had a MUCH higher pitching rate, allowing the yeast to get 
the upper hand on the nasties. Maybe if you started using a larger starter, 
you could avoid bad batches altogether?

never found anything that really tastes "nutty."  The toasting of the grain 
or the grain itself...that is the question....maybe Ill send someone a 
bottle to have them diagnose.

I've had three different batches of "still" mead become somewhat carbonated 
in the bottle.  Basically, if you abuse your yeast with a really high-G or 
low-nutrient wort, it will take a very long time to totally finish.  Note 
that "real ales" are SUPPOSED to have very low carbonation.

To summarize an old thread: if you're not interested in a topic, dont read 
it.  This solution is simple, saves you time, allows the person with the 
question to post it and get an answer, allows those with answers/input to 
answer, and allows those disinterested to simply ignore it (thats the 
beauty of the "Subject" line).  Everybody's happy.  You should never 
belittle a persons questions/interests.  If youve got 30 years of 
experience, of course you have all the answers. Duh. Im glad 
NOKOMAREE`at`aol.com wasnt one of my teachers/mentors in life; Id be afraid to 
learn.

Just mix 2 large Tablespoons with 1 cup of corn sugar (dry, yes mix them dry) 
stir (dry, yes, stir them dry) and then sprinkle into a cup of boiling water. 
 It will dissolve completely  & immediately. Add to your primer and bottle 
like nornal. 
That's all! No extra steps!  Don't analyze anything! Just do it!

Yes, as dput`at`pe.com quoted me in the previous HBD, 
a 15gal MDPE plastic vessel with a conical btm is 
available from US Plastics for ca. $62.00. 
 
I bought one, and have used it for a few batches now. 
Works well.  I drain off trub at 1 and 2 days via 
the btm valve, skim krausen at 1 and 2 days, drain 
off yeast for ranching at 7-10 days, add gelatin 
then priming sugar, then keg/bottle.  All via the 
bottom valve.  I hoped this would save time, and it 
surely does. 
 
As with any plastic vessel, long term storage is prohibited 
because of O2 permeation leading to oxidation (no lagering).

Subject: Party Pig, Gott


 
I've never had problems with a Party Pig leaking.  I am careful not to 
touch the insides of the spigot thingy.  There is a "dripping" problem, 
though.  For about 2 minutes after dispensing, the tap will drip.  That's 
kind of obnoxious.  Also, the gasket is pretty easy to drop into the beer 
if you drink while kegging.  That's a problem.  The gasket is generally 
easy to use, but if you call Quoin they'll send you extras for free or 
almost free.  I wish they included extra ones when they sell it. 
Also, who is paying $4 for a freakin' pressure pouch?  Son, you're being 
robbed, they're like $2 around here.  And, you can use CO2 to pop the 
pouch instead of the hand pump.  All in all, the Party Pig is a pretty 
good product as a supplement to bottling.  I have one, and occasionally 
contemplate getting another.  I think I'll likely just move up to "real" 
kegs, instead. 
 
The bung for a Fass-Frisch mini-keg works great to vonert a Gott Cooler. 
I recommend it over stoppers, which I've had some problems with.  (Notably, 
after about 15 uses, hot wort somehow leaked into the insulation one on 
batch.  The F-F bung eliminated that problem.) 
 
Everyone - take it easy on the bandwidth, especially if you're just 
bullshitting.  And, harp on each other in private e-mail, not out in public. 
Finally, if you don't like over-analysis of homebrewing topics, why the 
heck are you reading HBD?

I have a weak stove and have always had trouble keeping a good strong boil. 
Until this winter I've always boiled with the lid at least partially on to 
keep the temp up.  Over this winter I read quite in the HBD about DMS 
condensing on lids and falling back into the wort. 
 
My first reaction was to poo poo this, but I tried a little experiment.  I 
collected the condensation from my lid in a bowl, cooled it and tried it. 
Boy! can you say corn.  Absolutely over powering corn. 
 
Give it a try. 
 
>I really

I not sure always would apply.  Way back (HBD #1942) Charlie Scandrett posted:

So I guess there's a time and place for everything.  I don't keep the lid on 
my pot at all for the most. But Ed if your not having any problems don't worry.
 
BTW people use words like "always" and "never" in an attempt to "KISS" (Keep 
It Simple Stupid).  I and I guess Ed like to know why I doing something, why 
it works and why its not done another way.  If we all keep it simple we've 
lost a valuable resource.

Don't worry to much You will most likely never get the smell out of those

 Yes, avoiding male plants is my understanding too. 
 
 
 I am frankly not well read in the lupulin and all the acids contant etc. 
 so Al is probably right. However my family used to farm the best Saaz 
 hops in the world and a part of the procedure was an annual raid on 
 neigborhood woods and fences to erradicate all possible wild hops in order to 
 prevent polination. Well maybe they should instead collect the wild hops 
and sell them as a second class product? I doubt so, they did not know anything
 about lupulin and acids, but they had the empirical experience about how 
 to grow good hops. That's about all I know about this subject. So if 
farmers in England have different experience and somebody likes different hops,
that is OK with me. There are also people out there who love Keystone lite.

Subject: Re: Guinness Ice Cream (last word?)


This somewhat annoying thread has nothing to do with homebrewing, 
but I can keep silent no longer.  In several major Texas cities 
there is an ice cream place called Amy's Ice Cream, of which I am 
not affiliated, that makes an outstanding Guinness ice cream. 
They've made it long enough to perfect it.  And it IS delicious! 
On occasions they also make a fantastic Abita Turbo Dog ice cream 
(one of Louisiana's finest beers) and  one I'm not too mad about, 
Shiner Bock ice cream. 
 
If you're dying to try them, I hope you live in Texas, because it's 
almost cheaper to fly TO the ice cream instead of IT flying to YOU! :) 
They told me the shipment rates are from $50 for a pint to $110 for 
2.5 gallons (bulk bargain!).  I wonder if they ship barrels..... ;-)

Salutations all! 
 
I am moved to de-lurk by the following: 
 
>After 30 years of home brewing I can't believe the stupidity of the 
conversation regarding priming a batch of beer. 
What don't you understand? 
All you do is dump 1 cup of corn sugar (OR 3/4 CUP OF CANE SUGAR) into a 5 
gallon batch and it carbonates! 
What in the world is so hard about that?? 
Why analyze it to death? 
Are you really 
STUPID???????? < 
 
This unkind remark about people who choose to discuss questions about such 
"simple" things as priming sugar, is not a welcome sight on the HBD.  This 
is a grand forum for those who wish to learn and for those who wish to share 
their knowledge, as well as explore their differences. I have learned much 
from the collective wisdom (and lack of wisdom) of fellow homebrewers. 
 
I'm surprised you bother with the digest at all, seeing that you are so 
obviously informed, intelligent and well mannered.  I suspect that you also 
have a fondness for bathtubs, Blue Ribbon extract and bread yeast.  Or..., 
come on now, are you really the Miller brewmaster and you're just upset 
about the recent discussion on Heart of the Hops? 
 
Now a question. 
If one wishes to bottle only a few bottles from a batch, and keg the rest 
with force carbonation, and doesn't have a counterpressure bottle filler, 
what is the preferred method for accurately priming the individual bottles? 
 Private e-mail is fine. TIA. 
 
Lurk mode back on...
