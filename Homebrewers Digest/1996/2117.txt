Subject: Wild Hops and Storage


Thanks to all those who responded (publicly and privately) to my 
questions regarding wild hops and storage of hops. 
 
Most felt that the hops I mentioned were likely a known variety rather 
than being truly "wild."  Also noted was the possibility that the 
presence of male plants might affect quality and usefulness.  The 
consensus (with which I wholeheartedly [Sorry, Miller!] concur) is that 
I should just give 'em a try.  Will do -- I'll probably make a foray in 
early August, and I'll post my results sometime in the future. 
 
My next question concerned freezing UNDRIED hops, prompted by a quote 
from one of Charlie's books.  Only two people responded that they had 
actually done so, and both reported good results.  However, they also 
noted that they did NOT perform comparison tests between dried and 
undried hops.  I guess I'll take that burden upon myself.  The 
overwhelming majority responded to the effect that "Yes, hops should be 
dried -- there must be a good reason because it's always done that way." 
No offense intended, but I can't buy that line.  In a perpetual search 
for improving our craft (and our products), I think we ALL owe it to 
ourselves to tinker and experiment to see if we can't do even better. 
(I find it curious that the "Just Try It" attitude did not extend to 
THIS subject!) 
 
To my mind, one of the best features of HBD is that we can find out if 
others have tried things we've got in mind, and avoid reinventing the 
wheel when possible.  Since no one has reported doing a comparison test, 
I'll do one myself and I'll be glad to report my results, most likely in 
several months.  Unless, of course, those "wild hops" of mine are a 
complete waste of time to begin with ..... <g> 
 
Thanks once again to all those who responded.  I hope I haven't stepped 
on any toes here.  Or even stubbed my own, for that matter!

Daniel and Gary 
 
The ultimate treatise on skunking of beer by UV light is available in the 
latest issue of Zymurgy.  This article is great, explaining all right down 
to the chemistry of the phenomenon. 
 
Living in Sunny South Alabama, I can skunk a brew between my backdoor and 
the chicken house on a sunny summer day.  And skunky brew goes real well 
with the Fowl odors at the chicken house.

Three cheers for Pierre!!! 
 
Everytime I use gelatine, I boil the brewing water that 
I add to make up my ten gallon batch and wait some random 
period of time to allow the water to cool down to 170F. 
At one point, I even monitored the temp with a thermometer 
just to make sure I didn't "kill" the gelatine. 
I did however, take the liberty of using 170 vs the 
"standard" 160 to assure that anything that came off the 
thermometer got Pasteurized. 
 
... 
 
Some mighty wierd stuff going on here but the dummy one is 
getting dangerously close to my territory. 
 
... 
 
What I really wanted to talk about is my recent "discovery" of how much easier 
it is to deal with the Digest in usenet than via email.  I could actually go 
away for a few weeks (but probably never will) and not have to hire someone 
to clear my mail box.  I can read/scan/ignore them at will and it seems the 
NS reader works more efficiently reading news than mail. 
 
It would obviously also make life much simpler for the janitor if all readers 
who have access to usenet would get their digest that way. 
 
So as my favor for the day, I hereby DEMAND that all the DUMMIES with 
usenet feeds immediately cancel their subscriptions to the HBD and get 
it the SMART (my) way.  It really is DUMB to have it mailed.

p.s.  Since putting up my web page, I feel like the Maytag repairman. 
No more DUMB questions in my mailbox :)

Subject: Boiling wheat?


Good morning, 
 
 
 
>> Marty Tippin says: 
Crush unmalted wheat separately from other grains.  Add water to cover and 
boil 30 minutes, adding more water as necessary (the grains soak up a lot!). 
Stir often and watch for scorching. 
<< 
 
Unmalted wheat will gelatinize at about 150 F.  There is no reason to 
boil the wheat.  Why bother with unmalted wheat in these beers?  I 
think that a better and simpler result could be had by using all wheat 
malt to replace the unmalted wheat.  But if you must use unmalted 
wheat; a simple way of coming by it is to just use flour from your 
pantry.  Just be careful when you dough the flour in so  you don't ball the 
flour.

To Fellow Subscribers: 
 
I subscribed to HBD last week.  I am very new to homebrewing and 
enjoyed MOST of what I've read and if I start to read something 
offensive I generally scroll on down to where I can read something that 
is not offensive.  I take exception to the use of words like stupid and 
dumb and such.  The folks in the altercation have the right to call 
each other what they want, but I don't have to like it or read it. 
 
I see from the apologies in Sunday's edition that there are some 
honorable people that contribute to this forum. 
 
So, anybody got a recipe for Breckenridge India Pale Ale yet?

Here, here.

"This gentleman hopefully has his flame shields up.  He is most likely a

Please Jay, there is no need to stoop to NOKOMAREE's level.  (BTW, apology 
accepted.  Too bad the digest doesn't have the cancel feature anymore, eh?)

"While the question may silly may silly to some, the beginning brewer would not

The ShyGuy boldly asks: 
 
<< 
I figure the glass is better for the first, since the wort is still pretty 
warm, and plastic is ok for the second. any opinions? 
>> 
 
IMHO you have it backwards.  Plastic is oxygen-permeable to an extent.  Since 
primary ferments are usually up within a week or so, your chance for 
oxidation is limited; plus the active yeast can help reduce the free oxygen 
that does get in.  A secondary will normally last longer, and with little in 
the way of active yeast, oxidation becomes a concern.

        I accept your challenge...I am truly sorry for losing my cool and 
stooping to the level of using vulgarities on The HBD...this is 
unforgiveable, and my embarrassment and humiliation are indeed great.... 
        As for the notion that I could have any impact, by what you perceive 
to be the threat to cease my participation in the digest, is of course 
laughable and ridiculous. I have re-discovered the power that word's can 
have, and all the more smartly by the great discomfort I have felt for the 
last few days, as a result of my posting. To use your words, sir, I was stupid.
        That being said, never let my original emotion be  mis-understood. I 
deplore the concept expressed by you in your denunciation of those of us who 
are not as blessed by God with your natural abilities to master the art and 
science of brewing. Yes, I agree that the "Keep it Simple Stupid" approach 
to brewing has merit. But  I most vehemently am intolerant of those who 
publically chastise others for asking questions to enhance their 
understanding. The character "Jethro Gump" was created as  a result of what 
I felt to be similar decrying of what I felt were simple approaches to my 
profession. While, of course, there is the need for the scientists to push 
the envelope of our technical understanding, I feel that what has worked 
best for me has been a simplistic approach, such as you espouse. 
        As for getting a better forum for my brewery, I doubt that if this 
had ever been my intent, I have any possibility of success. I don't think 
that there are any readers of The HBD who are in such a geographical 
location to have access to the Little Apple. In terms of commercial 
advertising, I have indeed, missed my target audience, and wasted  my time, 
should this have been my goal. 
No, sir, I am a small brewer, who learned more of my art from the HBD than 
from any other source and am fiercely proud of this forum and what it has 
done for me. Why, then, wouldn't I feel inclined to returning the favor, and 
reporting on those practices I employ in brewing? Why wouldn't I feel 
inclined to share my passion for the subject with others? Why wouldn't I 
feel inclined to encourage those who ask for my advice on their own pursuit 
of brewing as a profession? Why would I bother to get so upset at comments 
such as yours? Perhaps, I am, just too dumb. 
        To conclude, sir, I re-state my shame at my personal behaviour. I am 
deeply embarrassed and am ready to acknowledge as quite correct, any 
denunciations of my actions. I deserve them. But never let my outrage at 
your efforts be mistaken for any thing other than that, outrage. 
        I have met the enemy, and he is me... 
        Most humbly, 
        Jethro Gump

                "The Jethro Gump Report" 
Biohazrd`at`graceba.net asks about Wit ingredients- 
        South Bay Homebrew Supply (310)-517-1841 has Curacao Bitter orange 
peel, Sweet Orange Peel, and Coriander, as well as Belgian Candi Sugar, in 
light amber and dark. I have never bought from them,but intend to when I get 
around to doing a Wit. As for un-malted wheat, I have no ideas, but believe 
that Briess may offer a flaked wheat. I am planning on using DWC wheat. I 
note that Marty Tippin has a source. How about it Marty? 
 
M.Bryson2`at`genie.com speaks on odor removal- 
        I often get such pickle buckets from the restaurant side, and have 
used them for general purposes, such as carrying caustic soda to various 
vessels. It does take quite a while for the smell to go, even with the use 
of caustic at 160 F, but your advice on sunlight is well founded....it works 
for me. A couple of days in the front takes the smell down to barely 
perceptible levels. 
 
Chimay Beer Glasses- 
        One of my customers was lucky enough to travel to Belgium for the 
holidays and visited Chimay. He was curious about some black opaque Chimay 
beer glasses he saw there and wrote to the brewer. He received the following: 
        Dear Mr. Hamscher, 
        Thank you for your recent letter. I'm glad that you enjoyed your 
visit and I hope you will keep a good souvenir of what I feel is quite an 
exceptional small brewery. In answer to your question concerning the 
conspicuous black glasses in the tasting room, in fact these are used in 
analytical "blind" taste tests. The idea is that the tsater is not 
influenced by the physical aspect of the beer and only by the flavour 
characteristics. We use them often when we make a small modification or to 
try a new raw material in the production process. The taster is presented 
with 3 glasses, two of which are the same and the third which is different 
in some way (of course, he or she doesn't know in what order they are 
presented). The taster then has to determine which of the three glasses is 
different. According to the number of correct answers given by the taste 
panel, I can determine if the change in flavour (if any) is significant or not.
        ............................ 
        Yours sincerely,  Paul Arnott 
 
14 Oz Pint Glasses- 
        I just received word from attorneys for the Kansas ABC, and to date 
they have never had a case involving under sized pints, as is also the case 
for the Dept of Consumer Affairs, who state they would most energetically 
pursue any such allegations. Either Kansan publicans are too honest, or we 
Kansan's are too dumb to know the difference..     ;-) 
 
Graham Wheelers Porter- 
        The publisher of "Homebrew Today" also mentioned to me that Mr. 
Wheeler has a recent addition to the bookshelves out...."Brew Classic 
European Beers,"...I'm told the Daniel Bradford of "All About Beer" magazine 
is the US distributorfor thsoe who wish to read more from him. No 
affiliation, just sell AAB at the pub.

Subject: Oktoberfest


Hello Friends- 
 
The one of the Brew Clubs that I belong to, Kansas City Bier Meisters, 
is putting on an Oktoberfest (what a novel idea).  Paul, the 
coordinator, wants most of the beers to be traditionally and authentic 
(and a few other beers to round out the selection).  The problem is 
that we don't quite know what all is traditionally.  Of course there 
is the Vienna / Oktoberfest / Marzen category but we are wondering 
what other styles are traditionally served.  I would guess that wheat 
beer would be served but what about something like a helles bock?  Does 
the celebration has changed along with the times?  I'd think they would serve 
a little of everything. 
 
Thanks in advance for any help you can give. 
 
Cheers,

Subject: NOKOMAREE, fear, loathing & SILENCE!


Some have suggested unsubscribing Noko, others a flame hail. I suggest neither.
 
I have studied fear and it's expression, agression, for some time for a book 
I co-authored. No matter how much I understand the processes, I still have 
"hot buttons" people can press, Noko annoyed me. 
 
This behaviour is sometimes called "battered child syndrome", where a victim 
will provoke an aggressive response rather than suffer the fearful pain of 
being ignored. Logic, disapproval, rejection mean nothing to them, isolation 
is the greatest fear for such people. 
 
I don't care what Noko is afraid of, 
I don't need to analyse him/her, 
JUST IGNORE HIM, 
He needs your response or he will find it somewhere else, 
Remember this, every response invites him back,

Subject: Hops, early production, when to pick?


To all of those here on the East Coast who grow their own hops... 
 
I have a delema...  My hop vines are producting cones early this year. 
Infact, I am debating on whether to pick them or not.  Has the cooler 
damp weather caused the hops to cone early? 
 
Also, how does one tell that it is ready to pick?  I have cut two open 
and found that lapulin glands are small but pale yellow.  I have also 
done the crush test (the hop stays flat).  How does one tell beyond these 
two tests for ripeness? 
 
My total production will be in the volume of 2 - 1 gallon baggies (heavy 
hop production and size - some cones are 2-3" long).

adding less malt, hops etc. to get the style you'd like.  Just look for kits 
or recipes for the style you'd like.  I've only been brewing less than a year 
and likewise I like a variety of styles while my wife prefers lighter styles. 
 I recently tried the Cream Ale recipe from the Cat's Meow with 4#of malt 
syrup and 1# of rice syrup (a slight variation) and with the lightly hopped 
beer it was a nice lighter summer ale which we both like.  Papazian's Palace 
bitter was another good one we both liked but I'd recommend doubling the hops 
to about 12HBU.  The first time I made it I used Hopped malt extract, 
skipping the boiling hops part, and found out later on a web page giving the 
bitterness levels of Hopped extracts that I used about twice as much hops as 
the recipe called for.  We both preferred the extra hops. 
    Cat's Meow:  I also have noticed the variety of quality in the 
descriptions of recipes on the Cat's Meow but have tried a few with good 
success.  I prefer the fuller descriptions of the beers, recipes, 
instructions etc. in a book like Papazians.  But, if you look at the 
ingredients, descriptions, etc. on the Cat's Meow and avoid ones that say 
"mistake #1", or something similar you can probably find some good recipes. 
"Alex's Scotch Ale" (Scottish) has a short description which I tend to avoid 
but the ingredients looked good so I tried it and liked it.  Thanks 
Alejandro.  Whoever put the Cat's Meow together--Good job.  Obviously, view 
the recipes with discretion and extract brewer or all grainer you can brew 
just about any style of beer you'd like.  While partial grain/all grain 
sounds interesting I will be an extract brewer for quite some time.  With 
small kids, its hard to find more than a couple of hours straight to brew. 
So thank goodness for the quality of extracts, books, recipes, and digests 
like this.

Subject: Good pH meter


Hi All: 
 
I've had very good luck with a pH meter by a manufacturer called Newport. 
It cost me 55$ US, and I've used it for 3 years. The electrode is the 
original one. 
 
The  nice thing about this meter is that it reads temperature, and also 
*adjusts* for temperature. That is key: pH is dependent on the 
temperature of the sample. Any pH test done above 70 F (I believe 70 is 
the right temp) has to be compensated for, just like a gravity reading 
needs to be adjusted if the sample is above 60 F. 
 
I highly recommend this meter. Give hte company a call for a spec sheet: 
1 800 newport

Subject: Mash temp H2O additions


 
Hey now, 
I'm fairly new to all grain brewing and would like some guidance. 
I mash in a 10gal Gott cooler, but many recipes say add heat to move between 
temperatures. 
My questions are: 
1. Is it ok to add additional boiling water to reach the desired 
temperature, or would this make the mash too thin? 
2. Is there an easy formula to calculate the amount of boiling water to move 
from current temperature to desired temp? 
Thanks, 
Kevin MacRae

I cannot believe the whining about NOKO's posts...you folks must have 
some damn thin skin!  Are NOKO's posts more annoying than the (nearly) 
endless thread about mash temps from Al and Dave?  I think not! 
 
There's a button installed on every computer for such posts...the

sensibilities are.

Just a couple of points... 
 
1) If no one analysed anything, nothing would ever get better, progress 
would cease.  We would all still be wearing skins and carrying clubs.  Sure, 
it's possible to over-analyse, but there are no absolutes. 
 
2) What, you heckle from the dark and don't give your name.  Coward!  Try

Dear NOKOMAREE, 
 
It is obvious that you have enormous knowledge of brewing issues and 
science.  Im sorry that the recent submissions to HBD have not challenged 
your intellect to its true power. 
 
In the interest of raising the level of discussion on the HBD, I was 
wondering if you could help me to understand more about the process 
of brewing. 
 
Could you explain to me the process of Strecker Degradation as it 
relates to melanoidin formation, with particular emphasis on its 
influence to malt flavoring compounds, its presence in Munich malts 
and the importance of the Amadori compound in this reaction? 
 
Please respond directly to the HBD as we need to raise the S/N ratio. 
It seems to have shifted towards the noise side of late. 
 
Thanks, I look forward to your knowledge, 
 
Jim Busch

Which is exactly what gets his rocks off.  Not that they'd give a hoot, but 
you'd get more mileage out of informing postmaster`at`aol.com. 
 
If he can't ruffle our feathers, he'll go find another group to pick on.  If I 
read his posts, I shake my head in disbeliefe that people actually get a kick 
out of doing this, delete it, and move on to a worthy post.

Subject: Miller beer


     This is in response to a post on a recent HBD. 
 
     <On pedestal> 
 
     There is good reason to write Miller's brewmaster (David Ryder 
     miller`at`execpc.com).  It is not that we should insult their product, but 
     rather criticize their marketing.  They do the public a disservice by 
     taking advantage of the average person's lack of beer knowledge and 
     disseminating misinformation. 
 
     The average beer drinker in this country doesn't even know that hops 
     are a plant!  Perhaps I'm too insulting, but what barbaric images 
     enter their minds when they hear, "heart of the hops!"  It helps us 
     as brewers AND consumers to educate people's minds and palates. 
 
     Aren't you sick of paying over $7.00 for a 6-pack of beer?  Aren't you 
     annoyed when you attend a wedding at a beautiful catering hall with 
     excellent food, only to be offered Heineken or Bud? 
 
     I dream of a day when most people in this country (USA) will know 
     enough about beer to want a diverse selection of quality ones.  Only 
     then will prices fall, flavors improve, and selection grow. 
 
     We must strive for this, or move to Europe!  I'm monolingual, and I 
     like it here (for the most part), so that's not a real option. 
 
     Sorry for the waste of bandwidth, but I do feel strongly about this.

This guy/gal has GOT to go!  If the HBD is too basic for his/her skills, then 
stop posting.  Let beginners ask questions.  I have been brewing 8 years 
and am an all-grain snob.  BUT, I gladly answer beginner questions. 
 
I think NOKOMAREE is mad because their beer hasn't advanced to the 
second round in years (if ever!) and they are blaming the beginners. 
 
So, NOKOMAREE, just keep using your blue ribbon malt and cane sugar 
and maybe one day you will learn what a hop is.

Subject: Do I understand?


If I send you articles you'll publish them in the homebrew digest? 
 
If that is correct, I would like to submit this one 
 
How Do You Spot the ADDICTION? 
 
 
The addiction of which I speak is beer.  Sure most people like beer, but 
some of us (myself included) have this addiction.  Does that mean that I 
and people like me are lushes?  No, I don't think so.  It's always 
tempting to over generalize, but in this case I believe it's true. 
How's does the addiction begin?  Well with me it began with the 
realization that there is more to beer than Budweiser and Miller.  This 
early exploration began with trying as many different brands as 
possible.  I remember buying brands such as Rolling Rock, Straubs, 
Coors, Olympia, Maximus Super, etc.  This should have meant variety but 
it wasn't.   At first this exploration only seemed to support the theory 
that beer is beer and it all tastes the same, i.e., like Budweiser. 
It wasn't really until my first foray into homebrewing that I began to 
encounter strange and new names for beer such as porter and stout.  I 
discovered that beer could have a color darker than recycled Clydesdale 
piss and could have a variety of tastes.  Eventually the beer 
renaissance hit, and we can now purchase a variety of beers other than 
the mass produced American stuff. The variety barrier is much easier to 
break now a days. 
Things have gotten progressively worse since then.  I am now fully 
addicted to beer and brewing.    Reprinted here by the permission of no 
one as a public service are the top ten beer addiction warning signs: 
 
 
10. You lay awake at night dreaming up new beer recipes (some of them 
weird) such as watermelon lambic. 
9. You make vacation plans around beer stops such as breweries, 
brewpubs, and beer fests. 
8. Your main criterion when buying a house is whether it has a basement 
to set up your home brewery. 
7. Your ideal vacation is beer camp. 
6. You read everything you can on beer and brewing. 
5. Your mother-in-law knows about no. 6 and sends you weekly clippings 
from magazines, newspapers and any other printed media. 
4. Your mother-in-law plans for your week-long Thanksgiving holiday 
visit by planning your beer itinerary to include the newest brewpubs and 
breweries since last year's visit. 
3. You have three "fridges" and only one is for food. 
2. You seek out flea markets and yard sales due solely to the 
possibility you might find a cool beer glass or breweriana. 
1. You know what the hell breweriana means.The addiction of which I
