Subject: NOKO has to GO


Hello all of you HBDers who actually use the HBD for information and 
getting answers to your questions.  Don't let this NOKO asshole make 
you not want to post a beginner question.  I love answering beginner 
questions, and passing along the knowledge I have gained over 8 years 
of brewing. 
 
NOW THE IMPORTANT PART (Sorry for yelling, but this NOKO jerk is 
irritating me).  I want everyone out there to email shawn`at`aob.org and let 
him know you do not want to hear anymore of NOKO's dribble.

Editor's Note:  (Yea, well, you know)
When brought to my attention, I checked to see what other stuff had been
posted on this subject.  Please don't send me e-mail.  3500+ e-mails would
probably be more than enough to prevent me from doing work for quite some
time.  Please don't send the digest e-mail either, this would waste even
more of our collective time.  As noted before, this is the type of "fame"
that this particular individual is looking for.  I've asked for his AOL
account to be killed, but as noted before, all that will accomplish is
that he'll get another one, (yes I'm assuming male, most females don't 
behave this way), and then he'll brag to his friends that he's been
kicked off of AOL.


If you really can't handle it and are into sadomasochism, go ahead and
send him e-mail yourself, assuming that he still has an AOL account.


Sorry about the interruption,

brewsters, 
 
I'm sure this a has been asked before but here goes nothing. 
 
I'm brewing a yorkshire ale: 
6lbs pale 
2lbs crystal 60 
1lbs wheat malt 
fuggles & E. kent 
 
The Question: 
 
What do I gain by a multi-step infusion 
(120/140/155/168) over a single step ( 155/168) 
besides a extra couple of hours in front of the stove? 
all degrees F. Times at each are (30/45/90/10) or (90/10) ? 
Any and all comments are welcome here or email. 
 
TIA

Subject: MORE Beta A


DI a!? ayyyyyRyyyyyyyyyyNDe relationships and whether or not high temperature 
brews will produce fermentable brews or not.. I made a simple suggestion to one
HBDer as one possible slight modification to his brewing technique ((based on 
my experience) and you would think I was selling nude pictures of the Madonna!
 
My Papa always told me" never pick a fight, but if you think you are right, 
never walk away." I followed his advice at the beginning using all the 
information I had available that
showed that beta amylase definitely does have a lifetime at the high end of the
saccharification region but how long was ( very highly?) dependent on 
time/temperature history, brewing liquor mineral content, mash thickness, malt 
type, etc. I tried to establish that, using the only really *professional* text
I have, M&BS. I kept asking for data to support either case, but no meaningful 
data ( i.e. the measured lifetime of beta amylase in various mashes and 
conditions) was ever offered, just opinions and theoretical arguments.
 
When I realized that this subject had a high emotional content (people calling 
me prejudicial names - I have no idea who Schmidling is, etc.), for some 
HBDers, for reasons unknown to me I even went to the point of walking away from
this
ridiculous "how many angels on a pin" argument. I did this on more than one 
occasion in hopes it would go away, but it just kept coming back. I am glad 
Steve changed his mind about flaming me - Thanks! ( Why would you want to flame
me?)
 
The fact of the matter is for this discussion, only information gathered from 
real mashes should be trusted, because beta amylase is longer lived in mashes 
than in pure solution and alpha amylase is shorter lived in mashes than in pure
solution. 
 
Steve, I didn't see anywhere you took the effect of the environment into 
account in your theoretical discussion. Impressive as it was, it doesn't 
account for the real facts. Presenting info based on pure solutions, or even
worse not specifying the conditions under which the information was gathered is
not very scientific and permits me to ignore it. As far as talking to yourself 
goes, I am listening to you, are you listening to me?.
 
Steve, if you are going to prepare a brew which will somehow refute my actual 
results, why not do a normal fermentation using a continental or american pale 
malt that has been properly (according to all the books I read) treated by 
holding at various protein rests before the saccharification steps. Why not use
a beer yeast (instead of a wine yeast) under normal ( not forced) fermentation 
conditions, since that is what we are discussing. I thought you were arguing 
that enzyme kinetics were abnormal with exceptional temperature coefficients, 
why would you use normal kinetics to argue what happened to my brew? If you
really want to resolve this issue instead of just flame me, can we do it 
privately and report back to the HBD?
 
Personally, I think we agree on about 99% of this stuff, both enjoy the art and
science of homebrewing, have no reason to be fussing and should be enjoying 
each other's contributions to the HBD.
 
P.S., You can use big words like activation complex, Gibbs' free energy of 
activation, enthalpy, entropy and even Brownian motion, if you want to, I 
understand. Let's not talk billiard balls OK? I have a hard time following your
arguments when you do. I'll be e-ing you.
 
Keep on brewin'

Subject: Carbonation, vessels,beer in spaaace, etc.


DI a!? ayyyyyRyyyyyyyyyyNDs up (i.e. less sharply curved), the strength of the 
wall goes down. Also
the pressure differential of the bottles is positive on the concave side, 
making the problem even worse. Think of a pane of glass as the infinite limit 
and compare that to a bottle in terms of deformation due to pressure. Did you 
ever think about why the bottom of a real champagne bottle is punted ( indented
inward)? 
- ---------------------------------------------- 
On the subject of lactic acid fermentation, I do it separately and add to taste
after the fermentation. This method gives much better control. Some results, to
give you an idea on how to do this, are given below. Use whatever size batch 
you care to, following these proportions. The parentheses show what I expect 
you could do, but didn't in this particular batch.
 
A cup of crushed pale malt in a pint of water, hold at 135F for 30 min and 155F
for 30 min to mash. Cool to 100F add 2 tlb of unwashed barley and/(or) 1 tlb of
uncrushed ( or crushed) malt to provide a lactobacillus starter. Place in a 
thermos or an oven (I do both) at about 100F. In about 24 hours it should smell
slightly of sauerkraut and have a pH = 3.3 and be about 0.1N in lactic acid. 
That is one-tenth of MW of lactic acid in grams per liter of water.
 
This fermentation would also make a good starter for your whole brew 
fermentation, but watch out, control the temperature and the time. Think about 
trying the acid rest technique, in which a mash is allowed to stand until it is
acidified at the begining, i.e before your saccharification (normally used as a
way of correcting for hard water for the lighter brews). I don't know if this 
would work. A starter should speed this up and I don't know what this would do
to the saccharification pH, maybe too low to get good extraction efficiencies 
in your normal mashing/temp/time schedule. I would try it to find out. Doing 
this before the boil and the saccharification means you wouldn't have to be so
worried about contamination. I'm guessing there will be enough sugars and other
carbohydrates around to provide you with lactic acid at these lower 
temperatures.
 
For those skeptics among us, here is the titration curve data (plot it 
yourself) using a pH meter and 0.1 N sodium hydroxide. Sample size was 10ml, 
volume of NaOH is in ml EP = 9.3 ml
Vol  pH vol pH vol pH vol pH

AlK asks if my slowly-carbonating brews were sitting on the basement floor. The
answer is, Yep, but in a double grocery bag to keep out the light. However, so 
were the mini-kegs and no covering. I will take your advice and move the 
bottles to a warmer clime, or at least put it on a board or something. My
temperatures were measured at bottle level, with a thermometer I use to watch 
the room temp during fermentation, placed on the paper bags. Putting them ( 
I'll do half) on a thermal insulator should help. Thanks for the suggestion. I 
still don't understand why the kegs carbonated though and the bottles didn't.
- ------------------------------------------------- 
Father Barleywine asks about open fermentation in his upcoming brewery plans. 
There are many coatings on the market to waterproof concrete. Most modern ones 
are based on urethane, since it doesn't stick well to concrete and is very 
flexible in thet cured state. This combination of characteristics will prevent 
cracks in the concrete, which may develop after coating, from leaking. My only 
concern is what effect urethane monomer, resulting from improper curing or 
improper compounding will do to your beer.
 
I know that many peole will develop an allergy, given long enough and repeated 
exposure to the monomer. Thus robotic painting in Detroit. I don't know if 
ingeston is a problem (I suspect it is) and lots of other things about this. I 
would ask your supplier. I would go to a food equipment or pharmaceutical 
supplier and make sure the film is cured above room temperature with a heater 
in the vessel. Like another HBDer suggests, I would strongly consider using 
used
dairy or pharmaceutical equipment. There are plenty of suppliers. 
- ------------------------------------------------ 
Michael Aesop asks about 10-25 gal plastic containers to use for fermentation 
of wine.
 
Michael, I ferment grapes to make 500 bottles of wine per year ( I have lots of
friends to drink it). For the reds, I crush and destem into the Tupperware 
storage containers approx 1.5'X2.5' X 1.5' deep. These covered with plastic 
sheeting, fastened down with rubber bands looped together or elastic tied in a 
loop, are nearly ideal and will hold about 2 lugs of crushed grapes. I think 
the volume is about 10 gallons, but could be as much as 25 gals. I have about 
twenty of these These can be easily handled and stirred and pushed down during 
the extraction phase which lasts about a week to ten days. I then press and 
transfer the wine to 5 gallon carboys under air lock for the malo lactic 
fermentation to finish, clearing ,etc.. I think six weeks or so is too long to 
keep any fermentation as open to the air as this type of vessel permits. In the
case of polyethylene vessels that are grey or white, I don't worry about food 
grade quality, since the pigments used are generally reognized as safe, being 
carbon black, and titanium dioxide. I realize this may appear to be a cavalier 
attitude to others, and like them, I would recommend you use food grade 
containers whenever possible. Also, if possible, check out the recycle symbol 
on the bottom pf the vessel, it will tell you the composition of the vessel. 
Your local sanitary commission will undoubtedly tell you the composition of the
vessel you choose. I recommend polyethylene for its inertness, no plasticizer, 
no monomer content and general availability at a decent price and variety of 
shapes.
- ----------------------------------------------- 
In the continuing beer in spaace saga, Dave Hinkle asks a number of questions 
about yeast and foam behavior.
 
Why would gravity be necessary to bring about flocculation? As far as I know it
is dependent on the surface charge of the yeasts, nicht wahr? Settling down or 
rising up is a different matter, of course. I guess since we depend on gravity
to deliver fresh wort to yeasts here on terra firma whether bottom or top 
fermenting , in space it will be necessary to pump it around turbulently.
 
Yeast autolysis also isn't dependent on flocculation, but has to do with 
nutrient supply, temperature, etc.
 
Your foam question is interesting, since the reason a bubble breaks is because 
the film drains. Why would a film drain if not under the influence of gravity? 
So, I guess a head would last forever unless the surface tension is broken by 
greasy lips. Could this be the solution to getting a really good head on the
beer without putting up with chill haze?

Alright, guys.  Let's all fess up.  We fell for it.  Yes, he's some kind of

Let's stop giving him the pleasure.  No more posts in response to him, no 
more posts ABOUT him, and no more posts ABOUT the posts ABOUT him. 
And dammit, no more posts about the posts about the posts about him.  Nor 
about those posts - it's downright silly.  And we're not silly here.  Are we? 
 
Sorry for being such a hypocrite lately - but this really is the first and

for paying any attention to him on the digest.  Start with me, now.  Tell 
me I'm just encouraging him.  Just for practice.  And keep going with the 
next guy that flames him.  (Or with anyone who hits me publicly, because he'll 
like that, too.) 
 
But, seriously, there's a point where it's not funny anymore. 
If we ignore him, he WILL go away.  All trolls do.

Subject: extraction pts and rectangular coolers


I have been an all-grain brewer for since 1991 and have brewed 98 
different batches of beer.  When I started, I brewed 5-gal batches on the 
stove with the Phil's lauter-tun and mash-tun.  This is the typical 
5-gal bucket setup.   I typically got 30 - 31 
pts./lb/gal of extract with pale malt.  For 10 lbs of grain, I would 
typically mash in with about 2.5 gal of water and then lauter with about 
5 - 6 gal of water at 80 C. 
 
For about the last 20 batches, I switched to a 58 qt rectangular cooler 
for the mash-tun/lauter-tun which has PVC pipes with slits cut 1/2-way 
through the bottom of the tubing to collect the extract through the hole 
in the cooler.  With this I try to make 10 gal batches.  I have kept the 
amount of water in the same proportion as with the 5 gal system. 
 
My problem is now the best efficiency I can get is 25 pts/lb/gal of 
wort, no matter how much I sparge.  I have tried to increase the 
efficiency by increasing the amount of water for lautering and also doing 
a decoction mash to get better conversion of the starches.  None of this 
has helped! 
 
The only real difference is the shape of the lauter-tun -- cylindrical vs 
rectangular. 
 
Would going to a round, cylindrical cooler help?  The beer still comes 
out fine but this is bugging me! 
 
Thanks,

Dave Hinkle didn't do a protein rest with a pale 2 row malt and now has what 
appears to be a protein haze even at room temperature. 
 
Does the haze go away when you warm it?  If yes, it is likely it is a protein 
haze, and if no it still may be a protein derived haze. Test it for starch 
using
iodine. Failure to give a protein rest with a low modified malt doesn't always 
allow  the starch to be fully converted. 
 
In any event, try this on a small amount of beer. I typically use beer bottles,
clear is better, fill them about half full ( 7 oz), put in varying amounts of 
bentonite  as indicated below. Put them in the fridge and determine the least 
amount of bentonite you have to put in to get a clear beer. If you really want 
to nail it down, do a repeat,  splitting the difference between the one that 
shows haze and the one that doesn't.. This will give you clear beer at fridge  
temp.  If you want to, warm them also to serving temperature in a water bath 
adjusted to the proper temperature for about 30 min and check the clarity, this
will give you the minimum bentonite and maximum protein in solution to maximize
the mouthfeel and still have a clear beer at serving temperature ( but probably
cloudy in the fridge). 
 
Two ways to detect cloudiness. 1) Dark room, look for a flashlight beam in the 
beer (a penlite is best). beam = cloudy, no beam = clear  2) Place the bottles 
on a black background and look through the mouth to get the maximum pathlength.
Sometimes a partially darkened room with lighting from one side is best  for 
this method.  Clear bottles are best for this method. 
 
Dave Miller ( Complete Handbook of Brewing p. 193) suggests the following 
method
for bentonite preparation: 
Boil 1 qt water, weigh out  2 oz of Bentonite ( I suggest boiling it for 5 min 
to sterilize and expand it).  When the water boils, fill your blender to the 
three cup mark (with the boiling water), add the Bentonite , let it soak for a 
few minutes and blend at medium speed until all the granules are dispersed. 
Dilute to the four cup mark with the remaining boiled water.   Two tablespoons 
of this mixture will add 0.1 ppt to 5 gallons.  The usual dose of bentonite is 
0.1 to 0.5 ppt. 
 
If you  have 7 oz of beer in each bottle this represents 7/(128X5) =0.0109 of 
the batch. Take 1 tsp of the above bentonite solution, dilute it with 11 tlb of
water.(dilution factor 33). 2 tsp (reduction factor of three from 2 tlb) of 
this
solution will produce 0.1ppt bentonite in the 7 oz of beer. ( It is a LOT 
easier
in the metric system).  Now take a series of bottles which has 7 oz beer in 
each, add 2 tsp to the first and shake, 4 to the second, etc. Cover the bottle 
opening with plastic wrap and and a rubber band, place them in the fridge 
overnight.  ( you may be able to tell sooner that you need more bentonite if 
they turn cloudy, but not if they are clear).  The number of teaspoons of this 
diluted bentonite solution you add to this bottle is the number of tablespoons 
of the stock bentonite you add to your 5 gallon batch. See my comments above 
about fine tuning. 
 
Also, this is a good opportunity to feel the difference soluble protein makes 
on
mouth feel.  Pour off the beers from the bentonite and taste them in order. 
Also, I suggest you combine a few and  bottle and condition them to really see 
this effect on head, bubble size and mouthfeel. 
 
Please let me know how this works out.

Steve Cloutier wishes to know how to bottle a few bottles and keg the rest if 
one doesn't have a counterpressure filler. I suggest the old fashioned way, for
a 12 oz bottle take a tsp of (sucrose or corn) sugar per bottle ( or 5X128 th 
of
the priming sugar per oz per bottle for a 5 gal batch) and add it to a small 
amount of water, boil to sterilize it and add the appropriate amount of syrup 
to
each bottle, then the beer is added and capped and conditioned at about 65-70F.

Subject: Oktoberfest, decoction mashing


     Jason asks for my "Milo-Marzen #2" recipe.  Well, it's a closely 
     guarded secret...just kidding, of course.  I won't waste bandwidth 
     with it here.  If you want it and can't wait for the Zymurgy special 
     issue, just ask and I'll send it to you. 
 
     Jim Busch's questions to the Brewing God that has recently graced us 
     with their presence actually made me think of a question:  How many 
     people out there decoction mash?  Do you know why?  Do you think it 
     makes a difference?  How about the pro's in the audience? 
 
     I decoction mash almost everything I brew because I like malty beers. 
     I've read about Maillard reactions and melanoidins,etc., and I think 
     it does make a difference.  Heck, the decoct smells and tastes SUPER 
     malty while mashing, so I figure it must be doing something. 
 
     Even so, lately I've been wondering if it really is necessary to spend 
     10-14 hours brewing to achieve this.  I know that in the days of 
     poorly modified malt it was sometimes important to decoct, but why do 
     brewers do it today?  Has anybody out there done side-by-side 
     comparisons? 
 
     Just curious.  Have fun!

Subject: Subject: potatoes


 
 
Do potatoes already contain an appreciable amount of amylase enzyme in 
their "naturally" occurring state ("naturally", as in "how you find 
them at the supermarket?). 
 
I would assume that older ones, that have begun to sprout, are "malted", 
in a sense. 
 
In times past, if you wanted something to ferment to get ethanol, potatoes 
were the food of choice, and I was wondering if this was the reason. 
 
Has anybody here actually tried using them as an adjunct 
(or as a non-adjunct, if they are considered "malted").

Subject: Iodophor Question


Hi Folks! 
 
Like many of you I bet, I don't measure out absolutely everything I use in 
my brewery (garage).  A fine case in point is iodophor -- I usually just 
dump in enough to get a color I like and let it go at that. 
 
I think this got me into trouble though.  From recent posts I developed the 
opinion that iodophor doesn't need to be completely drip-dried, a good 
shake is adequate.  The last batch I kegged, I dumped out the solution, let 
the keg drip upside down for a few minutes, then filled, sealed, and 
force carbed as usual. 
 
That was about a month ago.  Now as much as I try to convince myself 
that I'm just tasting the appropriate sharp goldings bitterness in a low 
gravity bitter, I'm pretty sure that there's a distinct iodine taste as well. 
Anyone else experienced something similar with iodophor?  Any chance 
it'll go away?  If not, can I drink it anyway?   ;-) 
 
In 2117,  Charlie S. is brilliantly on the mark, once again.  He never 
ceases to amaze me!  Also, our Jack shows a sense of humor I'd not 
given him credit for.  I love this HBD!

Subject: Gambrinus ESB malt...


 Gambrinus has a new malt out called ESB.  It is an attempt at an 
English pale malt.  I made a batch of beer to O.G. 1.048 and 31 IBU's using 
this malt only.  Extract was about 30 pts/lb/U.S. gal--slightly better than 
what I get with Hugh Baird malt on my system.  Hopping was 24 IBU's using 
Northern Brewers for 60 min and 7 IBU's at 10 minutes using British Columbia 
Goldings.  The beer was fermented with very sizeable pitching (250 mls) of 
Wyeast 1968 yeast slurry to 40 litres of beer. 
 
 The resulting beer was quite good with a nutty maltiness.  Hops were 
unobtrusive, as I wanted to accent the malt. A residual sweetness was present, 
although no crystal malt was used.  I did not take a final gravity reading. 
I felt that the resulting beer had a good British character.  No DMS was 
detected. 
 
 Generally I'm lukewarm to Gambrinus malts, althought the price is right 
and it's readilly available so I use them.  However, this malt is definatly 
good and considerabley cheaper than Hugh Baird is right now (~$31 U.S. for 
25 kgs).  I'm not sure if Gambrinus is "blending" in darker malts to achieve 
colour and flavour components however, as there are some dark kernels in the 
mix.  I'm not a huge fan of the regular pale malt, as I find it "trubby" and 
a low extract (28 pts/lb/gal), relative to Canada malt 2 row (32 pts/lb/gal). 
However the price is right at ~ $15 U.S. for 25 kgs. I'm not sure of the price 
of the ESB malt, as I won a bag in the local competition.

Subject: thermostat element corrosion


collective homebrew conscience: 
 
i have a thermostat for my freezer, which i use for lagering/conditioning/ 
storage.  there is an element that runs inside the freezer, and it is made 
of copper. 
 
it is green with corrosion, and this started when i put a couple of 
fermenting carboys in the freezer. 
 
any ideas?  is my thermostat probe going to eventually disappear? it is 
corroding so badly that pieces of the green corrosion have actually fallen 
off the probe into the floor of the freezer. 
 
i'd like to stop the corrosion.  also, i'm curious to know what gas is 
causing this.  i thought CO2 was a fairly inert gas. 
 
thanks in advance for the help; i really appreciate all the courteous, 
knowledgable people that contribute to this forum.  it really helps a lot 
of people out. 
 
i'm so glad everyone is so nice, helpful, and generous.

Subject: Professionalism


Brewing is not for everyone. The digest isn't for everyone. For me HBD is 
a wealth of collective knowledge on a multi-layered subject that at times 
can be confusing. I agree that some of the questions asked are elementary 
and could have been easily found by reading any beginning brewing manual. 
Sometimes though it is just this kind of question that starts a thread 
which really digs out the collective's good ideas or  someone's insight 
that we all can enjoy and use. Please let's leave the flaming to the King 
Cooker, (tm) and work on the hobby instead of pissing each other off. 
>Now a beer related question: 
Why in a weisse brewing do they say: The sum of the pitching and the 
fermentation temperatures should equal 30*C? Shouldn't the starter and 
the wort be the same to prevent shock?

Subject: Re: Recipies on Cat's Meow


Mike Galvez asks about the inclusion of failed or untried recipes in the Cat's 
Meow 3. As it happens,  I seem to remember a post in rec.crafts.brewing about 
the selections of recipies for Cat's Meow from Mark Stevens, the saint and 
scholar who runs it. As I recall, the justification for publishing an 
"undrinkable" recipe is the fact that we learn as much (or more!) from our 
mistakes as our successes. You might save a lot of people a lot of time and 
money by exposing your own follies. (Like the time I found out that there's a 
world of difference between the "7%-8% AA hops" called for in a berry wheat 
recipe and the 8.7% AA hops I used. That one took a while to mellow...) 
Similarly, an "untried" recipe might at least shine some light on how some 
other brewers have approached a particular style/question/idea, even if it's 
only theoretically. (I recall a _lot_ of CM3 recipes that say "next time I 
might try...", even when the beer turned out well.) 
 
FWIW, Mark has a book out of selected recipes from the Cat's Meow. It might be 
more up your alley if you're looking for a straight cookbook. I'll be darned 
if I can remember its title, but I'll recommend it strictly on my personal 
experience of CM3 and Mark Stevens. (He's given a lot to this community, and 
if he's finally got a chance to get some payment for it, I say God bless 'im!)

Subject: Looking for cooling unit.


Hi, 
     I'm looking for a small refridgeration unit for a "home project". 
More specifically, I'm a brewer and also a mead maker.  One of the 
variables that I'm looking to finally get control over is fermentation 
temperature.  I don't have a brewing fridge (yet) and am sick of waiting 
until the late fall to brew meads, I need fermentation temps in the low to 
mid 60's (f).  I'd like to try putting something together on my own.  My 
initial concept requires some sort of electric cooling unit.  Does anybody 
know where I can buy a compressor, complete with cooling coils?  I only 
need the compressor and coils, I'll tinker from there.  I've looked so far 
without any luck.  I thought about ripping apart my dehumidifier but I'd 
rather buy something specifically designed for what it'll be used for. 
 
     Thanks, if this works I'll post the plans.

In a fit of personal depression only solvable by shopping, I purchased a 
pound of Belgian Special B Malt at my local Homebrew shop (Jim's Homebrew, 
great shop, not involved, blah blah...).  It smelled and tasted great. 
   I've got a pound of Belgian B, 7.5 lbs 6 row (U.S.), and  2 pounds of rye 
to work with.  Perhaps someone would give me an idea of what attributes 
Belgian Special B will contribute to my beer?   I suppose I could just mash 
this whole mess up into a really nasty hunting season ale.  Dux Deluxe Ale. 
 
 
Private e-mail welcome, but a search of past HBDs through the new Brewery 
HBD-spot (a great service for those of us who don't check email every day at
