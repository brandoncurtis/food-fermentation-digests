Subject: Wheat proteins


     This is somewhat brewing related.  If you're not interested in protein 
     chemistry, page down now! 
 
     The June 27, 1996 issue of NATURE (p.738) reports that the "largest 
     proteins in nature occur in wheat flower...these wheat gluten polymers 
     [have] relative molecular masses ranging up into the tens of 
     millions." 
 
     It goes on to describe the similarity between this protein (glutenin), 
     which is actually a polymer of many shorter proteins joined by 
     disulphide bonds, and the muscle protein, titin (which is the largest 
     single-chain polypeptide). 
 
     They both have elastic properties, which is why wheat is such a good 
     baking grain (the dough is viscous and elastic enough to trap gas 
     bubbles produced by yeast). 
 
     The discrete polypeptides that form glutenin "constitute about half of 
     the protein of wheat gluten." 
 
     It goes on, "The very size of the glutenin polymers makes them 
     insoluble in water..." 
 
     No wonder you need a protein rest when mashing unmalted wheat!!!  I 
     wonder how much of this stuff survives the malting process?  At least 
     some, I would bet! 
 
     That would explain (in part) the high wort viscocity of wheat brews. 
     It's not just the quantity of protein, it's the properties of the 
     protein. 
 
     I guess this just emphasizes the need for a rest in the optimum 
     temperture range of proteases when using wheat, especially if not 
     malted! 
 
     Sorry if this bored folks.  I bet Tracy liked it!

Bill, 
Reference your question (Homebrew digest #2084 27Jun96) on the 
differences for grades of oxygen.  If there no difference between welding 
 and medical grade oxygen, why do they have different grades?  Welding 
Grade oxygen is not food grade nor sanitary.  Welding grae Oxygen should 
NEVER be used for human consumption.  You may contact me at

Subject: Home Brauhaus Q's/false bottom placement


Hi, 
 
I am currently in the planning stage of creating a Brauhaus in my 
basement.  The system will be your typical 2 tier, 1/2 barrel system. 
I have the parts for the system (for the most part) but my concern 
right now is safety.  I have heard all the warnings about not using 
propane cookers indoors, but are there any which are safe for indoor 
use (other sources of heat are currently unavailable) ?  If not, does 
anyone know of exhaust fans or the like which are effective in reducing 
Carbon Monoxide and other fumes which would be hazardous to me or my 
family?  On the topic of Carbon Monoxide, are there any recommendations 
for CO detectors?   Are there any other suggestions from others who 
have made an indoor system? 
 
Now a brewing question:  My friend and I brew 10 gallon batches using 
his 2 tier system with  a converted, insulated keg (1/2 barrel) as a 
mash tun.  The false bottom is probably 3-4 inches above the bottom of 
the mash tun.  When we add the water to the grains for the initial rest 
at 122F, how should we account for the volume of water below the false 
bottom (probably 2 1/2 - 3 gals)?  Should we disregard it as far as the 
mash goes, but include it when taking into account the amount of liquid 
desired for sparging and the boil ?  Is placement of the false bottom 
important?  Should I make the attempt to have as low a false bottom as 
possible when assembling my system? 
 
TIA , private responses are fine.

Subject: NOKOMAREE`at`AOL.COM


 Clark Ritchie has a very good theory about NOKOMAREE having some 
connection to John Carey.  Mr. Carey posted the following beer recipe earlier 
this year, and was flamed for it:  
 
>Ingredients: 
>        4 kg white sugar,(corn if preferred) 
>        2 cans (1.13kg) Brewmix malt 
>        1 can doric malt 
>        various types of hop pellets to taste. 
>This makes 14 doz. bottles of brew.  About 7% 
> alcohol by vol. 
> ... <snip> 
 
 I have a different theory: 
 
 Mr. NOKOMAREE was sent here to convince the readers of the HBD that 
this publication cannot survive unless it becomes *moderated*  Think about it- 
- --first we get 3 or 4 issues per day, preventing everyone from doing anything 
else but reading the HBD, and now we have this alias come on posting insults, 
inviting insults in return.  Having a moderated digest will seem like the 
only valid option after a few more issues.  I sure hope I'm wrong though.

Gelatin primarily helps settle yeast.  It works like Isinglass although 
it is reported (in various books, most compleatly, I believe, in Terry 
Foster's talk in one of the Beer and Brewing series from Brewer's 
Publications) that it is not at good at settling yeast as Isinglass. 
Gelatin may have some attraction to tannin, but this is not it's primary 
use and if it's tannins you are trying to remove, Polyclar works far 
better.

     Next, a question:  Does anybody dispense beer from kegs at "proper" 
     temperatures (50-55F)? I've read all about 
     pressure-drop-per-length-of-tubing, etc., and calculated that I needed 
     31 FEET of hose to dispense ale `at` 55F and 28-30 psi. 
 
Firstly, even without consulting the tables, 28-30 psi is very high 
for dispensing beer at 55F.  Okay, now I've looked at the tables and 
it's about 3.1 or 3.2 volumes of CO2.  This is pretty high.  Typically, 
you would want 2.0 to 2.4 volumes for British-style beers, 2.4 to 2.85 
for most other beers and 2.85 to 3.0 for high-carbonation beers such 
as Duvel and Weizens. 
 
At 55F, for 2.4 volumes you would use 19 psi and for 2.7 volumes, 23 psi. 
 
As for hose length, if you have a lot of pressure to drop, don't try to 
drop it with 1/4" ID hose.  Get some 3/16" ID hose which has a much 
greater drop per foot.  I serve my beers typically at 50F and use 6 feet 
of 3/16" ID hose which coils nicely on top of the keg in the chest freezer.

Well, I missed the "brewing in Summer" poll, but would have answered "no" 
prior to last Friday and "yes" since.  I'd like to add, however, that in the 
interest of avoiding infection from the airborn nasties that I KNOW are 
floating around my house, I siphoned rather than poured my wort into a 
carboy that had been purged with oxygen.  I then oxygenated with an 
Oxynater(tm).

Recently, in private email, someone sent me a note about invert sugar. 
I'm afraid I've lost it or printed and deleted the email.  In any event, 
this was a chemist who said that only a small portion of the sucrose would 
get inverted in a short, 10-minute, boil.  Perhaps whoever this was (sorry) 
could post more on this in the HBD... I'd like to know and I'm sure that 
there are others who would too.

Dave later wrote that perhaps papain would not be a good idea because it 
may reduce the heavy body.  Indeed.  Papain does work well to cut up proteins 
and they are the source of your heavy body.  Papain doesn't care which 
proteins it cuts up and you probably don't want to heat your beer to denature 
the papain so in the end you will have very thin beer. If indeed it's protein, 
one thing you could do is (believe it or not) add tannin!  This is a rather 
radical approach and would require lots of aging to settle the chillhaze you 
would be creating.   How much should be added is a mystery to me.  You could 
add a little and see how it works, then try adding more, or you could add 
a lot and then try to clean up any excess after racking by adding Polyclar.

Polyethylene is pretty permiable to oxygen.  I haven't read about medium- 
density, only low (LDPE) and high (HDPE).  LDPE is what plastic sandwich 
bags are made of and HDPE is what's used for virtually everything from 
those white plastic fermentation buckets to garbage cans.  HDPE is pretty 
oxygen-permiable as plastics go, but LDPE is much worse.  I would imagine 
that MDPE would be between the two in permiability.  If the plastic is 
thick (1/8" or better) and the closures seal well, I would guess that 
you should not have any problems with oxidation for several weeks.  I 
would not lager in these vessels.  For ales, it does sound like a great 
fermenter... I may get a few myself!

Among these many people is Terry Foster whose very well-researched book 
"Porter" contradicts this statement.  Dr. John Harrison would be a good 
person to ask to mediate, or at least cast the tie-breaking vote. 
 
Geoff...  are you still on-line?  Could you ask John what his research 
has shown and post here?  Thanks. 
 
Wheeler also writes:

I question that Rodenbach is at all related to London Porter.  I would like 
to see some references for this statement. 
 
Wheeler:

Perhaps the author should be sure before he puts pen to paper.  Indeed the 
microbe is different.  Lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid are very different 
not only in their products but also in that the former are facultative 
anaerobes and the latter are strict aerobes!  For the record, I personally get 
no acetic (vinegary) character in either of the Rodenbach beers. 
 
Wheeler:

Had Mr. Wheeler researched a little further, he would have found that 
mixing soured beer with fresh is nothing new or history-breaking to 
Guinness and that they have been making their flagship beer this way 
for quite some time. 
 
Reading back at what I've written, it sounds a little harsh, but in my 
opinion, under-researching our posts to the digests is one thing, but 
being unsure of things in an article or a book is very bad form.

Wait till the crush test results in a hop that springs back and doesn't 
stay flat.  Also, when the hops are ready they will be more papery to 
the touch as opposed to leafy.  All the hops will not be ready at the 
same time, so ideally, you would like to pick each cone when it is 
ripe.  If it begins to brown a little at the edges it is getting "too 
ripe."  As long as it doesn't get more than just slightly brown at the 
edges you should be okay.

Subject: Cider and mead


 
Dear Friends, 
 
As I informed you, I am decided to start homebrewing soon. However, I 
need to find a supplier first. I have been working on this and soon I 
will order the neccessary ingredients to homebrew good beer. Besides, I 
need to make the arrangements to import these ingredients (special malts, 
yeast and hops). This will take some time though... 
 
Meanwhile, I think I will homebrew mead and cider. I have the ingredients in 
my country and it will be easier for me to start with these beverages 
while I wait the ingredients for beer. 
 
I need some recipes for mead and cider. I need to know exactly the amount 
of water I will need to add to honey (for mead) and appple juice (for cider). 
If I added some fruits to the wort, when should I do it and how much? 
 
Please, mail me a couple of recipes and procedures. 
 
Thanks

Subject: Opinion of the dumb


All, 
 
Do forgive this intrusion.  I have yet to catch up reading past digest 
2115, but must stop to offer my $.02.  I would hope the gist of my 
exposition also exists in other (2116, 2117, etc.) volumes, and apologize 
if this issue has been over covered. 
 
I am speaking of an individual called NOKOMAREE`at`aol.com.  This person 
seems to be the "be all end all" expert on many things.  Opinions, and 
simple solutions, flow from this address like beer from a tap.  This is 
all fine.  We are each entitled to offer suggestions, even criticisms, in 
an adult manner. 
 
Only when we begin kindergarten name calling do we degrade ourselves and 
our respectability.  Calling each other, and the things we do/believe, 
"dumb" is SO childish it belongs on a playground.  Although I do not 
encourage "flaming", and feel that (if it is done) it should be private, I 
think our "flames" should at least reflect our nature as adults. 
 
If we, as HBD readers, allow ourselves to be called "stupid" and "dumb" 
then we just may fit in these shoes.  Straightforward and "honest" or 
not, there are MANY more INTELLIGENT ways to disagree and/or give a simple 
answer.  Some people ask a lot of "dumb" questions because they DON'T have 
experience and want to know.  Asking questions, of any type, is encouraged 
in schools throughout the world.  The HBD exists to offer 
input/answers/discussions and (yes) ANALYSIS of these questions, no matter 
how "dumb". 
 
I would rather increase my knowledge through a "stupid" question than 
decrease my intelligence through name calling and "straightforward answers 
(as given my NOKOMAREE)". 
 
Like the old saying goes: 
 There are no stupid questions 
 Only stupid people 
 
Perhaps the latter offer only "simple" solutions and resort to childish 
name calling. 
 
Of course, this is just my opinion.  Analyse it all you want.  I'm not 
perfect, although I may yet be called "stupid".  If so, remember this...

Subject: Unmalted Wheat, Fruit Extracts


A quick note on where to find unmalted wheat. After visiting and calling 
every homebrew shop both in town and in surrounding areas, I visited a 
local bread shop that bakes specialty breads, etc. The manager thought it 
was a kick that someone wanted to use the grain (raw red winter wheat) for 
something other than bread, and was more than willing to sell me as much 
or as little as I needed. Go show 'em what that grain was really made to 
make! Also... 
 
I'm sure everyone has seen the various jars of fruit flavorings in 
homebrew shops. And yes, I'm sure they are vastly inferior to using the 
real thing. But..Just how good (or bad) are they to use to make a stab at 
a fruit flavored stout, porter or wheat? I've been searching the digests 
to find some info, but not having much luck. I can't find anything in CM3 
either. The jars I've seen hold 4oz, and are labelled as being used for 
5 gallons. They smell pretty potent, and I'w wondering if that would be a 
bit much for a 5 gallon batch. Could someone with some experience relay 
some information on these? 
 
 
 
Thanks,

Subject: Green Copper / Fermentation Temperature and Refrigerator Miscellania


Mark Bayer's lagering fridge has Green Thermostat Syndrome. 
 
My guess is it's sulphur dioxide -- SO2.  Produced by yeast, prodigiously by 
certain strains.  Not sure about a cure.  Try cleaning it up with vinegar, 
then perhaps you can paint it to protect it. 
 
******************** 
 
Ed with the long last name asks about controlling fermentation temperature. 
 
Ah, a topic so very close to my heart.  I "solved" the problem with a device 
I call a "Fermentation Chiller".  You can find my Rev 1 plans on my web page. 
 {If you decide that this is the route you want to go, wait (a couple weeks) 
for Rev 2 -- improved design imminent.}  It's a thermostatically-controlled 
icebox, but the ice will last 2 - 4 days between changes depending on your 
ambient temperature.  Works well in the 55F - 70F range even in an 85F+ 
garage. 
 
I'm also presently working with an HVAC friend on building a custom fridge 
for my kegs.  Same idea as yours -- buy a compressor and duct-tape it to a 
box of my own construction.  My friend says the problem with this approach is 
that the condensor & evaporator must be "sized" or otherwise matched properly 
to the compressor; I presume that things like the internal volume of the 
plumbing and backpressure and such come into play.  Bottom line: you can do 
it but it takes some serious tweaking.  Best bet here is to find an old 
fridge that you can cannibalize "all" those parts from and proceed that way. 
 
Possible tip on locating fridge parts:  I have a friend who is a store 
manager of a well-known national department store (which shall remain 
nameless).  They get two or three fridges a month that they literally crush 
and dump.  These fridges are those that have had more than five service 
calls.  It's cheaper at that point for them to simply toss the damned thing 
and replace it with a new one.  They don't normally sell/give them away for 
fear of someone trying to further scam the store with more service calls, but 
I suppose if you talked nice or told them you just want the compressor and/or 
other parts, they might bite.  Problem is, it's usually the compressor that's 
bad on these dudes. 
 
Just a couple HBD's ago someone posted that they build refrigerated wine 
cellars for rich folk.  What they do is get one of those office fridges (the 
little "cube" type) and carefully cut away the cabinet until all that's left 
is the "guts".  This is then adapted to fit the new cabinet.  A circulating 
fan blows air through the "freezer" section (the evaporator) into the new 
cabinet.  Great idea, especially if you can find some college kid dumping 
his/hers at the end of the school year.  Or just wait for your cubicle-mate 
to be "downsized" and grab his as they escort him to the door with only the 
shirt on his back. 
 
Finally, there are the thermoelectric elements (Peltier junctions).  These 
are solid-state devices that "separate" heat from cold, so to speak, under 
the influence of electrical energy.  They are used in those "powered" ice 
chests you've probably seen.  Drawbacks is that they are relatively expensive 
($20 - $30 or so) and require a hefty power supply (another $10 - $30 
depending), plus one or (better) two small fans.  Procewise this may still be 
better than a conventional refrigerator, but rumor has it that you might need 
to double-up on the elements to get adequate chilling, although for ale 
fermentation one's probably good.  Surplus houses are a good bet if you want 
to experiment with these things; I know ALL Electronics (800) 826-5432 
carries them ($20), though I don't know what cooling capacity their 
particular ones have.  By the way,  ALL Electronics also has 200mV /  9-volt 
powered DPM's for $10!! (for all your digital thermometer project needs...) 
 No disclaimer here -- they carry a lot of neat stuff (and some junk too), 
their prices and terms are great, and I've always gotten fast service.

Subject: DME dingle balls and assorted trials....


Well, yesterday saw my first partial grain brewing. I nicked the recipe from 
NCJHB the Palilallia IPA. A bit more work than my previous all malt extract 
brews but not too bad. Jeezum, when I added the 7 lbs. of DME it created this 
gargantuan turd like lumps that took forever to dissolve, is this normal? 
Messing about with the grain was no big deal but the rolling pin almost 
ripped the ziplock bag, I guess a mill makes this easier. I am a massive fan 
of Yuengling black and tan, is anybody familiar with it, and if so any ideas 
for a extract or partial grain clone? Thanks in advance for info and thanks 
to all who have so patiently answered my rookie questions. HBD is great and 
the humor makes my day. Keep the mood light.

Firstly, 2 pounds of crystal malt is more than 20%.  This is rather 
excessive.  I would recommend keeping the crystal malt at or below 10% 
of the grist. 
 
Regarding your question, the 120F rest breaks medium and large proteins 
down to amino acids.  This is fine and necessary if you are brewing 
from undermodified malt (which is VERY rare these days) but will give 
you very watery beer if you are using well-modified malt. 
 
The 140F rest will do two things.  If indeed there are some large 
proteins, it will give protease a chance to cut up these big proteins 
into medium-sized proteins which will give you less hot and cold break. 
The other thing it will do is give beta-amylase a chance to cut up 
a lot of your dextrins and give you a more-fermentable wort.  For a 
bitter recipe like this you would like to keep the dextin content 
rather high, so this is a bad thing. 
 
With well-modified malt (which I measure by how reasonable the hot and 
cold break volumes are) you are much better off just going with a 
155/168F schedule.  You may even want to go with a 158/168F schedule 
to give you even more dextrins and less fermentability, but 155/168F 
is a good start.

There are a number of Belgian maltsters making a malt called Special B 
but I'm only familiar with DeWolf-Cosyns Special B, so these comments 
are strictly regarding this malt.  I feel it gives a raisiny aroma, 
quite a bit of caramelly sweetness and a touch of roasty character. 
1 pound is an awful lot to use with 7.5# of 2-row and 2# of rye.  I 
would keep it's use below 5% of the grist unless you want to learn 
what character it adds in an experimental batch.  Using 10% or more 
of this grain will be VERY noticeable and chances are pretty good it 
will be overdone for virtually any style.

Subject: pH Measurement, the Answers


I recently asked the collective about pH measurement since I was having 
trouble with my meter. I basically asked what people found to be good ways to 
check their pH when brewing. Also, the best way to store an electrode to get 
more life from them. 
 
Thanks again to all who responded. This is a great forum! 
 
First, some recommended I read the instructions that came with the meter. 
(They said store the electrode in storage solution XXXX or, if unavailable, 
tap water) Next, most recommended storing in pH 4 solution. Most mentioned 
buying a more expensive meter. 
 
The second camp said that digital meters were not practical for homebrewing. 
The Colorphast pH strips made by Merk were very good. 100 strips for $15. PH 
meters are not reliable and hard to maintain over the long run. 
 
I am inclined to agree with the second group. Though I am storing my new 
electrode in pH 4 solution, my next purchase will probably be Colorphast 
strips by Merk. Unfortunately, the catalog from which I purchased the meter 
does not offer (or recommend) a storage solution. I like gadgets, but a GOOD 
pH meter costs more than I paid. 
 
Thought the collective deserved a recap...

Subject: Mellinoidin w/o the hassle


Hi all, 
 
George De Piro brings up a good subject in mellinoidin production. That is, 
how do you produce mellinoidin to give your beer that bready/malty flavor 
without the drudgery of decoction? Darryl Richmans' book "Bock"(excellent 
book)covers this subject very well. In short he suggests using a malt high 
in melliniodin ie Munich malt and dark crystal malt in your beer along with 
3 hr boils to subtitute for decoction mashing. I have made a few Bocks using 
75% Munich and 4% 90L crystal(along with other things) and 3 hour boils and 
have been very satisfied with the results. 
 
I have added Munich malt in small quantities to Porters,Browns,Alts,and even 
Pils in smaller quantities but I would like to know if anyone has used 
Munich as a base malt for something like a robust Porter or an American 
Brown. I wonder if this is how Rogue makes their ales so big and malty? 
 
Later,

Subject: just a little gas -- the bubbles in Guiness


Hi: 
 I am trying to get a reference for the behavior of the bubbles in 
Guiness Stout.  The nitrogen/carbon dioxide mix was the topic of a Zymurgy 
article by Cliff Tannor in Summer of 1994. There is also clearly some 
nontrivial fluid dynamics in the behavior of the bubbles (which appear to 
go both up and down before settling) and also the behavior of larger 
cell-like structures which appear exhibit some larger scale motion. (There 
was also an article by Dick Zare in Physics Today on beer carbonation.) I 
am sure I have seen another article on the dynamics of bubbles in Guiness, 
but I can't remember where I saw it. Can anyone help me with this? 
 This may be a topic which has been covered recently, but I've been 
out of touch for a while. Thanks in advance.
