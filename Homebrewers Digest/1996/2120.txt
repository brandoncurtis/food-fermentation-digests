Subject: hops and weizen


In 2117 Mark Witherspoon asks about hop picking.  I picked several ounces last 
weekend as many of my hops were turning brown on the ends.  According to David 
Beach in Homegrown Hops, he sets the following criteria: 
1) slice one open and look for a dark shade of yellow powder like highway lines
2)  when squeezed an unripe cone feels damp and soft and stays compressed.  A 
ripe hop feels papery and will spring back unpon light squeezing. 
3)  mature hop cones will gradually start to show tan on their tips

I think the yeast (starter) and wort are at the same temperature initially. 
After pitching, the temperature may be raised or lowered to the desired 
fermentation temperature. For example, the yeast at 54F (12C) may be pitched   
into wort at 12C and then allowed to warm to 18C for fermentation. However,  I 
don't think a temperature differential of 6C would bother the yeast much 
anyway.

Subject: Roggenbier, Extraction efficiency


Brewsters: 
 
Guy Gregory asks for comments on the impact of one pound of Belgian Special B 
malt on his planned brew containing 2 lbs of rye malt and 7.5 lbs of pale malt.
Not being familiar with the Belgian malt I cannot say with surety, but  I 
suspect the result will be related to Roggenbier from Germany and the rye will 
predominate. Like chicken soup the belgian malt probably won't hurt, 
particularly if it is, as I suspect, a crystal type malt, it would be right in 
style. You probably should start your beer now if you want it by hunting season
as it may take you a while to sparge it. 
- ---------------------------------------------------------- 
Keith Reding wonders why his extraction efficiency  has dropped since changing 
his setup.  My first question (assuming you have made direct comparisons with 
the same malt, recipe, etc.) is have you changed your malt milling method? This
can severely affect your efficiency, particularly if you take less than about 
an
hour to sparge.  Secondly, with your new design can you get channelling in the 
grain bed?  Thirdly what is the temperature of the sparged wort at exit? ( I 
like mine at 165F) Larger batches, taking longer for the water to pass through 
sometimes lose heat faster than smaller batches, particularly if the sparger is
uninsulated and of the same diameter,  only longer.  Boost the input water 
temperature to the sparger and you will probably sparge faster and more 
efficiently.  Another factor is the hardpan that forms on the top of the grist 
during sparging. Twice as much grain in the same diameter sparger can severely 
slow down an unstirred (unraked) sparge and you can cut off the sparge 
prematurely or induce channelling. Have you tried a laboratory scale extraction
or asked your supplier to confirm that your malt has the same properties as in 
the past?

I recently (yesterday) tried my first double decoction mash in a light ale 
I make for my wife.  I too, am trying to obtain a more malty flavor in the 
beer.  First I tried a single decoction and there was not a lot of 
improvement, but some.  So I tried the double decoction and am waiting for 
the product of my extensive labor.  I truly mean extensive labor.  It took 
about 4 hours just to mash and then the sparge ran slow.  The beer better 
be exceptional or I'll return to protein-rest/convert/mash-out and forget 
about it all. 
 
To Mark "Brew Hard" Bayer. 
 
Yes CO2 is pretty inert (makes a good fire extinguisher) but it forms acid 
in solution (Carbonic Acid.)  No doubt the CO2 given off  by the 
fermentations (and that's a considerable amount) dissolved into the ice 
around the metallic parts, formed a weak acid, and began to corrode them. 
As to stopping this corrosion;  neutralize the parts with an alkali 
(baking soda), dry them well and maybe coat them with some sort of lacquer 
to prevent the process from repeating.  Of course, all of this is just a 
guess and it could be gremlins. 
 
And now a question to the collective. 
 
What is the importance of the Maltose rest at ~140 degrees prior to 
advancing into normal conversion range around 150 degrees?

I also let my keg drip upside down once and upon checking it again later, I 
noticed that it was not at all drip dried.  First I like to push the in and 
out tappets down with a key to let gravity pull any liquid out of the tubes 
and usually quite a bit of discharge is seen.  I noticed that several 
upright/upside down rests along with a lot of shaking are needed to really 
get drip dry results.  I wonder if Randy has checked this out.  Maybee your 
keg was not nearly as dry as you thought.

Subject: Oxygen grades


John Cheek of Liquid Bread writes: 
 
>Bill, 
>Reference your question (Homebrew digest #2084 27Jun96) on the 
>differences for grades of oxygen.  If there no difference between 
>welding  and medical grade oxygen, why do they have different grades? 
 
While researching the aeration article that I wrote for BT, I called 
Air Liquide (909) 899-4600, one of the largest gas "manufacturers" in the 
world, and talked to someone who obviously knew a great deal about 
the product the company sells, John Newhouse. 
 
John stated that they have three grades: industrial, medical, and ultra-high 
purity.
The industrial gas is what is supplied for welding and food industries. All of 
these versions are 99% pure, the difference comes from the number 
of decimal places that they can guarantee the purity.  For example, 
industrial grade is 99.8% pure, ultra-high purity is something on the 
order of 99.999% pure (and way beyond the realm of most of our 
pocketbooks).  He also told me that the impurities are only 
trace amounts of other gases found in the atmosphere, NOT 
bacteriological.  What really astounded me is that he said the FDA 
had NOT approved medical grade oxygen for use in the food industry, 
and he thought this was a bit strange. 
 
Medical grade is inbetween as far as purity goes, but he 
told me that the only real differences between the industrial grade 
and the medical grade is that they use tracking numbers on the 
medical cylinders in case they ever need to prove the batch purity, and they 
never use cylinders that have been used as "industrial" because they *could* 
have become cross contaminated if the backflow preventer failed and allowed 
another gas (in the case of gas welding this would most likely be acetylene) to
enter the oxygen cylinder. I learned to weld when I was about 10 (I'm 41 now), 
and I have yet to see this happen).  I also have yet to see a professional 
welder use tanks without backflow preventers, although I'm sure there 
are some folks out there who are exceptions to this. 
 
The manufacturers also use nice, clean-looking cylinders for the 
medical grade for obvious reasons.  If you want to be really safe, 
just buy a new cylinder and have it refilled; don't exchange it. 
 
When I asked John about buying medical oxygen for brewing, his 
response was "why?" 
 
>Welding Grade oxygen is not food grade nor sanitary. 
 
I'd like to see your references for this. 
 
>Welding grae Oxygen should NEVER be used for human consumption. 
 
Reference?  What biological contaminants could live in a pure O2 environment, 
never mind the pressures that are created and maintained in a cylinder, and 
any petrochemical contaminants--folks sometimes think that "oil from the 
machinery" finds its way into the end product--would result in an 
immediate disaster (read: explosion), then what are you suggesting is 
in welding grade oxygen that makes it unfit for use in the 
food industry? 
 
To put it into perspective, how many contaminants do you think exist 
in the air if you are using an "open" type of aeration technique? 
How many contaminants do you breathe every day from the environment, 
e.g., rubber dust, visible and invisible air pollution, asbestos, 
lead, etc.  If the welding grade of O2 is 99.8% pure, what possible 
*manufacturing* contaminant in a concentration of .2% could result in making it
undesirable for our purposes? 
 
Sorry if I sound harsh here, but I'm getting a bit tired of the 
misinformation bandied about regarding the different grades of 
oxygen. I also realize that I sure as hell don't know everything there is to 
know
about this subject; that's why I called Air Liquide. So, if someone has 
something
to add--in agreement or contrary to what I've been told--please join in. 
 
Most of the retailers/intermediaries I questioned really didn't have a clue 
when it
came to the the differences between the grades.  That's why I went to 
the source.  Personally, I've used industrial grade oxygen for years in my 
brewery, and I know of quite a few micros/brewpubs that do the same.

A recent case in point is the message from John Cheek

NEVER be used for human consumption." 
 
Well, inquiring minds want to know.  WHY NOT?  What *is* in welding 
grade oxygen that is *not* in medical oxygen?  Is it harmful to 
humans?  (E.g., the MSDS for at least one supplier's welding grade 
oxygen states that the composition is 99.5% O2 and .5% N2.  Doesn't 
sound dangerous, does it?)

Subject: Pitching temp for Weizen, Cu corrosion in fridge


     Carrick is confused by Eric Warner's statement that the sum of the 
     pitching and fermentation temp. of Bavarian Weizen should 30C.  He is 
     afraid of thermally shocking the yeast. 
 
     You are correct in being afraid of thermal shock, but what Warner 
     means is that the entire wort AND the starter be at the pitching 
     temp., then slowly changing the temp. of the ferment to fit that 
     equation.  For example, if you want to ferment at 18.3C (65F), you 
     should pitch at 11.7C (53F). 
 
     I've never actually done this perfectly, because I don't have precise 
     control over chilling/fermentation temperature.  Does anybody out 
     there have actual experience with this? 
 
     About that corroding copper, could it be that the CO2 from the 
     fermenter is dissolving in the water that may have condensed on the 
     copper, thus forming a weak carbonic acid solution?

Subject: Invert sugar/honey and slow fermentation


John asks about the slow fermentation of honey, considering its sugary 
composition.  Yes, the bees do "use" invertase to invert the sugars. 
The resulting levulose and fructose are very fermentable. 
 
Indeed, honey fermentations have the deserved reputation of being 
slow, but the reasons for this are definable and remediable.  Honey 
has very little nitrogen, and so needs to be "juiced up" with both 
yeast nutrient and energizer.  Some people are big on bubbled oxyegn, 
but it's another expense I can't see myself convincing my wife we 
absolutely need. Additionally, many mead makers have taken to heart 
the advice to acidify their musts before fermentation.  I think that 
is a mistake.The initial pH is low enough that when additional acid 
is dosed in, the pH drops below the "optimal operational range" of 
the yeast, and it slows down to a crawl. Keep the pH above 4, add 
nitrogen, use a big, healthy yeast starter, and high gravity honey 
primary fermentations can happen almost as quickly as barley wines (2 
weeks or so).  Do your acidification post fermentation.  Best of luck. 
 
Yours brewly, 
Schramm

I make mostly German style beers and I decoction mash all of them, strictly 
for the flavors and aromas it produces, which is probably why most brewers 
(who do) do it these days. I believe this is the only way to consistently 
obtain certain aromatic components. Fortunately, it doesn't have to take 12 
long hours. In my experience I have found that a single decoction (approx. 3 
hr. mash time) is enough to obtain these desired flavors, even with super 
malty beers that are traditionally triple-decoction mashed, such as 
doppelbocks. Boiling the decoction for 30 minutes or more will also help to 
achieve the desired effect, as some Maillard reactions proceed slowly even 
at boiling temperatures, and it takes approximately 20 minutes of boiling 
before some of the most aromatic melanoidins begin accumulating in 
appreciable quantities. I've done no controlled brewery experiments (eg. 
split mash?), but based on blind taste-tests, I can usually tell if a beer 
was decoction mashed instantly, just by smelling it. IMO, most German lagers 
benefit immensely from decoction mashing and I think it's worth the extra 
work. Besides, my wife loves the incredible malty smell of the mash and 
boiling wort! (She digs the doppelbock too.)

FWIW here is what in in "acid ale" i.e. Rodenbach 
 
   blended  old (Grand Cru) 
 
Ethanol   5.12-5.65 6.64-7.49 
lactic acid  1808-3296 4248-6272 
acetic acid  1155-1549 1511-2489 
 
>From : Microbiology and biochemistry of the acid ales of Roeselare

Roeselare is the town where Rodenbach is located.  So even though you don't 
taste vingar it is there. As I recall one of the Rodenbachs studied 
brewing in England and apparently learned about the storage of the beer in 
large wood vessles.  But at that time wood was the only material avaialble to 
make large tanks.

Subject: Help with small (<5g) batches


I have seen plenty of recent postings on big batches (15-30+), but have not 
seen any postings for newbrewers who might be looking to experiment with 
smaller batches. 
 
Currently, I'm doing 2.5 - 3 gallon extract batches; I want to experiment 
with various types and most of my friends are teetotalers, so 5 gallons is 
too much. Right now, I'm using a standard 6.5 gallon plastic bucket for a 
primary and then racking to a 3-gallon glass carboy for secondary 
fermentation. I like the oversized container for primary fermentation 
because I currently live in an apartment and the fear of an exploding glass 
carboy makes my security deposit wince, but I know that the additional "head 
space" (or more specifically, the oxygen in the headspace) in the bucket 
must be hurting my beer. 
 
Like I said, I am new to this (first batch should be bottle-carbonating as 
we speak), so general rules of thumb would be best. 
 
Responses via private e-mail would be fine, if HBD discussion isn't 
appropriate, and I will summarize for the HBD if necessary. 
 
Thanks,

     My question is: why is 20% crystal malt excessive? 
 
     I usually use about one pound of a combination of crystal malts along 
with 6 pounds of base malt (apx. 14% crystal). Is this too much?  Does it make 
a difference *which* types of crystal malt you use?  i.e., carapils vs. 120L 
English crystal?

Welcome to the homebrew-digest mailing list! 
 
If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list, 
send the following command in email to 
"homebrew-digest-request": 
 
    unsubscribe 
 
Or you can send mail to "majordomo" with the following command 
in the body of your email message: 
 
    unsubscribe homebrew-digest homebrew%hpfcmr`at`HPLABS.HP.COM (Ron Scammell) 
 
Here's the general information for the list you've 
subscribed to, in case you don't already have it: 
 
- - ----------------------------------------- 
 
Please note that there is now both a "digest" and plain version of the 
Homebrew Digest.  You have subscribed to the digest version. 
 
The Homebrew Digest: 
 
The purpose of the Homebrew Digest is to discuss the amateur 
production of beer, and includes all aspects of brewing. Though the 
main focus is on malt beverages (beer), we welcome discussions on 
homemade wine, mead, and cider, as well as other fermented (but not 
distilled) beverages. 
 
The Digest was founded by Rob Gardner in October, 1986, and I would like 
to thank him for creating this forum for homebrewers.  The Digest is a 
grassroots forum, deriving all content (and hence usefulness) from its 
subscribers. 
 
Frequency: 
 
The digest is sent out as soon as it has received sufficient articles for 
publication.  Currently that is about 1 issue per day. 
 
Submissions: 
 
If you would like to submit an article, simply mail it to homebrew`at`aob.org, 
and it will appear ("be published") in the next digest.  Please do not send 
any other items to this address, instead use homebrew-request`at`aob.org or 
shawn`at`aob.org for techingal problems. 
 
Guidelines: 
 
The digest is not moderated, edited or censored in any way, and so the 
overriding guideline for content is *constructiveness*.  Simply put, 
if you have something constructive to say, then it is welcome, otherwise 
it is not. If you have something to say that you wouldn't feel comfortable 
saying to somebody's face, then it is probably not going to be welcome in 
the digest either. And in agreement with standard network policy, crass 
commercialism is frowned upon.  Although the Digest is maintained by 
the Association of Brewer's computers, please do not expect the AOB or 
the American Homebrewers Association to be able to respond to every 
question. 
 
Messages with lines longer than 80 characters will be wrapped.  Messages 
longer then 8000 bytes, without Subject: lines and testing, subscribe, 
and unsubscribe messages to the posting address will be rejected. 
 
"Spamming" or very-off-topic commercial and other announcements will not 
be tolerated and violaters will be reported to their local postmaster 
for remedial Netiquette training. 
 
If a contributor does not adhere to this guideline, I suggest that he 
be deluged with *private* flames, since, as stated above, I will 
(hopefully) not censor digest content. In other words, government of 
the digest will be minimal, and the subscribers have to police 
themselves in order to maintain the digest's record of lots of signal 
and little noise. 
 
Back Issues: 
 
Requests to me for back issues, archives, cat's meow, instructions for 
ftp, etc., will be silently discarded. There are simply too many 
subscribers to provide personal service to each one.  Back issues are 
available from ftp.stanford.edu in the directory /pub/clubs/homebrew/beer 
and also http://alpha.rollanet.org on the web and majordomo`at`aob.org via 
e-mail. 
 
Other information on homebrewing is available through the Internet via 
http://alpha.rollanet.org on the world wide web, at "Beertown" at 
http://www.beertown.org/aob and via e-mail from info`at`aob.org. 
 
Other stuff: 
 
Remember that there are lots of redistribution points for the digest, so I 
may not be able to delete your address.  Remember to include your *name* 
in all requests so I have a better chance of finding you in the list. 
This is especially critical for change of address requests!  Remember that 
most correspondence sent to homebrew-request will probably not be answered 
unless specifically requested. 
 
Requests should be sent to the *request* address (homebrew-request), 
and articles should only be sent to the digest address (homebrew). 
Mixups between these addresses will be handled haphazardly at best, 
but probably will be ignored. If handled at all, they might generate a 
nasty response, since they add to my workload.  Please, please, check 
your reply address before mailing something here! Please limit the 
size of articles to less than 8k bytes otherwise they will be 
rejected.  Please limit line lengths to 80 characters, since not 
everyone has fancy displays. Also please limit the size of your 
signature to save valuable digest real estate, and try to give your 
articles useful subjects lines. Thanks for helping to make the digest 
better for everyone!
