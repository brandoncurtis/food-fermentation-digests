Subject: Re: Indoor Propane


Indoor propane appliances are quite common, in places with no natural gas 
utility such as rural areas. Clothes dryers, stoves, water heaters, space 
heaters, even refrigerators are propane powered. When properly installed, 
these things operate safely, indoors. 
 
BUT.. it is ILLEGAL to have a propane appliance on any level below ground 
level, due to the extreme hazard of catastrophic explosion. (i.e. whole 
house blows up). 
 
Before you blow yourself up, go to a reputable propane dealer and get 
their propane safety pamphlet.

<< Maybe a novice version of HBD is in order (HBDjr). >> 
 
Jesse (and other newbies nervously lurking out there), this is a forum for 
*everybody*.  Don't let the likes of you-know-who or anyone else prevent you 
from asking your "bonehead" questions.  Most of us (at least those who 
haven't yet acheived Brew-God status) are willing, even eager, to help 
newbies and seasoned vets alike.  The talk often gets technical and detailed 
but that's what makes it fun.  One day it hits you, that most of the posts 
actually start to make sense, and you realize you've learned quite a bunch 
here!  I came to this forum with 3 years time experience but far less than 
that in terms of what I really knew.  Brewed in a vacuum, so to speak.  In 
the year I've been here I've learned many times more than what I knew prior. 
 Far more constructive than those first years -- make a batch, scowl, curse, 
repeat.  I've solved "most" of my process-related problems and am (usually) 
making the kind of brew I always hoped I would.  For someone like yourself 
coming here at an early stage, you will have the collective wisdom of 
literally centuries of brewing knowledge at your disposal.  We wouldn't be 
here chatting if we didn't like this stuff. 
 
There are a huge number of good resources on the 'net for you to check out. 
 Without listing them individually, let me direct you to The Brewery 
(http://alpha.rollanet.org).  Lots of info an links, for beginners to 
professional brewers.  bound to bring up two new questions for every one that 
you had.

Subject: male hops


Hi all, 
 
I've heard the following about male and female hops during a lecture of 
prof. dr. de Keuckeleire (from Belgium, doctor's degree in hops!): male 
hops cause seeds in female hops (whow!) and those seeds contain oil, which 
have a negative influence on the formation of foam. According to prof. dr. 
de  Keuckeleire is this the reason why the male hops will be removed from 
the female hops. Can someone confirm this theory? 
 
Yours sincerely,

Subject: Carbonation


 
Hello fellow brewers, I am having a small problem that maybe some of you 
might be able to help me with. I have been brewing beer for around three 
years, and haven't had any major problems to speak about but this little 
one keeps happening. When I bottle my beer I always disolve 3/4 cup 
dextrose in 1 quart of boiling water and then add to my bottling bucket. 
I bottle and cap and put the bottles in my beer closet. The bottles 
carbonate at around 70 deg. F for three weeks and have great carbonation. 
When I put the beer in to the fridge to cool them down for drinking, I 
loose almost all of the carbonation. When I poor the beer I don't get a 
foamy head like I do when the beer is at room temp. I don't mind drinking 
my beer at room temp but I would also like to drink it cold and still get 
the rich foamy head. 
If anybody can help me out I will be very thankfull. I am getting tired 
of drinking cold flat beer. 
 
Thanks for any assistance in advance.

Subject: Propane, again/CO detectors/HBD usefulness


Guy Gregory states that the only concern about indoor propane use is leaks 
and explosions.  Not true. 
 
Cajun cooker style burners are not rated as being safe for indoor use.  The 
problem is carbon monoxide production which *can*  (note - not always) be 
produced at execessive levels.  I am unaware of any data on this, but I 
would assume that the "jet" style burners produce more CO than the cast 
burners. 
 
Gas leaks are a concern whether you are dealing with propane or methane, 
the only difference is where your house blows up (methane rises, propane 
sinks).  Many kitchen stoves run on propane safely, you just have to switch 
the orifices on the burners. 
 
On CO detectors:  Consumer Reports had a good write up on these earlier 
this year - worth checking out. 
 
HBD Usefuleness:  The only problem I see is routine 100 line posts with 15 
line signatures.  The volume doesn't bother me, but come one, KEEP IT SHORT 
AND TOO THE POINT!  Omit the history of your brewing experience - summarize 
briefly!   And if Noko Ono really bothered you, inform the 
postmaster`at`aol.com, don't rant at the collective (we probably agreed 
anyway!!)  No, I didn't get the pun in his logon name either.  <rant mode

Subject: RE: Conical Tanks


an addition to the ercent post on concial racking, the author 
mentioned that racking from the middle cone vale and switching over to 
the bottom valve.... 
 
another whay is to add a SS pipe that has a bend in itsuch that it may be 
twisted in the tank from the outside to rack from just above the  yeast 
in the cone..tough to draw it in ascii. 
 
 
this needs to be played with as to the length and bend angle to be adapted 
to the specific tank and the amount of yeast present in the tank, where the 
mid cone fittings and it's size (2"TC or..) are and the diameter of the tank. 
 
with this you attach a see thru hose or sight glass and rack bulk of the 
tank then as the level comes down start twisting the rack arm to follow the 
beer until it become more turbid, the quitthen discard the refuse yeast 
hopefull not to the sewer..... 
just another method

Subject: Decoction Mashing, Oktoberfest


     Just to put two more cents into my own question, last night I looked 
     back at the 1995 AHA NHC Gold medal recipes.  Of 7 beers that would 
     traditionally be decocted, 2 were.  The 1992 winners had no 
     decoctions, but there were also a bunch of extract brews.  1995 had 
     only two extract brews, and I think they were both partial mash 
     (barley wine & a fruit-type beer, lambic maybe?). 
 
     Jason (HuskerRed`at`aol.com) asked about the Oktoberfest celebration and 
     beer a couple of issues back. 
 
     Marzen is THE traditional fest beer.  The Oktoberfest as we now know 
     it has only been celebrated since 1810, when the first fest was held 
     to celebrate the engagement of Bavaria's crown prince. 
 
     Before then, the fest existed as a celebration of the reopening of 
     the breweries after the summer "off season."  In the days before 
     glycol-cooled cylindroconical fermenters, brewing was not usually 
     done year-round in Bavaria.  A strong beer was brewed in March (hence 
     the name Marzen, Marz=March) and was stored and consumed throughout 
     the summer.  The beer's high gravity enabled it to avoid infection. 
     At summer's end, the leftovers were consumed at one heck of a party! 
 
     The original Marzen must have been an ale (lagers weren't known until 
     the middle of the 19th century), and was probably less attenuated 
     then the modern fest beers (this is probably the case with most 
     "ancient" beers, because of poorly modified malt and poor temperature 
     control during the mash, amongst other things). 
 
     The first modern Oktoberfest was brewed by Spaten in Munich.  Similar 
     in color and grain bill to Vienna (i.e., lots of high-quality, 
     lightly toasted Munich malt), but brewed to a higher gravity  (low 
     60's; weaker than bock, but not by much) and lagered cold for 9 
     months.  In our time, fest beers are now of a somewhat lower gravity 
     (~1.1055) and are available year-round.  Spaten claims that they 
     lager for 3 months. 
 
     Modern Oktoberfest beer is usually copper colored (although there are 
     lighter examples), and is fairly malty with toasty notes.  Hop rates 
     are low, and the aroma is of toasty malt; no hop or ester fruitiness 
     should be present. 
 
     References for this have been books by M. Jackson and G. Fix, as well 
     as a source or two that I can't remember specifically! 
 
     Have fun!

Subject: HBD and The Web /Spent Grains in Bread


After following the bits of the various debates in the HBD, it really 
should be noted that many of these types of discussions can be taken 
care of through email with the person and not cluttering up valuable HBD 
space.  (like this message?) 
 
As such, I have edited the HBD2HTML filter and now include mailto: links 
on the contributor's article "From:" field.  Mind you, these will not 
always be perfect, but in many cases you can simply click on the link 
and mail the person instead of the digest. 
 
Of course this only works if your are reading the HBD from the htmlized 
versions available at http://alpha.rollanet.org/hbd/HBD.html and you 
have a web browser that supports the "mailto:" tag.  But from the stats, 
there are quite a few folks doing this. 
 
(as a side note, I've converted all HBD's from 1992 to present. When I 
get time I'll do the rest, but much of the data has been repeated since 
then and I'll wager lots of money that most of the email addresses are 
no longer valid in the older HBD's) 
 
Now, for some Brewing related stuff: 
 
Kevin Kane had asked about spent grains in bread.  A quick search 
generated a boat-load of hits, but these are 4 of the more interesting 
results:

In a Style article earlier this year, the author (Jay Hersh maybe?) suggests 
that a homebrewer can achieve some of the benefits of decoction by 
raising the temperature in a direct-fired tun by 1 degreeF/minute and 
stirring well.  (Don't remember what temps, probably protein rest temp 
to sacchrification temp).  He says the heat gives some of the benefits 
of a decoction including the darker color. 
 
Anyone tried this?  I tend to comprimise and use a single decoction when 
I make a German beer.  It isn't that much harder than my usual step mash 
and ads some maltiness. 
 
BTW, the style article was on Munich Dunkels, and the author says 
that, like most German styles, brewers use a double or triple decoction 
mash for Dunkels beers.

Well, it's worked for several years, during most or all of which the 
newsgroup was active, so there must be SOMETHING to it. 
 
> What use does this mailing list serve that cannot be

Well, until recently (cough cough) the HBD has been relatively free of 
the noise and nonsense of rec.crafts.brewing.  Additionally, it was 
geared more towards the more serious brewer, and/or the more mature 
poster.  It was, essentially, a little more exclusive, because one had 
to take the effort to subscribe, rather than just "wander in off the 
streets" as one often does in newsgroups. 
 
For example, the perennial "Anyone tried to make a marijuana beer?" thread 
pops up here once a year, and gets dropped within a few posts.  I haven't 
followed the newsgroup in two years, but back then it was basically ongoing, 
taking only an occasional two or three week break before someone else came 
in and started it.

I think that I skip about 60% of the digest daily, even when I have the time. 
Sometimes, I don't understand the topic, more often, I don't care.  I won't 
have the time/space/money resources for anything larger than a 5 gallon 
setup for a year or so.  I don't read the posts about RIMS.  They used to 
frighten me, but not longer.

First, it's hard enough to get someone to maintain one HBD, I don't know 
where you could find another.  Secondly, page-down syndrome is something 
you'll always have in HBD regardless of level of knowledge.  I suspect, also, 
you'd have it in any incarnation of an HBDjr. 
 
Second, I don't see the need for another digest.  I definately think that 
we can all modify our posting habits a bit, and provide proper encouragement 
over private e-mail for people with rudimentary questions.  (I try, as do a 
couple others I know.)  Some of this stuff is intimidating to anyone, and 
perhaps it should occasionally be re-emphasized that you CAN make good beer 
without a slide rule and a tesla coil. 
 
Still, the purpose of HBD is improving beer.  Some will tell you some easy 
and cheap things you can do, others will tell you some difficult and expensive 
things you can do.  I think there's a place for it all, and I think this is 
it.  Many of the novice questions have been asked time and again, but that's 
no reason to be afraid to ask them. 
 
Finally, I'm just not sure what you'd put in an HBDjr.  Would it be the same 
forty questions over and over, with the same 3 self-appointed experts 
answering them each time?  Maybe some kind of Brewing FAQ file would be more 
appropriate.

Subject: Re: Fruit Extracts


 
Brewthren: 
 
David Burley asks why not just use real fruit instead of extracts? I 
think once I set out to make a fruit beer from the start I will most 
definitely use the real McCoy. My primary concern at present is that I'm 
wanting to enhance a brew I've got ready to go in to the keg. From what I 
can tell, adding fruit is probably going to start another fermentation 
and, having already finished half of this batch (I brew 10 gal batches), 
I don't want to further raise the alcohol content. It seemed a good 
opportunity to test fruit extracts since the base beer (my first porter) 
was a little too lightly hopped for the style. At any rate, I'm going to 
try a strawberry extract, having remembered a most excellent strawberry 
porter at the invitational this past spring in Durham. We'll see what 
happens. That's what's fun about this hobby! Any suggestions are most 
certainly welcome.

        "Mr. Harwood's Entire" or "Entire Butt" and was first sold at a pub 
called the Blue Last..... 
        ....the publican called it porter, since porters were his best 
customers for the new beer." Foster "Porter", 1982, Brewers Publications, 
page 6. 
 
        Blending new beer and soured beer is the point there, ala Guinness, 
and many Belgians. I would hesitate to call his writing sloppy, based on one 
short article in a brewspaper, having never read any of his other stuff. 
(But I am looking forward to it!)

        Your report of stingy/numbing sensation made me think some light 
toxicity, but I called Spencer Tomb, Prof Plant Biology, KSU....He says it 
is probably Glecoma Hederaceae L., member of the mint family Lamiaceae. If 
it is, it was an import from Europe to the Eastern US, and that members of 
the mint family are not known for toxicities. The best way is to take a 
whole plant to your county agent for Identification. Failing that you may 
send one to me and He said he would identify it for you. His concern is that 
what may be considered a colloquial name for one plant in one part of the 
world may be colloquially known as something else in another part. I, as he, 
like the idea of it, but he says  that until positively identified, he 
wouldn't drink any.

        They are more versatile with the racking port, but are able to be 
used without, as well. I drop the yeast from the bottom, until it runs 
clear, then transfer to a secondary tank for fining /sedimentation, thence 
to bright beer servers. The racking port is most useful with filters for the 
reasons you explained. No matter that you can drop the yeast from the 
bottom, there is still a thin layer on the inner surface of the cone, that 
you can avoid by having your racking arm open to the center of the vessel 
and away from the walls.  I just installed racking arms to mine, but have 
used them without rackers for nearly 2 years now.

second question: i recently tried a Boulevard Wheat and UMM..UMM GOOD. does 
anyone have a recipe for this or thier pale ale? BTW, it is from a microbrew in
KC (Jethro Gump?) 
 
        Boulevard Brewing is a micro, this last year crossing the line to go 
above 25,000 BBL, just across the Kansas border in KC MO. Started by John 
MacDonald, they are on the verge of bursting out of their building, as they 
are only able to install one more unitank, before they have to go to the 
next step, a new facility that would produce the main lines and just use the 
old facilities for specialties. Nice folks, nice beer. 
        I have seen their recipe for Wheat, but when I looked I was more 
interested in how they laid out their brewing logs, what notations they 
made, etc.  I would never ask for more specifics. Sorry. I do recall they 
were dryhopping the PA, with whole EKG, but don't know if they are still 
doing it. 
        If you are going to be in the area, call ahead for tour info..very 
tasty tasting room, too!

Subject: Fruit Bitterness or Tartness


Greetings Brewsters, 
 
     Although I have not brewed a fruit beer, I have been thinking about 
doing one ever since I began brewing.  I've been reading recipes and pondering 
various things in search of something original.  I haven't seen any 
rhubarb beer recipes (but lots of rhubarb mead recipes) and that seems to 
be what I have the most of currently in my garden.  Actually it's coming 
out of my ears, and I'd like to use it. 
     My question is what must be considered in hopping due to an inherent 
bitterness in the fruit or its seeds (for instance, raspberry seeds). 
Does anyone have any ideas for hop type and boil schedule if one would 
like to use some of the bitterness already present in the fruit.

Subject: decoction/corrosion


collective homebrew conscience: 
 
thanks for the explanation of the corrosion on my temperature probe.  anybody 
else have more ideas about how to fix it other than paint/lacquer? just 
curious. 
 
re: decoction mashing.  i decoction mash all my lagers and weizenbiers, and 
the occasional altbier.  i believe my beers benefit from more intense malt 
flavors, and yes, i have done side-by-side comparisons.  i preferred the 
decoction-mashed beer(s). 
 
now, here's a question for all you decoction mash experts:  when the cold 
(rest) mash sits at protein rest temperature (122-131 F) for an extended 
time ( in my case, it sits a minimum of 90 minutes) while the decocting 
is going on,  what's going on in terms of protein degradation, and why 
doesn't this 
(oops)  have an effect on the body/head retention of the finished beer?  is 
it because the medium sized proteins in the decoction are preserved?  my 
decoction beers don't have a problem with body/hr, but i've often wondered 
if this is the correct answer. 
 
anybody out there having problems with maintaining sufficient mash liquor 
temperature during recirculation ( vorlauf )? 
 
someone asked about the siebel institute of technology in chicago.  they 
run ads in every issue of zymurgy, and offer a range of courses on different 
aspects of beer production.  312 279 0966 is the number to call.

Subject: potato beer/boiling gelatin/AlK and Wheeler's porter article


RE: Spud beer: 
 
Brian Bliss writes about malting potatoes and using them as a 
adjunct and Delano DuGarm replies: 
 
> I've never heard of malting potates, and always thought 
>that the sprouted ones had "gone bad." 
> The best reference I've found for potatoes is Brad Kraus 
>"This Spud's for You -- Potatoes as a Brewing Adjunct," _Zymurgy_ 
>17 (4) 78-81 (1994). 
 
 
Ahem.  The original authoritative article on brewing with potatoes was 
written by Carey Jensen back in the  April 1987 issue of the Foam Ranger's 
Brewsletter Urquell.  I reposted this article along with some of my own 
potato experiences back in HBD's 1365, 1369, and 1370 (March 1994).  I will 
leave it to any interested parties to retrieve those articles on their own.

RE: boiling gelatin 
 
Pierre Jelenc restates the truth: 
 
>Once and for all, please, gelatin is made by BOILING collagen FOR HOURS. 
>It is fully denatured. Everything that can happen to it has already 
>happened. 
 
It is worth noting that Don Put perpetuated this myth about gelatin in a 
recent issue (Vol 4, #1) of Brewing Techniques.  His article on clarifying 
beers stated that one shouldn't boil gelatin/water. I was surprised that no 
one write a Letter to the Editor on that one. Pierre? 
 
Of related interest is a tour that I took last summer of the Kind & Knox 
gelatin production plant in Sioux City, IA.  Train loads of cleaned cow 
bone chips are treated with base to extract the calcium.  What is left are 
basically small chunks of rubbery collagen.  These are treated with hot, 
then _boiling_ water to extract the gelatin (initial hot water extractions 
yield lower MW gelatin fragments, useful in some applications).  The 
gelatin solutions obtained then undergo ion-exchange treatment, 
concentration, and final drying and processing to yield dry gelatin.

RE: Wheeler's Porter article 
 
Wheeler (via Rob) writes: 
>Thus the original London porter was invented by the people of

and AlK responds 
>Among these many people is Terry Foster whose very well-researched

On the contrary, I do not agree that Foster contradicts Wheeler.  Go back 
and read pages 5-10 of Foster's book.  The last two paragraphs of page 6 
and the first of page 7 clearly indicate that Foster does _not_ believe 
that Harwood invented porter. 
 
 
Also: 
Wheeler also writes: 
>This is the Belgian Rodenbach, which has it's origins in 
>London Porter, and is itself a blend of a sour beer, stored for 
>18 months in large oak vats, and a relatively fresh beer that 
>is only a month or so old. 
>Furthermore they also sell the sour or "stale" beer on it's own, 
>under the name of Rodenbach Grand Cru. 
 
And AlK responds: 
>I question that Rodenbach is at all related to London Porter. 
>I would like to see some references for this statement. 
 
Peter Bouckaert, head brewer at Rodenbach, believes that there is a strong 
connection between the two. He stated that at the talk he gave at the Craft 
Brewers conference in Boston in April (apparently Eugene Rodenbach learned 
the art of brewing while in England in 1860, a time when porter still 
accounted for 3/4 of all of the beer drunk in London, according to Foster). 
 
For the full text of Peter's talk, go to 
 
http://alpha.rollanet.org/library/Rodnbch.html 
 
 
Also, AlK sez: 
 
> For the record, I personally get no acetic (vinegary) character 
>in either of the Rodenbach beers. 
 
You didn't taste the right bottle :-). 
 
Seriously, there is extremely wide variation from oak barrel to oak barrel 
at Rodenbach.  A member of our local homebrew club (Sarah White)had a very 
personalized tour of Rodenbach a couple of years ago.  She walked around 
the brewery with Peter, tasting samples from many of the 294 aging barrels. 
Sarah reported that the variation between aging tanks was fascinating, one 
would be lactic, another acetic, another like New England style cider. 
 
Al, you also didn't fully quote Wheeler, he clearly stated that the acidity 
of Rodenbach Grand Cru may be mellowed by extended aging - this is exactly 
the same discussion that has been going on regarding esterification in the 
lambic digest.  The Brett activity in the aging barrels may be enough to 
get the acetic acid level close to or below threshold 
 
>From personal experience, I can report that the Boston area had bottles of 
Grand Cru some years ago that was acetic enough to clean your teeth off. 
The more recent vintages have been much more restrained. 
 
Overall, I think that Al's objections to Wheeler's porter article were too 
harsh and generally unfounded.
