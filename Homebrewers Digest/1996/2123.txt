In hbd #2121 Chuck Wettergreen described making the bulkhead penetration 
on a Gott cooler.  No offense, but there is a lot easier way.  This has 
appeared here several times so I can't claim credit but apparently not 
everyone is aware.  Get a mini-keg rubber bung from a local homebrew shop 
and insert it in the hole left after removing the spigot.  No cutting 
or invalidating the warranty, as in Chuck's method, but I think easier. 
The hole in the bung is 1/2" and standard tubing fits without leaks.

Part of this variation might have been due to the fact that they are not all 
the same age. Each barrel was filled at a different time. But indeed the data  
does indicate a variation in the "old" beer and blending plays a key role in 
the taste fo the Grand Cru.  It also of course plays a role in the regular 
Rodenbach beer, which is a blend of 4 parts "young" beer and 1 part "old" beer 
according to the disertation I have.

Actually it is felt the acetic acid comes from acetobacter whcih grow at the 
air wort interface in the vats.

The data for the gueuze is about 20 years old.  Rodenbach does not have the 
large 2,3 butanediol concentration of gueuze since it has no initial enteric 
fermentation. The brewery only washes the yeast when the lactic bacteria count 
exceeds 5% (this is not a typo).  lactobaccillus and pediococcus are the two 
lactic bacteria involved.  Lacto initially (first 4-5 weeks) and pediococcus 
parvulus when the beer is in teh oak vats. 
 
 
the rate of lactic acid formation and acetic formation in the barrels varies 
but after 24 months they all reach about the same level (+/- 1000 ppm) ;-)

Subject: What is Aeration anyway???


HBDers, 
I asked this question on the HBD a few months ago and got the equivelent of a 
few dumb stares for responses.  With the talk about pure O2, Industrial O2 and 
polluted O2, I'll ask this again: 
 
 What does Aerating the wort mean?  The reason I ask is it seems all of us are 
doing different methods and calling all of them aeration. Me, I shake the shit 
out of the carboys til I get a nice head ontop.  Am I adding any more O2 than 
already was in the wort?  No.  Does it seem to help the ferment?  I guess so. 
Then some of you aquarium pump household O2 into the wort.  This surely is 
adding O2, but it isn't pure O2 is it? Then there are others who inject pure O2
from medical tanks or welding tanks. 
 
So what is it?  Am I shaking my ass off for nothing?  Does the yeast care what 
method is used?  If aeration means adding more O2 than is already in the wort, 
than why even shake?

If either of you would like to write a Letter to the Editor, 
I'd be happy to get it published as I think clearing up this myth--if 
it is a myth--would be an important byproduct of the column. 
 
ALL of the texts I consulted in preparing the article stated that 
gelatine shouldn't be boiled for use as beer finings.  I also talked 
to Knox--they are now part of the Nabisco company (800) 566-9435--and 
asked them why they only suggest preparing gelatin by "stirring over 
low heat until gelatine is completely dissolved."  The answer I got 
was that at "boiling temperatures the gelatin breaks down and results 
in incomplete setting once it cools."  Now, I'm not sure this would 
affect its fining properties, and I'm not a chemist, so I'd welcome 
any discussion by those more knowledgeable than myself.

Subject: Weddings: Average Beer Consumption


Greeting Brewmeisters: 
 
I'm busily brewing several batches of beer for a wedding (mine), and I got 
to second guessing the amount of beer needed for a large group of mixed 
company.  The bride and groom are pushing 40 (I like to think I'm in my 
'Brewing' prime...) and we are expecting about 175 at the reception. 
 
A young friend (25) of mine just got married and had 650 people at the 
reception (uh, I think they air-dropped the invites).  They drank 8 half 
barrels (of AB-type products, mind you).  Taking into account grandparents, 
little kids, non-drinkers, serious party-goers and all, I make it to be 
approx. 24 oz./person (yes, that's 2 12 oz. beers each, but it's regardless 
of whether they are drinking or not).  So, for my party, can I assume 
roughly 6 corny kegs?  Any of you folks have any experience estimating this 
sort of thing? 
 
Just for the record, I *am* making 6, but I also will have a half barrel of 
AB-type beer (required for the hall, and for the homebrew-challenged) as a 
buffer.  Also, I'm making all the beers in the 5% alcohol range (2 helles, 1 
rauch, 1 pale, 1 scotch (6.5%), 1 stout).  We'll probably have 2 cornys and 
the AB tapped at any one time. 
 
Also, Shawn:  I had a problem getting unsubscribed, and immediately 
resubscribed several times from the system also.  I seem to be back on now. 
I'll cross my fingers. 
 
Guess that does it for today.  Skol.

The current form of HBD is the only way I know of to get the type of

With all due respect, there is plenty of oil already in hops (as much as 
2.3% w/w or more in some varieties).  The aromatic qualities of the hops 
come from their oil.  Furthermore, there are quite a few seeded hops grown 
in the UK.  I don't think that the good doctor is right about this.  I 
have read that the reason that most growers don't want male hops is because 
they don't want the hops expending energy making seeds... they want all 
the energy of the hops going into making lupulin.  Another reason I would 
imagine <speculation mode on> that a hop grower would not want wild male 
hops around is because they are trying to grow a single variety of hop.  If 
say, their Saaz got pollenated by a Cascade it is possible that they could 
get some wild cross- breed growing amongst their Saaz... <speculation mode

How much headspace are you leaving?  If you have a very small headspace 
(less than 1/2" I would say) you can impede the carbonation of the beer. 
Beer will hold a lot less CO2 in solution at 70F than it will at 50F so 
when you open one at room temp, quite a bit more CO2 will come out of 
solution than if you open one at 50F.  The beer just holds more of the 
CO2 at 50F.  There will always be more apparent carbonation at room temp 
than at 50F. 
 
If your bottles are filled normally, then I would start to look for 
sources of measurement error: gallons of beer, ounces of sugar, etc. 
If you have 6 gallons of beer and think you only have 5, that can 
result in 17% less carbonation than expected.

Russ - The biggest recommendation I can make is to get there EARLY! This event 
is immensely popular, with locals and "pilgrims" alike. This year looks to be 
the biggest yet. I would also recommend getting the "package deal" when 
entering. This includes a souvenir mug, guide book, and several beer tokens. 
This is worth it just for the book alone - it's an excellent guide. 
A must try is the "Golden Rose" Brewed by Hair Of The Dog Brewing. Excellent 
bottle conditioned strong Belgian ale. Here's a short list of other great 
brew-pubs to checkout while you are here:  Lucky Labrador, Portland Brewing, 
McMennamins Edgefield, Bridgeport Brewery, any McMennamins (there is ~30 in 
the area - try the Hammerhead) I'd recommend against Norwester and Rock Bottom.
There is much better beer to be found elsewhere, IMO.

Subject: "Infected" Beer


A few things about beer now and in the past.  In the past most beer was 
fermented or aged in wood vessels of some sort. Studies have shown that wood 
even after cleaning and sanitizng with modern methods still harbors significant
levels of microorganisms.  Cider in England is still fermented in large oak 
tuns and the wood is infected with microorganisms that will survive in the 
selective environment of apple juice and cider.  Apple juice is usually 
contaminated with lactic acid bacteria. 
 
Rodenbach and lambic are modern examples of beers where the brewery is a 
microenvironment for a selective group of microorganisms.  They have the 
"right" infection.  But only certain microbes will survive in a brewery.  The 
wort is of a low pH and over time becomes alcoholic and anaerobic.  So not all 
organisms will survive in such a place. 
 
The same was prbably true in breweries of the past.  They probably had a 
certain level of "infection" with mainly lactic bacteria.  Beer was served as 
is caks ale today when it was relatively young.  Bacteria is inhibited by hops 
and thus kept in check.  When the lactic bacteria at Rodenbach is taken from a 
16 ibu environemnt (the level in the beer) to a 30 ibu environment their growth
is greatly inhibited.  But they will grow given enough time. 
 
Regarding stale beer well one man's stale bread is anothers croutons.  As 
others have said it is quite likely brewing in England in the past was somewhat
like brewing in Belgium today.  Wtih out analytical parameters it is hard to 
say what beer in the past really tasted like. Not to pick on Al, but here is a 
very good example of my point.  He says he can't taste the acetic acid in 
Rodenbach.  Well it is quite likely that some of the writers and historians of 
the past also had their own perceptual blind spots.  Thus we really don't know 
what "stale" beer was.

I'd like to convert a keg into a boiler, and have read many

we had exploding propane tanks up in the very high country where they had 
record snowfall and the
propane pressure regulators got frozen under a LOT of snow. Then they lost 
their seals and leaked a
lot of propane into cabins that ended up exploding, but we're just talking 
about small tanks inside
a basement aren't we? 
 
I say go for it Mike.

Subject: Re: Gelatine finings


I had a talk with Dr. John Dolphin, manager of R&D at Kind & Knox 
Gelatin, Inc. in Sioux City, IA concerning boiling and its effect on 
gelatin's gelling ability.  Here is what he told me: 
 
Gelatin is isolated from animal by-products. The exact process depends 
on the source of the gelatin (bones, skins, etc); here is the sequence 
from cow bones: 
 
1) The cleaned and chipped bones are treated with HCl.  This dissolves 
the CaCO3 away from the collogen (the Ca salts are reprecipitated as 
CaPO4 and used as animal feed). 
 
2) The rubbery pieces of collogen are treated with lime in order to 
hydrolyze primary amides.  This process takes up to 60 days. 
 
3) The material is then treated with various temperatures of water. 
The lowest temperature used is around 135 deg F, the highest is 
boiling (for up to several hours).  Each temperature pulls out 
different 'Bloom' ranges of gelatin.  The Bloom number ranges from 
~300 for the 135 F extraction to ~100 for the 212 F extraction (the 
number is a measure of the weight in grams it takes to depress the 
surface of a standard gelled mixture 4 mm, hence the larger the Bloom 
number, the greater the gelling ability). 
 
Food grade (i.e. 'jello') gelatin contains a broad range of Bloom 
numbers with a maximum around 250. 
 
4)  At this point the extracted gelatins are further purified, graded, 
dried, packaged, etc. 
 
Dr. Dolphin stated that boiling gelatin _can_ lower its Bloom number; 
however at neutral pH this is a slow process and boiling for a few 
minutes would have little if any effect.  He was very skeptical that a 
brief boil would significantly affect gelatin's fining ability.  He 
did say that boiling at a high or low pH could hydrolyze the protein 
bonds more rapidly and one should be careful in this situation (I 
infer from this that boiling gelatin in wort would degrade it faster 
than boiling it in water). 
 
Regarding Nabisco and Knox: Lipton is the former owner of Knox. 
They sold the production rights to Kind (of Germany) and kept the 
'Knox Gelatin' trademark for themselves.  A couple of years ago, 
Lipton sold the 'Knox Gelatin' trademark to Nabisco.  Nabisco does not 
produce gelatin, they buy it from other producers and repackage it. 
When you call Nabisco, you get their customer service reps.  They do 
not want you to boil their gelatin because they think that you may 
boil it for 30 minutes with fruit juice, ruin its gelling properties, 
and get angry at them.  They want to make things as easy and foolproof 
as possible for their customers! For the purposes of making a dessert, 
it is not necessary to boil gelatin, just heat it enough to dissolve 
it then chill it.  Dr. Dolphin said that if you pester Nabisco enough 
with questions they can't answer, they will eventually refer you to 
him or one of the other producers :-). 
 
Don, you are right that all texts state that one should not boil 
gelatin when using it for fining but I suspect that this is one of 
those old brewing beliefs that never got challenged and has just been 
repeated over the years.  I think that rather than say 'don't boil', 
texts should say 'don't boil for an extended period of time.' 
 
You might want to go back and look at Pierre's postings on gelatin 
in HBD's 1715 and 1716 for a nice explanation and an experiment 
which demonstrates the stability of gelatin in boiling water. 
 
Cheers, 
Steve

Subject: Blue Whale Ale


 
Greetings! 
 
I am looking for input on recipe formulation/evaluation/generally accepted 
brewing principles. 
A case study: 
In the summer issue of Zymurgy, there was a recipe listed for Blue Whale 
Ale.  It seems like an interesting brew to try, so I am contemplating 
brewing it.  I am troubled by the hopping schedule and how drinkable the 
beer would be.   For space's sake, I have only done a synopsis of the 
recipe.  If you would like the unabridged recipe and the rather novel 
fermentation instructions, drop me a line & I'll shoot it off to ya. 
 
8 lb Alexander's pale malt syrup 
1 lb 20 L caramel malt 
1 lb 40 l caramel malt 
 
Hop Schedule: 
1.25 oz Nugget (14.6%) for 90 min. 
1.25 oz Chinook (11.8%) for 90min. 
.75 oz Willamette (4.4%) for 20 min. 
.75 oz Centennial (10.3%) for 20 min. 
.5 oz Perle (6.6%) for 20 min. 
.5 oz Chinook (11.8%) for 20 min. 
1.75 oz Centennial (10.3%)  dryhopped in secondary 
 
Assumptions: 
A.  I calculated the IBU's to be in the neighborhood of 170 using both 
BrewWiz and by Papazian's formula in NCJOHB. 
B.  Pale Ale/IPA stylistic guidelines for bitterness  would be 30-70 IBU's 
max, according to Papazian and Miller. (Dave Miller, not the heart of the 
hops guys.) 
 
My questions are: 
1.   Did I figure the IBU's right? 
2.   If #1 is correct, will this be *way* overdone on the hops to the point 
of not being drinkable? 
3.   Am I placing too much faith in stylistic guidelines?  I know they are 
important when brewing to a style for entering in contests, but should they 
be used as a benchmark for evaluating a recipe before you brew? 
 
My gut tells me to keep the hop schedule but to reduce the individual 
amounts of hops.  I guess I'm looking for validation from some of our more 
experienced brewers! 
 
Thanks!

Subject: Two question about Noonan's _New Brewing Lager Beer_ 


        I've been reading Greg Noonan's revised and expanded book and came 
across two points that are contrary to what I had believed (no, they don't 
have anything to do with either mash temperatures or ester formation). 
 
        First, in discussing decoction mashing, Noonan writes that boiling 
the decoction "deoxygenates the mash", reducing hot side aeration.  (page 
135)  I had thought that boiling did nothing to reduce hot side 
aeration---if it did, why would aeration of the sparged wort be a problem, 
you could simply reduce it later in the boil.  Am I missing the point here? 
 
        Second, in discussing finings, Noonan writes that gelatin is not 
effective *unless* the beer temperature is dropped below 50 degrees F:  "The 
beer must be colder than 50 degrees F (10 degrees C) for gelatin to react 
with the ferment; the closer to freezing temperature the beer is, the more 
efficient the action of gelatin fining will be."  (page 195).  I realize 
that this book is geared towards brewing *lager* beers, still is Noonan 
correct about gelatin.  If so, I think a lot of us ale brewers are just 
wasting our time using gelatin to fine our beer.

Subject: RE: MORE Beta A - if you care.


(very briefly - and apologies in advance) 
 
1) David R. Burley in HBD #2118 writes that he only saw theory and 
   unrepresentative laboratory experiments in my post. 
 
]]'The Chemistry & Technology of Enzymes', Henry Tauber, 1949 
I had cited has commercial mash, enzyme assay vs time and temp data. 
 
2) He also argues that my experiment (yet to be posted) on a 70C 
   infusion mash should include protein rests and common brewing yeast. 
 
A protein rest clouds the beta-amylase activity issue and reduces the 
validity of the result, and shouldn't effect the apparent attenuation. 
Forced fermentation and the use of champagne yeast are well accepted 
means of determining wort fermentability. 
 
3) D.B. writes ... 
>I thought you were arguing that enzyme kinetics were abnormal with 
>exceptional temperature coefficients, 
 
'Abnormal kinetics' is David's term. There is nothing 'abnormal' about 
the two different kinetic models for activation and degradation.  They 
operate on two different mechanisms as explained in the post and 
references of HBD#2108. 
 
- --- 
 
David has recently ceased to post additional supporting information 
toward his point of view that beta-amylase survives substantially in 
'normal' mashes at 70C against the more accepted view.  The onus of 
proof is David's. It is David's task to provide evidence to refute the 
kinetic model, refute the rates, or propose an improved experiment, 
agreeable to both sides, which demonstrates his point. 
 
I've asked David that we take this discussion off-line until 
additional information and/or a resolution is available. If anyone 
else would care to be included in an email list discussion 
please drop me a (very) short note w/ a return email address.

Subject: longshot hazelnut brown ale


Darrin Pertschi wrote 
>>I recently enjoyed (REALLY ENJOYED) a Longshot Hazelnut Brown Ale. Can 
anyone recommend an appropriate amount of Hazelnut extract to use for 5 gal.? 
 
I am a new brewer and a lurker on the HBD for several months now. I am going 
to delurk to put in my 2cents in response to this question. the roundabout 
answer also involves confessing to a stupid brewer trick. 
 
I have been purchasing some of my supplies mail-order from Heart's in Orlando 
(no affiliation, just satisfied yatta yatta). In their catalog is the recipe 
(from one of their brew club members) that became  the Longshot Hazelnut. I 
decided to give it a try. The recipe calls for 1& 1/2 bottles (1 oz bottles) 
of the extract in a 5 gal batch. Well, I decided to go easy and use only one 
bottle of the two they sent. I had a batch of Porter that was also in 
secondary and my stupid brewer trick was that I mistakenly grabbed the wrong 
carboy and before I knew what I was doing, I had created a new, unintentional 
recipe for Hazelnut Porter (I know, I know, you can take that relax, have a 
homebrew a little too far!). 
 
 Anyway, I thought maybe it will be a fortuitous accident. The next week I 
went ahead and bottled the Nut Brown Ale with the remaining bottle of 
extract. To shorten this overlong story, after waiting a month on the Porter 
and 3 weeks on the Nut Brown Ale, I tried them and found the hazelnut extract 
flavor to be overwhelming in both. To my taste they are both almost 
undrinkable. Really a shame too, as the Porter tastes excellant otherwise. 
 
I am keeping both batches at the back of the storage area and plan on 
sampling from time to time in the hope that they will mellow. So my advice to 
Darrin would be to go really easy on the extract. 
 
And by the way, thanks to all of you for the HBD. As a new brewer, it has 
been by far my best source of information and inspiration.

Subject: Efficiency up from 25 pts to nearly 34 pts!


I fixed my lauter-tun efficiency problem that to the suggestion on HBD. 
I was using a rectangular 58 qt cooler with a 4 rod manifold as the 
drain.  The outer 2 rods ran were positiioned near the sides of the 
coller the the inner rods were near the middle.  This was giving me only 
25 pts extraction per lb of grain per gal of extract. 
 
AFter removing the outer 2 rods, my efficiency went to 33.5 pts.  I 
mashed 20.5 lbs of grain (most pale malt) with about 5 gal of water then 
sparged with 8 gal of water.  The temp in the grain bed was 75 C.  I 
collected 11 gal of wort at 1.064 OG!  This is the best I have got since 
switching from my 5-gal Phil's system. 
 
I assume what was happening was that the sparge water was going down the 
sides of the coller to the outer rods preferentially because of lower 
resistance.  By having only the 2 inner rods as drains, the liquid is 
forced to travel through the grain bed. 
 
Anyway, now it seems to work great. 
 
Thanks for all of the suggestion on how to fix it.

Things are going good.  I am building a 1/2 barrel brewery in the 
garage. I Found 1/2 kegs and 1/4 kegs for $10 EACH.  I bought 2 1/2 
barrels and one 1/4.  The 1/4 is for a brewpot when I make 5 gallon 
batches and the other two are for making 10 to 12 gallon batches of all 
grain beer. I will cut the tops out with a  plasma cutter and use them 
for mash, latur, and brew kettle.  These were bought at the local 
beverage store. I am going to brew my first 5 gallon batch of beer this 
sunday. 
 
The yeast is started and I have a 5 gallon steel Igloo cooler for a 
mash tun. I copied the JS easymash for the igloo cooler and am going to 
brew the  first ALL GRAIN batch in the 1/4   (7.5 gal) keg.  I owe all 
this to the HBD I have been reading it for about 3 months and have 
learned a lot.  Thank you all for the inspiration.  I will post how it 
comes out.
