Subject: Brewbecue!!


Hello All, 
 
The following is not *strictly* brewing related, but since it is 
Summertime and we are in the midst of grilling season, I thought 
that I would share with you all a fabulous recipe that I came up 
with for barbecued (excuse me, *Brew-becued) ribs. I made these last 
year at a brewbecue party, where everyone brought a sixpack of their 
favorite microbrew, and all of the food was prepared with beer as an 
essential ingredient. Let me know if you try these. 
 
BREWBECUED RIBS 
 
Purchase 4 lbs. of babyback ribs (a local butcher or a place like 
Sam's or Price Club will have these at a decent price). Prepare the 
following braising liquid: 
 
4 quarts of beer (or beefstock or a mixture of the two...I used up 
the last of a batch of light ale). 
3/4 cup cider vinegar 
1 TBSP paprika 
1 TBSP cayenne pepper 
1 1/2 TBSP ground cumin 
3 TBSP tabasco sauce 
several cloves of garlic 
1 TBSP ground ginger 
1 cup tomato paste 
1/4 cup honey 
1 TBSP salt 
several bay leaves 
 
Bring the braising liquid to a boil in a large pot. Reduce the heat 
to a simmer and add the ribs. Simmer the ribs until tender, but not 
falling apart (~1 hr 45 min). When they are done, carefully remove 
the ribs to a baking sheet. 
 
Rub the following paste all over the ribs (slather it on!!): 
1/4 cup garlic salt 
1 TBSP ground white pepper 
1/2 cup paprika 
1/4 cup dry mustard 
1/4 cup cider vinegar 
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 
1/2 cup beer (something nice n' hearty) 
 
Wrap the slathered ribs in foil and refrigerate (can prepare up to 3 
or 4 days in advance). 
 
When you are preparing for the feast (and oh, it will be a feast), 
get yer grill ready. NOTE: I have a Weber kettle grill, which I can 
clamp the lid on and allow the food to be cooked over indirect heat. 
Also, I have found that lump hardwood charcoal works the best. Give 
it a try if you can find it (a local hardware store or a lawn and 
garden shop will carry it), and I'm certain that you'll never go 
back to Kingsford Briquettes again! 
 
Anyway, while the coals are getting ready, soak several handfulls of 
hickory or mesquite chips in *beer* (again, something big and bold). 
**THIS IS A KEY STEP***You will be amazed at the flavor that beer 
soaked hickory chips will add. Let 'em soak for about a half hour. 
 
When the coals are ready, drain the beer-soaked hickory chips and 
place them on the fire. Put the ribs on the grill, slather them 
generously and frequently with the following brewbecue sauce, close 
down the lid, and let them go for 15-20 minutes or so, turning them 
and slathering them with sauce often until they get tender and a tad bit 
charred. Serve ribs with lots of napkins, and of course, plenty of homebrew. 
 
BREWBECUE SAUCE 
3 TBSP canola oil 
1 med onion 
1 cup chili sauce 
1 cup ketchup 
1/4 cup steak sauce 
1 TBSP Worcestershire sauce 
several cloves freshly pressed garlic 
1/4 cup prepared horseradish 
3 TBSP dry mustard 
Cayenne pepper to taste 
2 TBSP tabasco sauce 
1 TBSP molasses 
1 TBSP cider vinegar 
2 16 oz. beers (something big again) 
Heat oil in a large pot and add garlic and chopped onion. Let 
cook for about 10 min or so, until onion becomes soft and transluscent. 
Add remaining ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat for 30 
minutes or so until it gets nice n' thick, stirring often. 
 
Sorry for the bandwidth, but I've been dying to share this recipe, 
and I know that there are a lot of you out there that will love to 
try this. 
 
Bon apetit!!

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager... 
 
In HBD 2124, George De Piro comments on the good Dr. Fix's comment in Vienna 
et al regarding hop pellets... 
 
I think what was meant by the comment, is that since lll the lupulin glands 
are already pulverized, pellets do not need a long boil to get full 
utilization; therefor, you can make due with a single addition later in the 
boil to gain the benefits of both bittering and aroma hopping. 
 
As with George's (De Piro) experience, this is not congruent with mine. 
(Congruent! What a woody sound! Not tinny like "like"...) 
 
See ya!

Subject: RE: Decocting, wyeast to blame for bananas, iodine on fruit


     Tom asks several decoction questions.  First, I am no wizard (as 
     he states), but I have decocted a lot.  He says that his Vienna 
     malt beer was not as malty as expected after a triple decoction. 
     His extract efficiency seemed pretty low, too. 
 
     Perhaps your pH was off, causing inefficient conversion.  Perhaps 
     the quality of the Vienna malt was low.  Was it made from 2-row 
     pilsner-quality grain, or a lesser barley? 
 
     I've noticed a tremendous increase in the maltiness of ALL my 
     beers (even single-step infusion batches) when I started caring 
     more about my malt source.  I have found Ireks and Munton & Fison 
     to be of good quality.  I'm sure there are many others, but those 
     are two that I like. 
 
     As for the idea of not sparging to increase maltiness, I don't 
     quite get it.  I don't have full net access, and therefore can't 
     see your reference, but it seems wasteful (even at the level of a 
     homebrewer).  Also, my current system couldn't handle the amount 
     of grain it would take to make a 1.060 beer without sparging. 
     What does it matter if you sparge, as long as you hit your target 
     gravity? 
 
     As for what happens to the main mash during rests, it's just what 
     you think.  Enzymes continue to do what they do so well!  Perhaps 
     in the days of poorly modified malt enough starch was tied up in 
     the grain so that a significant amount of conversion would take 
     place after adding the decoct back to the main mash.  I have 
     found (just in my kitchen, mind you) that while the decoct does 
     yield a positive iodine test once it approaches boiling, that 
     starch is NOT concentrated enough to make my iodine test any more 
     than weakly positive once it's added back to the main mash. 
 
     My point is that if you want a less attenuated beer, keep the 
     rest mash at a higher temp because you're not going to add back 
     enough unconverted starch after the decoction to make a big 
     difference in wort's fermentability, even if the post-decoction 
     rest is 158-160F. 
 
     As for triple decoctions, I don't think they're really necessary 
     these days (heck, I've been questioning the necessity of 
     decocting at all!).  In Eric Warner's and Darryl Richman's books 
     on specific styles (Weizen & Bock), they point out that few 
     German breweries still use triple decoctions.  It costs $$$ in 
     time and energy, and malts today are well modified enough that it 
     is not necessary for increasing conversion efficiency.  In my 
     kitchen, I get no appreciable difference in efficiency whether I 
     decoct or do an infusion. 
     ------------------- 
     Greg asks if Wyeast is to blame for his banana beer.  While it is 
     possible, I would first examine your own procedures more closely. 
     At the risk of rekindling the aeration thread, did you aerate 
     adequately?  I have posted that some strains (Wyeast 1028, for 
     one) produce a plantation of bananas if not adequately aerated. 
     Also, how warm was your fermentation?  Did you underpitch?  Were 
     you blasting "Single Finger Salute" while fermenting (sorry, Greg 
     should get it!)? 
 
     As an aside, I it's not necessary for you to "mash" your crystal 
     malt; the maltster did that for you!  Just steep it at less than 
     boiling temp. and your all set (there aren't any active enzymes 
     left in crystal malt). 
     ---------------------- 
     Al K. asks about sanitizing his fruit.  While I'm not up on my 
     basic chemistry (yeah, even though I'm a science-type.  Ask me 
     about chromatography, or dealing with the FDA...), I believe that 
     15 minutes in iodine would render the fruit inedible.  At the 
     very least it would taste awful.  Chemistry aside, you'll never 
     be able to rinse off all the iodine that has permeated the fruit! 
     Just accept the sourness that comes with most fruit beers.  You 
     can take sanitizing too far...(besides, the instructions say that 
     ONE minute contact with the iodophor is adequate).  Just because 
     the stuff is rated "drip dry" doesn't mean you should eat it! 
 
     When you let iodophor air dry, the iodine is evaporating!  It 
     doesn't end up in your product! 
 
     Have fun!

In-Reply-To: The letter of Thursday, 25 July 1996 1:34pm ET 
 
Sorry if my posting from a Casemail system where I work clutters the bandwidth 
with cumbersome headings, but I hadda try posting from work (for the lack of 
anything better to do :-> 
 
Anyway, on the subject of fruit beers, I've had good luck using frozen 
concentrated juices (100% pure) for fruit flavorings. 
 
I made a 50/50 Wheat brew (Apple Wiezenheimer) by throwing 12oz of FCAJ into 
the cooling wort.  It was quite pleasant, and didn't last as long as I thought 
it would.  After reading Papazians advice in _Homebrewers Companion_, and 
desiring to make a lighter colored brew, I'm going to add the uFCAJ to the 
secondary, and use an extra pale ME, a short boiltime, and add a "tea" of 
preboiled hops (I've been brewing ~1 year, and am just now considering 
moving up to partial mashes).  Any comments?  All flames welcomed at 
fouches`at`mail.iserv.com 
 
I feel compelled to offer a suggestion to Mike Caprara in referance to his 
condensation problem.  Ahhh, now were getting into my specialty- retrofitting 
and jerry-rigging, especially on a budget:  Thaw out your Hall-'o-Famer 
Fridge,warm it up, and glue 1/2" expanded polystyrene insulation panels to the 
inside and outside of the freezer compartment.  No cold surfaces = no 
condensation. 
 
If, for some bizarre reason that doesn't work, get some new friends, 'cause 
turning up your nose at homebrew, FOR ANY REASON is even more bizarre.  That's 
just sick and wrong. 
 
I think it was Benjamin Franklin who said "Beer is proof of God's existance, 
and that He loves us, and wants us to be happy" 
 
That is all

Greeting Fellow HBDer's, 
 
After an interesting discussion with a far more experienced and learned 
brewer, I have become very interested in having more precise control 
over my mashing temperatures.  Does anyone know of an online source for 
back issue articles from Brewing Techinque's?  Robert McIlvaine (sic) 
had a 3-part series on mashing temperature monitoring and computers in 
the early part of 1995 maybe Vol. 1,2,3 or 1,2,4.  Also any opinions 
from anyone who put the info from the articles into practice would be 
greatly appreciated. 
 
Thanks all, brew on...

<I have conducted a triple decoction on 100% Vienna malt and not

First thing to ask is whay kind of Vienna malt did you use?  Briess 
is a very different malt than Durst or Weyermann, 6 row vs. 2 row. 
Secondly, how much hops and what type did you use.  I feel a major 
factor in intensly malty beers is the absense of hops, keep the 
IBUs below 20 if its malt you are after. 
 
Ive been drinking a lot of double decocted Festbiers made with 
Vienna malts and the malt foundation is amazing. 
 
Good luck!

PS: Briess Vienna malt does make a nice malty beer but it is just 
different in the malt character from the European malts.

>>> 
All household uses of propane, leave the tank outside, and all housing codes 
INSIST that all apliances be above ground level. (propane sinks in air). 
 
If you, Mike, are setting up in your basement, for the cost of the propane 
cylinder and a couple of refills, just have your plumber add a gas line over 
to your brewing bench. ( I assume the heat & hot water are just behind you) 
MUCH safer and up to code. If you know how to use gasline pipe dope, 
you can do it yourself for the cost of the pipe and end fitting ( a lab type 
valve) 
 
hope this helps, NOBODY should use propane in the basement! Just a small 
leak could pool in a depression and migrate over to the hot water heater 
pilot. 
Can you say BOOM !!! ;-)

The reason for the codes keeping propane appliances  out of the basement, 
is because a resort in Park City UT was blown all to hell.  The leak was 
not inside the building but rather at the propane tank which sat on a 
hillside above the building.  The leaking gas flowed down the hill, through 
a leak in the basement wall and was ignited by a pilot inside the building. 
As I recall several people were killed in the accident. 
 
Since then, I have been careful to keep propane away from any area where it 
can flow down and then build up in a depression.

Subject: RE Fruit Flavorings


A quick data point here.  I've brewed a raspberry ale several times and 
originally used the raspberry extract that was available from several berw 
shops.  The resulting beer was serviceable, but lacked the fruit character 
that I was after. 
 
I finally bit the bullet and used real raspberries, and the difference was 
substantial.  A brilliant ruby hue was added to the beer as well as 
substantial raspberry aroma and flavor.  I found these characteristics to be 
lacking in the extract version of the same beer. 
 
Real fruit can be a PITA, is messy and can result in violent and erruptive 
fermentations (can you sense a story here ;-{> ), but is well worth the 
effort IMHO.  I'll never go back to the extracts again - I'd like to try the 
real fruit concentrates but have been unable to find them locally.  Does 
anyone have a source for these extracts?  Does anyone know if the company in 
Oregon (sorry can't recall the name) that sells extracts will sell in 
homebrewer quantities?

Subject: Blue Whale Ale


Let me issue a STRONG word of caution when making this brew... 
 
HopTech sells this in kit form and I was one of the (suckers) customers 
who thought it sounded like a neat beer to try.  Now, I consider myself 
a hop head, but this, this, is WAY too much!  It's the first beer that I 
have made where no one has been able to finish a whole one (except me, I 
can barely make it thru one). 
 
The beer is extremely bitter and has a strong citrus/grapefruit taste to 
it.  The only thing good I can say (and this is kinda gross) is that I 
like the way it tastes after a good belch. 
 
A while back I also got mail from someone else who made it and they said 
the same thing, so it's not just me... 
 
So if you brew it, go easy and leave out the hops that produce the 
grapefruit sensation. Not sure which one it is, I saw it mentioned here 
recently though... 
 
Happy brewing!

Subject: Why Not Aluminum?


I have heard that it is best to not use Aluminum to boil your wort.  I 
only recently found this out, and I have to say that I boiled my last 
batch in a coated aluminum stock pot that I had handy.  Could somebody 
please clear this up for me?  Do I need to purchase a stainless steel 
stockpot? 
 
Note:  My stockpot is not raw aluminum, it is coated with a black 
material. 
 
Any info will be greatly appreciated,

Subject: RE: Iodophor for fruit sanitization


In HBD #2125 Al K. asked about using Iodophor for sanitizing fruit. 
Several years ago when I was in Lima, Peru, several restaurants touted 
their salad bars as having vegetables which had been washed in iodine. 
I was told this was to prevent typhoid due to polluted irrigation water. 
Indeed, one of the people I worked with told me that a friend's maid had 
died from eating contaminated strawberries. 
I don't know if the source of the iodine for food treatment was Iodophor, 
but it sounds like a good idea.

     Glad to see I'm not alone in my experience.  Because I tend to 
get a little fanatical about clear beer but am not equipped to 
either lager or filter, here is what I do: 
 
     After about seven days in the primary, I add a half cup of 
bentonite slurry mixed with polyclar to the *primary*.  The 
polyclar brings enough CO2 out of suspension to purge any oxygen in 
the headspace.  After a few hours, I agitate the primary to allow 
the slurry to mix well with the beer.  Within a day or two, a lot 
of gunk settles out to the bottom. 
 
     I then rack to my secondary (a five gallon carboy) on top of 
a solution of gelatin (heated not boiled) and polyclar.  After 
that, I add a fermentation lock filled with cheap vodka (since 
there tends to be some suck back due to the change in temp), and 
place the carboy in my bottling bucket filled with a mixture of 
about 8 pounds of ice and water.  This gets the temperature of the 
beer down into the 40's and seems to settle out a good deal more 
yeast and other gunk. 
 
       After a day or so, I remove the carboy from the bucket and 
let it continue to ferment at room temperature (about 70 degrees F) 
for another week. 
 
     The beers I have bottled after this treatment are very clear-- 
- -even only one week after bottling.  Much better than I brewed when I used 
gelatin at bottling or didn't use the force chilling.  My final gravities 
have been below 1.010 too.

I've noticed that the addition of certain dark and/or crystal malts can help 
immensely in this regard. Furthermore, as others have noted, with certain 
malt combinations it is possible to come "damn close" even without a 
decoction. A touch of Munich, caravienne, and/or caramunich works wonders in 
my experience. Using pale ale malt with these crystal malts and a single 
infusion I've made at least one beer that smells and tastes like it was 
obviously decoction mashed. When a decoction mash is combined with these 
crystal malts in my brewery, the beer produced is consistently quite malty.

I don't know, I've never tried this myself.

Hmmm, Brit Ale yeast, eh? What was your pitching rate and how did long you 
aerate/oxygenate the wort? Also, what was the fermentation temp? Was it fast 
and furious or long and slow? Low pitch rate and no aeration will usually 
produce esters with most yeast strains. Over-aeration may also increase 
esters, particularly when under-pitched. High temp is another potential source.

Subject: Wedding Beer Recap


Top of the afternoon, Brewmeisters, 
 
Thanks for all the splendid responses to my question regarding how much 
homebrew to make for a large party (ie. wedding reception).  Most people 
that responded seemed to confirm my plan of 6 corny kegs with an AB-type 
half-barrel backup for 175 people.  Many responders noted that there are 
several variables to consider when planning for a large party: 
 
1)  # of people who choose not to drink (including children, elderly, and 
designated drivers) 
2) ratio of homebrew challenged/polite tasters/serious home-brew afficionados  
3)  length of party 
4)  will the beer be dispensed via air or CO2? (if air, it must all be 
consumed with in a couple of days, or be wasted) 
 
I think that most weddings (at least the Midwestern ones I've been to) are 
affected by a similar 'mix' of the above variables.  The consensus of 
opinions was that 24-30 oz. per person would be consumed per person at a 
wedding reception of around 4-5 hours.  Thanks for all the responses and 
kind comments. 
 
Skol.

Subject: NG brewers unite!


 
        Can anyone recommend a good NG burner? 
        I ran a gas line in my basement and set up a burner from the 
     Northern catalog designed for propane with the oriface drilled out to 
     the proper NG size.  However the combustion is *poor* resulting in a 
     mostly yellow flame with lots of soot.  I have a fan blowing across 
     the top of the boiler out a nearby window and this setup only elicits 
     two or three chirps from the CO detector (indicating a warning but not 
     an alarm) during the session.  However I'd like something cleaner, 
     with better flame control and (of course) with less CO. 
        Can any other NG basement brewers give me a hand? 
 
        Thanks -   Joe

Subject: Fruit Fresh


Brewsters: 
 
Jim Layton calls me to task regarding the contents of Fruit Fresh.  I'll take 
your word for it, I haven't bought FF in years. My recollection is that it did 
contain sulfites and maybe that's why they now put "contains no Sulfites" on 
their label. My point was, however, ( do I write so poorly that people 
misunderstand me?)  that bisulfite does two jobs it sterilizes the fruit AND 
slows down the browning (which is where the FF reference came in) until the 
yeast can get to producing a protective layer of CO2 it. I NEVER said I used FF
to sterilize my fruit.  If that is the way it looks I apologize. 
- ---------------------------------------------------------- 
As far as when to put fruit into a fermentation I agree with an HBDer (lost the
reference, sorry) it should go in after the majority of the beer ferment has 
subsided. I recommend putting it in as a wine type extract using beer yeast to 
ferment it and remove most of the pulp before adding it. I'm sorry, but being  
a chemist, and an industrial one at that, I don't trust "fruit" extracts,as 
healthy as they might be and as delicious as they are. I drink cherry soda pop 
that never saw a cherry and root beer that never saw a root. So I don't have a 
fear of the artificial. Even if the extracts are from 100% pure fruit, how can 
they be as good as the fruit itself?   Real fruit flavors are so much more 
complex than those cooked up in a vessel that I prefer to use them.  Taste 
pineapple flavoring and Hawaii pineapple vs Mexican or Phillipine pineapple and
you will understand my point. Go to the store and buy three different kinds of 
apples and taste them side by side, the difference may astound you. My point 
isn't that good beers can't be made with fruit extracts it is, given this 
marvelous availability of fresh fruit with complex tastes, why would you use an
extract? 
- ------------------------------------------------------------ 
Steve A.  I thought we agreed to pursue this issue via e-mail until we gain a 
mutual understanding, rather than you publishing and me sitting quiet. What is 
your real purpose here?

I only got one response (thanks Adam) so... when all else fails, find out 
for yourself. I called Amicon Tech. support and picked their brains. 
Amicon makes all types of ultrafiltration membranes for science applications. 
Here's what I found out. Their 10,000 MWCO(molecular weight cutoff) 
membrane is 10 Angstroms, the 100,000 MWCO is 100 Angstroms....she said 
1 million = 1000 Angstroms or 0.1 microns, and she thought the 
relationship was linear. So.... 10 million MWCO is 1 micron. A 5 micron 
filter would only filter out globular proteins with molecular weights of 
greater than 50 million. That's a pretty big protein, IMHO. I had a look 
at the article above and they mentioned using a relatively new method known 
as field-flow fractionation to characterize the glutenin proteins, and 
came up with molecular masses in the 20 million range. That should still 
pass through a 5 micron filter. I think I saw somewhere that yeast are 
about 7-10 microns. So my conclusion is you can filter your beer through a 
5 micron filter and remove the yeast and any remaining trub and not have 
to worry about filtering out any of the other "flavor" proteins.
