Subject: oak chips


A question for the group at large. 
 
I just purchased some American White Oak Chips (I think typically used in 
wine making) and would like to try to emulate the flavor of cask 
conditioned beer such as Fuller's ESB. My question is the quantity as well 
as the stage. I imagine it should be used in the secondary fermenter 
similar to dry hopping. However, I don't know the appropriate amount and 
procedure. Thanks in advance!

Subject: Herbs in beer - Gruit


I want to add my experience with using unusual ingredients in beer. I 
made an "Ancient Gruit Ale" a year ago; my goal was to make a high 
gravity sweet spiced ale with a mix of spices to balance the sweetness. 
 
The complete list is at home, but some of the more interesting 
ingredients included: 
* Roast dandelion root, which adds some astringency and a mild earthy 
  flavor. 
* Nasturtium leaves and flowers, for their peppery flavor 
* Cranberry puree, for sourness 
* Ginger, as a good all-around spice 
* Cardamom, generally useful 
* Thyme, cloves, rosemary, other stuff... 
* 1/2 oz high alpha hops 
 
I added many different types of malt, as well as boined oatmeal. The 
original gravity was 1.070, final gravity was 1.020. The brew is still 
aging, but it worked out pretty well. Watch out for ginger, as I used 
too much. More dandelion root and cardamom would be OK.

Subject: Blue Whale Ale is GOOD beer!!


IMHO the people who are mystified over Blue Whale Ale (from Pacific 
Coast Brewing Co.) let me say its some pretty damn good stuff!! One 
person suggested that they couldn't drink a whole one. if so, then 
they need to redefine HopHead!!. 
 
That said, I haven't made a recipe from scratch yet, but the kit 
which HopTech was selling was pretty close to what you get at the 
pub. 
 
I talked to Don Gortmiller last year and he had told me that it was 
going to be appearing in Zymurgy, so he did get a hand in the recipe 
on his own beer. 
 
Yes, this is a very hoppy beer, but then most of their beers are. 
 
All I can do is to suggest to make a batch. If you feel you've got to 
cut the hops, just do it IN PROPORTION to the decrease.  (meaning if 
you feel you must cut hops cut them 10%, or whatever figure, accross the 
board).
Personally I'd go for it and follow the recipe! 
 
If ever in the SF Bay Area, make sure you stop by and try one.

Subject: Filters, Aluminum, BATF


At last a topic that I know something about, filtration of beer. I have spent 
a great deal of the last 4 years filtering beer. On the issue of filter size. 
A beer is not considered to be yeast sterile, that is completely free of 
yeast at any nominal filter size greater than 0.8 microns. There is a very 
wide range of size for yeast, several microns for clumps, chains and budding 
cells to close to submicron size for daughter cells ( as well as some misc. 
bacteria ) The effect of filters on proteins and colour is more complex than 
just a matter of particle size. The finishing filters used by many bottling 
breweries ( micro and mega ) rely in part on zeta potential. That is the 
electrical charge of the particles in the beer is attracted by the opposite 
charge in the filter. Breweries like these filters as they are regeneratable, 
and have great deal of useful life. High resolution charged particle filters 
can visably strip colour from beer. They also tend to remove head retaining 
compounds. This is a line that many breweries have to walk, beer stability vs 
foam stability. ( Some of the megas use alginates and sodium benzoate to 
improve CO2 retention ) Most craft brewers go for less severe fitrations, but 
still yeast sterile. I have not noted even on filtrations as fine as 0.4 
micron nominal a change in body or mouth feel from coarse ( 3-5 micron ) fine 
filtrate samples. 
         Aluminum for brew kettles? It has been asked several times recently. 
I say go for it. Aluminum is pretty much non reactive at the ph range for 
wort and fermented beer. It has good heat transfer properties and should be 
less expensive than stainless for the homebrewer. I would however avoid 
strong alkali cleaners as they will corrode the aluminum. 
       My two cents on the BATF. Over the last few years I have had to deal 
with the BATF on many occasions. For the most part all of their people have 
been polite and helpful, often going out of their way to find accurate 
answers to my questions. The brewery that I work at is in the largest BATF 
revenue district in the country ( lots of very very big wineries and 
distilleries) the few breweries in district contribute virtualy no excise tax 
by comparison, yet still get good service from the BATF. No shooting.

Subject: Piss Yeller (duck, weave)


Due to several personal e-mail requests I would like to post the recipe 
for Piss Yeller mentioned in a previous posting to the HBD collective. 
Its not real involved unless you want to add a double decoction mash to 
bring out the malt flavor (a la Warsteiner). 
 
To Make 5 Gallons, 
 
6 lb          Belgian Pilzen Malt 
2 1/2 lb     Wheat malt 
1oz 4.3%  Willamet Hops 
1/2 oz       Saaz Hops (adjust to taste) 
Wyeast #1056 American Ale Yeast or Coopers dry. 
 
OG - 1.048 
FG -  ~1.012-1.007 depending on yeast 
Strike 10 qts at 126 deg. F and protein rest at 120 to 123 deg. for 30 to 
45 minutes. Increase to converstion temp of 150 to 155 and hold for 45 
minutes or until iodine test is negative. (Decoction mashing procedures 
single or double can be used instead) Be sure to mash-out at 168 deg. for 
5 min. this will help prevent a slow or stuck sparge (why I don't know but 
every time I brain cramp and forget to mash-out the sparge runs poorly) 
Sparge with 5 gallons of 168 deg. water and collect.  Boil 90 minutes 
adding Willamet at start of boil and add the Saaz at end of boil (about 10 
minutes). 
 
This beer benefits greatly from a week or two of cold laggering in the 
bottle after carbonation.  The color is lighter than Sam Adams Boston 
Lager and the flavor is somewhat similar.  I've got to admit, I started 
brewing this for my wife and some of our less beer "aware" friends but I 
really enjoy it myself also. 
 
The philosophy behind this beer is basically this; to brew a lager-like 
ale that most people would recognize as "beer" and have the taste 
characteristic lesser beer-educated Americans associate with beer.  The 
wheat is to serve the purpose of rice or corn in American beers and 
"lighten" both the color and the mouth-feel.  Fortunately, malted wheat is 
not an adjunct according to the Reinheitsgebot and this is still an 
all-malt beer. (Sharon is of German descent and enforces the purity law) 
The Saaz hops give the beer a flavor that most educated beer palets will 
associate with a lager or pilsner beer, Ive found that the Saaz flavor 
needs some mellowing time.  I also carbonate this beer a little more 
heavily than most ales (I add a cup or a cup and a quarter of corn sugar 
to 5 gallons at botteling time).  Once again this is to imitate the 
heavily carbonated nature of American beers.  Hope you enjoy it, please 
let me know how it turns out if you brew it. 
 
DUCK / WEAVE 
 
Sorry about the ramblings on the BATF but I'm a little sensitive on this 
issue and found myself sending the message without filtering, or even 
allowing it to drop bright.  Remember, there's no failsafe on the e-mail 
send button.

Subject: Super-Quick Fermentations


I've got a question that I am sure you have heard before, but I am compelled 
to ask it anyway.  I have been brewing for about two months now, and I have 
just started five gallon batches.  I have as of yet completed two, and they 
both have fermented 
extremely quickly.  Within eight hours there is appreciable fermentation going 
on, and by 40 hours there is only a very small amount of noticeable 
fermentation.  IOW, there is very little bubbling.  From sources I have read 
(books, WWW pages, etc.), I was under the impression that it would take quite 
a bit longer than this to ferment.  Any ideas? 
 
FYI, I am using Munton dried yeast, which I rehydrate in 100F water for 20 
minutes.  I pitch it into my cooled (~74F) and aerated (shaken, not stirred) 
wort.  Should I be using liquid yeast?

Subject: Brew Sans Starter & Too Cold for Yeast?


Hi. I'm a professional wine maker but an amateur brewer (ie I do both for 
fun but don't get paid for the beer!) and am very pleased to have discovered 
this mailing list as I don't live anywhere near a group of other homebrewers 
I can talk to. 
 
Jim Anderson asked: 
 
<What's the best way to pitch a batch when you don't have a starter 
<prepared? 
 
and 
<I just did my morning check and it turns out I've got another question 
<now.  The neighbor kids have apparently found another toy to play with 
<- -- my thermostat (the frig is beneath my carport, right along our common 
<fence).  I had a batch of Grand Cru in the secondary at 65F (Wyeast 
<1056).  This morning, the internal frig temp was 38F (the Fermometer on 
<the carboy showed 40F). 
< 
<Did my yeasties get killed through low temp or thermal shock?  Will they 
<revive?  (No, I won't ask if my beer is ruined! <g>) 
 
Re using a starter: Dried yeast is fine. The major issue is to make sure 
that there are enough viable yeast cells per cm3. I forget the number 
normally quoted (it's a lot), but 250 parts per million of dried yeast is 
about right. Say 7 grams in a 25 litre brew (sorry I don't know the 
conversion to US gallons - they are different to the UK version aren't 
they?) Just mix with 10 times the weight of water at 38-40 C (100 F), leave 
for 15 minutes (definitely no longer than 20 minutes), stir and pitch.I 
sometimes use starters for things like champagne but dried yeast is in some 
ways safer than a starter. 
 
Re: Too Cold for Yeast: Don't worry - remember that many lagers are 
fermented at that temperature for months. Just warm it up and all should be 
OK. If not (unlikely) add more yeast - quickly. 
 
I have a question: My favourite brew (at the moment) is a pale ale mashed at 
about 66C and then bottled at somewhere near SG1012. I want to condition it 
using secondary fermentation (ie no sugar added to the bottle) and have 
tried lifting the mashing temp a bit to increase the dextrin level. I'm 
pretty happy with the results for a while but after two or three weeks in 
bottle it starts to taste a little "tangy" like an extract beer and too dry 
for what I'm after. Does anyone have any ideas as to how to to avoid this 
other than sterile filtering and externally gassing which kind of defeats 
the purpose?

*ok folks, apologies, I'm a bit behind in my trolling.  Forgive my latency. 
( Yesireee, I have  a bit behind...but I'll leave my genitalia out of it.) 
 
>From: vee12`at`juno.com     >Subject: Extract Brewing

>is not a heavy beer. I'm looking to brew a lighter type of beer for my better

*  NOTE:  You should use the more politically correct phrase "other half" 
plus its less degrading, but if she/he/it is willing to buy you brew 
supplies, bow. 
 
*    hey Butch,as Nokomaree would probably say, "Don't be stupid, just do it." 
Last time I checked- A 3lb can of extract weighs- well  3lbs.  There is no 
lighter or heavier to it, so "don't be stupid, don't analyze it, just do 
it" 
 
But really-  to try to be helpful:  You might be referring to weight in 
terms of 
a)  color (light vs. DARK=heavy)  or b)  specific gravity, initial vs. final. 
 
 light beer could be one that is  a) dry, b) low in alcohol.  A sweet beer 
might seem "heavy" while a dry beer might seem "light".  On the other hand 
a strong (high alcohol beer) could seem "heavy" while a low ETOH brew = 
light. 
 
Factors to control these variables are many, and may become complicated, 
damned that might lead us to over-analyzing and we all know how bad that 
is! 
 
1) Starting gravity:  =result of # lbs of extract added per volume. 
1 x3# can= low, 2 x3# can= higher, like twice as much even. 
 
An alternative to allow greater control (well, mashing of course, but...) 
use DME, dry malt extract.  You can add the amount you wish. NOTE: 1# DME 
not= 1#LME 
 
Another factor is the attenuation due to your yeast.  How much of that 
sweet sugar can those buggers eat!  More importantly- how much do they 
leave behind, resulting in a sweet beer product which might be perceived as 
heavier than dry. 
 
Also note:  Higher hopped beers will tend to have more "mouthfeel" than 
less hopped beers and could also be perceived as heavier.  In general I 
have noticed that women tend to prefer less hoppy beers, while many males 
tend to have a liking for hoppier brews.  (flame me, go ahead, make my day, 
JUST DO IT!) 
 
So- easiest way?  Do what they do in Utah, just add water.  Dilute your end 
product, this will lower the alcohol and unfermented sugar concentration. 
(one of the reasons I homebrew is to avoid this very offensive concept!) 
 Be sure to use sterile, pre-boiled water.  You don't wanna add chlorine! 
 
 *** 
 
As for priming by the bottle- heres my 2c. 
 
Prime by volume, not individually. A one time effort, LOTS less room for error-
<ok science buffs, grab your Spiff helmet:>  if you look at the error bars 
associated with mismeasuring one tbsp per bottle, vs. measuring a large 
volume one time, and making one large addition of measured sugar solution, 
mixing well, then bottling you will see MUCH less likelyhood of under or 
(worse) overcarbonating. 
 
I never understood that concept of priming by the bottle.  Ugh.  Its like 
starting siphons by sucking hoses (ok, so I'm busted, but....)  really, one 
of the major advantages of kegging IMHO is the concept of simplification. 
Fill one keg, carbonate, serve. No washing bottles, no filling, no capping. 
No priming... 
So why revert?  How about just priming the whole keg as you would for 
bottling, mix and then dispense bottles from the keg tap before it 
carbonates.  Cap, wait. 
 
Or carbonate in the keg and just fill the bottles.  I have a 
counterpressure filler, but I often fill bottles w/conditioned keg beer, 
cap and hand out to people.  Cleaning the cp filler can be yet another 
hassle. 
 
So dammit all, just do it!  ( i feel like a f%`at`&in' nikey add! ) 
Hey- whatever tickles your pickle.  I think NOMONKEY has been ticklin his 
own at our expense.  We sure are a collective gullible bunch though.  Try a 
search on "its" name at the archives.  Shall we create a FAQ for it? <G>

Subject: Protein Filtration


Hi folks, 
 
I'm the one who suggested that you might be able to loose beer 
proteins through adsorption during filtration. Based on Charlie 
Scandrett's concentration numbers I estimate that a 5 Gal (19L) batch 
would contains tens of grams of protein (a conservative estimate) The 
worst filtration catastrophe I've ever had lost me about 50 
milligrams of protein (and that with a non-Low Prot Binding Filter). 
Therefore I think any protein losses during filtration of beer will 
be negligible. Thanks for the great info.

Subject: Decocting w/o lagering, Wheat beer


     Mike Swan asks if one can decoction mash without lagering.  The answer 
     is "Yes!"  All science aside, I do it all the time, as do commercial 
     breweries.  Weizen is usually decoction mashed and is not aged for a 
     particularly long time.  I've never had a problem with tannin 
     harshness in any decoction-mashed beer that I've made.  Perhaps it's 
     because of my positive outlook!  More likely it's because the pH of my 
     mash is 5.3. 
 
     There has been a conversation about 100% wheat beer/Weizen/Fruit wheat 
     beer forming.  It has been said that you will get lower extraction, 
     but no lautering problems, if you under-crush the wheat.  You can 
     improve extract by crushing more finely (relative to under-crushing; 
     don't make flour) and add rice hulls to aid with setting up the grain 
     bed for lautering. 
 
     As an aside, rice hulls do absolutely nothing to help lautering 100% 
     rye mashes.  Unless you love 5 hour sparges, DON'T DO IT! 
 
     I agree that using a Bavarian Weizen yeast AND adding fruit will 
     create a "muddled" drink.  If you ferment with a clean yeast (i.e., 
     1056), you will have a great fruit beer foundation.  Wheat is pretty 
     light in the way of flavor (in fact, when judges write "Not enough 
     wheat character" I always wonder what they mean!).  Wheat is sort of 
     an "honorable" flavor-lightening adjunct, to my taste buds, at least. 
     It dries the finish nicely.  It is the yeast that gives a Bavarian 
     weizen it's character. 
 
     The fact that American-style wheat beers (fermented with "clean" 
     yeasts) are so bland illustrates this.  There should be a law against 
     calling them "Weisse" or "Weizen!" 
 
     By the way, Brooklyn Brewery is brewing a true Bavarian-style Weizen 
     at it's new brewery in Brooklyn.  The first few batches were not the 
     best, but it is now damn close to very good.  Just needs a bit more 
     malt backbone...(no affiliation, blah, blah, blah).  It is confusingly 
     named "Brooklyner Weisse," but it is definitely Bavarian. 
 
     I think it's only available on tap in the New York city area, so if 
     you're in the area, try it. 
 
     Enough of my babble...

Sounds like some kind of infection.  I would suspect a cleaning/sanitation 
problem first.  The reason I know this is that I had a similar problem when 
I started brewing.  I brewed one or two batches with no problems, then batch 
after batch of infected beer.  My problem was that I had a spigot at the 
bottom of my plastic fermenter.  I was not cleaning it out well enough.  I 
now disassemble the spigot as much as possible, and soak it, the washer, and 
nut in a strong bleach solution (4 TBSP/gal.) for 1-2 hours.  Bleach is an 
amazing cleaner!  I then reassemble and soak the whole fermenter for an hour 
in a regular strength bleach solution (1 TBSP/gal.)  I haven't had a related 
problem since! 
 
There are other problems you could be having related to process, but the 
biggest is sanitation.  Look at your whole process.  Is there any place 
where you could be lax in your sanitation?  Do you wash your bottles, *then* 
give them an overnight soak in a bleach solution?  Are you rinsing enough? 
There should be no bleach smell in your equipment before it makes contact 
with your beer.  Are you adding any untreated water to your beer?  A full 
wort boil is probably the best solution.  However, I have a lot of success 
with purified/distilled drinking water (can't use distilled when mashing, 
tho).  Filtered or pre-boiled water are better than the store-bought, if you 
have time.  One other recommendation:  do you know an experienced brewer who 
can observe your process?  That can be a tremendous help. 
 
Hope this helps.  Skol.

Subject: Ginsing!


Wow!  approx. 10 oz. of White Ginsing. 
I don't know how much you paid, but if it is a good piece, I don't know 
if you want to brew with it.  Here in S.F., better pieces of ginsing 
(the more they are free of surface flaw, and resemble a human) can sell 
for $20-$30 a pound.  I have seen some prime examples selling at $100. 
I hope it is not of this quality (BTW, this quality level does not effect 
the taste of it, just the magic/medicinal properties). 
Ginsing has a different taste than ginger, but may be used in the same 
way.  It is popular in the Caribbean, especially in drinks.  Also, sodas 
and juices with it can be found in many Asian food stores.  Try tasting 
one of these to see if you like it, and if not, then.... 
but otherwise, make a ginsing beer.  Something like a pale ale base, and 
the whole root for 5 gallons (I use 15 oz of ginger for real ginger ale). 
My one caution is that it has strong antiseptic/microbial properties and 
is a great anti-oxidant so you may have a slow start with the ferment. 
Maybe using a slightly larger starter, or just waiting a bit longer. 
 
Hope this helps

Subject: kevin's water; decoction w/o lagering


collective homebrew conscience: 
 
kevin - if you boil your water, you will reduce both carbonate AND calcium, 
to a point.  calcium is desirable if you're mashing.  i would definitely 
be checking the pH if i were you, and watch out for high sulfate additions 
(gypsum) if you're brewing a well-hopped beer.  calcium chloride would be 
better if you're brewing a pale, well hopped lager. 
 
michael swan asked about decoction without lagering, and if there would be 
astringency problems.   i've decoction mashed a lot of beers without truly 
lagering them, and there is not, to my taste, an unpleasant astringency 
with any of them.  however, one of the bigger benefits of lagering i have 
experienced is in the area of head retention.  if you can lager it, do it. 
 
what about bottling as soon as fermentation is over, and then "lagering" 
in the bottle after a short time for bottle carbonation?   would this 
achieve some of the benefits of lagering?  is there a surface area issue 
here?  i'm not an expert on lagering.  why wouldn't this work?

Subject: Saved Yeast Viability


Fellow HBDers: 
 
I have some water-washed Wyeast 1056 from a batch of pale ale in 
a 1 quart mason jar, sitting in my brewing fridge at about 40 F. 
It has been there since mid-March, and I'm wondering how long 
will it be good for?  Given the enormous quantity of yeast that 
is in the jar (the cake is over 1-inch thick!) I had wanted to 
make use of it when brewing my X-mass Imperial Stout and 
Barleywine. 
 
How should I rouse the yeast and what should I be looking out 
for? 
 
Thanks.

Subject: great starter trick


I can't remember who brought this subject up but I tried it this weekend 
and it worked great.  I built 40 oz. of wort with dme and yeast nutrient 
Tuesday evening and let it cool overnight.  The next morning I dumped it 
into my sanitized carboy, along with a 22 oz. bottle of Fat Tire.  I brewed 
a Fat Tire clone on Sunday, at which time the starter was going fast and 
furious.  After chilling the wort to 65 F I siphoned it directly into the 
carboy on top of the starter.  The next morning (about 10 hours later) the 
blow off bowl already had about 4 inches of foam in it and the carboy was 
boiling.  Thanks for the great tip.  No more wimpy starters in separate 
containers with the associated cleaning and transferring hassles.  Truly a 
great idea.  Any problems with this? 
 
BTW, here is the recipe:  (I talked to a rep from New Belgium Brewing about 
two weeks ago but he wouldn't tell me much about the beer.  He did say that 
the beer is fermented out and then cleared in bright beer tanks, after 
which it is centrifuged just prior to bottling.  The yeast in the bottle is 
the fermentation yeast (and lots of it!)) 
 
7 # American 2 row malt 
1.5 # malted wheat 
0.5 # victory malt 
1.5 # 40L crystal malt 
3/4 oz. N. Brewer 8.6% aa (60 minutes) 
1 oz. Cascade 4.4% aa (5 minutes) 
1 oz. Cascade 4.4% aa (dry hopped after 4 days = tomorrow) 
Fat Tire sediment yeast starter 
o.g. - 1.062 
 
Mashed in at 125 F for 25 minutes 
Pulled 1/3 decoction - 155 F for 25 minutes, boiled for 10 minutes 
Mashed at 156 F for 75 minutes 
Sparged and collected 7 gallons wort 
90 minute total boil 
Fermenting at 64 F 
 
When I smell the blow off bowl it is very reminiscent of Fat Tire - spicy 
and malty with a flowery/citrusy hop aroma.  It must be good because I had 
to pluck a big stink bug out of the blow off bowl this morning.  Poor devil 
died a happy death tho'.  Fat Bug Amber Ale (tm) ?

On a related note, I read in the latest Zymurgy that you can use

I don't use mine anymore since switching to corny's, but I recall that you 
prime
a 5 gal. batch with about 1/3 cup sugar at most. 
 
I have tried nitrogen oxide (whippets?) cartridges for my stouts in the past, 
and boy did they turn out great.  I just got them from my local HB store, so I 
wouldn't know where else to find them.

I think you've hit the nail on the head Mike.  I recently did a single- 
decoction Bohemian Pilsner and although the beer needed 8 weeks of lagering 
for the yeast's sulfury aroma to dissipate, there was no astringency you 
would expect from a high levels of tannins, even after only two weeks of 
lagering.  I was careful to make sure the pH of the mash was in the low 5's 
(I did not have to adjust -- it was there naturally -- 1/2 Chicago tapwater, 
1/2 distilled) before cooking.  The long lagering may be necessary for the 
blasted Czech Pilsner yeast to settle, though!  I split the batch and fined 
with Bentonite, Isinglass, Gelatin and Polyclar.  All four basically were 
the same clarity (not crystal clear like filtered, but not murky like the 
unfined beer) and the same flavour. 
 
Alas, 1/2 Chicago water and 1/2 distilled was still too much sulphate 
for a Bohemian Pils, the first-wort-hopping give me all hop flavour and 
virtually no hop aroma and I undershot the IBUs by about 10 (I got about 
30 rather than the 40 I was shooting for), so the beer was drinkable, but 
not a great Bohemian Pils.
