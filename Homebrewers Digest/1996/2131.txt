Dear friends: 
 
I would appreciate your suggestions on how to keep yeasts for a long time. 
I am planning to mail order them soon. When I receive them, I will use 
part of them to brew but I will need to keep the rest until the next 
batch or until I receive the next order. This would take some time so I 
will need to keep them alive for a long time. Any suggestions? 
Thanks for your help.

Subject: Bananas, Decoction Stout, Sulfite


Brewsters: 
 
Daniel Goodale ( Yes that's his real name) has come upon a plethora of bananas,
pulped and froze them and asks for some suggestions for using them in a beer. 
 
I have never used bananas in making beer, but an OLD book called "Progressive 
Winemaking" by Peter Duncan and Bryan Acton (1967, Holmes and Sons, London) 
recommends to use them as a neutral source for adding body to  non-grape fruit 
wines.  A typical white wine required about 5 lbs  for five gallons ( I guess 
the weight is with the skins) and a full wine like Sauternes would require ten 
pounds for 5 gallons. Although they were dumped into the juice and sugar before
fermentation in making wine, it is a debate about whether I'd use them as a 
fruit additive or an adjunct in the mash, using the malt enzymes to chew up any
carbohydrates. I don't know what they would do to the clarity if used as a 
fruit
additive,a pectic enzyme may be needed, yet boiling them after mashing would 
reduce the aroma. I guess I'd try 5 pounds either way and find out. Be sure to 
report back. As far as the grist goes, how about using a Belgian ale type mash,
at least eventually. 
- ----------------------------------------------------------- 
Bryan gave us his milk stout recipe and said he was going to do a double 
decoction mash.  Why?  I'd do an infusion mash to be in style. 
- ----------------------------------------------------------- 
AlK says that sulfites in acid media ( like fruits and juices) don't sterilize.
I have read this several times here in the HBD and wonder what the origin is of
this statement, as I have read for many years in many books that acidic 
sulfites
are sterilants. It may be that the alkalai salts aren't, I don't know, and this
could be a source of confusion.  Please provide a primary reference.

Subject: Burnt Taste / Fruit Beer Questions (  |8-{0  Oh No!)


A questiona bout a "burnt flavor" came up a couple HBD's ago.  I don't have 
personal experience with autolysis (yeast cannibalism), but doesn't that have 
a "burnt rubber" smell/taste associated with it?  Leaving beer on too much 
yeast, especially in the primary, is a prime cause of this, I believe. 
 
******** 
 
OK, I'm hooked on trying a cherry porter next -- my first fruit beer.  I've 
read the discussion about the vigorous secondary fermentation created by the 
yeast.  This means that more alcohol is created (in addition to what the 
plain pre-fruit wort generated), and therefore a lower gravity and thinner 
mouthfeel. 
 
To compensate, would simply mashing at a very dextrinous temperature (say, 
158F or so) result in a thicker, lower-alcohol beer, more well-suited for the 
volume and thinning effects of the alcohol produced by the fruit?  How much 
fermentable sugar is supplied per pound of cherries on the average?  With 
this information one could better estimate the total alcohol in the final 
product, to try to keep it in balance. 
 
What about hopping?  Intuition might suggest reducing the hop rate to allow 
the fruit to shine better, but one doesn't want icky-sweet either. 
 
Thanks for whatever y'all can offer.

The quanitity used should be zero.  Fuller's uses stainless steel kegs for 
their cask-conditioned ales.  What "cask conditioned" means is that the 
beer is "live."  Another name for it is "Real Ale."  It means that the 
beer is not filtered and the yeast in the cask (wood or stainless) has 
been used to carbonate the beer naturally, via primings.  Even beers such 
as Samuel Smith's Museum Ale or Old Brewery Bitter (which *are* served 
from wood casks) do not have any oaky aroma or taste. 
 
Save the oak chips for Rodenbach Grand Cru and Ballentine's IPA clones which 
do indeed have oaky flavours.  There is an oak flavour in some Lambics 
but there is growing evidence that it has nothing to do with the fact that 
these beers are fermented in wood.  You may use oak chips to add an oaky 
character to pLambics, but I, personally, am skeptical that this is how 
these beers get their oak character (I think it's microbiological).

Fermentation time is dependent on a number of factors: 
 
yeast health, 
dissolved oxygen in the cooled wort, 
temperature, 
fermentability, and 
Original Gravity. 
 
As the first three increase, the fermentation time decreases.  As the last 
two increase, the fermentation time increases.  Also, some yeasts strains 
are simply faster than others. 
 
With healthy yeast and lots of dissolved oxygen, a typical 1.050 wort 
can ferment in as quickly as two days if your temperature is in the 70's F. 
With mishandled yeast and poor oxygenation, a typical 1.050 wort can take 
as long as three weeks to ferment at, say 60F with some ale yeasts.

Read Brewing Techniques May/June 1996 (Vol. 4, No. 3). 
See "When Fermentation Rears Its Dirty Head - Testing the theories for and 
against removing kraeusen during fermentation." 
 
To summarize -- the flavour differences (according to about a half dozen 
BJCP judges) were virtually nil except for the blowoff batch being less bitter.
The lab tests confirmed this.

Subject: apology and question


I must say, after re-reading David Burley's post in #2121, that he never said 
he used Fruit Fresh for sterilizing fruit. David, I hope you will accept my 
apology. I must try to be more careful and considerate. 
 
My question is prompted by an interesting post from Charlie Scandrett in HBD 
#2128. He reports that with malts available in the US and UK, rests in the 
45C to 55C range should be minimized in order to prevent over-reduction of 
medium weight proteins. My experience with rests in this range, using US 2-row 
malt, seems to support this. I've tried 50C protein rests on two all-grain 
batches. The first of these rested 30 minutes at 50C, the second 20 minutes. 
Both turned  out thin-bodied and had poor head retention. Since then I've had 
better results with US 2-row in single infusion mashes at 68C-69C but yields 
have been lower and chill haze worse. Okay, maybe a rest at 60C before going 
to 68C will give me just what I want. My question is this: why so many recipes 
and recommendations (especially from 8-10 years ago) for 30 minutes at 50C? 
Has US malt changed? Have we (I mean y'all, not me) gotten smarter? Might a 
50C rest be still appropriate for US 6-row?

A while back, I read an article about sanitation and Iodophors in 
general.  It was, of course, touted to be a pretty good sanitizer.  I've 
been using it for years and have to agree.  One of the probelems for me 
has always been the cost of the product.  This article suggested trying 
dairy suppliers for a less expensive product.  I have and I've come up 
with one that I have to share. 
 
I found a product called UDDER-DU Iodine Sanitizer and Udder Wash for 
Dairy Cows.  It's made by An-Fo Manufacturing Co., Oakland, CA.  (I don't 
work for these folks, never did, never want to <g>). 
 
I've looked at the label on it and on B-T-F Iodophor and they are 
practically the same: 
 
B-T-F: 
 
Butoxy polypropoxy polyethoxy ethanol-iodine complex (providing 1.6% 
titrable iodine) 12.54% 
Inert Ingredients 87.46% 
 
UDDER-DU: 
 
Alpha(p-nonyphenl)-omega-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene)--iodine complex 
(provides 1.67% minimal titrable iodine) 17.68% 
Phosphoric Acid 5.80% 
Inert Ingredients 76.52% 
 
The PPM is exactly the same.  You get 12.5 with 1/2 oz. in 5 gallons with 
each.  The only difference that I can see is the price.  ('cept the 
phosphoric acid)  The B-T-F costs $10-12 per 33 fl oz and the UDDER-DU is 
$13 a gallon.  Yep, $13 a gallon. 
 
I feel like if it's good enough for a cow's udder, it's surely good 
enough for my beer making enterprise.  Give it a thought.

Subject: Sulfites as sterilants


Brewsters: 
 
I forgot that I have an excellent professional reference which I didn't think 
about until after I posted my question on sulfites as sterilants. 
 
>From "Table Wines, The Technology of Their Production" 1951,1970 U Cal Press by
A.A. Amerine and M.A. Joslyn. This book is the equivalent to Malting and 
Brewing
Science in the wine world 
 
p380 
 
"Sulfur dioxide, as the fumes of burning elemental sulfur, has been used in 
wine
making since antiquity to disinfect containers, control fermentation and 
preserve wine." 
 
P.396 
"The antiseptic effect of sulfur dioxide and sulfites was long known to depend 
upon the free, undissociated sulfurous acid or molecular sulfur dioxide, and 
less or absent in combined sulfites or neutral sulfites.  Muller-Thurgau and 
Osterwalder (1914) were the first to observe that sulfurous acid and its salts 
werre effective as preservatives only in acid media......... It is now known 
that even slight changes in pH in the region of 3-5 markedly affect the 
proportion of undissociated acid present and consequently its antiseptic 
efficacy. " 
 
P. 395 
" Sulfur dioxide tends to protect the wine from excessive oxidation by 
inhibiting enzymic and non-enzymic oxidative discoloration...." 
 
 
As you may know, sulfur dioxide dissolved in sodium hydroxide in the correct 
stoichiometry will produce sodium metabisulfite, likewise with potassium 
hydroxide to produce potassium metabisulfite.  Acidifying these salts will 
produce sulfurous acid which will act as an anti-browning agent and as a 
sterilant. while acidic, it reacts with oxygen, so it is labile in air, and 
becomes non-active quickly. 
 
The pH =3 to 5 comment above needs needs some explaining: 
 
pH %H2SO3  %HSO3^-1 %SO3^-2 
 
0.0 98.3  1.7  0 
1.0 85.5  14.5  0 
1.8 50.0  50.0  0 
3.0  5.5  94.5  0 
3.3  0.2  99.8  0 
4.0  0  100.0  0 
5.0  0  99.0  1.0 
6.0  0  80.9  19.1 
7.0  0  50.0  50.0 
 
etc 
.. 
So, above about pH = 3 the sterilizing abilities of SO2 are limited, above pH  
=5 the sufite ion begins to predominate and it has no sterilizing ability. 
 
The bottom line is, however, acidic solutions of metabisulfite with a pH less 
than 3.0 are excellent sterilants for yeast and bacteria  and behave as 
anti-browning agents. Most wines from grapes will be in the pH of 3.4 range or 
(preferably) lower.  Beers, of course, should never be this low*, and 
metabisulfite is not a good sterilant in beer, which I guess is where this info
came from. If you want to sterilize something like glassware with metabisulfite
instead of bleach or iodophor, make up a solution of metabisulfite and acidify 
it with an edible acid, say citric acid and use it right away. 
 
* unless they are intentionally prepared with bacteria in them, and then you 
don't want sufurous acid.. 
 
 
Keep on brewin'

Subject: seeking supplies in europe


Living in the Czech Republic, I am surrounded by Pilsner Urquell, Budvar, 
and Radegast, very fresh, really cheap. The problem arises that Czech 
Pilsner and black beers are the *only* styles available. No variety 
whatsoever. 
 
In CR, there is no homebrew network that I know of. I am currently trying 
to gain access to raw malt and hops, but I fear that I will have little 
chance of success, as I have made only a few batches of beer, and I don't 
beleive that I am ready to malt my own barley. 
 
Could someone please supply contacts of homebrew suppliers/manufacturers in 
Europe? England, Germany, and Belgium are best. Any homebrew contacts in 
the Czech Republic would be ideal. 
 
Thank you, and na zdravi!

     Somebody posted something about having some yeast that was washed with

     about yeast culturing." 
 
     So, does anybody out there know anything about it?  How do you acid

Dave, 
I have used bananas in both beer and mead.  The beer I made was a 
banana smoked porter.  The bananas were an afterthought....i was 
brewin', the bananas were rottin' on the top of the fridge,  ploop, in the 
wort.  The beer was great, although there was no noticable banana 
smell/flavor/aroma.  I only used 4 bananas. 
 
I made a mead earlier this year and threw about 4 overripe bananas, 
which were crushed with a little water and brought to 160 degrees, into 
the secondary.  About a month later, I racked the mead again and added 
about 4 more overripe bananas (same heat w/ water routine as above), 
and I did this again.  Anyway, all said there were about 10 bananas 
added over the course of 6 months.  The OG was 1.130 and last week 
the gravity was 1.035.  It is CRYSTAL clear!  I plan to bottle it in the next 
month or so (depending on when I get motivated!)  When I racked it off 
the last addition of bananas last week, I had to leave some mead in the 
fermenter because all of the banana funk on the bottom was clogging up 
my racking cane.  I filtered the funk/mead mixture and filled about 4 
Grolsch bottles, chilled them, tried them and WOW!  This stuff is good.  It 
has that young mead bite, but it is softened considerably with the banana 
taste and aroma.  It is very strong!  I can't wait to bottle this, throw 5 or 
so bottles in the crawlspace and "find" them in about 5 or 10 years! 
 
To sum:  Go For It!  Make a banana beer!  How about a light pilsner with 
banana and vanilla?  Mmmmm  Any takers???

Howdy 
 
Anyone been able to culture the little 'Pacman' critters hanging out at 
the bottom of a bottle of Rogue?  My culture from a bottle of Sierra 
Nevada finally bit the dust (lesson learned: don't play with your sourdough 
starter the same day as you play with your beer starter!) so i thought 
i'd start over but with pacman this time.  (yummy yummy rogue) 
 
I'm sure I'm being impatient but yesterday am I did the usual procedure: 
make a 1.04 SG pint of wort (i was out of my *properly* pressure canned pints 
of wort :), cool, and drop on the remaining 1" or so of beer (plus 
yeast) sitting on the bottom of a bottle of shakespeare stout, shake, 
affix airlock.  I suppose the same rules apply with smack packs that you 
should wait an additional day for each month of age?  Rogue doesn't pasteurize 
or anything do they?  Naaaah.. far too fine of an operation to do 
something so heinous.. 
 
While I'm at it -- does anyone know if they bottle condition like we typically 
do (add corn sugar while there's still yeast in suspension)  or do they first 
cold filter to precipitate yeast, then add yeast at priming time like Sierra 
Nevada?  BTW, I was surprised to learn that Sierra Nevada uses dextrose to 
prime (plus a smidgen of add'l yeast) just like the rest of us...  I wonder 
because it seems like the population is much bigger in the bottom of a 
shakespeare -- then again it's a 22oz bottle.. 
 
PS got the info about sierra nevada from our tour guide Dan. Hi Dan! wonderful 
visit, can't recommend it highly enough. 
 
TIA for insight!  bacchus bless the HBD!!

Subject: Oak Chips!


Well, 
When I tried to oak up a wine I made, I was told (by some knowledgible 
home winemakers) to use a 1 ounce package per 20 gallons.  I left the 
chips in for a month, and nothing, so another month went by, still 
nothing.  Later, discussing with some winemaking friends, we tried a next 
batch with the same strength, except heated them in a little water.  Much 
better!  Extraction of the oak flavor was better. 
I can't tell you exactly how much to use, but it takes a long while (2 - 
3 months).  So if you do not want to wait on your beer that long, I would 
try doing a low heat extraction of the oak.  Adding the chips in along 
with the extract.

Hi Eric: 
 
It sounds like you're just keeping the little critters just a tad warm. 
If you're making highly hopped ales, and using an ale yeast you may not 
notice much flavor change.  Fast fermentations are not always bad.  I can make 
a decent Nut-Brown Ale in about two days. 
BUT, if you are trying for a lightly hopped beer, the yeast byproducts 
(esters...) may give you banana and other less desirable flavors. 
(this also depends on the yeast strain....) 
Yeast may tolerate warm temperatures (up to ~100F) but they don't necesarily 
enjoy living so hot.  Try to rehydrate at ~75F, and cool your fermentor to 
between 65-75F.  Things wil start slower and progress slower with less 
"fruity esters".  Even a wet towel draped over your fermenter will cool it by 
several degrees compared to the air temp.  Try to ferment in a cool, 
temperature stable place (dark cellar if you have one).  I have even kept 
my 5 gal bucket or glass carboy in a large plastic garbage can filled ~1/4 
full with cool water.  A couple of handfuls of ice cubes every day help to 
keep the temp down.  This was when I lived in Augusta, GA and had no basement. 
Good luck and keep at it.

I've been unable to locate a reference for the potential 
extract from unmalted wheat.  Anyone have that info? 
 
This related to making a Belgian wit, something I've seen 
a number of posts about while searching.  If you have some 
practical advice on this style, feel free to Email me.

OK, pertaining to my post above: I looked back at 1994 HBDs and 
found lots of good advice for making a wit beer.  Not to waste 
bandwidth, here are the issues I found most interesting: 
#1508 Phillip Seitz (p00644`at`psilink.com) 
 GREAT info on the style, ingredients, mashing. 
 Also a few sample recipes! 
#1517 djmiller`at`tasc.com 
 Some recipes for Celis clones 
#1568 A.J. deLange (A.J._deLange`at`csgi.com) 
 Some useful tips 
 
Hope this is useful.  I'd gladly repost the first (1508) if there 
is interest (Phillip: are you out there?).  It is a terrific note!!

Subject: Which Wheat?


Hello All, 
 
I'm getting prepared to brew a Wit this weekend, and a local bread bakery 
currently has 2 kinds of wheat. One is a high gluten red spring hard 
wheat, the other is a white spring hard (I'm assuming less gluten). 
Either one is a buck a pound. Can anyone suggest which would be best for 
brewing and what the differences would be between them? 
 
Thanks, 
 
Todd Kirby

Info On Raw Wheat as seen in HBRPC11 (which came from a book somewhere) 
 
Type: Wheat, Raw    Lovibond: 2.0    S.G. Contr: 1.036    Lintner: 0 
Foam promoting proteins. Protein rest recommended. Used in Wit biers 
at 45% of grist and in Lambics at 30%. Contributes a permanent starch 
haze to the beer. 
 
Starter Tip: 
Get a bag of DME and some 3 oz vials. Into each vial put 4 tbsps of DME 
and drop in 1 hop pellet. Cap and store until you wish to make a starter. 
Into about 10oz of water, dump the pre-measured vial of DME w/hop. Boil 
for 10 mins and cool. You can expect a S.G. of about 1.020. The hop 
pellet is included for its antiseptic qualities... This allows me to 
whip together a starter in about 15 minutes.

Charlie's post caught my eye for a couple of reasons: I recently increased my 
sparge time from about 25 min. - to gather 7 gallons - to about 50-60 min. Head
retention on these five or so batches has been much better (good head retention
and good Brussel's lace).  Mind you, I don't have any quantitative evidence 
to support this, and BTW my yield has increased from about 28 pts./lb. to 
32 pts./lb. 
 
With regard to the protein rest in Fix's 40/60/70C mash schedule, the intent of
the 60C rest is not protein modification, although some may occur.  My 
understanding of his 60C/70C mash rests is to control fermentability via time 
rather than trying to achieve a precise temperature in the 150-160F temp. 
range.  The idea is to perform two starch conversion rests, one where 
primarily B-amylase is active (60C/140F) and the other where primarily 
alpha-amylase is active (70C/158F).  George Fix suggested a  40/50/60/70C or 
50/60/70C mash schedule for lager malt mashing where a protein rest is 
required or desired.

It curious to note that virtually ALL Easter egg kits say not to boil

The first statement is true.  In fact, there was an article in Private 
Eye Weekly about it a couple of months ago (the article mentioned that 
there were no known busts).  I imagine a homebrewer *could* get a 
license though, with enough time, energy, money and tolerance for 
governmental bullcrap.

Gary McCarthy's analysis of the Mormon influence in Utah was good, and I 
couldn't agree more with his comments.  It's funny how they'll let you 
do the "forbidden" things if you pay enough money/taxes!  (BTW, Gary, 
I'm also in SLC and was exiled here from Montana, where the [hard] 
liquor is actually wholesaled AND retailed through the state.)  "The 
World is Welcome Here" tout the 2002 Olympic banners.  To which I add, 
"Yeah, if you're Mormon or rich."  Oops, I might be getting too 
political here.  Or even sacrilegious, maybe, depending on one's point 
of view.  Sorry!

Thanks to all who responded to my yeast questions.  Fortunately, both 
problems had been resolved by Sat. afternoon.  The 38F yeasties revived 
on their own without repitching or rousing when brought back to proper 
temp.  I'll find out when I bottle tomorrow whether anything bad 
happened or not.  As for my first question, I added my stored bottle of 
yeast to a quart of canned wort, and it was flocculating nicely by pitch 
time.  I've since rediscovered an article on bottling a parallel 
generation of starters from a single smack pack, which I'll be doing 
today.  Up until now, I've done serial propagation.
