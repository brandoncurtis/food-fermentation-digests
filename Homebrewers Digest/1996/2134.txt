Sorry about the problem with the HBD.  Our e-mail system died while I 
was on vacation.  Unfortunatly the list was truncated, so I went back 
to an older version of the list.  If you were resubscribed and you 
didn't want to be, please follow the unsubscribe instructions. 


Due to the volume of e-mail I have received, I have not been able to
respond individually.  FYI:  If you think you may have been unsubscribed,
you can always try subscribing, that fixes 99% of the "I'm not getting
the HBD problems."


Some of you have missed some issues of the HBD.  To get back issues, 
send e-mail to homebrew-digest-request`at`aob.org and say:

end 
 
(Of course you can replace the numeral part with the number of the 
digest you desire.) 
 
Everyone who was resubscribed to the mailing list should receive a "You

Some recent subscribers were accidently dropped and I was not able to

Subject: Stout


I have been trying for about three and half years to brew a dry stout 
that resembles the flavor of Beamish, Murphey's, or Guinness. They all 
three have that very bitter dry roastd barley flavor. Many American 
Micobrewed stouts have aftertastes of too much hops, too much malt, too 
sweet etc. I realize that nitrogenated heads change the flavor in ales 
but I have noticed that even in the Guinness and Beamish carbonated 
bottle versions that there is a distinctively dryer flavor. In all my 
attempts to homebrew such a stout I have usually been plagued by an 
aftertaste that is too malty or vanilla like. Here is what I have tried 
different after much advice to rememdy it still no success. 
 
I have tried both dry yeast and the Wyeast 1084. I have used various 
different stout kits and/or dark syrup malts. I have tried extra hopping 
and less. with aromatic hops and without. I have brewed at lower 
temperartures 65-70 degress too avoid ester fruit excessiveness. Longer 
and shorter fermentation periods watching and ignoring O.G and T.G. 
readings. In the various stout kits I have used Mount Mellick, 
Laagerland, Munton and Fisson, Black Rock. Rock Miner, Edme, Glenbrew, 
and John Bull hopped and unhopped extract. Still despite all this I get a 
brew that when it is put in the secondary fermenter taste like a good 
flat guinness or Beamish and especially right before bottling or piggy 
kegging but after bottling there is that sweet or malty aftertaste. I am 
careful about sanitation and have carbonated with too much, just right 
and too little corn sugar. What can I do to avoid the malty vanilla 
flavor? Some suggestions have been use only light extracts and get the 
dark color and roast flaovr from the specialty grains (I generally use 
about a pound of roast barely to a five gallon batch). The use of the 
light extract some say may cut down on residual nonfermetable sugars and 
other flavors left by dark extracts (how could a sugar not ferment with 
good yeast?) Does anyone have a suggestion on how to make a full extract 
brew that is free of the malty vanilla aftertaste? I know Guinnes uses 3% 
sour additive but that doesn't explain Beamish or murphey's. Has anyone 
noticed this flaovr problem with their stoput brewing? please either post 
a reply or better yet E-mail with the solution. I only wish to brew a 
stout or porter and one that is free of this aftertaste. I have done very 
little brewing in the last year and may well stop as long as I keep 
buying Guinness because I can't get close to it at homebrewing. Help 
please.

Following is the reply that I got from Sheri Winter, Marketing Director, 
that she "cc:" to Marcia Schirmer, Festival Director.  Marsha seems to be 
to elite to even answer her own mail. 
***************************************************************************** 
 
Dear Mr. Waddell: 
 
We have received your letter and regret that the Great American Beer Festival 
policy with regard to backpacks is so personally upsetting for you. 
 
In an attempt to clear up your many misconceptions, let me start by explaining 
that the *Great American Beer Festival is NOT a part of the American 
Homebrewers Association*.  When it was explained to you on the phone that "we" 
were forced to make this policy change, the "we" refers to the Festival 
Director and the Festival Board of Directors, acting upon the professional 
advice of our paid security force and the Denver Police Department.  The 
Festival is NOT a membership organization. 
 
While the Festival utiizes hundreds of talented volunteers, this is a large 
event attended by more than 25,000 attendees and requires a paid, professional 
staff.  An important part of that paid staff is the professional security 
and police presence.  It is their job to ensure that the Festival occurs 
each year without incident. 
 
As colorful as your descriptions of militia and terrorists may be, the 
actual reason for our policy change is far less glamorous: we are simply 
guaranteeing the continuation of the Festival by abiding by state liquor 
laws.  The police department and the security agency agree that back packs 
represent a substantial threat to our ability to envorce those rules.  In 
the past there have been several documented attempts by attendees to 
remove beer from Currigan Hall--even during the Members-Only Tasting.  The 
removal of beer from the hall is a violation of the law and would result 
in an immediate shutdown of the Festival.  This would mean no more Festival 
for anyone. 
 
The vendors and attending breweries have been made aware of the policy 
change and have in fact supported the policy as necessary to ensure the 
Festival's continued success.  I hope that you will agree that carrying 
a plastic bag from the merchandise booth instead of your back pack is 
preferable to not having a Great American Beer Festival at all.  While it 
is unfortunate that the actions of a few effect all attendees, that is the 
case with this policy as it is with so many others. 
 
In closing, your concerns have been noted but due to the reasons cited this 
is not an issue that we will reconsider.  If you personally find this rule 
intolerable we can only advise that you not attend the Festival.  We would 
be happy to refund your money if you have already purchased tickets. 
 
Sincerely, 
Sheri Winter 
Marketing Director

As this is probably a volatile issue, the AOB and all, I think that any 
further thoughts on the matter be discussed in private E-Mail.  If I am 
being petty in my attitude or if you, also, are pissed about this, just 
drop me a line at my E-Mail address to talk it over, rather than clog up 
the HBD with my rantings.  Thanks. If I'm out of line I'll appologize, if 
there are any folks that support my attitude I'll post a summary.  Ms. 
Schirmer doesn't have an E-Mail address, so if you want any response from 
her yourself you'll have to use the FAX number. (And get a response from 
her flunkie!)  This whole response seems so "smarmy".  (Look it up.) 
I will respond to private E-Mail only to save space on the HBD.  You 
folks can discuss it there if you must. 
 
The AOB says that they want to know what their members think of their 
organization, so here's your chance to be heard.  I, for one, have a 
totally different opinion of them today than I had last week.  Just what 
division of this organisation is for us and which is just for the stock- 
holders?  I think Shawn is doing a bang-up job with the HBD but does the 
organization have ulterior motives?  Hmmmm... 
 
The Liberal view would be: If someone is breaking the law, shut down the 
whole Festival.  It must be societies fault.  The lawbreaker is just a 
victim.  Burn some incense, get them a healing stone, council them. 
 
The Conservative view would be: If someone is breaking the law, arrest that 
person, and prosecute him/her.  Proceed with serious beer tasting. FINI! 
 
Oh, yeah... I forgot... The AOB is in Boulder...  (Palm slapping forehead: 
KLUNK...)

Subject: re:5 liter minikegs


I made the plunge last Friday for a softball picnic. I figured I'd let 
everyone "buy" me some minikegs so the bulk of the beer was Warsteiner and 
Grolsch mini's. I bought the more expensive, all metal Beer-King tap (around 
$70. in Alaska), with 10 CO2 cartridges. I would have purchased the cheaper 
co2 version, but they were out of stock. We killed four cartridges over 3 
mini-kegs. Not too good in my opinion, plus when I always seemed to get more 
foam than beer. It got better as you used the keg up, but I'm not overly 
impressed. If you should choose to acquire your mini-kegs by recycling 
empties as I'm doing, I recommend the Grolsch over the Warsteiner. The bungs 
in the Grolsch come out fairly easily, while the Warsteiner are a harder 
plastic that requires some major work to remove without trashing the opening 
in the keg. Let me know how your experience goes.

Dear friends: 
 
I would appreciate your suggestions on how to keep yeasts for a long time. 
I am planning to mail order them soon. When I receive them, I will use 
part of them to brew but I will need to keep the rest until the next 
batch or until I receive the next order. This would take some time so I 
will need to keep them alive for a long time. Any suggestions?

Subject: Piss Yeller


I sent this message previously while the HBD was down, if you have seen it 
please page down. 
] 
Due to several personal e-mail requests I would like to post the recipe 
for Piss Yeller mentioned in a previous posting to the HBD collective. 
Its not real involved unless you want to add a double decoction mash to 
bring out the malt flavor (a la Warsteiner). 
 
To Make 5 Gallons, 
 
6 lb          Belgian Pilzen Malt 
2 1/2 lb     Wheat malt 
1oz 4.3%  Willamet Hops 
1/2 oz       Saaz Hops (adjust to taste) 
Wyeast #1056 American Ale Yeast or Coopers dry. 
 
OG - 1.048 
FG -  ~1.012-1.007 depending on yeast 
Strike 10 qts at 126 deg. F and protein rest at 120 to 123 deg. for 30 to 
45 minutes. Increase to converstion temp of 150 to 155 and hold for 45 
minutes or until iodine test is negative. (Decoction mashing procedures 
single or double can be used instead) Be sure to mash-out at 168 deg. for 
5 min. this will help prevent a slow or stuck sparge (why I don't know but 
every time I brain cramp and forget to mash-out the sparge runs poorly) 
Sparge with 5 gallons of 168 deg. water and collect.  Boil 90 minutes 
adding Willamet at start of boil and add the Saaz at end of boil (about 10 
minutes). 
 
This beer benefits greatly from a week or two of cold laggering in the 
bottle after carbonation.  The color is lighter than Sam Adams Boston 
Lager and the flavor is somewhat similar.  I've got to admit, I started 
brewing this for my wife and some of our less beer "aware" friends but I 
really enjoy it myself also. 
 
The philosophy behind this beer is basically this; to brew a lager-like 
ale that most people would recognize as "beer" and have the taste 
characteristic lesser beer-educated Americans associate with beer.  The 
wheat is to serve the purpose of rice or corn in American beers and 
"lighten" both the color and the mouth-feel.  Fortunately, malted wheat is 
not an adjunct according to the Reinheitsgebot and this is still an 
all-malt beer. (Sharon is of German descent and enforces the purity law) 
The Saaz hops give the beer a flavor that most educated beer palets will 
associate with a lager or pilsner beer, Ive found that the Saaz flavor 
needs some mellowing time.  I also carbonate this beer a little more 
heavily than most ales (I add a cup or a cup and a quarter of corn sugar 
to 5 gallons at botteling time).  Once again this is to imitate the 
heavily carbonated nature of American beers.  Hope you enjoy it, please 
let me know how it turns out if you brew it.

Robert, 
Here is what I have done as a compromise.  This isn't exactly what you are 
asking for, but this may give you another choice.  I have everything except 
the fridge.  I got a regulator from Superior Products.  I got a CO2 tank 
from a local fire ext. supplier.  I got the kegs from a scrap yard ($5 each 
in serviceable condition).  I bought a Carbonator that screws onto the top 
of a 2L soda bottle. 
 
I keg the beer after fermentation.  I keep it at room temp.  Then I transfer 
from the keg to several 2L bottles.  I chill the bottles and then force 
carbonate.  The beer holds more CO2 when cold so it's easier to chill the 
beer first.  Then, I have several 2L bottles of cold, carbonated beer in the 
fridge.  They fit in the door of my fridge, so they are not really in the 
way. 
 
Seems to work for me.  I intend to get a second fridge some day, but for 
now, this is a good compromise.

Subject: American Oak,


Brewsters: 
 
Rob Moline asks if American oak is suitable for beer. 
 
The answer is yes and no. most American oak barrels do have a more carpenter's 
floor taste than the  French ( I think now it is mostly Eastern European in 
origin)  oak equivalent and if an old whiskey barrel is used, undoubtedly one 
will get whiskey undertones supported by the burnt taste from the highly 
toasted
barrel walls. Most American oak casks are used ( once) to produce whiskey. The 
whiskey, being high proof and a good solvent extracts all the vanillins and 
related flavor ingredients as well as the caramelized wood sugars from the char
to get its smoothness and brown-red color. The fusel oils are extracted from 
the
whiskey into this charcoal on the wall, supposedly. Oak whiskey barrels are 
only
used once and then used as planters in the US, since they have no value to the 
whiskey manufacturer. It might surprise you to know that scotch whiskey in the 
old days was stored in oak sherry casks used to transport sherry from Spain to 
England rather than having their own casks made. Just a good Scot living up to 
his reputation, I guess!  I do wonder how the old scotches stored this way 
compare to today's? 
 
Recent experiments in California cooperages have found that proper treatment of
American oak ( basically treating it like the Europeans do theirs, weathering 
it
out doors, toasting it with oak fires, etc.) will produce good results. 
Although
the jury is still out in some people's minds, the mystique of the French taste 
may not be so far from being duplicated with American oak. However, I believe I
recall from another source that the density of american oak is higher and less 
penetrable to oxygen, so aging in American oak could take longer. The price 
differential in French vs American oak is forcing many wineries in California 
to
switch over at least part of their coopereage to American oak.  My own 
experience is that lightly toasted American Oak barrels do just fine in wine 
aging. 
 
As far as beer goes, the ability to extract the vanillins and tannins from the 
oak would undoubtedly go down from wine and whiskey due to the lower alcohol 
content. For this reason, I recommended in a previous epistle lightly toasting 
the oak chips and extracting them with a little high proof neutral spirit like 
vodka, then adding this to beer to see the effect on the taste of the beer.

Subject: Grassy taste/aroma in hops


Hi, my name is Miguel, and I haven't been a member of the Digest for long 
(as a matter of fact, I joined today). 
I have had a problem with hops that I have grown at home or picked up 
growing feral in places where they are not grown any more: 
Last year I got my hands into about 2 kg of fresh hops of 4 different 
varieties, which I dried on a mesh for three days and then stored in 
snap-lock bags in the freezer. 
Now I find I haven't been able to use any of those hops. Whenever I use them 
I ruin the batch with very strong grassy flavours, like of tea made of fresh 
grass or roadside weeds. 
This has happened regardless of the variety, and the actual typical flavour 
of the variety is very weak in the background. 
I assume it can only be one of two things: either I didn't dry the hops 
enough, or I picked them while they were unripe. The summer had been 
exceedingly wet here in Tasmania, with very few sunny days. 
Any help will be most appreciated. 
Cheers 
      Miguel
