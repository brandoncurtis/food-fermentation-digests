Subject: nitrous oxides in beer


This just caught my eye. It may be a little late but my 
HBD delivery has been a little jittery recently. 
 
David Eddington replies to Brian Colgan on his question: 
 
>I have tried nitrogen oxide (whippets?) cartridges for my stouts 
>in the past,and boy did they turn out great.  I just got them 
>from my local HB store,so I wouldn't know where else to find them. 
I hate to be a foreteller of doom (great game), but this deserves 
some comment. 
 
A recent Brauwelt (1/96? I do not have it at hand) had an article on 
how breweries could recover pure CO2 from the fermentation. One of 
the main reasons given for doing this (as opposed to CO2 cylinders) 
was to ensure the purity of the gas going into the beer. THE GASES 
CONSIDERED EXTREMELY UNDESIRABLE WERE OXIDES OF NITROGEN. (stopped 
shouting). Nitrous oxides can react with FAN in beer to form 
nitrosamines, which are regarded as being nasty as they 
have been shown to be carcinogenic. The authors were concerned 
even about the minute amounts that could exist in bottled CO2, 
let alone considering the effects of pumping pure nitrogen dioxide 
into beer. 
 
Now I do not know how deadly nitrosamines are, or how much would 
be formed by gassing with NO2, or whether this is just lawsuit 
paranoia. The question is, are you willing to risk creating 
carcinogens in your homebrew for the sake of other perceived benefits? 
Not me, that's for sure, but I am still not concerned about using 
commercial bottled CO2, especially after contacting my CO2 supplier 
several weeks ago to find out if their CO2 contained oxides of nitrogen 
(answer no).

Whoops. 
My previous post should refer to laughing gas as 
nitrous oxide, N2O, not nitrogen dioxide, NO2. 
The rest of the argument remains the same. How 
reactive is N2O with soluble proteins in beer? Who would 
risk it?

With the exception of a couple of items, and maybe the tone in a couple of 
instances, I'd hardly call it a "ranting."  You have a legitimate complaint 
and one that should be aired and discussed publicly, and in a much more 
constructive manner than done by the AOB.

I wonder what they have to say about camera bags.  Or do they not want people 
taking photographs of people having a good time at their event?  What about 
women's handbags?

Talk about condescending!  And although AOB dismisses it as being "personally 
upsetting" it's really simply a practical matter of being able to manage 
personal possessions while keeping both hands free to sample beer, read 
literature, take notes, and whatever else one may choose to do during the 
tasting.  A backpack is simply a very practical solution.

I have to agree that that part of Waddell's letter was irrelevant and 
distracted attention from the real issue, and pretty conveniently for the 
purpose of the GABF's response. 
 
>laws.  The police department and the security agency agree that back packs 
>represent a substantial threat to our ability to envorce those rules.  In 
 
_You_ are hiring _them_ to provide security.  They may offer whatever advice 
they choose, but it is the festival's responsibility to make the decisions and 
not to abdicate them to someone else.  You do what is necessary and reasonable 
to enforce the rules about what can/can't be taken out.  If that means 
inspecting bags for contraband beer as people leave, then do it.  What's the 
big deal?  You post the policy at the entrance so people know that they can't 
take beer out and to let them know that bags may be subject to inspection upon 
probable cause to suspect a "beer violation."  It's not going to be a huge 
bottleneck because every single patron is not going to be carrying a backpack. 
 
>the past there have been several documented attempts by attendees to

The fact that you have "several documented attempts" suggests to me that your 
security was effective enough to catch it without needing to impose new 
rules that serve only to inconvenience your patrons. 
 
>In closing, your concerns have been noted but due to the reasons cited this

Ummmm.... I don't see how this is either relevant or accurate.  (And, if 
anything, wouldn't it be the "conservatives" who are more likely to impose a 
whole set of "law and order" prohibitions (like a prohibition on backpacks)? 
"Liberal"?  Why don't you look it up?  I don't use _either_ label for myself, 
I'm just responding to the two (inaccurate) descriptions used in the post.) 
Why do you want to alienate the people _most_ likely to support your position 
by getting into petty namecalling and mischaracterisation? 
 
- - - - - - 
 
The GABF is/has become a big "corporate" event.  It may well also be quite a 
good time if you like huge crowds, but if they are going to take that kind of 
attitude, why would anyone want to support it?  The AHA promotes the GABF as a 
big "member benefit," but the response makes clear that they separate it from 
any conception of member decision-making and that "they" call the shots.  The 
AHA does a lot of good things, but member participation in decision-making 
doesn't seem to be one of their strong points. 
 
There are plenty of well-run "home-grown" beer festivals and tastings (indeed, 
many that are run by _membership_ organisations) that do not see a need for 
quite so many rules and prohibitions.  Obviously, there are some externally- 
imposed legal requirements that need to be observed, but a festival organiser 
needs to find the most liberal, least restrictive way to promote compliance. 
Think globally, drink locally (in whatever locality you may be living or 
visiting), and, by extension, enjoy locally-run beer festivals!  I'll be 
enjoying one of them this weekend. 
 
 
Now go have a beer,

No, but neither is it unusual. I had one go 8 weeks in the secondary. I 
was ready to throw it out until I tasted it. It is almost gone now, with 
only a few bottles left. It was yummy. The only bad effect is less head 
strength and reduced haze, which I suspect is the effect of gravity on 
heavier proteins over the extended secondary period. 
 
Other brewers I have talked to lead me to conclude that the behavior of 
this yeast is inconsistent at low (1 qt. starter) pitching levels. 
Culturing up to a full gallon of starter seems to produce excellent 
results. Let the starter ferment out. At pitching time, pour off the 
starter liquid and use some of the new wort to get the yeast cake into 
suspension. Pour and enjoy a "normal" fermentation.

I've receintly acquired a couple of oaken kegs from a guy who used them to 
brew pale ales in. He has moved away and I can't ask him questions about 
them. They have bung holes with air locks in them and a spigot on the top. 
They are filled with a liquid he said would keep them in shape between 
brews. I have no idea whas this liquid is. 
 
Does anyone have any experience brewing with oak kegs they could impart? I 
assume I brew an ale and use this keg for the secondary fermenter, then just 
dispense it directly from that. Does this sound like a good idea?

Subject: Robert Waddel's ethnic slurs


It seems Robert Waddell cannot only not spell militia correctly, he throws 
in the "Red-Neck" ethnic slurs, and implies all Southern Caucasians of 
Scots-Irish ancestry are alcoholics.  As a Caucasian of Scots-Irish 
ancestry, I deeply resent this ethnic stereotyping, and demand an apology 
from this creep.  Also, if this bigot can document one instance (outside of 
the ethnic-controlled news-media's anti-white yellow journalism) where one 
"red-neck" militia member was ever convicted of bombing anybody anywhere, it 
would be news to me. 
 
I suspect that the GABF rightly banned backpacks, probably because so many 
non-rednecks were carrying off "half the store" in said packs.  Doth Robert 
protest too much?

  OFFICE MEMO          Cocoa or Contamination?                Date:8/6/96 
  I have recently tried two Chocolate beer recipes, Chocolate Stout from the 
Cat's Meow and an extract variation of Papazian's Chocolate Porter.  Because 
of the concerns over oil in baker's chocolate I used powdered 
cocoa--Hershey's.  I made 3 gallon batches and the Stout has about 2oz. of 
cocoa and the Porter had a whopping 7oz!  I used a 2 stage fermentation with 
the Stout and only a single stage with the Porter so it has a lot more 
sediment.  There is a whitish something at the top of the Porter bottles and 
I noticed this in the fermenter too but nothing similiar in the Stout.  The 
Porters taste pretty good after a couple of weeks and the Stouts are 
excellent but I'm wondering if the whitish haze in the Porter is due to the 
cocoa or is the beginning of an infection.  I'm hoping the difference between 
the two is just the large quantity of cocoa in the Porter and the extra 
sediment due to a single stage fermentation.  When I put one bottle of Porter 
in the refrigerator, the whitish substance seemed to dissapate--maybe it 
settled to the bottom which would probably mean the beers are OK.  I'll keep 
an eye on them with time but was wondering what others have experienced in 
making chocolate beers.   TIA.

Help, my beer has the funk. The funk is a sour tasting skunky 
smelling phenomenon. I have now lost four or five batches to 
the funk. The beer usually becomes infected during racking, 
either to a secondary or a bottling bucket. When I begin the 
process the beer will smell and taste fine. By the time I am 
finished it has been infected. 
 
I have sanitized with both bleach and idophur. The beer is 
fermented in the dark and in glass. I rack in my garage which 
is quite dark. I know the symptoms indicate sunlight, but this 
doesn't seem possile. I sanitize all hoses, racking canes, etc. 
 
I am desperate for help. I feel emotionally invested in each 
batch, and it is painful to keep losing batches. Feel free to 
post or private e-mail any advice.

Subject: Bernz-O-Matic O2?


The recent discussion of using the little oxygen cylinders sold by 
Bernz-O-Matic for wort aeration sounded like a good idea; I've already got 
the SS airstone and thought I would just buy the 02 cylinder and attach the 
valve from my existing propane torch, and attach the airstone to the valve. 
No such luck - the O2 cylinders are reverse threaded to prevent potentially 
boneheaded things from happening. 
 
So I saw the propane/oxygen torch Bernz-o-matic sells that the o2 cylinder 
is intended for and thought I could scavenge the oxygen regulator from it. 
Until I saw the price tag ($52!).  Back to the drawing board. 
 
As a last resort, I called Bernz-o-matic (800-654-9011) to ask about buying 
the oxygen regulator assembly to replace my "broken" one (wink, wink) ... 
Nope.  You have to send the original back for reconditioning. 
 
So does anybody know where I can get the O2 regulator for that kind of tank? 
I know Liquid Bread is using the same one and I could get it from them, but 
I'll give odds there's a cheaper source somewhere (the price of any common 
item, once associated with a hobby, is mysteriously doubled...) 
 
Ideas? E-mail is fine; I'll summarize...

     Larry threatens to stop brewing if he can't duplicate a dry stout. 
     His E-mail address wasn't included in the post, so I'm responding 
     here.  I don't brew from extract and only ever did 4 or 5 batches that 
     way, so I can't offer much advice.  It is true that you will get 
     better results by using light extract and using ample specialty malts 
     to achieve the desired flavors and color. 
 
     When using extracts it's tough to know things like what the final 
     gravity will be or how the beer will taste without knowing the grain 
     bill and mash schedule of the extract maker.  They, unfortunately, do 
     not tell you these VERY important things on the label.  That's why I 
     mash. 
 
     The best advice I can give is to get the book entitled "Stout."  It's 
     the latest (I think) in the series of books about specific styles.  If 
     the answer isn't there, you'll be hard-pressed to find it! 
 
     Good luck, keep trying!

I had this problem with my "dry" stouts for a while, and though I have 
a solution, I'm not sure you're going to find it helpful.  What 
finally really worked for me was going to all-grain brewing.  If 
you're not ready to try that, here are some things that might help: 
 
1) Under-attenuation is pretty common in home brewing, and can leave a 
sweet residual flavor.  This issue has been discussed many times 
before in this forum, but the three biggest factors are probably the 
fermentability of the extract you are using, the amount of yeast you 
pitch, and the degree of aeration of your chilled wort.  You say that 
you have tried different extracts, so try stepping up your starter 
size and doing more aeration. 
 
2) I have noticed that many, many "dry" stout recipes call for OGs of 
over 1.040.  In my opinion, if your OG is higher than that, you will 
not get the dry finish you want.  Try shooting for an OG of about 
1.038. 
 
I am puzzled by your assertion that your beer tastes appropriately dry 
before bottle conditioning, but not after.  This suggests to me that 
perhaps you are not bittering sufficiently: the level of bitterness 
does often decline during conditioning in my experience.  Dry Irish 
stouts are usually pretty quite bitter; you should be bittering at 
around 40-50 IBU.  Insufficient bittering might leave the beer with a 
greater perceived sweetness than desired. 
 
I was never satisfied with the quality of my stout until I started 
all-grain brewing.  What I was missing was a roasty graininess and, 
yes, a truly dry finish.  (Having achieved these things, I now find 
myself moving back to brewing slightly sweeter, maltier stouts.  Go 
figure.)  You might try partial-mashing as a step in that direction. 
 
I would be happy to send you the all-grain recipe I use, and perhaps 
you can modify it for extract or partial mash.  Your post does not 
include an email address, so if you want it, send me a note. 
 
Good luck!

That agrees with brewing science's understanding of what is going on Jack. 
Yeast largly use oxygen for processing lipids (fatty acids) for growing. The 
"lag phase" is the initial growing phase. You pitched the whole yeast 
population of your previous batch so there was little need for growing or 
O2, they just went back to work. 
 
However, as in human populations, if we don't reproduce vigorously (am I 
reproducing vigorously enough? Hmmm) then the population "greys", i.e. there 
is a disproportionate percentage of old codgers/biddies and productivity and 
efficiency suffers. Your starter based batches with high growth rates are 
"better" due to a greater proportion of young yeast with healthier cell 
walls. The health of the cell walls seems to affect flavour, Tracy Acquilla 
seems to have much data on this. 
 
Growth is usually FAN limited, lipid limited or O2 limited. In your case it 
would be O2 limited which would leave you with excess FAN (amino acids) to 
tempt bacteria, and an excess of fatty acids to promote staling and possibly 
affect head retention. There is an upcountry microbrewer in Victoria, 
Australia who does this and produces an aromatic, flavourful and headless 
pilsener with a short shelf life. 
 
So in summary, aeration promotes growth (ideally 4 or 5:1) which, 
1/ Gives a age profile of your yeast as young as possible 
2/ consumes most amino acids and simple peptides removing a source of 
bacteria food 
3/ dramatically reduces lipid concentration by using them to build cell walls 
 
But yes, a vigorous fermentation can be obtained without aeration. (Notice 
that I dared not touch the ester thread again.)

Subject: Fruit Beers


 I'm fairly new to brewing and have a question about fruit beers. 
I'm currently making a Raspberry Brew using Malt Extract, Real Raspberries 
and a little crystal malt. I'm concerned about using real fruit because 
the recipe did not call for any chemicals like they do for many fruit 
wines. Do I have to worry about any infections and what not. I'm supposed 
to put 24 ounces in right after boiling the wort (done) and another 24 
in when I rack to secondary. Does the second 24 ounces need to be boiled 
or heated or anything. I'd hate for this expensive raspberry batch to be 
ruined by something. Any advice from anyone would be appreciated. 
Thanks

Miguel de Salas writes about his fresh picked hops:

One common misconception about hops is that they should be FRESH like the 
tomatoes and lettuce they buy.  To the contrary they should be properly aged; 
and this is where the confusion begins.   How much aging is enough aging? 
 
There is a good discussion on this in the current issue of Brewing Techniques 
Magazine (Vol. 4, No. 4) in the letters to editor section. 
 
I would recommend picking up the magazine, but to summarize comments by Ralph 
Olson of HOPUNION.  He said that samples sent to a brewery who was use to 
German hops were reported to be too grassy and they preferred the German hops 
(Germany doesn't use cold storage like domestic hop merchants).  HOPUNION then 
sent a second sample (from the same bale of hops) for further evaluation. 
This time they were set out at room temperature for two weeks to oxidize in a 
non-vacuum sealed package.  The brewery reported back that they liked the 
second sample much better and went on to say that they were more like the 
German hops that they were use to buying.

On the contrary, I ask you to provide a non-amateur reference that says 
they are *sterilants*.  There are hundreds of pieces of bad advice in the 
dozens of amateur beer and winemaking books.  I am no more likely to find 
a professional text or biology book that says that sulphites do not sterilize 
than I am to find a physics text that says force does not equal mass times 
acceleration. 
 
The book you reference does not say they "sterilize."  This is a very specific 
term and according to Webster's (in our context) it means "to free from living 
microorganisms."  This is ideally what we would like, but short of pressure 
cooking, we can't get our wort or must to this level in the kitchen.  In labs, 
there's also irradiation, but that's another topic. 
 
The book you reference says "disinfect" and "antiseptic."  According to 
Webster's, "disinfect" means "to free from infection, esp. by destroying 
harmful microorganisms."  Sounds good, but "disinfectant" means "a chemical 
that destroys vegetative forms of harmful microorganisms esp. on inanimate 
objects but that may be less effective in destroying bacterial spores." 
As I read it, a disinfectant does not sterilize, so "disinfect" is not 
equivalent to "sterilize." 
 
Webster's says something even more interesting about "antiseptic:"  "a 
substance that checks the growth or action of microorganisms..." 
 
I would say that this is very close to what I posted about sulphites on 
960711: 
 
>Contrary to popular belief and many incorrect homebrewing books, 
>metabisulfites (sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, Campden 
>tablets) are NOT sanitizers.  They work by releasing [sulfur dioxide]

Then Dave writes: 
>The bottom line is, however, acidic solutions of metabisulfite with a pH less 
>than 3.0 are excellent sterilants for yeast and bacteria 
 
No Dave... you added the word "excellent" out of the blue and substituted 
(incorrectly) "sterilants" for "antiseptics."  The REAL bottom line is 
that sulfites may kill some yeasts and bacteria, but all we can count on is 
that they INHIBIT the activity of pre-existing microorganisms and give our 
cultured yeasts a chance to outcompete them for the nutrients and sugars. 
 
*** 
On the subject of seeded versus unseeded hops, there is a fantastic article 
by Gail Nickerson (and, I believe Alfred Haunold) in the first issue of 
Brewing Techniques.  While this is out-of-print, it is available at the 
BT website (sorry, don't have the URL).

Russ writes:

Yes.  The *Scottish* Ale strain has a tendency to give smoky notes to the 
beer.  This would be unwelcome in a Brown Ale, in my opinion.  At the 1995 
Chicago Beer Society (1996 AHA Homebrew Club of the Year) Spooky Brew Review, 
I judged a Scottish Ale that was *too* smoky.  I later found the brewer and 
asked how much smoked malt he used... "none," he said... "Wyeast Scottish Ale 
yeast."

Perhaps most American oak casks are made to be used by the whiskey industry, 
but it is incorrect to say that these are the only type of American oak 
barrels available to homebrewers.  First of all, whiskey barrels are charred. 
What we want (whether we are brewing pLambic, Flanders Brown/Red or English 
ales) is uncharred oak.  If it is unlined, uncharred American oak casks you 
want, ask your retailer to get them from L.D.Carlson.  They have something 
like seven sizes from 1 or 2 gallons up to 50 gallons. 
 
I would be very interested in your source regarding the alleged extraction 
of fusel oils from the whiskey by the charcoal.  I don't see why there is 
any incentive for the alcohols to pass into the charcoal.  Furthermore, 
what's so special about fusel oils (aka fusel alcohols, aka higher alcohols) 
that they, and not ethanol, would be extracted from the whiskey?  Try to be 
brief.

Subject: Fruit, Temp Controller


Iggy Ed on Fruit: 
>Does the second 24 ounces need to be boiled or heated or anything. 
>I'd hate for this expensive raspberry batch to be ruined by something. 
 
I would strongly suggest pasteurizing the fruit. This will kill any 
wild yeasts that may be on it (wild yeasts can ferment sugars not 
normally fermented, causing gushers and bottle bombs). 
 
The method I use is to place the fruit in ziplock bags and freeze. Then 
boil a couple of gallons of water, turn off heat and drop the bags of 
fruit into the water. Let sit for about 30 mins, remove from the water, 
and mash the fruit between your fingers while still in the bag. Once 
fruit has turned to juice, snip the corner off the bag and dump into 
fermenter. 
 
Temperature Controllers: 
Can someone tell me a source for temperature controllers? I would like 
to build a fermentation chiller (like described on Martys page). I would 
like the controller to be able to control both hot and cold. I plan on 
using this with ice in the summer and a heater in the winter. The controller 
needs to be able to switch 115 VAC and control temperatures between 32F and 
70F. 
 
Note: I've seen the schematics for temperature controllers on the web but 
electronics are not my gig. If anyone would offer to make a controller for 
me I would gladly pay...

Subject: electronic burner ignition


Hello fellow homebewers!  Yesterday I came up with a neat little 
addition to my brewing setup and, since I've never heard it mentioned 
here before, I thought I'd share... 
 
The way that my system is built, it is difficult to access my burner 
to light it when a full keg is on top of it.  Even with a long 
lighter, it is a stretch to get the flame close enough to the 
burner, and I frequently found myself burning a knuckle or melting my 
lighter on a boiling hot kettle when trying to re-light a burner that 
had been been turned off.  Not to mention the lighter running out of 
fuel or wearing out. 
 
Well, I was browsing through Lowe's yesterday (similar to Home Depot, 
only not as good) and came across a replacement ignition switch for 
gas grills.  It only cost $10, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.  It 
is a very simple item that looks like a large spark plug and 
generates an electric spark when its button is pressed.  (For an 
interesting visual effect, stick it on your tongue and press 
the button.  Besides seeing some neat colors & stars, it'll probably 
also knock out your loose fillings!) 
 
The only difficult part was mounting it, since it is designed to go 
on a gas grill, not a ring burner.  But I was able to securely wedge 
it into place using an included metal extension tab.  It sits right 
up against the openings on top of my ring burner with the metal tab 
extending back against the wall of my burner and fits very snugly in 
place. Currently the wire and button are hanging loose, but as soon 
as I can buy or borrow a 3/4" drill bit I will mount the button 
permanantly on my 2-tier wooden frame.  Now lighting my grill is as 
simple as opening a valve and pressing a button!  I am very pleased 
with it. 
 
Not sure how you would mount one on a jet burner, but I'll leave that 
as an excercise for the reader.  Enjoy, and let me know if you need 
better descriptions of what I did.
