Subject: Nitrosoamines as a Carcinogen


> Now I do not know how deadly nitrosamines are, or how much would 
> be formed by gassing with NO2, or whether this is just lawsuit 
> paranoia. 
 
My college chemistry book, _Chemistry: The Central Science_, 3rd Edition, 
Theodore Brown and H. Eugene LeMay, Jr, ISBN 0-13-128950-0, 1985, pg. 664, 
has this to say on the topic of nitrites in food: 
 
"Sodium Nitrite is used a food additive in cured meats such as hot dogs, 
ham, and cold cuts.  The NO2- serves two functions:  It inhibits growth of 
bacteria, especially Clostridium botulinum, which produces the potentially 
fatal food poisoning known as botulism.  The nitrite also preserves the 
red color of the meat and thereby its appetizing appearance.  Debate over 
the continued use of nitrites in cured meat products centers on the fact 
that HNO2 can react with certain organic compounds to form compounds know 
as nitrosoamines.  These are compounds of the type give in Figure 20.24 
[see below].  These organic compounds have been shown to produce cancer in 
laboratory animals.  Although no human cancer has been linked to nitrites 
in meat, that potential has caused the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
to reduce the limits of allowable concentrations of NO2- in foods."

Larry, leave your private e-mail address next post so we don't 
need to clutter the digest with repetitious suggestions. 
 
It looks to me like you've tried a million different things.  I 
would recommend you do an full mash (all-grain) and use a low 
temp (150F) conversion rest, and also use some unroasted barley. 
It's possible that the way to get rid of those vanilla tones is 
not by removing something, but by adding something that changes 
the body or the dryness, and that something may be raw barley. 
Use flakes, too, they're much easier.  (Also, yeah, use the 
Wyeast Irish ale and keep the temps low, while you're at it.) 
 
No guarantees, just grasping at straws here.  (Half-informed 
stuff like this I prefer to keep off the digest, but I do 
want to say it.)

I would first refer those of you who care to an article in Zymurgy John Palmer 
and I wrote on cleaners and sanitizers.  I think it appeared in 1995 sometime. 
And if you really want the REAL answers on terminology and what is or is not a 
disinfectant, sterilant, sanitizer ad nauseum then I refer you to 
"Disinfection, Sterilization and Preservation" edited by Block.  As Al points 
out terminology is widely misused here and elsewhere.

Subject: fusel alcohols


In HBD #2135 Al K asks: 
 
>I would be very interested in your source regarding the alleged extraction 
>of fusel oils from the whiskey by the charcoal.  I don't see why there is 
>any incentive for the alcohols to pass into the charcoal.  Furthermore, 
>what's so special about fusel oils (aka fusel alcohols, aka higher alcohols)

>brief. 
 
There is a simple explanation for this.  Whiskey is a polar medium and 
charcoal is a nonpolar medium.  A natural partitioning takes place at the 
whiskey/charcoal interface.  The more polar molecules will tend to stay dis- 
solved in the whiskey, while the more nonpolar molecules will tend to adsorb 
to the charcoal.  This is the "like dissolves like" catchphrase many of you 
are familiar with from organic chemistry classes. 
 
Both ethanol and the fusel alcohols possess the polar hydroxyl group, but the 
fusel alcohols carry around bigger pieces of nonpolar baggage (i.e. the rest 
of the molecule), and thus have more of a tendency to adsorb to the charcoal. 
 
This is the same separation principle involved in passing water through a char-
coal filter to remove the nonpolar compounds (e.g. chlorine, residual organic 
compounds) that are dissolved in it.

Bob, the only number I have for that competition is (415) 892-7196. If 
that is the number that is disconnected you may want to try a number

Subject: Backpacks and State laws


The problem with the backpacks at the GABF is more than 
likely rooted in State law. Unfortuately, these are different 
in all 50 states. In some, the whole idea of the GABF would 
probably be illegal. Here in Washington, it is nicer to have 
festivals. Next Saturday, I'm going to the Prosser Wine and 
Food Fair. There is wine and micro-beer tasting by script and 
you can buy bottles or cases of the ones you like to take home. 
In Denver, you can't do this evidently. All beer in the festival 
grounds needs to be consumed there or destroyed. The literature 
that I have on the festival (for brewers) says that the volunteers 
will help finish off what's left since it can't go back to 
distributors or be taken off the premises. It's a state or local 
law. 
 
So, this brings me to my point. Who says the Great AMERICAN Beer 
Festival has to be in Denver, Colorado all the time? Why not go 
to Seattle or Portland? The Great BRITISH Beer Festival moves 
around from city to city each year. I'm sure the festival 
people could find a city that has friendlier laws and just as 
fine a facility. I think the festival could make more money if 
the beer could be sold for take out at full retail (GABF seems 
to loose money every few years). It could do this in some states.

Subject: PET


A recent article in the Wall Street Journal reported that some breweries in 
Austria, England, and even the U.S. are testing the use of PET 
(polyethylene terephthalate) bottles. 
 
This got me to wondering about the pros and cons of plastic bottles. Having 
never used PET, the obvious advantage to me would be they are lightweight 
and don't shatter if dropped. 
 
What are the collective's experiences with PET? Since it is clear, is 
skunking a danger like with clear glass? Is it difficult to clean and do 
tastes linger? Will it hold proper CO2 pressure and for how long? Do you 
bottle condition or must you use a counterpressure filler? Is PET 
sufficiently oxygen-barrier? 
 
Private e-mail is fine and I will post a summary, or if you think the 
interest is wide enough, post to the HBD.

Hi all! 
 
  In HBD 2135 Gregory writes about losing several batches to a "funk". 
  Some time back I went through a simular experience and yes losing 
  a batch takes an emotional toll, oh the utter sorrow all those 
  little yeastie beasties working, living, reproducing, dying all 
  for not!  The way I put an end to my beer "funk" was by replacing 
  every piece of plastic and hose in my brewery (I think it was my 
  large blow-off tube that was the cause) while this cost a few $$ 
  the results were worth it. I now use glass carboys, a glass blow-off 
  tube and replace my racking tube and hose about eveey dozen batches 
  or so.

Gregory C. Furlich on Tue, 6 Aug 96 said that his beer " has the funk has 
the funk".  He also said "The beer usually becomes infected during racking, 
 
either to a secondary or a bottling bucket". 
 
I suggest you buy another length of racking tube.  For the small amount of 
$ involved, its a good start to reduce the risk.   If you rack through a 
tap (unusual but possible) give this a good scrub or soak in bleach/idophor 
etc. 
If this doesnt work and you are satisfied that the fermenters are as clean 
as you can get them, try alternating the room that you use for racking in 
case there is a bug in the air.  I have a vague memory that there was a 
previous thread in which someone believed the reason he had several 
infections was that he worked in the kitchen and there were "bugs" on the 
grain the family used for bread making.  They were not a problem for the 
bread, but that they cross infected the brew through the air.  Cannot offer 
any other suggestions.

it went out.  In case he doesn't get my note in time or in some 
other way is unable to cancel it, here is the one that I meant to 
send.  Again, sorry for the bandwidth. 
<< 
Well, I received 12 replies to my LONG post about not being able to 
bring backpacks into the GABF.  Sorry it was so lengthy, but I was 
very upset at the time and I was working it out on the keyboard and I 
didn't even think to look at how many bytes it was before posting it. 
I got 6 replies that were very sympothetic with my rantings and most 
of the other 6 were only critical with my approach to the problem and 
that if I continued to have the harsh feelings that I was experiencing 
that I wouldn't be able to enjoy the festival.  I am going to attend 
the Rocky Mt. Bluegrass Festival tomarrow through Sunday and will 
take a couple of kegs of weissen with me so I'm sure I'll have a much 
better attitude when I get back.  I'll try to respond to the personal 
E-mail on Monday.  (Thanks guys) 
 
Our Digest Janitor sent a note on the subject, a quote follows:

The rest of his note was equally congenial.  Now that I know that the 
AOB is not involved with the Festival I guess I owe them an appology. 
I would like to see a diagram of the things that the AOB is involved in 
and what the "pecking order" is, just out of curiosity though.  I don't 
know who or what the "Brewing Matters" organisation is, and I already 
know more than I want to about the ATF.

Hello All, 
 
Does anybody know of a source for recipies,(food recipies), using beer. 
I know beer is food, but I have a really good pale ale on tap that goes 
great with most anything off the grill. Thats why I thought if I could 
incorporate the beer with the food, then I really would have something! 
 
I was thinking along the lines of maybe a marinate for steaks or ? I've 
heard of cooking brats in beer, anyone ever tried this? I know the 
collective must have some ideas. 
 
Sorry if this is not completely homebrew related, but if anyone knows

Subject: Air,Coolers


Greetings, all. 
 
This weekend I thieved some porter from a carboy to see how the 
secondary is doing.  It was delicious and I will bottle it soon. 
Upon reinserting the stopper and airlock, the question came to me- 
have I now allowed air to fill the headspace which is a bit larger 
now that I've taken some beer out ??   I've never thieved before, 
but I know it's a common way to evaluate fermentation.  Without 
active bubbling, is there a concern of leaving fresh air in there ?? 
 
Second question - Has anyone bought a 5 gal Gott for mashing and 
later wished they had 'Gotten' (sorry) the 10 gal instead; or 
vice-versa.  I have heard that initially getting a 10 gal is good. 
Others say a 10 is too big for a 5 gal batch.  I've read the faqs, 
just looking for some personal experiences. 
 
Cheers,

Subject: RE:  Funky beer, chocolate beer, ranting


     Greg Furlich writes about his funky beer.  The symptoms you describe 
     are caused by infection (as he already knows).  However, just because 
     the beer tastes OK at bottling doesn't mean it hasn't been infected 
     before then.  Sometimes the wild microbes that infect your beer aren't 
     able to get going until after your yeast has quieted down.  The 
     pitched yeast are able to outcompete them until they run out of food 
     (fermentable sugars, other nutrients).  Once the yeast are out of 
     food, the wild microbes can get going on the stuff the brewer's yeast 
     couldn't metabolize (dextrins, etc.). 
 
     The result is beer that tastes fine when it's young, but becomes funky 
     with age.  Either drink it VERY young (like Hoegaarden's white beer 
     was in the old days), or improve sanitation. 
 
     You must examine ALL aspects of your sanitation, not just bottling 
     time. 
     ------------------------------ 
     John Penn writes about chocolate beer with white stuff on the surface. 
     Sounds like an infection.  I've brewed with large quantities of 
     chocolate (2 lbs baker's/4 gallons), and not seen that.  I seem to 
     remember a recent post describing the same infection, but can't recall 
     it specifically.  Keep in mind that not every invading microbe will 
     destroy your beer in the same way.  If your "lucky" the beer may be 
     drinkable for a while, especially if you keep it cold. 
 
     By the way, don't the acetobacters cause a film on the beer's surface? 
     ------------------------------- 
     I hate to do this, and will keep it VERY short.  PLEASE STOP USING 
     THIS FORUM FOR NON-BREWING ISSUES.  This IS NOT the place for 
     discussing the policies of the GABF, BATF, or anybody else! 
 
     I have sent private E-mails to offenders, but new people keep doing 
     this, and I can't keep up!  PLEASE STOP IT!

Subject: Effects of aging in oak barrels & whisky


First Rob asked, then David replied: 
>The fusel oils are extracted from the whiskey into this charcoal... 
 
I wonder what this would do to hop flavor and aroma?  I want to "lay in" a 
high-alcohol spruce/spiced barleywine this Fall for serving in Fall '97 but 
I'm concerned how it will age in oak, will I have any flavor or aroma (not 
much... but I like it...) left when I tap it? 
 
Also, while I'd do a standard primary and secondary in glass, I assume that 
there wouldn't need to be much done to the wood to sterilize it if you're 
packing in 12-15% alcohol. But has anyone tried this?  This would be almost 
a 10-12 month storage... I'm also a bit concerned regarding the ability of 
the barrel to stand up to the aging... but that *is* what they are made 
for, no? 
 
>I do wonder how the old scotches stored this way compare to today's? 
 
If you're seriously interested, you should try The Macallen single-malt. 
It's aged in French sherry casks... adds a very nice color and hint of 
flavor.  You can check out their website too, at : 
http://www.regionlink.com/grampian/macallan/ 
 
Thanks for anyone's input on the casking question above...

Subject: need dark cherry porter recipe


Greetings Fellow Brewers/Brewsters: 
 
A while ago, at a great little brew pub in Portsmouth, NH, I had a chance to 
try their most remarkable dark cherry porter.  The flavor was reminiscent of 
my father's dark cherry cigars...just a wonderfaul aroma and taste. 
 
By any chance, have any of you brewed such a beer?  I'd really like to find 
a recipe for this type of porter. 
 
Many thanks.

I am astonished at these times. I have brewed a lot of wit and consistantly 
score high 30's to low 40's. Greg Noonan gave it a 40 recently. The beer 
drops from 1.048 to 1.010 in 3 days and goes into the keg at 7 days. It is 
acidified on day 8 and has been judged as early as day 9. A very astute 
judge said that the beer could use more time for the acid to round out and 
gave it 3rd place in best of show. By day 11, it was perfect. 
 
All the wit yeasts I have used  (BrewTek is my favorite)are on steroids and 
give a very vigorous, quick fermentation. You guys are doing something 
REALLY wrong. I'd bet on a wild yeast infection.

I have been a homebrewer for many years but have tried to keep it 
very simple. I have some questions relating to Killians Irish Brown 
Ale: 
   1.Relating to type.  Is Irish Brown a specific type? 
   2.Is there a simple way to recreate this ale as homebrew? 
 
 Also is there a source for replacement Cornelius keg fittings (inlet

Subject: Sparging technique, mashout.


A question for all you all-grainers out there ! When sparging is it 
better to simply drain the entire mash tun of sweet wort and THEN begin 
sparging or is it better to SLOWLY drain the wort while adding sparge 
water to the top of the mash tun ? It seems to be that it might be better 
(and faster) to just drain the wort, add hot sparge water and then slowly 
sparge away for the next 30 minutes. Anyone tried this ? 
 
I usually mash for 3 or 4 hours (more convenient for my schedule on 
weekends). Do I still need to do a 170 F mashout or can I just go ahead 
and start sparging since all enzyme activity should surely be finished by 
this time ?

RIMS Questions: 
I am torn between using a sanke keg or a Gott cooler as a mash tun. 
I will be using BrewCraft's Temperature Controller and Heating unit 
with a March pump for heating/recirculating the mash. 
 
With this setup: 
Would heat loss be a problem on an uninsulated sanke? 
 
What's the max capacity of a 10 gallon Gott (lbs of grain)? 
 
What kind of hose do RIMS users prefer? 
 
Where can I get high temp hose cheap? Anyone have some for sale? 
 
Has anyone tried using a sump pump (or toliet bowl) type float to 
regulate the sparge water level in the mash tun? 
 
When sparging, is there any advantage to draining off the first runnings 
from the tun, adding sparge water, recirculating and repeating the process 
till kettle is at desired volume? 
 
When chilling the wort, has anyone tried recirculating the wort through 
a counterflow chiller until the desired temperature is reached?

Larry, 
My buddy, Andy Q, and I have also been looking for the perfect Guiness 
lookalike. We spent weeks pouring over recipes from all sorts of sources. As 
we gathered data, there seemed to be some similarities in some of the better 
looking recipes. Fortunately, for us, many of the references were for 
partial grain type brews. 
Here's our recipe for the stout that we like a LOT!  : 
 
Hopeless Condition Oatmeal StoutThis recipe is the original creation of 
Orville Deutchman and Andrew Quinzani, and was first brewed at Q-Brew 
Brewery on June 20, 1996 ( a special day, indeed!). It was the very first 
attempt at an oatmeal stout, and combined the best suggestions for 
ingredients and technique from a multitude of sources. It is a partial grain 
recipe. It was developed as a 6 gallon recipe. 
 
Ingredients   (six gallon batch) 
 1 1/4 pounds of quick (cut and rolled) oats 
 2 pounds, 6-row pale malted barley 
 1/2  pound crystal malt 
 1/4 pound dextrine malt 
 1/2 pound chocolate malt 
 1/4 pound roasted barley 
 4 pounds light diastatic liquid malt extract 
 4 teaspoons gypsum 
 1 oz bullion hops 
 1 oz willamette hops 
 1/2 oz fuggle hops 
 1 1/2 packages of ale yeast (Irish) <1084 Wyeast Irish?> 
Proceedure 
Place 5 1/2 quarts of water in a pot. Add 2 teaspoons of gypsum, and stir 
(gypsum won't completely dissolve). 
Place malted grains (6-row pale, crystal, dextrine, chocolate, and roasted 
barley) in a grain bag along with 1 1/4 pounds of oats, and place in the pot. 
Add heat slowly and carefully to raise the temp to 130 degrees. 
Hold at 130 degrees for 1/2 hour. 
Add an additional 3 quarts of warm water (approx 130 degrees) to the pot. 
(8 1/2 quarts total now) 
Add 2 pounds of diastatic liquid malt extract, stirring thoroughly, and 
raise temp to 150 degrees. 
Hold at 150 degrees for an additional 15 minutes. 
Stir in the additional 2 teaspoons of gypsum into an additional 2 quarts of 
water (150 degrees) in a separate pot, and then add to the pot. (10 1/2 
quarts <2 1/4 gallons>total water now) 
Raise the temp to 158 degrees, and hold for 15 minutes. 
At this point, the extraction process should be complete, so sparge the bags 
of grain with 1 1/2 gallons of 170 degree water. This brings the total in 
the pot to 3 3/4 gallons, or 16 1/2 quarts. 
Remove the pot from the heat and add remaining 2 pounds of diastatic liquid 
malt extract, and stir well to dissolve. 
Raise the heat on the pot until a rolling boil is achieved. 
Add 1 oz bullion hops 
At 30 minutes into the boil (30 minutes left), add 1 oz willamette hops 
At 45 minutes into the boil (15 minutes left), add 1/2 oz fuggle hops, and 
1/4 teaspoon Irish Moss. 
Remove any hot break as it develops! 
At the end of the boil, remove the pot from the stove, and chill with a wort 
chiller to 110 degrees. 
Place 1 1/4 gallons (5 quarts) of cold tap water in the 6 gallon primary. 
Strain wort through previously rinsed grain bag, into the primary, to remove 
cold break. 
Check temp to assure that it is near to 72 degrees (not much over 80 
degrees). Record temp:                           
Check specific gravity and record:                        
Stir vigorously to incorporate lots of oxygen. 
Add yeast, and seal with cover and air lock. 
 
Continued 
 After a week or so (maybe less?), transfer to secondary carboy. Record 
specific gravity:                           
When final gravity is about 1.011-1.015 (a bit higher than some ales...), or 
when no fermenting is at all present, it is time to keg and enjoy! Record 
final gravity: 
 
Final Notes: It may be OK to do the initial partial mash by just bringing 
mash temp up to 150 degrees for 1/2 hour, and then adding 2 pounds of 
diastatic for 1/2 hour, and then just going to full boil. However, it was 
felt that closely following the suggestion of Charlie Papazian was prudent 
for the first try. While he may not even get any of this brew, this recipe 
was developed at the urging of Mike (Mr. Toast) Landry. The goal was 
somewhere between Mill City's Oatmeal Stout, and Guiness Stout. 
 
Taste Test Results: Reduce the amount of Roasted Barley to 1/8 pound to get 
rid of the burnt taste. 
 
 
Hope you try it, and enjoy it!
