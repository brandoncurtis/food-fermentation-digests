Subject: HBD Problems AGAIN :-(


The !(*#&^`at`# list was truncated again.  Unfortunatly things are a tad 
confused on my end and the backup that I carefully made after it was 
fixed earlier also became corrupted.  Therefore there will unfortunatly 
be people on the list that didn't want to be on the list and visa 
versa. 
 
Again, if you are subscribed/unsubscribed and you want to be 
unsubscribed/subscribed instead, please mail 
homebrew-digest-request`at`aob.org and say:

end 
 
or: 
 
unsubscribe 
end 
 
as appropriate.  If this doesn't work, THEN send me e-mail.  Please 
don't send me e-mail saying "I got off the list again" or "why did I 
get a 'you have joined' message" or "I've unsubscribed 20 times and I'm 
still getting the `at`#$ HBD."  I realize that these things are happening 
and I apologize, unfortunatly I've had to cobble together a pretty old 
backup and reconstruct the recent additions/removals as best I can. 
For those of you that think I'm slacking, I've spent 24 of the last 48 
hours on this and a related problem. 
 
The good news is that I've added a list of the scheduled subjects for 
the next digest to the confirmation/rejection message when posts to the 
digest are submitted.

Subject: Wyeast #1338 "European" Ale is slow to start


Hi All, 
Is Wyeast #1338 "European" Ale yeast usually slow to start? I "smacked" 
a pack and after 24 hours `at`75 degrees, the pack was not puffed-up. I 
made a starter `at`~36 hours and the pouch was only puffer to about 1/2 
inch. The starter is now bubbling at ~2 1/2 days. Bubbling is VERY slow. 
No steps in my process have changed from the norm. 
Any experienced users of this strain, who would offer information, might 
tell me of this yeast's character. 
Thanks, 
Brian

Subject: Righteous Real Ale


This weekend I brewed Papazian's Righteous Real Ale. He lists the OG as 
1.036, but mine was 1.043. Do I have something closer to an ESB rather 
than an ordinary bitter? Does anyone know why the OG was so high?

Subject: Reusing Yeast 


 
Fellow Homebrewers, 
 
 What is the best way to reuse yeast? I have heard that you just 
take the yeastly sludge at the bottom of the carboy (after racking from 
primary to secondary), put it in a sanitized jar, cover the jar (but not 
airtight), and store in the fridge. Is this sanitary? How long will the 
yeast last? What if I put the yeast in the freezer? How many times can I 
reuse the same yeast? 
 By the way, I am using liquid yeast.

Subject: Aeration, Ester who?


From: Charlie Scandrett <merino`at`buggs.cynergy.com.au> 
 
>But yes, a vigorous fermentation can be obtained without aeration. (Notice 
that I dared not touch the ester thread again.)
 
Guess I missed that one but just for the record, the object of my 
experiment was to verify claims that various gimmicks for aeration 
dramatically decreased the time to onset of fermentation. 
 
I never questioned or disputed any of the other reasons for aeration. 
 
The report on my experiment is in the Applications Notes section of our 
web page for anyone who missed it. 
 
I aerate my wort for all of the proper reasons but think I proved that 
it has no measureable effect on when fermentation begins.  I find the 
simplest method of aeration to be just forcing the wort through a small 
nozel so it squirts vigorously in the fermenter.  This is nothing more 
elaborate than a piece of 1/4" copper tubing that has  the end squeezed 
with a pliers.  It creates enough foam that is has to be squited down 
a half dozen times during the pumping operation and seems to provide 
enough oxygen to deal with all those other evils.

Subject: Shipping Homebrew


What's the scoop on shipping my homebrew to my friends out of state? I 
live in Florida and would like to send a few bottles to friends in Ohio 
and Alabama. Is it legal? So I have to tell the post office what's in my 
package? I know people do this for contests. 
Finally, does anyone have an idea for the approximate cost of say two or 
three 12oz bottles? 
 Thanks...Kevin

The two times I've used this yeast, the smokey note has been very faint; I may 
have even imagined it. What *is* this smokey character anyway? Is it a type of 
ester that is unique to this strain of yeast? If so, then that could explain 
the variation (higher ferment temps = more smokey flavor, perhaps?) Or are the 
little buggers all carrying tiny bottles of liquid smoke? :-) 
 
Reason I ask is that I'd like to attempt a Scotch ale (again; my first try had 
some problems), and I'd actually like to *increase* the smokey character a 
bit.

Subject: Problem with B-T-F


  I bought a new metal screen at Walmart.  I was soaking it in B-T-F/water 
to sterilize it.  When I was taking it out it made a sound like throwing 
frozen french-fries into hot oil.  I noticed that my 5-Gal container's 
temperature increased at least 20 degrees.  And at the bottom of the bucket 
was a greyish sludge.  I washed off the screen and then dipped it again to 
sterilize it.  I used the screen to filter the now cooled wort into my 
primary bucket.  My beer has this strange medicine(y) taste.  Even after 4 
weeks. 
  Will this taste settle out?  And what stepps can I do so that this 
doesn't happen again?

I know that this not a strictly beer related question, and I'm sorry if I'm 
wasting anyones time but I am in need of a good pickled egg recipe. email 
would be great, thanks for the time. 
 
Better living through fermentation.

Reciept of the HBD, as of late, has been very spotty here. Is there a
