Brewsters: 
 
AlK writes in a somewhat insistent tone that my comments are incorrect. He even
quotes Webster! 
 
Al, in my last post on this I tried to give you a way out by quoting the effect
of sulfites as a function of pH as it relates to beer. 
 
Facts are that acidic sulfites in the region below 3 are excellent sterilants. 
 
I quote from "Table Wines"  op.cit  p399 
 
"As Cruess (1912) and others have shown, 100mg per liter ( 6 oz of potassium 
metabisulfite per ton) will eliminate over 99.9 per cent of the active cells of
micro-organism from normal musts." 
 
How do you think Webster will define "eliminate".  Is "over 99.9%" enough to 
classify sulfites as a sterilant? 
 
Drink more beer and less coffee. 
 
 
Keep on brewin'

I'd like to send a 1 Liter PET bottle full of my favorite pale ale to a friend 
in another state. Is it legal? Or the more important question: What will 
happen to the beer? I'm afraid of the bottle exploding in the post office or 
something and freaking out the postal workers (we don't want to do that). 
I was thinking about doing it right after bottling the beer. I guess I could 
even send him the beer and the priming sugar. Has anyone ever done this?

Subject: RE: Temp Controller


In HBD #2135, John Varady asked about temp controllers for both heating and 
cooling. 
I had the problem last winter of fermenting in a refrigerator in an outbuilding
exposed to the cold. A couple of ferments were stopped by unexpected low temps.
I already had a controller to control the refrigeration part but nothing 
to provide heat if it got too cold.  My existing controller was a SPST, 
that is it would switch off if the temp fell below the set point and switch 
on if it rose above.  I added a SPDT controller that would switch one way 
if below the set temp and another if above. I had already cut the hot wire 
to the original refrigerator controller and inserted the SPST controller 
in line.  I set the original controller to the coldest setting and controlled 
the temp with the SPST controller.  When I added the SPDT controller, I 
connected the hot wire to the input terminal of the SPDT, a wire from the 
falling temp terminal to a light bulb (I used the inside light), a wire 
from the rising side of the SPDT controller to the input side of the SPST 
controller, and a wire from the output side of the SPST to the original 
thermostat (this connection was already there from the previous setup). 
I set the SPDT to the minimum desired temp. and the SPST to the maximum 
desired temp.  When the temp falls below the set point on the SPDT controller 
it switches power to the light. When the temp rises above the set point on the 
SPDT controller it switches power to the SPST controller.  When the temp rises 
above the set point on the SPST controller it switches power (if it is getting 
any from the SPDT) to the original refrigerator controller. 
 
You could use the SPDT alone but then either the compressor 
would be on or the light would be.  I wanted to have a few degrees separation 
to try to minimize cycling.  Of course, if I ferment in glass I cover the 
carboy in an opaque trash bag.

I have used Wyeast #1338 on occasions before, although I couldn't say I'm an 
expert. It never caused any problems to start, but then, you really should 
wait until the packet is inflated properly, as it can take a few days (I 
have had packets that have taken up to 5 or 6 days to inflate, here in 
Tasmania they are usually not too fresh). 
You really have to like the malty flavour to use that yeast though! It has a 
very complex character, I couldn't really describe it. It is very nice though.

Subject: Re: Sparging technique, mashout / RE: RIMS Questions / Shawn's p


Ian Smith asks about his sparging technique.  While I am a fairly new 
all grain brewer, I think this is something I can comment on... 
 
> When sparging is it better to simply drain the entire mash tun of

> the wort while adding sparge water to the top of the mash tun ? 
 
No, no, no!  Always leave an inch or so of water on top of your grain 
bed!!!!  The water is supporting (ie floating) the grain on top of 
your false bottom.  You are almost sure to get a stuck sparge if you 
drain it all first. 
 
> It seems to be that it might be better (and faster) to just drain 
> the wort, add hot sparge water and then slowly sparge away for the

The words "better" and "faster" should never be used together when 
referring to sparging.  A slower sparge is *always* a better sparge. 
The slower you sparge the better your extraction effeciency.  Don't 
think of sparging as *washing* the sugars out of the grain.  Instead, 
think of it as adding fresh water to the top of the grain bed and 
letting gravity settle the heavier sugars down through the grain bed. 
The slower you sparge the better these sugars will settle. 
 
> Do I still need to do a 170 F mashout or can I just go ahead and 
> start sparging since all enzyme activity should surely be finished 
> by this time ? 
 
This point is more debatable.  Technically some enzyme activity *may* 
continue during the sparge if you don't mash out.  But practically 
speaking, I know of many brewers who skip this step, myself included. 
 
- --------------------- 
 
Then RUSt1d? <rust1d`at`li.com> posts a few questions about RIMS... 
 
> Would heat loss be a problem on an uninsulated sanke? 
 
I use an insulated sanke without much problem of heat loss.  I 
insulated the sides using a fiberglass wrap made for hot water tanks, 
and sprayed an insulating foam on the bottom dome of the keg.  I've 
had some discussions with Dion Hollenbeck about this and he thinks 
that SS is a poor conductor of heat anyway. 
 
> What's the max capacity of a 10 gallon Gott (lbs of grain)? 
 
Not sure what the max is, but I've done 20+ pounds without any 
problem.  Could have done another 10 pounds!  I think your limiting 
factor will be your boiling kettle more than your mash tun, unless 
you are making a barely wine or have a 20+ gallon kettle. 
 
> What kind of hose do RIMS users prefer? Where can I get high temp 
> hose cheap? 
 
I may get criticized on this one, but I just used what ever type of 
clear braided plastic tubing I could find at Home Depot.  I still 
don't think it is necessary to pay $2/ft or more just for a "Food 
Grade" stamp on your plastic tubing.  It has worked very well for me 
and holds up very well under mashing temperatures. 
 
> When sparging, is there any advantage to draining off the first 
> runnings from the tun, adding sparge water, recirculating and 
> repeating the process till kettle is at desired volume? 
 
I think this is a similar question to that asked by Ian Smith above. 
IMO, letting the water level drop below the surface of the grain bed 
while sparging is toying with the stuck-mash gods.  You'd better have 
an animal sacrifice ready to appease them. 
 
- ------------------------------ 
 
And finally, Shawn writes:

Shawn, I for one think you are doing great!  If anybody does feel 
that Shawn is slacking you can easily unsubscribe.  We all hope that 
Shawn can fix the problems that have been making the HBD erratic 
lately, but I think we also agree that an erratic HBD is better than 
no HBD.  Besides, when I've missed a few issues of the HBD I simply 
go to the new HBD homepage and read it online.  The URL can be found 
from the AOB's homepage listed at the top of your HBD!  Bookmark it!

I've been *amazed* at the heat retention of my kegs. They're uninsulated and 
only drop about 1 degF in 30 minutes on a warm day (winter time is a 
different story).  With the temperature controller and a pump for 
recirculation, heat loss should be a non-problem. 
 
I strongly recommend that you recirculate the sweet liquor during the 
*entire* mash - it helps stir things up and keeps the temperature more 
uniform throughout the grainbed.  I'm pretty sure it's the recirculation 
that's helped my system achieve a consistent 34+ pts/lb/gal of extract 
efficiency.  Once I mash in, the pump comes on and doesn't go off again 
until the last drops of sweet wort have been sparged to the boiling kettle. 
 
>What's the max capacity of a 10 gallon Gott (lbs of grain)? 
 
Haven't seen a Gott cooler but if it holds 10 gallons, that should be plenty 
for doing nearly any 10 gallon batch; in my keg system, a 16 lb grain bill 
displaces about 8 to 9 gallons. 
 
>What kind of hose do RIMS users prefer? 
 
I'm using Norton PharMed - a medical-grade tubing rated for 250F; fairly 
thick walled, impervious to nearly anything, opaque and a bit expensive at 
around $4 per foot, only available in 25' rolls. 
 
>Where can I get high temp hose cheap? Anyone have some for sale? 
 
See if you can find a few other people to go in on it with you - I split a 
25' roll 3 ways and it came out to be a pretty good deal for everyone.  Call 
around locally to find a distributor of Norton tubing; places like Fisher 
Scientific and some of the other big mail-order places have incredibly 
inflated prices. 
 
>Has anyone tried using a sump pump (or toliet bowl) type float to 
>regulate the sparge water level in the mash tun? 
 
Not a bad idea (the float, that is) - but I've not had that much trouble; 
you just try to match the inflow of sparge water with the outflow of sweet 
wort and don't get too excited if it's a little more or less than the 
"perfect" level. 
 
>When sparging, is there any advantage to draining off the first runnings 
>from the tun, adding sparge water, recirculating and repeating the process 
>till kettle is at desired volume? 
 
I think this is called "batch sparging" or something like that and have 
heard discussions of it before.  Seems like an awful lot of work for very 
little gain to me. 
 
>When chilling the wort, has anyone tried recirculating the wort through 
>a counterflow chiller until the desired temperature is reached? 
 
I was going to try it this weekend on a 10 gal pale ale but things went to 
hell in a handbasket as I was trying to cool with an immersion chiller and I 
got way too flustered to even think about it.  (The pump got plugged up; I 
had to blow in the hose to clear it out and dropped a spoon into the wort 
which had to be fished out bare-handed.  If this batch doesn't go bad on me, 
it'll be a miracle. But I digress....)  The idea of recirculating through 
the chiller seemed like a good idea and shouldn't take very long if you have 
a decent chiller.  My problem this time of year is the 72F tap water...

We here in South Africa have been using the PET bottles for homebrew and

liter,1.5 liter and 2 liter. They are coated to prevent excessive gas 
leakage and are coloured brown or green so skunking is not a problem. They 
are very durable and reuseable. The caps are ,funny enough, available only

Subject: blackberry-lambic


Dear HB, 
 
My blackberry crop is pretty good this year and I am planning on brewing a 
blackberry ale. I just don't know how. 
 
Most fruit homebrews I have tried so far were simply too sour (may be too 
young) and not fruity enough. I am pretty sure that is because the wrong 
microorgansms (yeast/bacteria) were used. 
 
>From my limited winemaking experience I know, that after the sugar is 
degraded, there still is CO2 production due to malolactic fermentation, which 
degrades malic acid to lactic acid and thus reduces the acidity. From my 
german wheat beers I know, that only certain yeast are able to produce an 
estery = fruity aroma. I should probably use a belgian yeast/bacteria mixture 
for lambics but I don't want to keep the beer in my secondary for half a 
year, like Papazian suggests. 
 
So how can I brew a nice blackberry lambic, which isn't sour and doesn't 
block my equipment for too long. 
 
Please send your suggestions to "hettsmac`at`aol.com". I will summarize and 
post. 
 
Thanks for your replies.

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager... 
 
Greg Furlich reports a white ring around the neck of his bottles that 
disappears upon chilling. I doubt an infection. Being that the ring disappears 
upon chilling it most likely has to do with the dissolution of gasses at 
higher temperature. As the temp decreases and the capacity for dissolved CO2 
increases, this ring of tiny bubbles re-dissolves. 
 
Greg: if you're convinced it's an infection and feel you just have to dsipose

Subject: Sparging - an alternative?


My colleague and I were discussing brewing beer (as usual), specifically 
sparging, and he came up with the following question: 
 
If sparging is the process of leaching out the sugars from the grains, why 
not dump *all* the water in the mashtun at conversion, stir like h*ll for a 
few minutes to dissolve the sugars, and then just drain the whole lot, 
thereby completely eliminating the long process of sparging? The stirring 
with fresh water ought to dissolve the sugars as effectively as the 
sparging. All that remains is to drain the lot, with perhaps a second 
stir-up with fresh water to get those last sugars out. 
 
My knowledge at this stage is too sparse to answer this question.

Nuthin better than a chewey Guinness with a thick foamy head that

beverage.  Does anybody know what it is?  Am I on the road to cancer in

into the stout that I brew?  I think that this issue deserves some 
debate on HBD. 
 
Also, to the guy who who "demanded" an apology for the use of the term 
"red-neck."  Please educate the rest of us on why this is such a 
derogatory term.  Forgive me, but I think of a "red-neck" militia type 
and I immediately think of the alleged perpetrators (innocent until

Are "Beer-balls" packaged in PET plastic.  How about "Party-Pigs," 
aren't they PET plastic? 
 
Although I don't find beer out of a "beer-ball" tasty, I do usually 
find it to be "fresh."  Any opinions?

Subject: Sanitizeing bottles in the oven 
 
I have occasionally seen comments about sanitizeing bottles by putting 
foil over the neck and stacking them in the oven and heating them up. 
What is the procedure for this.  Specifically how hot and how long? 
Anyone have any comments on this technique?

I oven sanitize all the time and never had a problem.  I rinse bottles 
immediately after use and dry them.  After I've accumulated 30 or so in a 
covered box, I cover the mouths with aluminum foil and stand them up in the 
oven.  I heat to 50C for 15 minutes, then 100C for 15 minutes, then 150C for 
30 minutes.  You'll have to translate to fahrenheit yourselves. 
F=(9/5*C)+32 (clue: 150C=302F).  My oven is electric, but that shouldn't 
matter.  I leave them to cool overnight, then store indefinitely in a closed 
carton until I'm ready to bottle.

     Mike responds to Al's post about Wyeast Scottish ale yeast giving the 
     beer a smoky flavor.  This is probably caused by phenols, not esters. 
     Some yeast strains are just prone to doing this.  The possible 
     solutions to this are: 
               1.  Use a different yeast 
               2.  Split the batch, fermenting a portion with the Scott's 
     yeast and the rest with a cleaner yeast, then blend the batches to 
     achieve the desired flavor 
               3.  Play around with fermentation parameters (temp) to see 
     if you can reduce phenol production. 
     ----------------------- 
     Brian tells us that his Wyeast 1338 is a slow starter.  By 
     coincidence, I just happened to be making a starter of that and the 
     1084 side by side this week and had the exact same experience. 
 
     Although the 1338 had a more recent manufacture date, it took twice as 
     long to get going.  Can't be our fault, the package wasn't even 
     opened, and I had a different strain doing fine right next to it, so 
     mysterious time warps and temperature anomalies can be discounted! 
     ----------------------- 
     Max had a problem with a metal screen he soaked in BTF.  Was it 
     stainless (probably not).  Are you sure the medicinal taste isn't 
     metallic?  Sounds like you corroded the metal, than washed it into 
     your beer!  Did you rinse off the BTF after the final dipping, or just 
     run it into your beer?

Greetings all, first off I'm not a chemist nor do I play 
one on TV.  But a brain fart made me remember that an episode 
on 20/20 or 60 minutes highlighted Nitrosoamines as a byproduct of 
barbecuing foods.  ALSO a local Beer historian, Peter Blum (a Strohs/ 
Augsburger brewer and noted historian) mentioned that a scare about 
nitrosoamines dropped consumption of Rauchbier severely several 
years ago in Germany, it was reported that the smoking of the grains 
were introducing the deadly nitrosoamines into the beer itself. 
 
This may or may not be true nor will I debate it, just adding some 
paranoia to the populace!  heh heh heh.....

Hi all.  As I've been looking at some of the recipes posted (and some 
sound pretty tasty) I've been wondering--is there an easy way to convert 
the grain bill for all-grain brews into a comparable extract recipe?  There 
may be a source for it, but I haven't found it yet.  While I'd like to 
jump into all grain, I'd rather wait until I get more space to keep 
the stuff.  Anyway, if anyone out there has information on this, 
I'd appreciate it if they could let me know. 
In a related note, if the grain bill can be converted, does the 
degree of specialty malts remain the same? Or would something else have 
to be done to compensate for with a partial mashing? 
Please respond by private e-mail. 
Thanks again in advance.

I have been attempting what is perhaps impossible: to make a decent extract 
hefe weizen.  Has anyone perfected a recipe they would be willing to share. 
 I am looking for that light colored, finely carbonated, slightly funky 
character that describe some of the classics I've had at various brewpubs. 
 I have played with wheat: barley ratios and yeast strains, but have not 
found a combination that is satisfactory.  What is the best pitching volume, 
fermentation temp?  Is Ireks a decent extract?

Subject: Superior brand dry Lager yeast


Hello HBD'rs, 
 
When I brew lagers, I usually use starters made from liquid yeast which 
produce reasonably active ferments at below 50 degrees. On my last batch 
however I decided to try a dry yeast for a change. The brand was "Superior" 
and is from Australia. 
 
Has anyone had success with this?  I pitched 2 packages (re-hydrated) into 
a batch Sunday and there's been very little activity for 3 days in a 50 deg 
refrigerator.  When I finally placed my carboy in a room temperature 
environment the yeast appears to be waking up. 
 
Can anyone recommend a dry Lager yeast, or is a starter from liquid yeast 
the only way to go?  Sometimes the urge to brew comes up and there is no 
starter ready.

I designed the Fermentation Chiller for 12 VDC for several reasons.  A 12-V 
fan will provide as good of results as a 120-V fan.  120-V thermostats are 
less common (at least in home stores) and a LOW VOLTAGE THERMOSTAT SHOULD 
NEVER BE USED WITH 120 VOLTS!  It's possible that the layout of the 
conductors inside the thermostat could produce arcing, or that the wiring 
won't handle the load.  From a safety perspective, messing with 120 volts is 
dangerous unless (and sometimes even if) you know what you're doing. 
 
As far as heating goes, it's *feasible*, but remember that the unit is 
constructed from plastic foam.  Should your heating element "stick on" for 
some reason, a meltdown or fire could conceivably occur.  Also, many of the 
same concerns above still apply.

Subject: Questions: What to do with cold break/ use of whole hops


 
Two questions from an AR all-grain newbie for the all-knowing collective. 
 
1.  I have a huge amount of cold break in my primary after cooling through a 
counter-flow chiller.   What is its effect on the beer, and would it be 
worth the trouble of letting it settle and then racking off the sediment 
into another fermenter?  Is a little cold break desirable for yeast growth? 
 
2.  My boiler is a converted keg with a basic manifold running out to a SS 
ball valve.  I use whole hops in the boiler.  When I drain the boiler, the 
hops do a nice job of filtering hot break, gunk, and any stray insects that 
managed to fall in while boiling on the back porch.  I am wondering if I am 
leaving a lot of fermentables behind in this primordial ooze.  Should one 
try to "sparge" these hops to get a couple more points, or will you just 
flush all of the nasties back into your wort? 
 
Thanks in advance for any advice, postings or private e-mails!

<Fellow Homebrewers, 
 
< What is the best way to reuse yeast? I have heard that you just 
<take the yeastly sludge at the bottom of the carboy (after racking from 
<primary to secondary), put it in a sanitized jar, cover the jar (but not

In response to Daniel's query: 
 
First get a degree in microbiology (just kidding, but I do have one). 
 
I have been re-using most of my yeasts for several years now.  I've 
heard reports from friends that you can get away with it for four 
or five passages.  More than that they tell me the yeast may mutate.  Who can 
say for sure without doing the molecular biology. 
 
What I usually do is bottle two or more 12oz sizes of slurries from the 
bottom of my fermentor and fill them about 1/2 full, then crown cap. 
I do not add any additional sugar or DME unless I plan to 
freeze for longer term storage.  You do not want to built up a lot 
of carbonation (unless you want to wear it later). I have stored some of these 
in a refrig. for over a year with no apparent problems. While still cold,
vent the pressure off slowly (this varies) and gently swirl to resuspend. 
 
I reconstitute by making up between 2-4pts of 15% DME (boiled/cooled) as a 
starter and pitch into that first.  Some strains take off right away and 
some take a couple of days to "wake up". I have a microscope so I can visually 
inspect and count the little guys with a counting chamber.  I also use a vital 
stain to do a dye exclusion test for viability (trypan blue is excluded by 
living cells). 
 
To freeze yeast I use sterile plastic screw topped 15 or 50ml polyethylene 
centrifuge tubes and add 15% boiled/cooled sugar or DME in water to an 
equal volume of slurry.  This provides some degree of cryoprotection. 
I store these in my freezer.  A deep freezer at -80C is better if you have 
access to one. 
 
70% ethanol make a good sterilant for soaking most small instruments 
and rinsing out bottles.  I also flame sterilize the mouths of the bottles 
before and after filling (habit).  A quick pass over a propane torch flame 
achieves this. 
 
Just my two cents worth.  Good Luck.
