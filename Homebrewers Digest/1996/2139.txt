     I hate to fill the digest with recipe requests, however, since I have 
     just remodelled my house, I can find none of my sources for recipes. 
     All this talk about Scotch Ales has gotten me interested in brewing 
     one.  Does anyone have a favorite all-grain Scotch Ale they would mind 
     sending to me.

Ideally, you would purge out any air that got in with CO2 and then 
heat-seal the nifty foil bags.  You can buy "economy" heat sealers 
for under $30 at some stores.  Barring that, glass jars with good 
seals would be my second choice, again, replacing the air in the 
headspace with CO2 (or nitrogen if you've got that handy). 
 
Garden variety ziplock sandwich (or even freezer) bags are made from 
polyethylene which is notorious for being oxgyen permiable.  I think 
you would be better off folding over the corner of the foil bag a 
couple of times and holding it shut with a couple of paper clips than 
storing the hops in polyethylene bags. 
 
If purged with CO2 or N2 and stored in an oxygen-barrier container in 
a freezer, they hops would pretty much last indefinitely.  I've used 
three-year-old hops packaged in CO2-purged, oxygen-barrier bags and kept 
at only 40F and the hops smelled as fresh as the day I got them and 
resulted in a beer with the expected bitterness. 
 
*** 
Larry laments about an "aftertaste that is too malty or vanilla like." 
 
Could this be diacetyl (i.e. buttery or butterscotch)?  If you suspect 
that it may be, then perhaps a different yeast would help.  The Wyeast 
#1084 (Irish) is notorious for being a strong producer of diacetyl. 
Other things will increase the amount of diacetyl that reaches your 
glass.  The two primary ones are: 
 
1. oxygen *during* fermentation, and 
2. separating the beer from the yeast too early. 
 
If you are racking to a secondary, try to avoid any aeration.  I, personally, 
don't use a secondary for 90% of my beers.  Use a big starter, aerate or 
oxygenate the wort well after cooling and let it ferment in the primary for 
two weeks.  That will eliminate the aeration that may have been occurring 
during your transfer and will give the yeast more opportunity to reduce 
the diacetyl they create.

I would use a solid state relay to switch the 120V line from the 12V 
output of the thermostat. I know what I am doing with 120 volts, and 
plan on installing a GFCI breaker in the box as an extra precaution

For a heater, I planned on using either one of those cermanic jammies 
(with it's own heat controls) or simply a french fry lamp. For these 
reasons I need 120V. I also plan on lining the ice/heat chamber with 
aluminum backed fiberglass insulation to make it more fire resistant.

The last time I was in Home Depot I saw several Hunter thermostats. One item 
they had was called Winter Watchman (or something) that plugged into a 120V 
line and then had an outlet for you to plug a lamp into. The idea was that 
if you were on vacation you could plug a lamp into this thing. If the temp 
in the house dropped below the set point, the lamp would come on (which a 
watching neighbor could then see and come to your aid). It said on the 
package not to plug anything rated above 100 watts into it. This seems 
limiting.

you don't mention recirculating the mash liquor until it clarifies.  this is 
a technique that can help your beer.  letting the mash liquor into the 
kettle before clarifying results in a far cloudier wort, more hot break, 
and probably some other clarity/fermentation problems (cue for other more 
knowledgable brewers to jump in).  running it out quickly is not a good 
idea if you want clarified wort. 
 
> and then slowly

for a 5 gallon batch 30 minutes is not a slow sparge, in my experience. i 
think maybe you should try sparging even slower.

i once didn't mash out a beer that i infusion mashed in my lauter tun.  i 
experienced some sparging difficulties with my false bottom, and the 
recirculation and sparging process took a very long time.  what i ended 
up with was outstanding extraction and thin beer.  it started at about 
1.050 and ended at around 1.008, and it was a dark ale.  so i think 
assuming that enzyme activity is surely over after 3 or 4 hours might be 
a mistake.  i'm not an enzyme expert.  enzyme experts, pour forth your 
knowledge.

the keys for hop preservation are keep them cold and keep them away from 
oxygen.  i have heard that ziploc bags are not airtight.  is the bag you 
bought them in made from airtight material?  if so, fold it over and tape 
it shut and stick them in your freezer.  otherwise, just do the best you 
can, but i definitely recommend freezing them.  they will last a very 
long time if you can keep them away from oxygen and keep them cold.  i've 
brewed with german hallertau hops that were 2 years old, but vacuum sealed 
and kept very cold, and the beer was outstanding.

I think it's mainly the residual sugars, which in many beers is probably 
higher than you might think. Ethanol is also perceived to be sweet by most 
people, and certain small peptides taste sweet as well.

Subject: Bottles in the oven/ Saccharomyces deblrueckii


Steve Ensley asks about putting bottles in the oven as a method of 
sterilization/sanitation. 
 
A number of times, I have covered my thoroughly rinsed and dried bottles 
with tin foil hats and put them in the oven.  I noticed no detectable 
problems with infection and it was less labor intensive.  I left them in 
the oven for about 3 hours at 350-400 degrees F, turned off the oven to 
let them cool down, and then used caps which I had soaked in a bleach 
solution. 
 
However, I had a problem with this method, so I returned to bleach 
treatment.  My bottles seemed to develop a white film following oven 
treatment.  This film was removed after a prolonged soaking in a high 
concentration bleach solution.  Does anyone know what this film is and 
what causes it? 
 
..................................................................... 
 
On another topic, I was wondering if any yeast geeks out there could help 
me with a terminology question. 
 
I have been told that the yeast species Saccharomyces delbrueckii is the 
type typically used for fermenting of Bavarian wheat beers. 
 
Others have claimed that there is no such species as Saccharomyces 
delbrueckii but that there is a species named Lactobacillus delbrueckii 
which is used in fermentation of Berliner Weisse beer. 
 
Which is it? 
 
Also, I have heard that the specific epithet (delbrueckii) comes from a 
turn of the century German scientist named Max Delbrueck.  What is his 
relationship to the German immigrant and Cal Tech Nobel laureate Max 
Delbrueck, who is more of a contemporary?

George, 
I'd like to express an opposing opinion.  I have no problem for using this 
forum for discussing these brewing-*related* topics.  Certainly the GABF, 
ATF and other such stuff is germaine to brewing (home and commercial). 
 Frankly, I get a little tired of the "crabtree effect" and "at what temp 
does alpha amylase get denatured" kind of threads.  I think that there is 
far more bandwidth wasted (ain't even close, IMHO) on supposed "brewing" 
issues than these non-brewing issues.  These related posts sometimes provide 
an interesting diversion to the digest.  Feel free to keep sending emails. 
 You can save yourself the trouble of sending one to me, though.

Logically and technically, I agree with Keith, but in practice, I have 
to disagree.  As I privately told Ian, I have always sparged for about 
1/2 hour with outflow valve wide open.  Decided to try slowing it down 
and doubled the sparge time without any *detectable* increase in 
yield.  The one possiblity that makes the difference undetectable is 
my batch sparging technique.  It might make a difference it I kept an 
inch of water above the grain.  But heck, I would rather add 70 cents 
worth of grain and cut off an hour of brewing time and who cares about 
my efficiency.  The only criteria I adhere to with regards to 
efficiency is that it is predictable enough that I can formulate any 
recipe and come out with actual OG within 2 pts. of what I targeted 
and I do this every time.

Subject: Sterilants/Fusels


Al and Dave are back at it: 
 
<Facts are that acidic sulfites in the region below 3 are excellent sterilants.
 
Dave, you are falling back into the terminology ditch.  Sterile != Sanitize. 
It may in fact be a good sanitizer but its certainly not a sterilizer nor 
could one call it excellent.  Id also be wary of citing 1912 references 
(just think how far measurement technology has come!). 
 
As for the issue of casks and diffusion of ethanol/fusels: 
 
In whiskey maturation one of the key reactions involves diffusion of 
products from within the cask, through the cask wall.  Basically its 
called a subtractive reaction in this case.  The key parameters that 
pass through the cask are water and ethanol.  The lower the molecular 
weight of the compound the easier it is to evaporate through the cask. 
This means that it is much easier to reduce the concentration of ethanol 
in a cask than it is to reduce fusel alcohols, as the latter are longer 
carbon chained alcohols.  This route is also the main factor in DMS 
reduction in whiskeys.  Hasuo and Yoshizawa, '86, found that the rate 
of evaporation of a model whiskey ranged from 32% of the total present 
in the spirit for acetylaldehyde to 5% for isoamyl alcohols to 1% for 
ethyl hexanoate and acetic acid.  So the permeability per compound is 
quite different.  The texts seem to indicate that in whiskey maturation 
there is a net concentration of fusel alcohols and esters of fatty acids. 
Similar results apply to cognac production where Ive seen a reference 
that indicates a typical loss of 3% per year in both water and ethanol 
and a concentration of fusel alcohols. 
 
The chemistry of spirit maturation in casks is quite involved and 
interesting.  The key reactions are extractions from the cask, chemical 
reactions and oxidative reactions inside the vessal (which continue as 
the flavanols, tannins, hemicelloses and lignins leach) and concentration 
reactions.  How much of this is applicable to concentrations found in 
beer is yet another story.

Basically, just get it up to the boiling point or so.  If you're worried 
about weird mold spores or something, a little higher will do fine. 
You don't need to hold the temp there for any significant amount of time, 
but until you get a lot hotter, it's not a big problem doing so. 
 
I find an over thermometer handy for this.

Yes.  Let them cool down overnight, slowly, in the stove.  If you take 
them out and let them cool quickly in the air, and then fill them right 
there, you risk weakening the bottles and eventually breaking them.

I use the following method which is fairly close to what you describe. 
I can't take credit for it though.  Russ Pencin hipped me to it in an 
old 
HBD post. 
1. Mash normally. 
2. Grind specilities fine (in the blender)and steap about 45-60m in 
170df water. 
3. Do a mashout at 170 and add the steaped grain mush to the mash. 
4. After a 10m mash out drain all the mash liquor after recirculate 
5. Add all your mash water and stir for 5 or 10minutes.  rest 10 
minutes. 
6. Recirculate then drain all the mash liquor. 
  (drain doesn't mean open the valve wide open. 
  I usually take about 15 minutes to drain the whole thing. 
 
This isn't the most efficent method but it sure is easy and quick.

The only thing that i would add is to leave the oven closed after the 
final 
temp rise.  Let the bottles cool down slowly with the oven.

Subject: Slow Starting Wyeast


Brian Kuhl asked in #2137 why his Wyeast #1338 seemed to be starting so 
slowly. 
 
Maybe this is way simple, but read the date crimped into the seal at the 
bottom of the pack.  You'll learn something about your supplier's turnover 
and the relative popularity of different yeast strains, as well as avoid the 
problem of "wort's ready, starter isn't". 
 
For ale strains, I allow 1 day per month since the crimp date for the pack to 
swell, plus an additional day for a 1 pint starter to get ripping.  For lager 
strains, which seem to me to start slower, I allow 1-1/2 days a month, plus a 
day for the starter.  Works for me. 
 
By the way, I try to time my starter so that when I'm done chilling the boil, 
my 1 pint starter is ready.  I then rack to my primary, plus a quart into a 
half gallon growler, into which I pitch the 1 pint starter.  The primary 
(actually a 5.25 gal. "secondary" carboy) goes in the fridge overnight; I 
return it to room temp the next morning, then rack off the massive break & 
trub deposit into my real primary, and pitch my 1 - 1.5 quart starter which 
is invariably roaring by then. 
 
Why go to the trouble?  My ferments start within 8 hours for ales and 16 - 24 
hours for lagers, and I feel my beers are cleaner for having removed more of 
the break material. 
 
The downside is more planning ahead.

Again we need to use the correct terminology. From Block "Sterilization is the 
act or process, physical or chemical, that destroys or eliminates ALL FORMS OF 
LIFE, especially microorganisms." (my emphasis) 
 
So now let me use a math example.  It is not uncommon to find 1,000,000 
microorganisms per milliliter in a rich media like wort or must.  Thus there 
are still 1000 microorganisms/ml if only 99.9% are killed.  This does not fit 
the definition of a sterilant.  You would have to have 0 (ZERO) live 
microorganisms for it to be sterile. 
 
A few more definitions: 
 
Sanitizer is an agent that reduces the number of bacterial contaminants to safe
levels as judge by public health reqirements.  From the AOAC manual, a 
sanitizer is a chemical that kills 99.999% of the specific test bacteria in 30 
seconds under the conditions of the test. 
 
Sulfites thus do not fit the definiton of a sanitizer either. 
 
Disinfectants are defined as agents that destroy disease or other harmful 
microorganisms but may not kill bacterial spores. 
 
To a large extent these terms are defined by various tests under defined 
conditions. But IMHO it is important to use correct terminology so that we are 
not describing things incorrectly.

You dont' want to tie up equipment for 6 months, well you really need to wait 
1-2 years.  Check the lambic  digest archives.  Make a blackberry wheat beer 
and add 1000 ppm acetic and 3000-5000 ppm actic acid and you will be done.

Even if Webster did, I wouldn't.  Have you ever made a 2-liter starter from 
a plate?  Basically, you are making the starter from a single cell. 
 
What might the wild yeast and bacterial cell counts be in a pound of grapes? 
A million?  (I'll bet there may be a million on a single grape!).  Even if 
you killed 99.9% of them, you could still have nearly 1000 live cells. 
Far from sterile, Dave... 
 
I have not even addressed the issue of spores... they are not "active cells."

Keith is correct in saying faster != better when it comes to sparging. 
Here's another picture of what's going on in the sparging process.  Think 
of the sparge water as being a continuous series of horizontal layers of 
water traveling down through the grain bed.  The amount of sugar that 
each layer of water can pull out of the grain is proportional to the time 
it is in contact with the grain.  So, slower sparging means more contact 
time, which means better extraction efficiency. 
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
 
In the same HBD (#2138) Jurie Dekter <juried`at`ozemail.com.au> posed the ques- 
tion:

This is a good question.  Let me take a stab at answering it.  The sugar in 
the grain will only leach out into the surrounding liquid if the concentration 
of sugar is greater in the grain than it is in the liquid.  If you add all of 
your sparge water at once, the concentration of sugar in the liquid will in- 
crease and the concentration of sugar in the grain will decrease until the 
concentrations are equal.  The problem is that there will still be a lot of 
sugar in the grain at this equilibrium point.  A quick rinse of the grains 
(after you drain the sparge water off) will simply not pull enough additional 
sugar out to make this an efficient technique. 
 
The conventional (i.e. gradual) sparge is very efficient because liquid that 
is high in sugar content is constantly being removed from the grain, and 
"virgin" sparge water is constantly being added.

In fact, it will probably work a lot *better*. I was looking at fan specs the 
other day, and it seems like the 120VAC units require a lot more power (in 
terms of wattage) than the 12VDC ones, for the same airflow. So the motor in a 
120VAC fan will dissipate a lot more heat, causing your ice to melt faster.

Here's a thought: How about using a resistor as a low-voltage heating element? 
You could just wire it in parallel with the fan. A 50 ohm resistor `at` 12VDC 
would dissipate something like 3 watts, which may be enough to heat a small, 
confined space. Just make sure you use a resistor with a high enough power 
dissipation rating (e.g. 5 watts, to give yourself some leeway), and mount it 
such that it cannot come into contact with the foam. If you have trouble 
finding a 50 ohm, 5 watt resistor, you could even wire 10 500 ohm, 1/2 watt 
resistors in parallel to achieve the same effect. Even if it "sticks on", I 
don't think enough heat would be developed to be a danger (might ruin the 
beer, though). 
 
I haven't actually tried the above technique yet, but I plan to...

Brown and green colouring does not eliminate the need to protect the 
bottles from light.  Due to a process called non-radiative energy 
transfer, visible light of any frequency (not just the green to UV 
range) can skunk the beer.  Brown is better simply because it is 
darker than green which is darker than clear.  Some, but not total, 
protection.  There was a very good article in a recent Zymurgy on 
this.  Appropriately, the issue had a skunk on the cover. 
 
Incidentally, there are PET bottles which claim to have "UV"-blocking 
coatings on them.  Due to non-radiative energy transfer, this is another 
mis-representation... it gives no protection from skunking.  [Thanks 
again to Pierre for explaining NRET to me.] 
 
My concern with PET was with the oxygen transfer.  I could not find PET 
in my plastics tables, only PETG (which has about 10% of the oxygen 
permiability of HDPE (said to be much too oxygen permiable for long-term 
beer storage)).  I don't know the relationship between PET and PETG so 
this is probably inconsiquential data.  I also know they use PET for beer 
in Canada also, but I certainly wouldn't trust it for aging a Barleywine 
for three years!

That's wishful thinking.  My pLambic didn't start to get interesting till 
8 months and wasn't worth entering in a competition for two years.  It 
scored poorly in the 1995 AHA Nationals, but won a 1st place in the 1st 
round of the 1996 AHA Nationals.  This was four years after pitching. 
 
If sourness turns you off, a pLambic is not what you should be seeking 
to brew.  Try pasteurizing the fruit and adding it to the secondary.  Then 
add lactose at bottling time to sweeten it.  Have one periodically to make 
sure some bacteria or super-attenuative yeast didn't slip by your sanitation. 
 
*** 
A number of posters have recently asked about batch sparging (draining 
the lauter tun and then refilling) versus fly sparging (continuous 
addition of sparge water while draining at the same rate.  One even suggested 
adding all the sparge water at the same time.  First let me address the 
last suggestion.  Adding all the sparge water may be possible but only if 
you have a huge lauter tun.  Even if it was possible, it would be the least 
efficient of the three methods.  Because we are working with concentrations 
of sugars which we are trying to extract from the grain bed, theoretically, 
the fly (or continuous) sparging method is the most efficient.  I posted 
a detailed description of why in HBD perhaps three years ago, so I won't 
repeat it here.  I say "theoretically" because if you have a lot of channeling 
in your grain bed, the batch sparging method may be more efficient.  In 
an ideal system, with an ideal grain bed, fly sparging is more efficient. 
Where the break-even point is can be debated and could never be quantified 
anyway, but my intuition says that for most of us the fly sparging method 
will give better results (it takes less time too because you only have 
to establish a grain bed and recirculate once).

I've tried this yeast and although some yeast experts (at Lallemand) say 
that there is not currently any true bottom-fermenting yeast available in 
dry form, if the yeast ferments at 50F and is clean, I'd say it should 
make a lager-like beer.  My results with this yeast have been very promising. 
 
As for your restarting yeast, it could be just that you shocked the yeast 
when you added them to the fermenter -- try coolineg the fermenter down 
slowly back to 50F and see if fermentation doesn't continue.  My guess is 
that it would.
