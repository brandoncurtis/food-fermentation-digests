Subject: Bottle baking is OVERKILL!


HBDers, 
Regarding bottle baking, in my opinion is overkill.  Several months ago I 
explored this very thing on the HBD.  Tried it twice and chucked the practice. 
i think it was Russell Mast who wrote to me that he doesn't do jack to his 
bottles other than rinse them with water. 
 
Since then,(about 400 bottles ago), I haven't  used bleach nor baking.  My 
procedure: 
    1    open beer bottle and empty into a glass 
    2    Immediately (like < 6 hrs.) rinse out bottle 3 times under tap water 
        and air dry upside down on dish rack. 
    3    When dry (like an hr) cover bottle top w/ a square of foil 
    4    Store in bottle case until bottling time. 
 
On bottling day, all I do is take off foil and shoot the Jet Washer in the 
bottle with hot tap water, empty and fill w/ beer. 
 
No bleach, no baking no hassles, no infection. 
 
This of course applies only to bottles in which you know contained recently 
decanted beer.

Subject: fruit beer musings


There is a lot of discussion among this group regarding fruit beers.  I have 
made several of them:  Rasberry, Blackberry, Peach, Strawberry and mixed 
fruit.  I have always used real fruit, usually 5 pounds in a 5 gallon batch. 
I would usually split the fruit:  half in the primary, half in the secondary. 
Fresh fruit is typically frozen to help soften it and hold until ready. 
 
I also understand the conventional logic:  Fruit added to the primary 
loses many of its desirable tastes and smells due to CO2 scrubbing; volatile 
esters that give fruit most of its smell and flavor are blown out with the 
CO2 that is produced by vigerous fermentation.  Fruit added to the secondary 
is not as agressively fermented, and more of the esters remain to provide 
flavor and aroma to the finished beer. 
 
There are some factors that seem to run contrary to this logic however.  I 
have tasted beers where only primary-addition fruit is used, and they have 
plenty of flavor and aroma.  And I have tasted some secondary-addition-only 
beers that DO NOT have the amount of aroma and flavor that you would expect. 
This happened to me last evening when I was kegging a batch of blueberry beer. 
I made a barley-and-wheat based ale, lightly hopped, to which I added 4 pints 
of fresh-frozen blueberries to the secondary.  I allowed the fermentation to 
proceed at 70F for a week and then kegged last eve.  I was totally shocked by 
the taste:  very alcoholic, not much fruit flavor or aroma, and a finishing 
gravity of 1.004!!!  It seems that the yeasties (Wyeast #1056) had used up all 
of the fermentable sugars from the malt, and when the berries were added, they 
went to town on them as well.   (S.G. was about 1.045 if that helps) 
 
What is a brewer to do?  A less attenuative yeast would definitely help (I 
used #1338 for a blackberry porter with great results), but I am beginning to 
rethink the secondary-addition-only methodology after this last batch.  I 
could always use some of the fruit essence extracts at bottling, but there is 
a lot of good fresh fruit available here in central Pennsylvania (especially 
this time of year), and I'd like to utilize some of it.  There are probably 
other ways to deal with it too; add a couple Campden tablets shortlty after 
adding the fruit to stun the yeast; maybe others. 
 
I have a Chocolate Rasberry Stout planned (like one I tasted at T.R.A.S.H. VI 
this year), and I am torn about when to add the berries....suggestions??? 
Fruit beers are very popular these days, and I am curious what the collective 
wisdom of the HBD has to say about this.  Private email is fine, or post 
it...I read the digest every work day - I'll share what I find out if enough 
folks are interested. 
TIA...Cheers!

Subject: Re: Recipes


Don asks why give up good recipes?.. 
 
 
I agree totally, that one of the most fun aspects of homebrewing is 
recipe formulation. 
 
However, while I share a discomfort about giving up recipes which 
are good--i.e. competition winners and friends saying "wow".  I 
think the reality is that NONE of us use exactly similar brewing 
techniques; our efficiencies vary wildly, not to mention hop 
utilization differences depending on freshness of hops, alpha acids, 
etc.  Even the most diligent brewer would have a tough time 
replicating an exact recipe and producing the same beer you have. To 
me, that's one of the cool things about homebrewing.  Hell, I have 
yet to even try to replicate my own recipes!!  I love to tweak 
'em--even the very good ones. 
 
Now, about food recipes...that's a horse of a different color. By 
and large, most U.S. kitchens possess the same kind of equipment and 
cooking techniques are generally very similar. So the possiblity of 
someone duplicating a recipe are pretty good.  Interesting footnote: 
you can't copyright the ingredients for a recipe, but you can 
copyright the procedure and instructions used to create a given 
dish.

Subject: PET bottles/AOB & GABF/Non-brewing topics/Zip City


PET bottles: 
        As polymers go, PET is relatively impermeable to oxygen and CO2. 
Unfortunately, compared to glass, it is REALLY permeable.  Note how old two 
liter bottles of pop lose their fizz.  I have a friend that uses PET 
bottles occasionally for lawnmower type beers that he doesn't plan on 
aging.  It works.  As far as coatings to prevent skunking, just put a 
bottle of Liberty Ale in a sunny window for a couple of hours and see how 
effective brown glass is!  Brown polymer coatings aren't any better. 
 
On the GABF and AOB/AHA/ETC. 
  <cynic mode on>  I've never understood how people are surprised that the 
AOB and associated organizations don't do what "we" want.  After all, I've 
never heard about an election for the AHA presidency, nor any other action 
as a result of grass roots outcry (the BJCP fiasco comes to mind).  The 
people involved have financial interests (as in job security) in the 
continued success of the organization and as the organization grows it 
takes more money to run it.  Do the math!     <cynic mode off> 
 
On non-brewing topics 
        I don't like the POLITICAL statements that some people seem 
obsessed with throwing in, but I have trouble condemning the ATF discussion 
when it was conducted in a civil manner.  Non-beer related threads die on 
their own if they are ignored as they should be.  I will, of course, solve 
all the problems in the world when I'm elected Czar, but until then, we'll 
have to rely on our own restraint in this area. 
 
Zip City Brewpub 
        There's one in Manhattan(NYC, not Kansas) around 55th Ave. I wasn't 
really impressed by their beers, but I had been elsewhere sampling single 
malt Scotch(s) so don't take my lack of endorsement too seriously.

HBDers, 
If one was making a "classic" Bavarian Hefe Weizen with say 60/40 wheat/pale 
mix, would it make any sense to only decoct (boil) the wheat malt alone, w/o 
any
pale?  Since wheat is huskless, wouldn't the wheat by itself eliminate the 
tannin extraction problem? 
 
Also, since I routinely add rice hulls in my weizen and rye beers to aid in 
sparging, would the rice hulls hurt/help/do nothing when mixed into the 
decocted
portion? 
 
Thanks

Greetings braumeisters, 
 
Al says in HBD2139; 
>... I, personally, don't use a secondary for 90% of my beers.< 
 
Al,  reading this comment startled me.  I guess I realized that you could 
make some styles of beer very satisfactorily with only a primary 
fermentation, but what about lagers and diacetyl reduction?  wort 
clarification?  yeast autolysis?  What of other benefits supposedly achieved 
by a secondary fermentation? 
 
In no way do I mean to dispute your statement, but it seems to fly in the 
face of much of the information that I had (perhaps blindly) assumed was 
true.  Is 90% of your beer production  styles that do well with just a 
primary? Are these primarily British and Scottish ales? 
 
My real reason for pursuing this question, is that I have always racked off 
the primary as soon as the krauesen fell, usually only 4 or 5 days, and into 
a secondary fermenter for whatever additional length of time -2 weeks to 6 
months.  Eliminating a needless step would seem to be very advantageous if 
indeed it is really unneccessary. 
 
Thanks in advance for some elaboration on this.

This tweaked my curiosity.  I routinely mash twelve pounds in a 10 gallon 
Gott cooler for five gallon batches ( actually ~ 6 Gals. ).  I use 1.1 quarts 
per pound of grist and a copper manifold with no false bottom.  While it 
would be a stretch, I could double this mash and still fit it in the Gott. 
Dion, do you use a false bottom?  How much strike water per pound?

Keep in mind that the purpose of the mash out is not exclusivley to end 
conversion.  Mashing out also loosens fermentable sugars (ever melted sugar 
on the stove?) so that when the sparge begins, sugars are rinsed from the 
grains and filter through the bed and into the kettle... CDR

Subject: Cherry Porter


Hi Jan: 
 
I too am in the htroes of making a cherry porter.  I just got to the grocery 
store in time before the cherries went off the shelf!  Here's what I plan to 
do: 
 
1)  Use Bing cherries.  Tart pie cherries and white cherries reportedly don't 
come out near as well.  About 1 - 1.5 lb/gal is a good place to start; I'm 
going to use 1.2 lb/gal (6 lb for 5 gal). 
 
2)  Add cherries to the secondary, or after much of the primary fermentation 
is done.  The CO2 bubbles can "scrub" out lots of aroma, which is what you're 
tasting (as opposed to "flavor"). 
 
3)  Destem the cherries, place them in as many large ziplocs as you need, 
suck out as much air as possible, and freeze.  When ready to add tothe 
secondary, place the bags in ~160F water for 15 - 30 minutes to sanitize. 
 Allow to cool.  Some people talk of adding pectin enzyme at about 100F or 
lower to aid clarity, but this may not be an issue with a porter.  When at 
room temp, smash the fruit while still in the bags and then open the bags and 
dump.  The freezing reportedly allows more juice to come out, plus it makes 
the fruit mushy so it's easier to squish. 
 
4)  Be sure you have lots of headroom in the fermenter for the renewed 
fermentation that will ensue.  Also, when you rack to bottle / keg, use some 
sort of filter on the racking cane to strin fruit chunks.  I use a hop bag 
secured on to the end on the cane, along with the little cap thingy. 
 
5)  Chances are you'll have to age it for MONTHS to allow everything to blend 
and mellow. 
 
Below I've copied an old post of mine which I submitted tot he HBD back in 
January (and which I recently rediscovered while reviewing back-issues for 
fruit advice).  It includes the recipe and procedure for a wonderful cherry 
porter I tried at the time.

Subject: Fruit in Beer 
 
While I have not (yet) made a fruit beer, I recently tasted a phenomenal 
cherry porter which I would like to try my own hand at.  The fruit part was 
accomplished by first blanching (dipping briefly in boiling water) the 
destemmed fresh cherries so as to kill any wild yeast and other bugs.   The 
cherries were then placed in a ziploc bag and frozen.  The porter was made 
and fermented about half way (with respect to gravity); the cherries were 
then thawed and crushed in the bag, then dumped into the fermenter, skins and 
all. 
 
The brewer had sampled the brew every month for the first four months and was 
disappointed; when I tried it it was six months old and the brewer was amazed 
at the maturation that occurred in those two months.  Time is important! 
 
The 5-gal recipe was a pretty generic porter (1 lb crystal, 1/2 lb chocolate, 
pale fermentables to taste [about 1.050 OG if I remember right], very lightly 
hopped) with 6 lbs fresh cherries prepared as described.  The balance between 
the porter and the cherry flavors was *perfect*.

You specified (in a part of you article that I deleted...d'oh!) 
that you were brewing a porter.  This may be my own prejudice 
speaking, but "porter" suggests a high-OG wort. 
 
In my experience, the amount of krauesen generated during primary 
fermentation is proportional to the OG of the wort.  I never used 
(or needed to) a blow-off hose with bitter, whilst a blow-off was 
almost invariably needed to prevent an industrial-sized mess with 
stouts (difference in OG of about .025, as I recall; I don't know 
where my brewing long has gone to). 
 
I would recommend that, if you decide to brew this beer, or any 
beer with an OG of over about 1.045 (leaving a little margin for 
error), you resort to a blow-off hose....or a tarp to catch the 
overflow. 
 
Of course, if your porter had an OG of 1.035, then I'm way off- 
base here.

It all depends what you're giving away. 
 
True, anyone can develop a "recipe" for beer, just as anyone can 
develop a "recipe" for a chicken dish ("Take 1 lb. of chicken 
parts, 2 lb. of sprouts...").  The real question is (or ought to 
be):  "What will this formulation taste like?". 
 
To answer that question takes a degree of talent seldom found, or a 
degree of experience.  Since experience comes from bad judgment 
(and leads to good judgment), it is understandable than 10,000 
novice homebrewers do not want to reproduce my bad judgment in 
producing a brew that tastes like stale goat urine. 
 
*That*, IMNSHO, is the real value of a recipe.  To assure the 
novice: "Mix these ingredients in these proportions, follow these 
procedures, and you will end up with a product that tastes like 
this."  To the more experienced brewer (or chef, or whatever) a 
recipe is more of an aide memoire:  "I did thus-and-so, and I 
ended up with a product that I really liked (or:  that I was afraid 
to dump, lest my backyard fill up with dead raccoons), so I will 
certainly (not) do it again."

The squid who asks:  "Can someone tell me how to clone Rogue Dead 
Guy Ale?" isn't committing a solecism; he's undertaking a project 
that is almost certainly too complex for him, and that will only 
end in heartbreak.  The brewer who asks:  "I tried your Dead Dog 
Porter and it was fantastic; how do you brew it?" (or even that 
one who says:  "I tried your Dead Dog Porter, and it was vile; how 
do I avoid making the same mistakes?") isn't necessarily committing 
a solecism, either.  If you wish to maintain "trade secrets", do 
so.  If you wish to have everyone in the Western Hemisphere 
drinking Trotter ESB, give away the recipe (or open a microbrewery). 
But, either way, the value in publishing (or formulating) a recipe 
is in the intended end use, not in the act itself.

Kelly Jones complains about the GABF and how much it costs. Indeed! It cost a  
lot of money to put on such a grand affair.  Didn't I hear once that the GABF 
was a money loser for AOB?  I don't know if that's still the case, but the 
anuual financial statements for these non-profit organizations are public

AOB.

Jack Schmidling speculated that Coors may be toying with the idea of actually 
using malt in their beers. Hey Jack who are you to talk, I thought you were the
King of Corn! ;>) 
 
On a serious note, Coors packaging used to list their contents as Barley Malt, 
Hops, Yeast, Rocky Mountain Spring Water and modified cereal starch. Years ago 
while on the Coors brewery tour, I posed the question to the tour guide as to 
why modified cereal starch is used in the formula. The response was "it makes  
it taste better".  (Hmmm) I recently noticed the that this ingredient was 
deleted from the label and replaced with 'rice'. 
 
I'm sure the reason Coors bought the Maltmill (tm) was to investigate and 
resolve once and for all the 'Roller Spacing Differential for a Text Book 
Crush'
debate once and for all!!! 
 
My concern is that will they let us in on their finding?

Subject: Son of Cherry Porter


One important thing I neglected to metion in my previous post about cherry 
porter: 
 
>From what I've gathered (and I think AlK touched on it recently), perception 
of fruit in beer relies heavily on *aroma* and *sweetness*, moreso than fruit 
"flavor".  Since the fruit causes additional fermentation, the alcohol thus 
produced "thins" or "dries" the beer (FG's of around 1.000 or even less are 
not unheard of).  To enhance the fruit character, be sure to brew such that 
you leave a higher-than-normal degree of residual sweetness for the fruit to 
play off of.  Mashing at higher temperature (158F) and/or using ample crystal 
and other non-fermentable dextrinous malts and adjuncts will help accomplish 
this.

In HBD #2140, Don Trotter asked, "How many of us give up our recipes?" 
 
In my experience, a steady 10 years, almost everyone will give out a 
recipe if asked. I cannot remember ever asking for a recipe and being 
refused. I've had a micro brewer or two only agree to give me percent- 
ages of ingredients- but no flat refusals. In the same vein, I've 
never refused to give out a recipe. 
 
Don expressed worry that if someone got his prize winning recipes, they 
would beat him in the next competition. Not much faith in your brewing 
skills, Don! Maybe you are the one who needs to "Relax........" Home- 
brewing is not about competition, however much some (including me) enjoy 
that aspect of it. IMHO, this whole thing is about making good beer 
with your own hands, making good friends who do the same and all of us 
helping the other guy to make good beer. If all it takes is to give 
out your "secret formula", that's not much to be part of the most en- 
joyable hobby I've come across. Lighten up and learn to share, Don, I 
assure you it will come back in kind. 
 
Damn, I'm glad I waited a day to send this, I was really PO'd by Don's 
post, when I read it yesterday and the post I wrote then was very 
profane.

How can I keep it ( my brewing refrigerator) from condensating and

I have a similar old style refrigerator (Frigedaire by General Motors - 
a classic!) that drips when I have the temperature above 35F. I simply 
place a 1" x 8" x 13" pan directly under the small freezer unit, catch 
the drippage, and empty it occasionally. I don't let my friends look in 
it! 
 
I have always assumed that these refrigerators were not meant to be 
running at beer brewing/serving temps and it was these higher temps that 
caused the drips.

Hello Friends- 
 
I'm think about buying a malt mill and bulk grains.  Does anyone have any

Also, if you have a good source for enexpensive bulk grains, please drop me

Subject: Diacetyl and Wyeast 1084


Hello All, 
 
In #2139, Al K writes that Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) is notorious for the 
strong production of diacetyl.  This concerns me as I have just finished 
brewing a Stout and a Bitter Ale, both using this yeast.  Is there anything 
I can do to inhibit the formation of excessive diacetyl in these beers.  I 
seem to remember some talk on cold storage after fermentation to minimize 
diacetyl but believe this was related to lagering.  Any ideas ?.  Points on 
aeration during transfers from Al's post noted. 
 
Thanks in advance

Seeing all these questions on 5 liter minikegs has prompted me to come 
up with a list of suggestions. 
 
Prime the mini-kegs individually with 1 (one) TABLESPOON of corn sugar. 
 
Dispense the first beers under natural pressure. DO NOT add CO2 or pump 
the pump until beer quits coming out. 
 
When you do add CO2, only add enough to push the beer out GENTLY. You 
should just barely turn the regulator on. Almost as soon as you hear a 
hiss, STOP turning. 
 
Treat the tapper for what it really is, a fragile piece of plastic. 
Even the metal ones have plastic in crucial areas, plastic bulb holders 
in particular. Try to remove the handle as little as possible on the 
metal bodied ones. 
 
I hope this helps solve a few problems.

Sean, 
 
I think that what you are worried about in the homebrew environment is 
not really mutation but selection.  And I believe that you are correct 
in assuming that the characteristics of almost any yeast will be selected 
by your brews and by your process.  I do however disagree that this selection 
process will be faster in more diverse brewing environments. 
 
By selection this is what I mean.  Any population of yeast will show some 
distribution of characteristics about the mean value.  For example if we 
consider the ability to ferment certain trisaccharides.  Most of the yeast 
in this fictitious population can utilize these sugars at a similar rate. 
A small portion of the yeast population can utilize the trisaccharides at 
a much faster rate and others can hardly utilize them at all.  Such 
variability generally forms a gaussian distribution - the familiar bell 
curve.  Let us also assume that trisaccharides are utilized last by the 
yeast after all of the other simpler sugars are gone. 
 
Given the above, if in your brewing process you use both a primary and 
secondary fermentation then what may occur is that the yeast that cannot 
utilize the trisaccharides will "starve" first, flocculate and cake on the 
bottom of the primary.  When you rack to the secondary you will leave 
these poor trisaccharide utilizers (PTU) behind.  What you have done is 
partitioned your original yeast population into 2 different populations. 
If you now only save the yeast from the secondary over successive 
generations under the same conditions you will raise the mean ability to 
utilize trisaccharides.  If, on the other hand, you only save your yeast 
from the primary you will select for yeast with very poor trisaccharide 
utilization. 
 
Any characteristic that you can imagine can be selected for.  Temp 
tolerance, pH tolerance, respirative ability, flocculation, O2 
utilization, FAN utilization, etc. and etc. and etc.  Very little mutation 
is going on, or rather, no more mutation is going on than before you 
started selecting, but now your yeast is changing faster.  Almost anything 
that you do in your brewing process can exert a selective pressure on your 
yeast.  Do you make starters?  Do you use hops in the starters?  What temp 
do you pitch at?  How much aeration do you do?  Fermentation temperature? 
Do you rouse your yeast?  Do you "drop" it, use a secondary, or refrigerate 
to clear the yeast?  Do you use Irish moss?  Do you wear bell bottoms and 
plaid, or, god forbid, plaid bell bottoms!? 
 
If you save your yeast and maintain your own yeast bank it is very 
important that you save enough of the original stock and in such a way 
that you can go back to it periodically to reset your yeast to the 
"original" characteristics.  This can be difficult with a household 
refrigerator/freezer, and is much easier in a household freezer. 
Dedicated freezers generally do not go through warm defrost cycles and are 
generally much colder than the freezer portion of a refrigerator. 
 
Cheers to all!
