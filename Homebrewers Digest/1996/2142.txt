Subject: High kreusen and Recipe requests


Matthew Sanders writes about an explosive porter fermentation in 
HBD #2140.  I have used a additive called "Foam Control," which 
seems to do a good job at controlling kreusen size, even with 
high pitching rates and active top fermentations.  I bought it at 
HopTech (no connection, just an occasional customer), but I'd 
imagine other homebrew suppliers sell it as well. 
 
In the same HBD, Don Trotter writes

I occasionally judge in competitions, so my interest is in 
improving the quality of the beers entered.  I'm happy to give 
away my prize-winning recipes.  This is especially true when I 
consider the help that I got from other brewers in formulating 
them.  If I take Jim's recipe for an IPA, tweek it and beat him 
in the next competition, how upset should I get if I then pass my 
recipe along to Scott and his beer beats mine out for the blue 
ribbon?  Come to think of it, I published that recipe here as 
well. 
 
YMMV, but I think that improving the general quality of homebrew 
is much more important that winning ribbons.  Anyway, after you 
have more than a couple of dozen ribbons, it gets hard to find a 
place to hang them.

I'm still considering giving it a shot.  At bottling time, the beer 
should be 4-5% alcohol so the threat of bacteria is minimal, but if 
you've taken great pains to brew a quality beer, and you have a 
simple, effective means of sanitizing bottles, why not use it? 
 
That said, I'd still like to hear more from the bottle bakers before I 
feel it's worthwhile.  From what I understand, you slowly heat/bake 
the bottles with Al foil covers for a half-hour or so, and then let 
them cool overnight.  They are then stored with foil until ready to 
bottle, correct?  The foil hats are certainly not a perfect seal, does 
the cooling process create a vacuum?  If not, what's to prevent the 
nasties from taking up residence in your bottles once again? 
 
I'm thinking of making a molasses porter for my next brew.  Anyone 
have any experience/comments (I promise not to use any feedback to 
kick your butt in subsequent competitions).

Subject: Using secondaries


Dear Friends, 
 
Gregg Howard asked about using secondaries and yeast autolysis, 
wondering whether there were benefits to using secondaries besides 
avoiding autolysis, and whether that dread malady had ever been 
experienced in HBDland. 
 
I'll bite. 
 
First, of course, I will answer the second question: Nope.  Never to 
my knowledge has autolysis affected my beers. 
 
Second, to the first question, about benefits of using secondaries. 
I use one for everything.  It is my standard operating procedure, and 
has been since my initial months of experimentation when I first 
started brewing.  My usual batches will spend as long as it takes in 
primary for the gravity to fall to a few points above final gravity 
(e.g. for a 1050 OG beer, when I expect FG to be say 1012, I will 
rack at about 1015) and then from one to three weeks in secondary. 
This is not to say that those brewers, Al Korzonas for example, who 
use mostly primary-only procedures are wrong; it is just that I 
prefer it this way. 
 
My beers typically end up brighter than they did before because 
there are two "cycles" during which "stuff" falls out of the beer; if 
I wish to introduce finings I find it convenient to do so in the 
secondary when there is less stuff to fine out; I also find 
dry-hopping to be simpler in secodary than in a primary encrusted 
with the remnant gunk of primary fermentation.  I feel that these 
issues allow me greater beer recovery-- i.e. I lose less to 
primordial oozes and  such, but acknowledge that we are talking about 
a small amount here. 
 
All of my fermentors are plastic with spigots in the bottoms. 
Draining with gravity is the way I move my beer around, and if I use 
a secondary then there is so much less stuff in the bottom that when 
it comes time to bottle (I know, I know, I should keg, but I do not 
have space in my apt. for that) that what I transfer to the bottling 
bucket is nearly stuff-free.  I have seen it written that the extra 
racking step is one more episode during which infection and 
oxidation are risked, but I believe that these are wholly non-issues. 
Sanitization is so simple... and if one is at all careful then 
introducing oxygen can be kept to a bare minimum. 
 
In short, it works for my setup and the styles I brew.  I think the 
flavors I get are cleaner and the beers clearer than when I was using 
just the one vessel.  The extra effort involved is trivial, and (in 
my case) it keeps more beer in various stages of fermentation than 
would be the case otherwise.

Ziplocks aren't a good idea. They're a poor barrier to O2. My favorite for long
term "bulk" storage is a mason jar. Recycled, cleaned Wyeast pouches and hop 
bags work well since much of the air can be squeezed out and they afford good 
O2 protection. I've used one of those new-fangled vaccuum packaged coffee bags 
with seeming success (6 months so far) for storage of hops in the freezer. Wash
them well and hang outside in in the sun until the coffee smell goes away- took
the one I tried several weeks.

A great local Irish pub (Durty Nellie's) makes a fantastic chilli using Guiness
stout as an ingredient. I've tried to duplicate it by making a 3 qt. batch of 
mild (to let the stout come through) chilli and adding 4 bottles of homebrewed 
stout. Unfortunately, the stout was weak in roasted barley and a bit sweet, the
chilli didn't duplicate the "real" stuff but it was still very good. "Real" 
stout or perhaps steeping roasted barley in the chilli would help. Stout fried 
rice and beef and barley soup made with stout sounds tasty. Anyone tried these?

George_De_Piro`at`berlex.com (George De Piro) wonders: 
    >By the way, don't the acetobacters cause a film on the beer's surface? 
Don't know about beers since I've not had a batch infected with them, but they 
usually form a film or thicker "mother-of-vinegar" in homebrewed vinegar. I'm 
no bacterialogist (I can't even spell it <g>), but, acetobacter infection 
shouldn't be a real big worry in decently made homebrew since the little 
buggers require a good deal of O2 to make vinegar.
 
George also requested: 
  >PLEASE STOP USING THIS FORUM FOR NON-BREWING ISSUES.  This IS NOT the

FWIW, I don't mind and usually enjoy short/witty/occasional references along 
these lines that are intelligently incorporated into a brewing post. IMHO, it's
the replies to such posts that distract from the Digest. Like George suggested 
elsewhere in his post, private e-mail is the most effective and courteous way 
to respond if ya think it necessary...

Subject: Directional Suggestions for a La Chouffe recipe


Chastened by earlier posts not to request recipes, I will instead ask for 
directional suggestions for development of a La Chouffe-like beer. 
 
The back label provides generous hints by listing the following ingredients: 
"...Pilsner malt, English Golding & Saaz hop and coriander...".  I've also 
dumped the yeast deposit from the bottle dregs into a 750ml yeast starter 
(OG ~ 1.040). 
 
A couple of questions come to mind -- 1) Is La Chouffe a wit-like beer 
without the lactic acid component?; or 2) Is Jim Busch's Esprit d' Boire 
recipe from Winter 95 Zymurgy a better starting point? 
 
I appreciate any pointers.  I'll summarize all private e-mails to HBD.

Subject: All-Grain Extract Efficiency


 
Yesterday I brewed two 6 gallon batches- my 4th and 5th all-grainers. 
Both were simple infusion mashes at around 153 degrees with mash-out 
at 170 degrees. Batch 4 was mashed and sparged in my 10 gallon Gott 
cooler mash/lauter tun. Batch 5 was mashed in an insulation covered 
kettle then moved to the Gott cooler for the sparge. Mash-out for 
batch 5 was done by direct heating (infusion for Batch 4). 
 
I got a lousy 22 point extraction on batch 4 (similar to batches 1-3). 
 I got a 29+ point extraction on batch 5. 
The 3 major differences with batch 5 that I can think of were: 
1.  Batch 4 was mashed for 90 minutes versus over 2 1/2 hours for 
batch 5. The iodine extraction tests looked similar for the 2 batches. 
 
2.  Batch 4 sparge was begun at 170 degrees, but I noticed that by 
the end of the sparge, the temperature in the uninsulated sparge 
water stockpot had dropped to about 155 degrees. For batch 5, I kept 
adding boiling water to the sparge stockpot to keep the temperature 
around 170 degrees throughout the sparge. 
3.  Batch 4 used British 2-row pale ale, Batch 5 used US 2-row (first 
time I've used it). 
 
In the experience of other HBD'ers which if any or all were 
responsible for the finally decent 29 point extraction? 
Specifically: 
Isn't 90 minutes long enough to mash? 
Should I use an insulated sparge water container? How critical is the 
temperature? 
Can the type of  malt cause that much difference? 
 
Thanks, 
Steve Garrett

Subject: Oxides of nitrogen revisited


 
Below is a personal email that I sent to Andy Walsh concerning oxides 
of nitrogen.  He encouraged me to post it, so here it is (partially 
editted): 
 
*************** 
Andy, 
 
I figured I'd email direct, to avoid the resemblance of a posting 
battle in HBD :) 
 
The term nitrogen oxides is quite broad, and includes numerous compounds 
of the general form  NxOy, where x and y could be of a large set of 
possible compounds of nitrogen & oxygen.  An incomplete list is as 
follows (there are others too): 
 
NO      bad  * nitric oxide 
NO2     bad nitrogen dioxide 
N2O     safe    (nitrous oxide - a.k.a. laughing gas) 
N2O3    bad nitrogen trioxide 
N2O4    bad nitrogen tetroxide 
N2O5    bad nitrogen pentoxide 
 
* Used in the body to cause vasodialation, as a naturally occuring 
  substance, as well as in the immune system to kill invading cells. 
  This was only recently discovered - in maybe the last 8-15 years. 
  It is considered a NASTY toxic gas, and was a surprise to find that 
  it does exist in the human body!  It is still a NASTY TOXIC gas! 
 
The nitrogen oxide that is known to form nitrosamines, is N2O3. 
N2O3 + H2O -> 2HONO (nitrous acid).  This stuff reacts with some 
types of amines and proteins to form nitrosamines.  This nitrous acid 
is formed in when sodium nitrite (NOT nitrate) reacts with acids, such 
as is in your stomach.  This is why people are concerned about nitrites 
used in preserving meats (there is a huge amount of evidence on either 
side of this battle, due to the complexity of the various proteins and 
amino acids found in the stomach that it reacts with...). 
 
Some of these compounds can react with water, oxygen, or other things, 
to ultimately become another oxide of nitrogen, or acid thereof. 
 
Of these oxides, nitrous oxide (N2O) is the safest, and most inert at 
room temperatures.  All other oxides are TOXIC, but N2O is rather 
safe.  It is the only oxide of nitrogen that does NOT react with water 
to form an acid.  If it were prone to produce nitrosamines, I would 
doubt that it would continue to be used to make whipping cream (which 
has soluble proteins to some degree).  Secondly, if it was prone to form 
such carcinogens with proteins,  medical science would have pulled 
N2O from use as a casual anesthetic in dentistry, because it might 
react with the multitude of proteins in the human body.  However, the 
last time I visited a dentist, he was still administering N2O.  At 
least that is the case here in the US.  Maybe your country did ban 
it...? 
 
You are right in questioning "nitrogen oxides" in beer, because nearly 
all but N2O are dangerous.  However, N2O is the only safe and stable 
oxide of nitrogen at room & body temperatures.  N2O which is packaged 
for food use (i.e. whippets) is probably free from the other nastier 
oxides of nitrogen. 
 
I know I once reacted with over zealous concern to someone's question 
whether is was safe to use glycerol to freeze yeast.  I was basing my 
concern on the fact that at high doses, glycerol is used to induce 
renal failure in laboratory experiments with the kidney.  So I 
warned the person that I thought it was unwise to consume beer with 
glycerol in it.  I guess I over reacted on that one too :) 
 
Take care!

 The Johnson Controls unit is the one most commonly used in keg coolers. 
It is commercial-grade, and I think a much better piece of equipment than 
the Hunter Airstat.  Many homebrew suppliers sell these temp controllers in 
the $60 range, so $32 sounds like a bargain, but as I understand it, you 
have to add your own power cord (couple of bucks, or free if you rob it off 
junk, plus wiring up three wires).  William's Brewing, who sells a Johnson 
controller, says it has a 30' to 80'F range with a 3 1/2'F differential, 
meaning a controler set at 65' will cool to 61 1/2', shut off, and wait 
until 65' to cycle the compressor.  It will drive a 15 amp cooler and has a 
6 foot capillary probe.  Please e-mail the address of your supplier, or 
better yet post it for everybody's benefit.  Please note that I've never 
used one of these units, and the favorable review I've given it is gleaned 
from past information.  I've never heard anything bad about it.  OK, 
OK...it doesn't have a clock on it like my Airstat.  Happy?

First, thanks to all who responded to my fruit beers question. I think 
we really beat the fruit beers to death, I'm glad, I learned a lot. 
Anyway, I have a question about racking and filtering now. First of all 
is it possible to do a third racking to help clear my brew? I know most 
do a two stage (primary and secondary) and people have suggested 3 
rackings for some fruit beers. Does this aid in clarity or is it a 
waste of time in typical ales. Also, any feedback on when to filter or 
ways to make your own filtering setup would be appreciated.

No, John, you're right.  The OG was about 1.062.  I've mostly brewed 
bitters with OG's of about 1.040 or so, but I have brewed several porters 
and stouts with high OG's.  This is the first that I've had such a violent 
fermentation. 
 
Thanks to all for private and public replies.  Folks have recomended and 
suggested everything from: 
 
1)  Using a smaller starter.  (I've built up to large starters to reduce 
lag time and I think I'm going to continue this practice) 
 
2)  "I dunno, but the same thing happens to me...." 
 
3)  It was suggested that I brew in the bathtub when I make high gravity beer. 
 
4)  Or in a washtub.  Apparently plastic ones are available in KMart for 
about $5. 
 
Thanks again for the advice.

        Yes, I have one and I like it.  It is fairly robust, and the 
resolution on the analog dial is about 1 degree F.   The range, 
I seem to remember, is about 20 F to 80 F.   The accuracy is about 
plus-or-minus 2 degrees F (I checked it against a mercury 
thermometer.)   It's very easy to install---you just stick the probe 
in the fridge and close the door on the wire connecting the probe 
to the controller.   You plug the controller into an electrical 
outlet, and then piggyback/plug the refrigerator (or what-have-you) 
into the controller.   It's easy. 
 
                        Hope this helps,

Another data point - I recently made a Scotch ale in a 10 
gal Gott with 28 lbs of grain and 6 gal water (just under 
1 qt/lb), which left about a gallon of room. My tun has 
about 1 qt of volume below the false bottom.

Nokonmyrear, you bring a broad smile to my face every time you post. All 
homebrewers I ever knew had great senses of humour. All would look, laugh 
and have another homebrew. You keep us from getting too serious. Keep it

Subject: 50 gallon Gott-like cooler?


HBDers, 
While walking into my local Home Depot, I stopped by the outside hotdog vendor 
near the entrance. He's got 3 huge (like 50 gals.) red plastic cans filled with
ice and glass soda bottles.  It appeared to be made just like the Gott with 
double wall thickness.  Didn't see a lid though. 
 
Does anyone know anything about these monsters?

I won't apologize for not fitting your Mr. Nice Guy attitude.  I will, 
however, respond to your understanding of what I have said.  Sharing 
knowledge is the basis of this digest.  That I have done and will 
continue to do.  I generally respond personally.  I have shared 
recipes, but have not heard back from any of the recipients.  This 
suggests, to me, that they are somewhat ungrateful.  They could at 
least let others know how they liked the beer, or at least offer some 
criticism as to make the beer better.  It's not being "selfish and 
stingy", AND IF YOU DONT MIND, KEEP YOUR SILLY CHILDISH LABELS TO 
YOURSELF.

Subject: Trub VIII


 
 
The TRUB VIII OPEN BJCP-registered homebrew competition is coming.... 
September 28, 1996, to the Carolina Brewery in Chapel Hill, NC. 
 
Once again the TRiangle Unabashed homeBrewers will host our Fall homebrew 
competition.  This year, we have a new site, lots of new sponsors to help 
us provide cool prizes, and a special new addition:  The "Brew with Style, 
not to Style, just plain good beer!" category. 
 
A trophy and a $50 gift certificate from Brewbetter Supply in 
Morrisville will be awarded to BOS, with a $25 gift certificate from 
Brew Works of Apex going to the BOS runner up.  In what has become a 
long-standing TRUB tradition, we will, for the fourth year running, be 
awarding a full case of beer (or the equivalent- no beer will be 
shipped) donated by our sponsors to the first place 
winner in each category.  Other cool prizes will go to second and third 
place winners in each category, as well as the usual ribbons. 
 
An entry consists of two bottles with entry form and fees.  Entry fees 
are $5 each for the first two beers, $4 for the third beer and each beer 
thereafter from the same brewer. No cider or sake will be judged.  TRUB 
VIII will be using a set of style guidelines modeled on the AHA and New 
England homebrew guidelines with some improvements.  Entry 
deadline is Tuesday, September 24. 
 
"The Brew with Style, not to Style, just plain good beer" Trophy:  This 
category is for the beer that tastes great but doesn't quite fit into any 
recognizable style.  Beers entered in this category will be mass-judged 
by the remaining judges during the Best of Show round and will be 
selected by acclamation.  No scoresheets will be filled out, but the 
winner will take home a special trophy, in addition to the envy of 
his/her peers.  Only one entry allowed per brewer.  Three (3) bottles per 
entry. Entry fee is $3.00.  All other entry specifics (labels, deadlines, 
etc.) are the same as for other entries. 
 
To get more information, you can find the complete entry form and style 
guidelines on our WWW page at: alpha.rollanet.org/~trub/TRUB.html 
 
Or you can contact Craig Pepin (ckp`at`acpub.duke.edu or 919-286-7125) for 
an entry form via snail-mail 
 
Interested judges should contact Bryan Cronk (cronks`at`nando.net or 919- 
528-3375) 
 
Hope to see y'all there! Or at least your beers.

Hello; 
I am writing to complain about all the people complaining in the HBD. People 
whining
about how hard it is to read, what people write Blah, Blah Blah. If people

  OFFICE MEMO          Recipes, Chocolate, etc.               Date:8/12/96 
RECIPES:    I can respect Don's feelings about not wanting to give up an 
award winning recipe, but I agree that most people aren't asking for that 
when they ask about recipes.   Many people would gladly give up their award 
winning recipes anyway.  I think many of us, especially those of us new to 
homebrewing, would love just to be referred to a recipe on the Cat's Meow 
that someone has tried and can comment on.  I have asked about recipes 
similar to a McEwan's Scotch Ale but didn't get much response--none on the 
Cat's Meow, I'm sure that particular butterscotch flavor is hard to get but I 
think I'll just try experimenting with something eventually and use Wyeast 
1084 next time instead of the Wyeast Scottish Ale yeast based on what I've 
seen in the HBD. 
CHOCOLATE:   As for Kevin's request for Chocolate recipes:  I did two extract 
chocolate beers recently substituting about 0.9# of light extract syrup for 
every pound of pale or similar malt in a partial mash recipe--Chocolate Stout 
from the Cat's Meow and Papazian's Slanting Annie's Chocolate Porter.  Be 
sure to increase the bittering hops a little since the concentrated extract 
boil (2 gal) yields less bitterness than a full boil (5 gal).  I could really 
taste the chocolate in the Porter (12oz choc/5 gallons) at the beginning of 
fermentation but not so at bottling time.  Also, I couldn't taste or smell 
the chocolate in the Stout (3oz/5 gallons) but my wife could smell it.  So I 
guess if you really want a chocolate/smell or taste you should probably try a 
recipe with a lot of chocolate and then experiment with the amount until you 
get a taste to your preference.  Also, thanks to all for the advice on the 
white residue in my chocolate porter which used cocoa.  I got varying 
opinions as to whether it was contaminated or not but the strange thing is in 
my refrigerated bottles the residue seems to disappear (settling out?).  They 
still taste good but I will drink them soon, just in case. 
SANITATION:  I have a question based on something recently in the HBD.  So 
far I fill my bottling bucket with bleach solution and soak overnight. 
Should I periodically remove the spigot and soak it separately as a possible 
source of contamination around the rubber gasket? 
FRUIT:   I enjoy the fruit beer thread... keep up the good comments. 
   Thanks, 
      John Penn
