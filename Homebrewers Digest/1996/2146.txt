Well, assuming your airlock doesn't dry out, if you waited many years 
the concentration of the CO2 in the beer would equalize with that in 
the atmosphere.  Even if there were no leaks between the carboy and 
stopper, the concentrations of CO2 in the beer/headspace would come 
to equalibrium with those in the airlock liquid which would eventually 
diffuse into the air... it would take a long time, though.

Subject: Treatise on Stovetop brewing


Dave Greenlee asked about stovetop issues. 
 
I tried the copper idea a couple of years ago. I think it was copper flashing. 
It was a waste of money. The copper gets wavy or curly with the heat. The heat 
transfer was dismal. 
 
There is a cheap 5 gal made in Taiwanese pot commonly sold in brew shops (~$30)
Its a thin bottomed pot, not great.  I think its hard to brew even extract 
batches with a volume lower than 5 gal. 
 
If its scorching that concerns you get a different pot. If you have any 'outlet
stores' in your area, Revereware sells a 5 gal pot - SS  w/ copper bottom for 
~$70.  Not cheap. 
 
If you are concerned about burning out elements, just alternate the pot to a 
different burner every 30 min or so and skip the diffusers. This is one of the 
hottest tips that I've gotten from HDB!!  No pun. 
 
I cook on my electric stove now with full volume 5 gal batches in a 15 gal pot 
(Polarware) over two burners (Sounds crazy don't it?) 
 
In terms of other stove issues, Rule #1 don't have boilovers. Larger volume pot
helps here. Boilovers occur at the beg of a boil and right after hop additions,
otherwise I don't have to monitor. 
 
Rule #2 clean the stove *before* you brew.  I have found that Windex on an 
otherwise clean looking stovetop before the brew session minimizes the post 
brew
stovetop mess. 
 
Rules #1 and #2 are very important in preserving one's marriage. 
 
A Viking or Wolf gas stove is definitely on my wish list, where is that damn 
lotto ticket! 
 
Hope this helps.

     Would a WOK ring work?  Bet you could find one cheap in a garage sale, 
     if you don't already have one.  I am forced to use an electric burner 
     in my current brewing location.  I am careful to get a vigorous boil 
     while avoiding hot spots, but now that I think of it, a WOK ring would 
     probably be very helpful!  I use a 28 Qt enamel pot for my boiler.  It 
     laps way over the large burner, but doesn't quite cover 2 adjacent 
     burners.  I just use the large burner.  So far, no problems.  After 
     reading HBD for a while though, I do try to use as much water as 
     possible in the boil for extract batches.  Not quite a full boil, maybe 
     3 gal water.

Subject: Re: recipe formulation


On the subject of recipe sharing and formulation: 
 
Last year was asked to duplicate Pilsener Urquel by a Chech 
friend of mine.  I began to research recipe formulation and 
found that using "Recipe Formulation Calculations for Brewers" 
from the Jan/Feb 1994 Brewing Techniques and the "Treasury of 
Beer Styles" from the special 1991 issue of Zymurgy, recipe 
formulation wasn't all that difficult.  I created a spread sheet 
on excel so it was easy to play around with the variables, and 
get a feel for how each ingredient affected color, bittering, and 
target gravity. Since then, the quality of my beer has improved 
significantly, because I am aware of how each step of the process, 
and each ingredient will affect the finished beer. 
 
Recipe formulation forces you to think about each step of the 
process and how it affects the final product, however, it is not 
for the beginning,  or even intermediate brewer.  These people 
already have too much to think about just trying to make beer 
that isn't slug-bait.  When an intermediate brewer reaches a 
state of confidence in his/her knowledge of the process of 
brewing, when the brewer is getting bored brewing the same types 
of beers repeatedly, when the brewer realizes they know how to 
brew, but not why they do certain things, then it's time to learn 
recipe formulation. 
 
Sharing is a social art.  Brewing for me is a hobby which is 
mostly social.  I like to brew with friends and I like to drink 
with friends.  I find it quite rewarding when people enjoy my 
beer, and even more rewarding when people ask for help (i.e. 
recipes) in brewing their own beer. For those of use who have 
brewed for a while, know what we are doing, can formulate 
recipes, and are not planning on opening a micro-brewery, I 
don't see the point in hoarding recipes. 
 
Just my opinion

Don writes in his mystery recipe:

These are two very different malts and I don't want anyone to get the idea 
they are equivalent.  Dark Munich is made by kilning green malt at a higher 
temperature than that used for Pils, Pale Ale, Vienna or (presumably) lighter 
Munich malts.  Victory is made similarly to DeWolf-Cosysns Biscuit.  They 
are made by taking a normally-kilned malt like Pilsner and then roasting it 
lightly at high temperatures.  The resulting flavours are quite different, 
the Victory and Biscuit having a toasty flavour with some similarty to bread 
crust.

Could we have a little glossary lesson here? What's the difference between

This is a phenomenom I have discovered with #1968 that used to be London

Subject: maltmill motorizing


Todd Kirby asked in #2143 about motorizing the MM. 
 
i just went thru this drill.  Here's what's worked real well for me. 
 
12" pulley on the mill (Grainger p/n 3X938 /$12.35. They also have the 3/8" to 
1/2" bushing you'll need to stick in the pulley bore so it'll fit on the mill 
(don't  remeber the p/n).  You'll also have to drill out the bushing in the 
center on the slotted side so the pulley setscrew will tighten down onto the 
mill shaft.  No biggie, IMO. 
 
My motor is a 1/3 hp from my HVAC cousin who swiped it off a commercial HVAC 
unit he was working on. the motor has a 3" pulley. The belt was also Grainger  
p/n 4L470 (47") for my application. 
 
Since my brewbuddy and I brew at differnt locations, I had to make this monster
portable.  Motor and mill are mounted on a  12" X 20" piece of 3/4" plywood. 
Has a couple handles for carrying like a suitcase.....A HEAVY suitcase!  It's 
got a swing out leg that supoorts the plywood atop an old plastic fermentation 
bucket wherein the crushed grain falls into. 
 
Unless you're using a big motor (like 1 hp) I would not start this mill up 
under
a load. Turn it on then add your grain. Turn it off after the hopper's empty . 
 Saves on wear and tear.

There is nothing inherent to using a secondary that increases the rate 
of fermentation.  While some yeasts (more specifically those that 
are early flocculators like Wyeast #1968 or the Samuel Smith's yeast) 
do benefit from some agitation, you need not rack (and, as you say, 
risk the increased chance of infection and oxidation... although *some* 
yeasts will respond favourably to aeration during racking *IF* it is 
done while the fermentation is still going on -- result: more diacetyl) 
to resuspend the yeast.  You can swirl the primary. 
 
If you pitch a big-enough starter and aerate well, with many yeasts you 
can bottle in two-weeks even when using only a primary.  I kegged a 
batch of Special Bitter Friday that I brewed only 12 days earlier. 
I used Wyeast #1028 London Ale yeast, an Oxynater(tm) for getting lots 
of oxygen in the wort, a 2 Liter starter and the beer went from 1.045 to 
1.014 in three days at 68-70F.  It had four inches of kraeusen within 
6 hours.  The beer dropped bright after a week and, if hard-pressed, 
I could have bottled then, only seven days after pitching.  I waited an 
extra week because the main reason I brewed this batch was to build up 
yeast for a Barleywine which I brewed last Friday. 
 
Oliver continues:

>you will do so with an even hand. 
 
In my book I don't say: "Use only a primary."  I say these are the pluses 
and these are the minuses -- decide for yourself.  I do the same for 
blowoff vs. non-blowoff, glass vs. plastic fermenters, closed vs. open 
fermentation, aeration vs. oxygen... 
 
I've been a subscriber to HBD since 1987 and I've heard each of these debates 
at least six times.  I'm well aware of both sides and it is my personal 
opinion that unless you are lagering or need room for fruit or want to 
dump another batch of wort on the yeast, there is no need for a secondary. 
Four weeks in a primary, in my experience, is virtually equivalent to 
two weeks in a primary plus two weeks in a secondary and is: 
 
1. less work and time, 
2. less chance of oxidation, 
3. less chance of infection, and 
4. less use of sanitizers.

     Now for a request.  Is there a style defining Kolsch beer available in 
     Texas?  I recently brewed a Kolsch from a kit that was one of the best 
     beers I've had in quite a while.  The fruityness was incredible.  I 
     just don't know if it was true to style or not, because I am 
     unfamiliar with the style.  I used Wyeast Kolsch and fermented 
     relatively warm due to our hot and dry summer. 
 
Koelsches are not supposed to be extremely fruity.  Some are very mildly 
fruity, but most are just barely fruity and rather lager-like.  I feel that 
the best examples (such as Muehler Koelsch) have a significant DMS 
character.  The problem with Koesches is the same one we have with 
Duesseldorfer Altbiers... the best ones are brewed in brewpubs in their 
respective cities and they simply don't bottle (some, like Zum Uerige, can 
be purchased in bottles at the brewery).  Dom Koelsch comes in cans and 
(for a canned beer) is a remarkably good Koelsch!  That may be imported 
into the US, but I haven't seen it... anyone? 
 
I don't know whether you get these in Texas, but look for Goose Island's 
"Summer" and Hart Brewing's "Kalsch" (with an umlaut over the a -- I figured 
adding the "e" would be confusing).  I feel that these are close to the mark 
(although I would like a little more malt/DMS aroma). 
 
If the beer you made is pale, light-bodied, and evenly balanced, you're 
more than halfway to the flavour of a Koelsch.  Try fermenting cooler next 
time -- more like 60F.

Hi, folks; 
        A corollary to the fruit thread comes to mind. I was 
brewing my usual summer brew; a light, 2.5% alcohol ale. Whilst 
the extract was in the boil, i noticed an old unopened 
half-gallon of cranberry juice cocktail waaaay in the back of the 
fridge. Since I subscribe to the "wing-it" school of brewing, I 
tossed it in the primary, and poured the hot stuff into it  and 
the cold water. 
        It's pretty good. I don't notice the juice, except in 
fruity overtones, and a bit of a cranberry finish. Anybody else 
ever try brewing with fruit juices? frozen concentrates?

I'm a confirmed extract brewer, and I generally use molasses in

I think you accurately called the main downside of this approach:  poor 
hot-break.  I suppose 15 minutes will get you some, but more time would 
certainly be better.  Yes, extract will break just as well as all-grain wort. 
 
Another place you *may* be losing IBU's is in the IBU's themselves, so to 
speak.  Someone posted here recently (during the Blue Whale Ale thread?) that 
IBU utilization *decreases* as IBU's increase!  A small-volume boil 
effectively concentrates your IBU's, so any underutilization due to this 
effect will not be alleviated.  I don't know how much of an effect this is 
(if any), compared with the effect of SG. 
 
And since the IBU's are so concentrated, would the relatively-thin wort 
diminish the wort-binding effects of all that alpha-whatever?  Perhaps that's 
the same effect.  Just guessing here. 
 
Surely you can come up with a larger vessel to brew with -- even a 16-quart 
stainless stockpot will hold 3-1/2 gal of boiling wort, and should be 
available for less than $25.  And it seems that the "beware of aluminum" 
concern has been mitigated lately with newer information -- research the 
topic (a keyword search on "aluminum" at The Brewery's On-Line HBD will get 
you started), and if you still feel comfortable using aluminum, you can get 
an aluminum stockpot 5 gallons or larger for a very reasonable price.  Even 
the old enamel-on-steel vessels are fine given proper care.

Eric Schoville asks about his infected keg (bummer dude).  While I guess it's 
possible that the iodophor air-dry exposure caused a problem, it's more 
likely that you (or the shop) didn't "recondition" the keg adequately -- 
remove/replace  all O-rings, disassemble the keg fittings completely, clean 
well with strong cleanser, etc.  Any leftover soda-pop stuck somewhere where 
the iodophor didn't get could've been harboring critters.  Coulda been 
somewhere else in your equipment/technique, too. 
 
Also -- DO NOT use bleach on kegs!  Bleach will eat the stainless steel for 
lunch.  Iodophor or other non-oxidizing sanitizers are fine.

Dave Greenlee asks about ScotOberfest (great name BTW): 
 
Dave, I recently made EuroFest OktoberAle (another great name -- thanks, 
Tim!) and did a side-by-side with a Paulaner.  I missed the boat on the hops 
a bit, and the ale esters, low as they were, were still a giveaway, but 
otherwise it was close enough to fool the average disroiented drunken Fest 
guzzler and I believe it's entirely possible to get reasonably close without 
all the work & time of the "real thing" using this approach.  Low 
fermentation temperatures coupled with a very clean yeast is crucial. 
 EuroFest I used Wyeast European, giving a great malty finish but with 
detectable ale-ness.  EuroFest II uses Kolsch; the hydrometer sample tasted 
kinda thin but that's typical of flat green beers sometimes.  Based on that 
sample, I'd say that the European should give you what you want with careful 
attention paid to temperature. 
 
The grain bill was pretty generic with 70% pale ale malt, 30% Munich, and 10% 
wheat malt (hey -- I *always* put 110% into my brewing!!).  I repeated this 
on EuroFest II but I think adding some crystal wouldn't hurt.  Belgian 
Biscuit and Aromatic malts would probably lend a nice touch, in conservative 
quantities. 
 
My experience with peat-smoked malt comes from three Scotch ales I sampled at 
about the same time, using 1/2 lb, 2 lb, and 3 lb respectively in five 
gallons.  The 3-lb batch was unpleasantly smoky, the 2-lb was much better but 
still a bit much for my taste, but the 1/2-lb brew was wonderfully subtle and 
let the rest of the beer's character through.  Guess which one was the one 
*I* brewed...

Subject: One-Gallon Kegs on the Cheap


This is not an original idea, although I haven't seen any discussion about it 
in the year I've been here.  I thought I'd see if anyone has messed with it 
before. 
 
Seems one could use one of those pump-up pressure sprayers, used for applying 
chemical treats to your lawn or unsuspecting insects, as a keg!?  Although 
they come in many sizes, I'm thinking the little one-gallon jobbers would be 
nearly perfect.  They would fit nicely in a fridge or an ice chest. 
 
They're typically made of thick (1/8" or more) polyethylene, and have a 
hand-pump mechanism and a sprayer valve hose.  I'd propose replacing the 
rubber sprayer hose with vinyl tubing and a thumbtap.  The pump mechanism 
must stay since it seals the vessel and is really part of the lid.  I would 
probably add a tire valve so I could force-carbonate flat beer from the 
fermenter with CO2.  The sprayer I bought to kill undesirable wildlife at my 
house has an "indented" area that's flat and would be perfect for a tire 
valve -- the valve would not be sticking out in space. 
 
Oh yeah -- NEVER EVER refill a sprayer that's been used for anything other 
than beer!!  THose weed killers can linger in the plastic and spoil an 
otherwise enjoyable life. 
 
If the vessel had a charge of CO2 for carbonating, I suppose you could serve 
a lot of the beer before it went flat.  The hand pump would replenish the 
pressure with air, so drink up.  A gallon is about a twelve-pack, so this 
ought not be a real challenge. 
 
I don't know how well the pressure is held over time (does the pump or lid 
leak?) or whether there's any other potential problem with the concept, but I 
might give'er a go one of these days.  If anyone has already tried this, 
successfully or otherwise,  I would appreciate the feedback.

Subject: Rings in my beer


Help!  I've been gone for a couple of months now.  Forgive me if this is an 
easy one.  I bottled a batch of beer 10 days ago.  This time I wasn't as 
anal about sanitation with my bottles.  I hear stories of people just hot 
rinsing bottles and nothing else.  I just washed quickly with sudsy water 
and rinsed.  Now the beer has rings around the "water line" and a film on 
top.  Six bottles had hot peppers added.  I assume that this is a sign of an 
infection.  If it is, this is the first time (seems like all my beer sucks 
lately...by the time it starts tasting good, it'll be great!).  Question: 
Is it safe to drink and evaluate the impact of this infection?  TIA.

I planted a few hop rhizomes this spring and am anticipating their harvest 
in the next few weeks.  The only problem is my notes regarding which 
varieties were planted where are nowhere to be found.  Is there any method 
of determining what variety they are by looking at them.  I've tried lifting

If it helps, the three varieties are Northern Brewer, Cascade and

Hi Collective! 
 
Just sitting here watching the siphon draining into the bucket, awaiting my 
bottling experience, and got to thinking about my sterilization method.  I 
wash 'em out upon drinking, then run the whole load thru the dishwasher, 
first with detergent, then bleach, then rinse with water heat on.  I've been 
doing this for 5 or 6 batches with no probs, but I just read a clip from one 
of the Charlie books that sez it's not such a great idea. 
 
I learned to brew with Charlie, but I understand his shortcomings and don't 
generally take his word as pure gospel.  I have learned at least as much 
here, so let me know teachers: Should I have reason to worry, or should I 
Relax, etc...

When cleaning corny kegs, it is a good idea to remove the ball lock / 
pin lock fittings and scrub the poppets, "O" ring and inside of dip 
tube. After general cleaning and visual inspection of interior surface, 
re assemble and Add iodophor solution, charge the keg with enough Co2 to 
get a good seal and shake vigorously. Let stand for 10 minutes or more 
then dispense the solution through the serve tube to insure the dip tube 
is clean / clear. Rinse with water. I have used this procedure for some 
time now with no problems.

I just run them through the entire cycle with just water.  It gets pretty 
hot in there when the electric element is drying.  Lots of steam too.  I've 
never measured the temperature, though, because it would cause worry.  Five 
batches this way, no spoilage, and my fingers are always crossed.

Subject: RE: When To Harvest


How to tell: 
 
1. Pick a cone (a medium sized cone from the middle of the vine). 
2. Cut the cone in half and examine.  Cones ready for harvest ought to have 
a dark yellow powder in the middle (a lot like highway paint). 
3.  Squeeze it.  The cone should feel papery and not damp.  Cones ready for 
harvest ought to spring back to shape after squeezing whereas premature 
cones will stay compressed. 
4.  Take a whiff; smell the cones.  Do they smell hoppy? 
5. Touch a few, your hands ought to smell like hops. 
 
That's when you are ready for harvest... CDR

Why you Keith!  As a recovering Southern Baptist, I resemble 
that remark! 
 
Oh, beer related stuff?  What's with Pete Slosberg lately? 
I've seen (and bought) Pete's Wicked Maple Porter, Pete's 
Wicked Strawberry Blonde, and Pete's Wicked Multigrain (barley, 
oats, wheat, and rye) beers in the grocery store (supermarket 
to you yankees) in the past few weeks.  The Porter was pretty 
good (though caramel colored according to the label) with a 
nice maple character, the Strawberry Blonde had just a hint of 
strawberry, and the multigrain was a pretty good beer but I had 
a hard time tasting anything out of the ordinary.  Looks like 
Pete's is blasting out anything they can think of. 
 
Also, I am sitting in Tallahassee, Florida after visiting The 
Buckhead Brewery and Grill and I defy Michael Jackson to say 
that Southern beers are "timid" after visiting there!  I had a 
great conversation and brewery tour with Gary Essex, Head 
Brewer, and I highly recommend a visit to anyone who finds 
themselves in the area.  A beautiful brewery with a great 
lineup of beers.

Subject: Really hot stove deal!


  
I thought the collective would like to hear about my stove 'Deal of the 
Century'. I was at an estate sale recently and saw in the corner of the 
basement an old canning stove made by a company called Griswold. I paid 
(without haggling over price) $15 for it and stuck it in the store room 
with intentions of restoring it and using it for homebrewing. After being 
told by my brewing partners wife "you guys gotta by a stove to brew on.. 
your ruining my kitchen stove... etc" , we started looking into a King 
Cooker and then it dawned on me.... duhhhh what about that canning 
stove.... Well, after $1.35 for a fitting and retrieving a spare propane 
tank and regulator from an old discarded grill, we were shooting some 
serious flames from both burners from this little cast iron beauty. We had 
13 gallons of wort to a full boil in about 20 minutes. After full boil was 
achieved, we backed one burner down to about 60% and achieved a nice left 
to right rolling boil. 
Soot was a little much on the pot but looks like a good batch of 
California Common in the primaries right now... Keep your eye open for one 
of these little things.. I see them frequently at estate sales and plan to 
buy another.

Subject: Sulfur Dioxide, Getting to know you,


Brewsters: 
 
I've been out of town for a few days and am behind on commenting on comments 
directed toward me. 
 
As much as I'd like to acceed to AlK's pleas to give up, I can't. BTW who said 
this was a fight?  I didn't. 
 
Unfortunately for Al, I can't quote here the volumes of literature that firmly 
develop the theme that sulfurous acid at pH's below 3.0  and at high enough 
concentrations is a sterilant. Read the book and stop challenging dogma or else
provide a professional, well documented quote which destroys decades of work by
microbiologists all over the world. No dictionaries please. 
 
I will only answer one comment about sporulating yeasts, etc. 
 
Table Wines, op. cit p. 399: 
 
 
"The antiseptic action of sulfur dioxide toward microorganisms, particularly 
yeasts, varies with their stage of development and the numbers present.  It is 
greater toward the resting sporulating, yeasts....." 
 
 
The essence of the entire text is that sulfur dioxide in solution is very 
reactive with oxygen, various carbonyl compounds in the must and from the 
yeast,
and  is stripped from the solution by carbon dioxide bubbles.  I suppose this 
could lead you to conclude that it is not a sterilant, since if you put low 
levels ( say less than 100 ppm) of sulfur dioxide into a must , it will lilkely
ferment eventually, especially if you add yeast. This is because the sulfurous 
acid has been depleted by the above mechanisms and is no longer there.  I have 
seen grape juices on the HB market that sit in a plastic bag at RT and don't 
ferment.  The bag says "contains sulfites".  It is likely that sulfur dioxide 
content is high enough to prevent fementation and will be depleted upon opening
by reaction with air and allow fermentation. It may also be the purpose of the 
sulfite to prevent browning of a juice which has been thermally sterilized. I 
prefer the former scenario , since a colleague once purchased a bag which could
never be coaxed into fermenting. 
 
By periodically testing and adding sufficient make-up sulfites, a juice or wine
with a pH below 3 will remain stable to microbiological action. The pH of worts
or beers are generally too high to permit the sulfite to be active as a 
sterilant. Some yeasts exhibit extraordinary tolerance to sulfur dioxide, some 
even manufacture it, but at a high enough level and at a pH less than 3, it is 
a sterilant.  In my last note on this subject  to HBD the levels in the 
quotation from TW were for normal levels used in the production of wine in 
which
the minimal level is considered best.  Don't confuse these comments with the 
ability of sulfur dioxide to be an excellent sterilant at high enough 
concentrations and a pH of less than 3.0. 
 
 
Greg Douhan comments that I, AlK and others should take a week off and get to 
know each other. We have, more like a month. You haven't been privy to the, at 
last count, 77 e-mails that have flowed between AlK, SteveA and I and others 
who
may prefer to remain nameless. These epistles ranged over the temperature, 
concentration, etc. of mashes, kinetics and many other related topics.  We may 
even do some simple mashing experiments to provide us with a better 
understanding of the behavior of modern malts as contrasted with much of the 
older published literature, etc., etc.  If we do it and if it makes sense we 
intend to publish it here. We got off here when we realized our quotations, 
ruminating and discussions were not of interest to too many others and 
difficult
to follow, although some people have recently asked to be copied in on our 
conversations. We try to limit our conversations in the HBD to those which we  
think are useful to some members at least.  Please don't misunderstand.  Our 
fussing and fighting is not based on egos - or at least mine isn't. (smiley 
face
here). 
 
Unfortunately, not everything in this world is crystal clear and one of the 
best
ways to expose all the parameters is through the advocate system which is the 
basis of the US legal system and the one we use. If Steve, Al and I lived close
enough together, we would likely be drinking beer and discussing these subjects
in an animated fashion. Perhaps we are a little too personal in our jibes in an
uninformed audience and it appears we are holding knives at each others 
throats.
Not true.  Or at least I'm not.  (smiley face here) 
 
Keep on brewin'
