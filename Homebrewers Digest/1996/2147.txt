Subject: Censorship on HBD


I recall recently, about the time that the AOB _volunteered_ to publish 
the HBD, the deeply held concerns that the digest might get censored. 
In the wake of NOKOMAREE postings, there are a large number of calls 
for just such censorship.  IMHO, all censorship is a VERY BAD THING. 
Let's use that page down key before we resort to censorship or other 
tyrannical practices in this forum. 
 
Regarding the recent rantings: please print out a copy and review the 
rules of netiquette before you start to type when your blood gets to 
boiling.  This is a hobby and is supposed to be enjoyable.

- ---- 
 
Yes, you can make an excellent Hefe-Weizen!  A colleague and I made an 
excellent Hefe Weizen earlier this summer.  The beer went over very well 
at our company's picnic.  Perhaps cut down a little on the extract (the 
gravity was a little high for the style).  It can also be argued that the 
beer was just a smidgeon hoppy (reduce by perhaps 25 to 50 percent).  The 
final gravity was quite high, but this was not detrimental.  As a whole 
the extract grain ratio ended up (I think) to be about 50% barley and 50% 
wheat.  You could call Northwestern Extract (Brookfield Wisconsin, I 
believe) and ask them their ratios.  Excellent vanilla, clove and banana 
tones abound.  Here's the recipe: 
 
Ingredients (for 5 gallons) 
 
4 Pounds Weizen Dry Malt Extract (Northwestern) 
2 Pounds Light Dry Malt Extract (Northwestern) 
1/2 Pounds Crushed Munich Malt (20 L0) 
1 Pound Crushed Wheat Malt 
1/2 Pounds Crushed Belgian Pils Malt (DeWolf-Cosyn) 
5 gallons of Menasha, Wisconsin Water (fairly hard) 
2 tsp. CaCO2 Crystals 
1 tsp. Burton Water Crystals 
1 ounce Perle Hops (7.7 percent Alpha Acids) 
1 ounce Willamette Hops (3.9 percent Alpha Acids) 
Wiehenstephen Wheat Yeasts (Wyeast #3068) 
 
Starting Specific Gravity: 1.057, 
Finishing Specific Gravity: 1.019, 
Alcohol by Volume: 4.9 percent 
 
Procedure 
 
Add crystals to about 3 gallons of water in brew pot.  Bring water to 155 
0F. Place crushed grains in grain bag.  Steep in brewpot (maintaining 
temperature) for 50 minutes. Sparge (rinse) grains with 2 quarts of 148 0F 
water. Bring water to boil.  Add malt extract. Slowly return water to 
boil. As water boils off brewpot as steam, continue adding water to keep 
water level constant. Boil for 10 minutes.  Place Perle hops in a hop bag 
and add to boil.  Boil for 35 minutes.  Add half of Willamette hops to hop 
bag.  Boil for 10 minutes more.  Add last half of Willamette hops to hop 
bag.  Boil for another 5 minutes. Remove heat. Chill wort (unfermented 
beer) with immersion chiller.  Transfer to fermenter.  Aerate by shaking. 
Pitch yeast.  Wait 1 week.  Transfer beer to secondary fermenter.  Wait 2 
weeks.  Siphon to keg. Carbonate and serve.

Subject: Sanitizing bottles (or lack thereof)


     Nathan writes that he wasn't as anal about sanitizing his bottles, 
     partly because he has read here about people just washing and filling. 
 
     Now he has an infection.  To answer Nathan, yes it's OK to taste it 
     from a health standpoint (i.e., it won't kill you).  It may not be a 
     pleasant experience, though. 
 
     I would like to warn others to not be so maverick about sanitation.  I 
     have also done the old "just blast it with hot water before filling" 
     routine, and haven't had any problems, but I only do that with 
     counter-pressure bottled beer intended for relatively quick 
     consumption. 
 
     There is bacteria in most (if not all) drinking water.  Most of it 
     won't do well in beer, but I guess you could get unlucky, especially 
     if you have your own well. 
 
     It's important to carefully inspect each bottle to make sure there is 
     nothing in it (mold, etc.) before any sanitizing method.  I don't even 
     bother trying to clean bottles that are moldy, it's not worth my time. 
 
     If you have a "beer safe" water supply, and have never had these 
     problems despite being "maverick," continue as always.  But if you're 
     unsure, why take the chance? 
 
     Have Fun!

Subject: Counterclockwise Whirlpooling


This may be the dumbest question ever posted to the HBD.  I recently acquired 
a two tier converted Sanke keg brewing system. The boil pot is plumbed so that 
you can recirculate the wort in a counterclockwise direction.  This serves the 
dual purpose of maximizing immersion wort chiller cooling efficiency and 
whirlpooling hot/cold break into the center of the keg.  I know that in the 
northern hemisphere water goes down the drain in a clockwise pattern, and in 
the southern hemisphere it drains counterclockwise.  Here's the dumb question. 
Since I am in the northern hemisphere, will the counterclockwise motion of my 
whirlpool be offset or disturbed by the gravitational/cosmological tendancy 
of fluids to drain in the opposite direction?  What say you, all you 
astrophysicists/brewers?

Subject: RE: Oktoberfest/Scotch ale


     There's no way I couldn't respond to Dave Greenlee's post! 
 
     Dave writes in wondering about the differences between Oktoberfests 
     and Scotch ales.  He answers himself pretty well in his own post! 
 
     First, the fact that Oktoberfest is a lager and Scotch ale is, as the 
     name suggests, an ale, is a pretty huge difference! (I won't get into 
     it) 
 
     Another big difference is in the malt profile.  Caramel and toastiness 
     are very different flavors.  One of the most common flaws in 
     homebrewed Oktoberfest is that the malt flavor is caramel instead of 
     toast.  I tasted the two Oktoberfests contending for the final round 
     at the BBC World Homebrew Contest two weeks ago, and they were both 
     flawed in this way. 
 
     Scotch ale, on the other hand, should have caramel notes.  I've read 
     that some brewers caramelize a small volume of the wort and add it 
     back to the boil to intensify this flavor. 
 
     I'm not an expert about Scotch Ales, but I do know a bit about 
     Festbiers.  An Oktoberfest can have a wide range of colors (deep gold 
     to deep amber-red, modern versions often substantially lighter than 
     traditional ones), and a broad range of original gravities (again, 
     modern examples being lighter).  Hop bitterness is there, in levels 
     just high enough to make one appreciate the toasty-maltiness and to 
     help make the finish more lasting and elegant. 
 
     It is a malt-driven beer, toasty, not caramel(can't say that enough!). 
     Munich and/or Vienna malts must be used in large quantities to achieve 
     toastiness.  Very little crystal malt should be used, it gives a 
     caramel taste.  There are decent Munich malts available from German 
     sources. 
 
     There is no appreciable hop aroma, and hop flavor is very low.  My 
     award winning Festbier only has 3 alpha acid units for bittering and 2 
     AAU's for flavoring a 5.5 gallon batch with a starting gravity of 
     1.062.  No finishing hops are used. 
 
     The hypothetical beer Dave describes might be quite interesting, but 
     it sounds like it would just be a heavily smoky scotch ale, not much 
     in the way of Oktoberfest happening in it. 
 
     Have Fun!

Subject: Re: Recipe Design


Morning Brewmeisters, 
 
I'm afraid I have to chime in and throw my $0.02 in with the SUDS/spread 
sheet crowd.  I used SUDS 4.0 to design a Samiclaus clone.  I did a lot of 
research (BTW, Michael Jackson's writings were invaluable!) and played with 
the numbers.  Then I got a bottle, tasted, readjusted, and made the beer.  I 
have a friend that drinks Sami' all the time, he says I came pretty close, 
but he's waiting for it to age a full year for his final assessment.  It was 
pretty easy using the software, because you can just try adjusting 
ingredients and see how it affects your target values. 
 
With regards to difficulty in designing recipes: 
You can either use an existing recipe and tweak it, or set out on your own. 
It's not as hard as you might think.  Besides, I don't think the recipe is 
as important as the process used to make the beer.  There really *is* no 
award winning recipe.  It's the brewer who makes it into beer. 
 
Most beer recipes I've seen in books give you choices in what hops to 
select, and sometimes the yeast too.  If you're doing that already, you're 
halfway there!  The best thing to do, IMHO, is make lots of beer, 
experiment, and TAKE NOTES, otherwise you can't possibly remember everything 
you did. 
 
Have a Homebrew day!

Do I read you correctly to mean that you at least semi-agree with me that the 
lager vs. ale distinction is the
primary one between Scot and Okt and that your EFOA-1 did, in fact, thus have 
Scot characteristics? Whether it
did or didn't, and more importantly, was EFOA-1 _tasty_? As you might detect 
from my original post, I'm just
nutso about all three styles - scot, rauch, and okt - but though I put all of 
them head'n'shoulders above most
other styles except maybe porters and stouts (do you see a trend here?), I 
prefer them in the order just named.
You were shooting for a particular style and went on to get it, but looking 
back at it do you say to yourself,
'but if I were making this for myself ...'? 
 
Thanks for the advice about the peat smoked malt, too. It answers a question 
which I had intended, but failed,
to ask, i.e. whether in moving the brew from a Scot to a Rauch if I could just 
use more peat malt or would need
to add (or substitute) hardwood smoked malt or liquid smoke. My prior post just
presumed that the answer which
you gave would be the correct one, but you've confirmed it. It might be 
interesting, I think, to leave the
peat in and just add hardwood, though, to give the smoke flavor a bit of 
complexity...
 
As always, many, many, thanks for your kind and gracious support.

Subject: re: recipe formulation


Good morning all, 
 
>>>Edward J. Steinkamp said: 
Recipe formulation forces you to think about each step of the 
process and how it affects the final product, however, it is not 
for the beginning,  or even intermediate brewer.  These people 
already have too much to think about just trying to make beer 
that isn't slug-bait. 
<<< 
 
Recipe formulation is not that difficult.   We in the homebrew community 
seem to try to make advanced brewing something really difficult only to 
be achieved by the best after years in the hobby.  This simply is not 
true.  Advanced brewing is about as difficult as making biscuits from 
scratch instead of using Bisquick! 
 
The first extract batch of beer I brewed was about batch #100 I am not 
sure of the number as that batch didn't make into my brewing records. 
Sort of like pulling a TV dinner out of the freezer because your too lazy 
to cook.  I started brewing all grain.  I began formulating my own 
recipes at about batch #8 or 9.  Recipe formulation requires 
understanding  of what you what to make and a few simple math problems, 
big deal. 
 
Remember in its simplest form all grain brewing entails crushing the 
grain, infusing it with hot water to bring the mash into the 
scarification range, rinsing out the sugar, boiling the wort, adding 
hops, cooling then pitching it with yeast.  Once you get to the cooling 
part if you have done an extract batch every thing is the same provided 
you are doing a full boil. 
 
So for those of you who are still opening cans or bags of sticky stuff 
that goes everywhere, throw that stuff away and get on the grain train to 
BETTER BEER.

Dave Greenlee discusses Scottish vs Oktoberfest beers, 
 
I made an observation a couple years ago. 
 
A buddy of mine, great brewer, made a scottish had me sample it, but didn't 
tell
me what it was. To me it tasted like Paulaner Salvator.  Give me this recipe!! 
 
He was a little disappointed.  It wasn't a bock, it was a scottish fermented 
with the Wyeast.  It had that elusive malty profile.  Maybe I need to call him 
for the recipe right now!!! Hopefully he hasn't latched onto the recent HBD 
discussion and rethought the notion of recipe sharing. 
 
I had thought about making a bock or festbier: munich malt and german hops etc 
but with the scottish yeast.  Your post refreshed my memory - Hmmm - gotta go 
now.

Hi, 
     There's been some discussion lately of electric stovetop brewing 
and it's related problems.  I went through this last fall and posted 
a question regarding a charred burner connector and dammage resulting 
from heat being trapped by a big pot sitting on top of a standard large

great, problem solved. 
 If anybody wishes to have more details send me private E-mail or 
look in the archives of aprox. last Nov.  No need (at this point) to 
post it here, again.

Subject: NG Ring Burner source


Sorry to follow up a post so late, but I got behind in my 
HDB's and found I might be of help in finding a source for 
natural gas ring burners.  In HBD 2126 Joe Fleming asks for a source 
for NG burners. 
 
Earlier this month I was in Columbus, Ohio judging for the state 
fair HB competition, and I stopped into a restaurant supply store 
next to the fairgrounds.  Lo and behold I found that they carry a 
cast iron 8" natural gas ring burner (a stove replacement burner 
I'm told) for $33.50. 
 
The burner is made by Town Food Service Equipment, is made in China 
looks like the Solarflo Z-10.  Round with about 22 brass jets in the 
outside ring and 4 on the inside ring.  It has a 1/2" NPT fitting, 
comes with a pilot light fitting and puts out 80,000 BTU (according to 
Town 1-800-221-5032 their P/N 226800). 
 
I purchased it from Wasserstrom Restaurant Supply in Columbus 
(1-800-829-3027 or 614-228-6525) and I have no affiliation with them 
whatsoever. The Wasserstrom item number is 205590, and you will probably 
need it if you are going to order it. I have yet to try the burner 
(probably fire it up tonight), but it appears well made and might be 
just the ticket for some of you. 
 
Wasserstrom's does sell by mail, and if you buy it before 8/17 you get 
another 10% off. 
 
Feel free to email me with any questions.

   Some things work for some homebrewers and not for others.  I've heard of 
using dishwashers for cleaning bottles and it works for some.  My personal 
experience was with a crappy--broke in less than 4 years so we scrapped 
it--builder's model GE dishwasher which seemed to put crap into the bottles 
instead of cleaning them.  I only used it once on my second batch and I got 
the telltale infection rings around the top of the bottle.  Now I use bleach 
solution and has worked for me.  I used to use a bleach solution and soak 
about a dozen bottles a day until I had a couple of cases+.  An email from 
George De Piro pointed out to me the relatively quick evaporation of the 
bleach/chlorine such that I will now remember to replenish my bleach solution 
daily or I will soak an entire two cases+ at one time.

Subject: Munich Malt


Without going in to lots of detail, here is the basic 
difference between pale and munich malt: pale malt is 
dried at a low temperature (low inside the malt kernel, 
the air temp may start out hot) first and then kilned 
(toasted) at a high temperature (70-90 degrees C). Munich 
malt is dried at a high temperature (45-50 degrees C) and 
then kilned at 90-100 degrees C. It's considered cheating 
if the maltster has to roast the malt to get the right 
color. The color is supposed to happen as it slowly dries 
at 45-50 degrees C. To get this temperature inside the malt, 
the air flow is lowered. 
 
In crystal malts, the air flow may be cut off completely with 
a tarp and the malt stewed fully moist at 65-70 degrees C to 
"mash in the husk". They are then dried and roasted at various 
temperatures for different effects. 
 
It's pretty easy to make these various malts for yourself. Buy 
"sprouting" barley (with husk) from your local health food store. 
Wait till fall or winter so you can floor it with a nice cool 
temperature. Even if you don't make enough for a full batch, 
you can learn a lot by malting test batches and mashing in cups 
to see the different effects.

Subject: Iodophor in Australia


        I have been kegging for nearly a year, and I have 7 steel Firestone 
kegs. I understand bleach corrodes steel. I have also heard a lot about 
Iodophor. Is it available in Australia? I've never seen it around. Also, is 
bleach really that corrosive in the amounts necessary to sterilise a keg (I 
use 5 tablespoons/25 litres)??? 
        What is wrong with SO2? Metabisulfite would release SO2 in contact 
with an acidic solution, and the gas should thoroughly disinfect all nooks 
and crannies, shouldn't it? 
        Any help appreciated, particularly about the Iodophor. 
        Cheers.

Subject: Secondary Fermentation


If there is one subject that seems to be beat around its this one. 
 
I'm new to home brewing so I'm still in the experimental stage of 
trying to figure out what is best for my brew. 
 
The first batch I put on about 6 days ago is an American style light 
beer. It stopped fermenting vigorously about two days ago. I just 
got done transferring it to a glass carboy about an hour ago and 
already I can see it start to clear up about a centimetre from the 
top of the liquid line. 
 
These are the questions I would like answered: 
 
1. Should I have filled up the carboy to the bottom of the neck with 
cooled boiled water or my favourite brand name beer? 
2. Should I expect to see activity as in more bubbles of CO2 coming 
out of the air lock? 
3. What if I don't see any bubbles? 
4. Before I bottle my beer, in about 10 days, I plan to transfer the 
beer back into my primary, mix in the appropriate amount of sugar and 
then pour it into the bottles using the spigot on the pail. Should I 
be worried about oxygen at this point in the process? 
 
Any help or comments would be greatly appreciated.

A couple times in the recent past, the topic of Thermoelectric Coolers has 
arisen.  Melcor has an *excellent* page dedicated to their line of coolers at 
http://www.melcor.com.  Tons of technical and applications data.  If you're 
at all interested in this technology, this page will get you off to a great

Yeah we all know about killing dogs by feeding them hops but what about 
the converse?  Will dog excrement kill your hop plants?  Am I going to 
have to have my neighbor taken care of...?

Subject: Irish Moss Usage


All, 
Billy Cole write about forgetting to put in the irish moss while boiling 
his brew. He wants to know how to clear his brew now that the brew is going 
to the secondary. 
I am relatively new to brewing and thought the purpose of irish moss was 
to aid in the reduction of chill haze, not clearing in the fermentation 
process. What are the benefits of irish moss? Are there any drawbacks? 
 
Billy, To clear brew in the secondary, I use geletin. So far so good...

Duffy, I also planted some hops that spring. I didn't rely on notes, but 
instead made myself some rathewr weatherproof tags so that I knew what I 
had. The tags have been exposed to the light all summer, and look like new. 
I printed them on a laser printer, and laminated with the self stick 
laminate sheets sold at the office supply store. 
 
However, knowing that you are now in this dilema, I would suggest that you 
try contacting John I Haas, Inc, a commercial grower of hops. They were kind 
enough to send me a copy of their color catalog which features full color 
pictures of leaves and cones. The Cascade variety is failrly easy to notice. 
The upper leaves are almost heart shaped. The Nothern Brewer and Willamette 
are close, and perhaps the pictures will help sort 'em out.
