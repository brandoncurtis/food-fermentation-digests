Both the botulism toxin and bacteria will be well and truly destroyed by the 
typical 1 hr boil. 
 
I do agree that given the possibilities of off flavors, it's probably best 
to ditch the bag.

Subject: Fruit Beer


Hello 
 
Here is a post about fruit beers.  I read in a book called the Brewer s 
Companion by Randy Mosher that you could make fruit beer by priming with a 
good quality fruit liqueur.  I tried using this method.  I made a wheat beer 
base with 8 oz. of dried malto dextrin for residual sweetness.  At bottling 
time I added about a bottle of peach schnapps.  I liked the way it tasted. 
 It could have used a little less peach flavor and a lot less carbonation.  I 
was wondering if anyone else tried making fruit beer this way and if there is 
away to figure out how much liqueur is equal to one cup of corn sugar? 
 
Thank you

Being from Rhode Island, a lot of people ask if I can make a beer that 
resembles 'Gansett. 
Being an outsider (only lived here 15 years) I have no real recollection 
of the taste and have only tried it while here in the navy 25 years ago. 
At that time it was just considered a "cheap" beer and it's finer points 
went unappreciated until the micro revolution after the Cranston 
brewery's demise. 
There must be a few people out there that have a good idea of how this 
fine lager was produced, and ask that they share the recipe and process.

Mike asked for a Simple Recipe for a beer for a virgin brewer. I think most of 
us here would say that your status as a virgin really will not make much 
difference to a recipe, except perhaps that you might like it with less hops. 
 
A Simple Recipe is hard to define too. A simple recipe for which style? Well, I
will assume you mean a common all-extract American Pale Ale. That would be 
pretty easy: 
 
Barebones Beer 
6lbs of Pale Hopped Extract 
1 packet of quality Dry Ale Yeast. 
 
Now, If you want to add your own Hops, for better Hop Flavor, 
6 lbs of Unhopped Pale Extract 
1.5 oz of ex. Cascade, Hops half added at beginning and middle of the boil. 
1 packet of quality dry ale yeast 
 
But, lets say you want some sweetness, a bit more complexity, 
4 lbs Unhopped Pale Extract 
2 lbs of Unhopped Amber Extract 
1.5 oz of ex. Cascade, Hops half added at beginning and middle of the boil. 
1 packet of quality dry ale yeast 
 
But maybe you like your beer darker than that (in spite of virginity) ;) 
4 lbs Unhopped Pale Extract 
1 lbs of Unhopped Amber Extract 
1 lbs of Unhopped Dark Extract 
1.5 oz of ex. Cascade, Hops half added at beginning and middle of the boil. 
1 packet of quality dry ale yeast 
 
Okay, I think you get the idea. There are a multitude of possibilities. Hit the
Yellow Pages for a Homebrew Supply Shop and talk to them. They probably have a 
kit that includes all the above ingredients and instructions. For further 
instructions on the Equipment and Processes, see my web page (or many of the 
brewing www pages) for my file, How To Brew Your First Beer, it has helped many
a beginner over the past few years.

In-Reply-To: The letter of Friday, 16 August 1996 10:04pm ET 
 
Imagine my confusion as I stood in my kitchen (actually my Wifes' kitchen) at 
5:00a.m. with one of my twin daughters, who was asserting her desire for an 
early morning breakfast, when I saw this large black-red puddle on the floor, 
stretching from the counter to under the 'fridge.  Was it a bad steak in a 
defrosted freezer?  Did one of the damn older kids hide some hamburger in the 
cupboard?  Did somebody get murdered in the kitchen? My God- is he still in 
the house? 
Then I spotted the source - on the wine rack, next to the dandelion wine, a 
suspiciously empty bottled that first held some Chapeau Kriek Lambic, then 
(briefly) some coffee porter.  You know those lambic bottles that are corked 
AND capped?  Now I know why.  OK, I'm DUMB DUMB DUMB.  I knew why before, 
but they must use metric caps in Belgium, 'cause my caps wouldn't fit.  I 
still should have 'rigged a wire. 
After realizing what happened, and who was at fault, and hearing the other 
twinLOUDLY expressing the feeling she's been left out, I tried three things at 
thesame time:  Clean up the mess as fast as I can and feed  the twins before 
my wife gets up and sees it, no feed the twins first to quiet them down, then 
clean up... what was third thing?  Oh S#$T!  Where's the formula?  Oh yeah, 
ther're on whole milk! -- Too late, the wifes'up. RUN!!! No she'll only find 
you.  (Amazing how fast the mind works sometimes) 
After about 45 minutes of scrubbing and mopping and squirting bleach down the 
register, and searching for the cork (so she wouldn't realize how forcefull 
the event had been, and lucky we were no one was in the kitchen) I thought I'd 
use some bandwith to share my misfortune, and re-iterate:  For Petes' sake, 
WIRE THOSE CORKS ON.  Like I should have.  I've never had to dump a batch 
(I'm not that good, I'm just that stubborn), but the loss I felt over that one 
bottle was bad enough.

Subject: Nestle's Tollhouse Porter


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager... 
 
About a month ago, Rich Byrnes alluded to this creation and had some 
requests for the recipe. I had some commercial plans for the recipe 
(which I decided not to pursue. Think I'd rather be a homebrewer...), 
so I had asked him NOT to share it. 
 
After reading Don Trotter's treatise on recipe sharing (yes, Don. I 
understand the vein in which you claim to have written it, but your 
insistence that you'll not share recipes is... well, let's just say 
that it's not in character with your claim.), and being a devoted 
formulator of recipes, I decided to share this. 
 
I apologize for those that requested it and had to wait for me to 
come to my senses...

Mashing comments 
During and following mashout, and prior to transferring to the boil kettle, 
remove a gallon at a time of the first runnings to a pot. Boil until 
caramellized and return to the mash tun. Continue until 1/4 to 3/8 of 
the final volume has been caramellized. (Five gallons in the 20 
gallon case). Throw the first wort Perle into the boil kettle prior 
to beginning the sparge.

28      66 (You don't _need_ to leave it this long. I didn't get an 
            opportunity to rack before then...) 
 
Fermentation comments 
Batch will require rousing. Transfer to secondary will normally be 
sufficient, but an occasional swirl after transfer will do no harm. 
Transfer to secondary is HIGHLY recommended due to the incredible 
amount of sediment from the chocolate powder dropping out of 
suspension after the most vigorous fermentation has subsided. (Wait 
until the kraeusen falls before racking.) 
 
Sub 8.5 # LME, 7.5 DME for pale malt for extract/specialty grain 
based (5 gallons). Scale everything else down accordingly. IBUs 
should scale fairly linearly. 
 
All sharing in the wort have raved! 
 
Have at it, my friends! And may your ruin be beered!  ;-) 
 
See ya!

Hi Folks. Whats your impression of the jet style King Kooker burners? 
Has anyone doing all grain actually scorched some wort, or is that a 
momism? I was sent the jet style in error, (miscommunication 
actually) and I want to know if I should send it back. It's quite a 
bit cheaper than the radial (ring) burner style cookers, and the 
claim that it can boil 7.5 Gal in 15 min is quite impressive (and 
tempting). My guess is that the radial style is more efficient and 
gives better control. What do you all think. Private Email is

Subject: Coriolis


I don't think Coriolis is a major factor in brewing but neverhteless the 
term refers to a "fictional force" which is one used to explain the 
deflection of moving bodies in frames of reference which are rotating with 
respect to inertial space. The usual illustration places a canoneer at the 
center of a phonograph record (CD will do) which is rotating. He fires his 
gun and follows the projectile. To an observer looking down on the record 
the projectile moves in a straight line. The path over the surface of the 
record as seen by the little guy) appears curved because the record rotates 
as the projectile flies. The extension of this model to a gunner at the 
north or south pole is obvious. At other lattitudes, it is not quite so 
easy to see what is going on. The net effect is that there appears to be an 
acceleration whose magnitude depends on the velocity of the moving particle 
and the lattitude. Maximum at the poles and 0 at the equator. Yes vortices 
swirl in the opposite direction in the southern hemisphere where the force 
is to the left of the velocity vector as opposed to the northern where the 
force is to the right. The magnitude of the force is so small that a couple 
of hyndred miles per hour is necessary to deflect the bubble in an aircraft 
sextant to the point where a correction is needed (mid lattitudes).

This is my third attempt at brewing, I have two disasters under my belt. 
I brewed Papazian's Righteous Real Ale (an Ordinary Bitter). The OG was 
1.045 and the SG at bottling was 1.009. It has been bottled for 5 days 
now and, unable to wait any longer, I tried a couple. I know I should 
wait at least a week, but... Well, it tastes great, but there's no 
carbonation. I followed correct procedures for priming with corn sugar 
(actually I put in too much -- 3/4 cup instead of the 1/2 for a bitter). 
My other batches tasted horrific and had stuck fermentations and they 
were extremely well carbonated in less than a week. I read somewhere that 
high alcohol content (I guess this would be about 4.8 abv) may slow 
carbonation down. I see yeast in each bottle so I know it's there. Do I 
have to resort to dropping in a few grains of dry yeast to each bottle? 
Someone please make me feel better by telling me that the seventh day is 
magical!! Thanks in advance...Kevin

        Why??? Do you only brew lagers? In the UK male plants are planted on 
purpose, at the rate of 4-5 per acre, in order to assure seeded hops, for a 
very good reason: Seeded hops grow a lot larger than unseeded hops. Here in 
Australia all diploid hop varieties (all except Willamette, Mt Hood, and 
other triploids) are seeded. 
        I brew mainly ales, and I am looking for a male plant to improve the 
harvest. If you only brew lagers, then you may get objectionable flavours 
from seeded hops, hence the practice in continental Europe of erradicating 
all male hops, and in New Zealand and to a lesser extent in the US of 
growing triploid (hence naturally seedless) hops. 
        Even here in Australia the overwhelming majority of beers brewed 
with Pride of Ringwood (seeded) are lagers, and although they are not really 
great beers by world standards (most of them), they have a nice, clean flavour.
So if you brew ales, you might actually consider growing a male plant :)       
        Cheers...

Subject: ESB yeast in IPA?


I'm considering using London ESB ale yeast (Wyeast #1968) in my next India 
pale ale.  Any disadvantages to this "highly flocculant" strain?  Any 
unique charactistics of the yeast that may conflict with the IPA style?  I 
plan to use oak chips in the secondary to achieve that "cask-conditioned" 
taste. 
 
TIA,

Subject: New Las Vegas Brewpub


I haven't seen this mentioned lately (but I am a bit behind on my Digest 
reading), so forgive me if it has already been brought up.  I was in Las 
Vegas last weekend and we visited the new Monte Carlo casino.  They have a 
new brewpub there that has apparently only been open about 6 weeks.  We 
showed up on a Friday night the first time; the beer was good but the cheesy 
lounge lizard piano players were clearly out of place for the crowd 
(everyone was in the 20 to 40 age group).  We left early because we couldn't 
take it anymore.  Since the beer was decent, we returned Sunday for lunch. 
Luckily there was no entertainment then.  The food was great, the quantities 
huge.  I actually left food on my plate when we left (yea, THAT happens a 
lot!).  Anyway, they have I think 5 kinds of beer; the requisite wheat, 
which was decent, but much too mild for my tastes.  The pale ale was really 
good; I had several glasses of that.  The red ale I only had a taste of, but 
it was pretty good.  They also served a stout and a Brewmaster special, 
which I don't know what that was.  Overall, everyone liked the place (with 
the exception of the entertainment).  Unfortunately I had drank too much the 
first night and was rushed during the second visit (had to get a friend off 
to the airport), so I can't give a better report.  I would say if you're in 
the area to give it a try, they're bound to get some of those little 
problems worked out.

Subject: colored carboys


     At the risk of resurrecting the skunking beer thread, 
I've been wondering why some savvy manufacturer 
has not come out with dark brown glass carboy.  I don't 
think they would have to alter the manufacturing process 
at all, just substitute brown glass stock for clear.  I believe 
that brown glass is cheaper anyway. 
 
     Many HBDs ago, I remember one person who ran 
across some cobalt blue carboys.  Now this is a brewing 
vessel, aesthetic and practical.  I think that pharmaceuticals 
were originally stored in cobalt glass to cut down on 
degradation due to long wave light. 
 
     How about simply painting a carboy black, or some 
other designer color to match your decor.  This may 
cause some problems in cleaning as you won't be able 
to see it as well. 
 
1.  Does anybody know where to go to get a funky colored 
carboy? 
 
2.  Has anyone painted their carboy?  What problems did 
this cause?

Subject: Mr. Wizzard


Hope this isn't a waste of bandwidth, but I have seen a couple of "Mr. 
Wizzard" shows on TV, that may be useful to homebrewers. 
 
Experiment 1 was the creation of carbon-dioxide using vinegar and 
baking-soda. 
 
Experiment 2 was using red cabbage juice as a universal indicater. 
 
For experiment 1, he used a fish aquarium with several lit candles at 
various hights and had vineger on the bottom.  As the baking-soda was 
sprinkled on to the vineger, carbon-dioxide was produced and extinguished 
the candles all the way to the top. 
 
So if you want to store hops in a jar loaded with carbon-dioxide, you 
could "dunk" your jar into the tank. 
 
For experiment 2, he used red cabbage juice to determine if a liguid 
was a base or a acid.  When mixed with grapefruit juice it turned 
pinkish-red (acid) and when mixed with ammonia, it turned blue-green (base). 
 
What was really interesting was the differance there was between tap 
water and distilled water.  The distilled water changed very very little, 
where the tap water turned green. 
 
I have not tried any of these experiments myself, just passing on what I 
observed. YMMV.

Well, I've mashed in both ways.  I like adding the water first, except 
that it is a little more difficult, because my false bottom likes to 
float up.  So I've got to hold it down with a paddle while pouring in 
the grain.  This takes three hande, however, I've only got two, so it's 
a little more effort.

Dear Greg, Heath, and Mike, 
 
Though I'm not much more than a newbie myself, please allow me to welcome 
you to the HBD.  You'll find a wealth of information here and folks eager 
to give you help and advice. 
 
Mike says: 
 
>Hello,  I am new to this list and homebrewing.  Please bear with my 
>ignorance.. Could someone please post a simple recipe for homebrew 
>beer for the virgin beer maker???  Thanks Mike Bernardoni 
 
There are several good sources for this kind of information on the net. 
Let me suggest a couple; if you don't have web access, email me and I'll 
grab these and email them to you.  The first is the better of the two, 
IMHO. 
 
http://www.primenet.com/~johnj/Howtobrew.html 
http://www.aob.org/aob/brew.html 
 
Two things I would suggest: (i) the document from www.aob.org recommends 
using hopped extract and (ii) both documents recommend using dry ale 
yeast.  While I suppose that there's nothing wrong with either of these 
recommendations for your first batch, I'd very strongly recommend moving 
to liquid yeast and unhopped extract either between your first and second 
batch or just staring with them.  You'll get a much better flavor (and 
much more control) using hops on your own, rather than using the hopped 
extracts.  As for the liquid yeast, just buy a pack of Wyeast (their 
American Ale Yeast #1056 is readily available and is forgiving on its 
preferred temperature range) and follow the instructions on the packet. 
You will soon want to begin making a yeast starter (see The Brewery, 
mentioned below, for some good how-to articles), but for your first 
batch, pitching your yeast straight out the pack will work fine. 
Finally, avoid adding _any_ sugar to your brew, except for 3/4 cup of 
corn sugar for priming just before bottling.  You can later experiment 
with sugars, mainly dark sugars like brown sugar and molasses, if you 
like, but don't start that way.  White sugar, whether corn, cane, or milk 
- - does nothing but make your brew taste thinner and adds alcohol, cane 
sugar can add a 'cidery' flavor if misused, especially in combination 
with low yeast pitch rates, which is what you'll be doing until you begin 
to use yeast starters. 
 
After those introduction documents, you can either go buy a few books or 
search out information on the net; I did both.  The best beginner's books 
available are, IMHO: 
 
The Complete Handbook of Homebrewing by Dave Miller 
The New Complete Joy of Homebrewing by Charlie Papazian 
 
Note that the title of the Miller book can be easily confused with some 
of his other books; this is the one you want, not the others.  Miller is 
extremely detailed, technical, and opinionated; Papazian is simple, 
friendly, and a bit oversimple.  Both contain errors which some would 
find critical, others would just blow off. 
 
If you've not found it already, IMHO the single best site on the net for 
homebrewing information is The Brewery.  It's depth and width of 
information is simply incredible.  It's at: 
 
http://alpha.rollanet.org/ 
 
The HBD archives are probably the second best source of information.  By 
ftp, they're at: 
 
ftp://ftp.stanford.edu/pub/clubs/homebrew/beer/digests 
 
and a search engine for them is available at: 
 
http://nemesis.engin.umich.edu:8080/cgi-bin/dothread 
 
The next best is harder to pick, but it's probably the Real Beer Page, 
though it's not exclusively homebrewing, there's still plenty of 
information there that will help you: 
 
http://realbeer.com/rbp/rbp.html 
 
Though both The Brewery and The Real Beer Page have link pages which will 
eventually take you just about anywhere that brewing information exists, 
I think that the SKOTRATS page is one of the more discerning lists.  The 
SKOTRATS site also has many other useful features you can check out.  It 
can be found at: 
 
http://miso.wwa.com/~skotrat/ 
 
Finally, some other random homebrewing sites which I have found to be 
useful: 
 
http://www.orcalink.com/~curator/beerjump.htm 
http://www.tezcat.com/~sstrong/madbrewers/links.html 
http://realbeer.com/hops/ 
http://pekkel.uthscsa.edu/beer/brewpub/texas/dallas.html 
http://206.159.0.13/cocks/ 
http://realbeer.com/spencer/ 
http://www.aa.net/~flip/beer/beer.html 
http://members.aol.com/kennyeddy/index.html 
http://oeonline.com/~pbabcock/brew.html 
 
Another source similar to HBD are the newsgroups rec.crafts.brewing and 
rec.food.drink.beer, especially the former. 
 
Have fun! 
 
Nazdrowie, 
Dave 
 
P.S.  Greg, I'm not ignoring your questions, I just don't know the 
answers.  The solution to your temperature problem may not be a different 
yeast (you should try liquid yeast anyway), but lowering your 
temperature.  The spare bathroom I use for a ferment room never gets 
below 78-80F during the summer, but I just stand my fermenter in a pan of 
water and drape a soaked towel around the fermenter, dangling it into the 
water.  Evaporation alone drops the brew temperature to about 70F; I 
could drop it another 5-6 degrees I suspect if I put a fan on it (I'd use 
a timer to keep it from drying out the towel); finally, if I wanted it 
even cooler, I'd put a block of ice on top, frozen in a 1 gal milk jug 
and wrapped with a towel or two to keep it from melting too fast.  If I 
was using a glass carboy (I use plastic buckets), I'd freeze a ring of 
ice in a ring cake pan so it would stay on the top better.  For other 
suggestions, see the article 'Cool Summer Brewing' at: 
 
http://byo.com/Back/summer.html 
 
and Ken Schwartz's incredibly ingenious plans for a icebox cooler at: 
 
http://members.aol.com/kennyeddy/index.html 
 
already mentioned above.

I think you have every right to expect knowledgable people on a brewery 
tour. 
 
Living in England, as I do, I am blessed with a multitude of breweries. 
Early this month, I had a tour round the Guinness brewery at Park Royal 
in London. The three hour tour was hosted by two ex-employees. 
 
One had been involved in the brewing side of things for over 30 years, 
and remembered when brewing was an artform, not a science. He remembers 
manual steam valves, shoveling malt (they malted their own barley then), 
The Day When The Malt Roaster Burnt Down (twice) etc...etc... 
 
Interesting and entertaining though his talk was, the important thing 
was he was also fully conversant with present day methods and could tell 
me what strike temp. they used now (169 degrees F), what their mash temp 
is (158 degrees F), and that they use 8% Black Malt, etc. 
 
Going round a brewery with someone who knows what they are talking about 
is not only nice, it is also essential!
