Subject: Hop Thanks


Thanks to all who replied privately to my hop question.  The overwhelming 
consensus was that the hops were OK, just a little immature.  Everyone 
recommended I just be patient, though some expressed concern that I 
should be harvesting ripe hops by now. 
 
Well, I checked the vines again on Saturday and felt like Gomer Pyle 
saying "Surprise, surprise!" (Snide Jim Nabors jokes NOT necessary).  The 
upper portions of the vines (8 feet +) are COVERED with gorgeous hop 
cones.  From what I've read on HBD and the advice of the respondents, I 
should be cheerfully harvesting ripe hops very soon!  Thanks again for 
the advice and sorry if I wasted your bandwidth.  Novices like me benefit 
greatly when answers are posted publicly after the advice is applied.

Subject: Carbonic maceration


Carbonic maceration is a wine making process where the grapes (along with 
stems, usually) are placed into a fermenter whole, and uncrushed.  Into 
this closed, stainless steel fermenter, carbon dioxide is pumped, while 
the oxygen is blown off.  This gives a completely oxygen free 
environment, which encourages fermentation to take place inside the 
grape.  This tends to give a smoother taste, yet has some drawbacks as 
well.  That is the process, basically. 
hope this helps

Subject: Building RIMS, need heater element info


I am in the final stages of building a RIMS system and need some 
information about electric heating elements and how to attach them to 
the heating unit.  The heating chamber is to be constructed of 1 1/2" 
copper pipe.  For the heat source, I was planning to use a standard 
4500W water-heater replacement element such as may be found at Home 
Depot.  The only units I saw mount with a ~3"" square flange and gasket 
with a hole in each corner. 
 
Has anyone used this type of element and if so, how did you mount it to 
the copper pipe (Read: is there an available copper fitting or did you 
have to manufacture something) ? 
 
Has anyone seen an element of this approximate wattage that has a 
standard NPT male thread mount? 
 
Thanks!

In-Reply-To: Questions that ought not be asked, need not be answered 
 
HBD Sucrosophytes: 
 
I recently found a source for Maple Sugar.  At ten dollars a pound, it looks 
like a reasonable substitute for maple syrup for brewing. 
 
Anybody got an idea as to the chemical breakdown of maple sugar (in terms of 
sucrose, maltose, dextrose, fructose, etc.)?  How 'bout how to substitute it 
for other sugars for priming?  Seems like that might be a good economical way 
infuse maple goodness into a brew without $30 worth of adjuncts.  My "don't 
analyze it- just DO it" technique would be priming 5 gallons with 1 cup.  I 
don't imagine maple sugar is going to be more fermentable than corn sugar. 
I suppose I could try to match the S.G. of 3/4 cup corn sugar disolved into 
1/2 quart of water with x cups maple sugar in water, but that'd be an 
expensive experiment. 
Also, what styles of beer should I use my 1 pound of "Special Roast" grain? 
(I saw it in the window, and just HAD to have it) 
Is this stuff made from malted grain or what?

Recently I came across some ball valves that were of mainly copper 
contruction with a stainless steel ball.  I noticed that the fitting at 
on end of the valve is made of brass.  I have seen some discourse on the 
subject of lead, so here goes: 
 
Can I use these valves in my RIMS or not? 
 
Will pickling them in a low-ph solution such as vinegar help reduce the 
chances of lead leaching into the wort? 
 
What are the approximate percentages of the metals in brass?  Does this 
vary; if so, how widely?

I brewed a few weeks ago in the full blazing July Texas sun.  I mashed in the 
sun, drained to the kettle through a clear vinyl tube, cooked in the sun, 
drained through a clear vinyl tube to my counterflow chiller through another 
clear vinyl tube to buckets, poured back and forth to aerate, and then to 
the fermenter.  All in the bright sunlight.  Later it hit me what I had 
done and I kicked myself (figuratively) for screwing up my beer. 
However, when the beer was finished I found nothing wrong with it.  If 
there is any skunkiness there, I can't detect it.  It tastes quite good 
to me.  It is an IPA (kind of) that I am drinking now and like a lot. 
I don't know that I would chance it again as it is easy to avoid, but the 
sun seems to have done no harm to this batch.  I don't think I would go to 
a lot of trouble to avoid the sun.  Some, perhaps, but not a lot.

Subject: Pub Crawling on the Web / powdered amylase in mash


Hello all! 
 
I found a web page recently that may be of interest to HBDers. 
Perhaps in response to all of the requests here for "I'm travelling 
to XXX city this weekend and need recommendations for brew pubs to 
visit", someone has created a searchable index of micros, brewpubs, 
and beer bars on the web.  You can use any combo of area code, zip 
code, address info, or even bar name to narrow your search.  Check it 
out at http://www.pubcrawler.com 
 
- ------------------------ 
 
Also, nobody responded to my recent question regarding the pros/cons 
of adding amylase in powdered form to my mash. I assume that it 
won't really make much difference on well modified malts with strong 
enzyme concentrations, but what about other grains such as wheat? 
Will it throw my enzyme concentrations (alpha VS beta) out of whack? 
I find it hard to beleive that nobody had an opinion on it, so I'm 
assuming it was missed during the HBD mailer problems a few weeks 
ago.  If anyone does have any thoughts on the matter, I'd love to 
hear them. TIA!

Subject: RIMS/HBRCP


Any RIMS brewers out there using Brew Crafts RIMS control unit and 
heating element? I have one of these and was wondering what kind 
of time frame it takes to boost mash temps. With a grain bill of 
15 lbs, and enough water to cover the bed a couple of inches, how 
long does it take to raise the mash temperature 1 degree F? This 
weekends' mash took 45 minutes to raise 5F (with the above specs). 
Is this typical? or is something amiss?

Subject: Won't You Wear My Ring Around Your Neck...


Oh wise collective, 
 
The $64,000 Question O' The Day is: 
 
"Is a ring around the neck of a bottle ALWAYS a bad sign?" (he asked 
infectiously) 
 
I've got an oatmeal stout that's been in bottles for about five months now. 
This past weekend, I finally got around to sticking some labels on the 
bottles that are left (a little more than half--I've been letting it age), 
and I 
noticed that every damn one of them has a ring of crud around the neck. 
Having never had such rings before in any of my beers, I immediately 
feared infection. 
 
The bottles we've already consumed did not have a ring, and they tasted 
fine; in fact, they tasted pretty darn good, IMHO as brewer. The few 
that are currently in the fridge don't have the ring, either. So...IMBR? 
I know the smell/taste test will determine the answer, but I'm wondering 
if the "Ring Of Crud" (wasn't that a Johnny Cash song?) is always a sign 
of infection, or if there are other explanations for it. 
 
Thanks in advance,

     Alex Banta asked about a nut brown ale recipe.  The following one 
     is a standard for me and was responsible for making my father a 
     beer drinker.  I've used different yeasts and different water, but 
     it always turns out pretty good. 
 
     Specialty grains steeped prior to boil: 
        3/4 # Cara-Munich Crystal 
        1/4 # Special B 
        1/8 # Chocolate Malt 
 
     Boil: 
        6.5 # Amber Malt Extract Syrup 
 
     Hops: 
        1 oz Brewers Gold - 60 min 
        1 oz Fuggle       -  5 min 
 
     Single stage fermentation between 65 and 72 Deg F (ie room temp) 
     for 1 to 2 weeks.  The original recipe (from Austin Homebrew 
     Supply) called for Whitbread dry yeast, but I've also used Windsor 
     & Nottingham dry and Wyeast 1098 & 1968 all with good results. 
     I've used tap water, bottled water, and softened water w/ water 
     crystals.  Occasionally I've used Irish Moss, but I don't think it 
     does anything.  OG 1.045 - 1.050.  FG 1.011 - 1.015.

>Could we have a little glossary lesson here? What's the difference between 
>roasting, toasting and kilning? 
 
As far as I know roasting and toasting are the same thing.  A "roaster" is 
what's used for making "toasted" malt (such as Victory or Biscuit) or 
"roasted" grains (such as chocolate malt, roasted barley or black patent 
malt).  Kilning is done in the kiln and is the process of drying the wet, 
"green malt."  If you kiln at relatively cool temps, you get pils or pale 
malt.  Kilning at higher temps for longer times you get Vienna or Munich 
malts.  Crystal malts are made by closing the vents and retaining the 
moisture for some period of time so that the grain actually converts in the 
husk.  The temperature and time of the subsequent drying (vents open) 
determines the colour of the crystal malt.  Roasting is done on dried 
(already kilned) malt and can be done at cooler temps for a short time 
(Victory, Biscuit), longer times and higher temps (Chocolate malt) or 
even higher temps (Roasted Barley or Black Patent malt... aka Roasted Malt).

In an experiment I performed, I found that Irish Moss used in the boil 
increases the rate at which yeast will flocculate -- more accurately, 
a 1 liter starter with no Irish Moss took 2 weeks to clear whereas a similar 
starter using the same yeast cleared in four days.  My thoughts are that 
the protein left in suspension interferes with the flocculation of the yeast. 
This has been mentioned in both DeClerck and Malting and Brewing Science: 
excess protein in the wort can interfere with nutrient uptake and flocculation.

Yes.  Adding grain to water increases starch balling.  All commercial 
breweries add water to grain or use what is known as a Steel's Masher 
which mixes malt and water and delivers it into the mash tun.

As soon as alpha acids are isomerized, they are subject to skunking the 
beer.  Keep the boil out of the sunlight.

London ESB is relatively un-attenuative and (in my opinion) IPAs should 
be on the dry side (not sweet).  I would recommend a different yeast, such 
as Wyeast #1028 London Ale.  "Cask-Conditioned" means only that the beer 
is live and that yeast in the cask caused the carbonation.  It has nothing 
to do with whether the beer was in a wooden or stainless steel cask. 
Furthermore, it has been posted here before many times that an oaky flavour 
in IPAs is a fallacy.  Well-used European oak casks were used for IPAs 
and these simply don't impart an oaky flavour.  Many casks were even 
coated with brewer's pitch!

That should be "savvy marketer."  Brown glass only helps *reduce* 
skunking.  Light of blue-green colour will skunk beer, not only UV, 
through a process called non-radiative energy transfer.   Brown glass 
reduces, but does not eliminate, blue-green light.

Milk sugar (lactose) is not fermentable and will not make your beer thinner. 
It will make it sweeter and thicker.  Not only cane, but beet and corn 
sugar will give your beer a cidery flavour if overused.

A P.P.S. to my last post: 
 
I missed a couple of sites which are too good to be missed.  You're 
eventually going to want to think about different beer styles.  The four 
I use the most (the 5th is in Charlie Papazian's book, the Homebrewing 
Companion) are Tim Dawson's at 
 
http://www.mv.com/ipusers/strange/styles.html 
 
the American Homebrewer Association's at 
 
http://www.aob.org/aob/styles.html 
 
and the New England Homebrew Competition's which, though not official, is 
almost the only guide with a link to it on the Beer Judge Certification 
Program's homepage 
 
http://www.rsi.com/wort/style-guide.html 
 
I said almost, because the Beer Judge Certification Exam Study Guide by 
Greg Walz on that same page has a style guide in it, too, that's pretty 
good; it's at 
 
http://oeonline.com/~pbabcock/bjcp.html 
 
and has quite a bit of other good information in it, too. 
 
Finally, I neglected to mention that The Brewery is the home of Cat's 
Meow III, which is one of the more comprehensive recipe collections 
around, though you should realize that some of these are untested and 
others are failed recipes.  The text is usually explicit about these 
issues, however.  Cat's Meow III incorporates the earler Cat's Meow II, 
btw.

Subject: re-using yeast, refrig&freezer storage


To the collective: 
 
Since several brewers have responded to my freezing yeast post (HBD # 2138 ) 
I thought I'd put this together for everyone to share.  I too could not find 
much info regarding this, so I had to develop my own methodology based on 
my micro and cell biology background. 
 
Starter stock DME solution: 
I typically make up a 15% stock (wt/vol) boiled, cooled DME mixture in filtered
tap water for starter and freezing purposes (we have hard water, I would add 
1/4 tsp gypsum/gal if using distilled).  Yeast like some calcium, but there 
is probably some in the DME anyway. 
 
I dilute this no more than 1:1 (>7.5% wt/vol) with about an equal volume of 
yeast slurry/trub from my fermentor.  You can also pitch rehydrated dry yeast 
into this.  The yeast should be able to handle 7.5 - 15% DME with no problem. 
Specific gravity of this 15% stock solution is ~ 1.060. 
 
Freezing; 
Months ago I started freezing small amounts of yeast suspensions to free up 
some space and to test for survival under those conditions.  So far so good. 
For freezing, I let the pitched starter go for a couple of days to be sure 
the yeast is active, then take aliquots out and mix them with an equal 
volume of fresh starter stock.  I just put the sealed tubes in the freezer. 
(eg: 7.5 ml of active yeast swirled suspension to 7.5 ml of 
fresh sterile stater in a sterile 15 ml screw-capped polypropylene tube) 
Sterile tubes are available by mail order from a number of biotech suppliers. 
 
I've considered using glycerol as a cryoprotectant but figure the yeasts 
probably prefer an environment that's relatively easy to start feeding on 
after their cold sleep.  It may not make a lot of difference in 
viability though, but I haven't made a comparison.  Glycerol, sucrose and 
dimethylsulfoxide(DMSO) are used to freeze and store mammalian cells in 
liquid nitrogen.  I would not recommend DMSO for brewing purposes. 
Any sugar solution will be slightly hypertonic and draw 
water out of the cells thus reducing ice crystal damage inside.  For freezing 
the presence of sugars, proteins and ions in DME are helpful. 
 
I ONLY add DME if I'm going to freeze the culture. 
 
Refrigerator storage: 
I don't think it's wise to give the yeast any more food if I'm going 
to store the culture in the refrig.  Even when the yeast have 
exhausted their food supply at the end of a ferment they still seem to be 
able to keep building up some CO2.  Maybe I've just been lucky, but I've never 
had any stored cultures explode under refrigeration (and I do have a rather 
large number stored there).  I think the key to storing refrigerated 
yeast is to be at the end of fermentation.  With no more food the yeast 
should shut down and sporulate. 
 
For recycling yeast I simply sanitize a funnel and a few extra bottles. 
After I'm finished bottling, I swirl the fermentor bucket and pour about 
6 oz of yeast/trub into each of several bottles and cap them. 
I try to chill them ASAP and keep them cold until I'm ready to use. 
 
When I open the refrigerated yeast/trub, I vent it slowly to determine 
whether or not there is a lot of pressure built up. 
If there is, you can see the stuff start to froth up in the bottle, if it 
does, I stop and keep it cold then vent more pressure until I can open it 
without wearing it.  (grolsch style bottles might be useful here, but 
I have been using crown capped ones)  Unfortunately, it's very subjective. 
 
My first attempts were rather graphic when I would just hold the bottle 
pointing into the bucket fermentor and "let her rip".  It pitched both the 
wort and half the kitchen.  Now I take my time and even try to make 
a fresh starter the day before I brew.  That way I can tell if the yeast is 
still viable. 
 
Regarding storage periods: 
I really don't know what the maximum storage time is for either refrigerated 
or frozen.  I expect it will be longer in the freezer.  Some of the yeasts 
I have isolated from imported beers have been in the original bottle for at 
least a year before I isolate them.  So, it appears that they are pretty 
well preserved, even without refrigeration. 
2-3 months in the refrigerator should be OK, make a fresh starter with it 
a day or two ahead of brew day.  Use ~10-15% boiled, cooled DME in water. 
I also believe you can just use the yeast sediment from a bottle of 
homebrew to make a starter (haven't tried it though).  I have slurries that 
are at least a year old stored in the refrigerator.  It is concievable that 
long term storage in the refrigerator my induce some mutations. 
No hard data though to verify this. 
 
Regarding washing the yeast: 
It sounds like it would be OK to do so and will probably give you a "cleaner" 
culture.  I've never attempted it myself.  Just be sure your rinse water 
is sterile. 
 
Flaming bottle and tube openings (optional): 
It may be overkill, but I always flame sterilize the openings of starter 
bottles, storage bottles and storage tubes whenever I open and close them. 
This is easily accomplished by passing the opening breifly through a 
propane torch flame after opening and before reclosing. 
 
Starter cultures: 
I just dump the stored slurry contents into the starter, after 
swirling it a bit to resuspend most of the slurry and flaming the opening. 
It's not important to get every last drop, you have a WHOLE LOT OF YEAST CELLS 
IN THERE. 
I typically add about 6oz of slurry to 2-3 pints of starter.  It may take 
up to 48 hrs to get going.  I usually cover the opening with a sterile 
gauze sponge cover and rubber band it in place for the forst 24 hours. 
Then I switch over to an airlock (it helps me see the bubbling).  Or you can 
pitch the slurry directly into your wort.  I only do a starter to check 
to see if the yeast is still OK. 
 
For reusing frozen yeast, I always make a starter to get the numbers up. 
I thaw the tube in a cup of warm water.  Dry off the outside and quickly 
flame the mouth of both the tube and the starter bottle.  Again, I allow about 
48 hrs before I plan to picth. 
 
I dump the entire starter into the primary after swirling to 
resuspend (sometimes I keep some back for freezer storage and add fresh 15% 
DME).   I also sample the active starter and do a cell count with a microscope 
counting chamber(hemocytometer).  Viability can be asessed by mixing the 
aliqout to be counted 1:1 with a vital stain such as 0.4% trypan blue solution.
 
I don't think there is enough of hops in the 6oz or so of slurry out of a 5 
gallon batch to alter subsequent hop requirements. 
 
Comments, opinions, suggestions and job offers are always welcome......

Subject: dark mash pH testing


collective homebrew conscience: 
 
when mashing dark beers, checking the pH is a pain in the rear for me, since 
my plastic pH strips pick up dark color from the mash.  this makes it very 
hard to judge what the real color of the strip should be. 
 
i use 3 color plastic strips made by baxter, and they work great for pale 
beers, but this dark beer thing really drives me crazy.  what's the solution?

I have never done that, since I brew in a dark basement where no light ever

Greetings! 
 
I just recently joined this list so I hope the question that I am about to 
pose is not dredging up a thread only recently put to rest! 
 
I was wondering if anyone out there has run across some type of listing, 
article, etc. or has personal knowledge of enzyme potentials for 
grains/seeds other than barley and wheat? It stands to reason that all 
seeds, to some degree, need to be able to convert starch into sugars as they 
begin growing; hence the malting process. Being in the mood to experiment, I 
was curious to what degree other grains could be malted, mashed, and made 
into "beer" without either using barley malt or the chew and spit process as 
an enzyme source. 
 
Thanks for your thoughts. My initial library research has turned up nothing 
(though the library wasn't very well stocked with brewing science entries!).

I just brewed an Octoberfest beer yesterday and got a lot of protein 
suspension. I used around 9 lbs of Pilsnet Malt & 1.5 lbs of assorted 
crystal malts. I mash in at 158F and sparged at 172F. I also used irish moss 
at the end of the boil. I've never really have had this problem before. Any 
suggestions on why this happened?

Subject: Colored Carboys?


 
Volume and supply and demand.  Who wants colored carboys other than 
perhaps homebrewers?  If that were the only demand, you'd pay a lot more 
than what you do.  As it is, we're leveraging other uses for the product 
of the glass industry.   A simpler trick than painting the carboy (how 
would you know you'd got it clean on the inside if you can't see inside?) 
is to cut a 1.5 inch hole in the bottom of a grocery bag and invert over 
the carboy.  Works like a champ.
