Subject: Overnight mash


A friend and I tried an overnight mash for a stout the other day, and so 
far things seem to be fine (mash was sweet after 10 hours, no off 
flavors).  We're going to try again with a more delicately flavored beer, 
but has anyone tried this before, and what were the results?  I'm 
concerned about astringent flavors and components that would contribute to 
a greater-than-normal amount of haze.  Thanks in advance...

Subject: A summer wine question...


Sorry about this, but I am by nature a brewer, not a wine maker.  I am going 
to have a bumper crop of apples this year (after much hard work via my other 
hobby) as well as quite a few rasberries and blackberries.  Anyyone got any 
good and (I stress this) SIMPLE recipies for making wines from these fruits? 
I'm planning on trying a brew with a clotch of rasberries as well, but I'm 
not sure if I want to try my first true lager with them, so the fruit flavor 
will come through more than with a high temp ale.  Also, the apples are 
rather tart, so would this make a difference?  I know I should just brew it, 
but can I use apples in a brew, or is there something that I don't know 
about them? 
 
Thanks.

Botulinum bacteria will not be destroyed by boiling!  Botulinum spores 
become active in low-acid, oxygen-free conditions and produce a toxin that 
causes botulism poisoning which can be fatal.  Pressure cookers are used 
in home canning to reach a tempurature of 240F for that reason.  A high pH 
(2 - 3.5)  will also prevent botulinum spores from becoming active.

Subject: RE: Dishwasher Sanitation (Moore;HBD2146)


In HBD2146 Richard Moore asks if dishwasher sanitation is ok. Richard, I've 
been sanitizing in the dishwasher for 6 years now w/o any problem 
whatsoever. In fact, my bottle sanitation process is: shortly after emptying 
a bottle of brew, rinse all the yeast out with tap water, and place the 
bottle in the dishwasher. When the dishwasher is full of bottles, it is time 
to brew another batch. Place a capful of bleach into the dishwasher, and 
turn it on short cycle/air dry (no heat). When ready to bottle, open the 
dishwasher and bottle. You can clean the bottles even a week or two in 
advance, as long as you don't open the dishwasher prior to bottling. I've 
even filled bottles while still wet and warm from a cycle, and have *never* 
experienced infection problems. BTW, I no longer bother to sanitize my 
bottle caps (stopped about two years ago). They remain in a ziplock back 
until ready for use, and again, never have a problem.

Subject: water crystals/gypsum


I have what I think is a simple question. I recently got the ingredients for 
a pale ale at a local brew supply store. The ingredients called for gypsum 
amd the clerk gave me a bottle of what I assumed was gypsum, but I did not 
look closely at the time. When I got home I noticed the bottle only said 
"water crystals" on it. It is a fine white powder. Is this gypsum? 
 
Thanks.

Subject: Cocoa powder/amylase/ring around neck/protein in festbier


     Howdy All! 
 
     A question/comment about using cocoa powder:  Papazian said to use 
     cocoa powder instead of baker's chocolate if you are concerned with 
     oil slicks.  Having done the oil slick thing, I was concerned, so I 
     used the powder (8 ounces; 227 g). 
 
     Fermentation is cranking, but the krausen is VERY low.  What's the 
     deal?  Is it because of the cocoa or is it because I didn't do a 
     protein rest (Grain bill:  14 lb pale malt, 4 lb Munich, 2 lb roast 
     barley, 2 lb crystal, 1 lb chocolate malt, 1 lb flaked oats).  I 
     didn't think I'd need a protein rest to break down large proteins 
     because the bulk of the grain bill is (supposedly) well modified 
     English pale malt. 
     -------------------- 
     Keith asks for opinions about adding amylase to the mash.  I'd say 
     it's pointless (just my opinion).  He specifically mentions wheat malt 
     being a possible beneficiary of this.  Actually, wheat has plenty of 
     enzymatic potential.  You can brew 100% wheat beer if you use rice 
     hulls to set up a filter bed. 
 
     I've even made 100% Munich malt beer, and it converted just fine 
     without any fancy stuff! 
     --------------------- 
     Jeff asks if "Ring around the neck" is always a sign of infection. 
     No, it can be a sign that the beer was conditioned by krausening. 
     Otherwise, it probably is the signature of some microbial invader. 
     --------------------- 
     Karel has made a festbier and says that there is a lot of protein in 
     suspension.  Are you sure it's protein?  Is it still fermenting?  IS 
     it yeast, or starch, or infection... 
 
     If it is protein, it could be because you omitted a protein rest.  I'm 
     not sure how well modified your Pils malt was.  Some pros I've talked 
     with claim that ALL modern malts are so well modified that you don't 
     need a protein rest, but traditionally German Pils malt requires one. 
 
     Have Fun!

Subject: Mashing in


     Hello again! 
 
     Just wanted to throw in my $0.02 about mashing in.  I always add grain 
     to the water because it's a heck of a lot easier for me to stir it 
     that way! 
 
     I don't have any problems with "starch balling" because I add the 
     grain slowly (2-3 lb. per minute) while stirring constantly. 
 
     Also, I've been to some breweries where they mashed in this same way 
     (Brooklyn Brewery, for one, and maybe Deschutes.  Now that I think 
     about it, Deschutes may have been dumping water and grain in 
     simultaneously, I can't remember.  Anybody out there know?). 
 
     Al is correct that the grain is sometimes wet down while being 
     transferred to the mash tun (where the bulk of the mash water is 
     waiting), but I've never been to a brewery where the water is added to 
     the grain (that doesn't mean that they don't exist, I don't claim to 
     have been everywhere!) 
 
     Have Fun!

Subject: Kvass, cork vs. cap


A Ukrainian co-worker has talked me into brewing (?) up a batch of 
Kvass, and he assures me the recipe on Cats Meow is authentic: 
"Ingredients (for 10 bottles): 1 pound Dry Black Bread; 24 cups  Boiling 
Water; 1 1/2 pounds Sugar; 2 ounces  Fresh Compressed Yeast;  1/2 cup 
Sultanas (yellow seedless raisins).  Procedure: Put the bread into a 
large container and then add the boiling water. When the mixture is 
lukewarm squeeze the liquid from the bread very thoroughly, making sure 
that the bread itself does not come through because this clouds the 
drink. Add the sugar and yeast, mix, cover and leave for ten hours. Pour 
the drink into clean bottles, and three sultanas to each, put the corks 
and tie them down---then refrigerate immediately.  Comments: This recipe 
is from an old wine and spirits book I have at home. Kvass is very 
refreshing on a hot summer's day and is quickly made from black bread 
and yeast. It is quite like weak beer and is fermented and slightly 
alcoholic, but must be stored in the refrigerator using corks, not 
screw-in stoppers or else it will go on fermenting and blow. This, to 
me, looks very similar to the Sumerian recipe which Anchor Brewery of 
San Francisco recreated a couple of years ago." 
 
This line bothers me: "but must be stored in the refrigerator using 
corks, not screw-in stoppers or else it will go on fermenting and blow" 
- - can anyone explain the difference between using a cork and a cap? I 
plan on using normal brewers yeast instead of "Fresh Compressed Yeast", 
which I can't find (it is supposed to be the consistency of a butter 
stick). I'll assume "Sugar" means regular table sugar - any comments 
appreciated, private email welcome! Thanks in advance!

Keith Royster says: 
 
>someone has created a searchable index of micros, brewpubs, 
>and beer bars on the web...   at http://www.pubcrawler.com. 
 
I haven't tried that one yet, but a couple of weeks ago I used the Real Beer 
Page Brew Tour to put together an itinerary for Maine.  Unfortunately, I 
left the printout of 26 Maine micros and brewpubs in my briefcase at home 
along with the computer generated directions for getting from Boston to Bar 
Harbor. D-ooh!! 
 
Visited two of the smallest breweries I've ever been to.  Bar Harbor Brewing 
was a 5 bbl setup in the basement of a house.  They had a Brown Ale that won 
gold at that World Beer Championship last year, yummy.  The brewer is a 
reformed hophead and former homebrewer who now likes to get a little 
roastiness into all his brews.  Even the Peach ale was fairly dark.  For 
those who want to throw it in and brew for a living, it is possible.  He did 
mention something about 70 or so hour weeks though. 
 
The other place was Maine Coast Brewing which is a shotgun brewpub about the 
size of 3 or 4 office cubicles (I kid you not).  The 7 bbl? mash tun is in 
the barroom with the other vessels either out back or upstairs.  Sausage 
sandwiches and good beer.  Definitely different from the usual semi-upscale 
goat-cheese pizza and so-so beer places that are popping up all over. 
 
Which brings me to... 
 
Eugene Sonn asks about Alagash Brewing in Portland, ME. 
>Anyone in Upstate New York or 
>Massachusetts seen any in stores?  I believe they make Belgian Ales. 
 
Haven't seen it around the Albany area.  My Maine itinerary shows it as a 
brewpub.  Now that doesn't mean that they don't distribute, but I didn't see 
any in the stores in Bar Harbor either.  Granted that BH is a long way from 
Portland, but you CAN get there from here.  I wish I'd known about the 
Belgian thing though.  We stopped in Gritty McDuff's on the way home.  The 
stout was OK but we would have liked a Trappist Style Ale better. 
 
Sorry about the non-brewing bandwidth.

Subject: COPS vs. Homebrewers!  Watch Out!


I could hardly believe what I was seeing when I was flipping channels last 
night.  I think it was a sign, but my channel up button stopped working right 
during an episode of COPS (Either that or my finger stopped working! :) 
Anyway, I decided to sit and enjoy the gratuitous violence, when I saw a 
converted keg mash tun!  Imagine my surprise!  Of course the ignorant police 
officer called it a "still" as he took the lid off of it and looked in it! 
Right beside it was a rectangular cooler/lauter tun!  The police officer said 
it was a cooling device and that the "suspect" would use ice or dry ice for 
the cooling process!  By this time I was rolling on the ground! 
 
Then, they arrested the suspect and his wife (It was originally a domestic 
violence call, and it is interesting that they ended up arresting them both!). 
 Of course they also found fourteen small marijuana plants and a pair of brass 
knuckles (Oh no :o )  The next scene was the "shove the suspect in the car as 
he shouts expletives" scene.  Then the cop's voice came on and said that they 
were confiscating the "still", the marijuana, and the brass knuckles.  It 
showed them loading the mash tun into the back of a white Ford Bronco (I am 
not making this up!), and to top it all off, the camera panned in on a  copy 
of Papizian's _New Complete Joy of Hombrewing_!!!!!!!  I couldn't believe my 
eyes! 
 
Of course the next scene was the "cop driving in his car talking about the 
arrest" scene.  The officer says, "sure this guy was probably not hurting 
anyone in the short term, but the bad thing is that this stuff he was making 
could at the least make someone go blind.  At the worst, someone could have 
died!"   I was flabbergasted! 
 
Of course by this time, my glass was empty, and I had to go get another 
homebrew!

Subject: Pilot Plant, Summer Lightning


Hi all, 
    I've stumbled onto an incredible brewing opportunity.  A couple of the 
Food Science grad students at the New York Ag Experiment Station want to 
start brewing beer.  They're working on Brettanomyces in wines, and they 
thought it would be fun to make some pLambics with them.  They have a 
fairly extensive strain collection, but most of the isolates aren't 
characterized yet. 
    The BIG fun won't be playing with the Brett strains, but--now prepare 
your drool buckets--playing with the Food Science pilot plant!  Ha! It's 
stuff like this that makes being a grad in a go-no-place kinda field like 
Plant Pathology worthwhile!!  The pilot plant has all the industrial 
accouterments including: steam-jacketed kettles (from 10 to 500 gallons), 
polishing filters, various apparati for chilling juices, a bottling line, 
carbonation equipment, etc., and we get to play with it all!!  (insert 
picture of blissed-out Homer Simpson) 
    The only rub is that the equipment is set up for processing fruit and 
vegetable juices, making flours and pastes, etc. and not beer (well, not 
yet but the department is thinking about it).  There are no false bottoms 
for the kettles, and (oh god, not again!) they may not have any roller 
mills.  We've figured out a way to get around the false-bottom problem by 
using a screen from another piece of equipment used for separating the pulp 
from vegetable juice, but the mills... 
    THE BIG QUESTION:  has anyone out there in HBD-land used a hammer mill 
to crush grain?  Someone mentioned a few months back that Guinness uses 
hammer mills to crush their grain, so it should be possible.  I'd like to 
know what screen size gives a good crush without producing tons of flour 
and pulverizing the husks.  Food Science isn't paying for our test batch, 
so I'd rather not waste a lot of grain determining screen size and I don't 
want to use my Corona to grind 15 gallons-worth of grain. 
 
    The second question:  Has anyone out there tasted Dunce's Summer 
Lightning?  My wife and I had some in Salisbury and we really liked it.  As 
I recall, it had a really interesting honey-ish flavor that was 
complemented by a citrusy hop aftertaste.  I'm thinking of using a pretty 
standard Pale Ale malt bill but substituting 1 LB honey malt for some of

Al is, of course, correct.  I got carried away.

Incidentally, Al, on the toast vs. roast issue, what is the difference in 
_flavor_ between toasty and roasty?  How do those tastes compare to 
biscuity and caramel?  I'm not quite sure.  Can you chew the malts and 
tell the difference?

Another very important reason to add water to grains is that keeps the 
temperature always lower than the target, thus preserving enzymes from 
possible thermal damage.

I, personally, would say that "toasty" is a white bread crust flavour 
and thus synonymous with "biscuity."  On the other hand, "roasty," to me, 
would have a slightly burnt component, like black bread crust.  This is 
just semantics, however, and you know how difficult it is to put flavours 
into words.  The difference between "caramel" and the rest is easy. 
"Caramel" is (not surprisingly) the flavour of caramelized sugar (like 
a Slow-Poke candy or Kraft caramels) whereas the rest are toasted *starch*. 
 
Yes, you can certainly tell the difference between Pale Ale malt, Munich 
malt, Crystal malt and Biscuit malt.  An interesting comparison is to 
taste DeWolf-Cosyns Aromatic and Biscuit.  Both are 25 Lovibond, but are 
very different in flavour.  The Aromatic is a very dark Munich-type malt. 
It is kilned (starts out wet) at a very high temp for a long time and 
thus comes out tasting like a dark Munich malt.  The Biscuit is kilned 
normally till dry and then run through the roaster till it is 25 Lovibond. 
Biscuit malt comes out tasting (to me) like toasted bread/pastry.

I just happened to be working with the definition of Plato degrees and 
accidentally stumbled upon a copy of Ken's post.  Actually, there is one 
small difference between the definition and Ken's post. 
 
The Plato degree is defined on sucrose.  This difference is very minor, 
but significant.  So, by definition, 12P is 12 grams of sucrose added to 
enough water to make 100 grams of solution (i.e. 88 grams of water).  This 
will work with pounds too, if you want: 12 pounds of sucrose, 88 pounds of 
water gives you 100 pounds of 12P liquid.

You did not mention if this is a fridge you are controlling with an external 
thermostat. It sounds like you have a head pressure problem.  If the 
compressor has recently been running, and then shut off and restarted, then 
the motor does not have enough power to get started.  The head pressure from 
the recent running has built up to it's normal level, and if the power is 
now applied the pressure is still there. 
 
This may mean a weak motor, or more likely a long A.C. power run that is 
lossy and supplying low voltage to the fridge.  If you are cycling the 
fridge often, then that is causing the thermal cutout to activate.  When the 
head pressure finally reduces enough, then the motor is able to start and 
the fridge is happy.

Awh shucks, that's what happens to me - just the item I need or want is

at the bin of my item.  Bummer, happens all the time. 
 
That is what happened to you Jim.  Sure, there are as many heating elements

Yes. A 2:1 volume ratio of White Distilled Vinegar to Hydrogen Peroxide for 5 
minutes should do the trick. Look for a buttery gold color.

Yes, it varies. Depending on which the 25 brass alloys it could be versus which
of the 5 it probably is, the lead content will be in the range of 5-7%. Brass 
is an alloy of Copper, Zinc and Lead (for machinability).

Which sort of ignores the concept of foundation water.  It is not at all 
unusual, in either commercial or homebrew situations, to add grain to 
water when the water in question is keeping the grain from clogging the 
false bottom. 
 
In fact, I would suggest that foundation water is more or less essential 
to prevent stuck mashes.  The *rest* of the water, of course, can be 
added with or after the grain.

Subject: Aeration made easy


Something I forgot to include in my re-using yeast....post (HBD# 2151). 
 
I picked up an easy way to aerate sterile air into my worts and starters. 
Don Lynch at The Front Street Brewery, Wilmington, NC showed me an article 
in a brewing magazine (don't remember which). 
 
Basically, you get a small air pump (aquarium, or I use a battery powered 
bait aerater from K-Mart) attach an appropriate diameter hose ~24" long to it 
and feed it through a two holed lid.  I use a canning jar with two holes 
the size of my tubing drilled in the lid.  Let this first tube, from the pump, 
extend down to the bottom of the jar and put an air stone on it. Put Si or hot 
glue around the tube/lid hole to make it air tight.  Run another length 
~36" long from the lid to another airstone on the outside (this one goes 
into your wort), the inside end of the tube should only extend ~1/2" into 
the jar.  Glue this one in too. 
 
Fill the jar about 1/2 full with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). 
You can sanitize the airstone and hose that goes into the wort by soaking 
it in the peroxide (I usually suck some of the peroxide up into the 
stone a few times and blow it out again.) 
Now put the lid on tight so the inside airstone 
is in the peroxide.  Put the sanitized end into your wort and turn on the 
pump.  Ths gives you sterile oxygenated air.  If no bubbles appear then 
it may be too deeply submerged (depends on pump strength). 
I usually let it bubble for 5-10 minutes or until foam starts to crawl 
out of the vessel.

Subject: yeast starter problem?


I posted a couple weeks ago about doing a yeast starter in a carboy 3 or 4 
days prior to brewing and then just racking the wort into the carboy.  The 
first attempt worked great;  high krauesen within two days and I kegged it 
three days ago;  it is delicious! 
 
The second time I tried this yeast starter technique, it failed 
miserably...  I couldn't figure out what killed the fermentation. 
Everything went great on brew day.  I got a fine extraction rate, etc, etc, 
and the yeast in the carboy was sending bubbles through the airlock about 
once every five minutes.  I racked the wort, aerated like hell, and 
nothing, nothing, nothing.  I added yeast nutrient and energizer - nothing. 
I reroused - nothing.  I finally dumped the unfermented wort down the 
toilet after 5 days of nothing; not one single bubble on the surface of the 
wort;  the wort had actually fell clear by the third day.  NOTHING!!! 
 
Then a freind of mine pointed out a possible flaw in the 'yeast starter in 
the carboy' technique.  I don't know if this is the cause, but it certainly 
sounds like a good theory.  The yeast starter purged the carboy of oxygen, 
so when I racked the wort to the carboy it is possible that the headspace 
in the carboy was severely low in oxygen content.  Even after thoroughly 
shaking the carboy, precious little oxygen would have been dissolved in the 
wort, thus no fermentation. 
 
But, I already had a decent 1/4" of white yeast slurry in the bottom of the 
carboy when I racked, so what gives?  It should have fermented to some 
point, no?  The first attempt at this technique resulted in one of the 
fastest and cleanest fermentations I have ever had.  Any ideas on this 
theory?  I'm back to using 1/2 gallon jugs for yeast starters because 
pouring 5 gallons of wort down the toilet is sacrilegious.  I'll burn a 
chicken and dance naked around the tainted carboy tonight.
