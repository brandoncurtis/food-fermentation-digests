Subject: Malting, continued


Let me preface this post with a note that there exist many different 
types of malting systems and methods.  Also, while DeClerck is an 
excellent reference, there have been great strides made in malting 
technology since he lived and wrote.  Malting is every bit as complex 
and difficult as the most intensive all grain mash program. 
 
Al writes about malting: 
 
<As I said before, green malt (wet) is not put into the barrel roaster. 
<All malt is dried in the kiln and then can optionally go into the roaster. 
 
As I pointed out to Al in private email, this is factually incorrect. 
Caramel malts are made in a roasting drum from Green Malt.  Ill come 
back to this later so we can all understand it for good. 
 
<There are two parts to kilning: the "drying phase" and the "curing phase." 
<The temperature of the curing phase is what distinguishes Aromatic 
<(25 Lovibond) and Munich (usually about 8 Lovibond), but it's the drying 
<phase that distinguishes pale malts from "high-kilned" malts like Vienna, 
<Munich and Aromatic [DeClerk, p.182]. 
 
It is both phases of drying and curing that distinguish the various malts, 
the temperatures do differ from each malt type desired (as do the ramps). 
(I dont think we are disagree'ing here) 
 
<Interestingly, the temperature profile of Vienna malt kilning looks more 
<like Pilsner rather than Munich malt (from fig.79 on page 198 of DeClerck). 
 
Except the Vienna is allowed to climb to about 100C during curing.  This 
makes sense as the coloring stage comes last. 
 
<Aromatic malt is typically cured at 115F 
[Busch, personal communication]. 
 
An obvious typo, 115C. 
 
Caramel malt production: 
 
I have a description sheet from DeWolf Cosyns Maltings. It has a nice 
description of the process for different malts.  For caramel malts, 
and this includes the entire DC family, caraPils, caraVienne, caraMunich 
and Special B, the barley is steeped, germinated and then sent directly 
into the roasting drum: 
 
"These malts are processed from greenmalt, in order to obtain amino-acids 
and preformed sugars, to build melanoidins and reducing substances in 
a natural way.  Roasting in drums is the only method to liquefy and 
saacharify the starch of the grain at 70C, using completely steam saturated 
and recycled air. Only this process ensures a good cristalization and 
caramelization." 
 
"Although it is possible to produce certain specialty malts in a kiln, 
it is generally agreed that this technology is limited because the kilning 
temperature is maximum 120C.  In fact, given that the humidity factor 
cannot be completely controlled in a kiln and saccharification and 
caramelization are difficult to steer, this is why the production of 
caramel malts requires a roasting drum, in which the parameters 
(temperature and water steam recycling) - necessary for liquefaction and 
saccharification - are adjustable and homogenous." 
 
"The process used to obtain caramel malts consists in collecting green 
malt which has been specially malted and subjecting it, in an enclosed 
environment (roasting drum) to the successive phases of liquefaction, 
saccharification, caramelization, and cristalization." 
 
They go on to note that the key difference is the lack of a saccharification 
stage in other roasted malts. 
 
part two to follow.

Yes, perhaps the mills would be simpler with the soft shelled barley or 
maybe we wouldn't have to grind it at all.  But is that the 2-claw or 
6-claw variety?  ;-))

Subject: Fix on malts, 1992


And this is an excellent description from Dr. Fix: 
 
Date: Wed, 28 Oct 92 10:30:56 CST 
From: (George J Fix) 
Subject: Specialty malts 
 
Terminology for speciality malts has not been uniform, and this has 
lead to some inconsistencies in product names at various homebrew 
outlets. Debating the appropriateness of the terms used strikes me 
as neither interesting nor useful. I personally like the approach 
taken by Victor Reijs, i.e., describe the grain by the way it is 
actually made. In this regard, there appears to be two major categories: 
 
     Class 1 - Grains are roasted. 
     Class 2 - Grains are not roasted, but they are dried at a high 
               temperature in the kiln. 
 
 
In Class 1 there are three important subcategories: 
 
      1a - Unmalted barley is roasted. 
      1b - "White malt" is roasted. ( White malt is fully 
            germinated, but either has not been dried in a kiln or 
            only slightly so.) 
      1c - "Green malt" is roasted. (Green malt consists of 
            germinating barley.) 
 
During our visit to the UK this summer Laurie and I got to see several 
malting companies, and in particular H&B. The latter classified grains 
in category 1c as follows: 
 
           i - light carastan   13-17 L 
           ii - carastan        30-40 L 
           iii - crystal        70-80 L 
           iv - dark crystal    100-160 L 
 
The traditional categories for Class 2 are the following: 
 
          2a - Vienna 5-10 L 
          2b - Munich 10-20 L 
 
At the time Laurie and my book was written, the nonroasted malts (i.e., 
those in Class 2) that were available all came from high protein 6 row 
barley (typically Glenn or Morex in the US and Sonja in Germany). Thus, 
we were faced with a "garbage in, garbage out" syndrone. In particular, 
the results from a large number of competitions showed that English and/or 
German malts from Class 1c were preferred by a very wide margin. It is 
important to note that these malts come from top 2 row barley (Maris Otter 
and Archer in the UK, Triumph in Germany). Today the situation has 
dramaticallychanged with the color malts from Belgium. We are currently playing
around
with versions of our recipies where 2/3 of the color malts are replaced 
with the Belgium Cara-Vienna and 1/3 with Cara-Munich. This has given 
a Lovibond value (which is the same as SRM or ASBC color) in the range 7-9 L. 
Reversing the proportions is also of interest, and yields (at least for us) 
a color in the range 10-12 L. As noted in an earlier post, the color of the 
Cara-Munich from Belgium is well above the classical range cited above.

Subject: RE: Splitting Kegged Beer


 
IN HBD#2154 Gene asks about splitting keg beer into corny's. 
 
Hi Gene, 
 
Yes you can do it, and it's fairly easy.  Its the same as bottling with a CP 
filler.  Of course it's easy for me because my keg setup uses 1/4" flare 
fittings for all connections, making interchanging easy. 
 
First fill your receiving keg with CO2, vent the oxygen out a few times, and 
leave it with about 10-12 psi. You might want to go with 15. 
 
Now you need to make a "faucet" that connects the standard beer fitting from 
the
top of the tap, with hose to a black liquid fitting for your keg. Connect your 
keg to the keg and then place the disconnect on the liquid connection on your 
corny. You need to then vent the pressure as the corny fills up. I have a gauge
& valve that goes on my gas fitting, and as I let the beer go into the corny, I
vent off the excess CO2. 
 
Couple of important things: 
 
1. You may want to draw a few pints until the foaminess settles in the German 
keg.  Then transfer. 
 
2.  If you are not sure what PSI to use, try to measure what the German keg is 
requiring, (i.e. if your regulator closes at 14 psi.) Then add 3-5 psi for good
measure and use that as your guage pressure in the recieving corny. 
 
3. Since this particular set up has no shut off valve you have to be quick with
the disconnect, or plumb one into your transfer line. 
 
4. Fill level is tough to determine.  If you are using a room temp corny, you 
should be able to see the sweat (or pour some hot water down the side of the 
corny) and you can get a reading.  That said, you'd definitely get better 
results tranferring into a chilled empty corny. 
 
This may not be the best or most professional way, but it has worked for me 
many
times. I've also had a beer foam up like crazy on me, and had to drink it real 
quick. 
 
I used to fill 3 gal. kegs with Miller (my friends are not beer savvy, yet) for
our tailgates at Browns games.  Everybody walking by thought it was the 
greatest.  Of course that's no longer a concern :( 
 
Good luck!  BTW what kind of beer?

Michiganders 
 
Does anybody have a good source to buy kegs, in the Detriot or Ann Arbor 
area? 
 
I'm toying with the idea of doing all-grain and would like to know the 
cost of building a setup.

Subject: Spiced Ales & Real Ales


In HBD #2153, Chris DiIorio asks for a recipe for Cinnamon beer for the 
holidays... 
 
While I've never made a cinnamon beer, per se, I have used cinnamon and 
other spices in holiday and pumpkin ales.  I usually start with a pale ale 
leaning more toward malty than bitter, and at kegging or bottling time I add 
a spice extract that has been steeping while the ale was fermenting. 
 
The extract varies with what I'm making, but starts with 4 oz. of 80 proof 
vodka and whatever spices that I feel are appropriate including cinnamon, 
clove, nutmeg, coriander, ginger, orange zest, etc.  I shake it once a day 
for a couple of weeks and monitor its aroma, making adjustments as 
necessary.  When I'm happy with the balance, I filter out the solids by 
passing the extract through a coffee filter in a funnel.  The extract goes 
into the refrigerator until I'm ready to use it. 
 
The extract increases the alcoholic strength of the ale only slightly as you 
can see (assuming 4.5 US gallons of ale at 4% alcohol by volume): 
 
    (576)(.04) + (4)(.40) = (576 + 4)(x) 
    23.04 + 1.6 = 580x 
    24.64 = 580x 
    .0425 = x 
 
In this example, by a quarter of 1 percent.  Another advantage of this 
method is that you can experiment with small amounts of extract in a glass 
or bottle of ale before committing the entire amount and possibly overdoing 
it. 
 
I don't remember how much of what spices I used for my first such extract, 
but I do remember that I used the spices and amounts listed in my favorite 
pumpkin pie recipe.  The effect was exactly what I was looking for. 
 
Hope this helps. 
 
By the way, anyone else going to the Real Ale Festival in Chicago October 
4/5?  Check out http://www.mcs.net/~shamburg/cbs/raf.html for details.  I 
just returned from a couple of weeks in the UK.  The Great British Beer 
Festival was a blast.  I'm forever hooked on real ale - I even brought back 
a used beer engine that a Welsh pub owner bestowed upon me (that gurgle 
gurgle sound you hear is my yeast starter for Saturday's christening batch). 
 
Cheers!

Hi all: 
 
Is it just me or do we now get the luxury of seeing about 5% of the HBD 
posts show up more than once?  Could this be a quirk of the new list 
owner, or just an itchy <send key> finger? 
 
I've been wondering, as an extract plus specialty grain brewer who has 
been playing with single-pound Munich malt partial mashes, if I could get 
some of that oft-praised decoction flavors by doing a one-hour single 
temp mash, then boiling the whole thing for a while before sparging? 
Anyone tried this or know of a good reason why it won't work? 
 
Finally, on the "who oughtta pour the beer for ya" thread:  I seem to 
have the opportunity to get a beer from a savvy (and often hairy) beer 
aficionado all the time, what with clubs, brew buddys, etc.  Given the 
choice, I'll take the bimbo.  Just my $0.02.

I have what I think is a simple question. I recently got the ingredients for 
a pale ale at a local brew supply store. The ingredients called for gypsum 
amd the clerk gave me a bottle of what I assumed was gypsum, but I did not 
look closely at the time. When I got home I noticed the bottle only said 
"water crystals" on it. It is a fine white powder. Is this gypsum?

This is a great idea, John and I nominate you to take care of it.   ;) 
I'm sure the collective will be all too eager to criticize it once you work 
out the details and post them. 
 
Al K. writes about Ken writing about Ian talking about phenolic aromas: 
>the bulk of the yeast strains that we have available to us don't have

This seems like a over-generalization.  Many yeasts show increased phenolic 
production at high temps; without temperature control in a hot spell you 
could easily make adhesive bandage ale without an infection.   I would, 
however, expect a strong fusel alcohol contingent to go along with it in 
that case. 
 
But as Ian stated in his original post: 
        "..the flavor dissipates after 10 minutes or so.." 
 
Are we positive this is due to phenolics?  I wouldn't expect the phenolic 
aroma to dissipate.  Could this be a citrusy character from the dry hopping 
that is volatilizing?  What hops did you use, Ian?

If the air-filter cured the problem, then infection is undoubtedly the 
source of the trouble. The band-aid odor sounds suspiciously like 
extra chlorine or chlorine-based products added to your water system 
(which is quite common in summer to keep  down algae and bacterial

it possible ?

You just knew I'd have something to say about this, didn't you? ;-{)} 
 
John Girard brought up a good point about recipes and water.  For the benefit 
of John and other folks who may have been absent from school when the topic 
was discussed here a few months ago, I'll re-advertize my BreWater utility 
program that can be used to experiment with water adjustments, and even has 
some information in the help file on general brewing water chemistry.  It 
also includes a couple dozen "canned" Classic Brewing Waters of the World 
profiles for reference.  It's a freeware program that you can download from 
my web page (URL below) or by direct ftp from: 
ftp://users.aol.com/kennyeddy/water/brewater.zip 
 
He goes on:

How many times have you seen a recipe that includes "1 tsp gypsum" in the 
ingredients?  Hey, if my water already has 150 ppm sulfate (and my tap water 
actually does!), I don't necessarily NEED or even WANT more!  But as John 
said, providing a complete analysis is a bit cumbersome as well. 
 
In my brewing, I've taken to using RO water and adding salts to get the 
profile I want.  This is really quite easy (with BreWater's help anyway) and 
I agree with John that the results speak for themselves.  It wouldn't be a 
bad thing to note on a recipe that "RO water with 2g CaCl2, 1.4g baking soda, 
0.25g chalk, and 0.5g epsom salt per 5 gal" was used.  For anyone interested 
in the ppm analysis, it's relatively easy to figure, even without software; 
for anyone who doesn't care, they can just ignore the extra line of the 
recipe; for those who care but don't want to do the math, the "recipe" is 
there in black and white, ppm's be damned.  Posting the actual water recipe 
is perhaps better than citing say "London Well" since interested brewers 
would have to duplicate a lot of tedious effort to synthesize the profile. 
 
A complication exists in that starting with tap water instead of "ion-free" 
water means a whole different approach is required -- if you don't have a 
reliable analysis of your tap water, you may as well forget it.  Even a vague 
idea of the relative "hardness" or "softness" or whether your water is "high 
sodium" or "low alkalinity" is useful information.

No concise article on grain varieties - but a lot of separate ones ... 
 
There are a couple of numbers in M&B Science that I don't have on hand 
at the moment. Wheat can be malted with a final diastatic (enzyme) 
power a bit greater than malted barley.  Rye malt is a bit lower than 
barley, with plenty of enzyme power to convert itself.  Al Korzonas, 
via private email related recently to me that Breiss rye malt runs 
around 95 degrees Lintner, while breiss 2-row pale barley malt was 
around 140 Lintner.  Triticale has been malted and has diastatic power 
greater than rye, and less than wheat - basically comparable with 
barley.  Triticale has also been used for test brewing by a USDA 
research center - in order to help promote the use of this grain in 
3rd world, poor quality soil environments.  It reportedly produces a 
good beer - and I wouldn't mind trying this malt myself.  Anyone have 
a source for triticale ? 
 
Sorghum(sp?)  is widely used for brewing beer in tropical climates 
such as parts of Africa - presumeably with good diastatic power.  I 
know that oats have been malted, but can't speak to the diastatic 
power.  Someone (David Burley?) commented on an attempt to malt oats 
in HBD fairly recently.  In colonial times (there is a brief reference 
in M&B science) americans malted corn (maize) !!! I have reason to 
suspect that malted corn has little alpha-amyase.  Rice has been 
experimentally malted, and has some unusual properties (can produce 
alpha-amylase in non-aerobic conditions!).  Again no diastatic power 
on rice. 
 
Farther afield - I've also seen references to malted peas (yes peas) 
which have a quite high diastatic power.  I can't imagine that they 
would make good beer tho'.  Sweet potatoes don't 'malt', but they are 
a very rich source of beta-amylase and have been used in amylolysis 
(mashing). 
 
Something you should understand about the enzyme content of malted 
grains.  One paper I have estimates that the amount of alpha and beta 
amylase enzyme in malted barley for brewing is about 500 times greater 
than is needed for barley plant growth!!  There are 'mutant' barley 
varieties which have much much lower enzyme potential than brewer's 
barley, but which have completely normal growth patterns.  Most barley 
varieties - even those not used for brewing have a large enzyme 
potential - say 30% to 100% as much as brewing barley. 
 
Why do some grain varieties have such high enzyme potential ?  No one 
knows for sure, but it is known that there are actually several 
'iso-enzyme' forms of each beta- and alpha-amyase. At least 5 BA types 
and 2 AA types appear in some brewing barleys, and it's not clear that 
all the isoenzymes have been identified.  It's also known that barley 
and other grains are capable of producing inhibitors that are specific 
to individual iso-enzymes. 
 
It is thought that grains evolved the large numbers and quantities of 
amylases and corresponding inhibitors in order to survive attacks from 
bacteria and or fungus.  It is suggested that when plants are attacked 
by bacterial or fungal starch consuming organisms, that specific 
inhibitors are released which block the amylases used by the attacking 
organism.  This inhibitor may also block one of the barley iso-enzymes 
and slow the others, but the plant can grow while the infecting 
organism dies.  This theory is unproven as far as I have read - but 
seems plausible. 
 
The point is that any random grain variety may not have sufficient 
enzyme potential to brew with; however a remarkably large number of 
varieties do seem have brewing potential.  It's quite likely that we 
have fungal and bacterial infections to thank for the evolution of 
grains for our highly enzymatic malts - so raise a glass to those 
barley bugs, but keep 'em out of the brewhouse. 
 
Steve Alexander 
 
p.s. I'll be on vacation till 9/5 so can't respond to posts or email 
  till then. 
 
p.p.s 
Regarding the chew & spit method. Raw grains have some beta-amylase, 
which can be substantially enhanced my mashing in papain proteolytic 
enzyme at around 50C for a while.  Barley and Wheat (and I suspect all 
grains) develop alpha-amyase as the seeds start to grow.  The release 
and activation of both AA and BA (if I recall correctly) can be 
enhanced by treating the seed with the plant hormone giberellin.  This 
is common practice in malting for brewing, except that traditional 
scotch distillers reject the hormone treatment procedure in malting 
their barley.  If you don't want to wait for the seed to sprout one 
traditional (and disgusting) practice uses alpha-amylase in human 
saliva.  Raw grain is chewed, the result is mashed over a long mash 
period.  Adds a whole new meaning to 'wet milling' eh ?

IMHO lactose (unless used very sparingly) could give a cloying character to the
sweetness of a fruit beer. Instead, I have dropped the mash temp to up the 
dextrins, and be careful with the attenuation of the yeast. This, to me, has 
provided the perfect sweetness and mouthfeel. The crystal would imply a certain
sweetness, but too much crystal character could in turn stand in the way of the
delicate fruit flavor(esp. peach,strawberry and blueberry), and not provide 
mouthfeel. Certain fruits blend with darker malts, such as raspberry (which 
makes excellent porter).I have added lactose when racking to secondary with 
good results. Speaking of lactose, any yummy milk stout recipes out there?

Subject: Free Hops & False Bottom Design


Hey Brewers 
 
RE Free Hops: 
 
A few years ago, a very cool homebrewer invited me over to pick, dry and 
take home some homegrown hops.  This was a very cool experience. for 
me..  I would like to extend a similar invitation to a fellow homebrewer.  If 
you are a homebrewer and would like to pick some killer hops, email me 
soon. 
 
I planted 2 Perle and 2 Cascade rhysomes 2 years ago.  Last year I got a 
pretty good crop, but this year it is enourmous!  I have plenty to share.  I 
am thinking of taking out 2 mounds next year.  Perhaps you would like a 
cut of my rhysomes so you can grow your own.  Perhaps you would like to 
share some homebrew, recipes and yeast or what ever durring an awsome 
day of 
picking hops and drinking some really good pale ale. 
 
 
A false bottom question: 
 
Currently, I am using 3 converted 15 gallon kegs in my brewery.  Each keg 
has an Easy Masher type spigot installed on them and I am wanting to hook 
up a pump to help keep stable temps in the mash.  I would appreciate some 
advice on false bottom design. 
 
1. In using a recirculating type system (RIMS), is an Easy Masher setup able 
to produce good results?  Is a copper tube around the bottom (with hack 
saw slits) better?  Or is a false bottom the only real choice? 
 
I really like my setup but I scorch the bottom when going from a protein 
rest to sac rest, to mash out.  I also scorch the bottom in my boiler--it is a 
problem. 
 
2. I am thinking that a false bottom is goint to be the best route to go. 
What is the optimal size of the false bottom (9, 10, 12 inch) and what is the 
optimal spacing/size of the wholes?  the false bottom will be made of SS. 
 
3. If I choose to go with a false bottom for both the boiler and the mash 
tun, is scorching a problem when doughing in and boiling? 
 
Thanks for any practical advice!.  The HBD is the best resource for 
homebrewers!!!

Jeff asked in HBD #2151 
 
h>"Is a ring around the neck of a bottle ALWAYS a bad sign?" (he asked 
h>infectiously) 
 
The best I can answer this is that "I don't think so." I have had a 
number of brews with some sort of ring around the neck but the beer the 
beer tasted fine when I started drinking that particular batch and even 
better at the last bottle. So my conclusion has been that it isn't an 
infection. I'm guessing but I think it maybe some left over break 
material that won't settle. 
 
Something that I have done with some success is to swirl the bottle to 
stir up what has deposited on the neck (doesn't always do it) and then 
let the bottles continue to condition. This stirred up material seems to 
always settle and doesn't end up in my glass. 
 
Bottomline...taste it and you'll have your answer. 
 
This is only my guess on the situation and I defer to the greater

Take the outlet of the airpump. Connect it to a small piece of soft

the copper to the plastic pipe again. Let the air go into the wort. 
If it is too hot let it go through another copper pipe in ice water. 
 
Do you guys think it will work ? Is it too much of an hassle ?
