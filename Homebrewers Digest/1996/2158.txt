Steve Alexander asks:

It is a 3 volume set *edited* by J. Pollock. Each volume would cost around 
$150 (the IOB sells each for 119 pounds!). It is a great series. I do 
not own it, but borrow it from the library occasionally. It is probably 
better than Hough overall, but you'd have to be *incredibly* keen to buy 
the set.

The IOB publish a series of "Blue Books" (vols 1 - 4; 4 is on 
engineering) which are designed as a study guide for people intending 
to sit the exam for Associate Membership of the IOB. Even this exam 
is a very tough one. The Master Brewer's exam is much harder and is 
designed for brewsters who have completed postgraduate studies in 
brewing. The Blue books are quite poorly written, and not very 
comprehensive (ie. Hough is much better). The IOB are currently rewriting 
the series which is due for release very soon. (the blue books have the 
title Steve mentions). 
 
The IOB are an international organisation (not just British), with 
sections worldwide. There is a North American section, Asia/Pacific 
section etc. 
 
>Other books ?  "Malting and Brewing Science" is well known with a

You're much better off reading journals such as, the Journal of the 
Institute of Brewing, Brauwelt, Technical Quarterly of the Master 
Brewers Association of the Americas, and Journal of the American Society 
of Brewing Chemists. Find a library that has them (any university with 
a Food Technology undergraduate course should have a sprinkling of these). 
 
Recent brewing textbooks include: 
Handbook of Brewing by W. Hardwick 1994. 
Brewing, by MJ. Lewis 1995. 
The Biotechnology of Malting and Brewing, J. Hough 1985 
Brewing Microbiology, FG Priest 1995. 
Fermented Beverage Production, A Lea, 1994.

Subject: discarding trub


  Beeroids, 
 
  I routinely discard my spent grain after sparging into my compost 
  pile (I haven't gotten that bread thing down yet).  On my last batch 
  in late Spring (yes, I'm one of those who doesn't brew in the 
  summer), I added the trub from the primary fermentation into the 
  compost pile as well - which I usually don't do as I reuse it or 
  flush down the drain.  ANYWAYS.... 
 
  I think it killed my compost pile.  I've worked most of the summer 
  trying to revive the vile smelling pile of rot.  Can the yeast 
  overcome the compost bacteria that well?  IS MY COMPOST PILE RUINED?

I checked what the guy told me. They use a one step mash process at 70C 
(158F) for two hours, after striking at 76C. 
 
I have no reason to doubt the guy, after all, he had been a Guinness 
Brewer for 30 years or so. And he wasn't vague when I asked him the 
mashing temp - he was very precise about it. It is possible that their 
yeast strain plays a part in the final flavouring and dryness, but I 
couldn't get a sample :(

Could it also be related to the strain of yeast used? 
 
Two recent batches I've made with Wyeast #1028 (London Ale) have had a barely 
visible layer of scum floating in the bottles, accompanied by a fine ring in 
the neck. As you say, agitiating the bottles seems to cause most of this 
material to settle. Neither batch shows any other signs of infection (they 
smell and taste OK). 
 
Other than the time I brewed with baker's chocolate (and I'm pretty sure I 
understand what happened with *that* batch), these two are the only batches 
where I've noticed bottle rings. They also happen to be the only batches I've 
used #1028 on.

Subject: Guiness III


Hi world! And to you Tom! 
 
Well, in the past years I have made a batch now and then to have some 
refreshments in the fridge. It was in Oslo, but then I had to move further 
north to Trondheim in March - a job (of course, what did you think it was). 
Finally I have gotten myself an apartment with a cool cellar and everything, so
now I'm back in the business: Brewing here I comes! 
The first batch is a stout, called Guiness III (it's the third Guiness you 
see).
I simply took about 5kg (10 lb) of Pale Malt (Crushed), 0.5kg of Black Malt 
(partially crushed) and 0.5kg Flaked barley and mixed with 66C heated water. 
Then I threw in a handful of Chocolate (uncrushed) just to see what happened. 
Nothing happened (of course!) - it was black enough. After 1 1/4 hour of 
mashing, I turned the oven up and took out most of the grains when the 
temp.was around 85-90 C. 60grams (2 ounces) of flaked Fuggles hops were 
dumped into the 
pot as the Worth started boiling. After 30min. I poured the whole thing into 
my old grain sack as to filter out the stuff. The dark liquid went through 
and into the fermenter - sparged the grains with some more boiling water, 
and voila! I had 28l of 1.050 worth! It was then left to cool over the night, 
and in the morning, the yeast starter went in. And yes, I almost forgot, I 
also used 25ml of hop extract to adjust the bitterness. So, in the evening 
it was fermenting wildly, at around 20C. Yesterday the activity had dropped, so
I fastly measured FG to be around 1.020. A little high, but ok for a dark 
full-bodied stout. I tasted it - it was very good - malty taste, plenty of hop 
aroma with a dry finish of bitterness, just perfect actually. After 3 days 
of fermenting and no aging!! I wonder how it will be in a week; heavenly, 
no less I think! 
So this is just a tale of when everything went ok. As is usually does. 
Don't worry - take a homebrew!

Subject: Breweries in NC


Bill, 
 
I live in the Raleigh area and unfortunately there are not a lot of 
choices in this area...There is a place called Greenshields in 
downtown Raleigh that claims to be a brewpub, but their beer isn't all 
that good and it all tastes the same.  They are supposed to be a 
English style brewery, but having just come back from a week in 
London, they are no English brewery!!!  There is little pub/restaurant 
in Cary called The Fox and Hound that has good food and quite a 
selection of beers if you want to try that out..... 
 
I would highly recommend checking out the Carolina Brewery in Chapel 
Hill, about 25 minutes from Raleigh.  It is located on Franklin Street 
about 1/2 mile from the "downtown" area near UNC.  There is also a new 
brewpub in the center of town on Franklin St. as well, but I have not 
been nor do I know anyone who has. 
 
In Winston-Salem I am not too sure about....I know in Greensboro, 
about 30 minutes away, there is a place called The Spring Garden 
Brewery/Grill, try their Red Oak, which has some really good  beer and 
there are a few microbreweries around that make some really good beer 
as well that can be found in local restaurants...... 
 
Hope that helps...

Subject: I Wish Irish Moss Worked


All this talk about Irish Moss being useless at wort pH has me checking my 
dipstick for low brain fluid. 
 
All I know is that in seven all-grain batches, I've FTIM (forgotten the Irish 
Moss) twice and not FTIM five times.  Two of seven batches failed to clear 
beyond "hazy" prior to packaging, while five were crystal-clear within hours 
of going into the primary (I use a glass carboy so I can see what's goin' 
on).  Can you guess in which two of the seven I FTIM? 
 
I switched from flakes to powdered IM some time ago, and have seen a 
significant difference in effect.  Not so much in clearing effect (the flakes 
seemed to work OK), but in the appearance of the wort during the lag phase. 
 Some hours after the wort is in the carboy, soft cotton-candy-lookin' clouds 
of fluffy material form, leaving great-looking see-through wort behind.  Once 
fermentation starts in earnest, this all gets churned up, but settles out 
again after the yeast have excused themselves from the table. 
 
Another thing that's happenned twice now (including my present batch of Brown 
Bus Beer) is that this material forms, among other places, in a 
two-inch-thick layer on top of the wort.  Over several hours it "sinks" 
slowly, but hangs up about six inches below the surface.  What bothers me is 
that I see active fermentation *above* this "plug", while below, nothing. 
 Sure, I suppose sooner or later the yeast will make its way through the haze 
but I'm concerned that other bugs might take advantage of the uncompetitive 
situation to homestead in the lower 48 (ounces). 
 
When I pitch the yeast, the wort is still fairly homogenous in turbidity; 
however I don't stir it in but rather just dump it.  (I don't pitch while 
transferring from the boiler since in the summer I have difficulty getting 
the wort much below 85F, even with a prechiller.  I guess an ice-water 
recirculator should be next on the gadget list).  Seems the yeast slurry is 
not mixing well, and is perhaps even "floating" so that it gets caught 
between this plug and the surface (kinda hard to believe).  I end up having 
to sanitize the racking cane and gently stirring to break up the plug to 
allow the fermenting wort to combine with the rest down under. 
 
Anybody experience any of these things?  Is the apparent 100% correlation 
between clarity and IM all in my head?  Is the formation of cotton candy not 
so much an electrostatic effect as perhaps a simple mechanical effect due to 
the massive surface area of the powder vs flakes?  Should I stir my yeast 
starter into the wort rather than just dumping it (apparently so)?  Is the IM 
simply clearing out stuff that shouldn't be in there in the first place (am I 
mis-brewing)? 
 
Is my brain ruined?

Subject: HBD Archives


 
I would encourage everyone, particularly those new to the HBD, to take 
advantage of the HBD archives.  They are an incredible wealth of immediate 
information and a resource that should be exploited.  I believe that there 
are searchable HBD archive web sites, though someone else will have to 
post the URL.  I have all of the HBDs since 1988 and I can attest to their 
value.  Lots of topics have been discussed in 8 years.  Lots of topic have 
been repeatably discussed in 8 years.  For example, there is a great series 
of water recipe articles posted by A. J. deLange, though if you don't like 
to measure and calculate you may have some trouble with any water recipe -- 
not to mention with brewing itself. 
 
There is a lot there, and a complete list of subject lines can be very 
informative.  I will work on extracting all the subject lines and referencing 
the HBD number.  When this is available I will see if I can get it 
uploaded to the HBD archive site. 
 
Good brewing to all --

Subject: RE: Partial decoction


     Randy asks about doing a partial mash.  He wonders if he can boil the 
     entire mash after the saccharafication rest, lauter, and boil... 
 
     You shouldn't do this.  Part of the reason to decoct is to release 
     more starch from the grain that wasn't gelatinized at conversion 
     temperature.  If you lauter after boiling the grain, you will be 
     sending unconverted starch into your kettle, a bad thing.  An iodine 
     test at the end of the decoction boil will illustrate this quite 
     nicely.  In fact, an iodine test will show the presence of starch even 
     before the mash gets to boiling! 
 
     I would encourage you to try an all grain batch.  Heck, if you're 
     going through the bother of partial mashes, and are considering 
     decoctions as an option in your life, you may as well do a full mash! 
 
     It won't take much longer than a partial mash, you will have total 
     control over the product, you can start to do some really wacky and 
     complex mash schedules, and the beer will be great! 
 
     Have Fun!

Subject: Cinnamon Spiced Ale


In HBD#2153, Chis DiIorio was asking about a cinnamon spiced 
beer.  Several years ago, I made "Roastarama Deadline Delight" as 
listed in Papazian's "Joy of Homebrewing."  This is a dark extract 
ale that uses 20 ounces of Celestial Seasonings' Roastaroma Mocha 
Spiced Tea.  This is an herbal tea that contains roasted barley, 
chicory root, cinnamon, star anise and many other herbs/spices. 
 
The final product needs longer aging in the bottle before drinking. 
I remember opening it up after 4 weeks and being very dissappointed. 
So, I waited several more weeks and tasted it again -- very pleasing 
taste, brown head, not too powerful but very complex with all of the 
various spices.  This past winter, I wanted to make this beer again, 
but I could not find "Roastarama...".  I used a different tea called 
Harvest Spiced Tea; the firat ingredient is cinnamon.  I used the same 
Papazian recipe with the switch in tea flavors.  Again, with a little 
longer aging, I was really happy with this beer.  The cinnamon flavor 
and spicy aroma (the tea is steeped for several minutes at the end of 
the boil) are at the right proportions. 
 
Cheers, 
John Gibbons

Subject: Re: BreWater program


A reply to a question about MAC users concerning BreWater... 
 
Vincent: 
 
<< I read your post on HBD.  Is 
 ftp://users.aol.com/kennyeddy/water/brewater.zip for the Mac or PC?  If for 
 PC, would you know of a Mac equivalent or other programs?  Minneapolis city 
 water is my main obstacle....  >> 
 
A MAC??  Bummer, dude. 
 
The program is for PC's I'm afraid.  However, I have a suggestion for the 
Windows-impaired.  If you're any good with a spreadsheet, you can set one up 
to do the calculations. 
 
Download: 
 
ftp://users.aol.com/kennyeddy/water/wchemprm.txt    (I think that's the right 
filename!) 
 
This document contains a lot of info about water treatment (it's the basis 
for the HELP file in BreWater), and there's a table of the ppm contribution 
of each salt (per 1gram per gallon).  Your spreadsheet would consist of three 
sections.  The first would be eight cells of "fixed" data, one for the ppms 
of each ion (Ca, SO4, etc).  The next section would "variable" data for for 
each of the six salt additions (grams per gallon of gypsum, epsom salt, etc). 
 Finally, the third section would be eight cells of "results" ppm data for 
the treated water, which is the sum of the ions in "your" starting water PLUS 
the contributions of the ions form each salt.  Now it's a matter of "playing" 
with the salt quantities to get the "result" where you want it. 
 
For example, if "your" water's magnesium ppm is entered in cell A3 and epsom 
salt is entered in cell C1, the formula for the resulting magnesium 
concentration in cell E3 would be E3 = A3 + 26.1*C1 .  For other ions 
(calcium and carbonate, for example), it's possible that two or more salts 
can contribute, so modify the formulae accordingly.  You might also want to 
factor in the number of gallons; now E1 = A3 + 26.1*C1/B1  (B1 contains 
gallons, let's say). 
 
The target profiles in the BreWater ZIP file are simple text files.  The 
information in each *.prf file is as follows:  profile "name", followed by 
the ppm's of calcium, sulfate, magnesium, sodium. chloride, carbonate, 
hardness, and alkalinity.  The remaining data in the file are not important 
for this purpose.  You can then use these numbers as a "target" if you're 
trying to emulate a certain water.  Additionally, there are many references 
to "Classic Waters" on the 'net (The Brewery is a great place to start).  You 
can create a fourth section on the spreadsheet for this "fixed" data. 
 
Of course, the calculations can also be done by hand, but that limits the 
practicality of "playing" with the numbers to acheive your target. 
 
Hope this helps.

my understanding until i read this was that high mash temps (158F) favored 
alpha amylase and eliminated beta amylase more quickly, resulting in less 
complete breakdown of starch, and comparatively more dextrins in the wort 
as opposed to lower mash temps (150F) which let the beta work longer and 
result in a more complete breakdown and thus less dextrins. 
 
what am i missing here?  how does dropping the mash temperature increase the 
amount of dextrins in the wort?

Subject: bleach heresy?


A question for the collective: 
 
Does bleach promote growth of bacteria in beer? 
 
This may sound like a stupid question but let me tell you why I ask.  After 
having infections in my last two batches and trying to trace down my problem, 
I asked for assistance from a local hb store.  The proprietor stated that a 
problem may be that I sanitize with bleach.  He said that bleach may be too 
effective in killing bacteria and that it would continue killing my yeast even 
while my beer is in the fermenter (after I had rinsed)  He stated that you 
cannot rinse bleach off and that a residue remains long after which can 
promote off flavors and kill yeast.  (I found it interesting that I have 
always sanitized with bleach but only recently had infections, but he seemed 
nonplussed.)  His recommendation was to stay away from bleach altogether and 
use an iodine based cleaner.  (makes sense)

Subject: Heated Wyeast storage.


- -- [ From: tamu2000 * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] -- 
 
Earlier this week I mail-ordered some Wyeast packets for brewing this 
weekend.  Because of a terrible misunderstanding between me and the supplier 
, they sent them by ground transit (UPS).  This means that the yeast will be 
spending the weekend in some (non-airconditioned) UPS transit holding 
warehouse in northern Texas.  I know what the temp range for fermenting ale 
yeasts are, and that you SHOULD keep them refrigerated during storage, but 
what happens if you don't?  Do they go dormant (good thing) or do they 
mutate and or die (bad thing)?  Are they at all salvageable?  Is it one of 
those "learning experiences" your mother always told you of?  Should I use 
open fermenters and windows and hope for a Lambic reaction?  I insulted my 
own intelligence with this blunder and I need a way out.

Subject: My first lager


I would like to tap the extensive knowledge of the HBD for some advice on 
brewing my first lager. I'm an extract + specialty grains brewer with around 
10 batches (all ales) under my belt. 
 
I re-read TCJOHB last nite and all it says about lagering is that "it is 
aging" the beer. Nothing refering to temps or vessels. I read an article in 
BYO magazine about lagers and all references are to months of aging in a 
corny keg in a fridge or freezer (with temp control). I haven't the fridge 
or kegs and probably won't in the next couple of years. 
 
I ferment in my basement which depending on location, I can achieve temps 
between 58 and 80 F. I figure this range can get me going, but how much 
lower do I need to go to get a decent product? I have heard of some "tricks" 
like a pan of water with a towel for evaporation. Are there others? 
 
Can I use a carboy for the lagering? How about the 5L mini-kegs which I just 
started using? How long should I plan on lagering for? 
 
Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. TIA.

Kevin Kane asks about using an overnight mash and its effect on flavors of the 
more delicate beers. I believe the older ( not the oldest) British homebrewers 
started this with Bruheat boilers ( maybe Line?) At the  low T end of the 
saccharification it is possible you will get a thinner beer than if you used a 
saccharification time of an hour or so and normally don't have a good 
efficiency
of conversion. Although the fermentability ratio is normally strongly 
temperature dependent, the enzymes are longer lived at lower T's and O/N the 
beta Amylase will have the maximum chance to convert the various lwm starch 
polymers to fermentable sugars. Thus you might find a difference between the 
"normal" saccharification and the O/N saccharification because the O/N  would 
more efficiently convert the starch and dextrins. At the lower T's you stand a 
chance of contamination and a more acidic wort. It is a way to break up your 
brewing session, but you're not really saving much time that I can see. Why not
prepare your malt and grist and water ,if needed, the night before and brew and
boil the next day?

Guy Gregory asks about dial type thermometers and mashing.  Personally, I like 
mine, it is a Taylor thermometer I purchased at a food equipment store-about 
$15.  Its dial is about 1" in diameter.  I calibrated it at 32F and 212F and 
blends in between.  It was amazingly linear and acurate.  I like it because it 
can be adjusted.  I check it whenever I feel like it versus ice water and a 
health( non-anal) thermometer. very steady. It is not a good plan to drop any  
mechanical thermometer in a mash or wort.  I have sealed them up with silicone 
adhesive in the past.

Subject: Wild yeast infection/phenolic/medicinal taste


I requested info on the phenolic/medicinal taste in my beer. My thanks to Ken 
Schwartz, Al Korzonas, Kevin and others for responding. The concensus seems 
to be that either the fermentation temp exceeded 75 F (I think it may have) 
or that I got a wild yeast infection (WYI). How can I prevent getting a WYI 
in future when culturing yeast - does anyone know how to avoid this ? Also 
how can I confirm whether it is a WYI or just too high a fermentation temp ?

Subject: False bottoms/tubes


 
 
 XKCHRISTIAN`at`ccvax.fullerton.edu says: 
 
>Currently, I am using 3 converted 15 gallon kegs in my brewery.  Each keg 
has an Easy Masher type spigot installed on them and I am wanting to hook 
up a pump to help keep stable temps in the mash.  I would appreciate some 
advice on false bottom design. 
 
1. In using a recirculating type system (RIMS), is an Easy Masher setup able 
 
to produce good results?  Is a copper tube around the bottom (with hack 
saw slits) better?  Or is a false bottom the only real choice? 
 
I really like my setup but I scorch the bottom when going from a protein 
rest to sac rest, to mash out.  I also scorch the bottom in my boiler--it is 
a 
problem. < 
 
Hydraulically, you've got a choice.  The Easymasher (TM) basically is a 
rolled up false bottom, which has the hydraulic benefit of the drain itself 
being in intimate contact with the grain, thus requiring no "foundation 
water" or "pre-saturation".  It draws from a point source at the place the 
tube is attached to the screen, so it is essentially a point source drain. 
The false bottom is probably hydraulically the least efficient, as it 
doesn't take advantage of pressure relationships in overlying and 
surrounding saturated grain to move wort, but rather is another point source 
sink, which may draw preferentially from the grain-vessel boundary. 
 A manifold tube stuck into the middle as a drain is probably hydraulically 
most efficient, because it draws from each slot, rather than just the point 
of attachment.  A circular manifold is much worse, because it induces flow 
along the grain-vessel boundary, and not through the middle of the grain. 
 
Of course, false bottoms are easier to stir over than manifolds.  By far. 
 
All the above value judgements regarding "best" and "least" efficient are 
personal value judgements, and the actual efficiency difference between them 
is small. 
 
>2. I am thinking that a false bottom is goint to be the best route to go. 
What is the optimal size of the false bottom (9, 10, 12 inch).  the false 
bottom will be made of SS.< 
 
Optimal diameter is a matter of opinion.  I personally would minimize 
foundation water and maximize flow through grain (rather than flow along 
grain vessel boundary) by minimizing the area of the false bottom.  To see 
what the difference is, try a sensitivity analysis using the equation Q=KIA 
where Q is the discharge you will get, K=Hydraulic conductivity of grain 
(assuming barley, try 3 x 10E-2 cm/sec), I=Height of water column above 
false bottom, and A=Area of false bottom.  I haven't done it, but I think 
that can help you choose what diameter makes a difference. 
 
Optimal spacing of the holes is about 50% mean grain diameter, which is 
about 3/32 I think.  Someone else I believe knows better what grain size 
curves are like for optimally crushed barley. 
 
>3. If I choose to go with a false bottom for both the boiler and the mash 
tun, is scorching a problem when doughing in and boiling? < 
 
My experience is that scorching is an issue of over application of heat and 
not stirring enough.  Stir more.  Turn down your burner a bit, and I think 
the problem will go away.
