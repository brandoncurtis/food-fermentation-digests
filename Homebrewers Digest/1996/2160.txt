Subject: Bleach residues


Robert Ray asked about problems with his brew in regards to bleach.  Sure, 
iodophor is good stuff (especially for SS kegs), but bleach leaves 
virtually no residue.  Bleach is a solution of sodium hypochlorite, made 
by the reaction of chlorine gas and sodium hydroxide.  What remains after 
a sterilization with bleach are sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide. 
Using the amounts prescribed by a number of homebrew texts, these 
compounds are going to be in such low concentration that they won't affect 
flavor or wort pH, even if you don't rinse.  I've NEVER had spoiled beer 
from using bleach. 
 
Robert, I'd check elsewhere in your brewing steps.  If you're using a 
starter, make sure that everything in contact with it is sterile, and 
that your starter is viable before you pitch.  Also, check to see that you 
don't present an opportunity for bacteria to get to your wort before the 
yeast do.

Subject: Irish Moss


I noticed Ken's post on irish moss, and I felt compelled to reply in 
defense of IM.  I use it in all my beers.  Never have I had a problem. 
Nor have I ever observed anything close to what you gentleman have 
described.  There was a time when I didn't use it, and my beers were 
hazy.  Since I started using irish moss, I've noticed a great difference 
(night and day).  I not sure that what the othe person that responded to 
Ken's post said was right.  I don't know if it is correct to add irish 
moss half way through your boil, or after a rolling boil is established. 
I've been told to add it 15 minutes before the end of the boil, and have 
been doing so with excellent results.  If your boil is an hour say, the 
moss is in there an extra 15 mins. and maybe longer.  Whether or not this 
makes a difference, I have no idea. But hey its worth a try right?  The 
only way to improve the quality of any of your beers is to experiment. 
 
 
Thanks for taking the time to read my post, 
 
Aaron Sepanski 
 
 
P.S.  I also noticed that you said it takes you 15 mins. to get your beer 
to stop trying to boil over.  I do it in about a minute.  Let it rise up 
so you know that you have completely established a boil, then before it 
boils over, pull your kettle off the heat and let it sink back down.  You 
may need to do it twice, possibly three times, but it works.  Hope this 
helps, because boil overs suck (extremely difficult to clean).  Thanks guys.

Subject: Bleach for sanitizing


To respond to Robert's post....  I use bleach to sanitize as well.  I 
have been forever.  I have never had a problem at all.  I know that 
bleach can leave a film, you only have to pour a little on your hand to 
find that out.  Because of this, I make sure that rinse my carboy 
completely!  I rinse it out until I can't smell the bleach anymore, and 
then rinse 2 more times after that.  Furthermore, when I rinse, I never 
come close to filling my carboy with the rinse water.  I simply fill it 
about a quarter full and vigorously shake the water around in the 
carboy.  It would seem to me that it might be difficult to agitate 5 and 
6.5 gallons of water.  Isn't it heavy? or do you not agitate at all?  At 
any rate please don't feel as though what I'm saying is that you are in 
correct.  I'm sure your method is just as good a clearing the bleach.  I 
am merely suggesting a different method that might make life easier for 
you.  Good luck on your next batch all.

Subject: The mother of all root beer inquiries...


Greetings all! 
 
As somene interested in the homebrewing of root beer (particularly from 
all-natural ingredients or, at least, using those ingredients to greatly 
enhance the available extracts), I come to the homebrew list with a humble 
proposition: 
 
If you will either post to the list or to me privately any/all experiences, 
recipes, history or whatever that you have on the subject of home-made root 
beer, sarsaparilla, birch beer or whatnot, I will do my best to combine it 
with info I've already collected and produce a FAQ or proto-FAQ for 
everyone's review. I know this isn't the primary purpose of the list, but 
enough people in the homebrewing world seem to have an interest in this 
that I figured it'd be a good place to start digging. 
 
Any takers? :) 
 
Regards, 
Greg Brooks  (gbrooks`at`concentric.net)

Subject: bleach heresy?


Ray Robert asks: 
 
> Does bleach promote growth of bacteria in beer? 
 
I doubt it seriously!! 
 
What is happening to you maybe what happened to me a while back. 
I would pitch a good chunk of temperature normalized yeast 
slurry, and then....nothing.  Or in come cases, a very anemic 
fermentation slow to start.  Problem drove me up the wall. 
 
I was fermenting in 6 gallon carboys, and would keep a bleach 
solution in them between uses to keep the bugs down.  Then, 
when I was ready to use them, I would rinse them out with 
cold water, using three or four rinses. 
 
Well, after some expert help from this forum, I finally found 
what my problem was:  Bleach does not mix very well with cold water. 
It will leave a film on the glass.  I switched to rinsing with -hot- 
water and my problem went away. 
 
Prove it to yourself with this simple experiment.  Dip your fingers 
in some bleach.  Feel how they are slippery.  Now, rinse your fingers 
with -cold- water.  They will still be a little slippery.  Rinse again 
with -hot- water and notice the slippery surface goes away. 
 
So the rules are: If you are soaking with bleach, use -cold- water. 
The germ killing power will last longer.  However, if you are 
rinsing, use HOT water.

In #2157 XKCHRISTIAN`at`ccvax.fullerton.edu asked:

Since I'm going to provide a viewpoint of design issues, I need to answer the 
questions above explicitly, so there is no implicity answer assumed.  I've not 
used an Easy Masher for RIMS, or a copper tubing manifold so I don't know how 
well they work in the RIMS environment.  OTOH, I doubt a false bottom is the 
"only real choice".  Schmidling has claimed it's a total waste of time, and he 
has a point.  Read on. 
 
> 2. I am thinking that a false bottom is going to be the best route to go. 
> What is the optimal size of the false bottom (9, 10, 12 inch) and what is the
> optimal spacing/size of the wholes?  the false bottom will be made of SS. 
 
"Optimum" size depends on all your basic engineering factors. If you're 
building
it yourself from stainless, then the optimum from a cost/time perspective is 
infinitely small. If you only care about flow rate thru the plate, then optimum
is infinitely large (if you're using a real pot having finite diameter, then 
optimum would be pot diameter). 
 
> 3. If I choose to go with a false bottom for both the boiler and the mash 
> tun, is scorching a problem when doughing in and boiling? 
 
Since doughing-in is done at around 100F or so, scorching should be a 
non-issue.
During boiling, the wort is pretty much free to move around on its own, so I 
don't see how a false bottom would do too much to influence scorching. I never 
had a problem with scorching in the kettle with a false bottom.  Unless money 
is no object and you just insist on using whole leaf or plug hops, I don't see 
any advantage to a false bottom for the kettle--use pellets instead, or use a 
hop bag. 
 
In #2158 GuyG4`at`aol.com offers some advice on this issue: 
 
> The false bottom is probably hydraulically the least efficient, as it 
> doesn't take advantage of pressure relationships in overlying and 
> surrounding saturated grain to move wort, but rather is another point source 
> sink, which may draw preferentially from the grain-vessel boundary. 
 
I have no idea what is meant here by efficient, but I can see no way that a 
false bottom drains a at a point, nor why it there would be any preferential 
flow at it's periphery.  The comment here regarding pressure relationships 
is also kinda baffling--even during recirculation, I'd model the situation 
as more-or-less hydrostatic/quasi-static. Given the false bottom is reasonably 
far away from the real vessel bottom, and that the drain is in that real 
bottom, flow across the entire false bottom should be uniform and constant. 
 
> A manifold tube stuck into the middle as a drain is probably hydraulically 
> most efficient, because it draws from each slot, rather than just the point 
> of attachment.  A circular manifold is much worse, because it induces flow 
> along the grain-vessel boundary, and not through the middle of the grain. 
 
Again, I don't get it. I think the first statement implies that an Easy Masher 
experiences flow only into that portion of the screen very near the drain pipe,
and very little wort flows into the screen near the rolled-up end. But, it also
implies (to me) that flow thru a false bottom only occurs at some localized 
area.
 
It's intuitive that as the distance between the false bottom and the real 
bottom
goes to infinity, the flow across the false bottom becomes uniform.  As that 
distance approaches zero, the flow across the false bottom goes to zero except 
in the region where the false bottom is directly above the drain. 
 
The final comment regarding a circular manifold inducing flow at the periphery 
of
the vessel makes sense--if the manifold is at that periphery. What if the 
radius
r of the manifold is 2/3 the radius R of the vessel (or some other number)? 
 
> Of course, false bottoms are easier to stir over than manifolds.  By far. 
 
This statement is pretty significant--one of Schmidling's comments regarding 
the
coolness of the Easy Masher is that stirring is possible without making a mess 
of the wort.  All design issues need to be bounced against stirred vs static 
mashing. Some brewers think stirring is a Bad Thing, some think it's a Good 
Thing.
 
GuyG4 responds to question 2. regarding false bottom size with: 
 
> Optimal diameter is a matter of opinion.  I personally would minimize 
> foundation water and maximize flow through grain (rather than flow along 
> grain vessel boundary) by minimizing the area of the false bottom. 
 
Got another problem here, too. Clearly the smaller the false bottom the less 
the
flow thru the grain. As the false bottom diameter approaches zero, mustn't the 
flow approach zero? Imagine there is no 'real' vessel bottom to effect flow. If
the false bottom is exactly the diameter of the mash vessel, and the sides of 
that
vessel are perpendicular to the false bottom won't all mash flow be 
perpendicular
to the plate? And won't the flow at the center of the mash tun be identical to 
that at the periphery? 
 
Now imagine another design, a conical-bottom mash tun with the false bottom 
near
the bottom of that cone (minimize the false bottom size). Now, flow at the edge
of the tank is parallel to the conical tank wall, convergent at the false 
bottom.
Flow will by greatest at the center of the grain bed, and minimal at the edges,
but will certainly not be uniform. 
 
> Optimal spacing of the holes is about 50% mean grain diameter, which is 
> about 3/32 I think.  Someone else I believe knows better what grain size 
> curves are like for optimally crushed barley. 
 
I've used both 3/32" and 5/64".  Both work wonderfully.  Back to false bottom 
size though: if you're using a Sankey keg for the mash tun, then a large false 
bottom (about 14.5" diameter) provides a very nice balance between a large flow
area (and uniform flow) with an acceptably large volume under the false bottom 
to prevent scorching (about 3 quarts). 
 
Alternatively, an EM is probably going to be far less expensive that a false 
bottom, and is conducive to mash stirring (which, in my experience will improve
yield a lot). 
 
Finally, the issue of clear wort may come up. Use of a false bottom, no 
stirring,
and moderate recirculation will produce crystal clear wort into the kettle. Why
this is important escapes me, although it is very satisfying. I've not seen any
difference in finished product clarity either way, although I might miss chill 
haze others would notice since I drink cool ale, not cold.

I suspect the problem is not so much the yeast as the hops. 
Spent hops (trub from the kettle) are used as a defoliant in some places, 
since they have a good record of killing any other vegetation they're 
applied to. Sort of a natural herbicide. 
 
I'd recommend sticking only to spent grain. Compost piles love it.

This is in response to the post from Ray Robert as to using bleach 
for disinfection and the potential to killing yeast; I have been 
brewing for many years and always use bleach to disinfect 
everything that I use in the brewing and bottling process and have 
never had a problem with my yeast OR contamination.  If you use a 
SMALL amount of bleach and rinse well, you should have no problems. 
It does not take a large amount of bleach to disinfect.  If you do 
use too much bleach or fail to rinse, then you have have a problem 
with killing the yeast, in addition to killing yourself with the 
ingestion of bleach.  Use sparingly and rinse. 
 
Brew well and Brew often.

Subject: Hops Harvest Problems


 
Last night I went out to start harvesting my Centennial hops.  I noticed a 
half a dozen wasps and bees buzzing around.  A few stings wasn't gonna stop 
this brewer.  I climbed the ladder and was shocked to see the top 3 feet of 
the vine was really sticky and covered with little white things.  These 
things are about 0.1 inches long and 0.01 inches in diameter.  Close 
examination showed that they were not moving, however there were a large 
number of aphids on the leaves as well.  The wasps where eating the aphids. 
Good job wasps! (no affiliation just like the job their doing). When I 
picked them I put the ones that were wooly with the white things in  a 
separate sack.  I was thinking about dumping them in water to clean them but 
I think the stickiness will keep the white stuff on.  Right now I have them 
in my drying room.  They smell great much stronger that the non sticky 
cones.    What are these white things?  Are these cones ruined?   Is there 
something I can do to save them?  BTW I live in Colorado where the weather 
is very dry so I doubt its any kind of mold.

Subject: Bleach


Lots of recent talk about bleach and sanitation: 
1.  The vast majority of bleaches are NOT sodium hydroxide, they are sodium 
hypochlorite, i.e. chlorine bleach.  Chlorine bleach is fine as a 
sanitizer, but be sure to rinse, rinse, and then rinse, again!  BTW, this 
is what I use leftover Budmilloors that people bring to my house and don't 
consume - rinsing carboys!  After all, a beer with no flavor certainly 
isn't going to contribute an off flavor!  Personally, I favor iodophor for 
sanitation, but that's not the point. 
 
2.  BIG WARNING ON CLOROX!  Clorox has switched formulation and is no 
longer chlorine bleach, it is now using lye.  Sodium hydroxide is not 
recommended as a sanitizing agent.  Also, the high pH (strong alkalinity) 
may cause deposits of mineral complexes in your carboys that are not 
soluble at pHs above around 2.5.  These deposits shouldn't affect flavors, 
but might provide spaces for contaminates to hang out and cause problems. 
This is a good reasons to stick to low budget el-cheapo bleaches. 
 
3.  As far as the shop owner that claimed bleach was bad because in killed 
*all* the bacteria....  Just to make it clear:  bacteria in beer bad, yeast 
in beer good.  (lambic exclusion rule noted) 
 
4.  When the entire discussion started, Ray Roberts said he had always used 
bleach and had only recently started getting infections.  Got any old 
plastic parts, Ray?  A new racking cane might solve the problem - likewise 
for any other old plastic parts.

David Luegs <leud`at`calvin.edu> asks about drying hopping changing the rate of 
bubbles through his airlock: 
 
I have seen this phenomeneon before too.  The most likely explaination is that 
you have a solution (beer/wort) that is saturated with CO2.  By adding the 
hops to it, you provide a nucleation site (something physical for the bubbles 
to form on), so now some of the CO2 can and does come out of solution. 
The last pale ale that I dry hopped did this - but the higher rate of bubbling 
continued for almost a week! 
Be sure to use some type of strainer when you siphon your dry hopped beer into 
the bottling bucket or keg to keep the bits of hop out.  I (stupidly) 
neglected to do this on my last batch, and my pale ale has hop floaters :-O 
A muslin hop bag slipped over the end of the racking cane works very well; it 
just looks funny...

Subject: Brewing water


Good afternoon all, 
 
Why is it important to try to duplicate the water of the type of beer you 
are brewing, for example Burton water which has 1,200 ppm of total 
dissolved solids in its water. 
 
I read that Calcium is required in the brewing process yet the water of 
Pilsen has very little calcium and my water is very similar to Pilsen 
water and I have brewed many different styles of beer, that were to style 
or very close to style. All my batches have been all grain and I have had 
no difficulty in any way brewing many different styles. 
 
Lets go back to Burton water if the water is unadjusted how much of the 
solids precipitate out of the wort during the boil?  How much sulfate is 
required to give the hop character of a Burton pale ale? 
 
I have brewed bitter where I adjusted the water to Burton, added a small 
amount of gypsum to the mash for pH adjustment and adjusted the pH using 
lactic acid.  All the beer tasted about the same.  It would be hard to 
pick out which beer had the most sulfate.  Do we have to adjust our 
brewing water to achieve the style we want or can we do a good job of 
brewing by just getting the pH of the mash and the sparge water in the 
appropriate range?

actually, the rheinheitsgebot stipulated malz (malt), hopfen (hops), and 
wasser (water).  it did not specify barley as the only type of malt that was 
allowable.  therefore, wheat malt would not violate the decree. 
 
the role of yeast was not understood in those days, so it was omitted from 
the list.

i'm as hardcore a bavarian brewer as they come with respect to the 
rheinheitsgebot for traditional german styles, but i think the world would 
be a less pleasant place without the variety that spices, fruits, sugars, 
and etc. contribute to the world of beermaking.

i kept an octoberfest cool using an ice water bath one time in atlanta, but 
my problem was that the airlock water would get sucked into the fermenter 
as the headspace cooled.  so, watch out for that, if the fermentation is 
at a slow rate, during secondary (like it was with mine).

i've had this plug in some of my beers also, usually the ones where i let 
a little more trub than usual into the primary.  it starts out at the bottom 
of the fermenter, but then as the yeast get going, it floats toward the top 
and eventually, if i've left minimal headspace, it gets ejected in the 
blowoff.  i've noticed that there's a lot of yeast activity within (and 
in the beer, above) this plug of trub, and i guess it's because there's a 
good bit of yeast inside.  by the time it's ejected, though, i'm sure the 
beer is well populated with yeast.  otherwise there wouldn't be so much 
activity.  this happens with lagers as well as ales.

i've used bleach for a while now, and haven't had any big problems.  i rinse 
pretty well with hot tap water, and nothing bad has gotten me yet.  for 
stainless kegs, i use iodophor, but that's the only thing i use iodophor on. 
 
 
there was a question about lagering at higher temperatures.  all the benefits 
of lagering can't be achieved at higher temps (certainly higher than 50F), 
and it's basically because the yeast activity is very different depending on 
temperature.  a lagering at cold temps (mid to high 30's F) causes the yeast 
to reingest certain compounds in the beer (sorry, no beer books on hand), 
and this reingestion helps to smooth out the flavor of the beer.  there are 
other bio/chemical changes that take place in the beer, i think, but i've 
no reference with me at the moment (cue, lager experts).  so, temperature is 
really pretty key if you want to do a true lagering. 
 
now, is it possible to "lager" in the bottle, as soon as fermentation is 
over and the beer is packaged and a short (warm) period for bottle carbonation 
is given?  i've done this, but i've no idea if the beer benefitted from it. 
i should have done an a-b comparison.  i would imagine it probably does help 
a little, but there are some geometric/surface area issues that may come 
into play.  i may go look all this stuff up and repost later. 
 
until then, 
 
brew hard,

Subject: RO water and off flavors


Howdy fellow brewers: 
 
I have a question that was asked of me at a brewclub meeting over the 
weekend.  I frequently get asked to give opinions on the taste of homebrews 
(one of the hazards of owning a brew shop). Residing in central Indiana 
where the water is both quite hard and alkaline, many people are using RO 
water for their brewing. Their beers end up with an off flavor that seems to 
me to be phenolic (band aid-y). This flavor even shows up in brews that have 
been fermented below 70F. Yesterday, in sampling a steam beer that had been 
made using RO water, we thought that we detected a metalic taste (zinc?). 
So, here is my question: Can unadjusted RO water (no ions added, ie 
Burtonized) leech metalic ions out of stainless steel and brass fitings? 
 
As to the phenolic off flavors, wild yeast, high temps, and excess chlorox 
are teh likely culprits. It is quite possible that the local water 
departments are using chlorimines as a chlorine source. That being the cse 
boiling the tap water just gives you water that still has a high chlorine 
content. 
 
I noted in one of Dave Burley's postings in HBD 2159, that iodophor can also 
contribute off flavors if missused. What about products like One Step? 
 
I'll be glad to summarize responses if any comein via private e-mail(which 
is fine). 
Thanks, mes amis!!

     Tom Castle asks about his smelly compost.  Smelly compost usually 
     means anaerobic conditions.  Trub, being a condensed almost gelatinous 
     mess can easily go anaerobic.  Best bet is mix it up (aerate) with the 
     rest of your pile.  If your compost is active, I don't think a little 
     trub could kill it.  I usually compost my trub, never had a problem.
