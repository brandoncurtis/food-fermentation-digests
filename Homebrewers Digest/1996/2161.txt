Subject: Thanks HBD


Yes, thanks to all in the HBD who have helped me out over the last eight 
months with their invaluable advice. I've had too disastrous brews: a 
stout and a Harpoon Winter Warmer clone (which as you may recall I stuck 
my arm in...). Both were stuck fermentations with some horrid medicinal 
flavor/aroma -- undrinkable. 
 
Yes, I panicked when my ordinary bitter was uncarbonated after 5 days. So 
I waited, not the two weeks everyone said, but 12 days. Guess what??!! 
It's carbonated! It was Papazian's Righteous Real Ale. It's a little thin 
in the body. If I made this again I would add some crystal malt to 
attempt to remedy that. Also, the nose is a little weak as far as hop 
aroma. Well, the head retention is not phenomenal either. Finally, there 
is still a hint of that medicinal flavor/aroma (perhaps fermenting at 77 
F is too high and/or lag time is too long). 
 
Despite these problems (now I'm just getting greedy) I am thrilled with 
the finished product: a drinkable homebrew. Now I know what everyone 
means by "fresh." 
 
So what's my point? None really, other than to thank everyone here who 
has reassured me that homebrewing is not that difficult. I can RELAX now.

Be _real_ careful when you pull that hot pot off of the stove. 
Sometimes the boil-over unexpectedly cascades over the top scalding 
your hands in the process (speaking from personal experience).

Subject: Late harvest hops


This year, right when my local brew supply told me to, I planted a 
Willamette root.  I get plenty of sun (6-8 hours depending on cloud 
cover) and I water regularly every other day.  The vines have grown 
wonderfully (about 18 feet long) but no cones are even showing.  What 
could have happened?  I used a good, loose potting soil, with plenty of 
amendment, and a sandy bottom, placed into a 40 gallon tree pot.  Is 
there anything I can do?  I know that the weather will stay warm for 
another month or so, with rain starting another month after that 
(somewhere around halloween).  Is it possible that Willamette sets late 
or is more cold resistant, so will be fine setting late in the season?

Subject: RE: Bleach leaving a film


     Howdy, 
 
     In the last HBD a few people wrote that bleach leaves a film on the 
     surfaces it contacts.  They cited the slippery feeling on their skin 
     as proof of this. 
 
     That slippery feeling isn't actually the bleach, although it is caused 
     by the it.  That slipperiness is the lipids (fats & oils) in your 
     tissue being turned into soap by the bleach!  Don't try this at home! 
 
     Use cold water when you sanitize with bleach, and hot water to rinse. 
     Hot water will evaporate off the chlorine quickly, and there will be 
     no residue.  It is for this same reason that you should use cold water 
     when sanitizing:  the chlorine will stay in solution, where it is 
     working for you, rather than evaporating at a high rate, and choking 
     you. 
 
     BTW, I, too, have always used bleach and have had no problems because 
     of it. 
 
     Have Fun!

Thanks for the input on the Liberty Malt SS kettle, now the Williams 
Brewing Catalog arrives (no affiliation with either, etc.) and they appear 
to have a much better kettle/valve combo offered: 
 
40 qt. SS pot, 18-8 deep drawn by Polar Ware w/handles, and 
- - - welded on SS drain pipe with 3/8" MPT 
- - - brass ball valve with 3/8" FPT outlet to attach a hose barb 
- - - $159 
 
Has anyone tried this pot?  Any problems leaving a brass valve on an SS 
fitting (corrosion?) for long periods of time?

 I will be celebrating my 100th all-grain recipe with a barley wine. 
To celebrate "triple digits" I thought I'd brew a beer to O.G. 1.100 and 
100 IBU's and flaunt the style guidelines with massive hop flavour and aroma 
(similar to my "Jewel In The Crown" (tm) IPA).  Is 100 IBU's excessive?  Or 
will it mellow out after a few years?

Hi all, 
 
I would like to add one observation to the Irish Moss thread. I use 
rehydrated IM at the 15 min mark of my boils and this has helped in clearing 
my brews. One other thing that has helped in clearing my beers was going 
from a 60 min to a 90 min boil. I dont add hops until the 60 min mark which 
gives the wort 30 min to create hot break without any interference from the 
hops. Anyone notice the the same thing in there brewery?

Subject: Activity in secondary fermenter


I brewed a batch of pilsner using a kit from my local homebrew store. I used 
bakers dried active yeast which I started with a little bit of the cooled wort.
There was nice activity in the fermenting bucket and after one week I 
transferred it to my secondary fermenter. I now have more activity in the 
secondary fermenter than in the original fermenting bucket. It's been in the 
secondary fermenter for a little over a week now and there is still 
activity. Does this indicate that the beeer is infected with bacteria? Or 
does it just mean I have very active yeast? Thanks

Subject: Brewing Water


William P Giffin asks: 
 
<<Do we have to adjust our 
brewing water to achieve the style we want or can we do a good job of 
brewing by just getting the pH of the mash and the sparge water in the 
appropriate range? >> 
 
The answer is, "yes".  Actually, there's merit in both perspectives. 
 
Bill wrote about his experiences with "Burtonizing" brewing water; 
essentially saying that he obtained the desired effect over a wide range of 
sulphate levels.  I think that's entirely possible.  I brewed a pale ale usng 
Mosher's "ideal pale ale" profile which is about half as sulphated as "the 
real thing".  It was great -- sharply accentuated hop character and minerally 
flavor.  I suspect there is a sort of "threshold level" where the effect 
kicks in, and it probably levels off at some point not terribly far above 
that. 
 
Bill, I'd venture to say that if you used too much gypsum in your pilsners, 
which could happen given your very soft water's capability to yield a high-pH 
mash, that you *would* notice *if* you compared it to one acidified with 
CaCl2 or phosphoric acid.  Would the first beer be a crappy beer?  Probably 
not.  Would it be "rougher" than the second?  I'd wager so. 
 
Some thought needs to be added to your water along with your salts.  Hitting 
an ion profile "exactly" is usually impossible; coming within 20% is often 
tedious and impractical.  Getting high sulphates in a pale ale or high 
alkalinity in a stout is pretty straightforward, and it's those kinds of 
"broad approaches" that are probably most appropriate for most brewers, 
rather than *duplicating* Classic BrewTown's water. 
 
Getting the pH of the mash and sparge in line is *very* important.  Mash pH 
must be managed to optimize enzyme activity and therefore yield, among other 
effects.  Keeping your sparged runnings below 6.0 pH is easier if the water 
going in is already below 6.0 pH (the mash is already at about 5.4).  Calcium 
management in the brew water can play an important role here, so again the 
two perspectives overlap. 
 
I've found that "building water" from RO and salts yields a cleaner beer than 
using tap water.  In my case, it's at least partly because my tap water is 
positively doo-doo.  But your tap water probably contains chlorine, organics 
such as pesticides, and perhaps trace minerals that can throw off your beer. 
 
If you're happy with your beer and you're winning awards and accolades, then 
great, brew with what works.  But if you're finding that you're doing 
everything "right", it very possibly *COULD BE* your water.  Brew a batch of 
your favorite beer using 5 gal of RO with 1/2 tsp gypsum and 1/2 tsp baking 
soda only, and compare with the same beer brewed with tap water.  If you see 
a difference as I did, you'll become a convert too!

I am a salesman for a stainless steel tubing manufacturer, and heater 
manufacturers are our biggest customers. I speak from some authority here. 
Nicolloy is not as readily used as are some cousin alloys, Incoloy, and 
Inconel. The trade industry alloy number for Incoloy is 800, and there is 
also a 840 version. Inconel is 600 and 601 series alloy. These alloys are 
typically used  for extreme heat applications, such as the coils on electric 
ranges (stove top and oven coils), etc. That is, the coils normally get red 
or yellow hot in use. For the type of application that is discussed here, it 
is a bit of overkill. Normal 300 series stainless steel would do just fine. 
The corrosion resistance is there, and enough heat to do the job without 
discoloring the heater. BTW, it is important to note that in use, Incoloy 
and Inconel tube heaters get a black oxide that forms on their surface. It 
is a normal condition. However, I do not want that getting on MY wort. 
 
 
>One of these with a rating of 240v

I am glad to learn that there is a source for heaters such as these.

Here, again, I would agree. I have asked several of my customers if they 
could develop a special heater for me (with intentions to sell them 
commercially). While they were eager to assist (and could provide 
thermostatic controls, etc), the cost to make them was more than one could 
get at a place like Grainger.

Subject: Bleach residue


To carry on this bleach thread, bleach does not leave any film on any 
of your equipment. When you clean your glassware and bottles the nice 
"film" which sticks to glass after you rinse is just the water. Water 
sticks to glass when the glass is clean. This is how I can tell that 
my glassware is free from any organic material in the chemistry lab. When you 
get bleach
on your hands the sodium hydroxide reacts with fat and oil on your 
hands to make soap. That's why it feels, or looks like something is on 
your equipment. So don't worry............ 
 
Maybe I should have posted this in sci.engr.chem but its just my two 
cents worth to the collective.

Interesting, I have only ever read (perhaps inaccurate) English 
translations, but I understood the restriction to be only "barley malt", 
hence eliminating other grain malts as well as unmalted barley.

It should also be noted that the current German Beer Purity Law 
applies this tough standard of ingredients only to bottom-fermented 
beers such as lagers, not to top-fermented beers/ales such as

A couple of recent posts have dealt with unusual cold breaks that appear to 
be loogies or brains.  It happens to me quite often, but it got out of 
control once, about six months ago.  To see a picture of this strange

Hope this helps distinguish between cold break and real brains, the latter

Just to put your statements into perspective about Sorghum beer in SA, the 
Sorghum breweries where an apartheid creation to finance the black 
townships. The National Sorghum Breweries, which used to be state owned, is 
now privately ownes with various international beer producers having 
invested therein.  The Nat Sorghum Breweries are in the process of 
investing in clear beer production as in their VIVO microbrewery. Sorghum 
beer became big news in Nigeria when the import of barley malt was banned 
as an austerity measure and I believe it is still the case. Although 
Sorghum beer was a traditionally brewed drink in the Wild Africa days, it 
is a foul smelling repulsive drink compared to clear beer and is only drunk 
by those who can't afford anything else. The recently formed brewing ind 
assoc in South Africa has pointedly excluded them as Sorghum beer is not 
considered beer in the true sense.

Subject: RIMS PUMP


 
     Back in July I submitted a thread about a 1/50th hp magnetic pump that 
     was rated at 220 degrees. I have received the pump and gave it a test 
     when I brewed a Porter this weekend. The pump has a nice mounting 
     bracket attached to it and it is a nice feature. The pump is made of 
     metal for the motor and polysulfone for the pump actuator.  It is very 
     efficient and extremely quiet. I set up a copper tubing system 
     controlled on the output end byt a ballcock. The pump is rated at 6 
     gpm with a head space of 7-8 ft at 212 degrees. 
     I had the pump running for 1 1/2 hrs for mashing and the after boiling 
     transferred the HOT wort to a SS keg ~ 6 ft above the boiler.  It 
     transferred all 12 gallons with no problems and in about 3 minutes. 
     Overall I was very happy with the pumps performance. This pump is made 
     by one of the top pump mfgs in the US.  It is not a Little Giant. This 
     pump was designed specifically for a coffee system mfging company ant 
     the supplier had to go through quite a bit of paperwork to get the 
     pump. Far as I am concerned it was worth it. If you are interested in 
     the pump you can call Pump and Compressors 410-987-1343 and ask for 
     Rick. Tell him you are interested in the pump for a beer system. 
     They are the only people that the pump mfrg. has oked to sell this 
     pump. I do not profit by this and they were just a nice enough company 
     to go the extra steps.You can e-mail me if you want more info or if 
     you live in the Baltimore area you can stop by and check out the pump. 
 
     I went to great lenghts to find a pump that I thought would do the 
     trick.  There is a 1/100 pump available, but It is a little weak (my 
     opinion) for the time and head space necessary for RIMS brewing. 
     PLEASE do not e-mail me telling me about other pumps etc.

Greetings Beer Lovers, 
 
Hopping off my lurking stool, I've got another one for the 
collective.  I now have a couple of batches under my brewing belt 
now and am considering (more like planning) the move from bottling 
to kegging.  With the holiday season approaching (ie. homebrew 
gifts), I am toy-ing with the idea of splitting 5 USgal batches into 
bottles and kegs (maybe 12 bottles or so).  Are there any 
suggestions on how I may do this with as little hassle as possible, 
or are there issues involved that I am not currently aware of? I am 
somewhat familliar with the counter-pressure filler concept, but am 
not sure if I want to spend the $$ on one, since the costs with 
starting up the kegging operation are a bit high initially. 
 
Thanks in advance for all replys, and I'll be posting a summary 
given enough response. 
 
Until the next full mug, 
Mike

The primary difference between ales and lagers is that ales have noticeable 
esters (which give the beer a fruity aroma) and lagers do not.  Yeast create 
more esters when they ferment at higher temperatures which is why lagers, 
which are fermented quite a bit cooler than ales are low in esters.  Lagering 
does play a role in the flavour of a lager, but not as much (in my opinion) 
as the fermentation temperature. 
 
If you can't ferment below 58F, you can't make a true lager, but you can 
make a beer that is lager-like.  Some yeasts (like Wyeast American Ale #1056) 
only produce low levels of esters even at ale temperatures (but please note 
that #1056 does not like the temperature to be much lower than 63F (in my 
experience) -- I have read posts from others who have successfully fermented 
#1056 at around 60F, but I believe they used relatively large starters). 
 
Lager fermentations are typically done at temperatures between 45 and 55F. 
Some lager yeasts can ferment even lower and others prefer the higher end of 
this range.  Note that lager fermentations can take quite a bit longer 
(like two to four weeks, depending on starter size) than ale fermentations 
and you should really use at least a 2 liter starter (4 liters for 5 gallons 
would not be too big). 
 
During lagering there are many chemical and biological reactions.  Diacetyl 
and acetaldehyde that were created during the fermentation are reabsorbed 
(note that a few days between 60F and 65F when fermentation is almost over 
will help reduce diacetyl faster and therefore shorten the lagering time 
required -- this is called a diacetyl rest).  Chill haze is formed and 
settles.  There are many other reactions that take place.  I had a Traditional 
Bock lagering in bottles at 40F that smelled like home perm solution. 
Suddenly, after four months, the smell disappeared and the beer went on to 
win several 1st place ribbons. 
 
>Can I use a carboy for the lagering? How about the 5L mini-kegs which I just 
>started using? How long should I plan on lagering for? 
 
You can lager in the carboy, mini-kegs, corny kegs or even bottles.  Lagering 
in bottles is probably the least preferable because the stuff that settles 
out of the beer during lagering can easily be stirred back up during the pour. 
 
How long to lager?  It depends on the yeast and on whether or not you did 
a diacetyl rest.  Some yeasts take a long time, others, less.  Ideally, I 
would recommend lagering in a glass secondary for 6 or 8 weeks and then 
bottle.  Warm up the bottles to the low 60's (F) for two weeks to carbonate. 
Then, cool the bottles down slowly (say 5F per day) into the 40's (F).  Try 
one.  If there is still a lot of diacetyl (butterscotch or buttery), 
acetaldehyde (green apple aroma) or sulphury aromas, let it go a couple more 
weeks.  If it tastes great, you're done! 
 
Some say that you need to add more yeast at bottling time.  In my experience, 
this is not necessary.  While more yeast will decrease the time it takes to 
carbonate, you still won't be drinking the beer till after lagering is done, 
so what's the hurry?

I did an experiment comparing various designs of lauter tuns.  It was written 
up and published in the Great Grains issue of Zymurgy (1995 Special Issue). 
The bottom line is that while there was a difference between the various 
lauter tun designs, it was not as large as Ken's experience. 
 
The size of the area from which the wort is drawn does affect the efficiency 
of the extraction (small area == slightly less efficiency), however, by 
slowing the rate of lautering (make sure your lauter takes at least 45 
minutes and 90 minutes would be even better) will minimize the difference 
between large and small wort-drawing areas.  I have gotten 30 pts/lb/gal 
from my EasyMasher(tm) which is about the smallest area of all the designs 
(although I did take 8 gallons of runnings and boiled it down to 5.5).

I would be very cautions in using something not specifically approved for

just from using garbage bins for fermenters, but even from using the wrong 
type of hose for siphoning!

Well, you knew that when you said "sterilization" you were going to hear 
from me.  I'm sure Kevin meant "sanitation," and he may be right about 
the results of all the reactions being sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide, 
*BUT* these reactions would have to run to completion with *all* the sodium 
hypochorite.  This is not usually the case.  Also the chlorine in the bleach 
can react with organic compounds in the wort.  No, at the recommended 
concentrations for sanitation (200ppm of Cl -- which is 1 tbsp per gallon) 
rinsing should be done or there is a high risk of chlorophenols being 
created and they are particularly unpleasant-smelling.

It's not the dissolved solids you want to duplicate, but (in the case of 
Burton-on-Trent water) the sulphate level.

Calcium *helps* in brewing for several reasons: it reacts with phosphates 
in the malt to lower pH, it helps protect some enzymes from denaturing too 
quickly and it forms calcium oxalate (beerstone) which otherwise would 
otherwise result in what's called "oxalate haze."  Since the brewers in 
Pilsen have very low calcium levels, they have to use an acid rest which 
is an enzymatic way of lowering pH (phytase makes phytic acid).  You cannot 
make beer that tastes like a Burton ale from Pilsen water without adding 
LOTS of sulphate.  The beer simply won't have that long, lingering bitterness 
that sulphate's reaction with hop bitternes adds. 
 
>Lets go back to Burton water if the water is unadjusted how much of the 
>solids precipitate out of the wort during the boil?  How much sulfate is 
>required to give the hop character of a Burton pale ale? 
 
You are confusing temporary hardness with permanent hardness.  Temporary 
hardness is the result of calcium carbonate/bicarbonate, whereas permanent 
hardness is from calcium sulphate.  When you boil the high calcium carbonate/ 
bicarbonate water, some of the calcium carbonate/bicarbonate will precipitate 
out.  Calcium sulphate does not.  It is plenty soluble even if you pre-boil 
the water.  When you have high-sulphate water, you are stuck with it (unless 
you use an RO water system or dilute with bottled water).  The level of 
sulphate in Burton-on-Trent water has been reported in various books to be 
between 600 and 750 ppm.

Are you sure you used the right amount of salts to duplicate Burton water? 
It's quite a lot.  You also need to have a pretty high bitterness in the 
beer.  The sulphate affects the finish the most.  Here's a perfect example: 
I tried brewing a Bohemian Pilsner with Chicago water + distilled.  About 
1/3 of the water was distilled, 2/3 Chicago water.  I believe that we have 
25 ppm of sulphate in our water.  The resulting beer was good and drinkable 
and marginally in-style, but it had a slight increase in bitterness in the 
finish which is due to the sulphate.  It was not a great Bohemian Pilsner 
because of this. 
 
Burton water and sulphate is a good example, but another one is Dublin water 
and carbonate/bicarbonate.  If you made a stout with Pilsen water it would 
be more acid than it should.  The reason stouts work so well in Dublin is 
because the acidity of the dark grains balances the alkalinity of the 
high-carbonate water.

I agree that, if misused, iodophor can contribute off-flavours, but if 
you use the dilution that yields 12.5 ppm of titratable iodine, you can 
drip dry the bottle or carboy and not have any problems.  One-Step(tm) is 
primarily sodium percarbonate which, when added to water, is basically 
hydrogen peroxide and sodium carbonate, both very flavour-neutral this 
late in the brewing process.  The sodium carbonate is a pretty good 
cleaner and the peroxide is the sanitizer.  Note that you should not 
soak anything very long in either One-Step or sodium carbonate (washing soda) 
because it a carbonate film can form on the item (which takes acid to 
remove).
