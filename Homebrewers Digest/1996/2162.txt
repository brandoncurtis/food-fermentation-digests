Subject: Re: Bleach


     If Clorox has no chlorine, isn't it Hydrox?  or is that just 
     cookies... 
 
     Anyway, as far as I know, bleach is bleach.  In fact, a quick check of 
     the label will tell you that liquid plummer is bleach.  Bleach is made 
     by mixing chlorine gas (Cl2) with a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. 
     The result is sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and salt (NaCl).  Excess 
     NaOH is required to avoid the loss of Cl2 which most people consider a 
     bad thing.  (been there and done that once in a high school chem lab 
     long ago and far away...)  The other thing that can happen at cool 
     temps and excess Cl2 is the formation of muriatic acid (HCl) and 
     hypochlorous acid (HOCl).  HOCl is pretty unstable which is why you 
     would still get free CL2. 
 
     The point is that all unscented bleach that I have seen has NaOH and 
     NaOCl in roughly equal concentrations (and NaCl).  The only difference 
     that I have seen between name brand and generic bleach is price.  Buy 
     the cheapest you can find.  Bleach is pretty basic stuff.  I've worked 
     in chemical plants that produce bleach as a commercial product, as an 
     intermediate, and as a waste.  They all seem to use 6% NaOH as the 
     basis, so the resulting strength is always the same.  I don't know 
     why, but I suspect that higher concentrations of NaOH and NaOCl are a 
     pain to work with and provide no additional benefit relative to the 
     cost of the NaOH and Cl2.  Just out of curiosity, where can I find out 
     more about Chlorine free Clorox bleach? 
 
     I don't know how bleach could encourage bacterial growth.  Any 
     bacteria that have a fondness for bleach sorta scare me! ;-)  Maybe 
     your rinsing too much with bacterially contaminated water and 
     defeating the purpose of the bleach.

Subject: Redhook dating question


 
 
A question for you left coast brewers (it's not a brewing question, 
specifically).....  My local grocery store recently started carrying Redhook 
products.  I snatched up a six pack of the ESB last week.  I noticed that 
the bottom of the six pack carton had "12/95" imprinted in it.  Thinking 
that I had just paid for 9 month old beer, I got steamed.  The beer didn't 
taste off, but it wasn't as hoppy as I expected (remembered from drinking it 
a while back).  On a more recent trip to the store, I saw the AB guy 
restocking.  Remembering the AB-Redhook deal, I asked him about the dating. 
 He pointed out the "best consumed by" date on the bottles, which said 
11/6/96.  He didn't know anything about the date on the carton, but felt 
confident that the beer was fresh since our local Columbia market just 
started carrying it.  So, what's the real story on dating?  How long does 
Redhook say the beer will keep?  Why in the world would there be a date 
printed on the carton, if not to indicate bottling date?  When was the beer 
bottled, if it says best consumed by 11/6 on it?  How long can I 
realisticcally expect a Redhook product to be "fresh"? 
 
TIA, 
Scott

Hey y'all; 
 
Thanks for all the replies about lining concrete fermenters.  I really 
appreciate all the thought and effort that went into them.  Thanks again. 
 
I now remember just why I haven't been receiving Homebrew Digest for the 
last decade or so:  it ends up filling my mailbox with unread issues.  I 
have tried to keep up, but it's equivalent to reading 20 - 40 emails a day 
every day in addition to the "serious" (work-related) mailings I already 
have to deal with.  I've flirted with a few email digests, and so far each 
one has grown to the point where it's too time-consuming to keep up with

Subject: Need advice on applejack lagers (apple juice)


I need some feedback on using apple juice in lager beers. 
I think that a crisp, clean applejack lager would be very nice 
for late fall/early winter. 
I'm thinking of putting a gallon of apple juice in a 5.5-gallon 
batch of lager.   The malt portion would be about 8 lbs. of 
pilsner malt (I don't get such a good yield) and perhaps 
1 lb. of munich malt.   1/2 lb. of home-toasted malt might 
be nice, too.   I know you have to pasteurize the apple juice, 
and that you certainly don't want to boil it, or get it up 
above 180 F (the pectin sets).   I really want to try to avoid 
cheap, filtered, clear apple juice, since I prefer the taste 
of the organic unfiltered kind, but I'm wondering if the 
beer will still clear.  Irish moss works wonders for me on this 
score, usually.   I know this beer will be fairly dry due to 
the fruit sugars, so that's why I'm using a bit of munich. 
Yeast will probably be good old Wyeast Bav. lager, since I'll be 
making some bock at the same time. 
        Any tips on applejack lagers would be much appreciated. 
Please respond off-list as well as by posting to the list. 
BTW, I've been brewing for 6 years and 130 batches, and have 
taught homebrewing classes before.   I've just never made 
applejack lager before. 
 
                Thanks, 
                        Tam

Subject: Real Root Beer, Water,


Brewsters: 
 
Mark asks if anyone has any real experience with root beer from roots.  When I 
was a Boy Scoutmaster, we went to summer camp.  I noticed many,many small 
sassafras trees a year or two old in an area which would be inappropriate for 
them in the future.   So I Pulled them up, washed the roots, cut them up and 
boiled them to make a tea.  It turned reddish-brown as I recall and with a 
little sugar and some ice it made an excellent root beer. Some of the boys were
skittish about anything that didn't come from a store in a bottle, but most 
tried it and really liked it - so did I. 
- ----------------------------------------------------------- 
Bill Giffin writes to ask why use water adjusted to the water of the type of 
beer you wish to brew. The short answer is to simulate and get all the nuances 
of the beer under discussion. I guess you know all about the effect cacium has 
in reacting with the grist components to release phosphoric acid and drop the 
pH
into the proper range for brewing  since you tried an experiment with lactic 
acid adjustment. Incidently, pils in many cases is brewed at a higher pH since 
the water is so pure. Taste some water with calcium sulfate stirred into 
it,likewise calcium carbonate and magnesium sulfate and see if you can detect a
difference in taste. 
 
British friends tell me that in the old days before the great war (WWII) some 
of
the beers were noted for their laxative properties. After an evening of over 
indulgence, a friend of mine couldn't make it home in time ( he described the 
physiological effect as an oscillating sphincter or words to that effect) and 
walked through a small pond to remove the stain from his trousers before he got
home, so his mum wouldn't ask questions.  His plans failed, of course.  Mums 
know everything. Besides, why he assumed she wouldn't ask him to explain how he
got wet only from the waist down. I don't know. I have always assumed this 
laxative quality was due to an over-active hand on the part of the brewer in 
adding magnesium sulfate  (Epsom salts) to get a better bittering cheaply.

Subject: conical bottling bucket? / dissolving chalk


Fellow HBDers, 
 
While I'm waiting for delivery of the catalog from U.S. Plastics, 
maybe one of youse with a catalog could answer a question for me: 
Do they have a 5-gallon conical bucket with a valve at the bottom 
that could be used as a bottling bucket?  It annoys me to have to 
leave behind so much beer in my flat-bottomed bucket (I do drink 
the remaining beer of course, but it's not carbonated). 
 
******** 
 
A tip to those of you who wish to boost the alkalinity of your 
brewing water with chalk.  Chalk dissolves easily in seltzer.  I 
haven't tested the upper limit, but I think at least several grams 
of chalk will dissolve in 1-liter of seltzer.  It's best to chill 
the seltzer (to keep most of the CO2 in solution) before adding the 
chalk, and then capping the bottle to retain the CO2.  After the 
chalk is dissolved, just add the seltzer to the bulk of your brewing 
water.

More specifically, it's the NaOH, or lye, in the bleach that saponifies 
the skin oils.  Soap is a salt of a fatty acid; in this case, a sodium 
salt. 
 
BTW, soap making is another craft that seems to appeal to the same 
psyche as home brewing, at least it does for me.  A web site I've found 
useful is at http://www.demon.co.uk/murderon/fragrant/makesoap.html.  A 
quick search turned up a number of others.

'smatter of fact, this is exactly what I do, in all the all-grains I've done

On the water thread, Frederick L. Pauly asks:

I'm absolutely guessing here, but perhaps this might help.  I doubt that 
there would be much/any flavor difference due to the mash pH per se, but you 
*might* notice a difference due to the high alkaline water condition that 
caused the high pH in the first place.  High alkalinity in your beer can 
harshen hop flavor, hinder break development, and darken/redden your beer. 
 
Another effect of high mash pH would possibly be reduced efficiency, since 
saccharification enzymes prefer a lower pH range.   Any of you enzymophiles 
care to quantify this a bit?

So why is it that we can keep bottle-conditioned beer at room temperature, and 
still have some viable yeast in there? I suspect that most commercial bottle 
conditioned beers (especially imports) have spent a lot more than 3 days at 
elevated temperatures, and people still culture yeast from these successfully. 
 
I've also left swollen packets of Wyeast sit for a week or so at room temp 
(not that I'd actually *recommend* doing this, mind you) and they've still 
been OK. Slow to start, but definitely still alive.

Well, I've got one in primary right now, so I don't actually know how it will

Hmm... I don't think cocoa powder is oil *free* -- it just has less oil in it 
than the solid stuff (baker's chocolate). I used baker's chocolate in a porter 
a few months back; it was very tasty, but there was a huge oil slick (like 
1/4") in the neck of every bottle.

Yeah, I found this out the hard way. I soak bottles in washing soda solution 
to remove labels (it works *great* for this, BTW). The first time I used it, 
the bottles weren't standing up, so the washing soda solution got *inside* the 
bottles. It was a *major* PITA cleaning the deposits out...

Subject: Funky Taste,


Brewsters: 
 
Kevin writes to thank HBD and relate some of his disasters. Kevin, all those 
things you talk about, funky taste, non-fermentation, slow starters, etc. could
be explained by not rinsing your equipment properly to remove your sterilant. 
After using bleach, B-brite, Iodophor, etc. rinse three times with very hot 
water that has been boiled. Although you will hear that it is OK to drip dry if
you use low, sanitizer levels of the iodine compounds, I am of the school that 
says use a high enough concentration to sterilize and then rinse with hot, 
boiled water. Put about 1-2 quarts in the carboy and rotate it to cover all the
surfaces.  repeat three times. Keep all plastic hoses,  airlocks, etc. just as 
clean as the carboy and you won't have any trouble. 
- ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Jim Shanley writes to ask why he is still getting fermetation in his secondary 
and why it is more active than a primary ferment. My first question is why did 
you use bakers yeast when so many fine beer yeasts are available?  Secondly, I 
think that , if anything, your yeast is*less* active, not *more* as you 
suggested. Had it stopped fermenting when you racked it? Did you move it from a
cool area to a warmer area when you transferred it? 
- -------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sorrry, but I forgot the reference and I zapped the HBD already. I agree that a
plastic taste/smell can come from new plastic hoses *(especially)* and 
containers.  Hoses generally have a plasticizer which can be quite persistent. 
I usually use soap and then run very hot water through a new hose for some time
until the water doesn't have a taste Polyethlyene doesn't have any plasticizers
in it usually and smells mildly of oil when first purchased. I always wash well
with soap and water and give it several rinses in boiling water. If you are 
really worried about this, brew a strong flavored beer the first time, like a 
stout, so that the smell/taste won't be noticed. Of course it is preferable to 
use food grade plastics if possible, but I am not familiar with Jorge's ability
to procure these things in Uruguay. I stay away from red pigments in plastic, 
since they may contain naphthalene amine based pigments and dyes and many years
ago these were found to contain carcinogens, at least in the intermediate 
stages
of manufacture. I sincerely doubt it is a problem, but if black, white and grey
are OK, why not use them?

Subject: counterpressure bottle filler


Well, I recently purchased a CP bottle filler from Braukunst 
and am really happy with it.  I bought that model based partly 
on the Zymurgy road test and partly on the price.  Braukunst 
gets them made by a third party, so it took a while for it 
to arrive. 
 
I had heard about the "poor man's" bottle filler and the fact 
that these "regular" bottle fillers take a lot of practice and 
getting used to.  Seems like I only needed one bottle of 
practice.  It is really quite easy to use and the results seem 
to be perfect. 
 
The only real problem I have so far is how to clean the 
thing when finished.  I really need another keg of some 
kind of cleaner that I can hook up and run through the 
Bottle filler, but all my kegs have beer in them.  Alternately, 
I could use a Carbonator type cap for a pin lock fitting 
and fill a plastic bottle with cleaner. 
 
Just wanted to say that bottle filling is easy and convenient 
and this is the best toy I've bought since I went to kegs 
in the first place

Let me repeat my own method for avoiding boilovers: 
 
Skim the scum that forms just before it gets roiling.  This scum/film 
covers the wort and traps air which allows it to boil over.  Skim it with a 
strainer or spoon for a few minutes and you can leave the room for the next 
hour and a half with no worries.

Yo G, 
 
I have looked into the concial bottom containers sold by USP and 
unfortunately they are too expensive for practical use. If I were 
you I would simply get another bucket and put a valve in the bottom 
instead of the side and create some sort of stand for it. It would

Subject: More on brewing water


Top of the morning to ye all, 
 
OK Burton water has 270 ppm of Calcium, 60 ppm of magnesium, 30 ppm of 
sodium, 200 ppm of bicarbonate, 640 ppm of sulfate and 40 ppm of 
chloride.  That comes to 1240 ppm of what is show.  I do know that the 
water in Burton does not all have the above some more some less depending 
on lots of variables.  The pH is about 7+/-. 
 
To make a good bitter or pale ale in the Burton style what of the above 
must you have?  I have had some Pils that had a nice long bitter finish 
and the water in that beer had very little of anything in it. 
 
>>Al K said: 
 Since the brewers in 
Pilsen have very low calcium levels, they have to use an acid rest which 
is an enzymatic way of lowering pH (phytase makes phytic acid). 
<< 
 
So what is wrong with an acid rest I do it all the time on my Pil and 
German style lagers rather then adding gypsum.  I prefer the softer 
smoother beer that I get by leaving the gypsum in its bag.  As a matter 
of fact I lost the bag of gypsum that I was using and have not bothered 
to find it as I enjoy a softer smoother beer. 
 
So the moral of the story is you do not really need a great deal of 
Calcium in you water to make a good or even great beer. 
 
>>Al K again: 
 Are you sure you used the right amount of salts to duplicate Burton 
water? 
It's quite a lot.  You also need to have a pretty high bitterness in the 
beer.  The sulphate affects the finish the most. 
<< 
Yes! 
 
>>Al K again: 
  If you made a stout with Pilsen water it would be more acid than it 
should.  The reason stouts work so well in Dublin is because the acidity 
of the dark grains balances the alkalinity of the high-carbonate water. 
<< 
 
Once you have adjusted you stout mash to 5.3 pH do you have to add more 
salts to the mash to approximate Dublin water or is having you mash pH at 
5.3 enough? 
 
>>Al K: 
  Here's a perfect example: 
I tried brewing a Bohemian Pilsner with Chicago water + distilled.  About 
 
1/3 of the water was distilled, 2/3 Chicago water.  I believe that we 
have 
25 ppm of sulphate in our water.  The resulting beer was good and 
drinkable 
and marginally in-style, but it had a slight increase in bitterness in 
the 
finish which is due to the sulphate. 
<< 
 
This is exactly the reason the German beer use less hops then the Czech 
Pils and yet the amount of bitterness is very similar my be that the 
German Pils may even seem hoppier. 
 
Once you have adjusted your mash and brewing water into the appropriate 
range do you really have to add more to duplicate a particular water? If 
so why? 
 
The brewing waters with high concentrations of stuff, what is the amount 
of buffering in these waters?  How does this effect how much of the 
chemical are available to affect the brewing process?

Subject: Is there any way to prepare specialty malts at home?


 
Dear friends? 
I finally found a supplier for malt. However, I can only get pale ale 
malt. I will have the chance to brew some beers although I will not be 
brewing special beers, the ones which are prepared with special malts. 
 
I wonder whether there is any way to prepare specialty malts like 
chocolate, caramel, etc. either from barley or pale ale malt with the 
equipment that I can have at home. I mean, is there any chance to prepare 
specialty malts at home? 
 
I would appreciate your suggestions about different procedures or literature. 
 
Bye, Jorge

Please forward any advise you receive on thermometer calibration. I just built 
a 3 tier brewery with adjustable thermometers on the hot liquor tank and mash

okay, this is the second person who has questioned my assertion that the 
original decree specified malt and not specifically barley malt.  i'm 
starting to doubt my memory. 
 
does anybody have hardcore evidence on what the original reinheitsgebot 
specified?  barley malt only, or just "malt" in general?

has this always been the case?  had bottom fermentation been established 
in 1516?  or is this a recent change? 
 
i read that the purity law hasn't really been a "law" for a while now.  it's 
merely a standard which brewers continue to use to promote their products. 
still valuable, i think.  i guess in the good old days you got your brewery 
shut down if you were found in violation of the law. 
 
sorry if i misled anyone.  this really should get straightened out.

Boy! You must have some acutely sensitive taste buds. I've never tasted 
iodophor in any of the beers that I siphon into still-dripping corney kegs. 
My iodophor-sanitized kegged beer was served at the Saturday night dinner 
for the Midwest Region NHC first round judges, and not a one came up to me 
and said, "You know Chuck, your beer tastes like iodophor." 
 
I've never tasted it in the beer that I draw from the taps I've just 
sanitized. and then rise by drawing one pint of beer through the tap. I've 
never tasted it in beers that I bottle, and those bottles are always still 
dripping iodophor down the bottle tree when I start to fill them. I've never 
tasted it in beers of other homebrewers who use iodophor to santitze and I 
belong to four different clubs and I've sampled *a lot* of beer and mead 
from Iodophor-sanitized containers. 
 
I've never tasted it in my milk either, nor have my children (DAD!!! My milk 
tastes like iodophor!), yet most dairy farmers use it to sanitize their cow's 
udders, milking machines, piping, and storage tanks. The instructions on the 
label say not to rinse, to let it drip dry. 
 
I've never had a comment on the taste of iodophor in any of the many beers 
and meads that I've sent to the AHA Nationals, AHA Club-only competitions, 
the Mazer Cup, the Ambrosia Adventure, the Dixie Cup, CBS's Spooky Brew 
Review, and many other contests. I've never heard of anyone else ever 
having a comment on their judging sheets about the taste of iodophor. 
 
I've discussed the use of iodophor (and the lack of a resulting flavor) 
with BJCP master judges and they have never detected the taste of iodophor 
in their beers or any beers that they have judged. 
 
So, as I said above, you must have some acutely sensitive taste buds, 
because from what I've seen, you're the *only* person that I've ever 
heard of that can detect the flavor of iodophor used to sanitize brewing, 
bottling, kegging, and dispensing equipment. 
 
Now if by "not flushed properly" you mean that the line was kept filled 
with iodophor and then you drew a glass of beer (without running  beer or 
other rinse through the line), well then of course you'd taste iodophor, 
but then I'd expect that your statement would have read something like, 
"If you draw beer from a line filled with iodophor, you'll taste iodophor."

Subject: The Reinheitsgebot


- -- [ From: Michael Gerholdt * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] -- 
 
This is in the Library of Technical Articles on The Brewery: 
 
- -----------------------8<---------------begin paste quote------------------- 
- ------------------- 
 
Following is an English translation of the Reinheitsgebot (German Purity Law 
) adopted in 1516, the 
oldest provision still enforced to protect the consumer. This is taken from 
the article "History of 
German Brewing" by Karl J. Eden, published in 'zymurgy' magazine, Vol. 16, 
No. 4 Special 1993. 
 
"We hereby proclaim and decree, by Authority of our Province, that 
henceforth in the Duchy of 
Bavaria, in the country as well as in the cities and marketplaces, the 
following rules apply to the sale 
of beer: 
 
"From Michaelmas to Georgi, the price for one Mass [Bavarian Liter 1,069] or 
one Kopf 
[bowl-shaped container for fluids, not quite one Mass], is not to exceed one 
Pfennig Munich value, 
and 
 
"From Georgi to Michaelmas, the Mass shall not be sold for more than two 
Pfennig of the same 
value, the Kopf not more than three Heller [Heller usually one-half Pfennig] 
.. 
 
"If this not be adhered to, the punishment stated below shall be 
administered. 
 
"Should any person brew, or otherwise have, other beer than March beer, it 
is not to be sold any 
higher than one Pfennig per Mass. 
 
"Furthermore, we wish to emphasize that in future in all cities, markets and 
in the country, the only 
ingredients used for the brewing of beer must be Barley, Hops and Water. 
Whosoever knowingly 
disregards or transgresses upon this ordinance, shall be punished by the 
Court authorities' 
confiscating such barrels of beer, without fail. 
 
"Should, however, an innkeeper in the country, city or markets buy two or 
three pails of beer 
(containing 60 Mass) and sell it again to the common peasantry, he alone 
shall be permitted to 
charge one Heller more for the Mass of the Kopf, than mentioned above. 
Furthermore, should there 
arise a scarcity and subsequent price increase of the barley (also 
considering that the times of harvest 
differ, due to location), WE, the Bavarian Duchy, shall have the right to 
order curtailments for the 
good of all concerned."

I do not have immediate access to a German version and cannot comment on 
whether the word translated "Barley" above is specific to barley, or whether 
it could be other malted grains. 
 
However, this is written in the 
BEER JUDGE CERTIFICATION EXAM STUDY GUIDE by Greg Walz: 
 
- -----------------------------8<-------------------------------begin quote--- 
- ------------------- 
 
The Reinheitsgebot, or "Order of Purity", was issued by Wilhelm IV, Duke of 
Bavaria, in the year 1516, to guarantee the purity and quality of beer and 
to 
ban the use of questionable (and sometimes dangerous) additives.  The 
Reinheitsgebot stated that beer can be brewed only from malt, hops, and 
water 
(yeast was unknown in the 16th century).  The Reinheitsgebot is thus the 
world's oldest consumer protection / product quality law still in effect. 
 
This decree formed part of the basic law of Bavaria, and its retention was a 
condition of Bavaria's admittance to the Republic of Germany in 1919. 
Followed 
throughout the Republic of Germany (and West Germany after WW II), the 
Reinheitsgebot was interpreted to forbid the brewing or sale of any 
fermented 
grain beverage as "beer" unless made from only the four ingredients. 
 
In 1987 the European Court (acting for the Common Market) declared the law 
to 
be "protectionist."  As a result, beers not meeting the Reinheitsgebot (such 
as most American beers and many Belgian styles) can now be sold in Germany 
as 
"beer."  However, all German brewers are united in their commitment to 
continue 
following the Reinheitsgebot with the beers they brew.  This has been 
extended 
to the breweries of former East Germany when the two countries were reunited 
in October of 1990. 
 
A common misconception about the Reinheitsgebot is that beers brewed to this 
standard have to be made from 100% barley malt.  Were this true, brewing 
Bavarian weizenbiers (or any other German style, such as Klsch, that uses 
malted wheat) would be forbidden - and we all know this is not the case! 
Today 
the Reinheitsgebot is interpreted to mean that beer must be brewed from 
malted 
cereal grains.  Thus the use of malted wheat (or malted rye or malted oats) 
in 
a beer would not disqualify it from meeting the Reinheitsgebot, but use of, 
say, unmalted roasted black barley (as found in Irish Stout) would result in 
disqualification.  Eric Warner, in "German Wheat Beer" (see Reference 
section) 
says, "The Reinheitsgebot...law requires that only malted cereal grains be 
used 
for brewing any German beer."  German brewers, additionally, presently 
restrict 
the use of malted grains other than barley to those styles made with ale 
yeasts. 
 
Note the following common adjuncts that would not be permitted in a true 
Reinheitsgebot beer: Corn grits, rice, flaked maize, unmalted barley (or 
other 
unmalted cereal grains), corn sugar, candy sugar, corn syrup, maltodextrin, 
Irish moss, gelatin, isinglass, fruit, spices other than hops, honey, etc. 
 
While the Reinheitsgebot has been quite effective over the centuries in 
protecting the quality and purity of German beer, keep in mind that we, as 
homebrewers, do not have to be limited by it, and are thus free to explore 
the 
world's wealth of beer styles and ingredients.
