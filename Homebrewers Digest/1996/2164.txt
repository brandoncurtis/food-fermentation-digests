 An instant cure for boil overs is to blow on the wort.  Most of the 
"stuff" trying to boil over is just bubbles, and the thermal shock from 
blowing on them will burst them and prevent boil overs - try it, you'll 
be very surprised!  Another trick is to just mount a small fan to blow 
just over the brim of your pot......  No more frantic moving around of a 
near boiling pot - don't do that, it's dangerous.

Subject: Summer Wort Chilling


Greetings, 
 
Bob`at`Carol.net pours ice water through his immersion chiller to drop his wort 
those final 3-4 degrees to pitching temperature. Earlier this spring, I went to
the local Home Depot and acquired a 4 gal/min submersible "garden" pump, 
(around
$40) which I hook up to my chiller via 3/8" tubing and ss clamps. 
 
Once my boil is over and I have everything hooked up, I immerse the pump in a 
sink full of  water and start pumping.  The exhaust (very hot) water goes out 
the other side of the sink, and once this has dropped to ~100 degrees, the pump
goes straight into a 5 gal bucket filled with icewater made from frozen 1 gal 
plastic milk jugs, crushed). After a few minutes the exhaust water is cool 
enough to just recirculate back into the bucket. 
 
Total time to get the wort from boiling to ~75F is 23 minutes.  As this is the 
only "automated" step of my brewing process, I look forward to this phase so I 
can watch my thermometer confirm the temp drop and remind me that the $40 was 
well worth the investment by reducing my overall brewing time. I have never had
an infection and contribute this to careful sanitation and the efficiency of my
chilling process.

Yes, I've done this with a local juice company here in Austin, Goodflow.

Just a data point. 
Brewed a 5 gal pale 10days ago, in a 20 gal ss pot, on a 170K btu burner. 
Boiled over without any problems. 
So don't just trust your brewpot size: watch your boils.

First of all, ignore the water pH.  What matters is the pH of the mash and 
there's no way of telling (without some heavy-duty calculation) what the 
pH of the mash will be given a particular water. 
 
>To make a good bitter or pale ale in the Burton style what of the above

To make a good Bitter in the Burton style (note that when the popularity 
of Burton Ales skyrocketed, many brewers in the UK started adding gypsum 
and possibly other salts to their water in an effort to imitate Burton 
water -- it's called "Burtonising") you need to make sure there is enough 
sulphate in the water and then you may have to adjust the pH down with 
calcium carbonate so the pH is not too low (it depends on your water). 
1 teaspoon of gypsum (calcium sulphate) in 1 gallon of water will give 
about 28 ppm of SO4.   Once you mash-in, measure the pH and add chalk 
(calcium carbonate) till the pH is in the 5.2 - 5.5 range.

Nothing is *wrong* with it.  You are correct to use the acid rest for 
your Bohemian and German Pils (Munich water only has 10 ppm of sulphate 
according to Darryl Richman's Bock, which I'm now reading).  Actually, 
it would be stylistically incorrect to add gypsum to these recipes.  It 
does indeed give a smoother brew -- you obviously *do* notice the effect 
of sulphate.  Alternatively, you could add lactic or phosphoric acids 
to lower pH without adding sulphate.  I believe that these acids do pull 
calcium out of the water (AJ?) so that you could end up with not enough 
to protect enzymes or form beerstone. 
 
>So the moral of the story is you do not really need a great deal of 
>Calcium in you water to make a good or even great beer. 
 
Correct, but it does make it *easier* to brew.  Note that in my initial 
post on this subject (this time around) I said that calcium *helps* 
you brew.  Incidentally, you can add calcium via calcium chloride and 
get the pH reduction effect (and other benefits) without the bitterness- 
enhancing and drying effect of the sulphate.  I wonder how much of the 
long lagering time in Bohemian Pils (very low calcium water) is for 
removing oxalate haze... anyone know if lagering will precipitate out 
oxalate haze?

I would stop at 5.3.  Note that Guinness sours part of their beer, pasteurizes 
it and adds that back into the main batch.  I would not be surprised if this 
was done to counterbalance the extremely high levels of carbonate.  I think 
you have a very good point here.  Thanks for pointing it out.

Well, consider that I had about 17 ppm of sulphate in my beer and Munich 
water has about 10.  If I miscalculated volumes, it could very well 
have been double the amount of sulphate in Munich water.  I tasted many 
beers while in Munich and the rest of Bavaria last summer and I don't 
recall a significant increase in the bitterness in the finish.  Perhaps I 
was overly critical of my own beer, but I think that the bitterness rose 
in the finish too much even for a Munich lager.  Compared to the non-Bavarian 
German Pils...  now there you may have another good point.

I'm no chemist, so I'll leave this for them to answer, but the one buffering 
effect I *do* know that occurs is that carbonate/bicarbonate ions prevent 
the lowering of the pH.  I *believe* that most of the other ions associated 
with brewing are only weakly acid or alkaline and affect the pH slightly. 
 
My understanding is that how an ion affects the pH depends on how soluble 
the compounds are that it forms (like magnesium carbonate is more soluble 
than calcium carbonate, so you can't boil out much carbonate if you have 
a lot of magnesium in your water) and on how many hydrogens or hydroxide 
ions it can "capture" or "release" into the soup (i.e. H3PO4 can release 
three hydrogens).  I would be interested in learning more about this.  AJ?

Okay, let's go through this step by step. 
 
*The first half of the first line "Al Korzonas": 
 
This appears to be a name of some kind perhaps a noun. 
 
*The second half of the first line "Palos Hills, IL": 
 
This could be an address or possibly a place of residence of said noun from 
the first line. 
 
*The second line I will break down into three parts, 
 
1. "korzonas": this seems to be another example of said noun from the first 
line. 
2. "`at`": this is an "at" sign 
3. "lucent.com": this is an internet service provider (lucent= service 
provider .= dot com= commercial) 
 
*The third line "Copyright 1996 Al Korzonas" seems pretty straight forward: 
 
This line is simply stating that said noun from the first line has taken 
the time to register said nouns entire posting to the HBD with the US 
copyright office. By doing this, all persons or people wishing to use or 
quote from said nouns HBD post should ask for permission from said nouns 
lawyers or face criminal charges and federal copyright infringement. 
 
Thank you for your time and I hope that we are now all clear on this.

First of all, though I did not say so, I do this before adding any hops.  I 
have found that this "film" or "scum" can coat the hops, reducing 
utilization.  Also, it just makes things easier to get rid of the "scum" 
first.  Besides, I rarely put in hops for more than 60 minutes, so they go 
in only after the wort has been boiling awhile. 
 
If you put in the hops right away (first wort hopping or some variant), 
would there be any hop component in the "scum"?  It may be, but I don't 
know of any reason to think that is the case. 
Anyone out there know for sure? 
 
Also, to describe in more detail, when you put the wort on the heat to 
start it boiling, this "scum" forms before it gets visibly boiling.  On my 
gas stove that takes about 5-10 minutes.  It continues to form as the wort 
gets visibly boiling, so I skim it off for about 10-15 minutes until no 
more forms and the wort is starting to roil away happily. 
 
I have thought that this "scum" is related to "hot break" and that you 
don't lose anything by getting rid of it, as you don't want hot break in 
your fermenter anyway. 
 
Hmmm.

Subject: Reinheitsgebot


  I did a quick web search and found a version of the German 
  Purity Law in German at <http://www.beir.de/b-020d.html>. 
  The text printed there seems to match the translation that 
  Michael Gerholdt (gerholdt`at`ait.fredonia.edu) posted here. 
 
  The text states "gersten, hopfen un wasser" where gersten 
  means barley.  Gerstenmalz would be barley malt. 
 
  (According to this site, there was also a brewer's oath that 
  predates the 1516 Reinheitsgebot.  It also says "barley, 
  hops and water".) 
 
  There is a 1987 law that updates the old law.  It uses 
  Gestenmalz, but allows some other adjuncts under certain 
  conditions.  See the English translation at 
  <http://www.acadiau.ca/cc/alan/brew/info/reinheitsgebot-e.html> 
  or the German version at 
  <http://www.acadiau.ca/cc/alan/brew/info/reinheitsgebot-d.html> 
 
  Finally, I've heard that European law supersedes the 1987 
  law.

Subject: Rinsing bleach


I'm a few days behind on my digests so I hope I'm not 
repeating, but bleach is not hard to rinse.  Here is why I say that: 
 
My sterilzation (oops) method is as follows: at the beginning of the 
brew day I make up some 50 ppm bleach in a clean bucket.  This 
is my rinse water. (All you guys who rinse with hot water: think 
about it--you are recontaminating what you just "sanitized."  It 
may work for you and if it does, why worry, but it doesn't seem 
to me like the best method.)  By letting it sit at this concentration 
for a few hours I feel confident that the water itself, if not the 
container, is bug-free.  I use very high concentrations of 
bleach on my equipment, like 1 oz bleach/gal (actually a good 
splash).  I then rinse with the above rinse water.  I rinse 
by adding ~14 oz of the rinse water to the carboy and swirling 
it around to touch all the surfaces.  I do two rinses. 
 
Using the same bleach test papers that I use to make the rinse 
water to 50 ppm, I have tested the concentration of the first 
rinse coming out.  It was indistinguishable from 50 ppm (which 
means it was less than about 70 ppm).  Since the residue on the 
carboy is ~500 ppm one would have to argue that bleach is so hard 
to rinse that it is stuck to the glass and so I don't see it coming 
out.  If this were the case, the second rinse wouldn't get it 
out and it would be mixed with my beer.  Since I don't get 
off flavors, either 1)you can not effectively rinse really strong 
bleach from your equipment without worry or 2)bleach is easy to rinse. 
 
Note: no need to use hot water, mine's at room temperature.

I find this hard to believe since it would no longer be an effective 
product for whitening clothes.  Laundry detergent already provides 
the high pH environment that lye would offer as a cleaning agent. 
Just smell the bottle, it would be easy to tell if there is chlorine 
bleach in it.

A translated excerpt from the "current" German beer purity law was 
posted to alt.beer in 1993 by John Dieter Stuewe (at the time, 
jds`at`uni-paderborn.de).  I excerpt it further here.  The translation is 
quite literal (e.g. "low fermented" meaning "bottom fermented"). 
 
 
Brewing Beer 
 
( 1) For brewing low fermented beer may only be used barley-malt, 
     hops, yeast and water, except of the prescriptions in the 
     paragraphs (4) to (6). 
 
( 2) The brewing of top fermented beer is subjected to the same 
     prescription; however the use of other malt and the use of 
     technical pure cane- , beet- invert- or starch sugar and 
     colour-matter made out of the sugar described above is allowed 
     too. 
 
( 3) Malt means every type of grain, that is artificially made 
     sprouting. 
 
 
I found the full text of his message at

It also seems clear that the 1516 law said "Gersten", which translates 
as "barley".  At one time, I thought I found a facsimile copy of the 
original proclamation on-line, but I can't locate it now.

Well, I used to think this as well. I use a converted sanke keg, and 
there is lots of room for the foam to rise. Most brews wont make it to 
the top and over, BUT, if you turn your back it, the gods get angry. 
 
I had gone into the house to get something, and returned to one of the 
worst boilovers I have seen. Real fun cleaning the guck out of the ring

This foam/film only contains hop residue if you've already added hops to the 
boil (how do you like *that* logic?).  If you boil your wort for 15 minutes 
before your first hops addition, you can skim off the foam without removing 
any good stuff.

This may be a good argument for flame-thrower type burners. To avoid boil 
over, I add ice cubes as necessary. To avoid boil over clean-up, I brew 
outside. 
 
When composting, it is always best to turn the pile to get some of the 
organisms in the pile on top of the grains to speed the process (and cover 
the stench!). I dumped all my kettle break/hop residue and fermenter trub 
into a large flower pot during the course of the winter (over 200 gallons 
worth) and then planted tomatoes and hot peppers in the pot this spring. 
The plants are doing wonderful and show no ill effects from hop/trub/yeast 
poisoning. 
 
Is it feasible to paint a sanke keg with engine paint or will paint peel 
or scratch right off stainless steel? I thought about painting my sankes 
black (external only of course) since they are impossible to keep clean. 
 
Who can tell me the proper amount of what S.G. wort to krausen a 5 gallon 
corny keg to carbonate? Is there some kind of formula to use?

Excellent points from our resident indigenous beer authority!  Bill

even though I cant remember exactly what it was supposed to be. It 
was not bad at all, certainly quite milky and a bit scary to us

I thought it was the other way around... calcium reacts with with 
something like H2PO4- to release two H+ and precipitate as calcium 
phosphate.  Is that close?

I've read both... that magnesium is a laxative and that sulphate is a 
laxative.  Which is it?  I know that Burton-on-Trent water is relatively 
high in both *naturally* so that Burtonised water could very well produce 
laxative beer regardless of which ion is the culprit.  I would like to know 
which it is, nonetheless -- my guess is it's the magnesium. 
 
As for cheap bittering, I don't believe it. Why would a brewer choose to 
use magnesium sulphate to increase sulphate if he/she could use gypsum 
(calcium sulphate) and add calcium too?

I agree on the 2nd and 3rd effects and have read the 1st, but have always 
been skeptical.  I think that alkaline mashes produce harsher beer due to 
the tannins that they extract from the husks and hops.  I think this harshness 
is from astringency not anything to do with actual hop bitterness changes. 
I feel that tannin extraction is the primary flavour difference when doing 
a high pH mash.

Isabel-- 
The place for such questions is private email, not the HBD.  The HBD

Despite the fact that everything we post has an implicit copyright,

You apparently are unaware of the fact that there is a company selling

at some point in future, I plan to take this company to court and to get 
them to return all profits from the sales of the HBD.  The rightful 
owners are the authors of the posts but distribution would be tricky 
and impractical and just the distribution costs would probably bankrupt 
the company.  I think the proper place for the money to go would be the 
AOB since they are now taking on the burden of distributing the HBD.

     Please excuse any breeches of etiquette, this is my first time. 
        In response to Mark Warrington's inquiry re: Elk Mountain.  The 
     stuff exists here in the Chicago market.  Doesn't AB market this under 
     the "Specialty Brewing" name?  A crafty way to make people think the 
     product is from a micro or craft brewer.  They do the same with Red 
     Wolf.  Maybe AB is trying to do for darker brews what they did to 
     lager beer (Budweiser); make a beer that appeals to all beer drinkers. 
     Of interest are a few specialty/craft type brews produced for the 
     local market that I tasted after the AB tour in St. Louis recently. 
     Faust (a pre-prohibition lager), Muenchener (an amber lager) and Black 
     and Tan (something of a Porter-ish brew).  The lager was good and 
     shows that AB can really make a lager worth drinking.  The Muenchener 
     was any thing but.  It tasted more like Brown Ale.  I don't thing the 
     mash tank saw anything that resembled Munich Malt.  And the Black and 
     Tan was okay, but the guy would only pour a little in the bottom of my 
     cup with the admonition that it was very heavy and that I might want 
     to sip it first to see if I liked it.  You know, I might be one of 
     those Bud drinkers or something. 
        Hey, does the homebrew competition at FX Matts include the original 
     Matts' corn lager style that I used to buy when I was in college?  If 
     so, should entries be submitted in an old Matts' beer ball?  Just 
     wondering.

Subject: HSA (Hot Something Aeration)


Dear Collective, 
 
With your extensive and unknowing help I have successfully put my first 
all-grain ale to my fermenter and its happily gurgling away. THANKS! 
 
Now my question: 
Hot Aeration has been discussed up and down both here and in R.C.B.. 
Generally thought of as a bad thing, stale flavors, etc.  I had minimized 
this with my extract brews, greatly improving the flavor and shelf life of 
my beer. 
When sparging my grain with a rotating sparge arm, I noticed ample 
opportunity for aeration and this brings up two theories I would like you 
to criticize: 
1) aeration poses no danger until the addition of hops 
 
2) aeration of sparge water is minimal, as very little air can dissolve 
into 168F water.  The danger to wort is that the oxygen is reacting with 
the wort at a rate close to the rate oxygen is dissolving into the wort. 
 
 
A reasonable analogy is filling a lauter tun with the spigot open.  As you 
fill the tun, the water leaks out the spigot, sorta like oxygen moving 
from the air into a dissolved state(in the tun) through a reaction (out 
the spigot). 
 
Dave B., Al K., and everyone else,  it's open season! :)

Aaron Herrick

Naw! That's TOO much engineering. Think more in terms of mega, maxi, micro

I really liked this idea, and was going to try it on a pyment that is currently
over-staying it's welcome in my secondary. I guess I should have questioned if 
140F for an hour was enough to kill yeast (won't 160F for 15-30 minutes 
pasteurize????).  I don't know how this temperature compares to in-transit 
shipments, but the rapid temp rise of the water may also be a factor in killing
(or shocking) the yeast than a gradual rise to a lower temperature over a 
greater period of time. 
 
Russell, did you ever end up trying this?  Has anyone had any experience with 
this? Gee, if we kill all the yeast, we may solve that embarrassing homebrew - 
flatulence connection!
