Subject: Lambics???


Hello, 
 
 I am a fairly new homebrewer and, despite this fact, myself a few fellow 
homebrewers are interested in brewing up a Lambic.  We have done some 
reading and realize this to be quite an undertaking, but wish to try it 
anyway.  Does anyone have any advice on how we might get started, any 
recipes, tips etc.?

My pal and I are new brewbies, and have been reading the Digest for 
a few weeks and learning a lot.  We've done about 6 or 7 batches with 
some success, and we now have a disagreement on some of what is going 
on. 
 
Currently, our process goes about like this: boil ~1.5 gal water, 
add can liquid malt (usu 3.3 lbs dark or amber), add bag dry malt 
(usu 3 lbs dark or amber), and boil ~15 min.  Add hops (usu ~12% AA) 
and boil ~20 min. Usually we add ~5 lbs honey at this point (we both 
like it strong, and hope to get some of the flavor).  Then add hops 
in hop bag, boil about 10 min more.  Big plastic bucket for a week, 
then carboy for a week, then bottle.  The sludge is left behind for 
both racking and bottling. 
 
Item: We're both pretty broke right now, and can't invest in new 
      equipment for a while. 
Item: There's a lot of people drinking the brew (especially me), 
      so it disappears nearly as fast as it gets created. 
 
Problem: He wants better beer through aging, I want more beer faster. 
 
Question: The bittering hops are loose in the wort and go into the 
          primary fermenter.  Is this good, bad, or indifferent? 
          What effect would extending the time on these (used) hops 
          have? 
 
Question: What effect would extending the time in the secondary have? 
          There usually isn't any bubbling (or very slow) after the 
          week in the primary, and none at all after a week in the 
          secondary.  Is there benefit to letting it sit longer before 
          bottling? 
 
Question: We made a 'blond' beer (usually we make dark).  When we 
          racked it to the secondary, my friend commented how it was 
          difficult to tell the difference between it and the mead 
          next to it (both a sunny yellow).  The carboys stay in a 
          fairly dark, cool, extra bathroom downstairs.  When we came 
          back to bottle a week later, it had turned DARK. VERY DARK. 
          What happened?? BTW, we bottled it anyway, and haven't 
          tasted it yet. 
 
Question: I've read numerous entries on how to safely bubble the beer 
          using airpumps, airstones, and whatnot.  Why?  What benefit 
          is there in A) oxygenating the beer or B) agitating (gently 
          shaking, not insulting) the beer? 
 
 
My apologies if any of these are so obvious anyone should know them, 
or if they are a recent thread and I missed it somehow, or if I 
misunderstood the recent 'bubbling' thread.  Please email me at 
gmac`at`websys.com if you do not want to bloat the digest with loads 
of basic info. 
 
Thanks much!!

Subject: just my 2 cents on the boilover thread


There is a technique that I find quite effective in preventing boil overs 
that I have not seen anyone else mention.  I wait to add the hops until the 
wort is boiling vigorously.  This seems to prevent the foam at the top from 
getting as thick, probably due to the strong convection currents in the brew 
pot.  I have not had a boil over since I started doing this.

Subject: Wringing hop/grain bags


 
I brew partial grain beers and have developed a baseline routine that I 
use for all my beers. I usually fill my grain bag with my grains and bring 
it up to 150-160 for about 45 minutes before adding extract and bringing 
to a boil. During this initial 45 minutes, I bring another gallon of water to 
around 175 in a separate pot. I have a fear of missing out on some sugars 
when I pull my grain bag out of the boiling pot so I pour the 1 gallon of 
water over the grain bag while holding the grain bag in the air. Then I 
squeeze the heck out of the grain bag with my hands (yes, it hurts) to 
get all I can from the grain bag. with 4 lbs. of grains in there, there is alot
of wort hiding in that bag. Am I causing aeartion when I shouldn't be? 
Also, is this necessary on my part? I do the same with my hop bags. I 
don't want to lose out on any hop character anywhere. Am I blowing it 
or does everyone do it this way? Thanks for any help.

Good day brewers, 
 I am about to try dry hopping for the first time.  I am using homegrown 
hops.  The hops have already been dried and are packaged in the freezer.  The 
question I have is "do the hops need any special attention or should I just 
chuck them in the secondary?, also is there any risk of contamination from 
homegrown hops?." 
Your collective wisdom is greatly appreciated.

Subject: In Need of A Recipe


     Has anyone ever seen a recipe for or made beer with the herb *Cost 
     Mary* (also known as Bible Leaf)?  I have an herb garden with 2 huge 
     plants that have plenty of leaves just beggin' to be utilized.  I read 
     in an herb book that Cost Mary was used through the 18th century in 
     English ales (there was a belief that hops were not too good for you). 
     If you do have a clue, are the leaves supposed to be used fresh or 
     dried? 
 
     Right on, right on, to Bill Ridgely re: Sorghum.  Thanks for setting 
     the Eurocentrists straight.  I suggest they check out the Discovery 
     Channel (no spam intended) program Pharaohs' Liquid Gold.  Seems as 
     though Scottish & Newcastle Brewing found the ancient Egyptian brewing 
     tradition interesting enough to fund an archeological team to find out 
     what ingredients were in the beer made way back when.

I see.  I usually add my hops right before the boil has started--at the 
simmer if you will.  I've found that I get significantly more bittering 
doing it this way.  I have no idea why.  However, if I'm using whole 
flowers as opposed to plugs or pellets,  I throw a handful in right after I 
get the rolling boil--then no probs.  (When I tried this with plugs or 
pellets....the resulting disaster convinced me it was a BAD idea.)

I've tasted the "scum".  It definately is bitter.

I think that you are right.  I've found the more "scum" I have in a boil, 
the larger quantity of hot break I end up with. 
 
Any other thoughts out there?

That looked way off, so I checked Terry Foster's _Pale Ale_.  He says that 
1 gram of gypsum per gallon will give 150 ppm sulphate (and 60 ppm 
calcium).  He also ways that 1 tsp weighs 5 grams, so 1 tsp gypsum per 
gallon will give about *750 ppm* sulphate.  Looks like a brain cramp, Al.

Subject: Brewing water still


Good evening, 
 
>>Al K 
 you need to make sure there is enough 
sulphate in the water and then you may have to adjust the pH down with 
calcium carbonate so the pH is not too low (it depends on your water). 
<< 
I hope you mean mash and adjust the pH down?  Am I supposed to jump up? 
 
Still the answer to the question hasn't been answered.  How  much SO4  is 
required to "Burtonize" the water?  60 ppm.  150 ppm or 270 ppm.  What 
does the magnesium in Burton water have to do with the bittering of the 
beer? 
>>Al K: 
 Alternatively, you could add lactic or phosphoric acids 
to lower pH without adding sulphate.  I believe that these acids do pull 
calcium out of the water (AJ?) so that you could end up with not enough 
to protect enzymes or form beerstone. 
>> 
I use lactic acid to adjust the sparge water, works great helps keep the 
tannins down.  If your water has little or no calcium such as my water 
and Pilsen water and you do not want SO4 in the beer then what is the 
alternative.  Beerstone has not been a problem, and filters make pretty 
beer fast. 
 
>>Al K: 
Correct, but it does make it *easier* to brew. 
<< 
 
I have done both I find very little difference in using an acid rest, 
adding gypsum or lactic acid.  How and why do you think it is easier? 
Then what?  If you really want it easy you go to your friendly packy 
store and you buy the beer.  I don't brew to make it easy I brew to brew 
beer that is as good or better then commercial examples and if it is not 
I dump the beer I have brewed!! 
 
Lets go in another tack.  Must I adjust my very soft water in order to 
brew Munich style beers?  Why?  I have brewed some very lovely bocks and 
dunkels and helles with no adjustment at all.  Should you adjust soft 
water for  these beers? 
 
Still haven't answered the question.  I want to know how much is enough?

I use a cooler for a mash/lauter tun and do overnight mashes all the time. 
Typically I use 25 to 35 lbs of grain for a 10 gallon batch O' brew. I'll 
heat my mash water to 180 degrees and mix at a rate of 1 qt. per pound of 
grain. It almost always mashes in at around 153 degrees. By 9:00 the next 
morning, the temp has usually not dropped below 148 to 149 degrees. There's 
a lot of mass and it's a good cooler. I like this procedure. It saves me a 
lot of time on brew day.

Subject: GELATINE


I have a question for the Dr Gelatine: 
 
Now that I have no fear of killing my gelatine or causing it unnecessary 
pain and anguish by boiling it, I have developed another quandry. 
 
Because my fermenter is only 10 gallons, I brew my beer allowing for the 
addition of one gallon of brewing water at kegging time. 
 
Normally, I boil the water the night before I am going to keg to allow 
it to cool and precipitate some of the stuff in my well water.  There 
is usually a layer of sludge on the bottom and some stuff floating on 
the top.  Careful pouring leaves the sludge behind. 
 
Now the problem is that if I add gelatine to the boiling water and let 
it cool, the precipitate that settles out seems to be more substantial 
and sticks to the bottom of the kettle like glue. 
 
The question is:  Did I "use up" the gelatine by letting the water 
cool over night or will the brewing water with gelatine still function 
as a fining agent? 
 
No guessing now.

Subject: Sorghum beer - an SA homebrewer's point of view


 
In response to the the messages of Terry Tegner and Bill Ridgely within 
recent digest issues I'd like add the following comments. 
 
Sorghum beer is South Africa's original homebrew and only true indigenous 
beer. I'm therefore rather proud of it. It may not be a Belgian lambic but it 
is, when tradtionally made, "spontaneously fermented". It has a unique 
flavour and is ,IMHO, highly drinkable and thirst-quenching when fresh. A few 
days later, however, things change for the worse. It becomes far more 
alcoholic and sour and definitely an acquired taste. Mmm...hints of the 
difference between Belgian Faro Lambic versus Old Lambic? 
 
As to it not being a beer, I think many commercial lager brewers would 
like to encourage that view. However, substitute sorghum malt for barley malt 
and the brewing process is very similar. Sales of sorghum beer are about 4 
times higher than lager beer in South Africa, but as Bill has mentioned, 
there seems be growing culture that it is an inferior product to be seen 
drinking. A sad state of affairs in the eyes of a homebrewer who realises 
that this beer has played an important role in his countries cultural and 
homebrewing heritage. Finally, it remains a highly nutritious and 
thirst-quenching beer, the only beer-style unique to Africa, something 
well worth preserving and trying.

There has been much discussion about the Reinheitsgebot.  I would like to know 
if conditioning additives (adding gipsum to the mash and/or lactic acid to the

Does anybody know anything about sterilizing bottles, hops, hopbags, 
brewing parts etc. in the microwave?  Would this be an effective way to 
kill "nasties" that can cause infection in the brewing process?

Subject: RE: Reinheitsgebot


Considering all of the discussion lately regarding the finer 
points of the Reinheitsgebot, it seems appropriate to put this 
into some historical context. 
 
The Reinheitsgebot was proclaimed in the year 1516 to prohibit 
German brewers from putting bones and blood and other foul matter 
into their beer. 
 
At the same time, the Inca empire in South America, a 
civilization which had attained a very high degree of technology 
without a written language or knowledge of the wheel, and which 
boasted an economic system based entirely on a beer made from 
masticated corn, was reaching its zenith. 
 
This leads one to wonder which society was truely the more 
advanced. 
 
Cheers!

Subject: Berkeley Brews


Since moving to Berkeley 2 years ago, I have been hearing about the 
brewpubs that were planned to move in.  At that time, Hart (Pyramid) 
Brewing and Pacific Coast.  Now I also hear of one called Albany Brew Pub 
and Barbary Coast.  Supposedly, they were to open mid to late September, 
but the only one I have seen any significant progress on is Hart's 
establishment.  Does anyone out there have any ideas on when these are 
going to open? 
Also, on the local brew scene here, I just had a Bison Brewing "Juniper 
Smoked Ale."  It was very smooth with a slight herbal bite.  Not too 
hoppy, but high aroma.  Great counter to Indian food.  I was told that 
besides adding some actual berries and boughs to the brew tank, that the 
important step here was "Smoke clensing" of the tank.  How does this 
work?  Is it somewhat like burning a sulfar candle in wine casks? 
 
that's all

The tendency to boil over can be reduced (not eliminated!) by the use of 
boiling stones.  I throw about 5 old, bent bottle caps into the boil (rip 
out the plastic if it concerns you).  These will act as nucleation sites 
for large bubbles and as such reduce the risk of boil over.

Actually the legal protections do not entirely kick in unless said noun 
actually fills out the paperwork and submits it to the appropriate authority. 
 
Also the 'Fair Use' doctrine allows quite a bit of usage of said nouns posts 
without requiring permissions from said noun.

Subject: figuring SO4 ppm from gypsum additions


In HBD #2164 Al Korzonas <korz`at`pubs.ih.lucent.com> wrote: 
 
>1 teaspoon of gypsum (calcium sulphate) in 1 gallon of water will give 
>about 28 ppm of SO4. 
 
According to Papazian in TNCJOHB (around p. 270 or so) 1 tsp of gypsum 
dissolved in 5 gallons of water increases the SO4 concentration by 135 ppm, 
so 1 tsp in 1 gallon would boost SO4 by 675 ppm, not 28 ppm (looks like 
Al divided 135 by 5 instead of multiplying). 
 
But before taking that number as the gospel, consider this.  Gypsum and 
two other commonly-used brewing salts are hydrates, which means that one 
or more water molecules are an integral part of their crystal structures. 
The three salts I'm talking about are: 
 
    CaCl2*2H2O  calcium chloride 
    CaSO4*2H2O  calcium sulphate (gypsum) 
    MgSO4*7H2O  magnesium sulphate (Epsom salt) 
 
If you get out your periodic tables and do the math (don't worry, I already 
did it) you'll find that: 
 
    1 g CaCl2*2H2O contains 0.755 g CaCl2 and 0.245 g H2O 
    1 g CaSO4*2H2O contains 0.791 g CaSO4 and 0.209 g H2O 
    1 g MgSO4*7H2O contains 0.488 g MgSO4 and 0.512 g H2O 
 
What's the point of this chemistry mini-lesson?  If you forget that these 
salts contain water in their crystal structures, you will make mistakes when 
figuring out the amounts to use when adjusting your brewing water (the water 
will have less ppms than you think you have added). 
 
If any of you know accurate mass-to-volume ratios for these three salts I can 
figure out whether the ppm numbers Papazian gives on this page (again, that's 
p. 270 or so) are correct.

Unless, like most (I think) of us all grain brewers, you boil the wort for     
     some period prior to adding hops (I usually boil 10 to 15 minutes - long 
     enough to get a good hot break).  In this case, no hop constituents are 
     removed by the skimming, which I do.  By the time I add the hops (whole), 
     the wort has settled down and stopped trying to get out of the kettle.  I 
     use a half-barrel converted keg for a kettle on a jet burner so this is 
important to me. I had a 5 gallon batch boil over once in the 15.5 gallon      
     kettle.  I usually brew 10 gallon batches these days and I watch it more 
     closely!

Subject: Jet burners


Sorry, I missed the request for information on these. I have a jet burner      
     (King Kooker I think) and, while it is admittedly gas hungry, I have no 
     problems with soot or flame color (always blue).  I can turn it down and 
also use the deflector plate for fine adjustment. Also, I have had exactly     
zero problems with scorching. If you want to get to boiling quickly, these     
are hard to beat. I could see having a ring style burner as well if I set      
     up a RIMS or manual multi-vessel brewery.  Bottom line is that I am 
     perfectly happy with my Harrier. ;-)
