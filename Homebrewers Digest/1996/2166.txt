Subject: New Copyright Notice


As the request of the members of the Homebrew Digest, I have added a 
guideline to the banner regarding the copyright of the HBD.  I would 
like to point out that the copyright of the HBD is precarious at best. 
In accordance with U.S. copyright law, posts are the property of the 
original poster.  The HBD may NOT be legally reprinted for profit and 
at this point I very much doubt that the HBD could even give permission 
for reprints of the archives.  People have done so before without 
asking permission, which, at best case, is quite rude.  Previously, as 
a FREE service, the HBD has never had any money to fight illicit 
reproduction of the HBD.  The HBD's current sponsors have better 
lawyers. 
 
I am not a copyright lawyer, but there are some common misconceptions 
running around that I'd like to take this opportunity to step on: 
 
1.  Copyright law varies when used Internationally (and the HBD is 
distributed Internationally).  Chinese can copy the HBD and sell it for 
$1,000,000 a copy, Americans can't.  (U.S. copyright laws don't work in 
China.)  Most countries will honor the U.S. copyright claim of the HBD. 
 
2.  ANY written or otherwise created material IS copyrighted from the 
time of it's creation according to U.S. copyright law.  Such material 
does NOT have to be registered with any authorities, however: 
 
3.  It is difficult to prove the actual creation date of a work unless 
a copyright is registered with the copyright office.  Since the HBD is 
published on a regular basis and widely distributed, it would be a bit 
easier to prove copyright claims than for one's regular casual e-mail, 
even though the paperwork is not filed.  Paperwork filing is great if 
you have a book or story you want to sell and are afraid that the 
people you send it to will try to steal it.  If you've already sold a 
million copy best seller, filing paperwork on it is going to be a bit 
redundant.  (But if your book's worth that much it only costs a few 
dollars, so you might as well be protected.) 
 
4.  I'm not a copyright lawyer, so you should contact one if this is a 
dire concern of yours.  If you intend to copy the HBD and sell it, 
perhaps your lawyer should then contact ours. 
 
I've had enough of this thread and I truly believe that it's quite 
pathetic that the Internet has fallen to such levels.  The free sharing 
of ideas used to be a strong feature of the 'net, but now everyone just 
wants to figure out how to use someone else's ideas to make a quick 
buck.

i've always read that the danger is in aerating the mash liquor, or wort, and 
not the sparge water.  from what i recall, aerating wort, particularly for 
darker styles, oxidizes melanoidins which leads to quicker staling and off 
flavors.  unoxidized melanoidins help preserve the stability of the beer in 
the bottle, so if you oxidize them early (during wort handling, pre-boil), 
you lose their ability to help preserve your beer flavor later.  boiling 
the wort does not undo this oxidation of melanoidins.  there may be other 
effects of oxidation other than this one; i'm not positive. 
 
just to clarify this now, because i know somebody out there might misinterpret 
it, this is hot side aeration, during mashing and sparging, pre-boil, and 
not aerating cold wort post boil to help dissolve oxygen into the cooled wort. 
 
i can definitely say that in my experience, your proposition #1 above is not 
likely to be true.  i say this because of a homebrew that was tasted at a 
meeting of the st louis brews ( i AM affiliated and PROUD of it) a while ago, 
which displayed tremendous oxidation characteristics.  it was a pale ale, i 
believe, and we quizzed the brewer to try and determine the problem.  finally, 
it was discovered that his outlet from his lauter tun had no hose affixed, and 
the mash liquor was allowed to splash into the collecting vessel (grant,kettle)
for the entire process of vorlauf and sparging.  this was the last thing we 
asked about, after quizzing him on racking and post boil procedures. we decided
this was probably the cause.  so his oxidation problems occurred as a result 
of mash handling, before the hops were probably even out of the freezer. 
again, this beer was heavily oxidized, and not that old as i recall. we really 
dissected his method. 
 
now, just to confuse the issue, i've heard a lot of debate on this topic, 
about how microbrewers all across the country heavily oxidize their mashes 
and wort during mashing and sparging, and how it makes no difference because 
their beer turns out fine.  i'm not sure i believe this, really.  maybe if 
you drink a microbrew that's very fresh, you notice no flavor problems.  but, 
let that beer sit in the bottle for a few months and then see what happens. 
 
there was an interesting article in consumer reports recently that rated beers,
including mega-brewery products and microbrews.  it was quite shocking, 
really, what they concluded with regard to how the beers stacked up, flavor- 
wise. 
 
why take a chance?  be gentle with your wort.  i'm curious to know what others 
think about this issue.  i'm sure it's been covered, but i haven't been around 
that long in this forum.

If you have kegging equip. you can just fill a keg with water and put it 
in the frig. and chill over night. After your boil, just hook up the keg 
to your chiller and blow the cold water through the chiller with CO2 at 
what ever flow you like. I guess you could put your keg higher than your 
kettle and use gravity, but CO2 is cheap.

Damn!  Indeed a brain cramp.  Initially, I wrote 141.5 ppm of SO4 from 
1tsp in 5gal.  Then, I figured that this would imply something tied to 
5 gallons and would be misleading.  So, I figured it would be better to 
give it in ppm from 1tsp in 1 gallon.  In stead of punching "x 5" keys on 
the calculator, I must have hit "/ 5" which gave me the wrong number. 
What I meant to say was that 1 teaspoon of gypsum in 1 gallon gives 
about 708 ppm of SO4.  Sorry about that.

Greetings fellow brewers, 
 
Question:  Has anyone on this collective used 15.5 gal half barrels 
for kegging homebrew?  I have acquired one of these kegs from a friend 
who never returned it after a party.  After it sat in his garage for 
three months, it's been sitting in mine for the past two. 
 
I'm at the point where I should do something with it or perhaps turn 
it back for whatever deposit I can get.  If you have any information 
regarding using these kegs, I'd greatly appreciate it. 
 
thanx, 
 
A fellow brewer.

Subject: Partial Sparging / Gypseous Brain Cramp / How Much = Enough SO4


Billy Cole had a question about his partial-mash sparge technique. 
 
A friend of mine who makes killer partial mash beer uses a similar technique, 
but bagged the sparge when he discovered a simpler way.  After you remove the 
grain bag from the first pot, and drain it, dip and bob the bag int he second 
pot to rinse it.  Drain the bag well again, then simply combine the waters. 
 He says the second rinse is very complete amd effective.  I posted this a 
while back here, and some folks were concerned with getting lots of husk 
material and possible other effects, but I haven't tasted any negative 
results in the final product. 
 
Jeff Renner diagnoses AlK's brain cramp: 
 
> That looked way off, so I checked Terry Foster's _Pale Ale_.  He says that

> gallon will give about *750 ppm* sulphate.  Looks like a brain cramp, Al. 
 
Let's take another look at the x-ray, doc. 
 
When I wrote BreWater, I included a teaspoon/grams option.  I checked my 
several references for grams to teaspoons conversions and found many wide 
discrepancies.  So I got my friend's digital milligram scale and started 
weighing.  I scooped out several tablespoons' worth of salt, then divided by 
the equivalent *teaspoons* to get the answer (big average).  I came up with 5 
grams per teaspoon, which is what's in BreWater. 
 
Recently I obtained my own balance scale, and feeling that 5 grams seemed a 
lot, I reweighed the salts.  All my other salts were pretty close but I came 
up with something like 2.6 grams per tablespoon of gypsum! 
 
Part of the problem is that gypsum compacts or fluffs more than the other 
common brewing salts because it's so powdery.  I also found that the weight 
ratios between 1/4, 1/2, 1 tsp, and 1 tblsp did not hold up as I weighed the 
varying volumes on the same scale! 
 
I strongly advocate weighing your salts, not scooping them!  Especially 
gypsum.  However, I realize that a sensitive scale is not cheap, but finding 
one (garage sales?  surplus stores?  pawn shops?) is a worthwhile adventure 
if you're serious about accurate water treatment.  Otherwise, just be sure to 
scoop but don't pack it -- you'll get better results.

Pale Ales brewed with El Paso tap water (SO4 ~ 150 ppm) does not seem to have 
the characteristic pleasant hop "bite" that the 350 ppm's in my Pail Ale 
gave.  Based on that I'd put a number of about 200 - 250 ppm as a lower limit 
to the amount of SO4 to get that "Burton" flair.  Just a guess (sorry JS). 
 
Magnesium is unpleasantly bitter in concentrations of around 30 ppm or more. 
 I guess the speculation was that adding magnesium would supply a bitterness 
(however unpleasant) more cheaply than the equivalent (and more expensive) 
amount of hops.

Orville Deutchman (orion`at`mdc.net) comments on  a heater element 
[Incoloy elements (5500W `at` 240V)] recommendation: 
 
SNIP>>> 
All well and good if you are propared to deal with a whopping 240 volts! 
This is not a toy that gets plugged into the 115 volt outlet! 
<<< 
Actually, KennyEddy discussed this a lot better than I ever could back 
when he first built his all-electric plastic brewery. 
 
The element has an AC resistance due to its design and material 
properties, independant of voltage (Assuming pure resistance, which is 
close enough in this example). 
 
This resistance causes the element to pull a current from the line, 22.9 
Amps approximately at 240 V.  Current equals Power divided by Voltage 
(I = P/V).  In this example Resistance equals Voltage divided by current 
or 10.5 Ohms.  Power also equals Current squared times resistance, in 
this case 5500 Watts. 
 
If you connected this element to 120 V, the resistance would not change, 
it would still be 10.5 Ohms.  Current, V/R would be 120 divided by 10.5, 
or 11.4 Amps.  This is half of the current in the 240 Volt case as 
expected.  Hardly a crisis.  Power would be reduced however:  I 
squared times R equals 11.4 *11.4 * 10.5 equals approximately 1375 
Watts, or _one-quarter_ of the power in the 240 V case.  You won't get 
a boil nearly so fast, but there certainly is no danger in using the element 
this way.  As I recall, Ken had the abilityy to switch between 240 V and 
120 V depending on if he was trying to get to boil in a hurry, versus a 
more delicate mashing or boiling operation.  I hope Ken adds to the 
thread. 
 
Orville then says, 
>>> 
You carefully wire it direct into your panel, and hope for the best. Don't 
get stung by this baby! 
<<< 
To which I say, DON'T EVER, EVER, EVEN THINK OF WIRING 
_ANYTHING_ DIRECTLY TO YOUR PANEL!  Use a 240 V receptacle 
intended for such an application.  If I recall the NEC correctly, the circuit 
should be good for at least 30 A for a 22.9 A load.  So should the fuse or 
circuit breaker protecting the circuit. 
 
Basically most home panels are rated for 100 A or more and the first line 
of protection is the fuse on the transformer primary which is sized to 
allow 150 percent overload or so.  What this means, kids, is that 
something else will burn first, and that will most likely be your element or 
the wires connecting it to your panel.  Any anything close enough to get 
hot along the melting wire.  Not something to mess around with. 
 
Sorry for the long windedness.  That's the cool thing about the HBD, 
though, sometimes the microbiologists, metallurgists and chemists get to 
go off, other times its us EE's.

I'm not sure what your concern is... This doesn't put OUT 240V, it's just 
a resistor.  Obviously, you need to have some know-how in order to be 
wiring electrical devices.  If you do, then this is no more dangerous than 
any of the other electrical appliances in your household.  And I'm not 
sure what you mean by 'commercial applications', this is probably no 
different than the heater in your home water heater! 
 
BTW, this usually IS plugged into a 115V outlet... That way, you get even 
lower power density, as it now drops down to something close to 1375W.

Your wait is fine. However; take the specialty grains out of the brewwater 
after the 45mins. Don't boil your grains. If you bring them over 170F you 
have a good chance of extracting tannins into the wort. Which is the way 
to get a real 'beer face' (puckered up because of the astringency).

I know that this must be okay because so many commercial brewers have 
a similar distribution of sparge water.  I believe that the main reason 
this is not as terrible as it may seem is because the steam rising from 
the grain bed tends to purge out the oxygen in the lauter tun.  Personally, 
I just run the sparge water through a tube that is positioned below the 
level of the water in the tun.  I keep 1" or so of water above the grain 
bed and run the new sparge water into that 1".  If you do use one of 
these sprinkling sparge arms, I would put a lid on the tun, covering all 
but a small opening.  Not only will this keep the steam contained and 
minimize oxygen in the tun headspace, but also it will retain heat (which 
is probably a lot more important).

On the contrary... I brew year `round.  I've brewed about 15 batches since 
Memorial Day.  The key is that in the summer, I *must* use filtered air or 
oxygen for aeration/oxygenation.  If I don't, I get a wild yeast infection.

arrives early.  This Saturday, I'm brewing again.  YIPPEE! 
 
I'm a huge fan of Wyeast 1056, which has given me excellent results.  However, 
my local supplier was out of that particular type, and suggested I try the 
Wyeast American II.  (Number was 1112 or something like that.)  If anyone of 
you gurus has experience with these two and can let me know what to expect 
with it, I would greatly appreciate it. 
 
I have a King Cooker jet engine, and yes, it uses fuel like mad and makes 
noise.  The biggest concern I have had is the soot produced at less than full 
blast.  It forms on my Vollrath stainless 10 gallon pot.  Here's what I do: 
After the boil, whiIe cooling, I spray the outside with the outflow from my 
immersion chiller.  It washes off quite well.  For the metallurgists of you 
out there....will this thermal shock weaken my pot?  It sure works well.....

Chris, 
 
I can uderstand your problem. As an aparment dweller myself, I have often 
wondered what my neighbors might think if I tried to make smoked malt. 
 
You could always by a "smokey joe" charcoal cooker (for smoking meat) and use 
it
outdoors to smoke your grain. It would be relatively inexpensive (under $100) 
and you could use whatever wood you wanted! 
 
Mail-order sources are plentiful, but their selection is not. Most mail-order 
suppliers have only one or two types of smoked malt. The standard German Rauch 
malt seems to be the most commonly available, and that wonderful Scottish Peat-
Smoked malt is becoming easier to get. Check with the following suppliers:

That should do for now. Also you might check in a recent issue of Zymurgy. 
There
are TONS of malt suppliers these days, and that mag is chock full of their 
adds.
Most have "800" numbers you can call, and offer free catalogs...

Wyeast 1272 has no business being associated with the Magnificent 1056. I 
brewed four batches with this demon and three of them were nowhere close 
to the 1056 version, in fact I didn't like them. The one time I used it 
to my liking was on a Rye beer which was split fermented with each yeast. 
The 1272 was better in this instance. YMMV. 1056 for President, Cascades' 
for V.P.

Subject: Lager yeasts and starters


I would like some information specific to making starters using lager yeasts. 
In particular, will these starters work and perform best if the starter is 
prepared so that the yeast culture is introduced to the starter medium in 
typical lager temperatures recommended for that particular strain of yeast? Or 
is it OK to start them at the same temperature that one pitches an ale yeast? 
Is thermal shock an issue if one introduces a lager starter pitched at ale 
yeast temps?  Any suggestions/recommendations/information would be greatly 
appreciated!

I'm going to have to get more sleep. 
 
I wrote (apparently):

What this should have said was, add the sulfate, mash-in, then measure 
the pH and adjust *UP* with calcium carbonate so it is not too low. 
 
As for how much to add, I suggest adding enough gypsum so your SO4 
level is 600 to 650 ppm.  As I corrected myself earilier today, 1 teaspoon 
of gypsum in 1 gallon of water gives about 708 ppm of sulfate.  If you 
have no sulfate in your water, I recommend that you add 0.85 teaspoons 
per gallon of gypsum to your water.

Nothing, to my knowledge.

If your water has a solid amount of calcium, you can brew pale beer with 
no additions of anything, no acid rest (more work, more time).   Back 
when brewers didn't understand water chemistry, all they knew was that 
some wells (and some regions) resulted in good beer and others did not. 
Dublin, Munich and London brewers brewed darker beers because pale beers 
didn't taste so good.  It wasn't until years later that they found out 
how to modify their waters so they could brew pale beers.

Munich water is characterised primarily by the 150 ppm of carbonate it has. 
It's also got about 75 ppm of calcium.  Munich Dunkels are not nearly as 
dark and the grains not nearly as acidic as, say, a stout.  I would say 
that you should be able to brew decent Munich Dunkels with soft water. 
The acidity should not be noticeable as opposed to stout brewed with soft 
water. 
 
London water also has 150 ppm of carbonate, but it also has quite 
a bit of sodium and sulfate too.  Soft water is a blessing.  It gives the 
most flexibility to the brewer.  If you don't want to muck with acid 
rests, you can add salts or acids.

The microwaves themselves won't kill the nasties (they are too small). 
You can, however, sanitize (not "sterilize!") the inside of a pyrex 
flask (for example) by boiling a few ounces of water in it.  The steam 
would be doing the sanitation not the waves.

I agree with Ken 100%.  I do use a gram scale and recommend that all small 
additions (salts, Irish Moss...) be weighed... teaspoons are much more 
common than gram scales, however.  Two additional sources for gram scales 
are American Science and Surplus (312-763-0313 or www.sciplus.com) 
and head shops (drug paraphernalia stores).  Even at AmSci&Surplus they are 
not cheap.  Mine is plastic and was around $15.00. 
 
>Magnesium is unpleasantly bitter in concentrations of around 30 ppm or more. 
 
I don't think so.  Both Burton-on-Trent and Vienna water have more than 
60 ppm of Magnesium.

All well and good if you are propared to deal with a whopping 240 volts! 
This is not a toy that gets plugged into the 115 volt outlet!

I think that if it is a low watt density element and you are planning to 
run it off 110 volts your choice is fine. A little pricey, but fine.

Subject: RE: BOIL OVERS


 like the rest, i too skim, as soon as the kettle is full. 
but two other items come to mind on boilovers: 
 proper head space 
 and proper heating source btu 
 
most of the home brewers i know use WAY too much horse power to boil 
the relative small volumes even in 10 gallon batches. this leave very 
little head space for the typical burners used. 
 
some calculations i use are anywhere from 30K to 40K btu per US barrel. 
this is for uninsulated single wall kettles. you only need to boil off 
5 to 10 percent of the volume, for ours we have 120K btu for 4bbl and get 
5 to 7 percent boil off in 90 min, with some power venting. 
 
some home brewers are using 60kbtu and more for 1/2bbl brew kettles. 
yeah - yeah it cuts the wait time down - i know.....been there done that, 
did not like it much... 
 
good brewing

Subject: Laxative, HSA,


Brewsters: 
 
In my exposition on metal ions tasting bitter or not, I forgot to answer AlK's 
question about the laxative properties of beer.  As far as I know, Tums ( 
calcium carbonate) are good for the tummy, but don't affect any other portion 
of
the digestive track. One of the uses for epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) other 
than a mineral bath is as a laxative. You may have heard the expression "going 
through like a dose of salts" That's the origin. I leave you with the thought  
that milk of magnesia ( magnesium hydroxide) is used as an antacid and a 
laxative. So magnesium is probably the culprit that gives beers mineralized 
with
too much epsom salts their laxative qualities. 
 
As to why they would use magnesium as well as calcium?  That would better 
emulate the Burton waters and you know if a little is good, well, why not add a
little more..... Magnesium should be similar to calcium in many ways, but maybe
it has other properties that calcium doesn't.  I don't know 
- ------------------------------------------------------------- 
As to Aaron Herrick's proposition that hops in beer are what causes it to get 
an
oxidized, stale flavor from HSA. Not a bad idea, should we leave the hops out? 
Until after the boil? Just kidding. Seriously, this is not a bad idea and kind 
of goes along with the staling taste being a little like using old hops. Plenty
of unsaturated bonds to get oxidized and isomerized. Both tastes, I believe, 
have been described as cardboardy, although I can't say I have ever tasted 
this.
My beer doesn't get stale and I use fresh hops Maybe a separate boil of hops in
a closed pan then cooled vs hot added with some oxidation in the air after the 
split  wort is cooled could help elucidate your answer.  It is an interesting 
topic which I think we don't pay enough attention to. Do you think Charlie 
Scandrett's steam wind theory is all hot air? 
 
Don't you mean"Brewing is a sport, *use* a cup"?

DI a!? ayyyyyRyyyyyyyyyyNDrice hulls in your sparger. Maybe if you just cooked 
(or microwaved, like I do acorn squash) the pumpkin with the peels on it and 
didn't puree it, you might not have the problem, I don't know.
 
I once had a girlfriend (Bonnie....what was her name?) for whom I bought a 
pumpkin to make a jack-o-lantern from. She turned it into a pumpkin pie!
 
Clever girl. But not clever enough. 
- -------------------------------------------------- 
Newbie brewbie asks for advice on his secondary. Your idea sounds OK. See my 
earlier (or later) comments. Welcome aboard!
- -------------------------------------------------- 
I was cruising through Zymurgy, Summer 1996, Vol 19 Number 2. I noticed on page
83 in the "Dear Professor" column that the professor said that Sorghum is the 
same as Millet. Boo! Send the prof back to grain school. Millet is Panicum 
miliaceum and Sorghum is Sorghum vulgare. I think I read this same identity 
comment in someone's book (maybe Pap?) but it is not true.
 
I believe I read that in Africa beer is made from sorghum ( I think down south)
and also millet (central and some north, non-Muslim countries). Anyone confirm 
or deny?
- -------------------------------------------------- 
AlK asks about the calcium reaction with phosphate. The answer is it is pH 
dependent which forms of phosphate are available. But I suspect calcium 
phosphate ( Ca3(PO4)2) is formed eventually since the reaction is driven by its
insolubility and as it forms, it releases hydrogen ions from the phosphoric 
acid, the H2PO4 and HPO4 ions into the solution. I suspect I was thinking about
the source of phosphoric acids as being the various phosphorous containing 
compounds in the malt and their need to be hydrolyzed to give phosphoric acid. 
I also think I speculated to myself that the Ca++ might speed up this process -
but I have no evidence of this.
 
I obviously didn't have my chemical brain in full forward the other day when I 
said the "Calcium releases phosphoric acid" I should have said "calcium 
releases *protons from the* phosphoric acids". Sorry about that.
- -------------------------------------------------- 
On the subject of calcium, it does more than just change the pH, it stabilizes 
the Alpha Amylase so it will stick around longer and continue to chew up the 
starch and some of the dextrins. Calcium also aids in the flocculation and 
sedimentation of yeast.
