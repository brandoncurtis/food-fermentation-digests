Assuming that by "pure resistance" you mean non-reactive, OK, but that's 
too simplistic.  Heating elements are not "pure resistance" independent of 
voltage. 
 
You can see this dramatically with a "heating element" that gets very hot-- 
e.g., a light bulb.  A 60-watt 120-volt bulb has a cold resistance of about 
18 ohms, but if you crank that through the ol' P = v^2 / r, you come up 
with 800 watts!  In fact, a 60-watt bulb *does* draw more than 10x its 
rated power when you first turn it on...but that makes it heat up, and the 
heat increases the resistance, and the increased resistance decreases the 
power. 
 
Now, a brewing heating element doesn't get anywhere near the temp of the 
filament of a light bulb, but there's still a non-negligible change in the 
resistance as it heats up, and there is an implication here.

This is wrong, because at 120 V the element will not get up to the opera- 
ting temperature implied by the power consumption at 240 V.  Randy's cal- 
culation of 1/4 as much power at 120 V as at 240 V is correct for the ideal 
resistor, but for a heating element it will be somewhat higher than 1/4. 
Since 1/4 of 5500W is 1375W, this moves the numbers into the realm where 
you want to start to think carefully.  A 15-amp 120V circuit is, in 
principle, good for 1800W, and it would be prudent not to get right on top 
of that.  You'll probably be over 1500W.  (Howzabout somebody take one of 
those 5500W elements and measure the cold resistance??  That will give us 
the other endpoint.)  So if you are on a 15A circuit, you want to be sure 
that your wiring is healthy and you're not trying to run much else on the 
same circuit. 
 
In almost all normal cases, there's no dire danger...it's no worse than 
when you start the coffeepot and the toaster on the same circuit at the 
same time, and it pops a breaker.  There are safety nets; you just want to 
stay out of 'em.

Few homes are on their own transformers.  The first line of protection is 
the per-circuit breaker (15 or 20 A) which is protecting the wiring to the 
outlet.  Second line of protection is the 100A-or-more mains breaker; if 
that pops you have screwed up big-time or you had a bad single-circuit 
breaker.  Don't even think about how big a screwup it takes to hit the 
transformer.

First of all, Summer Lightning is by the Hop Back Brewery and not 
Bunce's (although they are very close to each other, it's an easy 
mistake to make). Second, it's my favourite beer of all time, and 
readers of the UK Homebrew digest will know of my long term quest to 
clone this beer. Last night I racked 5 gallons of my latest version 
which has to be the closest I have ever got. The recipe I used is 
posted on the UK Homebrew web site: 
http://www.breworld.com/homebrew/ 
Use version two, and make the following changes. Use 25 g Goldings 
for the full boil, 15 g Goldings for the last 5 (NOT 15) minutes, and 
10 g Goldings to dry hop. I used the yeast from bottle conditioned 
Summer Lightning (which Hop Back are now exporting to the USA) in 
preference to the Wyeast German. Note that the recipe is for UK 
gallons and not US gallons. 
 
Enjoy.

Subject: Sorghum Beer Challenge


 
As a result of the recent discussion on sorghum beer in the Digest and 
private email (sorry I lost one, please resend) I've decided on a novel way 
of resolving the issue through a challenge. It's also time for me to give 
back something to the HBD after all I've taken over the years. The challenge 
works in the following manner: 
 
1.        Bill Ridgely and Terry Tegner post their sorghum 
          beer recipes and discussions thereof to the HBD. 
 
2.        I send sorghum malt to the first 3 takers of the 
          challenge. Sorry, limited quantities only, 
          international mail is expensive. (Send name and 
          postal address via private email.) 
 
3.        These folk brew a batch of sorghum beer. Drink it over 
          a period of days (punishment or pleasure depending on 
          your point of view). Finally, they post a description, 
          etc. of the beer to the HBD for discussion. 
 
The only possible problem that I can foresee could be with custom clearance 
of the malt by the 3 challenge takers. Any opinions? More importantly, any 
takers?  Russel you may get your wish after all. 
Bill? Terry? We're waiting :-)

     Greeetings fellow Brewers,  At the risk of appearing or sounding Anal 
     Retentive I submitt the following question which I know has been 
     responded to several times but I can't remember. 
 
     What are the chances of having an infected batch of Ale if one sees 
     clumps of what appears to be white moldy blotches on top of the ale in 
     its secondary?? 
     The other night I racked over a 5 gal batch and struggled through 
     several stuck siphons, got so frustrated I ended up quitting and 
     settlin' for 4 gallons and now I have these clumps of white mold on 
     the top of the Ale. 
 
     Any suggestions to what it may be?  I did during each re-siphon 
     process "dunk" the hose and racking cane into boiling water 
     momentarily follwed by a cold water rinse B4 re-introducing into the 
     primary. 
     I'd hate to dump this batch of Red Ale( Red as in Blood)which started 
     out at 1.062 and has dropped down to 1.010. 
 
     Thanks

I believe that if it were Spruce beer and the yeast clings to the north side

Subject: CD-ROM


Greetings from the (current) Focus of Evil in the Homebrew World: 
 
It has been with much amazement (and amusement) that I have read the 
posts about copyrights and the HBD.  People so worried that their own 
words, like "I pitched a Wyeast smak-pak straight into my barley wine 
and its been three days and no krausen....is my beer ruined?" could 
actually make people money. 
 
At the request of my wife (an attorney) I must now stand up and state 
that I am not "the guy" who put the HBD on CD-ROM.  I "confessed" to it 
just to view the righteous indignation of those who believe such a disk 
exists. 
 
What a view! 
 
Al e-mail's me a private threat to sue. 
Others post their 2 cents to the HBD....Shawn posts he has included a 
copyright notice in the HBD. Does that mean Al can drop *his* copyright 
notice?  Bets are he won't. Jethro Gump weighs in with his opinions, 
ending with"...bring on the lawyers!"  Remember, calling your attorney 
racks up billable time and he/she isn't going to forget when they find 
out I was pulling your leg. Kirk Fleming almost kinda defends the CD 
maker.  Russell Mast doesn't bite, but chastises everyone for not taking 
it off-line. Randy Erickson was the only person to actually seek more 
information before forming an opinion...He's probably laughing at all 
these responses like I am. 
 
Everyone, Pay Attention! 
Have you ever seen an advertisement for such a product? 
Have you ever seen the product? 
Do you have firsthand knowledge of anyone buying such a disk? 
 
If you answered no to the three questions above, then chances are THE 
DAMN THING DOES NOT EXIST!  Quitcherbitchin! 
 
Just what is the probability that a person who has a CD-ROM drive 
would not have access to an HBD archive?  Of that tiny minority, how 
many are going to buy this disk rather than get on the internet?  Small 
enough to approach zero? That's what I think.  Nobody's making any money 
off the HBD, except those who have improved their brewing skills to the 
point of going pro...and that ain't copyright infringement! 
 
Al has good brewing advice in general so I can't call him a lunatic, but 
his crusade against an imaginary injustice wears thin.  A copyright 
notice on his advice just intimidates novices and gives his advice "airs 
of legitimacy".  And if y'all are so concerned about copyrights, then 
why are you quoting from DeClerck, Richman, Foster, Zymurgy, Brewing 
Techniques, etc.  Did you get express permission from the authors of 
those texts to quote from them?  Hypocrisy, I tell ya. 
 
It's all been loads of fun but it should stop now.  If ya wanna continue 
whining about this, lets go offline....

In the past year or so, my local liquor store has not had Bigfoot

it was no longer being distributed "out east," although he wasn't sure 
why.  Since Maryland is nearly as far "east" as you can get in this country, 
I am now assuming the worst, which is that the non-availability of Bigfoot

A low cost brew pot has a very thin bottom. Since stainless has a fairly 
poor heat transfer, a thin pot will often scorch. I suspect this is 
contributing to the taste in you beer. You are better off staying with 
enamel than cheap stainless. Good stainless pots cost over a hundred for 10 
gal.

RE: Copy of: Pumpkin,Newbie, 
 
Brewsters: 
Part 2 
 
AlK asks about the source of the taste of various salts. On the subject of 
bitterness arising from the metal ion and/or the sulphate.  In the absence of 
absolute knowledge or a professional quote, I would vote for both, since I have
read it a number of times. I do know metal ions can impart bitterness, since I 
am too familiar with iron and manganese in water ( although at near neutral it 
could be the hydroxides - see below).  Sodium chloride has a hot taste and is 
reputed to impart a smoothing effect on beers.  Does this mean that sodium is 
not bitter?  I guess so. 
 
I speculate below: 
 
In Chemistry 101 we learn that basic things are bitter and acidic things are 
sour.  This was a way chemists evaluated new compounds -(sometimes to their 
detriment if their research subject was lead, mercury or arsenic compounds. 
ergo
"sugar of lead" - i think it is lead acetate).  So what is important in 
determining sour or bitter when a salt dissolves in water, is"what is the 
proton
ion to hydroxide ion ratio in the salt solution"? At 1:1 this is neutral and pH
= 7 so should be neither bitter nor sour. At greater than one, pH <7 acidic and
sour.  At less than one, pH >7, and bitter 
 
If one dissolves calcium sulfate in water it is probably ( I don't know) 
neutral to very slightly acidic since calcium is a weak base  and will take up 
hydroxide ions for it's formation of Ca(OH)+ (pKdiss = 2.6) and sulfate comes 
from a strong acid  but will take up protons for its formation of ( HSO4)- ion 
(pKdiss = 2.1). In all cases of divalent ions, Ca, Mg,CO3, SO4, there are two 
equilibria to complicate things, In the case of Mg, Ca, SO4 the first stage 
i.e.
M(OH)2 to M(OH)+ is 100% ionized. Not so in the case of carbonate, H2CO3 can 
exist in solution of CO2 as you know. Based on this, sodium sulfate should be 
alkaline, since the sulfate ion pulls protons out of solution to form some 
bisulfate ions (HSO4, pK = 2.1) and the pH should increase. Sodium chloride 
should be neutral since sodium is a strong base and hydrochloric acid is a 
strong acid, which may explain its hot, ionic taste, i.e. neither sour or 
bitter.  Calcium carbonate (pK = 7 and 11 for carbonic acid) is made up of a 
weak base and a weaker acid, so it is bitter. Sodium carbonate is made up of a 
strong base and a weak acid  and it is really bitter. I predict that calcium 
chloride will be neutral to sour since the Calcium ion will take up some 
hydroxide ions, whereas the chloride comes from a strong acid.. 
 
Although the first ionization for both Ca and Mg is 100% one could speculate 
that magnesium sulfate should be less bitter than calcium sulfate and a lot 
less
than sodium sulfate, since even though magnesium's first ionization is 100% pK 
=0 its second is 2.6, Ca's second pK = 1.2, pK and the sodium would not take up
any hydroxides leaving the sulfate to take up protons and shift the ratio in 
favor of the hydroxide ions. For carbonate the pKs are 7 and 11.  Its salts 
would be more bitter than the comparable sulfate salt. 
 
In its reaction with phosphate, magnesium has a pK = 24 and calcium has a pK = 
33, so it will theoretically take more magnesium to drop the pH than it will 
calcium, but both will be pretty effective, since they are both really 
insoluble.  All pK info from Rubber Chem. Handbook 73rd ed. 
 
So the answer is, as far as salts go whatever makes the pH go up above pH = 7 
will make a solution bitter        ( whether it is sulfate or carbonate taking 
up protons for example). Therefore, with this simple model it is the sulfate 
that is responsible for the bitterness of the pure salt of calcium and 
magnesium
sulfate solutions. In the case of metal hydroxides or oxides, these are bases 
and can supply the hydroxide which will be bitter and the acids which can 
supply
protons and be sour, which is where we started. As we discussed above a wort is
not a simple thing, and will have many competing simultaneous reaction. In the 
case of calcium sulfate in beer an excess of sulfate will be there relative to 
the calcium because of the phosphate precipitation.  These same reasonings 
should argue that phosphate solution derived from phosphate salts should also 
be
bitter, since they should be alkaline and they are, witness TSP (tri-sodium 
polyphosphate) as a model. 
 
So, it is the calcium and magnesium ions which exhibit control of the sulfate 
and phosphate concentrations and therefore the bitterness.   Which is the 
bitterest on a molar basis, sulfate or phosphate? Based on the pK, I guess the 
phosphate would be, since it has two equilibria to suck up protons vs one for 
sulfate, assuming the first eqm is totally dissociated in both cases.   So in 
beer is it the calcium, magnesium or the sulfate and the phosphate which 
controls the mineral bitterness? I submit that it is both anions and cations, 
based on this reasoning. 
 
Where this argument doesn't hold up is that beer has a pH that is acidic and 
therefore we shouldn't taste any mineral bitternesss. Is it that our taste buds
somehow neutralize the acid taste out and evaluate the salts? or that taste bud
reactions are sorta like little pH meters?  If this is the case can the metal 
ions with a relatively insoluble hydroxide like Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn act as a source 
of hydroxide ions and taste bitter,whereas sodium would not?  I could guess so 
and therefore both the cations and anions would be responsible the bitteness. 
 
I said it was speculation didn't I? 
 
Keep on brewin'

Brwsters: 
 
Sorry I don't have the reference, since I don't keep HBD's and don't have a 
search engine to relocate the posting. 
 
Anyone know where I can get one?  Just Kidding. 
 
Anyway.  An HBDer commented on the fact that George Fix sorta invented the 
concept of hot side aereation. Not so.  He may have brought it to light in the 
annals of HBD - thanx Doc., but it has been known for a long time that 
aereation
of a hot wort will produce produce an inferior product. 
 
Thus:  M&BS ed.1 (1971)  p407: 
 
"AEREATION 
 
For satisfactory active and regular fermentation it is necessary that the wort 
should contain sufficient dissolved oxygen. Various authors quote this as being
between 33 and 88% air saturation. Accordingly air, or occasionally oxygen, is 
injected into the wort. Most brewers only aereate the cold wort to give 75-90% 
saturation (8-14 ppm of oxygen) but some brewers aereate the hot wort and 
others
aereate before and after refrigeration. Aereation of hot wort leads to 
oxidation
of wort constituents and an increase in colour........" 
 
Although a lot of time is spent here on the subject of aereation, hot and cold,
I think cooling the wort before pouring it through the air is important, for 
those of you still removing hops with a strainer through the air, as I used to 
do.  I can personally testify that the "hop extract tang" as identified in the 
original British HB books (1960s)  was nothing more than HSA.  When I started 
moving the hort wort via tubing into the (plastic) fermenter versus pouring it 
in hot, the quality of my beer improved remarkably. 
 
One thing we must always remember is that brewing in many cases does not scale 
up or down easily.  In our case the surface to volume ratio of our operations 
compared to breweries are vastly different. Aereation,  in particular, is a 
major difference, since we are given the opportunity to aereate both hot and 
cold, simply because we use such small volumes.

     Tom asked about using a microwave oven for sanitation.  I don't know 
     how effective it would be on dry goods, but I use it to make starters. 
     I make up some wort from extract and water in appropriate 
     concentration and add to quart canning jars with wide mouths.  You can 
     use pint or half gallon jars as well, I suppose.  I put a canning lid 
     on the jar, but not the ring and nuke the starter solution until it 
     has boiled for about 10 minutes.  I suppose you could add hops, but I 
     don't.  After boiling, I take the starter solution out of the MW oven 
     and put the ring on and tighten and allow to cool to room temp.  It 
     should be sealed and sterile? on the inside.  When the time is right, 
     smack the yeast pak and let it rise.  (Actually, I usually smack the 
     yeast and verify that it is gonna expand before I make the starter.) 
     When it is fully expanded, shake the sealed, room temperature jar of 
     starter to aerate, remove the ring, carefully break the seal and add 
     the yeast.  replace the lid and ring and tighten.  Then loosen the 
     ring by about a quarter turn which should be sufficient to allow CO2 
     to escape.  Depending on your preference, you can step up this starter 
     to a larger volume or add directly to your fermenter.  I've only been 
     doing the liquid yeast thing for a couple years, but never had a 
     problem.

Well, again I'm just guessing, but I suppose it's true for the much the same 
reason that 650 ppm of sulfate works too.  Put even 100 ppm sulfate in your 
(also pale) Pilsner and I'll bet you'll be making faces when you drink it (a' 
la Keystone's BitterBeer Face?)  Perhpas some favorable hop interaction?  I 
thought I read somewhere that there was even a theory that there was 
something chemically special about Goldings hops in particular that caused 
this unlikely synergism in Pale Ales.  Sounds goofy but so does saying that 
650 ppm of sulfate will make your beer tastier.  Go figure.

After looking through the latest catalog from American Science & Surplus (no 
affiliation, blah blah), I was intrigued by a product listed as "Germicidal 
Cabinet".   A steel cabinet, 24" X 18" X 9" with 4 wire shelves and a double 
door with locks.  An automatic timer zaps the inside with mild radiation for 
15 minutes.  The price is $175.  They claim it kills 99+% of the bacteria 
present. 
 
Do any of our biological gurus have any opinion on how effective this would 
be for sterilizing bottles, smaller pieces of equipment, etc.? 
 
If anyone is interested the catalog number is 79245 and they can be reached 
at (847) 982-0870 or faxed at (800) 934-0722.  You may want to get a catalog 
too, just for the entertainment value alone.  A huge selection of electrical 
equipment, lab glassware, educational toys and general junk.  They have a 
retail store not far from my house and it's a homebrewer's dream.  You can 
walk around for hours trying to figure out how to incorporate their stuff 
into your next brewing gizmo!

They work great. I use them for both primary fermenters and serving tanks. 
All you have to do is remove the down-tube, and get yourself a tap. To remove 
the down-tube, release *ALL* the pressure (VERY Important), then remove the 
retaining ring located around the inside top of the bung hole with a sharp, 
pointed tool. Once you have removed this retainer, you can lift up and turn 
the down-tube, and then pull it out of the keg. Clean and sterilize, sorry, 
SANITIZE, then fill with beer. Replace the down-tube and retainer, and you 
are in busisness. Attatch your tap, charge with CO2 and shake to carbonate. 
When I use one for my primary fermenter, I use a cork stopper with a 1" hole 
drilled through the center to accept a blow-off tube. I made the mistake 
(ONCE) of using an airlock and a rubber stopper. I was quite surprised and 
amazed when it exploded, covering my ceiling and all four walls with 7 gals 
of beer and hops. (for a detailed recounting of this experience, see HBD #1983)
When racking to the secondary, I use a tap, CO2 and a modified down-tube. I 
cut off 1.5" from the bottom of the tube so that I don't pickup all the sludge 
(technical brewing term) from the bottom. Here's some more data points: 
A size 11 rubber stopper will fit the bung perfectly. 
You can cut the retaining ring into two pieces, which will make removing and 
replacing it easier. I've been looking for a snap ring that will fit, but have 
not found one yet. (if anyone knows what size to use, please let me know!)

  I cool with tap water until the wort gets to that temp.(75F-80F or so) 
 and then use the 5gal of cold water. I guess I forgot to mention that. I 
 also use a very slow flow rate to get the best heat transfer I can. My 
 chiller is 50 ft. also. I also stir the wort usnig my chiller several 
 times durring the process. I brew outside and let the water run down the 
 driveway and often do other stuff while waiting. I don't think I use near 30 
 gal. I've never measured it, but would guess I only use around 15 gal total.

     Bill Richard said: 
 
 
          "The problem is this: now when I make a batch of beer it seems to 
          have a metallic flavor to it.  Is this because of the stainless? 
          The pot didn't cost alot ($25), is it "cheap" stainless?  What 
          should I do to prevent this problem in the future? " 
 
     My brew partner bought a "stainless" pot for our use.  I thought "cool 
     - didn't even ask me to kick in $$$".  After three ruined (or at least 
     damaged - opinions differ here) batches later, and much chasing of 
     alternative causes I asked him how much he paid for his "stainless" 
     pot.  You guessed it: $25 at Walmart. 
 
     So, to answer your questions:  Yes, it is because of your pot.  Yes it 
     is "cheap" stainless, probably a 400 series stainless (at best); you 
     need 304 or 316 stainless (304 is most common and less expensive).  To 
     prevent the problem.... well that's pretty obvious.  I wouldn't 
     recommend cooking anything acidic in your pot, unless you like 
     metallic spaghetti sauce. 
 
     I've got our brand new 60 qt. (18-8 304 SS) Vollrath in the truck as I 
     write this.  We are brewing with it tomorrow, and it is the first step 
     towards a primo 10 gallon brewery.  For what it's worth, my wife was 
     kind enough to spend half a day searching for deals on stainless stock 
     pots (in Houston, Texas - lots of sources of used and new restaurant 
     supplies).  The criteria were: 60 qt., Vollrath preferred, must be in 
     stock because we were brewing Sunday.  Many sources for the Vollrath 
     were found, and no other brands were found.  The price range was 
     remarkable.  Low price was $186.40 special order and wait two weeks; 
     high price was $360!!  The cheapest one that was in stock was $198.95, 
     but they accepted our offer of $189.00.  BTW: Even in a city of 
     4,000,000 people she was unable to locate any used SS stock pots from 
     any of the liquidators/used vendors ("they last forever" and "we 
     hardly ever see those" were the usual responses). 
 
     Is it worth it, compared to a modified sanke?  We thought long and 
     hard about this.  Sabco would have provided a reconditioned keg with 
     top cut out for about $90-100 after shipping that would do the same 
     thing.  We obviously decided that it was worth it.  YMMV, and we 
     haven't used it yet.  We may still finish out the brewery with 
     modified kegs rather than Vollraths.  Recommendations and suggestions 
     are welcome.
