Seems this has come up before, but Schwab_Bryan`at`ccmail.ncsc.navy.mil 
asks about what appears to be mold on top of the secondary.  I've seen 
this, but a closer inspection reveals that this is actually foam from 
carbon dioxide escaping form the beer (yeast).  I would consider other 
opinions, since it is not impossible to get such an infection that 
could grow mold, or is it???  Is beer not supposed to harbor 
pathogens?  I have a Cream Ale in secondary not that exhibits this 
phenomenon, and have seen it in the past.  The beer turned out fine, 
and I'm sure this one will too.

Subject: Garage Brewing with NG/ Laxatives


Before I ask my question, I would just like to state that I tend to be an 
idiot when  having to deal with anything mechanical. 
 
  That being said.... 
 
 I would like to move my brewery into the garage. Currently, I own a 35 qt 
SS kettle with an easymasher, one cut off sankey keg, and I have a natural 
gas pipe already in my garage. 
 
  I would like to get a burner for NG and boil in the sanke keg. I guess 
I can get a burner and somehow convert it from propane to NG, but I dont 
really know how I can install a TEMPORARY gas line for brewing. It needs to 
have mobility, I suppouse - I think I will be attaching this to the gas line 
in the corner and brew in the middle of the garage, and Id like to keep it 
cheap.  Anyone with ideas? 
 
  Also, what do I do for a stand?  Any simple solutions? 
 
Thanks! 
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 
Also, Al asks which is the laxative, Magnesium or sulfate?  The answer is 
Magnesium - it is a laxative in all of its various forms, Mg Oxide, Mg sulfate 
Mg hydroxide.  Sulfate has no specific laxative properties that Im aware of. 
I think I know more about laxatives than i should.

Bill Richard writes about metallic flavor from his new CRES (stainless) 
brewpot. 
 
I too had a similar problem.  I bought a CRES brew pot and cleaned it for 
use.  I started to brew up some wort for a starter.  I noticed little black 
things in the trub settled on the side of the pot.  Some of them were 
reflective.  This seemed strange since I thought I did a good job cleaning 
the pot.  I speculate that it was metallic residue from an abrasive process 
that was in the microscopic pores and grain boundaries.  It had probably not 
been passivated after final machining.  I noticed that where the wort had 
been it was brighter.  Wort being acidic and passivation being an acid bath 
I decided to cleaned the pot with vinegar and no more black or mettalic crud 
 
Moral:  Clean new CRES equipment with acidic solutions.

I know a fellow in Canada (originally from Benin, I think) who reguarly 
brews sorghum beer and is working hard at duplicating the traditional taste 
using what he has up there.  So, well, we can probably find some ourselves 
with a bit of effort.

Of course.

I always get my way, even when I desire people to mispel my name. 
 
By the way, the description (yours?) I read of sorghum beer here a 
week or so ago, that it was cloudy, nasty, undrinkable, et cetera, 
sounds an awful lot like many people's first impression of Lambic. 
(Often their LAST impression, too.) 
 
Two-thirds of the world's population goes poop in a squatting position. 
Most of the other third thinks that's really icky and weird.  We also 
tend to get a lot of colon cancer. 
 
Also, if there ARE any takers on this, I'll try to get ahold of my buddy 
in Canada - he's been working on a culture to duplicate the sorghum beer 
he used to get back home.  I'll have to dig up his address.  It's around 
in my archives somewhere. 
 
> Bill? Terry? We're waiting :-) 
 
I'd be thrilled to host the first homebrew competetion specifically for 
sorghum beers.  But where to find qualified judges?

If it's using UV radiation, wouldn't it only be effective on items which are 
transparent to UV (or nearly so)? Doesn't glass filter out certain wavelengths 
of UV (which might render it ineffective for sanitizing the *insides* of the 
bottles)?

The Weihenstephan yeast seems to be crazy stuff... I once pitched a batch 
straight from a pack of Wyeast #3068 (no starter), and by the following 
morning, it was spraying foam all over the place. The airlock was literally 
*hissing*, and there was about a 4 foot "blast radius" of beer & foam on the 
floor around the fermenter. (This followup actually has very little to do with 
hot storage of yeast, but given what happened to me, I'm not surprised that 
the Weihenstephan yeast is tough to kill. :-))

Subject: Siphoning


Time for my two cents on SIPHONS. I just read somebody's post about 
something and there was mention of a stuck siphon. I had that problem, 
but last week think I found a cure, a way to keep the siphon tube full 
of free-flowing wort when racking. Allow me to pass this on and if it's 
painfully obvious, ignore it. As I suck some wort into the tube I stand 
up and let the tube hang below me so it fills up partially. Then I 
quickly stick it into the fermenter or whatever (so you spill, some, you 
can clean it up) As it flows into the container, if air forms in the tube 
I just pinch it and the air is flushed out, leaving a solid stream of 
wort. Keep pinching at the air spots until the whole tube is solid with 
flowing wort, top to bottom. Hope that helps anyone, or someone.

Most of the cheap pots that I have seen (including the two that I own) have 
aluminum rivets that hold the handles to the sides of the pot. Those rivets 
(if your boil reaches the aluminum) can be the source of off flavors. Also, 
many low cost type manufacturers, instead of passivating the pots correctly 
(nitric acid) will go for a lesser cleaning, or even use the stainless "as 
drawn", counting on the sheet stock supplier to have done his job in 
providing passivated sheet stock. The drawing process requires a lubricant, 
which may not have been cleaned off completely by you or by them. A 
THOUROUGH cleaning is in order with any new cookware of this sort. But my 
guess is that the alumininum rivets caused the problem.

Subject: Cheap stainless


I don't want to start a flame war, but it seems to me that all cheap 
stainless steel pots are not created equal.  I bought a very thin-gague 
stainless pot (5 gallon) to do my partial mash/extract brewing in.  It 
only cost about $17.  There's been no detectable metallic taste and I've 
made fruit beers, stouts, octoberfests and alts with this pot.  None have 
had the bad characteristics experienced by our fellow HBDer.  What I would 
be careful of, is where the handles are attached to the pot.  Many 
manufacturers say you should not fill the pot above the rivet points. 
Maybe something got into your beer from there....from the rivets or 
sealer.  Just another thing to be careful about.  Certainly buying the 
more expensive pots will assure you not to have thes troubles, but for me 
it was worth the 17 dollar gamble on a cheapo one.

This is true only in the Northern Hemisphere. Were the beer produced in the 
Southern Hemisphere, the yeast would either be on the South side of the 
bottle, or have a distinct drawl. I would suggest sending the entire batch

Subject: wild hops


Hi all 
 
Firstly I would like to thank the continuing efforts of all those who make 
this area possible. I never read the digest without learning something new. 
If the information becomes too technical for me, I just pass it upx sometime 
in the future, that same info may be just what I'm looking for. 
 
I just finished picking some wild hops which grow about a tenth of a mile 
from my house. Today's effort will yeild about an ounce and a half dry 
weight. A couple weeks ago I gathered 4 and a half ounces (dry). 
 
Does anyone know how to treat the root I also gathered today (about eight 
feet, one half inch to 5/8 inch diameter, with many rizome areas)?

Subject: Scotoberfest Lagale


I was hoping that I might obtain some comments on the following recipie 
for my proposed Scotoberfest Lagale: 
 
One of: 
6 lb Marie's Munich Extract (50% Munich, 50% 2-row) 
  or 
3.3 lb Bierkeller dark extract and 2.7 lb Briess light extract 
  or 
6.6 lb Ireks Light Munich extract 
 
  and 
 
7 oz Victory 
4 oz Special B 
3 oz 120L American crystal 
4 oz Peat-smoked malt (prob. Hugh Baird) 
 
6 HBU Fuggles `at` 60 minutes 
4 HBU Fuggles `at` 20 minutes 
 
Wyeast 1338 
 
OG 1.060 
 
My idea was to emphasize the toasty and caramel flavors with the 120L and 
the Special B, while punching up the malt flavor with the Victory.  I've 
also thought of putting a bit of flaked barley in to increase the body 
somewhat. 
 
My other idea was to substitute 7 ounces of Belgian Aromatic and 4 ounces 
of American Special Roast for the Victory and Special B, again perhaps 
with some flaked barley, retaining the peated malt, but I don't have a 
local source for either the Aromatic or the Special Roast and hate to pay 
shipping just for 11 ounces of malt. 
 
Remembering that I'm trying to make a brew with the toasty 
characteristics of an Oktoberfest (somewhat exaggerated so as to be 
noticable through the caramel flavors), the caramel characteristics of a 
Scotch Ale, and the intensely malty character of both, what do you think 
of my three versions of extract choices and their proportions and, 
second, of the two versions of my specials and their proportions? 
 
Also remembering that this is only my second batch of beer and that I'm a 
newbie, I need HELP!

Subject: re: Yeast Question


>> 
I have noticed that, and I am assuming this, when the yeast converts the 
sugars to CO2 and alcohol generates heat which in turn is increasing the 
temperature of the fermenting beer. I see this more in my ales than in my 
lagers due to the fermentation rate. My question is what is the best method 
of keeping the beer at the desired temp. other than overcompensating by 
reducing the ambient temp. below the desired temp. and keeping a close eye 
on the temp. of the fermenting beer. Any suggestions would be appreciated 
as I would like to have just a little more control over one more of the 
variables. 
<< 
 
I start my ales at the desired primary fermentation temperature. When I see 
the first signs of fermentation (foam covering to top or that first bubble 
out of the airlock) I reduce the temperature of my fermentation room by 
~4-8 degrees (depending on the starting gravity of the wort - the higher 
the SG, the more heat generated by fermentation).  My fermentation room is 
a small closet (when we bought the house, it was advertised as a 1/4 bath!) 
in the basement that stays at 50F in the winter and 60F in the summer.  I 
use a portable heater to control the ambient temperature. I do the same 
thing for lagers but in a thermostatically controlled refrigerator (you are 
correct, lagers hardly show the heat generation effects). I have heard of 
people using wet towels and fans to produce evaporative cooling, but if you 
want control over the process, this won't give you much.

Subject: Belgian Brown Ales (Strong Ale) Info?


   Does anyone have a good source of info on this style?  I'm planning on 
making a Belgian Brown Ale similar to Corsendonk or Saint Landelin Brown 
Abbey Ale this Fall after the temperatures drop and would appreciate any 
tips or sucessful recipes.  Searching Cat's Meow 3 was unsucessful - lots of 
British Brown Ales though. Also, is the Brewers Pubs book "Belgian Ale" by 
P. Rajotte a good resource for these styles?  I can't remember if it was 
this book or the Lambic book that I've seen complaints about. 
   So far, my rough recipe would be (5 US gal): 
9 lbs Belgian 2-row Pilsner malt (DeW-C) 
1 lb light Munich Malt (maybe more, or maybe dark?) 
2 oz Special B 
1 lb Brown Sugar (variety? - Turbinado?) 
8 Oz Crystal (60L) 
Wyeast Belgian Ale, ferment at 60F 
1 oz Hallertau (Bittering) 
1 oz Stry Goldings (Bittering) 
1/2 oz Saaz aroma 
 
A quick run through in SUDS at n=80%  gives: 
OG=1.070 
IBU=37 
color=16 - but not sure if the above would really give me the brown color 
I'm looking for. 
 
Any comments/critiques

Subject: Wringing Mashes


In HBD #2165, Billy Cole wrote an article entitled "Wrinnging 
hop/grain bags".  This inspired (inflamed?) my brain with a 
question.  Two of the early steps in bewing are mashing and 
sparging. Could sparging be replacing with a draining of the mash 
under pressure? 
 
There is of a course a reason for sparging in the traditional way 
(there's always a reason).  But is it a good reason?  (Not all 
reasons are good ones).  I can see some potential reasons why a 
"forced sparge" would be bad, and some potential replies to the 
objections: 
 
* Forced sparging would not extract all the fermentable sugars from 
the mash (would loss of efficiency be that great?  Would two or 
three forced sparges do the trick?) 
 
* Forced sparging would result in various gunk (bits of husk, 
starch, excessive tannins, etc.) in the wort (couldn't the wort be 
filtered?) 
 
* Equipment for forced sparging would be too expensive for even the 
most dedicated homebrewer (but how about on a commercial scale?) 
 
Does anyone know if forced sparging has ever been done?

Subject: More Electrical / Cheap SS


Dick Dunn made a few comments about my electrical element post and 
he's right:  Ohm's law (V equals I*R) does not completely and exactly 
describe this electrical system because the element _does_ have a 
reactive component, and there are heating effects and other 
non-linearities. 
 
I assumed that the 5500W stamped on the element is a steady state 
rating  and as such approximates the power through it under load. 
And I stand by my original statement (or what I meant anyway): 
 
A given element rated for 240 V will draw about 1/2 the current if 
connected at 120 V and will draw about 1/4 of the power. 
 
All this, remember, in response to a post stating that there was some 
inherent danger associated with using this 240 V element at 120 V due 
to its "industrial strength" classification or some such.  I did and 
still do disagree with this premise. 
 
Dick also made  a valuable point about the ratings of the electrical 
circuits: 
 
Dick sez: 
>>> So if you are on a 15A circuit, you want to be sure  that your wiring 
  is healthy and you're not trying to run much else on the  same 
  circuit. In almost all normal cases, there's no dire danger...it's 
  no worse than  when you start the coffeepot and the toaster on the 
  same circuit at the  same time, and it pops a breaker.  There are 
  safety nets; you just want to  stay out of 'em. 
<<< 
I agree completely.  The 80 % rule of thumb I specified is for single 
loads on a given circuit (like window A/C units and the like).  For 
multiple use circuits (i.e. garage and half the living room on the 
same breaker) you'd want even more cushion.  Make sure you have 
adequate capacity or install a dedicated circuit. 
 
RANDY > Basically most >home panels are rated for 100 A or more and the first 
line > of
  protection is the fuse on the transformer primary which is sized to 
  > allow 150 percent overload or so... 
 
DICK:>>> Few homes are on their own 
  transformers.  The first line of protection is  the per circuit 
  breaker (15 or 20 A) which is protecting the wiring to the  outlet. 
  Second line of protection is the 100A or more mains breaker; if 
  that pops you have screwed up big time or you had a bad single 
  circuit  breaker.  Don't even think about how big a screwup it takes 
  to hit the  transformer. <<< 
 
My point was that the original poster/authority/salesman advocated 
wiring the element directly to the panel!!!!!  Conveniently bypassing 
the circuit protection and the conceivably the main.  Which would 
rely on the transformer protection which I agree is pretty scary.  Not a good 
practice.

Someone asked about metallic flavors from a cheap SS pot.  I've used 
one of these for a couple with no problems.  I noticed on mine that 
it was lighty coated with machine oil, barely noticable -- which washed off 
easily with a little detergent.  Could this be a factor?

Subject: Ruined Grain


I store my malt in garbage cans with reasonably tight-fitting lids. 
This has always worked well...until now. 
 
Today I went downstairs to do a grain inventory and discovered a bag of 
ordinary household garbage in my main malt bin. The bin's other contents 
were ~10Kg each of Durst and Edme pale malts. I opened the malt bags up 
and sat them on the porch to air out for a few hours, then gave each a 
quick odor check. Result: roughly equal proportions of malt aroma and 
putrescence. The bugs in my compost pile are in for a bonanza. 
 
I mention this sad story for a couple of reasons...(1) Often there is no 
better instrument to tell whether a particular brewing ingredient (malt, 
hops, yeast starters, water) "is ruined" than your own nose and (2)it's 
a good idea to mark grain storage bins as such, especially when they 
look like garbage cans to the "untrained" eye and you have houseguests 
who help out with domestic chores.

Subject: Brew kits or scratch?


I have just started to get into brewing my own beer. Right now I 
buy brew kits like Mutton and Fission's (American Style Light or 
Lager). In Canada these kits go for about $15 to $20, and I can make 
about 60 bottles. Compared to buying brand name beer at ~$17 for a 
case of 12. 
I was wondering what the cost comparison is to making your beer from 
scratch. And also how can I get the ingredients and do I have to buy 
any extra equipment. 
Being a university student these kits are great because they don't 
take much time plus they taste pretty good too. 
Anybody wish to give advice or comment?

Subject: HBD on CDROM


To the collective, 
 
The HBD does exist on CDROM. 
 
The Beer Homebrewing Guide, August 1994

The Beer Homebrewing Guide published by Walnut Creek CDROM, has back issues 
of the HBD in Windows .HLP format, going from 1989 to 1994. It also has the 
Cats Meow in .HLP format. 
 
When I started brewing over 3 years ago, I read all I could about brewing. 
My dad 
would download stuff off of Compuserve for me since I did not belong to any 
online services. By brother-in-law got me the CD as a gift. I read through 
all the 
digests and got a feel for every one on the digest, Al, Kinney, Jack, John 
the 
cosmic coyote, and a whole lot of different people. Now copyright is a 
touchy 
subject, but without the CD I would not have had the knowledge base I 
needed to 
improve by beers. When I finally got an email address, Nov. 1995, I 
subscribed to 
the Home Brew Digest, Lambic Digest, and the Mead Lovers Digest. Now the 
names I 
used to see in the HBD help files, I see in most of the posts now, and am 
happy 
there still here to guide and direct brewers. 
 
Now while I don't read every digest word for word (PgDn Key) I do zip the 
files 
and save them. Because what doesn't interest me today, could answer a 
question 
I have later. 
 
Thanks to every one for a good experience.

        Gee, Brian...I don't know about "Righteous indignation," ....  ;-) 
or the need to view that of others, but Jethro's just a good ole boy who 
takes people at their word. Like I stated, I think it would be a good idea 
to put the bloody thing on CD-Rom...if possible... 
        Until you bragged of it, I never knew such an item did 
exist...(Where can I buy one?) 
        But, thank God, someone in the family has some sense! 
 
>Jethro Gump weighs in with his opinions,

        I guess ole Jethro ain't entitled to an opinion, no more.....not 
since Brian's decided I don't deserve one....I merely pointed out that such 
matters are subject to legal review at this time ...and as Jethro 's opinion 
isn't precedent setting, I guess, as I assume your wife does...that it might 
just be the arena ruled by attorneys that has the last word on the subject... 
        BTW, is your wife available for a retainer?.......Jethro might need 
an attorney for daring to speak his mind.... 
 
>Quitcherbitchin! 
        Thanks, Brian! Before this moment, I just thought I was exercising 
my opinion...now I know I was bitchin! At last, a purpose for my miserable 
existence! 
 
>Nobody's making any money 
>off the HBD, except those who have improved their brewing skills to the 
>point of going pro...and that ain't copyright infringement! 
        And Jethro has been thankful to the collective, for their 
assistance, and has publically stated the same....but then, if you knew my 
boss, then you'd know that ole Jethro ain't making no money!!! 
 
>Al has good brewing advice in general so I can't call him a lunatic, 
        And I'm sure that Al is ever so pleased! But as for the rest of us, 
I know we are thankful to you for slotting us in a category of your choice!

        Why, yes, for the only article I have ever posted in it's entirety 
to the HBD, from Foster...I did indeed speak to him on the phone and get his 
"express permission" to post the article...as I also did from the 
editor/publisher of the journal in which I found the article... 
        I have in the past and will in the future continue to quote excerpts 
from info I think the collective will find interesting...and from beer 
related articles of "Breweriana,"..... 
        And as I have always done in the past, I shall continue to attribute 
these snippets of info to the originators...I believe that this falls in the 
category of 'educational purposes'...I have actually received thanks from 
some of them for spreading the news that they even existed! 
 
>It's all been loads of fun but it should stop now.  If ya wanna continue 
>whining about this, lets go offline.... 
        Gee, Brian, I didn't know that we 'were having fun'...I thought we 
were responding with our 'opinions' to a matter that actually deserves some 
thought....OH, I SEE, YOU were having fun, and you thought it was at OUR 
expense! 
Oh, well...see ya later...I'm off to the local cinema to yell "FIRE"....       
 
        Jethro still believes..without any prompting from those who won't be 
accountable for their own utterances...that the HBD on CD-ROM would be a 
wonderful thing, if it is do-able. I agree with others suggestion that any 
funds accrued from such an undertaking be used to maintain the costs of 
running the affair...or be donated to any charitable enterprise. 
        But Brian..are you sure your name ain't NOKOMAREE?   ;_) 
Cheers!
