Subject: Epoxy safety??


Could use some actual knowledge on the use of epoxies.  I have to repair my 
old friend, the camp cooler mash/lauter tun. The drain has been leaking (cause 
of losing way too much extract last batch), and I need to bond two pieces of 
plastic so that the leak stops.  It *seems* straight-forward enough, but I'm 
concerned about the use of epoxy in very close (if not direct) contact with hot
wort.  Does anyone know for certain if epoxy becomes inert after it 
solidifies (or if it doesn't) or if there are particular epoxies that are 
particularly 
suited to contact with hot liquid? 
 
Speculation is all well and good, but I'd like to hear from someone who really 
has an answer. Thanks  (direct e-mail would be great)

Subject: Alcohol flavors in my Dunkel


On 8/21, I bottled my first attempt at a Dunkels Weissbier from extract + 
specialty grains. At bottling, a strong "alcohol" flavor and aroma were 
evident. After a week in the bottle I sampled one and the same flavors were 
present. Is this normal for a Dunkel? The OG was 1.044 and after 17 days of 
fermentation at 68 deg F, stopped at 1.014. TIA for any advice or assistance.

I agree that you should wait until virtually all fermentation is over, but 
why transfer?  As I've posted before, I believe that the benefits of 
secondaries are outweighed by the drawbacks of their use.  I dryhop directly 
into my primaries.

With a decent-sized starter, not only are all signs of fermentation over, but 
even the yeast has settled, in my experience.

I say just dump the hops into the primary.  There are several problems with 
Dave's suggestions: 
 
1. getting a bag of hops and marbles into the neck of a carboy is a pain, 
 
2. getting a bag of wet hops and marbles out of the neck of a carboy is an 
even bigger pain (don't forget all that trub too!), 
 
3. boiling the hops for a minute will boil off many of the more volatile 
aromatics -- this is not just "not exactly dry hopping," it is "not at all 
dryhopping," and 
 
4. hops should not have any more bacteria or yeast than inorganic items -- 
there is little in hops to sustain life for bacteria and wild yeast (i.e. 
you can't *grow* a colony of yeast on a hop -- little food, nutrition, etc.); 
they did a test of dryhops at a brewing school a few years ago -- they found 
some yeast and bacteria on the hops themselves, but virtually all of these 
were killed when they hit the beer. 
 
Dryhopping is easy and much less likely to infect your beer than aerating 
with room air.  Let's not make brewing any more complicated than it needs 
to be -- this is an area (IMO) where simpler is better.  As a personal 
testimonial, in over 75 dryhopped batches, I have not had a single one where 
the dryhops caused a noticeable infection (*all* homebrew is infected -- you 
just don't want it to get noticeable).

You should have read that post of my you praised a little more carefully. 
What this will make is Biscuit/Victory-like toasted malt and not a Vienna/ 
Munich-type malt.  For these you have to start with green malt (not yet 
dried).

Rather than speculating about the bitterness of things based upon strong 
bases, weak acids, etc., why don't you just mix them into water an taste 
them?  I have (well, I had to taste the calcium carbonate directly -- 
it doesn't dissolve in a neutral pH) and none of these brewing salts are 
very bitter in the quantities we use.  We're talking grams per gallon 
here, remember...

Burton beers are quite bitter and Vienna beers are mildly bitter.  In 
both cases they have a pleasant bitterness not an unpleasant one.  Speculating 
on what Foster or Noonan thinks will only get you in trouble.  Also, don't 
confuse the effect of magnesium sulphate (which *will* enhance dryness, but 
due to the sulphate (from every other source I've read)) with the effect of 
magnesium ions.  I don't believe that chemistry works by "exceptions to 
the rule."  I believe that the rule is the rule.

That's old technology.  It is neither sanitary nor accurate.  That's the 
way they taught everyone to brew 20 years ago.  Before that, they would 
teach you to bottle before the beer was done fermenting.  The modern 
way is to boil up the sugar in some water to sanitize and dissolve it, 
then add it to a second, sanitized container and siphon the finished beer 
on top of the priming sugar, bottling immediately.

Nope.  Amps and volts are *directly* proportional: V = I * R.  Cut the 
voltage in half and you cut the current in half (assuming constant R). 
Using P = I * V (P is power) and V = I * R you can get the relationship 
 
   P = V * V / R 
 
which is a good one to remember.  Apologies if I'm the 10th person to 
respond to this.

Subject: weld splatter / etc.


I just picked up my converted s.s. keg from a 'friend of a friend' welder. 
It was a beer for service trade, and I'm generally happy. However, 
I had asked him to cut the top out and had mentioned the tip about 
putting water inside if splattering was a problem.   When I picked 
up the keg, he apologized for all the splattered metal but said, 
"we couldn't put water inside 'cause we cut it with a rod", whatever 
that means.  He showed me, with a putty knife, how to chip the 
splatters out. 
      1. Is there a better, or easier method to remove the splatters? 
      2. I know steel brushes are bad; is anything else to be avoided? 
      3. Do the splatters have to be removed?  Is it ok if they stay? 
      4. He said I could buff it up with a sander. Is that a good 
          idea?  Which sandpaper would you use? 
 
He welded a s.s. coupling to the side. It's very nice.  He's done 
s.s. kegs before and appears knowledgable.  In reading the keg 
conversion faq,  I've been scared about poisonous cadmium in welds 
and such.    However, I think asking him about that might insult him, 
like 'I know you're the expert; but do you really know what you're 
doing?'      I hate to look a gift-welder in the mouth.     ;-} 
      1.  Is there a way I can tell by looking at the weld if it's 
           the right kind? 
      2.  Is it true that only the 'right kind' could have been  used 
           successfully anyway?    (I heard that somewhere.) 
 
Thanks for any answers to these questions.

It appears that Dick is the only one who knows what he's talking about. 
Read his post again and learn something. 
 
Dick's post follows: 
 
"Assuming that by "pure resistance" you mean non-reactive, OK, but that's 
too simplistic.  Heating elements are not "pure resistance" independent of 
voltage. 
 
You can see this dramatically with a "heating element" that gets very hot-- 
e.g., a light bulb.  A 60-watt 120-volt bulb has a cold resistance of about 
18 ohms, but if you crank that through the ol' P = v^2 / r, you come up 
with 800 watts!  In fact, a 60-watt bulb *does* draw more than 10x its 
rated power when you first turn it on...but that makes it heat up, and the 
heat increases the resistance, and the increased resistance decreases the 
power. 
 
Now, a brewing heating element doesn't get anywhere near the temp of the 
filament of a light bulb, but there's still a non-negligible change in the 
resistance as it heats up, and there is an implication here. 
 
[excerpting a bunch] 
>...In this example Resistance equals Voltage divided by current 
> or 10.5 Ohms.  Power also equals Current squared times resistance, in 
> this case 5500 Watts. 
> 
> If you connected this element to 120 V, the resistance would not change, 
> it would still be 10.5 Ohms... 
 
This is wrong, because at 120 V the element will not get up to the opera- 
ting temperature implied by the power consumption at 240 V.  Randy's cal- 
culation of 1/4 as much power at 120 V as at 240 V is correct for the ideal 
resistor, but for a heating element it will be somewhat higher than 1/4. 
Since 1/4 of 5500W is 1375W, this moves the numbers into the realm where 
you want to start to think carefully.  A 15-amp 120V circuit is, in 
principle, good for 1800W, and it would be prudent not to get right on top 
of that.  You'll probably be over 1500W.  (Howzabout somebody take one of 
those 5500W elements and measure the cold resistance??  That will give us 
the other endpoint.)  So if you are on a 15A circuit, you want to be sure 
that your wiring is healthy and you're not trying to run much else on the 
same circuit. 
 
In almost all normal cases, there's no dire danger...it's no worse than 
when you start the coffeepot and the toaster on the same circuit at the 
same time, and it pops a breaker.  There are safety nets; you just want to 
stay out of 'em.

Few homes are on their own transformers.  The first line of protection is 
the per-circuit breaker (15 or 20 A) which is protecting the wiring to the 
outlet.  Second line of protection is the 100A-or-more mains breaker; if 
that pops you have screwed up big-time or you had a bad single-circuit 
breaker.  Don't even think about how big a screwup it takes to hit the 
transformer."

In HBD 2170, Shane Saylor asked about homebrew recipe books. 
 
There are several on the market that I know of. "Homebrew Favorites" 
is one that Karl Lutzen and myself edited, and which is published 
through Storey Publishing. It has 240 recipes in it. I don't want 
to hype my own work here, so send me e-mail if you want details 
on this. A second volume will be out next year. 
 
There are also two recipe books put out by the AHA: "Winners Circle" 
and "Victory Beer". Both are culled from entries in their national 
homebrew competition. Winners Circle is the older of the two. Each 
has about 100 recipes. 
 
Another collection that I'm aware of is Steve Snyder's "Brewmasters 
Recipe Log". This is a spiral bound book. I'm not sure how many 
recipes it contains.

Subject: More on Sorghum Beer


Sorry I was away for the long Labor Day weekend and just got 
caught up on the sorghum beer discussions. Many thanks to my 
friend Michel Vandenplas for his "Sorghum Beer Challenge". Guess 
I'm on the spot now to post some further information, since I 
doubt Mr Tegner will be of much help :-). I'd also like to 
call on Richard Okambawa of Montreal (the gentleman mentioned 
earlier by Russell Mast) to post his recipe for Shakparo, the 
West African interpretation of sorghum beer. 
 
For starters, let's begin calling this stuff "African Opaque 
Beer", a more generic term but one that better describes the 
product. It falls into a category referred to as "SMM" 
(Sorghum/Maize/Millet) beer, as these are the principal 
ingredients used to brew it. Industrial versions actually contain 
very little sorghum - approximately 10% (the remainder being 
unmalted maize). 
 
Traditionally, malted grain sorghum (variety caffrorum) comprises 
at least half of the grain bill in home and village-brewed 
versions, the other half being millet or maize. Keep in mind that 
this sorghum is not the same as the "sweet sorghum" (variety 
saccharatum) used to produce the molasses-like syrup commonly 
found in North America. Please consult my articles in the 1995 
Special issue of "Zymurgy" for more details on sorghum, its 
varieties, and the various methods used to malt it. 
 
The essential steps required to produce opaque beer are sour 
mashing, boiling, sugar mashing, alcoholic fermentation, and 
straining. For the purpose of this exercise, we'll keep the sour 
mashing and sugar mashing steps simple. Souring in particular is 
very difficult to control at home (ask any lambic brewer), and 
opaque beer, when freshly consumed, should have just a hint of 
sourness anyway. 
 
Here's my very basic recipe for traditional opaque beer (makes 
about 8 liters or 2 gallons): 
 
1/2 kilo (1.1 lbs) sorghum malt 
1/2 kilo (1.1 lbs) unmalted millet 
Packet Red Star baking yeast 
 
Crush the millet and boil in water for about 15 minutes to 
gelatinize starches. Drain and add to crushed sorghum malt in the 
mashing vessel of your choice (I use my 3 gal brewpot). Add 4 
liters water at 160 degrees F (Sorry, don't have my centigrade 
converter handy) to reach mashing temp of approximately 150-155 
degrees F. Mash for 1 hour. 
 
Transfer liquid portion of mash to fermentation vessel by pouring 
entire contents of mash vessel through fine-mesh wire basket. 
Sparge grains with sufficient hot (~170 degree F) water to obtain 
8 liters of wort. Let wort cool naturally overnight or until 
reaching room temperature. 
 
Once at room temperature, check the original gravity of wort. 
Full starch conversion should result in an OG of 1.030-1.032. 
Depending on the age and condition of the sorghum malt (which has 
fairly low disatatic power anyway), you may need to add a small 
amount of corn sugar to bring the gravity up to this level. 
 
Add the yeast (preferably rehydrated in a little warm water) and 
one cup of additional crushed sorghum malt (to help induce lactic 
fermentation). Stir vigorously to combine ingredients and 
oxygenate the wort. 
 
Ferment for 2 days at room temperature (65-75 degrees F is 
optimum), then strain beer through wire basket once again into 
storage vessels (I use two 1-gallon glass jugs). Refrigerate and 
serve the same day. 
 
The beer, when fresh, is opaque, slightly pink-colored, yeasty, 
and very refreshing. If kept for several days, the lactic 
sourness grows but never makes the beer undrinkable. Of course, I 
love traditional Belgian lambics as well, so YMMV. 
 
This is the same beer Jim Busch mentioned in his posting awhile 
back, and Wendy and I both felt it was far tastier than anything 
we sampled in Africa (from both industrial and village 
breweries). 
 
I'm currently looking for a source for grain sorghum in the U.S. 
as I'd like to try some malting experiments. The sorghum malt we 
used was hand-carried back from Africa. 
 
Have fun with this, and feel free to experiment with ingredients 
and techniques. Maize or wheat grits can be substituted for the 
millet, and several brewers (including Charlie Papazian, who has 
published his recipe in "au Juice" magazine) have suggested that 
malted barley can be successfully substituted for malted sorghum. 
I've never tried this but might give it a shot down the road. 
 
It'll be interesting to see how the other batches in the "sorghum 
challenge" turn out.

Yes, I've had the same sort of thing happen. Last time I used this yeast, I 
stuck the secondary in a dark corner of the basement and (nearly) forgot about 
it. Couple of months later, it was *still* bubbling, albeit very slowly; I 
went ahead and bottled. (The beer turned out *great*, BTW...) 
 
This is supposedly a very flocculant yeast; agitating the fermenter slightly 
every couple of days (to keep more of the yeast in suspension) might speed 
things up.

Well, actually I'd really like to know why too.  Could a answer be posted, as 
I'm sure there are a lot of new-brewers like myself lurking out there who are a
little confused by the sometimes *apparently* conflicting advice given in HBD. 
I've recently racked to a secondary fermenter for the first time, and cant wait
see if makes a difference.

Put your secondary into your beer fridge for a couple of days to 
'cold crash' (tm) it, then siphon through a lady's nylon stocking. 
I have found that putting the nylon on the outlet side of the siphon 
works better than putting it on the intake side. I just usually stretch 
the nylon across the opening to a Cornelius keg, then siphon into it. 
Also, get the shorter type of nylons, knee high length. That way you get 
two separate pieces instead of the one large assembly that includes panties. 
(Of course, you could always remove the panties, but that is a different 
undertaking, best not discussed in this forum) Also, don't use bleach. I 
just dip them into boiling water for about 30 seconds.

Sounds like you were using Papazian's method of blowoff.  The answer to 
your question is: throw the tubing out and buy more.  You can't clean it 
well enough to siphon beer with it anymore.  Furthermore, using such a 
small diameter tubing for blowoff is an invitiation for an explosion.  Buy 
yourself some 1 1/4" OD tubing for blowoff and 5/16" ID FOOD-GRADE tubing 
for siphoning and don't use one for the other.  The 1.25" tubing will fit 
right into the neck of a carboy without a stopper.

Perhaps there are plants like this, but I don't think hops are one of them. 
Hops like LOTS of water.  The first year I planted I got virtually no hops. 
The second year I got a lot more.  Hops like lots of water... I was 
putting 6 gallons of water per plant per day on them!  Also, in my soil, 
the hops (according to the books I read) needed more magnesium.  I used 
Epsom salts (a tablespoon per plant) once every few weeks or when then 
showed the need (yellowing between the veins on the leaves). 
 
I have used a food dehydrator for drying hops, but over-dried them.  I 
used a really cheap, non-adjustable one and in 8 hours they were brittle. 
Rotate trays often and check for brittleness.  Quit immediately if they 
begin to get brittle.  I've read that some hop processors dry to where 
the hops are brittle and then set them out to re-absorb some water.  This 
can also be the time period in which you allow the oxidation reactions 
to take place -- yes some of these are necessary for some varieties, 
especially Noble hops.

I spoke to the brewmaster at Burton Bridge Brewery about water (among other 
things) and he said that the tapwater in Burton-on-Trent is now 1/2 well 
and 1/2 surface water.  He uses tapwater, but adds gypsum to get the 
calcium and sulfate up near where they traditionally have been in the 
well water.  My guess is that the Burton ales we get in the states as well 
as those that are widely available in the UK (Bass, Ind Coope...) are 
probably more likely to be more conservative with their additions of 
sulphate.  Therefore, these are going to be less assertive beers than 
beers like Burton Bridge (or perhaps Marston's... have to check my notes -- 
I'm just speculating about Marston's till I check, but I know that Burton 
Bridge tastes quite a bit more bitter than Bass's or Ind Coope's bitters).

Just like in a CO2 tank, a high-pressure-side regulator tells you 
very little.  Both CO2 and propane are liquid in their tanks and 
the high-pressure regulators will show the same pressure till all the 
liquid is gone.  Then they will drop like a stone.  You need to measure 
the weight of the full propane tank and when it drops 20 pounds (that's 
the standard tank size) it's empty.  Simlarly for CO2 tanks, but they 
come in 2.5-, 5-, 10-, 20-pound and larger tanks.  A 10-pound CO2 tank 
will hold 10 pounds of CO2.  This is also a way for you to know whether 
the CO2-filling place has ripped you off.  Unless you brought in a steel 
tank and picked up an aluminum one (or vice versa), the difference in 
weight of a 10# tank should be 10# more when full.

          The actual price for a 40 QT. vollrath s/s stock pot (minus the

          $100.  Now for a lid, I just use a round pizza pan.

Subject: New All-Grain Brewer Extraction Problems


 
As a new all-grain brewer, I am facing dismally low efficiency.  I was 
wondering what areas of my setup/procedures I should look at.  My current 
mash/lauter tun is a 10-gal Gott with a Phil's False Bottom.  I use a 5-gal 
Gott for my hot liquor tank and connect it to Phil's Sparger.  A converted 
keg with a slotted manifold hop-back  is used for the boiler. 
 
My last batch was a compromised APA to satisfy both me and my Budmilloors 
softball team.  The grain bill was 8 lbs. of American 6-Row pale malt, 1 lb. 
40 L American Crystal, 12 oz. malted wheat and 8 oz flaked maize.   The 
barley malts  were crushed at my homebrew store using a quality roller mill. 
  I used a 122 F protein rest for 30 minutes followed by a 152 F conversion 
rest for 50 minutes.  The iodine test showed no starch left.  I recirculated 
for 15 minutes and then sparged 5 gallons of 170 F/pH 5.2 water 
through(which took about 35 minutes) and collected about 6.5 gallons of 
sweet liquor.  This was boiled down to about 5.25 gallons over 90 minutes. 
 I ran it through my counterflow chiller and took a gravity reading.  A 
lousy 1.035, or about 18 pts./lbs/gal.   The hydrometer has been calibrated. 
 
Here's an open-ended question for the collective:  Where should I look first 
to improve my efficiency? or if it tastes good,  RDWHAH! 
 
Thanks!

My approach so far with wild, unknown hops is to make a mystery beer! Take a 
favorite recipe, pretend that these are your recipes type of hops, and see 
what happens. I haven't thrown away a batch of mystery beer yet!

Ale is a perfect type of ber for the mystery approach! 
 
>Is there a way to identify the strain of hops I have found? 
 
Yes. At least somewhat.  The cone shape, size, and leaf structure are the 
general way to tell the type. There are several good books about hops, with 
full color pics, that you can get that describe the cones and leaves. Some 
of the hops producers (commercial) also put out a great brochure that have 
pics of leaves and cones.

Hi Christian, 
 
I had the same trouble, until I decided to drill a hole into my 
fermenter (plastic bucket) near the bottom and put on 
a spigot.  Now I can sample some wort and take hydrometer 
readings without much fuss.  Be sure to loosen the airlock 
or the vacuum will suck the juice into your beer.  I also 
clean the spigot well after sampling and sanitize before 
using it to drain the fermented beer.  No siphoning needed, just 
attach a sanitized hose and drain into a secondary or bottling bucket.
