Some info pertaining to recent HBD queries... 
 
**Motorizing MaltMills: 
A local Industrial Tools and Machine dealer had the necessary pulleys 
(sheaves technically) which I bought to connect a 1/3hp motor 
(former furnace motor) to my mill.  Including the bushing for 
the MM 3/8" shaft, this cost me <$40.  The arrangement gives me ca. 400 RPM 
at the mill, and it mills red wheat without any slippage.  The parts, etc... 
     Local Dealer: Kenneth J. Galm Co., Inc.  (317) 634-3467 
     Parts are made by Browning (their part numbers) 
     Description "part #"                        - price  
      H Bushing "H 3/8"                          - $ 4.08 
      A Belt "A36"                               - $ 3.82 
      F H P Sheave "AK 89 H" (ca. 12" diameter)  - $23.53 
      F H P Sheave "AK20 x 1/2" (ca. 0.5" diam)  - $ 5.23 
 
**Support for converted keg boilers: 
Taking a hint from a mail order catalog, I found that a pair of cinder blocks 
topped with some square steel tubing (Lowe's stocks it) works well.  I mounted 
the actual burner on some 1.25" flat steel bar, the bar supporting the burner 
by passing through the holes in the cinder blocks.  Works well and is cheap. 
 
**Digital Thermometer that's CHEAP! 
As I began to brew Sunday, a horror: my expensive thermometer was dead. 
I found a terrific replacement at William Sonoma...$15.00!  Its a digital 
version of the standard 5" cooking thermometer, made by Taylor. 
Model 9840, range -58 to 302F, reads quickly (few seconds).  I've checked 
the calibration (non-adjustable) versus lab thermometers, and it 
reads within 0.3 degrees F both at ambient and at 60C/140F.

This is because Orval is bottled with brettanomyces.  This yeast is able to 
utilize dextrins via various dextrinases. Not mead but lambic. :-)

I have not brewed since spring, too busy, kind of warm for fermenting, 
etc.  I saved some yeast then by washing the dregs from the bottom and 
putting in sterile mason jars.  The "yeast" has been in the 
refrigerator since March or April. How do I know if it is good?  I 
assume I shold make a starter and if it begins action I am O.K.?  Is 
there a way to know?  Smell, taste?  Thanx for any help.

Subject: Storing Starters/ American 


While pondering whether to use the American II from Wyeast, I decided that 
while I was doing a yeast starter I would, at the same time, create a starter 
from the dregs of my last bottle of APA using 1056.  I figured that I would 
have 2 starters going in 22 oz bottles, and if I got bad reports from you on 
American II, I would use the 1056.  Well, the news was mixed, but in the 
spirit of experimentation I went ahead and used the new yeast.  Now I have a 
22 oz bottle of 1056 starter, fermented out.  Can I cap this and refrigerate, 
and use it for the next brew session in a couple of weeks?  I figure if I 
decant the 'beer' and add new food, it should work.  Comments? 
 
The feedback on the American II consisted of 2 posts, one negative and one 
positive.  Interestingly, at the same time MANY posts were occuring about 
copyrights and the correct way to calculate resistance.  Did I somehow end up 
in something other than HOMEBREWERS DIGEST? 
 
Regarding bottles:  Here in Wisconsin, in the rural areas, we used to have 
cases of "shorties" which are 8 oz bottles.  They contained basic megaswill 
and came 36, I think, to a case.  Anyone in a rural part of the state aware of 
the availability of these? Also, this may be something EVERYBODY knows, but 
just in case, I discovered that 16 of the 22 0z bottles fit perfectly into 
those plastic milk containers that nobody but the dairys are supposed to have 
but we all did, and used for storing records in college.  Makes for nice 
stacking of bottles, full or empty.

Nope, no concensus. If you have channeling, knifing is a form of gentle 
stirring (gentle so as not to disturb the grain bed to the point of 
getting cloudy runnings) which will tend to redistribute the grain, 
eliminating whatever channels exist.  True, more may eventually form. 
Also true that simply

My third batch of all-grain brew failed miserably.  I designed the recipe

7# Victory malt

1# Wheat malt 
1# Roasted barley 
1# Chocolate malt 
hops, yeast, etc... 
 
I mail ordered this stuff and the guy I talked to on the phone didn't even 
blink an eye.  One would think he would have stopped me and helped me a 
little, but not this guy.  'I'll ship that immediately, have a nice day 
sir!'  I mashed, and mashed, and mashed, and mashed, but the iodine test 
remained black as night.  I finally sparged, boiled, chilled and pitched my 
yeast.  I dumped the batch about a week later.  I called the shop where I 
ordered the stuff to complain that the yeast hadn't worked.  This time I 
talked to a different person who immediately pointed out to me that 1# of 
wheat malt doesn't contain enough enzymes to convert the whole mash.  I 
*thought* victory malt had enzymes...  Moral of the story:  new mashers 
should run their recipes by more experienced mashers before brew day! 
 
Any other newbie-mashing stories out there?

True for 6.5 gallons with SG 1.035, but my impression was that Duffy 
measured the SG after boiling the wort down to ~5 gallons, in which 
case the 18 ppg figure that he calculated is correct.

Point 1:  The original poster *wants* to use a blow-off method.  As to 
their reasons, perhaps you should read the article in Brewing Techniques 
from a month or so ago. 
 
Point 2:  I have used different size tubing for siponing, from 5/16 up, 
and I find that the larger tubing does give faster flow (Gee, that Fluid 
Mechanics stuff does come in handy!), however it was harder for me as a 
beginner to produce consistent siphons without air bubbles, etc.

if by a starter you mean he has it actively fermenting in a quart or so of 
wort, i don't think there is a problem waiting until this weekend.  i've let 
starters go a few days in an erlenmeyer flask.  just keep it relatively cool 
(basement temp) and it should be fine. 
 
if by a starter you mean he popped the envelope, and that's it, i don't know. 
i would recommend that he step it up into a quart of wort in a large bottle/ 
flask to get the cell count up before using it.  as far as preserving a 
swollen envelope, i've never done that.  it seems like they should be okay for 
a few days, though, at a not-too-hot temperature.  make sure he doesn't get 
it too cold and then shock it thermally at pitching.

i can speak from experience only on #2124 and #2278.  i brewed a czech pils 
with the #2278 and a number of beers with #2124 (my favorite) last year. 
In My Humble Opinion, i think the #2278 was a bit more sulfury than #2124, 
which is very clean, and i believe the #2278 in that regard is closer to 
the pilsner urquell yeast.  however, i had no diacetyl and my czech pils 
really wasn't very close to pu.  pretty good, but not close.  you should make 
an effort to run the primary ferment pretty cool (mid 40's, maybe?), and do 
a long cold lagering, from what i understand about the way pu is brewed. this 
is fairly time consuming.

maybe i should have said "raking".  the way i do it is this:  take a regular 
table knife, and a couple of separate times during the sparge (`at` say, 20 
minutes from starting and 40 minutes from starting), cut a cross hatch 
pattern into the bed using 10 or 12 "slices" in one direction and then 
10 or 12 "slices" in the perpendicular direction, while not disturbing the 
bottom 4-6 inches or so of the bed. 
 
now, when i do this, the sparge water level is still above the bed surface, 
and the entire bed is well liquefied, not dry, so what happens is quite a bit 
of mixing, and the effect is that by the end of the raking process, it looks 
like i've stirred up the entire top portion of the bed.  the reason i don't 
just "stir it up" quickly is i'm concerned about the bottom part of the bed 
getting disturbed.  so i take my time and do this slowly. 
 
i agree that "poking" a knife vertically into the bed would probably cause 
chanelling.  i should have explained a bit more, i guess.

i think duffy took the gravity reading at the end of the boil, not the 
beginning.  at that point, he had less than 6.5 gallons.  it's a good 
idea for a brewer having extraction problems to take it at the beginning, 
though, in case he/she/it wants to boost the gravity with extract. 
 
 
a bit long-winded today, i'm afraid, but hopefully this helps.

Many of the beer companies have been packaging in screw-off cap bottles. 
So seeing  the trend towards the screw-off top bottles, I am wondering 
why hasn't anyone put out a screw-off bottle capper for use by 
hombrewers. It can't be that hard to make the capper. 
 
I would try to come up with something if I knew how the breweries got 
those caps on in the first place. Do they screw them on or clamp them on 
like standard caps? May-be I should just ask  JAKE.

Subject: Flame Sanitizing


I have seen a number of recommendations to flame openings of carboys, 
starter flasks, etc. to sanitize them.  However, it would seem to me that 
just passing a flame over the glass would not be sufficient to sanitize 
and leaving it long enough to sanitize would likely heat the glass enough 
to break it.  Is this true?  If there is a point between passing a flame 
across the mouth and heating to breaking that will sanitize glass, how do we 
know when it is reached? 
I would not think wiping with alcohol and flaming it off would be much better 
either.  Is there any point in flaming anything but Pyrex which can be 
safely heated to a point that would kill bacteria and yeast? 
Surely some of you microbiologists out there should be able to answer these 
questions.

Bill Giffin said of Al K's suggestion to double sparge time and mash out close

Why would a slower sparge and mashing out produce a poorer beer?  Is Bill's 
problem with the mash out temp of 176F?  That is the only thing I see that is 
questionable and at that not but a few degrees beyond what I thought was

Perhaps Bill can further enlighten us as to the error in Al's advice.

I'll tell you why bother to use a blowoff tube.  Last nite I fermented a 60% 
wheat 40% barley brew in a 6 gal. fermenter.  The wort was about 4.5 gallons 
with a nice eight inch space for the foam to expand into.  So I did it at 
room temperature 75-80F. When I went to bed it was going smoothly with a 
three inch foam head. When I looked at it the next morning it was 
overflowing onto the floor, etc.. 
 
So the lesson I have learned is to always use a blowoff tube especially when 
I ferment in the foyer close to the carpet.  Lucky for me the foam did not 
reach the carpet and stayed on the tile. 
 
Now Bill, as far as complaining when someone asks for and then gets advice, 
all I can tell you is to shorten your internet cable by cuting it and see if 
you are happier.

Subject: priming/under cabonation and posting receipes


     Greetings brewnerds! 
 
     Two things today! 
 
     I have seem to have been having problems with carbonation.  All of my 
     batches seem to be, well, not quite carbonated enought. It's there, 
     but won't seem to hold a head very long, nor is there a lot of bubbles 
     in the glass after only a couple of minutes. 
 
     I'm doing ale extracts and partial mashes, and priming with .75 cup 
     dextrose. 
 
     I realize that some ale's are typically not as strongly carbonated as 
     others, but I think that mine are still a little weak.  As far as I 
     can read, my options are: 
 
     1. areate a little when priming with .75c dextrose to help 
     re-establish the yeast more. (bad, bacteria problems) 
 
     2. add more dextrose (bad, bottles may explode, or too much 
     carbonation) 
 
     3. start priming with malt extract (never done it, no expectations) 
 
     Any suggestions/tips? 
 
 
     The second item I have today is in reguards to posting receipes. Is 
     there a policy of not posting receipes to HBD? I see a lot of 
     requests, and I have made requests and 90% of replys are by e-mail 
     (thanks all that replied). Unfortunatly, if I'm not the requester, I 
     don't get to see the e-mailed replies, and therefore can't review 
     them, or "cut" them out to save and try later!  I realize that this 
     may cause the Digest to take up more bandwidth, but it's current'y 
     already 30-40kb now. 
 
     Comments? Policies? Would somebody set me straight!  Please spam and 
     flame me by direct e-mail, nobody want's that on the list!!! 
 
     Thanks!

Subject: A source for 7-8oz bottles


Charles Epp asks about little bottles: 
 
> Anybody know of a source (preferably inexpensive)for small, cappable 
> bottles in the 7-8 oz. size? 
 
There is a very popular drink in some Latin American countries called "Malta" 
(notice the root word "malt") that comes in 8oz bottles.  I have a friend who 
is from Puerto Rico who drinks it, but her brand uses "twist-off" caps. 
I have a friend (and fellow brewer) whose wife is from Columbia and, by no 
coincidence, drinks a brand that uses ordinary caps.  I think the brand is 
"Bohio", but I may be wrong. 
 
Malta is available in most grocery stores here in Tampa, Florida, but we also 
have a large Latin American population.  In short, check with your Latin 
American friends and see if any of them drink malta, or try it yourself. 
Personally, it just makes my thirsty, but if I didn't already have a source 
I might be willing to drink it regularly for the bottles. 
 
I hope this helps.

If your (or Miguel's) hops are like mine, you wont need to worry 
about developing stronger rootstock.  I have some roots 2" in diameter! 
 
Every spring, I have to dig a circle around my hops to limit grown and

Subject: Polyclar,


Brewsters: 
 
Keith Busby asks about using Polyclar for his Belgian Trippel. I thought I sent
in a brief description of various clarifiers a week or so ago, but it may have 
been during another screw-up with my mailer. I don't remember it appearing ( I 
don't re-read my own submissions and I may have downpaged)  I include it here 
again in case it didn't make it, along with parts of a private communication in
which I extended the discussion. 
 
Polyclar reacts with the catechins (a type of polyphenol or  tannin) which 
removes it from the playing field and it can't hydogen bond to the proteins. 
This hydrogen binded complex between tannins and protein makes them less 
soluble
and appear as chill haze.  Dave Miller( H'Book of HB, p 193) uses tremendous 
amounts of polyclar (up to 1/4 cup per 5 gallons) - but see below.   I propose 
that this quantity is so large because he suggests using Polyclar and Bentonite
together. I suggest you use both but not together. Add the polyclar and after  
it has had its effect, say 24 hours, add the bentonite. Test the various levels
for your beer in small quantities, say 7 oz in several bottles in the fridge 
and
use the minimum of each to get what you want. Miller comments that the Polyclar
releases CO2 dissolved in the beer, so watch out! Since Bentonite removes 
protein and protein is bad in wine ( use all the Bentonite you want, no bad 
effects) and protein is good in beer you will have to add the minimum amount. 
In
agreement with Milller, I suggest you start with 0.5ppm and go down to get the 
right level. 
 
 
My quotes from my communication to HBD: 
 
"Further on this subject, I just received the 96 catalog from Fall Bright, The 
Winemakers Shoppe, Dundee, NY 
 ( no affil. etc.) and they had a nice short summary on the subject of 
clarifying aids (with an emphasis on use 
in wines) which I hope is interesting to HBDers for its general content as well
as those making fruit beers 
and wines as well as beer: Following is a re-typed (by me) version of their P. 
15: 
 
"GELATIN has a *positive charge* and precipitates negative charged tannin. It 
is
excellent to reduce tannin. Sprinkle (2 grams or approx. 1 tsp per 5 gallons 
onto cold wine. soak 5 minutes, warm until dissolved, but avoid excessive 
heating. If using in combination with tannin, add tannin first ( dissolved in 
wine) by racking 
 the wine onto the tannin solution.  Let rest for 24 hours and add dissolved 
gelatin. Allow 2-3 weeks to settle. There might be a slight color loss. Gelatin
is not usually recommended for white wine. 
 
SPARKOLLOID is a polysaccharide in a diatomaceous (earth)* carrier with a 
*positive charge*. It does not strip color. For 5 gallons, dissolve 2.3 grams  
(1-3/4 tsp) in 1/2 cup of boiling water. Simmer about 15 minuntes until mixture
is smooth and creamy, may agitate in a blender.  Add some wine to thin and add 
to wine.  Agitate well.  Wait 1-2 weeks after use for settling. 
 
BENTONITE has a *negative charge*  Wines with a higher pH will require more 
bentonite (to)* obtain the 
same results of less at a lower pH. Use 2.4 to 4.5 grams per 5 gallons. (2.6   
grams of granular Bentonite = 1/2 plus 1/8 tsp).  Mix Bentonite with 5 oz. of 
water. let stand overnight or for at least 2 hours. Mix some wine back into the
slurry and add to wine.  This is fast acting.  You can probably rack in 24 
hours. 
 
EGG WHITE is used only on red wines. Separate the yolk ( discard), add a pinch 
of salt and whip to a froth. 
1 egg per 5 gallons. Mix beaten egg in 10 times the volume of wine and add to  
the main volume. 
 
PVPP OR POLYVINYL-POLYPYRROLIDONE, alias Polyclar  Reacts with tannins and 
reduces browning due 
 to a strong affinity for catechins.   Use .28 to .95 grams per gallon ( .28 
gms. = 1/2 tsp.) for wine and beer.  Filtration recommended after use. 
 
PECTIC ENZYME added at crushing helps release juice form ( sic) pulp increasing
juice yields and improving rates of settling, clarification, fining and 
filtration.  Normal use at crushing is 4-8 drops per gallon on hybrids and 
viniferas; 10-14 drops per gallon on American grape varieties  and double that 
on fruits like peaches, plums,apples,strawberries.  Let set on enzyme for 4-8 
hours before pressing.  Cover fruit with plastic to prevent oxidation.

instruction labels from 
 Fall Bright."

And from a private e-mail: 
 
"Julianne, after our discussion, I decided to amplify and simplify this even 
further:

                                      Anthocyanogens 
 
Many of the proteinaceous products have both positive and negative sites on 
them, but at beer pH, generally they are positive. Isinglass and soluble 
collagen type finings work best at pH of 4.4, but 4.0 is almost as good. M&BS 
p545 ed 1.  Chill-haze largely is a reaction between tannins and protein. 
Polyclar reacts with the tannins reducing the concentration of the chill-haze/ 
tannin protein complex. It is interesting that hop bitter principles are a 
special class of polyphenols. 
 
Other factors which should be taken into account is the role metals can play in
haze formation.  Copper, iron and aluminum, are concentrated by 4000-80,000 
times in hazes as compared with residual beer. lead,nickel,tin vanadium and 
molybdenum are concentrated 1000-4000 times and manganese, calcium and calcium 
are concentrated only about 100 times. (Malting & Brewing Science p 633, 1st 
ed.)  A well water supply to a house with copper pipes can easily have copper 
and iron.  If an aluminum kettle is used, then you could easily get all three. 
Time to buy a Brita water filter which will remove all of these." 
 
 
I see I left out nylon in my discussion.  Nylon is used for removal of 
anthocyanogens and belongs in the positive class. 
 
M&BS says (p 636 ed 1) "Much of the protein in the wort is therefore present as
a complex with polyphenols." And   "There is, however, no correlation between 
anthocyanogens and haze potential of the beer."  And ".....it is believed that 
all of the polyphenolic constituents of beer take part in haze formation." 
 
I guess that means too many hops lead to hazy beer!  Maybe one of the reasons 
Belgians use old hops in which the polyphenols are oxidized and polymerized ( 
low bitterness) and insoluble in wort is because they don't cause a haze 
problem.  Anyone have any experience in this area?

Subject: Very fine mesh for a false bottom


 
 
Hello, 
 
A couple of weeks ago while at a flea-market a guy who goes around to companies
and buys random surplus "junk" had something that really caught my eye. He had 
some stainless wire mesh that had come out a huge centrifuge.  He had gotten 
a sheet of this mesh which proabably measured 4' by 15'(the 15' is a guess 
since
he had it cut up into thirds).  It is 84 mesh(84 wires to the inch) and the 
wires have a diameter of 0.0035".  This is a VERY FINE mesh.  He said that 
this stuff runs about $100 a square foot, but take that with a grain of salt. 
I got my sheet, 4' X 6' for $5:) 
 
The original sheet has reinforcement ribs of cloth that run lengthwise down 
the edges and once down the center and are on both sides of the mesh. They are 
probably epoxied down and if they had to come off the only way I can think of 
would be with a torch and just burn the cloth and epoxy off. There was a place 
on my section where someone had taken a oxy-acet torch to it and it was a 
little
discolored, but it disapated the heat so well that there is no noticable loss 
in strength.  Now I don't feel that the cloth would contribute anything first 
because people have been using grain and hop bags for years, secondly because 
this centrifudge was from Eli Lilly Parmesuticals(supposedly). So maybe I might
be able to make a Prozac Porter. (It was used for drying or something so no 
drug
reside exists, otherwise it would have never gotten to the public.) 
 
 
Anyway, I am wondering two things: 
   Is this mesh too fine for a false bottom? 
       I don't think the slightest bit of draff would make it's way past. 
       The percent open area is a tick over 50%!  Water flows through it 
with no problems. There is a little beading due to surface tension, but        
       nothing significant. 
   What kind of false bottom to design? 
       Currently I am using a 10 gal gott with a circular copper manifold.  I 
       am looking to eventually move towards the use of a RIMS system. which 
       kinda goes back to the question of is this mesh too fine.  Ideas that I 
       have had are to construct a frame that would allow for a similar shape 
       to the Phil's Phalse Bottom, but that would take up a lot of material. 
 
Another idea was a copper manifold that had many mesh fingers emminating       
       from a central line down the middle: 
  
  ######I###### 
        I 
                  ######I###### 
                        I 
                  ######I###### 
        I 
 
If it seems feasible and I go for it there should still be LOTS of this mesh 
leftover, and last week he still had more of this stuff.  So, anyone wanting 
some just let me know.  The shop I frequent is talking to people for ideas 
about what to do as well, and it is somewhat puzzling.  As a side note this is 
my first post after about a year and half and 15 all-grain batches later. This 
digest is a weath of knowledge. The points and counterpoints allow many lurkers
like myself to learn a great deal. To all posters and especiallly the regulars 
I thank you for all the indirect help/hints/knowlege.. 
 
Thanks, 
Doug Cook

   Related to this, I've been using B-Brite to clean kegs and to sanitise. 
This with the beleif that B-Brite is indeed a sanitizer though I have not 
seen that it is.  So, is it?  B-Brite a sanitizer that is!  I've not had an
