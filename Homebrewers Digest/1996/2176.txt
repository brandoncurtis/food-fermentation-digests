Subject: FDA regs online, dryhopping


For those who would like to look up FDA regulations on line you can find 
them at:   http://law.house.gov/cfr.htm 
 
Click on the "14 Most Frequently Asked Questions" and go from there.   Most 
food uses of plastics, resins, adhesives, etc. are found in the 21 CFR 
section.   CFR = Code of Federal Regulations. 
 
Dry hopping - I've done the marbles-in-a-bag routine more than once, but I 
won't do it again.  My advice is to just dump the hops (pellets or whole) 
into your fermenter as is.  When it comes time to bottle put a sanitized 
nylon strainer bag over you racking cane (or nylon hose as recommended 
before on HBD).  You will find very little to zero hop residue is 
transferred over. 
 
If you use the hop pellets in a bag method you will find that some of the 
contents will work its way out of the bag anyway. 
 
I agree with Al K. on this on this one, keep it simple.  And don't forget, 
you can dry hop in the primary.  Just use a glass fermenter and keep the 
temperature down.

Bill writes, quoting me: 
>>The answer to your question is: throw the tubing out and buy more.  You 
>>can't clean it well enough to siphon beer with it anymore. 
 
>Wrong you can clean tubing with a tubing brush.  No PROBLEM! 
 
Using a tubing brush to try to clean blowoff out of a 5/16" ID plastic tube 
will: 
 
1. take forever, and 
2. probably scratch the inside which will give bacteria a place to hide 
(remember... he wants to siphon beer and (possibly) wort through it). 
 
Bill again: 
>Why bother to use a blowoff tube in the first place.  Use a bigger carboy 
>or a crock or a bigger pail.  Al I would hope that we are all smart 
>enough to use food grade, but why 5/16" I think that is a bit small.  Why 
>not 3/8" or 1/2"?  Far better in my most humble and unknowing opinion. 
 
Why? Because he already owns a carboy which blows off. He can brew 4 gallons in
stead of 5, but this is 20% less beer for the same amount of work. Why make him
buy
a $19.00 carboy or $10.00 pail when he could buy a $4.00 hose? 
 
As for food grade, there was a post here in HBD about a guy who made 5 gallons 
of plastic-flavoured beer by siphoning through hardware-store-variety PVC hose.
We're not all as smart as you, Bill. 
 
Why 5/16" and not 3/8" or 1/2"? Because 5/16" is the proper size for the 
standard
racking canes and bottling wands. A larger size increases the likelyhood that a
bubble would form where the racking cane meets the tubing. If you simply stick 
the
hose in the bucket without a racking cane and don't use a bottle filler, then 
any size tubing that will fit into the neck of a bottle will work. 
 
I'm tempted to call you some name, Bill, but it's not worth further cluttering 
HBD with bile. If you have a personal problem with me, send me private email, 
don't
waste everyone else's time.

I believe (based upon Rager's formulas) that only 22% more hops are needed 
if you boil 2.5 gallons in stead of 5 (for this gravity beer (about 1.047)).

Only the outside.  I've read (here in HBD) that overscrubbing stainless steel 
will wear off the oxide layer and the beer you make will taste metallic till 
the oxide layer reforms.

Orval is bottled with a blend of yeasts, one of which is a Brettanomyces 
strain.
It is this Brett yeast that gives Orval that characteristic nose. Brettanomyces
yeasts are known for being very good attenuators. The attenuation I got from 
the
yeast I cultured from a bottle of Orval (and did make beer that smelled/tasted 
like
Orval) had about 80-85% apparent attenuation. Any chance you got a slight 
bacterial
infection in those three batches? Incidentally, this yeast is incredibly 
ssslllooowww.
Actually, Orval is fermented with a more neutral, Saccharomyces yeast and then 
conditioned warm with the Brett yeast.

     Thanks for the quick response.  I had half a dozen, before I even got 
     the last digest with my question in it.  Most suggested just building 
     a bigger starter a few hours or a day before brewing.  Some suggested 
     building a starter in the first place, so my message must have been 
     unclear.  My friend had already built a 12 oz starter in a 16 oz mason 
     jar and it was estimated to reach high krausen last night.  This was 
     only his 3rd batch, 2nd with liquid yeast, and he has already learned 
     to relax.

Subject: Mead Carbonation


I am about to bottle a couple of gallon jugs of mead I have and 
was wondering how much corn sugar is required to carbonate a 
25oz bottle? Since there are only going to be about 5 25oz bottles 
I figure it is probably easier to bottle prime than batch prime. 
 
I plan on using 1 teaspoon of corn sugar for each 25oz bottle. 
 
Any one see any holes in this procedure?

***RANT MODE ON*** 
 
Okay here is my two cents on this subject: 
 
Hey Bill, 
 
Have you ever read a book about brewing methods or practices? 
 
Do you do all your sparging in less than ten minutes? 
 
Do you stir your sparge to? 
 
Have you ever even brewed All-Grain? 
 
I have in just about every brewing science/homebrewing book read that the 
minimal sparge time for a good clear wort is between 35-45 minutes at temp 
in excess of 170 f. You are also supposed to re-circulate your sparge which 
for me almost always causes me to have at least a 40 minute sparge time. 
 
I think it's one thing to give your opinion to the HBD and another to down 
right be rude. Al is one of the best read brewers in this forum and whether 
you like him or not, the man at least deserves the right to be treated in a 
decent manner. 
 
I personally am getting really sick of this forum being treated like a 
flame zone. 
 
If anyone is going to call someone else's post a piece of shit and say it's 
wrong then for cripes sake BACK IT UP WITH THE CORRECT ANSWER TO THE 
ORIGINAL STATEMENT. 
 
If you know the way then enlighten us with the correct answers and stop 
bashing fellow brewers with your FUNDEMENTALIST FROGWASH!

Brewsters: 
 
AlK says he thinks malt should be crushed until it is ideally *all* flour Maybe
he has a different definition of flour than most people. 
 
Gregg Noonan in his "New Brewing Lager Beer" p 122-123 
 
"The best grist is obtained from six-row malt mills, which crush the malt by 
running it between three successive pairs of rolls ten to twelve inches in 
diameter, each pair being set closer together and turning faster than the 
previous pair. Screens are placed between each set of rolls to allow the fine 
grits to fall through, so they are *not* pulverized into *flour* by  further 
crushing.More than 75 percent of the malt may be reduced to grits in this 
manner
- - the remaining part being hulls and flour. *More than 10 percent flour is 
undesirable* because it balls and cakes readily.  Balled flour is inaccessible 
to enzymes and results in unconverted starch, some of which washes into the 
wort
during sparging, causing an irreversible haze in the beer." 
 
Not to mention a set mash and a difficult sparge for a grist with lots of 
flour.
He goes on to say that coarsely ground malts are no good either, since they 
give
poor extract efficiency.  Only well modified malts can use a coarse crush and 
not give reduced efficiency. 
 
*Emphasis* is mine

Dave Greenlee asks if smoke from peach tree wood contains cyanide as he heard 
that all parts of the peach trees are loaded with cyanide. 
 
I sincerely doubt it. 
 
This rumor may have started when someone tasted the pit which has the aroma of 
bitter almonds and which is the smell of hydrogen cyanide. A secret to making a
peach pie peachier is to grate a little of the almond shaped pit ( inside the 
hard shell) into the pie.  It adds a subtle difference.  Lots of state fair 
prizes are won this way.  Lots of things smell like bitter almonds, a benzene 
ring with a highly polar substitution. like a nitro or cyano group smells of 
bitter almonds. It has to do with the shape and polarity of the detector site 
in
the nose and the shape and polarity of the chemical in the vapor. If they match
up, Bingo! Bitter almond or Saaz or Cascades ...............

Dave G. Look in Papazian's books for extract potential tables. His HB Companion
has two pages of "Malt Table" plus later info on adjuncts. You may have to ask 
the manufacturer about liquid malt extracts or measure it yourself with a 
hydrometer after you dilute a weighed amount. All DMEs should be the same.

Subject: Potential screen for mash/laeuter tun?


 
        So there I was in Home Depot (you know this is going no where good), 
and I come across some plastic siding louver vents, 18X12". these vents are 
made of lead free plastic(I checked), and have a zig zag surface on which 
the zig side is full of 3 cm slots; the vent part, and the zag is solid 
white plastic. These dimensions are such that it fits right in the bottom of 
a 48 quart cooler that I  want to use for mashing, so I'm thinking about 
using this vent as a a screen. 
 
        I have heard various cautions about using plastic that is not food 
grade, this vent most likely is not, so what are the potential nasties that 
could be in it other than lead which should be watched for? What are the 
preferred alternatives, keeping in mind I don't prefer to sit in front of a 
plastic bucket for an hour with my power drill. Thanks for you input!

Subject: Duffy's extraction, grain in freezer


 
     The Duffy's extraction thread is a good one.  Poor extraction is 
probably a concern of 90% of all-grain brewers.  I typically get around 23 - 
25 pt/lb/gal.  This is a far cry from the 30 - 35 pt/lb/gal that I often see 
referred to.  My next step to improve my extraction will be to add some 
gypsum to my water to lower the ph.  I don't have a fancy ph meter and the 
papers don't seem to work in my dark ales so I'm just going to wing it.  My 
water is very soft so I'll try 8g per 5 US gal.  After that I think I'll 
look at trying a finer grind of my grains. 
     Anyway, I have two questions.  Regarding improving extraction rates 
Mark Bayer states; 
 
> 6)  extend the sacch. rest to 1.5 or 2 hours, regardless of the iodine 
test . 
 
     Why?  Should the iodine test not be trusted?  Is there substantially 
more sugar available even after the iodine shows no color change?  Do I 
really have to sit and watch sitcoms for an extra hour during brewing? 
 
     My second question is, can I store malted grains in my freezer?  I have 
room in my freezer but my wife keeps filling the fridge with food! I've 
tried to reason with her but to no avail. 
     Back to lurking.  Keep brewing.

Subject: Under Carbonation


Allen asks about under carbonation. 
   Seems to have been a lot in HBD about carbonation and the advice to 
weigh the dextrose was a good one.  I did this recently and would have 
undershot my result by 20% if I had only gone by volume.  3/4 cup of 
dextrose should be 4oz by weight, but measure it by weight as it might 
take a bit more than 3/4 cup.  Note that many kits come with 5oz 
probably because American beers are more carbonated generally speaking 
than your average British or German.  I recently tried carbonating with 
1 cup of honey and that worked quite well and quickly.  Since the recipe 
had honey in it, I wasn't worried about changing the taste of the beer 
too much by using honey. If you are carbonating a lager or something 
that isn't near room temperature (70F), you will have to correct for the 
dissolved CO2 in your wort and there's a couple of good articles on the 
brewery for carbonation. 
1)  Don't aerate at bottling to active the yeast. BAD BAD BAD. 
2)  Be patient!  It may take some time to carbonate especially if you 
try malt extract.  All of my beers that seemed undercarbonated at first 
got better with time.  Seems that the stronger beers take longer to 
carbonate too. 
   Hope that helps.

Subject: Under Carbonation 2


Follow on to Allen, 
   Though I think carbonation and head are related, I think of 
carbonation as the bubbling rate of the beer and head as the foam you 
get when you pour the beer.  While a very carbonated beer will probably 
give a good head it may not hold the head depending on a number of other 
factors.  I don't think you are getting bad carbonation just because the 
head falls off.  I've heard wheat helps head retention maybe some wiser 
persons than myself can post some information on head vs. carbonation. 
Hope this helps.

Subject: Knifing and channelling...


 I'm not sure Al, if the HBD came to a consensus on this subject. 
Concensus is not the correct way to go about solving this discussion. 
Some sort of study should be warrented.  I'm not one for Aristotelian 
logic. 
 
 I suspect, that channelling is more severe (in stuck sparges) 
in beds that are uncut.  Since many breweries use a process of "cutting" 
the grainbed, it seems somewhat logical that it aids in the lautering 
process in someway.  It would be counter productive if it increased 
channelling.  Just an opinion mind.  I'll wait for the study.

 -Ensure the crush is adequate 
 -Calibrate your thermometer and your hydrometer 
 -Use a loongg slooww sparge, sparge until runnings are 1.010 
 -Use a mash out step whenever possible, keep your grain bed hot during the

 -Make sure the temp of the sparge water is 170 *at the grain bed* 
 -Use a acidification reset if possible

 David Root  Droot`at`concentric.net  Lockport NY 
I hope this helps some people.  I was brewing in my back yard when I ran 
out of 
propane.  Since my neighbor was not home, I "borrowed" his tank.  When I 
was 
returning the tank, he pulled into the driveway.  I was a little 
embaressed. 
The trick to LP (liquid propane) tanks is to weigh the tank and you will 
know 
how much is in it.  An empty tank weighs 18 Lbs. It holds 20 Lbs of 
propane. 
38 Lbs for a full tank, and 18 empty. 
 Another way is to pour hot water down the side.  Where the liquid 
propane levil is, the tank will be colder than where it is not. This works 
well.

Subject: Malt extract.


 
Dear friends: 
 
As I have already informed you, it is very difficult to find brewing 
ingredients in my country (Uruguay). For this and because I am decided to 
homebrew, I have been looking different ways to obtain what I need. I can 
get pale ale malt, s. cererevisiae and bayanus for wine production and 
probably some kind of hops. 
I have also find now a certain malt extract used to make bread. This malt 
extract contains: 
maltose  45 - 55% 
dextrine 20% 
proteins 5 -6% 
ash      30. - 3.2% 
total solids 73 - 75% 
Brix     80 - 83 
 
I wonder whether this kind of malt extract is appropriate for brewing 
some kind of beer. Any suggestions or comments? 
 
It seems that the most difficult products to get here are hops. For this 
reason, I also want to ask you if there is any other product different 
from  hops for "hopping" beer. Any suggestion? 
 
Thanks in advance for your replies.

Charlie> This is sound advice, the time for low sugar-concentrated sparge 
water to osmotically penetrate sugar-concentrated grain particles and leach 
out sugars is longer than it takes for the sparge water to simply run 
through the bed. Thus, for efficient extraction, the slower sparge the 
better, limited only by boredom or lactic bacteria activity. This requires 
some outlet restriction to slow it down, big brewers call this valve a 
"grant valve".

Charlie> Why is it "hogwash"? This advice is supported both by brewing 
science and my own experimentation with a control batch for comparison. I am 
interested to know why these techniques lead to a "poorer beer" because I am 
preparing a lauter FAQ? Do you have references I could study? 
 
Bill>Go to the problem, 
Bill>the crush.  At least 50% of your crushed grain should pass through a 
Bill>normal window screen. 
 
Charlie>Yes it should, that is a good rule of thumb, easily checkable by 
homebrewers. BUT, the fine/coarse difference published for most modern malts 
is less than 3%. That means in a *laboratory* they found less than 3% 
difference extraction between flour and the coarsest of crushes. This is 
less than 1 point per gallon! 
 
However, as Al K likes to point out, homebrewers don't brew in laboratories! 
With rapid lautering at lower temperatures, the fineness of the crush will 
make a much bigger difference. This is indicative of poor lautering, not 
poor crushing. 
 
I recommend as coarse a crush as possible to reduce polyphenol extraction. I 
also recommend a very slow lauter to reduce foam-negative and 
staling-negative lipid extraction. For the same reasons I suggest 
terminating the sparge at 1.015 SG. The coarse crush and earlier termination 
will reduce your extraction points slightly, maybe 2 points max, but enonomy 
of grain usage to that extent shouldn't worry a homebrewer. 
 
The suggestions of forced lautering by squeezing the bed *after sparge* will 
improve the extraction at the expense of increased lipid extraction. 
Squeezing it *instead of sparge* will reduce extraction dramatically. As I 
pointed out above, the lauter is not just a mechanical process, solubility 
and osmotic cross-particle pressures play a part which simple squeezing 
precludes. The rapid lauter by water under pressure in frame type mash 
filters is being  abandoned because of high lipid extraction. In commercial 
brewing the Stainmasterss and mash filters are increasingly giving way to 
the traditional lauter tun.

Subject: Calcium computation


I've been lurking here for a while, and have definitely picked up 
a ton of solid information, for which I thank everyone.  I either 
missed, or perhaps it never was mentioned, any way to figure the 
amount of Calcium in water.  An analysis that I have indicates the 
CaCo3 Alkalinity, Calcium Hardness as CaCo3 = 169 and Total Hardness 
as CaCo3 = 228. 
 
Does a simple subtraction there give me the amount of temporary 
hardness? 
 
A comment - not to get on the wrong foot here, but today's replies 
by Bill Giffin to Al K. seemed somewhat harsh.  Unless they are 
good buddies, I would imagine a discussion could be carried out 
without using words like "Hogwash". 
 
Along with that, I take it that Al K. is subtly suggesting that, 
indeed, the sparging time needed to be lengthened.  Bill says, in 
effect, that this should be ignored and that the real problem, in 
his opinion, was the coarse grind.  According to the literature 
I have read, 35 minutes of sparging is really way too fast.  Since 
it is a whole lot easier to check the matter by increasing the 
sparge time, Bill, perhaps this might be the first thing to check-- 
even though it is surely possible that the grind was too coarse. 
 
Just a thought.

 Iwasn't part of this consensus. Cutting any depth is not going to create 
channeling *if the flow is stopped*. It makes sense, no flow, no river 
effect. However if you cut really deep you will need to recirculate a bit to 
re-establish "set" and clarity. Cutting will cause the resettling of grain 
particles.

I wouldn't touch a *flowing* bed to counteract channelling. I *would* cut 
the top 1/4 of the flowing bed to aleviate sticking of the sparge because 
the semi-impervious top dough is there. If you want to correct channeling, 
stop the flow. However in my experiments, I have trouble *inducing* 
channeling in small lauters. I am beginning to suspect it is more a large 
scale problem that we HBers are blaming for other problems. 
 
Al K>I've just thought of a test to see if you are experiencing channelling. 
Al K>Half way through the laeuter, divert the runnings to a quart jar.  After

Digging around at the Brewery site once upon a time I found the 
following:  Statutory Recognition of the home production of beer, at 
http://alpha.rollanet.org/AOB/legal/list.html 
 
The authors seem to have done a very thorough job of researching the 
various applicable statutes for each state. =20 
 
As to Ray's specific concerns about WA: 
[begin statutes] 
 
Special Provisions: 
=A766.28.140 provides for the removal of family wine or beer (implied by 
=A766.12.010) for use in tastings or competitions.=20 
 
66.12.010. Wine or beer manufactured for home use=20 
Nothing in this title other than RCW 66.28.140, applies to wine or 
beer manufactured in any home for consumption therein, and not for 
sale.=20 
 
66.28.140. Removing family wine from home for exhibition or use at 
wine tastings or competitions--Conditions=20 
 
(1) An adult member of a household may remove family wine from the 
home for exhibition or use at organized wine tastings or competitions, 
subject to the following conditions:=20 
 
(a) The quantity removed by a producer for these purposes is limited 
to a quantity not exceeding one gallon;=20 
 
(b) Family wine is not removed for sale or for the use of any person 
other than the producer. This subparagraph does not preclude any 
necessary tasting of the wine when the exhibition or wine tasting 
includes judging the merits of the wine by judges who have been 
selected by the organization sponsoring the affair; and=20 
 
(c) When the display contest or judging purpose has been served, any 
remaining portion of the sample is returned to the family premises 
from which removed.=20 
 
(2) As used in this section, "family wine" means wine manufactured in 
the home for consumption therein, and not for sale.=20 
 
[end statutes] 
 
You might get away with calling the reception a "tasting" however I 
think rule 1 (a) would get you with the 1 gallon limit.
