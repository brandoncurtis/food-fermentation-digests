He said: 
" The classic problem with channeling is that 
a significant portion of the fluid takes a 'short cut' through the bed, 
rather than being evenly distributed.  In doing so, it quickly extracts all 
of the solubles from that tiny region, and thus extracts nothing form the 
majority of the bed. Picture a straw in your grain bed, running from the top 
 
surface to the outlet.  Whether the flow is fast or slow is unimportant, the 
 
point is that this flow is not doing any extracting." 
 
Well, Chuck, if you'll notice, flow through that straw is potentially a 
great deal faster than flow through the grain.  The channeling issue is 
essentially  formation of a preferential flow path through the grain, as you 
said. That flow path, or short cut, conducts fluid much faster than the rest 
of the grain.  What is available to be extracted in that grain is extracted 
rapidly.    Per unit time, a higher volume will pass through that short cut. 
 This volume may have a lower gravity because it does not approach chemical 
equilibrium with the surrounding grain as well as in the rest of the bed. It 
may have a similar gravity intially because of leakage from the surrounding 
bed, or some other reason which is beyond the control of the experiment. 
 Flow (volume per unit time) will always reflect channelling.  Gravity may 
not, in the duration of this experiment, given the volumes we're going to 
use. 
 
If you think of lautering in two components: chemical and physical, I think 
you'll see we agree violently..

Subject: Fruit beer too sweet


 
last weekend I brewed a strawberry blonde ale using wyeast #1056. 
Ferementation was pretty wild for the first 2 days, then died down a 
little. By the 4th day, there was no activity at all. I racked to 
secondary on day 5. Before doing so, I added 3 more lbs. strawberries 
to the secondary and racked on top of them. I took a hydrometer 
reading yesterday and it was around 1.013 and the beer tasted very 
sweet. Actually, too sweet. The reason I racked to secondary so 
early was in hope of getting some more fermentation out of the new 
strawberries - this didn't seem to happen. A friend suggested nutrients, 
or maybe adding some more yeast. I think this is a good idea, but was 
wondering if anyone here can share a little experience with me. I'd like 
to bring the sweetness down a little bit. Also, if I do, will this remove 
some of the strawberry character? Thanks alot.

Subject: Yeast not getting older, getting better


Hey HBDers, 
 
The guy at a local homebrew store was giving me a bit of advice about 
yeast.  I had planned to make a porter and a stout using the same yeast 
from a Wyeast packet.  I brewed the porter about 2 weeks ago and pitched 
yeast from the porter batch into a stout last night.  The guy at the 
store said the yeast would actually be better the second time around.  Is 
this true?  I know the advantages of larger pitching rates, but what 
about quality.  Does yeast really improve with use?  I know there's 
nothing I can do about the stout batch now, but I'm curious about whether 
I should try to salvage some of the resulting yeast once the batch is done.

Hmmm.  I just wanted to note that I rarely see a recipe where I have to 
guess the efficiency (or at least points/lb).  If the recipe says it was 
5 gallons, 1.050 OG, 10 lbs. of pale ale malt, then I say they got 25 
pts/lb.  If they used 8 lbs and everything else was the same, I say they 
got 31+ pts/lb.

Subject: Motorizing Malt Mills


Greetings all! 
FWIW: Dave in Indy's positing in one of last weeks Digests got me to 
thinking. Sometimes folks ask about putting a motor in their MaltMill(TM 
JSP). OK, just how fast do you want your mill to run? Maybe the following 
info will be useful to those who wish to get away from the sulime and zen 
taks of hand cranking their mills. 
Assuming that you are going to use a 1725 rpm electric motor: 
 
Motor sheave/pulley     Mill sheave/pulley      resulting rpm mill 
        1.5 inches              12 in                   196 
        1.5 in                  10 in                   236 
        1.5 in                  9 in                    258 
        1.5                     8 in                    296 
        2inches                 12 in                   269 
        2 in                    10 in                   324 
        2 in                    9 in                    360 
        2 in                    8 in                    406 
        2.5 in                  12 in                   342 
        2.5                     10                      411 
        2.5                     8                       516 
 
A search of the archives of the HBD will show you that most people have been 
gearing their mills to run about 400 rpm.  I'm currentling using a variable 
pitch sheave on a 1725 rpm 1/2 hp motor and an 8 in sheave on the mill.I'd 
planned on using a 1.5 in motor sheave, but screwed up and didn't measeure 
the motor shaft befor I ordered the sheave. Mill speed is approximately 
390-410 rpm. Throughput of 1 lb grain in less than 15 seconds. 
The mill and motor cabinet is constructed out of 1/2 OSB (Yeah, I should 
have used 3/4 ply, but I had the OSB on hand). Bracing of the cabinet uses 
2X4's and the whole thing is glued and screwed together with drywall screws 
(#8x 1 in). The cabinet is finished with three coats of interior semi-gloss 
enamel. The mill empties into a 5 gal bucket located on a shelf below the 
mill. My design uses the weight of the motor to tension the pulley belt. The 
motor is suspended from a 2X4 brace using three 4 in "T" hinges.  The mill 
will easily grind malted wheat and cara-pils (tm) malt with no problems. The 
only modifacation to the mill has been to make an extended hopper from 1/2 
in plywood. The new hopper holds 10 lbs of grain easily. 
Total time invested in the project has been about 8 hours (not counting 
paint drying time). Total cost was around $35 for everything. 
 
Hope that this provides some help for those folks who are thinking of 
motorizing a MaltMill.

Message-ID: <960907173328_103164.3202_IHE49-2`at`CompuServe.COM> 
 
Brewsters: 
 
I'm puzzled.  I read in Pap's books,and now in Greg Noonan's book that iodine 
gives a reaction with the husk fragments.  Greg's "New Brewing Lager Beer" p. 
125 ....."husk fragments which always deeply discolor iodine". 
I presume he means iodine deeply colors husk fragments? Or do the husk 
fragments
remove iodine color from the iodine solution without discoloring themselves? Or
does the iodine turn dark in the presence of husk fragments??? 
 
Some years ago after reading this "fact" that husk fragments discolor with 
iodine in Pap's book (copy no longer available to quote,since my son has it), I
tried to get husk fragments from a mash that had been fully converted, to 
discolor in the presence of iodine - nothing. I had a discussion the other day 
with a HBer and a HB store owner. When we talked about the iodine test the HBer
was using and how important it was to assess completion by testing the spent 
grain as well as the soution,the store owner said to me "but the husks react 
with iodine to give a color".  So members of the HB community believe it from 
somewhere. 
 
I cannot find a reference that says that iodine turns celluose blue-black. From
my own experience I believe that starch free paper ( e.g. filter paper) or 
un-sized cloth do not turn dark purple or blue-black in contact with iodine. 
What is going on here?  Did I do something wrong? Do I mis-understand? or is 
this a momily? 
 
What is your experience, opinion, etc ?. How do you do your test?. Greg ( p143)
floats the iodine solution on the wort sample placed in a porcelain dish " drop
by drop until a distinct layer of iodine (solution?) is formed." I just add 
iodine solution from the drugstore which is soluble in the wort. 
 
Keep on brewin'

Subject: Sparging/bees/LOL


Goodday brew collective: 
 
I wanted to get some ideas on how different people sparge.  The reason I  ask 
is my phils auto sparger thingy (tm) gave up the ghost this weekend ( I think 
it has lime/calcium build up.).  I ended up standing over my lauter tun for an 
hour hand-sparging, trying to keep the bees away from my wort.  Any 
ideas/suggestions? 
 
Which brings me to my second problem.  Whilst brewing in sunny VA on saturday, 
the local bee population took a liking to my brew supplies.  After just 
finishing my boil, prior to chilling, an interested bee took a nose dive into 
the brew pot.  Needless to say, he died a happy bee.  My question is  IMBR? 
 
And lastly, I wanted to thank "the coyote" for his recent post re:  just brew 
it.  He comment about mopping up wort off the floor and boiling it had me LOL.

Subject: force carbonation


I have a batch of raspberry wheat(5 gal) in secondary right now.  I 
just bought a corny keg setup to go in my spare fridge.  I would like 
to force carbonate my beer and was wondering the best way to go about 
doing this.  I have the pressure/temp table from the Cat's Meow that 
shows volumes of CO2 at given pressures and temps.  My question is, 
if I am working with chilled beer(~44dF), how should I go about 
carbonating it?  Should I figure out how much CO2 I want in the beer 
and, using the table, set the system up to pressure and let it 
sit?(How many volumes of CO2 in a wheat beer?  How long should I let 
it sit?)  I have heard about shaking the keg with pressure on to 
speed this process.  Most people use a higher pressure than the table 
suggests if they shake the keg to carbonate.  Doesn't this 
overcarbonate the beer?  Please help. 
 
                Thanks, 
 
               Scotty

Subject: RE: weighing propane/CO2 tanks


In an earlier HBD I had suggested weighing propane and/or CO2 tanks 
prior to filling so you could better judge how much was left in the tank. 
Several people commented that the tare weight stamped on the tank would 
be the empty weight.  I went home and looked at my tanks and could find 
a tare weight on a new propane tank but not on an old propane tank or an old 
CO2 tank.  The propane tanks paint is pretty oxidized and perhaps the TW is 
obscured but the CO2 tank seems to have all stamps readable and I find 
nothing indicating TW.  Is this a recent innovation?  I have looked very 
carefully all over my CO2 tank and find nothing labeled TW or any number that 
would be a reasonable weight.  This is not critical as I can weigh my tanks 
on an accurate beam scale I have but I am curious.

Subject: Brewed a beer I don't like; Can I improve this (beer(not))


 
Dear Brewmisters, 
 
 I don't think I've read any talk of trying this at home. 
 
 I brewed my first bad batch of beer,  no contamination just an 
all-grain brown ale 
already in the bottle, or in this case bootled. 
 I attempted to make my first all grain, have made three since then and 
they turned out great 
 But, between my low extraction and the incorrect grains amounts from 
the local home brew store. 
The result is a flat(it is lightly carbonated)  highly hopped ale.  The 
body is very light. 
 
I like a full bodied beer. 
 
So it's not like I can't drink it,  but it's nothing I would share with 
others. 
 This is what I want to do;  either mix up a batch of non-fermentable 
grain to add body, then 
 pour out what's left of about 3 gallons in the bottling bucket give a 
couple of good stirs  add 
 brown sugar for priming, and rebottle. 
    or 
 
 Would I be better cooking the original beer in the pot with addition 
fermentable and non frementables 
and primary a second time. 
 
Private e-mail is fine  I'll sum up for the others

     Something's been nagging away at my tiny little brain and only

     What's going on with this freshness dating thing? It seems that is has 
     never been a concern (at least on beer beverages) until the 
     microbrewery revolution. Is it because most (if not all) microbrewed 
     beers contain no preservatives? Then why, pray tell, have some of my 
     own homebrewed beers maintained their "drinkability" for up to years 
     when secquestered in the deep dark cool reaches of my "beer closet"? 
     They don't contain any preservatives (except the alcohol :) ). Is this

Domenick re-opened discussion of restricting posts to the HBD to 
subscribers only.  I've always been in favor of this idea, and 
moreso now than ever. 
 
If you wonder how bad it's going to get if we don't make this move, 
I bring the following to your attention, especially in light of 
the Viemaster spam last week. 
 
If you'll remember, this spam came from someone at "juno.com". 
I received a snail mail brochure form this company last week 
as well.  Who are they?  They are a company providing FREE e-mail 
access to anyone with a computer and a modem.  You ask for it, 
they give you the software to run, access #'s, and all the 
e-mail you can handle, with all costs being footed by their 
advertisers. 
 
Think of the implication....if you don't pay for it, what better 
way to get an account to spam with?  You can post to any newsgroup 
with just an e-mail account, and can hit any mailing list you can

I'm building up a starter of the Wyeast American II for use in 
a Barleywine we'll be brewing Saturday.  It started in a full 
batch of Pale ale I made (around 1.065).  I've now built it up 
in a 1.080 starter, and when it's done plan on trying a 1.120 
starter.  Anyone used this yeast in a higher gravity brew and 
know how it's alcohol tolerance is?

What sort of CO2 levels are there in beers such as a Chimay?  I 
know my Abbeys taste better with a higher carbonation (more 
appropriate to style as well :) and want to try and keg the 
next batch with the right CO2 from the start.  Any suggestions?

David Cummings asks what he thinks is a crazy question: 
 
<< 
When the beer is in the secondary the only thing that happens 
is that the yeast/trub settles out (if it hasn't already) and there is no 
actual "secondary fermentation."  Am I doing something wrong, or is this 
typical of most "secondary fermentations?" 
>> 
 
Not crazy at all, sir.  I suppose them slow-fermenting lager yeasts might 
still be actively munching away by that time, but with very few exceptions my 
ales have been pretty much "still" by the time they go to secondary (I 
give'em a week usually).  I use the secondary as a clearing vessel.  I don't 
know how AlK and others do it with just a primary; even after finishing 
fermenting my ales still have all kinds of splunge scattered from top to 
bottom.  Some small amount gets carried to the secondary but invariably 
settles out to leave clear beer behind, suitable for kegging or bottling.  If 
I packaged right out of the primary I'd need to serve my beer with a spoon. 
 
Perhaps the terminology springs from naming the vessel rather than describing 
the process.  Guess it could be just as well be a "clearing tank".  Just 
because it's a "fermenter" doen't mean there's any "fermenting" going on, 
what?  It's like, once the yeast is done, is your primary fermenter still a 
fermenter?  Now *that's* deep.

Subject: Effects of high temp fermentation, SPAM


I've got a couple of batches in bottles now that were fermented in my 
basement during the heat of July/August in Seattle (you Gulf Coasters, don't 
laugh, the summertime temperature sometimes soars to 85F up here: I mean HOT 
HOT HOT!). Anyway, ambient basement temperatures hovered around 75F for most 
of the time these beers were fermenting. I used 1056, a yeast I don't often 
use but one that I understood to be more heat tolerant than others. The 
first thing I noticed at bottling was that in both cases the attenuation was 
much higher than I expected, from around 1.060 down to 1.010-1.008. When I 
tried a bottle from the first batch (a kind of strong brown ale) a couple of 
nights ago after two weeks of conditioning, two things were evident: It 
still needed time, carbonation and head were not there yet, and - much more 
disturbing - there was a pronounced off-taste like 'bad' alcohol. Last night 
I bottled the second batch, a more lightly hopped and flavored honey wheat. 
The same funky chemical-alcoholic off flavor was there too. Was I tasting 
fusel alcohols from high fermentation temperatures? Or is this likely 
something else, like an infection? I don't suppose it will go away with 
time, will it? 
 
I wish someone had advised me not to brew during the summer. Jeez.

Regarding Domenick's spew on spams, I agree entirely with his view that they 
degrade the HBD and the suggestion that posts should be limited to

undigested posts results in undigested responses, and the increasing amount 
of noise in the digest (while still low compared to R.C.B) is giving me 
indigestion. On the other hand, over the years I've become much more type 
'B' regarding junk mail and now just pitch it (or PG DOWN) without reading 
it and without letting it raise my blood pressure. Can't say the same about 
the intrusive boiler-room army of telephone soliciters that harrass me at 
home every night, though. But that has nothing to do with brewing...

     I'll have to disagree with this.  The classic problem with channeling 
     is that 
     a significant portion of the fluid takes a 'short cut' through the 
     bed, 
     rather than being evenly distributed.  In doing so, it quickly 
     extracts all 
     of the solubles from that tiny region, and thus extracts nothing form 
     the 
     majority of the bed. Picture a straw in your grain bed, running from 
     the top 
     surface to the outlet.  Whether the flow is fast or slow is 
     unimportant, the 
     point is that this flow is not doing any extracting. << 
 
     Sorry Kelly, flow may be important.  I may be speaking out of turn, 
     since I'm an extract brewer, but this is a diffusion problem.  At slow 
     enough flows, the radial concentration gradient will vanish, even 
     though the liquor in the "channels" isn't in contact with sugar rich 
     grain.  There are actually 2 diffusion problems here.  One is the 
     diffusion of liquor into the grain and the other is diffusion of sugar 
     through the liquor.  What I can't tell you since I don't have the 
     practical experience, is how slow the flow must be to allow diffusion 
     to approach equilibrium.  However, from following the digest, it 
     appears that a 1 - 2 hour sparge for a 5 gallon batch can result in a 
     pretty good extraction under a variety of grain bed conditions.

I had the mash from hell yesterday and I knew it before I started. But since 
I hadn't experienced a stuck mash, I did it anyway. Heres how it happened. 
 
I boiled 1 lb of rice and 1 lb of Bulgar wheat in 2 gallons of water for 
1 hour thursday and left sit overnight, hoping to brew friday. Friday morning 
this mess had turned into a solid chunk of mush (solid mush?). Since Fran 
was beating up the coast I put off brewing until Sunday and refrigerated this 
mess. Sunday morning I pulled it out of the fridge, and dumped it into a big 
pot. It looked like one big gummy bear. Ack. Undeterred, I added a gallon of 
water, heated to 160F and mixed in the rest of my grains. If this wasn't gummy 
enough the rest of my grain bill didn't help.

Needless to say, this set up like concrete in my mash tun. I had to lauter this
in small batches over the course of 3 hours. Stupid yellow jackets were having 
a heyday with all the split grains and sugars everywhere. My arms where sticky 
up to my elbows and the bees kept landing on me! Well to help everything out, 
a huge thunderstorm came, washed away most of my spillage and drove away the 
bees. I had lids over the many buckets holding the grains so no problems there.
As soon as the rain stopped the bees came back and brought all their friends. 
I finally got stung as I was wrapping up the sparge. Just as I began to boil 
the rains came back. This time worse (it rained 5 inches in 2 hours!). I was 
afraid to stand next to my sankes with all the lightning. This brew took me 
from 11:30 am to 7:30 pm to complete. The worst part is, I'm only making this 
beer to appease the Coors drinkers that will inevitably be at my wedding. 
 
This was spurned on from the comment of a bee landing in the wort. I watched 
several go to their deaths in my hot mash and laughed at each one. Sting me, 
die a sugar-coated death!

Subject: carb. in barleywine/legality/spam


Regarding the carbonation level in barleywines - I have used Wyeast 
#1056 in both the barleywines that I made, and it worked very well in 
both; 1st with a S.G. of 1.088, the 2nd at 1.096.  Both fermented 
into the mid-teens in a reasonable period of time.  Both also 
carbonated well with 3/4 cup of corn sugar - but I also gave them 
both a month at room temp. before moving them to the celler for 
storage.  The second one is kinda strange...It gets horrible chill 
haze when first placed in the fridge, but after a week at 40F, it is 
clear as can be???? 
Homebrewing is also illegal here in Pennsylvania, much to many a 
brewers dismay.  There is nothing wrong with a homebrew store, 
however.  Malt syrups, grains, hops and yeast are all legal 
commodities; it's when you put them together and let the yeast make 
alcohol that the trouble starts - blame it on the yeast!!! :-) 
I have asked folks at the Liqour Control Board (state agency) about 
problems with homebrewing.  Their comment to me was that as long as 
you don't try to sell your homebrew, there is very little reason for 
them to go after an individual homebrewer. 
I agree with Dom V. on the SPAM issue; only subscribers to the HBD 
should be able to post to it...it is a minor thing to ask, and will 
keep a lot of sh*t off of the digest.  Most other lists that I 
subscribe to operate that way...

Subject: Another 'Bad Yeast?' Question


Hello Brewers 
 
Last week I purchased Wyeast 1056.  It was fresh(less than two weeks old). 
I got home, popped the pouch and put it in my cellar where I ferment my 
beer.  Next day it was puffed up and I proceeded to make a one pint starter. 
All is going well so far.  I was drinking a homebrew. I was happy.  I cut the 
corner off the pouch and took a wiff before dumping it in the starter.  My 
smile disappeared.  The only way I can describe it is it just didn't smell 
right.  It reminded me more of the area in back of my fraternity bar after 
it hasn't been cleaned in a week than the sweet smell of fresh Chico yeast. 
Since I already did all the work, I continued to dump the yeast in the starter 
to see what happens.  Since I was brewing the next day, I stopped by the 
homebrew store to pick up some dry yeast.  When I told the guy of my story, he 
said "If it puffed up, then the yeast was fine."  My only arguement back was 
that an infected batch of beer will happily ferment along but it will still 
taste like crap. Never really settling the issue, he gave me a couple packs of 
Muntons dry ale yeast and I was on my way. 
 
Finally, my question- Who's right?  When I got home the starter still didn't 
smell or taste like it should.  Can the yeast go bad during temp. changes 
during shipping or anything like that? 
 
Anyway, if the beer turns out good I'm tempted to go back to using dry yeast. 
Rehydrating a couple packs of yeast while the wort cools is a hell of a lot 
easier than making a starter the night before.  Also, after reading the thread 
on two-stage vs one-stage fermenting, I think I'll just keep this batch in the 
primary until I'm ready to bottle.  That's two steps out of the brewing 
process. Better yet, maybee I'll just go buy some Bud next time. NOT!! 
 
Cheers, 
Paul Brian
