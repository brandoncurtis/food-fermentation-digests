Subject: ATTENTION!


It appears that subscribers to the Homebrew Digest are dropping like 
flies.  I'm not sure why this is, but it appears to be due to network 
problems, such as "User Unknown" and "Host Unknown" and "Could Not 
Connect" problems.  It SEEMS like people are computers are vanishing or 
changing addresses, but I have a hard time believing the numbers I'm 
seeing right now. 
 
If you do happen to be unsubscribed or suddenly stop receiving the

#1: If people call for votes to my personal mailbox, I will not be able 
to respond.  First off, there are around 3600 members of the HBD. 
 
#2: Thanks for letting me know your concerns.  As you would expect, 
some people think that restricting the HBD is a good idea, others think 
its a lousy idea. 
 
#3: Spammers to the HBD due get a note from me and their system 
administrator is informed.  In most of those cases, they lose are 
warned and may lose their accounts. Spamming is not taken lightly 
ANYWHERE on the internet. 
 
#4: Some people use the HBD from different e-mail addresses, their 
addresses change, their mail server changes and other such stuff.  If 
only 1% of HBDers have such things happen to their e-mail addresses, 
they would be unable to use the HBD and I would get more than 1 
complaint a day about those problems.  Realistically addresses change 
more than that. 
 
#5: The HBD will not change right now, but that policy is always open 
for reconsideration if it gets too bad.

Subject: Re: Fruit beer too sweet


 
Funny.  I just did a 85% wheat a few weeks ago with OG=1.064.  I added 
fruit juice after steeping berries at 170F for 30 min with Pectin, and 
added 2 quarts of sweet strained berry juice to two secondary 
fermentations.  One with 2 lbs cherries juice, the other with 2.4 lbs 
blueberries juice.  Both carboys were blowing off within 5 minutes, and 
I just kegged the results with FG=1.010 (cherry), FG=1.008 
(blueberry).  Oh yea, I used Wyeast 1056 too. 
 
Better luck next time Bill.

Yep, you're essentially correct Eugene.  This will work, but you have 
to keep in mind that yeast mutates.  I've repitched primary and 
secondary yeast with great success.  I have also fed starters for 
months, and pitched half of the slurry every time.  You can do this for 
some time, but it can turn on you.

Subject: hangovers/Beer for Dummies


Chris Pertschi asks about the cause of hangovers. 
 
I'm not sure if it is generally true that Canadian beer is less likely to 
cause hangovers than American beer.  Nor am I sure WHY this should be the 
case.  His hunch that preservatives are responsible for hangovers seems 
like a good (in that it is testable) hypothesis.  But do American beers 
really have more or different preservatives than Canadian beers? 
 
On the other hand, my understanding is that accumulation of acetaldehyde 
causes many of the symptoms of hangover.  Basically, the two key 
biochemical reactions are: 
 
          1                   2 
ethanol -----> acetaldehyde -----> acetate 
 
 
Reaction 1 is promoted by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and reaction 2 
is promoted by the enzyme aldehyde dehydogenase.  These reactions occur 
primarily in the liver, require NAD, and produce NADH.  Apparently, the 
supply of NAD often limits the overall reaction rate and its shortage can 
lead to accumulation of acetaldehyde.  Interestingly, some ethnic groups 
accumulate significantly more acetaldehyde after drinking than others. 
Acetaldehyde has also been implicated as the cause of Fetal Alcohol 
Syndrome. 
 
My hunch is that American and Canadian beers are about equally likely to 
cause hangovers.  Perhaps because Chris was on vacation and was in such a 
good mood that he simply didn't notice the effects of accumulated 
acetaldehyde.  Mood can definitely influence the perception of 
intoxication by alcohol and other drugs, so why not the perception of 
hangovers?

On another topic, I recently saw the book BEER FOR DUMMIES in my local 
bookstore.  I would be interested in hearing some opinions about this new 
book. It seemed to me to be pretty good, but I only had time for a 5 
minute perusal. 
 
Cheerio!

Subject: Flavored fruit beers recipes, hop conservation and bittering herbs.


 
Dear friends, 
 
I am preparing my first batch of homebrew. I need a fruit flavored beer 
recipe as a start. I would appreciate your sending me what you have. 
 
I have found some hops: brewers gold and cascade. It is not too much but 
enough for several batchs. I need some information on hop conservation. I 
would also appreciate your sending me any suggestion about other 
bittering herbs that I could use to prepare my first batch. 
 
I also have a malt extract for baking bread. It contains 45%-55% maltose, 
20% dextrins, 5-6% proteins and density 80-83 Brix. I could also find a 
pale ale malt. I would appreciate a recipe to use this kind of 
ingredients. 
 
Thanks, 
 
Jorge Blasig

Yes!  (Sorry, I read the HBD very infrequently.)  I posted a formula for 
CO2 vs. temp vs. pressure a few years ago.  (The table actually made it 
into an issue of Zymurgy not too long ago.)  Here it is again, paraphrased: 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hello fellow brewmeisters, 
 
I've come up with a formula and a table for determining what pressure to 
apply to achieve a certain carbonation level.  I believe that this table 
is more useful compared to the other table that has appeared on the HBD 
and elsewhere.  It's smaller (fits easily in an 80 column window), but 
contains all the needed information in a more obvious arrangement.  (It 
makes more sense to me to ask "what pressure do I need" rather than "what 
do I get if I use this pressure").  Besides, it can do any temperature. 
 
You can print the table out and stick it in your brewing logbook or on 
the side of your kegs. 
 
 
FORMULA 
 
If you use a spreadsheet or a programmable calculator for your brewing 
endeavors, this is the formula that was used to create the table: 
 
Pressure = F(Temperature, Volume) 
 
P = -16.6999 - 0.0101059 T + 0.00116512 T^2 
    + 0.173354 T V + 4.24267 V - 0.0684226 V^2 
 
(T units are Farenheit) 
 
 
TABLE 
 
Look at the row that corresponds to your keg temperature, and read the 
number at the column corresponding to the desired carbonation level. 
That number is the pressure to apply to the beer, in PSI.

dave then went on to quote a piece of noonan's book, which mentions that 
flour is undesirable, because it balls easily.  i think when al wrote that the 
ideal (impossible) crush was big husks and finely ground starch, he was 
assuming there would be no problems in mixing the mash.  this makes sense, as 
the flour would be very quickly converted, and the husks would not be so 
finely ground as to cause lautering/sparging problems.  of course, this is 
nearly impossible to achieve, thus the compromised crush we all have to deal 
with. 
 
i routinely find starch grits in my lauter tun, after the sparge is over. 
this represents lost extract.  if these pieces of starch had been more finely 
ground, they would have been available to the enzymes to convert, and more 
extract would be the result.  now, i have a question:

excellent question, and i don't know the answer for sure.  i recommended 
extending the saccharification rest because i had seen that recommendation 
in dave miller's books, particularly for high kilned (enzymatic) malts, and 
because my own experience has led me to believe that a longer sacch. rest 
improved extraction.   also,  a member of my homebrew club (stl brews) had 
performed an overnight infusion mash (to save time/experiment), and had 
gotten outstanding extraction compared with his normal brewing method.  all 
other variables were the same (lautering, etc.) as his usual method.  we all 
tasted the beer, and it was fine. 
 
now, here's my question:  is it possible that the reason a longer mash rest 
gives better extraction is because the longer rest helps to break down large 
starch grits (like i find in my lauter tun) better?  obviously, enzyme 
viability and denaturization is an issue here (not again!), but assuming 
there are enzymes left after an hour and a half, are they still trying to 
munch on those big starch granules and convert as much as they can when we 
intervene and mash out?  all the super finely ground starch (flour) gets 
converted very quickly, but these larger pieces are troublesome for enzymes, 
and they need more time to convert them because they don't have immediate 
access like they do with the finer ground starch.  correct? 
 
this is the physical reason for decoction mashing.  to break up those bigger 
pieces of starch by boiling them and physically breaking them down into 
much smaller pieces.  this makes easier work for the enzymes. 
 
now, why do i get a negative reaction for starch from the iodine test even 
though i'm finding starch in my lauter tun?  because as soon as a little 
piece of starch breaks off the big starch grit, it gets converted.  actually, 
the enzymes are gathered round the starch grit like sharks around a whale, 
tearing off pieces and converting them simultaneously.  so i have basically 
starch grits in a sugar solution, and there's no starch in the liquid i use 
for the iodine test. 
 
this is all conjecture, but i'm interested in feedback.

Another question. 
 
I have acquired a used 20lb co2 tank with dual gauges for the paltry

I usually only read about stuff like this, so please allow me the indulgence

Last weekend, my wife and I were in a small town--she was shopping for 
antiques, and I was grumbling about being in a town with nothing to do 
except watch my wife shop (is it any wonder that statistically, men die 
younger than women?).  Anyhoo, wandering down an aisle, I glanced 
at a shelf and saw a bottle of Thomas Hardy's Ale, one of the small, 
6  ouncers, obviously old with a fading, brown label.  Looking closer, 
I saw that it was FULL!  Looking even closer, the date on it was July, 
1968.  If memory serves, this was the first year the brew was made. 
Price:  five bucks!  Acting nonchlalant at the register (trying to hide my 
excitement) I plopped my five bucks down.  At that point, the lady sez: 
"ya know, there is another one".  After picking my tongue and jaw off 
the floor, I bought both of them, five bucks each. 
 
Now for the big question: 
 
A)  are they worth anything, and if so, how much (ballpark)--in which 
      case I will sleep with them under my pillow for life, 
 
or 
 
B)  seeing as though all the sources I read suggest that the ale's flavor

OK, so let's put a valve on the outlet of the tun.  We can control the flow to 
be whatever we want, even to the point of maiking the lauter last longer than 
it would have been in a non-channeling bed.  My contention is, the extraction 
will still be poor. Since a greater proportion of water is passing through the 
channels, a lesser proportion passes through the rest of the bed, thus 
resulting in worse extraction, despite the extended contact time. 
 
If channeling is not directly observable as a decrease in extraction, then it 
is hardly a problem.  In fact, the shortened lauter time would be a bonus.

I am getting ready to bottle a rather sweet blueberry mead (melomel for you

I tried this with a sample bottle and it came out almost like a sweet wine. 
I wanted to bottle another 2gal WITH sugar to carbonate.  Any suggestions

dropped slightly.  The other 1gal I wanted to add nutrient to and let it 
ferment out a bit more before I bottle it.  Here again, how much do I use? 
 
Please answer privately, and try to keep the technical jargon to a minimum. 
I must have been a chef in a past life, because I don't worry too much about 
exact measurements. (Except when a bottle may explode as a result.)  All this

Chris Pertschi asks "What is it in U.S. mass produced 'brews' that often 
destroys the following morning...? 
 
I certainly have no scientific proof but my own empirical observations have 
led me to believe that it is what isn't in mass produced beer, namely 
yeast, that leads to the problems. I have found that homebrew and German 
beers definitely are less damaging than centrifuged and/or filtered mega 
brews. I had an evening with commercial Hefe Weizen (Paulaner) in Germany a 
couple of weeks ago that left me amazed at how well I felt the next AM 
considering the quantity consumed and the jet lag factor. I have also noted 
over there that an evening with the Pils leads to a much worse morining 
than an evening with Hefe Weizen and Eric Warner alludes to this in his 
monograph on wheat beer. Conversely, my own Pils, which is not filtered or 
centrifuged is more forgiving than German commercial Pils, even "vom Fass". 
I suppose I should contrast Hefe Weizen with Crystal - further rearch - all 
in the interests of science of course. 
 
One often sees the explanation that yeast contain vitamin B and that 
vitamin B helps the body to metabolize alcohol. This may indeed be the case 
but I have nothing at hand to support this notion except the observation 
that several of the B vitamins are intimately involved in the metabolism of 
sugars and that it is the upset of this metabolism by excess NADH that 
leads to many of the problems of hangover.

Robert Ray spoke of a bee diving into his brew pot and John Varady of 
several going to their deaths in his hot mash. 
A while back I was aerating my cooled wort by pouring back and forth 
between buckets and had a problem with flies trying to land on the buckets. 
I thought I kept the flies shooed away but saw a small one in the wort in one 
of my buckets.  I didn't have a sanitized spoon handy so I grabbed a spoon 
from my brewing equipment box and scooped the fly out.  I figured whatever 
might be on that spoon couldn't be any worse than what was on the fly. 
Especially since I brew in my shop building which has numerous fresh cow 
patties outside.  I went ahead and pitched the yeast and hoped for the best. 
The beer turned out fine, although I didn't mention the incident to anyone 
who drank it. 
I have also picked the occasional wasp or beetle out of my mash.  I don't 
know how they got there but they never left any noticeable flavors behind. 
I don't remember any of my beers having a detectable sting. 
I guess the beer gods have been kind to me.

Subject: Re: Channelling vs. Sparge Flow Rate


Guy Gregory writes: 
>Flow (volume per unit time) will always reflect channelling. 
 
Let me see if I can summarize the agreement here. 
 
1) Sparge water will flow faster naturally if there is channelling than 
if there isn't. 
2) Sparge water going through a channel extracts less from the total 
grain bed. 
 
3) The effects of channelling can be ameliorated somewhat by slowing down 
the flow rate (would increase osmosis). 
 
I think Guy is forgetting that most people's homebrew setups can adjust 
the flow rate, such as by closing the spigot more, or changing the 
distance between the two end-points of a siphon. 
 
In this case, if you simply sparge longer by closing the outlet, it 
should help extraction, but it isn't clear that it would be enough or 
even significant. 
 
The previous example of a straw or tube holding the water going through 
the grain bed shows this issue.  Even if you take three days to let the 
water go through the tube, it won't extract any more than if you let it 
take three minutes. 
 
So, I think we all agree that the best approach to channelling is to 
eliminate the channels somehow.  And we all agree that taking longer to 
sparge will help.  It may help a lot with some geometries and flow rates 
(like if you sparge 6 gallons in 10 minutes, slowing down to an hour will 
clearly make a big difference), or it may help just a little (like going 
from one hour to 90 minutes and still having sweet malt at the edges of 
the lauter tun). 
 
If I missed some important points, please point them out. 
 
Thanks.
