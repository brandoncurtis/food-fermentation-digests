Subject: Channelling, finis


 
 In HBD 2180, John DeCarlo, jdecarlo`at`juno.com, Arlington, VA  points out 
terms of agreement in the recent thread on channelling  I and Kelly Jones 
<kejones`at`ptdcs2.intel.com> are in, and then states: 
 
 
"I think Guy is forgetting that most people's homebrew setups can adjust 
the flow rate, such as by closing the spigot more, or changing the 
distance between the two end-points of a siphon." 
 
Well, no, I originally tried to add something to AlK's on-again/off again 
thread and proposed experiment. Al proposed: 
 
Al K>Half way through the laeuter, divert the runnings to a quart jar. 
 After 
Al K>you've got it half full, divert to a second quart jar and immediately 
Al K>stir the top half of the mash.  Measure the SG of the runnings.  If the 
 
Al K>OG in jar 2 is significantly higher than that in jar 1, you have 
 Al K>channelling problems.  I'm going to try this on my next batch. 
 
I guess I assumed Jar 1 and Jar 2 would be drawn at equal valve settings, 
and sparge water head is held constant,  so potential discharge would be the 
same.  Actual discharge (in volume per unit time) would be a function of the 
grain to yield wort. My assumptions, my problem.  My other assumption is 
that there are a gazillion chemical factors affecting extraction which can 
generate different specific gravities, while physically in terms of rate 
there is just valves, head, and grain.  Thus, specific gravity results may 
not directly indicate channelized flow. 
 
<fling gauntlet mode on> 
Maybe there is a chemical "channelling" phenomenon, where some grains yield 
goodies better than others for .....whew!  New thread!  Get out the angels 
and the hatpins! 
 <gauntlet mode off> 
 
John concludes, quite reasonably: 
"In this case, if you simply sparge longer by closing the outlet, it 
should help extraction, but it isn't clear that it would be enough or 
even significant. " 
 
Agree, though if channelling is real it will still preferentially conduct 
flow at low flow rates.  Extraction may  not suffer, though,  given enough 
time to extract. Hope that clarifies where I was. 
 
Hey Al, how's the experiment going? and Charlie, have you been able to sort 
all this stuff out for the FAQ yet?

Subject: Lagering Under Pressure


Hello, Beer People - 
 
Humbly asking for help here.  I've got a Munich helles half way through 
primary, and an idea arises ..... 
 
Somewhere in the last year I've read something about conditioning lagers 
under pressure.  The idea appeals to me - one less step, right?  The idea 
would be to do a traditional primary ferment, then rack directly in the keg 
for secondary/lagering.  The remaining fermentation would shortly pressurize 
the keg "somewhat", then after an appropriate period of lagering, put the gas 
to it and enjoy. 
 
Is this a common practice, or did I just dream it up - I can't seem to find 
where I read/heard about it.  So the question is, what are the pros and cons 
of this approach? 
What effect does pressure have on the residual yeast, diacetyl reduction, 
etc.? 
Any practical tips? 
 
Private e-mail is fine, and I'll summarize back to HBD. 
 
Thanks!

Subject: Moods and perceptions of intoxication


Dear Friends, 
 
In #2181, Peter Ensminger said: 
 
"Perhaps because Chris was on vacation and was in such a good mood 
that he simply didn't notice the effects of accumulated acetaldehyde. 
 Mood can definitely influence the perception of intoxication by 
alcohol and other drugs, so why not the perception of hangovers?" 
 
This struck a chord with me.  I distinctly recall that, during the 
two years that I lived in England, and was a rather *ahem* regular 
visitor to local pubs with my department colleagues, I could have a 
couple of pints of Best (clocking in at probably less than 4% ABV) 
with the lads and actually feel a little loaded when I left the pub 
afterwards.  Whereas, if I were to drink the equivalent amount 
(either homebrew or store-bought), or even more, quietly at home, I 
could barely even notice that there was any alcohol in my system at 
all. 
 
I'd be interested to hear others' comments on this effect.  Does the 
camaraderie and more jovial atmosphere of being out with friends make 
you feel the alcohol more than quietly sitting and reading the paper 
or whatever?  Let's have it here in the digest and see if it goes 
anywhere rather than private... take our mind off of SPAM.  Bloody 
Vikings. 
 
Cheers, Dave in Sydney

Another major drawback is that it requires *careful* babysitting. 
Before I had my RIMS temp controller finished, the rest of the system 
was finished and I was anxious to try it out.  Close to the setpoint, 
I thought the switch was on and went to turn it off, and it was 
already off, so I ended up turning it ON!!  B-{  The mass of the mash 
means that the effects take a while to be seen on the thermometer and 
once seen, it is too late to stop them quickly.  If I were close to a 
158F mash temp, I would have overshot it and possibly killed the 
enzymes.  However, I was shooting for a low 150F mash, so I did no 
*damage*, but mashed at the wrong temperature. 
 
The temp controller has the advantage of slowing down the heat as the 
setpoint is approached so oscillation and overshoot are avoided. 
 
As far as heat loss goes, there is not a great deal of heat loss 
during recirculation.  At 123F, I turn off the heater element for my 
20 minute protein rest and it stays within 1 F of where it was.

This information is second-hand, so feel free to flame me if it's wrong 
and I'll be glad to pass it along. To the best of my knowledge, if you've ever 
had Guiness on draft, it has been nitrogen-injected.  It seems that the nozzle 
on the tap has several very small pinholes to create the very small bubbles. 
A pressure of 30lbs is required to push the beer through these pinholes.  I 
don't know beans (or barley) about CO2 absorbtion, but I was told that if 
CO2 is used at this pressure, (and it happens sometimes by accident), the 
Guiness absorbs the CO2 and it's unpourable by the next day.  Nitrogen is 
used because it dissolves much more slowly, if at all.

Can RIMS newbies comment too?  If so, I'd like to say that this 
method sounds like more than just a minor baby-sitting job to me, 
and might completely eliminate some of the advantages of a RIMS in 
the process.  One of the main advantages of a RIMS is the ability to 
maintain a set temperature during your mash with little or no drift. 
To be constantly turning on your hear full blast and then turning 
it off manually could easily cause wild temperature fluctuations for 
even the most patient and attentive masher.

This is exactly what I have done, but I do plan on upgrading some day 
to a fully automated system. I leave the dial turned on about 
half-way to maintain the temp, and then turn it all the way on for 
temp boosts.  The dimmer switch cost me about $50 and is rated at 
1500W.

I would argue that the former would require a lot practice, if not 
skill, and would still be very difficult.  The latter method only 
takes a few practice runs to figure out where your dial needs to be 
in your system to maintain temperatures.

Actually, it is called BrewCraft, Ltd.  Kerry Hauptli, the owner, is 
a very friendly guy and enjoys talking about his RIMS equipment, so 
email him if you have any questions.  His address is 
76004.1610`at`compuserve.com. I also have some photos of his equipment 
on my RIMS web page (URL is below).  I have no financial interest in 
BrewCraft and I'm not even a satisfied customer, although I may be 
someday when I upgrade my system. ~ Enjoy!

my suspicion is that finely ground husks can contribute things to your wort 
that don't make it into the wort when the husks are not finely ground. 
greg noonan's lager beer book talks about the composition of grain husks and 
why the stuff in them is not desirable in wort, if i recall correctly. 
 
what was the answer to my dark mash pH strip discoloration problem?  nobody 
ever emailed me, and i didn't see a response out here.  am i doomed to the 
purchase of a meter?  homebrewers, what sayeth ye? 
 
recipe note for those of you looking to duplicate munich dark malt flavors 
(oktoberfest, dunkel):  i recently took a munich dunkel in to be tasted at 
the beer club meeting, and the biggest complaint i heard was that it didn't 
have a typical munich toasty malt flavor.  it was surmised by one taster that 
it was more like a scotch ale than a munich beer, from a malt flavor 
standpoint.  here's the grist bill for that beer, which was decoction mashed: 
 
1.2 lb dwc pils malt 
7 lb munich malt 
0.5 lb dwc aromatic 
11 oz. dwc caravienne 
3 oz. dwc caramunich 
4 oz. dwc chocolate 
 
let me make a recommendation if any of you are looking to brew a dunkel 
(i'm taking this advice myself this year):  use as little 
chocolate and crystal malts as you're comfortable with if you want to try 
and get the munich dark beer malt profile correct.  i have a strong feeling 
that the chocolate needs to be eliminated from the recipe, and perhaps even 
the crystal cut back a bit. 
 
my main problem is i can't find a munich dunkel in the beer stores i go to so 
i can compare. does anybody see dunkels in the beer stores?  which beers?

Zymurgists- 
got a quick question for the honorable collective. I installed a JSP 
easymasher (I know, I know) in my Vollrath 10 gal kettle a couple of months 
ago, and thus far I am very happy with its extraction efficiency. However, 
that rackin' frackin' spigot gets me swearing at my mother every time I try 
to attach a piece of hose to it. The seal is such that I have to clamp it 
about 10 times to prevent it from sucking air into the sweet wort during the 
lauter. My question is this: does anyone know where I can find a replacement 
spigot with the same diameter threaded male NPT fitting, something that 
wouldn't be such a GD MFing PITA- names, telephone numbers and prices would 
be most appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help. Responses by private

I would like to brew a wheat beer, and am not sure which yeast to use: there 
are more and more available all the time. I've never brewed weizens before, 
although I really like the style. What are people's impressions after using 
Wyeast 3068 Weihenstephan, 3056 Bavarian wheat, one of the newer ones? Which 
one do you reccomend? 
 
Also, trying to be true to style, should I really late hop or just use 
kettle hops? When I have tried german wheat beers I have never noriced the 
presence of aroma hops. I would probably use Hallertauer or Herrsbrucker for 
kettle hopping. 
 
Any thoughts? Private email appreciated.

     I decided to transition to all-grain brewing simply because I strive 
     for challenges, and I got to the point where extract had lost its 
     glamour.  I did take the no brainer approach -- no worrying about 
     water chemistry (doesn't it take a long time to count parts per 
     million) nor pH and frequently did not even take hydrometer readings. 
 
     I would simply mash-in to get get a protein rest, heat it up to mash 
     temp, assume that the beer gods would smile upon my conversion (iodine 
     is bad for you), heat up to a mash-out then lauter.  Things had worked 
     really well until my last brew.  Here's what happened: 
 
     The grain bill was 10lbs of Klages, with a lb of crystal.  Our water 
     here in the South Bay is super hard, so I have an RO system.  I use RO 
     water for the mash.  The pH of the water is pretty high (7-8 I am 
     told). 
 
     Upon hearing comments on the HBD that a protein rest was only 
     necessary for lagers, I decided to shorten my brew and just do a mash 
     then mash-out.  I typically mash for an hour, but this day I had to go 
     to Home Depot to get curtain rods, so the mash went on for about 2.5 
     hours.  I then did a mashout and brewed as normal.  When I racked to 
     the primary, it looked really cloudy, and has stayed that way all the 
     way to bottling. I assume that this is the dreaded starch haze. 
 
     My question is:  What happened, and what do I do to make sure it 
     doesn't happen again? 
 
     BTW, the beer tastes fine, you just have to shut you eyes when you 
     drink it.

when you put the wort you want to carmelize on the stove, use a heavy cast 
aluminum pot. do not use a thin pot. you will need to raise the temperature 
of the wort to 230F for syrup, or up to 260F for hard ball carmel. use a 
candy thermometer. in order to get to that temperature you will need to boil 
away all, so collect at least a cup or two. stir a lot as the water level 
goes down. you might want to practice with table sugar first.

Brewsters: 
 
David Whitman ( I know a David Weidman and David Widman , what a nice name 
David
is) writes that he has done an experimental design in which he compared the 
chill haze reducing properites of Irish Moss (IM) and Polyclar and Polyclar is 
estimated to require 1/4 cup just like Dave Miller said. Thanks for the info. 
 
Would you please publish more on this here, like dosages for IM, etc, types of 
beer, etc. %AA 
 
Did you compare Irish moss and bentonite?  Both of these reduce the protein as 
contrasted with the polyclar which removes the tannins which react with the 
proteins to form chill haze. 
 
Did you compare mouthfeel for IM treated beers vs Polyclar treated beers? Loss 
of hop flavor/bitterness with Polyclar? 
 
I encourage more discussion/experimentation on this topic of chill haze and 
clarification, since we all face the problem if we like chilled beer and need 
to
see the possibilities and how others handle it. Although we have had some 
opinions expressed on the use of various filters with various bottom end 
numbers, like 0.2 micron. 5 microns, etc.  Does anyone have some personal 
experience in this area? Who supplies the filters, etc. 
- ------------------------------------------------------------ 
David Cummings ( another nice first name - does this mean there is a higher 
percentage of Daves who make and drink beer than average?) asks about secondary
fermentation.  I always assumed this apparent misnomer was a result of the 
experience in the wine industry ( and I guess in Lambic) in which there are 
sequential fermentations by different organisms.  In the wine industry 
malo-lactic fermentation (the "secondary fermentation") sometimes takes place 
in
the spring of the year and the wine is said  by the French to be waking up. 
This rarely occurs in the modern wine industry with judicious use of sulfite 
and
perhaps innoculation with bacteria, the sometimes desirable M-L fermentation 
takes place during normal yeast fermentation and would be unnoticed from the 
gas
evolution. 
 
Sometimes in beermaking, fermentation is carried out under pressure, sometimes 
after krausening, in the secondary in preparation for bottling. It may also be 
that the highly attenuative lager yeasties are going after the higher sugars 
and
dextrins which are unfermentable in the presence of maltose.. 
 
Since we only want the yeast to ferment and nothing else, we don't 
intentionally
have a secondary ferment, just a continuation of the depositing of the trub and
inactive yeast as the fermentation finishes.  I rack to the secondary after a 
week, normally, to get the beer off the majority of the trub and to give me a 
relatively pure yeast deposit in the secondary with which to krausen and hold 
over for the next ferment as a chilled slurry in a capped bottle. 
- ---------------------------------------------------- 
Dave Greenlee (WHAT is going on? Is this a Daves only day? ?) asks about the 
efficiency of extraction from adjuncts without mashing. What is the efficiency 
of this  "dip and squeeze method"  There are lots of well it depends on...but 
the short answer is that it really depends on the grind of the milled malt and 
whether or not it has been saccharified at the maltster or high roasted. If the
answer to the second one is "no" I say forget it. Don't bother, it won't make 
any difference.You won't get any noticeable flavor from the adjunct unless it 
is
soluble in the wort.  If you are interested in this procedure and in using 
non-crystal or non-high roasted malts, choose a diastatic malt, grind the 
adjunct small and dip and squeeze away. Then it depends on your hands.

Brewsters: 
 
Dusing asks how to save his low extract brown ale.  Bring the beer and 
appropriate amount of malt extract to180F to sterilize it , holding at 180F for
10 min covered, don't boil it,  cool and re-ferment and re-bottle.  No hops 
added. 
- -------------------------------------------------------------- 
John Rusd1 Varady relates his stories of how adjuncts set up on him and set him
up for a set mash and poor sparge.  Next time you want to brew lawnmower beer 
for your friends or use adjuncts for any reason like an oatmeal stout, cook 
them
separately first with a couple of pounds of crushed pale malt, just like a 
decoction mash. In a thick mash of ground adjuncts and crushed pale malt, bring
it to 110, 135, 150F, hold at each for 30 min, heat up to a boil, generally the
longer you hold at the boil, the darker and  maltier your beer will be.  Add 
water if needed during this mashing/cooking procedure. This is then used as the
first stage in your mash program to raise the temperature of your main mash. Or
cool it down and add it into the mash and then begin your program. 
Alternatively
you can have your main mash underway if you are using low T holds. Add this 
"goods" mash to the main mash before you bring it up to the saccharification 
temperature so that any starch solubilized during the boil of the goods mash 
can
be saccharified. This will substantially reduce stuck mash and stuck sparge 
problems caused by gelatinous and gummy adjuncts and add a little yumminess to 
your beer.

still don't drink Carlings, since there are so many good Canadian beers -Give

Jorge Blasig has found some malt extract brix 80-83 ( which means 80 grams of 
sugar per 100 grams of solution at 68 degrees F ).  It is approximately true 
that you can convert from Brix (also called Degrees Plato or Balling) by using 
the following formula: 
 
sp gr = 260/(260-Brix) = 260/(260-83)  = 1.47 
 
You would like to have your beer at about 1.050 its OG to start with, if you 
like a stronger beer  increase both the extract ( say to 1.060) and hops 
accordingly.  Use a lager yeast. 
 
 
Try this: 
In a minimum 15l kettle 
Boil 7.5 liters of water with 3 kgs of hop extract. watch out for boilover!!!! 
Add a little cold water to calm it down. 
add 50 grams of Brewers gold   a Bittering hop 
boil 40 minutes 
add 25 grams of cascades          an aroma hop 
boil 15 minutes 
add 10 grams of cascades           a finishing hop 
boil five minutes 
 
Cover tightly and cool as quickly as possble by sitting the kettle in a basin 
of
cold/ice water until well below body temperature, as judged by feelng the 
outside of the kettle. Pour through a sterilized straineror cloth into a 
sterilized  25 to 30 l primary  fermentation bucket or 25l ( at least) carboy 
with 8 liters of cold boiled water already there. Dilute to 20 liters with cool
boiled water. Add your beer yeast if the wort is below 70.F Cover with a 
plastic
sheet or use an air lock or a blowoff tube. Keep it as cool as possible, 
hopefully below 65F, but don't worry too much about this, just the cooler the 
better. Ferment for a week in the primary or until major ferment is finished. 
Rack to a carboy and allow to sit another week under airlock. Collect the yeast
slurry into a sterilized bottle, cap and place in the refrigerator for the next
batch. Bottle with a total of about 150 grams of sugar added in a bottling 
bucket or added separately in each bottle as a solution. 
 
If you can get a hydrometer, get one and measure the SG at the start and 
finish.
Sample the beer with a sterilized baster or spoon.  Warm the sample to get rid 
of the bubbles of CO2, cool to room temp and measure. 
 
You can save hops by buying a hopped malt extract which already has the 
bittering hops added.  Do not be tempted to add sugar to this to save malt 
extract it is not worth it. 
 
Hold off on the fruit for now. But when you are ready use about 2-3 kgs per 20 
liters. 
 
If you like British beer be sure to try the Pale Ale and use a british ale 
yeast
in your warm climate 
Do your best to use a beer yeast suited to the style it makes a lot of 
difference.

What's to worry about a bee or two in your beer?  Check out this 
story, lifted from a 1994 posting by Kit Anderson, who, in turn, took 
it from the Brew Free or Die! newsletter. 
 
 
Genius comes into play when the you realize an accident is actually a 
major discovery. Such as with Maine Ale and Lager Tasters president 
Brews Stevens' lambic. Brews brewed up a 15 gallon batch of cloudy 
wheat beer and put it into three five gallon buckets in the basement 
of his vintage home. The joists are carefully hung with spider webs 
duplicating Leifman's brewery in Belgium. He left the covers off and 
allowed chance to do the wild thing with his brew. After three weeks, 
he discarded one bucket with brown scum on it while the other two held 
a healthy looking white fuzz. 
 
A bunch of us were sipping the result (an outstanding cassis lambic) 
as Brews related this tale. At bottling time, Brews noticed an area of 
gray fuzz in the head of one of the buckets. So, he scooped out what 
he thought was a minor area of mold. It turned out to be a field 
mouse. Brews said, "He had a smile on his face, though!" We all 
laughed and said it was too bad that the batch was ruined. "Ruined!", 
exclaimed Brews. "I put ten pounds of black currants to it!" 
 
After a moment of silence...we looked down at our glasses.... looked 
at Brews...Naw....Yeah!! Someone, I don't remember who, passed 
'Mouseketeer Cassis Lambic' through his nose. I hadn't seen that trick 
since Ronnie Farr shot milk out his nose after watching Mundo Gorgis 
eat his own ear wax in second grade. 
 
We all watched and took another sip. Hmm. None of that typical rodent 
after taste.  More silence. "You know what living organisms do when 
they die?", asked Dr. Tom, our club physician. "They void their bowels 
and bladder." We looked at our glasses....looked at Dr. Tom...looked 
at Brews...took another sip. Hmm. None of that typical rodent-after 
after taste.

I agree in principle. 
However, the relevant time scale for this event would be days, not 
hours. (at least for 'channels' separated by a few cm or more--anyone know 
what the distance between 'channels' is?). Sparging times on the order of 
1-5 hours allows diffusion over size scales more like 1mm, closer to a 
single grain particle than different zones of the lauter tun. Slow 
lautering is no substitute for getting the flow right. 
 
My 'Channeling' Experience... 
The last time I made a stout I left the dark grains out of the mash 
entirely and added them to the top few cm of my lauter tun just before 
voorlauf. After several minutes of recirculation, the color of the 
runnings gradually started to darken, and the color of the runoff liquid 
(as viewed through the vinyl tubing at the lauter tun's exit) was 
uniform. 
 
Contrast this with the time I watched a friend make a stout, again 
adding his dark grains to the top few cm of the lauter tun just before 
voorlauf (the 'experiment' wasn't planned--emphasis was on brewing & 
drinking beer that day!). Almost immediately strong color fluctuations 
appeared in the runoff. It took several minutes for the runnings to 
become roughly uniformly dark-colored, at least by casual inspection. 
 
I didn't notice any gross differences in our procedures, and our 
equipment was nearly identical. But it's pretty clear that we saw 
qualitatively different flow through our lauter tuns (at least 
initially). 
 
It seems that relatively small variations in procedure can cause 
significant changes in the way the grain particles pack in the lauter 
tun. Has anyone ever tried to codify this? This type of thing might 
account for some of the differences in our collective lautering 
experience.

You shouldn't have to scrub much at all. Use caustic to 
remove most of the gunk (like lye or one of the proprietary 
blends) and then acid to remove the beer stone (like diluted 
naval jelly or shower power). I use paper towels to wipe up the 
stuff and throw the towels away. Wear eye protection and 
gloves. 
 
Rinse after your final wash very well.
