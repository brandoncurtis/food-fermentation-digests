Subject: Force Carbonating / Siphon starting


     Hi! 
 
     In the last digest there is a nice discussion on how to force 
     carbonate a keg of beer by shaking it while applying CO2 pressure. 
     All the instructions in the post were good, but I would add one 
     precautionary measure:  keep the CO2 tank above the level of the CO2 
     inlet on the keg. 
 
     This is to keep beer out of your gas line and regulator.  Once the 
     beer is carbonated there will be no pressure difference between the 
     keg and the line, and beer can flow freely into it.  Quite messy. 
     ---------------------- 
     While on the subject of gas, I'd like to share my siphon starting 
     technique.  Many of you probably already know it, but for those who 
     don't: 
 
     If you have a CO2 canister it is easy to start a siphon.  Simply 
     obtain one of those orange carboy caps, the kind with two openings. 
     Put the cap on the carboy.  Put the racking cane through one hole. 
     Set your CO2 regulator for ~10 psi, turn on the gas and hold the gas 
     line against the other hole in the carboy cap.  Sometimes you have to 
     press down on the cap a bit to obtain a good seal, but the beer will 
     start to flow quickly and cleanly.  You can, of course, let go of the 
     gas line and turn off the CO2 once the liquid is flowing. 
 
     No need to suck on hoses, blow into your carboy, fill the hose with 
     pre-boiled water, etc.  I even use this technique for obtaining 
     samples from my fermenters.  It doesn't matter if the carboy cap 
     doesn't fit the fermenter perfectly; just press down on it and raise 
     the gas pressure a bit to get the beer flowing. 
 
     Have Fun!

Good morning all, 
 
John M. Posing's mash schedule appear to provide a mash that will be far 
to thin to provide the proper characteristics for a Czech Pils. 
 
A quart of cold to mash in with then raising the temperature to 95F with 
150F water with give you a mash with 1.5 to 2 quart of water per pound of 
grain and that is too mush considering he has another addition of hot 
water with the first decoction.

Subject: copper tubing


Just a quick question, all the information I have gathered suggests using 
copper for boil kettle racking canes, wort chillers, fittings, etc. 
However, in between beer batches, my copper wort chiller sits on the 
shelving unit and oxidizes.  Then, I put in the boil kettle for 15 mins to 
sanitize and when I pull it out at the end, the chiller is bright, i.e. no 
oxidization.  Does this not contribute to off flavors in the beer????? 
Anyone else noticed this???? I ask because my last two batches of beer 
(since inception of my wort chiller) have tasted awfull.  Anyone care to 
comment?  TIA.

 I'm wondering if it is better to force carbonate in the keg, or prime 
the keg and let it naturally carbonate? 
 I'm sure there's advantages and disadvantages to both, but I'm looking

Subject: My Balls are Always Bouncing


I was looking through an old zymurgy ('90) and saw an ad for 
a product called the "Batch Latch" that allow one to re-use 
5 gallon party balls. I called the number but no luck. Can 
anyone tell me if this type of product is available today? 
 
Is there any advantage to adding a lager yeast to my ale 
before cold conditioning it at 32F? Will it reduce any off 
flavors produced from high fermentation temps? The ale will 
be at 32F for about a month for the day I take the plunge. 
 
I recently brewed a porter on a friday that had finished and 
cleared by tuesday morning (1056 at 75F), so tuesday evening 
I kegged it, co2 injected it, and tossed it in a freezer at 
32f till the following saturday. That 8 day old ale was pretty 
tasty and gone fast.

I agree conceptually with the idea of limiting posts to subscribers, 
and  in fact contribute to other lists with that limit. 
 
However, this is not necessarily straightforward.  Lots of people get a 
generic address (jdecarlo`at`erols.com or jdecarlo`at`aob.org or somesuch) 
that they like to use when subscribing to lists.  However, they may have 
a *real* address that is subject to change (jdecarlo`at`mail5.erols.com or 
somesuch) that their mailer uses.  Those people have to learn special 
tricks to post messages or they have to subscribe and unsubscribe many 
times as the "real" address changes (one month it is `at`mail4.x.com and 
the next `at`pop3.x.com).  I know on one list I got the listmanager to 
subscribe both my "real" and my "generic" (with the "real" one set to 
not receive mail). 
 
Anyway, this is long and sort-of off-topic, but it just points out that 
there are quite a few people whose preferred reply-to email address is 
different from the one their email program puts on as From.

Quite true. The tylenol I bought this morning carries a specific warning

Subject: High temp fermentation nasties. Responses


Thanks to all who responded to my questions regarding bad alcoholic 
off-flavors that I surmised resulted from fermenting 1056 at >=74F. I was 
surprised by the number of people who said they had had exact same problem 
(but then, I doubt there are too many unique brewing problems). Most 
everybody agreed that high temp was the culprit, rather than infection, but 
opinion was mixed 50-50 on whether the beer would get better with time. I 
guess I'll just have to wait and find out. One private e-mail response said 
that 1056 "has a very nasty flavor while the yeast is still in suspension. 
Give the beer at least three weeks in the bottle 
before sampling." I have never heard this before. In fact, I've always 
thought it was supposed to be fairly neutral. But as I said in my original 
post, I rarely use it, preferring 1098 as my general pale ale yeast. Comments?

Jim: 
 
I have many bottles of old yeast dregs, some at least a year old in 
my refrig.  I make a starter and once it has started bubbling, I take a 
drop of slurry and inspect it under a microscope.  You can tell if 
the yeast look healthy (ovoid and budding) or mutated (long and skinny). 
 
Bacteria, which are smaller should be absent.  If you see little rods 
~1/10 the size of yeast or strings of what look like beaded chains (cocci) 
you have a bacterial infection.  Toss the starter. 
 
BTW I use a sterile gauze pad and rubberband over the top of my starter 
(1/2 gal jug with approx 12-16oz aerated liquid) 
instead of an airlock because I want to make more yeast (aerobically) 
and not beer (anaerobically), at this point.  I check for activity by 
swirling the contents, if it foams up nicely, they're off and running. 
 
Good Luck

Is it possible you're actually seeing some sort of *protein* haze? I've seen 
conflicting opinions on whether a protein rest is necessary with Klages malt 
or not. I don't think the protein rest is a lager vs. ale thing -- I think it 
depends on whether you're using lager or ale *malt*. Comments, anyone?

Subject: RE: Lagering under pressure / alcohol effects


     Hello! 
 
     Tom asks about using a sealed keg as a secondary for lagering.  It 
     does work fine, but you shouldn't put the beer in while it's still 
     fermenting. 
 
     The reason is that many lager yeasts, especially the German strains, 
     produce nasty smelling sulfurous gasses (like H2S) that need to be 
     allowed to leave the beer.  During the long, slow fermentation in a 
     carboy these gasses have a chance to be purged by the CO2, leaving the 
     beer clean smelling.  In my experience, this can take 2 or 3 weeks at 
     45F. 
 
     Only after the beer smells clean do I keg it for lagering.  I force 
     carbonate as soon as it is kegged.  In this way you don't have to 
     disturb the beer as much after the lagering period.  I don't want to 
     stir up all the haze and yeast that have crashed to the bottom of the 
     keg after waiting so patiently! 
 
     You could force carbonate by just hooking the tank up to the keg 
     without agitation, but I prefer the speed of force carbonating with 
     agitation (I only have one CO2 tank, and many kegs). 
 
     If you keg the beer before the H2S has been purged, it may be possible 
     to purge it by venting the keg periodically, then repressurizing with 
     CO2 (note: that's CO2, not Co2, which would be diatomic cobalt; don't 
     want to give David B. a headache!).  That seems like a pain, though. 
     --------------------- 
     On that alcohol thread, I too have noticed that beer in a "party" 
     atmosphere seems to affect me more than one quietly enjoyed at home. 
     Sometimes I attribute this to a lack of food in my stomach, but that's 
     not always the case.  I guess your state of mind does influence your 
     body tremendously, hence the practice of testing new drugs against 
     placebos. 
 
     Have Fun!

Stephen Harrington writes about cloudy beer: 
 
Did you recycle the first runnings until the wort ran clear?  This 
process helps to establish the grain bed filter.  Different 
lauter tuns and grain grinds mean that the amount of recycling required to 
achieve clarity is difficult to predict, but up to a couple of gallons may 
need to be recycled.  This recycling can increase color, flavor and sugar 
extraction too, so it's a Good Thing.  But simple recycling can lead to 
undesirable cooling of the mash. To overcome this, you could reheat each 
pint or so of the runnings for ~30 secs on the stove before adding it 
back to the mash, if you can be bothered. 
 
This external heating can be used to achieve mash out temps too.  Then 
it's only a hop step and jump to RIMS type mashing... 
 
BTW, it sounds like a little gypsum or Burton salts in your RO water might 
help the mash proceed, or maybe just use 1 gallon or so of your hard local 
water blended with the RO variety.

Subject: Help, 10Gal Gott too small


 
My current setup is a half barrel for boiling(no screen or spigot) and a 
10Gallon Gott with a plastic screen. 
I've brewed 5 and light 10 gallon batches (up to 16.5 lbs of grain) and 
until now standard procedures worked fine.  I decided to brew a 10 gallon 
batch of Marzen/Octoberfest and the total mashable grain is 22lbs with an 
additional 2lbs of crystal.  With a quart of water at 133F for a 122F 
protein rest then about another quart per lb of boiling water for a rest at 
158F,  I've already overshot the Gotts 10 gallon capacity, without counting 
the volume of grain and any additional water for a mashout at 165F.  I'd 
really like to make a 10 gallon batch. 
I know I can remove some grain and liquid heat it to the target temp, but 
have no experience doing so.  How much to pull, assuming I have to add 
additional boiling water to hit the target temp of 158F, what is the desired 
ratio of water to grain at 158F.   I'm assuming I can't heat all my initial 
6gal H2O and 22lb grain to 158F. If I can heat the whole mash to 158 should 
I just do all my heating and rests in the keg and when its done gently 
transfer to the Gott? 
I'll eventually the upgrade the keg with a spigot and screen  but it won't 
be before this weekends brew session. 
I'd appreciate helpful advice, experiences or pointers to info. 
Sorry if this is basic kids stuff, has been gone over before, or just not 
interesting. 
Thanks for all the great info so far, I don't know what I'd do without the 
HBD.

(ccoyote`at`juno.com if you wanna test it out, PC only,  baaaaah! 
I dont check it often lets just say...but go ahead, test it out) 
 
Funny thing is- the free aspect of it is due to the fact that you are 
inundated with ads while using their software.  It takes up 10meg of hard

from the advertisers yet.  but I cant say much has hit my snailmailbox. 
 
So do you really think that advertisers will be drawn to an account to be 
subject to advertisement?  maybe.  sure we'll get more free-loaders, but 
hell, hasn't every college campus in america done that to us already (hey- 
you freshman in the back row, stop cowering, I'm not gonna throw any chalk

Look at how many worthless "home-pages" there are.  (this is my dorm room, 
there's my poster of Cindy Crawford wearing Pepsi<tm> stuff, theres my

when that doesnt work use some of Domenicks tactics and inundate their 
mailbox with all the pictures from alt.nasty.sex.with.animals :)  Now if 
they like it...then ...well... you're screwed,  so to speak. 
 
 
But FWIW I agree fully with the proposal that we limit posts to subscribed 
users. Usenet works that way doesnt it?  It works there doesnt it? :( 
It would allow an element of control such that if contributors get 
disruptive (nomakeeeeee) they can be booted.  Lets just never have a public 
vote about who should stay and who should go...thats total crap! 
 
*** 
Since I hate to post posts that contain NO brewing related merit, here's my 
quick save attempt: 
While tiptoeing on the very top step of my rickety old wooden ladder (you 
know, the step that (b4 all the paint wore off) says- "NOT A STEP") and 
sticking my head out over/through the top of my hop pergola I was picking 
handful after glorious handful of almost too ripe cascade (and I'm not even 
halfway there!) I had a horrible sneezing fit.  Yet there I am, teetering 
on top, and sneezing  and sneezing away, sun beating down, saying, "I gotta 
pick em, gotta pick em...". 
 
Whew- I tell you. It was a BAAAD allergic reaction.   I've run into some 
sniffles before when picking my hops, and have a history of allergies to 
pollen, but this baby knocked me over....well not quite-luckily.  Good 
thing I built that pergola sturdy!  I had to give up the pick-athon, and 
run for an antihistamine and a box of tissues. 
 
Well, next time I'm gonna wear a dust mask.  Its getting to the point where 
I might need to get one of those fancy schmancy space suits like Kirk wore 
in the Tholean Web, or where Spock and co. got that infection that made em 
all crazy- Sulu the swashbuckler,,,,oh yeah.  Brewing again.... 
 
I wear surgical gloves (work well) long sleeves, a cap, glasses,  now a 
dust mask too.  My neighbors are REALLY going to start to wonder! 
 
Well, my question here is- has anyone else had any adverse reactions while 
picking hops?  I think I may have just been overwhelmed by the overpowering 
(and wonderful) fresh hop aroma, ... and dust, and pollen, and aphids... 
But I would seriously hope that I'm not developing some kind of allergy to 
hops that might even (god forbid) translate to an allergy to hops IN beer.

I would recommend you buy and EASYMASHER (tm JSP). This beautiful little gadget
has made my mashing experiences, well, easy. It will never clog and you never 
have to worry about a silly false bottom floating up on you.  You can stir the 
mash as much as you like during the sparge and you only have to recirculate 
a few ounces of runnings in order to reset the grain bed.  Also, if 
you boil in a pot with an EM installed, you don't have to use hop bags because 
after chilling you can just drain the wort out of the pot with the hops acting 
as filter bed (don't use pellets though). This method also has the advantage of
leaving behind the hot and cold break as well. It's the best system in my 
opinion.
I would never use anything else.

Subject: bottling and starters


 
Just thought I would share some of my latest brewing techniques with 
everyone. 
The first would be a batch of wheat beer that I made (partial mash) 
the came out flat after 4 weeks in the bottle. to carbonate it  I 
dissolved about 
1/4 cup suger in a cup of water and opened up each bottle, took out about 
a tsp or more and replaced it with the suger water. after 2 weeks the beer 
was more carbonated than before and I tasted no contamination. 
 
The second is a yeast starter I got from the bottom of Whitbread Pale ale 
bottle. It took about 1 week for fermentation at about 78-80 degs it 
tasted fine and it is fermenting a batch now at about 70 deg. The yeast 
took 
off in about 12 hours after i pitched it. 
 
Now for my question. Has anyone ever used water filtered with a britta 
filter? how did it turn out?

Subject: Irish Moss (again)


 
Over the weekend I was brewed a batch of Pale Ale. Thinking I had 10 minutes 
more to go with boiling, I threw in my re-hydrated Irish moss. It was then 
I realized that I hadn't sanitized my CF chiller (I flush it with boiling 
water and then steam sanitize). 45 min later, (after adding more water to make 
up the loss in volume for the time boiling) I was ready to chill. 
Except now my Irish moss had been boiling for 45 min instead of 10-15. 
 
Question is:  What difference does it make?  Why do all of the reading sources 
say to throw it in with 10 minutes to go?  Why not the entire boil? 
 
Just Curious.

It was truly wonderful.  Waste not want not. 
 
Remember there are a number of recipes for  Cock (Roster) ale, where a

Hello all 
 
        Let me start by saying thanks to those that answered my last post 
regerding false bottoms, especially to Dave Burley who has been cranking out 
the replies to some of the less experienced brewers participating here, we 
appreciate the time and advice. 
 
        My next question is about getting a couple more glass carboy's for a 
reasonable price. I am going up into Bar Harbor Maine at the end of the 
month for a conference and will be driving there from New York. Sometime ago 
I heard from someone that there is a corning factory outlet in the south 
part of Maine, maybe in Kittery? Anyway they also said that you can purchase 
glass carboys there for $10 or so, does this sound at all accurate to anyone 
out there.

The Radical Brewer wants to know what to do with his bad, but drinkable beer. 
The suggestion of combining it with more DME or LME at less than boiling temps 
has merit.  One thing comes to mind:  You will lose alcohol content due to 
heating.  P'raps "dumping" the bad beer (BAD Beer!  No biscuit!) into a 
fermenter- that is, gently pouring, preferably under a CO2 pad- and adding 
some metabisulfite to "pastuerize" it, then adding about 2 gallons of boiled, 
unhopped new wort, repitch, and do the Dance of Submissivness to the beer 
gods.Be sure to give the metabisulfite about 24 hours to dissipate before 
adding new wort or yeast. 
- --- 
My understanding of hangovers, due to indepth field studies, is due to the 
combination of dehydration, vasoconstriction of brain bound blood vessles, 
and vitamin B depletion, all due to alcohol and the ketones and aldehydes 
that are byproducts of fermentation and distillation (of liquors) processes. 
In my experience, homebrew does NOT give me a hangover.  I once quaffed copius 
amounts of my Coffee House Porter (10%) and after a night of stumbling around, 
giggling and sleeping in the dog house, I felt great the next day.  Scary. 
It also works (for me anyway, FTROYG) if before an evening of planned 
overindulgence, like bowling night, to take a Tbs of brewers yeast, mix 
it into a glass of Orange Juice, and chase it with a glass of IPA.  The 
next day you will be able to tell that you should have a hangover, but 
it's just not manifesting.  This is due to brewers yeast being an excellent 
source of vitamin B.  A couple pints of water at bedtime does also help.

What is SPAMMING? 
Spamming is the now defunct sport of throwing a chunk of Spam (Tm.) through 
a large fan and admiring the resultant patterns on a white washed wall. 
The practice lost favor to the more popular contest of Barnyard Bingo (Tm.) 
The spirit of spamming was revived when one of the developers of the modern 
internet re-coined the phrase to mean splattering newsgroups with shotgunned 
advertisments in hopes of stirring up interest in the product or subject 
being "spammed". 
 
I hope I've answered your question.

   Don't know if this is available where you are, but Red, White and Blue 
could possibly be the worst beer ever; tastes like it's been filtered 
through a large horse. It makes the mega-brews you mentioned taste like 
champagne. Blech

First off, you shouldn't swear at you mother, swear at Jack!!  ;-) 
 
Second,  I have brewed probably 20 or so batches with an EM and 
I too get that air sucking into the hose.  I really don't think 
it's anything to worry about, I let the air suck in all it wants 
and I never have any off-flavors in my beer (at least not ones 
that could be associated with HSA).  I've always been of the opinion 
that it really doesn't matter if the sweet liquor gets aerated during 
the sparge because you boil off all of the oxygen anyway.  I'm not sure 
if this theory is correct or not, but like I said, I have no problems 
with HSA as far as I can tell. 
 
Another data point:  When I brew over my buddy's house we let the sweet 
liquor fall about 3 or 4 feet into the kettle.  This certainly results 
in pretty well aerated sweet liquor and again, no problems.  I remember 
the first time we did this I expressed concern that we were aerating the 
sweet liquor but we really didn't have any way of preventing it so we 
relaxed, didn't worry, and drank several homebrews.  I was pleasanltly 
surprised when the batch came out really well.  I haven't given it a 
second thought since.

Subject: Scouring SS kegs-thread


 
I have always used green Scotch pads to clean the inside and outside, 
for that matter, of my brewing kettle (a former SS keg). In my exper- 
ience, the pads do come in several degrees of coarseness. I just looked 
and the ones I use are marked "Tough Kitchen Cleaning". 
 
The reason I started using them, knowing that they would scratch, is 
that in "Brewing Lager Beer", in the section on Cleaning and Sterilizing, 
Greg Noonan says, "Brew Kettles of Copper, Stainless Steel or Aluminum: 
Articles of this construction are the only ones used in brewing upon 
which an abrasive should be used. In fact, they benefit from its employ- 
ment. The abrasives not only scour away calcified deposits but pitting 
and etching of the kettle surface improves heat transfer and protein 
coagulation during wort boiling." IMHO, if Noonan says it, it's good 
enough for me. Cuchulain Libby, fellow San Antonian, please note the 
reference to "calcified deposits", that applies strongly to our water. 
 
All that said I emphatically agree with those against using abrasive 
pads on plastics, fermenters, etc. 
 
Brew On!

Mark, your advice is correct - in fact, if brewed true to German style, a 
dunkel should have NO chocolate malt used whatsoever.  Of course, I 
recently made a Chocolate Lager which has been regarded by many as 
the finest beer I have ever created, and it had more chocolate malt than 
most American Brown Ales! 
 
I think I've created a new style - or should I just go the Pete's Wicked 
approach and call my Lager an Ale?
