Brewsters: 
 
Eric suggests that adding metabisulfite to beer will pasteurize it in the 
process of recovering a too low SG beer. Not so! Metabisulfite is not active as
a sterilant at beer pHs.  It is only significantly biologically active as 
sulfurous acid at pHs below 3.0 as in wines.

Subject: Badger Beer  From Rick Olivo  (AKA Strange Brewer)


I would like to ask for some help in researching a brew that was 
consumed in southeastern Wisconsin in the 1820's through the 1840s or 
so. A BIT OF BACKGROUND... Early in the 19th century, large discoveries 
of lead lying close to the surface of the ground in what 
would later become southeastern Wisconsin encouraged a mining boom that 
presaged the gold rush. The Wisconsin lead rush saw communities of lead 
miners springing up overnight. So eager were these men to dig up the 
richs of lead (used for many purposes, especially lead bullets, soft 
castings etc.) that they lived in their diggings, had stores and homes 
in holes in the ground. This, rather than the small fierce animal (which 
is rare in Wisconsin) gave Wisconsin the nickname "The Badger State." 
These men did not just live on the edge of the fronteer. They lived and 
worked in the howling wilderness. They, like all of their era, were also 
copious beer drinkers. Since they didn't even have time to raise a roof 
over their heads, they certainly didn't have time to grow barley or 
hops. they made do with whatever brews they could come up with, some 
fair, some foul. Of these, one of the most famed was a drink called 
"Badger Beer." From what fragmentary evidence I have been able to turn 
up from state historical archives, the beer consisted of maple syrup 
(sugar?) and honey obtained in trade with friendly indians, and spruce 
needles as a bittering agent instead of hops. I understand that the 
beverage was quick to ferment (my guess is that they used sourdough 
yeast) being ready to drink in a month after inital fermentation. It was 
described as "liquid joy" by one traveler upon tasting it for the first 
time and "far superior to ordinary brews." It was described as very 
pale, fragrent, and refreshing. I must admit I am puzzled by the 
rapidity at which it was ready to drink. I know honey meads can take 
over a year to properly mature. How could this brew be ready to drink so 
soon? At any rate, Badger Beer went out of existance when agriculture 
and the burgeoning brewing industry in Milwaukee made it easy to get 
low-cost beer without the trouble of brewing it. Badger beer thus 
vanished into the mists of time. I beleve this mysterous and appealing 
beverage should be revived. I welcome any comments and feedback here or 
as e-mail to me (Rick Olivo, my address is ashpress`at`win.bright.net)If by 
any chance someone has an actual recipie. I will gladly share my first 
case with them! Thank you for your intrest and assistance. Rick Olivo, 
aka Strange Brewer. (Note: None of this is copyrighted or reserved in

Matthew's flame against Red White and Blue brought back memories of 
college back in 1970, when we bought six packs of RW&B for 99 cents... 
It wasn't great beer, but it would get you where you were going, and 
that's all that mattered. It certainly isn't the worst beer I ever had. 
That dubious honor is a tie beetween Buckhorn beer and a case of Old 
Dutch beer I bought at 89 cents a sixer in 1986 in Pikeston, Ohio while 
selling cable TV to hillbillies.

Subject: Munich vs. crystal for Fest beers


Here in Australia, all our brewing malt is made from 2-row barley, and I 
guess it's fairly OK -- not quite what Dr. Fix would call "garbage malt", I 
don't think. 
 
On the other hand, none of the locally available malt is what could really 
be called "premium", either.  (And importing [even small quantities of 
crystal] from Germany is prohibitively expensive -- completely out of the 
question.)  There's now a local hybrid on the market called "Franklin", which 
begins to approximate premium European malt in having a somewhat better 
(lower) protein structure, and apparently having some of the other 
characteristics of Pils (the fresh malt smells headily sulphury, in a 
European way). 
 
But *all* of the colored malts available here (a light and a medium kilned 
malt, both called "Munich", and several degrees of crystal) -- all of these 
are made from the poorer, standard barley. 
 
My question is this:  Given this situation, what would be more likely to 
make a better Oktoberfest? -- (recipe-wise) -- Should one achieve *all* or 
nearly all of the malty-melanoidin level by using crystal (as recommended 
years ago by G. & L. Fix in the _Vienna_ book?);  or:  would it be better to 
get the same melanoidin level by using a base featuring some "Munich" (made 
from the same, ordinary barley), plus a reduced fraction of the crystal?  -- 
Thus, the question really is: for European-style bronze/malty beers in 
general is there an in-principle reason to prefer crystal over Munich, if 
both of these malts are produced from the same nothing-to-write-home-about 
kind of barley? 
 
I accept J. Frane's point that Oktoberfests ideally ought to have a 
"toastiness" which crystal alone can't achieve, and therefore in principle 
something like Munich should be used.  But my experiments seem to give me a 
better tasting beer when I achieve the desired melanoidin level by using 
only crystal.  Dr. Fix:  Is there something about mediocre Munich which 
makes it a worse option than mediocre crystal -- when those are the only 
two options available?

Subject: copper hysteria!


K. Sprague asks about off flavours in beer due to copper (Cu). 
 
As there will probably be many replies to this I'll keep it 
brief. 
 
Cu ions play a major role in beer flavour stability. 
The Cu ions are thought to catalyse (comparatively inactive) 
molecular oxygen into more reactive forms such as hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2). In the boil this may lead to (the much 
feared by homebrewers!) HSA, with associated husky/astringent 
flavours (as reported by Narziss) even in fresh beer. 
Such beer will also have poor flavour stability. 
 
I presume that "dirty" copper (copper oxide) is more soluble in 
wort than clean copper, hence would promote greater oxidation. 
Any copper equipment that comes in contact with wort should 
thus be shiny before each use, or done away with altogether! 
 
Comments from chemists/metallurgists?

Subject: Curious Lager fermenation temperature


Brew Gurus 
 
I plan on brewing my first lager soon. 
I'm using a YeastLabs Californian Lager (L35 I think) which in which a local 
home brew brochure recommends fermentation between 55-64 degrees. 
The 'award winning' brown ale recipe I'm following used 59 degrees. 
 
Aren't these temperatures too high for a lager, or is the Californian Lager 
yeast not a *true* lager yeast?  Also, why was a lager yeast being used in a 
brown ale?

On the alcohol thread, I too have noticed I don't feel the effects of alcohol 
quite as much when you're having a quite one compared to at a party.  I put it 
down to the fact you move about more at a party which seems to increase your 
metabolism, thus causing the alcohol to be absorbed into the blood quicker.

*  In my experience with kegs- you can carbonate by simply setting the 
pressure where you want it, and waiting, and waiting.  But hell, you might 
as well prime and wait it out if thats your plan.  One of the big 
advantages of CO2 and kegging (IMHO) is the ability to speed the process 
up!  You can get a keg comfortably carbonated in a couple days, rather than 
waiting a week. 
 
Heres my routine and pointers (YMMV) 
 
Sanitize, AND sterilize your keg.  Assemble, and prefill (purge) with CO2. 
Rack beer into keg. Leave some head space (about 5 or 6 inches).  As any 
young teenie bopper will tell you- six inches is /THAT/ much (thumb & 
forefinger held up).  Purge the head space again w/CO2 (ok, so maybe its 
overkill, but the CO2 is right there!).  Affix keg lid, and add slight 
pressure (5-10 psi) to set the seal.  -A couple of pointers:  Rinse the 
large O-RING in HOT water to soften it up for a better seal.  Before adding 
any pressure on the keg- position the keg lid, but instead of pushing the 
lever down, pull up on it first and wiggle/twist it into optimim position- 
again for a tight fit.  Apply the pressure now- just a little, THEN flip 
the lever down. 
 
I used to promote attaching the gas line to the liquid out line, and 
pumping in gas.  You can do this, but don't use the gas fitting on the 
liquid fitting (or vice versa, then are NOT interchangable, and over time 
will scratch and get beat up to the point where they leak.  Big hassle!) 
screw the liquid fitting onto the gas line if you want to do this.  BUT- do 
not drop pressure from the regulator or the liquid will backflow into the 
regulator and gunk it up.  NOT good! 
 
What I do now gets the same basic effect- 
        Attach the gas line to the gas IN fitting on the keg.  Lay the keg 
on its side, or hold in against your lap/thighs and "Shake Rattle Roll" 
that baby.  Increase the gas pressure to 25-30 psi.  You will hear gas 
enter the keg.  If you hold it sideways the gas will pass through liquid as 
it enters.  You can either stand there and shake that bugger till your back 
is broke, and you are exhausted, or lay it sideways- go about other tasks 
and give it a vigorous roll every 5 mins or so.  (I've always got something 
that should have been cleaned up in my "brewery".  Good time to catch up!) 
        The purpose here is to get CO2 dissolved in the liquid.  You are 
aiming to get up to a certain carbonation level- most likely is that after 
a bit of shaking you will still be below that level.  I do this right after 
racking, so my brew is still warm.  The next step is to put it in the 
fridge upright with gas attached at about 25 psi.  I leave it overnight, 
then after a day or so drop the pressure down to 5psi and serve.  The first 
couple glasses are real foamy (I always tend to jump the gun -early ) then 
become undercarbonated.  I usually drop all pressure off, then add back 
just enough to push the beer.  After another day, time to equilibrate, I'll 
run the keg at 2-5psi and everything smooths out. 
 
This method works well for me.  Granted- it always seems to take a while to 
get the carbonation truly balanced out.  Never seems to fail- the VERY last 
glass I draw always seems to have finally achieved that perfection of head, 
internal bubbles, mouthfeel, and clarity.  Then  phfooooooooosh.  All gone 
byby.  Murhpy!

Bill Griffin replied to John Posing's mash schedule.  I haven't read 
much on decoction, but I teng to agree.  Would the total water/grain 
ratio be best at 1-1.2 quarts/pound?  On that, I believe adding water 
to the decoction would not hurt, if it was boiled off before 
reintroducing the decoction to the mash.

Mike Uchima replied to sharrington`at`CCGATE.HAC.COM about haze.  I agree 
about the *protien* haze, and would suggest also the possibility of 
much tannin extraction, due to the extra long mash at a very high pH. 
Of course, the mash tends to acidify, however, the sparge may have also 
been high pH.  I also agree about the protien rest.  It really depends 
on the malt.  Most lager malts produced today work fine without a 
protien rest, due to their high modification.  There have been many 
threads on this.  One notable thread by Dr. George Fix.  Try picking up 
the 1995 Zymurgy special issue too.  There are lotsa good articles on 
malt and mashing.  I use Klages and don't see this problem.  Of course, 
I can get a bit retentive about acidification.  My mash and sparge 
water are treated.

Hi there 
 
I have built me a counterflow chiller with copper-pipe and garden

What is the best way to clean it ? I usually let clean water flow

Before use I sanitise it by letting boiling water flow through the 
copper until the water that flows from the outlet is also boiling 
hot. 
Is this o.k. ? What about rust ?

Subject: carbonating kegs


George de Piro writes that one should keep the CO2 keg high to avoid 
beer in the gas line.  I had this happen once, no joy at all! 
There is another easy (and much safer) fix, though.  Put a liquid in 
fitting on your gas line (or a y connector with two fittings - even a 
valve, if you want to get fancy) and carbonate through the long tube 
that goes all the way to the bottom of the keg.  This has several 
advantages - less shaking is required, as all the CO2 has to bubble 
through the beer if the keg is upright, and if you're shaking it 
horizontally, the beer cannot slosh directly into an open pipe leading 
to your gas line.  I have never had beer in my gas line since 
switching. 
Brew On!

Subject: RE: How much grain do you decoct?


     Hi all! 
 
     Kevin tells the collective that his mash tun isn't big enough to hold 
     all the grain and water he wants to mash, so he wants to decoct to 
     reach each temp rest.  He needs to know how much grain to decoct. 
 
     In my experience, I pull a volume of very thick mash equal to about 
     one-third of the volume of mash water.  It is uncharacteristically 
     unscientific of me to not use formulas, etc, but this works for me. 
 
     If you are worried about undershooting the target temp (as Kevin would 
     be since he has no room for more boiling water to be added) just pull 
     more of the thick mash.  Add the grains back slowly, but keep the 
     decoction hot as you add it back (it cools relatively quickly if left 
     open on the stove top).  If you are going to overshoot, it's no big 
     deal.  Just let the decoction cool and take longer to add it back. 
 
     In Kevin's situation, it's better to decoct too much of the mash than 
     not enough! 
 
     Have Fun!

     Hello again, 
 
     In communications with Mark Bayer a question arose:  how important is 
     it to brew with grains from the country that is known for the style 
     you are trying to emulate? 
 
     I believe that it is important to use the best malt you can find, but 
     do you really need to use German Pils malt for a Muenchner Helles, or 
     would Belgian Pils malt do just as well? 
 
     I'm sure that the different climates in which the grain is grown will 
     effect it, but will this be noticeable in the final product? 
 
     I happen to brew a lot of Germanic styles, and I happen to use mostly 
     German malts, but it's mostly because I like their quality.  I'm sure 
     that other countries make good malts, too. 
     ------------------- 
     My next question/comment has to do with malt quality.  A few weeks ago 
     I went to a nearby homebrew shop and asked for English chocolate malt. 
     The counter-guy handed me a bag of what looked like black malt.  I 
     said, "This looks like black malt."  He smelled it and said, "No, it's 
     chocolate."  He then showed me the Munton & Fison bag that he took the 
     malt from, and sure enough, it said that it was chocolate malt. 
 
     I bought it, but felt uneasy, because it really did taste like black 
     malt!  I obtained more M&F chocolate malt from a different shop.  It 
     looked, smelled, and tasted like I expected. 
 
     What's the deal?  Do malt suppliers sometimes mislabel their bags?  Do 
     the maltsters sometimes screw-up a batch, and instead of dumping it, 
     sell it to homebrewers?  Or is there that much variation in English 
     chocolate malt? 
 
     Any comments? 
 
     Have Fun!

Hi, folks.  Just to add an anecdote to the recent thread about barley wine 
yeast attenuation and the one about skipping the secondary.  First the 
latter.  For my one summer brewing experience (and it isn't so much 
off-flavors that I'm concerned about; it's heating the house up with 
several hours of gas stove activity.  Too sweaty), I brewed an APA in my 
never-ending attempts to come close to Anchor Liberty Ale.  In the interest 
of impatience, I went with only a primary ferment (in plastic and open 
fermentation w/ three skims over eight days).  Following the advice of a 
helpful brewer on this list (sorry, can't remember who), I then went right 
to bottling and siphoned the beer into my bottling bucket into a solution 
of Knox gelatin (one package for 4 gallons) and my bottling sugar.  Well, 
last night I cracked the first bottle after two weeks of conditioning. 
Clear as any beer I've brewed even though the beer *looked* cloudy as 
anything when I bottled.  As I believe Al pointed out, there is an amazing 
amount of sediment in the bottom of the bottles, but that's a minor 
annoyance. 
 
As far as the yeast part of this story is concerned, for this batch I used 
BrewTek's American Ale II.  Amazing attenuation.  OG was 1.060; FG was 
1.007!  This from a stepped-up one quart starter.  I've also used a slurry 
of this yeast that I repitched into a BW which went from 1.096 to 1.017. 
And carbonation was fine after a month of bottle conditioning.  Anyone else 
had these experiences with this yeast?

Call your local bottle water distributer and ask about used glass carboys. 
Here in the Detroit area, I get nice (very dirty!) 5 Gal carboys from 
Absopure (no affilation) for $5. You've got to be careful to inspect for 
cracks, chips, etc. As most bottlers have switched to plastic, these 
deals probably won't last (I always buy an extra or two with the 
anticipation that the next time I call they'll say "all gone").

George De Piro writes about starting siphons by using a 2-hole carboy cap, and 
pushing the beer out of the carboy with CO2 pressure... 
 
For us non-kegging types who don't have a CO2 tank, there's a related approach 
which works almost as well, at least when the *destination* container is a 
carboy. Put a carboy cap on the receiving carboy, with a racking cane shoved 
through the center hole; attach the outlet end of your siphon to the racking 
cane. Then, attach a piece of racking hose to the other hole in the cap, and 
suck. The vacuum created in the receiving carboy will start the siphon; and 
you're not sucking on anything that's going to come in contact with your beer, 
so there's minimal infection risk. You can also control the amount of 
splashing (i.e. aeration) -- if siphoning to primary, just poke the racking 
cane barely through the cap, so the wort falls the whole length of the 
fermenter; if siphoning to secondary, push the racking cane all the way to the 
bottom, so it starts without splashing.

I've noticed the color change in my chiller as well. Haven't noticed any off 
flavors that I can attribute to it, though. What sort of bad taste are you 
getting? 
 
Maybe you'll just have to brew often enough that the oxidation doesn't have 
time to build up between batches. :-)

So where does that leave cold remedies like NyQuil, which contain both 
acetaminophen *and* alcohol? Are they changing the formulation to take out the 
alcohol (or the acetaminophen)?

Yes. And my beers did seem to improve when I started using it. However: 
 
 o  It is godawful slow, and you have to keep refilling it every 5 minutes or 
    so (assuming you have the pitcher style). Takes *forever* to filter enough 
    water for a batch of beer. 
 
 o  At least around here (Chicago area), the levels of chlorine in the tap 
    water are high enough in the summertime that the Brita doesn't do a very 
    good job of removing it. There's still quite a bit of chlorine left -- you 
    can still smell/taste it. 
 
Lately, I've switched to one of those little faucet mounted carbon filters (I 
think mine is called "Instapure", or something like that). If you keep the 
flow rate low, the water coming out has no detectable chlorine taste or odor. 
I attach a piece of racking hose to it, and run it into one of my carboys, so 
I can filter a full 5 gallons more or less unattended.

Anything like the Longshot Black Lager? I actually thought the Black Lager was 
fairly decent stuff. (Didn't care too much for the Longshot Pale Ale, though.)

Oops, forgot to ask the 2nd part... 
 
According to the recipe, you mash 11 lbs of grain at 60 deg C for 90 
minutes. They describe it as a 'red' bitter, SG of 1.043??? What am I missing? 
 
Any thoughts, suggestions, would be appreciated.

this is not exactly brewing related but maybe some of you 
homebrewers in BC Canada know something about this? ;-) 
 
SURREY, British Columbia, Sept 12 (Reuter) - A thirsty thief hijacked 
a transport truck loaded with $60,000 Canadian ($43,748 U.S.) worth of beer, 
police in this town outside Vancouver said on Thursday.  Surrey police said a 
man 
armed with a handgun forced the truck's driver  to go to a nearby town where 
he 
released him and then took off with the beer truck. The truck was loaded with 
 
5,700 cases of beer. Police said the suspect was still at large.

Subject: out of date CO2 bottles


Recent posts about getting CO2 tanks a bargain basement prices reminded me 
that I recently purchased a tank setup (including Sanke type keg adapter, 
and regulators) for $20 (five pounder) at a flea market. The tank is full of 
CO2, and I certainly plan on using it for carbonation. 
        However, the date on the tank suggests that its last hydrostatic 
test was back in June of 1989. 
Can anyone tell me if this tank is still covered by the test, or does it 
need to be tested again. My CO2 supplier is one that doesn't actually refill 
the tanks, but swaps them (these are NOT fancy new aluminum tanks...) for 
full ones. If I brought this tank to them, empty, what would I expect......
