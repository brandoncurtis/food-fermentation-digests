collective homebrew conscience: 
 
i recently received a private email from a fellow hber who claimed that 
dewolf cosyns malt will give the *wrong* malt flavor for any type of german 
beer attempted. 
 
what is the basis for this?  is this a maritime versus continental barley 
issue?  how much difference is there? 
 
also, i have some used soda kegs that have some small dents on the inside. 
no rough edges that i can see, no torn metal, but dented.  is this a problem?

Kevin, 
I use a 10 gallon Gott, too, and I always (always, unless its just a 
simple 5-gallon single infusion recipe) do my mashing in my boil 
kettle, then transfer to the Gott for lautering and sparging.  That 
way, you can measure your current temperatures exactly, and don't 
have to worry about calculating temperatures.  Just be careful you 
don't overshoot your target temperatures...  When it comes time to 
transfer, I just use one of those 1 gallon "malt buckets", and it 
goes fairly quickly without too much aeration. 
 
Hope this helps.

It depends (of course!). Do you move your kegs after they've been carbonated? 
If you prime in the keg and then move them: plan on letting them sit until 
the yeast has settled again. This will happen to force carbonated kegs as 
well if you didn't wait long enough for the beer to clear before kegging. 
I force keg my beers. 
Most of the time I have a very small amount of yeast on the bottom of the 
keg when I clean them. I move the kegs as necessary; but, I haven't tried 
driving them across the state and then checking to see it the beer is still 
clear. (I'm camping next weekend. I'll need beer in the mountains. I'll try 
it and see. Report to follow.)

Subject: Badger Brew / Clean Copper / Who's Robbing Whom?


 
Rick Olivo asks during an interesting historical piece: 
 
"I must admit I am puzzled by the rapidity at which it was ready to drink. I 
know honey meads can take over a year to properly mature. How could this brew 
be ready to drink so soon?" 
 
I'm definitely speaking out of turn, having made only one (truly mediocre) 
mead ever, but I'd say that my emphasis above answers your question.  These 
"badgers" likely did not have refined palates, and I'd venture to say that a 
just-finished-fermenting mead would taste pretty damned good to someone 
living in a hole in the ground. 
 
***** 
 
Andy "the hysteria continues" Walsh suggests that too much copper oxide in 
yer brew will have you asking, "IMBR"?  Maybe so, maybe not, but if you want 
to clean copper before use, use a 50% white vinegar solution soak for about 
10 minutes.  My lautering manifold is press-fit copper pipe & fittings, and I 
just toss'em in a bowl of the stuff before I brew.  I suppose you could spray 
or wipe the vinegar onto a difficult surface such as a chiller coil, to avoid 
having to use a lot of vinegar in a bucket or whatever.  No scrubbing is 
required.

Less than $8 a case?  I don't think the truck driver's the only one being

Hoptech (1-800-DRY-HOPS, http://www.hoptech.com) 
sells pellets of Northdown.  No affiliation, just 
a satisfied one-time customer. 
 
BTW, Northdown was bred from Northern Brewer and 
like N.B., it is a good bittering and aroma hop. 
N.B. would probably make a decent substitute.

Im not sure how literally to take this!  I like to fill the kegs just about 
as full to the top as I can get it.  Less air risk, even with purging.  Just 
dont want new keggers to leave 5-6" of head space, thats a lot of space!

I have just finished an extract receipe called "Columbus IPA" courtesy of 
Hoptech in Pleasanton, Ca. and the Pacific Coast Brewery in Oakland. It's 
*very* hoppy and bitter, using 2 oz. Columbus for the 60 minute boil, 2 oz. 
flavor Columbus (10 minutes remaining in the boil) and dry hopped with 1.5 
oz. Columbus in the primary. 
 
I'm trying to find out more about the Columbus hops, but can't find anything

Subject: Northdown hops, CAMRA recipe


 
 
 
Bill Rust asked about Northdown Hops.  They're available in the US from 
HopTech at $10 for 8oz of pellets (1995 crop just now.)  Northdown is 
one of the newer general purpose British hops, working well for bittering 
or later additions, with moderately high acid content (8.6% for my package.) 
The closest alternatives are Target or Challenger (although they might be just 
as hard to get.)  The Northdowns worked very well for a Fuller's London Pride 
"clone" that I brewed last month. 
 
Bill also asked about a fairly mysterious CAMRA recipe for a "red bitter." The 
color and SG might be understandable, since British pale malt tends to be 
pretty dark, and the recipe was almost certainly for 23 liters (6 US gallons.) 
The temperature listed (60C) is probably a typo.  Does 154F sound better?

Subject: Hang-overs / CO2 Saturation


Thanks to all who responded. Seems to be interest in the hang-over thread, 
but no consensus, and no clarification of what 'preservatives' might include. 
To summarize the submitted theories (apologies to the submitters if I 
misinterpret) - 
 
1. The accumulation of acetaldehyde (product of chemical reactions occuring 
primarily in the liver during alcohol metabolism) causes the hangover 
symptoms. The effects should be no different in Canadian or U.S. beers. 
 
2. The accumulation of acetaldehyde is caused by the lack of vitamin B, which 
helps the body metabolize sugars/alcohol. Beer that is 
filtered/centrifuged/pasturized is removed of yeast, which is high in vitamin 
B. (a pre-indulgence concoction of 1 tbs. brewers yeast in orange juice 
chased with an IPA is suggested as a precautionary measure). 
 
3. The addition of sugar causes hang-overs. "...no added sugar, only real 
malted barley, no hangovers...'. '...so called commercial beer brewed for 
profit by the large industrial brewers does <cause hang-overs>'. 
 
4. Dehydration due to the diuretic effects of alcohol. The body must have 
water to properly metabolize alcohol. 
 
5. The mental state or mood of the drinker. 
 
6. The addition of a 'cobalt heading agent' to the beer. (The addition of 
anything to a beer might become suspect.) 
 
As budding scientists, we have decided to continue our research. We have 
discovered that consuming Canadian beer brought back here to the states also 
results in relatively hang-over free mornings (this discounts theory #5, as 
we are not terribly happy to be back to work). We have had similar results 
with my Homebrew, as well as several organically grown wines labeled 'no 
added sulfites'. I would ask one more time - what preservatives are added to 
commercial beer, and what are the possible effects? I have heard of allergic 
reactions to sulphites (Our wine tests indicate that my drinking buddy has 
this affliction. She is often terribly sick after drinking only a glass or 
two of 'contains sulphites' wine, but not after the 'no added sulphites' 
brands). Are they added to beer? 
- --------------------------------------- 
Finally a brewing related question - Alan Edwards posted a most useful CO2 
saturation table relating temperature and keg carbonating pressure to obtain 
a desired carbonation level. How does this relate to dispensing pressure? A 
few months back Ken Schwartz discussed the expected pressure drop from keg to 
mug through the various fittings, length of tubing, etc. If the carbonating 
pressure and dispensing pressure are different, how do you keep the 
carbonation level constant? (Considering the change of temp. when moving keg 
to fridge, and the possible loss of carbonation as the keg is drained.) 
 
Thanks (again)

To: homebrew`at`aob.org 
 
Brewers! 
 
A current thread deals with the best/quickest way to carbonate a keg. 
Here's another.  When you purchase an airstone from Gulfstream Air 
Products (I *think* that's the name), they include instructions for 
using your airstone for carbonating your keg.  In fact, the instructions 
are *only* about this;  nothing about wort areation. 
 
Beer should be chilled.  Basically the instructions say to attach 
the airstone to a 1/4" hose, and attach the other end to the "gas-in" 
tube, inside the keg. The hose should probably be about two feet long. 
It's best to heat the end of the tube with hot water first to make it 
easier to slip onto the gas-in stub. 
 
Once the line is in place, bleed gas into the keg in two pound increments, 
waiting until it stops bleeding into the keg. Keep increasing (in two pound 
increments) until you reach the gas saturation you need (he provided a 
table of beer styles/pressure). Once the beer is where you want it, bleed 
off the pressure, remove the line and airstone, re-seal and re-pressurize. 
Using this method, you can completely carbonate in just a few minutes. 
 
Obviously this is going to work better the finer the airstone. The one I 
purchased is two microns. Others sold by other homebrew suppliers are as 
much as 30 microns. 
 
Also, Dion Hollenbeck wrote an article about a year ago for Zymurgy that 
showed how to build a corney keg lid with separate gas-in fitting on the 
top, and airstone attached underneath. This probably is the best, and 
easiest method.

Hello All: 
 
I think this debate over allowing only HBD members is plain stupid, 
or at least a Republican notion.  I do not subscribe to the HBD, I 
get it from the site at Stanford 
(ftp.stanford.edu/pub/clubs/homebrew/beer).  Every day!  I do not 
want to subscribe, I feel that this makes me rely on the internet 
Gods for delivery, and I could miss a day and have to go get it 
anyway.  I do not want to wait for a 40 K letter to download through 
my telephone connection to my ISP, although I do not know how long a 
wait that might be. 
 
I thought that home brewing and the HBD was one of the last bastions 
of free thought, but I guess I was wrong.  As more and more people 
know of home brewing, the gene pool is obviously diluted and the 
Republicans move in with their *pass more laws, so that we can 
control the fringes of our society*. 
 
Yeah, keep the riff-raff out by making the HBD a posting for 
subscribers-only forum.  Yes, the war on drugs is working and 
cost-effective also.

I do not doubt that you have not detected any HSA problems (viz. the 
recent discussion here suggesting that it may be an exaggerated 
concern on the homebrew scale) but the concept above is not correct. 
Oxygen interaction with hot mash or wort will oxidize melanoidins, 
that is the oxygen will chemically alter their composition (real 
chemists please don't cringe *too* much), and this is fundamentally 
different from dissolving oxygen (O2) molecules into the liquid. 
That is, oxidation does not equal oxygenation/aeration. Yes, any 
oxygen that dissolves *as O2* will be driven off during the boil, but 
once the melanoidins are oxidized, that's it, no turning back. 
Melanoidins oxidize readily, and the goal is not to oxidize them 
until absolutely necessary-- that is, way downstream in the brewing 
process, like during aging.  If they are unoxidized early in the 
process, they are there later to oxidize first from the inevitable 
introduction of oxygen later on in the process, instead of other 
things (alcohol to aldehydes?) oxidizing to produce unpleasant 
flavors.

Subject: Pils/Lagering in Cornelius/Counterflow


RE Bill Giffin comments on Pils mash thickness: I also dough in with about 
a quart per pound and infuse to the acid rest. I also add some water to the 
first and second decoctions to get the mash on the way and thin it somewhat 
to prevent scorching. I find that these additions are more than made up for 
by the water lost during the decoctions and fairly liberally add infusions 
of water to the rest mash during the lauter decoction. I want the mash to 
be fairly loose before transfer to the lauter tub as I believe this aids in 
the formation of a properly stratified grain bed. After collection of wort 
down to about 2 P I have just about the length I'm shooting for and thus 
have to add additional water to makeup for the water lost during the boil 
i.e. the loose mash at lauter is not so thin reduction by boiling is 
required. Recognize that my equipment and technique is likely to give 
different results from someone else using different equipment.

There's been some discussion of lagering in Cornelius kegs. I do this as a 
matter of course. Once the gravity is within a degree or so of terminal, I 
blow down the yeast and counter-pressure transfer to kegs. George De Piro 
posted concerns about venting of volatiles. I don't worry about this 
because either the beer is fermented to the point where the volatiles have 
been scrubbed by the CO2 or the Cornelius must be vented during lagering to 
keep the pressure within reasonable limits (mostly a dissolved CO2 level 
concern though Greg Noonan has publised that lagering should not take place 
above 5 psig.) In other words, there is a certain amount of CO2 which is 
produced when a certain amount of sugar is fermented and most of this is 
going to be vented one way or another even if it through a slow gas leak 
around a cold, hard keg O-ring. One can buy pressure relief valves to 
automatically vent the keg as the gas pressure rises above an adjustable 
pressure. 
 
I have often wondered if the scrubbing of volatiles could be speeded up by 
repeating cycles of over-pressurizing followed by venting. Finally I'll 
comment that its been my observation that production of H2S with lager 
strains dropped noticeably when I started oxygenting my worts to reasonable 
levels.

Braam Greyling asked about cleaning counterflow chillers. My personal 
scheme involves running left over boiling water (kept around for 
replenishing losses in the kettle as explained above) through it to 1. push 
the last of the wort into the fermenter and 2. rinse the insides of the 
thing. I then shut off the heat and cooling water, add some beer line 
cleaner to the remaining hot water and recirculate that through for a few 
minutes to remove proteinaceous material and then finish off with lots of 
cold water.  I have seen it suggested that one can coax a lead sinker 
attached to fishing line through the coil and then pull brushes through 
with the fishing line but I've been too timid to try that.

Orville Deutchman asks what his gas supplier (who is a swapper, not a 
filler) will do when he brings in a tank with an out of date hydro test. I 
immagine that depends on the supplier. The local company around here would 
(i believe) simply swap it. Part of the price of the gas includes keeping 
the tanks in spec. By contrast, on one occasion I "filled" a bottle which I 
thought was empty (but it wasn't) and blew the pressure relief disk. In 
this case they charged me a $12 "service" charge and swapped it.

Subject: Spruce beer,


Brewsters, 
 
Rick Olivo talks about "Badger Beer". Very interesting. I'm sure that if honey 
were diluted to the same approximate OG as wort for beer it would ferment just 
as fast. I suspect the use of Spruce ends ( that is the lighter colored growing
ends of the blue spruce, rather than the needles) to flavor beer was not an 
invention to the Scandinavians  who made up a large part of the population in 
the area and who drank Spruce Beer back home for centuries before hops were 
introduced.  The American Heritage Dictionary p 1183, 2nd ed 1982 says "spruce 
beer  a slightly fermented beverage made with an extract of spruce needles and 
twigs with molasses or sugar". 
 
Braunsweiger Mum(m) ( Papazian's HB Companion p378) includes spruce bark and 
the
growing blue spruce ends and many spices and unusual ingredients including ten 
unbroken, uncracked freshly laid eggs ( likely the origin of "What do you want?
egg in your beer? Just kidding.)  I also have seen a recipe for spruce beer I 
think in Papazian's first book -"Joy of HB" ( where IS that book?) anyone still
have a copy or a recipe? 
 
I suggest you start with an OG of about 1.050 made from honey. Use a beer yeast
starter or a sourdough starter as your source of yeast ( although sourdough 
contains both a yeast and a bacterium). put about a pint of spruce ends in a 
quart of water. Boil covered for 5 minutes, cool and steep under a lid.  Use 
this spruce tea to flavor your Badger Brew. 
 
It is interesting you should speculate that sourdough bread starter ( or 
leavin's as they were called in the Midwest) was used to start the 
fermentation.
In Alaska and along the NW American coast, miners were reputed to drink the 
liquid from large barrels of sourdough starter for its alcoholic content. This 
was called "Hooch"  since a local Indian tribe called the Hoochino drank this 
and apparently even distilled it and is the origin for the word in our 
vernacular or so go the miner's tales. The sourdough makes me think of Alaskan 
miners and about the Tale of Sam McGee. "Shut the door, it's cold in here!" And
Babe the Blue Ox and all those lakes in Minnesota ......... 
- ------------------------------------------------------- 
Rick Olivo claims to have hated the Old Dutch beer he drank in Ohio while 
selling cable TV to the "hillbillies". There are no native hillbillies in Ohio,
they're in the southern Appalachian Mountains.  You probably met the "Br'ar 
hoppers" from Kentucky and WVa. 
 
Who sold you the Old Dutch? 
 
This used to be called Dutch beer, but when no one bought it 'cept "furiners", 
they changed its name.

Andy Walsh writes about dirty copper and I'm reminded of the Phrase "what's a 
penny made of?" 
 
Cupric ion in many ways is a lot like calcium in its acid/ base reactions but 
not its oxidation reactions and it will likely precipitate out in the same pH 
range as beer as part of ( and cause a) haze. Iron and copper concentrations in
a haze are increased to a large degree over the solution concentration. Copper 
sulfate in ppm concentrations ( like 5ppm) are used to remove hydrogen sulfide 
and related mercaptans from wine. These come out as the very insoluble cupric 
sulfide.  Copper has been used for centuries in cooking and  water pipes of 
many, many houses in the US and Britain ( and likely Oz) have copper piping. As
long as iron doesn't exist in the water in the ferrous state it will not 
promote
the solution of copper metal and copper metal is not soluble in acid.  The 
oxides of copper are soluble in acid and if they are on the surface they will 
dissolve. Cupric ion is a necessary ingredient in needed minerals for health in
low concentrations. In higher concentrations it is a poison.   Andy's point 
about dealing only with clean copper is well taken. What kinds of concentration
are we talking about? anybody?.

My experience the last two hop harvests was remarkably similar. 
First it was the itchy nose, then my arms started. Unfortunately 
my crop was small enough that I could put up with the symptoms 
until I was finished harvesting.  A shower went a long way 
towards making me feel better but I had that same fear that 
this could turn into an allergy to hops in beer.  I've started 
myself on a strict  sensitizing regimen to ward off that 
possible outcome.  I'm ensuring that I get enough Pale Ale in 
my diet that I can maintain the necessary antibodies.

Another unusual footnote was that after picking my hops I felt 
kind of introspective.  I kept rubbing the palm of my hand. 
Oh - and there was this maraca sound too.

                  The Premier Homebrewing Competition 
                 Now open to the entire known universe! 
 
 The Brews Brothers annual Novembeerfest homebrew competition has been 
 the leading homebrewing competition in the Pacific Northwest for the 
 past several years. Because the Brews Brothers now boast a larger number 
 of BJCP certified judges, we decided to allow ANYONE to enter our 
 competition, not just those living in the northwest. 
 
 The actual competition will be held on November 2, 1996 at the Redmond 
 Brewing Company from 10:00 until we finish awarding the Best of Show 
 trophy. We ask that brewers submit three standard brown bottles and 
 $5(U.S.) per entry.  The entry deadline is October 30. Those traveling 
 from foreign countries who arrive later than the deadline may enter as 
 late as 7:00PM on November 1 for an additional $5(U.S.) late fee. 
 
 The Best of Show winner will receive a magnificent engraved crystal 
 stein with their name (and their beer s) prominently displayed. Class 
 winners will receive custom parchment certificates with appropriately 
 colored ribbons.  As of this writing, we are gathering a plethora of 
 commitments from sponsors for prizes.  It s safe to say that if you brew 
 a decent beer, you ll receive some sort of prize! 
 
 You may find out more about Novembeerfest in several ways: 
 
   Point your browser at http://members.aol.com/novembeer - This is a 
   temporary home for the Brews Brothers Web Site until a more 
   suitable Windows NT host can be found.  We ll leave a pointer 
   there indefinitely however.

Dave Burley Wrote in #2183: 
 
"I rack to the secondary after a week, normally, to get the beer off the 
majority of the trub and to give me a relatively pure yeast deposit in 
the secondary with which to krausen and hold over for the next ferment 
as a chilled slurry in a capped bottle. " 
 
Question:  Since I just saved the yeast from my secondary in this manner, 
and it sits now in my refrigerator, what preparation is needed before I 
pitch this slurry in my next batch?  Also, how long can I reasonably 
store this in my refrigerator?  Thanks

Orville wanted to know if his CO2 Tank which had its last hydrostatic 
test dated in 1989 was still valid. 
 
I believe hydrostatics tests need to  be repeated every five years, 
in that case you need to get it done again
