Subject: Longshot contest


I was excited when I came home today and noticed a package from 
Boston.  I opened it and pulled out my T-shirt, bag of hops, and my 
score sheets.  Could this mean that I will have my recipe changed and 
marketed as my own? No, I looked at the score: a 21. 
  WOW!  What happened?  I started to chuckle to myself.  I got an 18 
last year for my Oatmeal Stout, so I decided to enter this years version 
to see how it would do.  I had already taken it to a club meeting, where 
it received good reviews. I started to read the notes: "serious 
infections"  "foul smelling" "not pleasant to drink" "not drinkable."  I 
thought maybe it could have gotten infected when I bottled it from the 
keg, so I went to my garage and got one of the bottles I saved in case I 
needed a "lab analysis."  I poured the stout, and, to my dismay, it 
tasted great! 
  I've decided that $5 is a good deal for 1/2 LB of hops and a T-shirt, 
but I don't think it warrants wasting three bottles of my brew.  Next 
year, I'm sending either three bottle of urine, or three bottles of 
Boston Lager (recapped of course).  I'm not sure which would score 
higher.

Subject: Copper - RELAX!


Dave Burley asks the following about copper: 
 
>What kinds of concentration are we talking about? anybody?. 
 
The data I have is that less than 100 ug/l of Cu++ can lead to 
definite stale flavours in production lager force aged at 
50 C for 4 days (or 5 months or so aging at 23C). This sounds 
like quite a high concentration to me. 
 
Note that copper acts on *molecular* dissolved oxygen, which 
is not present in the wort boil, so does not relate to HSA. 
I was being more than a little misleading in my previous post. 
I'm sorry! (The HBD police are letting me get away with 
murder these days!) 
 
These experiments were on *filtered* lager, which did not 
have the reductive power of yeast available. I suspect that 
for all intents and purposes the oxidative effect of copper 
on unfiltered homebrew can be safely ignored.

Subject: HELP w/ stuck fermentation


     I've been brewing for 2 years, and have my first stuck fermentation. 
Any related experience or advice is welcome.  First, the specifics: 
 
Recipe: 
7#  pale dry malt extract 
1# amber malt syrup 
1# honey 
1.5# specialty malts (crystal, black, chocolate) 
24 IBU's 
Wyeast 1056 
OG=1.076 
Ferm temp=70-74 F 
 
     I did a full volume wort boil, and chilled using an immersion wort 
chiller.  I then poured and stirred vigorously to aerate, and sealed 
in a sanitized bucket with lid and airlock.  The yeast was cultured 
from a 4-month old bottle of homebrew (the dregs were added to a 
1/2-pint sterile wort starter, which was later added to a 1-pint 
starter).  The starters fermented strongly and looked/smelled 
healthy.  After pitching, I had strong activity in the airlock within 
8 hours.  24 hours later, I had more than 1 bubble per second.  48 
hours later, it was 1 bubble per 1.5 MINUTES.  I am now at day three, 
there is no visible activity in the airlock, and the krausen has 
fallen.  A specific gravity reading shows the beer at 1.046. 
Although it tastes OK (ie, no infection or off-flavors), it is 
obviously very thick and sweet. 
     On day three, I moved the fermenter to a warmer location, and 
stirred the yeast up off the bottom with a long handled spoon. 
     What else can I do to get the fermentation going again?  My 
aeration technique has never caused problems before, even when making 
high-gravity recipes.  I have never had a problem culturing yeast 
from bottles of homebrew, especially after stepping it up in a 
starter.  I have another batch going, that is almost ready to rack to 
a secondary...  should I rack the stuck beer onto the OK batch's 
yeast dregs? 
     Again, any advice would be appreciated. 
 
Thanks, 
Paul

The best combination for cleaning Stainless Steel is the Scotch brand green

Subject: Summary of infection taste cures


Thanks to all who replied to my last post. The bottom line is that I am 
probably screwed but I do have hopes as of yet. People sugested masking the 
infected tastes by using the beer for cooking, mixing it with OJ or some 
other juice, create a fruit beer out of it since extracts are not too 
costly and it's worth a try, and to simply spice it up, call it a Christmas 
brew, and hope for the best! 
 
What I have done so far is add a pound of blueberries and steeped in a 
couple pounds of dark malts. What was once supposed to be a nice German 
wheat ( the other five gallons was beautiful) is now  I really don't know, 
but its tasting better...... 
 
Thanks, 
Greg Douhan

I had to chuckle over this one, based on a near-disasterous mishap I had. I 
also use a 6.5 gal. carboy, and retired my 1 1/4 inch blowoff hose in favor of 
the extra headspace, until this happened: One night I put my carboy in it's 
usual dark corner with!
a 5 gal batch, dry hopped with whole leaf hops, and Whitbread ale yeast (which 
I have found since to be _quite_ active) and stoppered with a normal airlock. 
My wife gets up in the AM about 1 1/2 hours earlier than I do, and that morning
she came in, wo!
ke me from my hop-filled slumber, and said "Should this thing be whistling like
this?" I arose to find that my airlock was full of foam and trub, and had been 
almost completely plugged by hop cones!! When I removed the airlock, I was 
rewarded with a ni!
ce "WHOOSH" as the pressure was relased all at once. Fortunately it had not 
been under pressure long enougn for too much CO2 to be in suspension, and I did
not end up with a gyser!
I have since pulled my blowoff hose out of retirement, and usualy only need to 
use it for the first 24 hours. And so far, the Whitbread yeast is the only one 
that I have had foam out through the blowoff hose.
 
Brew On!

This is coming from a malt extract brewer who is trying to figure out 
how to move to all-grain.  When you transfer from your boil kettle to 
your Gott cooler, is HSA really a concern?  Aren't you going to lauter 
out your wort, and then re-boil and add hops?  Or are hops added 
already in your boil kettle?

Well, FWIW (<$0.02), it's not a bad idea to limit posting to members

I believe there is more private e-mail going on in this forum than 
not.  IMHO, there's no ear for the ranting from those who don't 
subscribe, nor is there an ear for their stereotyping and namecalling. 
If they don't wish to belong, then that's their choice.  We need a way 
to stop the spamming, solicitation, and other nuisance postings that

Well I just looked 'em up and it says 8% AA. 
 
On a similar note, but in reverse, when converting recipes formulated 
for US gallons 
to our big chunky British ones, how should I convert hop, grain, and 
malt extract weights? 
 
I believe 1 US gallon = 4/5 Imperial gallon.  Do I just multiply the 
amounts of everything by 5/4 
or is it more complicated than that?

Subject: Spruce Beer/Badger Beer


Just made B & K Black Honey Spruce Beer from Papazian's NJHB book. 
Fortunately I cut the spruce essence back to 1/2 oz vs. the 1 oz. in the 
recipe as I find the spruce flavor to be very strong.  There's about 
7HBUs of bittering in the extract recipe, presumably enough to balance 
the malt without any real bittering flavor.  I can't imagine spruce 
being used to "bitter" those "Badger beers" but it is a strong flavor 
and you wouldn't want too much bitterness anyway on top of the spruce. I 
like the spruce beer but its not for everyone.  Also thanks to (I forget 
who now?) for pointing out that my 1 cup of honey to prime this spruce 
beer was a little excessive.  Maybe Papazian in CHB was thinking 8oz of 
weight of honey not 8oz volume?  I'll try less honey next time.

Apparently they are available from Brewers Resource, 1-800-827-3983 (NABBB) 
and the Home Brewery  1-800-305-4677 (NABBB).  Oh, that means No 
Affiliation, Blah, Blah, Blah. 
 
[Q. gravity of 1.042 for 11 lbs. of malt?] 
 
Oops, on the advice of Kent Townlty, I rechecked my inputs and discovered 
that I made an omission: it's a 23 litre recipe!  I've fixed it here. 
   23 litres = 6.08 US gallons 
The only malt listed was 5000g of pale malt 
   5000g = 5kg = 11.02 lbs 
To convert to 5 US gallons:  5/6 of 11.02 = 9.18 lbs 
 
If you get 35 pts/gallon optimal (100% efficiency) per lb. of grain, that 
gives 1.064.  If we can assume the more realistic 75% eff., that gives 
1.048.  Depending on the author's extract efficiency, that more or less 
explains the SG question.  (Be merciful on my figures, gurus, I'm doing this 
part from memory...) 
 
[Q. How about the red color?  The only listed malt is pale malt.]

One last issue... 
Q. Will 9 lbs of grain mashed at 60 deg. C. (140 F) for 90 minutes produce 
an SG of 1.048 (I must assume from the recipe that it was a single step 
infusion)?

I have paid pretty close attention to volumes in my all-grain 
batches, as I come near the volume limits of my lauter tun on a 
regular basis. I've found through four batches that 1lb of grain 
will add ~310ml, or 1 1/3 cups (1/3 qt) of volume in a mash, as 
long as enough water is in the mash to saturate the grain. This 
is constant for any amount of water added, e.g. 
    1lb + 1qt = 1 1/3 qt 
    1lb + 2qt = 2 1/3 qt 
 
This number has varied surprisingly little between the batches, so 
I'm pretty confident it should work in your system. 
 
Hope this helps,

In Canada a case is 12 bottles rather than 24. So a case of 24 (which we 
call that a flat up here) costs about $15can to the brewery after taxes 
which is about doubled before it gets to the consumer. The long and the 
short of it is the one getting robbed up here is the consumer at about US$20 
for a 'case' of 24.

Subject: Grain Volume / Keg OverCarbonation / Airstones / Scrub-a-dub Yer Beer


John Varady asks: 
 
"can anyone tell me what the resulting volume of 1 quart of water 
mixed with one pound of grain?? " 
 
I don't have the exact figures handy on my work PC but check my web page for 
an article containing volume and heat calculations and trivia.  Remember that 
there are two "volumes" you're dealing with.  One is the "apparent" volume of 
dry crushed grain; for example, you dump 10 pounds of crushed grain into a 
beverage-cooler mash tun and you note that it fills to say 3 gallons.  The 
other is the "actual" volume which accounts for the air spaces between the 
grits.  Adding 3 gallons of strike water to this same "three gallons" of 
grain results in maybe four gallons total volume.  So the 10 pounds really 
occupies only about 1 gallon (but check the document for a more accurate 
figure -- I think it's more like 0.08 gal [0.32 qt] per pound). 
 
***** 
 
John adds, on a different topic: 
 
"From the charts I have seen you pretty much want to set your pressure to 
about 8.2 lbs to carbonate a keg thats at 32F to 2.5 volumes. If you 
hook your keg up at 25-30 psi and put it in your coldest fridge (say 40F) 
wouldn't you be overcarbonating???" 
 
Left sitting quietly in a fridge, it will take quite a while for the beer to 
reach equilibrium (many days).  The trick is to "catch" it at the right point 
and then relieve the excess pressure.  And even if you do overcarbonate it, 
you can vent any keg periodically to allow excess CO2 to come out of 
solution.  None of this happens instantly, although the keg-shaking ritual 
and the airstone techniques can come close.  I suppose you could 
"de-carbonate" an overripe keg by shaking and venting, though this is likely 
to result in a beer shower. 
 
***** 
 
Chuck Wettergreen describes a keg carbonation technique using an airstone, 
using bubbles "the finer the better" to paraphrase him.  What about using 
cheap-ass aquarium stones -- boil'em to sanitize and maybe just toss'em after 
the keg's done (the bulk stones are pretty cheap).  They're made of glass 
beads (don't know what the binder material is though).  You could just leave 
it in the keg.  If you're inlcined to spend just a bit more, they also come 
in a variety of shapes -- the long wand-like units should offer a beautiful 
cascade of fine bubbles to do the trick.  Comments anyone? 
 
***** 
 
A. J. deLange has often wondered: 
 
"I have often wondered if the scrubbing of volatiles could be speeded up by 
repeating cycles of over-pressurizing followed by venting." 
 
I've heard of people doing this to tone down over-dryhopped beers, so I don't 
see why it wouldn't work as you suggest.

Subject: Lagering in Corny's


 
I've been unable to follow exactly how cornelius keg lagering is done, so 
perhaps those knowledgable will critique my past efforts and planned 
modifications. 
 
I primary ferment lagers in a carboy in a small fridge for about 2 weeks.  I 
then transfer to an old, but serviceable corny.  I remove the poppet from 
the in fitting, and attach a plastic airlock, and lager for a month or so at 
40 degrees (the lo temp limit of my fridge controller, the storied %*!`at`# 
Airstat).  I then reinstall the poppet in the in fitting, and transfer into 
a clean keg for carbonation and, at last, blessed consumption of the 
marvelous brew. 
 
I gather that the airlock is not necessary, and if I bleed the keg every 
couple of days, I'll be OK.  I won't have to screw around with the poppet, 
 Last time, the %*!`at` Airstat malfunctioned, and froze my darn secondary. 
 
So, next time, I won't have an airlock, I'll just bleed the pressure.   Most 
hassles seem to center on airlock maintenance.   Will this work?  Next time, 
I won't freeze the beer, but my Airstat might, again.  How will a sealed keg 
handle freezing beer? 
 
Your replies are appreciated.

Subject: carbonation balance


collective homebrew conscience: 
 
chris pertschi asked: 
 
<snip> If the carbonating 
>pressure and dispensing pressure are different, how do you keep the 
>carbonation level constant? 
 
dave miller talks a little about this in his newest book.  the idea is to 
figure out how much carbonation pressure you will apply (based on the 
desired carbonation level `at`temp.).  once you get this value in psi, you 
need to balance the system so that the restriction imposed on the outflowing 
beer is pretty close to your carbonation pressure.  the restriction is 
imposed by the dispense hose, the tap, and how far the beer has to "climb" 
from the level of the beer to the tap.  smaller diameter dispense 
hoses impose more restriction than larger diameter hoses.  there is also 
restriction at the tap.  apparently cobra type taps impose very little 
restriction compared to other sorts of taps, like permanent ones in bars, etc. 
 
if you don't balance the system, and have a lot less restriction than the 
pressure you're putting on the keg, the beer will flow very quickly and you 
will end up with excessively foamy beer. 
 
so basically, the pressure that's pushing the beer is the carbonation 
pressure you're applying minus all the restrictions.  you'd like it to be 
a positive value, but not too big. 
 
all this should be considered with the fact that i have only recently 
acquired a draft system and haven't used it more than twice.  but it's 
working fine, using the ideas presented above.

i think what jim (busch) is doing is setting the pressure intentionally high 
and then cutting off the process before it goes to equilibrium.  this way 
he doesn't have to wait a longer period for the CO2 to dissolve using a lower 
carbonation pressure from the table, which is based on equilibrium conditions. 
jim, correct me if this is wrong.

Subject: Culturing multi-strain  yeast


Hi everyone, 
 
I started to culture yeast about 3 years ago and was quite successful 
(not a single contaminated batch and 3 medals at sanctioned AHA 
competitions). 
I am presently culturing the following types (all from Wyeast): 
Irish Ale (very stable ) 
London Ale 
Czech Pils 
I would like to culture the British Ale yeast . It is supposed to be 
from Witbread ( a multi-strain yeast ).So this is the question: 
When I transfer from one agar slant to another,will the ratio of 
strain A/strain B change after a few propagations ? 
 
Thank's for any help I could get.

Subject: To RIMS or to not...? | RE: Who's robbing whom?


I'm finally going to move on up to full grain brews and am starting to 
design my system.  Being an inspiring design engineer(flaming not 
appreciated here) I want to spend a little time to get the system done the 
way I want the first time, reducing future costs.  One decision is whether 
or not to include a RIMS in my brewery?  I have seen and read of the 
advantages of the system (I don't have access to any Zymurgy issues) but 
haven't run across the disadvantages (there must be a couple) other than 
cost and building time.  It seems to be a trade off between reducing brewing 
effort and the nostelgia of manually transfering gallons of hot 
wort/runnings and hitting correct temperatures. 
If someone has a few data points on the subject could they please send them 
to me privately, if it's worthwhile I can summarize.  Also, is there any 
benifit to using a RIMS for sparging?

Not sure who you think is getting it here but ya the price is more like 
$10.00US a case which is what 12 beer (not beerS) are often reffered to here 
in Canada. A US case(24) of cans is often a flat, since it comes on a 
cardbord tray but this is changing since the invasion of Budmiller.

Subject: O2 Pressuring.


Brewbunch, 
 
With all the talk about CO2 pressurized 2nd fermentation/lagering, I 
started thinking..... 
 
I know it's possible (I hear) for yeast to run out of oxygen before running 
out of fermentable sugars in high gravity brews (barleywine, scotch 
heavies, tripplebocks, meads, etc.) even if the wort is saturated with O2 
at the time of pitching (at fermentation temps).  What would happen if one 
waited until "primary" fermentation had slowed down to a crawl or apparent 
end and then siphoned into a corney for further fermentation, then force 
"oxygenated" the keg with an O2 tank instead of a CO2 tank?  After an 
appropriate time for O2 absorption, the pressure could be released and an 
airlock (tube into water filled milk jug-type) affixed.  Cold beer/wort 
means no HSA.  Would the resulting yeast activation percolate out any 
oxygenation taste/staling effect, and yield a fully fermented and tasty 
high alc. brew (assuming the strain of yeast can take high ABV)?  Thoughts? 
 
- -Duff 
 
P.S. -  I don't own a corney or I would've tried it and reported the outcome.

Subject: Mash thickness


Top of the afternoon to ye all, 
 
According to Principles of Brewing Science mash thickness varies between 
67 kg/hl to 29 kg/hl or about 1.39 pounds per quart to 0.60 pounds per 
quart.  A. J. I would guess that your mash was about 0.50 pounds per 
quart which is on the thin side. 
 
For most German style beers I dough in with  24 oz of cold water (59F) 
per pound of malt after a short rest I infuse with 12 oz of boiling water 
to bring me to acid rest temperature of 95F which is held for about 25 
min depending on the malt.  I then pull a decoction of 35% of the mash, 
taking mostly grain and step that through 122F with a short rest.  Step 
the decoction to 150F with about a 15 min. rest then slowly raise the 
temperature to boiling then boil the decoction for 20 min. covered. 
 
I then dough the decoction back into the main mash to raise the 
temperature to 122F hold that for 15 min. then pull another decoction of 
45% again taking mostly grain and step that to 150F hold for 15 min then 
raise the temperature slowly to boiling and boil the decoction for about 
15 min uncovered. 
 
I dough this last decoction back into the main mash and raise the 
temperature up to around  150F depending on style and allow the mash to 
rest for about an hour to 90 min.  I then directly heat the main mash to 
168F for mash out and go to lautering. 
 
Even starting with a fairly thick or based on PBS slightly more then 
average thickness,  the mash when it goes into the lauter tun is quite 
liquid and I have no difficulty forming a filter bed. 
 
To have an easy time of doing the decoction mashes you have to be able to 
control the heat under the decoction as well as having a good decoction 
kettle.  It is very difficult to do a decoction in a cheap stock kettle 
that doesn't have a flat bottom and is hardly thicker then aluminum foil.
