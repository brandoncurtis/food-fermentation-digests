I racked an ale of mine to secondary 5 weeks ago and it is still 
fermenting. It dropped from 1.02 to 1.012 in the last 2 weeks, but 
is still bubbling away. I used Tames Valley Wyeast (Im not sure of the #). 
Does anyone have any idea why this is taking so long. Thanks.

Tim Martin asks about 100% Vienna/Munich beers.  You would benefit from 
learning to read a malt analysis.  There are some really good articles, 
I have referred to before, in the 1995 Special issue of Zymurgy.  There 
is also an article on Malt.  If my memory serves me correctly, Vienna 
still has some diastatic power, while Munich is low or nil, however, I 
don't use only Vienna or Munich for the reason you stated, and also a 
second reason.  Using those malts solely will result in a new style of 
beer, or one that I haven't yet found a profile for.

Bob Tisdale asks about gravity of rasberries.  Wow, this is unaswerable 
in it's present form.  How much rasberries did you add to what medium 
and what was your method of extraction, just to ask a couple 
questions.  It seems to me that just adding them whole to the secondary 
or primary would be the hardest way of figuring extraction.  It would 
depend on how much sugar was actually present in the berries, etc.  If 
you use a process, as I had, you could then use your hydrometer to 
measure the extraction.  See HBD 2181 and 2182 for details.

A lot of breweries do run rakes during the mash.  Also, I visited 7 or 8 
breweries in the UK and asked each one of them.  What the brewmasters 
said was that they never run the rakes during the sparge, only running 
them to expel the spent grains (and maybe just after putting in the mash 
to smooth the level of the grain bed out?).  If you look in The Biotechnology 
of Malting and Brewing by J.S.Hough (I have posted about this before, so 
you can search for it), you will see that Hough notes that running the 
rakes is primarily a German practice and is used because the bouyancy of 
the grain is lost during the decoctions (infusion mashed grains are far 
more bouyant than decoction mashed grains).  On the other hand, I know 
that Chicago Brewing Company infusion mashes but they run their rakes 
during the sparge (5 min out of every 30, I believe, except for the 
wheat which is too gummy to stop the rakes (they won't restart)).  Note 
also that they are using a mash/lauter tun of German design. 
 
What I was refering to as a "concensus" was a long, drawn-out discussion 
which ended with Charlie Scandrett (in HBD #1984) quoting my post (in which 
I suggest (in an attempt to draw closure to a long battle) that if the 
stirring were constant, raking would reduce channeling and occasional 
raking would increase it) and (in my mind) resolving the issue as best 
as we could do without exprerimentation.  I respect Charlie's knowledge 
very much and this is perhaps I recall it as a concensus. 
 
If you go to this URL: 
 
http://nemesis.engin.umich.edu:8080/Beer/Threads/Threads/thread.841953869.html 
 
you will find all the discussions about channeling in 1996 HBDs PRIOR to 
this most recent thread. 
 
I have never ever, in well over 100 all-grain batches, had a set mash 
(aka stuck sparge -- I did have a slow sparge (3hrs) on a 43% rye batch, 
but that's a different story), have never knifed or raked my grain bed and 
have gotten between 28 and 31 pts/lb/gal on virtually all my batches. 
The several times I did disturb the grain bed was because I over-eagerly 
dumped the recirculation runnings back into the top of the grain bed. 
Frankly, I wish I had a few set mashes so I could learn what the heck it 
is that causes them.  I suspect too fine a crush, using high-beta-glucan or 
high-protein grains without the corresponding rests, too cold a grain bed 
or not enough difference between the top of the mash and the top of the level 
of the runnings in the kettle.  Perhaps I'll have to try a couple of these 
things and see if I can get that EasyMasher(tm) to stick!  I also said that 
I'm going to test and see if I have channeling in my grain bed or not. 
 
Guy writes (regarding my measuring the SG before and after raking method 
of determining if there is channeling or not):

>channeling effect.  The gravity issue is a reflection of this, as "faster 
>flow extracts less stuff". 
 
Let me explain my thinking: I believe that if there is channeling, there 
will be pockets of mash in which there are stagnant or almost stagnant 
runnings.  Let's say you draw off a quart of runnings, halfway through the 
laeuter and they are 1.020. Then you stop the runnings, stir, recirculate, 
take another quart sample and measure the SG.  If they are 1.020, then  you 
didn't have channeling.  If they are 1.022, then you disturbed some stagnant 
areas (with their higher extract) and the "rivers" of sparge water flowing 
through the channels were traveling around them.  Does that make more 
sense?  I think my basis in the initial explanation may have been unclear. 
 
What do we do if we do find that we are having a lot of channeling?  Well, 
if we're talking about 2 points difference, I would simply sparge a little 
slower.  The sugar in the areas of higher concentration will have more 
opportunity to diffuse into the areas of lower concentration.  If the 
difference is like 5+ points, then I would assess my lauter tun design 
and if I was unwilling to change that, I would probably make a habit of 
stopping/stirring/recirculating/restarting two or three times during the 
laeuter.

Hi All 
 
I have a jet style burner cajun cooker and would like to put a ring style 
burner on it, I know I will lose some BTU's but who need 200,000 anyway. 
What I need to know is where I can find ring type burners, can I just use 
the ones you see on the side of gas grills all the time or do I need 
something more heavy duty.  Any input would be appreciated.

I recently tried this yeast (Thames Valley Wyeast) and found that although 
I had a good starter and a good amount of air in the chilled wort, initial 
fermentation to my 6 gallon batch seemed sluggish to kick in. 
 
I didn't get a good hearty bubbling in the air-lock for about 26 hours... I 
can't remember the last time a I had a fermentation that didn't start 
within 4-6 hours. 
 
Anybody out there tried this yeast??? Experiences? Problems???

I would also like to add that it would be a good idea to first try this on 
a small portion of the beer.  If your primary yeast was (basically) killed 
by the alcohol, you may still have quite a bit of residual sugar in the 
beer and adding a more alcohol-tolerant yeast would result in gushers. 
Judging from your OG and FG, I don't think this would be a problem in your 
case. 
 
Adding more of the same yeast you fermented with is not as foolish an idea 
as it may initially sound.  Belgian brewers do this regularly with their 
strong ales (well, that's most Belgian ales, actually).  The basis for this 
is that the fermentation yeast can be pretty pooped out after all that 
fermentation and swimming in alcohol.  I had a 9%ABV Barleywine that took 
six months to get a decent carbonation (I did not add yeast at bottling 
time), but it was very harsh all those months too.  Barleywines need to 
age for mellowing, not just conditioning.

Oh, oh... I hear you all sigh...  Dave and Al discussing mash temps.  Before 
we begin, Dave, if you disagree with me, let's take this off-line much 
earlier than last time, okay? 
 
To get better head and more body, eliminate the 122F rest and do your protein 
rest (if you must) at 135-140F.  The 122F rest is where peptidase is most 
active (any higher and it begins to denature much faster).  Peptidase cuts 
big proteins into amino acids.  In the 135 to 140F range, peptidase denatures 
quickly and protease (actually, I think it's a number of proteases) cuts big 
proteins down into medium-sized proteins.  It's these medium-sized proteins 
that give you head retention and (according to a discussion with George Fix 
from about 1989 that I posted to HBD at least once) most of the body 
(more than the dextrins, which are a significant factor too).  If you allow 
peptidase to turn all your proteins into amino acids, your beer will be 
lacking in body and head retention. 
 
Q: Why does virtually every all-grain recipe contain a 122F rest? 
 
A: Habit and a lack of understanding.  In an all-malt beer, you will 
have more than enough amino acids for yeast nutrition without a 122F 
rest.  If you do happen to get your hands on a sack of malt that the 
brewers of Pilsner Urquell use, you may want to consider adding a 122F 
rest and also you may want to do a triple decoction, but with modern, 
well-modified malts, the 122F is absolutely unnecessary.

Ken Schwarz asks for a translation of my tag. Happy to oblige: "Never in 
doubt [though] frequently in error." The manager of a large government 
project I once worked on made this the motto of his division going so far 
as to have baseball caps made up using this as the basis for a logo showing 
interlocked arrows pointing simultaneously up and down. He claimed it was 
the motto of the medical profession (MD's please don't take offense) but I 
really have no idea where he got it. I will leave it to you, gentle 
readers, to decide whether it is a suitable tag for the Net.

Duff Hickman asked about what would happen if a beer were pressurized with 
O2 during the fermentation. The yeast would resume the growth phase with 
the production of growth phase metabolic products (lots of esters and 
acids) which would, in most cases, spoil the beer. To get an idea about 
this repeatedly oxygenate/aerate a starter which you are growing. By 
repeatedly I mean every couple of hours. After a day or so of this 
treatment you should have a lot of yeast. Now decant and taste some of the 
supernatant. Class dismissed.

Mark Preston asked about magnesium levels in beer. It reportedly takes 
about 120 mg/L to send you to the dunny with beers ranging from 60 - 200 
mg/l in Britain and 75 - 240 mg/L in German beers. Some natural brewing 
waters contain fair amounts of magnesium (Burton, Edinburgh,Vienna all in 
the 60's) and some do not (Plzen - 2 mg/L) and the malt supplies some. 
Brewers often use Epsom salts to augment the sulfate content of their beer 
but usually avoid going over 30 ppm because of the sour bitterness 
associated with Mg above this level. The symptoms described sound more like 
a reaction to yeast or the flu.

Well, I try to honestly address both the pros and the cons in my RIMS

cost, although I do try to address a few other minor ones too, such

idea of writing a web page & program (CGI) combo that can be used to 
spam the spammers.  Basically, what I'm thinking of is a web page 
that you can enter the spammer's email address in the form and with 
the press of a button automatically subscribe them to every known 
email discussion group on the 'net (or at least a bunch!).  This may 
be a crazy knee-jerk reaction on my part to recent spams in the HBD, 
so I'm soliciting rational feedback as to whether this is a do-able 
idea or not. Please email me with your concerns and comments. 
Thanks!

Subject: Re: Copper in Beer


I know I was very concerned about this, as cooking copper is tin-lined to 
prevent copper poisoning.  (Yes, I know it is safe for some types of 
foods, but not for your sauce pans.) 
 
Anyway, someone pointed me to an article that cited a study that showed 
the amounts of copper *post-fermentation* to be negligible.  The 
prevailing theory at the time was that the yeast used the copper or at 
least absorbed it. 
 
I am too lazy/busy to find the Zymurgy or HBD or whatever article from 
five or six years ago, but maybe someone else can cite it or the original 
research.

Sorry to be so misleading.  What I should have said, was:  I always 
do my mashing in my combination mash tun / boiling kettle (I use the 
same 10-gallon kettle for mashing and boiling).  You were 
on the right track:  first, I mash in the kettle, then transfer to 
the Gott for lautering.  While it sits and settles for a few minutes, 
I clean the mash tun out, and then use it to collect the sparge 
runoff.  Once the sparge is done, I put it on the burner, and the 
rest of the brew looks like the extract brews you've been doing, 
boiling and adding hops as called for.  I don't think HSA is a 
problem, since I "gently" scoop the mash up with a bucket and pour it 
into the cooler/lauter tun.  I avoid heavy splashing, but I don't 
treat it like an explosive either...  Most importantly, I've never 
detected stale/oxidized flavors in my beer.

Subject: professionals in amateur homebrew competitions


The annual Ausbeer nationwide homebrew competition is almost on us over 
here again. 
 
It has come to my attention that several people who are professional 
brewers are entering this competition. Of course it is up to the 
organisers who is eligible to enter, but I wondered what the HBD 
concensus is on the spirit of this practice. Are professionals excluded 
from the AHA (or other) competitions? Who constitutes a professional? Is 
it OK for professionals using "amateur" gear to enter? What is "amateur" 
gear? Many "amateurs" have very sophisticated pilot plants. Should they 
be ineligible? Is a professional one who has professional 
qualifications, or must they be actively brewing in a 
microbrewery/brewpub? 
 
Or should it be left to the individual's own conscience? 
Why would a professional want to enter an amateur competition anyway? It 
seems they'd have everything to lose and nothing to gain. They'd be 
expected to win, so what happens if they lose? Do they blame the judges, 
or themselves? 
 
I feel this should be publically discussed.

Subject: Reviews we can taste -ATTENTION BEER JUDGES


 
======================================================================= 
As I read other people's reviews of various brews, I think I know what 
tastes and flavors they're describing, but since I've never participated in 
a beer judging program (as a judge) I can't be sure. How about we get two or 
three certified beer judges to post their impressions(?) of some beers that 
we can all buy locally (Sam's ale, lager, Pete's,...others?). That way, I 
can taste while I read and really understand what some of these terms mean. 
Any volunteers? any others interested in these results?If this has been 
done, and maybe posted on somebody's web site (which would be an excellent 
place for it) please clue me in as to where I can find it. 
 
BTW, is anyone else less than impressed with Pete's latest...Wicked Amber 
Ale? To my pallet, it tastes like a Milwaukee's best (a beer that I used to 
drink great quantities of before I got used to the dollar-a-bottle stuff and 
my own homebrew).

Subject: Re: vienna & munich malts


Tim Martin (HBD #2188) asks about the diastatic power of vienna & munich 
malts:  Basically, you should avoid domestic (e.g. Breiss) "vienna" and 
"munich" malts.  They do not have enough enzyme concentration (or 
diastatic power [DP]) to convert themselves, and must be mashed with a 
base malt.  Plus, they are made from inferior 6-row barley.  However, 
the German malts Dr. Fix recommends do indeed have enough DP to convert 
themselves, as do the Belgian malts as well.  I have brewed 100% Munich 
malt beers from both Belgian (DeWolfe Cosyns) and German (Ireks) malts 
without any difficulty.  They also have a much better, IMO, malt flavor 
than the domestic varieties.

Subject: Dealing With Spam


Since spammers spam to save money (email is cheap), the best way to deal 
with them is to make them spend money. You can do this by calling any listed 
800 numbers several times (800 service isn't cheap, no matter what the phone 
co. says) and requesting lots of literature/brochures/demo programs/spec 
sheets, etc. Ask for anything. You don't even need to give them a real 
address, or even a real email address. Just make sure they know you're 
responding because of their email. You can give them the address of another 
spam company (leaving of the other company's name, of course)! I've been 
responding 5-6 times to everything that lists an 800 number, and I also 
respond to the "email only" requests with mis-directed literature requests. 
 
Spam will continue until it becomes too expensive. Marketers know that they 
can only win a small portion of any market using email, so they will never 
refuse to send out collateral to a caller. In fact, even if they know this 
is happening they can't afford not to send it, you might be a legitimate 
customer. It's a marvelous trap, one of those "damned if you do, damned if 
you don't" situations. 
 
Eventually, if enough netizens request junk, the marketers will turn away 
from email because it doesn't return enough business to make it profitable. 
Every piece of junk they send costs them money for production, warehousing, 
mailing, and administration. Not to mention the increased growth in their 
contact databases. When you give them a bogus address, you cost them money 
for the little lines on the envelope that say "address correction required" 
or "return postage guaranteed." And if those lines aren't there, they still 
have costs involving the removal of those bad addresses from their databases. 
 
Making them pay is the only way to stop spammers. 
 
Mike.

Subject: 'Special B' malt


I cast this upon the collective praying for a positive response... 
 
As part of a present I was given a mess of various types of grains and hops 
and sheet of what everything is. 
 
Well,  The sheet has been misplaced/thrown away/kid ate it/etc etc and I have 
one thing I am unsure about. 
 
A 3lb bag of malt (uncrushed) marked 'Special B'.  It's a pretty dark malt. 
I dunno what it is and haven't found any recipes that call specifically for it 
so I
figure it must have another name it goes by. 
 
I'd love to make a batch with it, but I'd like to have a clue what to expect 
when
it's done!-) 
 
If you can tell me what it is I'd be ever so grateful! 
 
 
Thanks!

Subject: Barleywine/Head Space 


I am a new HDB member (3 weeks) and have my first question.  I have brewed my 
first barleywine from a recipe a friend gave me.  This recipe is for 2 
gallons.  My OG was slightly over 1.10.  It has been fermenting for 1 week in 
my 5 gallon carboy with about a 3" foam head covering the entire surface and 
my airlock bubbling about every 1 second.  In speaking with a fellow newbie 
homebrewer, he asked me if I was not worried about head space with only 2 
gallons in a 5 gallon glass carboy.  Should I be worried about this?  Should 
I purchase a 2.3 gallon carboy I found at a local homebrew shop and rack to 
that after the initial fermentation completes?   
 
I searched some threads on barleywine from past HDB posts and found nothing 
concerning head space.  Sorry if this is a re-hashed thread from days gone 
by!   
 
I used WYEAST Scottish Ale yeast on a recommendation from a local homebrew 
store (the recipe just said ale yeast).  I am currently stepping up the same 
Scottish yeast in anticipation of a problem with fermentation.  My question 
is at what gravity should the fermentation be complete vs needing to re-pitch 
another large volume of yeast?  The recipe was 5 lbs of pale extract to make 
2 gallons and my OG was 1.101. 
 
Private e-mails are fine.  Thanks!

The pico-Brewing Systems screen will hold a full kettle of grain 
(about 45 lbs max).  This from personal experience.  (Of course, 
sparging that much grain is a real pain!)
