I just looked this up in the World Almanac (1992, FWIW): 
1 quart, liquid, US = 0.833 British quart 
1 quart, dry   , US = 0.969 British quart 
1 quart, British    = 1.201 US liquid quarts 
1   "       "       = 1.032 US dry quarts 
 
>I believe 1 US gallon = 4/5 Imperial gallon.  Do I just multiply the

4/5 = 0.800 
5/4 = 1.250 
Sounds like that's a good rule for estimating, but for actual conversions 
I would use the Almanac's numbers, IMHO.  Just to refresh everyone on the 
math, (I'm not being condescending, I had to pull out the calculator to 
make sure _I_ was doing it correctly...conversions are confusing.) 
 
USgal * 0.833 = Imperialgal 
Imperialgal * 1.201 = USgal

Subject: Spruce Beer / RIMS Issues / Berry Little Gravity


John Penn pines about spruce beer: 
 
"I can't imagine spruce being used to "bitter" those "Badger beers" but it is 
a strong flavor" 
 
Strong indeed.   I have the dubious honor of cold-storing a couple bottles of 
spruce porter "accidentally" left behind by one of our club members who moved 
away (thanks a lot, Fred).  It was a favorite thing for him to do, to whip 
out a bottle and watch everyone scramble to fill their mugs with "anything 
else" before Fred could offer a Taste of the Woods.  At first this stuff was 
wickedly overpowering, but I recently sampled one of the bottles (going on 
two years old) and found it quite drinkable, albeit still only in small 
quantities.  I'd have to agree with Mr Penn that perhaps 1/2 ounce of the 
extract is more appropriate than the 1-ounce called for by CP.  But do give 
it time.  Euell Gibbons would be right proud, son. 
 
***** 
 
Daryl K Kalenchuk wants to build a RIMS: 
 
"haven't run across the disadvantages (there must be a couple) other than 
cost and building time." 
 
I'm in the process of RIMSifying my setup, and I can offer one thought. 
 Check out all the many splendid RIMS pages that have been advertised here 
and at The Brewery in recent times, to see how others have done it.  I found 
that the seemingly simple task of piggybacking a RIMS chamber and pump to my 
beverage-cooler mash-tun is a major undertaking of plumbing and goofy 
fittings.  Between trying to make it as disassmble-able as possible to 
facilitate cleaning and figuring out something as simple as how to mount the 
damn thing without rebuilding my garage, it's a lot more effort than it seems 
up front.  That's the "hidden" disadvantage -- planning & design. 
 "Everything looks good on paper".  Plan way ahead. 
 
***** 
 
Bob Tisdale asks about gravity contribution of fruit: 
 
"Can someone tell me how much 1 lb of raspberries contributes to original 
gravity?" 
 
Being in the middle of a cherry porter session, I've looked into this issue 
myself.  Every fruit has a certain percentage of sugar (there's a great chart 
of sugar contents of fruits at The Brewery).  Cherries for example contain 
14%.  I used 6 lb of cherries so that's equivalent to adding 0.84 lb of 
sugar.  Now wave the magic wand and make some unfounded assumptions about the 
fermentabiliy of this sugar, and I find that 6 lb cherries in 5 gal of porter 
add less than 1% alcohol.  This is somewhere around 1 point of OG per pound 
per gallon -- not enough to even worry about (after all that worrying).  What 
about any contribution from other components of the fruit?  Don't know, but 
probably negligible too. 
 
Bottom line:  use the fruit for flavor and forget the extra math.  The amount 
of added gravity and alcohol is lost in the recipe-formulation noise.  Of 
course, if you're using LOTS of fruit, you may have to start taking things 
into account, but that's probably a question for the Whine and Cheese forum.

Here are the results of the 4th Annual Peach State Brewoff, sorry this 
took so long but the computer system at Emory University SUCKS.As you can 
see we broke out subcategories and combined categories;there were 260+ 
entries and ribbons awarded in 21 categories.The comic highlight of the 
competition was when Dave Miller found an evil looking bee/fly hybrid in a 
beer he was supposed to judge, he called for another bottle,and awarded 
second place to that beer. The flyhopped entry was made by the organizer.

Remove the airstat for the lager stage. Airstats are for keeping the fridge

 I am worried that this yeast comb is very very bad idea... Being that the

My .02 is, if they do it at home and with their own equipment, however 
(un)sophisticated, it's homebrew and may be entered. There is much more to 
brewing commercially, and although they may be more knowledgable than the rest 
of us novices, they are still homebrewers too. HOWEVER, if they are entering 
beers that were made with equipment that they use to produce beer commercially,
like brewing/fermenting thier beer at the local brewpub, then this should be 
disqualified, because it' snot HOMEbrew any more.

Wallie Meisner suggests that we start a BJCP style judging forum.  I 
think this a very worthwile effort.  I for one would like to 
participate, and I know others who would.  Our club, The North Texas 
Home Brewers Association, Inc., is engauged in such a process.  We are 
holding BJCP study sessions, and will offer the BJCP exam in March, at 
the Bluebonnet Brewoff Homebrew Competition.

Subject: RE:  BBC Longshot contest


     Howdy! 
 
     I was a judge at this year's BBC contest, and a contestant last year. 
     In view of the recent posts, I would like to add my humble views about 
     this, and all contests. 
 
     First, Kit complains that one judge (Noonan, no less) gave his beer a 
     40 while the other two judges gave it a score in the low 20's. 
     Really?  What was Noonan thinking?  As the "ranking" judge, he should 
     have questioned the lower scores.  It is usually understood that if 
     the judges' scores are within 6 points of each other, the judging was 
     reasonable.  If they differ widely, some (sometimes intense) 
     discussion should follow.  From Kit's description, it sounds like the 
     "low" judges didn't know the style. 
 
     Wayne complains that his stout scored poorly.  Did you enter it into 
     any other contests?  This could either validate or refute the BBC 
     judges' scores.  Keep in mind that judging is VERY subjective; 
     everyone has different sensitivities to different aromas/flavors. 
 
     The judges comments should be constructive, to help you improve as a 
     brewer.  It sounds like the comments you got may have been a bit 
     harsh. 
 
     Also, how did you ship your beer?  One BIG problem I have with the BBC 
     and AHA is that their contests were held during the hot summer months. 
     I shipped my second round beers to New Orleans overnight, the day 
     before the deadline (at great expense), to minimize the risk of them 
     sitting in a 100F+ UPS warehouse.  A lot can happen to your beer on a 
     cross-country journey!  Bugs that may have been somewhat dormant in 
     your beer (if you store it cool) may have been aroused by the heat and 
     went about their nasty business. 
 
     Overall, the beers I judged at the BBC were quite poor.  I also know 
     that they only got half the entries of the first year (~800).  I also 
     believe (just my opinion, no evidence) that the finalists chosen by 
     Jim Koch and friends are chosen because he wants to MARKET that style 
     this year.  The California Common beer that went to the finals wasn't 
     great (I judged it, mid-thirties, which was high enough to send it to 
     the round that J.K. judged). 
 
     There was also another problem at this contest: mis-entered beers. 
     Let's go back in time, to last year's BBC contest.  I entered a very 
     nice Bavarian Weizen.  It had done well at regional events, etc.  When 
     I got my score sheets back from BBC I was shocked to see a score in 
     the mid-twenties.  I read the comments, "Banana, clove, malty.  Would 
     make a good Bavarian Weizen." 
 
     "WHAT?" I thought to myself.  "It IS a Bavarian Weizen!"  I looked at 
     the top of the sheet, and sure enough, the beer was NOT entered into 
     the proper category.  It was put into the Berliner Weisse category!  I 
     know this was not my mistake, because I've never brewed a Berliner 
     Weisse, and I only entered one beer! 
 
     At this years' contest, I judged Cream ales (somebody's got to do it). 
     The three beers I liked best were NOT cream ales (and therefore 
     received low scores).  I don't know if the contestants or the 
     organizers were to blame in these cases, but I know who was at fault 
     in my case last year! 
 
     So, to summarize all this, take contests with a grain of salt.  If you 
     and your friends like your beer, then you're doing well.  If you want 
     more educated critiques, enter contests, but keep in mind that beer 
     judging is the most subjective job on the planet.  If you consistently 
     get the same comments, then take them to heart, good or bad.  You 
     can't safely accept the results of one judging, because you can never 
     be sure of the quality of the judges. 
 
     My Maerzen scored in the low 20's  at a small contest just weeks 
     before winning the Nationals; keep in mind that those same judges 
     awarded some other Maerzen first place!  I'm sure that beer missed the 
     style because the judges didn't know the style, but that person 
     probably thought that the AHA national judges were poor because they 
     gave the beer a low score after it won this other contest!  My point 
     is, even comments that are positive could be wrong.  Take it all for 
     what it's worth. 
 
     Sorry this is so long, Have Fun!

Subject: Grain alcohol as a sanitizer / Lagering in a corny


     Hello again! 
 
     This one's short... 
 
     Tim mentions using 100% ethanol as a sanitizer.  Ethanol is most 
     effective when it is diluted with water to a strength of 70%.  It is 
     better at denaturing proteins at this concentration. 
     --------------------- 
     Guy wrote about lagering in a corny.  Actually, the way you do it is 
     fine, Guy.  I wrote, and still maintain, that it is easiest to lager 
     in a vented secondary (i.e., one with an airlock) so that the 
     undesirable volatiles can escape.  Once the beer smells clean (devoid 
     of sulfur notes) it can be sealed in a keg. 
 
     It is possible to vent a sealed keg periodically to purge the 
     undesirable aromas, but it's less labor intensive to just let it sit 
     in a vented container (in fact, no effort on the brewer's part). 
 
     Have Fun!

Special B is... well, Special B. I'm not aware of any other malt like it. It 
is essentially a very dark crystal malt (around 250L). Somewhere in the grey 
area between a "normal" crystal malt, and chocolate malt I guess. I really 
like this stuff; lately, I've been adding a few ounces of it to many of my 
dark ales, in addition to the other specialty grains. Excellent in Porters, 
IMO. 
 
I've started playing around with some of the other specialty malts from 
DeWolf-Cosyns (the people who make Special B) as well. They have some unusual 
malts ("Aromatic" and "Biscuit") that I'm just starting to experiment with...

I ferment both primary and secondary exclusively in corny kegs.  I use 
"pressure oxygenation" at the beginning of the fermentation cycle 
through a carbonation stone (SS sintered 2 micron holes) and have had 
wonderful results.  However, your notion of oxygenation when the yeast 
have already entered their anaerobic phase worries me.  This question 
I think is better addressed by someone with a better knowledge of 
yeast biology, but I think that your idea would be very bad for the 
yeast and the resulting beer. 
 
If you are interested in learning how to force oxygenate beer wort in 
a corny keg, see my article in the Sep/Oct 1995 issue of Brewing 
Techniques on page 32.

Flour generated can get into the air and cause an explosion (one small

I am interested in using a bubblestone to oxygenate the wort of my next ale. I 
seem to recall there was a way to put a piece of cotton soaked with rubbing 
alcohol in the airline to act as a "bacteria trap" to keep the beasties from 
getting to the wort before my yeasties. Since none of the airpumps I saw had an
"in" line that could be filtered in this fashion, I assume I would have to 
filter it somewhere along the "out" line. Is there an easy, cheap way to do 
this?

Andy raises a some good points.  Since I know nearly all the 
professional brewers here in San Diego, I don't have a problem with a 
professional entering a beer that has been brewed on a home system. 
Most of these brewers started out as home brewers and when they brew 
on a professional system, this is *not* an advantage.  They must brew 
to make money, and generally, this means a limited number of recipes 
made a large number of times.  They do not have the opportunity to 
innovate as much as homebrewers do with 5 gallon batches.  Would you 
want to take chances with the money represented by 300 gallons of 
beer? 
 
On top of that, if they take a recipe they have perfected on a 10 
barrel system down to a 5 gallon system, then the whole ball game gets 
redefined.  They will most likely not be able to duplicate the recipe 
the first time due to changes in behavior with volume of ingredients. 
Almost like starting over with a new recipe.

I'm trying to get a better handle on the use of flaked grains and the

flaw, as I see it is its lack of head.  With flaked grains, be they 
rye, wheat, or barley, do they need the 122^F rest?  If so how long? 
Did the long 122^F rest kill the head?  Got caught haveing to play

i think the culprit malt was actually victory malt (not sure what style that

enzymes, albeit not nearly as many as pils malt.  way less, so be careful and

Why 3 days.  I say, wait an hour and then serve.  The only reason for 
waiting that hour is that the beer will tend to foam too much at first. 
Years ago, there was a long discussion about why shaking a bottle or 
can of beer made it gush.  There were people who said the pressure 
rose when you shook the container... no way!  I believe that someone 
finally posted that the shaking of the beer causes eddys which provide 
nucleation sites.  If you open the bottle/can/keg while these are still 
numerous, the CO2 will come out of solution too rapidly.

Let's not forget that this is the same Dave Miller who wrote in "Dave

priming sugars quickly and then take weeks to dissolve into the beer. 
 
*** 
John posted an "Authentic" Pilsner triple-decoction mash schedule. 
Times and temperatures seemed reasonable to me but I have one question 
and two comments. 
 
Q: Is this *THE* mash schedule (times and temps) for some well-known beer 
or is it *A* triple-decoction mash you have found to work. 
 
Comment 1: depending on how fast you transfer, your altitude and other 
factors such as how well insulated your mash tun is (i.e. how much temperature 
drop there is) you may need to remove more than 1/3 of your mash for 
the decoctions.  In my experience, I had to take about 1/2 of the mash to 
raise the rest mash from 135F to 155F. 
 
Comment 2: To do the mash out, traditionally the runnings are taken from 
the mash tun (no grain in this decoction) and they are heated to boiling 
and returned to the rest mash to raise to mashout.  The reason you don't 
want to take any grains during this final decoction is because if you do, 
the boiling may release some unconverted starch.  When you return to the 
main mash, this starch will have no enzymes to convert it unlike the other 
decoctions did.

If this is not a typo, then it is incorrect.  Pectin is added if you 
want to make jelly, not beer.  The pectin will cause a permanent haze 
in the beer.  If it is a typo and "pectic enzyme" was meant, again, I 
don't think this is right.  I suspect that the pectic enzyme would be 
denatured in minutes at 170F.  Pectic enzyme is said to denature in 
a few days at 68F and therefore must be kept refrigerated.

Here's what I did for my recent fruit beers.  I froze then pasteurized the 
raspberries and froze then blanched the cherries and blueberries.  For the 
raspberries, I heated them to between 140 and 150F for 10 minutes (a double 
boilier helps).  Then I purged a carboy with CO2 while the berries cooled 
a bit and poured the warm berry soup into it.  For the cherries and 
blueberries, I dipped them into boiling water for a few seconds with a 
strainer to kill off whatever might be on the skins and them mushed them 
into the CO2-purged fermenter.  Finished beer was siphoned from a large 
primary into the fruit-filled secondaries.

I have used both of these yeasts.  The #3056 needs to be fresh to give you 
any Weizen-like cloveyness.  The #3068 gives both banana and clove... the 
warmer you ferment, the more the balance swings towards the banana.  If you 
like Pschorr-Brau's Weizen, you want the #3068.  If you want something less 
banana-full, like Tucher Weizen, get some fresh #3056 (maybe a problem in 
Tasmania?).

The above is totally incorrect!  both German Vienna  Munich malts have

Yes if you use Vienna by itself you will have a totally different beer a 
Vienna.  It seems like I have seen that somewhere before.  George Fix 
wrote a book about that style.  Gee if i use all Munich malt I would get 
a Munich or perhaps a dunkle if I added a touch of dark malts.  Wild and 
crazy new styles. 
 
 
I have brewed a beer with all Briess Munich malt and it did just fine. 
There were enough enzymes to convert. But as this grain was six row there 
is a lot of husk material and a bit of astringency.

i think it is.  others don't think so.  we need an A/B comparison this fall, 
i believe.  certainly if you think hsa is an issue, you should be careful 
when moving hot mash/wort to prevent excessive aeration.  if you don't think 
it's an issue, relax etc. (but wait 6 months and try your beer) 
 
> Aren't you going to lauter 
>out your wort, and then re-boil and add hops? 
 
yes, but once melanoidins are oxidized, they can't be "un"-oxidized.  boiling 
de-oxygenates the wort, but it doesn't "un"-oxidize melanoidins.  somebody 
with a chemistry degree, jump in here. 
 
unoxidized melanoidins can be beneficial later, after fermentation, in 
preserving the stability of your beer, by helping to prevent oxidized flavors 
that result from post fermentative handling (aeration during bottling, etc.) 
 
a very recent issue contained a submission that covered this particular point 
exceptionally well.

i think i remember reading that some breweries do this (oxygenate wort while 
it's fermenting) for high gravity styles. but they may be doing it very early 
in the ferment, to get the yeast off to a bigger start.  the above seems risky 
to me since you may overshoot by a large amount and end up with a lot of free 
dissolved oxygen in the beer.  this is roughly the equivalent of aerating the 
beer after fermentation. 
 
what would the yeast use the oxygen for at a late stage of fermentation? i 
thought the reason yeast needs oxygen before fermentation is for reproduction. 
if your cell count is high enough, what other use for oxygen is there?  do 
you need reproduction no matter what the cell count for a healthy ferment? 
are "younger" yeasts more vigorous?  would introducing oxygen very late in 
a high gravity beer produce more "young" yeast cells and invigorate the 
ferment?  do the yeast sense the sudden change in oxygen level and immediately 
start reproducing again at such a late stage in the ferment? 
 
 
the hot side isn't the only place you want to avoid aeration.  aerating beer 
post ferment during racking or bottling can lead to oxidized flavors and more 
rapid staling.
