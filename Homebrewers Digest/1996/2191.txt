Subject: RE: Pro's homebrewing


     Andy Walsh wonders if pro brewers should be allowed to compete in 
     homebrew competitions.  He also wonders about the definition of a 
     "pro."  Perhaps it's better to ask what defines a "homebrewer." 
 
     I know that Eric Warner won the AHA Nationals Wheat beer category a 
     couple of years back.  Was that fair?  He used an open aluminum 
     fermenter.  He learned his stuff at Weihenstephan.  He's a pro (makes 
     money making beer).  If he brewed his winner at home, with equipment 
     used only at home, I'd say he's a homebrewer, and that makes it fair. 
 
     We all have access to a lot of info about the chemistry and techniques 
     of brewing.  It's up to us if we seek it out and utilize it to make 
     the best possible beer. 
 
     Just my opinion. 
 
     But should people using "Brew on premises" be allowed to enter 
     homebrew comps? 
 
     Have Fun!

 Is the entry fee $5?  There is also shipping cost, unless you can drop 
 them off personally.  It is probably a good public relations campaign 
 for Boston Brewing Co., no?  Wholesale cost of domestic hops is about 
 $5-7/lb. and certainly EKGs (is that what they're sending out?) are 
 a little more, *but* BBC is buying in huge volume.  Plus their 
 T-shirts' are good advertising. 
 
 So what does it cost to develop a new beer from a recipe prespective? 
 Is BBC actually saving R&D cost by paying out cash to Longshot 
 winners? 
 
 Cheers,

Dextrins are unfermentable by brewer's yeast whether maltose is present or not.

Why a lager yeast unless you want to make a lager?  This sounds like you 
should use lager yeast if you want to make a stronger beer (which is 
incorrect), doesn't it?

I fixed the problem with my EM by filing the nozzle (a lot) till it was 
cylindrical (rather than tapering as it is originally).  Then I slipped 
the 5/16" ID tubing over the nozzle, wrapped two turns of duct tape 
over the tubing and then cranked down a SS hose clamp over the duct 
tape.  The purpose of the tape is to prevent the hose from squishing 
through the drive holes in the hose clamp when the tun heats up.  Just 
for security, I used some string to tie the hose clamp up behind the 
valve handle to prevent this whole thing from slipping off at some 
inappropriate time.  Involved, but works for me.

I recommend you try to avoid aerating the sweet wort.  I'll bet that if 
you were to compare the same recipe done with and without aeration, you 
will notice the difference.  I was taught a lot of bad techniques early 
in my brewing and thought my beer tasted fine.  It wasn't until I started 
fixing them one by one, that my beer began to improve and approach 
the quality of high-quality commercial beers.

If you are just removing calcium deposits, then fine, but if you are 
also removing the oxide coating from the Stainless Steel or Aluminum, 
you can get some strong metallic flavours in your beer till the oxide 
layer re-forms.  I use a ScotchBrite(tm) pad that is made specifically 
for SilverStone(tm).  It is plastic and does not scratch the oxide 
layer off.

Hogwa... er... I disagree.  Billions of gallons of beer has been 
made in copper kettles and mash tuns.  I've been using a copper 
wort chiller for more than 150 batches of beer and it keeps going 
in sort-of tarnished and comes out a little less tarnished (not 
shiny bright, however).  Yeast consume copper, I know that... how 
much, I'm not sure, but I've never had a problem with any of my 
beers that can be attributed to copper.

Subject: Some new stuff


Tried some new things this past week and I thought 
I'd share.. 
 
First, I tried a new thing with my yeast starter. 
I found myself with only lemon-scented bleach at 
my girlfriend's apartment but I needed to do a 
starter.  I really didn't want to sanitize my 
3 liter wine jug with the lemon bleach because I 
thought I remembered reading something about that 
not being a good idea.  So, I just boiled up my 
starter wort in a pot, chilled in the sink, and 
pitched right into the pot.  How simple.  I wish 
I would have thought of this before.  Why screw 
around with bleach if you don't need to??? It's 
like a mini open fermenter. 
 
I also tried eliminating the use of hop bags by 
installing my EASYMASHER (tm) in my 15 gal. pot 
so I could strain the wort through the hops. 
This did not work as well as I thought it would. 
The wort would flow out pretty good for a while 
but then the EM would get clogged up pretty good 
and I had to get in there with a spoon and push 
the hops away from the screen so the flow would speed 
up.  It basically was a nightmare and I don't know 
if I'll try this again.  If I do, I'll fix the EM 
so that it's not resting on the bottom of the pot. 
This might help but I'm not sure there is much 
advantage to this method anyway... 
 
I also tried a new sparging method.  Instead of 
storing the sparge water in a bottling bucket and 
letting it slowly trickle out into the mash tun, 
I tried doing "batch sparging" by heating up about 
3 gallons of sparge water at a time and just dumping 
into a small pot resting on top of the mash.  This 
method worked great as far as I'm concerned.  The pot 
on top prevents the grain bed from getting all swished 
around and it's easy to keep the sparge water at the 
right temp because you heat it up incrementally.  I 
like it!!

I was wondering why with over 3800 members the HBD users haven't 
considered getting together to for a non-profit buying co-operative for 
home brew supplies such as grain, hops, carboys, equipment and extracts 
etc ? Surely with such a large group we could negotiate significant 
discounts with suppliers ? Any thoughts / comments ?

If you set up your system right (proper length of proper diameter hose 
for a given pressure) you should be able to dispense at the same pressure 
as that with which you carbonated.  This way, the beer is always ready 
to be served and always properly carbonated.  The key is setting the 
pressure right (from Alan's great tables) and then having long-enough and 
small-enough hoses to drop all that pressure.  If you still have foam, 
try a narrower or longer hose.  I use a 6- to 8-foot length of 3/16" ID 
beer line for my beers served at 50F.

You would get oxidized beer.  Yeast don't "run out" of oxygen.  They 
absorb the oxygen from the wort within a few hours of pitching.  They use 
this oxygen to build cell membranes.  If there is insufficient oxygen 
at pitching time, the yeast will have weak cell membranes and therefore 
poor alcohol tolerance.  There is a relationship between oxygen needs and 
high-gravity worts/musts, but the oxygen needs to be added before any 
alcohol is created.  Adding oxygen during the violent fermentation will 
increase diacetyl production (try Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale).  Adding 
oxygen when the fermentation is over or almost over will only oxidize the 
alcohols into aldehydes (yuk!) and wipe out any aroma you may have gotten 
from late kettle hops.

Can someone give me the specifications on the MaltMill (TM) - what length

what are the bearings/bushings made of ? What is the gap between the 
rollers ? Are the rollers smooth ? Are both rollers driven or just one ? 
Is the mill gear driven and if so do the gears change the speed at which

Subject: sparge techinques


Hi, 
 
I have a question about sparging technique about which I'm hoping you 
might be able to provide some feedback. 
 
First, some background... 
A few batches ago I began experimenting with partial mashes.  I've got a 4 
gallon (which really holds 3.5 gals) stainless steel pot that I use as a 
mash tun.  For now, I've just been mashing at around 150-153 degrees for 
about an hour.  For sparging, I insert a plastic bucket with holes inside my 
bottling bucket.  I wrap a blanket around it to try to retain some heat. 
I add some foundation water and then, to avoid splashing, I scoop the mash 
from the pot with a small pitcher and gently pour it into the bucket set up. 
In a separate pot on the stove, I keep the sparge water around 170 degrees. 
 
Now for my question... 
What's the best way to sparge?  Right now, I use a measuring cup, scoop 
about a cup of water, and slowly pour this over the grains.  Then I drain 
about a cup from the bucket and pour it into the 4 gallon pot.  I keep 
repeating this for about an hour.  Obviously, this is rather tedious and I 
can't help but think that there must be a better way.  In addition, by the 
time I'm done, the temperature of the runnings have dropped to around 
125-130 degrees, and this must be hurting my efficiency.  (Right now I get 
about 25-26 p/p/g).  Any comments? 
 
Thanks.

the protein rest is useful for adjuncts with a high amount of bigger proteins, 
such as flaked barley.  you can end up with hazy beer if you don't give a 
protein rest to break them down.  for a dark beer, perhaps haze is not as much 
of an issue for some people.  i'm not sure about the big protein content of 
other flaked grains. 
 
one thing you can try is raising the temperature of the protein rest to 
130 or 135 deg. F.  the higher temperature favors the protein-degrading 
enzyme that breaks down bigger proteins (into the size you want) and lessens 
the effects of the enzyme that breaks the smaller proteins down (into even 
smaller pieces).  keep in mind at 135 deg. F there may be some beta amylase 
activity (if there's any small starch available). 
 
however, this raises a question i have about head retention and dark beers. 
i've noticed that some of my darker beers tend to not have as good head 
retention as my paler (non-lagered) ones.  i wonder, does a low pH during 
the protein rest/mashing contribute to lower head retention?   i remember that 
one of the protein-degrading enzymes (peptidase?, protease?) works better at

this problem.  i have difficulty measuring dark wort pH because i use 3-color 
pH strips and they get discolored to the point that i'm not sure what the pH 
really is.  maybe there's more to it than just the protein rest results at a 
low pH.  i know my hot break is sometimes pretty small for dark beers.  does 
this affect head retention at all?

i actually found this exact beer in a store over the weekend, and it sounded 
the death knell for my dunkel recipe.  if any of you are looking to brew a 
munich style dark beer, this is probably a good beer to gage your effort 
against.  pretty cool name, too. altbayerisch =  "old bavarian".

Off the top of my head, I would expect this to be a BAD idea.

I think the competition organizers should clearly state that the contest is 
either amature or professional (most do this). Then its up to the organizers 
if they want to get AR about checking credentials. Its also up to the 
contestants to be honest or not. If the organizers find out that a winner is 
pro (in an amature contest) they should pull the prize and award it to the 
next one in line. 
 
Define a professional? I'd say they must be working at or have recent 
working experience at brewery or brewpub. 
 
Andy - can you get us entry forms and other information about the contest?

Well, I have to stand by my record of no problems of near geysers! I 
would suggest that, anyone not using a blowoff tube, monitor/control his 
fermentation temperatures to the low side and wait until secondary fermentation
to dry hop. I have to assume David is adding hops to the primary due to the 
abundant activity he speaks of. 
Good luck...

Subject: "Authentic" pils schedule


There appears to be a bit of confusion about this schedule. In my first 
posting I said that I had done my second decoction and what a long day 
it had been. Also I mentioned that this schedule was from The Brewers 
Companion by Randy Mosher. Many people sent requests for details, so I 
posted the schedule practically verbatum from the book. I also thought 
that it appeared to be a very thin mash, but after the decoction 
evaporation, worked fine. I transfered this weekend, and my 
hydrometer/taste sample was might fine. Great malt flavor.

Subject: Al Korzonas' comments re: channelling/setmash.


 Al notes that he has never had a setmash.  He is lucky!  I've had 
3 so far out of 100 mashes.  2 were weizens's (one step mash, one decoction) 
one was a doppelbock (34 lbs of grain in a keg mashtunn and double decoction). 
 
 I concluded that the reasons for these set mashes in my situation were 
(in order of importance): 
 
 1)  recirculation was at too great a rate and 1st runnings collected 
too quickly. I since checked Warner. He gives rates that were much slower than 
what I was using.  I put the valve wide open.  This works fine for most mashes 
but didn't for the decoction mashes.  Apparently decoction mashes require 
this to be carried out more slowly. The result was that the grain bed in these 
situations compacted severely. 
 
 2) Too fine a crush, for the mash employed.  Although you don't have 
to worry about shredding husks with malted wheat, if the particle size is 
too small, the bed compacts too much. 
 
 3) Sparge started too late and bed compacted. 
 
 In these three mashes, the bed, when turned out into the compost bin, 
was mottled in appearance, with the darker portions remaining sweet.  This 
suggests channelling in these cases.  Sparging times approached 3 hours! 
Apparently, some breweries routinely stir or rake (terminology?) the entire 
grain bed, re-cirulate again, and continue collecting runnings.  This may be 
done several times.  I've yet to verify this procedure (disclaimer).

Just to add my experience, I smacked a pack on Sunday morning, 9/15, 
hoping to brew on Wed. or Thurs. evening.  It's now Tues eve., 9/17 
and the pack is still less than 1/2" thick!  I'll never have a starter 
up in time for brewing this week.  The date on the pack was August 28, 
so it isn't very old, and I've never had problems with the HB shop 
from which it came.  Seems a trend here.  Has anyone had a GOOD 
experience with this strain?  Should I take it back and exchange it 
for *real* yeast?  Is it worth the wait?

Your memory fails you Don (as mine does at times).  Vienna and Munich 
both have plenty of diastatic power to convert themselves.  Even DeWolf- 
Cosyns Aromatic (which is a very dark Munich at around 25 Lovibond) 
has enough enzymatic power to convert itself.  The confusion was that 
someone mixed up a post about Victory (a toasted malt, like Biscuit, that 
has virutually no diastatic power) with Vienna (a pale high-kilned malt 
that has plenty).  Incidentally, 6-row malts invariably have more enzymatic 
power than 2-row malts of the same type.  Enzymes are proteins and the 
protein level of 6-row malts is higher, so it's not suprising.  While not 
necessarily the case for all malt types, I agree that the 2-row German and 
Belgian Vienna and Munich have much better flavour than their 6-row 
counterparts. 
 
*** 
Matt asks about Special B. 
 
Special B is a very dark Belgian crystal malt.  It has a deep, rich 
raisiny aroma/flavour and a little roasty, dark malt aroma/flavour too. 
It does not have to be mashed and has no enzymatic power.  Treat it like 
a dark crystal (150 to 250 Lovibond)... i.e. don't use more than 1/4 or 
1/2 pound in a medium-gravity amber or dark beer.  You can go a little 
higher in really big beers.  It is an important part of getting that 
raisiny flavour of Chimay Premier and Grand Reserve. 
 
*** 
Darrin asks about headspace in a Barleywine. 
 
Headspace in the primary is never a problem no matter what the style. 
Fermentation creates CO2 which pushes all the air out of the headspace. 
Some brewers who use secondaries worry about headspace after racking, 
but I wouldn't: the action of siphoning releases quite a bit of dissolved 
CO2 and that will purge out any air from the headspace of the secondary. 
This doesn't mean that you should not still be careful to not splash 
the beer your are racking.

Subject: Copper


John DeCarlo commented on the copper levels in beer. M&BS has a table of 
inorganic constituents of beer. They report German beers as containling 
from 0.04 to 0.8 mg/L copper with a mean of 0.19. British beers are 
reported to contain 0.3 to 0.8 mg/L. The numbers for "Lagers" are 0.01 - 
0.41 with a mean of 0.11 mg/L. Note that 1.5 to 3 mg/day is the estimated 
"safe and adequate" daily dietary intake for adults. It is also interesting 
to note that doses as small as 10 mg can cause nausea in an adult although 
chronic daily intakes of from 10 to 35 mg/day have been observed without 
ill effects (must be German and British beer drinkers).

BEER COMPETITION ORGANIZER SYSTEM 
 
Barry Delapp is pleased to announce availability of the Beer Competition 
Organizer (BCO) shareware, developed to simplify the task of running a 
homebrew competition.  It is being offered to all organizers of homebrew 
competitions for a $25 service charge to cover materials, documentation, 
handling and shipping.  This software runs on standard PC and 
compatibles. 
This package has been used at a number of competitions successfully, 
including this year's first round of the AHA Nationals. 
 
He got frustrated after helping with our club's first homebrew event, in 
1994.  The manual effort was staggering and he started programming 
immediately afterward to automate the process for the next year.  With 
the dual role of developer and user, he got carried away and invested 
several man-months in software development.  After each of the first few 
uses, he made significant enhancements (users can be very demanding) and 
generalized the software for use in most types of homebrew 
competitions.  As a result, he believes anyone running a beer contest 
will 
benefit significantly from this system. 
 
The system is used to organize brewers, entry forms, entry bottles, 
judges, scores assigned by judges, prizes awarded and the return of 
score sheets to brewers.  With it, you will be able to perform the 
following: 
 -print peel-off entry number labels to apply to bottles and entry forms. 
 -record brewer's names and addresses. 
 -record the entries for each brewer including category, subcategory and 
special information for judges (dry/medium/sweet, special ingredients, 
classic styles, etc.). 
 -collapse category/subcategories into tables for judging and awarding 
prizes. 
 -split tables into flights for judging (usually if 12 or more entries 
are entered for one table). 
 -enter judges who are expected to be available, their favorite 
category/subcategories and their least favorite category/subcategories. 
 -print Pull Lists.  Pull Lists are printed reports of what beers are 
included in each flight with all information judges are supposed to be 
provided (category/subcategory, special ingredients, dry/medium/sweet, 
etc.).  Each list is used: 
 --by judges to keep track of beers being judged, 
 --by stewards to pull the right beers in the correct order, and 
 --as a turnaround document to report the scores and prizes assigned to 
  each entry in each flight for each table. 
 -print Table Signs showing each table/flight to be judged.   These can 
be placed at the judging locations so judges will know where to go after 
being assigned to a table/flight. 
 -print Judge Assignment Matrix for up to 3 scheduled rounds of judging. 
Each matrix shows rows of scheduled judges and columns of table/flights 
to be judged.  Cells of the matrix are pre-filled with: 
 --preferences of judges for beers in the table/flight (1st, 2nd, 3rd 
choice), 
 --dislike for the beers in the table/flight, and 
 --disqualification for a table because of one or more entries at that 
table was brewed by the judge. 
 -record judge assignments made by the Judge Coordinator for each 
table/flight. 
 -reprint the Judge Assignment Matrix after preliminary judge assignments 
to verify that all judges have been assigned and all table/flights are 
covered by a full complement of judges. 
 -record judges who show up unannounced (walk-ins) and delete expected 
judges who do not show up (no-shows) when the competition starts. 
 -print peel-off labels for each judge so he doesn't have to write the 
header information on each score sheet.  The labels state the entry 
number and entry information, the judge's name and judge experience 
level.  This eliminates some errors of judges writing the wrong 
information on the sheet and saves judges time. 
 -record scores and prizes on the PC directly from each Pull Lists used 
as turnaround documents. 
 -print Best of Show Pull List  -- a Pull List of all entries awarded a 
1st Place. 
 -print a report of Winners (prizes by table with names and home towns of 
all prize winners). 
 -print a report of all Results (brewers, categories and scores). 
 -print mail address labels for all brewers who entered beers for mailing 
back score sheets (and optionally for sending entry forms before the 
next competition). 
 -distribute competition results and score sheets to brewers who attend 
the awards ceremony!
