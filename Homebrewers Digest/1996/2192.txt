Subject: Hose pressure drop (Things that make you go 'Hmmm...')


I read here that 3/16" ID hose has a pressure drop of about 3 psi per foot. 
So, if I use 10 feet of hose, I should get about 30 psi drop, right?  Now, 
if I hook this up to my keg, which is carbonated/pressurized at only 10 psi, 
I should have (10 - 30) = negative 20 psi at the tap.  Will this negative 
presssure cause my keg to suck air back through the line into the keg, or 
will the negative pressure cause the hose to collapse, thus preventing any 
flow at all?

"Ale, Mulled 
 
Place a pint of good ale or beer in a saucepan, with a little grated 
nutmeg.  When it boils take it off the fire, then sweeten.  Beat two or 
three eggs, and mix with a little cold also.  Boil, and then add the egg to 
the hot ale, pouring backwards and forwards from one vessel to the other to 
prevent curdling.  Rum or brandy may be added ad libitum.

Subject: RIMS (computer control)


 
I would like to automate my mash and sparge with a computer. Is it 
possible to buy a card that will convert a thermocouple (or other temp 
sensor) to an input that can be read by a computer ? I would also like to 
turn an electric heater on and off as well as some valves and a pump. Has 
anyone tried this ? 
 
My goal would be to be able to set the mash temp, turn on the RIMS pump 
and have a computer monitor the mash temp adjusting it by switching a 
heater on and off. After a predetermined amount of time (1.5 hours) I 
would turn the heater on until mashout temp of 170 F and mashout for 10 
minutes. Turn off the heater and RIMS pump, open a valve and sparge for 
1.5 hours.

Subject: Decoction-mashed Oktoberfest Recipe


Hi Everyone, 
 
I would like to move onto the next higher plane of all-grain 
brewing...the dreaded decoction mash! I want to brew a nice 
Oktoberfest/Maerzen-style beer using a (simple) two-step decoction mash 
technique. I have read the Decoction Mashing Faq at the Brewery, but I 
would like to get someone's tried and true recipe (and maybe some 
helpful hints). Also, a while back I read what I thought was a decent 
article on decoction mashing in Brew Your Own magazine, but I can't find 
that particular issue. If my memory serves me correctly, the article had 
a recipe for an Oktoberfest. If someone has that article and can either 
give me the recipe or (if it's not asking too much) perhaps fax me a 
copy, that would be wonderful. 
 
I am aware that decoction mashing is essential for obtaining that malty, 
caramelized flavor and deep garnet amber color, and I am psyched to 
devote an entire Sunday to creating this brew. If anyone out there has a 
great recipe based on standard mashing teachniques (not decoction), I'd 
appreciate that, too (just in case I whimp out!). 
 
Thanks a bunch,

Howdy, 
 
This statement brings up a good point... I also expect to get alot of flames 
from brewers that use BOP's, but what the who... 
 
Questions: 
 
1. Are brewers that use BOP's really brewing their own beer or are the BOP's 
really doing most of the work for the brewers who I would assume are mostly 
but not completely made up of "Fad-Brewers" and novice experimenters? 
 
2. In My opinion this BOP process is anything but homebrewing... How does 
everyone else feel about this? 
 
3. Should a beer that is brewed at a BOP be able to be entered in an AHA or 
any other Homebrew Competition? (BOP's have walk in temp controlled lagering 
facilities... not the lagering fridge that I have) 
 
4. If I go down the street and talk Weinkeller (please no jokes about the 
Pub) into letting me brew a batch of beer in their testing brewery and then 
lager it in their walk-in fridge all for $75 and they even bottle it I 
wouldn't be able to enter it in an AHA competition so why should I or anyone 
else for that matter be allowed to enter a BOP brewed beer in a competition? 
They are both about the same! 
 
5. This causes some major double standards as far as I can see so shouldn't 
it be debated with the AHA and amongst Brew-Clubs? 
 
I figure from George's initial statement there is alot that could be done 
with this thread so let's take it on for a while if anyone is game (or gamey 
for that matter). 
 
**** DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT AGAINST PEOPLE THAT BREW AT BOP'S, NOR AM I SAYING 
THAT YOU CAN NOT BREW GOOD BEER THERE... BUT IS IT HOMEBREWING? *****

Subject: Re: Vienna and Munich Malt


 
Bill Griffin contradicts my earlier post on Vienna and 
Munich malts.  Bill is somewhat correct, however, I will 
not concede 100%. 
 
I must qualify my claim that it is possible to make beer 
that will be out-of-style when using 100% Vienna or Munich 
grain.  First of all, I was repeating from memory of an 
article I had read in the 1995 Special Issue of Zymurgy.  I 
agree that this should not be the only publication on malt 
that I or any others should rely on, however, the article 
mentioned, "Malt: A Spectrum of Colors and Flavors," 
written by Neil C. Gudmestad and Raymond J. Taylor has 
quite a comprehensive list for the novice homebrewer, such 
as myself.  Second, I have referred back to the article to 
be sure that my memory is not to blame for 100% of my 
previous post.  I don't wish to point fingers, but do wish 
to point out facts.  I'm sure other publications may 
contradict these findings, but is that not splitting hairs? 
 
Okay I was incorrect about Vienna malt. 
Only two varieties of Vienna malt are listed in the 
article, US and German and are only 3-4 L.  When used 
as 100% of the total grain bill will result in the proper 
color. 
 
I still wonder about the resulting extraction when using 
German Vienna, because the malt is listed as only having 
"moderate" diastatic power.  US Vienna, on the other hand, 
is rated as "very high" in diastatic power, but is this 
not the dreaded 6-row variety? 
 
Okay, I was partially incorrect with my assertion that using 
100% Munich malt would result in a beer that is out-of-style. 
There are several varieties of Munich malt listed and range in 
color from 7.8 L to 30 L. Using 100% Munich to produce a Munich 
Dunkel with 10 L Munich malt will result in a beer that is 22.5 
SRM, which is over the range of 17-20 SRM, according to the 
1995 AHA style guidelines. 
 
Of the Munich malts listed, only two were below 10 L, and 4 
were 10 L or above.  Thus, it is both possible to meet the AHA 
style guidelines, when brewing a 100% Munich Dunkel, and not. 
 
I wonder also about the diastatic power of Munich.  All varieties 
listed are "moderate" in diastatic power.  I would have to see 
the actual malt analysis to predict the extraction rate, but I 
have realized low extraction with malts rated higher in this 
article, therefore I am pessimistic, and would prefer to use a 
mixture of malts for balance - better safe than sorry. 
 
Cough, hack, gag, gargle, phtoohey! 
 
You may think I am half full of shit, but I ask, am I not half empty?

Subject: What hops for Red Seal Ale??


I've been trying to do a clone of the North Coast Red Seal Ale. I had 
one brewer, not affiliated in anyway with North Coast, tell me that 
its 100% Centennial hops. 
 
This weekend, I did a 5 gal. batch, with about 34 IBU and 1.050 OG. At 
first taste it doesn't seem to match. (This was with an Alexander's 
Pale Liquid Malt Extract base for neutralness in malt). 
 
Can anyone suggest if I'm heading down the right path, hopwise??

Subject: Sparge Scooping Solution


James Murphy asks, 
 
"What's the best way to sparge?  Right now, I use a measuring cup, scoop 
about a cup of water, and slowly pour this over the grains." 
 
Run two dowels parallel to each other through a plastic "Tupperware" style 
bowl (the flatter & wider the better) that has also been drilled with a few 
1/8" holes circling around the bottom.  I used a one-quart bowl but you might 
find one a bit bigger or smaller as you require; aim for about 1" or so 
clearance above the grain bed & water.  The dowels will straddle your mash 
tun rim and suspend the bowl over the mash.  Now just dump sparge water into 
the bowl only often enough to keep the bed floating.  Doesn't *eliminate* 
scooping but certainly reduces the number of scoops (by about a factor of 
four in your case)!  By experimenting with the number of holes in the bowl, 
you can actually "design-in" the sparge rate (water input rate anyway) to an 
extent.  A fair amount of cooling of the sparge water can occur so experiment 
also with the sparge water temperature.

I believe that the gypsum problem will go away when you set your controls

Subject: WHC score sheet horror


Kit Anderson referred folks to my post on JudgeNet Digest.  For those 
who don't have access to it, here it is: 
 
I've just sent the following to the World Homebrew Contest people. 
 
Jeff Renner in Ann Arbor, Michigan c/o nerenner`at`umich.edu 
 
- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 
 
Kate Begley 
Co-Director, World Homebrew Contest 
Boston Beer Co.

Boston, MA 02130 
 
Dear Kate 
 
I have just received my score sheets, T-shirt and hops from the 1996 
(or 
has it become the 1997?) World Homebrew Contest.  In passing, I must 
note that the hops pellets feel extremely crumbly through the 
packaging. 
However, it is the scoring and score sheets about which I am writing. 
 
I have been a homebrewer for well over 20 years, a beer judge for about 
10 years, a BJCP judge since 1991, and hold the BJCP  rank of Certified 
Judge.  I participate in ongoing judging improvement programs such as 
the Beer Judge Calibration Project and the Internet's Judge Net Digest. 
I think I know beer and beer judging. 
 
Last year, I entered a beer in WHC that I thought had (and still think 
has) commercial potential, a variation on the classic Belgian Wit with 
fresh ginger substituted for the lactic acid tang, and with coriander, 
cardamom and grains of paradise.  (As a matter of fact, I wonder if it 
helped inspire the Sam Adams Summer Wheat with lemon and grains of 
paradise).  This "Ginger Wit" is very popular with beer drinkers and 
non-beer drinkers alike, a light, refreshing beer with a good balance 
of 
components and a nice summer cooler.  It scored a 43 in the Michigan 
State Fair from BJCP National judges, and I was pleased to receive 
three 
highly perceptive and informative score sheets from WHC with scores in 
the upper 30's, with full comments in all categories. 
 
I entered this year's batch (which scored 41 in the State Fair, again 
from a BJCP National judge) in the WHC with high hopes that it might be 
a longshot.  After two months, I received back the worst score sheets 
(enclosed) that I have ever seen!  I don't mean merely that I strongly 
disagree with the 26/27 scores, although I do.  I mean the quality of 
scoring.  The two judges (both "Experienced") had but one written 
comment between them, under aroma -  "Spruce/SO2."  Spruce?  SO2?  Not 
in this beer!  What about ginger?  Or the orangey coriander?  Or the 
Belgian nose from the Brugges yeast?  What beer were they tasting?   I 
can't even begin to comment on the point breakdown except to note, for 
example, that allotting one point of three possible for hops is 
meaningless in a wit, where hops are simply not perceptible.   And to 
deduct for clarity when a wit is expected to have a haze?  The point 
allocations were identical in all but one sub category, leading me to 
think that they copied one another. 
 
I know that it is difficult to judge specialties that are not a classic 
style, and that the score sheet does not lend itself to them, but did 
these guys have a clue?  Did they know what a wit tastes like enough to 
judge a variation of it?  Do they know what coriander smells like? 
Have 
they even ever had a Canada Dry ginger ale?  I'm afraid that, 
metaphorically speaking, they couldn't find their derrieres with their 
hands tied behind their backs.  I suspect that if they do know beer 
judging, they simply had judged too many beers to be at all perceptive. 
They still should have written some kind of comments.  Were they give 
any kind of direction? 
 
Our club, the Ann Arbor Brewers' Guild, organizes three competitions 
per 
year - the Michigan State Fair, the regional "Taste of the Great 
Lakes", 
and the national "Mazer Cup" mead competition.  I have seen first hand 
how it can be difficult to get qualified judges, and not overtax them 
with flights that are too large.  Our solution has been to judge over 
several days, or even over several weeks if necessary, even if it means 
a delay in results.  Furthermore, we always pair well experienced 
judges 
with less experienced ones, which helps in quality judging and helps 
develop judging skills.  I realize that the WHC is an order of 
magnitude 
larger, but it is still essential to maintain quality of judging. 
 
Once again, I want to emphasize that it is not the scores that bother 
me 
nearly as much as the horrible quality of the score sheets, which is 
insulting.  I hope you can find a way to eliminate such judging in the 
future. 
 
 
Sincerely 
 
Jeff Renner

According to the National Agricultural Statistical Service of

sugar were produced from cane in the US and 3,809,000 tons were 
produced from beets. (See 
http://www.mannlib.cornell.edu/data-sets/specialty/91006/ for 
details.) I can attest to the fact that we grow a lot of 
sugar beets in the US because years ago when I frequently drove 
through the Salinas valley of California to visit my in-laws, I 
occasionally got stopped at a railroad grade crossing for half 
an hour or more while a train hauling nothing but sugar beets 
went by. I strongly suspect that we don't export all that beet 
sugar to Europe. As far as I have been able to determine, from a 
chemical or brewing standpoint, beet and cane sugar are 
virtually indistinguishable so it's really a moot point 
from which source your sugar comes.

Subject: Hop filters.


 
At the start of the copper (kettle) boil, just as the wort begins to 
boil, I always skim off the coagulated scum which floats up to the top 
of the wort. This means less work for the hop filter bed when I 
eventually run off the boiling wort into the fermenter two hours later. 
 
I no longer use hop bags, but use flower hops (NOT pellets) floating 
loose in the copper. 
 
I have a secret weapon to prevent the hops from clogging the output 
tap/spigot. 
 
I take a small sheet of stainless steel gauze, (taken from a kitchen 
sieve) about the size of a bank-note, and roll it up like a cigar. 
 
I place this filter into the inside of the output tap/spigot of the 
copper (BEFORE FILLING IT!). This is a very good hop filter, and I get 
nice clean wort. 
 
The "copper" is really plastic, a  5 gallon (UK) "Bruheat" boiler. 
 
My brew is a traditional english ale with Maris Otter pale malt, 
Fuggles (bittering) and Goldings hops (aroma), and O.G.  1044 . 
My yeast is a proffessional Burton (top fermenting) yeast obtained from 
a local real-ale brewery.

Subject: Copper & oxidation


Al K. doubts my input on copper causing oxidation: 
 
AlK>What's your source on this information?  I am extremely skeptical. 
 
Well, don't forget you asked for it! 
I'll start by quoting Charlie Bamforth of the Research Department of 
Bass(1): 
 
"Clearly the elimination of superoxide, but especially peroxide and 
metals, will be of singular benefit to the shelf life of small-pack 
beers...Above all, traces of metals such as copper and iron should be 
eliminated at all stages...Only when ground-state oxygen is activated to 
superoxide and beyond is it able to cause damage." 
 
AlK>Hogwa... er... I disagree.  Billions of gallons of beer has been 
AlK>made in copper kettles and mash tuns. 
 
Narziss (Weihenstephan) says (3): 
"Metals catalyse oxidations. The replacement of copper or mild steel by 
stainless steel has minimised this factor, although the effect of 
cleaning agents on metal surfaces should not be neglected." 
(I presume "cleaning agents" refers to the practice of eliminating the 
oxide layer to minimise Cu++ and Fe++ pickup.) 
 
The negative effect of copper on beer flavour stability is one reason 
for the global switch to stainless steel. Technology does not remain 
stagnant. Most copper seen in modern breweries is for cosmetic reasons. 
That copper boiler you see is more likely to be of stainless steel with 
a copper hood. 
 
AlK>I've never had a problem with any of my beers that can be attributed 
to copper. 
 
I think you should rephrase that to, "I've never had a problem with any 
of my beers that I have attributed to copper." 
 
I personally think that the hysteria attributed to HSA and oxidation is 
an over-reaction from a homebrew perspective. However, if one wants to 
be really anal about oxidation (like being scared of fermenting in 
plastic or storing beer in PET bottles), I think it would be consistent 
to elimininate what is largely believed to be a major source of 
oxidation in beer (1,2,3,4). Charlie Bamforth's experiments show that 
introducing Cu++ (1ppm) to a 275ml bottle of beer causes more carbonyl 
compounds than introduction of 10ml air! (1). This trend has been 
confirmed in later studies (2,4). 
 
The one benefit copper is said to have on beer flavour is that of 
scavenging undesirable sulphury compounds (5). 
 
I'll post a follow-up containing the overall theory. 
 
Andy.

Subject: copper and oxidation - the theory


As molecular oxygen is a relatively stable molecule, it must be 
converted to one of several radical or activated forms before it can 
react with beer compounds to form stale flavours (mostly carbonyls). 
This can occur by the acquisition of electrons from metal ions to form 
superoxide (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the hydroxyl free radical 
(OH*), and singlet oxygen. (These are in approximate ascending order of 
reactivity). 
 
It is not clear which of these forms are mainly responsible for beer 
staling, but the important point is that ground state O2 must be 
activated before it can commence. Transition metal ions can catalyse 
this process. These exist in malt, but a substantial quantity can be 
picked up from contact with metallics. The most important of these 
metallic ions appears to be copper, since as little as 50ppb has been 
shown to cause beer staling. Hence copper pickup should be minimised 
throughout the brewing process, from mashing through to the finished 
beer. 
 
MASHING & LAUTERING 
******************* 
The main source of oxygen absorption during mashing is thought to be due 
to the enzymic oxidation of polyphenols by peroxidase. This reaction is 
generally limited by the availability of hydrogen peroxide in the mash. 
This results in a reddening of the wort, and encourages the 
precipitation of polyphenols with protein. (It is interesting that 
unoxidised polyphenols play a major role in beer flavour stability, but 
possibly a negative one in terms of astringency!) 
 
High levels of copper in the mash (eg. due to a dirty copper mash tun) 
can thus lead to higher levels of H2O2, and promote oxidation of 
polyphenols. ie. HSA. 
 
Malt peroxidase is stable with temperature. About 50% will survive 1 
hour at 65C, and 45% at 76C. 
 
BOILING 
******* 
Copper ions bind strongly with species such as polyphenols, melanoidins 
and proteins. A substantial amount of Cu will precipitate in the hot 
break (although polyphenol oxidation may already have occurred). 
Melanoidins bind Fe and Cu very strongly, and it has been suggested that 
this may contribute to dark beers' antioxidant properties. 
 
FERMENTATION 
************ 
Some metallics are absorbed by yeast during the fermentation, zinc in 
particular. 
 
POST-FERMENTATION 
***************** 
Minimisation of ground state oxygen at this stage is desirable, but the 
negative effects of even quite substantial levels of O2 may be negated 
if the O2 is not activated. Elimination of metal ions will enhance shelf 
life, and is possibly more important than over emphasising low oxygen 
levels.

Subject: RE:  Brewers raking the sparge / Munich malt and Dunkles


     Hello! 
 
     Jim Cave says that he's heard that some breweries rake their grain bed 
     at some point during the sparge, recirculate to achieve clarity, and 
     then continue to collect the runnings.  He didn't know of any 
     examples, though. 
 
     Deschutes brewery, Bend OR, for one, does reset the grain bed once 
     during lautering. 
     ---------------------- 
     In a recent digest somebody (do you like how specific I can be?) said 
     that 100% Munich malt will make a Munich Dunkle.  No, it won't.  I've 
     done this to make a Maerzen.  The beer will be too light for a Dunkle 
     (it's about right for a festbier). 
 
     All this talk of omitting roasted malts in Dunkles disturbs me. 
     Darryl Richman describes (quite nicely in his book, "Bock") the 
     German's use of roasted malts as "color malts."  In SMALL quantities 
     roasted malts can/are used to deepen the color (and lower the mash pH) 
     of Munich beers. 
 
     I used 2 ounces of chocolate malt in a 5.5 US gal. batch of Dunkle 
     that was pretty good.  The flavor contribution of 2 ounces of 
     chocolate malt was just about nil, and the color was right on. 
 
     Have fun!

BOP's are the contract brewerys of the homebrewing community. Which leads 
me to quote a funny quote I read in "Barley Corn" a brewspaper from 
Frederick, MD: 
 
"Contract brewing is the cocaine of the beer business. Those who do it, 
deny it. Then they claim they have it under control. Finally, they say 
it's okay in small amounts." - Paul Shipman, President, Redhook.

Brewsters: 
 
I got awfully nervous reading Tim Martin's method of sterilizing using grain 
alcohol at the mouth of his carboy and then lighting it. Alcohol and air in the
correct ratio are explosive.  I suggest you stop flicking your Bic.  Also, 
"sterilizing" by burning is probably not doing anything since most of the heat 
is going up.  I suggest you stick with conventional sterilants like bleach 
followed by boiled hot water in three rinses. It works fine. Let beer's big 
brother cool some other flames.
