With all of the discussion about the LongShot beers, I thought I'd let 
everyone know that the LongShot brewers will be at the GABF... and also 
they will be "talking" at the Virtual GABF on the World Wide Web next 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday (September 26-28) from 8:00 to 8:30 
mountain time, so if you have any questions for them, ask them then. 
 
Several professional brewers as well as Charlie Papazian (You Know 
Who), Jim Dorsch (Beer Writer) and James Spence (PPBT Judge) will also 
be attending.  If you have a homebrew club, you may want to arrange a 
special club meeting somewhere with Internet access.  For more 
information look at the schedule at:

How about this. Mash grains without the pumpkin. When conversion is 
complete, run the first runnings from the tun (do not mash out!) 
into the kettle and then add the pumpkin. There should be sufficient 
enzymes left in the first runnings to convert the starch in the 
pumpkin while it's in the kettle (this will eliminate any sparging 
nightmares). After converting the pumpkin, finish sparging the 
grains into the kettle and boil the pumpkin with the wort. 
 
I have also thought of doing this when mashing pure corn starch. 
 
Which makes me wonder (WMMW), is mashing corn starch basically the 
same as adding corn sugar to the copper? Is it worth the trouble to 
mash corn starch or should I just add corn sugar? 
 
In an unrelated thread, someone mentioned that in a case of beer 
they had conditioning, all the yeast was clinging to one side of 
the bottle. Someone suggested something about magnetic influences 
on the yeast that attracted it to one side. WMMW, could yeast be 
influenced by a large magnet placed under the fermenter? Would 
this cause the yeast to settle quicker? AS&S sell strong magnets 
cheap. Maybe it's time to experiment (read: brew more beer).

Subject: RIMS - Disadvantages and some thoughts.


 
Daryl K Kalenchuk asks about RIMS disadvantages ... 
 
Before I list disadvantages, note that I am in favor of any technique 
or apparatus that allows greater parameter control and/or 
repeatability, and RIMS certainly does this.  I've also recently 
tasted some very good HB beers brewed on a RIMS, so don't suppose that 
I am opposed to the RIMS methodology on pragmatic grounds.  I do 
believe that it is a limited first generation design and has 
substantial room for improvement. 
 
* The small high capacity heating elements used in typical RIMS means 
  that a large amount of thermal energy is transferred over the rather 
  small surface area of the heating element.  This leads to very high 
  thermal gradient, and so high temperatures in the immediate vicinity 
  of the heating element.  This would suggest thermal loss of enzymes, 
  coagulation of proteins and caramelization of sugars. 
 
* The pumps typical of RIMS design cause substantial shear force 
  which can, and undoubtedly does denature proteins and enzymes to 
  some extent.  Throttling flow rates with a valve exacerbates this 
  problem.  This issue is addressed in commercial enzymatic processes 
  by specialized pump design. 
 
* Very thick mashes are probably not possible with a RIMS apparatus, 
  as the amount of fluid available for recirculation and the amount of 
  time requires for the liquid to sump would undoubtedly cause 
  cavitation and/or loss of priming wort in the up-tube and subsequent 
  heating problems. 
 
* RIMS recirculation is probably not possible with very sticky mashes, 
  for example those that include a high proportion of wheat, rye and 
  perhaps rice. 
  (For example I brewed a Roggen clone a few weeks ago that used 63% 
   rye malt in a double decoction mash schedule.  The two decoctions 
   made the rye grist much more amenable to sparging. But in the 
   interim the mash consistency was something like elmers glue and 
   thick oatmeal Not RIMSable I think.) 
 
- -- Advantage/Disadvantage -- 
 
* I really think that the liquid/electrical danger issue should be 
  added to the disadvantages list -  Just as the advantage of no open 
  propane flames and no resulting fumes certainly should be added to 
  the advantages. 
 
=== 
 
It is useful to consider the mashing/sparging process which involves 
mixing strike water and grist, adding heat and evenly distributing it 
throughout the mash, setting up a grainbed thru recirculation and then 
draining sweet wort throughout a sparge period. 
 
All these functions combine synergistically into a nicely practical 
single bit of hardware called a RIMS.  And there are many 
*conveniences* in the use of a RIMS, but I am going to consider issues 
of control and quality.  If I wanted convenience I'd buy beer. 
 
Taking the last stage first, the setup of the grainbed and extraction 
of sweet wort probably is no better with a RIMS than with conventional 
HB hardware.  It has been suggested on HBD that the extremely clear 
highly recirculated runnings from a RIMS setup may lack sufficient 
lipids for optimal yeast growth.  It's hard to argue that a RIMS 
sparge isn't slightly more repeatable than a conventional sparge, but 
it isn't clear that repeatability has much value at this late stage. 
 
The initial dough-in stage owes little to the RIMS apparatus except 
convenience of pumping.  After some initial mixing it's possible to 
recirc wort with the RIMS to thoroughly mix the mash.  The shear 
forces in the pump at this early stage may be objectionable.  Also a 
RIMS probably can't take mashes as thick a those that I usually use at 
dough-in and during the protein rest.  A paddle undoubtedly generates 
less shear force than a pump at this stage.  Does the RIMS add to 
control or repeatability at this stage ?  Hard to answer, but it seems 
unlikely.  The major objective of getting grist in contact with water 
and preventing balling still requires substantial human intervention 
and observation I think. 
 
Mash schedule w/ temp stepping - This is where RIMS has it's most 
obvious advantages - and this is after all the most critical stage of 
the process.  A program controlled RIMS can undoubtedly accurately 
repeat very complex mash schedules.  If adequate temperature sensing 
is done, then there is the possibility for excellent mash time & temp 
accuracy too.  The RIMS pumps' shear force loss of enzymes and 
proteins continues to be a negative and the high temperatures produced 
at the very small surface if the waterheater element is an even 
greater threat to the wort.  In theory a burner and a human stirrer 
with a thermometer can do an excellent job, but in practice we all 
know that a moments inattention causes the dreaded scorched pot 
syndrome or at least temperature drift with remarkable frequency.  The 
RIMS pretty clearly wins this stage - BUT ... 
 
A more gentle stirring mechanism and a larger surface area lower 
temperature heating element would be unmitigated improvements to a 
RIMS IMO.  Also notice that a RIMS is taking the sugar and enzyme rich 
wort and subjecting it to heat and shear forces.  Ideally we'd like to 
heat perfectly evenly - or selectively heat the grist.  It seems 
nearly impossible to heat evenly.  Heating the grist rather than the 
wort might achieve some of the many advantages of decoction.

Sorry, but Just Hops now has absolutly the smallest selection of hops as 
in no hops at all.  Mark sold out to Highlander Homebrew in Colorado 
Springs (800-934-2739).  Mark said he was tired of doing it and it seemed 
he never have time for anything like brewing and family.  He said that 
Just Hops is supposed to continue as Just Hops but it will be run by, 
and from, Highlander Homebrew.  Highlander is not yet setup as all of 
the equipment is not in their possesion.  Mark didn't know when 
Just Hops would reappear. 
 
I hope Highlander does as good a job as Mark -- I liked the vaccum packing 
job he did.

Unfortunately, I just found out about Just Hops and got excited that we had 
a hop dealer in Illinois.  I did send an E-mail to Mark and he replied: 
 
Just Hops has switched hands. It's now  in Colorado. Call 1 800 934 BREW and 
they will be happy to help you out.

For comparable prices to Just Hops, try the Malt and Hop Stop, also in 
Illinois. I placed an order yesterday. Free shipping and at prices

Timothy J Kniveton asks: 
 
>What is the probability that a beginning homebrewer will turn out a 
>decent first batch of beer?  second?  third? 
 
I can only speak from personal experience here, but my 1st batch was decent. 
By decent, I mean better than drinkable, but not what I was truly aiming for. 
My dad loved it, the guy up the street loved it, I drank it. 
 
By my 4th batch, I was gaining confidence, and brewed a mostly extract 
"Guiness" clone that was quite good.  Good enough in fact to take 2nd place 
at our monthly club meeting, with an average score of 34. 
 
>Is it a random variable, or more of a random question? 
 
I say it's a product of how well you embrace the homebrewer's philosophy: 
Relax, Have a Homebrew. 
 
My beer got (and gets) progressively better as I learned that no matter how 
much you worry about your beer, it's still going to turn out or not.  I don't 
get all worked up over the details, I just brew.  I helped a friend brew his 
1st batch.  He got so worked up over doing everything exactly right that he 
oversanitized, and his beer was swill.  On his 2nd attempt, with the memory 
of his 1st try still on his taste buds, he was so careful not to oversanitize 
and undersanitized somewhere along the line.  When he asked if I would help 
with his 3rd batch, I stipulated that he relax and drink at least 3 homebrews 
before we even got started.  This was the best beer either of us have ever 
brewed. 
 
This is my $0.02, FWIW.  I'm not the most experienced brewer, and if you find 
a different system that works for you, by all means use it!  This is just my 
advice to any 1st time or less experienced brewers: 
 
Relax, Have a Homebrew.  Learn it.  Live it.  Love it. 
 
PS - My tagline doesn't refer to the _truly_ anal-retentive beer drinker, just 
the ones anal-retentive enough to drink a commercial beer and say, "I could 
do better than that!"

George De Piro in HBD 2192 notes: 
 
     I used 2 ounces of chocolate malt in a 5.5 US gal. batch of Dunkle 
     that was pretty good.  The flavor contribution of 2 ounces of 
     chocolate malt was just about nil, and the color was right on. 
 
While I have not made a Dunkel, I do brew Bocks using 2-4 ounces 
of chocolate malt in 10 gallons. The chocolate not only adds color, but a 
touch of dryness to balance the malty sweetness. It certainly does not 
impart the sharp bitterness associated with the chocolate in a porter.

Subject: RE: Decoction mashing / Munich malt / Lag times


     Hi! 
 
     Rick expressed a desire to decoction mash, in part to achieve caramel 
     flavor and deep garnet color.  Decoction mashing isn't necessary for 
     these, and in fact, I try to minimize caramelization of the sugars by 
     stirring the mash constantly. 
 
     The biggest reason to decoct at home is to allow sugars and amino 
     acids to form malty-tasting compounds (melanoidins). A by-product of 
     this process is deepening of wort color, but you can achieve the same 
     colors by adjusting the mash bill of an infusion mashed recipe. 
 
     I won't get into my strong belief that Maerzen shouldn't taste like 
     caramel again... 
     ---------------------- 
     In reply to my own post on Munich malt, I forgot about the darker 
     grades because I can't find them!  The stuff I use (from Ireks) is too 
     light to make a 100% Munich Malt Dunkles, but if the darker ones are 
     diastatic enough to convert themselves, it could be done. 
 
     Anybody know a good source of the other grades? 
     ---------------------- 
     Tom Castle asks if long lag times are a Good Thing or Bad Thing.  The 
     answer is Bad Thing! (quite emphatically) 
 
     Long lag times are usually indicative of under-aeration or 
     under-pitching, or both.  They give other, unwelcome microbes a chance 
     to do their bit and contribute off-qualities to the beer (especially a 
     cooked vegetable smell). 
 
     The yeast are going to be making CO2 in all phases off growth; foam is 
     not just indicative of anaerobic fermentation. 
 
     15-20 hours is a long time, but the beer won't necessarily suffer. 
 
     Have fun!

Subject: Computer Controlled Brewing / Rubber Stopper Hole Sizes


Ian Smith asks about controlling a RIMS with a computer: 
 
"I would like to automate my mash and sparge with a computer. Is it 
possible to buy a card that will convert a thermocouple (or other temp 
sensor) to an input that can be read by a computer ? I would also like to 
turn an electric heater on and off as well as some valves and a pump. Has 
anyone tried this ? " 
 
I've thought about it but decided that for me the logistics of locating my PC 
near my brewery were not worth the effort.  But while I was thinking about 
it, I came across a PC card that looks almost custom-made for the job. 
 
ComputerBoards, Inc (125 High Street, Mansfield, MA  02048, 508-261-1123) 
sells a card called the "CIO-DAS08/Jr" for ** $99 **.  It has 8 12-bit 
analog-input channels (+/- 5 volt range), 8 digital outputs, and 8 digital 
inputs.  It's entirely I/O mapped (including the start-conversion command) so 
you can talk to it with simple input and output commands like "peek" and 
"poke" in BASIC or IN and OUT in assembly language.  For another $50, you can 
add a two-channel analog-output chip, though I don't think it's necessary for 
a home brewery. 
 
Attaching an LM34 temperature sensor to an analog input gives you better than 
0.3-degree F (or deg C if using LM35) resolution, and you can use the 
cheap-grade $1.50 LM34D by doing a two-point calibration and storing the 
correction factors in the software.  This should put your accuracy well 
withing one degree.  The digital outputs sink 24 mA so they can directly 
drive LED's, solid-state relays, and some sensitive-coil mechanical relays. 
 I would recommend adding an external relay- or optically-isolated interface 
for any digital I/O that are driving or sensing large voltages, to protect 
the PC. 
 
With this many digital lines available, you could add electric solenoid 
valves to your system and control more than just the mash.  An entire home 
brewery can be built using seven valves (see any of the excellent RIMS pages 
out there) so you could conceivably automate the whole process. 
 
I've bought lots of cards from ComputerBoards here at work, and their prices 
are much lower than anyone else's while quality-wise I've never had a problem 
with any card nor with the order.  If you can write the required control 
software, and rig a couple of cables and relays, you're in business for about 
$100.

If you do a good bit of research, both book learning and talking to 
your local supply store person (if they know what they are doing), 
rehearse the brew procedures the day before and stick to what you have 
read and been told, the probability is high of making a good batch of

If you grab a kit, don't follow the directions and are disorganized 
and do foolish things like dip an unsanitary spoon in your primary

Brewing good drinkable beer ain't rocket science, or even very 
difficult at all. 
 
Brewing excellent beer takes a while, but at least you can be working 
on it while drinking good drinkable beer.

this is an entertaining question.  firstly, the assumption that you will have 
"negative twenty" psi at the tap is not entirely correct.  the beer has to 
move through the hose before the hose can take its toll on the head pressure 
you're pushing with.  so what would happen?  i believe that the beer would 
eventually,  slowly, get to the tap and come out.  i say this because 
i believe the restriction value of 3 psi per foot is based on some nominal 
rate of flow in an equilibrium condition.  i don't believe the restriction 
is 3 psi per foot if the beer moves significantly slower than the rate of 
flow used to generate the tables for hose restriction. 
 
i think the 10 psi (above atmospheric) is enough to overcome the smaller 
amount of friction the beer generates at a very slow rate of flow.  the 
equilibrium condition would be the beer flowing (at slower than the rate of 
flow used to generate the restriction value of 3 psi/ft) out the tap.  the 
pressure differential on the fluid mass is great enough to ensure that some 
motion occurs  (i believe). 
 
but the underlying point is that you don't NEED 10 feet of hose.  the values 
of restriction for different sized hoses are to enable you to buy the minimum 
amount you need FOR A DESIRABLE RATE OF FLOW and carbonation level at 
temperature. 
 
boy, i'm going to feel really stupid if this isn't the right answer.

I think that modern Vienna malts are quite a bit lighter than 
the ones of Anton Dreher's time.  I think you're right about 
an all-Vienna malt beer being too light for the current 
AHA guidelines for Vienna (8 to 12 SRM). 
 
On the other hand:

Whoa!  Beer colour is quite a bit more complicated than multiplying 
degrees Lovibond times pounds and dividing by gallons.  An Appendix 
in George & Laurie Fix's Vienna/O'fest/Maerzen explains this 
(although someone recently pointed out (in Brewing Techniques) a 
possible error in one of the datapoints).  Another source is the 
series of articles on beer colour by Ray Daniels in Brewing Techniques. 
 
[Let me take this opportunity to suggest to those of you that don't 
yet subscribe to Brewing Techniques: subscribe!  If you are serious 
about brewing, you will learn something about brewing in every issue! 
Just a satisfied subscriber, blah, blah, blah...] 
 
My practical experience has indicated that an all-Munich (DeWolf- 
Cosyns or Ireks) will give you a really nice Duesseldorf Alt or 
Munich Dunkel and within the AHA guidelines.  They would be at 
the light end, but would not be out of style.  As for extraction, 
I got something like 28 pts/lb/gal from both, which is within my 
usual range.  Seriously, 30 degrees Lintner is enough for malt to 
convert itself unless one was sloppy with hitting the saccharification 
rest and overshot terribly.  DWC Munich is about 50 deg Lintner and 
DWC Aromatic is about 30.  I've gotten Aromatic to convert itself 
with no other malts present (that's not to say a beer made from 
100% Aromatic would taste very good -- hmmm... naa, I don't think 
it would... too sharp, my guess). 
 
Having tasted the wide variety of Munich Dunkels in Bavaria last 
summer, I will agree with George that 100% Munich malt used in 
an infusion mash will not give that super-malty, almost chocolaty 
flavour of an Ayinger Altbayerisch Dunkel, but it will give one 
similar to the Dunkels from a number of other Bavarian brewers. 
Decoction mashing makes a big difference here, I feel.

Subject: Wyeast Thames


 
I've used this Thames Valley yeast for two batches thus far. 
With no attenuation numbers at hand, I can only say it has 
behaved comparably to the Irish, Chico and London ale strains 
in terms of lag times.  With an appropriate starter, I get 
1-2" krausen in my open fermenter within 8-10hrs.  My aeration 
has been via aquarium pump, and starters for these 10-12gal 
batches have been stepped to 3qts, when settled giving a 1 inch 
yeast cake in the starter vessel's 6 inch diameter bottom. 
 
Taste profile thus far is a bit more fruity than the London Ale 
yeast, with better attenuation than the Irish yeast.  Didn't seem 
to give as dry a beer as the London ale yeast has for me.  YMMV.

Kelley Jones should have put one of those cute little ASCII faces with its 
tongue in its cheek at the end of his post on pressure drops through 
dispensing hoses. Just in case anyone took it seriously, the pressure drop 
across a dispensing hose is always the guage pressure of the tank. The drop 
of x psi per y feet (or meters or whatever) is the pressure drop at nominal 
flow rate and viscosity for the specified hose bore. The object is to 
select a hose bore and length which drops most of the tank pressure (set to 
maintain the desired carbonation level) when the beer is flowing at a 
reasonable rate. This insures a gentle flow into the glass.

Tim, the probability is very high.  Much higher than what the brewer 
thinks. 
 
It seems like such an involved process the first time and so many

Subject: Losses During Primary to Secondary Racking


I'm fairly new to this homebrewing stuff.  I apologize in advance if this is 
a stupid question. 
 
When I rack from my primary to secondary fermenter (both 5 gallon glass 
carboys) I seem to lose anywhere between 3 quarts to 1 gallon of beer.  I 
know that I've started with 5 gallons (calibrated the carboy) and I know that 
I lose about 12 or so ounces when starting the siphon; where does the rest 
go? 
 
There is a fair amount of trub "gunk" in the bottom of the primary fermenter. 
 
 
However when I go to clean the primary after racking, the "solids" seem to 
disappear.  Where did they go? 
 
Am I right in thinking that the trub "solids" are displacing the wort, and 
that I really haven't started with five gallons.  If this is the case, anyone 
have any suggestions on how to eliminate the trub gunk from getting into the 
primary.  I already use an immersion chiller to rapidly cool the wort and 
whirlpool the brewpot and let it sit for about ten minutes before 
transferring into the primary.  However there usually isn't much trub left in 
the center of the pot after racking, it all seems to be in the fermenter. 
 
I'm tired of having 20% of my beer go "somewhere!" 
 
Thanx in advance for any help.

Can someone please give me a lesson calculating IBU's? I tried using someone's

   F.G. 1.013 
   IBU's ? 
 
I did a 3 gal boil and added it to 2.5 gal cold water in carboy.  It tasted

In line with the never ending quest to find things in bulk so that you can 
save yourself and/or your friends some bucks, I stopped in to visit one of 
our local food and restaurant supply companies that is open to retail sales to 
the public to look for some Iodophor or something along those same lines. 
Nothing was available on the shelves, but I spoke with the customer service 
rep who looked through her stock book and found an item listed as "Iosan" and 
included some vague descriptors as to what it was used for...as a detergent/ 
sanitizer and could be used as a final rinse. Added that it was good for 
cleaning out drink dispensers. No info as to how much of the percentage was 
titratable iodine like they put on the side of those little bottles of Iodophor
or such
at the homebrew stores.  But, at $23.05 bottle for a gallon, it may be a 
worthwhile investment for me and my other homebrewing comrades.  Anybody know 
anything about this stuff?  The store in question is Robert Orr / Sysco in

If you set up your system right (proper length of proper diameter hose 
for a given pressure) you should be able to dispense at the same pressure 
as that with which you carbonated.  This way, the beer is always ready 
to be served and always properly carbonated.  The key is setting the 
pressure right (from Alan's great tables) and then having long-enough and 
small-enough hoses to drop all that pressure.  If you still have foam, 
try a narrower or longer hose.  I use a 6- to 8-foot length of 3/16" ID 
beer line for my beers served at 50F.

You would get oxidized beer.  Yeast don't "run out" of oxygen.  They 
absorb the oxygen from the wort within a few hours of pitching.  They use 
this oxygen to build cell membranes.  If there is insufficient oxygen 
at pitching time, the yeast will have weak cell membranes and therefore 
poor alcohol tolerance.  There is a relationship between oxygen needs and 
high-gravity worts/musts, but the oxygen needs to be added before any 
alcohol is created.  Adding oxygen during the violent fermentation will 
increase diacetyl production (try Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale).  Adding 
oxygen when the fermentation is over or almost over will only oxidize the 
alcohols into aldehydes (yuk!) and wipe out any aroma you may have gotten 
from late kettle hops.
