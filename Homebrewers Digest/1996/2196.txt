Fellow HBDers, 
 I have the esteemed privilege to visit the metropolis known as Iselin, NJ for 
a training class next week. Does anyone know if there are any 
brewpub/restaurants in the general vicinity? Even is you know of any good 
restaurants in the area that serve decent draught beer. I will have a car so I 
don't mind some light travelling. If anyone has any information for me please 
email me at bbessett`at`pictel.com. I would also like to know how far by car is 
Iselin from Manhattan?

Subject: re:  3068 Question


George De Piro asked about lowering the fermentation temperature 
of Wyeast 3068 to get more clove and less banana esters in his 
weizens. 
 
I don't know the lower temp limit on that yeast, but I might 
have a different solution to the problem.  I have heard that 
a protein rest at around 113_F is essential to get a good 
clove flavor, and many homebrewers fail because they use the 
standard 122_F rest. 
 
I wish I had a written reference for this information, but I 
heard it from the brewer at my local brewpub.  I know that he 
and I both brewed weizens using Wyeast 3333 (German Wheat), and 
that his beer was nice and clovey, while mine (brewed before I 
learned this tidbit) was very banana-ey.  I kept my fermentation 
temperature around 65_F too. 
 
If anyone can elaborate on why this rule holds true, I'd like to 
hear it.

Fellow HBDers, 
 I posted an article in the past about a felling I had that I was getting an 
infection in my beer due to dry hopping. Well, I just had another infection 
without the dry hopping. All I can think of at this point is that I was using 
some old tubing for siphoning and maybe I transferred the infection in this

i brewed a weizen last fall that i fermented with #3068 at about 60 to 63 
deg. F.  what happened was the beer didn't get many phenolics/esters really. 
a little banana and some bubblegum, and only very faint clove as well.  not as 
bold as i like.  maybe you should try the brewtek yeast.  it supposedly has 
more clove than the wyeast.  i think it's W51. 
 
 
well, this foray into fluid dynamics is creating some controversy.

look at this equilibrium end point condition proposed above:  10 psi 
of gage pressure behind a body of fluid, 0 psig in front of it, and the 
fluid isn't moving?  this was the point in my thought experiment 
that made me conjecture the fluid will establish a steady state flow rate based
on the pressure differential and the hose restriction at that flow rate.

okay, i'm doubting my answer.  who's got 30 feet of hose? 
 
one other thing to mention about long hose runs is that you can warm up the 
beer as it flows through an uninsulated hose.  this causes CO2 to break out 
as it gets warmer.  so if you run a long hose to try and balance your 
system and get an acceptable flow rate, you can shoot yourself in the foot 
if the beer warms up too much because you still get foam.  i've noticed that 
my first pint out of the keg foams less (since i just took it out of the 
freezer), and later pints foam more when the keg (and hose) is left out on the 
basement floor.  i assume this is because the hose warms up to the 
basement air temperature and subsequent draughts are affected.  i also noticed 
at an outdoor party with my keg that if a couple of people in a row used the 
tap continuously, the hose would then (apparently) cool down a bit and the 
beer was less foamy.  at least that's what i think the reason was.

Subject: Re: Growing Hops


I recently harvested the first year crop of Hallertauer and Saaz 
hops from my western washington garden.  I had originally planned 
and built an 8 foot high trellis with horizontal lines similar to 
a clothes line.  At the last minute (the hops were six feet up 
the line) I read some literature which suggested that for maximum 
yield, hops should be grown on the highest possible vertical 
pole.  When the hop vine gets to the top of the pole and bends 
over, the rest of the vine leafs out and start producing buds.  I 
tore down all the horizontal lines and increased the height of my 
pole to 16 feet. 
 
After drying the harvest totalled 4 oz Saaz and 3 oz Hallertauer. 
Is this good for a first year harvest?  After harvesting I found 
additional literature out there on the net suggesting that the 
clothesline method is better because you can reach the cones and 
pick only the ripe ones. This allows you to get multiple harvests 
and makes it so you don't have to cut the vine when you  harvest. 
Perhaps not cutting the vine would contribute to a healthier 
harvest the next season. 
 
In summary, which hop growing method is better, a single tall 
pole, or a clothes line type trellis? 
 
Thank you, 
 
Ed Steinkamp

Good, and I welcome yours.  Most of us RIMSers are doing it much from 
the practical standpoint and may not have access to "related" 
information that is not accessed through any "homebrew" keyword. 
Multi-disciplinary viewpoints are very valuable.

I have not measured the surface temp in operation.  The heater is 72" 
when stretched out and 3/8" in diameter, which is a surface area of 
84.823 square inches.  1250 watts divided by 84.823 is 14.73 watts per 
square inch.  The 1250 watts comes from the fact that the heater is a 
5000 watt 240V model run on 110v which means that it puts out 1/4 the 
wattage (without taking into account any of the cold vs. hot 
resistance discussions which have previously taken place in the HBD). 
It produces a boost in temperature of about 1.5 degrees F per minute 
which is exactly what is recommended by Dave Miller for doing all 
grain in a pot.

If the RIMS is doing damage to it, how could I tell?  What would be

that the alpha-glucosidase was being damaged.  Any particular things 
to look for in the finished beer.

Agreed, but *I* do not do that, I slow down my pump with a motor speed 
controller.  This may be a problem for some people and is a good 
point, if it matters at all.

While I don't doubt that it may be happening, what you are talking 
about is industrial enzymology.  It may be very important to an 
industrial concern that they are losing 5% of their product to shear 
forces destroying the enzymes.  But to a homebrewer all that matters 
is that a *sufficient* amount make it into the relevant parts of the 
process TO PRODUCE GOOD BEER.

SA> relevent.  Discussions of 'proof' are not.  I think the burden of

SA> effect the wort. 
 
I can agree to that.  And I would postulate that the proof is in the 
tasting.  If I can produce beer that can win ribbons in competitions 
(not because of being the only beer, mind you) and is praised by 
judges known to be nationally recognized and experienced over dozens 
of years, then I contend that any degradation that may occur is not 
relevant to the home brewing application, even though it may be 
*extremely* relevant in industrial enzymology. 
 
I do not contend that we have nothing to learn, nor no way to better 
the process, I just think you may be splitting hairs. 
 
SA> Obviously very good homebrew can be made with a RIMS as I stated

How's this for a high adjunct load: 
 
 8 lbs. 2row 
 1.5 lbs. 40l crystal 
 1.5 lbs. Carapils 
 3/4 lb. chocolate 
 1/4 lb. black patent 
 
If that is in the range you are talking about, I do a couple of these 
a year, and the result is a wonderful beer that has no trouble 
fermenting down to where it would be expected to with that load of 
unfermentables in it.

Well, your calculations are sort of skewed.  The 2 qts should not be 
figured in because it is always in the hose and the heater chamber and 
pump.  It is not part of the liquid that makes up the mash thickness. 
I can make a mash as thick as 1.1 qts per lb. or as thin as I have 
mash tun for. 
 
While I agree that I am letting my hardware dictate my process, you 
still have not stated a reason why I would want to have a mash at 
*any* particular thickness.  The only reason I see so far is that if 
you are adding water to boost the temp, you want to start out very 
thick so you do not get too thin.  If there is *any* other reason for 
using a thick mash, please pass it on.

Again, I agree.  If the brewers technique is marginal with regarding 
to pitching sufficient healthy yeast, then *if* a RIMS caused wort 
deficient in fatty acids, then it may give problems that would not be 
present in a manual all grain mash.  All I can speak for is *my* 
results which indicate that this is not the case.  But I cannot say if 
it is because of my yeast practices or that the RIMS does not produce 
problems with fatty acids. 
 
SA> Also a RIMS probably can't take mashes as thick a those that I 
SA> usually use at dough-in and during the protein rest.

Ah finally, the key to why you have been talking about mash 
thickness.  However, many people have said that with highly modified 
American 2 row, nobody needs a protein rest anyway.  Don't get me 
wrong, I do one.  And if lack of chill haze and clarity are an 
indication that my protein rest is working, then it is. 
 
SA> Dough-in ... 
SA> Does the RIMS add to control or repeatability at this stage ? 
 
SA> It would be pretty hard to get grain balls with a 1.366qt/# mash 
SA> wouldn't it ?  I'll  concede the control repeatability point to you - 
SA> since I don't have RIMS experience, but given the mash thinness 
SA> required, I don't see this as an advantage. 
 
Again, you cannot count the extra 2 quarts.  And you are basing your 
calculations on a 7.4# grain bill.  I have never ever had a grain bill 
that low.  My lowest grain bill is about 12# which makes the two 
quarts even less meaningful if you are counting it (which you should 
not).   And yes, it is *very* hard with my setup to have any trouble 
with non-wetted grain.  I think this is a wonderful advantage.

I have to agree here and thank Steve for bringing up a *lot* of good 
points and areas to investigate for improvement.  I also do not have 
access to a lab, and frankly without one, I think anyone would be hard 
pressed to find any evidence of the problems Steve points out.  Again, 
there are lots of areas which are *prone* to fault if one designs and 
implements a RIMS in a less than optimal manner and if they slip past 
some threshold could cause faults to appear in the finished product. 
 
In the case of my RIMS system combined with the other brewing 
techniques I practice, I can find none of the faults to which Steve 
refers. 
 
I just hope Steve and I have not bored you all to tears with this

Subject: Leaking cornie fittings


 have a Cornie keg system that is fairly new. The gas dispensing fittings 
have developed annoying leaks. I have a single regulator system with a 
splitter that allows me to connect to 2 kegs at once. The distance between 
the poppet poker thing and the pin connector slots seems to be too long. Has 
something come loose? These things don't appear to be technical enough to 
involve threads between the metal coupler and the plastic crappie thing. 
(Disclaimer: It is not my kegs! They have been re-outfitted with gaskets, 
lube, etc., don't leak with the gas off and never leaked before!) 
 
When I got the system one of the gas fittings had a barely perceptible leak. 
(I could hear it hissing). Now both leak noisily and spew my precious 
homebrew all over. Yes, I get liquid leaking from my gas connection! I have 
only dispensed ~5 kegs with this system. Is it junk and should be returned or 
have I somehow done it serious wrong? (The liquid fitting behaves just fine 
evne though it gets more abuse). 
 
I do realize I can disassemble the fitting and change out a gasket but am 
incredulous that the gasket could be worn out after so little use. Has anyone 
experienced similar problems? Please help, I get a rash just thinking about 
washing bottles again.... 
 
Thanks,

Subject: Yeast culturing


 
I recently ran into an interesting idea concerning the use of tapioca 
rather than agar in producing solid growth media for slants and plates, 
and I thought I would throw it out there for those of you making your own 
yeast growth media.  Tapioca is MUCH cheaper than agar, and available in 
nearly every grocery store in the USA. 
 
Originally I saw it mentioned in a News & Views article in a recent 
SCIENCE.  I then got the reference: Current Science, vol. 70, No. 7 
(10 April 1996), pp 493-494.  This reference describes some tests 
done by the International Crops Research Institute, Patancheru, India 
using tapioca gelled media to grow tobacco explants.  They found no 
significant difference between the agar and the tapioca grown samples. 
 
The tapioca needs to be heated in some way that I have not determined. 
Perhaps it is just the normal cooking that one uses to make tapioca 
pudding?  Quoting, "On a dry weight basis, tapioca pearls contain about 
95% starch.  On heating, the starch gets converted into a complex 
polysaccharide, dextrin." 
 
There is a reference for the heating that I have been unable to get. 
Perhaps someone in HBD-land has access to it.  Hendershott,C.H., in "A 
Literature Review and Research Recommendations on Cassava (Manihot 
esculenta Crantz), National Technical Information Service, US Department 
of Commerce, Virginia, 1972 p 193 
 
Agar is generally used in a 0.7% concentration (7 grams per liter of 
medium).  Tapioca needs to be used at about 10% concentration (100 grams 
per liter of medium).

Subject: First Generation RIMS 


In #2193 Steve starts the RIMS thread with some disadvantages, and to 
be fair, says he's addressing the practical disadvantages of current 
implementations. 
Two particular issues interest me.  The first is the temperature gradient 
issue in the 
vicinity of the heating element--Dion and others made subsequent comments 
in 
#2194 and #2195 regarding the 'classic' derated, low-density element and I 
think 
those comments are valid.  There's no evidence I'm aware of that high 
gradients 
exist, nor that extraoridarily high local temperatures exist. 
 
But in any case, I feel like a lone voice here, electric heating is NOT a 
requirement 
for automatic feedback controlled RIMS.  It may be convenient, it may be 
obvious, 
it may have all manner of nice features, but it isn't required nor does it 
represent 
all 'first generation" implementations. 
 
The second is the pump shearing allegation.  I know there is at least one 
professional 
brewer who insists centrifugal pumps "ruin" the wort, and there are others 
who insist 
on using diaphragm pumps to avoid this alleged problem. Although brutal 
pumps are 
indeed standard fare for all RIMS systems I've actually seen, it certainly 
doesn't have 
to be that way for first generation systems.  Manual recirculation (gravity 
and work) 
can be used successfully--continuous recirc isn't a RIMS requirement, 
either.  I also 
believe (but haven't shown) that peristaltic pumps can be built at home 
that may look 
very primitive but work well without pounding the wort. 
 
Finally, is there a practical difference between a thick mash and a 
suitably compacted 
one?  If I maintain a false bottom AND a false cover such a distance apart 
as to render 
the mash bounded in between them at a given consistency, does it matter 
that there is 
10 cm of mash liquor above the false cover and below the false bottom? 
 
Think about that, brewgeeks!

Subject: Honey fermentability


It is often said that honey will ferment completely when added to beer. I 
think this is not so. As any meadmaker will tell you, a solution of honey 
will not ferment 100%. My meads have rarely gone below 998. It is true, 
though, that honey will contribute nice flavours and a somewhat drier 
mouthfeel, but it will not ferment completely. 
Anyone had different experiences?

Subject: Judging schedules


Hi. Can anyone send me a schedule for judging beers (ie points for 
appearance, head, aroma, flavour etc. and associated  guidelines for 
assessing these). 
 
The reason is that I've been asked by a local fair to act as a judge in a 
home brewing competition. I should point out that this is pretty small scale 
and that expectations are not terribly high - there will only be a few 
categories (lager style, ales, dark beers and stouts probably) and for all I 
know we may only get extract or even kit brewed entrants so it may not be 
appropriate to go into overkill with heaps of critical notes etc. (If any 
brewers in Sth Gippsland get this posting my apologies in advance!) 
Nevertheless, some master brewers may crawl out of the woodwork, so it's 
wise to be prepared, as far as possible. Any criticism of the judging will 
be taken in the nastiest way possible, ie those criticising will be invited 
to judge next year! TIA

Subject: Sparging? Why bother?


In perusing the last few weeks of the HBD, it seems that a significant 
fraction of the discussions revolve around sparging techniques.  From 
the perspective of a homebrewer with only one goal in his brewing -- 
quality -- I have a simple question: 
 
WHY BOTHER! 
 
If you're brewing commercially, the question is obvious: sparging is 
essential to running an economically viable operation.  For a 
homebrewer, however, the cost savings of wringing a few more points per 
pound from the grain is almost insignificant, especially if your goal is 
to brew the highest quality beer, and is certainly not worth investing 
lots of time and effort in devising improved methods. 
 
"No sparge" (a/k/a "first runnings") brewing is not a new idea; indeed, 
Dr. Fix discussed it in the HBD a couple of years ago, and I've seen it 
mentioned here occasionally since then.  Yet, despite the fact that 
every expert I've ever discussed it with (including George Fix and Paul 
Farnsworth) categorically state that "no sparge" brewing makes for a 
maltier, higher quality wort, most homebrewers still insist on (and 
obsess over) this aspect of the brewing process. 
 
I submit that for small scale amateur brewers who are interested 
primarily in quality, sparging is a complete waste of time.  By simply 
mashing one third more grain than normal, you can extract more than 
enough points for your desired gravity, and without having to conduct a 
lengthy sparge, monitor pH or SG during the runoff, or risk leaching 
tannins or other undesirables from the grains.  The added expense is 
just not that great, especially if you're buying your grain by the 
sack.  [If you are bothered by the "waste" of the fermentables left in 
the grain, then you can make "small beer" or yeast starter from the 
remnants by steeping them in hot water while you boil the main mash.] 
 
I realize that this position borders on heresy in some traditionalist 
quarters.  Then again, so did the concept of a round world at one time. 
What sayeth the collective wisdom of the HBD on the subject?

Subject: Letting it settle


Dear Friends, 
 
In #2195, Mark "Brew Hard" Bayer writes: 
 
"here's an idea:  use a 7 gallon carboy to put the chilled wort+trub 
in. you can aerate/pitch your yeast at this point, depending on 
temperature, then wait for the trub to settle." 
 
This idea, of course, has been discussed by Dave Miller in his books. 
 One thing that always has puzzled me about this is the practice of 
pitching the yeast immediately after the bitter wort is placed in the 
setting vessel, then racking it all off into a new vessel a couple 
hours later.  I understand fully the rationale behind pitching the 
yeast ASAP.  But unless one has done a very good job with having a 
large starter at the peak of pitchability (I do NOT mean to reopen 
that old bashfest about when that is) and has aerated the bejeeezus 
out of the wort, I think it is fair to say that many of us do not see 
dramatic activity in the first 2-3 hours (and please, no posts saying 
"I get ten feet of foam in the first 5 seconds" -- I know some of us 
here have outstanding lag performance. I am talking about the rest of 
us poor bastards.).  In such a case most of the yeast are sitting 
there in the junk at the bottom of the settling tank and are left 
behind when the liquid is transferred to the primary. 
 
My point is, and this is also my practice, if one has a well-sealed, 
sanitized container, then one need not pitch right away.  Let it 
settle, then transfer to the primary, leaving most of the gunk 
behind, and *then* pitch.  I have been doing this for several dozen 
batches now and have not had a single problem (and hey, you know 
what? All my fermeters are plastic too).  I know: "Works for me" is 
not proof.  I mean only to point to a possibility. 
 
Mark also wrote: 
 
"by the way, i measure my extraction by using both the pre-racking 
volume and the post racking volume.  the numbers i come up with are 
usually about 28 or 29 for post racking volume, and 31-33 for 
pre-racking volume.  which volume do most of the rest of you use?" 
 
I use both, to get two pieces of complementary information.  I 
measure my extraction after sparging, using the volume that I got 
from that process, to get an idea how well I mashed and sparged.  I 
use the gravity as it goes into the primary to measure how much loss 
I get from boiling, settling, transer, etc etc.  The first number 
lets me keep some kind of track on the variables to do with mashing 
and sparging (grain lot, crush, pH, etc) and the second on the 
overall efficiency of my system, given the performance that the 
system gave during the mash and sparge. 
 
Cheers, Dave in Sydney

Could what you describe be "tartness?"  The Wyeast #1098 has a "tart" 
flavour, in my opinion.  On another topic, the Victory malt (like the 
Biscuit mentioned in my other post today) contains starch.  It also 
has virtually no enzymes.  It will give you little more than a starch 
haze.  Finally, Laaglander Dried Malt Extract is very unfermentable. 
Typical apparent attenuations can be between 55 and 60%.  It has it's 
place in low-gravity beers or sweet beers, but I wouldn't use it for 
100% any normal-gravity beer: it would come out way too sweet.

The key to setting up a draft system (despite many people having questioned 
this -- I suspect that those have never set one up properly) is to have 
the beer line long enough so that the flow is slow enough so that the 
CO2 does not come out of solution.  Too long a line simply means that the 
flow will be too slow.  As someone else posted, the pressure drop from 
the keg to the end of the faucet will always be equal to the pressure 
that the keg sees from the CO2 regulator.  As the beer line length 
increases, the pressure drop per foot (which is a function of flow rate) 
decreases.  Simultaneously, the flow rate drops. 
 
As for the eddy currents and nucleation, I simply relayed what was posted 
by someone explaining the shaken-bottle gushing puzzle.  If you don't 
believe that this is a factor, take two 50F bottles of beer.  Shake them. 
Open one immediately and the other after another hour at 50F.  If you can 
explain the difference in the results without the "eddy current" solution, 
then I'd be interested in reading it.  Clearly whatever phenomenon caused 
the foaming in the bottles also causes it in kegs -- THAT'S why I recommended 
waiting the hour to serve after force-carbonation shaking.
