Greetings gang, 
 
I'm sure this has come up many times, but I haven't been part of 
this list for very long so please bare with me. 
 
I am looking for a Sam Adams Cream Stout extract recipe.  I have 
checked Cat's Meow and noticed a Watneys recipe which I may well use, 
but I'd prefer to try the Sam Adams style first. 
 
Can anyone help?

Subject: RIMS - heating


 
Dion Hollenbeck notes that he applies 1250 watts thru a 84.8 sq.inch 
heating element surface in his RIMS.  Ken Schwartz notes that this is 
equivalent to a 10.5 inch diameter disk.  Using such a large surface 
area RIMS heating element at 1250 watts certainly answers my objection 
about hot spots.  Even tho the real heating area of a burner+sanke is 
larger, the heat flux is not so evenly distributed (because stainless 
is a mediocre conductor) so this large heating element may even be an 
inprovement over burner heating. 
 
I suspect that many RIMS are designed with much smaller heating 
elements and at higher power.

in my opinion, it's probably spaten ur-marzen oktoberfest.  this product is 
quite widely available compared to some other fine bavarian beers. 
particularly, i believe, this time of year.

harrington is a domestic 2 row pale malt.  yes, traditionally, munich/vienna 
malt is used for marzenbier.

i think it's pretty hard to hit the malt

This is just a fact that I've observed, and is advertised as being 
beneficial by Al cookware manufacturers, so don't go around quoting it 
as gospel.  I don't have a book handy for the thermal conductivity 
properties of Al or Fe, so if any metallurgists are out there... 
 
I would think SS is preferred because it is much more non-reactive, 
meaning it can be cleaned easier.

I know the aluminum pots are $70, but what I was referring to is the 
Calphalon and similar products which are bonded or some such 
manufacturing process, and which run about $70 dollars for a decent 
sized stock pot.  My local restaurant supply house has the $70 40 
qt. pot, so I'll stop by and check it out this week. 
 
As for Al causing Alzheimer's, the researchers were looking at 
aluminum levels in drinking water.  In this case it makes no 
difference what you use to cook or store your food in.  Where the 
hysteria got started, I've no idea.

Subject: Stainless Vs. Aluminum - Try this...


After considerable research and shopping, I have purchased what I think 
is the ideal brew pot (for me, anyway). 
 
I found a heavy duty 32 Qt SS pot w/ lid WITH a 5mm aluminum clad 
bottom (for better heat distribution) for a net/net price of $138 (list $219). 
The manufacturer is Dura-Ware, but some places also referred to it as 
Excalibur.  It is Korean-made, but it is definitely NOT typical department 
store Korean quality - it is very heavy weight (12 lbs), and has 
welded-on handles rather than rivets.  Since the aluminum is 
sandwiched between the SS, no aluminum is exposed at the surface, so 
you need not be concerned about Alzheimers, etc, etc.  The 8 gallon size 
is perfect for my typical 6-gallon all-grain, full-boil batches brewed on my 
kitchen stove - inaugural batch was successfully completed yesterday. 
 
Here's where to get it: Empire Restaurant Supply  (ask for Sheldon) 
                                     114 Bowery St 
                                     New York NY 10013-4791

They begrudgingly do mail-order and accept plastic (Visa). 
 
All disclaimers apply - this is the only time I've dealt with them - delivery 
was 1 week.

Subject: Localized Heating / Enzyme Loss


Ken Schwartz (KennyEddy`at`aol.com) stated 
 
>>>The wort at the very bottom of 
the kettle is bearing the brunt of 
the heat transfer, just as the wort 
next to the heating element is.  To 
me, this pretty much means that 
*the wort can't tell the 
difference*!!<<< 
 
I think this sums up the situation 
quite accurately! In fact, it is 
highly likely that the heat 
localization is far worse in the 
kettle, than within the RIMS 
heating chamber. Unless you have 
vigorous agitation throughout your 
heatup period, it's likely that you 
will see carmelization in the 
bottom of your kettle. Evidence of 
localized overheating? Perhaps Dion 
and others can address their 
experiences with the electric 
inline element. 
 
On a related RIMS note... 
Enzymes will not readily denature 
from shear imposed by a centrifugal 
pump. Excess thermal exposure is 
the culprit. Whether you regulate 
circulation flow using variable 
speed or valve throttling, your 
enzymes will survive. :)

Subject: RIMS and Variable Speed Pumps


Several knowledgeable folks have 
expressed the advantage of reduced shear 
when using a variable speed controller 
to regulate circulation flow, versus 
throttling back on the pump outlet 
valve. Let me caution that before anyone 
just slaps a controller on their 
existing pump, they should confirm that 
the pump can operate continuously at 
reduced speed. Most motors rely on self 
induced fan cooling. When the rotational 
speed id reduced, fan speed is reduced, 
cooling is reduced, and at some point 
the motor will overheat. Generally if 
the motor HP rating is well above the 
required load, a reduced fan speed will 
still provide sufficient cooling. When 
in doubt, check with the motor supplier.

You don't actually _need_ dwarf hops, though. Most cultivars will accomo- 
date themselves with whatever is available, and if there is nothing to 
climb on they will form a bush-like structure. The yield will not be as 
good, but better something than nothing.

I'm pretty sure that Paulaner is the Guiness of Oktoberfests.  It is 
considered the benchmark by which all others are judged.  It's usually easy

I agree that Munich malt is essential to the style, but it doesn't surprise 
me that SA doesn't include it in the grain bill.  This is a cost-cutting 
measure, since it is easy to deceive virgin American pallates with only a 
little crystal malt.  This is consistant with most all of Sam's beers. 
Pete's, too.  Is SA trying to deceive us by putting crystal AND caramel 
malt on the lable?  Aren't they the same thing?  BTW, Harrington is a 
standard American 2-row pale malt variety, much like Klages.  Nothing 
exotic there, either.

Al K. commented on a recipe I submitted (I was asking for help on IBU 
calculation) by saying: 
>Well, first I'd like to note that the Belgian Biscuit malt has starch in 
>it and neither the Biscuit nor the Crystal have any enzymes to convert it. 
>The Biscuit is therefore adding very little other than a starch haze to

OK, this makes sense.  So does this mean that Biscuit should be avoided unless 
doing all-grain or partial mashes where you have pale malts to provide the 
enzymes needed? 
 
Which brings up my next question- For my next batch (a porter) I have a pound 
of biscuit (too much?) already mixed and cracked with a half pound of black 
patent.  Since there are obviously no enzymes in the equation, should I get a 
pound of pale malt and do a partial mash ala Papazian(113-122 degrees F for 30 
min., 150 degrees F for 10 min., 158 degrees F for 10-15 min.) or just steep 
what I have and get a hazy beer (I can think of worse problems)? 
 
Thanks to all who responded to my origanal IBU question.

Subject: Quality Judging a Longshot


The following is an excerpt of the letters I sent to Kate Begley, Co 
Director of the Longshot Homebrew Competition of Boston Beer Company and 
the Director of Sanctioned Competition Program of the American Hombrew 
Association: 
 
"My receipt of score sheets from the Boston Beer Company's World 
Homebrew Competition was very disappointing. As one who has always been 
counseled to include constructive criticism on score sheets, judge the 
beer according to the style, and fully fill out the sheet, I was 
saddened with the job the two "experienced" judges did on my Belgian 
Pale Ale entry. 
 
Other than their scores of 26 and 29, not much else agreed in their 
assessment of my brew. Their Description Definitions (check off boxes on 
the left of the sheet) never agreed, one judge did not sign his/her 
name, saw fit to write only three full words on the sheet, and leave me 
to guess what he/she was thinking. The other judge signed the sheet with 
initials, wrote a few more words but offered no constructive criticism. 
In reading their few comments, I have to wonder if these "experienced" 
judges have ever tasted the style before. 
 
Having organized one and now organizing another homebrew competition, I 
know enough to pair seasoned judges with apprentice judges. It is not 
fair to give a score that brands the beer "Exemplifies style 
satisfactorily, but requires attention" and not give the brewer any 
constructive feedback. I judged 21 beers in one day two weeks ago at 
Topsfield Fair Homebrew Competition. Every score sheet I wrote included 
positive feedback and advice when possible. 
 
I can live with the score, but the quality of the score sheets was 
unacceptable. Brewers enter competitions for FEEDBACK among other 
things. I have to wonder if you approve of the way competition was run 
in this case. Two other brewers wrote of extremely similar results from 
the competition on the electronic forums Homebrew Digest and JudgeNet. 
 
Why didn't Boston Beer Company pair veteran judges with non-certified 
judges? Does the AHA review the score sheets completed after a 
competition in order to audit quality or do you just take the sanction 
fee and call it a day? Your literature states, "To maintain valid 
standards of judging and achievable levels of excellence." When my club 
needs to be sanctioned for this upcoming competition, we'll be sure to 
call the BJCP instead." 
[End of Letter's body] 
 
 I know this thread has been getting some attention lately. Both here 
and in Judgenet. I wonder how many people got their beer judged by two 
or more "judges" who were so lax as to neglect to use actual WORDS on 
the sheet... I wish I could publish the actual score sheets for HBD readers. 
It wouldn't take long to read them. 
 
This isn't a matter of the subjective nature of judging. It is a matter 
of following judging guidelines and protocol. 
 
Finally, my question to the collective: If a competition breaks the 
rules set down by the sanctioning organization, whether AHA or BJCP,  is 
anything ever done by the sanctioner to correct the situation? How are 
repeat problems identified and avoided in the future? Is there any policing 
of quality? 
Any thoughts on this?

Subject: octoberfest


Tom, you asked: 
"OK, I don't know much about the Oktoberfest style.  I just picked up a 
six 
of Sam Adams Oktoberfest.  I know Sam is usually an "Americanized" 
(watered down) version of most styles, so I'm asking, what commercial 
brew 
is to Oktoberfest  what Guinness is to Stout?" 
 
I recently picked up a 12 pack of Warsteiner Octoberfest at the local 
TOPS on sale for 9.99.  What a wonderful beer.  I do not know if it 
defines the style, but I recommend it highly.

As well as being a neophyte home brewer, I am a business consultant and 
occasional entrepreneur. I am interested in finding some information on how to 
open a small microbrewery/restaurant. If any of you out there have any general 
information on how to do it, where to buy used commercial brewing equipment, 
and any other bits of wisdom, I would appreciate it.

Subject: In Defense of Honeybees


Mark Bayer posted a warning about bees. I was not present either at the 
time of his observation nor at the unfortunate incident where an alergic 
beer drinker smallowed a stinging insect  (a friend of mine had the 
misfortune to witness an identical mishap in Germany a few years back) but 
I am guessing that it was not bees that were at fault but rather yellow 
jackets. The reasons for this are that it is now the height of yellow 
jacket season. Conversely, honeybees were just about wiped out in this 
country last winter by a combination of cold weather and mites. 
Yellowjackets are omnivorous and are attracted to most of the things humans 
like to eat. Conversely bees are only attracted to certain sweet smells. I 
have stood in an apiary drinking beer and never attracted a bee. 
 
Bees are easily distinguised from yellow jackets by the fact that they are 
fuzzy (the hairs collect pollen) and the rear legs are widened into 
"baskets" to which they transfer pollen collected during visits to flowers. 
Relative to yellow jackets they are "cute". Their colors are not so vivid 
as yellow jackets  on which the yellow is quite bright. Only Italian bees 
are at all light in color. The more popular "breeds" are quite dark. As the 
only bees you are likely to see these days are domestic ones, the chances 
are that they will be quite dark in color. If you don't live within a 
couple of miles of a beekeeper you aren't likely to see any at all. 
 
All this does not mean that Mark's warning should be ignored. I ate a 
yellow jacket in a chicken sandwich once and would not repeat that 
experience willingly. The good news is that yellow jackets have less venom 
and their delivery sytem is such that you get less of it (the honeybee 
loses her stinger, venom sack and the muscles to keep pumping even after 
she is gone; the yellow jacket stinger is smooth and is withdrawn when the 
insect leaves the scene. 
 
One interesting thing to note about beer and honeybees: iso-amyl acetate is 
their alarm pheremone. If the breeze is just right you can smell it when 
they sting.  Don't wander into a bee yard with a freshly poured glass of 
your best Weizen!

Just to add a few thoughts to this thread, I spent most of my life in 
Europe, 
and when I returned to the States, I longed for the Grolsh and Pilsner 
Urquell, 
etc of my (relative) Youth.  The "import" beer I found in the stores 
tasted 
different, and generally had a lower alcohol content. 
 
The explanation I got was that the legal definition for "beer" in the US 
specifies a maximum alcohol percentage, and that many European brews 
are above that cap and therefore have to choose between calling their 
brew a "malt liquor" or lowering the alc %.  I think the cap is in the 
high 
3% or low 4% range. 
 
Of course, the other explanation may be that foreigners are having US 
companies brew their beer for them, or that the taste changes because of 
shipping it to the US. 
 
Enough rambling...does anyone know for sure?

Subject: The leaking cornie are no more!


 
With the help of many of you, I have solved the leaking keg problem. It seems 
the new gaskets I used on the disconnects are too thin. They are black rubber 
and are obviously not the ones to use. White or clear seems to be the 
concensus. Until I can find better gaskets, I have solved the problem by 
winding thin rubber bands around the disconnects to snug up the connection. 
 
Thanks to everyone for the help,

Subject: RIMS: pump control


I am in the process of setting up a crude RIMS system.  Crude in that I 
will not initially have the electric heater, instead relying on a 
burner.  My question relates to control of the flow from the pump.  I've 
seen several systems where a ball valve on the output is used to control 
the flow from the pump.  The pump never changes speed.  This doesn't 
sound too good.  I've heard about some people using a dimmer switch to 
control the pump.  Has anyone done this?  Do any modifications need to 
be made to the dimmer switch in order for it to work?  What wattage 
switch is required?  It seems that this would be more efficient than 
controlling the output with a ball valve.

Subject: RIMS Pumps


        All the recent discussions about RIMS pumps and shearing got me 
thinking. Our pump is a little bigger that we should have purchased.  We 
have to throttle it back with an output valve to prevent the screen from 
collapsing. (Yes this happened. Crushed that sucker big time)  Works OK I 
guess, but some solid matter gets through the bottom screen and seems to 
clog the valve which is about 90% closed.  A quick twist of the valve frees 
the stuck particles and off we go but this need constant attention. 
        Back to the thinking... How about one of those high quality power 
tool speed controllers to slow down the motor?? That way I could open the 
valve all the way, slow down the pump and prevent shearing and the particles 
from clogging the mostly closed valve. Everything would be Wide Open!! 
"Hey!! Great idea", he says. But. Are not most power tools brush riding 
motors? Can I use this type of controller to slow down my common non brush 
riding AC motor on the pump without damaging it.This pump will have to run 
for HOURS on this speed controller.  Am I worrying too much?? 
 
        Mark P. and Ed B. (who is usually Pig Bitin' Mad when things don't 
go right in the brewery. And that is my responsibility so HELP ME!!) 
 
        Just to fill you in. We use a 15 gallon system and heat the mash via 
propane flame. No computers, just human attention and missed lunches. Lots 
of attention is paid to the valve and the time and temperature. I would be 
happy to automate but this looks expensive. Heating below the screen with 
propane has not given us any problems with scorches. Of course we never 
BLAST it. (Crushed the screen once from the giant pump) Never a bad beer 
here at Pudlab Brew Co. Over 1,000 gallons since 1991.

Brewsters 
 
All the discussion lately about RIMS systems reminds me of a 
simple but elegant (IMO) design for a RIMS that was posted in 
rec.crafts.brewing by a fellow Aussie back in June, but has never 
been discussed in this forum (to my knowledge). 
 
In order to add diversity to the debate (and because I am a RIMS 
wannabe) I have included the original post here, and invite comment 
on the design, pro and con.

With this system we process 11 kg of grain. Liquor gently flows from 
centre of tun up the vertical pipe and out over the top of the grain bed. 
 
Motor is controlled by variable speed controller from the hobby shop. 
 
Important to start motor very slow and then steadily build up speed 
otherwise can compact the grain bed. 
 
Element is controlled by an electronic thermostat with the sensor mounted 
 beneath the propeller and only 5mm from the element. We have never had 
scorching problems & have no build up on the element. 
 
As an extra safeguard against scorching, there is an electronic simmerstat 
in series with the thermostat. The simmerstat is set to allow power to the 
element on a 4sec on and 1 sec off cycle. 
 
This tiny Archimedes pump runs continuously during the mash and the grain 
 bed is not touched after the initial doughing in. 
 
The vertical pipe has several perforations and a sliding sleeve on the 
outside. The sleeve is used to cover the perforations during dough-in 
and to adjust the height of the liquor return point to just above the 
liquor level. 
 
With this system the pump needs to deliver a head of only 0.5cms in order 
to successfully circulate the sweet wort. 
 
For large rapid temperature changes the simmerstat can be set to continuously 
 on.

Subject: Classic American Pilsner, pt. 1


After my post in HBD 2200, I have had several requests for my Classic 
American Pilsner recipe, so below (next post, it bounced as too long) is 
my original HBD post from about a 1-1/2 years ago, typos corrected (I 
hope).  I somewhat improved it in rewriting it for Brewing Techniques, 
and the BT editors polished it further.  It appeared in the Sept./Oct., 
1995 issue. 
 
I have come to think that pre-prohibition CAP should be from 30-45 IBU 
and post-prohibition should be at least 25 IBU, although it seems that 
some beers did drop to 20 IBU post WWII.  My personal favorite is OG 
1.048 with ~22% flaked corn and 30+ IBU, and FG of about 1.014-16. 
This 
somewhat high FG results from a dextrinous wort from 30 minutes each at 
122F, 140F and 158F, then mashout.  It makes a great drinking beer. 
Pete Garofalo made a great balanced pre-prohibition CAP at 1.060 OG, 45 
IBU.  Folks (men) 100 years ago seemed to drink this strong a beer 
regularily, but then, they had only to walk a few blocks from the local 
saloon to get home. 
 
It seems at this point that only pre-prohibition will be recognized, 
with 1.050-60 OG and 30-45 IBU, as I recall, with 20 - 25% corn, and 
DMS 
acceptable or even appropriate.  Hop flavor and aroma should be 
Continental or old American varieties, and NOT modern citrusy American 
such as Cascade.  First wort hopping works wonderfully well.  American 
six-row malt is the appropriate malt, both historically and, I feel, 
for 
flavor.  The finalized new guidelines will be published in the Winter 
Zymurgy.

***Great Success in Recreating Classic American Pilsner, a Shamefully 
Neglected Style!*** 
 
Now that I have your attention, I hope you'll read this long article. 
I 
think it will be worth it. 
 
 *Soapbox mounted* 
 
Last fall I asked for help in recreating the taste of the beers I grew 
up having tastes of in Cincinnati in the fifties.  Part of the flavor I 
remembered was certainly just the pungency of beer to a child's 
sensitive palate.  But part was certainly the greater hopping levels, 
some DMS was expected, especially by mid-western palates, and just the 
greater flavor profile produced by brewing without techniques designed 
to reduce flavors (N2 wort scrubbing, neutral yeasts, minimal wort 
caramelization, etc.). 
 
Starting with the Brewing Techniques's article on Pre-prohibition 
Lagers 
by George Fix (May/June,'94) and the one on Bushwick Pilsners by Ben 
Jankowski (Jan./Feb.'94), I formulated a 1.048 OG, 1.016 FG. 80% 
six-row, 20% flaked maize, 25 IBU target beer fermented with New Ulm 
yeast from Yeast Culture Kit Co.  A good bit of the body/sweetness 
profile was produced by the short, 15 minute rest at 60C with 45 
minutes 
at 70C, giving an apparent attenuation of 67%.  If these times were 
reversed, it would probably result in an apparent attenuation of close 
to 80%, giving a drier, snappier, less satiating beer.  This is not 
what 
I wanted. 
 
Because I was mostly brewing for historical curiosity, I brewed only 
five gallons.  I now wish I'd brewed my usual 1/4 barrel, because it 
succeeded beyond my wildest expectations!  Not only did I brew a 
successful historical reproduction, THIS IS A GREAT STYLE BY ABSOLUTE, 
WORLD-CLASS STANDARDS.  American mega-breweries have to answer not only 
for the sin of what they are producing today, but for having killed off 
a great beer style.  Steam beer is not our only indigenous beer style, 
only our best known. 
 
This isn't a continental pilsner, but it yields nothing to that style 
in 
absolute terms.  Fix and Jankowski were too stinting in their praise of 
this style.  I guess I thought of it as a pretty good job that American 
brewers did making do with the materials available.  It is far more. 
This extinct beer is a WORLD CLASS STYLE.  I'm not saying that my beer 
is a world class beer, but it's pretty damn good.  It has a beautiful, 
full golden color with a long lasting, thick creamy head, full flavor 
with modest maltiness bolstered by the subtle corny sweetness, balanced 
by a clean hops bitterness and yeast character, with a long, clean 
bitter finish. 
 
We as homebrewers have helped revive other extinct styles (such as 
porter), and I propose to this group that this should be next one. 
This 
isn't lawnmower beer.  This is the beer that our grandfathers paid a 
nickel for and got a free lunch with.  This is the beer that German 
immigrants created when they arrived in the US, and that swept out the 
ales in the lager revolution by its demonstrably better quality.  This 
is the beer of American steelworkers and shipbuilders.  This is the 
beer 
that built America!  This is the bee....  Oops.  Sorry.  I got so 
excited that I fell off my soapbox. 
 
Now I know we are all fond of ales and despise American megaswill 
lagers.  We lament that ales were forced out of America by lagers.  But 
we are comparing today's commercial lagers with the ales we make or 
microbrews.  That switch would have been a tragedy, but a classic 
American Pilsner is a different beer entirely, and ales of 150 years 
ago 
were probably pretty rough. 
 
We've always heard that corn and rice are nothing more than malt 
stretchers.  American six-row barley malt is too high in protein to 
make 
stable beers, so corn was first used to dilute the protein.  Cost 
cutting was a bonus that got out of hand.  But 20% corn is a delightful 
flavor addition.  Unfortunately, I know of no commercial examples that 
still exist with that corn and malt expression, especially with decent 
hopping levels. 
 
The AHA guidelines are limiting on this.  They allow a premium American 
lager to have a maximum of 23 IBU, and say nothing about DMS - this 
generally is considered a defect.  (As a matter of fact, Fix relates 
judges who liked his beer but found it "far out of category.") But this 
flavor was expected, especially in mid-western beers.  At the Ann Arbor 
Brewers' Guild meeting last week, this beer got rave reviews from all, 
including a number of highly ranked judges.

HBDers, 
Received some more info on the rumor that the great German Monastic Brewery 
Andechs was coming to the US and opening up a Brewery. 
 
Well I talked to a German employee at B. United International, the company that
imports alot of the four star beers from Germany like Scneider Weise and 
Aventinus.  I asked him if he was attempting to acquire the Andechs beers for 
import.  He said he tried, but the Kloster told him that they were working a 
deal with a Canadian brewery (maybe Ontario?) to contract brew their beers 
there. 
 
That's the latest scoop.  You Canadian HBers have any more info?
