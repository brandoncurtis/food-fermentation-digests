Subject: Classic American Pilsner, Pt. 3: recipe


So here is the recipe for five gallons of "YOUR FATHER'S MUSTACHE," a 
Classic American Pilsner. 
 
Water: 
        9 gallons moderately (temp.) hard well water boiled to soften 
        and eliminate bicarbonate alkalinity, racked, treated 
        with 2 t. CaCl2(2H2O), target 60 ppm Ca. 
 
Grain bill: 
        7 lbs. American six row malt (80%) 
        1.75 lbs. flaked maize       (20%) 
 
Mash schedule: 
        Doughed in 8.5 qts. 58C water to get --> 
        50C protein rest, 30 min., (pH 5.5), then infused w/ 3 qts. 
boiling water to --> 
        60C sac. rest for 15 minutes, then boosted w/ burner to --> 
        70C sac. rest for 40 minutes, then boosted w/ burner to --> 
        76C mashoff for 10 min. 
 
Lautered in insulated Zapap, collected 7 gal. `at` 1.041 for 32.8 p/p/g. 
        Note - Beautifully clear wort with minimum recirculation, easy 
sparge.  This six-row is beautiful to work with. 
 
Boil - 1 hr, beautiful hot break, like egg drop soup 
 
        Hopped to 25 IBU target: 
                25 g. Cluster hops pellets `at`7.5% - 1hr boil 
                1/4 oz. Styrian Goldings `at`5.2% - 10 min. boil plus 
settling                         steep - 15 min. 
                1/4 oz. Styrian Goldings `at`5.2% - 15 min. settling 
steep. 
 
Counter current cooled to 64F, 4.75 gallons collected at 1.055, then 
diluted to 5.5 gallons at 1.048 in 7 gallon carboy, force chilled in 
snowbank to 50F.  Pitched New Ulm yeast from bottom of 3 liter starter. 
Fermented `at` 50F - 52F 12 days, racked, lagered seven weeks `at` 33F, 
kegged, conditioned with 10 psi `at` 38F, then dispensed at 42F-44F.  The 
flavor showed best at mid 40sF and when drawn to give a good head and 
reduced carbonation.  (Most beer shows best like this). 
 
I hope I have encouraged some of you lager brewers to try this style. 
It is naked brewing, as Dan McConnell commented.  There isn't any place 
to hide, so watch your techniques.  Please let me know your results, 
and 
lobby for this to be a recognized style.  I propose two divisions: 
Pre-prohibition, OG 1.150 - 1.060, 25 - 40 IBU; post prohibition, OG 
1.044-1.049. 20 - 30 IBU.  I suppose we could recognize rice rather 
than 
corn, but rice really is a flavor/body diluent.  Fix says that modern 
American lagers grew out of pre-prohibition "Western Lager," a lower 
gravity, lower hopped, rice adjunct beer that was held in "low esteem" 
by Easterners. 
 
Thanks to Martin Manning, Ed Westemeier and Lowell Hart for their ideas 
on what made the beer I remembered from the 50's, and George Fix and 
Ben 
Jankowski for their Brewing Techniques articles.

Subject: Small Cans of Malt


Just getting back into the hobby after finding a Mr. BEER (barrel) kit in a 
local store (Makes about 8 quarts per batch).  It came with a small (1.21 
lb, 550g) can of malt mix.  As I recall from earlier experience, and from 
all I can find on the internet, the usual size is about 3 times this amount. 
Anyone know where to find this size can malt extract mix?  Yes, Mr. BEER has 
a site (and mailorder) but the shipping charges are not appealing.  Thanks 
from a re-newbie.

Subject: starch in rice


I have a question regarding the composition of the starches contained in rice 
and corn. I use both of these adjuncts, along with a Klages\Harrington blend, 
in making American lagers. I currently do a cereal mash prior to gelatinizing 
the adjunct, infuse the boiling adjunct into the main mash, achieving 150 
degree saccharification temp with this addition. The main mash was at 122 
degrees prior to adding the adjunct. My question is this: Would the starch in 
either of these adjuncts be further broken down by doing a 122 degree protein 
rest, either as a part of the cereal mash or as part of the main mash? Do any 
of the the principals of malt mash temperatures apply to other types of 
starches besides malt? My goal is to achieve just a hint more dryness, 
without changing the grist\adjunct\hop ratio. I also occasionally get a 
starch haze, which I attribute to incomplete conversion of the adjunct. Would 
a protein rest for the adjunct help? 
TIA, Doug in Winnetka, CA

Well, my first batch started on Friday..  But now I seem to be having 
a problem. 
 
I followed all the directions, using 3.3lb liquid and 2 lb dry malt 
extract, and making 5 gallons of an Export Ale.  For the yeast, I used 
2 5-gram dry packs, and I started them in some warm water and then 
stirred into the wort. 
 
Now it's been a day and a half, and not much is happening.  There is a 
tiny bit of white suds on top, but no dramatic foaming or air-lock 
bubbling like I'd hoped.  It just smells kinda yeasty in there but not 
much action. 
 
What should I do?  Should I add a bit more yeast?  Should I wait a 
couple more days and take a hydrometer reading? 
 
Thanks....

        I, too, felt the same way about the stuff, but after TOO many times 
of coming to work in the morning and having to fight my way over YARDS of 
blow off, and then trying this stuff....and NEVER having a repetition of the 
problem...I was sold.... 
        I believe that the theory on head retention is based on the blow-off 
losing the very stuff that engenders head retention...and that by losing it 
to the floor, you lose retention.... 
        It is obvious to me, that, as claimed by the manufacturer, it is no 
longer in your finished product by the time that it hits serving...it is 
either attached to the 'very nicely delineated' line produced by the top of 
the ferm volume, or has dropped out..... 
        As I think you will find, does your Poly-Clar... 
        As does your 'fish-guts'..aka isinglass...or your 'sea-weed'..aka 
Irish Moss.....or your 'tendons and cartilages'...aka gelatin.... 
        (Sort of goes back to 'Reinheitsgebot,' .... (tangentially), if you 
think that they 'might' be 'adding' D.E. to the beers.....or are they just 
using something that never ends up in the finished product to "aid" the 
process?) 
        I judge my head retention by the grains I put in the batch, and 
never give the "Ferm-Cap" a second thought... 
        It just works! 
        All you can do is try the stuff......and see if it meets with your 
approval.....if it doesn't, forget it! 
        I will NEVER be without it.....

Hi Everyone! 
 
I stopped by a yard/garage sale this past weekend, and to my surprise 
there were a dozen cans of Liquid Malt Extract (LME) for sale.  So 
naturally I bought the whole lot. :^)  I recall there was a Zymurgy issue 
in the past year or so that gave International Bitterness Unit (IBU 
values for a number of Hopped LME kits, but I can't seem to put my 
hands on it.  The hopped cans were Iron City (?) Pilsner.  What  level 
of IBUs would these cans have? 
 
They also were older than the "best used before ..." date.  Would age 
affect the IBU content of the LME?  I believe the age may make the 
LME darker, but not sure about the IBUs. 
 
TIA!

Subject: Al vs Fe


Im not a metalurgist, but I am a professional cook who makes sauces in 
10-15 gal batches 3x a week.  I can tell you indoubtably, that given the 
same btu and distribution of heat, the aluminum will be a much better 
conductor.  All of our stockpots from 2qt to 20gal are aluminum.  If you 
get a cheap thin pot, yes, youll scorch, but for the most part, a nice 
heavy al pot works wonders and boils quickly.  We also cook some 
stocks/sauces that have fairly high acid contents too, and have no big 
problems with them at all. 
 
The downside is that its a soft metal and you cant clean it with any kind 
of alkali or really put the superscrub to it.  We got the wrong kind of 
scrub pads one time (meant for auto body work) and damn near wore a hole 
in one... 
 
But for a cost vs output basis, Al rules. 
 
IF the alzhiemers link and off taste link has been beaten dead then 
please let me know.  I still use a enamel coated boiltun here at the 
house, but would love to be able to do mass quanities in the kitchen at 
work just by having the guys in Maint. put an easy masher in the big pot.

Subject: Help: too much head!


Haven't gone to all-grain yet, but soon.  Brewed probably 18 batches 
batches (extract + adjuncts) in last year, and never had this problem 
before.  This 'recipe' is very similar to one I used in the past which 
turned out quite well (opinion). 
6 lb Alexander pale LME 
2 lb Hollander extra light DME 
5 cups Crystal 
1 1/2 cup chocolate 
2 cups black patent 
(later three steeped at 150 F for 30 minutes) 
4 oz malto dextrin 
1 oz bittering hops (alpha=12) 
1 oz flavor hops (hallertau, alpha=~5) 
1 oz aroma (tettnang, alpha=3.7, steeped for 3 minutes) 
1 packet Burton water salts, 
Wyeast 1098 
alcohol = ~ 5% (don't have orig-ending SPG at hand) 
after bottling, sat at ~ 70 F for one week, been in the refrig (~ 40 F) 
for one week. 
 
The problem:  Tastes O.K., don't believe it is infected.  However, when I 
open a bottle, no gushing (only a few surface bubbles visible), but when 
gently pouring into a glass, I get perhaps 3/4 inch dark brown ale, and 
the rest of the glass is filled with foam!  The foam  within about five 
minutes subsides to reasonable levels.  Who wants to wait that long for 
half a glass of beer?  Ideas?  Infected?  Too many unfermentables?  Would 
it help to uncap the bottles for a few minutes and recap?  Thanks for any 
help you can give me!

Subject: That Starchy Biscuit / Foreign Beer Brewed Here


Paul "Two-First-Names" Brian is using that yummy biscuit malt in a couple of 
non-enzymatic recipes.  Somebody who REALLY knows what they're talking about, 
jump on in here -- in the meantime, I'll suggest using some *wheat malt* to 
supply enzymes.  While pale malt will work just fine, wheat malt contains 
more enzymes than "regular" pale malt, it is quite neutral in flavor and 
color, and as a bonus is a "standard" head-retention aid in many recipes. 
 Steep your specialty grains along with 1/2-lb to 1 lb of wheat malt at 
around 155F for 30 min or (preferably) more.  A protein rest at 122F is 
optional with this small amount of wheat.  This will give you a decent 
overall conversion while not adding any more complexity (other than a bit of 
time) to your process nor altering the character of your recipe.

Tom Brouns & Anne Daugherty & Zoe Brouns and perhaps even the dog suggest: 
 
"Of course, the other explanation may be that foreigners are having US 
companies brew their beer for them, or that the taste changes because of 
shipping it to the US. " 
 
I found this to be perhaps the case in the opposite direction, when I visited 
the UK last year.  I was darkly amused to find US Swill being touted as 
"premium imported lager" in many establishments -- Coors, Bud, Miller Genuine 
Draft.  These are brewed in the UK under license by the US concerns. 
 Finally, at one point, I just had to try some.  I was quite surprised at how 
"good" the Coors tasted, compared with the US version, and this after having 
spent a week drinking "real" British offerings. 
 
I suspect that the local taste is taken into account in cases such as this.

One thing I've noticed is that it seems to only be the

While this is a novel idea, I made no comments on it to begin with 
because I have no experience with it.  The only thing which I would be 
concerned with is the longevity of the motor, the ability to 
properly isolate it from the liquid, and for the parts of it which are 
in contact with wort, the food grade materials issues.  It is 
obviously a working design, but I would be concerned over the long 
haul.  In most "hobby" motors I have seen the metallic parts are 
painted or cadmium plated.  Either of these in contact with wort is 
not good.

Greetings from the latest newbie: 
 
When bottling, should one wipe the rim of the bottle before applying a cap? 
 
I'm used to doing this for food canning, but haven't seen any references

There was such an article with lab test in Brewing Techniques, and the 
amount of Aluminum in the beer was acceptably small IMO (YMMV). 
 
Aluminum, copper, silver and several other metals have much better 
conductivity than stainless.  Stainless' advantages are in mechanical 
strength, non-reactivity, and 'workability'.  Specifically aluminum is 
quite reactive, tho' it forms an non-reactive aluminum oxide coating 
fairly quickly.  If you use acids in a freshly scrubbed aluminum pan 
you can see the selective discoloration and ... some sort of residue 
forming.  I'll leave it to John Palmer or some of the chemistry crew 
to fill in the details. Aluminum is difficult to weld w/o using 
specialised techniques and it's prone to form stress fractures.  I 
don't have the melting point handy, but it is possible to 'burn' a hole 
thru the bottom using conventional kitchen stoves.  Raw aluminum is 
probably more expensive than steel, but the chromium that goes into 
stainless is quite pricy. 
 
Why isn't everyone using it ?  Because sankes are vitually free.

Subject: Brass fittings versus copper issue


 Just a quick note...I believe it was discussed here on 
the HBD about 2 years ago, the impending prohibition of brass 
fittings in the microbrewery.  I've not heard that any further 
"progress" by the feds has been made, but just imagine the cost 
of changing over fittings in your business from brass to stainless. 
Anyone have any more recent experience with this contested issue? 
The heart of the movement by the BTAF (?) was to eliminate the 
potential for LEAD leaching into acidic liquids (wort/beer), not 
so much the issue of copper contamination.  Or so I recall...

Subject: selecting a Wyeast


Dear HBDers, 
 
thanks to all the people who emailed me with welcomes and advices. 
I am considering ALL the suggestions I received, including those 
regarding growing hops and opening my own HB shop here in Italy; 
and I must reassure everybody that we will NEVER think about baker yeast any 
more! (I personally never used it anyway). 
In fact, I am going to try for the first time a liquid yeast. 
I would try an European Ale strain because these are available 
at my UK shop, and anyway I prefer to brew European style ales 
for the moment. 
My next 3 brews will be 
1- A "Biere de Garde" (that is, a 1065 OG copper ale, malty and 
   not very hoppy) (my wife's favourite) 
2- An Old Ale, hoppier than a scotch, a stronger Old Peculier; 
3- A Barley Wine 
I would like to use the same yeast for all 3, or at least for 2; 
I have available (besides weizen and lager yeasts): 
Wyeast 1028 London Ale 
Wyeast 1098 British Ale 
Wyeast 1968 London ESB 
Wyeast 1728 Scottish Ale 
Wyeast 1084 Irish Ale 
Which one would you suggest? I would prefer an "easy" yeast, as 
it will be my first liquid one. I was thinking about #1728, but 
searching in past HBD issues I found many problems related to it. 
Would 1084 be OK, as I am going to buy it for a friend brewing a Stout? 
Or are these beers too different and it's better to use dry yeast for 
some of them (I will buy some dry yeast as a backup anyway). 
Suggestions are welcome by private email or by digest as you prefer. 
 
TIA

Well I bought this a couple of months ago on the recommendation of my 
local 
homebrew shop owner.  I sparked a thread on the UK Homebrew Digest about 
the relative merits of Dave Line (The author of this book) vs Graham 
Wheeler 
(The current UK "guru") and the concensus of opinion was that Dave 
Line's methods 
were generally outdated but they were fine in their time. 
 
Having said that I finished the first beer in the book ("Fullers ESB") 
and it turned 
out great - saccharine tablets, brown sugar, and everything, and it 
wasn't at all over- 
sweet - slightly bitter if anything.  It was brown sugar from the 
homebrew shop, 
not the supermarket - I down't know if there is any difference although 
I do know 
that some supermarket brown sugars have colouring to give the brownness.

Subject: refrigerator/stuck mash


Hi all, 
 
I have two questions for you... 
 
First, we just moved into a new place and the old tenants left behind a=20 
small refrigerator (one of those "college dorm" fridges which is perfect=20 
for a carboy).  They thought it was busted, but all it needed was some=20 
WD40.  My question is: can I use this for fermentation and lagering, or=20 
is the temperature variation too much?  I see that Greg Walz has=20 
instructions for constructing a temp controller on the Brewery, but I've=20 
never done any electrical/electronics stuff before and I'm concerned=20 
about safety.  Any thoughts? 
 
Second, over the weekend I tried a partial mash brown ale and had problems 
with a stuck mash.  I'm trying to figure out what might have caused it.=20 
This was the first time I tried to use my bottling bucket as a combination 
mash/lauter tun.  I used a second bucket with holes for a false bottom.=20 
This sits about 1.5-2 inches above the bottom of the bottling bucket. =20 
Before, I would mash in my SS pot and then transfer to this bucket setup fo= 
r=20 
sparging and didn't have any problems. =20 
 
The grain bill was 4# pale malt, 1/2# brown, 1# crystal, 2 oz black, 2 oz 
light roasted barley.  The homebrew shop crushed these for me and the 
crush did not appear too fine.  I mashed at 150-153=A1=CAfor 70 minutes.  W= 
hen 
it stuck, I tried stirring the mash and blowing on the valve, neither 
seemed to work.  I wound up transferring the mash to my pot and heated 
this to 168=A1 while I cleaned out my buckets.  Neither the false bottom no= 
r 
the spigot appeared clogged.  After cleaning and transferring the mash 
back to the bucket, the sparge went great.=20 
 
I'm not sure if this could be part of my problem: from what I've read, it 
seems that I should use about 1 quart mash water per pound of grains.  In 
my case, this is about 6 qts.  Because the false bottom is almost 2 inches 
above the bottom, the mash water barely reached the false bottom.  I wound 
up adding about another 6 qts to get a decent mash consistency (not too 
thick, not too thin...).=20 
 
I'd certainly appreciate any suggestions on how to avoid this in the future= 
.. 
 
Thanks.
