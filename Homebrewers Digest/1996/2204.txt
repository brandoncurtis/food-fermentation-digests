Thanks to all who shared their opinions of the definitive Octoberfest. 
Someone asked me to post the results, so here they are: 
 
It's a tie for 1st place between Spaten and Paulaner (5 votes each).  Also

Subject: eliminate oxygen before bottling ?


Hi out there, 
 
 
Yesterday I could get an article about a big German brewery (Bitburger 
Brauerei) that is dealing with the automatic filling system they use there. 
It says that before the bottles were capped, a small beam of hot water is 
injected into the bottle to make the beer foam. That foam forces the rest of 
the air, which is in the 'unfilled' part of the bottle, out of the bottle. 
So there is no more oxygen which is able to influence the taste of the beer 
while lagering. 
I found this to be a very interesting idea I personally never would have 
thought of. 
Do any of you have experiences with eliminating the oxygen before bottling 
and if yes, how do you do it ? (Buying an automatic filling station maybe 
could be a little bit too expensive ... :-) )

Subject: Stupid Regulations


Here's my two cents on regulation by idiots: 
 
>ajdel`at`interramp.com (A. J. deLange) writes on Malt Liquor 
 
>All of the factors mentioned by Tom Brouns & Anne Daugherty & Zoe Brouns in 
the post on beer/malt liquor pertain here in the US i.e. "malt liquor" is a 
designation required by some states for any beer with alcohol content above 
a certain level. In some states such a beer must be called an "ale". Other 
examples of such foolishness abound. One sometimes sees a European import 
labeled "Malt Liquor". 
 
This falls into the same category as not being permitted to label a 
barleywine a barleywine. The BATF won't allow beer to be labeled as 
barleywine and still be sold as beer. Stupid, huh? Rather, you must label it 
as barleywine-style to get around the BATF crap about "spirits." 
 
Another one is labeling, again, let's thank the BATF for protecting us from 
"evil" persons: If you produce a commercial brew, you have to submit samples 
of the final label to the BATF for their blessing. Well, guess what, if your 
printer remixes your colors and they are off even slightly, the BATF not 
only wnats you to redo the label submission, but they can fine you or close 
you down if you distribute your product with the "different" labels. 
 
Doesn't this make you wonder about all of the wonderful, flowery stuff the 
feed our kids in school about democracy and "a government of the people, for 
the people"? If that was true, the BATF wouldn't be there. All they do is 
take money and harass shopkeepers. 
 
Vote "None of the Above" for everything. 
 
MIke.

In-Reply-To: The Homebrew Digest 
 
Have you ever noticed.. 
Last nite I was crushing three pounds of munich and one pound of vienna for 
a partial mash, when I noticed a small mushroom in the hopper.  I rescued it 
from the grinder and placed the little dried bugger on the windowsill.  (I 
hope the wife doesn't find and discard him).  It looks like a species I think 
I should be able to identify, but I'll need a book.  Anyway, anybody else ever 
find a fungal specimen in their pre-grind?  The brand was Ireks 2-row. 
I optimistically ignored the significance of my saprophitic friend, watched 
for any of his kin, ground, mashed and brewed as if nothing were wrong. 
I doubt I'll make acid beer :-(, as I doubt it was ergot (ergot doesn't have 
fruiting bodies, does it?).  I can see the scoresheet now... "The colors, the 
colors!" 
Seriously, does anybody know if their exists a harmfull or detrimental (or 
beneficial, for that matter) fungal infection that may manifest in the grain?

Actually, I did use Cluster, with fine results (see my recipe repost in 
HBD 2202).  I wanted to use it for authenticity the first time, and was 
willing to risk (once) the "coarseness" that I had seen it described as 
having.  I found that it provided a fine, apparently neutral, clean 
bitterness when used in the boil.  I didn't use it for flavor or aroma 
additions. 
 
Since that first brew, I have seen that Mark Garetz (Using Hops) says 
"it has a very smooth, neutral bitterness with no objectionable 
characteristics.  It is a great base bittering hop for any beer."  After 
trying it once, I've continued to use it, feeling that it is neutral at 
worst, and may even contribute some subtle, old fashioned flavor.

Subject: keg conversion


Hello all, 
 
I am attempting to design my new three tier brewery.  I just obtained the 
1/2 kegs.  Originally I had planned to simply drill a 1/2" hole and use 
washers, compression fittings and teflon tape to hold the ball valve in 
the bottom side of the kegs (instead of having them welded). 
 
My question are 
 1. Does anybody currently their drain valves connected to the 
    keg in this fashion? 
 
 2. Does the constant heat at such high temperatures affect the 
    washers (i.e., do they melt)? 
 
 
TIA, 
 
Tom Neary

Subject: Wyeast 3068 and Weizen


     Hi again! 
 
     Last week I asked people about how to reduce esters and increase 
     phenols in Weizen made with 3068.  Thanks to all who responded (there 
     were many). 
 
     Andy Walsh suggested aerating at pitching and again at 24 hours, so I 
     split the batch and did that to one fermenter. 
 
     The weird thing is, the batch aerated only at pitching took off like a 
     banshee, while the "over" aerated batch is plodding along in a pretty 
     subdued fashion!  The only thing I can attribute this to is that the 
     second fermenter (the volcanic one) was filled with the second half of 
     my kettle runnings.  Because I remove hot break by whirlpooling it is 
     possible that more trub got sucked out into the second fermenter. 
 
     This probably invalidates the experiment (as Andy pointed out in 
     personal E-mail), but I'll let you all know what happens anyway. 
 
     Have fun!

Subject: RE: Newbie probability / Stuck Mash / RIMS Stuff


     Howdy folks! 
 
     In response to the Newbie's problem (long lag time), I ask, "Did you 
     aerate your wort?"  If not, that is a BIG part of your problem.  The 
     yeast need adequate O2 to get started, especially when underpitching, 
     which is what you (and most of us) do. 
 
     For your future batches, try making up a starter culture and pitching 
     it into your wort at high krausen.  It takes a bit more planning, but 
     it's worth it. 
 
     I save some wort from each batch of beer to use as starter media. 
     Simply take some out of the boiler at the end of the boil, dilute it 
     to a low gravity (if it is a high gravity wort), boil and can it. 
     Dave Miller has some great stuff on this in all three of his Homebrew 
     Books (not the Pilsner one, though). 
     -------------------------- 
     Jim Murphy writes about his stuck mash.  It sounds like you have 
     learned the value of FOUNDATION WATER.  Yeah, it took me a while to 
     figure that one out, too!  Simply fill your lauter tun with hot sparge 
     water to a depth of ~1/2" over the false bottom.  Purge the tun with 
     CO2 (if you have the equipment), then dump in the mash. 
 
     I haven't had a stuck mash since I started doing this on batch # 3 
     (except for my 60% rye batch)! 
 
     Also, be careful not to let the wort flow to quickly from the lauter 
     tun, especially at the beginning.  That can make the grain bed too 
     tight and inhibit flow tremendously. 
     --------------------------- 
     Now for my woes... 
 
     I've used my RIMS system twice now, once for a single step infusion, 
     and the second time for a single decoction.  I have the following 
     observations: 
 
     1. My heater is too small to boost the temp AT ALL.  I thought, since 
     I mostly decoction mash, that a smaller heater would be OK, because I 
     would just need it for temp maintenance and perhaps boosting the temp 
     a couple of degrees if I undershot my mark.  It won't even do that 
     much, so I need to get a new way to heat my mash! 
 
     2. The wort is not as clear as the wort I collected for my "Zap-Pap" 
     lauter tun.  I'm still not sure about why this is, but I think it is 
     because my kettle outlet is too high up on the side, therefore any 
     fine draff that gets through the screen stays on the bottom of the 
     kettle, where it is slowly and occasionally sucked out.  This keeps my 
     wort from clearing well. 
 
     The solution is to PAY a welder, rather than have the spigot put on by 
     a friend of a friend's friend! 
 
     3.  I have EXTREME difficulty controlling my lautering rate.  The 
     second time was worse than the first time (oddly).  I think this is 
     because the second time I put the kettle up on the stove BEFORE 
     filling it with wort (the first time I LIFTED 13 gallons of 150F 
     liquid up to the burner.  I'm sometimes pretty stupid...). 
 
     There was a 3' height difference between my mash/lauter tun and 
     boiler.  If I ran the pump too slowly, the wort flowed back into the 
     mash tun (I was pretty surprised to find the mash tun becoming MORE 
     FULL while the boiler seemed to be emptying!  Gravity works!).  If I 
     ran the pump faster, it had no trouble moving the liquid, but it moved 
     it TOO quickly, hurting my extraction.  I just couldn't reach that 
     happy medium! 
 
     In the end I had collected 16.5 gallons of wort that needed to be 
     boiled down to 11.2 gallons to achieve the gravity I wanted.  That 
     took FOUR hours!  So much for the RIMS advantage of saving time! 
 
     Well, that's it folks.  If any more experienced RIMS types would like 
     to offer any help, it would be, um, helpful... 
 
     Thanks, Have Fun!

<Re: The Definitive Oktoberfest 
 
For Germans I like Wurzburg, Paulaner (and/or Hacker Pschor, merged brewers) 
and Spatan.  Usually in this order of preference.  In the US very few micros 
or contracts are brewed from grists predominant in Vienna and Munich malts. 
This is key to the style as noted many times here in the recent past.  For 
homebrewers Id recommend mostly Vienna, a tad of Munich and a touch of 
CaraMunich.  Double decoct and keep the IBUs below 25, below 20 is even 
better.

I think you are being a bit harsh on the description of Festbier as served

Andy asks about using a false bottom in his boiler: 
 
< I have just made a 
<false bottom with 1/8" holes and about 1/2" clearance from the bottom of 
<the keg and am wondering if I stand to get serious carmelization.  Has 
<anyone done this before and able to save me from weeks of cleaning if 
<there's going to be a problem. 
 
I do this but my hole size is smaller as I use the same screen for the 
false bottom in my lauter tun as I do in my boiler.  I use whole hops and 
they tend to settle nicely on top of the false bottom.  A catch of some 
type is useful prior to the counterflow chiller as some particulates can 
get through the screen.  The screen does get heavily laden with trub so 
cleaning is an issue.  I scrub it with hot water and then do a caustic clean 
prior to use. 
 
Al writes about hop storage: 
 
<Ziplock freezer bags

True but over the timeframe of a year the losses are minimal when kept in 
a freezer.  Micros using whole hops do keep them im a freezer/cold room but 
usually dont even close the hop bale between uses.  Of course the bale only 
lasts a few months but the losses are very small at very cold temps. 
 
Al continues about keg Orings for the liquid/gas fittings: 
 
<Also, I would

Well, Ive taken to get them at Home Depot for about 10 cents and they work 
fine.  This seal is not in contact with beer much if at all. 
 
<While you may be able to find the right size o-ring at Ace hardware, it

If its good enough for my drinking water then I think its OK.  Granted if

<If you have a story about a micro-unfriendly distributor in your area, or a

Fact of life. It happens.  Happens here in Md, and A/B would love to retain 
"brand purity" of its distributers.  And going against Sam Adams is not easy 
for the small brewers either.

Subject: Re: Beet vs. Cane sugar


In reading the posts debating this, I cant help but notice that no one 
answered the original question which started this thread: 
 
   Can I use sugar beets for brewing? 
 
 The answer (IMO) is yes, but your beer will probably have some bizarre 
taste characteristics that would cause you to feed it to the slugs. 
 
 Sugar beets are awful.  They smell bad, they (apparently) taste bad, and 
they are only used for processing into sugar.  As far as I know, sugar beets 
are never actually EATEN by anyone.  So if you want a beer that stinks, use 
some sugar beets! 
 
  For more discussion about the earthy smell of beets, check out Tom Robbins' 
"Jitterbug Perfume", a book about beets that is best enjoyed with a homebrew.

Subject: X-mas Ale


 
I am trying to recreate a X-mas ale that I brewed  over a decade ago, using 
a kit from a place called "Wine and the People" (no kidding), located 
somewhere around San Francisco.  They are now defunct.  The information 
supplied was sketchy and is now long gone.  The stuff was great, similar to 
Wild Goose s "Snow Goose" in color and hoppiness, only better.  I think I 
have recreated the body and strength using 6.6 lb of  light liquid malt, 3 
lbs. of light DME, and 1 lb of crystal malt steeped. I don t know the 
original yeast variety, but It was recently suggested that I try a German 
ale yeast. I know cask ale yeast worked well, but I need some guestimates on 
: 
1) LVB of Crystal to give best deep red but not brown color. Is 60 ok? 
2) Amount and schedule of Eroica and Styrian Goldings to add for a high, yet 
balanced degree of hoppiness. I know these were the hops used and want to 
stick with them.  As I recall, the Eroica went in at the beginning of a one 
hour boil and the Styrian Goldings (whole hops) were bagged in at the end of 
the boil and kept in the primary for several days.  I have 2oz of pellets 
for each of these varieties, but don t want to over bitter. Well, maybe just 
a bit.

The concept of an "oxygen barrier" polymer for long term storage of hops is 
quite flawed.  Polyethylene has a permeability of between 55 and 0.4 
barrers depending on polymer density and crystallinity (a 'barrer' is a 
unit that represents volume permeation rate per area per pressure driving 
force and is commonly used in gas permeation literature).  Ziplock type 
bags are at the higher end of this range. 
 
The lowest oxygen permeability I found was for polyvinylidene chloride 
(Saran <TM>) which was at 0.05.  While this will provide up to a 1000 times 
reduction in permeability, there will still be significant oxygen 
permeation through this sort of barrier within a fairly short time.  With 
the exception of natural rubber, almost anything is better than PET, but 
you can certainly do better.  In addition, as polymers age, permeability 
increases.  Note:  the low temperature will also decrease permeability due 
to a glass/rubber transition, but I'm not sure about where this happens for 
commonly used polymers. 
 
The solution?  Glass mason jars.  The permeability of glass is constant (at 
zero) and the only opportunity for permeation is at the lid/glass contact 
point which is a tightly compressed seal.  And you don't have to buy 
special plastic bags either. 
 
No affiliation with the glass people, the masons, or the jar people....

2112 is very flocculant, i.e. it settles out pretty quick. I'll bet most of 
the yeast was left behind in your primary. 
 
I didn't realize this last time I used this yeast, and had a very long, drawn 
out secondary fermentation. Next time, I think I may try agitating the 
secondary every few days, to keep more of the yeast in suspension until 
fermentation is complete...

     Aluminum is indeed a much better conductor than SS.  IMO, stainless is 
     a superior pot in every other way.  The ultimate compromise is a 
     Vollrath style kettle.  They have an Aluminum clad heating surface 
     (the bottom is Aluminum on the outside), but the kettle is 304 
     stainless.  Pricey, yes.  I bought a 15 gallon for US $189, but it

Subject: Banana beer update


The Almighty Collective, 
 
     You may recall me as the person with 10 pounds of 
bananas burning a hole in my larder. 
 
     I decided to experiment with them in a nondescript 
bohemian pilsner (no thought to it, just next beer in the 
que).  I pureed the bananas in a blender and "mashed" 
them with pectin enzyme (from the biohazard winery) 
for 6 hrs at room temperature.  The puree turned into 
a liquid due (presumedly) to the action of the enzyme. 
I considered filtering it somehow, but ended up dumping the 
whole mess into the secondary. 
 
     As I expected, a violent additional fermentation ensued. 
It left an impressive amount of gunk in the carboy, however 
it cleared nicely.  I kegged it with a 1/2 cup of corn sugar. 
 
     Impressions at time of kegging.  Beautiful amber color, 
nice polished look, no carbonation of course, 
smells like bananas.  First sip detects a very sharp 
astringency, almost tannic.  Then a titlewave (excuse me, 
storm surge) of banana.  Finer points like hop aroma 
and maltiness are wiped out by the strong banana aroma. 
A pilsner was probably not a good choice for this experiment. 
A more aggressive style would handle the overwhelming 
flavor better, maybe a nice stout. 
 
     Reminds me of Celis's Raspberry Ale, fruit flavor over- 
powering and annoying (can choke down one bottle in a 
pinch).  Well, its off to lager for a month and sit around 
for a while after that.  Hopefully the banana will fade a bit. 
 
Questions: 
 
1.  Is the tannic bite caused by tannins?  I didn't think 
bananas had any.  In the peel? 
 
2.  If so, should I use a fining agent to decrease 
the tannins?  Polyclear or gelatin? 
 
3.  Is my pilsner ruined?

Subject: starch


          Hello, all. 
          I recently brewed a simple ale, with Wyeast #1338.  For the 
          first time, I used distilled water and salt additions to 
          approximate Mosher's ideal ale/dark lager water recipe. 
               The problem is this.  I am almost sure I sparged way 
          too hot, and I believe I've got unconverted starch in my 
          brew.  The brew has an unusual taste I can't put my finger 
          on, but definitely off.  I am wondering if someone in the 
          know could describe the taste of unconverted starch in beer, 
          if any.  I hope my problem stems from the too hot sparge, as 
          this is more easily dealt with.  I simply won't do it in 
          the future! :) 
               Thanks.

Subject: Correct usage of Counter Pressure Filler


I recently bought a counter-pressure bottle filler, and I guess I'm doing 
something wrong, as all my beer is FLAT when I try it out the next day. 
 
The instructions that came with it were rather vague, so I was wondering 
if anyone had any ideas on the correct operation of it.  I have a 
"three-handed" model, meaning it has the needle pressure release valve 
as well. 
 
Here's the operation procedure I used in a nutshell: 
 
1) Adjust CO2 tank to 10-15psi. 
2) Put filler in sanitized bottle. 
3) Open CO2 valve, then open needle valve to flush bottle with CO2. 
4) Close needle valve and CO2 valve. 
5) Open Beer valve.  Beer should not be flowing. 
6) Open needle valve to start beer flowing and adjust to stop foaming. 
7) When bottle filled, close needle valve, and close beer valve. 
8) Take filler out of bottle and cap. 
 
Using the above procedure, I end up with flat beer.  My kegs are usually kept 
at 20-25psi and if I draw off beer directly from the keg, the carbonation 
level seems fine.  The beer was not as cold as it should have been (~50f) 
 
Any help, suggestions?? 
 
Thanks.

Subject: Air unlock


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager... 
 
I recently decided to get the three-piece lock off my mead for the much 
noisier triple-ripple.  To my dismay, the mead stopped hitting the lock 
shortly thereafter.  Looking at the liquid/headspace boundary, I could see 
bubbles of CO2 evolving from the mead! This caused me to experiment. I 
sprayed ethanol at the base of the lock and the stopper-to-'boy interface. 
Hmm. Positive pressure once again. In the meantime, my cider began to slow 
down. Tried the same thing, and it sped back up. 
 
Did spraying ethanol on the outside of the fermenter somehow stimulate new 
fermentation :-P 
 
OK, Ok, enough foolishness! Once the ethanol dried from the stopper, the 
cider slowed down and the mead stopped once again. I have since taken to the 
following: 
 
  o Sanitize stopper and airlock 
  o Insert airlock into stopper 
  o Insert stopper in carboy mouth 
  o Apply keg-lube, lubrifilm - whatever - to the stopper to lock interface 
 
Leak free. No false finishes. With the added benefit of conditioning your 
stopper (OK - your stopper's top). 
 
Before pulling the lock out of the stopper, rinse the lubrifilm away with hot 
water and wipe clean. this will prevent the glop from getting on the business 
end of the lock stem and exciting the "mebbe the stuff'll get in my beer and 
kill the head" receptors in your brain. 
 
For those who have had the "by God! The air lock stopped bubbling and my beer 
is still too sweet" syndrome, maybe this will help you... 
 
See ya!
