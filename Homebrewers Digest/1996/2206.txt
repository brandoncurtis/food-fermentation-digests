Depends on whether you want more fermentable (150F or so) or more dextrinous 
(158F or so).

Sounds good, but the snag is that in a decoction mash, you leave all the 
liquid part of the mash in the main mash (because the liquid contains the 
enzymes).  In your method, you are killing 40% of your enzymes.  Perhaps 
you could scoop the liquid part from the 40% mash and put it into the 
main mash before raising the decoction (the 40% mash) up to the saccharifi- 
cation rest.

No, because they are stainless steel!  Seriously, I have nothing but 
metal in my home-made bulkhead fittings.  SS T-fitting on the inside 
and brass ball valve on the outside, joined by a SS nipple.  I could 
not crank down the two far enough to make a seal, so I stuck in four 
SS washers.  If I was to get a leak, I would probably put a teflon 
washer on the inside (I believe that teflon is good to 500F). 
 
I had considered a bulkhead fitting, but in SS, they wanted something 
like $40!

In HBD 2205, Delano Dugarm <adugarm`at`worldbank.org> said

This "black currant" flavor realy interests me.   In my last "Father's 
Moustache," I decided to first wort hop with Cluster, just to see what 
happened.  I got black currants too, big time, in flavor and aroma!  I 
even wrote to  Glenn Tinseth to see if he had any experience with this, 
since I have seen some hops described as having that flavor, although 
not Cluster.  Glenn had no insight, but this confirms it. 
 
I find the flavor distracting, although not unpleasant.  I have never 
experienced it using Cluster for a normal boil.  It does re-emphasize 
the efficacy of first wort hopping.  Next time, though, I'll use noble 
hops for first wort hopping and leave the Cluster for the boil. 
 
I was going to post my experience when I tapped the beer several weeks 
ago, but decided to wait until after a competition I was entering was 
over, so as not to prejudice the judges.  However, since Delano had a 
similar experience, and he may enter his beer, then there may be two, 
and no one will know whose is whose.

Subject: Is it safe?


     I made an apple cider about nine months ago. Originally I had planned 
     to bottle it after a 1 week primary/2 week secondary fermentation. But 
     things don't always go as planned. I used a couple of Campdon (sp) 
     tablets that I think were supposed to act as a preservative. The 
     question.... Could this stuff be dangerous (the cider I mean)?

Subject: Windsor Ale


This is a recipe for Windsor Ale from a household compendium dated 1883 
which may interest some of you.  Copied verbatim. 
 
"Take 5 quarters of the best pale malt, half hundredweight hops, 8 ponds 
honey,one pound coriander seed, half pound grains of paradise,half pound of 
orange peel, two and a half ponds of ground liquorice root.  The hops 
should be of the best kind and soaked  all night in cold liquor.  Turn on 
at 180 degrees, mash thoroughlyan hour and a quarter, and stand for one 
hour. Boil one hour. 
 
Turn on second liquor at 195 degrees and stand three quarters of an hour. 
Boil 3 hours; tun (thats the spelling!) on third liquor at 165 degrees, and 
mash three quarters an hour and stand the same. Pitch the tun at 60 degrees 
and cleanse at 80 degrees, on the third day. Skim as soon as a close yeasty 
head appears, until no yeast arises.  Half a pound of hops per quarter 
should be roused in, and the whole left to settle. Also rouse in 6 ounces 
of salt, half a pound of finely sifted flour, six ounces of ground ginger, 
and six ounces of ground carraway seeds." 
 
Unfortunately the page which describes most of ordinary ale production is 
missing.  What remains describes the following for the production of a 
table ale. 
 
(presumably after mashing and sparging the ordinary ale) "After the beer or 
ale has run from the grains, pour a hogshead and a half for the 12 bushels, 
and a hogshead of water if 8 were brewed: mash, and let it stand, and then 
boil etc.Use some of the hops for this table beer that was boiled for the 
stong." 
 
It also provides the following advice. 
 
"When thunder or hot weather causes beer to turn sour, a teaspoon, or more 
if required,of salt of wormwood put into the jug will rectify it" 
 
There are some interesting additions used in this recipe, I wonder if it 
would match a style nowadays.  There is also an interesting recipe and 
process for table beer which will follow if there is the interest.

Subject: Oxygen Removal


In HBD 2204, Tom Krivec asks about removing oxygen from bottle necks before 
capping. 
 
I'm a relative newbie here, but I find that Papazian's method works fine. 
Put the caps on the carefully-filled bottles and let them stand for 15 minutes 
or so, then cap them tightly. 
The rationale is that, having used some priming mechanism, corn sugar or Dry 
Extract, the yeast should produce enough CO2 to drive out the air in the 
headspace.  Reasonable enough. 
I would not venture a guess as to the effectiveness of this if you used fresh 
wort. 
 
Yes, I'm aware that this is NOT an awful lot of CO2, but I'd venture to opine 
that it doesn't take a whole lot.  Actually, I'd be more leery of air getting 
in during the filling phase (bubbles, etc).  The brewery you refer to may, 
in fact, have a good idea that this beer will not be drunk for several months. 
Staling may be held off by their process.

Subject: re:RIMS heating alternative - no scorching ?


>>>>>>>>>> 
I plan on putting a 2000 W+ heating element in the 
hot water vessel above  the mash tun. Why not use 
an immersion chiller (coil of copper tube) in  the 
hot water. Now all you have to do is pump the wort 
through the INSIDE  of the immersion chiller tube. 
The wort will reach the temperature of the  hot 
water (122 F, 155F, 170 F etc.) and return to the 
mash tun.  <<<<<<<<<< 
 
What you are describing is what I have done with 
my system.  I don't heat the water with an 
electric element but rather with a "cajun cooker" 
type burner.  Works great. 
 
>>>>>>>>>> 
Also after mashing the water in the hot water 
vessel is not wasted. When  you need to mash out 
at 170 F you would raise its temp from mash temp 
(152  F) to 170 F while still recirculating the 
wort through the copper tube.  The wort will pick 
up this heat and return to the mash tun at close 
to 170  F. When mash out is complete. Use the 170 
F water to sparge with.  <<<<<<<<<< 
 
Yup.  That's exactly how it works.  The only real 
chance for a temperature overshoot is when 
doughing in.  That is if you're paying attention. 
My system is manual control.  If I undershoot the 
temp at dough in, just raise it a little by 
recircing through the coil for a little while. 
 
I know that there are those that will hate this 
but, here goes...  Look at my web page. 
http://www.pressenter.com/~rcalley/index.htm  to 
see my system in excruciating detail.

Subject: Iodophor, Quat, Bleach, etc.


We use all 3 at the hotel I work at. (Im an apprentice chef)  IMHO, 
bleach is the only one I really trust.  I can eyeball a dosage in a 
gallon, dont need any funky test strips that we always run out of or the 
dishdogs drop in the sinks. 
Plus, even after having extensive education in foodservice sanitation and 
college chemistry, I just understand how bleach works a lot better than 
the others.  Yes, I understand that I dont want to bleach the laquer off 
the inside of my minikegs, and I dont, but aside from minikegs and dishes 
at home, I dont use iodophor for anything, and I can get gallons of it 
for free...Same for quat.  We use quat as a sanitizer for the potsink 
after the rinse, airdrying. 
Anyhoo, for our workaday sanitizing bucket at the end of the line needs, 
we use bleach at 50 ppm, just your average cap per gallon. 
 
Merely the opinion of someone whos livelyhood depends on good sanitation...

Subject: Re: Spiced Beers / Water-Jet Purging / BananaRama Brew 


Well, I have to brag. 
 
A couple of years ago, I made a spiced strong Belgian ale.  I made 3.5 
gallons from the first runnings of a basic Belgian ale recipe (I don't 
have the recipe handy, of course).  Probably something like 90% 
Pilsner malt and 10% CaraVienne, and 3/4lb of table sugar in the 
boil.  Hopping was relatively low (25IBUs?) with no finish hops.  That 
part of the recipe is not too important, anyway. 
 
I spiced it with 
 1 gram freshly crushed cardamom (just the black seeds). 
 1 gram sweet gale. 
 2 ounces of dried Belgian sweet orange peel (i.e., bought in 
  Belgium, not grown there. :-) 
 All boiled for not more than 15 minutes. 
 
OG about 1.070. 
 
Fermented with LaChouffe yeast in the basement at winter temps (so 
probably 60-65F).  It took quite a while! 
 
Bottled in *strong* bottles (Duvel, e.g.) with priming sugar at the 
rate of 1c/5gal, aiming for a high carbonation level. 
 
For the first 6 months it was undrinkable -- too much cardamom.  At 
almost 2 years of age, I served what was probably the last bottle to 
Charlie Papazian.  He said it was the best beer he'd had all evening 
(earlier beers had included LaChouffe itself), and went on to talk 
about how the best Belgian beers he'd had were made by homebrewers. 
 
Needless to say, I was floating for the rest of the night. 
 
(It also took first place Huge Ale at this year's Big & Huge competition.) 
 
Words of wisdom: moderation and patience! 
 
It's easy to add more spice next time if it's too light this time. 
It's really hard to take any out if it's undrinkable. 
 
If the spices are too strong, wait!  They will mellow.  This 
definitely happened to mine. 
 
Also, go really light on the cardamom!

Subject: Sparrowhawk Porter Gravity


I've noticed a few errors in Papazians NJOHB book concerning gravity. 
Noonan gives 1.034 OG/# of liquid and Pap gives 1.037 OG/#. Both give 
1.045 OG/# of dry.  I came out about 10% low in my first two Pap recipes 
so I started using 1.034 and came out pretty close.  Most of the 
mistakes I noticed seemed to be the listing of liquid malt in place of 
dry malt and vice versa based on the listed gravities.  However, the 
1.056 number for your Sparrowhawk Porter sounds about right.  (6.6 * 
1.034 / 5) + (1.045 / 5) = 1.054 plus 1 or 2 points for the Black Patent 
should yield a lot higher than 1.042.  Maybe you could check your 
hydrometer?

 reffering to a request for info on quat ammonia as sanitizers: 
 
there are some breweries that do use quats on tanks but from 
talking to several brewmasters - they would require a rinse. 
it really depends on what the product documentation indicates, use wise 
it is real good for long term killing and fairly wide spectrum - so say 
the info for the one i use.  i do not use it on fermenters, floors only. 
there are far better no rinse sanitizers, iodine-based, acid based and 
even a newer clorine dioxide that is finding increased use. 
 
the quats really does a good job on the floor, in heavy loads we apply 
a liberal dose 2 times a week, and it makes the place smell real clean. 
 
any way, that is my 2 cents worth.

Subject: Malt sweetness


I'd like to experiment with making a very low alcohol mild using as a 
base Laaglander extract, but building the body and maltiness using a 
specialty grain such as Belgian Aromatic, then hopping a bit heavier 
than might be customary for a mild.  I've not used Aromatic before and 
I'm concerned that it will further increase the sweetness, in light of 
the fact that comments in older HBD's suggest that Laaglander leaves the 
brew pretty sweet by itself, due to its low (55% +/-, I understand) 
attenuation. 
 
Which of the various specialty malts are noted for adding character 
without adding much sweetness?

Subject: High gravity fermentation


I usually brew beers with an O.G. of between 1.030 to 1.040 (30 to 40).  After 
pitching yeast, I will usually notice activity in my fermenter after 12-15 
hours.  Monday, I boiled up a wort with a gravity of 65.  I cooled it to 70 
degrees, and pitched an English brewery yeast ( I don't know the Wyeast number 
- - my distributor covers up the Wyeast information with his own label, and puts 
the Wyeast logo on his label).  The yeast was also at room T of ~70.  It took 
near 30 hours for acticity in the fermentation lock.  Do higher gravity worts 
take longer for the yeast to transition from aerobic respiration to anaerobic 
fermentation?  Or was my yeast just sleepy?

In HBD 2204, Tom Krivec <9535095`at`grz08u.unileoben.ac.at> ask: 
 
>Do any of you have experiences with eliminating the oxygen before bottling 
>and if yes, how do you do it ? (Buying an automatic filling station maybe 
>could be a little bit too expensive ... :-) ) 
 
After your beer is finished fermenting, there should be a good deal 
of CO2 still in solution.  After you fill the bottle, place the cap on top, 
but don't cap yet.  Have your capper ready though.  Take the handle-end of 
a screwdriver and lightly tap the bottle a few times.  This knocks the CO2 out 
of solution, causing the resulting foam to fill the airspace, pushing 
the oxygen out.  When the cap starts to rise from the foam trying to get out, 
cap it quickly! 
 
You'll have to experiment with how hard you need to tap the bottle to get the 
CO2 to nucleate.  The colder beer will have more CO2 in suspension, therefore 
you shouldn't have to tap the bottle very hard at all to do this.  However 
if it's at room temp, you may have to tap it quite hard. 
 
Some may say "you'll weaken the bottles".  Out of about 35 bottled batchs, 
I've only had one break (not during bottling, but during conditioning) that 
may be attributable to the tapping. 
 
I've helped bottle at a local micro several times, and if the head space in 
the bottle is not full of foam when it comes off of the filler, the brewmaster 
is standing there using an open-end wrench to tap the bottles to get 
them to foam -- not sure where you'd get that high-tech brewing tool he 
uses ;^)

Briess and Hugh Baird are brand names -- maltsters. 
Harringtons, Klages, Marris Otter, etc. are barley strains.  The first two 
are North American and *generally* malted as very pale lager malts. 
Marris Otter is an increasingly-rare British barley used for pale ale 
malt.  There are brewers, commercial and amateur, that consider 
it the finest possible ale malt and well worth the additional price. 
 
My personal experience has developed a preference for malts from 
virtually any British, German or Belgian maltster, as well as Great 
Western (now doing an ale malt), Gambrinus (likewise) and 
Schreir (fine midwestern malts particularly suited to lagers). 
 
I've never used Marris Otter, but the ale malt I've been using from 
Gambrinus is a satisfactory (and less expensive) equivalent to 
British ale malts in general.  As many will tell you, the pilsner 
malt (and caramel malts) from Belgium's DeWolf-Cosyns are 
extraordinary, but there are other Belgian maltsters just as good.

Jeff Renner noted that his recipe actually called for Clusters; 
I was wrong again, folks!  My memory from his magazine 
article was wrong, apparently. 
 
At any rate, my own exposure to Clusters has been very negative; 
the stuff smelled just like a dirty cat box (the source of that "catty" 
description the British applied to American hops).  Nice to know 
you can brew good beer with them.  They do have, as Delano 
notes, a reputation as very good keepers.

Hi Jeff, 
Sorry that you got shat on by so, so judging..... 
 
What a weird coincidence, I just bottled my first attempt at a Ginger Wit. 
I know our recipes cannot be identical, but I used yeast from 
a Blanche de Bruges White that I cultured and made a starter from. 
 
I have but a couple of ??   What, in your opinion is a good amount of 
ginger to add? and when? 
 
I used 1.5 oz of fresh grated ginger added during the last 10 min of the boil. 
This Summer I had a marvelous (IMHO) ginger beer called Caribe from Trinidad, 
serious ginger.  Not what I would expect from a Ginger Wit Belgian though. 
 
Anyway, I used 5# Belgian Pils, 5# Malted Belgian Wheat, 1tsp gypsum, 3.5 gals 
RO water,
12oz quick oats, mashed at 50C for an hour then added 1 gal boiling RO water 
and decocted
1 gal heated to near boiling to raise to 70C for 8 hrs (went out mushrooming) 
dropped to 60C.
Sparged with 78C RO water. I added 3.3# Mexican Brewmart hopped extract to the 
boil
along with 1/2oz Styrtian Goldings (3%AA)and 1/2oz Hallertau 
Hersbrucker(2.5%AA) pellets.
(Boil volume of 4.5 gals `at` 1.095 spec grav) 
Added 1-1/2 oz fresh grated ginger, 1/2oz ground coriander, fresh grated 
valencia orange zest
from 3 small oranges.  and 1tsp irish moss during last 10 minutes of boil. 
 
1/2oz Saaz pellets(2.5%AA) finishing hops added to hot wort during cooling with
copper
water chilled coil. Pitched at 84C with 1 liter of starter. Aerated cool wort 
and yeast for
10 min. with aquarium airstone and pump, bubbled first through hydrogen 
peroxide. (Al, don't
blow a gasket). Kept ferment cool 18-21C with ice water bath surrounding 
fermenter.
 
Bottled after 11 days fermentation.  FG=1.106. 
 
At bottling it tasted slightly sweet and dry but there doesn't seem to be 
enough
ginger....   Opinions??? 
 
I'll send you one of mine if you send me one of yours....

I have never found a mushroom (I think), but I have found: 
 
        snails 
        beetles 
        rocks 
        other 'bugs' 
        several unidentifiables 
 
I go through about 250 pounds of malt a month during brewing season in my 
supply shop.  I am constantly finding these damn things in the malt bags, 
no matter where the malt came from.  German malt, English malt, American 
malt, Supplier X, Supplier Y, Supplier Z, they all have sent me bags of 
malt with foreign specimens in it.  The bugs, btw, are always dead and 
dried up.  I have never found anything alive in the malt.  I used to call 
and complain but I am now thoroughly convinced it just can't be avoided. 
Some 'stuff' is always going to make it into the malt.  When I receive malt 
I immediately transfer it to HDPE buckets, at which time I carefully screen 
it and remove most of the stuff.  Occasionally a piece of stuff makes it 
into the mill and the customer sees it.  Usually I am able to calm their 
fears but occasionally they freak out, and undoubtedly think it's my fault. 
One of my fears is running a rock or some other hard object through the 
mill and damaging the rollers, so I do a pretty thorough screening of the 
malt upon receipt.  Don't worry about it!  Any other supply shop owners out 
there having this same experience? 
 
Now I gotta go pack for the GABF!  Yaaaaahoooooo!!!!!!
