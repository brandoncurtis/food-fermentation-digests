Subject: CO2 saturation formula


I originally posted a query which was inspired by Dave Draper's article 
"Dave's Preferred Priming Procedure" at 
http://audio.apana.org.au/ddraper/priming.html, wherein Dave discusses the 
issues of priming by weight instead of volume of sugar. The procedure 
involves taking into account the volume of dissolved CO2 in the beer 
(which is assumed to be saturated) for a given fermentation temperature, 
and adding enough priming sugar to bring the volume of CO2 to the desired 
carbonation level. 
 
Dave's article presents the CO2 saturation levels at various temperatures 
in tabular form, as extracted from reference material. Having programmed 
this table lookup into my brewing spreadsheet in the course of creating a 
priming calculator, I wondered if there might be a formula that could be 
used in place of the table lookup. 
 
A few people mailed me the forced-carbonation formula commonly used to 
calculate the pressure required for a desired level of carbonation in 
kegged beer. At first I thought my question was misunderstood, then I 
realized that the formula might indeed work if one plugged in fermentation 
temperature, atmospheric pressure, and solved for volume of CO2. 
 
Pierre Dumont (pierre_dumont`at`unb.ca) was kind enough to modify the formula 
to express volume of dissolved CO2 as a function of temperature and 
(atmospheric) pressure. In other words, he did the hard part and came up 
with the following equation: 
 
VolCO2 = 1.266789*tempF + 31.00342576 - 0.0000009243372* 
(SQRT((1898155717178*tempF^2)+ 
91762600000000*tempF + 839352900000000 - 1710565000000*14.5)) 
 
The number 14.5 near the end represents 1 bar of pressure (14.5 psi) so 
that we can compare with the tabular data. One could try substituting 
actual atmospheric pressure according to elevation. 
 
The comparison: 
 
 Vol CO2 Vol CO2 
Temp F (table) (formula) 
32 1.70 1.79 
35 1.60 1.67 
40 1.45 1.51 
45 1.30 1.36 
50 1.20 1.23 
55 1.10 1.11 
60 1.00 1.00 
65 0.92 0.90 
70 0.85 0.81 
75 0.78 0.72 
 
The curves are not the same, but they are surprisingly close. Probably 
close enough to be useful. The results disagree by less than a tenth of a 
volume across this temperature range, and are very close indeed for the 
55-65F range. The formula is a bit unwieldy but fine for spreadsheet use. 
 
Feedback appreciated.

Subject: Counter Pressure Bottle Fillers


I designed and use a home-made filler that I think is superior in many ways 
(in addition to cost) to a commercial unit.  Visit my web page (URL below) 
for details and a GIF diagram.  If you're already a kegger, you probably have 
most of the pieces parts on-hand. 
 
One of the things I like about my unit is that you can bottle with two hands 
("classic" CPBF's seem to require three, or at least a lot of talent).  It 
takes far less time and I get far less foaming (probably since the beer 
doesn't travel through a lot of warm metal).

Subject: too much Irish moss?


 
  Hey, 
 
  In HBD#2207, Michael Bateman wondered if adding mote than 1 TBSP 
  Irish Moss (IM for the hip) would be the cause of his nasty beer.  I 
  typically use a few TBSP (2-3) since in one of my books (Miller or 
  Noonan?) the question of whether 1 TBSP is adequate for clearing.  I 
  don't have any unpleasant tastes that I'm aware of (HEY, QUIT THAT 
  GIGGLING OUT THERE !).  Since he doesn't know how much he dumped in, 
  though, my experience may not be relevant. 
 
  I'm suspect that he says he kept it in sunlight for 2 weeks.  Can 
  you say "skunked"?  I knew you could. 
 
  Anyways, I'll make you an offer Michael, since you don't no what to 
  do with bad beer.  Mail several bottles to me.  I'll give it my 
  completely unscientific analysis on several samplings over a 1 year 
  period.  At the end, I'll tell you if it's still bad.

Subject: lager malt vs. pale malt/dark beer H2O pH


 
Two questions for the All-Grain All-Knowers 
 
1.  What is the difference between lager malt and pale ale malt?  Is a lager 
malt a generic name for Pils? 
 
2.  From reading both Miller's and Pap's books that when you brew dark 
beers, you need brewing water that is higher in pH.  I never really found 
why.  I assume that darker roasted specialty malts are more acidic and will 
cause the pH of the wort too low. 
 
Thanks for your insight!

Greetings, 
 
In HBD#2206 Charles Capwell asks 
>What the devil is 'spelt'? 
> 
>Whilst looking around a chain supermarketish health/new age store(Whole 
>Foods) here in San Antonio, I spied something called 'Flaked Spelt'(right 
>next to the $.89/lb Flaked Barley) and I started wondering what the heck 
>'spelt' was and what kind of effects it might have as an adjunct. If anyone 
>knows I'd appreciate your sharing of knowledge. :> 
Back in the Summer of 94, Zymurgy had an article about brewing a Belgian 
ale with Spelt.  It was quite informative and goes through the the author's 
research and brewing procedures.  Of course, I made spelt an addition to my 
next Belgian ale and was pleased with the results.  As others have noted, 
it's a relative of wheat so additional flavor notes were not very 
pronounced, but I seem to recall a minty bitterness that differed from my 
previous Belgian ales.  Not too bitter to drink mind you, it just cut 
through the fruitiness a bit more than could be attributed to the hops (20 
IBU hallertauer and tetnanger if I recall.)  You are in luck since you can 
get flaked spelt since it should already be gelatinized.  Try .5-1lb. in 
your next brew and see what you think. 
 
 
    Happy Brewing,

Greg: 
 
I too was going to build my own based on some plans in a homebrew magazine. 
However, after a few trips to a couple of hardware stores, it was evident 
that I was going to have a hard time finding all the parts I needed. 
I caved in and simply ordered one mail order.  It's by far much better 
built that I could have ever done, plus the tubing that goes into the bottle 
is all stainless steel. 
 
If you look at the previous HBD post I did, I posted a reply I got from 
someone who has a web page on a filler.  Nice job on the page BTW. 
 
As far as how they work, I haven't gotten mine to work correctly, still 
working on the details of temperature, etc.  But, I understand that they 
do work well, as microbreweries use them to bottle small quantities for 
testing, etc.

Subject: Aquarium Pump Aeration


I've got a brand-new aquarium pump and airstone.  I've also got one of 
these 0.22 micron inline air filters.  The pump allegedly moves 1,000 cc 
of air per minute.  I have foam control (which works great).  Now, all I 
need to know is how long I need to run the aquarium pump to achieve 
sufficient aeration of the wort. 
 
In this case, I'm brewing a fairly light (OG = 1.038) lager, using Wyeast 
#2206.  My starter is well underway (1000mL wort and the dregs from a 
300mL starter).  I will brew on Sunday, so I've got time to step up the 
starter one more time (it's actively fermenting now).  I just want to make 
sure the wort is adequately aerated using my new pump.  Any suggestions? 
 
Truth in brewing,

Subject: aeration


Some time ago I was in a homebrew supply store in NC and the owner was making 
up a starter for a weekend brew session.  He had some wort in a flask and had 
an aquarium pump aerating the wort.  The excess air was escaping though a two 
hole stopper fitted with glass/plastic tubing.  He said he had this thing 
going for a week or so. 
 
I am wondering what effect this has on yeast reproduction (ie the continuous 
supply of oxygen or air).  Will the yeast continue to reproduce and delay 
actual fermentation (alcohol production) until the oxygen is depleted?  If so 
why isn't this technique (continuous aeration) used for the first day or so 
of fermentation in carboys?  With all the hullaballoo about aeration and 
starters, it would seem like an interesting approach. 
 
Any comments from the microbiologists in the crowd?

<<<<<<<Pale ale malt has lower protein, lower enzymes (diastatic power), 
and higher color.  It will make a darker beer than the pils malt.  It is 
good for single infusion mashes, however, due to the low protein.>>>>> 
 
So, does that mean that when mashing with Pale Ale malt we need to do the 
protein rest (132F) before boosting up to sacharification (152-158F) for 
conversion, and if we're mashing with Pale Malt (not ale) we can do the 
single temperature infusion (152F - 158F)? 
 
You're right, there's not enough treatment of this subject in the texts (at 
least the ones I've read) and the local homebrew outlets most of the time 
around where I live don't even know what they're selling.

Yes I aerated my wort.  It turns out that I was incorrect - although I 
didn't notice any bubbling, it must have been a quick fermentation on 
the first night, because there was some sediment around the sides. 
 
Also, I tested the Spec. Grav. and tasted it, and everything seems 
A.O.K.  Should be done soon and it tastes pretty nice too!! 
 
Thanks for all your help.  The lesson was:   ...don't worry...

Subject: Home Grown Cascades


I'm getting a fair crop of cascades from my two hops vines this year (about 
2-3 oz so far).  Believe it or not I'm growing them in Central Florida.  I 
just have to grown them on the morning sun side of my shed.  My question is 
how do I get some clue of the bittering factor of my hops.  And am I better 
off using the hops for just aroma?

Subject: copper cleaning


Greetings fellow homebrewers.. 
 
Many parts of my all grain system are made of copper water pipe.  I also use 
a copper immersion chiller.  Some of these parts can be downright difficult 
to clean, particularly the immersion chiller.  Any sugestions for cleaning? 
A "dip-clean" technique would be great.  How about a gadget that I've seen 
advertised caller "silver lightning?"  Supposedly one just adds sodium 
bicarbonate to water with this gadget in the bottom of the bucket, and then 
you just dip what you are trying to clean.

Subject: re: malt liquor/labeling


For my two cents on the subject of labeling--the guy doing the Heineken tour in
Amsterdan said that reguations on importing to the US varied from state to 
state but was generally around 4% (I don't know if that is abv or abw.)  But 
pretty low in any case. 
 And for my two cent on the ATF, the brew master at a local pub told 
a story.  He used to work at Stoudt's and they had a generic label for all 
their beers that said something about brewing with german malts and hops, and 
for one beer they produced since the label was made used American hops and the 
ATF called them on that and said that they could fine them $1000 per bottle! 
Which would behave put them out of business (so apparently they didn't.)  But 
it goes to show you the throttle hold the ATF has on the business.

Subject: Rye Beer


Greetings, 
 
I would like to make a Rye beer using malted rye (not flaked rye), in the 
classic style of a German 'Roggen Bier'.  Unfortunately, I have never 
tasted one, since 'Roggen Bier' is unavailable here in upstate NY.  The 
only thing I know about 'Roggen Bier' is from Michael Jackson's writings. 
There appears to be very little available on-line that's useful to a home 
brewer. 
 
I'd be interested in hearing from people in the Digest who have made beer 
using malted rye and in hearing some general tips about how to make a 
'Roggen Bier'. 
 
TIA.

Subject: Pale ale malt vs. Pils malt and DMS componds


Long time lurker, and confused! 
 
Lately, there have been some informative discussions about the character of 
pale
ale malt and pils malt. In those discussions, it was said (I can't remember the
author) that pils malt contains compounds that could potentially yield DMS in a
slowly cooled wort.  My question here is how "slowly cooled" are we talking 
about? I can get 5 gallons cooled in 15-20 min. with my immersion chiller, will
this yeild a detectable amount of DMS? 
 
Also, someone stated that it would be beneficial to use a protein rest for pils
malt.  Can someone explain why?  TIA, 
 
Kevin

Subject: No Fizz


Hello HBDers, 
I am a new brewer and have bottled my first brew about two weeks ago. I 
opened the first bottle the other day and  there was no fizz, foam or 
anything. It tasted ok( Brown Ale) and had no off taste  but it was flat. I 
primed it with 3/4 cup priming sugar just like the receipe said to. So I am 
stumped as to what has gone wrong. Dies it need to sit in the bottles longer 
than two weeks before it carbinates? Any help will be as always appreciated. 
Thanks

I've been searching the archives for advice/experience creating a 
Chimay type Belgian ale.  Most recipes I've seen have used honey or 
brown sugar.  I've had Chimay's, and they are sweet, but the sweetness 
seems to me to be a malty sweetness, not a sugary one.  I'm sure this 
question has come up often in the past, but hey I'm new here, what 
types of malts would make a good Belgian ale?  Pale + wheat? + ??. 
BTW, I'll be using Chimay yeast (red?).

Subject: Please help with Cat's Meow recipe


Hi all 
 
I've done two kits so far, and I would like to move one step up the ladder 
to extract brewing. The 'Killer Party Ale' from Cat's Meow looks neat, I'll 
repeat it here so you won't have to look it up: 
 
2 cans light malt 
15 cups corn sugar 
2 jars / 22 oz golden syrup 
2 1/2 ounces Hallertauer hops 
2 pounds flaked maize 
1 pack Brewmagic yeast. 
 
(Makes 5 gallons) 
 
Questions: 
1. It seems to ask for an incredible amount of sugar / fermentables. 2 cans 
(6 to 8 lb) of extract is right for 5 gallons of beer, without any sugar, I 
thought. 15 cups of sugar is 8 1/3 lb. And I would assume that the golden 
syrup is also about 80% sugar, that's equivalent to another 1.1 lb of sugar. 
 
I would assume that it would be 'killer' ale, if all that sugar converts to 
alcohol. Will the yeast make it? Am I missing something? 
 
2. I can get Cordon Brew hops extract, the bottle is marked 'Hallauteur' and 
the shelf is marked 'Hallertauer', same thing? Does anybody know how strong 
this extract is? A bottle is 1 fl oz, 28ml, and apparently contains enough 
extract for 2.5 to 5 gallons of beer. 
 
3. Flaked maize. What on earth is this? Would cornflakes be the same? 
 
4. Brewmagic yeast, the recipe isn't too specific on what this is, can I use 
standard Youngs beer yeast? 
 
Thanks! I'm bound to learn something from this lot.... :-)

Many people responded, some with ring burners, some with jet burners, and

Dear All: 
 
 
 
 A friend of mine recently provided me with some beer from England.  This 
stuff was very good, and I understand now why he always referred to it as 
"Mother's Milk!"  Anyway, the two names I remember are Flowers and 
Boddington's Bitters.  They are both very good.  I was wondering if 
anyone out there knows of a recipe for these or other British beers.

I have used exactly the process you describe, never making an effort to 
remove the break material.  I stored yeast for up to a year this way 
without problems, although the starters get slower to take off as the 
yeast is stored longer. 
 
During storage the yeast and break settles into a firm cake at the 
bottom of the bottle; when I went to make a starter, I decanted off 
almost all the old beer.   I tasted the old beer once - the dominant 
flavor was just yeast.  In any event,  if there were any funky flavors 
in there, I would guess that most of them would be removed with the old 
beer. 
 
FWIW, I have changed over to storing yeast under distilled water in 
little vials.  Takes up a lot less space, doesn't need refridgeration, 
and one tiny vial can be stepped up into many starters once you have 
your sterile technique down. 
 
Robert also asks:

I've been using an 8 gal enamel-on-steel pot over a 35 kbtu ring burner 
propane cooker for over a year now.  I can't speak about those 160 kbtu 
jet engines, but with my setup I have seen no evidence of scorching or 
damage to the pot.
