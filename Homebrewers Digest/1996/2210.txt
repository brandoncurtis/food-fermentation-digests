Subject: Stretching yeast


O.K. I have been brewing extract for about two years 
and am pretty good at it (give or take a batch).  I was 
wondering if there is a relatively simple way I can 
get maybe 5-10 batches of yeast out of one $5.00 wyeast 
package. I have heard stuff about yeast culturing and 
some of it seems to be way out in left field for me. 
 
Does someone have simple instructions on how to do this. 
 
Also Instructions on how to 'revive' it. 
 
Thankyou very much.

Chuck, 
 
You sound like you have a great operation, however I still would say that 
this is the same as contract brewing. As far as I can see if it isn't made 
at home it's not homebrewing. 
 
Thanks for the response.

Alex MacGillivray RN asks: 
What  does the term, "mash out", mean? 
 
 
Mashout occurs at the end of the saccharification step and its purpose is to 
stabilize the wort and prevent further enzymatic action and to increase the 
rate
of diffusion from the grains into the sparge water.  This stabilization is 
achieved by bringing the wort to 167F-170F.  Before sparging.

Duffy Toler asks:

 Pale Ale Malt is a British malt that is highly converted,and  low in protein 
and in enzymes due to its relatively higher drying temperature than pale or 
lager malt 
 
Pale Malt is a continental or american malt of which lager malt is a subset. 
Lager malt is the least converted of the malts, has a higher enzyme content and
should be given a protein rest. 
 
People are often confused by not distinguishing between Pale ALE malt and Pale 
malt. 
 
Pils is the German nickname for Pilsner style beer which originated in Plzen, 
Czechoslovakia.

Yep.  The roasting of the grain produces carboxylic acids of many types. These 
acids are extracted upon mashing and react with the alkaline components ( 
mostly
bicarbonate) in the water

Subject: re:  copper cleaning


The first time I used my homemade immersion chiller, I didn't 
think to clean it. The beer came out tasting like sucking on a 
penny! Since then I have used the old chef's trick for cleaning 
copper - vinegar and salt. I just pour about a tablespoon of 
salt into a small bowl and add vinegar to cover. Using a small 
piece of paper towel I grab up some of the salt (which also 
saturates the paper towel with vinegar) and then scrub the 
chiller with it. It takes surprisingly little work to remove the 
oxidation, which is really what you want to get rid of. After 
working my way over the entire chiller, I give it a through 
rinse with hot water. I haven't had a batch of copper penny beer 
since. 
 
You should use only white distilled vinegar - I've read that 
there is some chance that wine vinegar, cider vineger, etc. may 
still have some active vinegar producing organisms in them which 
may result in a batch of beer vinegar instead of beer. While you 
could just dip your copper in vinegar for a while, I believe it 
takes a pretty low PH to actually remove the oxidation (gotta go 
find that college chemistry book) and I never felt like keeping 
a tub of vinegar around for the job. 
 
Happy cleaning.

Likely the strawberry stuff is a apsterized sweetened product.  Not a more 
traditional prodcutYou can go to www.u.arizona.edu/~jliddil and start from 
there.  From there go to the new lambic faq. But I am biased.

Well, for lack of anything better, and since I'm "gadgetly impared", I 
decided on a low-tech solution for this problem on my counterflow chiller. 
 
Get a piece of hose that will fit over spigot from easymasher.  When the 
spigot is hot (maybe boil some water in the pot), toss a hose clamp around 
the hose, feed the hose up until it shapes into place, and clamp it down 
around the shank of the spigot, between the valve and when the spigot turns 
down.  Shape the hose so that it will have an unobstructed flow from the 
end of the spigot. 
 
I've been using this setup for about 10 batches now and I haven't had any 
problems.  The tubing does not melt, as I usually let the pot cool for 
about 10-15 minutes covered before starting the counterflow. 
 
I'm sure that there's some type of compression/flare fitting out there 
that you can replace on the easymasher, or maybe even replacing the 
spigot altogether with a ball valve, but like I said, I'm "gadgetly impared".

[soapbox mode on] 
Actually, I have no problem with the categories set up for the megabreweries; 
after all, many millions of beer drinkers honestly enjoy (or think they enjoy) 
those products -- they deserve some recognition for their product. 
 
I'm much more concerned that the microbreweries and brewpubs aren't getting 
a fair shake at the GABF. They produce stunning beers, but I've tasted many 
of them (both at the source and at the GABF) and I've very often been 
appalled at the discrepancies I've noticed. Truly outstanding examples that 
fail to get a medal year after year, mediocre examples that win big, etc. 
 
While shaking my head in despair while reading the medal listings this year, 
it suddenly occurred to me: the GABF no longer even uses the word "judge" 
in any of their publicity. They refer to the competition as the Professional 
Panel Blind Tasting (PPBT). 
 
Based on what I've heard about the process from PPBT participants, I get the 
strong impression that instead of "judging" the entries in anything even 
remotely resembling the way an organized homebrew competition is run with 
BJCP beer judges, the PPBT is simply a group of people who are "professionals,"
that is, they happen to be in the industry (work for a brewer or distributor, 
write about beer, etc.). These "professionals" then engage in a "tasting" 
(NOT "judging") of a selection of beers in a category. Their _favorites_ 
(what they call the "best" beers) are then awarded medals. 
 
In fact, I believe that last year was the first time that the "tasters" 
were even asked to fill out a comment card on the entries. 
 
Now, I certainly don't expect the GABF to be exactly like a homebrew 
competition. With over 1,400 beers to evaluate in two days, it wouldn't 
be possible. And I know that many of the PPBT members are very well 
qualified to evaluate any beer. It's just that many of them aren't. 
 
Isn't it time the GABF made more of an effort to ensure that the people 
who evaluate the entries are truly qualified to do so? All of them?

Subject: RE: RYE BEERS


iin a recent request for info on rye beers, there was an article in - i think 
brewing techniques - last year on the subject. 
 
in brews we have done, two things come to mind 
 loose and hot for the mash. 
 
we have never had trouble with a runoff, unless it was runoff to fast. 
typical amounts are 14 to 17 percent rye with both flaked and malted. 
usually it is a little slower than an all malt but not much 15 min at most. 
 
the malted rye is very small in size, so an adjustable mill or other device 
may be needed.  the flakes need not be milled.  raw rye needs to be cooked 
 
from several test brews the raw rye seemed to add more of the rye flavor 
than either the flakes or malted.  again you need to monitor the grist 
of the malted rye. 
 
i will say this - there is a company here on the east coast that has 
rye listed in its inventory - a mass based home brew supply - leave it at 
that - the rye they have is pure crap.  i have used it and it is 
less desirable, just frrom the raw flavor, it appears more powdered and 
from talks with the original source of the stuff - was not hot rolled. 
 
briess has some nice stuff - no connection - as does edme both malted and 
flaked.  i forget who source us the raw rye, but we discontinued use 
due to the extra step needed to work with it.  it should be available 
from bakery products stores/ health food stores.... 
 
lots of luck

Brewsters: 
 
Tom Satterfield writes -: My First Taste of Lambic: WOW!! 
 
If they kept regular beer around for several years like they do Lambic it would
be at least as expensive. 
 
For more Details acquire the book "Lambic" which is part of the series of 
Classic Beer Style Series from Brewers Pub part of AOB. Also The Scientific 
American this summer had an article on Lambics. 
 
Jean-Xavier Guinard cautions micro brewers that they should never try to make 
Lambic in the same facilities as saccharomyces-only fermented beers, since the 
Brett and other yeasties and bacteria can easily take over.  I extend the same 
caution to you. Keep your hoses and FV and other equipment separate if you try.

Merri asks about HB stores in US who will ship outside the US to Paris. In the

outside the US and I can say I have dealt with them for many years with 
satisfaction.  NO affiliation , etc. 
 
Of course, just across the channel is the UK, member of the EC and supplier of 
many, many fine products.  Go to the library and look up home brewing and wine 
making in the London telephone book. 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Cory Chadwell asks how to personalize his auger beer.  I wish I knew what an 
Auger beer was! 
 
First, I highly recommend that you keep the sugar use to carbonating 
quantities.
Use all malt extract, either a large 3kg can or two 3# cans or one can and 
dried
malt extract to give an OG greater than 1.045. Put in some finishing hops, say 
cascades if you are making an American Lager, or other appropriate hops, 
Goldings for Pale Ale, Fuggles for browns and stouts, Saaz or Hallertauer for 
European lagers.  Varying the hops and making  a blend of hops will give 
complexity and personalize your beer. 
 
Cool your wort, covered, before siphoning off into the fermenter.  If you use 
whole leaf hops, putting an unsoaped Choreboy (copper or SS) will keep hops out
of the racking cane. 
 
You can then move onto adding grains in a grain bag, which do not require 
mashing, like a whole variety of crystals and highly roasted malts and grains. 
 
Buy yourself a book like Charlie Papazian's New Joy of Homebrewing, or many 
others.

Subject: Weisse Yeast?


Top of the Morning, Brewers! 
 
I had a wiesse at the Schlafly Brewery (the Tap Room) in St. Louis that had 
a wonderful tartness that I would like to reproduce at home.  Anyone got a 
relatively simple way to sour this type of beer.  I assume it's not the 
yeast.  I checked a recipe for Berliner Weisse in the Cat's Meow 3.  They 
used a sour mash and acidopholous capsules.  Here are the comments from that 
recipe... 
 
>Many commented that the sourness was in fact different from the usual sour 
mash. Different, but not necessarily better or worse. All said the beer was

HELP!!! 
 
One week ago I brewed a Belgian White Ale using (started) yeast from a 
bottle of Hoegarden White Ale.  The fermentation kicked off very quickly 
(65 F') but never got going real powerful.  Yesterday I racked to 
secondary and found that the gravity had only dropped from 1.053 to 
1.047!  Last night I shook things up pretty good - worked up a nice foamy 
white head, which was gone this morning. 
 
I've always ignored previous posts about stuck fermentations, figuring 
that would never happen to me - of course not, I know what I'm doing... 
 
Okay, so what should I do?  New yeast?  Yeast nutrient? 
 
Any help is appreciated, 
 
Brad

Thanks to all who responded to my request for advice on the JSP mill.  I can't 
wait to see the results! 
 
Also....last week I saw an outdoor cooker at our local "warehouse club" that 
was
designed with two ring burners, side by side.  Each of these burners are rated 
to put out 30,000 btu's.  The $99 pricetag is very enticing, but are the btu's 
on the small side?

Subject: what to do with 25 kg ground (not crushed) malt?


I bought some malt (25 kg was the minimum) from a bakery supply warehouse 
last week hoping that the extract would make "good enough" beer.  Boy, was I 
surprised to find that the malt was not extract at all, but finely ground 
malt.  Its diastatic power is just fine.  I tried a small scale mash and got 
complete starch conversion after 60 minutes at about 65C. 
 
Lautering and sparging with this stuff would be impossible.  Any 
suggestions?  I can use this stuff in bread, but I use 1/2 tsp per loaf.  At 
this rate the malt would last over 100 years! 
 
At least the price was cheap.  The stuff cost me only $0.60/lb.  That may 
not be a bargain in the US, but the stuff is virtually unavailable here.

Subject: Newbie Tips -- "Additives" for Improving Kit Beers


Cory Chadwell says: 
 
"    First of all I would like to say that I've been reading the digest for 
     a while and really appreciate how the "beer elders" don't flame all us 
     newbee's for asking starter level questions." 
 
Sounds like a pre-emptive strike! 
 
"    Can additives used 
     for more elaborate brewing techniques work for my simple brewing case, 
     and if so which items and when should they be added." 
 
Perhaps the simplest "additives" that will give you greater control of your 
recipe would be steeping grains and adding your own fresh hops. 
 
Many grains can be simply steeped in the brewing water while you're waiting 
for it to boil.  Some worthwhile grains are:  roasted grains (especially 
chocolate) to add color and a roast character, crystal malts to add sweetness 
and body (40L is a good all-around choice), toasted malts like Victory or 
"Biscuit" (to add a "toasty" character -- roasting pale malt for 20 min at 
350F makes a serviceable homemade version), and Munich and "Aromatic" malts 
(for added maltiness).  1/4 to 1/2 lb of smoked malt (like Hugh Baird Peated) 
will add a unique subtle smokiness without completely overpowering the brew, 
but be sure that's what you want before you use it. 
 
Place the *crushed* grains in a grain bag, tie it shut, and toss it in the 
cold brewing water.  When the water has heated to 150F to 160F, shut off the 
heat and let it stand ~30 min or more.  Remove the grain bag, letting it 
drain back into the brewpot.  Never let your steeping grains get much hotter 
than ~160F; you'll start dissoving starches and other harsh character from 
the grain itself at hotter temperatures. 
 
With crystal and roasted malts, a simple steep is adequate for extraction of 
the full character of the grain.  When using grains other than crystal and 
roasted, it might help to add maybe 1/2 lb or so of wheat or pale malt.  This 
provides enzymes that will actually "mash" the grains and help convert the 
starches to fermentable sugar.  This lends a more "realistic" flavor than a 
simple steep.  Wheat malt will also aid in head retention.  Some of the 
steeping malts you might use may contain some enzymes too (Munich, for 
example) but it wouldn't hurt to give it a boost, especially for short (30 
min) rest times. 
 
Another "step-up" is to add fresh hops instead of using hopped extract.  It's 
so easy that it's kindof a wonder why anyone would bother using hopped 
extract, other than perhaps the "trouble" of figuring how much to use. 
 
Here's a simple recipe that might take you to the next level from basic "kit" 
beers without much trouble, using the above tips.  Sort of a copper-colored 
"generic microbrew" style.  Steep 1 lb crushed 40L crystal and 2 ounces 
crushed chocolate malt as described above.  Remove grains after 30 min of 
155F steep, acheive boil, turn off heat.  Add ~6 lb unhopped pale extract 
syrup; regain boil.  Add 1 ounce Cascade hops; boil 45 minutes.  Add another 
1 oz cascades and boil another 15 minutes.  Use a good yeast.  If you're not 
ready for the expense or extra planning of a liquid yeast, try one of the 
"new and improved" dry yeasts like Lavellan (I think that's the wrong name 
but it's close), or ask your homebrew supplier for help.  Try to keep the 
fermentation temperature below 70F and definitely no more than 75F if 
possible, for cleanest taste. 
 
This really isn't any harder than brewing a simple kit yet you'll be amazed 
at the improved character.

Abzolutely! It's the easiest way to get into all-grain. Get the 
Infamous easy masher(tm)(go ahead and buy the masher! you won't spend 
any more money and it's made better than most things yopu can create. 
Jack is also good about supporting his products.) 
 and a drill bit the same size(sorry I don't 
remember the bit size but jack tells you in the directions) and drill 
slow(so as not to bend the pot or chip too much enamel. The gasket 
for the masher covers any chips you might create. Voila, you have a 
jim dandy of a mashing vessel. It is a good idea to insulate it 
though. I would also recommend the 8 gal. model if you can swing it. 
 
Good luck, 
Marc

Subject: RE: Source of maltiness


George De Piro said: 
 
    "Somebody (sorry, can't remember who) recently asked about the source 
     of malty taste.  Melanoidins, the product of the reaction between 
     amino acids and simple sugars, is often claimed to be the source of 
     malty taste." 
 
I may have been the person he was referring to as a week or so ago I asked 
about "maltiness" as referenced in discussions of no sparge mashes.  It had 
been suggested by some that using the first runnings of a mash without sparging
resulted in a "maltier" beer and I wondered what the source of this "maltiness"
was.  I wondered because I could not see why it would be in the first runnings 
and not runnings from the sparge or why in different concentrations. 
I still don't know why.  Can anyone explain why wort from first runnings would 
result in maltier tasting beer than wort from a sparged mash, assuming the same
OG? 
I am not saying it is not so, there are a number of things about brewing that 
have not been completely explained or understood but I would trust the theory 
more if there was a reasonable explanation of the cause.

Subject: Re: controlling clove phenolics


Andy Walsh makes some nice comments about controlling 
(up or down) the amounts of clove phenolics in one's beer. 
One thing that I have read that would affect the discussion 
of accidentally obtaining them in an ale is that wheat 
malt has much more of the ferrulic acid precursors than 
barley malt.  Therefore, if you are having trouble with 
phenolics, and are adding a bit of wheat for head retention 
and body, maybe you should reconsider the wheat. 
 
I always use oatmeal instead of wheat for this body/HR 
thing, and we all just read that rye malt has plenty 
of ferrulic acid, so who knows about oats? 
 
======================== 
 
I have a more fundamental question about weizens.  On 
the few occaisions I have had a really fresh one, the tastes 
I get are bubblegum, banana, vanilla, and other fruits. 
When they get older they have a kind of rubbery phenolic 
that I find very objectionable.  I used to think I didn't 
like this style until I had a fresh one.  Anyway, I never 
taste clove.  What are other people's experiences?  Private 
email please, I'll summarize.

Subject: infections, sanitizing airstones


A customer of mine (Mark) recently built an aquarium pump and airstone 
contraption for aerating his wort, a la Dave Miller's recommendations.  He 
has used it twice and both batches are horribly phenolic.  I am quite 
positive it is an infection problem.  Mark makes terrific beer with great 
consistency so these infected batches have him quite distressed.  Dave 
Miller recommends sanitizing the aquarium airstones but does not recommend 
a specific technique for doing so.  Mark soaked the stones for 24 hours in 
a dilute bleach solution and then thoroughly rinsed them with boiled water. 
 
Is this the preferred method for sanitizing these stones?  Is there a 
better way to sanitize them?  Heat sanitation melts the plastic doohickey 
on the stone.  He tried isopropyl alcohol which caused the stone to crumble 
into dust.  Good thing they only cost 50 cents! 
 
BTW, this is not a chlorinated water problem, nor is it tannin related. 
Ferment temps on both beers were in the low 60's F with nuetral yeast. 
Both yeast starters were healthy and normal.  We beat it to death and 
decided it had to be the stones. 
 
TIA for any assistance,
