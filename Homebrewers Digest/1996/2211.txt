That is certainly my understanding of the situation and to expand on it, 
I hope correctly, isn't it the calcium in the high alkalinity water that 
reacts with the darker grains to lower the pH?  My brewing water is low pH 
but very low in calcium so I would not expect darker grains to lower the pH 
too much further.  Is this correct?

few good reading resources on the lambic style, and we take this discussion off

Subject: Re: Rye Beer


 
Michael Jackson spends a page on Schierlinger Roggen in the Beer 
companion - or whatever the title. MJ implies that Roggen is 60% 
malted rye, and equal parts pale malt and crystal malt, w/ a small 
addition of dark roasted (malted?) grain for color.  Schierlinger uses 
their hefe-weizen yeast on it, which makes Roggen acidic and phenolic, 
tho' not nearly as phenolic as many weizen's I've tasted.  The OG 
according to MJ is 1.048, the color 45 EBC and the hops are perle in 
two additions.  I decoction mash is used, and Schierlinger has some 
sort of CO2 pressure sparger to force the liquid thru the sticky rye 
grainbed.  MJ also notes a shallow grainbed, and the use of sparging 
knives to cut the grainbed. 
 
Ed Westemeier responded to Peter Ensminger's query for a 'Roggen' like 
beer as: 
 
>First, go ahead and do it -- most people really enjoy the taste. 
 
Totally agree here. 
 
>Second, use a small percentage of rye. It's MUCH, MUCH stickier than 
>wheat, and you'll end up with a mash tun full of glue if you use too much. 
 
I agree it's sticky, but MJ claims roggen is ~60% malted rye.  I'd 
suggest the addition of rice hulls if the mash is too sticky for your 
sparger. 
 
>I only use it in decoction mashes for this reason. I'd recommend staying 
>under 10% rye malt, but you can go as high as 25% in a double decoction. 
 
Agreed - the decoction boils substantially improve the spargability of 
the rye mash. 
 
>Third, the Schierlinger Roggenbier uses a weizen style yeast, so keep that 
>in mind when you design your recipe. 
 
Yes but with mild a mild phenolic flavor.  Wy3787 fermented at 68F is 
too strong IMO.  I've also used Wy3944 and think it's too phenolic 
also.  Can anyone cite a mildly phenolic and crisply acid yeast to use 
for this style ?? 
 
The Roggen bottle dregs can't be cultured - (I've tried twice and am 
pretty experienced at this). They're probably toasted yeast added 
after filtration.

As I reported a couple weeks ago, I broke down and bought one from

the Zymurgy "road test", and worked great right out of the box!  I

I'd recommend this filler (although the needle valve could be replaced 
if I was making one).

I think you read it backwards.  Since pale ale malt has less protein, 
you don't need to do the protein rest.  English ales have generally 
been made with a single temperature infusion mash (I think). 
 
Why do we need a protein rest?  I think a protein rest will help 
the sparge go better, reduce potential protein haze, create 
more amino acids for the yeast, and/or provide smaller proteins 
for head formation. 
 
By the way, someone else asked the difference between lager malt 
and pils malt.  I believe these are basically the same thing. 
 
As always, someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

As for beer labeling, distribution, and sales, keep in mind that 
most of these regulations are specific to states.  In Texas, the 
word "bock" is defined by law.  In Tennessee, we don't need to 
worry about malt liquor; Beers over 5% can't be sold here!

I'm very confused.  My written notes say Wy3787, but my recollection 
is Wy3333. So until I check I don't know which of these I used, except 
that it was too phenolic and very similar to 3944.

Subject: Re: GABF PPBT


Ed Westemier had some comments on the quality of the PPBT results.  I'll 
second his opinion.  It seems the quality of this judging is going downhill, 
especially in some of the more 'esoteric' styles (Belgians, German Wheats, 
etc.).  One of the problems I observed this year was a lack of emphasis on 
complexity.  The winning beers in some categories were simply the ones that 
had the strongest flavor of 'X', where 'X' is some flavor descriptor which 
_helps_ to define the style in question.  This does not, IMO, define quality 
judging.  The winning wheat beers need not be the ones which taste most like 
bananas, nor the winning fruit beers the ones which taste most like Kool-Aid. 
It would be interesting to see some breakdown of PPBT tasters which showed 
which ones were qualified judges, and which ones merely happened to be friends 
of the organizers!

Subject: malts - 6-row vs 2-row


 
Picking up last weeks thread on malts and maltsters ... 
 
Regarding choice of malts, I've noticed that M&F makes (almost?) all 
their malt, except the 2-row pale or lager malt from 6-row barley. 
 
I also recently saw some screening data in Schreiers malts and based 
on grain size distribution suspect that Schreier also uses 6-row for 
all of their non-pale malts. 
 
I have recently compared Munton&Fison crystal w/ Breiss and find than 
I definitly prefer the M&F in ales.  I don't know but suspect that M&F 
crystal is 2-row. 
 
Do any North American maltsters use 2-row for crystal ? Does it make a 
difference ?

Subject: Steeping grains: something to ponder


     Hi all! 
 
     There has been a fair amount of talk about steeping grains in extract 
     beers.  There has been talk of steeping all sorts of grains, including 
     grains that require mashing.  The instructions given are usually to 
     steep the crushed grain at 150-160F for 30-60 minutes. 
 
     I guess the idea is to convert the starch to sugar, but at the 
     extremely dilute enzyme concentrations that exist in this system, does 
     conversion happen that quickly, if at all?  Proteins tend to be less 
     stable in more dilute solutions. 
 
     I really don't want to go back to the "how fast are enzymes denatured" 
     thread, but I don't want to see a lot of beginners making starchy 
     beer!  (I've been there, it sucks) 
 
     On the other hand, I only ever made a few extract batches before going 
     on to mashing, so I'm no expert. 
 
     Just something to think about. 
 
     Have fun!

Subject: reusing yeast, good web pages


 
     Anton Schoenbacher asked about how to reuse liquid yeast.  This is a 
question that is posted on a regular basis.  For all those who don't use 
liquid yeast because it is too expensive, reusing it is VERY easy.  It can 
be as easy as pouring the sludge from your secondary into a sterilized jar 
and putting it the fridge for a month or so until you're ready to use it. 
 Take it out and let it warm up slowly.  Pitch it in a small starter and 
you're there. Simple. 
     There are a number of different methods.  If you have internet access 
you should read the yeast information at 
http://alpha.rollanet.org/library/yeast-faq.html     . As a mater of fact, 
anyone not using liquid yeast should probably print out a copy of this info 
and keep it for when they do want to try it in the future. 
     Also, for the few of you who may not realize it, there are some great 
homebrewing web sites out there.  Most have links to huge amounts of home 
brewing information.  Spencer's Beer Page, The Brewery, Beer Town to name 
just a few.  They are great sources of knowledge. 
     As a last comment, have you all checked out Michael Jackson's Beer 
Hunter web page?  It's pretty good and it is updated regularly.  Check it 
out.

Subject: malts/protein rests


 
In Mark Bayer's excellent answer to Duffy AToler's question .. 
 
>1.  What is the difference between lager malt and pale ale malt?  Is a lager 
>malt a generic name for Pils? 
 
He skips over an aspect - traditional lager malts are less well 
modified than english pale ale malts.  That is the malster kilns the 
lager barley at an earlier stage of development than the pale ale 
malt.  So the pale ale malt is more enzymatically degraded. 
The lower kilned but less degraded lager malt has many more types of 
enzymes intact. 
 
When the pale ale malt is kilns at a higher temp, not only do we lose 
a fraction of the alpha- and beta-amylase, but nearly all of the 
phytase, very much of the peptidase and proteases, I suspect almost 
all of the alpha-glucosidase.  These are enzymes associated with the 
acidification rest, protein rest, and alpha-glucosidase for enzymatic 
starch granule degradation. 
 
For this reason an acid rest with pale ale malt makes no sense, and a 
protein rest for pale ale malt is nearly as pointless (and hopefully 
unnecessary too).  The lack of alpha-glucosidase means that starch 
granule gelatinization by thermal means is desireable for high extract 
efficiency in a pale ale.  None of these thing apply to the lower 
kilned 'lager' malts - where acid rests, protein rests and enzymic 
starch degradation can be used. 
 
Steve Alexander 
 
BTW - many currently available lager malts are nearly as well modified 
as pale ale malts, but are still kilned lower.

Rather than write off the judging as being inaccurate, consider that a lot 
is involved in getting beers from around the country to Denver to be judged. 
Some of the products may not travel well, or may not have been bottled in a 
manner that they will stay fresh for the time before the judging begins.  I 
will try next year to reduce the time it takes me and my staff to process 
beers so that we can present the beers in the freshest possible state. 
 
> Based on what I've heard about the process from PPBT participants... 
> (comments about judging process snipped) 
 
The panel isn't just some random collection of beer people who "happen" to 
work for a brewery/distributor/whatever.  These people are asked to submit 
a JUDGING resume and 3 letters of recommendation as to their JUDGING 
qualifications from people in the industry.  This information is reviewed 
by the festival staff and the most qualified people are chosen. As far as the 
process of side-by-side comparative evaluation of samples and selecting the 
best, what is wrong with that process?  All homebrew competitions use this 
process for best of show judging. And, as far as a judging sheet is concerned, 
you are right in that a full page isn't filled out for each beer and a 
numerical score assigned.  We do, however, fill out a 1/4 page form for each 
beer by a minimum of 3 judges.  The selection of the Gold, Silver and Bronze 
winners is based not only on a top three position, but also the beers must 
truly exemplify the style and be free of major flaws.  A numerical score 
simply states your "favorites" numerically rather than verbally.  It is no 
more accurate. 
 
This process *IS* judging. 
 
> And I know that many of the PPBT members are very well 
> qualified to evaluate any beer. It's just that many of them aren't. 
 
This is not true.  There is *NO ONE* on the panel that is not qualified 
to be there.  All festival attendees were provided with a list of judges in 
their program.  If you feel someone on that list isn't qualified, I'd like 
to know who and why you think so. 
 
> In fact, I believe that last year was the first time that the "tasters" 
> were even asked to fill out a comment card on the entries. 
 
Not true.  The comment cards have been a part of the judging process for at 
least the last 4 years that I've been involved with the festival, and, I 
believe, even before.  In the past, I've had some trouble getting them out 
in a timely fashion, but in the past 2 years, I've returned them within 2 
weeks of the festival. 
 
As far as the professionalism of the Great American Beer Festival is concerned,
I received many compliments from brewers, judges, and attendees about how well 
the event is run.  The comments I've received indicate that this is one of the 
best run competitions in the world.  I and my staff take pride in what we've 
accomplished and strive to do better each year.  If you have some feedback 
on things that we can improve on, I'd be like to hear it.

Dear friends, 
I am trying to start my first batch of mead. I think I have some problems 
with the starter. 
I added three big spoons of honey to a pint of water and 1 tsp of yeast 
extract and boiled for 15 min. I put this wort in a 1 L bottle. When it 
was at around 25C, I added 2 tsp of previously re-hydrated yeasts and 
aereated it as much as possible and put the airlock to the bottle. 
There has been lots of bubbling since then (started immediately after the 
pitching) and during the last three days. However, the yeasts do not seem 
to grow as I think I need. I have a 1 cm sediment since the beginning but 
it does not seem to grow to 5 cm as I was suggested. I do not not whether 
this is enough for pitching a 25 L carboy or not. 
I need your opinions and suggestions.

I have been brewing just over a year, and I have tried three different things 
to "stetch" yeast, two of which have been successful. 
 
  1) I tried "washing" (instructions in the Yeast FAQ) the yeast sediment from 
     a secondary ferment and repitching it directly.  This failed miserably. 
     Perhaps I didn't wash it right or something, but my wort did not ferment. 
 
  2) I have siphoned a brand new batch of cooled wort onto the Yeast Cake ( 
     crud) in the bottom of my fermenter, out of which I had *just* racked 
     another batch.  This works great!  The new batch takes off fermenting 
     immediately (just an hour or two) and I've had no infections or other 
     problems.  I do believe that timing is critical -- I aim to rack off 
     the first batch to a secondary and then *immediately* siphon the new 
     batch into the primary.  With this method, my new batch does end up 
     fermenting with the trub and other miscellaneous crud from the first 
     batch, but I haven't noticed any ill effects from this (the beer that I 
     think is the best I've made I did this way). 
 
  3) I made a small batch of beer (1/2 gal) into which I pitched a liquid 
     yeast culture, and allowed it to ferment out.  I then (very carefully 
     and cleanly) bottled this "beer".  Now, I use these "beers" as yeast 
     starters - pitching them into some sterile wort a few days ahead of 
     brewing.  This, too, works fine. 
 
I have even combined #2 and #3, so I used a home-made starter twice.  This way 
I can get 12 batches out of one liquid yeast culture.  I'm not sure I'll go 
that far, but I think I could!

Since "strawberry" was mentioned, I suspect that what you had 
was  DeTroch "lambic."  DeTroch are syrupy, sweet, "soda-pop" 
beers and do not resemble lambics any more than Bud resembles 
Pilsner Urquell.  Before you decide that you want to take 3 years 
to make a beer in which the cultures will cost you as much as some 
entire recipes, you had better taste Cantillon and/or Boon lambics. 
 
Once you have tasted Cantillon and/or Boon, if you still think "THIS 
IS GREAT STUFF," like I do, your first steps should be to get a copy 
of J.X.Guinard's book "Lambic" from the Association of Brewers or 
your local homebrew shop.  The next thing would be to subscribe to 
the Lambic Digest by sending email to lambic-request`at`longs.lance.colostate.edu 
Please note that the administrator for this list is off-line this week 
so subscriptions may take a week.  If you hate the Boon and Cantillon, 
then just brew some fruit beers.  There is litle point to going through 
all that effort just for a fruit beer if you don't like the acidity 
and horsey/sweaty Brettanomyces character.

I used 43% rye malt in a 150/158F two-step infusion and although the 
runoff was slow (3 hours to get 6.5 gallons of runnings), it never 
stopped trickling.  My advice: patience!

Kilning hotter and longer (as in the case of pale ale malts) *reduces* but 
does not eliminate S-methyl-methionine (I think I've gotten the spelling 
right, "SMM," nonetheless) in the malt.  SMM is converted to DMS when the 
wort is above 158F, but boils off if the wort is boiling.  A good, rolling 
boil with the lid ajar and quick cooling of the wort from boiling to below 
158F (I've read 140F also, but most recently, I've read 158F) will reduce 
DMS to below human threshold levels.  If you boil covered you can easily 
reach the threshold level of DMS even with pale ale malt.

Perhaps, but I think that the main reason you don't need a protein rest 
for most pale ale malts (and most modern lager/pils malts too) is because 
of higher modification.  The higher the level of modification, the more 
of the proteins in the barley will be convered to amino acids.  Modern 
malts are quite a bit more modified (even German lager/pils malts) than 
they used to be and therefore most malts don't need a protein rest.

US grains are the highest in protein, really, especially US 6-row, but 
protein levels have been climbing all over the world.  Why?  Fertilizers 
are increasing the nitrogen available to the barley and therefore increasing 
protein levels.  Farmers and maltsters care more about their yield than 
the brewers' so they use fertilizers.  During a talk at the first Sprit 
of Belgium, brewer Eric Toft reported that many brewers in Germany are 
having to eliminate or shorten protein rests because their malt is too 
well-modified.

Chill haze would be one problem, but I feel a bigger problem is *tons* 
of hot and cold break.  Another problem is yield.  The starch in the 
malt is bound in a protein matrix.  If the malt is indeed undermodified 
and you don't use a protein rest, you will have a lot of trouble getting 
out all the possible starch for conversion to sugar.  The level of 
modification is usually judged by the coarse/fine extract ratio.  If the 
ratio is big, you have lots of starch bound up in protein (low modific.). 
If the ratio is small, the malt is well-modified.  I don't have the 
ranges here at work, but I know that there is an explanation of this 
in the Great Grains Special Issue of Zymrugy and I believe it is 
explained in George Fix's Principles of Brewing Science. 
 
Personally, I try a small batch of beer with a new malt without a protein 
rest.  If 1/5 of the wort in the fermenter is hot and cold break, I 
know to use a protein rest with this malt in the future.

Yes, but I failed miserably.  I broke down and bought one in 1990 and 
another in 1991. 
 
But seriously... yes, your idea of cooling your fermenter by cycling 
ice will work.  You may want to consider using those Blue Ice packs 
which you can re-freeze.  They may also cool a little slower than pure 
ice and give you a more even temp.

This won't work David... wet cotton will block all the air.  Dry cotton

Sorry, but this is a very popular method that doesn't work.  It has even 
been published in a respected brewing magazine twice and it's still wrong. 
Bubbling air through hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, iodophor, bleach, etc., 
will NOT sanitize it.  The only place where the air touches the sanitizer 
is at the walls of the bubble.  You cannot make the bubbles small enough 
to kill all the airbourn wild yeast and bacteria.  When the bubbles pop 
in the hydrogen peroxide, they release all the nasties into the headspace 
of the jar and onward to the wort.  Boy, this method has the tenacity (and 
utility) of the Good Times virus! 
 
Get yourself a submicron air filter (Brewer's Resource has one, as does 
Heartland Hydroponics) and put that between the airpump and airstone.

Subject: Kegs and Olympia


Hello friends- 
 
 
I'm starting to gather the parts for kegging.  I recently 
bought 2 korny kegs ($15 each:).  They have three nipples (or 
whatever that collar is called that the gas/liquid fittings 
screw on to), the usuals gas and liquid nipples and one for a 
level sensor.  In the sensor's nipple, I could put a dip tube 
in and a fitting on.  There's four combo's, gas fitting/short 
tube, gas/long, liquid/short, liquid/long.  With two gas/ 
short's, I could have CO2/N2 for my stouts! 
 
Don't laugh, but does anyone have a good use for a third nipple?

I just moved to Lacey Washington, a suburb of Olympia.  Any 
homebrew shop, brew pub, micro brewery, mega-swillery 
info would sure be welcomed.  Anyone in the area want to swap 
a few cold homebrews?  I guess I'm a Northern Brewer now. 
 
Went to the Oly Brewery for the tour.  The guide didn't know 
what varieties of hops they used other than cascades.  I 
probably should have asked about the heart of the hop!  He also 
said "hops are the salt and pepper of beer", thinking of my 70 
IBU IPA, I told my friend that in my brewery "hops are the 
meat and potatoes of beer"!  The guide (and no one else that 
was working) wasn't a brewer and didn't know much about the 
brewing process. 
 
At the free beer part, I was talking with one of the servers. 
He was asking about my homebrew process and I was explaining 
how it was the basically the same as brewery.  He wasn't 
making the connection.  I thought for a while that I was going 
to have to explain the whole brewing process to him but he had 
to give the next tour! 
 
They make an Oly Dark that is thier basic Oly recipe with some 
roasted malt.  Kinda a no-frills lite porter (forgive me).  I 
was surprised how good it was (forgive me again).  It seemed 
like the tour group preferred it as well.  It's funny that 
their best beer is available in cans only at the brewery and 
it served at a handful of locations on tap

This may be possible but some time ago I saw an enamel pot that was used for

Subject: DMS from malts...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager... 
 
In recent conversations regarding DMS production from pils malt due 
to slow cooling, let us not forget that short boils leaves too much 
S-methyl methionine (SMM) left unconverted by the vigor of the boil. 
 
"OK, smarty-pants! Just what does this all mean," you ask. "Hmmmm?" 
 
Ah! Elementary, my dear Gaston, er Watson! SMM converts to DMS at 
temperatures around and above about 70'C (158'F). This occurs in 
your mash when the temperatures are near or above this target 
temperature, and occurs in butt-loads (Technical term. Sorry. I'll 
drop the jargon.) during the very hot boil. The evolving steam of 
the boil drives off the baby DMS that is born through this reaction. 
Capice? 
 
OK. Now, let's assume you truncate your boil, and cool s-l-o-w-l-y. 
There's *gobs* of SMM left in the wort, and your cooling will pass 
slowly from the boiling temperature to your pitching temperature. The 
thermometer stops for drinks around the 90'C area, and gets so 
plastered it just plain forgets to leave before its hosts throw him 
out at, say, 65'C. Ol' Mr. Temp then staggers and meanders through 
the thermophyllic bacteria ranges until he finally stumbles home at 
the pitching temperature. 
 
And his wife throws him out. True story. 
 
While old Jack Calorie was partying in that 100 to 65'C range, he 
thoughtlessly converted SMM to DMS. Since the whole works was losing 
steam (stupid joke intended), the DMS parasails did not fill, DMS did 
not waft away, and it remained to become a major flavor constituent 
of your beloved brew.. 
 
No matter how fast you cool, however, if the SMM is there to be 
converted, it will. Just that faster cooling minimizes it. Also, this 
is one instance where an immersion chiller may have the edge over a 
counterflow: The immersion immediately begins reduction of the 
temperature of the entire batch. DMS production will slow and 
eventually stop (assuming SMM is available for conversion) in the 
entire batch. With a CF chiller, the entire batch (less some delta 
batch in the chiller) pretty much sits at the temperature the boil 
left it, less the effects of air cooling, until it passes through. 
Granted, a CF is faster overall, but the wort is hotter longer. It is 
left as an exercise for the reader to ponder which is superior in 
this regard. 
 
Sooooooo..... 
 
A longer boil with slow cooling will produce less DMS than a short 
boil and slow cooling. FAST cooling with a truncated boil STILL 
sucks really bad. Thusly and therefor, I recommend a minimum 90 
minute boil, and cooling as quickly as possible. So there. QED. 
 
Back to the Pat cave... 
 
See ya!

This is very true.  I think that there are at least two reasons why this is 
the case.  First of all, the beer to be judged (and it *is* judged) is 
submitted separately from the beer at the festival and must be in bottles. 
So if the beer is only available on tap, the beer must be bottled -- many 
small breweries just fill a bottle from the tap and hope for the best. 
This also means that the beer submitted to the judging might only have the 
name in common with the beer served at the GABF (or at their brewery).  I 
also don't have to mention that the beer may not have been shipped in a 
refrigerated truck (while the larger quantity for the fest usually is). 
Second, there is a big time lag from when the beer must be received for 
judging and when it is actually judged, due to organizing the entries. 
While the beer is stored in a cooler, it's just not going to be as fresh as 
the stuff at the brewery.  Especially when you think about those tap-filled 
bottles.

I disagree with this.  As a participant, I have listened to the judges 
dicuss the entries.  They are conscientious in their assessment of the beer 
according to the style, they generally have experience with the style, and 
they generally have pretty good palates.  I still disagree with them 
sometimes based on tasting the same *bottles* that they do, but I respect 
their abilities.  Sometimes, too, there is quite a debate on whether to 
judge the beer based on the written style description or the consensus of 
what that style should *really* be.  All in all, it's much like a homebrew 
competition in this respect.  Addtionally, each beer is judged by a panel of 
at least 3 judges per round, with final rounds generally being judged by 6 
judges. 
 
I keep using the word "judge" intentionally.  While most of these industry 
professionals are not certified as judges by the BJCP, et al., they are 
experienced in brewing, analyzing, and evaluating the beer according to 
style.

This is also not true.  There has been some form of comment card for each 
beer for the last several years.  In the last couple of years, the 
organizers have been more insistent that they are filled out and that that 
they are passed on to the brewers.  Given that the goal is not so much to 
provide feedback to the brewers (like in a homebrew competition), but rather 
to pick the best, the judging procedure is much like a final round ranking 
in a homebrew competition.
