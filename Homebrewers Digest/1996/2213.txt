The lambic thread inspired me to mention this... 
 
For those of you in the vicinity of NYC, there's a place called Gingerman 
on 36th Street between 5th Ave and Madison Ave that has Boon Kriek on 
draught. Perhaps this isn't such an unusual thing, but I haven't 
encountered it elsewhere so it struck me as pretty special. This brew is 
absolutely sublime. Those of you who like lambics but have only had them 
in bottled form would be very pleased, I think.

Big whoops - I should have been Breiss, not M&F.

Breiss is 6-row, Schreier seems to be 6-row and M&F crystal tastes

As far as Homebrew Club competitions are concerned, the majority of 
them have BJCP qualified judges, which are *real* qualifications.  The 
BJCP qualifies that one can pass both a written and and a beer 
evaluation test with minimum score and does not advance in rank 
without additional higher test scores *and* experience points.  Being 
a BJCP qualified judge is a *meaningful* qualification. 
 
Do the "professionals" have equally as thorough of a qualification 
process as the BJCP certification, or can you qualify merely because 
you make money from brewing or selling beer?

Subject: Is it okay to re-pitch Nottingham yeast?


Dear HBD Collective, 
 
When liquid yeasts are used, it's fairly common practice to save the yeast 
cake from one batch of beer and pitch it in a subsequent batch.  I was won- 
dering if it's also okay to do this when a dried, reconstituted yeast (such 
as Nottingham) is used. 
 
I know that there were concerns in the past about the purity of the yeasts 
offered in dried form.  Is this still an issue? 
 
It's not that I'm a cheapskate, it's just that I hate to see a big, healthy 
colony of good yeast go to waste for no reason. 
 
Thanks in advance (that's "TIA" for those of you who only understand acro- 
nyms) for all feedback.

I recently brewed a extract/specialty grain stout.  When I racked it to the 
secondary I noticed a waxy looking whitish film over the top of the beer.  Now 
that it has been in the secondary for a few days, it is still there. The beer 
did not taste strange when I racked it.  I did use flaked barley and flaked 
wheat in this batch (steeped with my specialty grains).  What could this be? 
Any chance of it going away?

Hello all, 
 
Now that the RIMS that I have been building for 
what seems like forever is nearly operational, I'd 
like to give it a good cleaning before the first 
use.  We're talking about flux from soldering 
(lead-free of course), any manufacturing oils 
from parts, kegs that sat outside all year, 
some not-quite-new pieces of copper pipe, etc. 
 
I was thinking of giving the kegs a good scrub with 
some green pads and then running some vinegar & 
peroxide through the system, then boiling water. 
Finally, sanitizing w/ bleach and brewing. 
 
Any suggestions on technique, chemicals, etc? 
 
By the way, there are several of you reading this 
who have helped this project greatly.  Thank you 
very much.  We couldn't have done it without you.

No! winners are BREWED, not "found"!  ;) 
 
In general, I think it's a very honorable thing to NOT award medals if none 
of the entrants are good enough.  True, you would think that out of 83 
entries by professional brewers, at least 3 outstanding beers would be 
present, so Mark may have a point in some of these instances.  However, just 
being better than any others entered shouldn't be enough to get you a medal 
if your beer still isn't an outstanding example of style.

Erik Larson asks about using the Coleman 10 gallon rectangular 
cooler for mashing.  I've used mine for 3 years and it's still 
working great.  To make a false bottom do the following.  Go to 
the cooking section of any department store and get the 
perforated cooking sheet.  It has a ridge around it so you need 
to pound it flat.  Make a template of the cooler bottom and cut 
the pan bottom to fit.  drill extra holes on the sides as the 
cooler bottom is slightly larger than the hole grid on the pan. 
Go to your local hardware store and get a handy little item 
called a standoff screw.  Attach a standoff screw to each corner 
and you'll get about 1 1/2 ullage space at the bottom.  I also 
attached one in the middle, POINTING UP, which helps you lift the 
false bottom in and out.  If you need any more questions answered 
just send me an e-mail at jim.robinson`at`ast.com. 
 
Good luck!

Dave writes: 
>Pale Ale Malt is a British malt that is highly converted,and  low in protein 
>and in enzymes due to its relatively higher drying temperature... 
 
I pretty much agree except that the lower protein level is mostly because 
the malt is more modified -- i.e. more of the protein has been converted 
to amino acids during malting.  Higher drying temperatures are not going 
to change the protein content of the malt. 
 
>Pale Malt is a continental or american malt of which lager malt is a subset. 
>Lager malt is the least converted of the malts, has a higher enzyme content 
>and should be given a protein rest. 
 
I really think that associating "Pale Malt" with lager malt is a recent 
one.  Until a week ago (in our beta amylase discussion group), I have never 
heard anyone refer to "Pale Malt" unless they were simply referring to 
all pale malted barley (Pale Ale malt, Lager malt, Pils malt, etc.).  I 
suggest we don't need this new association to confuse new homebrewers. 
 
As far as I've read and based upon the homebrewing supply wholesalers I 
work with, "Lager Malt" and "Pilsner Malt" are used interchangably and 
refer to a simple, pale-coloured malted barley that is kilned cooler than 
Pale Ale malt.  From what I recall, there is no definite correlation 
between protein levels and differnt types of malt.  The only correlation 
I have seen is that 6-row is higher protein than 2-row, but this is 
correlated to the type of base barley and not the malt type that is made 
from it. 
 
As I have recently posted, most modern malts don't need a protein rest.

>Put in some finishing hops, say

I have tasted but one American Lager that had noticeable Cascade character. 
It was interesting, but not what I would call "conventional."  It's not 
that it is wrong to use Cascades, I just don't want anyone getting the 
idea that Cascades are typically the hop of choice for American Lagers. 
Perhaps Dave meant to say "Amercian Ales."  If this is the case, then, 
yes, Cascades are a very popular hop used in many, many American Ales 
and have a distinctive "grapefruit" aroma and favour.

I agree with chocolate malt, black patent, roasted barley and crystal malts. 
I disagree that you can simply steep any of the other malts mentioned. 
Victory, Biscuit, roasted pale malt (Pale Ale, Pilsner or Lager), Munich, 
Aromatic or any of the currently available smoked malts MUST be mashed or 
you will get a starch haze in your beer.  "Steeping" just doesn't do it. 
 
Later in his post, Ken describes a sort of mashing in the brewing water 
at 150 to 160F, but it is important to note that if you steep a pound 
of Pale Ale malt (for example) in 2.5 gallons of water, your pH is bound 
to be well over 6 and you will extract a lot of tannins from the husks. 
Furthermore, the enzymes are in the liquid part of the mash and if they 
are diluted as much as they would be in a "teabag" mash, not only would 
conversion take much longer than with a normal-thickness mash, but enyzyme 
stability would probably be compromised severely. 
 
Many have suggested (as Ken has) that you can mash grains as if they were 
tea in a big teabag, but I try to discourage this method.  Lautering 
involves the recirculation of the runnings till they are relatively clear 
and the amount of water per pound of grist is completely different.  These 
two differences are why you are at a high risk for starch haze and tannin 
extraction with this "teabag" method.

Jeff asks about sanitizing airstones. 
 
I suggest getting a Stainless Steel one (I know Liquid Bread has them 
and I believe that Brewer's Resource does too).  I replaced the PVC 
tubing with silicone (McMaster-Carr) and toss the stone and hose in the 
last 15 min of the boil.  Don't try this with PVC tubing.  It MIGHT work 
with HDPE tubing (that milky white tubing made for water lines at the 
hardware store), but it's only good to about 200F, so test it out on 
boiling water and maybe use a hose clamp to keep it on the tubing when 
it's really soft.  Silicone is good to 500F.

Subject: Rye beers/GABF judges/Greasy airlock


 
On the recent rye thread: 
For my taste, after about 20 rye beers, between 15-25% of the grain bill as 
rye adds a great character to a fairly standard ESB/Pale Ale/IPA recipe.  It 
certainly is not a "recognized style", but the astringent character of rye 
is mighty darn refreshing.  Redhook lately produces a rye...give it a try. 
 One poster indicated that flakes impart less rye character than grain, on 
what I assume is a pound per pound basis.  My experience is exactly 
opposite.  Guess I'll have to brew two similar batches and try....Bummer. 
Also, it will stick, and will slow your lauter, but if you know that up 
front, it's no big deal.  If you use a zapap, you'll probably notice, if you 
use a phils or another alternative like easymasher or a drain, you might 
not.  I tend to hop the whatnots outa my rye beer, and it becomes a dry and 
hoppy delight.  You oughta too.  That way, maybe my neighbors will drink 
your beer, and leave some of mine for me. 
 
On GABF judging: 
Hey, these guys were qualified enough to choose ol'Jethro's barleywine, 
were'nt they?  Works for me....Great beer, Jethro....and just cause they 
chose coors, I guess I'll buy a six and drink it until my homebrew is ready. 
 Budweiser always wins something too, and I think it comes from diabetic 
clydesdales. If you don't like the GABF judges, and their reasonably 
legitimate criteria outlined in previous posts,  don't enter.  If no one 
enters, it won't be much of a festival, and I bet they know that. That's why 
it is as legitimate as it is, and why some pretty nice folks work pretty 
hard making it better each year.  I'm the only thing in america which cannot 
stand improvement in 1996. 
 
Congrats, Jethro. If I ever get back to Manhattan, I'll stop by for a brew. 
 
On someone's  recent airlock leak: 
Yeah, I had a leaky airlock in the secondary, no activity, beer too sweet, 
jeez.  I remembered a tip about keglubing the airlock/stopper (was that Pat 
Babcock?), and I did it.  Well, Pat, we're back in bidness and my ruin is 
not beered.  It works ( no financial interest, just a cussed satisfier, 
etc.). 
 
Also, has anyone noticed that folks are speaking rather highly on this forum 
of Jack Schmidling?  Where are those Jack-Whackers of old?

i want to do a rye stout and i want to harness some of the ferulic acid in 
the rye and have some clove notes.  However, i do not want this to be as 
strong as a typical weissen bier.  what is a good yeast for this?  i've 
been thinking about wyeasts bavarian yeast because it speaks about mild 
ester production. 
 
does anybody have any suggestions?

Subject: GABF Judging:  Why?


 
In Homebrew Digest #2212, Mark Stevens joins one of brewing's oldest 
arguments: 
 
> I can understand wanting to withhold awards for beers that

> flawed, but I have always assumed that the role of a judge

Check your assumptions.  If the role of the judge is just to find winners, 
why hold the competition at all?  Is the purpose of the competition 
is to advance the craft of brewing by recognizing excellence, or to give 
a few breweries a marketing advantage?

Having judged commercial competitions, I don't find it in the 
least bit surprising.

My opinion:  Homebrew competitions and commercial competitions 
are fundamentally different animals, with fundamentally different purposes. 
A homebrew competition is to help the brewers entering the competition 
develop their skills through useful feedback, and to encourage them to do 
so by recognizing the best efforts.  Relatively narrowly-defined styles are 
the standards their success is judged against.  A commercial competition 
assumes that the brewers already know what they're doing, and tries to 
encourage excellence in the craft as a whole by recognizing outstanding 
results.  In that context, styles should be far less rigidly interpreted; 
my 
own standard is whether the beer can broadly be said to meet the general 
expectations commonly understood to be implied by the name the brewer's 
given it.  The main criteria should be, in my view, if the beer is 
well-made 
and drinkable.  Yes, this is a far more subjective view -- unless the 
brewer 
helps you out by entering seriously flawed beer.  In a recent commercial 
competition, 14 of the 21 entries in one category I judged were seriously 
infected or had other egregious flaws.  Yes, two-thirds, in a competition 
only the breweries could enter, where the beer was received at the coldbox 
and kept chilled until judging.  I've often heard commercial brewers on 
panels like that express surprise that brewers are accepting money for 
such beers, and customers are paying it.  I'm sure breweries take a little 
more care for the GABF, but similarly, I see no reason why the judges 
shouldn't expect them to.  That the judges refused to be intimidated or 
okey-doked into awarding unearned medals is the best thing I've heard 
about this competition so far.

Subject: Choreboy


Brewsters: 
 
I sometmes forget we are an international group and US trademarked products 
don't mean much in many cases. I recently got an inquiry about what I meant by 
"Choreboy" in a couple of my notes. 
 
Here was my response: 
 
Boy, you need to spend more time in the kitchen doing your chores! 
 
A Choreboy (R) is a metal scrubber like steel wool except it is made from metal
turnings which are wider. It typically comes in copper or stainless steel. It  
comes soaped or unsoaped. In our case it is used as a strainer so the hops and 
the hot break trub ( which is filtered by the hops) won't pass over into the 
fermentation vessel along with the clarified wort. 
 
Procedure is to put the bottom end of the racking cane ( a piece of 3/8 inch 
copper or SS, or plastic or whatever tubing, for example) by shoving the cane 
inside the Choreboy.  Try to place the end of the cane in the center of the 
Choreboy, wire it in place with a piece of heavy copper wire ( like #12 or #10 
)
or strong cotton string.  Swirl the boiled wort with a sterile spoon until a 
small depression forms in the liquid ( called whirlpooling). Allow it to stand 
about 5 or ten minutes to settle so the hops and trub form a pile in the middle
of the boiler.  Place the racking cane near the bottom edge and start your 
siphon.  The wort will come over virtually free of hops or trub and most 
importantly you have not unnecessarily aerated your wort, especially if it is 
hot.

Simple doesn't always work if you leave a long time between uses, but here's 
how
I do it and have for years. The cleanest and the spot with the most good yeast 
and least junk is your secondary.  After I bottle or keg, I leave only a few 
ounces of beer in the bottom.  I swirl this to loosen the yeast deposit and 
clean the neck of the carboy and pour the slurry into a 12 oz beer bottle which
has been sterilized with bleach and rinsed with three rinses of boiling water, 
likewise the funnel. Cap immediately and place in the fridge. When you want to 
use it, pop the top and pour only the slurry portion into a waiting solution 
made up of hopped wort extract ( 1/4 cup approx) in 1 pint of water. Boil for 1
minute uncovered until it foams up and resides, then boil gently  with the lid 
on for five minutes or so to sterilize the pan. Cool it without taking off the 
lid. Add this to your starter bottle. Pour off the beer above the yeast slurry 
and taste it. If it is OK, then the yeast are OK. Add the yeast slurry to the 
starter bottle and stand back.   You will have an active starter in about 12 
hours or at least in 24. 
 
If you want to wash up some yeast that are bacterially infected, wash them in a
solution of 30 ppm metabisulfite  acidified with tartaric acid,followed by a 
sterile (boiled, cool)  water rinse.  Allow them to settle for a few minutes 
between washings, but don't be concerned if some of them get carried over in 
the
rinse water. Place these washed yeast in a starter. I have used this many times
to freshen up a yeast. I think a lot of the talk about mutations etc. is really
just a simple bacterial infection. 
 
Lager yeasts are the most difficult to keep, since they are marginally active 
even near freezing. As a result they tend to autolyse. I would suggest you use 
a yeast slurry made up in 10% glycerin and put this in the freezer.  When it 
comes time to awaken them, just put this slurry  in a starter and allow it to 
ferment for a few days until it is quiet and flocs.  Pour off the starter beer 
and prepare another starter. This will eliminate any concerns some have 
expressed about glycerin. A far as I know, it is safe in small quantities.

Bill Rust asks about Berliner Weisse. Take a look in Eric Warner's Book "German
Wheat Beer", Classic Beer Style Series #7 from Brewers Pubs.   I doubt the 
Germans put Acidophilus in their beers 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Lenny from Rehoveth, Israel asks how to use his finely ground malt intended for
baking. Above all use a mash which will float the malt ( an OG of greater than 
about 1.060) this will make the straining off easier  1) Try batch sparging in 
which you pour the mash into a sparging solution and then decant. Repeat.to an 
SG of 1.010 or so. Remember lots of small washes are better then one or two big
ones.  2) Use wheat or rice hulls mixed in with the mash at the end to prevent 
laying down a solid bed if you try a conventional sparge. 3) use adjunct 
grains,
to provide some looseness to the sparge. Let us know how it works. 
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Jorge Blasig writes about his starter not producing enough yeast.  1) don't 
worry it will be OK 2) Once it starts bubbling, not much growth occurs because 
all the oxygen is used up.  Swirl your starter to mix in air and get CO2 out. 
This will help  3) honey doesn't have much in the way of nutrients, so yeast 
nutrients may be needed in the starter and the mead. 
 
What happened to that beer you were brewing from baker's malt extract?

The bottled entries have to be there *FIVE WEEKS* before judging?  Does the 
GABF provide proper storage?  Unless stored badly, all but the poorest 
bottled beers should survive five weeks. 
 
Sounds like the GABF is dodging again.

 When using the wild yeasts to ferment a cider, would it be better to 
use an open fermentation, or a closed one with an airlock?  I'm going to do 
an experiment with different yeasts in some small batches to see which one 
comes out best.  I would think that a closed fermentation would be better, 
to avoid other contaminants entering the must, but I thought I'd contact a 
higher power (you folks) to get some input.

Subject: Lautering Rye / Filtering Air 


     I've noticed two people say that they have used substantial quantities 
     of rye with no lautering problems.  As you have all read, this is NOT 
     my experience.  I think I may know part of the reason. 
 
     My Roggen beer was double decocted.  Contrary to what one might think, 
     decocted mashes have LESS structure than infusion mashes and are 
     therefore sometimes more difficult to lauter (they even look "mushier" 
     than infusion mashes). 
 
     Proteins are a large part of what gives a grain it's structural 
     support (along with cellulose), and decocting does a wonderful job of 
     breaking them down. 
 
     Perhaps decocting is not the way to go when homebrewing a rye beer! 
 
     ----------------------- 
 
     About airstones and filtering air:  I use a pump, the air gets pushed 
     through some dry cotton (to catch things like dog hair, etc.), and I 
     don't use an airstone. 
 
     Some people seem to have problems with airborne microbes (Al K. posted 
     his problem), but I never have, so I don't filter my air through a .2u 
     disk.  I don't bother with an airstone because I'm too lazy to 
     maintain it.  Sure, the bigger bubbles may take a bit longer to aerate 
     the wort, but I just turn the pump on and go about my business.  It's 
     no big deal (for me) to let it run for an hour. 
 
     Just my experience, take it for what it's worth when deciding if 
     you're going to aerate with a pump or not. 
 
     Have fun!
