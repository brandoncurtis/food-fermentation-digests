While David is correct that this is a great way to drill a fridge, 
don't make the mistake of doing this to a chest freezer.  The door of 
the fridge has no cooling coils in it.  The wall of a chest freezer 
does and it is *very* hard to miss one with a 1" hole.  If anyone 
needs instructions on drilling into a freezer, let me know and I will 
pass them on.

Subject: How much Peated malt


 
Regarding recent questions to how much peated malt to use --- 
 
Peated malt is rated in parts per million of phenol.  The light is 4-6ppm and 
the heavy is 5-12 ppm.  The light is a little less variable in its ppm and 
thus would be more consistent from batch to batch. 
 
I have found that 1# of light peat is sufficient for a 10 gal batch in my 
porters. 
 
Here is a recipe of mine for a smoked porter: 
(This won first in a local contest in specialty category) 
(10 Gallons) 
20 # Eng Pale malt 
2# Baird Brown malt 
1# Crystal (155) 
1# Crystal (75) 
1# Chocolate 
1# light Peat malt 
 Note: All above malts are Hugh Baird  - malted in UK

I have a similar set up at home. It lauters very well because of the larger 
surface area. I have no pegs or supprts under the perforated stainless ( 10 
guage BTW ) the disk of perf. just sets on the top of the curve of the keg ( 
where the side wall meets the bottom. It has been in use for almost 10 years 
and is still holding. As for the increased amount of volume under the false 
bottom it is inconsequential. 
   have fun. 
 
      I have attended 5 GABFs over the years and I must say that it is a 
facinating event. As to the PPBT aspect, it, like any other beer competition 
has something of  a crap shoot to it, oh well. At each of the GABFs I have 
tasted gold medal winners that were great beers and gold medal winners that 
were undrinkable. Also I have tasted many that were excellent beers that 
received no award. I must agree that the brewery entries for the judging may 
not be in as good of shape as the kegs on the festival. We had to ship our 
entries to a drop off piont in Northern California a full two months prior to 
the competition and it was product simply pulled from inventory, I am certain 
that this is how many breweries do this. I have a medal from a few years back 
so I got no real bitch, except that maybe the event is getting to large to 
handle. 
 
PS. I tasted Jethros barleywine before the award was given out and find it to 
be excellant. Likewise for the third place barleywine. The second place 
winner was undrinkable however. So there you go.

Michael 
 
British beers are amazing things aren't they. My only complaint is that some 
can be too sweet and unnatural tasting like Newcastle Brown. Boddingtons and 
Flowers are great, try Courage's Directors Bitter if you get a chance. Here 
in Australia Boddingtons Pub Ale is becoming common. I prefer it to their 
bitter as it is stronger and uses the draught flow system. Anyway Brew Your 
Own Real Ale at Home has recipes for Boddingtons and Flowers. These recipes 
are for 6 gallons (23 litres). 
 
Boddingtons Bitter 
================== 
 
OG                      1035 
Bitterness              30 IBU 
Final Volume            23 litres 
 
Pale Malt               3700g (96.5%) 
Black Malt                20g (0.5%) 
 
Cane Sugar              120g (3%) 
 
Fuggles                  29g (start of boil) 4.5% Alpha 
Goldings                 21g (start of boil) 5.3% Alpha 
Whitbread Goldings       13g (start of boil) 6.3% Alpha 
Northern Brewer           3g (last 15 minutes) 
Bramling Hops             5g (last 15 minutes) 
East Kent Goldings       10g (last 15 minutes) 
 
Irish Moss               1 tsp (last 15 minutes) 
 
Mash Liquor             9 litres 
Mash Temp               65C 
Mash Time               90 mins 
Boil Time               2 hours 
Alcohol %               3.6% 
FG                      1008 
 
These recipes are calculated on 70% extraction and 20% bittering hop 
utilisation. You may need to recalcualte, particularly for the hops - say at 
25%, to achieve 1035 and 30 IBU. 
 
 
The flowers is simplier 
 
Flowers Original Bitter 
======================= 
 
OG                      1044 
Bitterness              30 IBU 
Final Volume            23 litres 
 
Pale Malt               3150g (65%) 
Crystal                  360g (7.5%) 
Torrefied wheat          725g (15%) 
 
Maltose syrup            600g (12.5%) 
 
Target Hops               31g (start of boil) 11.2% Alpha 
styrian goldings           3g (start of boil)  7.9% Alpha 
styrian goldings          10g (last 15 minutes) 
Irish moss              1 tsp (last 15 minutes) 
styrian goldings           5g (dry hoppped in cask) 
 
Mash liquor             11 litres 
Mash Temp               65C 
Mash Time               90 minutes 
Boil Time               2 hours 
Alcohol %               4.5% 
FG                      1010 
 
Isn't that an easy way to layout a recipe. You can see the recipe at a 
glance. One can make great beer with a bit of substitution for available 
ingredients. Just using more pale malt instead of the maltose syrup would be 
the most obvious, particularly with the outrage that not using all malt will 
cause amongst HBD recipients. I haven't tried using maltose but might give 
it a go down the track. Just to completely inflame the morally pure, Dave 
Line says that commerical beers don't ferment out as far as the small volume 
homebrews and recommends 5 saccharine tablets. Haven't tried it but if you 
like Newcastle Brown (too artificial for me) then go for it. Flaked wheat 
can be substitued for torrefied.

Subject: Counterflow Chiller (Starting)


Hi everyone. Did 2 all grain batches this week. Gets a little easier 
everytime. Its not the time I mind so much but the stress involved. 
Which leads me to the only stressful part left and that is starting my 
wort chiller. I've tried filling the thing with water, but it just never 
works. I allways end up sucking on the hose (all sanitation principles 
go right out the window at this point), 
 
Any Advice appreciated. I am coming out of a valve at the bottom of my 
boil pot into a 25 foot of coiled copper in garden hose setup. 
 
The chiller works fine once the siphon starts.

beer, like scotch is an acquired taste. start with things like pete's/sams 
summer brews. they have some flavor, but not too much. move up to other 
things like sam boston ale, and anchor steam. oktoberfest is a good beer, 
because it has malt flavor, but it is not bitter. 
when i met my boss, he was a dedicated bud-lite man. our dbase consultant

Over the last four years, I have been involved with organizing and 
running the Michigan State Fair homebrew competition.  We have always 
invited professionals from local breweries to participate in our 
best-of-show panel.  This includes the Stroh Brewing Co., a local 
"megaswill" company. 
 
I have been impressed with the depth and breadth of knowledge these 
folks brought to the table.  One year, the panelist from Stroh 
deconstructed a barleywine recipe by tasting it.  The brewer was in 
the audience, and his mouth dropped further and further as the 
panelist described what he was tasting. 
 
In my experience, these guys may not sell a weizen, but they know what 
it's supposed to taste like, and they know when it's good or bad.

Subject: Duvel "prep


Hey, 
 
Having heard much about Duvel, yet never seeing it in my local Beer 
store, I jumped at the chance to buy a bottle (25 oz) at a 
reasonable(?) price of USD 8.99.  I eagerly anticpate enjoying this 
ale, but I've several questions.  The first Q' is: Is there any 
particular way that Duvel should be served?  The bottle says to serve 
at 45F - 50F, but Michael Jackson (Beer Companion, I think) says that 
Belgians will drink it "ice cold"..... 
 
Next Q's:  I have heard that the yeast in the bottle is a combination 
of yeasts. Has anyone attempted to use the yeast(s) (as Duvel is 
"re-fermented" in the bottle) for an ale of their own?  If so, how 
difficult was it to "propagate" the yeast into a large enough starter? 
 
TIA for any replies.

Subject: sanitizing mash tun


Just a quick question: what is the consensus regarding sanitizing the 
mash tun.  My feeling (from a foodservice standpoint) is that for an 
infusion mash at 150 F +/-, no bugs should grow (health department 
addage: keep hot foods hot i.e. 140 F or higher).  Additionally, the 
extract is being boiled which should kill any bugs also.  Any 
comments?  Kevin

Subject: Smoked Malt, Unbeliever's Six Pack


SMOKED MALT 
I have been catching up on HBD reading and have also a accidentally deleted a 
few before reading. OOPS! I have caught the tail of the Hugh Baird Peated Malt 
discussion. I have not tried this malt but have recently used german (from 
Bamburg) smoked malt. This is smoked over beech wood I believe. My recipe used 
10% smoked malt in the grain bill and this produced a distinct smoky taste 
without being overpowering. The recipe also included melanoidin malt, crystal 
malt, and roast barley. It is one of my most successful brews and it will 
certainly become one of my standard recipes. So try this malt if you are having
difficulty with the Hugh Baird. 
 
UNBELIEVER'S  SIX PACK 
Ken Schwartz asked for suggestion for a six pack of outstanding beers. Well 
here
my (first) effort. I do not include ant US beers because I haven't tried many 
not because of any chauvinism (honest). 
 
Schneider Weisse 
Alexander Rodenbach (not the Grand Cru because I've never tried it) 
Courage Imperial Russian Stout 
Cantillon Framboise 
Pilsner Urquell (even if they have scrapped their open wood fermenters--the 
fools) 
Orval 
 
Of course as a jingoistic Brit I would have liked to include some 
cask-condition
beers but a six pack of firkins might be a little unmanageable!

Subject: 1st all-grain questions


Well, I took the plunge this weekend and attempted my first all-grain 
batch. 
There were some definite problems along the way, but I think I actually 
ended 
up with something relatively close to what I was aiming for.  We'll see in 
due time. 
Now that I've tried it, I have a few questions for the experienced mashers 
in the 
crowd. 
 
1) I used a 5 gallon Rubbermaid/Gott with a Phil's Phalse Bottom.  My 
recipe 
used 4.7 lbs. of grain (it was a half batch).  I was doing an infusion mash 
with a target temperature of 154F.  To calculate how much/what temp. water 
I would need, I tried to use Suds.  It said I should use 1.76 gal. of 169F 
water to reach my target temp. at a grain to water ratio of 1.5 quarts/lb. 
Ok, 
sounds good.  I overheated my water to about 173F accidentally, but it 
still 
took me almost 2 gal. to bring the temp. just to 150F!  Why was I so far 
under?  I'm assuming that it was me that was off, not Suds.  My wife 
suggested that I should have 'pre-heated' the mash tun with hot water 
before 
infusing.  Is that where all my heat went? 
 
2) I tried to make up for the 'extra' water I had to add by draining some 
of 
the wort off, boiling it, and adding it back for mash-out.  I didn't seem 
to 
raise my temperature much at all, or so it seemed.  Then I started to 
wonder.  After an infusion, should I wait a bit for things to settle before 
measuring temperature?  I was working very quickly to avoid any heat loss 
from leaving the lid off.  Maybe I was measuring temp. too soon? 
 
Well, even though I had a few more 'accidents' like sparging the floor 
and trying to use my new immersion chiller only to have it spray all over 
my wife due to a busted gasket, I now have some OG 1.044 pale ale 
fermenting away.  That was the ONE thing that went well.  I used a starter 
for the first time (I'm very new to brewing, with only 1 extract/specialty 
grains batch in recent memory) that was made from a propagated Wyeast 
1056, and fermentation took off somewhere between 6-7 hours.  I'm not 
sure what I'm fermenting, but it sure is fermenting well!

My choices (and why): 
 
Sierra Nevada Pale Ale - To introduce the person (for the first time) to hops. 
Pilsner Urquell - To give comparison to what American Premiums claim to be. 
Belhaven Scottish Ale - To introduce the person to malt. 
Redhook's Wheathook or Hefe-Weizen - To give an introduction to wheat. 
Guiness Stout - Does this need explanation? 
Samuel Smith Imperial Stout - To take a giant step off the beaten trail. 
 
It was very tempting to put in a lambic or a speciality such as a fruit beer, 
pepper beer, or - especially - a smoked beer and I would've preferred to 
substitute an Oktoberfest for the scottish ale, but I was afraid that it might 
not
pass the "locally available" test.  (I'm presuming a small, but metropolitan 
market area; the kind where the package stores have just moved beyond the 
all-American-lager stage and are beginning to stock some imports and 
microbrewery products.) 
 
Another interesting list would be to attempt to make up a similar six-pack, but
limit oneself to the products sold by or through the three majors (i.e. 
Redhook),
figuring that they may be the only products available in a lot of smaller 
towns.
I can't do it because I'm wholly unfamiliar with the Miller (a/k/a Plank Road) 
and
Coors (a/k/a Blue Moon) products. 
 
A third interesting one would be the last, plus Boston Beer, Pete's, and the 
better-distributed micros, but eliminating all imports.

Subject: RE: Fantasy 6-pack / Beer styles


     Ken asks for an educational 6 pack.  I thought it best to do a world 
     tour, picking styles that are vastly different.  Here goes: 
 
     England:  Fuller's ESB 
     Ireland:  Guinness Stout 
     USA:      Sierra Nevada Pale Ale 
     Germany:  Spaten Optimator 
     Belgium:  Boon Kriek 
     Czech:    Pilsner Urquell (although it doesn't travel well, it can be 
               very good) 
 
     ------------------------ 
 
     A couple of other responses to this question contained remarks that I 
     would like to address.  Most of these are "stylistic confusion," 
     caused in part by a lack of beer education and in part by the 
     confusing (and sometimes misleading) labeling practices of many 
     brewers: 
 
     First, "amber ale" is not a recognized style, as far as I know.  It is 
     more of a generic label that is put on beer that is a bit too bland to 
     be called American pale ale. 
 
     Secondly, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is NOT an IPA (nor does it claim to 
     be), nor should an IPA be light! 
 
     India Pale Ale SHOULD be a high-alcohol, aggressively hopped beer. 
     The combination of alcohol and hops made it resistant to microbial 
     challenge, so it kept well during overseas shipment (esp. to troops in 
     India, hence the name of the style). 
 
     There are few, if any, proper, traditional IPA's out there.  Brooklyn 
     brewery has made several different versions of it, and the latest 
     batch, available on tap at bars in NY city, is very well hopped, but I 
     would still like to see it be a bit "bigger" in body and alcohol (just 
     my opinion; very good beer, though). 
 
     Third, the belief that "good" beer can ONLY be cask conditioned ale is 
     quite limiting.  While a good, properly served, cask ale is a thing of 
     tremendous beauty, so is a good Dopplebock, as is a bottle-conditioned 
     Trappist ale, etc.  Variety is exciting, why limit yourself? 
 
     Life is short, drink hard!

Subject: Pumpkin-spiced Ale/Heated yeast storage.


HBD, 
 
        Bernard D Hummel (hummelbe`at`pilot.msu.edu) asked a few weeks ago 
about favorite recipes for a seasonal pumpkin/spiced ale.  I too was 
interested in making a batch.  Since fall is starting, now would be the 
time to start a batch with ripening fresh pumpkins.  Unfortunately, I 
didn't see any responses the first go around, so I figured I'd ask again. 
TIA 
 
        Also, if you remember, I made a post about the probable 
survivability of Wyeast packets that got stuck in shipping in a HOT Texas 
warehouse for the weekend.  I've since used two of the packets, both worked 
great.  In fact, one (champagne yeast for a mead) even had the added 
disadvantage of being 13 months old!  Despite this it was fully inflated 4 
days after "smacking".  Moral:  Wyeast foil yeast packets are durable as 
heck, and, "Don't worry, have a homebrew." -CP

Louis Bonham asked about the diameter and thread spec's for poppet 
valves on a cornelius kegs.  I looked for the same thing a while back 
and while I can't give the specs I did find a place that can supply adapters 
to NPT sizes.  I bought them from South Bay Homebrew Supply at (800) 608-2739 
in Torrance, CA.  They have all sorts of keg fittings and although I don't 
think the adapters are listed in their catalog they had them when I called and 
asked.  I used the adapter to plumb up a through the wall refrigerator fitting 
for CO2 so I could have the tank outside and still be able to easily disconnect
it for carbonating, etc.

I recently had to do this for a group of friends.  I chose: 
1: Coors Lite 
2: Foster's Lager 
3. Pilsner Urquell 
to illustrate the variation between lager's which were assumed to be the 
same 
 
4. Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Ale 
5. Redhook ESB 
6. Guiness Pub Draft 
to illustrate the difference between lagers and ales, and between ales. 
 
Sampled in order, they're pretty good at illustrating the variation in 
beers, going from a beer best described as making love on a beach 
(coorslite, it's f*%&#  near water) into flavorful other beers. 
  Fosters/Pilsner Urquell is an interesting contrast, and the ales are 
wonderful.  After we were done, nobody wanted another coors.

Subject: Metallic taste from chiller


While brewing this weekend, I figured out why my previous batch tasted 
metallic at OG testing, racking and bottling. 
I never soaked the inside, only outside, DOH!, of my new 50 foot 
counterflow chiller in vinegar. 
 
With this batch I ran cold tap water through the chiller for 15 minutes 
and the exiting water still tasted metallic. 
 
Then I used a funnel to pour in vinegar until what exited tasted like 
vinegar, waited 30 minutes, and flushed until the exiting water tasted 
fine.  The wort going into the fermenter tasted great. 
 
Three questions: 
1.  Is the amount of copper in the previous batch harmful? 
2.  Will the copper taste diminish in the bottle over time? 
3.  When storing the rinsed counter flow chiller should I store it empty, 
full of water, full of a water and vinegar solution, iodophor and water 
or some other method? 
 
 
I'd appreciate any relevant advice.

Howdy Brewers, 
 
Just thought I'd chime in on the eclectic 6-pack thread... 
 
Pilsner             - Pilsner Urquell 
   (tough to get an untainted one in the Midwest, tho) 
Wit                 - Celis 
Pale Ale            - Sierra Nevada 
ESB                 - Red Hook 
Dunkel Weizzen Bock - Aiyinger 
Dry Stout           - Guinness Extra Stout 
 
Other possible substitutes:  Celis Pale Bock, maybe a classic Lambic 
(Boon?), Chimay ale, perhaps a Pete's Wicked Strawberry Blonde ale, and 
Sierra also makes an extremely good dry stout. 
 
Dang, this thread makes my mouth water!  Later and see ya after I get married.
