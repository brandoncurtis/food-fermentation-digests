Subject: Raw wheat sources: A quick report on my results


I have made several batches of beer using either raw wheat 
or raw barley (stout %25).  In pushing the envelop of cost 
to the lowest possible point i thought that using flour for 
a raw wheat would be an idea worth trying.    I had been 
certain that a mash that was half flour and half barley 
would clog my mash tun unrecoverably.  As it turned out 
i was only partly right.  It cloged but not beyond the point 
of recovery.  Here's what i did. 
 
I doughed in the flour to 104df water with about 1/4 of 
the barley desired in the final mash.  I used a big 
sifter and slowly stired and shook to get an even distribution 
with no lumps.  I used whole wheat flour.  After a 45 minute 
rest at 104 i boosted to 121 for 30m.  then to 135 for 15m. 
Then on to 140 for 30m and 158 for 30m.  Then i brought the 
whole thing to a boil for a few minutes.  I was attempting to do the 
procedure known as double mashing.  I then let the mash cool to 140 
and added the rest of the barley.  Then i raised it slowly 
to 158.  Mashed for 60 minutes.  Next i boosted with heat 
to 170, added my steaped crystal and rested for 10m. 
 
After this regime i transfered to the lauder and attemped to 
start my sparge.  My lauder tun is a 1/2 bbl keg with a double 
easy masher in the bottom.  It is able to drain 10g in 2 minutes. 
The suction can be quite high, but with a normal mash i can 
open the valve fully.  In this case that was a mistake. 
It cloged immediately and took about 45 to get 2 gallons. 
I restired and opened the valve slowly.  This allowed me 
to sparge at a more reasonable rate. 
 
I have made the same beer using wheat flakes and a simple 40/50/60/70C 
schedule.  The flour was much more difficult and probibally not 
worth the time.  Flaked cost me about $.60/# and ww flour is about 
$.43/#, general purpose is $.20/$.

Daniel Goodale (his real name) asks about bergamot, the herb which gives 
Earl Gray it's wonderful aroma.  This is also known as bee-balm, it is a 
plant with beautiful pinkish flowers and very fragrant leaves.  You might 
try finding some dried from an herb place, or growing your own.  I would 
avoid "aromatherapy grade' oil, unless you know how it was extracted, there 
could be some decidedly non food-grade residues in there.

Some points: 
- -Was George referring specifically to Coopers Sparkling Ale? This defines 
the style, but there are several imitators. I also find the yeast from the 
bottle to be a good performer at high temperatures. It can be very phenolic, 
in addition to the esters. The yeast found in Coopers kits *is not the same* 
as in the bottle. It is supplied to Coopers by Mauri Foods. And forget the 
instructions in the kits - they must be the worst in existence. I have 
spoken to the manager of the homebrew division of Coopers about this. He 
told me they say 25C just so those who live in the tropics are not put off 
about making them! 20C gives a better result.

What's the deal with rice hulls? I want to make a 100% wheat beer. What

What kind of spectrum does it analyze?  Why is it better 
than the standard ways of measuring things like extract, 
IBUs, color (which isn't actually on your list I guess)? 
The ASBC and other groups have standard methods for measuring 
these things.

Well, you missed quite a few.  One of my favorites would be 
the hop oils.  You might do DMS, H2S... 
 
To what end would you build this 
library?  Which esters smell good and which smell bad?  What 
ratios of various things work and what ratios don't?  When is 
a level of chemical X too much?  How about when the level of 
chemical Y various?  Morton Meilgard (?) and others have identified 
>900 taste compounds in beer.  That's a lot of dimensions.  Have 
fun "training" your pallette.  I'm having fun training mine, 
but at least I'm drinking beer while I'm doing it. 
 
How is your desire to build the library related to wanting 
beers from the peanut gallery?  Should I wait until you're 
almost done with it before I send mine in so I can get 
a more complete analysis?  Wouldn't shelling out a few 
bucks for some pure versions of these chemicals make it a 
lot easier to train? 
 
I got three emails about my first followup.  All three scolded 
me for not realizing you were joking.  I'm still vacillating 
between joke and scam. 
 
I'll be taking any further responses off line. 
==================================== 
 
I should point out that I was slightly glib in my first 
followup.  Everyone should realize that formulae like 
the one I tossed out are rules of thumb that work OK 
for homebrewers who, in general, are measuring things 
rather inaccurately to start with.

Subject: Beer is Beer Six Pack


I've noticed 2 beers that have been on virtually everyone's list that 
I have what I think are relevant stories about. 
 
Guinness Stout - I was having dinner in Washington D.C. at the 
Rathskeller(?) which served literally hundreds of beers from all over 
the world. One of the fellows with us wasn't much of a beer drinker, 
but was in a good mood to try something different. I suggested a 
German pils to start. He really liked it. He asked me to suggest 
something else. I went for an English ale. Bulls Eye!  Finally after 
the meal, I decided on a nice thick Guinness Stout "for dessert". My 
friend eagerly followed my example and ordered the same. I took a 
long draw on mine and waxed eloquently about the perfection of the 
brewing art.  My friend took a strong chug on his. His eyes got big 
and he came real close to losing his dinner! I went too far. But I 
did get to finish his Guinness :-). Moral: you can push too far too 
fast. 
 
Pilsner Urquell - About 15 years ago, I was on a business trip with a 
young colleague in Orlando. After work, we went to a shopping mall 
and came across a little liquor store that had a sign advertising 
imported beers. I had a reputation of being a beer aficionado, and so 
was answering lots of questions from the young fellow about the finer 
points of beers of the world. He had never had anything other than 
Budmilloors. Wanting to win him over to the world of good beer, I 
went in and bought a couple of bottles of Pilsner Urquell. I waxed 
eloquently about how this was perhaps the single best beer in the 
world, yadda yadda yadda. I poured the beers emphasizing the thick 
luscious head that was formed...the rich golden color... Took a swig 
and nearly gagged. SKUNK CITY. Young impressionable guy was NOT 
impressed. Is that why it's called PU?  He's probably drinking Coors 
Light to this day. As several have pointed out here, PU does not 
always travel well. Moral: taste it before you offer it up. 
 
Cheers!

Subject: many many beer related


1)  i read this in hbd refering to a recent trip to England.  sorry i 
didn't get who wrote it!:-( 
they briefly mentioned a 
recent, annual real ale competition. The winner was called Harvest Festival 
from the Orange Brewery in Pimlico.  .  . Harvest Festival turned out to 
be a superb Bitter. Interestingly enough, it was not a traditional English 
Bitter because it was strongly hopped with Cascades (one of my favorite 
hops), which would be more typical of an American Pale Ale. Apparently, the 
English liked Cascades enough to make Harvest Festival this years winner. . 
.The Harvest Festival ale 
was brewed from the same recipe as their standard Bitter, called SW1, except 
that it used Cascade hops in place of the Kent Goldings they usually used. 
 
reading on the PPBT deal about english real ales that are not worthy of 
accailm because they use american hops i have to stop and say,  what the . 
. .? 
if brits award real ales hopped with cascades why can't we damn yankees? 
 
2)  i mashed a pale ale today.  my first all-grain.  only one problem 
turned up.  after 2.5 hrs `at` 158, iodine still indicated incomplete 
conversion.  i relaxed, didn't worry, told myself that it was just a test 
run anyway and proceeded to proceed with sparging as usual.  the final 
result was a gravity of about 1.052 on a target of 1.060.  my question: 
was my iodine erronious or is does my gravity reflect some starch content 
or what.  complicating the whole thing is the fact that when i began my 
protein rest, i overshot the temp to 132 but let it cool to 122.  did this 
deactivate the lower temp enzymes.  put more generally, does an 
overshooting of tempature affect enzyme activity at lower foregone temps? 
are enzymes like yeasts in that they die at higher temps?  what is an 
enzyme anyway?  is it like a tribble?  what's going on here?  should i have 
been even more patient??? 
 
3)  i asked before, i'll ask again:  does anyone know about any similar 
forums held for professional brewers.  i would like to ask some equipment 
questions. 
 
thanks alot. 
prost, salud, nostrovia and 
 
cheers,

I'm not sure if this is worth posting, but it surprised me a bit and I 
thought I'd mention it for the record... 
 
I just pitched a package of Wyeast 1056 into a starter flask, and noticed 
that the wort coming out of the package looked a little off in color. 
Then I caught a brief whiff of sulfery odor. 
 
After getting the starter squared away, I sniffed the cut corner of the 
Wyeast package...a little strange. Gave the envelope a little squeeze and 
the sharp sour/sulphery smell nearly bowled me over. Badly infected. 
 
Evil is breeding in my starter flask. Think I will get rid of it. :)

I need the wisdom of the collective: I have finally made up my mind 
to get a chest freezer for lagering (I bought a Hunter Airstat when they 
were still available, and it sits there, taunting me.) 
 
My vision is that it will hold at least two 6-1/2 gallon carboys, in their 
styrofoam nests (so they can be lifted in and out.)  Has any one 
bought one to hold these 25 liter carboys?  Are some brands 
better than others (reliability/cost to operate/quietness/etc?)

Subject: RE: Starchy beer / Liquid Pumpkin Pie


     Howdy! 
 
     A question is asked in the last digest about starchy beer, this time 
     caused by steeping oats in an extract boil.  If the beer tastes good 
     now, DRINK IT NOW, because the bacteria and wild yeast that are most 
     certainly in it will soon start to work their dark magic on the brew. 
 
     Brewer's yeast do not metabolize starch, but some yeasts and bacteria 
     can.  What you now have is a liquid with lots of food for unwanted 
     microbes, but none for brewer's yeast.  This means that the nasty bugs 
     have free run of the beer.  It will go bad relatively quickly, so 
     drink it now! 
 
     As an enlightening lesson, reserve a couple of bottles at room temp. 
     and try one in a month and the other a couple of months after that... 
 
     --------------------------- 
 
     There was a "LIQUID PUMPKIN PIE" recipe in the last HBD.  The 
     procedure called for topping off the fermenter by pouring cold water 
     through the pumpkin and grain that had been set aside. 
 
     DON'T DO THIS!  Unless you keep the grain and pumpkin at 160F for a 
     while to pasteurize it, you will be rinsing all sorts of unwanted 
     microbes into your fermenter!  Sparging warm grain with cold water 
     into the fermenter is just about the best way to guarantee an 
     infection. 
 
     You really should never be sparging grains into the fermenter.  You 
     should sparge into the boil kettle so that EVERYTHING gets boiled to 
     remove protein, sterilize the wort, etc. 
 
     Also, the "minimash" will probably not convert all the starch in the 
     pumpkin because one pound of pale ale malt in two gallons of water is 
     not going to provide the proper enzyme concentration for efficient 
     conversion.  The remaining starch will provide food for all the 
     microbes that were put into the wort during the cool-water sparge! 
 
     If you are truly and uniquely blessed by the Beer Deities, you might 
     not end up with infected beer, but why tempt fate? 
 
     Have fun!

I would include 2 word classics that any drinker must appreciate and 4 more 
"extreme" examples; I stay with European beers but I suppose they are available
somewhere in USA 
 
Two "Classics" 
1. Pilsener Urquell 
2. Chimay Blue 
 
Two "Extreme" 
3. Eku 28 (extra -strong, -malty, -sweet) 
4. Courage (of Grant?) Imp. Stout (extra -strong, -bitter) 
 
Two lighter but very characterful examples 
5. Celis White (Belgium or USA) 
6. Lindemans Peche-Lambic, or Boon's Kriek, or whatever you can find in USA 
 
You can have at 5. or 6. Rodenbach Grand Cru, Liefmans Goudenband or an hoppy 
IPA or even Schenkerla Rauchbier to show more styles,  but you should always 
include a low-alcohol example (lambic, Berliner Weisse) to show that even a 
not-so-strong beer can be amazingly rich and complex. 
You may try for 3. or 4. SA Triple Bock (but I never could taste it here in 
Italy: could someone email me a bottle?) or Guinness Extra Stout or even 
Guinness Foreign Stout if it's still available somewhere in the world (I tasted
it 18 years ago) or others. 
 
- ------------------------------------- 
And now one question: 
 
My beers are not usually lacking condition, the head may be good but it 
disappeares too quickly; I read many times that you can use small quantities of
wheat to improve head or head retention. 
First question, is that true? Any other tip on this subject? 
 
Second, which is the best way I can use wheat? 
I'm an extraxt brewer, not yet equipped for mashing; I use specialty grains 
steeped before boil. So I could use: 
 
1. Unmalted wheat grains 
2. Unmalted (home-)roasted (toasted,torrified..) wheat grains. 
3. Wheat malt 
4. Wheat cara- or roast- malt 
5. Wheat flakes 
 
I usually brew pale ales, strong ales and stouts. 
 
I guess 3) and maybe 1) would require mashing. 
1), 2) or 5) are more readily available to me, but 3) and 4) are also possible.

Subject: Fermentation temperature


Collective, 
 
Yesterday Lou Heavner wrote, in part:

I was just wondering about this. I'm fermenting an ale right now with Wyeast 
1056. The instructions on the yeast pack recommend fermenting at 68 degrees 
F and the air temp around the fermenter is a steady 68 throughout the day 
and night. The wort temperature, however, is between 70 and 75 degrees F 
today (second day of active fermentation). 
 
Would I get a better tasting beer by forcing the air temperature down or 
does Wyeast's 68 degree recommendation refer to the air temperature? 
 
I think I could force the air temperature to around 60 degrees F with my 
fermentation chiller. I'm not sure how much cooler that will make the wort. 
 
Thank you in advance for your wise replies.

Subject: The Un-Believer's Six-Pack Challenge Results


Muchisimas gracias to everyone who responded to the Un-Believer's Six-Pack 
Challenge!!  This really *was* fun.  I figured on getting a few responses but 
close to  two dozen folks responded either through the HBD or private e-mail. 
 
The tally represents responses as of Monday October 7th.  I suppose more 
might  trickle in but the trends seem to be well-established at this point, 
so I'm cutting it off  (hey, it's MY poll, dammit). 
 
I've taken some liberties with the raw data, since in many instances the nod 
went  more to style than brand, and I sorta lumped some of them together. 
 The votes have been carelessly tallied and the clear winners are: 
 
===== 
 
Specific Brand votes: 
 
*Pilsner Urquell with 16 votes 
*Guiness Stout with 14 votes 
*Sierra Nevada Pale Ale with 11 votes 
 
The next two are presented as "categories" rather than specific brands since 
so  many brands were mentioned.   know these two categories have a wide-open 
range  of  interpretations brand-to-brand but I just had to collapse them 
into groups (as you  will see in a second, there are 11 more that received at 
least two votes, and over  two dozen others with one vote each): 
 
*"Belgian or Lambic" with 12 votes 
        (Boon and Chimay tied for most popular with 3 votes each; Rodenbach 
was 
        mentioned twice) 
*Weissen-Class with 11 votes 
        (Spaten & Paulaner were tops with a couple votes for Red Hook) 
 
And finally, 
 
*Celis Wit wit 7 votes 
 
========== 
 
Also-Ran with Two or More Votes: 
 
Several "Bocks" with 6 total votes 
Bud / Bud Lite (5) -- more on this in a second... 
Oktoberfest (5 -- Paulaner got 2) 
Fruit/Spice Beer (5) 
Fuller's ESB (4) 
"Amber" Ale (3) 
Imperial Stout (3) 
Barleywine (3) 
Redhook ESB (3) 
Scottish Ale (3) 
Oatmeal Stout (2) 
 
BUD?!?!?!  Yes!  Bud.  The evil swill that started this whole affair!  Look 
- -- it gives a  rookie a starting-off point, and as one respondent pointed 
out, it'd also be a great  place to end up, to illustrate its blandness after 
touring the world a pint at a time. 
 
Another suggestion that made sense was to add somehting like a brown ale as 
an  illustration that "dark" doesn't necessarily mean "heavy". 
 
"Amber Ale" included both Fischer and US microbrew varieties. 
 
Perhaps surprisingly, Anchor Steam only rated one vote. 
 
I was a bit surprised by the high showing of the Belgian styles.  I 
personally believe  the untrained palate would have trouble with this style, 
although perhaps that's as  good an illustration as any, huh? 
 
BTW such a six-pack might make an excellent Christmas gift.  I have several 
friends  who enjoy my beer but really have no idea what's out there in the 
"real beer" world.   A guided tour, either on paper or in person, should 
accomany the beers to educate  and explain.   Dress up the six-pack carton 
with wrapping paper. 
 
FWIW I'll include "my" sixer.  I already had one sketched out before I asked 
the  question so any similarities to the "winners" is strictly coincidence! 
(yeah right): 
 
*Pilsner Urquell -- What the megabrews purport to be (not) 
*Guinness Pub Draft -- Smoother than the bottle; probably more palatable to 
the rookie 
*Sierra Nevada Pale Ale -- Crisp hop explosion; illustrates "American" 
microbrew style 
*Bass Ale (or Fuller's ESB or even Double Diamond) -- "Classic" English Ale 
*Oktoberfest (Hacker-Pschorr or Paulaner) -- Malty, not too bitter 
*Franziskaner Hefe-Weissen -- Something different 
 
The assumption of course is that "fresh" bottles can be found; all bets are 
off if the  beer is skunked or stale.  Best perhaps to buy a six of each, so 
you can be sure the  ones you give are worthy of their labels. 
 
Some people came up with "megabrew" six-packs -- Redhook, Sam Adams, Pete's 
- --  which is a good idea since it may be more of a "stepping stone" approach 
for the  uninitiated. 
 
As several folks pointed out, this really should be a "twelve-pack" to do the 
task  justice.  I agree, but I think the six-pack concept at least address 
the issue of beer  diversity.  It's not our place to force our tastes and 
opinions on others but at the  same time, I'm pleasantly surprised at how 
many people do take well to better beer if only given the opportunity. 
 
Now that I've done your Christmas shopping for you, let's get back to 
brewing.

Subject: tap for fridge


 
I currently keep my corney kegs in a "dorm size" refridgerator and have 
to open the door everytime I want to use the tap. 
I was wondering if anyone has ideas about where I could get a tower style 
tap to mount on the top of the fridge. What I have in mind is the same 
type that are seen at bars, sometimes brass with the handle on it. 
Any other ideas or suggestions are welcome. 
Thanx.

Subject: Sparging Comments Invited


        Reply to:   Sparging Comments Invited 
 
I use a 33 quart enamel pot with an EZ Masher (TM).  My grain load is usually 
about 10-12 lbs.  My sparge technique is: 
1) Mash out at 170F for about 15 minutes. 
2) Recirculate until clear (a couple of cups) 
3) Attach hose to ezm spout that goes to bottom of brewpot to avoid splashing 
and HSA. 
4) Open spigot, until I get just a trickle. 
5) Get a gallon of water boiling. 
6) Pour it slowly around top of grain (which already has 1-2" of liquid in it) 
7) Collect 7 gallons, usually taking  1 1/2 to 2 hours. 
 
Questions: 
A) Does pouring the water, as opposed to using a distribution device, create 
serious channeling? 
B) Is boiling water too hot? The grain stays 160-170F (I keep a thermometer in 
it.) 
C)  If I notice small bits of particulate matter in the initial runnings, 
should I start over? Will these "bits-o-grain" cause starch haze or what? 
D) Does that new Miller ad with the guy making fun of beer geeks make you all 
want to punch him in the nose or is it just me? 
E) Do most of you using enamel pots with EZ Masher (TM) insulate same? 
F) Is it possible to sparge too slowly? What would I gain by shortening the 
sparge time to 45min- 1 hour? 
 
 
TIA...Craig

Just one man's opinion, but I'd use the pellets for bittering and try to get 
some plugs or even fresh hops for dry hopping.  You're really after aroma at 
this stage, not bitterness.

Hombrew Collective, 
 
I just dry hopped my first batch. I put the pellet hopps in the secondary 
last night. This morning when I went to check on the brew, a question occured 
to me. Is all this stuff going to settle out in the next week (in time to 
bottle)? If not will I need to rack it again so to avoid getting pelletized 
hopps in my kegs? Thanks in advance.

Subject: all-grain migraines


I come seeking advice and counsel from this august forum. 
 
After seriously considering chucking all of my equipment, I reconsidered and I 
am now determined to overcome my brewing problems.  The problem I face is 
recurring infections (in my beer of course).  My last four batches have had 
some sort of infection or another, and I am getting a little frustrated. 
 
My latest was a test batch to try to determine the root cause of my problems. 
It was a simple pale ale.   The recipe was as follows: 
 
8# 2 row malt 
1# Crystal 
1# carapils 
 
Infusion mashed at 150F, held for 1 hour.  60 min boil.  Hops at 45, 15, and 
5.  Immersion chilled, racked to primary.  Pitched Wyeast American. 
Fermented 1 week at around 75f, racked to secondary, another week. 
Racked to corny, with 1/2 cup corn sugar to prime.  1 1/2 weeks tapped. 
 
Result:  Hazy amber color with slight sour taste, with mild carbonation. 
 
Based on past comments from the digest, I used spring water, did not use a 
starter, replaced my siphon hoses.  ( I did not eliminate my plastic 
fermenter).  Other data points.  I use a copper racking cane, soaked 
everything in idophor after cleaning. 
 
Results from previous three batches: 
ESB Clone - strong sherry flavors at bottling,  diminished in two months, 
consumed entire batch. 
Honey Wheat - slight sour taste, had several gushers.   Last few were trashed. 
Pale Ale - strong sour taste,  undrinkable, used it to water the lawn. 
 
These were all made using Briess 2 row malt. 
 
Any suggestions.

Subject: Which Malt to buy?


After spectating on the recent malt thread, I had a question regarding the 
best to buy.  I brew predominately pale ales, brown ales, and would like to 
try a porter and stout.  What would be the recommended base malt for these 
styles? (I would like to buy a 50/55lb bag).  In the past I have purchased 
Briess 2 row and used recipes that fit that style of malt. 
 
Thanks

Subject: Starch in oatmeal stout/whiskey/coffee/pumkin seeds


Anton asks about the starch in his 'extract' Oatmeal Stout- 
 
I too made an extract oatmeal stout about a year ago. The beer was (and still 
is) pretty good but there was always something about it that I couldn't quite 
pinpoint. Not until about a month ago, when I started to read a lot more about 
mashing, did I realize it was 'starchy'. Not bad, but 'flawed in some way.' 
 
I do not, however, remember there being a foam sitting on top of this batch. 
But this has happened on another batch I brewed.  That batch was the first and 
only time I brewed with Wyeast American II and Cara-Pils malt so I attributed 
it to either the yeast or the dextrins in the malt.  The foam just sat there 
like whipped cream on an Irish coffee so I just racked from under it and 
everything turned out excellent. 
 
Mark asks about whiskey in his beer- 
 
I would imagine that the reason they recommend whiskey in the airlock is so 
that if it happens to get into the beer, you don't have to worry about 
contamination.  So...don't worry about it. 
 
Cory asks a couple of questions- 
 
About coffee-  Steep coffee at the end of the boil, not with the grains before 
the boil.  Coffee shouldn't be boiled, it brings out the bitter tannins in the 
beans. 
 
About pumpkin beer-  Clean, salt, bake and eat the seeds, don't steep them to 
make pumpkin beer.  Follow the recipe in HBD 2219 for pumpkin ale, it looks 
terrific. 
 
Cheers, 
Paul
