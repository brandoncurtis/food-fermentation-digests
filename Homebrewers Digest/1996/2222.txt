Subject: Carbonating in cold storage


I am planning a full-grain Bohemian Pils as my first lager. This brew is 
ultimately destined to be packaged in minikegs, and I find myself 
intrigued by the idea of racking to the minikegs after primary 
fermentation and letting the secondary fermentation during lagering 
condition the beer. 
 
I'm wondering if its very difficult to get predicatable carbonation this 
way, and if enough CO2 will be produced during, say, 6 weeks of cold 
storage. I also wonder if this will prevent substances from dissipating 
which will cause off-flavors in the beer. On the other hand, it's my 
understanding is that this technique is sometimes used commercially and 
it sounds both feasible and elegant. 
 
Current intentions are to use the Wyeast "Czech Pils" strain and I am 
aiming for an OG of 1.048 to 1.050. Those two factors should have some 
relevance to the question. 
 
I'm sorry if the info I need is in the Noonan book because I don't have 
that one yet. There wasn't enough info in Dave Miller's Pilsner book to 
inspire confidence.

Hi All, 
 
 I'm a newbie to homebrewing, only one batch under my belt, and just 
attemped to brew my second batch (a honey porter).  Everything was going fine 
until just after I pitched the yeast (a starter made from wyeast).  I use 
a 5 gallon bucket as my fermenter, and when I went to close it up and 
attach the airlock, the little rubber o-ring (that the airlock fits into) 
popped out of the whole and into the brew.  I couldn't fish it out, and I 
didn't want to contaminate the brew, so I left it figuring it was 
sanitized so I should be o.k.  So what I did was trim down a rubber stopper 
with a whole in it (the one that I used on my starter bottle) and wedged 
it into the hole with the airlock attached.  I then relaxed, didn't worry 
and had a homebrew.  Now, three days later I'm not relaxed, starting to 
worry and am running out of homebrew.  There is still no visible sign 
of fermentation in the airlock.  I suppose that means the rubber stopper 
I put on may not have been air tight!  Is there anything I can do at this 
point, to save my batch?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Subject: Bergamot


Daniel Goodale asked for information about oil of bergamot. Kelly Jones' reply 
suggested using bee-balm or the oil extracted from it. If a remember correctly 
(I am at work and my reference books are at home) the oil from this herb is 
indeed the same as that used in Earl Grey tea BUT is not the source of the 
flavouring used by the tea companies. 
 
Earl Grey tea is flavoured with oil extracted from the skin of the unripe fruit
of the bergamot orange. So it might be worthwhile trying to get hold of some 
dried bergamot orange skin and adding this to the boil or secondary. 
 
Mind you bee-balm would probably be OK and may be easier to get hold of.

Many thanks to Mike Beck for reporting his "Sorghum Beer 
Challenge" results in HBD #2221. It's good to see folks taking an 
interest in indigenous brewing and expanding their horizons a 
bit. 
 
Those who live in and around the Washington, DC area may be 
interested in a special "African Beer Festival" to be held at the 
Brickskeller Restaurant on Nov 19-21. The program will feature 
clear beers from the BB Brewery in Lome, Togo (brewers of Ngoma 
Beer) as well as the "first sorghum beer in America" (well, at 
least the first sorghum beer to be presented at a commercial 
tasting :-)). There will also be African food, music, and dance. 
Wendy and I plan to attend on Thursday, Nov 21, so if anyone on 
the list would like to get together with us and talk about "beer 
adventuring", we'd very much enjoy meeting you. Just reply 
privately to ridgely`at`burp.org.

Actually, I was the guy George was talking about. The yeast was cultured from 
the dregs a bottle of of Cooper's Sparkling Ale. The first time I used it, I 
tried to duplicate the spec of the Cooper's Ale, as recieved from Michael 
Jackson. They seemed to be a little off (off the the top of my head, they 
were about 1.045 starting gravity, and 5.7% alcohol, which would mean a final 
gravity of about 1.001!) The yeast had to be roused a couple of times when 
the temperature was in the low seventies, but the beer tasted great. 
 
Second, I used it for a bitter, during the summer, and the temperature got 
into the mid-80's. It performed beautifully at those temperatures, with nice 
fruity flavors, and no real off flavors that I could detect. I don't think 
I'd call it phenolic. 
 
I am currently making another batch of Adelaide-style sparkling ale. I upped 
the original gravity to the high 1.050's (I think Jackson's gravity reading 
was before the addition of sugar, which makes up about 18% of the grist). The 
fermentation was originally in the mid 60's, but went only to about 50% 
attentuation before conking out. Several attempts to rouse the yeast failed, 
until I moved it to a warmer room, in the mid 70's. Then the yeast fermented 
out fine, finishing at about 80% attentuation at this time. I racked them 
into kegs this weekend, and will see how they do latter. 
 
I've also noticed that the yeast in the bottles that I bottle conditioned 
with this yeast, in the first batch, settled out very well; the beer is very 
clear. That may be why the yeast conks out early; it flocculates very well. 
This is odd, because I always have trouble pouring a glass of the real 
Cooper's Sparkling Ale without shaking up the yeast! 
 
Thanks

Bergamot oil is readily available in 15 ml bottles in heath food stores, 
probably for less than $10.  I mail order scents (for soap making; a great 
soap scent is oils of bergamot, rosemary, lavender and sandlewood at 
2:2:2:1.) from LorAnn Oils.  I have only the wholesale price list in reach 
right now.  One ounce of bergamot oil wholesales for $12; one ounce of 
artificial bergamot oil is only $2 (can you say "linalyl acetate?").  I 
think retail is about 25% higher.  They are at 1-888-456-7266.

I am afraid I can't point to a source in Colorado but I found one last 
night in Dallas.  I had a draft Pilsner Uruquell at the Flying Saucer 
(no connection) in Dallas and it was great.  The last Pilsner Uruquell I 
had from a bottle was not good and I had about decided I no longer liked the 
beer but that draft last night changed my mind.  I am still leery of the 
bottled PU but look forward to going back for more draft.

Subject: Tea vs. beer


 
 
Daniel Goodale asked recently about tea (Earl Grey) in a beer recipe. The 
Belgian brewery Lindemans uses tea in one of its beers, appropriately named 
Tea-bier. The label doesn't declare what tea is used or in what quantities, 
though. 
 
Today I brewed an experimental (non-grain)  tea beer. The ingredients are: 
apple juice (5 liters), green tea (5 liters), sugar (1,3 kilograms), 
crushed ginger root (2 grams) and yeast (Den Arsegan). In my calculations 
this should produce a drink of about 5% alcohol. In taste it won't be too 
complex, I think. Any input on improvements is welcome. 
 
Thanks in advance,

Subject: Gambrinus "Pale Ale" malt:


 Al K asks about Gambrinus malts. 
 
 Gambrinus makes two types of "Pale" malt:  One they call "Pale Malt" 
and the other they call ESB malt.  ESB malt was developed by a request from 
smaller brewers (micros) that Gambrinus make a UK ale malt substitute. 
 
 I don't have a spec. sheet from Gambrinus on the ESB malt, but have 
brewed a beer made with 100% of ESB malt, and modest hopping to highlight this 
malt.  OG was 1.050.  The resulting beer was quite good, with a residual 
sweetness and a slight breadiness in the flavour.  The colour was typical of 
a pale ale, a little darker than red hook.  Haze was very minimal, (at 6 C) 
after cold conditioning.  I think the colour was a little higher than most 
UK malts would deliver.

Jeff described his SNPA yeast starter:

I find this to be typical of starters, even from Wyeast packets.  People 
are used to a big head and a lot of activity in the carboy, but I find 
 it is hard to even detect bubbles in the first starter.  When you swirled 
and made a head, this is evidence that fermentation happend.  The 
wort was saturated with CO2, and swirling it made the bubbles form. 
So the yeast must have been working to create that CO2. 
 
I would encourage everyone to make a starter with their yeast.  And 
ideally, you should pitch that starter into a bigger starter.  For 
example, first put a cup of wort in a beer bottle and let that get 
started.  Then pitch that into two cups of wort in a champagne 
bottle or erlenmeyer flask to build up more yeast.  Especially with a 
strong beer or lager.   It is almost impossible to get too much yeast 
this way.

Well, that wouldn't be an infusion mash.  In an "infusion mash", you 
add hot water to cold grains such that the result is the temperature you 
need and you mash at that one temperature.  This is the easiest way to 
mash and works great for things like pale ales.  And it is almost the only 
way to mash if you are using a cooler as a mash tun--it wouldn't work 
to put the cooler on top of a burner. 
 
You can certainly dough in at a cooler temperature and then raise the 
whole mash temperture together.  In fact, some people recommend you 
dough in at around 40C and then raise the temp to sacchrification 
range. 
 
Once you get some experience mashing, there are plenty of variables 
to play with!

I went to Celis' page and read up on the hops for Celis white at: 
(I was happy to see cascades...) 
 
http://www.celis.com/beer/beer.html 
 
I like cascades and figured using them and centennial would compliment 
the curacao citrusness.  I picked Saaz for flavor/aroma since the style 
chart in NCJHB say 'nobel type' for hop flavor/aroma. 
 
I am undecided if I should just buy the Wyeast Belgian White, or 
if I should culture it from Hoegarrden...

Subject: yeast starters


Jeff described his SNPA yeast starter:

>began bubbling.  I then shook the starter and it formed a thick head and 
>the airlock began blooping so rapidly that the water shot out the top of 
>the airlock. 
 
I find this to be typical of starters, even from Wyeast packets.  People 
are used to a big head and a lot of activity in the carboy, but I find 
 it is hard to even detect bubbles in the first starter.  When you swirled 
and made a head, this is evidence that fermentation happend.  The 
wort was saturated with CO2, and swirling it made the bubbles form. 
So the yeast must have been working to create that CO2. 
 
I would encourage everyone to make a starter with their yeast.  And 
ideally, you should pitch that starter into a bigger starter.  For 
example, first put a cup of wort in a beer bottle and let that get 
started.  Then pitch that into two cups of wort in a champagne 
bottle or erlenmeyer flask to build up more yeast.  Especially with a 
strong beer or lager.   It is almost impossible to get too much yeast 
this way.

My brother called me this morning and told me that last night he saw an 
advertisement for Dateline NBC (the news program).  One of the taglines was 
something to the effect "Before you drink home brew, you had better watch 
Dateline" or some such warning.  My brother didn't know what day the ad was 
for but he said that Dateline is on 3 or 4 times a week.  Has anyone else 
seen this ad?  If anyone happens to find out when that program airs please 
let me know, or for that matter just post it as I'm sure most subscribers 
would be interested.

Another question: 
 
Which is better to use for my wit? 
 
Flaked Wheat, Bulgar Wheat or Raw Unmalted Wheat? 
 
Since the flaked wheat is pregelatinized would this result in a 
clear wit? 
 
If I use Bulgar wheat what preparations are needed? How 'bout Raw?

The biggest difference between American and Canadian brewpubs that I found is 
that Canadians aren't afraid of brewing Lagers! All of the brewpubs I visited 
had their own lagers! I haven't been to an american brewpub yet that served a 
lager! (Much apologies to those who do that I haven't visited. Feel free to 
flame me with your locations and beer menu's. I'll do my best to stop by and 
raise a pint to blow suds in your eye! ; ). My noteworthy stops in Toronto 
included Al Frisco's, The Granite, and C'est What. Or.. Al Forget it next 
time's, "Next to God is Granite" and C'est la vie (Trans. Oh well, whatever) 
 
Good stuff first, moaning later...The Granite!! 
 WOW What a pub!  Take me back to England and batter me like a haddock! They 
had 5 of their beers on tap. 
Top of the list is their Special (Dry-Hopped) Best Bitter! Fuggles and ahem 
Cascade hops. Canadian 2-Row, imported carastan and black malts, OG 1046. 
Wonderful aroma more of Cascade than Fuggles. Fresh full-bodied feel, with 
the real zip of an english bitter! Best in House, and Best of Trip IMHO. 
Their Best Bitter was also very good. Only lacking the freshness of aroma and 
body that only dry hopping can add. 
Peculiar Strong Ale was anything but peculiar. This strong english ale 
nicknamed "Lunatic Broth" is wonderful. Rich in color, slight in nose and 
mildly sweet to finish. I liked it-a lot! If you make it their and their out 
of Special Best Bitter, skip the best bitter and start here. Yum! (OG 1056, 
abv 5.6%) 
Summer Ale, something for the american tourists, cask conditioned, cascade 
and goldings. Canadian 2-row, Wheat, and Carastan malts. Probably Canada's 
best imitation american brew. 
Ringwood Ale is a new brew for them, a blonde ale. No complaints here, just 
proof that they DO know how to make good light ales. Substitute torrefield 
wheat and drop the carastan from the Summer Ale and their you have it. A much 
better beer, no harsh dry aftertaste. A light bouquet with good balance. 
 
Al Frisco's brewresteraunt I'll call it. Had an impressive list of beers, had 
better than a half dozen wonderful english hand pumps, and only 2 of their 
own beers on tap! Bummer!!!  The restaurant was downstairs with a bar 
upstairs. Dining was semi-formal, Excellent menu, great appetizers. Awesome 
food, but small in portions. We got there about 7:45 and the wait was long 
for food, so they offered to serve us the same menu if we were willing to eat 
up in the bar area. Not a problem. On tap was a Continental Lager and a Honey 
Wheat. Promised but not delivered were 5 or so others including a Nut Brown I 
was anxious to try.  The lager had an impressive head with good staying power 
was a nice dark golden in color. A good Lager. Lager Lager Lager!!! Wheat 
beers have never been my forte, but I had 2 of each (20oz'ers) so something 
was going right! Extra light in color. Nice beer. Over all the bar makes a 
better dance club than a brew pub if all they carry is 2 beers. By 9:30 the 
place was packed and by 10:00 people were setting their drinks on our table. 
I was ready to move on, but the ladies wanted to stay and dance. Good 
ambiance, ok beers, bad selection. 
 
C'est What, had a better selection of beers I was too tanked to try to review 
them. My impression was a corporate grind em up crank them out enterprise 
lacking any real substance. But that's probably not fair, it was late, my 
palate was shot before we staggered in. I'd try the place again just out of 
fairness. 
 
These are just my humble ramblings, I have no association with any of the 
establishments yada yada yada all opinions are my own and the result of 4 
years of homebrewing, and a passion for making and drinking good beer. I'm 
not a judge and don't claim to be an expert. I just love good beer!

I've had them infected before, also, but let the starter go a few days 
just to make certain.  I don't know if it's the nutrient, a fermentation 
by-product of some of yeasts, or simply that fact that certain strains 
of yeast taste foul in their own right, but I've actually made starters 
with wyeast that I was thought was infected when I opened it, and the 
starter (and the beer) turned out ok!  Not all of them turned have 
"recovered" for me, though, and I'm not one to pitch the starter if I 
have the slightest doubt. 
 
One consistent observation is that if the package swelled completely 
in 2 days or less, it was always good.

Subject: Raw wheat/rice hulls&oat hulls/Why Wy1056 ?


 
Mark Thompson writes about using wheat flour as a cheap raw wheat 
adjunct substitute ... 
 
>[...]  Then i brought the

>procedure known as double mashing. 
 
The point of boiling an adjunct is to gelatinize the small starch 
granules.  In flour the granules have already been mechanically 
degraded.  Grits do not have the starch granules crushed.  This boil 
is pointless except for it's decoction-like effects on the mash.

If you live in a place where wheat is grown, you may be able to find 
raw wheat grain even cheaper.  Market price on wheat is currently 
around $4.00 per bushel which is under 9 cents per pound.

Andy Walsh asks about rice hulls ... 
 
>What's the deal with rice hulls? I want to make a 100% wheat beer. What 
>proportion of rice hulls do I need? Should they be added to the mash or just 
>the lauter? 
 
As you can probably guess, rice hulls are added as a mechanical aid to 
lautering and are particularly useful when mashing beers with a high 
proportion of 'sticky' grains such as wheat and rye.  Rice hulls are 
very high in silicates according to M&B Sci.  Silicates in beer can 
lead to harsh flavors.  For this reason I've been using rice hulls 
sparingly and only adding them at mashout in my combined mash/lauter 
tun. 
 
Zymurgy and Brewing Techniques have both had articles in the use of 
rice hulls in 100% wheat malt beers in the recent past.  My 
recolloction is that a 1 gallon volume of rice hulls (3.8liter) was 
advocated for a 5 gallon (19liter) beer batch.  Personally I'd start 
with half as much rice hulls. 
 
I see that William's Brewing [ (800)-759-6025, I've no affiliation ] 
sells 'Natural Filter Medium, #M72' which is "washed oat hulls" for 
$1.60 per pound.  They advocate around 7% by weight in 90+% malted 
wheat grist.  They also advocate adding the hulls "before striking". 
My advice is to add them as close to lautering as practical. 
 
I have no idea what the properties of oat hulls are.  If anyone can 
shed any light on oat hulls phenolics, silicates etc, I'd be 
interested. 
 
- ------------------------------- 
 
After seeing 3 queries in the last HBD regarding Wyeast Wy1056, let me 
add my question.  Why is this yeast so popular ? 
 
The descriptive terms for this yeast are soft, smooth, clean, neutral. 
So why is a soft, bland and nearly flavorless yeast also apparently 
the most popular HB yeast for hoppy ales when alternative yeasts with 
wonderful character like Wy1028, Wy1098, Wy1968 and others are equally 
available ? 
 
Microbreweries are pretty much stuck with a single ale yeast to cover 
a wide variety of beers and so may need a yeast with neutral flavors. 
They also have to appeal to an 'average' consumer.  HBers' don't have 
these limitations, so why would we (make that you) have a strong 
preference for such a bland yeast ?
