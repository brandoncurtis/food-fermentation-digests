Subject: Have Homebrew, Can't Travel?


Question to any of you legal folk, 
 
On page 204 of Marty Nachel's "Beer Across America" under homebrewing, Marty 
states that  "...homebrewers are required to follow three simple rules:". 
Rule #2 states that "The homebrewed beer is not to leave the brewery (the 
home) for any purpose other than competitions." (P.204 Nachel) 
 
I have never heard of this part of the law. Has this ever been enforced? In 
addition, what constitutes a "competition"? Does anyone out there have an 
authentic copy of the law states verbatim? I'd hate to end up in court for 
simply transporting some tasty malted beverage over to a friend's house. 
 
All apologies if this has been covered before. But I have seen no mention of 
this over the past year or so. 
 
Thanks, 
 
Chris

Subject: Sour beer in Guiness-advice


I have a unique opportunity: I made a Toad-Spit Stout from the NCJHB, with 
slightly more American hops.  I had about a quart that would not fit in the 
carboy, and I put it in another bottle.  Well, the airlock didn't seat well 
and I have a quart of sour beer (with moldy scum on top, but that's not 
important).  I am thinking of adding *3% sour beer* as Guiness is rumored to 
do.  Of course I will boil it well to sanitize it.  Any advice here?  Has 
anyone done it, and what did you learn? 
 
Thanks,

And this is yet another reason to use 1056, umleff my foot'f im my mouff, 
Big Foot is made with 1056. I use it for all pales, porters and ipa's. 
It gives a nice skimmable krausen to propagate to the next batch and 
ferments down to 58F.  I made a recent Ale Marzen with 1056 (don't flame, 
me it was for my wedding and I didn't have time to lager) that came out real 
nice. It fermented and cleared in seven days and went into a cold box at 
32F for a month. I had some last night and the malt shines like a beacon 
in night. Thanks 1056! (And Kenny Schwartz for the back and forth email 
on the subject). I can't personally give all 1,056 reasons, but by 
the time this thread is dead (thread's dead baby, thread's dead), i'm 
sure we'll hear 'em all.

Any time you do something like this on a whim, do it on a small scale! Don't 
risk your entire batch. Try it one gallon and see how it turns out. I do 
this for maple beers, fruit beer or anything other beer where it is cost 
prohibitive to do a full 5g, or in your case, just trying something 
interesting.
Enjoy and if it turns out good, hope you kept good notes...

Subject: OG of Malt


Downloaded a program off web called SUDS.  Has in it a place where you can 
formulate your own recipes.  The malts that are already listed have OG of 
the malts or extracts.  Question; if I was to add my own malts etc where 
would I find a list of OG of Malts.  This program calculates all OG of malts 
and sugars and when the recipe is complete it gives you the OG of your 
recipe.  So if anyone has a list or a way that I could find OG of malts I 
would appreciate it.

Excerpt from "Hop Variety Characteristics", HopUnion, USA, 1995, Page 
1: "Leaf hops are the natural hop cones that have been dried and 
baled". 
 
I'm not looking any more up, 'cause this is silly.  Next you'll be 
telling us that "Barley wines aren't really wines at all", or, "Dry 
hopping isn't really dry!"  Even so, I suspect most of us will 
continue to use these terms, because we know what they mean. 
 
But, do you wanna hear MY pet peeve? People who think the term "malt" is 
a synonym for "malt extract", thus forcing silly questions like "Oh, 
do you mean GRAIN malt?" 
 
Bergamot in Earl Grey:  OKOKOK, I give! It's not the herb, it's 
the citrus extract!  But you could have fooled me, I have some 
bergamot (bee-balm) in my herb garden, and the smell is a dead ringer 
for the tea.  And is probably easier to grow than the tree, to boot.

Subject: Rims Musings Part One


(I've divided this up into two article so as to save from spamming 
everyone with one lengthy post) 
 
Part One - Heating Elements, Coils, and Tuns, Oh My! 
 
While wandering to the plumbing section of a chain home improvement store 
that will remain nameless, I passed through the water heater section. I 
happened to spy two different heater elements. One at 1440 watts and another 
at 2000+ watts. I was wondering if anyone could provide me with info on how 
long each of these takes to heat ~8 gallons of water to ~180d F? 
 
Also, I've been musing on this for a few weeks now following some posts a 
couple of weeks ago about circulating heated water through a copper coil 
in the mash to control the temp and think that this is the way I'm gonna 
go with it. I like this idea, a lot. It seems to solve the potential 
problems of HSA, scorched wort, etc, rather nicely. 
 
As for my mash/lauter tun and sparge tank, I think I'm going to use those 
8.5 gal enamel pots. I don't foresee going over 5 gal batches in the 
future. With 'em I can easily install copper piping in the sparge tank for 
in and out, as well as putting an EM on the mash/lauter tun without a 
great deal of hassle or outlay of cash to a welder. 
 
If you've any input on this, feel free to email me, but I do read the HDB 
regularly, too. 
 
(In part II ask lots of questions about computerized controlling, skip if 
you're not interested)

Part Two - Gizmos 'R' Us 
 
Ok, now onto the techie stuff. 
 
First, I was wondering about thermometers. What does a good one run? Which 
are the 'good' ones? Which should I avoid? Oh, and I'm refering to 
thermometers that can be used to electronically monitor the temp of the 
mash. What I'm envisioning doing is using several of them in various places 
around the mash tun to produce a "mean" tempature for the mash as well as 
possibly some other cool things(see below). And, of course, to monitor the 
sparge tank temp(I figure one should be enough for that purpose). 
 
Next, does anyone have any recommendations for ISA cards that can handle a 
bunch of inputs? Also, are there any ISA cards that can handle both input 
and output? If so, what are the better ones? 
 
Now on to the "cool things". :> I've got an old 386SX sitting around 
gathering dust in my closet that I figured I could use as a controller. 
Now one of the things I had thought of doing with it was to use it to 
give an as accurate as possible mean temp using all kinds of nifty 
formulae(I'm an EE/CS major w/ a minor in math, formulas are cool to me, 
go fig :). Another idea I had was to use the various temp inputs to 
allow the program to 'learn' how each batch heats, so that it can 
predict how much heat to apply when and for how long. I know that this 
might be stretching things a little, but if I can figure, roughly, how much 
heat I loose in x amount of time, it just might work. 
 
Also, if anyone can point me in the direction of valves usable in brewing 
that are electric, it would go a long way too. :> 
 
What I am trying for here, is to reduce my brewing to adding the grains, 
striking, running a program, and mostly forgetting about it until it's time 
to boil. The biggest hurdle to reaching this point, that I can see, would 
be electrically controled valves that are affordable and/or reliable not 
only in use, but in not sucking oxygen into the system on the wort side. 
With a handful of those I can control everything from sparging to 
recirculation to filling the kettle. Instead of winding up with a tiered 
system, I could have it all on one level by using the pump to transfer 
everything. 
 
To conclude, I've got all kinds of nifty things I'd like to try with a 
system like this, but these are(mostly) the main hurdles I face to get 
to the point where I can start experimenting. 
 
As with the last message, email response are welcome, but I also read the HBD 
on a regular basis.

Subject: Copy of: Cooper's Yeast & Trub


I have read the thread on Coopers yeast with interest. I have used this yeast 
successfully in the past and I recently posted the following message to UK 
Homebrew: 
 
Martin Cross reports the formation of a thin pancake-like yeast crop when using
Cooper's yeast 
from a kit. I have experienced the same problem when using the yeast from 
bottles of Sparkling Ale. 
 
Conn Copas believes that this is a reaction between the yeast and trub. I am 
sure that this is right. 
I found that if I skimmed the pancake head as soon as it formed (sometimes this
had to be done twice) a 
more normal looking yeast crop appeared in replacement. Sometimes careful 
removal of the offending 
layer by getting it to stick to the back of a spoon revealed a normal looking 
yeast crop underneath. I usually 
found Coopers yeast to do a good job and it is certainly worth trying. 
 
One thing intrigues me about it though: in  bottles of Sparkling Ale the yeast 
doesn't settle at all well and the 
ale certainly isn't sparkling unless you have the patience of Job but in my 
homebrew it settles out like a good 'un. 
Can anyone explain? 
 
MICHAEL NEWMAN, Warminster, Wiltshire, UK 
 
Coopers yeast also seems to be very sensitive to changes in temperature in the 
18-21C range. If fermentation is sluggish try raising the temperature a little.

something to the effect "Before you drink home brew, you had better watch

for but he said that Dateline is on 3 or 4 times a week.  Has anyone else seen 
this ad?  If anyone happens to find out when that program airs please let me

I response to the above question, I believe the mentioned program is on this

 Most of the time any temperature measurements are converted to an analog 
voltage and sampled by a A/D converter.  (Just ignore any terms you don't 
understand.)  Which means you have to have an expensive data acquisition 
board to read it.  I've seen serial port interfaces for just about 
everything except thermocouples, but I haven't really looked.  For 
reference, a tilt sensor (more complex than temp sensor) with a serial 
interface is about $100.  The most obvious temperature sensor people are 
OMEGA at (800) 826-6342.  I'll send you more companies/phone numbers via 
private EMail.

Yes, he did. 
 
Any light from the middle of the visible spectrum (mid-green) on up through 
the ultraviolet range will produce the skunking effect. Brighter light 
produces it quicker, fluorescents faster than incandescents, and direct 
sunlight most rapidly of all. But unless you're using nothing but red 
light (like in a photgrapher's darkroom), the light will eventually 
cause the skunking reaction.

Copper is a micro nutrient for yeast (not sure off hand what it does but 
can look it up if anyone is interested. If a brewery is not using copper 
(ie. those w/ steel kettles but copper clad for looks) They either have 
a piece of copper at the bottom or along the way before the wort cools.

I purchased a water filter (from the Filter Store... Boy did I get ripped 
off, paid $79 for a friggin' $19 water filter... Live and Learn friends, 
Live and Learn...) two years ago with a variety of filter cartridges (you 
can get the filter cartridges at any big hardware chain for about $2 a 
piece, This beats the hell out of paying $39 from the Filter Store). All in 
all I found that the filter worked very well with the .5 micron cartridge 
on very light color and lightly hopped beers. I also noticed a big loss in 
hop flavor and overall body in my brews, but as they said, the beer was 
crystal clear without any sign of sediment! 
 
I then moved up to a 5 micron filter and got most of my taste and body back 
from what was I believe removed with the .5 micron filter. I have never 
really had a problem with chill haze, all I wanted to do was get rid of 
sediment in  my bottles because at about the same time I purchased a 
Melvico Counter Pressure Bottler (This thing is amazing, a good quality 
piece of equipment) and was experimenting with counter pressure bottling 
and thought it would be great to get absolutely no sediment. 
 
Anywho, two years later I almost never use the filter and have moved on to 
other methods of getting rid of any bottle residue. 
 
I cleaned the filter by backwashing it between two kegs with a bleach and 
water solution. This works very well to removed any residue on or in the 
filter. I also would always backwash the filter before I would filter the 
next batch to assure cleanliness. I always have stored my filters dry but 
have friends that store them in the filter in a Co2/water  environment. 
 
I also found that I lost some carbonation when I ran carbonated beer 
through the filter. 
 
Before filtering I would get the beer down to about 29 F and transfer it 
through the filter at about 32 psi. This worked very well for me, who knows 
for you. 
 
There's my two cents...

Hey everybody in brewland, 
 
  I've been following a recent thread about finding a temp sensor 
that can be read through the computer.  I don't know if this is exactly 
what you need, but it will work with a little mickey mousing.  Analog 
Devices, Inc.  makes a part #  TMP04.  It is a temperature sensor.  It 
works over the range of -40C to +150C.  The cost is under five dollars.  It 
delivers the temperature as an output pulse logic high, then logic low (5v 
and 0v respectively).  The temperature can be decoded by the ratio of the 
time it remains high vs. the time it remains low.  I'm sure with a little 
programming, this would fit the bill.  The only drawback, is that it isn't 
self contained (i.e. you would have to put some wort proof insulation 
around it (i.e. plastic bag) or something to prevent the contacts from 
getting wet. 
 To take a closer look at it, visit the web site `at` 
http://www.analog.com 
 
 I can't make the standard disclaimer, because I work here, and that is 
the only way I know the stuff exists.

Brian Kuhl asked about excellent and/or style defining IPA's. My vote(s) would 
go to Bagwhan's Best from Bigtime Brewing out in Seattle, this beer blew 
me away when I was out there in Fall of 95. Nothing even came close until a 
few months ago when I went up to Victory Brewing in Downington, PA and had 
their Hopdevil. Unfortunately, neither of these beers have a wide distribution 
(Victory does bottle and sell locally).  Tupper's Hoppocket is a distant third 
to these (which is more a complement to the first two than a criticism of 
Hoppocket) and is available in most mid-atlantic states. Just my 2 cents.

My brother called me this morning and told me that last night he saw an 
advertisement for Dateline NBC (the news program).  One of the taglines was 
something to the effect "Before you drink home brew, you had better watch 
Dateline" or some such warning.  My brother didn't know what day the ad was 
for but he said that Dateline is on 3 or 4 times a week.  Has anyone else 
seen this ad?  If anyone happens to find out when that program airs please 
let me know, or for that matter just post it as I'm sure most subscribers 
would be interested.

I too saw that tag line for a beer story on Dateline. The add that I saw said 
that it would air on Sunday, October 13. 
 
My understanding of the add was that it was a story about micro brewed beer 
and that all micro beer may not be brewed by micros. ie: the megga breweries 
are making micro brews (or something that resembles them) and marketing them 
with no affiliation to their name. 
 
Up here in Canada, Molsons Brewery is making Rickards Red and there is no 
indication on the bottle anywhere that it is made by Molsons. It appears to 
be micro brewed. 
 
I guess we're finally starting to make an impact on the mega-brewers.

I was one of the three posters, so here's my answer: 
I'm using 1056 with the Holiday Cheer recipe from New Complete Joy of 
Homebrewing. It's brewed with ginger, cinnamon and orange peels, and I 
wanted those flavors to come through. My research suggested that the Wyeast 
1084 - Irish Ale yeast - would have been an excellent choice for this beer. 
However, I've never brewed with spices before and by choosing a "bland" 
yeast I think I'll learn more about the effect of the spices.

Subject: Brewing chicha


 
Though it seems as if the current indigenous beer of choice is 
African opaque, or sorghum, beer, I recently did something similar 
that might also be of interest. 
 
Bill Ridgely posted to the HBD about two years ago (?) regarding 
another one of his beery adventures:  Chicha (corn beer).  Chicha is 
made in South and, to a lesser extent, Central America.  Unlike 
African opaque beer, it is not brewed commercially, but instead 
is made and served in what sound to me like wee tiny brewpubs. 
An abbreviated version is also made in people's kitchens.  Chicha is 
consumed whilst still fermenting and so is low in alcohol.  It is 
often spiced and may also be served with fruit. 
 
With Bill's help and a little patience, a friend and I recently 
completed a batch.  This was a very interesting and satisfying 
endeavour which included growing and malting the corn used. 
Every step of the process was very simple, and I highly recommend 
attempting this at home.  My second crop of corn is about to come in 
and the results were good enough that I will be doing this again in 
the near future. 
 
To give you an idea of what we did, our recipe is as follows.  For 
1.5 gallons: 
 
   1.5 lbs jora (malted corn) 
   1 lb  piloncillo (akin to brown sugar) 
   Spices 
   Mash for 90 minutes at 160F 
   Nottingham dry yeast 
   OG ~1.055 
   FG  1.012 
 
We did two 1.5 gallon batches, each spiced differently (one with 
curacao/coriander, the other with allspice/cinammon).  We would 
rather have used a higher proportion of jora, but on brewday we 
discovered that our ability to determine the weight of things is 
seriously imparied.  Instead of the 4.5lbs we thought we had, we 
found we had only 3lbs of jora. 
 
Rather than readjust (the OG would have been more appropriate at 
~1.045 in any case), we added more sugar, a course of action that 
was inspired by homebrewed Weizen as much as anything else. 
 
The result is a very tasty beverage, pretty big all the way around 
on corn, and yet the flavor is quite subtle.  Be warned that chicha 
is at its peak 2 to 4 days after pitching while it still retains 
some sweetness and body.  Once the chicha ferments out, you are 
left with a fairly bland beverage that reminds me of iced tea more 
than anything else.  If I'd been thinking (chicha lends itself 
to gulping), I would have kegged the stuff on the third day after 
pitching and stuck it in the fridge. 
 
While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, I see no 
reason why one could not start with good ol' yellow corn from the 
grocery store (domestic 20-row?)  In fact, I plan on doing this if 
only to see what kind of chicha it makes.

If mash Ph is nicely balanced somewhere between 5.0 and 5.5 must the sparge 
water Ph be adjusted from the nutural 7.0?  Should sparge water Ph be as 
low as the Ph of the mash?  Thanks for your time and comments.

Dave Brockington wrote an article about American IPAs in the 
latest Brewing Techniques.  If you're talking about currently 
available brews, are there any English IPAs?  If so, do they have near 
the bitterness of current American IPAs? 
 
Dave reviews three pioneering "IPAs".  Anchor's Liberty Ale was 
the first one, but he says most people don't consider it an IPA.  Not 
enough alcohol nor enough bitterness.  Grant's IPA was produced 
as a historical IPA, but it didn't influence much of the industry. 
Finally, SN Celebration Ale is a great hoppy beer, but Dave says it 
has too much crystal malt flavor for an IPA. 
 
A case could be made that Grant's DEFINEs the style, especially 
without an alternative.  Does anyone want to nominate another 
beer?

Hard to believe but Bass Ale is an 'IPA'.
