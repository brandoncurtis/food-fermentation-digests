Is anyone familiar with the Blue Moon Brewing Co.?? 
They have a wonderful Belgian White, with just a hint 
of coriander. My question is this though: 
Is it the oats in that beer that give it it's crisp 
taste?? 
 
I have just started brewing with a small kit, and have had 
a couple of successes in my few "first attempts"! 
I am picking up tips from this list.

     Hello! 
 
     John Varady says that Bass is an IPA.  This is what the label says, 
     but they, like many American brewers, seem to label beer however they 
     want, with no regard for traditional style guidelines! 
 
     Let your palate be the judge.  Bass is NOT an IPA, no matter what they 
     try to tell you on the label! (Neither is Oregon IPA an IPA, nor is 
     BBC's Cranberry Lambic even remotely related to lambic, nor do they 
     appear to use a true Bavarian Weizen yeast strain in their dark wheat, 
     etc.) 
 
     -------------------------------- 
 
     About sparge water pH adjustment:  sometimes I remember to acidify the 
     sparge water to around 6.0, sometimes I don't.  I haven't really 
     noticed a difference in the beer either way.  I think it's probably 
     more of a problem if you over sparge the grains without acidifying the 
     water.  In that case, you risk leaching tannins from the grains as the 
     grain bed's pH rises. 
 
     Simple answer: don't over sparge, and you won't need to acidify your 
     sparge water! 
 
     Have fun!

Subject: RE: Brewing Chicha


In HBD #2224, Scott Kaczorowski posts about his chicha brewing 
experiments. It's good to hear that all of Scott's work has not 
been in vain. He and I have been communicating via private e-mail 
for some time, and I've been fascinated with his efforts to grow, 
malt, and brew with his own native corn. 
 
I highly recommend a visit to his website. Lots of good info and 
photos! 
 
On the subject of using generic "store-bought" yellow corn, Scott 
writes: 
 
        >While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, I

        >In fact, I plan on doing this if only to see what kind

Wendy and I tried this when we first started brewing chicha, 
using dried yellow corn that was being sold as horse-feed. I 
can't say we were terribly happy with the results. Germination 
was spotty, and the resulting jora (malted corn) had a good bit 
of that "dirty dishrag" character we mentioned in our Zymurgy 
article. I think using a true "seed-grade" corn would be 
preferable if one could locate a stock which hasn't been treated 
with a fungicide (not uncommon with commercial seed). 
 
I'd love to try some of Scott's chicha, especially if he plans to 
try his hand at frutillada, the version flavored with fresh 
strawberries. Yum!

minutes be equivelent to filling and letting the carbouy stand full? 
Opinions...facts....I understand Public health people advise 1t/gal in 
dish/silverware rinse water. Full carbouys take time, heavy lifting, 
uses water and chlorine and if it serves no real purpose.... " 
 
I suppose you mean household bleach , like Chlorox, by "clorine (sic) version 
of
bleach". 
 
For everything except pressurized stainless steel ( like Cornelius Kegs) , I 
use
Chlorox  in the following manner 
 
1) Safety glasses, rubber gloves and old clothes 
2) Put in pure bleach - about 1 cup - rotate the carboy until all of the 
insides
are coated. Purpose:  To dissolve any organic material using both the alkaline 
nature of the bleach as well as the oxidizing power.  Add about 1/2 gallon of 
hot water and rotate the carboy again, and discard.  Give it three rinses of 
about a 1/2 gallon each with hottest tap water  followed by a rinse with hot, 
boiled water. This is fast and doesn't require much lifting. Use hot tap water 
because it will have fewer bugs than cold water.  My hot tap water is 180F on 
brewing day. Dangerous, but effective.  Since we have no children home any 
longer or any old people around it is OK, no one gets burned except me. 
 
3) don't use Chlorine containing agents on SS that you intend to pressurize. 
Corrosion can weaken it at a critical point and may be dangerous.  Use oxygen 
based sterilants/sanitizers like acidic sodium metabisulfite or a commercial 
preparation.

"After 2.5 hrs `at` 158, iodine still indicated incomplete 
conversion.  i relaxed, didn't worry, told myself that it was just a test 
run anyway and proceeded to proceed with sparging as usual.  the final 
result was a gravity of about 1.052 on a target of 1.060.  my question: 
was my iodine erronious or is does my gravity reflect some starch content?" 
 
1) Was this a pale ale malt with a particularly low level of enzymes? What was 
the grain bill? Did you have a lot of adjuncts?  I would think even Alpha 
Amylase should have chewed up the starch in the malt after that time if there 
had been any substantial quantity of enzymes. I would be surprised, but it may 
be that your pale ale malt can't be taken all the way to 158F directly.  Cut 
back on your temperature to 155F next time 
 
2) A negative iodine test is one in which the iodine does not change color to 
reddish - blue - black 
  ( depending on the chain length of the starches)  and just stays 
brown/yellow.?  How are you running the test?  Did you get blue black on the 
mash liquid, the liquid you squeezed from the grains or on the grains? 
 
3) What might explain the low OG and the failure to get a negative iodine test 
is a poorly milled malt.  This is the most common reason for poor efficiency. 
Having recently purchased a new mill, I tried various settings and got an OG of
1.035, 1.045, 1.060 and 1.064 for various settings and procedures for the same 
recipe with the same 10# grain bill in 5.5 gallons. 
 
4) Pale Ale Malt is highly modified and made from a low nitrogen barley so you 
can do a single infusion mash. By itself, it does not require a protein rest.

Robert , 
 
If you are using Papazian's crazy carboy/overflow method as a primary fermenter
with attached hose, dump it. The overflow hose or poorly cleaned carboy is your
problem. Ferment in a bucket or plastic container (which can be cleaned easily)
and rack to the carboy after a week. 
 
Use my above bleach cleaning method. Iodophor is only good with clean vessels. 
It cannot sanitize anything under a layer of gunk.

I think you've answered your own question on why 1056 is so popular. 
It's clean and robust.  I usually use it for porters, which I add 
all kinds of adjuncts to, and don't want to mask the flavor and/or 
aroma with the yeast.  It also seems to ferment well over a wide 
temperature range, and can also handle fairly high gravity brews. 
It's certainly not for everything, but it definately is good for 
what ales you.

As part of my RIMS construction project, I'm looking for 1.5" copper pipe. 
 As I've read here before, getting a supplier to sell less than a full 10 or 
20' length is a bit of a problem.  Does anyone have a lead on the best place 
to get it, or does anyone have some that they could sell?  I only need about 
18-24".  TIA. 
 
Also, in the 
never-ending-quest-to-spend-large-amounts-of-money-to-make-cheaper-beer 
dept, I noticed an add in the current Grainger flier for a point of use 
water heater.  They have a 4 gal capacity heater for about $135.  The 2.5 
gal heater is a few bucks less.  Anyone ever use one of these?  Might be 
good for a hot liquor tank.  Do they work?  Can you control them with any 
accuracy?  Just curious.  I already have a hot liquor tank (Sankey keg + 
propane cooker), but I thought that someone else might be interested......

Duh, i said, "Hard to believe but Bass Ale is an 'IPA'". Hard to believe 
indeed.
I did not say 'Bass is the definitive IPA' or even 'Bass is a good IPA', or 
even 'Bass is good', I simply regurgitated what I've seen (on the bottle) and 
with doubt at that (the quotes around IPA were meant to express doubt). 
 
What is with all the nit-picking going on with in HBD? (i.e. Dave getting 
corrected for using the term "Leaf hops", sanitation's not sterilization, Carl 
getting hacked for offering his robotic palate, the good/bad job done by the 
GBAF PPBT)  It also seems that many of these nits are being picked 
by those who we respect and contribute much knowledge.  It's great to see 
posts from these people, but when they say stuff like this, I feel as if 
i'm being talked to down some ones ski-slope of a nose. Sometimes, I feel 
as if some of these posts are posted for the sole purpose of ego building. 
And while i'm ranting, I really hate it when someone catches up on several 
digests at once and then feels compelled to dredge up all kinds of old 
threads that were happy to be dead (these posts can usually be identified 
by the multiple slashes '/' in the subject line and most of the time really 
ought to be delivered directly to the poster who asked, especially when the 
post is several days old or has already been beaten in to the ground). 
 
Sorry this when from a peev to a full gripe. Maybe i'm just tense since i'm 
selling my soul this weekend.

Randy wrote: 
     My questions: 1) Will this work? It looks like a filter commercially 
     available ("The Filtration Kit", pg. 52 latest Zymurgy) and I'm pretty 
     sure that I can buy a .5 micron filter cartridge (like the one in the 
     ad). 2) How would I clean the filter after use? Also, should it be 
     stored wet or dry (full of liquid or empty)?  3) If I choose to 
     naturally carbonate (keg beer before it's finished fermenting to 
     carbonate, not sure I'm using the right term) can I still filter 
     the carbonated beer? 4) Any advice on transfer pressure, etc. 
*************************************************************************** 
I purchased the beer filter kit from the filter store, with the .5 micron 
filter.  I used the same setup you propose: 2 corny kegs and a CO2 
cylinder to push the beer through.  I recently used the setup again 
to filter some raspberry mead.   The key is to rack the beer into 
the first keg, attach the filter to the long down tube of both kegs, 
close the kegs and open the safety valve on the second keg.  I was able 
to push the beer through the filter (5.0 micron filter) with about 
30 psi.  My first experience with the (0.5 micron filter) was very 
dissappointing, just about couldn't get it to flow at all!  THe 
5 micron filter worked great and cleared the mead in short order. 
 
If you are planning to used natural carbonation (priming in the keg) 
then definitely go with the 5 micron filter and not the 0.5 micron 
filter.  I was told that the 0.5 micron filter would remove the 
yeast.  Also the 5.0 mircon filters are MUCH cheaper and easier to find. 
 
As for cleaning the filter, fill a keg some hot water and swap the 
filter connection... to back flush the filter.  Store the filter almost 
full with a weak bleach solution, being very careful to avoid contacting 
any stainless steel with the bleach solution.  When you are ready to 
filter again, push a bunch of hot water through the filter to rinse it. 
 
You can buy the filter housing at Builders Square, DIY, Budget HOme Centers, 
get the WHOLE HOUSE kind.  I bought another one with 2 filters for $34. 
 
Enjoy :-)

Hi All, 
 
Its been very interesting and informative to see the recent threads on beer 
styles
("best" Octoberfest, ultimate six-pack, and now IPA's). 
 
  My vote for the best IPA would be either "dead guy ale" or "Santa's private 
reserve ale", both made by Rogue. However, I'm not sure if either of these are 
truly IPA's. They fit what I would call an IPA (based on my interpretation of 
the
AHA style guidelines), but I'm not a "qualified" beer judge. Can any of the 
BJCP
judges in the audience comment on this (Al K., Jim Busch, Jim Dipalma, etc.)? 
 
  In order to keep this thread going, anyone want to cast some votes for what 
*readily available* microbrews would "define" the Dusseldorf Altbier style? 
 
I've brewed a couple of batches of what I think is a good altbier, but it has  
not done well in competitions.  Most comments that I got back seem to indicate 
that it was a good brew, but just not true to style.  I've never been to

Subject: Red Wolf


I stumbled across an article in a magazine called "Prepared Foods" 
(June 1996 issue) that describes the development of Anheuser-Busch's 
Red Wolf beer. 
 
An 11-member team was given 30 days to crank out a product to compete 
with Killian's Red.  They succeeded in 28 days. 
 
The bulk of the article (maybe 85% of it) describes the efforts of the A-B 
team to come up with the packaging (i.e. what do the labels look like) and a 
marketing strategy for the product.  In the small section of the article that 
describes the actual product development, the main point is that the barley 
needs to be roasted in just the right way to get that red color. 
 
Interesting, huh?

I purchased a water filter (from the Filter Store... Boy did I get ripped

can get the filter cartridges at any big hardware chain for about $2 a 
piece, This beats the hell out of paying $39 from the Filter Store). All in 
all I found that the filter worked very well with the .5 micron cartridge 
on very light color and lightly hopped beers. I also noticed a big loss in 
hop flavor and overall body in my brews, but as they said, the beer was 
crystal clear without any sign of sediment!

I don't think you got ripped. You are paying for the filter mostly. Sure, 
you can get a 10" housing other places for $20-25, and those cheapo 
filters for $5. The cheap filters are one time only filters. The $39 are 
reusable and cleanable, and if taken care of will last quite some time. 
The $39 are high efficiency, they remove over 99% of particles above the 
rated size. The cheap filters don't come close to this efficiency. I've 
been very happy with my 5 micron filter. (Std. disclaimer) I haven't 
noticed ANY lack of taste or body in my filtered brews.

I cleaned the filter by backwashing it between two kegs with a bleach and 
water solution. This works very well to removed any residue on or in the 
filter. I also would always backwash the filter before I would filter the 
next batch to assure cleanliness. I always have stored my filters dry but 
have friends that store them in the filter in a Co2/water  environment.

I sanitize my kegs with iodophor, then just push the solution through the

iodophor in the refrigerator.

This can be minimized if you presurize the receiving keg prior to 
filtering, kind of like counter pressure bottle filling.

Before filtering I would get the beer down to about 29 F and transfer it

15 psi works for me with a 5 micron filter. Cold is good. It also allows 
you to see how full your receiving keg is getting. You can watch the 
condensation work it's way to the top of the keg.

Subject: Corona Mill vs. Maltmills


 
 I have reached the point in my brewing where I need to buy a mill. 
 
 I figure I have two choices:  A Maltmill for $100+ or 
                               A Corona for $40 
 
  Considering the difference in cost amounts to a years worth of malt, 
is it really worth it to get the Maltmill?   Specifically: 
 
1)   Is the TASTE of the beer different?  I hear lots of stories of crushed 
      husks and tannin extraction and astringency, but is it real? 
 
2)   Is the extraction markedly different?  Will a Maltmill add 10 points 
     to my extract over a Corona? 
 
 Im sure there are brewers out there who have pondered this question and 
made a decision opting for a Corona - are you happy about it?  And, if not 
do you want to sell me your old one cheap?  :) 
 
TIA,

Subject: RE: SPARGE PH


 
in regards to questions about adjusting sparge water, 
ph should be checked, such that the runoff near the end does not climb 
to high.  by to high brewing texts indicate it is best to keep the 
ph of the final runoff below 6.0, and beter if below 5.7. 
 another addition of calcium may also be needed to insure 
correct levels in the kettle. this addition can be made in lump sum at 
the beginning of the water treatments or sprinkled on the mash.  best 
results would come from (IMHO and others) at the hot liquor tank. 
 
you also can add acid and salt to the kettle, if required.  you want to start 
the boil in the kettle with a ph of less than 5.6 and possible closer to 
5.4 or so depending on the beer (bottom fermenters high, top fermenters low). 
 
it has been mentioned that the calcium content of the beer should be 
50 to 80 mg/L, a good ly portion gets lost in the mash and boil, so adjust 
all along hte process. 
 
good luck

Subject: pH of sparge water


 
Adam Back asked about the pH of sparge water ... 
 
Sparge water pH is important.  If it is too high, it will extract 
polyphenols (tannins) from the grains into the wort and this can lead to 
an astringent beer.  One way to lower the sparge water pH is to add gypsum 
(CaSO4.2H2O).  However, for water which is highly alkaline to begin with, 
you may need to use lactic acid or phosphoric acid. 
 
 
My impression, from having lived in Germany for a while, is that German 
water is very chalky (alkaline).  This leads me to ask: 
 
 
How do German brewers, who are constrained by the Rheinheitsgebot, lower 
the pH of their mash and sparge water? 
 
Cheers!

My votes for IPA would have to be either SN Celebration (xtal malt flavor

hopped to hell, St Rogue is dryhopped, and deserve a place in the beer

I love 1056, and made a barleywine with it.  The flavor is magnificent, 
but I encountered one problem. 
I had it in primary for about 6 days, and in secondary for about 8 weeks. 
 I repitched before going into secondary, and repitched 1056 _again_ when 
bottling (using 1/2c corn sugar in a 5 gal. batch). 
This was thick stuff, reaching about 13% alcohol.  The problem was that 
it had really reached the endpoint, and I think the alcohol content was 
so high, it didn't carbonate when primed. 
Bottom line -- you may need another yeast (champaigne?) for bottling. 
Anyone with similar results?  Please email. 
Cheers,

Rick Dial / aa8jz 
N. Muskegon, Mi. 
 
I have been brewing for less then a year. I have been vicariously brewing 
here on the HBD for 
about a month. It seems many folks are as concerned about wort chiller 
cleaning as I am. 
My solution seems very simple and as such must have some serious drawbacks. 
Silver solder 10-15 wraps of 1/2 " copper tubing on the outside of my 15 
gallon stainless brew 
kettle. Run the tubing dry during the boil. Blast cold water around the 
outside afterwards and 
have no concerns about copper flavors or gunk in the counterflow chiller. 
Will silver solder bond correctly to the stainless? 
Will the cooling rate be significantly slower then with my counterflow 
chiller? 
Other concerns? 
tnx
