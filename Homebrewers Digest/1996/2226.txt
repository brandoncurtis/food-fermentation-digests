Brian asked 
 
 Does anyone know of any craft and 
 mega brews that are excellent and/or that define the style IPA? 
 
I'm a fan of Oregon IPA, Sea Dog IPA, and most especially Mill City Brewry 
(Lowell MA).  The Mill City entry was excellent when first released.  But they 
took some heat for the heavy hops component.  They toned it down ... darn. 
It's still my favorite, but now I have to brew my own... double darn.

Carlos sez - (concerning copper in brewing equipment) 
 
Does this mean I should put a penny into each bottle at priming? ;) 
 
Maybe, maybe not. What I do, though, is throw five *older* (copper) 
pennies into my boil kettle. Not only do I get small amounts of 
dissolved copper into my wort (to make the yeast happy), but the 
pennies also give the added benefit of acting as boil stones (produces 
a nice roiling boil). They are also cool to listen to rattling around 
in the bottom of the boil kettle. Pennies wispering in the wort? Ok, 
no more homebrew for me today - NOT!

"I did not say 'Bass is the definitive IPA' or even 'Bass is a good IPA', or

What is with all the nit-picking going on with in HBD?" 
 
Yes, please, quite nit-picking and discuss the original question, 'cause I'm 
curious, too.  The question was:  What are definitive commercial examples of 
IPAs?  John points out the Bass LABEL.  I've also noticed that the McEwans 
Export Ale (red labelled bottles) is LABELLED as "India Pale Ale", but I'm not 
sure it really is (but darn tasty ale, anyway). 
 
I had an "IPA" on tap at Jack's in SF, but I cannot remember the name of it. 
It might have been made by Ballard; all I remember was the logo on the tap was 
a white background "baseball diamond" shape with IPA along the left bottom side
in green letters.  It was a light gold color ale and had a nice, extremely 
bitter taste, but I don't recall what hop might have been in it. With the 100+ 
beers on tap at Jack's, it's a wonder I remember THAT much;-) 
 
As for the SN Celebrator fans, sorry, but I don't think Cascades would be found
in a true IPA style. Celebrator is just a strong APA, isn't it? American hops  
in a "true" IPA style?  I don't think so, but there's always one in every 
crowd. I'm also of the opinion that the American idea of "high" IBUs is higher 
than in Britain;  I'm sure someone out there in the US will say that McEwan's 
Export isn't bitter enough to be an IPA.  Which leads me to this thought: 
 
Maybe the question is best answered at the source of this style.  Help me out 
here Brits, but in my travels through England, I don't recall ever seeing an 
IPA in a pub.  IPA style was originated in England, but are there any 
contemporary commercial examples still produced there? Especially, anything in 
bottles that we Yanks might be able to get a hold of?

Subject: hey! chest freezer owners!


My post of a few days ago generated mostly responses of the type, 
"I'm interested in any response you get."  I got some helpful 
suggestions on how to best use a freezer, once I got it, however... 
No one had a response like, "Get the FreezerBurn 8200. You'll never 
regret it." So, let me re-phrase my query: 
 
What are some great chest freezers(for lagering, with an airstat)? 
Considering internal volume/cost-to-buy/cost-to-operate/quietness/ 
spouse appeal/etc. Any one buy a new one lately? 
 
Personally I am looking for one that will hold the big acid carboys, 
because I have accumulated a few over the years.  Before I put one in 
the car, and make the rounds of the appliance stores with one, 
I would like to benefit from the experience of others (in the grand 
tradition of the HB digest.) 
 
BTW, I want it for making Classic American Pilsener (per George 
Fix's Amateur Brewer article of many years ago) and for 
making Munich Helles.  I have used wet tee-shirts and ice baths 
(with California Common yeast for the CAP),  and even tried cramming 
a 2.8 gallon carboy in the kitchen fridge, (a real test of spousal 
patience) so I am ready to step up. 
 
Many thanks in advance,

Subject: False Bottoms, Heating Areas


In #2223 I think, Jim Busch quotes another writer who suggested smaller 
false bottoms for directly fired tuns.  Jim asked "why would you, if you 
weren't recirculating?" 
 
I don't know where the original posting came from, but a few issues back I 
argues for a larger false bottom for direct-fired tuns.  I can see both 
positions, but my idea centered around recirculating.  I want to have the 
entire heated surface (to the degree practical) covered with 
liquid-only--no grain touching the fired surface.  That's because I'm not 
stirring the mash, but only recirculating wort.  I want to draw as much 
energy off the heating pan as possible, using a continuous flow of wort to 
do it. 
 
A small false bottom, on the other hand, maximizes contact of the mash with 
the heated surface.  This implies stirring the mash (which I have no 
problem with at all).  It's just that I'm not doing that, normally. 
 
There seems to be some scorching concern.  A point I think bears repeating 
is that the liquid below the false bottom, in a recirculating system, never 
exceeds set point temperature except at the heating surface boundary.  The 
larger the heated surface in contact with the wort, the smaller the 
temperature gradient needs to be to shorten the ramp-up period to the next 
higher rest.  During the rest itself, energy inputs are absolutely 
minimal--10 second blasts every 10 minutes for temp maintenance on my 
system. 
 
With a substantial false bottom in a directly fired mash tub, yes, you need 
to be recirculating.  With the luxury of a jacketed system (steam or other 
working fluid) then no, life would be grand. Comments?

Subject: Temperature sensors / RIMS


Charles Capwell asks about PC card and temperature sensors for RIMS. You 
might get a card from Computer boards Inc (508)261-1123 the CIO-DAS08/Jr 
is $99 has 8 Anolog out , 8 Dig in and 8 dig out. I am going to buy one 
soon and other people were interested - why don't we get together and 
negotiate a quantity discount ? 
 
The copper tube in the wort thing was actually a copper tube in a 
seperate vessel maintained at 150 F. Passing wort through it with a 
pump will raise its temperature before returning it to the mash tun. I am 
presently writing a computer program to calculate the thermal efficiency 
of such a heat exchanger. Preliminary results indicate that with a 3/8" 
OD copper tube (25' long) and the hot water vessel at 152 F. If the wort 
is pumped through at 150 F it should leave at 150.8 F on the first pass. 
To completely exchange 2 gallons of wort will take 2 minutes. The next 
pass through the coil will raise the temp to 151.3 and then to 151.5 etc. 
Results are preliminary so YMMV. 
 
Actually what I wanted to do was keep the hot water at 150 F (mash temp) 
and when ready to mash out I would raise it to 170 F. The wort in the 
coil in the hot water would soon reach 170 F and after 10 minutes of mash 
out I would simply open a valve and sparge with the 170 F hot water. Neat 
if it works (thermodynamically that is). 
 
Temp sensors can be had from Motorolla the LM34 is approx $5 and has a 
0-5V output which can be read directly by the above mentioned PC board. 
You might also use a 0-5V  RTD (resistive temp device)  from Omega at (800) 
826 6342. 
 
As for electric valves. Has anyone taken a simple automatic lawn 
sprinkler valve (24 VAC coil) and made it work for hot wort. These things 
can be had for $10-15 and should work great if the plastic or seals will 
withstand the temperature. I would appreciate any feedback from people 
who have tried this.

Subject: commercial copies


Periodically people request recipes for a clone of this beer or a 
copy of that beer, and I always wonder why would you aspire to 
make a copy of a great beer, when you could make a great beer of 
your own.  Isn't making your own great beer what homebrewing is 
all about? 
 
For me, the style is the key.  I may look for a great Belgium Wit 
recipe, or an extra hoppy IPA recipe, or use the information in 
the style gudelines and some example recipes to make my own 
recipe, but ultimately it is my own beer, and not some clone. For 
example, this summer when I made an ESB, I looked up the style 
guidelines, I checked out some recipes to get some general ideas, 
and I created a recipe to suite my own needs.  I like Red Hook 
ESB, but I don't want to clone it, how boring.  So, as I continue 
with my lecture, for those of you out there that want to clone 
Sierra Nevada Pale ale for instance, why don't you try to figure 
out what it is that makes you like SNPA more than other pale 
ales? Figure out what it is you like about that particular style, 
and  find or create a recipe that produces your own joe schmo 
pale ale. 
 
I'll get off my soap box now.

I've noticed this also.  I questioned by local home brew store about this 
and he said that the yeast used for bottle conditioning is not the same 
as that used for fermentation.  He said they pasturise to kill of the 
yeast after fermenation and added different yeast for bottling. 
 
I guess if they didn't filter out the original yeast it would settle and 
stir up when poured.  Naturally after making a starter from a coopers bottle 
only the live yeast would reproduce and none of the original yeast would 
be present hence the different characteristics. 
 
I'm going on what my local home brew store owner said..If anyone knows better 
please correct. 
 
I have also never tasted the yeast flavour present in the original bottles 
in my own home brew.  This kind of supports the above. 
 
Incidentally, the way we pour bottled coopers here in Adelaide is to take 
the bottle, invert it and very gently twirl for 3 or so seconds. The intention 
IS to shake up the yeast sediment a little. You can control the yeast 
contribution
to the flavour depending on how much you shake it up. It actually tastes better
if
you stir it up a little.  If you shake ALL the yeast into the beer I find the 
flavour a bit too strong.  It is normal the drink coopers cloudy.

Actually Jim the filters I have seen are the same make and model number, so 
are th .5 and 5 micron filters. On this I beg to differ. The company in 
question is merely siezing the moment to make a profit just like when a 
Homebrew shop charges you $3 for a rubber ring you can buy at Builders 
Square for about 25 cents.

I like the added feature of being able to see the condensation. I have also 
transferred at 12 psi  and gotten great results. I try to change accordingly 
to style. 
 
I also think that if you do decide to filter your brew you should stick with 
the 5 micron instead of the .5 micron filter.

Just read an inquiry about Blue Moon.  I'm more familiar with 
the beer (especially that tasty Belgian White) than with the 
company that brews it.  However, I think it's actually a

As I am eating my lunch I wondered if anyone had ever

I asked around the office and got answers from 'pasta' to 
Morroccan Wheat.  Anybody know??  Can it be mashed? 
 
Couscous is a hard wheat that is basically broken into little pieces (and 
probably processed a little more.)  I is often likened to pasta because it 
is made from the same type of hard wheat (read high protein.)  So the high 
amount of protein would seem to be a deterrent, I'll leave it to the grain

If you're lucky enough to live in the philadelphia area, Yards Brewing Co. 
makes an excellent IPA. Available cask conditioned. They make THE best 
beer in philly today. They also make a pale ale, porter, esa (extra special 
ale), sassion, barleywine and old ale, all in 3 bbl batches. No bottles. 
 
Stoudt's in the same area also serves up a cask conditioned IPA and it is 
one hoppy brew. I actually had a glass that I couldn't drink w/o a pale 
chaser because it was too hoppy. I guess I was under the weather that day. 
It hasn't happened since.

Reply-To: Shawn.Scolack`at`tsr.gcastle.com 
 
 
I've got a few questions about using tea as flavouring in beer. I have a 
recipe for a 1 gal. batch, I got it from the book homebrew favorites... 
(1 1/2 lbs Light extract, 10 black currant tea bags, ale yeast) 
 
Has anyone attempted this yet? It sounded interesting and different enough for 
me to try it, especially since I'm very new to brewing (1 batch of brown ale 
under my belt so far). Anyways, I was also thinking of adding some honey to 
the recipe. Is this advisable? If so, I'm uncertain as to how much I should 
add. 
 
If anyone can help, I'd appriciate it.

Subject: Scotchbrite Pads


I use green scouring pads (eg 3M Scotchbrite) to make filters in the base of my
mash tun and boiler. They are a good compromise between filtering efficiency 
and
flow rate. The first run off from my mash tun with one of these filters 
installed is nearly bright from the start. 
 
But... 
 
1. What are they made from? 
 
2. Do they pose any risk to me, my yeast, or my beer?

Subject: German mash pH


Peter Ensmeyer asks how German beers constrained by the Rheinheitsgebot correct
their mash and sparge water pH. 
 
Well they could: 
 
1. Cheat. ie ignore the Rheinheitsgebot and treat their liquor. I'm sure this 
happens but obviously no one will admit to it. 
 
2. Use an acid rest. By starting the mash at a low temperature (?40C) create 
conditions for Lactobacillus Delbrukii to do their funky stuff and lower the ph
with naturally produced lactic acid. This is certainly done in many breweries, 
especially the more traditional ones. But what about the megabreweries that 
have
gone over to infusions mashing? This extra step can't fit in with their 
efficient ethos. 
 
3. Even some of the lighter coloured German beers contain a little dark malt. 
Maybe this is enough to lower the pH of the mash. 
 
I'm not sure how important sparge pH actually is. The pH of the mash is fairly 
well buffering and in the earlier stages of sparging the sparge water will be 
buffered by the mash. Of course later on this will not be the case. In my 
infusion mash system I find that the pH of the runoff is not outside the 
acceptable range before I have collected my target pre-boil volume (34 litres 
for a 1.5hr boil, giving 23 litres of green beer).

Subject: Wy1056 vs. Wy1084


Will Wy1084 (Irish Ale) just produce a drier finish than Wy1056 (American Ale)?
 Or does it lack the crispness and robustness of the 1056 as well?

Blue Moon is a creation of the marketing department of 
Coors. The Blue Moon beers are brewed under contract, by 
first F.X. Matt in New York, and now by Hudepohl-Schoenling 
in Cincinnati. There are at least three varieties in the 
Blue Moon brand line, all of them pretty good for such 
a product. I agree that the Blue Moon white, while not 
outstanding, is a pretty good example of the style. 
 
The main flavor component, besides the spices, is the 
wheat, not oats.

Answer to the question 1 the beer will not taste any different just

I like phosphoric acid, since I've been told that it's also a 
great food for the yeast.   Here in Austin, Texas, on the 
northwest side (Decker water treatment plant), my water's pH 
is 9.9 (!), so I've found through trial and error with pH strips 
that I need to add about 4 drops of phosphoric acid (sorry, I 
don't remember the concentration; I'm a mechanical engineer, 
not a chemical one) per gallon of sparge water to properly acidify it.

Gypsum-lined pipes, perhaps?   Or some other type of brewing 
plumbing which leaches acid into the brew?   Or perhaps a 
small amount of dark grains in the sparge water (maybe just 
pilsner malt for lighter-colored beers.) 
 
So, who's got entries in the Dixie Cup in Houston for Oct. 19 & 20th? 
I'm in the Traditional Porter category, and I'll be there. 
Of course, the main reason I'm traveling (home) to Houston 
that weekend is for the Gallery Furniture 20k road race (running.) ;-)

Subject: beer body


I was enjoying a brew with my wife at a local brewpub when I noticed 
that the beer seemed to have more body than I remembered from 
previous imbibing.  My mind starting wandering and I started 
wondering about different ways of adding body to beer.  Apparently 
mashing at higher temperatures encourages formation of dextrins, 
which are unfermentable and lead to greater mouth-feel.  Adding 
certain specialty grains, like crystal malts, also adds dextrins to 
your beer.  Being a relative newbie to brewing (though my 1st 
all-grain is sitting in my secondary as I write this - what an 
experience!) I was wondering if someone could discuss the 
differences/similarities in the two approaches for getting a greater 
mouth-feel.  Are they basically just two ways of doing the same 
thing, or are the differences in the final beer really noticeable? 
I'm also interested in other factors that affect body.

Subject: Corona vs. Maltmills vs. any other mill


Paul Sovcik writes that he is considering a mill and asks: 
> I have reached the point in my brewing where I need to buy a mill. 
> I figure I have two choices:  A Maltmill for $100+ or A Corona for $40

The answer to both questions is a resounding no.  What you will discover is 
that using the Corona can be a bit of a pain because the settings tend to 
creep a bit as you grind.  The Corona also produces a high percentage of 
flour, but you can live with it. 
 
You will not make better beer just because of your mill.  Take and two 
mills you've heard of, put them in the following sentence in any order and 
you will have a true statement: 
        The ________ Mill will not make better beer than the ______ Mill. 
 
There are several other mills available that you should also consider such 
as the Brewer's Resource, Glatt (out of business, but maybe you could find 
a used one), PhilMill, and Valley.  There are probably other mills, and I'm 
sure the collective will correct me in that case. 
 
The bottom line is that every brewer has purchased the best mill available 
- - just ask him or her.  I know I do.

Couscous, a North African staple food, is a granular form of 
semolina (coarsely ground durum wheat used primarily to make 
pasta). It's usually cooked and served as a breakfast porridge, 
side dish at dinner (with meat and vegetables), or sweetened with 
fruit and served for dessert. The Maghreb tribe steams it in the 
top portion of a special pot called a "couscoussiere", while 
chunks of meat (usually lamb or chicken), vegetables, chickpeas 
and raisins are simmered in the bottom part. 
 
I'm not sure how well couscous would work as a brewing adjunct. 
It has a high gluten content (as does most varieties of wheat), 
so it would tend to be sticky in a mash. On the other hand, 
malted and unmalted hard wheat is routinely used in brewing, so 
it certainly would be worth a try. 
 
Looks like another project for Delano "Adjunct Boy" Dugarm.
