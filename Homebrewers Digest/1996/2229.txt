Not exactly a flame, but I had an eisbock(or clone thereof) at a honky 
tonk that serves about 50 micros and imports(including PU!) on tap plus 
they have about a dozen of those big coolers(the kind you usually see at 
gas stations w/ soda and mega-swill) with even more imports and micros. 
This one came from around Niagara Falls on the Canadian side. Never having 
had a "real" eisbock I couldn't say if it was true to style or not. 
 
That was in the middle of August. When I made it back there in mid-September 
they didn't have it in stock any longer. Since then, however, I've seen 
other brews from the same company at various places around San Antonio.

 recent posting on calcium indicated some euro beers had 
real low calcium in the base water...... 
 
Jim Busch - can you help out does Pils Urq. add more all along 
the way, to the water, mash, sparge and kettle...? 
 
our water has real low calcium also, 14mg/l or so.... 
 
on brewing day i load up tha mash with base water, combos of cacl, caso4 
and if it is a black beer caco3.  a ph reading was usually 
taken and lactic or phos acid added - now that we know the results 
from differing beers we only do a spot check every once and a while 
on the ph. 
 
anyway....we also add salts ontop of the mash, and again to the kettle. 
 
from several readings,  a little more than half the calcium is lost in the 
mash, so more *should* be added down stream....depending on what your looking 
for in the beer.  i also read the 50 to 80mg/l in the final beer....although 
i have not had the money to send the beer out for testing.... 
 
great brewing to all

Subject: Re: Problem looping yeast?


 recent post mention 1056 being tough to get a chunk on the loop.... 
 
you really dont need a big chunk, if you take a coating of the loop 
they will/should be more than enough cells on the loop to do the 
job. 
 
if you really worried about it take the loop full to a smaller 
tube say 1 to 2 ml as the first step, then double them up from there. 
 
in most cases you do not want to take the whole isolated colony, 
due to the fact that you can never be sure it is pure, bacteria 
could be under the colony. 
 
what we do is look at the colony top side and bottom, with a large 
field scope, take a loop and start it in sterile wort, save a section 
to sucrose for posterity, take the wort sample after starting, and visually 
inspect,  then if it is production, plate on specialized media for wilds, 
bacteria etc....for the average homebrewer this is not a worthwhile endeavor. 
 
just take a little that will be more than enough..... 
 
great brewing to all

A while back a thread was posted that wanted to know what the percentage 
was of good first-time batches.  Add another one to the side of good 
first time batches. 
 
My friend and I used a beer kit to come up with a pale ale that 
resembled Bass' Pale Ale.  Fermentation on this beer was really quick at 
about 2.5 days.  After about 5 days, the beer was siphoned into a carboy 
and the beer stayed in that for another week.  We kegged it, tasted it, 
and rejoiced at how great the homebrew beer is. 
 
This beer exceeded our expectations.  We are hooked!  To the people who 
helped me out on the internet with very newbie questions-- Thank You! 
My questions were primarily answered via e-mail and helped a great deal 
in making our decisions.  Again thanks and may your beer be true unto

I would like to cast my vote (election day nears) for a favorite IPA. 
although not called IPA, Saranac Pale Ale is certainly way up there on 
the hoppiness scale. 
It is brewed by F.X.Matt in Utica, NY and is well worth a taste if you 
can get it in your area.

Subject: SS tanks


I think I have a source for SS tanks.  Check with your local hospital 
supply businesses about discarded oxygen tanks.  I recently bought two 
tanks for $25 each!  The outer shell is 25" tall with a 12" diameter.  They 
hold about 13 gallons of water.  The inside of the tank is stamped with 
"059  304  HT92955".  What does that mean? (Metallurgists?)  The inner 
tanks are about 20" tall and 10" in diameter with round bottoms and one 
1.5" hole in the tops.  These will soon be fermenters!  The guy who sold 
them to me said they cost about $1300 new and are used for about 2 years 
before being sold for scrap at about 9 cents a pound.  This guy has 
literally dozens of them waiting to be scrapped in several sizes and 
shapes, many bigger than the ones I bought.  Just thought this might be 
helpful.  Where else can you buy a SS kettle/mash/lauter tun AND SS 
fermenter for $25?

I guess Mike has finally done it...  brought back the traditional five cent 
beer!  Although I think the yeast would benefit from the zinc in the newer 
pennies as well as the copper.  I know that grain has some zinc and copper 
in it but how about for a starter? 
 
Okay, enough fun for now...  on with my search for knowlege.  I read a post 
in the last "Mead Lovers Digest" about putting CaCO3 in a mead must to keep 
the pH at ~4.0 and getting a much faster ferment.  What I am wondering is: 
would this approach be a benefit in a Belgian Strong Ale, Barley Wine, etc.? 
Would there be enough other flavors in these beers to cover up any flavors 
from the CO3?  For that matter what would the CO3 flavor be?

15% on the product is about 15% more than most mega-brew. no, that's not

Subject: Light Skunk Recap and Thanks


I'd like to thank those that responded to my query about light skunking. 
It was unanimous that the store manager was at best in error, and at worst 
misleading me.  Armed with these responses, as well as the article "Light 
and Beer" (Zymurgy, Fall 1996), I'll once again attempt to persuade him to 
treat beer properly. 
 
Special thanks go to Spencer Thomas, who led me to relevant information on 
his web site (http://realbeer.com/spencer/bottle.html).  The short 
article, coupled with an extremely informative graph were (pardon the pun) 
very illuminating for me.  Essentially, the graph shows the "blocking" 
capabilities of clear, green, dark green and brown bottles through the 
entire range of the light spectrum, including ultraviolet and infrared 
(190-802nm).  Apparently, the tests and data were originally provided by 
Ian Craig. 
 
Thanks for this, Spencer .... even though I *did* read the graph 
bass-ackwards the first time around! <g>

Dennis, 
According to the book "Brewing mead ..." by Papazian 
and Gayre, which I am currently reading, *cyser* is 'a 
ferment of apple juice and honey', i.e. a variety of mead. 
 
I also read in this book (on page 119) that what you are

Middle Ages.

Subject: Wild Hops Recap


A few months back, I brought up the topic of using wild hops, and now I'm 
back with my report.  There's good news and there's bad news.  The good 
news is that they made for a *very* drinkable beer.  I estimated them at 
5% alpha acid, and that seems about right; bitterness is just where I like 
it. 
 
Bad news: 1) definitely not for use as flavor or aroma hops -- a definite 
grassy smell reminiscent of alfalfa; and 2) I wound up with a *lot* of 
"brainy" material in the cooled wort.  I know that the topic of "brainy 
stuff" has come up here before, but I've forgotten where and when -- can 
someone refresh my memory on the why's and wherefore's of this stuff? 
 
Last, but not least, these were most definitely pollenated plants.  I 
wound up with seeds galore in my wort.  And Lordy, but did that stuff 
*stink* to high heaven when I threw them into the boil!  (The stink's now 
gone -- all that remains is the Tettnanger that I finished with.) 
 
Thanks to all who offered their input -- mostly ... JUST DO IT! <g>

Strangely enough, I was at a party several years ago where this

- -- Take a bottle of beer and shake it vigorously.

When you invert the carboy to put it on the cooler, 
agitating the contents is almost unavoidable.  Fortunately, 
there was a mop nearby. 
 
On the plus side, the beer _WAS_ icy cold, the way many 
folks believe it should be.  Given an *outside* party

Found this in a book I just checked out of the college library. I was just 
flipping pages and the Beer Gods intervened. :> 
 
On page 222 of "Guinness's Brewery in the Irish Economy: 1759-1876" by 
Patrick Lynch & John Vaizey, First Edition, printed 1960, the following 
paragraph appears: 
 
 "The brewery used English hops predominantly, so far as the records 
indicate, until well into the eighteen-fourties.  In 1842, for instance, all 
the hops came from Kent.  In 1853 small quantities of Bavarian hops were 
bought, and by 1858 American hops were being used as well.  This use of 
foreign hops coincides with the begining of the brewery's expansion.  By 1869 
the memorandum book had a formula 'one-third British, one-third Bavarian and 
one-third American', and this became a regular buying policy except in years 
when British prices rose because of scarcity." 
 
Just thoght I'd share this interesting anecdote with the HBD in light of 
the recent style thread(s). :> 
 
Oh, and since I haven't been able to really glean much of a recipe from 
this book yet, I was wondering if anyone either had some of the old 
Guinness recipes(and the brewing method) or could point me in a direction 
to get them if they're available? The anachronist in me would really like 
to give it a whirl. :>

Robert, 
 
According to Malting and Brewing Science ( p600 1st ed)  mouthfeel is not 
influenced by dextrins but by the proteins in the beer.  In my opinion it 
parallels very closely the ability to form a head and may have to do with the 
formation of microbubbles in the mouth which have some structure.  Try some 
wheat malt in your next brew and see what you think. 
 
Even though it has been shown that dextrins do not play a part in mouthfeel, I 
think the dextrins provide a taste sensation which I have never seen described 
scientifically and I can only call richness or in some low hopped lagers a 
"breadiness.".  It may have to do with a tricking of the sweet taste receptors 
on the tongue or some such thing, since dextrins do not have a high enough 
vapor
pressure to have an aroma.  This is only far out speculation on my part. 
Crystal malts contribute dextrins but also a caramel taste which could be 
described as lusciousness and will be different from the use of a higher  mash 
temperature to give a lower fermentable wort.

"How much calcium is enough?  George Fix states that 50-100 mg/l is about

seem to manage to 
make a half decent beer. ;-).  Is 7 mg/l enough?  Seems to me that it 
must be or Czech Pils couldn't be made." 
 
The simple answer is measure the mash pH and add calcium sulfate or chloride or
carbonate as needed. Most texts say the *optimum* saccharification pH is 5.2 - 
5.3, whereas the proteolysis steps are optimum in the pH 4 region. so it is a 
tradeoff.  These pH numbers and ppm numbers may be a result of the British 
concern for producing sugars efficiently from a low protein malt. Czech Pilsen 
is typically run at pH = 5.6 to 5.7  which contributes to some extent some 
higher tannin content and slower saccharification rates. The low calcium of 
Plzen will not stabilize the alpha amylase as well as 50 ppm, but in a high 
enzyme pilzen malt this may not be necessary. 
 
 50 ppm will do all of the above and seems to be a good number for most brews, 
but it is only the optimum and should be of concern if you are using a highly 
modified malt like British malts whose enzyme systems have been crippled by 
high
modification and high drying temperatures. Too many salts or the wrong kind in 
the water may make a brew taste minerally or salty  Don't be afraid to stray 
from this number.

Subject: IPA's


My understanding is that IPA'S rocked and pitched in an extended 
fermentation thru two passes in equatorial temperatures. And that the 
style would have a fruityness and estor quality to match the maltyness,

Many months ago there was a discussion about brewing software.  Someone 
posted that a new release of one of the software packages allowed the user 
to select between several authors' hop utilization tables.  Could someone 
send me email on the name and release of this package and whose utilizations 
are the default?  If there is sufficient interest, I can post what I find 
out, but I want to avoid 20 posts to HBD saying "Oh, yes... the software 
you're talking about is..."

 I think it's important to keep things clear so that the neophyte beer

Personally, I think this rush to protect newbie brewers by certain among 
seems more patronizing than helpful at times. 
 
This is particularly the case when the intended protective move is simply 
incorrect, causing more confusion than ever (i.e., Al's posts on pale malt 
and leaf hop terminology, or on cane/beet sugar production in the USA). Al, 
like George, often points to this driving need to protect newbie brewers 
from misinformation. 
 
Anyone can see that Bass claims to be an IPA. Anyone can educate herself or 
himself to the point that, upon tasting a Bass Ale, that claim to style is 
obviously questionable. 
 
Certainly, it would be a good thing for all newbies to know what is really 
true. 
 
However, it would be wonderful if the experts were also correct more often 
than they are. While they are protecting the newbies, who will protect them 
from their own misinformation? 
 
Now, lest this hurt and ruffle the flock and I receive flames from those who 
love all words, whether right or wrong, from the keyboards of the key 
defenders of the neophytes, let me recant now. 
 
I didn't mean a word of it!

There is a new cereal in the area ... President's Choice "Ancient Grains." 
The ingredients of this cereal are various grains (spelt, quinoa, kamut, 
millet, with some barley extract, wheat bran, barley flour, sea salt). All 
organic according to California's legal definition. 
 
For eating, it's one of the best cereal's I've had - roasted full grain 
taste. But I have a question about using it in a mash. I did some 
experimentation with it and didn't appear to get any conversion when mashing 
26 oz of this cereal with about 2 lb of pale malts (various pale malts 
because the local homebrewshop was down to nothing). Should it be soaked and 
boiled? I figured it would already be gelatinized, and would therefore be 
converted by the enzymes in the malt. Apparently not.

To the Collective: 
 
I hope you caught the Jim Koch bash on Dateline NBC on this past Sunday. 
Granted, I wouldn't have been watching had I not known about it from reading 
HBD. As a member of the media, I was not surprised that Koch was taken over 
the coals. I've never been a big fan of Jim Koch the businessman, but you 
can't say his beer is no good or deceptive because he doesn't brew it in 
Boston. Nor could I ignore the fact that A-B throws tons of advertising 
dollars into NBC. Or the misguided notion that Sam Adams costs more because 
of its advertising budget. 
 
I noticed that Pete Slosberg and other contract brewers didn't appear in this 
piece - just good media sense, or didn't NBC care enough about them because 
they weren't 'big enough' (i.e. more of a threat to A-B)? 
 
Face it - the newsmedia researches a story with a particular slant in mind 
and will discard any material opposing that point. The point of this 
particular story was to slander Jim Koch because he is causing A-B to lose 
money. Wouldn't you be interested in knowing what wound up on the cutting 
room floor? 
 
If you want to contact NBC, don't bother to wade through the address posted 
on the Digest a few days ago. Here's the direct address to Dateline:

A submission for the Homebrew Digest. 
Re: Chicha and corn 
 
Very interesting that there are brewers that are trying the brewing method 
chicha.  I have heard that chicha has been widely produced and consumed among 
the indigenous peoples of Peru for hundreds of years.  I spent summers in 
Arequipa (where Arequipena beer is produced) for several years and 
unfortunately never tasted the stuff, but it is used in a wonderful meat dish 
recipe called adobo.  Adobo is traditionally only served on Sunday mornings, 
presumably to cut the hangover from imbibing the night before. 
 
The corn (LARGE kernels - like feed corn) is first germinated for a day or 
two.  The resulting malt is dried in the sun, chewed, and spit into a pot of 
warm water (enzymes from the saliva do the starch conversion apparently). This 
left to ferment in an open vessel,  then is consumed as any other favorite 
beverage. 
 
This is all I know of the subject.  My next excursion to Peru will be next 
summer.  I'll try to get a more detailed recipe. 
 
I'll have to visit Scott's web page.

Subject: Stuck sparge


Hi, 
 
This weekend I brewed a Weiss beer. Or rather I tried to brew it. 
I had one big problem. A completely stuck sparge. I suspect it is due 
stirring the mash at too late stage. Or too much liquid in the 
mashtun. 
I tried an step infusion mash. I had the mash at 120 degrees for an 
hour, I stirred it a lot and the liquid was still flowing freely. 
(I recirculate by hand using a small bucket.) When I took it up to 
157 degrees my problems started. I suspect I should not have stirred 
it when the temp was higher. It was stuck completely. No more 
recirculation. 
How can I prevent this in the future? When should I stirr the grist 
and when should I not stir it. What effect does it have on the 
sparge ? 
 
Thank you very much.

Subject: RE: Redhook & A-B / Chocolate in beer / Truth in labeling


     Howdy! 
 
     Allan asks about the relationship between A-B and Redhook.  A-B owns a 
     large chunk (25% I think) of Redhook.  Redhook benefits from a great 
     distribution network. 
 
     ---------------------------- 
 
     Dale asks about using chocolate and coffee in beer (a la Redhook 
     double black brewed with Starbucks Coffee-a marketing dream...) 
 
     I've used chocolate in beer with good effect.  Just remember these 
     CRUCIAL things:  It's incredibly bitter in a chalky, unpleasant way. 
     Mash at high temp (156-158F) and use an unattenuative yeast to provide 
     plenty of residual sweetness to balance and support the chocolate (I 
     find Wyeast 1338 a good choice.  Lot's of residual maltiness). 
 
     The other thing to be warned about is the oil slick that you will have 
     in your fermenter.  It doesn't matter if you use powder or solid 
     chocolate, you'll get an oil slick.  Be careful to avoid the oil when 
     racking or you'll have headless beer. 
 
     There is a benefit to the oil:  you can fill the fermenter damn near 
     to the top because there won't be much krausen (sort of like 
     Fermen-cap, or whatever that stuff Jethro uses is called). 
 
     -------------------------- 
     WARNING:  The following contains rants, raves, and other hysteria. 
     Page down NOW to avoid: 
 
     Eugene writes in to say that he believes it's OK for brewers to make 
     "watered down" versions of classic beer styles, and label them with 
     the name of the style they were watering down (sorry, cc:mail won't 
     let me snip text from the HBD w/o GREAT efforts, so I've paraphrased 
     again). 
 
     I can't disagree with this more.  It does NOT speed up people's beer 
     education to be misinformed in such a way, nor does it aid in a 
     drinker's transition to flavorful beer.  It just makes them think that 
     ALL beers taste similarly, regardless of name.  It hurts us because 
     bland, boring beers will just assume new identities, wearing costumes 
     that make them look like a Wit! or an Alt. 
 
     It is becoming increasingly difficult for new brewers to get shelf 
     space in the beer stores.  This is, in part, because the shelves are 
     clogged with many bland, or even bad, beers.  I can't wait for the day 
     that this changes, but that will only happen when consumers become 
     educated about beer.  We must do what we can to speed this process! 
 
     I, for one, am quite tired of spending a good chunk of change on a new 
     American micro-brew only to be disappointed by a bland product that 
     does not live up to it's label claim. 
 
     There is nothing wrong with liking a light tasting beer, but it is not 
     right to label it as something it isn't, just as a marketing gimmick. 
 
     If you are trying to introduce a person to the world of beer you are 
     far better off by starting them on "transition styles" like English 
     pale ales and German light and amber lagers than by giving them beers 
     that pretend to be something they aren't.  They will only have to 
     unlearn all the tastes that they thought defined styles, and they may 
     be shocked and unpleasantly surprised when they try the real thing! 
     Of course, they may rejoice in the true flavors, too... 
 
     I'm done ranting now.  Have fun!

Subject: The Blue Moon Mystery is Solved!


Hello All 
There has been much talk about who makes Blue Moon.  Blue Moon is 
owned by Coors.  At first, the beer was made at the Sandlot Brewery in 
Coors field (FYI  Budweiser is the "official" beer of Coors Field!), but I 
think that BM is made in Golden now.  The great formulations come from 
some young dude (the name escapes me) who just got his PhD from 
some brew school (can't think of that name either!) in Belgium. 
 
Hey, just because it is brewed by Coors doesn't mean it is not good. 
Besides, Red Hook is Budweiser, Strohs brews a lot of BBC's stuff, etc, 
etc.

  I've got a few questions about using tea as flavouring in beer. I have a 
recipe for a 1 gal. batch, I got it from the book homebrew favorites...  (1 
1/2 lbs Light extract, 10 black currant tea bags, ale yeast) 
  Has anyone attempted this yet? It sounded interesting and different 
enough for  me to try it, especially since I'm very new to brewing (1 
batch of brown ale  under my belt so far). Anyways, I was also thinking 
of adding some honey to  the recipe. Is this advisable? If so, I'm uncertain 
as to how much I should  add. 
 
Shawn, 
I have used different Celestial Seasons (no affiliations, blah, blah) in 
beers and they work great.  I got the idea from the Bible where Papazian 
used some CS tea in a batch because it had barley in it.  I have used the 
Cinnamon Delight (the beer was OK) and the Blueberry Tea (this was 
awesome!)  I used a whole box of tea bags and steeped them in the 
wort for about 10 minutes after the boil. 
 
About the honey.  What the hell, throw it in there.  Just don't do too much 
experimenting at once, otherwise it will be hard to tell what ingredient 
added which flavor.  Homebrewing is an experiment, an art, and a 
science.  Have fun!

PS  I once brewed a Smoked Banana Porter  Yummmmmy!
