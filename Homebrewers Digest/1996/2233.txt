Subject: Plaster!


Regarding the mashability of plaster, I would say nil!  But, it was used 
in wine making both as a fining agent, and a de-acidifyer.  This is all 
historical though.  I don't think that any wineries are still using this 
method (though someone will prove me wrong).  But, if you would like to 
try mashing out plaster, who knows, maybe you'll create the next craze, 
fermented mineral water. 
Just my 2 cents

Subject: IPA hops


 I'm convinced that Columbus is the best hop to use for 
the Wall of Hops (TM) that is essential for an American IPA.  My 
last attempt at an all-Columbus IPA had an amazingly strong 
aroma, deeply piney and citrusy (more lime, I think, than 
grapefruit).  The hop flavor was so intense it had an oily 
character to it. 
 Dave Brockington suggests in his BT article that caramel 
malts are out of place in an American IPA.  I disagree, because I 
think that the caramel sweetness is a good counterpoint to the 
strong, sticky bitterness that a high hopping rate gives. 
 I don't mean to suggest that Columbus is the only hop to 
use.  Hopdevil, for instance, combines Tettnang with Cascade, and 
Tupper's Hop Pocket uses Mt. Hood.  Further afield, I've been 
surprised by how well an all-Saaz IPA turned out.

I have to disagree: dextrins do affect mouthfeel.  They do in my beers 
anyway.  Clearly dextrins aren't the sole contributor to mouthfeel or 
body.  I believe MW proteins are the dominant factor.  Dextrins *do* 
increase the viscosity of the beer, which affects mouthfeel.  I have 
first hand experience, in that I have been known to tweek keg beers by 
adding maltodextrin powder solution to decrease a sharp hop bitterness 
and add smoothness. FWIW, I find 5% flaked barley adds a wonderful 
creaminess and enhances head retention, and body without overwhelming 
flavor profile.

I don't believe AB *brews* any Redhook products, do they?  Anyway, IMO 
it's not the major breweries' facilities that are responsible for 
product profiles, it's the *recipe formulation*.  Does anyone out there 
believe that the AB, Coors and Miller brewing staff are not capable of 
brewing world class beers?  If one can make defect-free light beer, one 
can make Pale Ale and Helles. 
 
When I am on brewery tours, I always ask the tourguide why they don't 
throttle back the corn and rice and dial up the malt and hops.  When I 
toured Coors in Golden, I "learned" from the tourguide: "Winterfest is 
our strongest beer, and is technically a Stout"  Koooooky!

I stayed up late last night and drew images of the wort chiller 
everyone had such a difficult time envisioning from my description. 
They are in a uuencoded TIFF format, 4 images, about 8KB compressed 
each.  I don't want to fill up the HBD with uuencoded data, nor do 
I have an ftp site I can put them on... any volunteers? But 
if you are interested, send me a private email and I will email them 
to you.  It was kinda difficult trying to draw it even with it in 
my hands!!  These pictures are worth 4,000 words each ;-)

Well, Regan I'd be more than a little suspicious of that non-deliquescent* 
calcium chloride unless Sydney is drier humidity-wise than I remember. 
 
Cotton and WIlkinson "Advanced Inorganic Chemistry" says  " Although calcium 
salts are usually hydrated and the anhydrous salts are 
deliquescent*............" 
 
Chemical Rubber Handbook shows CaCl2.xH20, where x = 1 or 6 as being 
deliquescent and for x = 2 it says nothing ( likely an omission). 
 
I know CaCl2 on an alumina support is used as a drying agent in glass tubes 
through which air has to flow and in drying chambers.  It usually has some 
cobalt chloride mixed in so it looks blue when dry and pink when wet. 
 
* deliquescence is the ability to take up moisture form the air and dissolve in
the water absorbed. 
 
My advice don't use it.  It is probably not CaCl2 or at least not pure CaCl2 
despite what the label says. Go to your HB dealer and get some food grade stuff
or order it from a chemical supply house and make arrangements with your 
employer to expense account the purchase so you won't appear to be stealing it.
A few pennies worth of CaCl2 is not worth risking your life or reputation.

NItric acid is not suitable for acidifying your mash/sparge water.  Use a food 
grade acid like lactic or phosphoric acid.

Anton Schoenbacher has just completed his first partial mash and wants to go to
all-grain and asks: 
 
I think I want to brew smaller batches so I can do it 
more often (like 2-3 gallons) any body have advice pertaining 
to this, anybody like brewing small instead of large or vice 
versa, let me know. 
 
Anton, 
 
Everyone I know asks the opposite question - how can I brew larger batches? It 
takes just about as long to brew a large batch as to brew a small batch.  And 
one thing about homebrew, it is ready to drink when the last bottle is gone. My
advice, start small for the first batch or so, but think big!

Robert Marshall asks: 
 
"How does one remove one of those bungs from the top of the (5l mini-keg) keg 
after 
it is emptied?" 
 
I too was puzzled about how to remove this bung from the 5l party keg. I used a
pair of heavy duty needle nosed pliers, Put one nose into the hole and the 
other
gripped the edge, pushed the pliers toward the center of the hole ( to release 
one edge of the bung)  and then I pulled like a dentist and it worked great. 
Didn't damage the bung or the keg. I recovered the plastic part of the bung and
re-used everything.

,,,,, since I'm an extract brewer, I was wondering 
what the preferred PH is? 
 
The pH is not important if you are a pure extract brewer, since the pH is 
adjusted so that the mash is pH = 5.2 - 5.3 for its optimum saccharification 
rate. In the extract this is done for you. pH of the beer is controlled by the 
acids generated during fermentation by in large.  I can suggest that you add 
salts to your water, like calcium and a small amount of magnesium sulfate to 
help brighten the taste from the hops in British style beers, but the pH has 
nothing to do with it.

Bill Giffin says 
 
":Why not use an acid rest or add lactic acid?  Is the key calcium or is it 
having the  pH be in the proper range?  I tend to believe that having the 
pH in the proper range is far more important then the amount of calcium 
in the mash. " 
 
Dave B replies - 
 
Please notice I said "simple". acid rests are not that simple for some, as they
can take some hours, depending on the water. Lactic acid is OK, but it does not
contribute to alpha amylase enzyme stability. 
 
If the enzymes are stable, getting the optimum saccharification rate isn't so 
important and one can stray outside the "optimum pH" range.  Remember pH = 5.2 
- -5.3 is optimum only for the saccharification rate not the proteolysis rate ( 
which I believe can be more important for clear beers than a fast 
saccharification). 
British malts have low nitrogen content, so proteolysis optimization is not 
important and these malts have a low amylase enzyme content, so optimizing the 
rate of saccharification is important.  With lager malts, almost exactly the 
opposite situation applies - high protein, high enzyme content. These malts do 
deserve a different focus from the British malts. 
 
Both pH and calcium are important.  pH for the rate of saccharification and 
other enzyme steps and calcium for the alpha amylase stability. 
 
But as I said below, if you have a malt with LOTS of enzymes, then both of 
these
issues are less important. If you have soft, low alkalinity, non-bicarbonate 
water, the natural mash pH will come to the 5.6 -5.7 range just like in Plzen. 
This will be OK for saccharification and  other enzyme reactions if the mash 
time is temperature staged ( either by decoction or temperature staged 
infusion)
and held long enough at saccharification.  Remember however, you are at the 
mercy of your maltster and the water company. 
- ----------------- 
>>>Dave B: 
  These pH numbers and ppm numbers may be a result of the British 
concern for producing sugars efficiently from a low protein malt. 
<<< 
Bill Giffin says: 
 
"I have taken British malt and acidified it with lactic acid and managed 
to get good efficiency from this malt with only about 7 ppm of calcium. 
My water is softer then Pilsen by about 5 ppm.  So is it calcium or is it 
pH that we have to have to have an efficient mash? " 
 
Dave B replies: 
 
The short answer to cover *all* cases is - both. 
 
A deleterious effect of low calcium and high pH is most noticeable in a malt 
with low enzyme content mashed at a high temperature. Pilzen malts and other 
pale (not pale ale) malts obviously work OK  in this environment because they 
have lots of enzymes, since they weren't so highly modified nor heated to such 
a
high temperature during the drying stage at the maltster as the pale ale malts 
on which most of our guidelines are based. 
 
What do you call "good" efficiency ( I routinely get in the 90s) and what was 
your mash temperature 
( I routinely operate at the high end)? British malts, especially those low in 
enzymes, suffer the most from a low calcium content and high mash temperature 
and may give poor efficiency and a more fermentable wort than expected because 
the alpha amylase is less stable than in a higher calcium environment.  Ergo, 
efficiency suffers if the alpha amylase disappears before the starch is 
completely converted to soluble carbohydrates . The beta amylase is long gone 
by
this time, of course, and because the remaining starch is not converted ( lower
than expected OG) by the alpha amylase to predominantly (80/20) non-fermentable
dextrins, the FG is lower than expected at the high end of the saccharification
range. 
 
I wish I had a chart that showed the effect of calcium on alpha amylase 
stability as a function of temperature in an actual mash. My comments are based
on reading, comments of others and my experience. 
- --------------------- 
>>>Dave B: 
Czech Pilsen  is typically run at pH = 5.6 to 5.7  which contributes to 
some extent some higher tannin content and slower saccharification rates. 
The low calcium of Plzen (water) will not stabilize the alpha amylase as well 
as
 
50 ppm, but in a high enzyme pilzen malt this may not be necessary. 
 <<<< 
Bill Giffin says: 
 
"Boy,  I have had at least 15 different Czech pils and very few of them 
have the degree of tannins that I can even notice." 
 
DaveB replies: 
 
I agree, that's why I said "to some extent". Most true Pilzens use a lager malt
low in husk tannins, but the high  pH in the absence of calcium does contibute 
some. It is definitely not an outstanding taste and I didn't mean to imply 
that.
It was just an aside comment. I do not have literary proof of that in hand, 
and,
as you indicated, it is more noticeable in some than others. 
- --------------------------- 
Bill G says: 
 
"My saccharification rate is no problem and when I brew a Czech style pils 
I only add a bit of lactic acid to the sparge water to drop the pH of the 
sparge water to 5.7." 
 
Dave B replies: So do I. I use about 1/16 tsp of 80% Lactic Acid in four 
gallons
and it works well. 
- -------------------------- 
>>> 
 50 ppm will do all of the above and seems to be a good number for most 
brews, 
<<< 
Bill G says: 
 
"Not for a Czech pils" 
 
Dave B replies: I agree, but notice I said "most" brews which I think was the 
point of the original discussion. I believe I used the Czech Pils discussion as
a counterpoint to normal practice and what we read in most books. 
 
 I use soft water and a very low calcium and mash at pH = 5.6 -5.7 for a Czech 
Pils just like I indicated above, however, a good guideline for most 
fermentations is 50 ppm. It is a guideline and not a hard fast rule. That is,  
it offers a safe place to start.

One aspect of batch scaling which was mentioned but not explored is the 
apparent non-linearity of batch scaling.  A while back there was a thread on 
this topic; how to make 10 gal vs 5 gal from the same recipe.  Seems like I 
remember that you basically double the base malt, but dark malts (and other 
adjuncts?) go more like 1.5x, but no explanation was offerred or at least 
agreed upon.  Does this mean that to do 2.5 gal, you'd use 0.57x the dark 
grain of a 5-gal batch?  ANyone with experience wanna chime in?

Subject: Re:  Grains Storage - whats best?


My wife has a book on bread making which addresses the issue of 
storing flour.  Flour stored in air-tight containers in the 
freezer apparently keeps the longest.  If one assumes that grain 
is simply course flour, perhaps the recommendations in this book 
apply. 
 
I have stored grain in thick plastic bags in the freezer and 
have not seen any measurable drop in mash efficiency, nor have I 
detected any off flavors associated with frozen grain.  One thing 
is that it is more difficult to perform  a single step infusion 
mash because the initial water temp has to be around 180F, which 
may kill off some of your enzymes.  I try to remove the grains 
from the freezer the day before and let them warm to room 
temperature.  For three or four years, I've been buying 25 kilo 
bags of grain and storing them for up to six months without any 
noticeable deterioration of quality. 
 
Some caveats: 
 
1.  I have to invest in a sight tube or some other device to 
accurately measure volume so that I can accurately calculate mash 
efficiency.  Right now I have marks on the outside of my kettle, 
but, I don't think this is accurate enough to detect a small drop 
in efficiency. 
 
2.  I haven't entered any competitions, so professional judges 
have not tasted any of the beers brewed with frozen grains. 
Perhaps  a judge would be able to detect off flavors that I have 
missed.  On the other hand  I have a lot of friends who are self 
proclaimed Northwest beer snobs and they like my beer - except the 
pepper beer, nobody liked that one.

On the dateline/megabrewer thread, 
 
Perhaps some Government regulation is in order.  If a brewery, big 
or small, says their beer is a wheat beer it should have a certain 
percentage of wheat in it.  If somebody wants to sell an IPA, it 
should not be a budmillercoors with brown food coloring in it. 
Think about it, when you buy an apple pie, the law says that there 
has to be some apples in it.  Of course the law would have to be 
written so that it would not stifle creativity. Additionally, it 
could include a provision that ensures a pint of beer in a bar is 
actually a pint of beer, kill two birds with one stone.  I'm not 
a fan of big government, but I also don't like lousy beer.  I 
really don't like buying something that looks like a mirco-beer 
with a fancy label which promises a craft beer, but actually turn 
out to be budmillercoors crap.

Subject: O2 in wort


Good morning all, 
 
With all the talk about aeration of the wort with O2 and air pumps, I 
wonder if we are not just reacting to a symptom rather then the real 
problem. 
 
Too much O2 is bad for the yeast.  "Finally it should be emphasized that 
oxygenation must be restricted, otherwise fermentation is too vigorous, 
yeast growth excessive, and beer quality suffers."  From M&BS 2nd 
edition. 
 
So when you hit your wort with the pure stuff don't overdo.  Perhaps 
don't even bother.  Maybe you should use a pump and have just one more 
place to harbor bad beer bugs to infect your beer.  I have it why not 
just fix the problems with you under pitching of the yeast, the variable 
temperatures you subject your fermenting beer to,  to have the correct 
temperature for the yeast you are using and last but not least make sure 
that there are enough nutrients in the wort to have happy yeast. 
 
Aerate with a simple and easy to clean 4" bit of 3/8" copper tubing with 
a few holes drilled in it.  Works great.  The only problem I have had 
with fermentation was the first of 200+ batches of all grain beers and 
that was because of varying the temperature.

Subject: Imperial Stout


In the Wheeler and Protz book, Brewing Your Own Real At Home, there is a 
recipe for Russian Imperial Stout on page 145. They say "Barrel the beer 
after fermentation and mature for a year or more."  Bottling then is 
conducted and the beer is aged for at least another year.  Does anyone 
know if they specifically mean to age the beer in a wooden barrel to let 
it develop character or is it acceptable just to hide it away in a 
glass carboy for a year ?  Or, do they mean to keg the beer and let it 
slowly come into condition ?  It  finished at 1.027 (start OG 1.102), seems 
to have cleared very well after 2 rackings and is thick enough to skate on. 
I am wondering if I can wait two years.   I would appreciate any thoughts by 
post or private email. 
 
Thanks,

Adam, I'm glad you found the article interesting. Because of space 
constraints, BT didn't do an adequate job with the master data table. 
With everything combined for the split batches, it's hard to follow to 
see what was done and how DO levels changed when different methods were 
used. A WEB version of the chart is available at 
http://www.execpc.com/~ddavison/index.html and should make it clearer 
that the amount of effort and time spent using pure oxygen far out ways 
other methods to dissolve the same volume.

I was working with basically Homebrew pitching rates. These rates are 
rather low compared to commercial operations. I found that DO levels 
around 7 or 8 ppm to be the optimal areas homebrewers should shoot for. 
Sure the lag times are extended, but once the fermentation begins, it's 
vigorous. Dissolving 14 ppm will extent the time before fermentation, 
and will also reduce the flocculation capability of your yeast. Levels 
around 4 ppm produce sluggish ferments that take much longer to 
attenuate and can allow bacteria's to get a foot hold. The more vigorous 
the ferment, the more CO2 dissolved and the less sugar available, the 
lower the chance to something living it that environment and altering 
your flavor. 
 
>  To me the article showed that if you own an oxygenator you may as

Several things have to be addressed with this. How do you brew All-grain 
or extract ? Do you pour the cooled wort into fermenters? Normal 
splashing of wort into a fermenter doesn't cut it. You still have to 
shake the fermenter or use another method to increase the DO level. I 
hate moving 5 gallons of liquid in glass around no less shaking it. 
Basically, the article started as a test to see what levels of DO could 
be dissolved, and evolved into testing various methods to see what could 
be achieve from each. I would use the Oxygenator or Xgenator any day. I 
think I also showed that the use of an aquarium pump and stone will not 
generate the results desired. It's a start. More research needs to be 
done, and I welcome others to continue where I left off.

Subject: Going All-Grain...


     Well it had to happen... 
 
     I turned 40 and the next thing I knew, a friend and fellow homebrewer 
     gave me an all-grain kit for a Rauchbeer.  (I think she misread it as 
     raunch beer.)  Until recently, I never would have considered 
     all-grain, but over the past couple years of reading HBD, I have been 
     getting the itch to move to all-grain.  Thanks folks! ;) 
 
     Given that I have no experience with all-grain, no experience with 
     rauchbeer, and only 1 lager under my belt, I am soliciting advice. 
     Private email would probably be best, but I'll leave it to you. 
 
     The kit includes 5# German Pils, 5# German Vienna, and 1.5# German 
     Rauchmalt.  It also contains 1 oz Northern Brewer (bittering) and 0.5 
     Tettnang (finishing) and Wyeast 2206 Bavarian Lager.  It also contains 
     no directions. 
 
     Would anybody care to recommend a mash schedule?  (I have a 10gal Gott 
     cooler w/ Phil's Phalsebottom.)  Would a decoction mash be 
     appropriate/beneficial?  How about a fermentation/lagering schedule. 
     (I have a refrigerator with temp controller.)  I may make 4 gallons, 
     instead of 5 and rely more on first runnings and less on sparge 
     because my kettle is only 8 gallons and I'm not sure how much I will 
     like a smoke beer.  Any comments?  How about a water profile 
     suggestion?  My water is pretty soft or I could build from distilled 
     if I needed to do so.  Any suggestions about what goes with Rauchbeer 
     or how best to enjoy it are also welcome.  Christmas dinner may be a 
     BarBQue this year.  Yummmmm

No surprise there either, that is if you understand yeast metabolism. 
The first phase is the lag phase, and is *aerobic*.  The yeast will 
take up oxygen and nourish themselves without much population increase 
until the oxygen is depleted.  The only byproducts at this stage are 
H2O and CO2.  As soon as oxygen depletion occurs, they go into 
fermentation which is an *anaerobic* phase.  The cell population will 
go up rapidly to a max of about 5 million cells per milliliter and 
alcohol and CO2 will be produced.  Add more oxygen and you increase 
the lag phase, however, when the fermentation starts, you will have 
yeast which are in a much healthier state than with less oxygen.

  Hey, 
 
  Now that we all have the differnces between pale malt, pale ale 
  malt, lager malt and pils malt under our belts (so to speak),  what 
  grains do people prefer for adding head retention-ish proteins to 
  the brew... flaked barley? malted wheat? unmalted wheat? 
 
  If you post a reply to this, please include asummary of the 
  different effects each has on other attributes of the beer (mouth 
  feel, taste, haze...yada yada). 
 
  Thanks. 
 
 
  Now for a thought experiment.  What if you take a very low AA hop, 
  say a Liberty 2.2%AA and use it for bittering - a full 90 min boil. 
  There is only a miniscule amount of alphas so the bittering would be 
  almost non-existent and the aroma properties would be 
  well-volatilized from the long time at high temperature.  Would you 
  have the heart of the hops?  If so, what's in there? 
 
 
  Brew happy,

I found a recipe for Chocolate Stout on the Cats Meow and loved it. 
After looking for another extract/grain stout recipe with chocolate, I 
want to try something based on Mocha Java Stout and Ursa Major Stout 
from the Cat's Meow and some advice from AlK.  This is definately not a 
sweet stout like the other Chocolate stout I made and even though I am 
trying for a more bitter style I'm worried that the following may be too 
bitter after factoring in the chocolate bitterness.  Also, I'm wondering 
if I should try to increase the body by substituting some Laaglander 
extract or adding some maltodextrin.  Any ideas or advice on the 
following:  TIA 
 
Ursa Mocha Java Stout 
5 Gallons OG~1.073 IBU 55+ 
6.6# liquid light malt extract 
2# dry light malt extract 
1# crystal malt 90L 
1# chocolate malt 
1/4# black patent 
1/2# roasted barley 
4 oz cocoa (12 TBs) 
Bittering hops 22-23 HBU 
Finish Hops 1oz Willamette, Fuggles, or Cascade 5-10 mins

Hi All, 
I am still fairly new at brewing.  I built an immersion chiller also 
but after reading other peoples views on this, I must admit that I am 
a little confused. 
I understood that bringing down the temperature of the Wort slowly is 
a good thing, to avoid the shock of hot wort hitting ice cold water. 
My chiller is just copper air conditiioning pipe, coiled with input 
and output to the sink.  the cold running water cools to 25c (70F?) 
in about 25 minutes.  I thought that this was good. 
Could someone explain why the chiller and if there is an optimum 
chill time and why.  Sorry about the rookie question, but I built it 
on the advise of a friend to help to get rid of a off-taste in my 
beer, apparently common to most rookie homebrews.  But I never new the 
chemistry involved. 
 Thanks for trouble,
