Subject: Yeast Storage in Water


Just a datapoint on yeast storage... 
 
For over a year now, I've recovered yeast from slurry and saved it in 
preboiled, (not distilled water) for periods up to eight months without 
any problems. In fact, the stored yeast seems to start quicker and 
settle out more quickly than its original Wyeast packet. 
 
The method is simple: a day before bottling, I take three one quart 
mason jars, fill them half full (half empty?) with filtered cold water. 
These three jars are then placed in a brew pot, along with three canning 
lids (the lids are not on the jars, just in the pot) with about two 
inches of water in the pot. Place the cover on the pot, heat to boil, 
and let simmer for 15 - 30 minutes. Open the pot, and with a pair of 
tongs, place the lids on the jars. Tighten the lids on the jars, and 
leave the jars in the pot until room temp. When you take the jars out, 
the lids should have sealed themselves (just like any other canning), 
and what you have is cooled, sterilized water in a sealed jar. 
 
When bottling time arrives, siphon your beer out to a bottling bucket. 
Open one jar and pour the water into the slurry. Swish this around, and 
pour the watered down slurry back into the empty jar. Put the lid back 
on and shake. Let it sit about 10-15 minutes, and you will see a 
whitish, maybe slightly tinted liquid of yeast and water separating from 
hops and other trub. Open jar #2, and pour the yeast water into jar #2. 
Put the lid on and shake. Wait 10-15 min. Pour the yeast water from jar 
2 into jar 3. Put the lid on and shake. Put this jar in the fridge. When 
this jar settles out completely (could be 1 - 5 days), you should have 
1/4 inch to 3/4 inch of whitish yeast settled on the bottom, and what 
would appear to be beer as a liquid over this. Keep the jar in the 
fridge and take it out before you begin to brew. The goal is to allow 
the yeast in the jar to reach room temp before pitching. If you prefer 
starters, all the better, just allow for the extra time. 
 
Needless to say, its best to try to keep contaminants to a minimum any 
time you open or handle the jars, slurry, or fermenter. I do this by 
washing all outside surfaces with the typical bleach/water sanitizing 
solution, including counter tops where a lid might happen to fall. 
 
I also am cognizant of the fact that yeast can mutate, and what I do is 
very unscientific in assuring that the same strain I started with is 
what I end up with after a few uses of recovering the same yeast slurry. 
However, the beer seems to start quicker, ferment with better activity, 
settles out quicker, and most importantly, tastes great. 
 
BTW, I also know this is nothing new - it is called yeast washing. The 
point here is that even the most basic homebrewer can store yeast in 
preboiled undistilled water and still achieve success.

Subject: Red Dog - Quasi microbrew


Living on another continent, I have browsed rather hastily through the 
submissions regarding Red Dog and wether or not it is good or  brewed or 
owned by whom. However, as I happened to see an article on Miller in the 
latest issue of Business Week, maybe this is of interest to somebody? 
 
The article is named Suddenly, No High Life at Miller and signed Richard 
Melcher/Cary Spivak. The message is that Miller in Milwaukee are reducing 
staff for the second time this year, and key brands are down sharply exept 
for Lite which has a slight growth. A 1% profit drop has been forecasted. 
The biggest disappointments are the heavily hyped introduction of the Red 
Dog brand in late 1994 and the would-be flagship Miller in February this 
year. After some brief excitement Red Dog, which was positioned as a 
quasi-microbrew, is dropping like a stone. The cure for Miller seems to be a 
huge new campaign for Millers Lite. 
 
Now you know what to expect!

Subject: Stout Yeast advice


In HBD 2233 I asked for advice on a Bitter Chocolate Stout recipe and I 
left off the yeast. I was going to use Wyeast 1084 Irish Ale yeast which 
I have never used.  Any comments on this one.  I also hope to use it for 
a strong scotch ale.  I used Wyeast 1728 Scottish Ale yeast and made a 
nice scottish style ale something similar to McEwans export or Sam Adams 
Scotch Ale.  But I'd like to get something with more butterscotch taste 
than I got with 1728 something more like McEwans Scotch Ale.  I remember 
reading to rack to a secondary early to increase the dicetyl for a 
Scotch Ale.  Any similar advice on using 1084 for the Stout and for a 
later Scotch Ale.  TIA.

Subject: Thames Valley Update


Hey all, 
 
A few weeks ago if anyone remembers I posted asking if anyone has used and 
or had problems with the new Thames Valley Wyeast. 
 
Like I said, I had a great starter going but had a problem with the yeast 
getting started in an actual batch of beer. 
 
So anywho, here is my initial take on this yeast... I am now three batches 
in on my original pack of Thames Valley (A Stout, A brown Ale & A Red Ale). 
 
 
Once I got the yeast going it fermented very very well. It doesn't seem to 
ferment too dry and adds a very pleasing aroma and taste to the beer. I 
tapped the Stout 2 nights ago and was relieved that the yeast made a good 
beer. I think the yeast would be great for a porter and will be trying that 
soon. 
 
Thanks for all the responses I got from my initial post about this yeast. 
It seems that almost everyone else has had problems with this yeast and 
anyone that plans to use it should expect some problems. Like I said 
though, once I got this yeast going I have had no other problems with it. 
 
I am going to try to get this one pack up to about 13 (love those prime 
numbers) batches just to see if it starts to mutate and whatever and I will 
keep you all posted. 
 
Later

Al, once again your diatribe is harmful to both common sense and the HBD. 
Dave didn't say to lager in a plastic carboy, only to primary. Have you 
never heard of using open fermentation for a primary? If you think this is 
a brewing error, you are in disagreement with more than 80% of the world's 
master brewers. If "Plastic is hard to sanitize" why do you spend a week 
with bleach in your carboy? That ought to be enough to sanitize plastic 
too. 
 
I'm sure some are happy to hear your daily perspective on things, but if 
you must, leave it at that... offering an alternative. No need to be 
offensive, and really, there is no need to ascribe to your attackee 
something that he never said in the first place. 
 
The credibility of your brewing advice plunges IMO when your credibility as 
a debater falls to such gutter tactics. 
 
Dennis 
 
P.S., there is no need to flood my mailbox the way you did last time I 
suggested being more civil on the HBD, you are on my killfile.

What was the "trub" artical about?  I would like to know more about this 
since my yeast has me doing an experiment, on how long can I keep my beer

Subject: biodegradable packaging.


I have received some computer equipment packed in tons of biodegradable 
'peanuts'. They are supposedly made from corn or something similar 
and nicely dissolve in water. In the spirit of the recent wave of weird 
beer ingrediences - can one made a beer out of it? I guess it could be mashed 
with barley malt. However I am not sure if it does not have 
any added chemicals and fungicides. Maybe is it even dangerous poison? 
On the other hand - what a great recycling idea! Environmentalists 
should think about legislating to make it compulsory in every beer!

          Hello, all! 
 
          Thanks to all of you who straightened me out about lager yeast 
     fermenting at ale temps.  Once again I find myself in a sort of yeast 
     dilema.  After 24 hours of vigorous fermentation using the Canadian 
     Ale strain at ~72^F (22^C), the whole room has that wicked sulfur 
     smell that I associated with the above-mentioned lager fermentation. 
     Is this a problem and, if so, what can I do about it?

Subject: re: calcium and ph


Top of the morning to ye all, 
 
Dave B replies - 
 
Please notice I said "simple". acid rests are not that simple for some, 
as they 
can take some hours, depending on the water. Lactic acid is OK, but it 
does not contribute to alpha amylase enzyme stability. 
 
The pH of my water is about 6.8.  An acid rest of 25-30 min will drop the 
pH of the mash to 5.3.  It seems simple enough to me, get the mash to 
95F+/- and the pH will drop.  Another 1/2 hour to have a beer. 
 
If an acid rest works, why not lactic acid?  Is the alpha amylase enzyme 
stability a function of pH or calcium? 
 
>>Dave B 
What do you call "good" efficiency ( I routinely get in the 90s) and what 
was 
your mash temperature 
<< 
 
Mid 90's with mash temps from 149 to 154F.  So even with the low enzyme 
levels in the British malt it appears that pH is more important to yeild 
then is calcium.  Have to remember my water has only about 5ppm of 
calcium. 
 
Another question, how much calcium does malt have?

I agree with this comment.  I like a bit of malt for that Wall of

One comment on this labeling the origin of a beer thread. 
 
If A-B or whatever convinces the public that knowing where 
your brew is produced is important, then that makes brewpubs 
and homebrewers come out on top.  When you're looking at 
the brewery while sipping your favorite IPA, you don't have 
to worry about where it was made.   And how far it was shipped.

Many thanks to Dave and everyone else for your advice, I love this forum!  I 
have a copper racking cane that i fashioned and will be using tonight for my 
pumpkin ale, A extract/partial mash. Ill rack from the brewpot to the 
chiller.  Dave, my email thanks bounced back so included and expanded it 
here, Thanks again. 
 
Phil Wilcox. 
 
AAAAHHHHHGGGG!! What Happened? 
 
I feel alot like charlie brown. I had a few problems brewing last night, The 
recipie is the Pumpkin Ale posted in Cats Meow. The only changes I made was 
to include the extra .6 lbs of LME (premium brand) and use 1/8 tsp ground 
corriander instead of seeds. All other directions were followed expressly. 
 
I balanced my mash water to 150, added my grains (First time I used my 
Corouna, That went badly too. I got alot of flour from the Pale malt. The 
crystal turned out fine.)  I scooped out the hot pumpkin and added that--duh 
it raise the temp to 200 in a flash. Half tray of ice cubes fixed that. 
Mashed at 150 for 60 min then Poured (ouch, I know) into lautertun. Sparged 
with another 1.5 gal of 170 deg water. (5min) 
 
Returned to stove and added LME. Brought up to Boil, Hopped, spiced, hopped 
right on schedule. Proceeded to chill as advised and to my suprise I could'nt 
get a decent siphon going at all. Only a trickle. Tried the chorboy, the 
inverted racking cane stoper, Whirlpooling...Nada. Painfully slow. 15 
min/gal! 
 
Eventually gave up and carefully, gently, Cleanly went to my bucket/lauter 
tun with spigot setup. Is this just better gravity? Would a racking cane of 
greater than 3/8 copper tubing be better? I cant wait to buy/fashion a real 
mash/lautertun. This really stinks. Beer came out at 72 deg, added extra 
water sparged trough saved grain bed in a cheese cloth& Collender into a 
funnel to fermenter. Temp went up to 74. 
 
I didnt have time to make a starter from my smack pack, I cleaned it & 
siccors with tsp, and rinsed with cheap vodka, pitched, stoppered shook and 
carried to basement. Next major problem SG. 1.030! How? Why? I had 
brewmeister for my mac till my external harddrive crashed. and now cant find 
a version that isnt Bin Hexed. But from what I can figure SG. shoud be in the

Subject: Bigger breweries and RIMS


Hi there, 
 
I have general question about bigger breweries and RIMS or other 
mashing styles. 
 
Is it just the homebrewers that uses RIMS ?  Does bigger breweries use 
it as well ?  If they are not using it what do they use ? Decoction 
only ?What is the biggest brewery that you know that use RIMS or 
infusion mashing ? 
 
Could somebody please discuss this ? 
 
Thanks a lot in advance

In my quest for a controlable souring microbial activity, I have been 
investigating kombucha for the past couple of months. I first trained it 
(without difficulty) to grow on hopped wort. I was afraid that the 
antimicrobial activity of hops would interfere with it, but that was not 
the case. I then tried to get kombucha and ale yeasts (random mixture of 
everything I had in the fridge) to learn to coexist. 
 
Unfortunately so far the kombucha wins. I have lots of malt vinegar.

Subject: more govt. regulation?/cactus fruit beer


Ed Steinkamp suggested that more government regulation may be in order to 
ensure that beer styles are accurately labelled.  Although I understand 
how frustrating it is to buy a micro-priced 6 pack and get bad beer, I 
don't see how increasing government involvement will help things.  Just 
stop buying it, and eventually it will go away.  As it is, here in Texas 
Sam Adams cannot legally sell their Cream Stout because its alcohol 
content is too high for the state-defined limits of a "stout". This is a 
ridiculous law that is keeping good beer (IMO) out of Texas, but 
unfortunately it's a typical side effect of government regulation. 
 
If we were to change the law to instead require that in order to be 
labelled a "stout", the grain bill must contain at least 10% roasted 
unmalted barley, that is no improvement.  Creativity will be stifled even 
more, and brewers will be scared away from the business by ATF officers 
looking at their recipes with guns drawn.  Don't worry:  Samuel Adams is 
not going to have any more luck convincing us that their Summer Ale is a 
Belgian Wit than Bass will have convincing us that their beer is an IPA. 
And spending seven bucks every now and then to find out the hard way is 
worth it when you consider the creativity in beer that we have in America. 
 
Whew.  Now for a homebrew question.  I have recently picked about 20 
pounds of ripe prickly pears (cactus fruits) and am ready to brew my 
second annual prickly pear beer.  Has anyone else out there tried a beer 
with these?  If so, I'd be curious to compare notes.  Private e-mail is 
fine.

Subject: KJ's Killer Chiller


I've posted a ZIP file containing four GIF illustrations that clearly 
describe KJ's novel immersion chiller.  The direct FTP URL is: 
 
ftp://members.aol.com/kennyeddy/immersion/chillergif.zip 
 
Download it, unzip it, and use a GIF viewer to view the four illustrations. 
 
Basically it's four flat spirals which receive water simultaneously; thus a 
larger volume of colder water passes through the chiller in a given time 
interval, chilling faster.  The four flat spirals are at different heights, 
so each coil is responsible for a smaller portion of the wort.  Water usage 
would not necessarily be reduced, but it shouldn't be much greater, since 
you're using more gallons per minute but for fewer minutes. 
 
As for bobbing it up and down, would there be adequate convection in this 
layout to reduce the need for mechanical agitation?  Charlie S?  AJ?

Subject: Re: Dateline and Gov't Brewing


Ed Steinkamp says: 
"Perhaps some Government regulation is in order.  If a brewery, big 
or small, says their beer is a wheat beer it should have a certain 
percentage of wheat in it.  If somebody wants to sell an IPA, it 
should not be a budmillercoors with brown food coloring in it. 
Think about it, when you buy an apple pie, the law says that there 
has to be some apples in it.  Of course the law would have to be 
written so that it would not stifle creativity. Additionally, it 
could include a provision that ensures a pint of beer in a bar is 
actually a pint of beer, kill two birds with one stone.  I'm not 
a fan of big government, but I also don't like lousy beer.  I 
really don't like buying something that looks like a mirco-beer 
with a fancy label which promises a craft beer, but actually turn 
out to be budmillercoors crap. " 
 
As a government employee (at both the state and federal levels) 
my reply would have to be a resounding NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!  If you want to 
encourage the brewing of good beer DO NOT let the government, at any level 
have any more control over it. It will soon cease to be a craft. If you don't  
want to 
buy a budmilloors in a fancy label, DONT BUY IT.  If you get fooled (heck, 
that's a 
marketer's job), remember what you drank and spread the word.  A good word of 
mouth 
campaign will do much more to improve the quality of commercially brewed beer 
than 
any government regulation. 
 
Remember, just a few years ago, microbreweries were few and far between and 
their 
distribution was regional at best. With the strong word of mouth campaign waged
by homebrewers and those who generally will not tolerate a budmilloor, the 
trade
is growing in popularity, diversity and quality.  A few years ago, the 
megabreweries had such 
a tight hold on the beer market, that they could produce anything they wanted, 
slap a label, 
or some aluminum, around it and off to the grocery store it went. 
 
Now, with the ever increasing popularity of homebrewing, the growth of many of 
Americas micro 
breweries, the increasing number of brew-pubs (end even the Internet, where 
people like us can 
gather), the megas are suddenly on the run.  Why else would you see a report 
like the one that 
aired last Sunday? Why else would the "big guys" even be considering trying to 
brew out of 
"independent microbreweries"? 
 
Could it be that we are winning the war for good beer? 
 
Sorry if anybody thinks I wasted their time (or space).  I have two purposes 
for being here ... 
to brew better beer and to keep Uncle Sam away from my keg.  Ed's comment 
seemed to touch 
on both.  Thanks for listening.

Subject: Source of O2


 
 
Since we're in the middle of this oxygenation discussion, I have a question. 
 While browsing the local hardware store for neat stuff I can use in 
brewing, I noticed disposable canisters of oxygen (for use in welding, 
similar to the canisters of propane for soldering/cooking).  The canisters 
contain 1.4 ounces, I believe.  I didn't catch the cost per.  Has anyone 
considered this as source of (hopefully) cheap and easily available O2?  How 
many batches could this reasonably expect to cover?  The top appears 
threaded, like the propane canisters, so some sort of attachment could be 
connected to a piece of tubing.

- -- [ From: Werner, Scott * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] -- 
 
To the collective homebrewers in the Colorado area, I am in need of some 
help with recipe formulation suggestions.  The beer in question is Fat tire 
Amber Ale produced by the New Belgium Brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado. 
Unfortunately it is not distributed in the Texas region at this time, 
fortunately however I managed to find a clone recipe for it off of a website 
(http://www2.csn.net/~vsabbe/rmh_beer_page.html). 
 
Now the main question... any suggestions, comments, anybody out there tried 
successfully to reproduce Fat Tire? 
 
Ingredients: 
 
3.3 lbs light liquid malt 
3 lbs Extra-light Laaglanders dry malt 
1 lb dry Wheat malt 
1 lb. 30L Crystal malt 
1 oz. Cascade hops (6 HBUs) (60 minute boil) 
1/2 oz. Tettnang hops (15 minute boil) 
1/2 oz. Tettnang hops (5 minute boil)

Subject: Wort oxygenation


I have read the postings recently about oxygenation of wort and have read 
the BT article.  What I wonder is how well simply pouring the wort back and 
forth between buckets aerates the wort?  I think I read in HBD some time 
back that this was a pretty effective method but I don't know how it 
compares to other methods.  I have been doing it with no problems but have 
no way of knowing what my DO levels are.  Has anyone tried this and measured 
the resulting DO levels?  I realize it is more dangerous from an infection 
standpoint but would seem to be no more so than shaking, at least not with 
the same levels of aeration. 
Also, if pouring cooled wort onto the sediment of a previous batch, should 
the wort be aerated as vigorously or at all?  With the high volume of yeast 
it would seem further multiplication would be unnecessary or even undesirable 
but would aeration be necessary for the health of the yeast? 
 
Thanks,

I did my first all grain batch last night, everything went

1/8 # munich 
1/8 # black 
1/2 # crystal 
6 # pale 2-row 
 
mashed w/approx 2 gal `at` approx 155 for approx 1 hr. 
 
add hops boil 1 hr blah blah blah... 
 
O.G. 1.062 
 
about 2.5 gal of final wort. 
 
I have some questions : 
 
How does unconverted starch effect hydrometer reading, does it read 
as sugar or not ? 
 
When you do an iodine test and there is still unconverted starch 
is it really obvious or subtle when it turns black ? 
 
 
thankyou beery much

Subject: Stout Recipe Again?


Whoops the Irish Chocolate Stout recipe in HBD2232 that I was asking 
about which was based partly on Mocha Java Stout in the Cats Meow 
originally had 3 scoops of coffee to make 12 oz. of drip coffee added to 
the wort just after the boil.  Maybe I inadvertantly left it off the 
stout recipe because my question is will it have any affect on the 
flavor with 1# crystal, 1# chocolate, 1/4# black, 1/2# roasted barley, 
and 1/4# cocoa?  Should I use more coffee in this stout or should I just 
skip it because I have so much flavor already? TIA.

This is taken from the Real Beer Page E-mail newsletter: 
 
A REAL BEER STORY 
Two years ago this brewer rode out to the GABF 400 miles on his 
motorcycle. He's paid out of his own pocket to enter his beers into 
competitions, because the owners of the brewpub don't value or 
understand the brewing aspect of the business. When Rob Moline of 
Manhattan, Kansas' Little Apple Brewing Company called back to the 
restaurant to inform them that he won a Gold Medal for best 
barleywine in the U.S., he was told, "That's Groovey." Well, we love 
this guy, his beer and his triumph against-all-odds attitude, so we've 
created a little page for you to get to know him a little better. Help us 
congratulate Rob Moline by surfing to: 
 
          http://realbeer.com/travels/lilapple 
 
I've been blessed with the opportunity to try his "Big 12" and I must say, 
it's the best Barleywine in the land. Way to go Rob - We love you man!!
