Subject: Sabco full mash product advise please?


I've brewed extract beer now for two years and now I want to upgrade to 
all grain brewing.  I like the look of the Sabco converted keg but would 
like some advise before buying from homebrewer's with experience using 
it. 
 
How well does the Sabco full mash package (converted keg with false 
bottom, valve, thermometer, etc about $300) work?  Is anyone using it to 
mash and then to boil after removing the spent grains?  If so do you 
leave in the false bottom and will this effectively filter out the hops 
(whole or pellet)? 
 
Would I be better off with a Gott cooler mash tun system than mashing in 
the converted keg??? 
 
Thanks,

Subject: Effect of clorine on taste


 
If I add tap water which is high in clorine to the cooled wort, what 
detrimental effect will this have on the flavour of the beer. 
 
Are there any techniques for removing clorine which don't involve boiling? 
For example, during summer we are constantly fighting sunlight 
which removes the clorine from the pool - can I use this to my advantage 
and simply put water in a open carboy and leave it in the sun for a couple 
of days? 
 
TIA

I said:

Well, I lied. I just cannot let go of this one, especially when I read 
such puerile rubbish as written by Jethro Gump (yes, that is his real 
name). 
 
jethro sez:

Ballyhoo and Balderdash! 
After much research, I have discovered that all of the world's plastic 
fermenters are made in Taiwan. Yes they are turned on a lathe, but it 
turns out that the *direction* is such that bacteria never settles in 
the grooves in the plastic surface in the Southern Hemisphere due to the 
Coriolis force causing the bacteria to settle in the *opposite* 
direction to the grooves. Hence, beer made in Australia in plastic will 
be infection free, but in the USA is guaranteed to be infected! 
 
Fortunately for our US readers, there is a simple cure for this. As 
nobody plays vinyl records any more, go get your old turntable out of 
the garage. It rotates clockwise, against the coriolis force in the 
Northern Hemisphere. If you put your plastic fermenter on the turntable 
(don't forget to turn it on), this will simulate a fermentation in the 
Southern Hemisphere, giving you a good, infection free fermentation. 
 
As for the oxidation risk, there is indeed less oxygen in Australia to 
permeate through the fementer walls (except Melbourne, granted). This is 
not due to a lack of cars and trees, but due to the incredible heat. 
Everybody should know about the effects of hot air...Again, there is a 
simple solution for this. Just ferment at 40C plus to reduce the 
oxidation risk. 
 
So Jethro, keep your redneck theories off the HBD, and just stick to 
making bloody gold medal winning barleywine.

Subject: Plastic -vs- glass


Sometimes I primary in plastic, sometimes glass, but I usually 
rack to glass.  I mostly go by convenience more than anything 
else, I have a 10 gal plastic fermenter, and three 5 gal glass 
carboys. If I tie up two of the carboys in primary and then brew 
another  batch when it's time to rack, I run out of containers. 
 
As far as breaking things go, I've only broken one carboy, but it 
was full of beer.  I slid an empty one up next to the full  one. 
They touched ever so sligthly and whoosh, beer and glass all over 
my feet. Bummer.  I waited for the beer to wash  away from the 
glass and started sucking it up, but I couldn't drink all of it. 
Wasted about a gallon I think <burp>. 
 
My question is why is the permeability of the plastic important? 
How does the air get in when the pressure in the fermenter is 
higher than that of the ambient air?

I understand and agree that Prohibition didn't do us [homebrewers] any 
favors, but I feel that MARKETING in the brewing industry has done far 
more damage to the American consumers than the government has. I agree 
with Ed Steinkamp's opinion on this one, and there's LOTS of POSITIVE 
examples of goverment regulation in the beer/wine/liquor industry. For 
example, industry regulation ensures that a novice appreciator of fine 
spirits won't get ripped off when they buy a $30 bottle of Scotch. 
Germany has their Reinheitsgebot for beer and France makes sure that a 
bottle of sparkling grape juice doesn't get labeled as Champagne unless 
it's from that region. Indeed, breweries and vinards can (and do) 
leverage off of these regulations to promote the quality of their 
products. 
 
This is all in the name of protecting the consumer (myself included), 
which, IMHO can't always tell the difference between marketing BS and the 
"real thing." 
 
Steve, you do have a good point about contacting the manufacturers, but 
there is no "arsenal of weapons to combat fraud" in the beer marketplace 
that I'm aware of, unless Consumer Reports now has a beer section. :) 
Writing a letter to the brewery isn't going to change their mind while 
their making money off of folks who don't know better. 
 
Anyway, I'll drink my homebrew most of the time and stick to buying local 
brands I know brew a quality product when I do buy. I think those who 
read HBD are educated enough to avoid copycat products, so maybe therein 
lies a solution: educate those around us about quality beers. 
 
Brew On....

Don't worry, Jorge. No one will get sick off your beer, unless they drink 
too much! :) 
It's not possible for pathogens to grow in beer. I think the reason is 
the pH of beer is too low. Do we have anyone with facts and figures in 
the house?

Personally, I prefer a product called Idophor, an iodine-based cleaner 
used by insitutions and restaurants to clean glassware. I can't remember 
the brand name off hand, but your brewing supply store should carry it. 
It's slightly more expensive than bleach, but the contact time is less 
and there's no question of "did I rinse it enough" since you don't rinse 
at all. A strange flavor could result in your mead if you don't rinse 
THOROUGHLY after using bleach.

I used 3/8" because I couldn't get fittings for 1/4" tubing to a 5/8" 
garden hose connection. Note that the smaller the tubing = quicker 
cooling, but you run up against the law of deminishing returns: smaller 
tubing = more backpressure = low throughput. Someone on the 'net has 
plans for a chiller if you want them (search the HBD archives), but I 
just went to Home Depot and bought a roll of 'fridge tubing and 
compression fittings for $20. I wrapped the tubing around a 1 gallon 
glass jug to make a coil. Take care not to crimp the tubing, though. It's 
a real problem on the smaller tubing sizes, esp. 1/4". 
 
Have fun...

Subject: RE: traveling beer


 
There's been some discussion of bringing your beer on planes lately. I've 
got three points: 
 
1) SEARCH THE ARCHIVES! This discussion seems to come up every couple of 
months or so. Learn from those who came before you... 
 
2) Wrap it up. Put your bottles (or whatever vessle you choose) in 
garbage bags. I understand the fluctuations in cabin pressure can cause 
weak bottles to break or loose caps to come off. If you do search the 
archives, you may see a story where someone put their unwrapped beers in 
an overhead compartment. Later, during the flight, the person sitting 
under the beer got a shower... 
 
3) You may need to prove that the contents of those suspicious looking, 
unlabeled bottles is actually beer. Another archives story: An overseas 
traveler was accused of trying to smuggle Molatov cocktails onto the 
plane, and needed to drink a randomly selected bottle to prove it was 
really homebrew.

Mark, you may want to try a partial mash first. This will give you a good 
idea of the work involved and the techniques used before you have to go 
live. 
 
Another text you may want to look at is "The Complete Handbook of Home 
Brewing" by Dave Miller, ISBN 0-88266-517-0. It covers brewing in a more 
technical light, and is based on all-grain (full and partial) brewing 
rather than extract brewing.

Jack, you make some good points and I am happy to accept your admonition 
that there is no harm caused by all the extra stirring of the mash, but I 
don't accept your analysis that I am trying to hit a nail with a 
screwdriver. I really like being able to store just one piece of versatile 
equipment rather than adding another bulky thing to my collection. 
 
Accepting that, then I'm sure you would agree that adding insulation to 
the kettle is a rational and useful enhancement of the system. To 
accomplish this, I've acquired some fiberglass water heater insulation. 
I'm cutting it to size, sealing the open edges, and adding some velcro so 
that the insulation can be easily applied or removed. I anticipate this 
will be a simple and effective solution. 
 
Depending on the results of a heat-resistance test, I may even leave the 
insulation on during the boil. I've been having trouble maintaining a 
six-gallon rolling boil on my range without a rather precise positioning 
of my kettle lid (which, to complicate matters, likes to shift around) . A 
propane burner is overkill and impractical in my apartment, but 
insulation may allow me to ditch to lid. 
 
So, as you can see, I am pursuing rational solutions for my particular 
situation.

I found an inexpensive digital meat-probe type of thermometer at my local 
Lechter's Housewares which is very fast and accurate. Maybe it told me 
more than I should know, because I discovered that almost constant 
attention is required to keep the mash temperature correct and even. 
 
The temp differential between the center and sides of the mash in an 
uninsulated SS kettle can easily be several degrees. Stirring accelerates 
the heat loss, and adding heat tends necessitates yet more stirring to 
even out the temp. In light of this, the issue of control can be rather 
theoretical. A mechanized stirring solution such as yours certainly 
simplifies matters, as does a few dollars worth of boiler insulation and 
velcro

Subject: Low Gravities


Here's my problem: 
 
I consistently get low gravity worts. I mean...lower than I expect. I'm not a  
grain brewer yet, but I do some partial mash stuff and use lots of adjuncts / 
specialty grains.  But, even with an extract brew, I would expect my gravities 
to be higher than they come out.  I've even brought my hydrometer to work to 
calibrate it in the chemistry lab, and it's right on! 
 
For example, I brewed a recent batch with 6# light malt syrup and 1# crystal. 
I had also tried to mash 3# pumpkin with 1# Pale Ale malt, but I don't think I 
got good extraction.  Even so, with a tiny bit of efficiency from the pale ale 
(I had good conversion temps in the mash), and a pound of crystal and 6# of 
extract in a five gallon batch, I would have expected a gravity near 50.  I 
boiled for an hour in 3 gallons, cooled to 70 degrees, racked off the trub to 
enough water to make 5 gallons - O.G. of 36.  Not even close! 
 
Am I losing gravity by only boiling in 3 gallons?  Is my sugar getting 
irretreivably lost in the trub?  If I were to boil the full 5 gallons, my trub 
would be lower in gravity, right?  Thereby increasing the gravity of the wort? 
Am I on the right track?

I've been following the thread about "government intervention" in 
regulating beer styles, and I agree with those folks that say "no way!". If 
you want an example of what that's like, take the asinine law that says 
beer is "beer" at one alcohol level, "ale" at another, and "malt liquor" at 
yet another here in California and some other states (an attempt at repeal 
in CA was recently defeated). That should tell you as well as anything how 
much Big Brother knows about beer...*not*!

First, an update on the mashed-in-punkin brew. 
 
Things went relatively well, actually: 
 
The Recipe- 
1 large (3 Gallon) Punkin 
5#s Pale Malt 
1#s Special B Malt 
1#s Crystal Malt 
1/4 cup Chocolate Malt 
15ozs Libbys Canned Pumkin 
1oz Cascades 
1/4oz Hallertaur 
Nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, clove, allspice, vanilla per your favorite pie 
recipe Irish Moss 
1.5#s DME 
 
The Process- 
 
Boiled up 3 gallons water.  Cleaned out punkin.  Poured the boiling water (pay 
attention Murphy) into the punkin and steeped the insides for about 30 min. 
 
Drained the punkin (via my aforementioned EM knockoff) and used 2 gals to 
preboil the canned pumpkin.  Mashed into the crushed malts inside the punkin 
at 150F.  After about 30 mins, I had to decoct back up to 150 F from 135F. 
After another 30 mins, the punkin sprang a small leak in the bottom (Hello 
Murphy, what took ya so long?).  I was able to collect the leakage and add to 
the boil pot.  I sparged with 1.5 gallons 170F water and collected in the boil 
pot.  60 minute boil with Cascades at start, IM, spices, and Hallertaur at 15 
minutes left. (I added 1.5#s of DME at beginning of boil, and steeped 
specialtygrains) OG- 1.050 
Pitched a 1056 starter and got activity at about 6 hours. 
 
The sparge went pretty well.  The runnings were deep orange turning to light 
orange as the sparge neared completion. 
 
The hydrometer tasting went well, too, although I couldn't get anyone else to 
try a sip. 
 
I'll update around Turkey Day when I plan to sample my first bottle. 
 
Greg (whatta) Guy- What does Robert Koerner say in his book about the relative 
Oxygen permeability of Polycarbonate?  I usually clear my beers in a square 
PC carboy for about a week. 
 
Mr Gump made some excellent points about the treatment of plastic goods in 
The Land Down Under.  His observation about the lower O2 content, while 
accurate, was credited to the wrong reasons.  Where do you think all the 
CO2 from our northern brewing, purging and breathing goes?  We all know 
CO2 is heavier than O2, right?  Well, all our generated CO2 goes Down 
Under, and displaces more of their O2 back up to us.  Thanks, Mates, 
and don't forget to oxygenate 20% longer than we do, Eh?

Subject: Glass vs. Plastic/Aeration


It has been claimed that: 
 
1)  Plastic carboys are more permeable to oxygen than glass and as a result 
will make bad beer.  (BTW, I'm a glass snob) 
 
and 
 
2)  You need to buy an oxygen tank in order to provide sufficient 
oxygentation.  (I use an air-sucking racking cane) 
 
        The problem with the first claim is that nobody has ever really 
PROVEN how much oxygen is too much.  Its a straight forward matter to 
calculate rates of permeation and total oxygen permeated at any given time 
- - but how much is too much?  Data from the plastic fans indicate that it 
might be alot higher than many of us think, or the polycarbonate bottles 
are alot less permeable than we think. 
 
        On the second claim, intial gravity, aeration and quantity of yeast 
pitched interact - if I pitch ~250 ml of yeast slurry that I get from a 
local micro (BarrelHouse Brewing Co. - great beers!) and aerate with my 
low-tech aerator I get fast starts and good finishes for an IPA.  OTOH, I 
didn't expect that to be sufficient for the 1.094 doppelbock I made last 
month.  So I point out that "optimum" aeration is an undefined term.  I 
won't argue that pure oxygen gives you *higher* DO levels, but is it 
necessarily *better*? 
 
Waiting for data to prove something.

Subject: Killer Chiller Comments


David Hill sez: 
 
"KennyEddy argues when discussing the killer chiller 
that several flat spirals mounted horizontaly 
 one above the other in the wort 
chill better because they overcome the problem of 
temperature gradients forming in wort chilled with one 
horizontal spiral and no agitation. " 
 
Hmm...I don't remember saying that...my apologies if I wasn't clear or if my 
memory is failing me (wouldn't be the first time either way)... 
 
Actually I simply *asked* if this configuration would be better from a 
convection standpoint, and I was making a comparison to the "standard" 
*vertical-coil* (spring-shaped) immersion chiller where any convection of 
cooler wort is mostly down the sides (along the coils).  One of your 
countrymen -- a well-known thermodynamicist who recently unsubscribed this 
digest (and will be missed, dammit) -- responded to me via private e-mail 
that he felt that agitation would probably not be necessary. 
 
A single flat spiral should chill the wort "more evenly" since the cooler 
wort is more evenly distributed across the diameter of the brewpot rather 
than being concentrated at the edges.  Four flat spirals then should be 
better than one since the cooler wort "falling" from each coil is *further* 
cooled by the one below it (alignment effects notwithstanding) -- remember 
that each coil contains a "fresh" supply of cold water, whereas successive 
coils of a vertical-coil chiller contain increasingly warm water.

Subject: Whooops....IPA


It was a beautiful weekend here in Wisconsin, and I took advantage of the 
weather to brew an American Pale Ale.  While the beer was boiling in the 
vollrath on the cajun cooker on the back patio, I went to the front and raked 
the leaves.  At the end of the session, after my immersion cooler had done 
it's job, I racked the wort into my primary, planning on leaving the hops and 
hot and cold break behind.  As the kettle emptied, I noticed that an oak leaf 
had found its way into the brew kettle!  How long it had boiled, I don't know, 
but it had boiled, as I always cool with a cover on.  So..... 
Is this now an IPA? 
Am I about to find the real meaning of the word tannin? 
IMBR? 
Anyone with experience in the addition of leaves, let me know. 
 
thanks.

Subject: RE:Carbonator caps


I have been using these for a while, and have found that the best way to 
go about thyis carbonating business is to: 1)chill out! Get the liquid 
very cold, but slushy is not necessary, 2)Get gassed! Overshoot the 
desired CO2 level by cranking up those psi. (Warning: Don't blow you 
head, hand, or curious friends up.  I find that the 40 psi max they state 
is quite adequate.  Any more CO2 and I would suspect you're wanting to 
enter a belching contest.), 3)Shake it, no, stupid, I mean the brew. 
Shake the hell out of it, or until the bottle  gets soft. 4) Repeat 2 and 
3 until it can't take any more co2, 5) Relax..., 6)Take it off, after a 
wait (about the time of one homebrew) you can unscrew the cap and have 
minimal loss.  Just put the regular cap on and this should be plenty 
fizzy till its gone.  I love these things!

I brew all grain batches and bring the wort up to boiling for 15 minutes before
I start the 60 minute clock. Before the first hop addition, I will scoop out 
the brown scum that develops around the side of my brew pot. Is this a smart

Subject: Using corny kegs as fermenters


Hi all, 
 
While reading the great debate between plastic and glass 
fermentation vessels, I became curious what the collective thought 
about fermenting in corny kegs.  I use corny kegs for both primary 
and secondary fermentation, as well as serving as you might have 
guessed.  I hook up a blowoff tube by removing the gas intet valve 
and sliding a piece of plastic tubing over the post.  I have not 
experienced any problems but I was wondering if anyone else used 
this same method or if anyone knew of any problems with using cornys 
in this way.

I just made my first mead.  Does it matter what the OG is?  I got

Do people rack meads to a secondary fermenter? 
 
Not knowing what yeast to use, I used a Lalvin wine yeast.  should

Subject: CO2 tank,  split mash


Greetings All, 
 
Someone please slap me if this is silly... 
I noticed this weekend that my fire extinguisher is empty. 
Then it hit me (an idea, not the extinguisher),  could a 
regulator be screwed into the top of this thing, which could be 
filled with 2.5 lbs of CO2?  The label says the limit is 300 psi. 
Has anyone tried this?  It used to be filled with a special 
chemical. I assume that would have to be cleaned out somehow. 
 
The following question was posted a while back, but with zero 
responses I figured I'd try again... 
If a mash tun will not hold all the necessary 
grain for a batch, would it be ok to split the mash/sparge operation? 
Ok, it would take hours longer; but someone with a 5 gallon Gott 
could brew a barleywine.  Is there any reason not to collect/sparge 
the first half, and let it sit quietly in the unheated, covered brew 
kettle until the second half is added later?  I recently collected 
data from folks about the limitations of their mash tun, and this idea 
might help alot of brewers.  Has anyone done this?

Question:  If 4oz dextrose/5 Gallons is a good carbonation level for 12 oz 
bottles, what's a good priming level for 22 oz. bottles?  I keep reading about 
exploding 22oz. bottles and about the carbonation differences in larger 
bottles/kegs, etc.  So how much should one decrease the priming amount for 
22oz bottles vs. 12 oz? 
 
Becks:     I am learning more about beer because of homebrewing and the HBD. 
Now that I know what light struck/skunked beer smells like, i.e. Heineken.  I 
had a Beck's Dark this weekend and it had a slightly skunked smell.  I used to 
really like Beck's dark.  Am I getting pickier?  Is Beck's dark lightly 
skunked deliberately?  Is it just the green bottle that might have been 
sitting on a shelf long enough to get skunked? 
 
Guiness:   About 16 or 17 years ago a college friend who had stayed in England 
for the summer had me try his favorite beer, Guiness Stout.  He was very 
disappointed that it didn't taste like the Guiness he had in England.   I 
couldn't drink the whole thing the first time and even though I drink it 
occasionally now I think I prefer a smoother Irish Stout like Murphy's.  At 
any rate, after reading so much about Guiness and how different the draft 
version is, I finally had Guiness Stout on draft at Rose & Crown Pub in Lewes, 
Delaware and I'm glad I did.  It had a creamy head that stayed with it and was 
smoother and certainly less alcoholic than the bottled version.  Very 
different and distinctive.  Sorry for the BW, hope someone else had a similar 
experience with their first Guiness Stout draft and can relate.

You are mistaken.  The thread was started because Dave Burley claimed 
that one brewer's infection problems were most likely caused by his 
using glass carboys and Charlie Papazian's blowoff method of 
fermentation.  Dave asserted that the difficulty of cleaning the 
carboy was the source of the infection. 
 
I posted a rebuttal claiming that Dave was the first to post that 
plastic fermenters are easier to sanitize than glass and that this 
statment is "baloney."  I also put in an auxilliary comment saying 
that lagering in plastic is likely to cause oxidation of alcohols 
into aldehydes.  Suddenly, the HBD was filled with more than a 
half dozen posts from Australia and elsewhere making all kinds of 
claims in defense of plastic fermenters. 
 
There were claims that because water vapour does not pass readily 
thorugh HDPE that oxygen would not either.  This is incorrect.  The 
permeability of a plastic for one gas is not related to the 
permeability of another.  For example (from the Cole-Parmer catalog, 
plastics physical properties table), LDPE has a permeability of 60 
for O2 and 280 for CO2 (units throughout this post will be 
((cc-m)/sec-cm^2-cm Hg))*10^-10) where as for nylon, O2 is 1.0 
whereas CO2 is 1.8. 
 
There was a claim that polycarbonate was less permeable than HDPE 
because it has a "tighter molecular structure" or somesuch.  Wrong 
again:  O2 for HDPE is 10 whereas O2 for PC is 20. 
 
Then there was the assertion that since the beer is saturated with 
CO2, that O2 would not dissolve in it.  Absolutely wrong!  That's 
simply not how gasses work. 
 
Then someone said that HDPE must be O2-barrier because any food or 
milk that we got in HDPE would be oxidized.  Guess what?  It is. 
 
When I opened my HB supply store, O2-barrier packaging was almost 
impossible to find, certainly among homebrew supply distributors (now 
they have it).  I searched high and low and finally found two types 
of plastic that were made specifially to be oxygen barrier.  One week 
in 2mil HDPE was equivalent to 2.5 years in the plastic I had found. 
This was for hop storage, incidentally.  The other plastic I found 
that was O2-barrier (and I use for whole hops) is made for the meat 
packaging industry! 
 
After all this, I would like to point out that it is the seal on the 
plastic fermenters that is suspect and not the oxygen permeability of 
the actual walls of the fermenter.  They are indeed more permeable 
than glass, but at the thickness of the plastic (probably a hundred 
times that of a plastic bag) the permeability through the walls is 
not really an issue.  Only two of the five HDPE fermenters that I 
have downstairs have gasketted lids.  The others just press-on. 
 
I never meant for this to become such a battle and I don't have any 
bad feelings for anyone who posted rebuttals to my post.  Again, 
please recall that I was defending glass, which (in my mind) is 
inferior to plastic in price and durability. 
 
*** 
I'm just now getting used to using Pegasus mail and lost the text of 
one poster who posted that A-B uses sterile air to scrub hot wort. 
This was in their "Beer University" or whatever they call it. 
 
The fact is that A-B uses NITROGEN and not AIR to scrub DMS out of 
their hot wort.  I guess that to the people that put together the 
class, "nitrogen gas" sounded too scary and they figured that since 
air is 79% nitrogen, it's okay to substitute "air" for "nitrogen" in 
their lecture.  A-B's class may have been entertaining, but it was far 
from accurate.
