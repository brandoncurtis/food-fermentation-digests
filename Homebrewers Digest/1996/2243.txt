John, can you taste or smell the chlorine at that concentration? I believe 
the threshold for detection by humans is generally considered closer to 7 
ppm. We have a public water supply due to the nature of the facility I 
manage, and the requirement is to keep at or above 1 ppm free chlorine, 
suggested between 1 and 4 ppm. 
 
The county inspector made the comment to me last week during our annual 
inspection that if you can smell chlorine in the water supply, you should 
add more chlorine to the water to kill it. This sounds backwards, but his 
explanation was that the chlorine that produces the smell is combined 
chlorine. Free chlorine will chemically neutralize combined chlorines and 
the odor. Just how is getting out of my area of knowledge. 
 
At any rate, I keep our *free* chlorine level at about 4 ppm most of the 
time, and though I feel that my palate and sense of smell are fairly 
sensitive, I don't smell or taste chlorine at that level. At higher levels, 
the smell is especially evident in the shower. 
 
Apparently you have chloramines rather than chlorine in your water. Because 
the chlorine is bonded to other substances, it is far less volatile than 
normal free chlorine ... won't boil out or evaporate. Will carbon filters 
remove it adequately?

Subject: Length of mash, length of boil


Over the weekend I brewed up my first ten gallon batch and now I have a couple 
of questions.
 
1) The mash didn't take as long as the book I was using said it would. There 
was no starch left after 1:15 instead of
the 2:30 the book called for.  Will this mean less yeild? 
 
2) I lost count on the number of gallons of run off and only put about 11 on 
the pot to boil. After the boil this left only
about 8 gallons of wort. Should I, or could I have diluted it to get back to 10
gallons?
 
Thanks

some folks have been talking about carbonators recently: 
 
i make caps for force carbonate beer with tire valve stems. just cut a hole 
in the bottle cap and push the stem through. i smear silicon caulk on the 
seal. they cost $.25 ea., so you can have a bunch of them, and if you loose 
one, no big deal. of course you will need an air-chuck in your co2 line, and 
mine leaks. :( 
 
i like 2 litre soda bottles for odd-sipping beer. after you pour off some 
beer, you can squeeze the sides of the bottle, screw the cap on, and fill 
the headspace with co2.

Subject: No Trub No Ferment/Uncle - NO make that Big Brother Sam


 
Just catching up on some past topics. 
 
Trub - 
 
Bryan Glos described the BT reader's letter regarding 80 
non-fermenting batches supposedly due to racking chilled wort off cold 
trub before pitching. I was amazed at this letter too.  I've alway 
chilled lager wort to near freezing and racked off the trub before 
pitching and have never had a fermentation problem using this method. 
It's pretty clear something else is wrong. 
 
In theory the yeast can create lipids for their cell walls by 
synthesis if oxygen is present, or by utilizing lipids in the trub 
with or without oxygen.  Lipids are a known limiting factor on yaest 
growth in wort.  This might explain slow fermentation in an 
unoxygenated wort, but non the non-fermentation described.

Hmm, I'm not aware of such positive regulation except as regards 
content safety.  If you want counter examples consider what 
prohibition did to American commercial beer.  Consider that the 
British beer taxation system effectively destroyed the IPA style and 
other high gravity styles in Britain.  Also consider that the original 
drink of Scotland was a dark ale that was entirely eliminated when 
britain imposed taxation that was not so easily paid in the more rural 
and poorer Scotland.  Consider what US taxation (circa 1790) did to 
the US whiskey business and practice. 
 
>example, industry regulation ensures that a novice appreciator of fine 
>spirits won't get ripped off when they buy a $30 bottle of Scotch. 
 
Wrong - this is total BS.  You can easily find $30 and even $250 dollar 
bottles of single malt(SM) scotch whisky which aren't nearly worth the 
price.  Take Cardhu for example.  This whisky has an an notably light 
and bland character and was only used in blended scotch until the US 
trade for Scotch took off a few years ago.  At that time they designed 
a fancy bottle and label and started shipping this stuff to the US. 
It costs around $40 and not worth $10 IMO. 
 
Take a look at Glenfiddich - you can get this SM scotch with a really 
fancy bottle and label for about $250+ a fifth, but there are quite a 
few SM scotchs for under $50 that I and any SMSW fans would much 
rather have. 
 
Point is you can get 'ripped off' in spite of regulation.  Fraud is a 
illegal, but poor quality never will be.  If the label says wheat beer 
and there is no wheat - you can take 'em to court.  It's your job as a 
consumer to understand the claims that are and are not being made for 
the product you buy. If the product doesn't meet those claims - then 
sure get the judiciary involved.  Or at least advertise the facts. 
 
OTOH - the label on 'Red Dog' never said "the best beer you'll ever 
taste".  It just said "beer" and the Ad copy even mentions that the 
beer isn't even red.  So what's your beef ?  Maybe someone else likes 
it. If you don't like the flavor or color don't buy it again. 
 
If your complaint is that that label doesn't show that brewery 
location, then my resoponse is - I don't care.  A beers quality isn't 
indicated by the point of manufacture.  Even such egregious gaffs as 
a 'Killians Red' from Colorado don't phase me.  I'm buying (or not 
buying) for taste, not geography.  [I do think it's amusing that a 
local bar menu places ballantine IPA in India tho!]. 
 
You're living in a dream world if you imagine that regulation made all 
Scotch whiskys taste good - or that regulation can make all beer taste 
good.  Only competition can coerce the quality up.

Reinheitsgebot is strictly about product purity not labelling and is 
overly restrictive by any reasonable modern measure.  it also 
illustrates the fact that once a law is passed (or decreed) it is 
never repealed until long after it has stopped making sense - and 
usually not until it becomes an overbearing detriment.  BTW I've 
tasted some really bad Czech beers that may well have passed 
Reinheitsgebot. 
 
The French do have labeling laws that require district and appellation 
still do not 'content label'.  You can by a bordeaux that has 100% 
merlot grape, or 100% cabernet sauvignon - and the label won't tell 
you.  The French also instituted a classification system for bordeaux 
in the middle 1800s, which now has some obvious errors. The label 
still doesn't indicate quality, only location and in some cases like 
champagne the method of production.  I can easily demonstrate 
overpriced poor quality champagne, as nearly half the champagnes 
reviewed in the 'Wine Specator' get mediocre to poor scores. 
Same for bordeaux - many great wines, and some real losers carry 
'Bordeaux' on the label. 
 
>This is all in the name of protecting the consumer (myself included),

Please god, save me from people and governments trying to protect me. 
 
If you can't tell a good beer from a bad one by tasting it, then drink 
any beer.  If you CAN tell the difference then just buy the good one - 
it's just that simple ?  This system of voting with dollars will show 
up as a lack of profits at the lousy brewers' shop and he will 
subsequently cease to brew.  It's just that easy - no further laws are 
required to make this simple and elegant system work.  It works just 
as well for A-B and Miller as it does for the local brewpub. 
 
>Steve, you do have a good point about contacting the manufacturers, but 
>there is no "arsenal of weapons to combat fraud" in the beer marketplace 
 
If there is fraud then contact the city or county prosecuter of your 
local area - it a criminal offense, but the damages are a civil 
offense.  I'd consider this a pretty good weapon.  Maybe A-Bs lawyers 
would help you out. I've heard of fraud cases being brought over some 
pretty minor things - especially by a prosecutor anxious to get 
re-elected.  Also if your sure of your fraud facts you can tell your 
friends and post it to HBD - further speading the knowledge of an 
unscrupulous practice that others can avoid. 
 
>that I'm aware of, unless Consumer Reports now has a beer section. :) 
 
Actually I believe that CR did taste test beers w/in the past year or 
so.  No joke.  Not that I'd trust their opinion over say a Michael 
Jackson book, or the 'Malt Advocate'. 
 
>Anyway, I'll drink my homebrew most of the time and stick to buying local 
>brands I know brew a quality product when I do buy. 
 
They why are you advocating laws ?  Most anyone with a tongue can tell 
good beer from bad, but the gov't has no tongue !

Subject: Yeast Pitching


Hello - 
 I recently posted a question about dry-pitching (why not?) vs. liquid 
stuff, and got a few answers which boiled down to 1) the yeasties start 
munching quicker with liquid stuff, and 2) the yeasties produce better 
tasting beer with liquid stuff. I will conditionally agree with #2 
(until I can test my currently resting batches), but dry pitching, in my 
experience, has *always* been a fast starter. Of course, the fact that 
ambient temp was > 70 probably had something to do with it. 
 
 Well, to get to the point, I stepped up some liquid yeast, and got a 
nice ferment going on some extract. I then pitched the *malt* part of 
it, *not* the stuff on the bottom, thinking the active yeasties would be 
swimming around in the malt, with bone-tired yeasties resting on the 
bottom. But, I was glancing thru Dave Miller's brewing book tonight, and 
he mentions that you *dump* the "malt" stuff, and pitch the "trub". My 
stuff started just fine (within a few hours) ....so what should you 
pitch... the malt(liquid stuff) or the trub(junk cluttering up the 
bottom)? Where are the most prepared and psyched-up yeasties? 
 
Anticipation....

DON'T dump it. Been there, done that. |If you can lager it for a few weeks, 
most
of the scorched taste will go away. Probably won't go away completely, but the

        Current brewpub concern; FDA has an interest in copper and brass 
fittings in contact with acidic solutions, eg beer, and has recommended that 
such fittings be no longer used. States and municipalities may decide to 
issue their own restrictions, based on this recommendation. The feds may 
wish to enact their own ban, but currently it is just a "suggestion" from 
FDA. I heard of a law in California banning the use of such fittings 
beginning 1.1. 98 (?), but haven't yet verified this. I do expect this to 
soon be an FDA directive, so everyone in the draft sales business will have 
to buy stainless faucets. 
        Just today, received a phone request from the area ATF conducting a 
survey for another agency. I wouldn't be surprised if Bill uses this as a 
campaign tactic, "I saved the purity of your beer!," two days before the 
election! 
        But did learn from them that you can get exempted from Label 
Approval from ATF if you aren't selling interstate. Still have to do some 
forms though.

Subject: Plastic (Oh God not again etc.)


I think I must be really sad. I have been reading the posts on plastic versus 
glass before anything else. 
 
Does anyone actually have any proper data as opposed to dogma, personal 
feelings
etc? I think there are enough of us who would be interested to justify a post 
if
you have. 
 
I understand the objection to plastic's ability to be scratched very easily. 
But
when I look at my carefully cleaned (with a sponge-- seems to work without 
prolonged soaking in my brewery) buckets the surface looks very smooth/ shiny. 
When I look at most ss vessels (not mirror finish) the surface is matt. So if 
the scratches I might put into plastic harbour nasties why don't the 
irregularities on ss? 
 
Do you have different lid on your buckets in the US. Once I have fitted mine it
need a Herculean effort to get the buggers off. If I run liquid off through the
tap the lid buckles in and stays like that-- ie no air gets in. Some of them a 
a
real pain in the ass because they are nearly impossible to remove. 
 
So for now I will ferment in plastic although I am waiting for the arrival of a
carboy to use as a secondary. It will be interesting to see if there is an 
improvement in my beer.

Brewersand Mashers, 
 Haven't seen any posts on FWH in a while, thought I should start one! 
 I've had very good results using low AA hops such as imported Saaz 
or Hallertauer at around 2 or 3% for FWH, but now I want to use something 
with a little higher AA like Cascade or Fuggles in a Pale Ale I'm about to 
brew. 
 How will FWH affect my IBU's? If I want to have lots of 
aroma/flavor from my FWH, will the hops also contribute to my total IBU's 
significantly? How do I calculate this? Is there a FWH FAQ? 
 
TIA

Subject: Fermenting in plastic, SS etc.


The plastic vs. glass debate could have been boring for "old" HBDers which 
probably have seen it many times in the Digest, but it was interesting for a 
"new" like me. But I think I am missing a very basic point: why are scratches 
in the fermenter such a problem? Is it impossible to sanitize a scratched bin 
with a bleach solution? 
 
If you tell me it's impossible I think I'll have to buy a new fermenter, 
because my plastic one is old and probably scratched (actually its inner 
surface was not so smooth even when I bought it). Could I use it anyway as a 
"bottling bucket" when priming? 
 
And, last question: as I don't want to restart the glass/plastic battle, what 
about fermenting in Stainless Steel? 
(I use open fermentation and I don't brew lagers) 
SS seems rarely used by hbrewers, is that just a matter of costs?

I really don't want to get into the fire on this one over what 
goes on at the AHA/AOB, because it really is pointless to argue 
over what goes on their.  They have served as good instructional 
body and promoted the homebrewing (and craft brewing) trade very 
well in the past.  What I dislike is the lack of information with 
your posts.  There are complaints, but no facts around them. 
Please fill us in if you are aware of something nasty going on. 
 
Now as far as the latter part of your note, there are 
alternatives to the HBD.  There is the newsgroup 
rec.crafts.brewing with so much noise and other problems, it 
makes the AOB sponsered HBD look like the best game in town.  (I 
rarely go there anymore.) Being a long time reader of the HBD, I 
should point out that Rob Gardner went through LOTS of problems 
while going through his learning process of providing the HBD. 
There are also other discussion forums popping up on the 'net 
 
that are webbed based.  I've seen them on several sites (but can't 
locate the list at the moment) and have recently added one to The Brewery web 
site:
 
             http://alpha.rollanet.org/wwwboard 
 
I want to point out that this new discussion board is not really 
meant as a replacement, but if you dislike the current situation 
at the AHA/AOB, there is an alternative.

I just recently cut 3 kegs open with ease.  What I used was a Sawzall on 
the highest speed setting and a 4" tungsten carbide blade.  I used one 
blade per keg.  If waited for the blade to cool I might have been able to 
stretch the blades.  They broke at the base as soon as I started cutting 
into the second keg.   Using this setup I was able to cut all three tops in 
under 1/2 hour.  The tungsten carbide blades cut through the kegs very easily 
and smoothly.  The edges weren't that rough and were easily sanded down with 
a 60 grit drum pad on my dremel.

I've successfully used a hand-held disc grinder with a metal cutting 
disk.  This is not the benchtop grinder variety used for sharpening 
axes, but is the hand-held kind that is similar to a circular saw. I 
rented the grinder from a power-tools rental store for about $7/day 
and bought the disc for a buck and change.  It takes time and 
patience to slowly cut through the top of the keg, but I think it 
makes a nicer cut than drilling or sawing.  Plus you can use the 
grinder to smooth the edges of your cut after you've broken through. 
Gloves and goggles are highly recommended (hot metal sparks will fly) 
and ear plugs are imperitive (it is a HoRrEnDoUs sound). 
 
You can also use a saber saw with a metal cutting blade, but be 
prepared to go through multiple blades. I suppose you'd have to 
drill a starter hole first. Gloves, goggles, and ear plugs apply 
here, too.

Subject: Pumpkin Ale


Greetings Fellow Zymurgists: 
 
Going to be bottling my annual Pumpkin Ale tomorrow night and would like 
the collective comments from those more experienced than I.  This year I 
used fresh pumpkin in my recipe instead of canned pumpkin in other years. 
I've kept the pumpkin in my carboy for the last week during first stage 
blow-off period.  Was this a good thing?  I'm starting to have this 
sinking belief that I should have taken the pumpkin out after cooking. 
 
Secondly, is there really any difference in taste between fresh and canned 
pumpkin in the beer? 
 
Thanks in advance for any response. 
Todd in South Carolina.

I just sawed kegs about 1 month ago (and my hearing is just about where it 
was before I started sawing). 
 
I used a sawz all (sp?) with a bit that was made to cut cast iron. I cut 2 
tops off kegs and only used 2 of these blades (they were $4 a piece). The 
hole created by the sawz all then has to be ground and polished (unless of 
course you would like to have your arms sliced off by the jagged edges). I 
ground the edges with a bench grinder and pretty much ate up the fine 
grinding wheel. 
 
All in all the kegs came out fantastic and I spent about 1 1/2 hours on 
each keg. 
 
Tips: 
 
1. Fill keg 1/4 of the way with water before sawing and the bell tone will 
be reduced alot. 
 
2. Wear protective eye wear or plan on have sharp little pieces of 
stainless pierce your eyes. 
 
3. definitely wear some kind of hearing protection ( I have 30db pads, but 
I have also played guitar forever in front of stacks of amps, cotton will 
do nicely) 
 
4. remember that the steel is going to get very very hot so don't touch 
it... (My drunken neighbor learned this the hard way). 
 
Next step for me will be all the welding.... Looks like fun. 
 
Later,

Ian, 
I did this last year and had one hell of a time getting through it. I 
also first tried drilling, etc. It turned out that the best way to cut 
out the top with the tools we had was to mark off a circle on the top, 
drill a hole to start, and cut from there. Once you have the hole, it 
isn't so hard to "peel" the steel back as it is to just saw a hole all 
the way around. 
 
Now the odd thing for us was that I had access to my father-in-law's 
pneumatic somethingorother that was like an air hammer. It had a kind of 
a crow's foot attachment (like a crowbar, for example). I could fit the 
notch in said attachment into the hole I had drilled and just "hammer" 
my way around in a rough circle. This was not as hard as it sounds, but 
was *incredibly* loud. Wear earplugs if you try to beat on these kegs. 
 
After I had a rough hole, I went back with a 6" side grinder and shaped 
it up into what looks more like a circle. Total time was only about 30 
minutes per keg after we figured out what we were doing. 
 
I don't really recommend my method, because you probably don't have 
access to an air hammer. But I do hear that the Sawzall brand saws will 
do a nice job if you can get your hands on one.

Subject: Unwanted Goverment Intrusion


 
To all you dolts who whined about wanting more government regulation and 
intervention in the beer industry, try reading the following at: 
 
http://www.heritage.org/heritage/commentary/op-at1.html. 
 
I quote: 
 
" With the fall elections just weeks away, there's one issue far more 
important to many Americans than presidential debates, 
congressional mudslinging or the latest Gallup poll. It's beer. 
 
Specifically, the beer tax. This may come as a shock, but every time one of 
America's 75 million beer drinkers picks up a 
six-pack of his favorite brew, 43 percent of the cost comes directly from 
taxes, according to a study by the economic consulting 
firm DRI/McGraw-Hill. To put this in perspective, a $5 six-pack actually 
costs only $2.85 -- until you factor in the tax." 
 
 
43% of the cost of a 6-pack is for taxes!!!  Even if it was only 25% that 
would still be $1.25. So you wasted 5 or 6 bucks on a 6-pack of 
"microbrewed" swill? Don't buy it again, they'll be out of business soon 
enough. If you had that extra 43% in your pocket each time you purchased a 
6-pack how many more beers could you purchase and sample? Or suppose "Joe 
Sixpack" had the extra 43% in his pocket. Maybe he could afford to purchase 
an extra few bottles of really good microbrew, get used to it, and demand 
more of it. Every time the government sticks its nose into something in the 
private sector, where it doesn't belong in the first place, the price goes 
up. 
 
Just be thankful you don't get ALL the government you pay for.

After chilling and tranferring to the fermenter, I get this massive amount 
of trub coagulating in the fermenter.  (Usually within 1/2 to 1 hour after 
siphoning.)  Even this my latest batch, which was siphoned thru a grain bag 
with a choreboy wrapped around the siphon tube. 
 
What is the source of this?  Should I let the wort sit longer in the kettle 
before transferring?

Subject: Bashing and the AHA


Top of the morning to ye all, 
 
I think bashing is the incorrect term to be using about the AHA, AOB.  I 
think that a better term to use would be constructive criticisms.  If you 
think the AHA et al is without fault flame me personally.  Otherwise in 
my opinion the AHA, AOB was created by Charlie so he could afford his 
personal pub crawl about the world.  Karen knows nothing about 
homebrewing, homebrewers,  or beer.  I think that Karen need a few more 
courses on how to treat folks, how to respond to concerns of the 
"MEMBERSHIP" of the AHA and to worry about homebrewers instead of her 
advertisers,  you know the folks who make malt extract. 
 
HBD was much better before the advent of the AHA into our world.  Lets 
get them out of the digest business!!!  Further more do as I have done as 
well as the majority of the members of my homebrew club have done, CANCEL 
YOU MEMBERSHIP IN THE AHA!!  Want a better magazine to help with you 
homebrewing problem then subscribe to Brewing Techniques.

Subject: RE: Double decoction mashing


     Hi! 
 
     SM writes in to describe his double decoction schedule.  He mashed-in 
     at 122F (Protein rest), than pulled a decoction.  He heated it to 154, 
     rested for starch conversion, then heated to boiling.  He added it 
     back to the main mash, raising the temp to 150F.  He then pulled a 
     second decoction, boiled it and added it back to the main mash, 
     raising the temp to 167F. 
 
     That last step was a mistake.  When you boil the decoction you release 
     unconverted starch.  When you return the decoction to the main mash, 
     you want to do it so that the temperature stays low enough for the 
     amylases to still be active.  What the described schedule did is 
     denature the amylases while adding back unconverted starch. 
 
     To hit that last step (mash-out), either heat the tun directly or 
     remove some of the liquid portion of the mash, bring it up to a boil, 
     and return it to the main mash to raise the temperature to 168F. 
 
     As far as the saccharification rest temperatures are concerned, 150F 
     is fine if you want a highly fermentable wort.  If you want sweeter 
     beer, use a higher temp. 
 
     The main point of decoction mashing these days is to develop 
     melanoidins.  These are compounds that give beer its malty aroma and 
     taste.  They are formed from amino acids and simple sugars during 
     boiling. 
 
     Because of this, a single 30-40 minute decoction is probably 
     sufficient.  Double decocting is far more time and energy consuming, 
     and probably doesn't add much more to the final product than a single 
     decoction. 
 
     Also because of the fact that you need sugars to make melanoidins, you 
     should rest at the first saccharification step long enough to ensure 
     that an adequate amount of sugar has formed.  I don't think you need 
     to wait for complete conversion, though (conversion will continue in 
     the main mash after the decoction has been pulled). 
 
     I highly recommend the books "German Wheat Beer" (Warner) and "Bock" 
     (Richman) for their discussions about decocting.  They keep everything 
     simple and straight forward. 
 
     Have fun!
