The presence of the enzyme that produces ferulic acid from malt in rye 
is speculative, but my 63% rye beer does have a substantial clove 
(4-vinyl guaicol) component, and I'd guess that the amount is similar 
to a barley beer using this yeast.  Don't know - good bet. 
 
As for head retention - rye doesn't have the heading capabilities of 
wheat but has much more than barley malt.  Rye falls between wheat and 
barley here.

This is a list of the "benefits" of being an AHA "member" 
 
 
     National Homebrewers Conference 
 
After having attended 3 of these things I am now convinced there are better 
ways for homebrewers to get together.  the conference is expensive and really 
does not provide much in the way of new or interesting information.  I've 
personally had enough of listening to Charlie Papazain telling about his 
travels.  He is not the President of the AHA anymore, so he is traveling using 
whatever money is provided by the AOB (which includes the AHA). I think Charlie
has gotten out of involvement with the AHA since professional brewing is where 
the money is.  Homebrewers are cheapskates for the most part.  Save your money 
and buy a Pico Brewing System. :-) 
 
Also the AHA provides not roommate matching service which can create problems 
if you want to go and are trying to find a roommate to save some money. 
 
     National Homebrew Competition 
 
The only advantage to an AHA membership here is that you get a discount on 
entry.  But the awards except for the big winner are not all that great.  Just 
because someone wins in the "Nationals" means nothing more that any other 
competition.  A large number of good brewers do not enter competitions 
particularly the Nationals. 
 
     Sanctioned Competition Program 
 
This is not much. You are much better off sanctioning with the Beer Judge 
Certification Program.  A "sanctioned " competition may or may not be run well 
so don't be fooled into thinking this means anything.  Some at the AHA are not 
happy that the BJCP did not dry up and blow away.  Remember all the talk about 
the AHA judging program etc? 
 
     Members Information Service 
 
This can be a help to newbies.  But after awhile it is pretty useless, 
particularly if you are the type who reads Brewing Techniques etc. 
 
     Homebrew Club Network 
 
There are plenty of sources of club info now.  Various beer rags, homebrew 
shops, the net etc. 
 
     Periodic discounts on books published by Brewers Publications 
 
This is a joke because they then want to charge $3-4 for shipping an $11 book. 
You are better off waiting for it to show up in your local shop. 
 
 
     A Full Guarantee 
 
Which brings me to the point that you can cancel your AHA membership and get 
your money back or simply not renew. 
 
     CompuServe Beer Forum 
 
The AHA never has had much of a presence on this forum.  They were given free 
access for a while. Essentially most of the sysops on the forum know alot more 
than the folks at the AHA.  James Spence was the only person who even 
participated on any regular basis.  He is gone. 
 
     GABF entry in to members-only tasting 
 
As Kelly pointed out this is no longer a free-benefit.  Like AHA members go in 
such large numbers that they are really going to contribute a large amount of 
revenue to this thing?  I think not.  Dilbert in action. 
 
     Zymurgy 
 
Good for beginners.  Special issues used to be something you got to use as a 
reference. Not this year. This magazine is entirely support by the writing of  
homebrewers.  This makes for articles that may need large amounts of editting 
and correction that is also done by members.  There are problems with the 
editting process for Zymurgy and without the use of e-mail I don't see how it 
ever got done in the past.  This is not to say BYO and BT don't have editting 
problems either. 
 
The AHA powers that be have made no formal mention of the firing of James 
Spence.  Good or bad he was with the AHA for five years.  It has been almost 
a month since he was let go.  There are various political reasons for his 
firing.  The details are such that it is best not to discuss them at length 
since he still has to get a new job.  The AHA has not given me any formal 
response to my queries about this.  Some may say it is none of my business. 
There are those at the AOB who feel that James was an important contact for 
many MEMBERS of the AHA and that these MEMBERS deserve a formal explaination. 
The President of the AHA feels differently.  It was just decide that James 
"wasn't working out anymore" and was let go.  The Winter issue will have no 
mention of his firing or the fact that he is even gone, last time I contacted 
the editor. 
 
AHA Board of Advisors 
 
This is another joke.  The AHA does not listen to them.  any suggestions are 
ignored except for those that follow the AHA/AOB party line. 
 
 
Lifetime memberships 
 
I know a person who has been openly critical of the AHA. 
He refuses to advertize his homebrewing business in  Zymurgy.  what does the 
AHA do, they give him a lifetime membership. Huh?  This is how my membership 
dollars are being spent?

This points out why the HBD should not be on the AOB server. Not only is the 
AHA ignoring members but so is the parent organization. More of the wonders of 
the Charlie Papazian empire.

Indeed their are a number of excellent alternative digests out there.  So I 
guess if I don't like the weather I can move.  I would again just point out 
that I do not think it is a good idea to have an internet digest under the 
control of the Papazian empire. 
 
Also I would point out the The Brewery has done an excellent job of providing 
an extremely useful archive of good homebrew info.  But you have to have net 
access.  For a while magazines will be a better means of disseminating info 
and fortunately there are alternatives to Zymurgy. 
 
So I guess it is your own choice whether you think the AHA "membership" is more
than just a subscription to Zymurgy.  And I still believe homebrewers need to 
have an alternative to the AHA.  Homebrewing has made great advances, the AHA 
has not.

Subject: Plastic carboys


        Guy Gregory asks what kind of plastic we use for brewing in 
Australia. Here in Tasmania the easiest thing to get is food grade 
polyethylene, which is what I have used for well over 30 batches of both 
extract and partial mash brews without any problem at all. I've had beer 
sitting in the plastic for up to a month without any noticeable change in 
flavour. 
        Of course I should point out that I don't brew lagers, only ales. In 
a lager, which is brewed much colder, there would be the potential for more 
oxidation, since permeability would increase at lower temperatures. Also it 
would be much more likely to notice an off flavour or oxidation in a light 
flavoured lager. 
        Cheers.

Charles Burns asks: 
 
"Does this mean that we could get more efficient cooling by making sure that 
the chiller "water input" side is the "bottom" of the coil and the exhaust 
comes out the top?" 
 
Actaully the opposite is true for the vertical coil.  Colder water at the top 
cools wort which "sinks", displacing warmer wort to "rise" into contact with 
the cooler top coils.  Running the cold water in at the bottom would result 
in the cool wort staying on the bottom and the warm wort at the top staying 
at the top.

The OG was 1.052.  I am bottling tonight (no activity for a couple days) 
and I'll let you know if its drinkable, however, I just graduated from 
college, so you might not trust my idea of drinkable!  :) 
 
I was shooting for a 2 1/2 to 3 gallon batch ... 
 
5.5   lbs 2-row pale 
1     lb munich 
1/2   lb 120L crystal 
trace of chocolate malt 
hops + yeast starter ... 
 
and ended up with just short of 2 1/2 gallons.  The wort looked rather thin, 
and the resulting OG is due to a purposely long boil (90 minutes).

Subject: Optimize my Oatmeal Stout


Brew enthusiasts, 
I humbly submit the following for comments and suggestions. 
   Re-creating a successful oatmeal stout recipe that my brew 
partner and i had made last year, we used: 
    29#  klages 
    1.5# black patent 
    1.5# Belgian chocolate 
    1.5# Belgian roast 
    2#   flaked oats 
    some northern brewer (i think) bitter 
    small amount fuggles flavour 
    1/2 gal Wyeast London ale starter 
  Lately i've been adding 1 tsp gypsum per 6 gals of RO water 
used (sparge water too). 
  Added 160f water and re-circulated with a heater to 150f  (took 
about 30 min). Noticed ph was quite low (about 5.0 or less) probably 
due to excessive dark grains used. Re-circulate, don't worry, drink 
homebrew, maintain 150f, eat pizza, smoke cigar, for 2 hours 
(RIMS are cool). 
  OK, back to work. Increase temp to 168f and sparge with 170f 
water. Boil 90 min. reduce to 12 gals at SG 1.075. Chill to ~70f, 
pitch. 
  In an effort to improve my yeast performance (attenuation) i've 
been experimenting with aeration. So, this time, i used the aquarium 
pump for 8 hours (no stone, hopefully filtered air). As i removed 
the air, the foam was just starting to come out of the top of the 
15 gal bucket air lock hole. While by brew buddy bailed foam, i 
rushed out and got some 1 1/2" blow off tubing. The air temp was 
70f but the foam felt much warmer squishing between my fingers. 
After 12 hours the volcano subsided. Week later SG was 1.023. 
Another week, still 1.023. Tastes great flat and warm out of the 
fermenter. 
  Would like to improve the following: lower FG (too sweet), 
better yield, final yield (lost a lot of beer due to foam!) TIA.

Question is, what's the FG? I'll guess that its really high, like 1.014-1.018?

I have also been told that when you can smell chlorine there is not 
enough in the water. The explanation I heard was that when there is not 
enough chlorine in the water to kill the bacteria they absorb it and 
when they die (and presumably rot) it is released and we can then smell 
it.  Strange but true - I think! 
 
I have also been told that as chlorine is a gas if you just leave the 
water sitting there without a lid on the gas will just evaporate off.  I 
think it was John Carsten who wrote that the chlorine is bonded with 
ammonia so this may stop the evaporation from happening.  I don't know 
if that is true or if all chlorinated water is "bonded".  Even if it is 
bonded, if it is the rotting bacteria that produce the smell (& taste?) 
maybe that makes a difference. 
 
Over to you experts. 
 
P.S.  Definition of "Expert" (pronounced "Ex-spurt" of course):  An "Ex" 
is a "has been" and a "spurt" is a "drip under pressure".

Yeast: 
 
Bill Graham asked about which part of the yeast solution to use.  I 
wasn't sure if he was talking about a yeast starter or about using the 
"left-over" yeast in the ferment to start one. If it is the former then 
I swish it all around and use it all. If it is the latter, I have read 
people advocating each of these and would like to know which is best 
too.  The guy who said not to use the stuff on the bottom said that this 
was all the dead yeast that had settle and that the live yeasties would 
still be floating around.  Sounded logical to me.

Brewsters: 
 
Well the phone system is still out and it is Wednesday. Last Saturday our power
was out so I couldn't work on the computer. I did some on Sunday and Monday was
brew day, Tuesday brewing class.  SO I now have some time and the phone system 
is completely gone.  The phone line was noisy all weekend such that the modem 
wouldn't work.  My apologies for being so tardy in responding 
 
Phil Wilcox' description of how he didn't make pupmkin ale was entertaining and
I know how he feels.  Some days in the nano-brewery are like that. He said (

 I said in an HBD prior to his Pumpkin Ale Production: 
>Best way is to cool the 2.5 gals of hot wort before transfer ( it is more 
efficient), siphon it - through a >Choreboy scrubbing pad to strain out the 
hops
and hot break and some of the cold break - into that cold >water, letting the 
cold wort pass through the air to oxygenate it. Or siphon directly to that

I don't understand your reference to the "inverted racking cane stoper", but I 
have on occasion had problems with siphoning the wort with a Choreboy in place,
but only when I let the tip of the cane get next to the outside of the 
Choreboy.
It is impossible for the Choreboy itself to slow the flow, since it is so open.
When the cane tip is near the outside of the Choreboy, hops can collect around 
the cane entrance and slow the flow. The ideal place is for the tip of the cane
to be at the center of the Choreboy ( like the center of a sphere) .  When you 
get it going it is an amazingly fast and efficient way of removing the wort 
down
to the last drop and getting none of the hot break or hops over. It can strain 
wort you can't even see from a pile of hops and trub on the bottom of the 
boiler. 
 
 A 3/8" cane is plenty big enough.  Avoid putting the cane hard up against the 
edge of the pot so you don't push the tip of the cane to the outside of the 
choreboy. The cane tip should be near the outside edge of the boiler, but not 
pressed against it.  Clear the cane tip by letting the wort run backwards 
through it, adjust the choreboy so that the cane tip is halfway into it and 
place it on the bottom of the boiler, just off the outside edge, and siphon 
away. Better luck next time - with everything. Persistence will bring success. 
I guarantee it. 
 
Just say Dart Frog Dortmunder three times when you are getting frustrated and 
remember you could be doing something like mowing the lawn or shovelling snow. 
So smile.

No disagreement that you have spiralled out of control in the past and appear 
to
be now, based on my observations and comments from others. I would like YOU to 
get a grip, Al.  We ALL want you to go back making some of those excellent 
contributions you used to make here and knock off this attack mode you have 
been
in lately. Take a vacation or finish your book or drop whatever is bugging you.
I bear you no grudge, but wish you would step back a little and get less 
personally involved  in what's happening here. 
 
I stand by everything I said. I don't have the advantage of peer review before 
I submit my comments, so they do have the possibility of being "misleading" to 
someone looking for an "error".  If they were truly misleading or wrong, which 
does happen sometimes (at least to me), a simple comment will bring an apology 
and a correction from me.  I am not an idiot, nor bad intentioned, nor am I 
perfect - no matter how hard I try. 
 
Weren't you the one who objected to my backing up everything wih a reference? 
And lately you haven't even believed my references.  What's a body to do? 
 
Anyway, thanks for your concern.  We love you, but the tank is heading toward 
empty.  Fill it up again with some good, positive contributions.

Subject: Re: Calcium and pH in wort


Brewsters: 
 
Please note my phone service has been too poor or totally nothing since that 
Nor'easter last week so I can't receive HBD or send my comments. Some of the 
comments below may be a little out of date or overlap others' comments. Sorry. 
 
Bill and I continue our thread ( where's everyone else?) on calcium in beer. 
 
> If an acid rest works, why not lactic acid? 
 
Should work fine. Given your premise, which I have always assumed requires some
calcium in the water. 
 
> Is the alpha amylase enzyme 
> stability a function of pH or calcium? 
 
Both I believe. But the alpha is unusual in that calcium is involved. 
 
> Another question, how much calcium does malt have? 
 
M&BS  p 194 1st ed says: 
 
"In lager brewing, the adjusting of the wort pH is achieved largely by addition
of acid to the liquor and/or the partial removal of carbonates to give 50 - 100
mg/l ((aka ppm))  calcium *carbonate*  ((or 50X40/100 = 20 ppm {Ca++} to 
100X40/100 = 40 ppm {Ca++}))................ 
 
The practice in pale ale breweries on the other hand is to to pay more 
attention
to the addition of gypsum, although removal of carbonates is often carried 
out.........Gypsum is added to the brewing water to bring the calcium ion to 50
mg/l ((aka 50 ppm))  and a further charge of gypsum is made to the copper, 
equivalent to 50mg/l of calcium because too high a level of calcium ions in the
mash is disadvantageous........ 
 
The concentration of calcium in beer will be on the order of 60-80 mg/l ((60 - 
80 ppm {Ca++} ))" 
 
(( my comments)) 
 
I cannot find an analysis of malt or barley that gives me a calcium content, 
and
it not is obvious from the above comments that the malt is supplying any.  In 
the absence of any information to the contrary, and based on the need for 
calcium to stabilize the alpha amylase in mashes where acid rests are used,  I 
would guess the malt is supplying 10-30 ppm of calcium to the beer. 
 
This would explain how acidifying the mash with either an acid rest or lactic 
acid would get the {Ca++} in the 20-40 ppm range ( when you add in, say, 10 ppm
from the water) used in lager brewing. 
 
Let's try thinking of it this way: 
 
Any phosphate that is available will definitely precipitate the calciuim, since
the insolubility ( something on the order of 10^ -33 as a Ksp) is such a force 
in removing calcium and phosphate.   Now, if there is an excess of calcium and 
we add more phosphoric acid we wil get more calcium phosphate and the protons 
from the phosphoric acid will remain in solution. If we don't have an excess of
calcium we will still get acidification.  If we have an excess of calcium and 
the pH is still too high, it will mean the total amount of naturally occurring 
phosphate is all gone.  Yeast need phosphate.  Adding an excess of calcium to 
the point of getting a pH of 5.2 or so must not deplete the natural phosphate 
content. 
 
The mechanism is different with lactic acid, since the calcium salt of lactic 
acid is pretty soluble.  Therefore, the lactic acid will not strip the mash of 
calcium (needed by alpha amylase) and should be better at providing the proper 
mash pH and leaving calcium in the solution for a more stable alpha amylase ( 
hence a more efficient mash is likely), better flocculation of the protein 
breaks and flocculation of yeasts at the end of the fermentation. My vote goes 
for lactic over phosphoric acid. 
 
In the course of reading aout this I came across reference that is a little off
course,  but it relates to better beer and puts in a vote for acidifying the 
mash with lactic acid. 
 
M&BS p209, 1st ed. 
 
"The flavour of the beer is altered by the quantities of chloride (full flavor)
and sulfate (dry flavor) and lactate (softer flavor) ions that are present in 
the mash." 
 
The first two (Cl, SO4) I was aware of, but until now, I don't remember seeing 
a
reference to lactic acidifications producing a "soft" taste.  I did notice a 
softer, less dry, taste, however, especially in my IPAs, which are Burtonized, 
when I began using lactic acid to acidify my sparge and at the time assumed it 
was due to a reduction of husk tannins.  This sounds like acidification of the 
mash with lactic acid could be of benefit for beers like some lagers, German 
and
other beers which benefit from the full, soft mouth. It may be out of place in 
the firmer mouthed, drier pale ales, etc. 
 
It would be interesting to make a low calcium, low sulfate, high lactate pale 
ale and see what results.

Brian, 
You wouldn't be the first HBer to ascribe a higher quality and mystical nature 
to someone else's tap water. Unless you have a problem with your own tap water,
say extreme hardness or high iron content, don't bother.  If you have very 
permanently hard water and want to make lagers, dilute your tap water with 
distilled water used for drinking.  In most cases cooled boiled tap water is 
sufficient if you are making extract brews.  When you make all-grain, brews 
water quality increases in significance.

Chuck Bernard asks 
 
3.  If I get one of those vacuum sealers at a garage sale or flea market 
somewhere I this a better way      to store grain than frozen/refridgerated? 
 What about vacuum and cold storage? 
 
Chuck, 
 
When you say grain, I presume you mean malts? If so, there isn't really a need 
to do any more than keep them cool (say your basement), in a closed container (
I use lidded trash cans, Rubbermaid storage boxes and plastic shoe boxes) to 
keep out the mice.  They will slowly lose their enzymatic powers, but it will 
take several years, based on my personal experience. 
- ------------------------------------ 
 
>1) is it feasible to keep the temperature at a constant 155 degrees 
>   in a $1.50 bucket (noninsulated)? 
 
NO. Even a 5 gallon mash tun inside a styrofoam box drops about 2 degrees per 
30
min.  Wrap several layers of bubblewrap around to help and don't forget to 
insulate top and bottom. Why not use a 5 gallon boiler and mash there. You can 
heat periodically to bring the temperature back up. 
 
>2) if the temp in the bucket drops from 155 to 150 in a one hour 
>   period, is that a problem? 
 
It will make a drier beer than one held at 155F 
 
>3) if the temp drops to (say) 145 degrees in 30 minutes, is it OK 
>   to pour hot water into the mash to reheat it to 155? 
 
Of course, but see above.  Adding hot water during the mash speeds up the 
saccharification by reducing the product concentration which can block enzyme 
action. 
 
>4) for a single stage mash (infusion?) is it necessary to do a mash-in 
>   before the actual mash? 
 
   Not really. 
 
> what will this gain for me? 
 
 Enzymes will be hydrated before being exposed to high temperature. Better 
predictability. 
 
>5) is a mash-out necessary too?  (i think my friend anton just 
> asked this same question ... but somehow i missed the answer). 
 
Yes, to keep the composition of the wort constant during the sparge. 
and lastly ... 
 
>6) how much volume of wort needs to be recirculated during sparging? 
>100%?  the first 2 quarts (dependent upon the false bottom)? 
 
Recirculation is important to prevent any starchy residue from clouding the 
beer
during the boilup.  I generally recirculate 1/2 to 1 gallon, reheating to 170F 
before putting it back into the sparger, depending on how cloudy it looks and 
how fast it is running.

   Hear hear!  I'll drink to that...and I will too (got a pale ale on tap

BT is nice.  *IF* you are an all grain brewer, or a LARGE scale homebrewer, 
or a REALLY anal-scientific brewer, or a brewpub brewer, or a small 
microbrewery brewer...... But that leaves out about 90% of the brewing

Why do we *NEED* another organization?  What will it do that the AHA does 
not?  (Other than providing a nebulous sense that it is 'ours'.)

Subject: Using "ancient" lager yeast


 
It's been some time since I've been an active brewer and I was digging 
around in my yeast bank amonsgt a pile of agar plates with mostly dead 
yeast.  These plates date back to July 1994...over two years ago!! 
My Wyeast 3068 is dead (well,  I restreaked a colony,  we'll see how that 
goes,  but a culture tube I've started last friday is dead),  as is my 
chico.  I already got a new plate of chico going (looked at the brown 
colonies sunday, so went to the local deli and got me a bottle of SNPA. 
Aleady have me some nice baby colonies,  not even white yet hehe, but 
visible with the right light). 
 
Enough of my banter,  here's what survived.  I have a couple of 2+ year 
old plates that I cultured from Wyeast 2206 Bavarian Lager.  The stuff on 
antibacterial agar is dead.  The stuff on my wort agar plates (my wort, 
chinese agar...a hell of a lot cheaper than wort agar from a science 
supplier and probably healthier for the beasties too!) is mostly dead but 
for over a dozen survivors.  This plate basically has hundreds of colonies 
that died while they were small but some must've mutated to brave the cold 
long winter of two years in my beer freezer at 40 degrees.  I cultured one 
of these survivors on sunday and it's kicking out bubbly and forming nice 
solid flocculated colonies which I gleefully resuspend etc etc. The 
stuff's growing in the culture tube at a toasty 80 degrees (I was 
incubating it with a CSU/DSU to protect it from the cold wave that kicked 
through here for a few day hehe,  I'll be sure to drop the temp as I step 
it up). 
 
My question to any and all yeast experts is:  Should I risk a batch of 
beer on this two year old mutant child of Wyeast 2206?  What I stand to 
gain:  1. Free yeast!  2. Maybe I've got myself a superior yeast.  What I 
stand to lose: 1. A batch of beer! A wasted plate if I decide to reculture 
this 2206 child and it turns out swill. 
 
Cast yer votes!!

Subject: Plastic use in HB'ing


As an engineer with an injection molder of HDPE and PP food containers, I 
feel that I can offer some insights into this current discussion. 
First of all, IMHO, if you are brewing ales, does it really matter whether 
or not the container is 02 permeable?  what about open fermentation? what 
about all the hoopla about aeration using pure o2 or air?  There should be 
absolutely no problem with using a food grade plastic to ferment your beer. 
I have been using several containers which have a volume to the rim of 8 
gallons.  I usually use 6 gallon brews.  This gives me a lot of air contact 
with the beer.  Maybe my tastebuds are dead, but my beer is not oxidized.  I 
also rack into identical containers for secondary.  I usually use 7 to 10 
days in primary and 14-21 days in secondary.  Absolutely no problems that I 
can trace back to the containers.  Scratches on the containers should be of 
relatively little consequence unless you trap crud in these areas and don't 
clean the containers.  As long as you sanitize and pitch a good starter you 
should overcome anything left. 
Back to the plastics... I would recommend that if you are trying to locate 
containers, look at the bottom of the potential container.  It should have 
NSF-2 or FDA Approved or FDA Approved Materials, molded into the bottom. 
NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) approves the materials used and the 
actual containers molded from the various plastics.  The constituents have 
to be listed as acceptable for food contact by the FDA.  Don't under any 
circumstances use a container that is colored and does not have one of the 
above approvals on it.  There are a lot of paint buckets out there that you 
should NOT put food into.  There were until recently heavy metals used in 
the colorants.  There are probably still a lot of these floating around 
being used in paint or other containers which are not food safe.  Clear or 
natural white containers are Probably safe even if they are not listed as 
food safe.  If food was shipped in the container, then it should be safe. 
This is where you may have a problem with the reuse of a container, past 
odors and contaminants.(pickles)  If you want a good container, go to a 
restaurant supply company and purchase a container.  Sorry I went on and on, 
but I do believe that brewing in plastic is safe in more ways than one, I 
have dropped a glass carboy while cleaning it, it was empty but shattered 
into a few thousand pieces.  I wasn't cut and I sure won't be cut with my 
plastic and I bet you can't tell I don't brew in glass.
