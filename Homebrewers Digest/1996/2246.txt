Yes, the cold water should go into the bottom of the chiller and exit out 
the top. 
 
However it depends on how fast your flow is, I know when I have 
mine on full blast, the water coming from the exit is *cold*! 
 
So, what do you gain from running the inlet to the bottom of the coil? 
water conservation, you can slow the water flow down and still chill. 
(say that three times fast:)

Subject: trub removal


     George De Piro  replies on trub removal... 
     Derek also asks about trub removal.  He seems to chill the wort in the 
     boiler than rack it over to the fermenter.  He is upset because so 
     much break material gets siphoned over. 
 
One of our club members (Bruce Hammil) recently wrote an article in our 
Homebrew
club newsletter on the topic... 
Siphon/pour beer into one carboy, wait about an hour & clean up. During that 
time
a cold break will settle out & you can siphon off the cleared wort into another
carboy,
aerate & pitch yeast. 
 
I've tried it twice, I end up leaving about a half a gallon of slurry (sniff, 
sob) in
the bottom of the first fermentor. Perhaps if I waited longer the trub would 
compact
further... No telling of quality differences yet, but Bruce has made some good 
brews
using this technique.

  Hey, 
 
  In HBD#2242, Cuchulain Libby (a most impressive name) imparts 
  acquired knowledge that full wort boils and liquid yeasties really 
  do make a difference, then hedges on all-grain because of currently 
  trying to make the "best beer with the least effort".  Although an 
  arguable point, I purport that the "best beer" CAN'T be made without 
  going to all-grain, let me impart the Zen spin on why all-grain is 
  preferable. 
 
  "You can't be enlightened about where you are unless you experience 
  the journey of getting there." 
 
  Or... you'll never experience the "best" beer you can make unless 
  you cook the grain yourself... adding your own effort into the 
  process.  With extract you have a nameless, faceless brewing partner 
  you know nothing about.  It robs your product of some of its 
  history. 
 
  Brew happy,

Subject: New A-B Commercials


Who else has heard this one.... 
 
I woke up this morning to the clock radio, as usual, to the end of a song, 
which was immediately followed by a commercial.  ( I say that only to say that 
I heard the entire commercial.)  With spooky music in the background, an 
undisclosed person was heard rapping on someone's door. The door opened, and a 
whiny, nasal voice (purported to be Jim Koch) questioned "Who are you."  The 
other person claimed to be the ghost of Samual Adams, "Brewer, Patriot, the man
who is on all of your bottles" and he laid it on pretty heavy to "Jim Koch" on 
how he is "tricking" the public.  "Your beer isn't even made in Boston.  The 
beer you call 'handcrafted' is made in the same breweries that make Schlitz and
Old Golden."  The ghost of Samual Adams gave a pitch on honesty, and truth in 
advertising, and the announcer concluded the commercial with "Stop being 
tricked and treat yourself to ..." and I forget what he said.  By this point I 
had figured out it must have been A-B, and the final sentence of the 
commercial, the only time you knew it was A-B, was "Brought to you by Anheuser 
Busch." 
 
How many more of these commercials are out there?  Is this a regional ad?  (I 
am in New England...the "home" of Sam Adams). 
 
I wish I could get a transcript of the commercial.  I think I'll check out the 
Bud homepage, just for kicks, to see what they are hyping now.  It appears the 
born-on dating kick has now spun out into the truth in advertising kick.

One the great things ( among many) about beer is that it will not support 
organisms which are pathogenic - or cause botulism, since it sterilized by 
boiling for an extended period and  is always acidic. 
 
M&BS p 572 1ed ed. says: 
 
"Fortunately for brewers, microbiological control has to be exercised only over
a limited range of of bacteria and yeasts and none of the bacteria are spore 
forming......... Pathogenic micro-organisms fail to grow in beer, or even 
survive for extended periods." 
 
Regarding racking off your mead, I have just had some great lessons in private 
conversations from some mead makers, Robert Waddell, Jeff Smith and Spencer 
Thomas. 
 
Although I haven't had the opportunity to do it yet, here's a shortened version
of their story: 
 
 1) If the pH drops below about 3.7   and 2) if you don't have a source of 
B-vitamins ( like from dead yeast) your mead may take a long time to ferment 
out
and not taste good.  If you can, get some pH paper and measure the pH 
periodically. If it drops below pH = 3.7, add a little CaCO3 to keep in in the 
range of pH = 4 or so.  Don't rack too soon so that you get some autolysis or 
put in a vitamin B comlex tablet or boil some bakers yeast in water and add 
that.

Don't worry bleach (sodium hypochlorite) will not cause a flavor problem if it 
is rinsed in three rinses of boiled hot water.  Don't use the ammonium and 
organo-ammonium based bacteriocides -some are not good for you. Also, no need, 
bleach is cheap, available and does an excellent job of cleaning and 
sterilizing. Be sure to use safety glasses and rubber gloves when handling 
bleach.

There is a new design being talked about right now here on the HBD in which the
water enters a manifold which feeds a several circular rings of tubing and the 
water exits through another manifold.  This allows more water to flow and the 
water is always colder, since it is only passing through a few feet before 
exiting. This is a much more efficient device. 3/8" seems to be about right in 
terms of forming the coils easily and still have enough water to be efficient. 
Be sure to use a safe solder or compression fittings on any thing you 
construct.

So did I and on its second use it came apart and the parts fell into the beer I
was going to take to a party. I had to drink an unplanned half liter of my 
Porter to get it back  ( what's that about making lemonade out of lemons?).  I 
don't know if there was a snap ring and it fell into another bottle or not but 
I'm going to use super glue on it to keep it together. Ken Schwartz, I think, 
set up a similar system with an tire air valve. It is a lot cheaper, but I like
the convenience of using the ball lock fitting with out a lot of changing 
around. The advantage of Ken's system is you can afford to have several in the 
fridge at the same time.  If this becomes a regular event , I may go with his 
system. 
 
My beers have so much head I have trouble filing them into bottles even at 10  
psi, so I use CO2 on a partially filled bottle to kill the head, add more beer,
etc.  When I get almost to  the top, I squeeze the bottle and release the 
pressure to get any air out, pressurize with CO2 until the bottle gets hard 
about 20 -25 lbs and put it in the refrigerator.

Matt Hughes  complains about loss of beer with whole hops.  Matt, try the 
Choreboy solution.  Attach a  copper, unsoaped Choreboy on the bottom of a 
racking cane.  It  will use the hops as a filter and you will get every last 
ounce of wort and keep all the hot break behind trapped in the hops. The trick 
is to put the end of the racking cane in the middle of the Choreboy, not near 
the edge and don't put the end of the cane up against the wall of the boiler, 
just along the edge.

Subject: Oxygenation,


Brewsters: 
 
Sorry, but my telephone has been out since Sunday and it is obviously fixed 
today - whatever today is.  Sorry if this is overlapping other contributions. 
 
Comments on the wort oxygenation article appearing in Brewing Techniques this 
month: 
 
> To me the article showed that if you own an oxygenator you may as 
>well use it but if you don't, save your money!  What do you people think? 
 
I waited anxiously as I read the article to see what the actual recommended 
level of oxygen should be and he never really answered it.  However, it looks 
like he got a real difference between 10 ppm and 7 ppm. At the higher level he 
got a slower start ( implying to me more aerobic growth) and a slower 
flocculation ( implying I don't know what - who knows?) which makes me feel 
that
10 ppm oxygen is necessary to begin to really get a significant amount of 
growth
in the wort. Lower oxygen content just doesn't seem to produce this. 
 
It is probably time to open up the ester thread again since we have all had 
time
to do some more reading and re-think our discussions.   My thoughts: 
 
IF you are interested in low ester content in the fermenting beer, I think the 
yeast growth should take place in the starter and let the pitching rate be high
enough that no significant colony expansion takes place in the wort during 
fermentation, since discussions here and elsewhere indicate that esters happen 
during yeast colony expansion.  The significance of this article, in my view, 
is that it suggests that our starters should contain 10 ppm of oxygen 
continually to get good growth. Bubbbling in air or oxygen continuously during 
starter fermentation should reduce the formation of esters and scrub any 
aromatics and CO2 ( which can slow growth) out. 
 
As indicated below, just bubbling in oxygen is not enough to ensure good yeast 
growth. 
- ------------------------------- 
Dion says: 
 
"The first phase is the lag phase, and is *aerobic*.  The yeast will 
take up oxygen and nourish themselves without much population increase 
until the oxygen is depleted.  The only byproducts at this stage are 
H2O and CO2.  As soon as oxygen depletion occurs, they go into 
fermentation which is an *anaerobic* phase.  The cell population will 
go up rapidly to a max of about 5 million cells per milliliter and 
alcohol and CO2 will be produced.  Add more oxygen and you increase 
the lag phase, however, when the fermentation starts, you will have 
yeast which are in a much healthier state than with less oxygen." 
 
DRB says -  Not really, Dion, S. Cerevisiae always produce alcohol in a normal 
fermentation, even in the presence of oxygen.   In commercial operations yeast 
is grown in aerobic conditions. 
 
M&BS p 492 1st ed says: 
 
In the case of Baker's Yeast: 
" 
When air is blown into a growth medium, whether it be a malt wort or a molasses
medium, there is a substantial increase in yeast propagation. This discovery 
called the Pasteur effect, after its discoverer arises from the inhibition of 
alcohol production............." 
 
In the case of Brewer's Yeast: 
 
The Aerobic form of metabolism is incomplete in S. Cerevisiae if the content of
sucrose, glucose,maltose and other carbohydrates is high in the aerated medium.
To prevent the Crabtree effect from taking over, Danish and German workers took
to adding incrementally larger amounts of carbohydrates to keep the overall 
fermentable sugar content  below 1% or so at any time.  Under these conditions 
in the presence of oxygen, no alcoholic fermentation takes place and yeast 
growth is good. 
 
M&BS says on P456: 
If the glucose concentration in the growth medium is high, say over 1%, the 
Pasteur effect is no longer effective in Sacc. species. Even in the presence of
air, the degradation of high concentrations of glucose proceeds very 
substantially by alcoholic fermentation. 
 
Malting and Brewing Science made a plot of yeast yield versus oxygen saturation
before fermentation and  I extracted some representative results below: 
 
Oxygen Saturation (%)   Max.Yeast Yield (g/l) 
 
5     8 
10     10 
20     12 
50     13 
100     13 
 
It is clear that it is useless to saturate the wort beyond 25% in terms of 
yeast
population growth  in normal fermentation of beer.  In fact it makes me wonder 
"Why bother?" if population growth is the only issue here.  A discussion on 
production of various by-products ( i.e. esters, aldehydes) seems to be the 
issue here then. 
 
M&BS p 506-507 
 
"The condition of the yeast on pitching depends on its previous history. It has
been shown that lack of contact between yeast and oxygen over successive 
fermentation has a cumulative effect. Thus, in a series in which wort used had 
only 0.5 ul/l of dissolved oxygen, the percentage apparent attenuation.... fell
successively from 67 to 65.5 to 44%, the balance of fusel alcohols,esters,and 
diketones was abnormal.  In some instances increasing dissolved oxygen levels 
over 6 ul/l has little effect, but with other yeasts there is advantage in 
oxygenating the wort rather than aerating it to achieve over 8 ul/l   Lack of 
oxygen, particularly coupled with with a shortage of unsaturated fatty acids, 
leads to a progressive fall in viability." 
- ------------------------------------------------------------ 
I have been trying to get a number which will represent the solubility of 
oxygen
in water in ppm so I can figure out if 10 ppm is the maximum solubility, 10 % 
of
that value or what and have really failed to get anything that makes sense.  I 
tried the following things: 
 
1) Oxygen solubility in water is 2.3 X 10^ -5  as mole fraction solubility at 
one atmosphere.( Chem Rubber Handbook p 6-3) To convert this to ppm, a mole of 
water weighs 18 g/ mole so 2.3 x 10^ -5 moles of oxygen (2.3 X32X10^ -5 ) = 
7.36
x1-^ -5 g of oxygen in 18 gr of water or 1000000/18 = 55555 so (5.55 X 10^ 4 )X
7.36X^ -5 = 4.08 grams of oxygen per million grams of water. So the solubility 
of oxygen at RT and 1ATM is 4.08 ppm of oxygen. This is what I calculate as the
solubility of oxygen in water. How can a level of 10 ppm be achieved unless the
meter was wrong or I converted this incorrectly or the solubility of oxygen in 
wort is higher than in water? 
 
2) M&BS reports this as ul/l is this what is meant by ppm in the case of a gas 
and a liquid? Does this mean the solubility of oxygen is (2.3/22.4)X10^ -5 or 1
X10-6 l/ 18gr water or 55 ppm ? 
 
This has me stumped and I don't where else to go. Anyone have a separate 
reference listing a maximum solubility value in ppm oxygen or see my mistake? 
- ------------------------------------------------------------ 
Although conventional starter methods appear to work OK for me, based on the 
above comments and references, I now think the proper way to prepare a starter 
is to add sterile air or oxygen continuously, add sterile maltose solution 
periodically to keep the concentration of sugars below 1% .  I think I'll try 
it.   Any comments?  Anyone tried it?

     Hi again! 
 
     George Fix's post about the glass-lined fermenters with hairline 
     cracks got me thinking:  why not teflon-lined tanks? 
 
     Aside from the expense, what's wrong with the idea?  Teflon is great 
     stuff: practically inert, extremely easy to clean, can withstand a 
     wide range of temperatures, etc. 
 
     The only other downside to it (that I can see) is the ease with which 
     it is scratched, but in a fermenter that shouldn't be a problem. 
 
     Anybody see anything wrong with this idea?  I have no affiliation with 
     DuPont, etc. 
 
     Have fun!

Subject: RE: Watery beer / sanitizing corks for mead


     Hi all! 
 
     Kevin asks why his beer is watery.  He says that he uses a double 
     decoction, but doesn't give any more detail than that. 
 
     My guess would be that he is resting the main mash between 113-124F 
     for too long.  Most decoction schedules in the popular books say to 
     bring the entire mash to ~122F, then rest 30 min. and pull the 
     decoction, etc.  In my experience it is detrimental to leave the main 
     mash at 122F for the long time that it takes to perform the decoction. 
 
     Because proteins are so important to both the body and head retention 
     of beer, an overlong protein rest is not desirable (especially at the 
     lower end of the protein rest spectrum).  The double decoction 
     schedule I usually follow is detailed pretty well on page 121 of this 
     years "Zymurgy" (so-called) Special Issue. 
 
     In short, I leave the main mash at 95F while performing the first 
     decoction, return the decoction to step up to 122F, rest 20-30 min. 
     and then heat the entire mash to ~145-150F.  I then pull the second 
     decoction and use it to step up to 158F.  It's easy to not overshoot 
     the temp. if you let the decoction cool (because of it's low water 
     content it seems to lose heat pretty quickly). 
 
     Some pros I know say that modern malts are all well modified enough 
     that you don't need any protein rest at all, but sometimes I do it 
     anyway, and as long as it's kept to under 30 minutes I haven't had 
     heading problems or watery beer. 
     ------------------------------ 
     Another Kevin asks about sanitizing corks for his mead.  I probably 
     shouldn't brag about this, but in my experience you don't need to 
     sanitize the corks. 
 
     I say this because I have had a batch of mead aging in a carboy for 
     some time now (over 1.5 years).  It is in the same room I grind my 
     grain in.  The airlock dried up months ago, and my big, black, furry 
     housemate has knocked the stopper out several times. 
 
     The mead refuses to rot.  It's becoming kind of a conversation piece. 
     I recently took it to a club meeting to see what people thought

     it was "too clean." 
 
     I realize that I'm probably just lucky, but when you think about it, 
     what bugs are going to like a nutrient poor, high alcohol environment? 
 
     For those of you that are wondering why I don't just drink the stuff, 
     the truth is that this mead is too bland for my palate, and I'm not 
     often looking to drink something that ~14% ABV.  I'll just keep

Anyone in the Va Beach area (or close)... 
the 25th and 26th is a beer tasting event. 
It is at the 24th st park, and they will have 
lots of food, fun, and uhh BEER. Farm Fresh has the

From: Michael Gerholdt replied to me ... 
 
"John, can you taste or smell the chlorine at that concentration? I believe 
the threshold for detection by humans is generally considered closer to 7 
ppm. We have a public water supply due to the nature of the facility I 
manage, and the requirement is to keep at or above 1 ppm free chlorine, 
suggested between 1 and 4 ppm. " 
 
Michael:  You have taken this discussion FAR beyond my realm of expertise 
 (Hmmmmm. Imagine that, somebody on the  HBD who is willing to admit fault). 
Anyway, 
the advice I posted is advice that I received, used, and found success in. The 
chlorine 
concentration of our water was documented for my by a quick check with our 
city's public 
works department. 
 
The solution was offered to me by the president of our brewclub, who 
consequently lives four 
doors down and uses the same water supply that I do.  He gave me the shpeil 
about the chlorine and 
ammonia bonding, and the use of carbon filters. 
 
To my rather un-scientific mind, the argument sounded logical, and with 
everything else I've spent on 
brewing equipment, a $15 water filter seemed like a good risk.  So I purchased 
the filter and tried an 
experiment.  The results are posted below: 
 
Without using the filter - water tasted like it came from a swimming pool. 
With the filter - the water tasted better than when I didn't use the filter. 
 
I was convinced.  Keep it simple.

Subject: Lactic Forming


I plan on making my white beer tomorrow. I was thinking of mashing 
in the grains tonight at 110F and letting sit until the morning. 
I guess I am hoping to lower the ph by letting it sit for 12+ hours. 
I would then raise to 128F for 30 mins and then take to 158F for 
1 hour. Grain bill is 12 lbs pilsner, 10 lbs bulgur wheat, 2 lb oats. 
 
My questions are: 
 
Will this overnight rest lower the ph and form the lactic acid I want? 
 
Do I have to worry about enzyme degradation? 
 
Is there something else I should be worrying about? 
 
Should I acidify my sparge water? To what ph? 
 
How do I cut the top off a keg? 
 
If I'm not thinking it, I'm drinking it,

Subject: Alternatives to AHA


It is my understanding that there has been an alternative to the 
AHA for many many years,  YOUR LOCAL HOMEBREWING CLUB!!!!!! 
 
Your local club can provide you with friendly and personal advice 
and information that can have the BIGGEST impact on your own 
brewing practices.  Such clubs can be great sources of info for the 
best local places to purchace equipment, supplies, and great beer. 
These clubs can provide both the beginning and experienced brewer with 
alot of advice for improving your beer.  And the best part of your 
local club is that you get to make alot of friends who have similar 
interests to you. 
 
I live in New England and know of several excellent local homebrew 
clubs in every one of the tiny states we have up here.  I would 
recommend most of them to any homebrewer.  I am sure that most areas 
of the country are similarly blessed.

I think that two factors are responsible for much of the decline in the 
perceived quality of the HBD since the move to the AOB.  These are: 
 
1. removing the daily distribution limit, and 
2. adding an undigested distribution mode. 
 
A third factor is simply the steadily increasing number of 
subscribers.  Even with the best of intentions on everyone's part, the 
more people subscribe, the more postings will be sent. 
 
Before the move, the HBD was limited to about 50K bytes per day, 
distributed once per day.  If too many people sent postings, the delay 
between posting and appearance got long, and people stopped posting. 
This would not have worked without the ability to cancel postings, 
something that has also been lost in the move.  Unfortunately, this 
limitation cannot work unless distribution is only by digest. 
 
The undigested distribution mode encourages those who are using it to 
respond immediately to new messages, producing a flood of messages on 
the same topic, and leading to a tendency to "shoot from the lip". 
When you know what you're about to say won't appear at least until the 
next day, and will probably appear along with responses from several 
others, you tend to think a bit more about what you're saying and how 
you're saying it.

If the water exiting your chiller is cold, then your chiller is not 
functioning.  The water should be *warm*, indicating that it has indeed 
picked up heat while flowing thru the chiller.

Nope, you lose overall, because the coldest part of the chiller remains in 
contact with the coldest part of the wort.  Any water savings is illusory. 
 
The most efficient method is to flow from the top.  Check your outlet 
temprature and modulate water flow for maximum outlet temprature.

Rather than simply throwing vauge unsubstantiated stones, why not specify

It's east to simply throw suspicions, and there is plenty of that going around.

FG was even higher than you predicted Charles ... 1.0<gulp>24.  The beer 
had an OK taste to it, but had this character to it I am unfamiliar 
with, almost syrupy, not alot of alcohol.

This came in from another reader(KennyEddy`at`aol.com): 
 
Charles Burns asks: 
 
"Does this mean that we could get more efficient cooling by making sure that 
the chiller "water input" side is the "bottom" of the coil and the exhaust 
comes out the top?" 
 
Actaully the opposite is true for the vertical coil.  Colder water at the top 
cools wort which "sinks", displacing warmer wort to "rise" into contact with 
the cooler top coils.  Running the cold water in at the bottom would result 
in the cool wort staying on the bottom and the warm wort at the top staying 
at the top.

Yes, the geometry has an effect, but only on high gravity ferments or 
if your yeast is on the edge and not sufficiently viable, or not of 
sufficient quantity.  I have been fermenting in kegs for 3 years and 
35 batches.  Do both primary and secondary.  Attached is a little
