Wouldn't a true Zen Brewer actually grow the grain and hops and do all the 
malting also? Not to mention growing the trees to start the fire for the 
kettle (which he/she crafted themself with the raw materials of the earth). 
 
I brew all grain (and always have) but I have had many fantastic extract 
brews made by friends or whatever that were just as good and brewed to 
style. 
 
Are you saying that extract brewers can't get the same results as all-grain 
brewers? FROGWASH! If you are, that isn't very ZEN of you at all.

Furture reading has me considering the following: 
 
Mash in at 110F and let sit overnight (12 hours) to encourage 
lactobacillus growth. 
 
Acidify sparge water to ph of 5.7. 
 
After boiling, put 1/2 gallon of wort in an open fermentor at 
125F and toss in small handful of grain to introduce lactobacillus. 
After 1 week, pasteurize and add back to main batch. I read that 
lactobacillus will survive the 125F temps but other bugs on the 
grains wouldn't. Should I simply add a teaspoon of yogurt to get 
a purer lactobacillus culture? 
 
At bottling, add lactic acid to ph of 4.5 if not already there.

I think that you guys are way off the mark trying to blame someone for the 
deterioration of HBD. 
 
What we have witnessed is the usual dilution from over popularity (lots of 
newbies who all need/want to learn the same material) coupled with an increase 
in expertise. The HB community has sufficiently mastered the art of making beer
that most posts look tired or redundant.

I disagree.  I think they have done a good job in the last year or two at 
addressing issues that newer brewers have as they try to improve each 
batch.  They do, however, ignore the "newbie brewer" who is making 
his next batch the same way he makes all his batches and isn't interested 
in things like hydrometers, IBUs and liquid yeast.  These brewers are 
probably not on this digest and are not who the magazine is aimed at. 
******* 
 
Thanks to Jim Liddl for responding to my questions on his anti-AHA views. 
I agree for the most part, and I don't feel I am getting much out of my 
membership and will not be renewing. 
 
Pro-AHA note:  We in Tennessee are trying to get homebrewing legalized 
this year.  We have a contact at the AHA who has the legislation drafted 
and will be helping us contact TN homebrewers and getting the ball 
rolling.  This legislation was successfully passed in FL.  While we could 
do this without the AHA help, it would be re-inventing the wheel to 
some extent. 
 
Anti-AHA note:  When I registered my new club with the AHA, they 
sent me, among other things, coupons for club members to join for 15% 
off.  Turns out these "coupons" are available in any issue of Zymurgy. 
In addition, the one they sent expired months before I received it, and 
the membership fee has gone up since then.  So this coupon is as 
worthless as the ads for pre-ordering new books at a discount (discount 
less than shipping cost). 
****** 
 
Incidentally, our legal contact mentioned that a recent Massachusetts 
hb competition was shut down since the Mass. law doesn't allow for 
transportation of homebrew.  I hadn't heard of this.  Anyone else have 
details?

Subject: Guiness in UK/AHA


Some comments on recent discussions: 
 
My understanding is that beverages in the UK are taxed on the amount of 
alcohol, so a low-alcohol drink is less expensive to the consumer than a 
high-alcohol drink.  Thus, Guiness Stout (and most ordinary bitters) 
have a lower alcohol content than the export versions.  Ordinary bitters 
are the *working man's* beer, and you can quaff a pint or two at lunch 
without being impaired.  The US seems to have a double standard, 
(previously) banning alcohol % on the label while the intent of 
breweries seems to be to supply a reasonable high alcohol product (ice, 
ice light, etc).  NA beer is a novelty-where are low-alcohol beers with 
taste? 
 
Regarding the AHA sniping, whining, and legitimate beef-airing; 
What I see happening is the natural result of the success and popularity 
of homebrewing.  If you had labored for years with no reward as a 
promoter of brewing, wouldn't you have fun running your own little club 
when it goes pop?  A local homebrew retailer calls this *The Golden Age 
of Homebrewing*-you never know what new product or ingredient will 
become available.  And all this success DOES have some up-sides: Better 
ingredients, better information, better equipment.  All of this 
popularity WILL invariably put off the independent types, many of whom 
started the homebrew movement.  Sorry, that is the price of success. 
The same thing happened with the internet-I have hacker friends who 
don't even use browsers-they just surf the old-fashioned way. 
 
In terms of the AHA manipulating or editing the HBD, my experience with 
the government and big corporations suggest that gestapo-type 
surveillance and manipulation is not usually the cause of bad policies 
or customer service-it is usually benign neglect or the squeaky wheel 
getting the grease.  I have found that deliberate oppression requires 
lots of money and lots of organization-2 things that the financially 
struggling, explosively growing AHA does not have.  I guess you can 
defect if you want, but why not move for change in the organization? 
Band together with other homebrew clubs, get an audience with the 
officers, etc.  Show you care, don't just show that you're pissed.  The 
guy who wrote long letters to AHA about backpacks at the GABF was 
thorough and sincere, but he came across as angry and single-issue-like 
(is that a word?).  Enough already-we can use our energy to criticize 
the system, evade the system, or improve the system.  I prefer the 
latter, and non-profit organizations never turn down offers of help

I guess I have to disagree, look at the way a counter-flow chiller 
works.  The cold water in from the fawcet, contacts the coldest part 
of the wort first and migrates to the hot wort in. 
 
If you did it the other way around, you would be chasing the hot wort, 
and this would not be a good thing. 
 
It is the fact that the coldest part of the coil is in the coldest part 
of the wort that allows for efficient chilling, as the wort cools from 
the bottom up it allow more cool water to take heat out of the top. 
 
If you do it the other way around, your sending hot water to the bottom 
of the coil.  This will still work, but your recurulating heat and since 
heat rises, why not let it do the natural thing?

Good morning. 
 
What is the first thing you should buy for your new brewery?  The most 
important? Mills? Mash tuns? Lauter tuns? Kettles?  Plastic ;-) or glass 
fermenters?  Refrigeration? No none of the above. 
 
BOOKS!!!  That is the first item to purchase for your new brewery!!! 
Having taught at the college level I am a firm believer that the only 
stupid question is the one you don't ask.  It is also important to learn 
where to find the answers to stupid questions.  Books are by far the 
least embarrassing way to find the answer to a stupid question.  Before 
you waste the bandwidth on the HBD with a question try to find the answer 
for yourself.  If you don't have the resources to do so then ask the 
question of the group here at HBD.  Remember that many of the answers you 
receive here will be either right, partially incorrect or totally 
incorrect and no one will tell you even if they know the answer.

"I think that two factors are responsible for much of the decline in the 
perceived quality of the HBD since the move to the AOB.  These are: 
 
1. removing the daily distribution limit, and 
2. adding an undigested distribution mode. 
 
A third factor is simply the steadily increasing number of 
subscribers.  Even with the best of intentions on everyone's part, the 
more people subscribe, the more postings will be sent."  <snip> 
 
I AGREE.  Normally, I wouldn't waste bandwidth with a "me too" type of post, 
but I am at the point of unsubscribing unless the situation changes.  It has 
become too time consuming to keep up with HBD.  Two (or more) a day?  Gimme a 
break.  The S/N ratio has gone way up as a result of redundant postings.  It 
also appears that the number of contributors has declined.  Does that tell you 
something? 
 
My local homebrew supplier, Paul Gunn of Gunnbrew, said he rarely reads it 
anymore.  That means he can't contribute either, since he no longer keeps up 
with the discussion.  I don't blame him for tuning out.  People that make beer 
or sell homebrewing stuff for a living work long hours, so I wonder how many 
experts and their expert advice we miss out on because HBD has become such a 
time-consuming bear. 
 
Rob took a long time to build the pieces required to keep HBD manageable for 
both himself and the subscribers.  Why are his scripts, programs or whatever 
not being used by AOB? I know I am not the only person who feels that the size 
limit and ability to cancel posts were an important part of keeping HBD a 
useful, semi-elegant forum for information. Like Spencer said, undigested list 
server format is NOT helping the situation.  The urge to do an immediate reply 
is just too great for some people.  Instead of a "digest", we now get people 
carrying on conversations apparently oblivious to the notion that they could 
use private e-mail instead. 
 
Having the size limit & cancel feature is a bit like traveling with a single, 
small suitcase.  You start packing, and then see what fits, leaving the 
unimportant stuff out.  Not having the size limit & cancel feature is like a 
corporate relocation package where they provide professional packers and 
movers. You let them move EVERYTHING. Even the kitchen trash gets packed in a  
box if you're not paying attention. (BTW, this really happened)  But then you 
have the huge unpacking nightmare from hell, sifting through the crap to find 
the good stuff you need right away. 
 
I, for one, would like to see HBD start packing lightly again.

In reply to Daves Lamentations: 
>I have been trying to get a number which will represent the solubility of 
oxygen 
in water in ppm so I can figure out if 10 ppm is the maximum solubility, 
 
1) Oxygen solubility in water is 2.3 X 10- -5  as mole fraction solubility at 
one atmosphere.( Chem Rubber Handbook p 6-3) To convert this to ppm, a mole of 
water weighs 18 g/ mole so 2.3 x 10- -5 moles of oxygen (2.3 X32X10- -5 ) = 
x1-- -5 g of oxygen in 18 gr of water or 1000000/18 = 55555 so (5.55 X 10- 4 
)X7.36X- -5 = 4.08 grams of oxygen per million grams of water. So the 
solubility of oxygen at RT and 1ATM is 4.08 ppm of oxygen. This is what I 
calculate as thesolubility of oxygen in water. How can a level of 10 ppm be 
achieved unless themeter was wrong or I converted this incorrectly or the 
solubility of oxygen in wort is higher than in water? 
> 
Dear Dave, 
 
Somewhere you must have misplaced a decimal point:  According to my 
calculations: 
 
Mole fraction to Grams solute/liter= 
 
1000 * density of solution * mole fract. * MW solute 
- -------------------------------------------------- 
mole fract. * MW solute + (1-mole fract.)*MW solvent 
 
                         or 
 
    1000 * 1 * 2.3x10--5 * 32 
- ---------------------------------= 0.04089 grams O2 or 40.89 mgs O2 
2.3x10--5 * 32 + (1-2.3x10--5)*18 
 
Since we all know 1 ppm = 1 mg/liter, 2.3x10--5 mole fraction O2 = 40.89ppm. 
 
This figure makes more sense in regards to previously mentioned DO levels 
in cooled wort.

I guess I have to chime in on the chiller thread.  I believe the question is 
whether the inlet water of an immersion chiller should go to the top of the 
cooling coil or the bottom of the cooling coil. 
 
Answer: The inlet should go to the lower coil. 
 
With heat exchangers, when the working (cooling) fluid runs in the opposite 
direction as the flow of the cooled fluid it is called a counterflow heat 
exchanger.  When the working fluid runs in the same direction as the cooled 
fluid it is called a parallel flow heat exchanger.  The counter flow heat 
exchanger has an effectiveness of 0.8 compared to 0.5 for a parallel flow 
heat exchanger (the higher number is better heat transfer). In this case the 
supply water going to the bottom coil is analogous to a counterflow heat 
exchanger since the cooling water is flowing up and the cooling wort is 
flowing down. 
 
These effects may be small, especially in instances where the wort is 
stirred with the chiller or the chiller is flowing fast enough that the 
inlet and outlet temperatures are only a few degrees different.

<BT is nice.  *IF* you are an all grain brewer, or a LARGE scale homebrewer,

<community.  More importantly BT totally ignores the newbie brewer. 
 
As someone who spends a considerable amount of my time writing for BT 
I wanted to respond to this viewpoint. 
 
BT has several regular columns that are in almost every issue. 
 
Home Brewery Basics:  written by HBD contributer and Space Station 
guru John Palmer.  Very accessable information to all levels of brewers. 
Aimed directly at the newer brewers. 
 
My column, Home Brewery Advancement: Here I aim at a bridge between the 
very new brewers and more advanced brewers or even pro/micro brewers. 
I try to mix it up, at times its probably too technical for first year 
brewers but I like to look at this as a way to advance the art, if a 
reader doesnt get it now maybe he would in a year or two.  Some of 
my stuff is dirt simple.  Othertimes its simple but also includes more 
challenging chemistry or techniques.  BTW, Im always looking for feedback 
and suggestions on topics.  This is the hardest part of writing. 
 
Home Brewery Innovation:  occaisonal piece that deals with many facets of 
brewing, often simple home techinques that are worth sharing. 
 
Millers troubleshooter.  You ask the questions, Dave gives his views. 
This reflects all levels of the audience, its up to you. 
 
Brewing In Styles:  Martin Lodahls style column.  Are not all brewers 
interested in this?  Didnt we just have a discussion on IPAs that 
meshed perfectly with Dave Brockingtons writing in this column? 
 
Craft brewery ops:  Norm Pyles reviews and overviews of the industry. 
Are not all brewers interested in this? 
 
Craft brewery marketing:  OK, so maybe this is on the inside for us 
industry folks.  Is it not interesting, how many homebrewers out there 
are dreaming of going pro? 
 
The Last Wort:  somewhat light material very well written by Alan 
Moen.  I also feel this is of great interest to most beer lovers. 
 
Add to this the features that may or may not be of interest to newer 
brewers.  I love the ones on history.  Also they have done a great 
series on the various professional brewing schools in the world.  This 
should be of great interest to homebrewers dreaming of turning pro, 
now or later as reference. 
 
I feel your statement regarding 90% of brewing community is way off 
base.  The subject matter I listed above is good no matter what scale 
one brews in or the sugar source chosen. 
 
There is plenty of general interest material in BT, go find 
me a single magazine that routinely provides this level of information, 
and at a very low price. 
 
I dont think ignoring the newbe brewer is what takes place at Brewing 
Techniques, rather they respect the potential out there for people to 
advance and learn in a positive and often interactive, responsive 
publication.   What they dont do is dumb down the material to knee 
jerk simplistic banter. Oh, and the folks who write for BT do seem 
to actually know a thing or two about beer and brewing.  Many of 
them won awards at the GABF from the North American Guild of Beer 
Writers.

Subject: Re: Primary fermentations and Playdoh

Well, I agree that glass surfaces that you can get to, are capable of being 
mechanically cleaned easily, but, of course, down inside a carboy, even the 
best
carboy brush (of which I own three) has trouble with the sticky, gooey oily 
mess
left over from a primary fermentation. 
 
And, of course, all those bad things you say about plastic apply directly to 
that big friggin' overflow hose which is virtually impossible to clean and if 
you deeply scratch the inside ( say with a bottle brush) of the soft plastic of
which it is made, I agree it can be, and I say is, the major source of 
infection
in the majority of spoiled batches. 
 
My system is to use an open plastic fermenter for the primary fermentation 
which
I can easily clean with bleach and any residual material can be seen and 
removed
mechanically, usually I use a piece of wet paper towel and on occasion a small 
nylon brush. I use a small amount straight bleach directly applied (gloves and 
glasses in place) as a method of dissolving residual stuff after a hot water 
rinse to loosen the majority of the remains of the fermentation. The point is, 
I
can see it and clean it without difficulty.  I don't have to have all my stuff 
sitting around in all that bleach solution for a week to clean it.  I can rack 
from the primary and reload in just a few minutes, if I want to, because I can 
easily clean the primary fermenter.  I would be very happy to use a fermenter 
made of say glass or stainless steel or outer non-porous, non-reactive 
substance
as long as its surfaces were open and accessible to mechanical cleaning and it 
was about 6 gallons or so in volume. Polyethylene plastic is convenient, 
available, light, non-breakable or chippable, chemically non-reactive and 
hasn't
caused me any trouble in 27 years of home brewing. 
 
I sterilize, yes sterilize, with pure bleach ( name me anything that  can 
survive pure bleach), diluted bleach and then boiling or near boiling water ( 
which although it has been kept at 180F for hours, may have a few bugs or 
spores, but not many and unlikely any of interest to us) when I am ready to use
the fermenter.  Although the final product may flt in the "sanitized" class by 
your definition, it is many orders of magnitude away from used beer glasses 
dipped in dilute iodophor or toilet seats, so until a better word is invented 
 ( maybe "santile"?)  I will continue to call this "sterile" as a way of 
distinguishing this virtually, and for all practical beer fermentation 
purposes,
infection-free condition of the equipment. 
 
After the major activity in the primary is finished in 3 to 5 days, I rack the 
still quietly fermenting beer off the trub and yeast residuum to a carboy under
airlock. I am able to have a full five gallons in the secondary because I was 
able to put 5.5 gallons in the primary. 
 
I have been brewing this way since 1969, summer and winter, and have NEVER had 
a
spoiled batch.  I suspect all that trouble you had this summer with spoiled 
batches had more to do with bacteria residing in the crap in the overflow tube 
than the "bad air" you assumed was the cause. 
 
You went a little off the deep end there about plastic lagering and playdoh, I 
wouldn't know much about that and I don't really understand your point. I 
pretty
much follow standard procedure either bottling or kegging my beer as soon as 
the
fermentation has dropped down and Clinitest reads less than 1/4%.   I add a 
krausened starter, made with 1 oz of malt extract and 4 oz of corn sugar, 
actively fermenting with yeast siphoned from the bottom of the secondary, into 
a 5 gallon Corny flushed with CO2, rack the beer from the glass carboy 
secondary, let it sit at 70F for a few days and then, for lagers, put it in the
lagering refrigerator in the 40s and drop the temperature to 33F over a week 
and
let it sit until it is ready. 
 
My point of all this is, if you can't get to the wall of your primary fermenter
easily, to clean it mechanically, you can't clean it easily of solid residue. 
If you can't clean it, you can't sanitize it and for sure not sterilize it. 
Primary fermenting in a carboy with an overflow tube loses out on all counts. 
In my opinion, poorly cleaned carboy primary fermenters and overflow tubes are 
the major source of infection and have ruined more batches of beer than any 
other source.

Subject: Ca++ from Hardness info


Brewsters: 
 
Steve Gravel asks for a recommendation on his water. 
This is a  recurring question here and needs addresssing as 
 best as possible. There are lots better experts on this than I 
 am, but I'll put in my $0.02 just in case they don't have time 
 and don't care to address it from a theoretical perspective. 
 
I also show below how to estimate the calcium ion concentration 
in your water from just a hardness value. 
- -------- 
If you don't want to read it or don't have enough chemistry to understand it , 
page down and just use this formula if you only have hardness information: 
 
To estimate the calcium ion content from hardness only data: 
 
                                  {Ca++} in ppm =  Hardness in ppm /4.14 
- --------- 
The question we all ask is how much and what kind of a 
 calcium salt do I need to add if my analysis shows X? 
 
With few exceptions, you would like about 50 ppm calcium in the mash and a pH 
in
the region of 5.2-5.3. Pilsen breaks this rule because they have soft water AND
low alkalinity and have mashes successfully operating in the region pH= 5.7. 
 
Steve's results on his water 
 
            (values in ppm) 
Alkalinity        1 
PH                6.4 
Hardness         14.7 
Sodium            9 
Magnesium         1.3 
Chloride         14.9 
Iron               .09 
Potassium         2.39 
Sulfate          13.4 
Calcium           3.1 
 
My major comment is the water is very soft 
 ( expressed as hardness in  ppm as CaCO3 
even though it is Mg and Ca) and has very low 
 bicarbonates (expressed as alkalinity in ppm HCO3). 
 
C Papazian in NJHB says: 
 
Hardness   Classification 
0 - 50    Soft 
51 - 110   medium hard 
11- 200   hard 
> 200   very hard 
 
To give you an idea, Pilsen has a calcium content of 
 12 ppm Ca versus your 3 ppm, so your water can 
 be used for all beers with the appropriate 
 adjustment for style, simply by adding the appropriate salt. 
 
An alkalinity ( i.e. a bicarbonate content) greater than 
 100 ppm will alkalize the mash and you would need to add 
 lactic or phosphoric acid or use lots of highly roasted 
 malts to get a pH = 5.2-5.2 in the mash. 
 
To help understand this better and to give you some 
 equations to allow you to do some calculations on your 
 own water I make the following presentation: 
 
Hardness is expressed as ppm CaCO3 as though all 
 the hardness came from Ca.  Alkalinity  is expresssed as ppm HCO3. 
 
Since: 
 
40 is the gram atomic weight for the Calcium 
 plus 60 (the GMW for CO3)  40 +60 = 100 the GMW for CaCO3 
100/40 is the conversion of {Ca++} to {CaCO3} 
 
24 is the gram atomic weight for the Magnesium 
 plus 60 as above = 84, the GMW for MgCO3 
84/24 is the conversion of {Mg++} to {MgCO3} 
 
{CaCO3} + {MgCO3} = Hardness as ppm CaCO3 
 
So to calculate hardness from {Ca++} and { Mg++}: 
 
>From Steve's results: 
 3.1 ppm calcium will give  (100/40)* 3.1 = 2.5 *3.1 = 
7.75ppm of CaCO3 
and 1.3 ppm of MgCO3 will give 
 (84/24)*1.3 = 3.5 * 1.3 =4.55 ppm MgCO3. 
 
 This now neeeds to be corrected from MgCO3 to CaCO3 
 so the ratio CaCO3/MgCO3 =  100/84 = 1.19. 
 
  So 7.75 + 1.19X 4.55 = 7.75 +5.41 = 
 13. 2 ppm of hardness expressed as CaCO3. 
 
 Which is approximately equal to the 14.7 ppm reported as hardness. 
 
The official equation I was given is 
 2.496 X Ca ppm + 4.118 x Mg ppm = Hardness in ppm CaCO3 
 
 this gives 2.496 * 3.1 + 4.118 * 1.3 = 13.1ppm compared to 
 the reported result of 14.7 ppm. 
 
 The Ca multiplier at 2.496 checks with the above number at 2.5. 
 and  the Mg multiplier is 3.5 +X 1.19 =  4.165 which checks with 4.118. 
 
To make sense of your own water analysis: 
 
If you only have a hardness number, 
 assume the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium is in 
 the range 2 to 3 ( i.e. 2.5), so Mg =Ca/2.5 and 
 you can approximate the calcium content close 
 enough for use in brewing with this equation: 
 
If you use the equation above then: 
 
2.5 {Ca++} + 4.1({Ca++}/2.5) = Hardness 
and 
{Ca++} X(2.5+ 4.1/(2.5)) = Hardness 
 
           SO {Ca++} = Hardness/4.14 
 
 which is how I approximate the calcium ion 
 concentration from the hardness value. 
 
 
As a test in Steve's case:  {Ca++} = 14.7/4.14 = 3.5 
 versus the reported value of 3.1. 
 
So it works pretty well in the absence of actual 
measurements of calcium ion concentration 
and is well within normal calcium variations of water supplies.

     I used this procedure for a 15 gallon batch of APA my (then) fiance 
     (now wife) and I brewed to give out as favors at our wedding.  I have 
     a five gal Gott with a slotted copper manifold and a 0.5 barrel 
     boiler.  We did two parallel infusion mashes; one in the Gott, one in 
     a 20 qt SS pot kept in the oven at 'warm', each with 12 pounds of 
     grain.  Drained/Sparged the Gott into the boiler, began the boil, then 
     transferred the grain from the pot into the Gott and lautered the 
     second half.  It worked like a charm; ended up with 15 gal at 1.048. 
 
     Then I realized there was no head space in the boiler, so I drained 
     3.5 gal off and boiled it separately on the stove.  Now, more than 
     ever, I appreciate my propane cooker! 
 
     So, yes, it has been done.  I would do the mashes in parallel rather 
     than in series so that brew day is less than 12 hours! 
 
     Related note:  The beer was a big hit.  However, one confirmed Silver 
     Bullet fan pronounced later "...it was a bit chewy." 
 
 
     Non-related question:  I now have a 5 l minikeg tap and am building an 
     inventory of empty kegs for future brews.  The only brands I can find 
     are Dab, Dinkel Acker and Bitburger.  Anyone else in northern NJ know 
     where I can get something else?  I'm craving a Pale Ale or Stout on 
     tap!
