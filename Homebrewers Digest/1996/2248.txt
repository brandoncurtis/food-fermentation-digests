As a 'newbie brewer' of sorts, (just over two years and 12 batches), who 
*is* interested in 'hydrometers, IBUs and liquid yeast', and who *is* 
reasonable well educated and read...  I find BT utterly useless.  Hence the 
initial paragraph quoted above.  (Which is mine). 
 
An unscientific poll of 'newbie' brewers that I know shows the same feeling.

You have it exactly backwards.  It encounters the coldest wort first 
*because the wort it first encounters has already traveled the whole length 
of the chiller*.  The reason a counterflow chiller is *called* a counterflow 
chiller is because the chilling fluid flows *COUNTER* (I.E. against the flow 
of) to the chilled fluid.

Thats what happens by flowing water into the top of the chiller.  The cooled 
wort sinks, allowing the heated wort to rise and come into contact with the 
coldest part of the chiller.

Except that you are *not conserving water*.  By letting the cold water into 
the bottom, no convection currents form in the wort.  These convection 
currents help stir the wort and speed cooling.  Modulating the water flow 
the ensure maximum outlet temps ensures maximum heat pickup, and cooling. 
Not modulating and flowing the water in from the bottom increases the amount 
of water required.

Nice intuitive analogy, but it does not hold up under analysis.  When cold 
water is introduced at the bottom the cold wort also 'puddles' at the 
bottom.  The temp difference (hence heat xfer) between the upper reaches of 
the coil and the wort is less.  Hence the convection currents do not form as 
strongly.  This results in slower cooling.  (and greater water consumption.) 
 
This was (I believe) proved experimentally here on the HBD some time ago.

Subject: wort chillers


An immersion wort chiller is basically a single pass, crossflow 
heat exchanger.  An in-line chiller (copper tube in garden hose) 
is a single pass counterflow or parallel flow heat exchanger 
depending on which way the wort flows relative to the water. 
 
A counterflow heat exchange is more efficient than parallel since 
the temperature gradient is essentially constant. Based on this, 
one might assume that with an immersion chiller the cold water 
should enter at the bottom of the pot where the cooler wort tends 
to settle and exit at the top by the hot wort, similar to the 
in-line chiller where the cold water enters at the point the cold 
wort exits.  This would help maintain a constant temperature 
gradient. 
 
Unfortunately, this is a simplified model and ignores the 
question of whether this is forced or natural convection.  We 
have natural convection when the immersion chiller just sits in 
the wort, and forced convection when you agitate the chiller to 
create flow over the coils.  When the wort is hot you don't want 
to be mixing the wort to avoid HSA, thus you are relying on 
natural convection. 
 
Natural convection is a function of natural currents set up by 
the cooling wort.  Cooling wort will fall from one coil to the 
next. The faster the current, the faster the cooling, therefore, 
the cold water should enter at the top of the pot to create the 
maximum current of wort over the cooling coils.  A vertical stack 
of coils is better for this because each coils is in the stream 
of cool wort dropping from the top of the pot.  If you are mixing 
the wort (after it has cooled a bit - check out the HSA thread) 
it doesn't matter which end the cold  water comes in, because the 
wort is at a somewhat uniform temperature. 
 
I calculated that 33 feet of 3/8 o.d. copper tubing was required 
to cool 10 gal of wort to 72 F in 15 minutes with 50 F ground 
water flowing at 3.75 gal/min.  In addition, I found it easier to 
clamp 8 or 10 feet of vinyl tube to the copper pipe and attach 
plastic garden hose fittings to the vinyl tube.  This way, if 
you hose attachments leak, it doesn't squirt water into your 
cooled wort. 
 
This is how I calculated the required length: 
 
The mass flow rates are 
 
   5 gal   
 Mwater = --------- x 7.48 lbs/gal x 60 min/hr 
   1.333 min 
 
 Mwater = 1683 lbs/hr 
 
   10 gal 
 Mwort  = ------ x 7.48 lbs/gal x 60 min/hr 
   15 min 
 
 Mwort = 300 lbs/hr 
 
Heat Transfer, q 
 
 q = 300 lbs/hr x 1.00 btu/lbs-F x [212 F - 72 F] 
 
 q = 42000 BTU/hr 
 
The final temp of the water is 
 
   42000 BTU/hr 
 Tfinal,water = --------------  +  50 F 
   1680 BTU/hr-F 
 
 Tfinal,water = 72 F 
 
 
The logarithmic mean temperature difference is 
 
  (212 F - 75 F) - (72 F - 50 F) 
 LMTD =  ---------------------------------- 
  ln[(212 F - 75 F) / (72 F - 50 F)] 
 
 LMTD =  61.4 F 
 
Determine the overall Conductance, U 
 
 I assumed U = 212 BTU/hr-sqft-F for force convection in a 
 cooling application using water to cool a watery solution 
 and assuming clean surfaces. 
 
The heat transfer surface area, A is 
 
      42000 BTU/hr 
 A = -------------------------- 
     212 BTU/hr-sqft-F x 61.4 F 
   
 A = 3.23 sqft 
 
Length of tube, L is 
 
   3.23 sqft 
 L = ------------------------------ 
      3.14159 x 3/8 in x 1/12 in/ft  
 
 L = 33 ft 
  
 
I made my chiller with 22 feet of 3/8 copper tubing and it takes 
about  20 minutes to cool a 10 gal batch if I have the water 
wide open. Typically I let the wort chill to about 100 F without 
moving the chiller. I collect the hot water in a big bucket for 
cleaning etc.  When the  wort gets down to 100 F, I vigorously 
agitate the chiller to speed the cooling and aerate the wort.  So 
far this system has worked out pretty good.  I have an in-line 
chiller as well, but don't like it as much.  It would get plugged 
and in the summer it would not cool the wort below 85 degrees. 
 
Anyway, just my $.02 (more like $.04) on chillers.

Subject: AOB/HBD let's get a grip


Here's the reality: 
 
What many of you are really saying that we need a moderated list. There 
are mailing lists just as active (if not more so) that operate smoothly 
and productively. Unfortunately there are precious few people with the 
time, expertise, and talent to accomplish that. It requires a thorough 
knowledge of the list server software and a good instinct for how to work 
in the foreground and the background to keep the discussions 
well-directed, newbies pointed to relevant information without cluttering 
the list, persistent spammers banned, etc., etc. It is *a lot* of work. 
 
If you have that, it doesn't matter who's system is hosting the list. The 
people who advocate migrating the digest again are not proposing a 
solution to anything. Now if anybody knows a candidate for the moderator 
job, that might be getting us somewhere. 
 
Now, should I understand that when you become an advanced enough brewer, 
you earn the right to grandstand in an international forum to bash 
prominent figures in the homebrew industry in front of thousands of people 
while they're not around? In recent days I have heard Charlie Papazian 
called everything from an exploiter to a drunkard and he was not the only 
victim. Or is it possible that one can be advanced in homebrewing, yet 
lose perspective about what sort of talk is appropriate for the local 
homebrew meeting after you've had a few, and what sort of discussion is 
worthy of this list? 
 
My proposal is that all people who feel they're getting something out of 
their AOB membership remain members, and that others resign. If my 
calculations are correct, that should result in the AOB living or dying on 
the merits. (Note to the revolutionaries: nobody needs your help with this 
decision.) Furthermore, I suggest that anyone who wants to create a new 
organization, or thinks of any other way great way to promote the 
interests of homebrewers, please go off and do it. And don't forget to 
post information here so that we can all check it out. 
 
Now, I place people in jobs for a living so maybe it's more obvious to me 
than to some, but anybody who thinks that the AOB will, or can, or should 
answer any questions as to why they fired one of their employees is 
operating in a very clueless manner. If you were fired, would you expect 
your employer to explain it to anybody who happened to come along and ask? 
They won't explain it because it's none of your business. Any implications 
posted should be understood by all for what they are -- either innuendo or 
one side of the story.

Part of my BT experiment was to see if proteins were lost during blowoff. 
In the finished beer, the head retention was the same regardless of whether 
the blowoff method was used or whether the dirty head was allowed to fall 
back into the fermenting beer.  The tests done by Siebel showed that there 
was very little difference in total protein levels between the two methods. 
 
I believe I only had one or two sentences on head retention in the summary 
section.  This is partly because the tests done by Siebel were not definitive 
 -- they grouped all the proteins together although the head-retaining 
proteins could have made up most of the protein lost.  It may be just that 
there simply were enough proteins and a small loss did not affect head 
retention.  My personal gut feeling is that head retention is not 
significantly affected by the blowoff method.

Subject: Vitaminize your Barley wines


Brewsters: 
 
Part I 
My phone has been out since Sunday and is just now fixed - whatever day this is
being sent.  Sorry if this is a little out of sequence. 
 
Robert Waddell, Spencer Thomas and I have been having discussions about a paper
published by Morse, et al on speeding up mead fermentations using buffers or 
sequential daily additions of CaCO3 to keep the pH of mead in the range of 3.7 
to 4.0. Morse, et al claim that, in the case of mead ( known to take months to 
ferment in some cases), a fermentation can be completed in 2 weeks.  Robert's 
point was that this may work for barley wines and for high gravity stouts as 
well and wondered how the addition of CaCO3 would taste.  I responded to that 
question, but didn't have a copy of the paper to refer to. 
 
Robert sent me a paper frustrated by the unavailability of the chemicals used 
in
the paper.  When I looked at it, I realized that one shouldn't look in a 
chemical supply catalog nor at your HB shop but in your medicine cabinet.  The 
Table 3 containing these formulae from Morse, et al is published below. 
 
I'm not sure the buffer Formula 1 is necessary  in imperial stouts and barley 
wine uses. I measured the pH of my Imperial Stout ( OG =1.077) and it was 4.3 
near the end of the fermentation.  Try just adding the B vitamin preparation 
first. Formula 1 will likely be necessary in meads ( as Morse says) which have 
little buffering capacity and the pH falls too low for the yeast to metabolize 
the sugars. 
 
Formula 1 appears to be pretty much a standard phosphate/citrate buffer except 
for the NH4 Sulfate and NH4 Bisulfate and the MgCl2. These inclusions could be 
there to feed the yeasts nitrogen and magnesium, but it makes me suspicious 
that
this is a preparation available over the counter for stomach or intestinal 
problems. I don't know if this is sold as antacid preparations or not. 
Phosphate/citrate buffers like these are used in pH meter calibration, I 
believe.  Just be careful that the preparation you get does not have 
preservatives in it as many such calibration buffers do. That's why I suggest 
to
look in your pharmacy, at least you will be using something intended to be 
ingested. Talk to your pharmacist, he may know of something like this. Some of 
the citrate buffers are used as fast acting laxatives, I believe. What their pH
is, I don't know. Test the preparation by measuring its pH in water to be sure 
it is doing what you want. If you have some solid info on various preparations 
let us know. . 
 
In the last column of the table below, I have put in the common definition for 
the contents of Formula 2. If you look at a B vitamin bottle you will see these
things in just about these quantities. I am guessing that the sodium bisulfate 
is the pill base, but if someone has solid info on this, let's hear it. 
 
Realizing that this is an untested thing, some of you may wish to try to speed 
up your barley wine and stouts by applying this technology. So here goes the 
suggestion of what to try.  Be sure to report back to the HBD on both positive 
and negative results. 
 
The paper by Morse recommends to use  6.75 g/l  (1oz/US gal) of formula 1 and 
0.25 g/l  (0.035 Oz/US gal) of formula 2 
 
The formula 2 weighs 1 gram, so the authors probably used a vitamin pill 
weighing a gram. Use one pill per 4 liters or one gallon or 5 of these for a 20
l or five gallon batch. The label on the bottle will tell you how much of each 
is in the pill. I suggest you purchase the most concentrated B vitamin pill so 
as to reduce the pill base contents in the wine/mead. Basically the authors are
recommending one quarter of formula 2 per liter or all of formula 2 per gallon.
I suspect getting every vitamin in exactly this concentration is not important.
If you are really concerned about this, buy the separate B vitamin pills and 
make up your own mixture. 
 
Keep on brewin'

Meads and light wines are particularly susceptible to this problem since they 
do
not have an adequate buffer system to handle the acids formed during 
fermentation.  For normal beers it seems that the system is OK, but for the 
higher alcohol beers and barleywine, fermentation can slow to a ridiculously 
frustrating speed.  To my knowledge, this has always been blamed on the high 
alcohol content "poisoning" the yeast and slowing it down. 
 
This pH effect may be caused by removing the B vitamins from the playing field 
by protonation ( a speculation) or slowing down autolysis ( also a speculation)
to prevent the re-introduction of B vitamins inside dead yeast cells may be an 
explanation. As you likely know, brewers yeast is an excellent source of B 
vitamins, which means that even if the yeast generate these vitamins, they keep
them. With all of it lying on the bottom as a yeast floc, there may be none in 
the fermenting beverage. A skewed up synthesis via starved metabolic pathways 
in
the yeast may explain the funky taste often found in barley wine and high 
gravity stouts and beers which had a slow secondary fermentation.  A taste 
comparison may be in order between high OG barley wines with and without B 
vitamins. 
 
M&BS says P91 
"....barley and malt are rich sources of other vitamins and generally these are
concentrated in the living tissues, the embryo and aleurone........ 
 
Meso-inositol an ultimate product of hydrolysis of phytic acid (( acid rest or 
calcium ions anyone??)) is a growth factor for yeast..........the B complex 
have
been studied ....... riboflavin,pantothenic acid,the pyroxidin, pyroxidal, and 
pyridoxiamine group .........The vitamins of the B group are highly important 
as
growth factors for yeast during fermentation, particularly biotin, inositol and
pantothenic acid. 
 
Other vitamins include folic acid or related substances, nicotinic acid and 
thiamin. " 
 
My suggestion: 
 
Measure the pH of your stout or barleywine and if it is below 3.5 or so, adjust
it with CaCO3 repeatedly on a daily basis or with a buffer system.  Add the 
vitamins if you don't get any positive result from the pH adjustment ( the low 
pH may be tying up certain of these vitamins as the protonated form, so 
adjusting the pH may free them up - just a speculation).  After doing this and 
the fermentation finishes, you may have to adjust the acidity of the finished 
product ( especially the mead) with tartaric or some other food acid to get the
crispness you may desire.

Subject: re: Killer Chiller Question


 
Arnold - 
 
 
 
When comparing a counterflow chiller to an immersion chiller you are 
comparing two different kinds of heat systems.  An immersion chiller 
operates in a closed system.  All that matters is that the maximum heat is 
transfered into the cooling water before the cooling water 
makes it's exit.  As time progresses the temperature of the entire heat 
system drops lower and lower. Length of the cooling coils matters.  If 
you wait until the end of the loop to begin cooling the hottest part 
of the wort you've essentially reduced the cooling length of your 
coils. With a counterflow chiller a heat differential is maintained 
throughout the path of the flowing liquids.  What's important is that 
the maximum heat be transfered out of the wort before it makes an exit. 
Obviously, pumping the hot exit water next to the exiting wort won't work, 
you'd be heating the wort! 
 
>It is the fact that the coldest part of the coil is in the coldest part

Forget about convection, you're cooling the entire heat vessel over time. 
Hottest wort with coldest water = more efficient heat transfer.  With the 
counterflow chiller you're not cooling the entire heat vessel.  You're 
cooling the cross section of wort that leaves the chiller.  You do that 
with *cold* water. 
 
Sorry to blabber so long, I just wanted to point out some differences 
between counterflow and immersion chillers.

Subject: An international forum?


I would like to raise the community's awareness of the fact that this forum 
is being read but brewers all over the world.  Ought we not acknowledge the 
fact the besides the USA and UK not too many other countries use units like 
quarts, gallons, pounds and degrees F (any even then USA and UK can't agree 
on how much a gallons is!).  Is it not time for us to start converting our 
recipes and equipment designs to Kilograms, Litres, Metres and degrees C? 
 With a metric system of measurement and internationally recognised units 
for colour and bitterness, we'd all find it easier to interpret each others 
recipes etc.

Subject: Krausening (Priming)


Charlie P. in TCJOHB speaks of krausening, or priming the beer for 
bottling with unfermented wort rather than corn sugar or dry malt. He 
gives a "simple" calculation as to how much to use based on specific 
gravity. 
 
Has anyone tried this? And is there an even easier rule of thumb? I 
understand the concept Charlie is promoting, but it would appear that if 
there is a standard amount of corn sugar (3/4 c) or dried malt (1 1/4 c) 
that he offers, and these amounts do not depend on specific gravity, why 
should wort? 
 
BTW, my first "no-sparge" batch is sitting in the bottles for the first 
time this week. My idea in the above question is that if I like the 
no-sparge results, I might sparge and boil down enough wort to try 
krausening.

Subject: Red beer


I'm a homebrew rookie, and I have a few questions. 
 
1.  My favorite commercial beers are Rickards Red and Killians Irish Red. 
Does anyone have a recipe that comes close to either of these beers? 
 
2.  What ingredient(s) give a beer it's red colour?  I've read about various 
kinds of malts in Millers Homebrewing Guide, but I've not read about any 
specific malts that will impart a red colour to the beer.  I'm assuming it's 
malts that will do this, but please correct me if I'm wrong. 
 
3.  Regarding immersion wort chillers - are these home made items?  It seems 
to me that it would be fairly easy to make one with a coil of copper tubing 
and the proper connectors. 
 
Thanks!

I had the same problem.  Actually, it was on my second one, so I knew that 
it wasn't supposed to do that.  I called Jess at Alternative Beverage (where 
I purchased it) about this.  He contacted the manufacturer, Liquid Bread. 
 Apparently, they had some production problem with a certain batch of these. 
 I guess that we both got one of the defective Carbonators.  I was given an 
address for Liquid Bread to return the defective part.  In return, they sent 
me a replacement PLUS a free one for my trouble.  While I wasn't 
particularly happy to spend good money on something that didn't work, I am 
satisfied with the resolution.  My advise, contact your supplier (if you 
didn't get it from Liquid Bread).  In any case, I would expect whoever you 
bought it from to stand behind the merchandise.

Special Thanks to dave burley again. Your public email address still comes

Im brewing again today (Friday)--Aussi lager. I've never tried 
anything this pale before, any secreats? (Still extract/ partial mash) Also 
while reading another of your threads (Chuck's) You or chuck were refering to 
doing a "mash-in" and a Mash-out. I thought i was pretty ready to go all 
grain, but these terms confuse me. would you mind obliging me with a little

  Hey, 
 
  I don't want to make this a long drawn-out thread, but I feel the 
  urge to respond to Scott's scathing retort to my post about 
  all-grain brewing. 
 
  Of course you can make good beer with extract.  You can make 
  wonderful beer with extract.  You can make beers true to style 
  (although I'm an iconoclast when it comes to totalitarian style 
  adherence, I say style be damned, make what you like, but that's 
  another argument). 
 
  And... you may be right, someone who wanted to enjoy the 
  completeness of brewing art may want to grow their own hops and 
  grain (and some of you do that just for that reason, don't you?) 
 
  My point (ok, it was obscure) was that we're in this for the 
  enjoyment of the experience to craft beer.  Many people get the 
  "longing/call/urge" to go all-grain.  My guess is that happens 
  because of a desire to make a better product, but maybe more 
  importantly to be able to better experience the production.  So.... 
  if you get the urge, go all-grain, it's a brave new world.  BUT... 
  if you don't get the urge, who cares?  Brew good beer, but above 
  all..enjoy the experience, make it fun.  Reduce stress.  Be nice to 
  each other.. (yadda yadda yadda). 
 
  P.S.  What are all these posts with no subject and no text?  Is this 
  the Silent Majority finally speaking up? 
 
 
  Brew happy,

Does anybody know who sells a Dual Control Thermostat for a 
refrigerator. I saw them for sale at one time. One with a plug for a 
cooling source and a plug for a heating source. Here in Wisconsin 
we can't brew in a refrigerator in a refrigerator in the garage in 
the winter without a heat source. I have tried a controller with 
only a cooling source and a blacklight always on inside the 
refrigerator, but that isn't very reliable. A while back someone 
else asked this same question and I found no responses.

Subject: Think Positive/Thanks HBD


  I appreciate Tom Penn's comments about the AHA and the HBD.  There 
seem to be too many negative posts about AHA, HBD, Papazian, personal 
attacks, etc. Poor AlK recently took a lot of slams about his copyright, 
etc.  Probably new people who hadn't noticed that AlK makes a regular 
infomative contribution to the HBD.  So does Dave Burley and fortunately 
they took their disagreement offline which is a great practice that I've 
noticed many other contributors do to hash out a consensus before 
posting the results to the HBD. 
    Many of the posts are ideas or opinions that work for some people 
but not for others.  Fine! Before you argue with someone stop and 
realize there are many styles, opinions, etc. out there and they are ALL 
CORRECT.  Some people are out to get the most effeciency, match a 
particular style, etc. while others are just trying to make good beer 
and enjoy homebrew as a hobby.  Everyone wants to learn more and I 
sincerely appreciate the information in the HBD even if many posts are 
repetitive.  Maybe that could be improved with the cancel feature.  By 
the way what are all the empty "none" submissions about? 
    Bill Giffin mentions reading books and I agree that books are a good 
thing but I'd like to add that there are outdated techniques and errors 
in some books.  The HBD makes a nice compliment because you get so many 
diverse opinions as well as getting up to date information. 
    Lastly thanks to all for comments on my recent Irish Chocolate Stout 
(with Java). It's fermenting now with Wyeast 1084 and it smelled/tasted 
good at pitching time.  When it turns out I'll repost that recipe and 
the procedure I used.

Subject: Help: boiling, cooling, transfering!


I recently got my hands on a large boiling pot with a spichot at the 
bottom. After boiling, I am planning on creating a 'closed' system by 
connecting my wort chiller to this pot and transferring the beer directly 
to a carboy equipped with a carboy stopper that has two holes (one for 
incoming liquid and one for outgoing air via airlock). I then plan on 
letting the trub settle for an hour and transferring beer to a second 
carboy, leaving the trub behind. 
 
Now, my questions: First, how does this sound overall? Second, considering 
the spichot is at the very bottom of the pot, is there a way I can filter 
out the hot break (I use hop pellets) so that the spichot or wort chiller do 
not clog? Third, will the hour of settling in the carboy be enough? 
 
Thanks in advance and cheers!
