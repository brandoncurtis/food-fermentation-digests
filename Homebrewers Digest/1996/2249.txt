     Smoked ales, specifically Scottish smoked ales, are my new object of 
     attention.  What experience do you fellow homebrewers have with 
     peat-smoked malt? 
 
     Smoked ales generally have 2 lbs (or so) smoked malted barley, and are 
     smoked with fruit wood or beechwood (according to the Cat's Meow and 
     the Victory Circle recipe book).  An article on Scottish Ales (SAs)in 
     Brew Your Own stated that peat-smoked malt was mistakenly used in 
     certain brewer's recipes for SAs, and the brewer's ended up with 
     something they couldn't give away.  (BTW, the article noted that the 
     "smoky" flavor in the beer was actually from roasted barley). 
 
     With all due respect, I'm forging forward with peat-smoked malted 
     barley.  Why?  Because the ingredients listed for the Sam Adams 
     Scottish Ale (which I would gladly drink, whether or not the brewer 
     gave it to me) included peat-smoked malt as one of the ingredients 
     (along with 2-row, chocolate, crystal, and munich - it is left as a 
     reader's exercise to find the hops used.  Hint: go to Sam Adams home 
     page on the 'net). 
 
     One fine storekeep noted that peat-smoked barley should be used 
     sparingly, like 1/4 lbs in a 5-gallon recipe, and increment by 1/4 lbs 
     if it is not enough.  He was quite sure that using two lbs in a recipe 
     would be WAY TOO MUCH. 
 
     Any help would be appreciated.

     P.S. Why are homebrews better than sex?  You can have as many kinds of 
     homebrew as you want, and it won't keep the neighbors awake.

"...honest ociffer that horse was dead before I hit him..." 
 
What I was attempting to say, and what I think Derek & Scott may have missed 
was: I think of myself as a fairly decent cook, able to follow a recipe, 
able to modify one to suit my needs, etc. Extract brewing is just about 
exactly that. I make GREAT beers with the extract method. Brewing beer after 
all isn't all that hard.I was just trying to let others like myself know 
that extract is fine , but go to liquid yeast and full wort boil asap to 
make a better beer. I fully intend to go all-grain, hopefully next batch. 
What I meant by Zen Master was that there are a few brewers on this digest 
that are way beyond even all-grain. I refer you to any postings by Messrs. 
Burley, Bayer, "Gump", or Korzonas. 
And to the provincial bastards that keep complaining about the signal/noise 
ratio here: If it is dry, strictly-to-the-point, no fun BS you're after buy 
a book,get a magazine, go to the library, or call another brewer. There is 
no seniority here. Just because you can remember the 'good old days' doesn't 
mean shit, I like this forum for all the reasons you don't. It's the ability 
to get advice from the Zen Masters,or any one, and have immediate, vibrant 
feedback that make this so appealling.

Concerning a recent post by Dave Burley on the Pasteur effect and the 
Crabtree effect ... 
 
I believe that your selective quotations from M&BS may lead to some 
misunderstanding of the Pasteur effect and Crabtree effect and their 
importance to fermentation. 
 
Pasteur originally discovered that in air, yeast reproduce rapidly but 
produce little carbon dioxide and ethanol and consume little sugar; 
without air, yeast reproduce more slowly, but produce more carbon 
dioxide and ethanol and consume more sugar.  A modern definition of 
the Pasteur effect, based on our more complete understanding of 
biochemistry, is the "inhibition of glycolysis (breakdown of sugar) by 
respiration".  The basic observation is that lowering the oxygen 
concentration decreases carbon dioxide production only to a point.  As 
oxygen gets very low, carbon dioxide production actually increases.  The 
products of cellular respiration actually inhibit glycolysis, so that 
producing less ATP allows glycolysis to go faster.  An important effect 
is the inhibition of phosphofructokinase, a regulatory enzyme in 
glycolsyis, by ATP.  (I'm afraid I've already lost many readers, so I 
won't go into more detail.) 
 
It was subsequently noted that when the sugar concentration gets very 
high, ethanol fermentation actually increases!  Given what we know 
about the mechanism of the Pasteur effect (ATP inhibits glycolysis), 
this observation may seem surprising.  This effect -- called the Crabtree 
effect -- was once thought to be catabolite repression by glucose.  Many 
biochemists now believe it is mostly due to over-saturation of the 
respiration reactions.  The argument is that there's so much flowing 
through glycolysis that some of it just spills over into the fermentation 
pathway. 
 
Dave ... Thanks for jogging my memory about the Pasteur and Crabtree 
effects, something I haven't thought about for years! 
 
Cheerio!

Subject: Technical Assistance Requested


As those of you attending the recent Dixie Cup in Houston may have learned, 
fellow Foam Ranger Andy Thomas and
I are in the process of doing an article to be published in Brewing Techniques 
on RIMS vs. Decoction mashing.
In a very terse nutshell, Andy and I each brewed a high gravity (13P) / low hop
(23 IBU) Munich Helles
simultaneously using the same recipe, grain, hops, "built" water, boil times, 
adjusted pre- and post-boil OG's
and volumes, etc., etc., etc. -- with the goal that the only significant 
variable would be that his batch was
a traditional double decoction mash, while mine was a modified Fix 50-60-70 
stepped mash on my RIMS system.
The batches were then innoculated using equal parts (2q) of the same yeast 
starter, and then fermented and
stored in the same refrigerator. The resulting products (both quite good) were 
then evaluated "blind" by the
Best of Show panel at the Dixie Cup. 
 
Many of the results of this experiment were both surprising and 
counterintuitive (read the BT article when it
comes out for the whole story), and so we are looking to do a followup 
experimental brew (which will probably
also include a traditional step infusion mash for comparison). Per Dr. Paul 
Farnsworth's advice, we would
like to have an ogliosaccaride assay and protein assay performed on samples of 
the pre- and post- boil worts
we generate, with the aim of explicating the differences and similiarities we 
obtain. The problem is, of
course, such tests require >$50,000 of lab equipment, and would run several 
hundred dollars if done by Seibel
or an equivalent lab. 
 
Ergo, if you are a professor / grad student / professional chemist with access 
to the necessary equipment and
would like to assist us in this experiment, please drop me a line. 
 
Additionally, if anyone has access to a copy of the American Society of Brewing
Chemists' *Methods of
Analysis* (>$400, and according to the OCLC not available in *any* library in 
Texas), please drop me a line.

This is absolutely off track. 
 
I have created beers from scratch using extract, and the process is no 
different than creating beers from scratch using all-grain.  I choose the 
malts, (extract rather than grains, but there are a *lot* of extracts to 
choose from.), specialty grains, hops, yeasts, adjuncts......  I decide the 
steep/sparge sequence for the specialty grains and adjuncts, the hop 
schedule, the fermentation method and sechedule..... 
 
With the sole exception of the source of the sugars, there is no difference 
in the recipe formulation process.

Enter the present writer: 
 
Seems to me that the cold should go into the top first. However, I don't 
quite accept Ken's argument based on convection. Why? If you cool the top of 
the wort, where the hotter wort is, a bit faster than you cool the bottom of 
the wort, where the cooler wort is, what do you get? In fairly short order, 
the wort is going to be roughly monothermatic. With no distinctions in 
gradient, there will be little or no convection based on thermal dynamics. 
Just static. That picture will change as time goes on, and the top will 
begin to get cooler and convection will occur, but 1) probably late enough 
in the cooling process that convection is not a major player and 2) the 
convection will be minor, because cooling is taking place at the bottom of 
the pot as well, if a bit slower. The gradient just isn't going to be that 
great, once the cooling process takes hold. 
 
The reason for cooling from the top down is simply that the greater the 
temperature difference between A and B, the greater the cooling that occurs 
per time unit. 
 
At least, that's how it looks from this keyboard at the moment.

>Somewhere you must have misplaced a decimal point: 
 
Yes, he did:  2.3 x 32 x 10-5 = 7.36 x 10^-4 g oxygen (not 10^-5) 
 
That explains the 4.08 ppm instead of 40.8 that is the correct value. 
 
Note, however, that this is the solubility that in equilibrium with PURE 
OXYGEN at 1 atmosphere.  In our pressure ranges, the equilibrium solubility 
varies linearly with the oxygen pressure, so aerating with air would result 
in 21% of the value calculated: 
           Saturation with air = 0.21 x 40.9 = 8.59 
Solubility in wort is less than that in pure water due to all of the other 
dissolved compounds.

On the AHA hosting the digest- 
        The only differences in operation of the digest with the AHA are 
that the digest can be received undigested and the lack of a cancel 
feature.  The lack of civility on the digest is not the AHA's fault.  Have 
you noticed how many people can't seem to disagree without name-calling? 
Is the AHA adding the personal attacks as some sort of sinister conspiracy? 
Yeah, right.  More people need to re-read their posts to make sure they 
are acting like adults.  If you want to call someone names or throw a 
tantrum, do it in private e-mail or write it all out and then delete it. 
Call it therapy.

Glitches in the digest- 
        Hey you at the AOB - what's with all the blank space?  I'm wearing 
out my page down key! 
- ------------------------------------------- 
 
On Immersion chiller inlets point for cooling water- 
        I bet it doesn't matter in practice.  Theoretically, the bottom 
inlet would be better, but if you stir the wort at all (i.e., move the 
chiller around) the temperature stratification in the wort would be 
minimal. 
        Anybody have too much time on their hands and want to prove me wrong?

Regarding the discussion that has been occuring off-line between Dave 
Burley and a few others, the article that started it all can be found at: 
www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/gfc/mead/danspaper.html 
 
It has to do with (among other things) keeping the pH of fermenting 
mead must between pH 3.7 - 4.0, and vitamins being used to get a high 
O.G. must to drop in about 2 weeks.  The discussion has been about 
perhaps using this method in high gravity beer worts.  Experimental 
results may follow in a few months.  (When I find time to do another 
high O.G. beer.) 
 
I recomend the article even if you're not interested in the discussion.

Subject: No Subject Repost - Extract-to-AllGrain and Hops Steeping Question


What's up with this No Subject crap?  My two posts yesterday got eaten by 
them.  Here they are again (I hope). 
 
Ron asks about converting from extract to all grain. 
 
Problem with going that direction is that unless you're using plain pale 
extract, it's hard to tell what went into the extract to make it whatever it 
is.  And even "plain pale extract" could be any number of things. 
 
If the extract you have in mind is supposed to yield a beer of a particular 
beer "style" (pale ale, pilsner, stout, whatever), your best bet IMHO is to 
chuck it and start from scratch.  Pull a bunch of Cat's Meow recipes and find 
the similarities, as a starting point.  For example, with a stout, you'll 
typically find pale malt and some roasted barley in many/most of the recipes. 
 One recipe will add crystal while another adds chocolate, but the common 
thread here would be the pale (of course) and the roasted barley. 
 
If you're talking about the real generic "light", "amber", and "dark" stuff, 
that's a different story.  An amber wort can be made from pale malt + crystal 
or pale malt + chocolate malt or all-Munich malt, among a million other 
combinations.  Each of these may look like the other, but the flavors will be 
very different.  Point is, unless you have a flavor profile in mind, 
converting "amber extract" to all-grain will be a crapshoot. 
 
As an example, let's assume I want to convert a recipe calling for amber 
extract.  To find the amount of grain to use, I start with a given amount of 
"X" extract.  If it's dry (DME) I would assume say 42 points per pound per 
gallon; if liquid (LME), maybe 36.  If pale grain yields say 36 pt/lb/gal and 
your efficiency is 75%, that's 27 points for a pound of grain.  So for DME, 1 
lb of DME = 42/27 = 1.56 lb grain; for LME, it's about 1.33 lb.  So if the 
recipe called for 6 lb DME, I'd use 6 x 1.56 = about 9 to 9-1/2 lb grain. 
 
Next, adjust the color using hand calculations or (better) a recipe program 
like Suds.  If you want color but neutral flavor, try small amounts of 
roasted grains (2 - 4 oz per batch perhaps).  Roasted grains will give you 
lots of color with very little grain.  For a sweeter finish try using medium 
to dark crystal malt.  For a bigger malty finish use maybe Munich or 
Aromatic.  Of course to get a little of each of these effects, you can 
combine the aforemetioned malts...hey, now you're getting the hang of recipe 
formulation!! 
 
{The 1995 Special Issue of Zymurgy has a comprehensive table of grain yields 
& colors for your reference.  I've also put these into Suds database form 
(along with hops data) on my web page.} 
 
If the original extract recipe called for steeping grains in addition to the 
extract, it complicates things.  Again you'll have to sort of imagine the 
flavor being developed, and work that into the all-grain recipe design. 
 However, by adding grains, the recipe's author is probably making up for 
something lacking in the extract, so it might be fair to assume that a 
neutral extract conversion is appropriate. 
 
BTW, visit my web page (address below) for an article I wrote on the reverse 
process -- all-grain to extract. 
 
***** 
 
In that ongoing quest for Nice Hop Character (NHC) I tried a post-boil steep 
of 1 oz Liberty hops (4.x% AA I think) in an otherwise lightly-hopped (25 
IBU) ale.  I was disappointed at the lack of results.  I have two conjectures 
as to why this is:  (a) not enough hops or (b) the fact that I started 
immersion-chilling right away.  Should I let it steep at sub-boiling for a 
while before turning on the water?  Commercial breweries use in-line 
counterflow chillers so the wort in contact with the steeping hops is hot for 
a long time.  For us immersion-chill types, how long is long enough? 
 
And while we're at it, I have another conjecture to toss out for comment. 
 The batch previous to this last one was also hopped in the mid-20's and of 
similar graivty, though sweeter.  I dryhopped with 1/2 oz Goldings, which did 
a fine job of adding hop aromatics but also seemed to increase the 
*bitterness*!  I suppose the arome/volatiles fill out the overall taste 
sensation, so it may be more hop *flavor* that I'm getting, but it sure seems 
the bitterness is up too.  Any thoughts? 
 
PS -- Lest you think I'm heretically shunning the Wall of Hops approach to 
brewing, well, I sorta am, at least on an experimental basis.  Having had one 
too many hop-tea IPA's at club meetings the last couple months, I though I'd 
try brewing a couiple using the "balanced beer chart" in Norm Pyle's 
wonderous Hop FAQ at The Brewery.  For beers in the 40's of OG, 25 IBU was 
supposedly about right for "balance".  I brewed a sweetish brown ale (7 lb 
Pale Ale 2-row + 1-1/2-lb 75L crystal, Goldings hops) and a "buttered-toast" 
ale (7 lb PA, 1 lb Munich, 1 lb home-toasted PA, 1 lb 10L crystal, Liberty 
hops, Irish yeast) both at this level and am pleased with the overall 
flavors, though the hophead in me will crank up closer to 30 the next time 
around.  My conclusion from this experiment -- there is a non-linear 
realtionship between IBU's and bitterness sensation; the difference between 
20 and 30 IBU is seemingly much greater than between 30 and 40 IBU.

Subject: Heat Exchanger Low-Down


Hello, all - this is my first post to the digest.  I'm an avid homebrewer who 
has been extract brewing for the last 8 years or so, and am just getting ready 
to move up to all-grain, along with some friends of mine. I'm fascinated by the
discussion on Wort chillers, and thought I'd add my 2 centimes. I come at this 
from a technical perspective, as I am a Chemical Engineer, and this kind of 
heat exchange stuff is pretty basic engineering. 
 
First, some comments on previous posts:

Clearly, this is _not_ true.  If the cold temperature out is very close to the 
cold temperature in, that just means that the amount of water being sent 
through he cooler is probably much larger than it needs to be.  If there is a 
temperature difference between the cooling water and the wort, there will 
be heat transferred.

This is only true if the wort is absolutely unstirred. Assuming the water temp 
is always at least 10 deg. below the wort, you will continue to get reasonable 
heat transferred.

Correct - a counterflow heat exchanger has the hot fluid inlet and the cold 
fluid outlet at the same end.  This produces the largest _average_ 
difference in temperature over the length of the chiller. 
 
Although the temperature difference is important in heat exchange, there are 
two other factors that effect the rate of heat transfer.  The easiest one to 
get a handle on is the area available for heat transfer.  For an immersion 
chiller, this translates to building the largest coil that you can immerse 
in your wort.  It also means that if you are building a coiled chiller, you 
should space the coils a reasonable distance apart, so that the entire 
circumference of the tube, along the entire length is in contact with the 
wort, not with another part of the tube. 
 
That being said, the final factor that is often overlooked in these chiller 
designs, is that the heat transfer is affected by a series of resistances 
that combine to form a heat-transfer coefficient.  The primary resistances 
for a simple tube-type heat exchanger is the wall of the exchanger, and the 
fluid film resistance both inside and outside of the tube.  Heat (energy) 
has to flow through each of these resistances in series, so that if one of 
them is very large, then the overall heat transfer will be slowed.  The wall 
of the tube 
resistance has to do with the type of metal used for its constuction.  Since 
the standard for homebrewing seems to be Copper, which has a high 
conductivity, and thus a low resistance, that should be fine.  For an 
immersion chiller, the water flowing on the inside of the tube has a very 
thin film if it's flowing rapidly enough, so that resistance should be 
small.  The problem comes with the outside of the tube where the wort is 
just sitting there, with some possible natural convection going on.  Here 
the film can be relatively thick, and there can be a high resistance to heat 
transfer. 
 
The obvious solution is that you _must_ agitate the wort in some way to 
achieve high rates of heat transfer  Now I know that you don't want aeration 
in the wort, but you can still mix the fluid without aeration - look into 
using an impeller type mixer, and run it at low RPM.  Any amount of forced 
convection (stirring) in the wort will improve the heat transfer over 
natural convection.  Another added bounus is that you no longer have to 
worry about the direction of flow in your chiller coil, since if the wort is 
considered "well mixed" it 
should be the same temperature at all points.  Like I agreed with before, if 
you don't want to mix your wort, the coldest part of the coils should be at 
the bottom of the vessel to get the largest _average_ temperature difference 
across the coil.

Subject: Call To Newbies!


Derek Lyons Writes: 
As a 'newbie brewer' of sorts, (just over two years and 12 batches), who 
*is* interested in 'hydrometers, IBUs and liquid yeast', and who *is* 
reasonable well educated and read...  I find BT utterly useless.  Hence the 
initial paragraph quoted above.  (Which is mine). 
 An unscientific poll of 'newbie' brewers that I know shows the same feeling. 
 
To which I respond: 
Derek, as the author/Column Editor for Homebrewery Basics, the "beginners" 
Column, I am very interested in what kind of material you would like to see 
covered. I am interested in what Every new brewer would like to see. Email me 
at
johnj`at`primenet.com with your suggestions for topics. What is it Derek, that in 
particular you find so utterly useless? The topics? the depth? Is it because 
you
learn the same things in HBD? 
 
I have felt that my predecessor, Don Put, did a marvelous job of presenting key
material for new brewers. I am attempting to continue with the same level of 
quality information. But it is tough to think of topics. It can be difficult to
differentiate between beginner and advanced material, oftentimes it will depend
solely on a reader's particular interests. 
 
I would like to ask that anyone who has an interest in seeing beginner brewing 
topics addressed in Brewing Techniques, email me. There are a number of regular
homebrewing authors in the HBD, Jeff Frane, Kirk Fleming, Jim Busch, Norm Pyle,
Martin Lodahl, just to name a few. We would like to bring the same level of 
good
information to mass market publications that is provided to the HBD. Feedback 
other than 'Utterly Useless' is always appreciated.

Subject: RE: Kraeusening / Removal of trub / Chiller flow


     Hi all! 
 
     Mike asks about kraesening.  He wonders why it is dependent on the 
     gravity of the wort, while priming with sugar is not. 
 
     Kraeusening is not only dependent on the starting gravity of the wort, 
     but also on its final gravity.  The wort will contain both fermentable 
     and unfermentable sugars, therefore it is important to know how much 
     FERMENTABLE sugar you are adding to the wort in order to predict 
     carbonation levels.  Corn sugar is glucose, which is 100% fermentable. 
 
     You can easily determine the fermentability of your wort, and kraeusen 
     it, by using the following method: 
 
     Prepare to save some wort on brew day.  Using the formula in Eric 
     Warner's book, "German Wheat Beer", you can estimate how much wort 
     you'll need to save for krausening.  You need to know the starting and 
     final gravities of the wort.  You can make an educated guess about the 
     final gravity, based on your mash temp, yeast strain, and experience. 
     After calculating the amount of wort that you'll need, add another 
     12-20 ounces to that figure, just in case (you might drop some, etc.). 
 
     After boiling the wort, can the amount that you need to save for 
     kraeusening.  Save some of your yeast, too.  At the end of 
     fermentation, check the actual final gravity of the wort.  Plug this 
     number into Warner's formula to see precisely how much wort you'll 
     need to kraeusen with. 
 
     Empty the calculated amount of canned wort into a sterile container of 
     suitable size, aerate, and pitch the yeast.  When it reaches high 
     kraeusen, add it to your bottling tank (with the fermented beer, of 
     course), mix, and bottle. 
 
     You don't need to add the yeast; you can just use the saved wort 
     (called "Speisse", which means "food" in German).  This method results 
     in a longer conditioning time, and if it is a high gravity beer you 
     really should add fresh yeast. 
 
     I really don't know if it makes a damn bit of difference to the final 
     beer if you wort prime, kraeusen, or prime with glucose, but if you 
     want to claim adherence to the Reinheitsgebot, this is the way to go. 
     --------------------------- 
     Brendon (I think) asked about trub removal.  The easiest thing to do, 
     regardless of whether you use a counterflow or immersion chiller, is 
     to whirlpool the wort and then let it settle a few (5) minutes.  The 
     gunk will all be settled in the middle of the kettle, away from your 
     spigot or racking cane.  You can also use a copper or stainless steel 
     scrubbing pad as a filter. 
     --------------------------- 
     I've just got to mention that the cold water should enter the BOTTOM 
     of the chiller, not the top.  The exit water will never be as hot as 
     the wort at the top of the kettle, so you will be cooling the wort at 
     that the top of the kettle, too.  The key is to maximize the 
     temperature difference between the wort and the cooling water AT ALL 
     POINTS. 
 
     If the cold water enters the top of the chiller, it will not be very 
     much colder than the cooler wort at the bottom of the kettle, thus 
     reducing cooling efficiency. 
 
     If the cold water enters the bottom of the chiller, it will have a 
     large temperature difference with the wort for its entire trip through 
     the chiller. 
 
     I probably didn't explain that clearly enough to convince the 
     agnostics, but how about this:  IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY!!! 
 
     We're only talking about 5-10 gallons of liquid!  Most people run the 
     chilling water so fast that the exit water is still pretty cool!  All 
     this talk of currents in a 5 gallon pot is getting pretty silly!  Just 
     stir it gently! 
 
     Sorry, I lost control.  I didn't mean to sound patronizing, 
     protective, rude, tyrannical or insulting. :) 
 
     Have fun!

Hi fellow homebrewers, 
Is Guiness Draft-style stout carbonated and 
pushed to the tap with nitrogen or just 
nitrogenated??  Same question goes for 
Boddingtons??  Can I get a small nitrogen 
tank and 'nitrogenate' my homebrew instead 
of carbonating it??  Will it absorb the 
nitrogen? Are there any pressure/temp 
tables associated with beer and nitrogen?? 
Is the carbonation a significant flavor

beer destroy the style??

Damn iv'e been busy. 
I made my masher from a 5 gallon rubbermade water cooler. 
I took out the spout at the bottom and got a rubber cork 
with hole and put this around a tube.  Stuck the tube/cork 
where the spout was on the cooler.  Next I got a cheap 
(cheap == Walmart) ss bowl that just happened to fit perfectly 
in my cooler, drilled about 30 1/8 " holes in it, stomped on 
it to flatten it out a little, and whala I'm done.  So i dropped 
the bowl w/ holes down into the cooler (inverted) and filled 
it up with grain and water and let it do its job.  My 27.00 
anton-masher.  I used another larger bowl with a few small holes 
poked into it to sparg with, just set it ontop. 
 
 
Question: 
I bottled some of my mead and stuck a bottle in the freezer to
