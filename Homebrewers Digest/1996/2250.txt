Subject: Mashing specialty grains/Munich malt


What is the concensus regarding mashing specialty grains such as Munich 
and crystal ? Do I put them in with the regular malt and mash for the 
full 90 minutes (or whatever) or do I put them in for 15 minumtes at mash 
out ? 
 
Also what is the enzyme potential of Munich malt - does it have usable 
enzymes and if so what is the pts/lb/gall ?

In response to Graham Stone's suggestion about US brewers converting to = 
metric: 
 
Graham, why would you expect a whole country to consider your suggestion = 
of going to one system of measurement (metric) when your very name is a = 
mixture of the two different systems of measurement (a stone being appx. = 
6.4kg for those who didn't know)!  Just kidding!  I, as an American, = 
wish the metric system would become the primary system of measurement.  = 
I think US manufacturers are slowly converting to metric.  As this = 
transition continues, it will slowly trickle down to the general public. = 
 I don't know where other homebrewers stand on this issue.  At this = 
point, much of our equipment is based on the US Customary system, so = 
recipes will show little change until equipment is upgraded to metric.  = 
I feel there is no reason for equipment designs not to be metric, unless = 
the design comes from an older, Customary design.  You must also = 
remember that Americans are very stubborn and seem to resist the move to = 
the metric system of measurement even though it is a much more organized = 
and meaningful system than our current one.  In conclusion, don't expect = 
Americans to change just to suit the rest of the world and if you find a = 
metric recipe or equipment design from one of us, consider yourself = 
lucky.

Subject: Cutting stainless steel


Hey Neighbors, 
 
The tool that many of you have described is a pneumatic chisle.  The tool 
works like a regular chisle but is driven by air.  In experienced hands it 
slides right through stainless.  I took my stainless steel drum to our auto 
shop teacher here at the community college where I work and he cut my 
lid off...real impressive.  The tools are often used by auto body shops 
and mechanics, check them out in your area.  I used a 60 grit belt on my 
belt sander to smooth the metal.  I had no luck with my recipricating saw 
(Sawzall) maybe it depends on the hardness of the stainless used or 
finding the correct blade. 
 
Good luck,

Subject: Extract to grain conversion


Ron S. of the "Continous Flow Brewery" Asked if there is a way to convert 
extract receipes to all grain. I haven't seen a formula to do this, but I 
think this may be a solution. 
First you will need to know two things: 
1) The efficency of your brewing system 
2) The O.G. that the extract receipe is shooting for. 
 
To compute the efficency of your system, use the following formula: 
                   (pts = Original Gravity - 1.000) 
 
                                pts X Gallons 
extract_rate (efficiency) = ----------------------- 
                                lbs of grain 
 
Lets say you brew a batch using 10.5 lbs of grain, and end up with a O.G. 
of 1.042. Your efficency would therefore be: 
 
                     42pts X 5gallons 
                    ------------------- = 20 points/pound 
                     10.5 lbs of grain 
 
Now lets say the extract receipe is shooting for a O.G. of 1.045. 
                      45pts X 5gallons 
                    -------------------- = 20 points/pound 
                    unknown lbs of grain 
 
So, 
                         45pts X 5 gallons       225 
unknown lbs of grain =  ------------------- =   ----- = 11.25 lbs of grain 
                           20 pts/pound           20       (for 5 gals) 
 
As far as what types of grain to use, you are on your own. 
Just do some research on the style you are trying to emulate. 
The key to this of course is taking good notes, so you will know 
your efficency for different types/combinations of grains.

Subject: UV sterilization of brewing utensils


Hi world :-) 
Okay.. I have a friend with a pond. He is constantly 
cleaning and filtering the water to remove the 
algae and bacteria.  Seems like a pain in the butt. 
Well, he has been talking about buying a real nifty 
UV light gadget which effectively recirculates the 
pond water through a tube housing a quartz shielded 
High-intensity UV lamp. 
 
Here's the idea.. what about sanitizing those 'delicate' 
plastic barrels with a dose of UV??  It's gonna kill 
all the bad stuff, then just rinse it out.  Several 
kinds of plastic drums are made out of UV resistant 
material AND FDA approved.  Either swipe the interior 
with the UV lamp or suspend the lamp inside, turn it 
on and go have a homebrew! Turn it off when you're done 
and flush with water.  No more messy/toxic chemicals. 
No more residuals left in the drum that might upset 
or kill your yeast. 
 
So World?? Whaddya think?? 
 
And yes, you had better wear those UV blocker glasses :-)

I made my sour mash last night. Mashed in at 110F and let sit for 15 hours. 
This morning it was at 95F and stinky! I know it was soured because when 
my hose got clogged I had to suck on it to get it flowing. Sucking too hard, 
I got a big mouthful of grain/liquor and almost puked from the unpleasantness. 
I was gaging and choking and spitting everywhere. Lautering this mess (12 lb 
pilsner/7 lb bulgar/3 lb wheat flour) is not going too good. It stuck several 
times. I had to scoop out and reset the bed several times. I was up to my 
elbow in soured grains. Ack. It was going so bad, I left it to lauter and 
went to work. Hopefully, I will be done went I get home so I can boil. Next 
time I make a wit I think I will definately add lactic acid at bottling just 
because this soured mash stinks so much.

Subject: Glass vs Plastic or Blue vs Grey


Hey Neighbors, 
 
I think I've come up with a "civil" way to settle this war between the 
fermentors.  Come this fourth of July,  everyone with a fermentor meet at 
Gettysburg.  Those with glass fermentors paint theirs blue and those 
with plastic paint theirs grey.  Each side will be given rocks, nails, brillow 
pad, oxygen grenades and chlorine bombs.  The side with a fermentor 
left standing and still bubbling...WINS. 
Too silly, OK. I would love to use plastic, except, not all plastic is created 
equal.  I mean...there is HDPE, ABS, CPVC, PVC, polycarbonate, etc.etc. 
you get my point but glass, well it's just glass.  Don't get me wrong I use 
plastic buckets to bottle, sparge and to clean in but glass to ferment. 
On a recent camping trip I pulled out my trusty plastic canteen and to my 
chagrin the water tasted like it had come out of a water hose lying in the 
sun all day. 
The only disadvantage I see to glass is that it will break.  But no one has 
mentioned that you can see through glass and that is one of the main 
reasons I like glass.  I like to be able to see my beer.  Watch the first 
bubble come to the surface, monitor the trub depth, the yeast work, the 
beer change from cloudy to clear, I mean...hell it's a great show.  Then 
there is the sensuous shape of the glass.  Yes...I do love my carboy. 
Enough said, I'll see all you bucket boys in Gettysburg. 
 
Remember, for rice cakes, let's all be "civil" to each other, we're all just 
discussing BEER not a cancer serum.

Subject: Flavors and Screwups and Fl


Hey folks, I really enjoyed the thread a few weeks back on the ideal six pack 
for the non-believer.  Not too many surprises, we all seem to agree on many of 
the excellent beers out there.  I'd like to suggest another one. 
One of the most difficult aspects of judging my own beer is not being able to 
tell just what that slightly off tang/flavor/odor/sensation is.  I've made 
beer that is *almost* SNPA...but something was missing, or worse, something 
else was added. 
 
I have no way of knowing what diacetyl tastes like.  What's phenolic, exactly? 
 Astringent? Estery?....I mean, I understand the words, but I can't get the 
taste or odor from a book.  So...Could some of you judge types identify beers 
which carry these characteristics?  I already know PU is skunky... 
 
How did you BJCP guys get to know these by smell?  Homebrew clubs? Scratch and 
sniff pocket samples? Making your own bad beer? 
 
Sure would appreciate any feedback.  Just trying to improve my brewing....

 You can get a smoke flavor from roasted malts however it is not the 
same IMNSHO. Peat malt is the trick for scotch ales( and even 
scottish) but you need to tap 'er light. .75 pound is about the max I 
personally would use. anything else is pushing the edge of the

I would say again this is true. I would use .25 pound for a scottish 
at most, makes it pretty interestin' and .75 pound for a scotch.

Subject: re: Welsh Ale


Responding to Mr. Moore's query concerning Welsh Ale the other day. 
 
I've had Welsh Ale in Wales and locally here in Minneapolis.  It once 
was marketed under the name 'Double Dragon', and there were some 
inquiries and comments made about DD it in old HBDs under that name. 
 
The Welsh Ale I had in Cardiff was somewhat tannic.  The tannic 
harshness was not rounded by a full malty body, as the OG was only 1.038 
or so.  I suspected that careless brewing techniques were responsible, 
as I tasted the same harshness in other wimpy bitters and milds in 
Britain.  Later, I learned there might be another cause for the tannic 
flavors. 
 
The bottled Welsh Ale obtained here in the US is more robust, weighing 
in around OG 1.050 according to Jackson.  The style appears to be closer 
to ESB than pale ale.  I found the first bottle pleasingly sour, a nice 
complement to the fuller body.  Another bottle, enjoyed many months 
later, also struck me as slightly sour, but that time it seemed to be 
the product of higher hopping than fermentation by-products.  A local 
bar (Johnny's, if you've been through St. Paul) stocks it and has found 
it to be quite popular with the patrons.

lbs in 5 gallons is _WAY_TOO_MUCH_.  If you are here in the Silicon 
Valley, I can prove it to you by giving you a bottle.  I used 4 pounds 
in 10 gallons of malty, lightly hopped brown ale.  I now have 4 cases 
of really great cooking beer, but it's still undrinkable after two 
years in the bottle.  I would guess that 1/4 lb in 5 gallons would 
give a noticable, if faint flavor.

Subject: O2 in Plastic Buckets


About a week ago, while we were all hashing out why Australians can 
brew in plastic buckets without suffering from beer oxidation I 
posted this: 
 
>How about the solubility of Oxygen being nil in a solution which is 
>saturated in carbon dioxide? If this was the protective mechanism, 
>how long into the lagering period would it last? 
 
As has been pointed out by several posters, I was dead wrong about 
oxygen solubility being affected by the dissolved CO2. These 
corrections sent me back to my chemistry textbooks and the users 
manual for one of my HPLC's, and from these sources I believe I now 
understand why the oxygen permeability of plastic is unlikely to 
cause any oxidation of the beer during the primary fermentation. This 
is a long story but bear with me. 
 
I work with high performance liquid chromatographs which are 
instruments that are highly sensitive to gasses dissolved in the 
running solvents. To keep these solvents degassed one common method 
is to bubble helium through them. This actually works quite well. I 
assumed that this was because the saturation of a solution with one 
gas would prevent any other from dissolving- Wrong! (Doh! and I'm a 
working chemist!) This is what actually happens. The bubbling helium 
blankets the surface of the solvent reservoir and displaces all other 
gasses. Now  the amount of a gas dissolved in a liquid is 
proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the liquid, as 
has been mentioned in several posts. The helium displaces the other 
gasses lowering their partial pressures to zero. All other dissolved 
gasses (besides helium) will outgas to the head space and leave with 
the vented helium, which happens to have a low solubility and voile 
degassed solvent. 
 
Now why did I just tell you that (besides relating my own potential 
for idiocy)? Consider a beer fermenting in primary. For the purposes 
of this post I will assume closed primary fermentation. After 
vigorous fermentation begins, CO2 bubbles start to rise to the 
surface, and we get airlock activity. The CO2 carries away all other 
gasses contained in the head space, making their partial pressures 
nil. Gasses other than CO2 that are dissolved in the beer will outgas 
to the head space and be carried away. The oxygen permeability of the 
plastic then is not much of a factor, because as long as the head 
space is filled with CO2 the O2 will outgas and be carried away out 
the airlock. Note this effect would only last while CO2 is coming out 
of the beer creating that CO2 blanket above the beer. Thus I can say 
nothing of open fermentation or secondary fermentation. 
 
I think that this shows that O2 permeability is not much of a concern 
when using Plastic bucket as primary fermentors. I can say nothing 
about 
contamination concerns although several good posts in the recent past 
have matched my experience: strong bleach or such to dissolve the 
crud and some gentle wiping and your plastic bucket is ready to 
sanitize.

Subject: Tempering of Malt


Last summer I asked if any brewers tempered their malt like flour millers 
do (add small amounts of water to the grain and let it toughen the bran). 
 
Got a response that wet milling of grain is done but nothing on 
tempering. 
 
I added two tbs water  per pound to my pale ale malt, stirred it and let 
it rest two hours in a closed container before running thru my Coronna. 
 
The results were excellent!!  Big flat clean hunks of bran and a lot of 
fine white flour.  This was described as the ideal grind for brewers. 
Excellent performance in the lauder tun. 
 
I ground a pound of untempered mash and screened it through a window 
screen sieve and got over 4 oz fines thru the sieve.  The same amount of 
malt tempered put over 7 oz of fines thru the same sieve. 
 
The inner part of the tempered malt seemed to collapse into flour and rub 
off the bran which stayed relatively whole.  Very few kernals split in 
1/2. 
 
I tried 4 tbs water/pound and it was impossible to grind. 
 
I plan to temper all my malt at 2 tbs water/pound. 
 
Note...I didn't test it with pils malt, wheat malt, etc. 
 
I'd be interested in the test results if someone has the sieves they use 
for testing ideal particle size distribution.  Also, the results with 
other makes of mills. M My address at the top of this is probably wrong, 
so email me at kbooth`at`scnc.waverly.k12.mi.us

PROBLEM an underhopped boring bland brew. 
SOLUTION, I put 40 gms SAAZ pellets in a plunger coffee maker 
filled the coffee maker with boiling water and left stand for 
10 mins before depressing the plunger and decanting the liquor 
into 18 lit Cornelius keg resulting in a pleasant hop aroma 
beer without having to worry about hop residue in the keg.

Subject: Blowoff hose infections... NOT!


Dave writes:

Sorry, Dave, your opinion means nil to me and although you have 
posted many correct concepts, by my count, 1 out of 5 "facts" you 
post are incorrect or misleading, so I urge everyone to be as skeptical 
of Dave's posts as I am. 
 
Short and to the point: Glass carboys and blowoff hoses are NOT a 
likely source of infection.  I don't scrub the ones I use (although 
Dave wants to think I do), I simply soak them in bleach water for a 
few hours and let the yellow stains be.  The blowoff is always 
traveling OUTBOUND and even when it does collapse, the brown material 
sticks to the closest surface, which means that any bacteria or wild 
yeasts that may have survived the bleach water soak have no way of 
traveling from the surface of the blowoff tube to the beer. 
 
Dave's misguided concern about blowoff tubes is similar to the 
unnecessary concern for things growing in the blowoff bucket.  Some 
change their water daily or put bleach in the blowoff bucket to 
prevent infection.  I ask: how is anything going to climb up the hose 
and into the fermenter? 
 
Sorry to burst your bubble, Dave... since I've switched to filtered 
air and oxygen, I have brewed 25 batches (14 this summer) and none of 
them had that faint clovey character that I had when I was simply 
shaking and pouring my wort to aerate it.  This was all with the same 
glass fermenters and the same stained blowoff tubes.

A recent posting highlighted: 
 
"Tuesday morning this past week, my university officials decided, without 
prior warning, to cut me off from server access. My homepage files and my 
email account were seized and placed under lock and key. I have no idea if 
the account has been accepting new messages or what, because the university 
won't let me know anything at all. " 
 
While I certainly don't know the details, I suspect that there may be more of 
this to come as Corporate Systems people start to monitor the extreme recent 
increase in LAN/WAN activity.  I know that at my "day job", systems designed 
to run at under 50% are reaching daytime averages in the 90s and forcing 
timeouts.  As a result, I've tried to cancel my subscription at the office and 
started up a new home/personal account.  The new account set up fine, but the 
cancellation has not taken affect yet. 
 
Is anyone else having problems with subscribe/unsubscribe and how do we get 
assistance?  I enjoy this group and don't want to see it become a problem.

I thought maybe I could make a light ale and add a chocolate Liqueur

 Sorry, but I have to disagree strongly with this assertion.  I, 
too, was an extract brewer at one time; I brewed 29 extract batches before 
graduating to all grain.  I designed my own recipes with extract.  Arguing 
that the "process is no different" is patently false.  The process is very 
different.

 But you do NOT choose the malts.  That has been done for you by 
the company that manufactured your extract.  Furthermore, you have no idea 
what those malts were, in the vast majority of cases.  Were they domestic 
6-row or continental 2-row?  A wort made from each would have vastly 
different characteristics -- characteristics that you are unaware of when 
choosing extracts.  You do not mash your specialty grains either, 
you simply "steep" them, resulting in a different characteristic from 
thsoe grains.  Furthermore, you do not choose the mash schedule.  Even 
within the single infusion technique, there are plenty of variables to 
play around with, if one chooses, and by reconstituting a wort from 
extract as opposed to creating it from a real mash you have little 
awareness that these variables exist AND you have zero control over them. 
 
> 
>With the sole exception of the source of the sugars, there is no 
>difference in the recipe formulation process. 
 
 Superficially, the above is mostly true.  Substantively, though, 
the "source of the sugars" is the heart, soul, foundation, plumbing, 
frame, and wiring of the beer.  It all starts there.  When brewing from 
extracts, you lose control over the type of malts used (continental, 
british, domestic, 2-row, 6-row) the maltster used (there is appreciable 
variability there as well; Crisp Maris Otter has a different flavor 
profile than Hugh Baird Pale Ale etc. etc.) the mash schedule employed 
(single, step, decoction; rests designed to accentuate fermentability or 
dextrine production?) and so on.  Give me the same ingredients, and change 
the primary sac rest temperature from 149F to 158F, and I'll give you a 
different beer, even when everything else has been held constant. 
 
 I do not intend to argue that it is impossible to brew good beers 
from extracts.  Several of my later extract batches easily surpass 
several of my all-grain batches, and I have judged competitions where 
extract beers competed well against all-grain beers.  HOWEVER, 
suggesting that recipe formulation, brewing process, and the average 
resulting beer is the same is a very tenuous position at best.
