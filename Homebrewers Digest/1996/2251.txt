I have a question, 
 
I just got a big propane type king cooker at about 117,000 btu's. How 
hard should I let wort boil? 
 
Heavy Boil? 
Rolling Boil? 
Light Boil?

Subject: Can't we all just get along


Hi All, 
 
I have subscribed to this digest for about six months and in general I 
find it a great source of ideas and inspiration but what is with all the 
bickering.   I think everyone should take a deep breath and try to 
remember IT IS A HOBBY!!!  All this arguing is just a waste of time. We 
might even get more people posting ideas if they weren't scare of someone 
jumping down their throat if they make a mistake. So stop all the stupid 
bickering and make some beer. It is a HOBBY and if it causes you this 
much stress maybe you should find something else to do with your time, I 
hear needle point has a calming effect.

Subject: IPA yeasts & 1318


This is a summary of the advices I received regarding IPA yeast choices: 
 
Ken Jucks suggested the US Ale by RTP yeast line, which is also used by S. 
Adams for their Boston Ale.  (Inside source) 
 
Jon Yusko recommended ESB 1968 as his choice over the London Ale 1318 
(Wyeast) that I'd inquired about. 
 
Greg Pickles observed that 1318 was very slow and needed time to work in 
his experience. 
 
smarman had found 1318 just "so-so" and that it doesn ferment out so good; 
for highly hopped ales the low attentuation left a sweetness to balance 
the hoppiness.  His preference was Wyeast 1028 for IPA's. 
 
Bryon Kuhl sent helpful yeast profiles and said 1968 was his choice. 
 
Larry O used 1056 and enjoyed his IPA. 
 
Thom Tomlinson in his Brew Techniques article May/June 1994 on India Pale 
Ale recommends "the yeast should contribute some esters and impart a 
minerally flavor to the beer". He comments Wyeast #1028 London Ale yeas 
offer a rich, minerally profile and produces fruity esters.  !056 is "too 
clean especially if the OG is in the low 1.050's". 
 
Yeast Lab A04 was the only yeast I could by locally that had the "esters 
and minerally" profile as 1028 wasn't available.  I brewed a pale ale and 
used the 1318 in that, 
the A04 in a OG 1.062 IPA, and mixed the two yeasts to use in a 1.080 
strong ale. 
 
Thanks to all who contributed.  Cheers jim booth, lansing, mi email to 
kbooth`at`scnc.waverly.k12.mi.us as the address on the server will bounce. 
 
kudos to those who do the heavy lifting on the HBD by sharing special 
research or expertise, and to the AOB for the apparently thankless task of 
staffing the HBD.

Subject: Instant Lager?`


As a long time yeast culturer, the idea of re-using yeast from a 
previous batch seems nothing short of blasphemous.  However, wanting 
to get another batch in before the cold weather, I thought I would give 
it a try. 
 
After kegging the previous batch, I poured the sludge from the fermenter 
into a sterile kettle and pitched this into the wort Thursday eve.  It 
was fermenting within an hour, by morning it was done and now (Sat), it 
is clear enough to keg and tastes like any other young beer ready to 
keg.  That's 48 hrs, in case you have lost track. (gravity 45, temp 40F) 
 
Have I been missing something?

Subject: O2 & plastic


Chuck Burkins, if I understand him correctly, suggests that 
the permiability of plastic fermenters to oxygen is of no 
concern because thanks to the flushing effects of the CO2 
produced by fermentation any oxygen that crosses the plastic 
will merely pass through the beer and outgas to the surface. 
 
 
It would seem to me that if Chuck's theory is correct then 
during the fermentation period the flushing effect caused 
by the CO2 production will keep the partial pressure of O2 
in the beer extremely low. 
 
This will encourage more O2 to cross the plastic wall. 
 
Hence the CO2 production during active fermentation would 
cause a greater total ammount of O2 to enter the beer than 
would be the case when no fermentation was occuring. 
 
I doubt that the flushing effect is so efficient and so 
rapid that the O2 passing through the plastic, then 
through the volume of the beer on its way to the head 
space is prevented from reacting with beer components. 
 
Just a thought, 
a neuronal outgassing,

Subject: Hydrometer vs refractometer


I fervent hope is for someone to help me relate hydrometer readings to 
refractometer readings for a refractometer calibrated in Brix or Balling. 
 
At OG there is not much of a problem; the hydrometer and the refractometer 
are measuring the same thing.  The hydrometer reading and a Plato table will 
be in close agreement.  The problem arises in trying to monitor a 
fermentation when alcohol is present to modify the hydrometer reading.  How 
does it affect the Refractometer reading? 
 
The, at the end of fermentation, the hydrometer indicates FG which includes 
the combined effect of alcohol and residual dissolved solids.  What is the 
refractometer measuring at this point?

Subject: carbonation question


I am a relative novice brewer (8-10 batches under my belt, all pretty damn good
if I don't say so myself) but I have one minor problem that I haven't found a 
good answer for.  The last three batches have not cabonated fully.  They do 
carbonate some, there's a little pfft when I pop one open, but the beer is not 
as carbonated as usual.  I have been consistantly been using 1.25 cups dme to 
prime leaving them to carbonate for about a week and a half minimum after 
around 1-2 weeks fermenting.  The only differences between the rest and these 
last three are that they are partial mash and they were brewed in a different 
location, namely my new house where they ferment in the basement.  Either of 
these two things be the cause? Or is it something else I overlooked? 
Any comments would be much appreciated.

Subject: Things that Matter


- -- [ From: Michael Gerholdt * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] -- 
 
There will always be a sort of tension between practicality and "final truth 
." Some of us want practical solutions, immediate and not so very convoluted 
, to practical situations. Others of us are just as interested in what is 
really, below the threshold of pure practicality, the case. 
 
Immersion chillers: Cold water in at the top, or in at the bottom? After 
making his assertion that bottoms up is the way to go, George de Piro says: 
It doesn't really matter. 
 
Practically speaking, it surely doesn't, when we're considering 5 or 10 
gallon batches. Yet the arguments that press the minute data points are the 
very stuff of life for some of us, and I for one am interested. After all, I 
do believe that, ultimately, what seems like pure theory is really connected 
to practical reality, and in the end the dichotomy doesn't exist. To me it 
matters which way the water flows in the chiller. I bet that in George's 
chiller, it flows from the bottom up. Why? Because he doesn't really believe 
that "It doesn't really matter." 
 
Of course, what he's saying is that it isn't important enough to make a big 
deal about, and I agree. But I don't think there need be an apology for 
discussing what the case really is. 
 
I posted that I thought immersion chillers should be fed from the top down, 
because there is a greater difference in temperature between the cold 
entrance water and the hot wort at the pot top. George says it should be 
from the bottom up, because the temperature difference between water and 
wort remains greater *over the entire length of the chiller". 
 
The common basis is the fact that the greater the thermal difference, the 
greater the transfer of heat from one to the other. 
 
If the cold water enters at the bottom, where the difference in temp is the 
least, the idea would be that the water in the chiller isn't heated as much 
as it is by the wort at the top of the kettle. Therefore, though it *is* 
heated some, it remains cooler near the top of the wort than it would be at 
the bottom had it come from the top and been heated by the hot wort at the 
pot top. According to George. 
 
It may be that this is correct as over against my assertion to the contrary. 
I'm not sure. The way to test this would be to pump the same amount of the 
same temp water though the same amount/temp water in each direction, and 
measure the temp of the exit water. The hotter exit water wins, because it 
is drawing away more heat - right? 
 
I don't have an immersion chiller. If someone else does and would perform 
such a test over the next few batches, I'd be interested in results. Or, if 
the test has been performed and results already posted in HBD, does someone 
have a reference? 
 
George ... No, didn't sound/seem patronizing or any of those other things. 
Hope *this* doesn't sound like a slam or a flame.

***This is a condensed version of my 2 previous posts, acknowledged by 
majodomo, but listed as "No Subject"...my verbosity may be killing me..;-)*** 
 
>More importantly BT totally ignores the newbie brewer. 
        Jethro finds this amusing, when it is obvious that BT has been 
working to accommodate the home brewer....the HBD is, by far, more technical 
than BT...but with 12 batches in 2 years, try "Brew Your Own" magazine...it 
deals directly with beginning brewers. You might like it. 
 
>It is my understanding that there has been an alternative to the 
>AHA for many many years,  YOUR LOCAL HOMEBREWING CLUB!!!!!! 
        As a recovering homebrewer, I agree with you...your local club is a 
great source of info...I learned more in 30 minutes at a club (North Florida 
Brewers League, Tallahassee, Fla.) than in the preceeding 6 months.... 
        And in Savannah, Ga...when setting up the first club (Savannah 
Brewers League) and HB shop in  town...we were proud to affiliate with the 
AHA.... 
        'Cos they had "Zymurgy," which took the time to teach 'newbies'..and 
had all these books one could learn from..and a listing to attract new members.
        I can state that the best brewers I have known were members of clubs 
I attended....they easily run rings around me....(Klugh Kennedy of Savannah, 
and Marc Gaspard of Tallahassee come first to mind)..... 
        But the AHA fills a gap that you and I can't; recruiting on a 
national scale, in numbers that can't be duplicated in a single city, or 
club...if it gets them started, it can't be all bad. NCJOHB was my 1st brew 
book, and eagerly devoured. (Over and over and over.) 
                I have doubts about various situations...but FWIW, the AHA 
is the best intro there is..(but next time you go to China, Charlie, I'm 
free to accompany you!) If you outgrow them....move on.. 
 
ATF Label Approval- 
       I am currently asking some folks with more experience for help on 
this one...will get back to you.... 
 
George Fix- 
        I'm honored, sir! 
 
Zen Masters- 
        I can assure you, the only time I am beyond all-grain, is when I 
leave the brewery. 
 
Smoke- 
        I made a smoked porter with 10 % H. Baird medium peated malt. Folks 
loved it or hated it, no middle ground. The peat did give phenolics that 
were reported by some to be 'band-aid'y. Next time I think I will go 5-7 %. 
(It did get to 2nd round GABF, though.)

Subject: Grolsch bottles


During a recent visit to my local recycling, I came across about 30 Grolsch 
bottles that someone had left.  I quickly snatched them up and put them 
through my rigid cleaning process (hot ammonia cleaner, extensive hot water 
rinse followed by soak in bleach water and rinse.  I use this procedure when 
I scavenge champaigne and other recycled bottles.  Works well for me!)  My 
question regarding the Grolsch bottles concerns the gasket/washers.  They all 
look clean and intact but I was wondering from a practical point of view how 
long they last. 
 
Do those of you out there using Grolsch or similar bottles change these 
gaskets every use or just when they show signe of wear? 
 
If the latter, about how many cleanings (hot water followed by bleach and 
rinse) will they generally survive? 
 
Any recommendations for replacement sources?  I'm sure some of my mail order 
catalogs have them.  I'll have to check. 
 
Any other comments based upon experiences with these things would be 
appreciated.

We here in the States have no intent of *ever* converting.  The 
cleverly designed English system of measurements is a 
binary/hexadecimal system (16 oz. to the pound/cup, 2 cups to the 
pint, etc.), eminently well-suited to computer processing.  This 
unlike the primitive, decimal, count-on-your-fingers metric 
system.  We're ahead of the curve!

Subject: Bass != IPA


A while back (scratched the exact references -- sorry!) there was 
some dicussion of true-to-type and non-true-to-type beers, and 
several made the comment that Bass was a poor example of an IPA. 
 
Having made one of my periodic treks to the package store ("liquor 
store" to those of you not resident in Connecticut), I happened to 
glance at a bottle of Bass.  The label described it as a "Pale Ale"; 
the word "India" and the TLA "IPA" appeared nowhere on the label. 
 
Possibly the re-designed labels haven't made it to the backwater of 
Connecticut yet.  Possibly we're ahead of the curve, and the 
re-re-designed labels have gotten here first.  Possibly there's a 
different label on a purportedly different brew sold elsewhere. 
But, as best as I can determine (not limited to the datum 
mentioned above), Bass has ~always~ been sold as "Pale Ale", not 
"IPA", in these parts.

Here my two cents and a response to the BT bash. You can't find everything 
you want in one book, one class, one paper, one homebrew store, one recipe, 
one style, one web site, or one HBD.... etc. That's the joy of it. To say 
that BT is a worthless rag is all screwed up. I subscribe to many brewing 
mags and buy many brewing books. I learn something from each piece of 
brewing literature out there no matter how good or bad. 
 
I hope to never stop learning about the brewing sciences and people like Jim 
Busch, Norm Pyle, Al Korozonas, Allen Moen, Dave Miller, Charlie Papazian 
(yes even Charlie) and god knows who else have contributed to making me a 
better brewer. I don't personally care for BYO (Brew Your Own) Magazine but 
I won't dismiss it as a learning tool and have found things in there that 
made sense. 
 
The minute that anyone of us stops looking for a way to learn more about 
brewing we cease to be informed and I don't care if you brew from kits with 
a "Beer Machine" or you are doing all-grain in 55 gallon drums, it's all 
about brewing the best you choose to brew. I took a look at about the last 
two years of BT and it seems to me that they are going out of their way in 
the last year to include more for the beginniing and extract brewer. I say 
LOOK HARDER! 
 
Even the HBD with all it's fodder still has some real precious nuggets of 
information for a brewer on any level. 
 
If you bash a periodical that's your decision but don't write them off as 
being useless because alot of great brewers are contributing to them and 
taking their time to make us all better brewers! 
 
Has anyone one of you that are unhappy with these periodicals ever picked up 
a pen and written to them about it? Or even picked up a phone? I bet 99% of 
you are just complaining and yet not doing anything about resolving it. I 
think it was Jim Busch that asked in a recent post what exactly it is you 
want to  see in BT... 
 
Well Sparky, THERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO STAND UP AND BE COUNTED! So don't talk,

Subject: Brewing Techniques


I'm a bit beyond "newbie" but somewhere below "Expert" as a homebrewer.  I 
want to come to a very strong defense of Brewing Techniques as a resourse for 
the homebrewer--not just for the articles they publish but also in the 
attitude they have towards their subsribers. 
 
I had heard of their publication somewhere but couldn't find it locally.  I 
got an Em,ail address and sent them a request for info and a request for a 
sample issue.  They responded with both Email and snail mail infor and a 
requested sample.  While reading the sample, I found a reference to an 
article (I believe it was on cf chillers) and asked if I could purchase a 
copy of the back issue.  They replied that the specific issue was no longer 
available but they would be happy to send a copy of the article.  The did and 
also included a few related artciles--all without a solicitation for a 
subscription!  I was hooked on their service and attitude and subscribed 
immediately.  I get Zymurgy, Brew Your Own and BT.  BT is always on the top 
of my desk and I read it cover to cover.  BYO follows and I have a stack of 
Zymurgy that some day I'll get to. 
 
I don't want to bash any magazine--they all do their best to provide a wide 
range of info to an extremely diverse reader audience.  No single magazine or 
editorial philosophy would satisy everyone.  I do, however, want to express 
my extremely positive feelings about BT.  Ususal disclaimers do apply.  No 
afilliation etc.

Subject: Porter Temp?


Hi everyone. 
 
My first homebrew (a light ale) was a huge success, so I'm going for 
#2.  I am trying Sparrow Hawk (dark) porter, from New Joy of 
Homebrewing.  My question is this: 
 
The brew indicates lager yeast, but I don't have a cold place in my 
home to ferment.  I put the fermenter in my basement, which averages 
about 60 degrees.  Do you think this is OK?  Since it is getting 
colder out, the basement will probably start to get colder.  Will this 
be really bad for the yeast? 
 
And what happens when you ferment lager yeast at ale temperatures? 
 
Thanks..

re kraeusening: 
 
one difference doing the k-thing should in prinicple make to the beer is 
in malt aroma.  fewer of the aroma constituents of the gyle will be 
blown off from that added as kraeusen, for lack of vigorous fermentation 
at that stage in the process.  if making a bock/fest/vienna, and 
wondering why you can't seem to get that malty nose of your favorite 
commercial version, this could be why. 
 
it is somewhat analogous to the late addition of hops (dry hopping) for a 
big hop nose, late addition of honey for a big honey nose, late addition 
of fruit for a big fruit nose, and the megaswill practice of late 
addition of water for a big water nose.

Subject: teat dip question


Hi all, 
 
I have a question about the use of teat dip for sanitizing. 
I know it has been discussed before, so I've checked previous 
threads on this.  It appears that I should avoid any teat dip 
with lanolin or phosphoric acid. The teat dip at our local farm 
supply store does not appear to contain these, but it does list 
glycerine (10%) as one of the inert ingredients. At $10/gallon, 
this stuff sure seems better than paying $4/4 oz for iodophor, but 
not if there are any health risks or if it's gonna mess up my beer... 
The label says this stuff contains: 
 
ACTIVE INGREDIENTS           9.1% 
Alpha-(p-nonylphenyl)-omega-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene) - 
iodine complex (providing 1.0% titratable iodine, 
equivalent to 10,000 ppm titratable iodine) 
 
INERT INGREDIENTS           90.9% 
Glycerine                   10.0% 
minimum pH 4 
 
Any thoughts on whether this is ok to use?  Also, since this 
stuff contains 1.0% titratable iodine (vs. 1.6% for the BTF 
iodophor), should I use 1.6 times more teat dip to get the same 
concentrations? 
 
Thanks...

Do you realize how pompous you've become?  We are talking about 
brewing beer here, not the morality of abortion. I can't imagine what 
would prompt your diatribe, except that possibly your entire 
self-worth is driven by your quest for the perfect 5 gallons. I used 
to get annoyed with "Relax. Don't worry. Have a homebrew.", but I 
now realize why it was Papazian's mantra.

 No good. You'll get bad flavors and off tastes using ale yeast at lager 
temps. 
 
 Remember it's important to 1. use the correct yeast and 2. keep 
fermentation temps steady. 
 
 If the temp will stay 60 degrees or above try Scottish liquid Wyeast.

Subject: Re: Molasses Beer


   Ken wanted to know what to do with 25 kg of molasses.  O.K. - it's not 
exactly a recipe but here are some molasses recommendations from a 1759 law 
in my province: 
 
   Spruce beer is to be brewed for the health and 
   conveniency of the troops which will be served 
   at prime cost.  Five quarts of molasses will be put 
   into every barrel. 
 
   Molasses, like peat smoked malt is easy to overdo.  Sometimes, I even 
have a hard time with the excessive molasses taste of an ale with too much 
brown sugar (North American refined sucrose with molasses added) I don't 
think I could have stomached the five pints a day allowed by legislation 
for the above beer. 
 
   I'd say stick well below 5 quarts per barrel ( what's that, about 3/4 of 
a liter for a 5 U.S. gallon batch? )  It takes less than 100g to lend a bit 
of complexity to the average dark ale if you're talking about a 5 U.S. 
gallon batch.

Here are the results from cooling my wort with 1) the cold water entering 
the top coil first and 2) the cold water entering the bottom coil first. 
 
A few details first: 
 
- -My wort chiller is 25 ft 3/8" copper coil 
- -The coils are spaced about 1" apart 
- -Volume of both worts at time of cooling was 24 liters 
- -My water supply temp was 44 deg. F 
- -The cold water supply was turned on full for the duration of both coolings. 
(this was the only way to keep the flow rate constant) 
- -No other water in the house was running. 
- -The lid was on during cooling. (except where chiller input/output is) 
- -I used 2 floating thermometers. The temperatures were taken from where the 
tip of thermometers rest. (This was approximately in the middle of the wort) 
- -I used the stop watch on my wrist watch for the timing. 
 
  TOP   BOTTOM 
  Batch 1  Batch 2 
Time  Temp.   Temp. 
 
0:00  206   206 (no stirring) 
5:00  138   138 (no stirring) 
10:00  100   102 (no stirring) 
15:00  88   84 (no stirring) 
15:00-15:30 stirred 
18:00  84   84 
20:00  80   80 
20:00-20:30 srirred 
23:00  74   74 
23:00-23:30 stirred 
26:00  68   68 
26:00-26:30 stirred 
28:00  64   64 
 
Conclusion: This is the normal way that I cool my wort. I do not stir for 
the first 15 minutes, then I stir every few minutes. Using this method it 
doesn't seem to make any difference on where the cold water flows into the 
wort chiller. I would appear that with no stirring at all, that the cold 
water entering on the bottom would have a slight advantage, (as indicated 
after 15 minutes) I have no idea how a slower flow rate (ie: less water 
usage) might effect these findings. 
 
These are just my findings, in my home brewery, under my own test conditions.

Subject: bitterness perception / !!??!


Hello HBD! 
 
KennyEddy says: 
>there is a non-linear relationship between IBU's and bitterness >sensation; 
the difference between 20 and 30 IBU is seemingly much >greater than between 30
and 40 IBU. 
 
I think that also in this matter you should apply the (WEBER-)FECHNER Law: 
 
Perception=log(stimulus) 
 
That is, what you feel as an equal "step" between your perceptions (e.g., 
bitterness, frequency or intensity of a sound, etc.) is really an equal 
"ratio"; you perceive the same difference between 12 and 24 IBU and between 24 
and 48 etc. (as in music, there is an octave between 20 and 40 Hz and the same 
between 8000 and 16000)

!!??! I could not get the last 7 issues of HBD (I read the HTMLized version 
anyway) and receveid no other emails since the one from Bob Wolff on 23-Nov 
(thanks, "Vito"), so I don't know if it's the fault of my free-mail service or 
of the HBD. 
Sorry if I waste bandwith for this, but this message is also to warn anyone who
mailed me recently that I could have missed their mail (and also to check if I 
get at least the confirmation message to this post).

Good morning all, 
 
Ian Smith asks when to put the specialty grains into the mash. 
 
Put all the grains into the mash at the beginning of the mash.  The 
specialty grains all have unconverted starch that needs to be mashed to 
convert. 
 
Munich malt will convert itself and a small percentage of crystal or 
adjunct.  I would guess about 5% but that is only a guess. 
 
I have make a number of dunkels with the base malt of Durst Munich and 
the yield has always been about 31pppg
