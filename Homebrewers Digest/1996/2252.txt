I haven't tried it with lager, but have had the same experience with ale 
yeast recovered from a primary - fermentation started within an hour and 
was done within 2-3 days. In fact, my previous posts about recovering 
and washing yeasts left out the fact that on at least two occasions, I 
minimally washed the yeast (one wash vs three), and used that yeast 
within two weeks of storage in the fridge. They also started very quick, 
within 2 hours and fermented nicely. The yeast in these two cases was 
Wyeast 1056. 
 
I'm not into yeast culturing (yet), but maybe someone out there (Tracy 
Aquilla - you still around?) would experiment by recovering repetitive 
batches of a strain, and testing each recovery to see how much and how 
rapid mutation might occur.

Subject: RE: Grolsch Bottle Gaskets


Tom Puskar asked how often Grolsch bottle gaskets should be replaced and 
replacement sources for same. 
 
Tom, I've used Grolsch bottles for at least 5 years now, re-washing them 
dozens of  times. I replace the gaskets only when they appear dry, 
cracked, or otherwise visibly worn out. A good sign is if the bottle 
loses carbonation, but in this case, also check the ceramic top to 
ensure it isn't cracked or chipped, and make sure the gasket was sitting 
square on the top, making a good seal. 
 
Just about any homebrew supply carries the replacement gaskets.

I am ready to brew again after afew monthes hiatus due to warm 
weather, work schedule, ad infinitum------ 
I plan to brew an ESP and have some questions about the right yeast. 
I have some yeast I "harvested" from a batch of oatmeal stout.  It was 
Wyeast Irish 1084.  This was the first yeast I ever had to use a 
blowoff tube with.  It is extremely flocculent, and I wonder if it is 
appropriate for an ESB.  What does the collective wisdom think about 
it?  Thanx for any help about it, or any other better yeast.

Hello, all.  I have a couple of questions. 
1.  Is there an FAQ for no sparge mashing? 
2.  Who do I email to discuss HBD format? 
 
I also have a problem some of you out there may understand.  I wrote last 
Friday 25th about these same issues, and sent the post off, got the 
standard "We got it" mail item back, and never saw the post again.  Also, I 
received an HBD the same instant I sent the post off.  I checked the one 
that came instantly, no post at the end, also no post at the beginning of 
the next HBD.  Did my post fall into the HBD purgatory?  Has my reputation 
as a bad brewer reached even to the HBD? 
 
Just wondering,

This was a "digest" thread about two weeks ago.  Keep in mind that 
there is LIGHT peat and HEAVY peat malts. Possibly MEDIUM peat 
is also available.   How much to use depends on which kind of malt 
you're using.  The kinds of comments above need to be more specific. 
 
And if anyone is counting, I'll echo others' votes for only digested 
"digests" and a cancel feature.  If Rob went to the trouble to add 
a cancel option, it must have been worth the hassle.  Since Shawn 
left, it is unclear whether we have a janitor or whether we're on 
autopilot.

The answer is.......Heavy Boil.  Don Pardo, tell him what he's won... 
 
Actually, what's the difference between a heavy boil and a rolling boil? 
All the books say go with a heavy boil since you'll get the most hop 
utilization and the best hot break.  This is one improvement from moving 
off the stove for most people.  Of course, you'll get more evaporation 
with a heavy boil, so you need to adjust your starting volume 
accordingly.

Subject: Barleywine and pH


Hi All: 
I understand that there has been a discussion regarding pH control and mead 
in this forum and its applicability to high gravity beer fermentation.  I 
have not been reading the HBD lately so I hope that these comments are not 
entirely out of context......or really late. 
 
I have done a lot of experimentation with mead since Ken and I came across 
the Morse article (when? 1992?).  In any case I have no experience using pH 
control in Barleywine.  My gut feeling is that it is not needed and 
probably misguided since wort has plenty of nutrients and buffer capacity. 
Just pitch sufficient, healthy yeast and there should be no problem. 
"Sufficient" almost demands repitching the yeast from a previous batch to 
reach appropriate cell counts. 
 
The pH issue has been discussed thoroughly on the Mead Lovers Digest over 
the last year or so, and would refer interested people to that list.  It is 
significant with honey wine because honey is essentially sugar with very 
little protein or nutrients. Very different from beer wort.

Subject: Sanitation and Kegging


I have a few questions for the collective. 
 
Regarding sanitation: 
 
1) When using Iodophor how does one determine whether it is still effective? 
By color alone?  By smell?  Using some kind of test?  I had been using a six 
gallon covered plastic bucket to store my solution and though it smells 
strongly of Iodophor I think it is the plastic that has taken up the smell and 
it's not the water.  Likewise for color. 
 
2) For sanitizing racking canes and hoses how do people using Iodophor dry 
the inside?  I've just been letting it drip and using it even with some drops 
still inside (no detectible iodine taste yet). 
 
3) Can a bleach solution be kept in a covered plastic bucket?  How long?  How 
do you know when it's no longer efficient? 
 
4) Can I keep pre-boiled water in a covered sanitized plastic bucket without 
losing the benefit of the boiling?  This is for use in starting siphons and 
topping off the fermenter.  If so, how long can this be kept? 
 
Re: kegging: 
 
4) I just started kegging and to sanitize the keg I filled with Iodophor and 
then (after letting sit a few minutes) pushed the Iodophor to another keg with 
a gas line with a gas fitting on one end and a liquid fitting on the other. It 
seemed like I needed to tap out some pressure/Iodophor on the receiving keg to 
get all the Iodophor out of the original keg. Is this other's experiences? Or  
could I have just kept increasing pressure until it was all pushed from the 
first to the second?  Should I leave the receiving keg pressurized and then 
use this pressure to transport the Iodophor to another keg when I'm ready to 
keg again? 
 
5) What's the max pressure I should ever deal with?  The kegs list around 
130psi as a max, though I don't think I'll ever go anywhere near that 
(certainly not more than 60psi).  I'm actually more concerned with the gas 
line and fittings more than the keg.  Seems like the line may blow off the 
hose barb (even with a hose clamp) if I were to crank up the pressure too 
high. 
 
6) When relieving pressure on the kegs does one just use a screwdriver on the 
gas in? (They're ball lock kegs.) 
 
Finally, could anyone in the Westford, MA area contact me.  I'd like to 
trade info on clubs, suppliers, scrap yards, etc. 
 
Thanks to everyone,

Micheal (faymi`at`earlham.edu) asked about low carbonation in his last few 
batches: One thing to remember when priming with DME -- not all extracts 
have the same fermentability. Changing brands could change the amount of 
carbonation you receive.

I don't think so.  This is almost the same experience that i have 
had. But i think that this is a good procedure rathern than 
a blasphemous one, even though i culture my yeast.  I find that 
my lagers are much easier to brew if i pack them all together 
in sucession and repitch.  I consider the first batch a five gallon 
batch, to be the final step up.  Even though i build up to 
a one gallon starter, it never seems to have enough slurry 
to get the ferment going strong.  I have been using 2124 BTW.

Subject: 3-Vessel Mashing Systems


Greetings, all. I've been shopping around for a 3-vessel mashing system 
and have collected lots of info on the Pico system, Sabco's Brew Magic, 
the PBS (Precision Brewing Systems) 3-vessel system, Bitoa, and Penquat 
Brew Tree. Thus far, although the Brew Magic system appears to be the 
best from a technical standpoint, it's about 2X the cost of all the 
others. Is it worth the price point to get microprocessor-controlled 
RIMS? Or is a "traditional" mash tun/sparge vessel with some 
recirculating capabilities sufficient (considering that a separate RIMS 
can always be added on later)? Is a pump-driven system superior to a 
gravity-fed system? And what about those false bottoms? How well do they 
fit in each of these designs? (I know, I ask alotta questions, don't I?) 
At this point I'm leaning toward the Pico system (for the pumps) or the 
PBS (for the SS kettles instead of converted kegs, potentially adding 
pumps of my own), but am interested in any/all advice/experience/stories 
of interesting merit. Reply here or to personal email 
(rkienle`at`interaccess.com) okay. 
 
Prosit!

Subject: A-B in Barrons


 
The current issue of Barron's (Oct 28th, 1996), a financial weekly, 
has a nice article on the beer business and some specifics on the A-B 
'fight' with the micros.  A-B has plans to grow from 44 or 45% of the 
market to 60% of the market by 2005.  Most of the gains to be taken 
from third tier players like Strohs and Heileman, but some share from 
Miller & Coors.  The Boston Brewing and Pete's Wicked interests and 
positions are covered in a much more balanced way than 'NBC dateline' 
IMO. 
 
One tactic that should hurt the little guys substantially is ... "By 
volume 40% of the company's [A-Bs] beer rides to market through 
exclusive distributors who carry nothing else.  Anheuser wants to 
increase this exclusive percentage to 70%, effectively preventing 
rival beers from getting what the company figures is a subsidized 
ride".  Redhook, with partial A-B ownership, will be the 'approved' 
craft beer available to A-B exclusive distributors. Some more details 
on this and other tactics appear in the article by Jay Palmer, a 
Barron's staff writer.

Subject: Stuck Fermentation


HBDers: 
 
Here's an interesting one, I think. 
 
I recently brewed a 10 gallon, all-grain ale, whole hops, and used for the     
first time WYEAST 1272, Am. Ale II, which according to the Lab is more 
flocculent than 1056, with a 72-75% attenuation rate. This a fairly new yeast  
without much data on it, but I am in no way making an assumption that the yeast
caused what follows to happen. 
 
     It apparently finished at 1.020 on a recipe that finished at 1.014 with 
two different yeasts.  I knew this wasn't a tragedy, but it made me scratch my 
head a bit.  I took another reading a few days later and it was still 1.020. 
 
     This is how the fermentation went.  After several days of good activity 
and four full days in the primary, and another week or so dry hopping in 
secondaries, I checked the carboys this morning, and much to my surprise, there
was about an inch of what appeared to be trub (greenish and silty), sitting on 
top of the yeast that had settled to the bottom of the jar a week ago.  I took 
a gravity and it was 1.014, right on. I then checked the yeast I captured from 
the primary in a ball jar, and it did look pretty free of tub. 
 
Here are some factors that may have contributed: O.G. was 56, cooled from      
a boil to 75F in 15 minutes. Gently sprayed the cooled wort into the fermenter 
(stainless coke can) and drove home with it for 
about 40 minutes. (I brew at my buddy's house sometimes.) Oh yeah, I pitched   
the yeast from a starter (built up from 30ml, 300ml, to 3000ml) before I drove 
home.  We've done this before (but using glass and other yeasts), without any 
strange effects. 
 
    That stainless can just stands there on the floor, wedged between the 
passenger's seat and the dash. Never moves. There isn't much head space in the 
can -- just the domed part, so I have to use blowoff tubes -- they were brand 
new and santized -- into a bucket of One Step solution.  (I'm going to start 
using foam control. What is that stuff actually? Anybody know any inexpensive  
sources?) 
 
    I'm sure some of the more experienced brewers have some ideas on this. 
Private mail is fine. 
 
Thanks in advance,

Subject: prolonged use of bleach


I have a question about the use of bleach to sanitize glass for those of you 
who are knowledgable about chemistry. When I bottle a batch of beer, I rinse 
out my glass fermentation carboy and then fill it with a bleach solution (~ 
1 cup bleach/5 gal water). I then let the carboy sit until the next time I 
brew a batch (about 1 month). My question is: is this prolonged exposure to 
bleach harmful? Can it effect the glass in any way or effect the next batch 
of beer if I rinse the carboy thoroughly? 
 
I also have a related question. How thoroughly must a bleach solution be 
rinsed from bottles? Does the bleach adhere to the glass at all? Is a simple 
single rinse in hot water sufficient? 
 
Thanks for any help.

Avoid it like the plague.  Actually, it's probably fine for sanitizing 
your hands and give you a little extra moisturizing at the same time, but 
stick to standard iodophor.  My farm supply did not have it on the shelf, 
so I asked about it.  They were out at the time, but the next week I got 
it from them at about $20 per gallon. A lot better than the small bottle 
price, and for those of us doing large batches, (don't have time to brew 
often), or lots of brewing the cost savings is immense. Just because you 
don't see it on the shelf is no reason to assume they don't or won't carry 
it.

Subject: Hops, Eisbock


     Hey Brewfans, 
 
     First off a question on Hops.  While I really think Hops is great I 
     would like for some brews to have more hop aroma and little to no hops 
     bitterness for the sake of diversity.  I've tried some different 
     Hopping strategies with no luck.  Any suggestions Hop types ect. that 
     might give more aroma with less bittering. 
 
     Secondly I'm thinking of trying an Eisbock for sh*t's and giggles. 
     Should I get a yeast that will produce down to freezing and try to let 
     the beer freeze a little during the ferment and skim that out or 
     should I ferment normally then freeze and skim right before going to 
     bottle.  Who's tried this? Is it a waste of time? 
 
     Lastly on the killer chiller thread, regardless of top down or bottom 
     up flow it seems a mixing paddle would help.  Maybe something like a 
     copper fin on a copper pipe that you would attach to the chiller 
     itself.  I'm thinking of adding one myself and wonder if the fin is 
     completely submerged and slow rotation is used will HSA really be a 
     factor.

I agree that a concentrated boil will lead to a slightly lower OG than a 
full (5 gallon) boil, but not because of the extract sinking to the bottom. 
What BYO describes is why you would get a lower *reading* but not necessarily 
why you would get a lower OG. 
 
The reason that you would get a slightly lower *actual* OG is because of 
the gravity of the wort that is trapped in the break and (primarily) in the 
spent hops.  When you do a partial boil, your boil can be well over 1.100 SG. 
Losing 8 ounces of this to the hops/trub is more significant than losing 
8 ounces of 1.050 wort. 
 
Let's try a real example, to see how much OG loss we can expect from doing 
a partial (high-gravity) boil.  Let's say we're making 5 gallons of 1.050 
wort, but only boiling 2 gallons.  The boil gravity would start at 1.125 
and (assuming a 1/2-gallon loss during the boil) end up at 1.167.  Let's 
say you lost 8 fluid ounces to hops and trub.  You now have 184 fl. oz. 
(or 1.4375 gallons) of 1.167 wort.  Topping this up to 5 gallons 
(1.4375 gal * 167 points / 5 gallons = 48.0125 points) gives a wort with 
an OG of 1.048.  Had we done a full boil (boiled 5.5 gal down to 5 gal) 
and only topped up with 8 ounces to make up for the hop/break loss, the 
OG would be 1.049 (actually, 1.049375).  If the loss to hops/break would 
be 16 ounces, the difference would (of course) be even bigger. 
 
[Please forgive me for using far more precision in my math than our scales 
or measuring cups would allow, but this is just an illustration.] 
 
What you suggest is possible, but the accurate measurement of the concentrated 
wort is rather difficult.  It is not "impossible" to mix the wort so it is 
all homogeneous as BYO suggests.  You just have to be aware of the fact that 
you must mix well and be sure to maintain good sanitation. 
 
Since the original poster said he was boiling 3 gallons (presumably down 
to 2.5 or so), unless he was making a Barleywine or some other high-gravity 
style, the loss would be between 1 and 2 specific gravity points.

Subject: Chilling Tales/RIMS job question/Pleasing rats


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager... 
 
I have made it my policy that if I cannot remain current with the HBD reading 
(and I have not been able to due to the shear volume of it lately - yeah, I 
know: wah, wah, wah.), that I would not post anything in response to a thread 
(something a few others might try). Don't like being a voice in the chorus 
anyway... 
 
Regardless of my principles, I wish to give the clap - er, um APPLAUD Michael 
Gerholdt on his knowledge and presence of mind in HBD 2249. The concept with 
the immersion chiller is chillingly similar to that of a counterflow chiller 
(and most other efficient heat exchangers): keep the temperature differential 
between the coolant and that to be cooled at a MAXIMUM. 
 
As an oversimplification of the concept involved, the coolant and hot liquid 
will want to equalize at some point between the two temperature extremes - 
say at the middle. By normal physical properties, the cooler wort will be 
near the bottom, and the warmer near the top, right? Let's put the upper wort 
at, say, 200'F and the cooler wort at 190'f. (All the wort in the middle can 
be wherever the hell it likes 'cuz we're ignoring it and the coils in contact 
with it. Like I said: oversimplified.) Put your tap water at 70'F. 
 
Putting the inlet at the bottom, will result in a loss of temperature of 
(190-70)/2 = 60'F in our (and I stress) OVERSIMPLIFIED example. Next pass, 
since the cool stuff stays low, you lose (130-70)/2 = 30'F - and 
progressively less. Putting it at the top, you maximize the differential and 
gain another 5'F of lost temperature in the first pass alone! (hard to talk 
this way, but I don't feel like calculating the differential heat loss. 
Besides, temp is our metric...). Plus, the natural tendency for the cooler 
liquid to fall ensures that the hottest portion is in contact with the 
coolest of the coils 100% of the time in our, again, OVERSIMPLIFIED model 
(OK, so I lied: we didn't *totally* ignore the wort in the middle). 
 
So there. And I've breached my own rule. 
 
================================================= 
 
As I draw to completion my RIMS system, I am left with a bit of a quandary 
that I just *KNOW* some of the guys who finally convinced me to get off my 
dead ass and build one have encountered and solved already (That'd be you, 
Dion and YOU, Royster - But I'm open from advice and suggestions to any 
RIMS-wise Brewmanoid life-forms). I would really LIKE to take temperature 
readings at the inlet and outlet of the heating chamber. Initially, I'l like 
to do it with simple bi-metal thermometers, and thought a 1/8" compression 
fitting might do the job admirably - 'cept I can't find one. The 
cork-in-the-1/2"-pipe-with-a-thermometer-rammed-in is just... ...not... 
...elegant enough. How did y'all handle this? 
 
Eventually, (read: once I get my shtuff together and write the 'wares) I'll 
be controlling this from a junque 386 loafing in my basement. At that time, 
I'll want to use some electronic means of reading the temp, which offers up 
even more challenging thingies to think about! Thermistor? Thermocouple? 
Bimetal? Small animal with EEG connected to the pain centers? And what of 
probe design and <Shudder> EPOXY?!? 
 
Any guidance will surely get the chamber off my workbench and onto the mash 
tun where it belongs! (And would be appreciated to boot!) 
 
Sorry, Steve, to turn the attention of the HBD on RIMS once again, but there 
are those of us who are keenly interested in the subject. I'll be sure to let 
you know the effects of pump shear on my proteins. 
 
================================ 
 
There, Scott! You happy? I've posted again. (Drat! Just spilled my `at`#$%ing 
coffee on the mouse pad. Rickum rackum...)
