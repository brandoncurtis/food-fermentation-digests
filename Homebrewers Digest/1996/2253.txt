Subject: There should be two digests


I have come to the conclusion that there should be two Homebrew Digests. 
 
There should be Homebrew Digest, this is the place where people talk about 
brewing and are nice to eachother.  This is the place where if you have a 
question you don't have to be afraid to ask it.  This is the Digest you 
subscribe to if you wanted useful info on homebrewing (no matter what type 
you like to do). 
 
Then there should be the other one, The flamming Digest.  This is where 
you go if you want to get into somebodies face becuase they don't have 
the same opinion as you.  This is where you go if you could care less 
about conveying usefull info.  This is where you go if you want to clutter 
up a digest with your opinion that most people don't care about. 
 
I'm sorry If this sounds bad.  I'm sure there are alot of others who 
aggree with me.  The digest has been turning into peoples strong opinions 
about trivial things.  I know these people have much valuable information 
which can help everyone.  I am begging, please stop.  Most of the digests 
have been flame wars lately, I wish it was the way it use to be...more 
info less opinions.  It looks like one guy has already quit (temporarily) 
because of this.

Terry reminded me of my long-ago days being involved with science fiction 
fans.  There were two ancient acronyms (hope I get 'em right), which summed 
up the different approaches to life: 
 
FIAWOL = Fandom Is A Way Of Life 
FIJAGDH = Fandom Is Just A Goddamn Hobby 
 
Lot of opportunity for conflict there, especially among the group who 
subscribes to the former: HBIAWOL or BIAWOL. 
 
I find it valuable to simply check out every once in a while, take 
a few months off from reading or posting to the HBD.  Go out and 
try something different.  Gives one some real perspective.

Subject: Chillers/priming


 
 
Howdy all, I've been lurking for a few weeks now and have generated enough 
questions and comments that I figured it's time to post. So far I've brewed 
up 6 batches with what I would consider excellent succes except for the last 
two. 
 
My previous batch was an Octoberfest following Charlies recepie from his first 
book, (the winky-dink to be specific) All went well, we used wyeast 2??? Bavari
an Lager. Racked after about a week then lagered at above optimum temp for abou
t a month after that. We bottled some really clear beer about a week ago and 
tested a bottle yesterday -> totally flat and sweet from the priming sugar. I'm
guessing that the yeast conked out on me and I'll have to put a few drops of 
reconstituted dry yeast in each bottle to prime. 
 
I also brewed my first mash extract yesterday also following a Papazian recepie
(Mongolian bock from Companion). Boy oh boy.. took way longer than I thought, 
temperatures were all over the place, but i did get complete conversion and 
I'm not worried that it will turn out bad, however, while transfering to 
the carboy, i managed to transfer alot of trub. We tried the whirlpool thang 
but couldn't get it to work without clogging. So, heres the question.  Instead 
of having the same non-conditioning problems with this batch as last, I would 
like to save some of the dregs from this batch, collecting when racking to 
secondary, and re-pitch at bottling time to avoid the problem I'm having 
with my Ocoberfest. Questions are: 
 
1) is re pitching an eyedropper full of dry yeast into my non-primed octoberfes
t a good Idea, 
 
2) is pitching at bottling time for my bock a good Idea, and how should I go 
about saving the Dregs? Just pitch some into a starter wort, let it sit at 
room temp for a day, toss it into the fridge untill one day before bottle time,
re pitch into a starter or what. 
 
Now here comes the comment section. Whats all this talk about whether cold 
water should enter the top or the bottom of your immersion chiller? Around 
here, we've been arguing for months on whether entering from the left works 
better than entering from the right ;5) !! (Hmmm fit that one into your 
paradigm)No seriously, I made an el cheepo wort chiller out of like 12' of 
3/8" copper with the cool stuff entering from the top (althougha left to right 
cooler may quell all of these silly discussions) and managed to bring about 
3 gallons of boiling wort down to <79F in about 15 minutes, I agitated the 
whole kettle in a wash basin that was collecting the still cold chiller wast 
water. When I wasn't agitating, the was water got cold. as soon as I started 
swirling, the exit water from the chiller got significantly warmer. Hmmm. I 
wonder what the most important factor in imersion chilling is? 
 
Anyways, Thanks for any help,

Subject: To Aerate or Not to Aerate


I have a question for the assembled HBD masses. I have racked my Imperial 
Stout (starting gravity 1.111!) from the primary to the secondary fermenter. 
All activity with the primary yeast had stalled out at 1.050, two weeks after 
starting the fermentation. I am preparing a fresh dose of yeast to knock the 
gravity down another 20 points or so. 
 
My question is, should I aerate the wort when adding the new yeast? Or, at 
this late date in the gave, will that cause oxidation in the beer? 
 
Thanks in advance for your help,

Subject: Re: "Old Yeast" / ESB Yeast


IMO I would not choose the Irish for the yeast to use in the ESB. It 
would not be the worst choice but also would not be my first. Some 
people like to use the same yeast for different beers because it worked 
well the last time, or in a brewery because of cost and cross 
contamination but we are home brewers ; ) 
Anyway my choice for an ESB would be to use WYeast ESB (Do not remember 
the nimber off hand). I have never used the London, but that "might" be 
alright? I would not use any of the American yeast for this style such 
as Chico (1056) or the one used by Pugsley. They would make an alright 
beer but not a true ESB.

I seem to recall a posting some years back, where someone ended up 
with beer that was cold on the bottom and hot at the top, from using 
an immersion chiller where the water entered at the bottom without 
stirring. 
 
Just one data point.

Subject: obnoxious, Instant Lager, and the Aussie Recirculator


 
My personal pledge: 
I'll attempt to engage in no more obnoxious authoritarian BS as long as I 
can.  I promise that I'll engage in no personal attacks, unless of course my 
mother in law begins posting to this forum.  I'll forgive and forget, and 
extract only those gems of information which are supported by data.  I'll 
ignore those which are not supported by data, and those which I don't 
understand.  I'll relax, brew in plastic if I want, and know that most of my 
brewing technique is lousy enough that effects of minutae at this time will 
not measurably negatively impact my beer.  Hopefully, someday, they will. 
   I'll also probably try out every neato idea I read, and proceed on my own 
to make better beer.  I won't bitch about the AHA, HSA, Wyeast, or RIMS. 
I'll laugh at babcock's jokes.    I'll not waste bandwith any more.  And I 
will type with a happy heart and hope for my fellow brewers. 
 
The recent yeast thread, started by JSchmidling, about pitching on top of 
other yeast: 
A couple of questions....is there any taste difference to these fast 
ferments?   Do you chill your wort down real low (say, 5 degrees C or so) 
prior to pitching? Does the increased fermentation activity generate 
additional heat in the beer?  I'm gonna try this with a porter this weekend, 
using Wyeast London yeast in the secondary now fermenting a lighter ale. 
 
For those interested, the Aussie recirculation system (which I think is 
really groovy) is similar to vertical circulation wells used to extract 
volatile chemicals from ground water.  I found a paper on flow regarding 
these wells, with integrals, differential equations, and everything, 
describing flow within these kinds of systems.  It was written  by Philip 
and Walter, in the Sept.-Oct. 1992 issue of Ground Water, v. 30, no. 5. 
  The solution to the flow problem seems relevant to model wort flow in this 
system. 
 
Cheers.

Attention Foam Rangers HB Club members or readers in the Seattle area: 
 
Are the results of either the recent Dixie Cup or Great NW HB competitions 
posted anywhere online?  I checked the Foam Rangers home page and it hasn't 
been updated in three weeks. The Great NW competition was a companion event 
of the Great NW Microbrew Invitational - can't tell if there's a club 
behind it.

Subject: Re: Carbonation question


G'day again, 
 
In 2251 Michael asked about his under-gassing problem. 
 
Firstly, even in an "All-malt" brew I prime my bottles with white cane 
sugar.  The small amount used seem to make no difference to the taste or 
mouth-feel but is always, by nature, of a consistent fermentability. 
 
Your basement may be colder than your last place and this will make a 
big difference considering that you only leave it one and a half weeks 
which I think is a bit short. Bare minimum of two, preferably longer. 
You say you get a "Shhh" sound when you open the bottle - it is obvious 
that CO2 has been produced but it takes a while to dissolve into the 
beer so my humble advice is put it in a warmer place (20C/70F) and/or 
leave it longer before you drink it - very hard sometimes! 
 
Cheers, 
 
Paul

Subject: Re: How Hard to boil


G'day all, 
 
Steven Bortnick asked in 2251 "How hard to boil". 
I remember my second form (Year 8?) science teacher telling me that as 
water boils at 100C (212F) if you apply more heat you can't make the 
water any hotter than that, no matter how fast the water is boiling. 
You will just produce more steam and use more gas. 
 
This obviously would apply to wort as well.  I'm not an expert, but if 
temperature is the critical part a slow boil will do the same as a fast 
boil.  If it is more important that the wort is rolling quickly then 
thats a different matter.  Again, any experts? 
 
Cheers 
 
Paul

Subject: Re: Aroma Hops/Size of HBD


G'day yet again, 
 
In HBD 2252 Cory Chadwell asked about aroma hops. 
 
Any low alpha acid hops will give you aroma/flavour without the 
bitterness.  Your home brew shop will be able to tell you the AAU 
percentage (bitterness) for their hops.  Be sure not to boil them 
because then you will lose the aroma and flavour but be left with the 
bitterness.  I have been told it is best not to put them in the 
fermenter until fermentation has slowed down because you will lose the 
aroma through your air lock.  I have tried a few varieties like Saaz, 
Hallertau, Hersbruker but now I nearly only use Saaz (must be Czech 
grown) even though they are sometimes hard to get here - I reckon you 
can't go past them. 
 
Some people are complaining about the length and frequency of the HBD. 
I agree it takes a while to go through it all but I wouldn't miss it for 
the world.  I use the HBD Browser program which I got from The Brewery 
on the net.  It makes reading the HBD so much easier.  You see all the 
topics at the top of the screen with the text down the bottom, you just 
click on the topics you want to read.  If you aren't using it yet I 
recommend it. Thank you Don Hatlestad for writing it and letting us have 
it for free - aren't Home Brewers wonderful people?! 
 
Cheers, 
 
Paul.

Well, as usual, I relaxed, didn't worry, and drank homebrew ;^) My Dopplebock 
turned out fantastic -- 2 weeks in the primary 
at 40 degrees F, then two weeks in the secondary `at` 40F, then 2 more weeks 
lagering at 30F (!) after which I bottled, and am 
now in the process of conditioning. The leftover beer (~4-5oz) tasted very 
malty, ('prolly due to the Wyeast Bohemian yeast) 
with good hop bitterness (~22 IBU's), and no perceptible hop flavor or aroma. 
Now for something completely the same -- I just 
acquired a corny keg system, and when I first powered (sic) it up, only got a 
hair above 500# on a 5# bottle. I force 
carbonated some cream soda for the kids as a test, and now after two days am 
down to almost no CO2. There are no leaks, even 
under water, and yet I don't see how I could get so little CO2 from a 5# bottle
which *theoretically* should have well over 
1500# of pressure on a full cylinder. Perhaps it was filled on a hot day, and 
being in my lagering chest (a converted 16 cu. 
ft. Hotpoint fridge) at 40F, the net results are to be expected...any ideas?

Subject: IPA and Acronyms


 
A little late to be topical, but the Lagunitas Brewing Co. of 
Petaluma, CA has released a special batch of IPA as their 100th batch. 
It is pretty close "to style", at least as I understand it.  Not quite 
a "Wall of Hops", but definately bitter-beer-face material.  (from the 
label; pale, caramel, munich, and wheat malt, with 45.6 IBU Willamette 
and Mt. Hood hops, O.G. 1.059) 
 
Also, the acronym list has gotten a little carried away, but thanks 
for those who took the time to contribute.  I was surprised how many 
there were.

Has anyone found a source for heavy duty (nylon?) gaskets that 
can be used inside a AB keg kettle? 
Or better yet a conversion kit like what used to be offered by 
Stainless in Seattle for non-welded brew kettle keg conversion? 
 
Please respond by e-mail.

RE: Copy of: Insulated mash tuns 
 
Dave Burley responded to Chuck Bernard's query about insulated mash tuns by 
saying that a tun insulated by a styrofoam box will lose about 2 degrees per 30
minutes. This is not the case in my slightly different system and I've outlined
my technique for an infusion mash below. 
 
I mash in a plastic bin with a perforated  plate about 2-3mm from the bottom. 
The run off tap is set in a small well below this. 
The bin sits inside a double skin 3-ply box (made well oversize) which has a 
similar lid. Provision is made in the wall of the box for the passage of 
thermometer leads and tubing etc using short lengths of brass tube cemented in 
place. 
 
SWITCH TO METRIC UNITS HERE (sorry!) 
 
I heat my liquor in a boiler and run it into the mash tun (inside the box) at 
about 80-82C. The temperature of this water quickly stabilizes at about 74C and
more slowly drops to my strike temperature of  72C-- say 15 minutes. When this 
point is reached (and an alarm thermometer is very useful here) the grain is 
added at the rate of 2.2 litres per kilogram, a rotating sparge arm fitted into
place, and the lid is placed on the box.. The temperature quickly falls to, and
stabilizes at, the initial temperature of 66C. Over the next 30 minutes the 
temperature rises slightly, by 0.5C or so, and then fall gradually back to 66C 
over the next hour which is usually the end of my allotted mash time. 
 
I then connect the sparge water to the appropriate brass tube and sparge 
without
opening the box. I have only just modified to system to do this so I have no 
empirical data to pass on. 
 
I believe the slight raise in temperature on adding the grain my be explained 
by
either of the following or perhaps both. 
 
1. The bin and box are preheated to, say 80C, and when the temperature of the 
grain/liquor falls below this the tun/box gives up some of its heat to the 
mash.
 
2. There is a series of exothermic reactions which occur when dry grain is 
mixed
with water which slightly raises the temperature. 
 
So in my experience it is possible to hold an infusion mash at, or at least 
acceptably close to, the saccharification temperature for 90 minutes using an 
insulated mash tun.

Subject: Recirculation


Fellow Brewers, 
 
Anybody have any thoughts on recirculation of runnings in the mash 
tun?  I've secured a small Grainger solution pump and have wired it 
up with a motor speed controller and have configured my system to 
"automate" the recirculation process.  I mash in an insulated cooler 
so I don't have a way to directly add heat (a la RIMS), but I'm 
considering recirculating the mash liquor for a portion of mash, 
say, the last 20 minutes.  Any thoughts??? 
 
TIA, 
 
Jim

Subject: raising gravity with extract


I plan on brewing my first high gravity beer soon, an Imperial Stout. 
My first full mash went well (it's almost done carbonating) and I want 
to mash again.  I was thinking of adding some extract to the kettle to 
bring my gravity up to the nether reaches so I wouldn't have to mash 
the large amount of grain required for such a high OG.  In looking 
through various sources though, most suggest adding the extract to the 
collected wort and limiting boil to 1 hour.  Why not boil the collected 
wort for 1/2 hour, THEN add the extract and continue boiling for an 
hour?  Is there some reason not to do this that I don't see, or is it 
just a convenience thing?

Following the precept that people with nothing worthwhile to say 
should keep quiet, I generally do.  Even so, I can't sit silently while 
Al K., one of very few reasons why the digest is worth downloading, is 
criticized.  I often look over the TOC, and don't bother reading if Al's 
name isn't listed. 
 
We could have a much more useful, readable HBD: 
 
1.  Don't make personal comments. 
2.  Don't use language your Mother wouldn't like. 
3.  Don't carry on personal conversations of no interst to others. 
4.  If you really have no idea as to the correct answer to a question, 
perhaps you shouldn't try to answer it. 
5.  If you can't think of any reason for other people to be interested 
in your post, think twice before posting it. 
 
That's all I'll say. If HBD gets worse, I will slip away silently. 
 
So long, and thanks for all the fish  . . . .

    I have a Heart's counterflow chiller and love it. Works 
perfectly--cools wort down to the same temperature as the cooling water. 
For lagers, I put my old immersion chiller in line on the upstream side of 
the cooling water, submerge it in an ice water bath, and get wort at 
ready-to-pitch temperature. Massive cold break, as well. I would see no 
problems with 20-30 gallon batches--I drain by gravity flow and the rate is 
good. 
    On another subject, I will be in Boston several times in the next few 
weeks. Anyone have recommendations on brewpubs in the area? Private email 
is fine. Thanks.

Subject: Time-limited brewing


Good day brew collective: 
 
I wanted to run a proposal past the group to determine if there are any 
problems associated with it. 
 
I am thinking about splitting my brewing into two chunks so I could brew on 
two consecutive nights: 
 
Chunk 1:  Clean/sanitize brew equipment 
               Mash and Lauter 
 
Chunk 2:  Boil 
               chill and pitch. 
 
I am theorizing that this would work because boiling the second night would 
kill off any nasties left from the mash etc.  The mash liquor would be kept in 
a stainless steel kettle with saran (tm) wrap covering the top to keep any 
stuff out.  The setup would be left in place so all I would have to do when I 
returned home on the 2nd night is to fire up the propane cooker. 
 
Is this workable, or will the brew gods smite me for trying to save some time. 
 Any anecdotal evidence would be appreciated. 
 
Regards 
Robert

I have corrected it. As luck would have it,  all my other closings in my 
e-mailer were correct except for this one. Sorry for the inconvenience. That's 
one of the great things about technoogy, sometimes you get to make the same

Beware of HSA. Before you transfer your wort through the air or aerate it, 
chill
it to near room temperature.

Mash-in is the act of first adding water to the grist or abbreviated from 
"mashing -in temperature" it is the  temperature of the mash after water is 
first added. Mash out is the act of heating the mash to a stabilizing 
temperature just before lautering. Likewise, abbreviated "mashing-out 
temperature is..."  Mash-out is usually 167-170F to stop further enzyme action 
and stabilize the % fermentability of the wort. Lautering is the separation of 
the wort from the spent grains.

Actually, my main point was that there is a difference between the baker's 
yeast
model quoted so often in explaining the Pasteur effect and brewer's yeast. 
Brewer's yeast does not stop producing ethanol in the presence of oxygen like 
baker's yeast, except if the sugar concentration is below 1%. Brewer's yeast is
"imperfect" at higher concentrations of sugar and continues to produce alcohol 
(even though this is an "anerobic" process normally) even in the presence of 
oxygen.  This is the contre-Pasteur or "Crabtree effect".

There are two.  Samuel Adams of Tadcaster in England is an import.  Try his 
Oatmeal Stout or Pale Ale. Samuel Adams ( aka Jim Koch) Boston Beer Co. is not 
an import, except maybe from Pennsylvania.

RusD1 says in jest, as he votes with his feet, how he feels about  the low 
personalized level to which HBd has shrunk : 
 
>And now back to your regular broadcast... (Hey, Al K., I think Dave Burley 
>just called you a liar again...). 
 
Just for the record, I have never called AlK a liar that I recall and don't 
believe he is one.  He did call someone a liar when they falsely ( I presume) 
accused  him of filling their e-mailbox with trash as a result of a 
disagreement. 
 
Our much discussed disagreeement is not based on ethics, nor on Al's excellent 
technical contributions here, but of approach to how members of this forum 
should be treated.  I vote for respect, even in cases where a person may be 
incorrect.  Most "newbies" in this forum are mature, highly skilled, highly 
educated people and everyone should be treated this way. From time to time, 
everyone makes mistakes or needs to have a position modified once in a while by
pointing out an error or refining a set of conditions. I expect to be 
corrrected, as should other contributors, even though I am as careful as I can 
be within the limits of my time and reference material available to me.  Like 
everyone here I do not have peer review on everything I write, so there are 
bound to be screw-ups. There should be no shame in making an honest mistake and
having it corrected, only pleasure from both participants. One for having his 
own knowledge expanded, the other for having given the gift of knowledge. 
 
Brewing is a combination of art and science and sometimes there are no black 
and
white rules. As a result, there will be differences of opinion and that is one 
reason for this forum - to air all sides openly.  Let's actively discuss, 
correct and modify each others comments as needed, but do it respectfully. 
 
Remember the goal of HBD is to brew better beer, and to have fun doing it with 
your virtual brew buddies.
