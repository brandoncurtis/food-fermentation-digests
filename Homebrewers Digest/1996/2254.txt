Subject: Lagering facilities?


I have a question for the general audience concerning lagering 
facilities. As of now, I am only able to make ales because I have no 
where to hold a carboy below 60 degrees. I would like to make a 
unit that will hold a couple of  carboys for lagering. The easiest 
and most reliable means is a refrigerator. I am looking for 
other ideas that might be a little more cost effective. I would 
appreciate any ideas and insight that anyone has (especially 
things that work for you). Thanks in advance for any responses. 
Personal e-mail responses are welcomed.

Subject: dry hopping


Hello group, 
 
I have dry hopped quite a few american pale 
ales with whole hops and seem to get ok results. 
Does anybody out there use pellet hops for dry 
hopping??  I think I've seen it written that the 
pellet hops sink.  Is that true??  I'm thinking 
of trying an experiment where I dry hop two 
identical batches, one with whole hops, one with 
pellets and see if there's any noticable difference. 
Has anyone already tried such an experiment?? 
 
Thanks, 
Mike D.

hello, 
this is my first post.  i have learned quite a bit on this mailing list and 
want to thank all who have contributed.  onto my request. 
a couple of weeks ago i drank a bottle of pete's wicked maple porter, and 
quite frankly - loved it.  now i want to brew it.  i have found a few 
generic maple porter and stout recipes on cats meow, an extract recipe list 
and on rec.crafts.brewing.  but what i want is one that will produce pete's 
maple porter - that is, someone who drank pwmp, brewed their own and 
hopefully duplicated the recipe.  i have not made the plunge into all-grain 
(mostly because of a lack of time), so it would have to be an extract 
recipe.  can anybody help?  tia...

Subject: Secondary Carbonation


Hello All, 
 
Yesterday I racked an IPA into the carboy after a 4 day ferment (1056). 
Compared to my previous efforts, all brown/dark ales, there was quite a bit 
of carbonation. Is there such a thing as 'normal' carbonation in the primary 
(or secondary), or is this a sign of future problems i.e., overcarbonation 
in the bottle. The only difference in my methodology was to put the primary 
in a tub with water, towels, and frozen 20 0z soda bottles (3), rather then 
let it sit on the floor `at` room temp. 
 
Thanks,

Dear Sirs: 
 
I wish to complain about the large number of complaints about people 
complaining.  It used to be that if someone was complaining, nobody 
complained about it.  I hate to complain, but all this complaining 
about complaints has me in complaint. 
I suggest bombing the complaintants in their homes, and gunning them down with 
machine guns when they run out into the streets.  Some of my views aren't 
very popular, and although I am a Gynecologist, this is my lunch hour.

     I forward this with full knowledge of the possible flames that I may 
     receive from the list.  I considered making editorial notes, but 
     decided against this fearing more flames.  The only comments that I 
     have is that on the Suckpoint should have 7 subtracted from all 
     entries, and that I whole heartedly aggree to Millers comments on gun 
     control. Thanks and enjoy. 
 
 
     Additional - I have not received the list since Oct 22, nor have I

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
     Dear Sir or Madam, 
 
           I have been a drinker of Miller beer's for many years (actually, 
     ever since that other company donated a big chunk of change to Handgun 
     Control Inc. back in the mid 80's). 
 
           Initially, my beer of choice was Lite, but some time in mid 1990 
     while in Honduras I switched to MGD smuggled up from Panama. Now, for 
     nearly six years, I have been a faithful drinker of MGD. 
 
           For these past years, I have come to expect certain things from 
     Genuine Draft. I expect that whenever I see that gold can of MGD, I am 
     about ready to enjoy a great, smooth brew. 
 
           But wait!  Sometime around the first of the year, my beloved MGD 
     changed colors, so to speak. That familiar gold can was no longer 
     gold!  Knowing that I am, by nature, somewhat resistant to change, I 
     forced myself to reserve Judgment on the new can design. 
 
           Gradually, I grew to appreciate the new label. 
 
           That was until about May of this year.  That was when I 
     discovered (empirically) that I really didn't like the new design. 
     Further investigation of the cause of my distress resulted in the 
     following observations: 
 
           1. Your cans are made of aluminum. 
           2. Aluminum is a great conductor of energy. 
           3. Your beer is commonly consumed outside, and thus, the 
              container may be exposed to sunlight. 
           4. Sunlight striking the can causes radiant warming of the 
              surface of the can. 
           5. The resultant heat (energy) is transferred through the 
              aluminum,  by conduction, to the contents of the can (the 
              beer). 
           6. Warm beer sucks. 
 
           This is a process that can be observed in just about any beer. 
     However, this process is significantly accelerated in MGD because you 
     painted the damn can black!!! 
 
           Who was the rocket scientist that designed the new graphic for 
     the can and implemented the change right before summer?  Granted, this 
     process may not be real evident up there in Wisconsin, but down here 
     in Oklahoma where the summers are both sunny and hot, this effect is 
     quite a problem. There's no telling what the folks in Texas and 
     Arizona are having to put up with. (NO SHIT !) 
 
        Knowing that you would probably not address this issue unless you 
     had firm evidence of a problem, I and several other subjects conducted 
     extensive experimentation.  The results of these experiments are 
     listed below. 
 
           The experiments were conducted over two days on the deck next to 
     my pool. The study included seven different types of beer (leftovers 
     from a party the previous weekend) that were initially chilled to 38 
     and then left exposed to sunlight for different lengths of time. 
     These beers were sampled by the test subjects at different intervals. 
     The subjects,  all normally MGD drinkers, were asked at each sampling 
     interval their  impressions of the different beers. 
 
           The length of time between the initial exposure to sunlight and 
     the point where the subject determined the sample undrinkable (the 
     Suckpoint) was determined.  The average ambient temperature for the 
     trials was 95 degrees F. 
 
           Beer Type                    Average Suckpoint (min) 
 
           Miller Lite (white can)              6.2 
           Bud (white can)                      5.5 
           Bud Lite (silver can)                5.2 
           Ice House (blue and silver can)      4.4 
           Coors Lite (silver can)              4.1 
           Miller Genuine Draft (black can)     2.8 
           Coors (gold can)                     0.1 
 
           It was evident that the color of the can directly correlates to 
     the average suckpoint, except for Coors which was pretty much 
     determined to suck at any point. 
 
           It is to be hoped that you will consider re-designing your MGD 
     cans.  All beer drinkers that are not smart enough to keep their beer 
     in the shade will thank you. 
 
           Sincerely,

     _____________________________________________________________ 
 
          I have a friend that works for Miller Brewing in Milwaukee and 
     she knew about the letter sent in by Bradley Lee.  She sent me the 
     Miller response and it appears below.  She says they have had a lot of 
     fun with this guys letter. 
 
           Enjoy. 
     ___________________________________________________________ 
 
           Dear Bradley Lee, 
 
           Thank you for your letter and your concern about the MGD can 
     color as it relates to premature warming of the contents.  Like you, 
     we at Miller  Beer take beer drinking very seriously.  To that end, we 
     have taken your  letter and subsequent experiment under serious 
     consideration.  Outlined  below are our findings and solution to your 
     problem.  May we add that we  have had similar letters from other 
     loyal beer drinkers, mostly from the  Southern United States. 
 
           First, let us congratulate you on your findings.  Our analysis 
     tends to agree with yours regarding Coors.  It certainly does suck at 
     about any temperature. 
 
           Now, it was our intentions when redesigning the MGD can to 
     create better brand identity and brand loyalty.  Someone in marketing 
     did some kind of research and determined we needed to redesign the 
     can.   You will be pleased to know, we have fired that idiot and he is 
     now reeking havoc at a pro-gun control beer manufacturer.  The design 
     staffer working in cahoots with the marketing idiot was also 
     down-sized. 
 
           However, once we realized this mistake, to undo it would have 
     been even a bigger mistake.  So, we took some other actions.  From our 
     market  research, we found a difference between Northern beer drinker 
     and Southern beer drinkers. 
 
           Beer drinkers in the South tend to drink slower than beer 
     drinkers in the North.  We are still researching why that is.  Anyway, 
     at Miller Beer, it was never our intentions to have someone take more 
     than 2.5 minutes to enjoy one of our beers.  We pride ourselves in 
     creating fine, smooth, quick drinking beers and leave the making of 
     sissy, slow sipping  beers to that Sam guy in Boston. 
 
           However, it is good to know that you feel our Miller Lite can 
     last as long as 6 minutes.  However, may we suggest in the future you 
     try consuming at least two in that time frame. 
 
           From your letter, we had our design staff work 'round the clock 
     to come up with a solution that would help not just MGD but all our 
     fine Miller products. 
 
           We hope you have recently noticed our solution to your problem. 
     We found that the hole in the top of the can was not big enough for 
     quick consumption. 
 
           So, we have now introduced the new "Wide Mouth" cans.  We hope 
     this will solve all your problems.  Might I also suggest that if you 
     want to get the beer out of the can even faster,  you can poke a hole 
     on the side near the bottom, hold your finger over it, open the can, 
     tip it to your mouth and then pull your finger off the hole.  This is 
     a common way to drink beer at parties and impress your friends. This 
     technique is known as "shot-gunning". 
 
           You should like the name. 
 
           Again, thank you for your letter and bring to our attention that 
     there might be other beer drinkers taking more that 2.5 minutes to 
     drink our beers.  Let me assure you that I am have our advertising 
     department work on campaign to solve this problem, too. 
 
           Sincerely, 
 
           Tom B. Miller 
 
           Public Relations 
           Miller Brewing Co. 
 
           P.S. And remember, at Miller Beer we do favor gun control, too. 
     So please use two hands when firing.

The colder the brew is while fermenting, the more carbonation it will hold. 
 
The following chart was compiled by Dave Draper and shows the co2 in 
solution at varying temperatures. As you can see the higher the temp 
the less co2.

Greetings, 
 
I am interested in beginning a thread on the Beer-Lambert Law (often 
called Beer's Law), a topic which has been discussed fairly recently in 
Brewing Techniques and elsewhere See: 
< http://www.brewingtechniques.com/brewingtechniques/beerslaw /index.html > 
It seems to me there is no consensus among brewers (or homebrewers) 
about the applicability of the Beer-Lambert Law to beer. 
 
For those of you who don't know or have forgotten, Beer's Law says that 
each molecule of a dissolved pigment absorbs the same fraction of light 
which is incident upon it.  The related Beer-Lambert Law says that the 
fraction of incident radiation absorbed is proportional to the number of 
absorbing molecules.  The Beer-Lambert Law is often stated mathematically 
as: 
 
A = log(Io/I) = ecl 
 
where A is absorbance, a dimensionless number; Io is the irradiance of 
incident energy; I is the irradiance of transmitted energy; e is the molar 
extinction coeficient (1/(mol*cm); c is the pigment concentration (mol/L); 
l is the pathlength of radiation through the sample cell (typically, 1 
cm). 
 
Why is the Beer-Lambert Law important to brewers?  Basically, because 
absorbance measurements are used to describe the darkness (or color) of 
beer.  Interestingly, it has been claimed by George Fix, Ray Daniels and 
others that beer (the beverage) does not obey Beer-Lambert (the law). 
Countering this claim, several contributors to Brewing Techniques have 
claimed that Beer does indeed obey the Beer-Lambert Law.  I do not have 
access to all these articles, particularly Ray Daniel's original Brewing 
Techniques article and George Fix's original exegesis about beer and the 
Beer-Lambert law.  However, the on-line materials by Miles Snow and 
Alisdair Boraston (see URL above), both of which claim that beer does 
indeed obey the Beer-Lambert Law, seem very convincing. 
 
Have George Fix and Ray Daniels recanted?  If not, perhaps they could 
explain WHY beer does not obey the Beer-Lambert Law.  I can think of three 
possible reasons which spectroscopists commonly encounter (but can correct 
for): 
 
1.  Light scattering, which leads to an over-estimate of A (absorbance). 
To me, this seems likely in beer (particularly homebrew) since there may 
be suspended particles or gas bubbles which scatter light. 
 
2.  Fluorescence, which leads to an under-estimate of A.  To me, this 
seems unlikely to make a major contribution in beer. 
 
3.  Sieve Effect, which leads to an underestimate of A.  To me, this also 
seems unlikely. 
 
Perhaps Mr. Fix and Mr. Daniels could be encouraged to give their views. 
 
Cheers!

Hello, all - this is my first post to the digest.  I'm an avid homebrewer who

Clearly, this is _not_ true.  If the cold temperature out is very close to the 
cold temperature in, that just means that the amount of water being sent 
through he cooler is probably much larger than it needs to be.  If there is a 
temperature difference between the cooling water and the wort, there will

This is only true if the wort is absolutely unstirred. Assuming the water temp 
is always at least 10 deg. below the wort, you will continue to get reasonable 
heat transferred.

Correct - a counterflow heat exchanger has the hot fluid inlet and the cold 
fluid outlet at the same end.  This produces the largest _average_ 
difference in temperature over the length of the chiller. 
 
Although the temperature difference is important in heat exchange, there are 
two other factors that effect the rate of heat transfer.  The easiest one to 
get a handle on is the area available for heat transfer.  For an immersion 
chiller, this translates to building the largest coil that you can immerse 
in your wort.  It also means that if you are building a coiled chiller, you 
should space the coils a reasonable distance apart, so that the entire 
circumference of the tube, along the entire length is in contact with the 
wort, not with another part of the tube. 
 
That being said, the final factor that is often overlooked in these chiller 
designs, is that the heat transfer is affected by a series of resistances 
that combine to form a heat-transfer coefficient.  The primary resistances 
for a simple tube-type heat exchanger is the wall of the exchanger, and the 
fluid film resistance both inside and outside of the tube.  Heat (energy) 
has to flow through each of these resistances in series, so that if one of 
them is very large, then the overall heat transfer will be slowed.  The wall 
of the tube 
resistance has to do with the type of metal used for its constuction.  Since 
the standard for homebrewing seems to be Copper, which has a high 
conductivity, and thus a low resistance, that should be fine.  For an 
immersion chiller, the water flowing on the inside of the tube has a very 
thin film if it's flowing rapidly enough, so that resistance should be 
small.  The problem comes with the outside of the tube where the wort is 
just sitting there, with some possible natural convection going on.  Here 
the film can be relatively thick, and there can be a high resistance to heat 
transfer. 
 
The obvious solution is that you _must_ agitate the wort in some way to 
achieve high rates of heat transfer  Now I know that you don't want aeration 
in the wort, but you can still mix the fluid without aeration - look into 
using an impeller type mixer, and run it at low RPM.  Any amount of forced 
convection (stirring) in the wort will improve the heat transfer over 
natural convection.  Another added bounus is that you no longer have to 
worry about the direction of flow in your chiller coil, since if the wort is 
considered "well mixed" it 
should be the same temperature at all points.  Like I agreed with before, if 
you don't want to mix your wort, the coldest part of the coils should be at 
the bottom of the vessel to get the largest _average_ temperature difference 
across the coil.

Dear Collective: 
 
 
 
 Does anyone out there have a list of vendors of bulk (cheap) dry malt 
extract that will sell to home brewers?  I did some looking a while back, 
but I can't find my list.  I think I found some at $50.00 for 33lbs or so

Hi all, 
 
I started a brew some times ago and the fermentation doesn't seems to be 
active. 
 
Here's what I did. 
 
96/09/15: 
I boil 45 minutes 
 - 1.5 kg (3.3#) cans of hopped malt extract (Munton&Fison, Special 
                                               anniversary premium ale.) 
 - 1.5 kg of powdered malt extract (instead of sugar) 
 - 2 gallons of spring water. 
 
I add about 20g to 40g (don't remember) of goldings hop. And boil 10 
minutes more. 
 
Put all this in a primary (with a little filtering thrue a strainer), 
filling with spring water to obtain 5 gallons. 
 
Given gravity 1.045 
 
96/09/16: Put the yeast in the pail.  The yeast was expired, but I saw 
          it only after putting it in the pail... 
 
The fermentation starts, I stop worrying.  After 2-3 days, the 
fermentation stops, I restarts worrying... 
 
96/09/22: The gravity is 1.020 since a couple of days, I transfer the 
          brew to a secondary carboy and added another batch of yeast. 
          Fresh this time. 
 
After 2-3 days, the fermentation slowly restarts, but stays really slow. 
 
96/10/05: 1.020, 96/10/12: 1.017, 96/10/19: 1.014, 96/10/24: 1.014 
 
The fermentation seems complete, but if I bottle at this gravity, I'm 
afraid of possibly exploding bottles... 
 
This evening, I taste it just to know if it is lost. 
It smells like beer.  It have a fairly amber look. 
It got a little taste that I think can be attributes to the yeast or need 
to be aged. 
 
What can I do ??? 
 
Thanks in advance.

Some comments about the wort chiller test run by Dan Morley and submitted to 
HBD 
 
1 I assume Dan meant an immersion chiller, not counterflow that he tested. 
Whether the cooling water enters the top or the bottom is critical with a 
counterflow chiller, not an immersion chiller. 
 
2. A quality counterflow chiller will cool 5 gals in 8 - 10 mins and get the 
wort to within 2-5 degrees of cooling water temp using about 30 gals of 
cooling water 
 
3. A counterflow will cool each ounce of water in about 3 seconds, 
maximizing cold break, giving cleaner, clearer beer.

Subject: 3-Vessel Brewing Comparisons 


Charles Burns asks... 
 
>> Would it be possible for you to post, or send via email, a summary of what 
you've found. Those of us currently contemplating the investment would really 
appreciate it a bunch (you did a lot of hard work). <<
 
Okay, Charley, here you go: my observations thus far regarding a 
3-vessel system, the only caveats being that I obviously have not tried 
using any of these and have only some manufacturer's input and a slowly 
growing amount of user input to go on thus far. If anyone who makes 
these systems reads this and disagrees with my opinions or if any 
brewers have any experience with them first hand, feel utterly free to 
jump in and tell me where I'm wrong (or right)! 
 
The pico Brewing System: conventional/non-RIMS, 3 reconditioned kegs on 
separate stands, pump-driven (2 included), 3 thermometers. I've had 
contact with several users of this system who swear by it. Pluses: seems 
superior to many others due to simplicity of design and attractive 
price. Pump circulation an obvious choice over gravity, 3-stand 
configuration seems convenient for use and storage. I'm told the false 
bottoms fit well. Minuses: spec sheet says the thermometers are 1", 
which might be a bit small, and I've not confirmed appropriateness of 
their placement. Sparge adapter is something akin to a shower head, 
rather than a rotating wand or circular tube, not sure if that matters. 
The same 3-stand configuration that works under space constraints also 
may make recirculation less convenient than fixed system where set tubes 
run in/out of the mash tun. I wonder if this invites spillage or 
hot-side aeration. Recirculation seems an obvious requirement to clear 
the sparge or mix the grains during temp adjustments. Anyone with time 
to add any extra pipes and fittings, however, can surely overcome this 
drawback with ease. 
 
The PBS System (Precision Brewing Systems): conventional/non-RIMS, 3 
stainless-steel vessels, gravity fed, 3 thermometers. Pluses: the biggie 
is real 304 stainless brew kettles, not reconditioned kegs. Appears very 
well designed in terms of fittings and positioning; the system "fits" 
together as a unit, which may make recirculation easier (the plus) but 
also probably means setting it up in one spot and leaving it (somewhat 
of a minus, though not a huge one). Don't know how big the thermometers 
are, but they're rated accurate to 1 degree. A "spinning sparger" seems 
like a really nice touch. Minus (a biggie for me): gravity feed on the 
standard system. I hasten to point out, however, that various pumps, 
RIMS adapters, sight glasses, etc., are offered as options for this 
system and may make it about the most adaptable unit I've seen. Priced 
competitive to pico but may be a higher quality unit as-is, except for 
the gravity operation. May therefore ultimately cost more if optional 
pumps (a must in my opinion), etc. are added as options, though the 
final result would surely mean a nicely individualized system. 
 
BITOA Brewing System: conventional/non-RIMS, 3 stainless-steel vessels, 
gravity fed, 2 thermometers. Pluses: very similar to the PBS System, 
though priced slightly higher. Very well designed configuration, so long 
as you can handle 3 tiers in your basement or garage. Attractive design 
with copper sparging ring, tube to boiler extended to avoid aeration 
problems. Minuses: that ol' gravity thing again. I don't know about most 
people, but my basement ceiling is only about 6.5 feet tall and I just 
can't fit 3 15-gallon pots in there stacked on top of each other. Like 
the PBS System, BITOA also offers various options that can customize the 
unit quite nicely, though also adding cost. 
 
Penquat Brew Tree: conventional/non-RIMS, 3 kegs, gravity fed, 2 
thermometers. Pluses: These guys have really got the gravity thing 
figured out. The big feature with this system is the rack that is used 
to stack up the kegs, utilizing an actual pulley system for raising the 
mash tun to proper height! Minuses: there's no way I can fit this baby 
into my house without my fiance starting to scream! For all you outdoor 
brewmasters, however, I'm sure the Penquat will make you the envy of 
your neighbors. 
 
SABCO Brew Magic: RIMS system, 3 kegs, pump driven, 3 thermometers, 
automatic, electronic temperature control. Pluses: obviously the 
Cadillac of home or pilot brewing systems. So long as you believe in the 
viability or need for a RIMS-based system, I don't think anyone can go 
wrong with this one. Extremely well designed, permanently mounted on a 
rolling steel frame, digital readouts of mash temperature, walk-away 
automation. Who could ask for anything more? The only minus: price. Brew 
Magic runs about $3000, easily twice what any of the other systems 
(without options!) cost. Still, the sheer engineering of the thing and 
the ability to set the mash and walk away, knowing your temperatures are 
going to stay put within 1 degree, are pretty impressive commodities at 
any price. 
 
What I don't know about these systems is their true ease of operation 
and consistency, and I welcome anyone's comments (either here or in 
private email) regarding extraction rates, consistency, hot side 
aeration problems, etc. I'm sure that anyone looking for a 3-vessel 
system will not be disappointed with any of the ones I've mentioned. 
Unless there are real efficiency problems with any of them (which I 
doubt), it's really all a matter of personal preference and 
subjectivity. Personally, I am most interested in time efficiency (not 
messing around with a lot of hoses), repeatability (vis a vis making 
commercial-quality beer), and convenience (where can I set the thing 
up?). For these reasons I am probably leaning toward the pico or an 
"adapted" PBS system unless someone can convince me that the RIMS 
capabilities of the SABCO are really worth the price point. On the other 
hand, I may just buy SABCO 'cause it's so d*** pretty! 
 
Good luck to all in search of the perfect pilot plant!

Michael has carbonation problems using 1.25 cups of DME to prime. He also

1.  DME takes longer to carbonate than corn sugar. 
2.  The basement may be cooler than the previous priming environment. 
 
There may be other factors, but these two sorta popped into my mind when I 
read his post.

Reasons given were also correct with one addition - you want to drive off
