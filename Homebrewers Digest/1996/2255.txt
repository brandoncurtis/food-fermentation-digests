 *** Competition Announcement ***

Call for Judges 
 
 
 
1996 Happy Holidays Homebrew Competition 
St. Louis Brews Homebrew Club 
St. Louis, Missouri 
 
 
The St. Louis Brews are pleased to announce that our 1996  Happy Holidays 
Homebrew Competition will be held on Saturday, December 7. 
 
Our competition has been growing over the years. Last year we had close to 
300 entries. Following our competition is our awards dinner featuring some of 
the best beer and food that can be found at a homebrew gathering.   Not only 
do we brew our own beer, but we do our own cooking.  After the dinner, we 
will retire to Growler's Pub which is just a hop and a skip from the dinner 
site.  Growler's features a selection of over 130 beers. 
 
If you are competing for Midwest Homebrewer of the Year honors, our 
competition closes out the 1996 race.   If you think you have a chance to 
win, enter a lot of beers.  Tom Fitzpatrick and Al Korzonas alone accounted 
for more than 150 of our entries last year.  Well, actually it was somewhat 
less than that but these guys were both on a mission!  You too can take part. 
 
We are trying some new approaches this year, one of which is electronic 
registration for competition entries and judges.  Electronic entry forms, 
general competition information and maps are available at: 
 
   http://www.biostat.wustl.edu/~jack/hhhc96 
 
Registering your entries electonically provides an advantage for competitors 
because: 
 
 Registering electronically gets you a price break ($4 per entry instead of 
$5) 
 Registering electronically is easier than manually filling out entry forms 
 
The entry deadline for the competition is November 30th.   If you will be 
attending our 
competition, you are welcome to bring your entries with you, but you must be 
registered via the electronic entry form (or manually via the mail) by 
November 30.   There will be no exceptions.   Just remember, if we have your 
paperwork, electronically or otherwise, you are entered. 
 
We are also accepting judge registration electonically.   While the obvious 
advantage to our club is that we have enough judges, there is an advantage 
for you also.  Registering electronically allows us to ensure that you have 
overnight accomodations (Beds for Judges..not the Ritz-Carlton) and that we 
have a spot for you at our Awards Banquet which follows the competition. 
 
All entrants and judges are invited and encouraged to attend our competition 
and festivities. As mentioned earlier, all the information you need is 
available on the website listed above.  If anyone has questions or would like 
a complete announcement E-Mailed directly to them, please respond to my 
E-Mail address. 
 
Thanks and Good Brewing to You All!

When cracking grains, what sized particles should I aim for? 
e.g. Should each grain be cracked into say 4 pieces, 8 pieces, 32 .....

 from what i have read about boiling is 10% evap per hour is good. 
although you can get by with less say as low as 5% per hour. 
but all in all whatever works for you in yours.... 
 
as long as it is a rolling boil, in a kettle with no dead spots 
you should be fine.  i have some calcs from various brewhouses 
about the power required to boil but they are not on this computer.... 
but i think it was relatively low in btu like 30K to 40k btu/bbl 
or so depending on the kettle design. 
 
i once spent an afternoon at the local A/B plant, now that kettle 
rocks, the upwelling from the steam fired calandria blows wort 
up several feet above the surface. 
 
i want one of these.....:0 
 
 
great brewing

Re: Experts 
 
It has been said that people contribute to this forum without knowing 
"exactly" what they're talking about - I'm glad they do.  I'm no expert 
but if I know a little bit about a topic I'll continue to contribute 
because I have no idea if someone who knows more than I is going to 
answer the questions asked.  I think this is a great forum because we 
can help other home brewers (the salt of the earth!) and learn things 
ourselves so I would hate to see a question go unanswered.  I'm happy to 
read responses from "newbies" because "I'm a big boy now" and can make 
up my own mind as to whether I will use the info' or not. If I hear 
another response from someone who seems to know more then I can use that 
info' instead.  The "newbie" responses are usually from personal 
experience so I reckon they're as worthwhile as any other. 
 
Am I off the track here? If I am whip me, whip me (and give me salt)! 
 
I'm not trying to "flame" anybody here but really just want to encourage 
everybody to get in there and contribute.  Isn't that what "forum" 
means? 
 
Cheers,

Michael Demers in HBD 2254 asked about dry hopping with pellets. 
 
I only use pellets and always dry hop and have never used a hop bag. 
The pellets basically disintegrate and fall to the bottom of the 
fermenter.  I get good aroma and flavour and don't get much crap in the 
bottle if left to settle for a week after hopping.

Subject: Lowtech lagering and other current issues


Living in a small house (no basement), and being essentially frugal 
(but not _weirdly_ so),  for years I have practiced low tech brewing. 
 
I like lagers, but had no mechanical refrigeration (but _soon_ I will 
move to the ranks of chest freezer owners!)  So I would brew in January 
and February in cool, rainy San Jose.  My guiding principle was an 
article in an old Zymurgy called "Quick beer".  At the time, spoiled 
beer was rampant, so the suggestion was to minimize handling by 
single-stage fermentation, followed by lagering in the bottle. 
 
Here is a rough outline (please forgive the brand names): 
 
Batch size: 5 gallons 
 
Grinding - in a Glatt mill on the patio 
Mashing - step infusion in an SS pot on the stove 
Lautering - in a food-grade bucket (ex-Dunkin Donuts) with a Phil's 
            Phalse Bottom 
Boiling - in a 33qt enamel pot on two stove burners (remember to cover 
          the stove top to prevent stains!) 
Wort Chilling - with an immersion chiller, which I slosh around in 
          the pot for mixing (hopefully without aeration). One hand 
          holds a darkroom thermometer. 
Racking - with a choreboy on the end to strain out the hops, into 
          a carboy. 
Settling and more racking - the "off the trub" thang 
 
Fermenting - with a smack pack of California Common grown in 500ml of 
             dry ME wort. 
Poor man's cold fermentation - (NorCal) winter, in the corner of the spare 
          room, no heat, a carboy wearing a T-shirt, sits in a Roughneck 
          tub with 6 inches of water, with a fan blowing gently on it, 
          with blue ice (changed twice a day) in the tub water. 
          Not for the forgetful! 
 
Prime, bottle, and fill the fridge up.  Remaining bottles have to take 
their chances in the spare room. Wait four weeks (the fridge 
sits at 38-40F, the room at 50-55F) 
 
A couple of points: I have several ex-Dunkin Donuts (Ropak) buckets around 
the home winery/brewery, and even after years of use and TSP cleaning, 
they still smell like donut goo (frosting, filling, etc.)  The moral 
for me is that plastics absorb odors. So be careful where you store 
or ferment in plastic.  This is one reason I use glass. 
 
Other current topics:  I like the HBD on AOB; they do not charge me 
a cent to receive it, and servers/e-mail are not free (probably 
cost drove the HBD from HP.)  I like not having to wait three days 
for my message to appear (I think the wait was why the cancel feature 
was implemented.) And I like Al K, a pillar of the HBD from the beginning 
till now.  So many others have left (e.g. Daryl Richman, Kinney Baughman). 
Don't drive him away.

Daaaah! 
 
I sent this before and it should have been in HBD # 2253 but that one seems 
to have gone to la la land, so I will try again.  Please have patience if 
this turns out to be a duplicate post.

Hi, brewers 
 
I am in the proccess of developing a new concept in chilling my fermenters. 
 
First, a little reasoning as to why: 
 
        I own a 13 cubic foot chest freezer which I have purchased for my 
homebrewing and I am very happy with it. I have built an electronic 
temperature controller that uses the Radio Shack module. So far this is 
similar to many other setups.  The problem is that I need more than one 
temperature.  Need a low laggering temperature, another to ferment ales. So 
I was always rationing my temperatures - not a happy affair. 
 
        There are plans already to build temp controllers and chambers made 
of styrofoam insulation, ice bottles, etc, but I thought I would try a 
different approach.  It seems in life that there is more than one way to 
accomplish something (Mac..PC, SSB..AM, plastic..glass, get the idea!). 
 
Anyhow, what I am doing is to use a 10 gallon picnic cooler that I put the 
Corny pin-lock keg into (this is my SS fermenter).  Fits real nice, with 
room to add water.  So now I place my homemade immersion chiller over the 
top of the keg and into the water in the cooler.  Get it, insulated cooler, 
SS keg, and chiller.  Now I have a little inexpensive ($20.00) immersible 
pump from the fish store.  I place this into a smaller picnic cooler filled 
with water and ice, (blocks, cubes, whatever). The pump now feeds the 
immersion chiller and the outlet hose from the chiller returns to the ice 
water.  I use a temp controller just as I do for my freezer and it starts 
and stops the pump to keep the desired temperature. 
 
I have just thrown this together, and it amazed me that I already had 
everything needed.  I haven't worked with it long enough to get an idea as 
to how much ice will be needed to get me through a 24 hour period.  I am 
afraid to drill holes into my freezer, but if you had such an arrangement, I 
think you could just place a bucket of water into the freezer and use this 
instead of the ice cooler. 
 
Have fun brewers. 
 
Still playing, 
 
Ron

of trying an experiment where I dry hop two 
identical batches, one with whole hops, one with 
pellets and see if there's any noticable difference. 
Has anyone already tried such an experiment?? " 
 
I've never tried such an experiment, but have used pellets for dry hopping 
and been very pleased with the results.  I add the pellets after I have 
transferred my beer to the secondary.  I usually wait 2-3 weeks before I 
bottle.  By this time the hops have settled to the bottom along with the 
yeast.  Works fine.

Subject: 2 yeast questions


>From researching mead in the last few months I'd come to the 
conclusion that as long as one uses Champagne yeast, the dryness or 
sweetness of the mead depends mostly on how much honey one puts in; 
more honey will lead to more sweetness when the yeast finally conks 
out.  Now I have learned that Wyeast offers, in addition to Champagne 
yeast, both "dry" and "sweet" mead yeasts.  Does anyone here have any 
experience with these?  Should I just go with my original numbers (3 
lbs. honey per gallon of finished mead == relatively sweet finish) and 
use the Champagne yeast?  My girlfriend wants a sweet, Tej-like mead, 
but I don't know what Wyeast thinks is sweet or dry. 
 
Also, I've been planning on doing a nice Amber Ale followed by a 
coffee Porter, both with yeast I'd intended to start from a couple 
bottles of Wild Goose (Cambridge, Maryland, USA), but they've recently 
stopped bottle conditioning!  ;-(  Does anyone know what kind of yeast 
they were using?  I'm contemplating a road trip down there to beg them 
for a mason jar full, or something; maybe I should just use Sierra 
Nevada instead.

Subject: The State Of The Digest


Three years ago, as a new homebrewer, I became acquainted with a very 
valuable source of brewing information - the Homebrew Digest! 
 
I can say, without pause, that "It" saved me from the fate of many of my 
newly-ordained brewing peers. That fate would be a bad batch of beer. 
Because of the timely advice that I could receive, either via a posted 
response to the HBD, or direct email, I could make adjustments at various 
points of the brewing cycle. These adjustments allowed me to avoid ruining a 
batch of beer. I felt comfortable asking questions without fear of 
admonishment. I felt assured that the information would be helpful. I cannot 
honestly say, in my opinion, that the Digest is that kind of a resource 
anymore.
 
That is not to say that there are not as many knowledgeable brewers posting, 
it is simply too difficult anymore to wade through the mire of opinions and 
unrelated topics. Some of the best writers and valuable resources of amateur 
brewing information are conspicuously absent. The likes of George Fix, 
Martin Lodahl, et al, are rarely seen in this forum anymore. To me that's a 
damn shame.There are news groups for the express purpose of discussion of 
opinion. I don't believe that the HBD is that forum. 
 
I realize that I am guilty here of precisely that which I am complaining 
about, but it is only with the hope that it will somehow help the cause of 
restoring the Digest to a state of valuable brewing information. It will be 
my first and last such post! I will not respond to rebuttals via the digest, 
but will respond with personal email. 
 
Hopefully I will look back someday as the successful owner of my own brew 
pub and say without hesitation "I owe a great deal of gratitude to those 
contributors to the HBD who helped and inspired me as new brewer."

Subject: Collectibles


Hello All, 
 
While this isn't exactly a brewing question, it is near and dear to our 
hearts. A bottle of Yellow Rose 'Wildcatter's Crude Stout' recently came 
into my possession. As I think it's a collector's item, ( They were forced 
to drop the 'Crude' and rename it 'Refined' after Texas Brewing Co.- a 
contract brewer no less- challenged their use of the word.) is the value in 
the label sans contents or does it need to be remain capped? 
 
Thanks,

Subject: Modifying Refrigerators


Hello Gang.  I was wondering if anybody out there has plans/ideas for 
modifying a refrigerator so it can cool a larger area.  I have seen 
drawings of plywood extensions which increase the chilled area 100%.  I 
don't remember anything else about them, however. 
 
Point me to an FAQ if one exists.  Otherwise, please email me with your 
ideas.  I have a seven cubic foot fridge which just barely holds a carboy, 
but wanted to hae maybe two in there, if possible. 
 
Thanks in advance

Subject: re: Beer's Law


In HBD#2254, Peter Ensminger gives a nice discussion about Beer's law, 
then observes: 
 
> Interestingly, it has been claimed by George Fix, Ray Daniels and 
> others that beer (the beverage) does not obey Beer-Lambert (the law). 
> Countering this claim, several contributors to Brewing Techniques have 
> claimed that Beer does indeed obey the Beer-Lambert Law. 
 
The claims of non-Beer's law behavior I've noticed are for darker beers 
like stouts. I suspect the deviation is an artifact of the measurement 
technique. Amazingly enough, the human eye has more dynamic range in 
sensing light intensity variation than even research grade 
spectrophotometers. 
 
SRM is absorbance at a certain wavelength, multiplied by 10. An 
undiluted pale ale at SRM 12 (absorbance = 1.2) is already pushing the 
limits of *accurate* measurement on most spectrophotometers.  Stouts and 
porters can have SRM ratings of 35 or more, where no spectrometer can 
give accurate results, even though our eyes can tell such samples apart. 
 
A general rule of thumb for good UV/VIS spectrometry is to keep 
absorbance above 0.1 and below 1 (SRM 1 to 10).  The error of 
measurement is minimized in the range 0.2-0.7 absorbance units 
(Instrumental Methods of Analysis, 5th edition, Willard, Merrit & Dean; 
D van Nostrand; p93). 
 
I'm a chemist, and have done a lot of uv/vis spectroscopy.  In my 
experience, I see GROSS distortions of spectra obtained on good quality 
instruments if the absorbance exceeds 2. Spectra measured in dilute 
solution with max absorbance of about 1 show nice bands; more 
concentrated spectra have the top of the bands chopped off at around 2 
absorbance units into noisy plateaus as the detector gallantly struggles 
to get a signal out of very little light. 
 
My conclusion?  When using a spectrophotometer to quantify the color of 
very dark beers, the best way to do it is to dilute or use a short path 
length cell to bring the sample into the 0.2-0.7 absorbance range (2-7 
SRM). Estimate color, then use Beer's law to back-calculate the 
absorbance before dilution or at normal path length.  This should give 
more reproducable results, and should quantify differences between very 
dark beers that the eye can tell apart, but are too dark to be 
accurately measured on a spectrophotometer.

Subject: Possible stuck fermentation


Hello all, 
 
I brewed 15 gallons of all-grain Triple on 10/22/96.  The OG was 1.082.  I 
pitched 1/2 gallon of Westmalle yeast immediately on cooling and acheived 
high kraussen approximately 12 hours later.  I racked to secondary on 
Tuesday and the gravity was 1.048.  It appears that the fermentation has 
stopped or has slowed to the point of pain.  I have started another culture 
of the same strain.  Does anyone have any experience with this strain.  I 
read the The Great Beers of Belgian by M, Jackson that the brewery performs 
a 5 week secondary at 46 - 50 F.  Should I repitch or wait? 
 
TIA, 
 
Kenny L. 
 
ps.  I did a multi step infusion  122 F for 30 min, then raised temp to 153 
F for 90 minutes, mashed out at 167 F.  Everything went about as well as it 
could have.

I would like to hear Ms. Ewing explain the difference between "members"

really members, then  personnel issues should not be confidential, IMHO. 
If these "members" are really just corporate customers, Ms. Ewing may have 
a point.

Subject: Immersion Chiller Study results


I just read my post from the Monday HBD (2251) and realized that I stated 
"Counter Flow Chiller test" where it should have been "Immersion Chiller Test 
Results" 
 
Sorry for any confusion that this may have caused. 
 
The post should be as follows: 
 
Here are the results from cooling my wort with 1) the cold water entering 
the top coil first and 2) the cold water entering the bottom coil first. 
 
A few details first: 
 
- - -My wort chiller is 25 ft 3/8" copper coil 
- - -The coils are spaced about 1" apart 
- - -Volume of both worts at time of cooling was 24 liters 
- - -My water supply temp was 44 deg. F 
- - -The cold water supply was turned on full for the duration of both coolings. 
(this was the only way to keep the flow rate constant) 
- - -No other water in the house was running. 
- - -The lid was on during cooling. (except where chiller input/output is) 
- - -I used 2 floating thermometers. The temperatures were taken from where the 
tip of thermometers rest. (This was approximately in the middle of the wort) 
- - -I used the stop watch on my wrist watch for the timing. 
 
  TOP   BOTTOM 
  Batch 1  Batch 2 
Time  Temp.   Temp. 
 
0:00  206   206 (no stirring) 
5:00  138   138 (no stirring) 
10:00  100   102 (no stirring) 
15:00  88   84 (no stirring) 
15:00-15:30 stirred 
18:00  84   84 
20:00  80   80 
20:00-20:30 srirred 
23:00  74   74 
23:00-23:30 stirred 
26:00  68   68 
26:00-26:30 stirred 
28:00  64   64 
 
Conclusion: This is the normal way that I cool my wort. I do not stir for 
the first 15 minutes, then I stir every few minutes. Using this method it 
doesn't seem to make any difference on where the cold water flows into the 
wort chiller. I would appear that with no stirring at all, that the cold 
water entering on the bottom would have a slight advantage, (as indicated 
after 15 minutes) I have no idea how a slower flow rate (ie: less water 
usage) might effect these findings. 
 
These are just my findings, in my home brewery, under my own test conditions.

I had this problem with an ale brewed with 1056. The problem seemed to be 
caused by racking. I had two 6.75 gallon carboys fermenting at high krausen 
when I racked one to use the yeast on another batch. The unsecondaryed one 
finished in normal time, but the secondaried one stuck like a pig. My solution 
was to open ferment another batch, skim the initial krausen off and discard. 
When it rose again, I skimmed it and added it to the stuck batch. The ferment 
unstuck and finished within days. This worked well since I use 1056 for most 
of my ales and I don't mind open fermenting. Sorry this doesn't answer you 
question directly. 
 
The posts that aren't making it into the digest are making it to the undigested
readers (at least me anyway) and we are not seeing any (none) posts. I've seen 
several people re-post there non-brewing related material several times. Ack.

Subject: using aquarium heaters for lagering


Has any one used an aquarium heater for controlling lagering temperature? 
Specifically I want to use my cold room this winter (that hovers at around or 
below freezing) to lager.  I'm getting more concerned these days about 
the importance of steady temperatures for fermenting 
so I really don't want to leave the carboy in there for a month or so and 
have to take what I get with temperature. 
 
I'd use the carboy in water in garbage pail technique.  I suspect the 
thermostat on the heater only goes to 50 F or so.
