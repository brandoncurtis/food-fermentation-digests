To all those bashing the HBD these days - lighten up! 
 
Sure, I too am not happy with seeing a lot of NONE (0) postings, and it 
would appear a janitor should be there or pay more attention. Likewise, 
there are an awful lot of non-homebrew specific topics, perhaps too 
many, finding there way into the digest. 
 
But give it all a break, step back and take a fresh look. There are 
still many good questions and answers, and it is still a very valuable 
resource, especially for the newbie. Any digest is not easy to maintain, 
and we should really give the new janitor a chance (is it still Shawn?). 
 
I hope it does get better. But I'm also willing to give it a chance. I 
apologize for the bandwidth, but just had to get my $.02 into the fray.

Jim, why not pass this recirculated wort through a coil of copper tubing 
sitting
in a bucket of hot or boiling water to heat it up.  I'm sure it will work best 
if you pump it in from the bottom and use a counter- ( or anti-) clockwise 
(left hand rule) wrap.

DeNeefe says: 
 
In looking 
through various sources though, most suggest adding the extract to the 
collected wort and limiting boil to 1 hour.  Why not boil the collected 
wort for 1/2 hour, THEN add the extract and continue boiling for an 
hour?  Is there some reason not to do this that I don't see, or is it 
just a convenience thing? 
 
The reason for the boil is two-fold 1) to coagulate protein, the majority of 
which happens early in the boil and  2) the isomerization of hop alpha acids 
which take a long time. Certain of the alpha acids are not soluble in the wort 
and require the agitation of a rolling boil to get them dispersed enough to 
react with wort components and isomerize. High gravity worts reduce the ability
of hop bittering acids to be extracted, so your plan to add the extract after 
the boil with the hops is the better idea since it will improve your extraction
efficiency. Hop acids being polyphenols also react with protein and help in the
flocculation and kettle clarification.  I really don't see why it is necessary 
to boil the extract more than a few minutes.  I would boil for 45 - 60 minutes 
with the collected wort and hops and then boil with the extract for 15 minutes.

Subject: hot mash ... bottled and tasted


 
Hello HBD, 
 
About 3 weeks ago I was seeking advice on my first all-grain, about 
2 weeks ago I brewed it, and about 1 week ago I bottled it. 
 
Observations: 
1) my mash was too hot (over 165 F ... my mistake) for too long; 
2) fermentation completed EXTREMELY fast (1 day); 
3) OG 1.052, FG 1.024; 
 
I cracked a few last night and gave them to a couple friends. 
My girlfriend said it was great, "Way better than my last batch" 
(extract) but also said, "It must not have any alcohol in it because 
I had two and it didn't effect me."  (12 oz bottles) 
 
My other friend was a little more critical, but also said it was good. 
 
IMO it tasted like Hale's Ale with a tablespoon of DME stirred in it. 
WAY too sweet for me, but the taste was good.  The head on this beer 
is pretty nice too, thick and creamy. 
 
I am brewing again this week and will probably go with 170F strike-in 
at 1qt/lb in an attempt to keep the mash below 155.  I might even go 
a little lower than 170F (shooting for 150F) but I'm not sure.  I 
think I'll aim low and add hot water later if necessary.  Last time 
I aimed high (too high, and killed those little beta amylase enzymes) 
and cooled it down later, resulting in low fermentability. 
 
I have one under my belt, so the things that went wrong the first go 
around hopefully will not repeat themselves. 
 
 
Thanks everyone for your help,

Dear Brewers, 
 
I have just spent an hour reading and rereading articals in the HBD 
archives on the Fermentap.  My homebrew store has carried them for a while 
... but due to financial constraints I have put my brewing allowance into 
other things ... but I am now ready to make the plunge. The problem is that 
the jury is hung! Out of all the archives I would say that 1/2 love it 1/2 
hate it. 
 
Since most of the discussion took place in march 95 I would like to hear 
from long time users and the pros as well as the cons to this aethetically 
pleasing piece of Brewart. 
 
Like I've won on the Breeder's Cup or something I wish to blow tons of 
money on the Polar Ware Brew Pot (look for it in Zymurgy Special 96 p.7). 
Does anyone have any experience with this expencive peice of 18/8 ss.  Is 
the thermometer acurate? What is the false bottom made of? Can I heat my 
Mash on the stove if I plan on sparging in the same vessel (I'm a Gott guy 
at pressent ... and only get get friggin 25 pts.). Which reminds me that I 
also would like to know from brewers who use a similar 10 gal brew pot 
(with spigot/false bottom/ and term.) how's the extraction?

I have dry hopped with whole hops on many occasions. The one time I used 
pellets I was never able to clear the beer. It had pellet gunk

I have a fourth possibile reason, but please consider this *wild speculation*. 
If I recall correctly, Ray Daniels found the colour change when diluting beer 
(say Salvator) with water to be non-linear, whereas when diluting the 
Salvator with a lighter beer (let's say Coors), to be linear. 
 
My wildly speculative reason is:   pH.   Could pH be what's throwing off 
the colour linearity?  I know that adding lemon juice to iced tea makes 
it get quite a bit more pale...  I haven't taken the time to check if the 
non-linearity is even in the right direction, but I'm tossing this out 
for discussion. 
 
*** 
I've been trying to stay out of the chiller discussion, but I must point out 
a few things: 
 
Wade writes: 
>a counterflow heat exchanger has the hot fluid inlet and the cold 
>fluid outlet at the same end 
 
This is backwards.  For the flows to be *counter* to each other, the hot 
flow and cold flow have to be in opposite directions.  In the case of 
a tube in a hose, that means the hot inlet and cold inlet are at opposite 
ends of the tubing/hose. 
 
Look... bottom line and let's let this topic die: 
 
For there to be a difference between running the cold water in from the top 
and running it in from the bottom, you have to NOT stir the wort.  If you 
don't stir the wort, the stagnant wort next to the chiller coil will prevent 
efficient cooling and the chilling will take a long time REGARDLESS of 
which way the cold water goes into the chiller.  If you mix the wort 
gently by moving the coil, the temperature difference between the top and 
bottom will be so small, that it will be IMMATERIAL which direction the 
cold water is traveling.  Therefore, run the cold water either way and 
gently move the chiller every few minutes. 
 
If anyone wants to discuss this further, I respectfully suggest that you 
please take it to private email.  Thanks.

You know, I don't think I can agree with this statement.  Let's take a 
hypothetical situation: 
 
Assumptions: 
 1. Flow rates of water and wort are identical (in volume-per-time) 
 2. Heat capacities of water and wort are identical (close enough) 
 3. The system is perfectly insulated. 
 
Supposition: 
 4. Flow rate is adjusted so that exiting wort temperature is 
    10deg above the entering water temperature. 
 
5. The heat extracted from the wort is absorbed by the water (by 3). 
6. A parcel of water must therefore warm as much as a similar parcel of 
   wort cools (by 1, 2 & 5). 
7. The exiting water is 10deg below the entering wort temperature ( by 
   4 & 6). 
8. By a reasonable assumption of homogeneity, the water must be 10deg 
   colder than the wort along the length of the chiller. 
9. The "average" temperature difference is therefore 
 10deg * chiller length  / chiller length = 10 deg. 
 
Now, consider a "parallel-flow" chiller, built exactly like the CF 
chiller, but in which the wort and the water enter at the same end. 
 
Using the same assumptions, and the supposition: 
 4. Flow rate is adjusted so that the exiting wort temperature 
    is 10deg warmer than the exiting water temperature. 
 
5. The heat extracted from the wort is absorbed by the water (by 3). 
6. A parcel of water must therefore warm as much as a similar parcel of 
   wort cools (by 1, 2 & 5). 
7. The temperature of the wort satisfies the differential equation 
 d T(x) / dx = -2 * C * (T(x) - A) 
   where C is a constant, and A is the average temperature of the wort 
   & water.  A is constant from 6. 
   Solving the DE gives 
 T(x) = A + (T0 - A) * exp(-2 * C * x) 
   Setting T(L) = A+5, where L is the length of the chiller, gives 
 C = - ln(5 / (T0 - A)) / (2*L) 
   thus 
 T(x) = A + (T0 - A) * exp( x * ln(5/(T0-A)) / L ) 
 
8. The average temperature difference is then 
 Integral(0,L)[(T(x) - A) dx] / L = 
  [5 - (T0 - A)] / ln(5/(T0-A) 
   Note that this quantity is independent of the length of the chiller. 
 
   With some reasonable assumptions 
 T0 = 100 
 A = (100 + 20) / 2 = 60 
   the average temperature difference is 16.8. 
 
 
The reason a CF chiller can be more efficient than an immersion or 
other chiller is because it maximizes the temperature difference 
between the *entering* coolant and the *entering* wort.   This 
difference is constant over the entire chilling period.  Thus, each 
parcel of coolant absorbs the same amount of heat. 
 
For an immersion chiller, this temperature difference decreases as 
chilling progresses, so that later parcels of coolant absorb less heat 
than the earlier ones.  Therefore you must use more coolant to absorb 
the same amount of heat.

Another casualty... 
 
I have been receiving the HBD for nearly 4 years now but the time has 
come for that to end.  The signal to noise ratio has simply become too 
great.  Twice daily arrivals of it doesn't help matters either.  Is anyone 
listening at the digest command post? 
 
It used to be that at least 80% of the posts to the digest pertained to 
brewing, either improving techniques or problem solving.  I would have to 
say that that number has dwindled to half that much.  Sure, some of 
the information has become redundant over the years and I have solved many 
of the problems I encountered as a new brewer.  I have learned quite a bit 
from the digest, but it has become a waste of time.  Someone is always 
challenging someone else's post to the point of absurdity.  Let it rest or 
take it offline.  Is it any wonder why some of the well respected, 
knowledgeable brewers have terminated their daily receipt of the digest? 
 
The digest was a place where one could have a question answered by some 
of those brewers without the current attitudes of others that have recently 
dominated it.  Those days are gone.  I will have to move on to other 
sources to improve my knowlege of brewing.  The digest isn't fun to read 
anymore. 
 
Sorry, I guess I was reminiscing about the good 'ol days. 
 
 
Good brewing to all of you...

It's Samuel SMITH (no relation) of Tadcaster England, and Sam Adams of the

Adams can ever hope to brew.

In hbd #2129 (I think), Steve Alexander points out the following: 
 
>If you are using highly kilned pale malt,(pale-ale malt) it's nearly

The problem is:  what if I'm still getting chill haze with higher-kilned 
malts (eg. pale ale & Munich)?  Is there nothing that can be done to 
reduce the amount of haze-forming proteins in the mash??  Would it be 
advisable to include a certain percentage of low-kilned malt, such as 
pils, in the grist?  And if so; how much is enough? 
 
My questions are primarily slanted towards Vienna-style lager brewing. 
I can achieve the color and flavor I personally prefer in this style 
using 100% Munich malt in the grist.  However, I usually wind up with 
chill haze requiring extended cold lagering to settle out.  Anyone have 
any ideas??  Maybe it's a tannin extraction rather than protein 
problem.  Is the venerable Corona mill to blame? 
 
BTW, is it true that Ireks Munich malt is actually made by Weyermann's??

Well, first you make a really big pancake and then...... 
 
 
Or for you Mathmatically inclined: 
 
If you use 2 grams of Molasses per stack of Pancakes, a stack= 3, then 
 
# pancakes = ((total molasses)/2 grams per stack)*3 
 
Therefore:     Total # pancakes = (25000/2)*3 
 
                Total tiny pancakes = 37,500 
 
For  the Newbies: get a bunch of Eggo waffles and use as much molassess as 
you want. Pretty soon you will be more proficient and technical to go to all 
flour, egg, and milk too. So save the aforementioned formula. You just might 
need it.

Subject: Mead fermentation and yeast storage


 
Dear friends, 
I mailed a similar message a few days ago but it has not been published. 
So  here I am again. 
 
I prepared a mead almost three weeks ago (it will be three weeks next 
saturday). I used 7 kg of honey and 1 kg of strawberies and champagne 
lager yeasts in a 30 Lt carboy. It started fermenting almost immediately 
and it has been 
bubbling since then. Now, bubbling is slower but it has not stopped. I 
need to rack before autolysis starts but I do not know whether I should 
do it before bubbling stops completely. Yeasts have been in the botton of 
the carboy since the beggining but bubbling has been continuous. Do you 
believe there might be some kind of problem? do you suggest to rack now 
or should I wait until bubbling stops completely? I believe alcohol 
content should be around 13 - 14% and fermentation would take longer for 
this high level of alcohol. Do you think I am right? 
 
Another question. I need to use the yeasts again. I will take the yeast 
slurry and storage it in the refrigerator. Should I use an airlock or 
just cap the container? Should I take the slurry from the primary or from 
the secondary? 
 
I will appreciate your suggestions and comments. A similar message was 
sent some days ago but I believe it was not published.

Hi All, 
First question, Am I the only one missing 2253 or was it a digest wide 
glich? 
 
This leads to my second question that was supposed to be posted on 2253. 
Blow-offs , pros and cons, any and all info would be greatly 
appreciated. 
 
And I am sure I am not the only one to ask but what is up with all the 
[none] postings? 
 
Thanks all

Subject: Refridgerator Penetration - Door or Wall?


I've heard (not seen yet) that a lot of homebrewers who keg, end up 
putting the keg in a dedicated refer and poke a hole through the door to 
install a tap. 
 
This seems like it would be a lot of trouble with opening the door, ie 
getting hoses all over the place. 
 
I have a refer which is now dedicated to beer (what a wonderful thing). 
My idea is to keep 4 or 5 kegs in there, punch 5 holes in the WALL, one 
for C02 and 4 for taps. This way I can have a blonde, a brown, a porter 
and stout all available all the time. Right now I've just got a "T" in 
the gas line so I can handle 2, but I always have to open the refer 
door. 
 
Anyway, question is, is there a problem with going in through the side 
of the refer? Are there refrigeration lines hidden in there? And what 
kind of drill bit should I get? 
 
Always lookin for the easy way, Charley 
 
When hell freezes over, I'll ski there too.

Subject: Immersion Chiller t*st results


 
- ------- Forwarded Message 
I just read my post from the Monday HBD (2251) and realized that I stated 
"Counter Flow Chiller test" where it should have been "Immersion Chiller Test 
Results" 
 
Sorry for any confusion that this may have caused. 
 
The post should be as follows: 
 
Here are the results from cooling my wort with 1) the cold water entering 
the top coil first and 2) the cold water entering the bottom coil first. 
 
A few details first: 
 
- - - -My wort chiller is 25 ft 3/8" copper coil 
- - - -The coils are spaced about 1" apart 
- - - -Volume of both worts at time of cooling was 24 liters 
- - - -My water supply temp was 44 deg. F 
- - - -The cold water supply was turned on full for the duration of both 
coolings. 
(this was the only way to keep the flow rate constant) 
- - - -No other water in the house was running. 
- - - -The lid was on during cooling. (except where chiller input/output is) 
- - - -I used 2 floating thermometers. The temperatures were taken from where 
the 
tip of thermometers rest. (This was approximately in the middle of the wort) 
- - - -I used the stop watch on my wrist watch for the timing. 
 
  TOP   BOTTOM 
  Batch 1  Batch 2 
Time  Temp.   Temp. 
 
0:00  206   206 (no stirring) 
5:00  138   138 (no stirring) 
10:00  100   102 (no stirring) 
15:00  88   84 (no stirring) 
15:00-15:30 stirred 
18:00  84   84 
20:00  80   80 
20:00-20:30 srirred 
23:00  74   74 
23:00-23:30 stirred 
26:00  68   68 
26:00-26:30 stirred 
28:00  64   64 
 
Conclusion: This is the normal way that I cool my wort. I do not stir for 
the first 15 minutes, then I stir every few minutes. Using this method it 
doesn't seem to make any difference on where the cold water flows into the 
wort chiller. I would appear that with no stirring at all, that the cold 
water entering on the bottom would have a slight advantage, (as indicated 
after 15 minutes) I have no idea how a slower flow rate (ie: less water 
usage) might effect these findings. 
 
These are just my findings, in my home brewery, under my own test conditions.

Uh, I didn't know they bottle conditioned.  When I was there, they 
had big ol' filters they were running everything through.  Anyway, I 
think they use Ringwood yeast, which I think is what the Yeast Labs 
Australian yeast is - I could be wrong, but if so, I'm sure I'll be 
corrected!! 
 
What's the deal with Snow Goose?  I heard it went to a year-round 
beer, but I haven't seen any in GA in about a year...and a few places 
carry the other Wild Goose stuff. 
 
Tnx.

I really enjoyed my visit to John Harvards. Every beer tasted was excellent, 
especially the Porter. Very comfortable atmosphere, great bartenders.

What a coincidence. The brewmaster, Doug, studied right here at UC Davis, 
did an internship at the Rubicon, one of my favorite microbreweries in 
Sacramento. He gave me and my brother a personal guided tour of the brewery 
he is so proud of. He'd just finished his 13th batch, a wonderful English 
style pale ale. It wasn't on tap yet but we got tastes during the tour, we 
got tastes of stuff that was still fermenting!

This was the most dissapointing. It was very far out of the way, the 
bartender didn't want to be bothered with us, and it had a "yuppie" feel to 
it. Cold, not friendly enough. We had a single beer (stout) and split. 
 
>Atlanta Beer Garten, on Peachtree in Buckhead, 1/2 block south of John 
>Harvard's.  Buffalo Skull Dunkel is most promising beer. 
 
This was the first place we stopped on my first night. Hell to find a 
parking spot but its only a block away from John Harvards. The Buffalo Skull 
had been replaced by their Ocoberfest which was very malty very nice indeed. 
We walked from there to Jonh Harvards. This bar was your typical sports bar 
layout, nothing special but the brew was pretty good.

We just ran out of time in Atlanta and these are all the visits we made. Our 
favorite is definitely the Cherokee. If you go, try the ribs, excellent!

PS - we also ended up in Hilton Head South Carolina in the Hilton Head 
Brewing Company. Good Beer, GREAT waitresses. Ask for Colleen..... MMmMMmmm. 
And "The Lodge" next door has a walk in humidor, lots of microbrews and 
pooltables, with a juke box that's pretty much 70's 80's rocknroll. Great 
spot to spend an evening.

Subject: Re: Sparge necessary?


If one uses a large volume RIMS system 
in my case 4.5lt per kilo of grain is it really 
necessary to sparge? 
 
I currently do sparge but wonder if it is worth the 
trouble. 
 
Surely at the end of the mash when the recirculating 
sweet wort is raised to sparge temperature of 78C all 
the sugar that is going to go into solution is already 
in solution. 
 
Just how much sugar would be left in the grain bed 
if the wort was simply drained off without sparging? 
 
If measurable quantities of sugar are left would it not be 
less bother to just add a little extra to the grain bill 
to compensate, rather than go to the trouble of setting up 
a separate sparge heating and delivery system.? 
 
A two tier gravity driven system sure sounds more 
practical and easier to install within the height 
available in the average garage or basement brewery 
then a three tier system. 
 
 
Just thinking 
 while relaxing 
 while having the homebrew

Announcing the 
MADISON HOMEBREWERS AND TASTERS GUILD 
Eleventh Annual Big and Huge Homebrew Competition 
16 November 1996 
at J.T. Whitney's Brewpub and Eatery 
Madison, Wisconsin  (Beer Capital of the Midwest) 
 
For those of you who need a reminder, this is our "This, That, and the Other 
Thing" competition of our two annual competitions (the other one is the Big 
and Huge in May).  The November Classic categories give the entrant the 
opportunity to compete with beers of a wide range of styles, much like a 
"best-of-show" situation, and the top beers from those categories go on to the 
real BOS for additional recognition and prizes.  Once again, we expect to be 
able to offer a variety of brewing supplies as prizes (as well as the 
ribbons). 
 
In addition to the regular categories, the November Classic features a chance 
to brew a brewpub scale batch of the winning beer in a special holiday beer 
category.  This is the second time the MHTG is doing a "brewer's dream" 
category.  Last year, Bob Paolino brought the full meaning of hops to the 
Great Dane's customers.  This year, YOU could have your own creation served to 
the public at J.T. Whitney's (one of Madison's three brewpubs).  There are no 
special guidelines for the J.T. Whitney's Holiday Challenge portion of the 
competition other than that the winner will be the designated "holiday" beer 
to be served during the winter months.  Spices, fruit, or other special 
ingredients are possibilities _but are by no means required or expected_.  Use 
your imagination, creativity, and brewing skills for your own holiday 
creation.  The holiday entries will be judged by last year's winner and by 
Rich Becker (J.T. Whitney's brewmaster). 
 
Speaking of judges, this announcement also serves as a CALL TO JUDGES.  Come 
visit us in Madison for a day of judging a wide range of beers and for the 
opportunity to enjoy the many high quality local beers in south-central 
Wisconsin. 
 
For entry information or to state your intention to judge, write to Bob 
Paolino (NGHAB`at`juno.com) or this year's organiser, Bruce Garner 
(bpgarner`at`mailbag.com) and we'll send the information to you by email or usps. 
 
We look forward to receiving your entries! 
 
 
Now go have a beer,

Subject: Longer Ferments With Honey


I'm still experimenting with my Florida Sunshine Ale and just raised the 
amount of orange blossom honey from 1 to 2 lbs.  It appears to be still 
slowly fermenting after two weeks, normally it's done after about 10 days. 
I used around 9lbs of grain in a 5 gal batch with this ale.  What concerns 
me is the batches I've had that have gone bad where ones that continued 
slow fermentation over several weeks.  Is it normal for 2lbs of Honey to 
take longer to ferment out?
