Subject: Film in carboy


I am a new brewer.  I aquired a carboy that had once been used for a 
terrarium.  I noticed a thin white "cloud like" film on portions of the 
bottem and faintly on the side in one area.  I attempted to clean it using 
first, limeaway and then muriatic acid.  Neither seemed to touch it.  Since 
it was only a faint "film" I decided to go ahead and brew with it anyway. 
After all, I reasoned, either it was something etched into the glass or, if 
the substances I tryed couldn't touch it, how could a little wort pick up 
anything from it? 
 
Now, after my first 2 batches, the film is much more pronounced.  Looks like 
white--very white, not a film-- powder on the same areas of the bottom.  On 
the sides, the light wisps have also turned into white "powder".  I tryed 
scraping; that didn't work.  Then I tryed the muriatic acid again; never 
touched it. 
 
 
Any ideas what this could be and how to get rid of it? 
 
Thanks in advance.

I've not made this particular brew, but I've made two similar ones, based 
on Papazian's "Holiday Cheer" recipe in NCJHB.  You should be concerned 
over the amount of aging. The amount of ginger in the beer will probably 
overwhelm everything else. I'd cut back quite a bit. 
 
I found that the taste mellowed quite a bit as time went on. At first (3 
weeks after bottling), the ginger was harsh and astringent. After a month 
of cold conditioning in a fridge, it was much, much better. After about 3 
months, it was very good. I'd cut back on the ginger and make it this 
weekend.

Wayne, 
I use a 3-pronged approach to CF Chiller sanitation, which is likely 
overkill.  Since you can't see in there, I want to make really sure that 
it's clean *and* sanitized.  Before use:  1) run a solution of B-Brite 
(actually Electrosol DW detergent) through it, 2) rinse with boiling water, 
and 3) sanitize with Iodophor.  After this, I'm pretty confident that I 
don't have any nasties in there.  After use, I follow the same process, 
sometimes omitting the Iodophor.  Like all brewing equipment, it's easier to 
sanitize later if you make sure to clean it right after you use it.

Dave Burley suggests:

tubing 
:sitting in a bucket of hot or boiling water to heat it up.  I'm sure it 
:will work best if you pump it in from the bottom and use a counter- ( 
or :anti-) clockwise (left hand rule) wrap. 
 
This is one of the best suggestions i've seen in a while. I've got the 
same setup and am having a hard time holding temp. I'm gonna try this, 
but, I can't resist this question for Dave: 
 
Why recirculate counter clockwise? What the heck does the direction of 
flow matter when all we're doing is transferring heat? I understand the 
need to enter at the bottom, makes a lot of sense. BTW, if we live south 
of the equator, are you recommending we do it clockwise;-)?

first posted to #2253, now lost in space: 
 
The recent yeast thread, started by JSchmidling, about pitching on top of 
other yeast: 
A couple of questions....is there any taste difference to these fast 
ferments?   Do you chill your wort down real low (say, 5 degrees C or so) 
prior to pitching? Does the increased fermentation activity generate 
additional heat in the beer?  I'm gonna try this with a porter this weekend, 
using Wyeast London yeast in the secondary now fermenting a lighter ale. 
____ 
For those interested, the Aussie recirculation system (which I think is 
really groovy) is similar to vertical circulation wells used to extract 
volatile chemicals from ground water.  I found a paper on flow regarding 
these wells, with integrals, differential equations, and everything, 
describing flow within these kinds of systems.  It was written  by Philip 
and Walter, in the Sept.-Oct. 1992 issue of Ground Water, v. 30, no. 5. 
  The solution to the flow problem seems relevant to model wort flow in this 
system. 
____ 
My personal pledge: 
I'll attempt to engage in no more obnoxious authoritarian BS as long as I 
can.  I promise that I'll engage in no personal attacks, unless of course my 
mother in law begins posting to this forum.  I'll forgive and forget, and 
extract only those gems of information which are supported by data.  I'll 
ignore those which are not supported by data, and those which I don't 
understand.  I'll relax, brew in plastic if I want, and know that most of my 
brewing technique is lousy enough that effects of minutae at this time will 
not measurably negatively impact my beer.  Hopefully, someday, they will. 
   I'll also probably try out every neato idea I read, and proceed on my own 
to make better beer.  I won't bitch about the AHA, HSA, Wyeast, or RIMS. 
I'll laugh at babcock's jokes.    I'll not waste bandwith any more.  And I 
will type with a happy heart and hope for my fellow brewers.

Subject: Re: Refridgerator Penetration - Door or Wall?


 
Charley, 
 
Most refridgerators don't have coils in the sides. The SAFEST thing to do 
is to call the service department of the manufacturer and ask them. Thats 
what I did it only takes 5 minutes. 
 
My taps are on the front door. I might have put them on the side if I had 
better access to the side of the frig. I have long hoses because I use a 
"beer mix", part nitrogen part CO2 in the same tank, and if I don't hold the 
kegs at a higher pressure they aren't carbonated enough. 
 
Some other things to keep in mind. 
 
 - Look at using quick disconnects for the CO2 line. This comes in 
   real handy when you want to snap on a diff. attachment. At the very 
   least, make sure all of your connections are screw not hose barb. 
 
 - Instead of using a "T", they sell a "Y" connector which you can 
   attach 2 check valves on the output. I use a "T" and when 2 kegs 
   are attached, both FULL, and I release pressure in 1 of them, beer 
   can come up the CO2 line from the other keg as it tries to 
   equalize. I know, just disconnect the CO2 line, but I'm lazy and 
   only do this when I first tap a keg to drop the pressure after force 
   carbonation.  Better yet get a second single regulator and you 
   can daisy chain them together, having 2 kegs at diff pressures. ($$$) 
 
 - With that many taps I'd look at the multiple taps from a single 
   shank configuration. It will cut down on the number of holes you 
   need to cut. 
 
 - I went to a fire extinguisher store and bought a bracket for my 5 lb 
   tank. I mounted my CO2 tank on the side of the frig so that the tank 
valve is just below the top of the frig. I drilled a hole in the side, put a 
rubber grommet on both the inside edge and outside edge of the
   hole and pulled my line through it. 
 
For parts look at Rapids or Fox. Just my 2 cents. 
 
Good luck !!!!

Subject: Modifying Refrigerators / Munich Malt with Pale Malt -- Low Temp Rest?


Lotsa talk these days about modifying refrigerators to hold more carboys or 
kegs or whatever.  Here's a simple mod that might be enough for you, without 
resorting to adding extension collars and the like. 
 
Most fridges I've seen (including the one I modified for my keg service) have 
a vacuum-formed plastic sheet for the inside of the door.  Various shelves 
and cubby-holes are molded in.  If you peel back the door gasket a bit, 
you'll see a bunch of screws around the door's perimeter.  The screws clamp 
the molded shelf sheet against the door, while holding the gasket in place. 
 
Remove all the screws and take off the plastic panel and gasket.  Lay it over 
a 1/8" sheet of Masonite, plywood, acrylic, whatever you like.  Using the 
door shelf panel as a template, mark the outline and the screw hole 
locations.  Cut out the masonite panel along the outline and drill out the 
screw holes.  Assemble along with the gasket to the fridge door.  You now 
have picked up at least 6" of depth front-to-back inside the fridge. 
 
This was adequate in my case to put *four* cornies in a small apartment-sized 
fridge while still retaining one shelf for miscellaneous stuff.  Idon't know 
the exact cf rating {does it include the freezer?} but the fridge part is 
about 4' high by 20" wide by 18" deep.  This also provides a clean flat 
surface so you can mount faucet taps on the door.  I also mounted some 
plastic trays to the door, serving as shelves/tubs, to hold yeast slants and 
other incidentals.  The two cornies in the rear sit up on the "hump" housing 
the compressor stuff.  If your "hump" is not flat, you might have to rig up 
some sort of shelf arrangement but that should be simple enough. 
 
Another question (Charley Burns) was where to drill faucet/tubing holes and 
how.  Look inside your fridge & freezer.  If you see a flat metal panel 
hanging on the backside of the inside of your fridge, chances are that the 
refrigerant circuit is in this panel and not in coils in the walls, so it 
should be safe to drill wherever you like.  If you don't see such a panel, 
then chances are the refrigerant is inside the walls, so the door would be 
the only safe place to drill. 
 
I used a 1" (I think) hole saw.  A twist drill this size would be expensive 
and hard to use.  Those flat hole drill blades for wood _will_not_work_ if 
the fridge "skin" is metal (check my trash can for proof!).  And as for the 
hoses getting in the way, you can try running them along the door panel in a 
bundle to the hinged side of the door, where you lash them together with 
string or wire or a cable tie.  A small screw-eye in the door panel can serve 
to anchor the lash (see how nice this panel replacement is?).  Once you 
arrange them like this they should stay out of your way. 
 
Finally, a suggestion I've made before (but never done myself) concerns chest 
freezers.  Cooling coils are almost always in the walls of these things, so 
people either mount tower faucets through the top or build a wooden "collar" 
along the top edge, removing & remounting the lid to it, and drilling holes 
for door faucets in the wood.  This requires disassembly of the lid and some 
body & fender work on the freezer.  My suggestion (has anyone tried it yet?) 
was to instead build a *wedge* frame of wood which simply slips under the lid 
(which is still attached to the freezer).  A strip of 1/2" or 3/4" plywood 
maybe 4" - 6" "tall" running the width of the freezer serves as the front of 
the wedge; this is drilled to accomodate taps.  The sides are plywood 
triangles tapering from the same height as the panel up front to a point in 
the rear.  Some weatherstripping, a chunk of insulation, or a narrow strip of 
wood along the back edge should seal any gap there, and weatherstripping 
along all the edges of the plywood will seal against the freezer sides and 
the lid.  And your warranty is still good.

Russ Brodeur asks about low-temp rests when using munich etc malts: 
 
"Would it be 
advisable to include a certain percentage of low-kilned malt, such as 
pils, in the grist?  And if so; how much is enough? " 
 
Russ, I've made an "OktoberAle" a couple of times, using pale ale malt (70%) 
and munich (30%) [these %'s neglect the tad of wheat malt tossed in for good 
measure].  In both cases, especially in the latest, the beer was 
crystal-clear; in fact, it's the most brilliant beer I've made yet.  So if 
that's any indication, you'll have to look elsewhere for your haze problems.

Brewsters: 
 
 Marshall Muller asks: 
 
> When cracking grains, what sized particles should I aim for? 
> e.g. Should each grain be cracked into say 4 pieces, 8 pieces, 32 ..... 
 
Books say something like three to six pieces, but you and other HBDers may 
interested in a method I developed using a small adjustable mill. It provides a
superior product in that the husks remain whole and the malt is crushed to 
small
( say 2 - 3 mm) particles without a lot of flour.  The basic procedure is to 
mill the grain twice.  Sounds like it would take twice as long, but it is 
actually substantially shorter than a single milling to give a product of 
similar particle size. Basically, I do what the big boys do with their 6 roller
mills - mill the grain more than once, except I have the equivalent of a 4 
roller mill when I do it my way. 
 
Here's how I do it.  Close the mill nip down,start the motor (I use my 
drillmotor) open the nip until it is apparent the mill is operating efficiently
and grains are going through.  I have measured this nip with a spark plug 
gapping guage and find it varies between 0.07 and 0.08 in.( approx 2 mm)  for 
most malts.  I can mill 10# (4.5 kg) of malt in a few ( say 3 -5 ) minutes. 
This provides cracked malt grains, many still inside the husk and whole husks. 
 
I then reset the gap to 0.055 to 0.06 in.( aprox 1.5 mm) and remill, again 
taking about 5 - 10 min or so. This will give me extremely high efficiencies of
conversion and a smooth sparge, since I have whole barley husks, a uniform and 
small particle size and almost no flour. 
 
I did an experiment in which I used different size nips and got OGs of 
1.035,1.045, 1.060 and 1.064 for the same grist, depending on the settings. Now
with this double mill procedure my  efficiencies are in the 90's. So don't let 
anyone tell you that the mill isn't important in providing a good brew session.
 
I don't want to start the old mill thread all over again, but this ability to 
multiply mill the same grain at different settings speaks in favor of the 
adjustable mill.

I'm not able to confirm or deny the effect of pH; I just have another "wild 
speculation".  How about the effect of alcohol in the solution.  You know 
when you add 50 ml of alcohol to 50 ml of water, you get something less than 
100 ml of liquid.  This is because the smaller water molecules can fit 
between the larger alcohol molecules.  Like a half bucket of sand poured 
into a half bucket of pebbles. 
 
What if this makes a difference in the optical qualities?  Adding water to 
beer would change the alcohol/water ratio more than adding beer to beer.  If 
this is the source of the difference, then you should be able to repeat the 
effect by using a solution of alcohol and water that was the same %ABV as 
the original sample.  In fact, it would be even more accurate, since you 
would not be adding even that little bit of color that Coors has. 
 
What ya think, Al?  Could it be a little of both, mebbe?  I certainly don't 
know.

The door is the safest place to install taps. You don't know where the coolent 
and electrical lines run in the walls.  Also, once you get the fridge stocked 
you only need to open the door when you replace a keg. 
 
I use a hole saw to drill my holes, it takes about 10 seconds to go thru the 
plastic, insulation and metal. Sears seems to have the best supply.  Just take 
your tap in and buy one that is slightly larger than the part that goes thru 
the door.

Phil, I hate to be a downer but any and all spiced ales I have brewed (1) or 
tasted (many) were always pretty rough around the edges for the first few 
months of conditioning.  This recipe may be different and I admit that I've 
never brewed it, but I wouldn't hold out a lot of hope, even if you brewed 
it right now. 
 
Other opinions may differ.  Good luck with it, whatever you do.

No, Wade has it right, the hot inlet and the cold *outlet* are at the same 
end, therefore the flow is counterflow. 
 
Al should have read Wade more carefully, though his lengthy response is 
also correct.

This is NOT backwards. Al, If you had read it, you would see that it 
says the hot fluid INlet and cold fluid OUTlet are at the same end. If 
you want to have the final word on something, please make sure you 
understand what someone has posted. Don't say they are wrong and correct

Hi Jorge, 
 
I do this a lot and pour the slurry from my primary through a sanitized 
funnel into a sanitized bottle and cap it.  I have store this in the refrig 
for up to a year.  SLOWLY open the cap while still cold to bleed off any 
pressure that may have built up.  Then I make a starter for a new batch from 
this slurry.  An airlock may let unwanted organisms into your slurry, as it 
cools down the gas contracts and the airlock contents will suck into the 
slurry.
 
good luck

I believe that this is a clear indication that it's time to get a new 
wife.  My fiance encourages me to brew whenever I can, because she really 
likes the dark, chewy, powerful stuff I make.  Now that I think about it, 
she's the only chick I know who prefers dark beers to light ones.  As an 
added bonus, brewing counts as housework in her mind -- not the loafing 
when the boil is going, only the real work. 
 
I suggest hanging out at your local brewpub, and hitting on the chicks 
that order dark beers.  They'll appreciate your brew.

Hi, all... 
 
In my ignorance, I have dry hopped into my primary fermenter. 
I've since discovered that this was a *bad* thing to do (Charlie 
P. says to absolutely avoid doing this). 
 
So, is it worth saving? It doesn't smell all that great, but 
it is still undergoing rather active fermentation. I've got 
half a mind to dump it and use the carboy to ferment a stout 
recipe I've got waiting in the wings. 
 
So what do you all think?

Jorge Blasig questions on mead...

The bubbling means the yeast is healthy. After 3 weeks... I would rack it now.

No, this is a good thing. 
 
>> I believe alcohol

You are right.  You have the technology to control the alcohol!  Typically 
I will check the gravity often and I will have a goal in mind.  Sometimes 
the yeast is ~really~ healthy and will ferment your mead into something 
very dry.  Other times the yeast is very ~weak~ and will die out 
leaving you with something sweet.  If it is too healthy kill it off (cold 
temperatures are good for that), too weak - induce a healthier culture. 
Dry to me is when the gravity drops below 1.0, sweet to me is above 1.015. 
(I like 'em dry and bubbly).  For the secondary sometimes I put the carboy 
in a dark, lonely corner in the basement and forget about it for a year. 
That's drastic but the key is patience for meads.  The lonely part makes it 
lively when it gets to play on your pallet :-) 
 
>> Another question. I need to use the yeasts again. I will take the yeast

Airlock, don't pressurize the yeast you may get a mess. 
 
>> Should I take the slurry from the primary or from 
>> the secondary? 
Primary will have the healthiest cultures. 
 
The *thing* about meads is that the yeast gets so stressed due to the 
high alchohol tward the end of fermentation it starts to drown in 
it. Racking will get rid of the old dead cells, revitalize the new cells and 
reduce your chances of autolysis.  There is a fine line between the 
two (removing the yeast v/s leaving the mead on the dead yeast cells too 
long) but (IMHO) three weeks and a low bubbling is a good time to rack. 
 
        Good luck, hope this helps, Jeanne.
