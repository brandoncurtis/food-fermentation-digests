Speaking of BT, in HBD 1691, Jeff Wolf asks about Zima, and what it is. In 
the last issue of BT (Jan/Feb ?) someome (sorry do not remember who, and do 
not have the mag here in my office) did a bit of research and a nice write-up 
on the 'Zima process'. It was very interesting, although the comical 
replacement of all occurrances of the letter 's' with the letter 'z' gave 
me a headache halfway through the article. And it was not even that long 
of an article !

Subject: RE:Keg sediment  


Hi all! 
 
  In HBD Mike Donald asks about transporting a corny keg and sediment, 
  I have done this several times and in general have not had much of 
  a problem with stirring up the sediment (of course I didn't drive down 
  any really rough roads, all city driving no gravel roads).  If you are 
  really concerned I would suggest transfering your beer to another keg 
  following these simple steps: 
 
  1.) Clean receiving keg and purge with co2, fill to the same pressure 
      as your source keg. 
 
  2.) If possible refrigerate both kegs, the cooler the better. 
 
  3.) Connect the beer-out from the source keg to the beer-out of the 
      receiving keg (make sure the pressures are equal). 
 
  4.) At this point no beer should flow, bleed off a little pressure 
      from the receiving keg and some beer will flow until the pressure 
      equalizes, repeat this until the beer is transfered ! 
 
  Since the receiving keg is cold and filled with co2 you should have no 
  oxidation issue and if your receiving keg has a pressure relief valve 
  in its lid it is a simple task.  I have done this a couple of times to 
  transfer a couple of gallons to my one 2.5 gallon corny keg with great 
  results. 
 
Good luck.

Subject: Immersion Chiller construction


 
William D Gladden <W_GLADDEN`at`Mail.Co.Chester.PA.US> 
asked: 
"During a recent trip to the local home supply superstore, I 
noticed what I believe to be copper pipe/tube/whatever ... 
already formed into a coil in a box labeled as being made for 
hooking up automatic ice cube makers to a freezer.  It comes in 
3/8 inch and 1/2 inch diameters and up to around 20 or 25 feet in 
length.  It seemed as though it would bend easily and even snap 
pretty easily *if* you bent it back and forth repeatedly.  Since 
I don't plan to do that to an immersion chiller, I thought it may 
be just what I need.  Has anyone made an immersion chiller with 
this stuff?  If so ... any advice?  If not ... why not?  I think 
even I could make one if this stuff will work!  Thanks. "" 
 
Yes, I made one with 25 feet of 3/8 inch diameter, precoiled soft copper 
tubing. I suppose you could use 1/2 inch, but the thermodynamicist threads 
sorta suggested to me that 1/2 inch was too big, 1/4 inch was too oo oo 
small, and 3/8 was just right.  I grabbed the box of this material, then 
nabbed one of those guys in the yellow vests, and announced, "Hey bud, I 
need to hook this pipe up to my hose!".  He recommended surgery, but soon 
agreed to supply compression fittings for each end which went from 3/8 inch 
to a standard female hose fitting.  I also got some teflon tape for the 
threads.  You can make one, it will work.  I paid a grand total of (I think) 
20 bucks for mine, including a roll of solid copper wire and some solder so 
I could make it stand up real good in the brewpot, but that may not have 
been necessary.  Go for it, in 20 minutes you could have a wort chiller 
which I personally guarantee to last at least 3 years, minimum.  It works.

Howdy All, 
 
My first post of this was turned into a  "[none] ()" 
 
Jorge asked about saving a slurry from Strawberry mead.  If he added the 
berries in to the primary won't the yeast be mixed with the berrys.  Would 
the slurry be of any use with the berries in it?

Subject: 3-Vessel Systems Update


Thought I'd post an update to my previous notes regarding the 
comparative merits of some of the 3-vessel brewing systems out there. 
 
Since my post, I've had additional contact with both PBS and the 
designer of the Penquat Brew Tree. PBS was quick to point out to me that 
"99%" of their systems are sold as custom units, with the inclusion of 
various options to suit the user's needs, and that some 90% of them are 
also sold with the appropriate pumps necessary to facilitate use as a 
closed pump, single-level system. In addition, they point out that all 
fittings utilize flexible hose so that the movability of the system is 
maintained. 
 
The Penquat designer has also informed me that he's working on a 2-tier 
system in which the lifting fixture is used to raise and lower the 
boiling kettle instead of the mash tun/sparger, in order to save on 
height requirements, and may also be able to custom design a gravity 
flow system based on user needs. (Though I still think that if you've 
got the space, the "tower effect" of the Brew Tree is pretty darn 
impressive!) 
 
In any case, I guess the moral of the story is that we're not dealing 
with IBM or Chrysler here. The manufacturers of these systems seem 
pretty willing to work on design features to suit individual brewer's 
needs, so I urge all of you out there who don't own a welder yourselves 
and who are thinking about making the move to go ahead and talk to some 
of them and DO IT. 
 
Happy brewing all,

Ya know what usually strikes me as extremely funny about thes 'farewell' 
posts? Usually they have some comment about signal-to-noise or non-beer 
related posts. I usually just look at these posts and think "Gee, good to 
see you're not being hypocritical or anything like that." I find the long 
rambling farewells usually fit this case best. 
 
If you absolutely *have* to post a farewell, try something like: 
 
Ye Gods! This is just too much for me! I've had it with X. Catch ya'll later. 
 
Short, simple, and to the point. It also helps cut down on the s/n ratio. 
(Which I will probably still find hilariously funny if X=s/n ratio) 
 
*** 
 
Okay, to keep the s/n ratio down, here are some things that I have tried to 
post but have been munched by majordomo. 
 
*** 
Yeast Ranching: 
 
I've a steady supply of 10ml bottles w/ screwtops. My supplier gets them 
from the hospital she works at and they used to be blood typing reagent 
bottles. Will they be safe to use for ranching those little buggers? 
 
*** 
Regulators: 
 
While perusing Builder's Square's tool dept(insert approriate Tim Allen 
noises here), I saw a single line air regulator for ~$40. This was to be used 
on a compressed air system, but I was wondering if it would work with a CO2 
system?

The locals we spoke to told us that the beer at John Harvard's was not too 
good, so we skipped this place in favor of the rest on the tour.  We did go 
to an Irish Pub (Fado Fado, I think was the name) close to Harvard's for a

We got a tour, also.  They just started selling their beers again after a 
lapse due to some BATF licensing snafu.  Nice beers, but a little out of 
style.  Not a major offense, but I like truth in advertising.

The place definitely says "yuppy" - don't think it would ever rate as a 
regular hang-out for me.    We didn't eat but spent our time there in the 
bar.  My opinion of the beer was that it is very good - a wonderful hefe 
Weizen, some very good ales (though they screamed of diacetyl).  Bar staff 
didn't know anything about beer, unfortunately, but the female bartender's 
looks made up for that......  I guess "out of the way" depends on where 
you're going.

Actually, this is where the PSBO was held.  I had plenty of home brew there, 
but only one of the house beers.  The Buffalo Skull Dunkel was a nice beer 
but kind of heavy on the hops (not noble hops either, I think) for a Munich 
Dunkel.  A companion who lived in Munich shared my opinion.

Subject: Lagering


 
 
Greetings to the collective, 
 
   I've been reading the posts about modifying fridges and chest freezers for 
use in lagering beer.  I just wanted to add a novel approach that I tried 
last year about this same time.  I brewed an Oktoberfest using this technique 
and won third place in the German Amber Lager catagory at the Green Mountian 
Mashers competition in Burlington, VT.  This idea may not work for you if the 
outside temperature is not cold enough, but up here in the Green Mountian 
state of Vermont this procedure can be used as early as October. 
   I built a box using 2x4's and some 1/4" plywood.  The box was not insulated 
but can easily be insulated with the blue foam board insulation that is 
commonly
used on the exterior of houses before siding is applied.  I have seen this 
insulation in sizes from 1/2 - 2". At the top of the box I mounted a reflector 
light fixture.  I also mounted a temperature sensor on the side approximately 
half way down the side of the box (I used a K-type thermocouple).  The sensor 
and power for the light were hooked up to a temperature controller (I used an 
old controller from work but there are may various types on the market).  The 
idea is to have the light turn on when the temperature drops below the setpoint
and warm the inside of the box.  This is kind of the reverse of a fridge or 
freezer.  It is a cheap way to take advantage of Mother Nature.  Place the box 
in a protected area and make certian to keep all electrical connections  dry 
and protected from the elements (I was able to locate the box next to a window 
and all of my connections were inside my basement). 
   I used this method because I didn't have a fridge at the time and my 
basement is finished so I didn't have an area inside that got cold enough. 
Another good place to set up this type of arrangement would be in an unheated 
garage or utility shed.  I will need to use this arrangement again this fall/ 
winter because the fridge that I got this summer is dedicated to the storage 
and dispensing of my finished product.  Even if you have a basement that gets 
cold enough this would be a good idea as it will provide better temperature 
stability.

Why transfer beer from one keg to another to leave behind sediment? 
Simply tap a glass or two off it before you move it. This will 
give you a glass of sediment and a glass of beer. Drink the beer.

Subject: cracking malt


Dave Burley recently described how he double mills his malt for increased 
efficiency.  I second that notion. 
 
i was getting fairly good efficiencies but had arrived at a point where 
nothing else could be improved within my budget and time constraints.  Then 
one morning while cracking some grain i looked into the pile of cracked 
grain and noticed some of the grains unscathed or only very slightly 
cracked.  i put the grain through the mill a second time at the next lowest 
roller gap setting.  The grain appeared to be much more uniformly crushed 
and i topped 31pppg that day for the first time.  Now, honestly, it may not 
have been just the crush:  since i double crushed the malt i got nervous 
about tannins and sparged conservatively after recirculating much wort. 
But now i always double crush my malt like this and my efficiencies have 
indeed increased because of it.  BTW, i tried to save time and crush the 
malt just once on the smaller setting and i made malt flour;  everything 
was totally pulverized and the husks were practically non-existant.  The 
double crush is definitely worth the time.  The two gap settings are 
approx.  1.8 mm and 1.5 mm on the Valley Mill.

Subject: Construction of Immersion C


William D Gladden asks about using the refrigerator tubing he saw as material 
for building an immersion chiller.  I did just that.  Bend it around a paint 
can to get the correct coil dia. 
Straighten the two ends and bend them so the connections for your inlet and 
outlet hoses won't be above your wort when they leak.  Slide tubing over the 
ends (same dia as used for siphoning) use hose clamps, get an adapter for your 
water source (e.g., garden hose). Done. I have used this for all 25 all grain 
batches that I have made and the only problem that I experienced was the first 
batch because I didn't use hose clamps and the tubing slipped off of the coil 
and sprayed  all over my wife's kitchen I didn't know that she knew those 
words! 
Feel free to email me for more details.

Subject: Dry Hopping technique


I add pellet hops to the secondary when transferring to the primary and 
then gently swirl the secondary every day until bottling.  I get more of 
a hop aroma in the beer using this technique. 
 
Question:  Am I taking unnecessary risks with oxidation or contamination 
by swirling the secondary daily? 
 
Question: Do you whole dry-hoppers let them float or do you suspend them 
with a weight?  If you are a floater, does the hops provide much aroma? 
 
Lastly to Guy Gregory's Personal Pledge of civility in Digest #2257.. 
Amen!  I couldn't agree more.

Subject: RE:  Counterflow chiller sterilizing/sanitizing


     Hi all! 
 
     I believe that my method for sanitizing my C-F chiller is the easiest 
     and most efficient.  Some will argue that it seems risky (in a 
     microbial sense), but I've not had a problem yet. 
 
     I flush it thoroughly with hot water after each use and store it open. 
     Before use, I flush it with hot tap water (in case anything has taken 
     up residence inside it).  I then hook it up to my boiling kettle.  At 
     the end of the boil I whirlpool the wort, let it settle 5-10 minutes, 
     then open the spigot *without* turning on the cooling water. 
 
     I collect at least a 6-pack worth of the piping hot wort into 12 ounce 
     (355 mL) beer bottles and cap them (the bottles are clean and 
     pre-warmed). 
 
     I then turn off the flow, turn on the cooling water, and start 
     collecting cool wort into the fermenter. 
 
     The bottled wort serves as yeast culturing material or Kraeusening 
     wort.  I always mark the first bottle, because if there is a 
     sanitation problem it will most likely show up there (because the 
     first runnings lose some heat to the chiller even though there is no 
     coolant in it).  I haven't had a problem yet (except for a friend 
     opening a bottle of sterile wort, thinking it was beer.  I guess you 
     could make malta this way!). 
 
     Have fun!

What is your experience culturing the Rogue Ale PacMan yeast from the

Subject: RE: No-Sparge HBD 2258


In HBD 2258, Charles Burns asked for the report on the no-sparge 
technique that someone (perhaps a none[0]) had earlier posted. Charles 
also asked if there are other benefits to no-sparge. 
 
Perhaps it was my post you saw but just 2 weeks ago. I bottled my first 
no-sparge batch (an Oatmeal Stout) a week ago Wednesday. Since it is 
only 1.5 weeks old, I won't be trying it until at least another week. 
 
I can tell you that it cut about 1 hour off my time, and was as 
convenient as extract brewing once you drained the mash. I didn't take 
any sg readings, but it fermented well, and appeared as normal as any 
stout in color and taste (before bottling). I will note that the beer 
appeared quite clear (not cloudy) when transferring from fermenter to 
bottling bucket. 
 
There is an article by Dr. George Fix in the rollanet library. 
Purportedly, no sparge brew tends to have less tannins and is maltier. 
Time, for me, will tell.

Subject: No-Sparge Brewing -- How Much Sugar is Left Behind?


Charles Burns says: 
 
"In any case, your question about "how much sugar is still left" after 
draining the grain bed is a good one." 
 
I've addressed this point before, but it's a worthwhile technique to pursue 
so I'll regurgitate my spin on the topic.  Prepare yourself for my usual 
long-windedness. 
 
Before I get to the specifics I'd like to say that the no-sparge techniques 
is an excellent way to make the jump from extract to all-grain brewing with 
minimal investment in equipment & space.  It also saves a bit of time over a 
full-sparge technique for "regular" all-grain brewers. 
 
There are two ways to not sparge (does that make sense?).  The important 
thing to remember is that in both cases you'll be collecting *a smaller 
amount of concentrated wort* (higher gravity and less of it than your target 
recipe volume), since there's no rinse-water to thin it out and make up the 
volume.  In one approach, you'll add water to the runoff and do a full-volume 
boil.  This of course requires a large brewpot; not a problem for 
well-equipped all-grainers.  The other approach is to collect conentrated 
wort and brew as if it were and extract brew.  This is the part that makes it 
so simple for extract brewers to all-grain brew without getting too fancy.  I 
made about four batches of beer using this technique before building my 
Plastic Electric Brewery (which, for those of you who have been following 
along, is still working marvelously; see my web page for details). 
 
There are a couple ways to approach the recipe formulation adjustments.  The 
technique I used, which is handy if you use a software program like SUDS, was 
to assume about 65% mash conversion efficiency.  This way you can aim for 
your actual target recipe gravity and color and still be pretty close after 
all's said & done.  The alternate technique is to use the actual conversion 
efficiency (say 75% - 80%) as if you were formulating a regular five-gallon 
batch, then boost the amount of each grain by about 25% - 30%.  This should 
give Charley an indication of "how much sugar is still left" after not 
sparging ;-) 
 
For a five-gallon batch, I collected three gallons of concentrated wort (no 
sparge, just recirc & drain).  This ended up giving me a final product 
gravity close to what I predicted.  Since I only had three gallons of wort, I 
could continue using my 16-qt stockpot for boiling on the kitchen stove, 
adding makeup water to the fermenter to get the recipe's five gallons. 
 Again, if you have a large kettle, you can add the water to the wort before 
boiling. 
 
The beer thus produced tasted great!  Keep in mind that when boiling 
concentrated wort, your hop utlization will be lower than a full-volume boil. 
 Also note that since you're making wort of concentrated gravity, you'll be 
limited by the size of the mashtun as to the gravity of wort you can produce. 
 A 5-gal picnic cooler tun can produce a beer well into the 50's of OG (after 
adding makeup water; that is, the actual recipe gravity).  You can always add 
a pound or two of high-quality extract to increase the gravity without 
compromising the "all-grain character", or simply use a bigger mashtun. 
 
Equipment-wise, all you'll need is a mashtun.  My Coleman went on permanent 
vacation so I just made a new one using a 5-gal Gott.  I removed the spigot 
and replaced it with a Fass-Frisch bung (the kind used in mini-kegs) minus 
the plastic insert, installed with the large flanged end inside the cooler. 
 I shoved in a 2" long piece of 5/8" OD vinyl tubing flush with the outer 
surface of the bung.  Next I pushed the barb end of a 1/2" NPT x 1/2" hose 
barb brass coupling into the tubing in the bung, from the outside.  I can now 
attach any number of different 1/2" valves to the coupling (I used Teflon 
thread tape too).  I use a right-angle CPVC stop valve which accepts a 
compression-fit tube to run wort to the bottom of the kettle.  Inside the 
mashtun, I attached my copper-pipe manifold.  It's made of 1/2" copper pipe & 
fittings in the shape of a square with a cross-piece, and drilled with a 
bunch of 3/32" holes.  It terminates with a 45-deg fitting that slides nicely 
over the 5/8" tubing, connecting it to the valve.  I also toss a cut-to-size 
sheet of 8-holes-per-inch nylon needlepoint mesh on top to prevent the 
manifold from getting scooped up with the spoon. 
 
Phil's Phalse Bottom is another potential route to go (does he make a 5-gal 
version?).  I'ts a ready-made dome of plastic, drilled and fitted with a hose 
barb, so you can use the same bung technique; just run the tubing far enough 
to attach to the Phalse Bottom (check the required tubing size though). 
 
Finally, there's the Easy-Masher design, bought or home-made.  It's a rolled 
screen with one end folded over and closed off, and the other end slipped & 
clamped over the end of the drain tubing.  You can bastardize a kitchen 
strainer for a chunk of SS screen. 
 
Brewing Technique:  For a simple one-step infusion mash (British pale ale 
malt is well-suited for this), add all your grains to the mash tun, and add 
1.3 to 1.5 qt 165F - 170F water per pound of grain; mix well.  Shoot for a 
temperature of about 152F, though anything from 150F to 155F will give 
satisfactory results.  Cover the tun and wait 60 - 90 minutes.  Open the tun 
and add a gallon or so of boiling water to mash-out at 165F (if there's room; 
otherwise, don't worry).  You should have a length of tubing going from the 
valve to the bottom of the kettle to prevent splashing and HSA.  But first, 
you'll want to recirculate the first runnings to set the grain bed and clear 
most of the debris from the runoff.  Open the valve very slowly and collect 
about a quart of runoff.  Close the valve and gently return the runoff to the 
top of the mashtun.  Repeat until the wort is chunk-free and the turbid haze 
gives way to "clear" wort (you'll probably still get a few chunks and the 
wort won't necessarily be crystal-clear, but these are your ideal goals). 
 The flow rate for both recirc and sparge should be quite slow, maybe 1 qt 
per minute, to prevent stirring up of the grain bed.  Now (slowly again) 
drain the wort to the bottom of your kettle.  When you've collected the 
target amount, shut off the valve and continue brewing, adding makeup water 
either now or later. 
 
How much sugar is left behind?  Who cares?  You have what you want in the 
kettle, so try not to weep too bitterly as you drain the remaining runoff 
into the sink.

Subject: Belgian Wit


Okay I brewed a Belgian wit last weekend, but I only had 1/4 oz 
(7.1 grams for you euro-brewers) of coriander.  I wanted to add a 
full oz (28 grams) but did not have time to run down to the 
store.  As a solution, I figured I'd dry-coriander the secondary. 
 
The question is, how do I go about doing this?  I could crush the 
coriander, pour boiling water over it to make a tea, and dump 
that in the secondary.  I could put it whole or crushed into a bag 
and toss it in, but I'd be worried about infection.  I could put 
the bag into a cup of water.  Boil it for a few minutes, and dump 
the bag and the tea into the secondary.  I could add one seed to 
each bottle, but again I would like to sanitize them somehow. 
 
Does anyone have experience with this? I'm kind of new to brewing 
with spice. 
 
Thanks,

Subject: grain storage: plastic and mousies


 
Looks like I fed some mousies through last winter.  Had  a couple of 
unopened sacks of grain sitting in my garage on top of my empty (sniff) 
corny kegs. Mousies chewed a very small hole through the outer and inner 
plastic of a sack of EDME.   Surprisingly they left the sack of wheat 
alone.  Somehow they got several pounds out of that tiny hole (the grain 
hulls are piled on the floor beneath the kegs). 
 
Last night I picked up 3 18-gal Rubbermaid roughnecks.  Metal garbage cans 
were too big and not too stackable (I *almost* got some of the expensive 
10-gallon cans, a few gallons too small for a sack and the lid's not too 
tight).  The roughnecks are made of LDPE.  Am I doomed to having 
determined hungry mousies gnawing through the plastic (probably at the 
joint between the lid and the container) to get to my precious grain?  If 
these things are totally unsuitable I can always use them for storing 
books.
