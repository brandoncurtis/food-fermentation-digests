Subject: carmelising sugar


 
I'm getting ready to brew a Belgian abbey-like beer in my ongoing 
quest to brew every beer I've ever liked.  I read the article in a 
past HBD on carmelising sugar, and I also tried a small scale batch. 
The article mentions carmelising will occur at temps higher than 180F. 
Do most people just boil the stuff?  The article also mentions you 
shouldn't stir it for some reason.  Is this guff?  How do you keep it 
from not scorching w/o stirring it?  Finally, are there any secrets 
for getting a deep amber color?  Is it just longer boil times?  I 
couldn't seem to get much of a color change.  I used table sugar 
dissolved in 1/3 it's weight in water.  I'm planning on carmelising 
the sugar the night before, and then simply reheating it in the 
microblaster when it's time to add it to the boil.

Subject: No Bubbles


 
Hi folks, 
 
I've got a porblem with my latest batch of brew.  It's got no carbonation. 
I'd appreciate any help that anyone can offer. 
 
It a standard american pale ale 
 
6lbs M&F malt extract 
4 oz toasted 2-row 
3 oz 40 L crystal 
1.5 oz Cascade pellets 4.7% (60 min) 
.25 oz Cascade pellets (10 min) 
.25 oz willamette pellets 4.3% (10min) 
.25 oz cascade pellets (2 min) 
.25 oz willamette pellets (2 min) 
2 oz cascade pellets (dry hopped) 
Wyeast 1056 
 
This batch had SG 1.045 and was aerated for 35 minutes before the yeast 
was pitched (from a 22 oz starter).  Fermentation was visible after about 
5 hours.  One week later the beer was racked to the secondary (F.G. 1.007) 
and .5 Tbsp. polyclar was added to remove the chill haze and  the dry hops 
were added two days later. The beer was bottled two weeks later 
with 3/4 c. corn sugar.  I should note that the secondary had almost no 
sediment with the exception of the hops.  After about two weeks in the 
bottle the beer was still sweet and uncarbonated so I gently turned the 
bottles over in the hope of rousing the yeast from the bottom of the 
bottles.  Here I again noticed that there was little if any yeast visible 
at the bottom of the bottles.  After four weeks in the bottles still no 
carbonation.  I don't think that the beer has been exposed to any 
temperatures below 65F or any sudden changes in temperature. 
 
Has anyone had any similar experiences?  Anyone got any ideas on how to 
rescue two cases of otherwise delicious beer? 
 
Private email is preferred.  I'll post a summary of responses.  TIA

Brewsters: 
 
I have always felt there has to be a better way to clean that cobra head beer 
dispenser for my Cornies than disassembling it, washing, etc. 
 
I was trying to figure out how to use the Carbonator(R) as a way to hold open 
the spring valve on the disconnect while I sprayed water inside. During our 
discussion, Julianne Targan of Hop & Vine in Morristown, NJ ( no affiliation, 
etc.) had a great idea which is beautiful in its simplicity and makes me say, "
Why didn't I think of that?". 
 
Use the Carbonator on a typical plastic soda bottle.  Fill the bottle with 
sanitizing solution, screw on the Carbonator, snap the beer line disconnect 
onto
the Carbonator, depress the cobra head lever at the other end of the beer line 
and squeeze the bottle and the beer and then the sanitizing solution will exit 
the port..  I then take a second bottle and rinse with water. Unscrew the 
carbonator from the bottle, depress the poppet valve on the carbonator and 
allow
the water in the hose to drain out by gravity.  Fast and easy. 
- ----------------------------------------------------------- 
I'm looking for an alternative to Iodophor which I seem to be able to taste in 
the smallest quantities. Chempro SDP(R) was suggested as an alternative.  Any 
idea what the composition is?  This British packaging has NO composition 
information, even in the section on hazardous assistance, except to say 
incorrect mixing may cause the generation of chlorine.  Is it stable as a 
solution and for how long? 
- ----------------------------------------------------------- 
I cultured some yeast from a bottle of Blue label Chimay since I wanted a yeast
that could withstand a high OG and the resultant alcohol. It seemed to be doing
fine in the starter, fermenting nicely and rapidly for 5 days and then abruptly
stopped.  I assumed it was finished.  I prepared a Strong Belgian Ale wort and 
tasted the starter beer before pitching as I always do. It tasted fine but was 
still a little sweet and reminded me of Buckley Brothers' yeast I obtained from
a brewery in Wales when I lived there. The sweetness concerned me because I was
pitching it into an OG of 1.072, but I pitched anyway.  Fermentation started 
within 24 hours at 70F, giving a good mat, but not one I would expect from an 
ale yeast. After three days it was obvious it was slowing. I closed the furnace
room door and got the temperature up to 77F.   Whether or not this was the 
cause, a dense bright white foam about 1/2 inch in thickness appeared within a 
few hours on one side of the fermenter and gradually spread across most of the 
top of the fermenting wort.  The aroma with the first ferment was relatively 
odorless, the second is very fruity and luscious smelling. To me this sounds 
like two kinds of yeast, maybe the bottom fermenting (?)  yeast used for 
bottling took off first, then the lower concentration primary fermentation ale 
yeast took off. In all the years of brewing I have never seen this. I can't 
understand why the bottling yeast ( if that's what it was and not a wild yeast)
couldn't tolerate a high alcohol concentration which is what its used for. 
Anyone else with experience or comments? Does Chimay use two kinds of yeast, 
one
for fermentation and one for bottling? Is their primary yeast made up of more 
than one yeast with vastly different habits? AlK, I think I remember you saying
you toured some Belgian breweries last year. Thoughts?

Well, mein freund its all those Germans who migrated to St. Louis and other 
parts of the midwest just in time for the lager revolution. Prior to that all 
US
beers were ales and I believe dark ones at that. George Washington was a Porter
fan if I recollect correctly. 
- -------------------------------------------------- 
 
John Wilkinson and  Barry Vanhoff are discussing the amount and temperature of 
water to add to get to a certain strike temperature.  Here's an edited version 
of something I sent via private mail in another discussion. 
 
The first portion ( which contains the reasoning behind the calculations) deals
with a "goods" mash or premash which contains adjuncts, some malt and water and
is sometimes boiled. To this goods mash is added water and the remaining grist.
The second portion deals with a typical single infusion mash which you are 
discussing. Corrections are also dealt with for those using coolers as mashing 
tuns. 
 
So here goes: 
 
I usually calculate the temperature and volume of the strike water because I do
so many different things before I strike depending on the batch makeup. So, 
rules of thumb seldom work for me.  For example, I use adjuncts which are not 
always easy to sparge, so I do a goods mash first. Depending on the temperature
and composition of the goods mash will determine the temperature and quantity 
of
strike water. 
 
For example, the specific heat of most adjuncts and malt is 0.4 which means 
that
10 lbs of malt acts like 4 pounds of water as far as heat goes.  So, if there 
are 8.6 pounds of water per gallon, then 10 # of malt is equal to 4/8.6 or 
0.465
gallons of water. 
 
If you have say one gallon of water and three pounds of malt in a goods mash at
200 F then this is equivalent to 1.12 gallons of water at 200F. (3 X 0.4) = 
0.12 gallon equivalents from the malt plus a gallon of real water = 1.12 
 
As an example, if you want this mixture of goods mash plus malt plus strike 
water to be say 150 F after you add the remaining 7 # of malt and strike water 
at 70F 
 
Question is how much water at 70 F do you need to add to get it there? 
 
Since the goods will drop by 50 F ( 200 F to 150F) it will give up 1.12 X 50 = 
56 heat equivalents and the water and malt we add will increase in temperature 
by (150-70) degrees = 80 F.**Since the heat given up by the goods mash must 
equal the heat taken up by the added water plus malt**, we get: 56/80 = 0.7 
gallons of 70 F water equivalents ( i.e. water plus the malt). Remember the 7  
pounds of malt will be equal to 7 X 0.4 = 2.8 pounds of water or 2.8 / 8.6 = 
0.32 gallons.   SO 0.7 - 0.32 = 0.38 gallons of water  `at` 70F to add. 
 
I would then take the goods mash at 200F, add the 0.38 gallons of 70F water and
stir in my 7 pounds of malt. The strike temperature will be 150F. If this 
grist/liquor ratio isn't correct, see below how to calculate the amount of 
water
at temperature T to get the correct ratio. 
 
To do the thing you want to do in a single infusion mash, it is even easier. If
you have, say 10 pounds of malt at 70F, how much water at what temperature do 
you need to add to get to a mash of say 1.3 qts/lb mash thickness? 
 
1.3 qts/lb X 10 lbs = 13 qts ( 3.25 gallons) of water at some temperature T 
will be used to heat up 10 # of malt (4 lbs equivalent to water = 4/8.6 = 0.46 
gallon equivalents.)   Now, 3.25 (T- 150) = 0.46 (150 -70)  thus  T = 
( 36.8 + 487)/3.25 = 523.8/3.25 = 161 degrees. So add 13 qts of 161F water to  
the malt and the strike temperature will be 150F 
 
If your mash was only 1 qt / lb then 10 qts/4 = 2.5 gallons so: 2.5(T-150) = 
0.46(150 - 70) and T =(37 + 375)/2.5 = 165 F. Which is about 15 degrees above  
mash T. So your rule of thumb of 15 degrees for a 1 qt/lb mash is obviously 
good
and works for you.   In all this you have to take into account the water 
equivalents of the mash tun if you can't heat it up directly. I don't have to  
worry about the heat equivalent of my mash tun, I just heat from within a few 
degrees to the desired temperature.  
 
Incidentally, if you want to calculate the heat equivalent of your mash tun, 
here's how you do it.  If you wanted 150F for a composition of 2.5 gallons of 
water and 10# of mash and you got say 145F, then 2.9 plus mashtun gallon 
equivalents at 145 is what you have and you calculated 2.9 gallons at 150F. 
 
You actually have (2.9  + X) 145  = 2.9 X 150 = 5 X 2.9/145  = 0.1 gallon 
equivalents for your mash tun Use this number as though you were adding it to  
your grist in your calculations. Thus instead of 0.46 gallon equivalents of 
malt
you would use 0.56. 
 
If you have a mash tun you can heat directly, don't bother to correct for the 
heat capacity of the tun, just add the calculated amount and it will give you a
strike temperature a few degrees below the desired temp.  Heat to the desired 
strike temp. 
 
Looks complicated, but it isn't after you do it a few times.

Charley likes the idea of recirculating his wort through hot water but asks 
about my detailled instructions for coil construction and implementation:

Actually it isn't the Coriolis force that is important in this case, since you 
are adding heat to your wort rather than removing heat from your wort. In this 
case it involves magneto-rotation based on a rule derived from a special case 
of
the Beer-Lambert law applied to rotatrons in hyperspace for liquids with an SG 
>
1.070 and that's the reason for the left hand rule.

Subject: plastic pickle buckets


I have 5 or so plastic pickle buckets which smell of well, 
pickles.  I filled them with a bleach solution, and let them sit 
for a week, but they still smell.  I used iodine, but still 
no luck.  I bet if I put beer in them, that would take the smell 
out, but I'd have pickle beer.  Has anyone brewed a pickle beer? 
Sounds kind of sick.  What should I use to clean these things? 
I have some lye, but I don't know how that reacts with plastic. 
My gut feel is that it would be fine. 
 
Private e-mail fine,

4lb Irish stout extract 
3.3 lb dark extract 
1lb oatmeal partial mash 
5.5 gal water 
Irish ale wyeast,  8oz starter 040. 
 
Why did foam bubble out of my airlock for about 24hours.   I freaked/over 
reacted and blamed it on the gods!    This is only my 4th batch of beer 
and first partial mash. 
I thought I simply over filled the plastic 6gal primary fermenter, so I put 
1gal in a 1gal glass jug w/airlock and replaced the airlock on the 6gal 
fermenter.  Everything was normal for about 1 hour then more foam.  It 
pushed the water out of the airlock every time.    I replaced the airlock 3 
times and did everything I could to keep outside foam/wort from getting 
back in when I changed the airlock.   The airlock on the 1gal jug had foam 
and I was forced to clean it once.  Things did settle down after the 
24hours or so to a normal active ferment. 
It has been 8 days and primary fermentation is over.     I will bottle half 
and put the other half in a 2.8 gal carboy.   I tasted it and it seems fine at 
this point. 
 
Why did this happen?  Was it the oatmeal? bubble wall density kinda 
thing?  To much yeast?

Subject: Brewpot/Fermenter Size


This is the 3rd time I have sent this posting into the homebrew digest. 
I stll haven't seen it published.  What am I doing wrong? 
 
We would like to step up the size of our brewing operations.  We 
currently brew extract in 5 gal batches.  Recently my brew buddy and I 
have been making double batches.  We use two 4 gal pots on the stove 
to 2 6 gal plastic fermenters to 2 5 gal carboys (secondary, 
lagering).  We would like to make single 10 gal batches with just 
single fermenters and secondaries. (fully rehydrate extract)  We will 
be moving up to a larger burner. (35k btu) 
 
My questions are:  How big of brewpot do you need for 10 gal to boil? 
Is there a rule of thumb for how much headroom you should have to help 
prevent boilover.  Also, What size of fermenter do you use?  Again, 
how much headroom do you need to allow for fermentation?  Are there 
10/15 gal carboys, glass jugs out there?  What about Plastic sizes? 
What are people doing now?  Splitting the 10 gal wort into multiple 
fermenters/carboys? 
 
And I quick question about bottling.  Has anybody bottled 10 gal at 
one time?  Did you feel you got a good mix with the priming suger? 
How did you beer carbonate? 
 
Thanks

Our competition has been growing over the years. Last year we had close to 
300 entries. Following our competition is our awards dinner featuring some of 
the best beer and food that can be found at a homebrew gathering.   Not only 
do we brew our own beer, but we do our own cooking.  After the dinner, we 
will retire to Growler's Pub which is just a hop and a skip from the dinner 
site.  Growler's features a selection of over 130 beers. 
 
If you are competing for Midwest Homebrewer of the Year honors, our 
competition closes out the 1996 race.   If you think you have a chance to 
win, enter a lot of beers.  Tom Fitzpatrick and Al Korzonas alone accounted 
for more than 150 of our entries last year.  Well, actually it was somewhat 
less than that but these guys were both on a mission!  You too can take part. 
 
We are trying some new approaches this year, one of which is electronic 
registration for competition entries and judges.  Electronic entry forms, 
general competition information and maps are available at: 
 
   http://www.biostat.wustl.edu/~jack/hhhc96 
 
Registering your entries electonically provides an advantage for competitors 
because: 
 
 Registering electronically gets you a price break ($4 per entry instead of 
$5) 
 Registering electronically is easier than manually filling out entry forms 
 
The entry deadline for the competition is November 30th.   If you will be 
attending our 
competition, you are welcome to bring your entries with you, but you must be 
registered via the electronic entry form (or manually via the mail) by 
November 30.   There will be no exceptions.   Just remember, if we have your 
paperwork, electronically or otherwise, you are entered. 
 
We are also accepting judge registration electonically.   While the obvious 
advantage to our club is that we have enough judges, there is an advantage 
for you also.  Registering electronically allows us to ensure that you have 
overnight accomodations (Beds for Judges..not the Ritz-Carlton) and that we 
have a spot for you at our Awards Banquet which follows the competition. 
 
All entrants and judges are invited and encouraged to attend our competition 
and festivities. As mentioned earlier, all the information you need is 
available on the website listed above.  If anyone has questions or would like 
a complete announcement E-Mailed directly to them, please respond to my 
E-Mail address. 
 
Thanks and Good Brewing to You All!

Subject: RE: competition announcement / CORRECTION


A sharp-eyed homebrewer in the cornfields of Illinois brought an error to 
my attention.  The _heading_ of the competition announcement for the 
Madison Homebrewers' November Classic incorrectly stated that the 
competition is the Eleventh Annual Big and Huge.  My error.  Big and Huge 
XI is in May 1997.  The upcoming competition is the Eleventh Annual 
_November Classic_. The information in the body of the announcement is 
correct, but the error in the heading may have caused some confusion. 
Sorry. Send us your entries, come judge, do beer! 
 
Now go have a beer,

Subject: Trub


I know this is an unusual question but I will ask anyway. 
 
While I was racking my latest batch of beer, my wife noticed the trub in the 
bottom of the carboy.  She asked what it was.  I replied "yeast and 
protein."  She asked if there were any good uses for this stuff.  Her 
reasoning is that women spend large sums of money for mud face packs and 
hair conditioners and the like.  Since it looks and smells rather disgusting 
(to a non-brewer), she thought may have some cosmetic benefits.  Does anyone 
know if it is good for skin and/or hair?  Is my wife totally nuts 
{rhetorical question}?  She does however drink stout so suppose I can't get 
rid of her :) 
 
TIA, standard disclaimers apply, close cover before striking, yadda, yadda....

Subject: Grain Mill Static Cling!


        I've sent this message before, and got a comfirmation from HBD that 
it was in queue, but I never saw it in the Digest. Instead, I saw a long 
list of [none] () where my article should have been published . Actually, 
I've seen a lot of those [none] ()'s  lately what's the deal? 
        Anyway, here's my post: 
 
               I'm using a Phil's Mill without motorised help, just the old 
hand crank! I find it creates a lot of static and I end up with husks and 
flour clinging to the mill, the handle, the bucket below, the PET bottle 
hopper above, the floor, the table, my hands, you get the picture. 
        Is there anything I can do to reduce this static? Can I spray 
something (like Endust) on the mill or can I "ground" it to reduce this 
static buildup? It really creates more of mess than it should. I'm using it 
in a store and each time a customer buys grain, I find myself spending 5 
minutes cleaning up after the grind. 
        ANY advice would be greatly appreciated. Please help!

Because, contrary to the all-grain 'elitists'; There *is* a difference 
between various extracts.  Substituting one for another will change the 
characteristics of the brew.

Hello all, 
 
I am a newbie to the list. I just brewed my first batch in three years = 
(have had several batches prior). 
 
I am looking into kegging this batch rather than bottling. I am looking = 
for good and economical kegging systems that might fit in a standard = 
refrigerator. Any opinions? 
 
If this is in an FAQ, then I apologize, can you please direct me to it? 
 
Otherwise, big thanks. Looking forward to exchanging home-brew tips and = 
ideas.

Thanks to everyone who posted, or emailed in response to chiller 
sanitation. 
 
Seems like hot/boiling water was the overall choice, with periodic heavy 
cleanings. Sanitizing solutions for storage were recommended also. 
 
Great thing about email responses..all signal, no noise.

Subject: Re: Brewer's Tragedy


Rob Moline reports of a horrific caustic accident at Boulevard Beers in 
Kansas City, MO.  I wish them a full and speedy recovery.  However, the 
incident illustrates a much neglected aspect of brewing - safety. 
 
In the March-April 1996 issue of _The New Brewer_ (pp.62-63) they 
printed some results of their For Brewers Only Survey...here's some 
relating to safety: 
- - - - - 
Do you wear safety glasses?  107 Yes / 56 No 
Have you been hurt on the job?  81 Yes / 84 No 
  28 of those responding Yes had burns from wort, water or steam 
  18 had chemical, caustic or alkaline burns (4 suffered burns to eyes) 
- - - - - 
These are outrageous numbers!  One third doesn't wear eye protection. 
Fully one fourth of the total respondents reported burns.  Half the 
respondents had been hurt on the job.  This is a terrible safety record. 
 
I bring this up not to whip those poor folks at Boulevard (because they 
now understand about safety beyond any lesson I could give) but to 
alert homebrewers to the fact that the same hazards exist for them when 
they brew.  Not to say that everyone blows scalding caustic thru their 
homebrew system, but handling scalding liquids is pretty much in 
everyone's repertiore along with hot surfaces.  Are those carboys carted 
around in cradles, or do you just give them a big hug and haul them here 
and there<<shudder>>?  How secure are the handles on your brewpot? 
 
I urge everyone to review their safety habits and reduce their risk 
where they can.  Keep it safe.

Subject: Leakie cornies/Web sites


I posted a request for help a while back regarding my leaking cornie kegs. 
The problem was narrowed down to my kegs O-rings .... the one that goes on 
the outside of the valve fitting assembly. Rubber bands only provided a 
temporary fix so I got after my supplier about this. 
 
The verdict: Pin-lock and ball-lock fitting take different size O-rings! My 
supplier did not know this and only stocked ball-lock O-rings. 
 
Homebrew suppliers are a good source of info but they are not always right. 
Mine special ordered these pin-lock O-rings but told me I had to take all 100 
as no else had those 'weird old kegs'. When I was picking up my order an 
employee said he has the same problem. Now guess who will be stocking both 
types of O-rings? 
 
While I am taking up space: I want to thank those people who post their 
homebrew web pages. These pages are a valuable source of info (they could 
answer a lot of stuff posted here) and have links to many other sites. My 
favorites are personal web pages not supported by any commercial interests, 
just generous homebrewers sharing with others. My favorite is one put 
together by Pat Babcock. Does anyone else have a favorite or one of their 
own? If you send them to me by private e-mail I will put together a list and 
post it here. Please give the complete web address and a description of each. 
I would like to keep this an homebrew informational list only. This will 
exclude advertisements, brewery sites, catalogs, beer mirror sellers and the 
like. Thanks in advance for your help and please give me a month to put this 
together. 
 
Thanks,

Subject: Re: Single vessel full mash


A brain fart for the group's wise consideration. 
 
If as recent posts suggest a sparge is not essential then 
consider a system with a single large vessel with a single 
heat source. 
 
Inside that large boiler suspend 1 inch off the bottom a grain 
basket, for example a HPDE bucket with holes ddrilled in the bottom. 
Obviously a SS bucket with mesh base would be ideal. 
 
Inside that basket fit a central archimedies style pump as described 
in my earleir post and reffered to some here as the "Aussie Recirculator" 
 
Process then would be:- 
1..add water to boiler and raise to strike temp 
2..gently lower empty grain basket while slowly adding and wetting grain 
3..start recirculation pump 
4..add heat as required and hold for mash time 
5..raise to sparge temp 
6..turn off recirculation pump 
7..elevate basket clear of boiler 
8..top up boiler with water to required volume 
9..boil 
10..open next homebrew 
 
Proposed system would be 
.. simple 
.. less gear therefore could buy better quality for same budget 
.. occupy less space 
.. easier to automate the heating process with only one heat point
