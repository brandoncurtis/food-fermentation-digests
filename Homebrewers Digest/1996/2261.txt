Subject: Wort Chiller Water Speed


Fellow Homebrewers, 
 
I have a homemade wort chiller (3/8 " copper tube 30 feet long, shaped 
around a paint can) and have always wondered how fast to run the water thru 
it for cooling.  Being a spark chaser and not an expert on thermal 
transfer, any suggestions on how fast to run the water thru the coil for 
the most efficient cooling??

Subject: First from Scratch


I have brewed several batches of beer from the can, and their ain't much 
that can go wrong there.  About a week ago I went to a homebrewing class to 
learn how to do this from scratch, then came up with a basic Scotch Ale 
recipe, made some modifications and have just now completed making my first 
batch from scratch and putting it in the carboy. 
 
I would welcome any comments, good or bad, about the following recipe.  It 
will, of course, be a couple months before I can tell how well, or how badly 
I did.  In all liklihood I will brew another batch before this one is done 
so your comments would be greatly appreciated.  Also, one question.  Should 
the hops be removed from the wert before placement in the carboy?  I didn't 
know so I left them in for the primary fermentation but will remove them 
when I transfer to a new carboy for secondary fermentation. 
 
Thanks in advance for your comments and suggestions. 
 
First Prepared 3-Nov   
Style                   Scotch Ale   
Name                    Rons Scotch Ale   
 
1# Briess 60L crystal malt    
1/2# Hugh Baird peated malt    
1/2# Briess Dextrine/Carapils malt    
1/8# Briess Chocolate malt    
1 tsp Irish Moss    
9 lbs pale malt extract    
2 oz. Domestic Hallaertauer hops  Alpha 4.3 Beta 3.1 
Wyeast 1728 Scottish    
 
Mash grains in grain bag with enough water to cover.  Bring to just under 
boil and then reduce heat    
to 150-160F (ML on my stove).   Cook for sixty minutes, stirring often.    
Rehydrate but do not add Irish Moss at this time.    
Add malt extract and bring to boil. 
Add 1.5 oz hops and again reduce heat and let simmer 30 minutes 
Add .25 oz hops and simmer 15 minutes 
Add .25 oz hops and Irish Moss and return to just under boil, then simmer 15 
minutes 
Remove from heat, top off to five gallons in carboy.  When temperature is 
under ninety degrees F, 
add Wyeast, mix thoroughly and then fit with airlock. 
Upon completion of primary fermentation, transfer to secondary fermentation 
vessel. 
Prime when fermentation is complete. 
This beer should taste good after priming, but increase notably after two 
months.

Subject: Clairifing


Hi all, 
 
I'm a newbie to homebrewing, and the digest.  I'm on my second batch of 
beer,"Ponpensity Pilsner" from TNCJOHB.  I seeped the cyrstal malt after I 
crushed it for 1/2 hour at 150F.  I then boiled everything according to 
recipe, poured the boiled wort into 3 gal of cold water temp was 65F after, 
pitched a starter yeast from two packages of dried lager yeast.  Everything 
went great.  I left it in the primary for 6 days at 55F.  Transfered to the 
secondary, temp had dropped to 50F.  The problem I have is that when I 
transfered to the secondary, the beer was very cloudy.  It seems to be the 
right color, kind of golden mud looking.  The OG was 1.066, SG was 1.033. 
Will this beer clear in the secondary, or can I add some type of clairifier 
to it to clear it up, or will I have to drink cloudy beer?  The beer tasted 
fine when I transfered it, still to sweet, but goood! 
 
 
TIA 
 
private e-mail is fine

Subject: Should I top off 2nd fermentor to equal 5 gallons ???


I just transfered my Oatmeal Stout to the secondary fermentor and with 
the waste left in the bottom of the primary, I don't have a complete 5 
gallons. 
My FG was 1.058 and the final (after 7 days) is 1.016. If I did my 
calculations correct then I have a 8% alcohol. It may be a bit strong. 
 
So should I put in another 1/2 gallon of sterilized water to make up the 
difference ? 
Does it matter if I do this when I add the priming sugar ? 
Should I leave it alone ? 
How long should I leave it in the secondary ? 
How mych water introduced actually makes a difference in the taste of the 
beer. I think I am looking at 4 1/2 gallons and the stuff tastes pretty 
good. Would I notice a drop in the taste when I add 1/2 gallon ?? 
 
 
Any suggestions will be helpfull.

Subject: The Price of Beer in Utah


 
My apologies if this is a tad off the subject of homebrewing.  Most of us 
brewers, though, appreciate fine beers in general (especially microbrews 
and imports), and I felt that this would be of interest to most here. 
Also, this *may* wind up being a repost, since my other ISP seems to have 
bitten the dust for the moment.  Any flames should be directed through 
private email to me at jander`at`wasatch.com.  I'd also appreciate 
comparisons to policies of other states (once again, through private 
email). 
 
 * Carbon Copy: 
 * Original message to ALL on the State of Utah Online Service 
 
I have received a response to my email to Governor Leavitt regarding beer 
markups in Utah.  It came from Kenneth F. Wynn, Director of the Department 
of Alcoholic Beverage Control.  Rather than providing me with the cost 
breakdown that I desired, he stated simply that, "By law, a minimum 
markup, a school lunch tax [???], a sales tax, and in the case of beer, a 
beer tax is applied to the landed case cost to the state.  A delivery cost 
per case is also applied to reach the final retail price." 
 
In an attempt to get specific costs regarding a case of Pilsner Urquell, I 
called his office.  His secretary (Claire) told me that she would get me 
this information next week.  I also asked about pertinent Utah Code, and 
she directed me to Title 32A.  This is where things start to fascinate me: 
 
Section 32A-1-103 references protection of [get THIS] - yes, MORALS! 
(Conclusion: you can lack morals in Utah, but it's gonna cost ya!) 
 
Section 32A-1-122 is right at the heart of the matter: "Except as provided 
in Subsections (2) and (3), all liquor sold within the state shall be 
marked up in an amount not less than 61% above the cost to the department, 
excluding federal excise taxes." 
 
A 61% MARKUP!  And that doesn't include the other various and sundry taxes 
and costs .... I can't wait to see how *they* add up. 
 
Section 32A-8-101 says that homebrewing is a class B misdemeanor. 
 
Section 32A-10-101 provides for additional "local" taxes. 
 
Section 32A-14-101 ("Dramshop Act") provides that "ANY PERSON" providing 
alcoholic beverages to others can be liable for their subsequent actions. 
Not just businesses ... ANYBODY!  (The online version notes that this 
section will be superseded on 7/1/97, but it doesn't provide the new 
language.) 
 
Regarding this latter provision, how about a little help here?  About a 
month or two ago I heard that the Utah Supreme Court was going to make a 
ruling regarding whether the Dramshop Act actually applied to us 
individual Joe Blow's.  But I never heard the result.  Could it be that 
this ruling has something to do with the 7/1/97 revision?  Can anyone 
provide me an online pointer to Utah Supreme Court decisions? 
 
Okay, maybe I'm boring you to tears -- I understand that most people here 
(representative, perhaps, of the general population of Utah) don't indulge 
in alcoholic beverages.  But try to look at it from my point of view -- I 
happen to receive great satisfaction from trying out different beers from 
all over the world -- some might call me a connoisseur. Indeed, it's a 
(yes, legitimate) hobby of mine.  For a moment, then, put the shoe on the 
other foot.  How would you like it if the Great State of Utah put a 61%+ 
levy on the foods and hobbies that *YOU* enjoy?  Maybe by putting a 61% 
surcharge on that lobster you had at a restaurant?  Or by putting a 61% 
surcharge on lift tickets, for instance? 
 
Many nations (properly, in my opinion) statutorily designate beer as a 
FOOD item.  How would you like it if, on your next $100 expenditure at 
Smith's or Albertson's, a state official walked up and said, "I'll take 
another $61, please?" 
 
I am outraged by this, folks.  Whether the State of Utah is protecting my 
morals or its own bottom line, this is unconscionable in my book. 
 
So concludes (for the moment, anyway) Jim's Soapbox Subject of the Day.

Subject: Air Regulators


After a couple of emails, the consensus is that the regulators sold at 
Builder's Square(and likely the other chains and stores carrying compressed 
air stuff) won't work for two reasons: 
 
1) Most importantly, the regulators only go up to 200# pressure. 
2) The threads are different.

Subject: BS on HBD


I have tried posting this several times, and it keeps getting lost.  Maybe 
it's becoming one of those dreaded "none" messages.  (BTW, does anyone know 
what that's all about?)  Anyway, here it goes again.  If the others make it 
through, I apologize for the repeat. 
 
I agree with those who think that too much of a good thing can turn into a 
bad thing.  Let's try to limit discussion to questions/answers/comments on 
making better beer, and dispense with the extraneous BS.  Following are a 
few guidelines, in no partucular order, which I'm sure others can expand upon: 
 
Don't waste bandwidth bashing AHA, AOB, Charlie P., Karen B., etc. - take it 
to the recently established newsgroup alt.beer.aha. If you've been a member 
of the AHA, and are quitting, don't tell me - I don't care.  (Don't praise 
them either - you can take that to the newsgroup, too.)  Also, if you're 
leaving HBD, don't tell us why, just go quietly. 
 
Don't attack the character of fellow HBDers.  It hurts them, and demeans 
you.  However, don't hold back if someone suggests something that's flat out 
wrong (make sure you're right!), dangerous, or just plain stupid. 
 
Don't worry about the occasional sarcastic wisecrack; most of us enjoy that 
type of humor.  But remember, this is a beer forum, not a joke forum. 
 
If you're traveling out of town and want to know where the good beer bars 
are, use the yellow pages.  There are also some good pubcrawler guides on 
the WWW - try the Real Beer Page (http://realbeer.com) or the Pub Crawler 
(http://www.pubcrawler.com).  Also, don't share a recently completed 
out-of-town pub crawl with the rest of us.  I realize that the beer and the 
barmaid may have been fantastic, but chances are few of us will ever be near 
the places you just visited. 
 
Discussions involving commercial beer are fine, but only as it relates to 
discussions about homebrew.  Trying to find out if anyone's developed a good 
clone of a particular beer is fine, but let's not waste space arguing that 
Commercial Beer A is better than Commercial Beer B. 
 
Keep signature lines to a minimum.  A line or two of an amusing quote is 
fine, but ten lines get old quickly.  Also, lose the little guys climbing up 
the page and the star-bordered, 12-line address boxes. 
 
If you are just starting out, and looking for very basic information, don't 
limit yourself to the instructions that came with your first beer kit - get 
a book (or two). Most major bookstores are now carrying books on homebrewing 
in the food and cooking section. I'm not trying to discourage newbies from 
asking "dumb" questions, just trying to help you ask better questions. 
 
Freely share your questions/answers/comments/experiences on malt, hops, 
yeast, equipment, process, books, etc., etc., etc.  That is what HBD is all 
about - brewers helping brewers make better beer.

Subject: Cobra cleanout/Hey! Thanks!


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager! 
 
In HBD 2260, Dave Burley ponders the cleaning of his cobra faucet. 
Don't know if Dave's cornie fittings are of this ilk, but every one 
I've seen of late has a slot on the side opposite the port for the 
keg. If you put a screwdriver into this slot and rotate it 
counter-clockwise it unscrews, removing the plunger valve inside. 
(Watch out for the little rubber seal at its base! I've lost one 
once, and have never found a replacement!) 
 
What I do is to unscrew the cap, remove the spring and plunger, 
reassemble, rinse clean, unscrew the cap again, and reassemble the 
'guts'. Really is quite easy, and saves the expense of a carbonator

Subject: Pickle Buckets & Bottle Fillers


Ed writes about pickle buckets: 
 
>Has anyone brewed a pickle beer? 
>Sounds kind of sick.  What should I use to clean these things? 
 
Unless you're really broke, I'd use the pickle buckets for 
garbage/gardening/whatever, and go find yourself some really nice buckets 
from a bakery. They usually give them a way for nothing, and you get 
buckets that don't smell. They use them for storing eggs, frosting, et 
cetera... The bigger the bakery, the bigger the buckets. You could even 
get 55 gal. HDPE drums, if you're so inclined.

Now I've got a question:  I'd like to know more about counter-pressure 
bottle fillers. What's the cost, what equipment do I need, and what 
skills are required? I've been bottling the old-fashion way, but I will 
need to force carbonate a still cider in a couple of weeks. Kegging won't 
do, since I can't finish 5 gallons of hard cider at once. Besides, 
bottles are convenient for giving away at the hollidays.

Subject: BTU to Watt


Hi all 
 
Can somebody please help me in converting BTU to watt. 
Say if I have a 30000 BTU burner and I want to replace it with a 
electric element, how can I work out what the Watt rating of the 
element should be ? 
(Assuming I want to to get the liquid to the same temp in the same 
time interval) 
 
Thank you very much.

Subject: BS on HBD


I have tried posting this several times, and it keeps getting lost.  Maybe 
it's becoming one of those dreaded "none" messages.  (BTW, does anyone know 
what that's all about?)  Anyway, here it goes again.  If the others make it 
through, I apologize for the repeat. 
 
I agree with those who think that too much of a good thing can turn into a 
bad thing.  Last Friday we had three posts.  I know it was light over the 
weekend, but now we're back to multiple posts.  Let's try to limit 
discussion to questions/answers/comments on making better beer, and dispense 
with the extraneous BS.  Following are a few guidelines, in no partucular 
order, which I'm sure others can expand upon: 
 
Don't waste bandwidth bashing AHA, AOB, Charlie P., Karen B., etc. - take it 
to the recently established newsgroup alt.beer.hateaha. If you've been a 
member of the AHA, and are quitting, don't tell me - I don't care.  (Don't 
praise them either - take it to alt.beer.loveaha.) 
 
Don't attack the character of fellow HBDers.  It hurts them, and demeans 
you.  However, don't hold back if someone suggests something that's flat out 
wrong (make sure you're right!), dangerous, or just plain stupid. 
 
Don't worry about the occasional sarcastic wisecrack; most of us enjoy that 
type of humor.  But remember, this is a beer forum, not a joke forum. 
 
If you're traveling out of town and want to know where the good beer bars 
are, use the yellow pages.  There are also some good pubcrawler guides on 
the WWW - try the Real Beer Page (http://realbeer.com).  Also, don't share a 
recently completed out-of-town pub crawl with the rest of us.  I realize 
that the beer and the barmaid may have been fantastic, but chances are few 
of us will ever be near the places you just visited.  Discussions involving 
commercial beer are fine, but only if they add to discussions about homebrew. 
 
Keep signature lines to a minimum.  A line or two of an amusing quote is 
fine, but ten lines get old quickly.  Also, lose the little guys climbing up 
the page and the star-bordered, 12-line address boxes. 
 
If you are just starting out, and looking for very basic information, don't 
limit yourself to the instructions that came with your first beer kit - get 
a book (or two). Most major bookstores are now carrying books on homebrewing 
in the food and cooking section. I'm not trying to discourage newbies from 
asking "dumb" questions, just trying to help you ask better questions. 
 
Freely share your questions/answers/comments/experiences on malt, hops, 
yeast, equipment, process, books, etc., etc., etc.  That is what HBD is all 
about - brewers helping brewers make better beer.

I have to join the response to Charles Burns' post: 
 
This past Friday, I had the distinct pleasure of fighting 
traffic and a downpour to visit the U.S. Border Cantina in 
Alpharetta (just north of town).  It was the inaugural 'Firkin 
Friday' featuring a cask-conditioned American IPA served 'from 
the wood' (or the steel, rather) by beer engine. I can't say 
I've ever experienced the 'Wall of Hops,' but this was pretty 
close. And it made an excellent companion to the spicy salsa and 
chicken with mole poblano. 
 
As for Buckhead (or Butthead, depending on your viewpoint), 
unless I have some extremely good reason to go, I avoid it like 
the plague. The a:l ratio is too high (that's a**hole to laid 
back ratio), and paying $5 just for the privilege of parking is 
ludicrous.

Subject: Guiness and blood clots


Greetings, 
 
The following article came from Eating Well magazine Nov/Dec issue. 
I think brewers may find it informative. Copied verbatim. 
 
          "Tastes Grrreat, Less Clotting" 
 
"Some canine recruits have done their part to show that moderate drinking 
is good for the heart. Researchers found that dogs fed dark beer, specifically 
Guiness Extra Stout, experienced fewer blood clots than those fed lighter 
beers such as Heineken lager. 
 
Previous health studies have shown that moderate drinking can lower heart- 
disease risk by as much as 40 percent in two ways. The alcohol in beer, 
wine and spirits raises the good HDL cholesterol and also inhibits 
platelet activity, reducing the formation of blood clots. 
 
Some researchers believe that red wine offers the best protection of all 
because it contains pigments called flavonoids, which prevent blood clots 
even further. But University of Wisconsin cardiac researcher John Folts, 
a specialist in the stickiness of blood platelets, decided to test dark beer's 
anti-clotting effect because it, too, is colored by flavonoids. Sure enough, 
clot formation was eliminated completely in dogs given the rich, malty brew, 
but not in dogs given Heineken. 
 
Could a Guiness/Beaujolais showdown be far off?"   end quote. 
 
There you have it!!! one more for the brew team!! 
 
Enjoy,

Subject: Safety and a Counter-Pressure Filler web page


Re: safety 
 
I'll chime in briefly to state that safety is certainly an issue 
homebrewers need to be aware of at all times.  I recently suffered a 
fairly major second-degree burn to my arm, the result of careless 
handling of boiling water.  I was cleaning out my converted keg system 
by boiling some water and was pumping the water to a bucket for disposal 
when the hose slipped and sprayed my left forearm with boiling water. 
This, as you might guess, was quite painful and has left me with a scar 
about the size of your hand, although the doctor says it should heal up 
fine in the next few months.  It certainly got my attention, however, 
and I urge everyone to pay attention to what you're doing to avoid this 
kind of accident. 
 
On a totally unrelated note, I've crafted yet another new web page to 
add to my "Homebrew Gadgets" site - this one describes in detail how to 
build a counter-pressure bottle filler for all you keggers who'd like to 
bottle once in a while.  The design is based on Dion Hollenbeck's 
description of the filler made by Foxx Equipment Co. and is fairly 
simple to make from readily available parts.

Subject: Re: Vessel Sizes/Brewing Safe....


 for sizes of brewkettles, the normal head space is anywhere from 
20 to 30%, it depends on how "rocking" the boil is.  most homebrewers 
do overpower the kettles so more head space.  if you can watch 
the kettle (it will never boil:) and skim the "crap" less head space 
would be required, but again when the hops are added (mostly pellets) 
the foam will build up again.  some commercial brewers with totally 
enclosed kettles boil up the stack or so i have heard. 
 
for fermenters, 20 % is a good figure. again it will depend on yeast strain 
and how warm a ferment you do.  there are products out on the market that 
cap the foam to a lower level to get more out oof the fermenter. 
 i wont get into the aspects of blowby/blowoff good or bad....i have a fairly 
large blowoff, and for me it works, but it has been rumored that if you 
do not blowoff, you "can" get better system utilization of the hop.... 
 
 
on the brewer accident rob moline posted, this is exactly the reason 
why those friggin cheapo hoses with the banded on  couplings should 
NEVER be used in a pressure situation (pump out let).  the only hose 
you as a commercial brewer should use, is perm ends....it really is the only 
sanitary and safe way.  so all you commercial brewers to be - i would suggest 
you put "good/safe" hose in the budget.  they do not cost that much more, 
and alot of the vendors out there offer them - get them why take 
a chance... most of the hose ends are tested after being coupled to the 
pressure of the hose, and the company will warrant the hose/coupling. 
 
i have seen some pretty crappy hose being used, stuff i would not even run 
water thru, all because "ohhh those hoses are expensive", my response 
is ohh people are replaceable.......BS....it just pisses me off - sorry... 
 
well enough of the ranting, brew on

Subject: No-Sparge Archi-RIMS


David Hill proposes an interesting idea for a no-sparge system which is like 
a Zapap double-bucket masher with the now-famous Aussie Archi-RIMS pump 
setup.  Once the mash is over, the inner bucket is lifted out, so that the 
wort drains into the second vessel, which then is used as a boiler.  He asked 
for comments on the system. 
 
While the pump ought to set the grain bed & create clear wort in the usual 
RIMS fashion, I'd be afraid of the lifting process "undoing" the work.  If 
the bucket were lifted too quickly or "unevenly", the suddenly-increased 
"flow rate" of the wort through the grain bed could disturb it to the point 
where chunks of grain, flour, and husk were tranferred into the boiler, which 
would potentially lead to astringent, starch-hazed beer. 
 
*IF* the lifting were done veeeerrrry slooooowly, so that the overall flow 
rate was less than or equal to the pump recirc rate, this problem could 
perhaps be avoided, but I'm afraid that would require some mechanized process 
to regulate the speed.  A motorized/geared lift running very slowly (perhaps 
less than one inch {2.54 cm} per minute?) might actually work.

Subject: Stuck Sparge...


These questions are aimed mainly at those of you that mash and lauter in 
seperate vessels...(However, all comments are welcome)  This weekend I was 
brewing an all grain ESB and managed to get the ultimate in stuck 
sparges... 
 
First the setup: Mash/Lauter Tun - 10 gallon GOTT cooler with a Phil's 
Phalse Bottom...13Gallon Stainless Kettle for Boiling, bottling bucket for 
Hot Liquor Tank (waiting for 15 gallon Stainless kettle) Gravity fed 
system... 
 
The recipe: (comments welcome - my score sheets haven't come back yet) 
10 lbs British 2Row Pale Ale 
1 lb British Medium Crystal (50/60L) 
1 lb Belgian CaraPils 
1 lb Belgian Wheat 
 
1oz Fuggles `at` 60 - Pellets 
1oz EKG `at` 60 - Pellets 
 
0.5 oz Fuggles `at` 10 - Pellets 
0.5 oz EKG `at` 10 - Pellets 
 
0.5 oz Fuggles `at` 0 - Pellets 
0.5 oz EKG `at` 0 - Pellets 
 
WYeast 1275 - Slow to start in smack pack - great in starter (500 ml 
slurry) 
 
Procedure: 
 Mash In: Strike Temp 165F - 2.75 Gallons H2O 
   Rest Temp 156F (I question this temp - I let it stabalize 
for 5 minutes before reading) 
   Rest Temp (after 30 minutes and for the remainder of the 
mash) 150F 
   Mashed for 2 hours 
 Mash Out: Strike Temp  212F (boiling water at sea level) - 2 gallons 
    Rest Temp 166F (Closer than in the past to the 168 target) 
 
 The stuck sparge/scoop/mess goes here.... 
 
 Boil with hop additions listed above 
 
 Immersion chiller added with second hop addition (cold water enters 
top and coils clockwise :-)) 
  
Original Gravity: 1.041 `at` 60F - I usually get 1.053 from this beer... 
 
I have brewed this beer 4 times previous to this with no problems.... 
I got ready to sparge the grains and I opened the valve to start the 
recirculation and got absolutely no flow from the tun...  Not even a drop 
went down the tubing...!!! 
 
I scooped the grains into other coolers that I had and fixed the false 
bottom (the plastic tubing connecting the false bottom and the copper exit 
tube had kinked and collapsed).  I tehn scooped the grains back into the 
GOTT cooler.  My question about this method is how do I do it "quietly", if 
I need to do this again? The other question is what effect with this have 
on the flavor of the beer.  I am looking to keep this beer in primary 
(plastic - in case you wanted to know) 4 days and then rack to secondary 
(glass) for 1 week.  I will then bottle and age until December 7 - Seasonal 
Party Time (excuse me I meant - Seasonal Organized Tasting Event). 
 
Any comments on the recipe and/or procedures will be appreciated... 
 
Thanks

I've seen a couple of other responses on this, so I'll keep it brief.  If 
you want the original postulation on this, check out the The Brewery. 
 George Fix wrote an article on this.  Actually, it was a pretty short 
article.

As I recall Dr. Fix's article (supported by his own experience, no doubt) 
was that you leave about 30% of the extract.  Or stated another way, you 
need 30% more grain to get the same OG.  So, you're probably talking more 
like 10 pts of extract lost.  Even so, for a 5 gal batch the cost increase 
is only about $2- assuming %.60 per lb of grain times ~3 lbs. 
 
Here is another potential benefit to the no-sparge technique that I've been 
considering.  My water is very high in carbonates.  I'm at risk for tannin 
extraction/astringency due to pH rising during the sparge.  While I do 
acidify the sparge water (and sometimes the mash, depending on grain bill), 
I'm still wondering if the carbonates are affecting the taste of my beers in 
perhaps subtle ways that acidifying doesn't cure.  I'm pretty sure that it 
does, but I don't know how. 
 
I've haven't tried this yet, but it's high on the list of new things to try. 
 As soon as I can get my RIMS set-up finished.  Anybody care to hazard a 
guess on how a RIMS-no-sparge beer would taste?????
