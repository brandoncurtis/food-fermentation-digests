Subject: The Price of Beer in Utah


My apologies if this is a tad off the subject of homebrewing.  Most of 
us brewers, though, appreciate fine beers in general (especially 
microbrews and imports), and I felt that this would be of interest to 
most here.  Any flames should be directed through private email to me at 
jim_anderson`at`email.state.ut.us.  I'd also appreciate comparisons to 
policies of other states (once again, through private email). 
 
 * Carbon Copy: 
 * Original message to ALL on the State of Utah Online Service 
 
I have received a response to my email to Governor Leavitt regarding 
beer markups in Utah.  It came from Kenneth F. Wynn, Director of the 
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.  Rather than providing me with 
the cost breakdown that I desired, he stated simply that, "By law, a 
minimum markup, a school lunch tax [???], a sales tax, and in the case 
of beer, a beer tax is applied to the landed case cost to the state.  A 
delivery cost per case is also applied to reach the final retail price." 
 
In an attempt to get specific costs regarding a case of Pilsner Urquell, 
I called his office.  His secretary (Claire) told me that she would get 
me this information next week.  I also asked about pertinent Utah Code, 
and she directed me to Title 32A.  This is where things start to 
fascinate me: 
 
Section 32A-1-103 references protection of [get THIS] - yes, MORALS! 
(Conclusion: you can lack morals in Utah, but it's gonna cost ya!) 
 
Section 32A-1-122 is right at the heart of the matter: "Except as 
provided in Subsections (2) and (3), all liquor sold within the state 
shall be marked up in an amount not less than 61% above the cost to the 
department, excluding federal excise taxes." 
 
A 61% MARKUP!  And that doesn't include the other various and sundry 
taxes and costs .... I can't wait to see how *they* add up. 
 
Section 32A-8-101 says that homebrewing is a class B misdemeanor. 
 
Section 32A-10-101 provides for additional "local" taxes. 
 
Section 32A-14-101 ("Dramshop Act") provides that "ANY PERSON" providing 
alcoholic beverages to others can be liable for their subsequent 
actions.  Not just businesses ... ANYBODY!  (The online version notes 
that this section will be superseded on 7/1/97, but it doesn't provide 
the new language.) 
 
Regarding this latter provision, how about a little help here?  About a 
month or two ago I heard that the Utah Supreme Court was going to make a 
ruling regarding whether the Dramshop Act actually applied to us 
individual Joe Blow's.  But I never heard the result.  Could it be that 
this ruling has something to do with the 7/1/97 revision?  Can anyone 
provide me an online pointer to Utah Supreme Court decisions? 
 
Okay, maybe I'm boring you to tears -- I understand that most people 
here (representative, perhaps, of the general population of Utah) don't 
indulge in alcoholic beverages.  But try to look at it from my point of 
view -- I happen to receive great satisfaction from trying out different 
beers from all over the world -- some might call me a connoisseur. 
Indeed, it's a (yes, legitimate) hobby of mine.  For a moment, then, put 
the shoe on the other foot.  How would you like it if the Great State of 
Utah put a 61%+ levy on the foods and hobbies that *YOU* enjoy?  Maybe 
by putting a 61% surcharge on that lobster you had at a restaurant?  Or 
by putting a 61% surcharge on lift tickets, for instance? 
 
Many nations (properly, in my opinion) statutorily designate beer as a 
FOOD item.  How would you like it if, on your next $100 expenditure at 
Smith's or Albertson's, a state official walked up and said, "I'll take 
another $61, please?" 
 
I am outraged by this, folks.  Whether the State of Utah is protecting 
my morals or its own bottom line, this is unconscionable in my book. 
 
So concludes (for the moment, anyway) Jim's Soapbox Subject of the Day.

Subject: CF CHiller cleaning/sanitizing


One of the annoying things about my homemade CF chiller is getting the wort 
or sanitizer or cleaning fluid flowing in the first place.  Here's a useful 
trick for starting the flow, at least for keggers. 
 
Grab an extra corny keg and fill it with iodophor mixed to your favorite 
concentration.  Lightly pressurize with CO2.  Hook up the liquid fitting 
with the picnic tap.  The picnic tap (mine, at least) fits quite well over 
3/8" copper refrigeration tubing.  Run iodophor under pressure through the 
(already cleaned!) tubing.  Stick a 000 stopper into the copper tubing and 
let the iodophor sit for 10-15 minutes while you get ready to chill the 
wort.  Hook the chiller to the kettle, turn the water on, and run out the 
iodophor into a bucket.  When wort starts coming out of the chiller replace 
bucket with fermentor. 
 
A corny w/iodophor is also useful for running beer out of your tap line when 
you're done drinking for the day.

A friend of mine who *does* know about thermal xfer reccomends throttling 
the flow speed to maintain max output temp. (==Most efficient/least water use).
 
Common wisdom on the HBD seems to be run at full throttle checking the temp 
of the wort every so often.

Subject: No/Low Sparge Brewing Experiment results


Having noted a number of posts on the HBD recently regarding no-sparge 
brewing,  I decided to give it a try.  Unable to bear the prospect of 
losing ALL those nice sugars,  however,  I decided to take a low 
sparge approach.  I took a standard Oktoberfest recipe for 6 gallons 
and scaled up the grain bill as follows: 
 
4 lbs vienna 
4 lbs munich 
10 oz aromatic 
10 oz med caramel 
 
this was all multipled by about 3/2  (I think Dr. Fix may recommend 
4/3) to yield the following grain bill: 
 
6 lbs vienna 
6 lbs caramel 
1 lb aromatic 
1lb munich 
 
I doughed in with 5 gallons water (about 1.4 quarts/lb ).  Protein 
rest at 122F (20 mins) and sacc. rest at 152 F (1 hour,  30 mins). 
 
Prior to mashout I added an additional gallon of water to the mash. 
The amount chosen was arbitrary and I suppose you could just as well 
add more.  The idea was to get some additional sugars from the grain 
without having to trouble with an actual sparge. 
 
I then brought the whole thing up to mashout temp (about 168 F) and 
let rest for 15 minutes. 
 
I use an EasyMasher (tm) in a stainless pot,  so I recirculated a 
couple of cups -- as I usually would when sparging -- to get a clear 
runnoff.  I then opened up the spigot and drained the whole thing into 
my boiler without adding any additional sparge water. 
 
I managed to collect about 3.75 gallons of wort at SG 1.076.  This 
translates to roughly 20.4 points/pound of grain,  not terrible 
considering that there was no sparging.  This cut a good hour of 
sparge/sparge preparation time from my brewday.  I _would_ like to 
know where the other 2.25 gallons of water went.  I assume a small 
amount was due to evaporative losses,  and the rest was held in the 
grain bed.  It would have been nice to recover some of that water (I 
start with very neutral bottled water and add the appropriate salts). 
The runnoff stage still takes time,  but requires no attention,  since 
there is no need to hang around adding sparge water (I do not have an 
automated sparge water delivery system). 
 
Anyway,  I added the remainder of my brew-water to the collected wort. 
boiled,  cooled and pitched as usual. 
 
In summary,  I felt the time savings involved here was definitely 
worth the price of the extra grain,  and I'll probably continue to use 
this method for my standard gravity brews.  I'll also probably try 
adding 2 gallons at mashout next time.

I _really_ must proof things more carefully prior to sending them. 
The low/sparge grain bill multipled 3/2 should read:

1 lb caramel

Subject: Corn as an adjunct


Calling all Brewers, 
 
This weekend I was cleaning out the garden, and I still have a lot of old ears 
of corn left on the stalks. It's too old
to eat so I was thinking about fermenting it in my next batch of beer. I know 
there was a long string going on about
this for a while but I thought it dealt mostly with blue corn. 
I was going to use some 6-row and put the dried kernels into the mash without 
the cob. Do I need to
modify the corn in anyway? Should I try to malt the corn, or boil it first? Do 
I need to crack the kernels before I add
them to the mash?  Any other ideas? 
 I'll be brewing this weekend so any help is appreciated, E-Mails are fine. 
 
Thanks, 
 
Matt Taylor

Subject: Maris Otter malt


I seem to recall a few people asking about Maris Otter lately. The following 
is some marketing stuff I picked up at my local HB supply shop. FYI. 
 
- - Jerry Cunningham 
  Annapolis, MD 
 
****************** 
 
Maris Otter barley has been grown in England since the mid '60's, when it 
was selected to meet the needs of the brewing industry of the time. It was 
quickly recognised for its excellent malt and for many years was the only 
winter barley to be approved by The Institute of Brewers. Today it is 
specially grown and is the mainstay of the flourishing English regional and 
micro-brewing network who seek to maintain the traditional taste of beer. 
 
Breeding a traditional calssic 
This two row variety was bred by Dr. G. D. H. Bell and his team at 
Cambridge. By crossing the established spring malting barley, Proctor, with 
the winter variety, Pioneer, Maris Otter was endowed with the malt 
characteristics of a spring barley together with winter hardiness. This 
commercial breakthrough allowed farmers to sow a more reliable crop with a 
valuable market use. 
 
Quality Performance 
>From the beginning Maris Otter demonstrated its consistency, season upon 
season producing grain with low nitrogen levels, as well as a uniquely 
reliable performance in both maltings and most importantly in the brewhouse. 
So much so that the extra cost required to preserve supplies is accepted by 
premium brewers who trust Maris Otter to brew and ferment well, producing a 
bright clean tasting full-bodied beer. 
 
Grown on the best soils 
Nowadays, Maris Otter is grown by selected farmers, recognised for their 
craft as barley growers and who farm on the best barley ground in England. 
These chalk based soils, which stretch from Dorset in the south, along the 
ancient Icknield Way through Cambridgeshire, to the Norfolk coast, combine 
with a maritime climate to produce barley of worldwide renown. 
 
Widely available 
Maris Otter malt is available to all brewers large and small. Many UK 
maltsters from the smallest craft type with traditional floor maltings and 
natural draught kilns to those factories using the most modern techniques, 
produce Maris Otter malt to a wide range of specifications. 
 
Consumer interest 
With the increasing consumer awareness of the raw materials used in the 
beers they drink and the support of organisations like UK CAMRA (Campaign 
for Real Ale), Maris Otter is recognised as the heart of a superb beer.

alt in german means "old", and it does not necessarily imply that the beer is 
an altbier.  if it is a premium bavarian beer, i would say chances are it's 
not an altbier, as altbiers originated and are traditional to the dusseldorf 
region of germany, which is not bavaria.  bavaria is more known for lagers 
and wheat beers (altbier is an ale). 
 
there is a munich dunkel (outstanding) brewed by ayinger (bavaria), and the 
word "altbayerisch" appears on the label.  (old bavarian).  i'm not sure 
what altenmunoter is translated as, despite my year of german lessons. 
 
a beer question!  i use an immersion chiller and agitate it in the kettle 
by hand.  at the end of the chilling, i transfer the wort to a 7 gallon 
fermenter, pitch, wait a number of hours, and then rack off the trub. 
 
 
what is the best way to get the wort from the kettle to the fermenter without 
transferring the trub?  i realize i'll have to let it settle a while. 
should i whirlpool and then use a copper cane/choreboy setup?  how much 
trub gets in the fermenter using this method?  any secrets/pitfalls to this 
method?  is there another method? 
 
 
also, does anyone have a source for an inline sterile air filter, and also 
an inline carbon filter.  i'm constructing an aerator.  any pointers would

speaking of aeration, why didn't the recent bt article on aeration mention

Subject: sanitizing corks/chlorine/enzymes/tannins/more enzymes


There appears to be a problem with the digested version of the HBD. 
I must appologize to the readers of the undigested version who will 
(I assume) be reading this again, but this never made it into the 
digested version and I suspect it was one of the [none] messages. 
 
Kevin writes:

Although mead, wine, etc. are very high in alcohol and therefore the risk 
of infection from stay bacteria/yeasts on the cork are very low, you may 
want to do what I did.  I had read somewhere that soaking the corks in 
boiling water would soften them and make them easier to insert.  It would 
also kill some (if not all) of the surface microbiota.  What I did was take 
two 24-ounce thick plastic cups and poured a little boiling water into one. 
I then put in the corks, and slipped the second one inside the first.  I 
then poured hot water into the top cup till it submerged the corks.  I 
let these sit for 15 minutes while I sanitized my corker (twin lever). 
The warm corks slid into the bottles easily (I was bottling a Chimay 
clone in Chimay bottles) leaving 3/8" of the cork sticking out and then 
wired the corks down with new Champagne wires.  This soaking in boiling 
water is probably overkill, but you may want to consider it. 
 
*** 
 
Various people have written about the flavour contributions of chlorine 
in the water you use.  There were numerous posts talking about ppm of 
Chlorine and what's above the taste threshold.  I didn't notice anyone 
post regarding chlorophenolics.  These are a group of chemicals that 
are the result of chlorine reacting with something in the wort/beer 
(presumably some phenolic compound, right?).  These have been described 
as having "medicinal" or "bandaid" aromas.  I think that these are much 
more of a concern than actually smelling the chlorine itself. 
 
*** 
I appreciate Dave's kind words and will try to be less terse (which can 
sound very beligerent) and be more "friendly"... much more in the proper 
spirit of the HBD. 
 
There are still a couple of points Dave made that I would like to resolve. 
I would appreciate it if we could discuss these points.  I have not seen 
these anywhere and would like references if possible: 
 
1) that in a low-calcium environment you would get "poor efficiency and a 
   more fermentable wort than expected because the alpha amylase is less 
   stable than in a higher calcium environment.  Ergo, efficiency suffers 
   if the alpha amylase disappears before the starch is completely converted 
   to soluble carbohydrates." 
 
2) "Most true Pilzens use a lager malt low in husk tannins..." 
 
3) "They [malts] will slowly lose their enzymatic powers, but it will 
    take several years, based on my personal experience." 
 
I agree with the first sentence in 1, but the second sentence and all 
of 2 are news to me.  3 is counter to my experience: I store my malts 
either in vacuum-sealed 6-mil PolyEthylene bags or HDPE buckets 
with gasketted lids.  I've found that 3-year-old malt, stored at cellar 
(55 to 65F) temperatures will convert wonderfully and give high yields. 
I have not noticed any apparent loss of enzymatic power.  I rarely, if 
ever, use high-enzyme malts -- most of the time I brew with M&F Pale 
and Mild malts and DWC or Ireks Munich.  Occasionally, I'll use DWC Pils 
and Pale Ale, Ireks Pils, and DWC or Ireks Wheat.  The only high-enzyme 
malt I've ever used is Schreier 2-row brewer's malt, which is not extremely 
high in diastatic power, but quite a bit higher than the first four I 
mentioned. 
 
How's that?  Sorry for flying off the handle... I'm really passionate 
about brewing!

I would suggest carmelizing in the microwave -- with a lot of care, 
for the stuff is *very* hot.  Read my article on sugar in Zymurgy 
for details, but any good microwave cookbook should have instructions. 
 
The key with carmelization is time -- the longer you leave it in/on 
heat, the darker it will get, but you should bear in mind that the process 
will continue until it starts to cool down.  In other words, it can 
get too dark very easily if you don't pull it off/out when it's on 
the way to that color. 
 
If you carmelize sugar the night before, it will set up pretty hard 
before you can use it.  At that point, if it's not stuck to something, 
you can simply add it to the boil.  Or carmelize it in the microwave 
while you're boiling your wort, and add it toward the end of the boil.

I use a 15 gallon kettle, which just gives me enough room to boil 
12 gallons or so without *too* much concern about boil-over.  Doesn't 
mean you don't have to watch it, especially early on in the boil. 
 
I ferment in another kettle (which doubles as my hot liquor tank), 
which began life as a Golden Gate keg (1/2 barrel).  Works very well, 
and after the krausen falls I rack to two carboys.  Previously, I 
fermented in the two carboys, which is a better solution than trying 
to lift/clean/deal with a 10 gallon carboy, if they exist. 
 
Ditto bottling.  I follow the same procedure as for 5 gallons, just 
do it twice.  Or bottle half and keg the other half.  Or, most likely, 
keg it all. 
 
I *could* do it in the kettle, and simply double the priming sugar; 
no reason why it wouldn't work just fine.

Subject: all-grain #2


 
HBD'ers, 
 
Friday I did my second batch of all-grain.  I used a nearly identical 
recipe (only yeast was different) but the experience was mucho different 
that my first batch: 
 
1) the mash temp was kept between 144 and 152 for 90 minutes; 
2) i made a huge mess; 
3) i forgot to take an OG reading, doh!; 
4) i decided to do a secondary ferment this time. 
 
 
Questions: 
 
When are you supposed to stop sparging?  I could've kept sparging 
all night.  I quit after the gravity dropped down to 1.02ish and 
I had about 1/2 gallon more than the volume I was shooting for 
(it evaporated as planned in the boil). 
 
Do I need to crush grains like Crystal/Munich/Chocolate Malt before 
mashing? 
 
Thanks for the tips everyone, 
 
 
Barry

"David R. Burley" <103164.3202`at`CompuServe.COM> asks about Chempro SDP 
 
That seems to be quite popular here in the UK but I would warn that it 
contains a cleaner as well as a sterilizer 
and therefore needs to be rinsed out after use.  I have read that tap 
water is fine, being chlorinated.  Most of the 
time though I use a Sodium Metabisulphate solution which doesn't have to 
be rinsed out. (unless you want to 
satisfy the Reinheitsgbot, I guess) but do make sure you empty it all as 
well as you can or you'll get a taste of it 
in your beer. 
 
Just my opinion, YMMV etc etc

Subject: Priming Sugar Equivalents


I chatted with some nice folks at Lagunitas Brewery in 
Petaluma, CA over the weekend.  No affiliation, etc., just 
nice folks with terrific beer, hard workers, very 
knowledgeable, and willing to talk to anyone who happens to 
stop by, namely me.  That's what I like about Brewers.  Try 
to learn something from a winery ... forget it. 
 
Topic = Priming bottles.  (I know, the real solution is kegs 
+ CO2 + refrigerator + floor space = $$$) 
 
Claim by the brewer at Lagunitas = Priming with sweet wort 
is less harsh than priming with corn sugar.  I don't happen 
to have any sweet wort hanging around like they do, so I'd 
have to make it with malt syrup or dry malt extract. 
 
Question = How much?  Does anyone have a handy formula for 
priming sugar equivalents?  I currently use about 3/4 - 1 
cup corn sugar per 5 gallons.  (I know, I should be doing it 
by weight, but the measuring cup is so darned handy.) 
 
What I'm looking for is something like: 
X grams of corn sugar = Y grams (teaspoons?) of DME 
                      = Y cups (grams?) of malt extract 
                      = Y cups (grams?) of honey 
                      = Y cups (grams?) of any other 
                        sugar source. 
 
Thanks in advance.  By the way, Lagunitas prints the OG and 
IBU on their label (the only brewery I know that does that.) 
Hey, now they're talking a language that informed consumers 
can understand (rather than foo-foo marketing terminology)!

Hello HBDers, 
 I'm going to brew a mock pilsner soon.  I'm using Wyeast's 
American Ale yeast for the brew because it has a very clean character to 
it.  Does anyone have suggestions or other tips for making a lager-alike 
with an ale yeast?  Yes I'll be using the signature Saaz hops for the 
beer, but any hints and experiences would be welcomed.

While we're comparing safety-related and accident anecdotes, let me add 
another.  I have 2 small kids, and I know that since many of us are in that 
fertile child-rearing age, small kids around the brewery are fairly common. 
 I had an incident occur recently that caused me to give some careful 
consideration minimize "collateral damage" in the brewery.  Within about 10 
secs of putting a jug of diluted iodphor on the counter, my son grabbed it 
and took a swig.  Since "it looked like juice" it was easy to make that 
mistake.  Fortunately, it didn't taste at all like juice and he didn't 
really swallow much.  It really freaked momma out, and consequently dad was 
in big trouble (I felt pretty bad about it, too).  A small amount of diluted 
iodine isn't very toxic (per the poison control center and our local 
pediatrician, both of whom I immediately called).  It obviously could have 
been much worse, and it resulted in a cheap lesson.  Keep those cleaning and 
sanitizing solutions out of reach of the little ones, even if that makes it 
slightly more inconvenient for the brewer.

Subject: barley wine


Greetings brewers- 
 
I have a question regarding a batch of barley wine I have ready to bottle. 
I started this batch last April.  This was a mash/extract batch with an og 
of 1.100.  It was pitched with yeastlab American ale yeast, and fermented 
down to 1.072.  I then repitched with yeast lab sweet mead yeast, and it 
droped down only to 1.058.  Due to unavoidable circumstances, I have not 
been able to do anything to this batch since.  There has been no visible 
fermentation since August, and I need the carboy, so it is time to bottle. 
The question is, it seems that the yeast has given up.  Should I just add 
priming sugar and hope or the best, or should I repitch with another yeast 
before bottling?  I don't want flat barley wine, but I don't want to create 
a bunch of grenades either! 
 
Thanks in advance for any help. 
 
Mark 
 
A friend with mead is a friend indeed...

Subject: which burner to buy?


 
 
After brewing partial mashes for a long time I finally purchased a 
10 gallon pot and plunged into my first full-mash. I have been using 
one Phils 5-gallon-bucket Lauter-tuns for my partial mashes and also 
used it on this full-mash. I also have a 25-ft immersion chiller. I 
am going to explain some of the problems that I had in the hopes of 
helping those that are contemplating brewing their first all-grain 
batch. I also have a question for those experienced all-grainers: 
 
Problems: 
 
o Although the 5-gallon mash/lauter-tun bucket worked well for my partial 
  mashes,  it was marginal for the 12lbs of grain (plus flake) that I 
  used for this all-grain batch. Although the directions claim it is 
  big enough for 13lb of grain, I was overflowing using a standard 
  2-step infusion and had to add more mash as I drained the wort. 
  I am going to install a easy-masher in my brew-pot so I do not have 
  to worry. Another alternative would be a 10-gallon Gott. If you are 
  buying a lauter-tun for partial mashing, think further ahead and 
  spring for something that will work for full-mashing as well. 
o I was amazed how much longer it took to bring 6 gallons to a boil 
  over my gas kitchen stove compared to 3 or 4 gallons I used in 
  partial mashing. I did not want to spend the cash but I have 
  concluded a high-output gas burner is a must for all-grain brewing 
  unless you have alot of spare time. I will not brew another batch on 
  my stove. 
 
Well that was it for the problems! No big deal eh? If you are already 
doing partial mash I think a larger pot, lauter-tun, and burner 
capacity are all you need to think about. (I'll assume you already 
have a good wort chiller) 
 
My question is: 
 
Any strong recommendations for the type of burner I should get and who 
has a good deal on them? I want a good balance between control, 
output, and efficiency. I would rather spend a little more now for a 
quality product than to figure out later that I need to buy something 
else. Any strong recommendations on what NOT to buy? 
 
thanks for the advice.

Subject: CounterPressure Bottlers


Timothy SHerburne asked about Counterpressure Bottlers. 
 
Counterpressure bottle fillers (CPBF's)  are bottling devices desinged to 
work with a keg setup (or other pressurized-service arrangement), that allow 
you to prepressurize a bottle with CO2, so that beer flowing into the bottle 
is always under the same pressure as that in the keg.  This minimizes loss of 
CO2 due to the drop to atmospheric pressure as t enters the bottle. 
 
A typical CPBF has a set of valves & plumbing sitting on top of a stopper 
that fits in the bottle.  Coming out of the stopper is usually a pair of 
concentric tubes, one short one to carry CO2 into and out of the bottle, and 
another tube to send beer to the bottom of the bottle. 
 
The bottling sequence starts with purging & pressurizing the bottle.  The gas 
is then shut off and the beer valve is opened.  SInce the bottle and the keg 
are now at the same pressure, no beer flows.  Pressure is gradually bled off 
the bottle, which draws beer slowly into the bottle.  Only enough beer is 
pushed into the bottle to re-equalize the pressure, so the flow of beer is 
regulated by the relief of small amounts of pressure from the bottle 
(actually a slow steady bleed-off), and the flowing beer is under essentially 
constant (high) pressure the whole time.  When the bottle is filled, the beer 
valve is shut off, the remaining pressure is relieved, and the bottle is 
capped.  The short time that the pressure is relieved, just before capping, 
is not enough to allow significant loss of CO2 from solution... 
 
HOWEVER, inevitiably (it seems) there is foaming.  The beer goes through lots 
of tubing, and often through somewhat convoluted pathways inside the bottler 
itself.  This along with potential rapid changes in temperature while 
contacting various parts of the thing, can make the beer foam excessively. 
 Some folks chill the bottles to eliminate one more temperature shock. 
 
Another thing that peeves me about them is that they are bulky and sort of 
unwieldy, so it seems to take "three hands" to bottle.  And all the foaming 
makes a terrible mess (three bottles filled, one bottle spilled...). 
 
Zymurgy magazine did a road-test of several commercial bottlers in '95 
(summer issue?).  Things they looked for included loss of CO2 and how much O2 
is allowed into the beer.  Based on these criteria, if memory serves me, the 
best unit was a $300+ unit, with second place going to a $50 unit.  The 
simple hose from the beer tap to the bottom of a bottle routine scored sorta 
kinda OK on CO2 retention but the amount of O2 intorduced was highest of all. 
 
About the same time the "poor man's CPBF" became well-known.  This is just a 
stopper and a length of tubing crammed onto a cobra tap.  The stopper is 
forced into the bottle opening, and the tap is opened.  Beer flows for a bit 
until it displaces enough volume to pressurize the bottle to the serving 
pressure (usually between 25% to 50% of the bottle is filled by this point). 
 Then the stopper is "burped" slowly, allowing more beer to flow, much as 
with a "regular" CPBF.  If the bottle is purged with CO2 first, risk of O2 
introduciton is minimized. 
 
Problem with this approach is the inital 25% to 50% fill.  This beer often 
foams severly and loses CO2.  Its low cost & simplicity make it a favorite 
for filling bottles for parties & upcoming comeptitions, but long-term 
storage might result in undercarbonated beer. 
 
*SHAMELESS PLUG DEPARTMENT* 
 
I modified this simple device into the "Poor Man's *REAL* CPBF" by adding a 
method of pre-pressurizing the bottle.  I made anohter hole in the stopper 
and inserted an air-filler-needle  -(you know, like the ones used to pump up 
footballs).  Onto the threaded end of the needle I attached a tire valve 
(just happens to fit & seal well...Teflon tape helps too).  Now I can hold 
the bottle with one hand around the neck,thumb holding the bottler in place, 
pressurize with the other hand by using an airchuck attached to the CO2 tank, 
put down the airchuck, then open the beer valve and bleed off pressure with 
the free hand by "letting air out of the tire".  Because the beer path is 
short & direct, I get almost no foaming, even with room-temp bottles.  You 
can build this thing for $15 to $20 or even less if you have most of the 
stuff laying around (stopper, tubing, etc).
