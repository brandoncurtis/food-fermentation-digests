Why not try the 5 liter minikeg route?  It isn't a LOT cheaper than kegging 
equipment on a volume basis, but the little party kegs will fit easily into 
most
refrigerators.  You can buy the kegs new or buy Dinkel Acker and other german 
beers in these kegs. Bungs and plastic inserts can be purchased at your HB 
store
that sells the kegs. Buy the more expensive SS German -made delivery spout. I'm
told by a local HB store owner that the plastic one is a "piece of crap" and he
sent his stock back because of all the complaints. I like mine for delivering a
thick rich head of beer since the small valve gives a lot of foam. It gives 
that
"raining" effect as the foam turns to beer just like a nitrogen/CO2 Guiness 
delivery. But I wouldn't trade my cornies for them. Also, look into the use of 
ball lock, three ( rather than five) gallon cornies. Maybe if you just moved 
that roast beef and stopped buying that milk for your kids.........

David Hill asks for comments on his no sparge brewery plans. 
 
My comment -  I'll bet the bees and cows will love your sweet, spent grains. 
Your cost of malt per gallon of beer could almost double, the rated capacity of
the brewery will go down by nearly a factor of two and you could get into 
trouble with the EPA for too high of an organic load on your sewer. If sparging
takes too long why not consider Guiness' solution - a bladder operated press to
squeeze out the last drop from a very finely milled grist.  The wort is then 
probably sent to a roughing filter before the boil.

OK, third time's a charm.  I'm searching for info/resources to 
get a product called LactoCaps (?), a culture of lactobacillus 
freeze-dried and filled into gelatin capsules for ease of use. 
This is supposedly a bacterium particularly well-suited for 
making wits, and it is alleged to contain enough cell count 
to obviate the need for step-up before use. 
 
If you've used this product or seen it offered for sale anywhere, 
could you please send me an Email?  A search of HBD since '92 turned 
up no leads.  FYI this was mentioned in the 2nd most recent B.T. in 
an article on lactic acid bacteria.

Subject: No sparge method, mousies


Brewsters: 
 
In discussing "no sparge" brewing methods: 
 
> Charles Burns says: 
> 
> "In any case, your question about "how much sugar is still left" after 
> draining the grain bed is a good one." 
 
and Ken Schwartz says: 
 
>How much sugar is left behind?  Who cares?  You have what you want in the 
>kettle, so try not to weep too bitterly as you drain the remaining runoff 
>into the sink. 
 
He recommends adding 25 to 30 % more malt to the mash to make up for the loss 
in
what you throw away as a partial answer to Charlie's question, and suggests 
this
no mash technique as an intermediate stage in going from extract to all-grain. 
 
To try to get a more exact answer to Charlie's question we can do it this way.:
 
If we take 10# of malt and 2 1/2 gallons of mash liquor (1 qt/lb) and assume a 
mash will produce 11 oz of sugar per pound of malt then we have 110 oz of sugar
total ( OG of 1.065 in 5 gals). 
 
If the 10 # of malt holds one gallon of water even after it has been drained 
(according to C. Papazian), then 1/2.5 = 0.4 or 40% of the sugar is still in 
the
grains. You have a choice of brewing only three gallons of beer at a serious OG
or being satisfied with 5 gallons of  a 3.2% type beer (OG 1.035). 
 
This is a tremendous loss and I  really can't  suggest it be done as a 
continuing practice. If you want to do a "no sparge" brew, I would suggest you 
dilute the mash,during or after mashout, as much as possible by adding another 
gallon or more of water.( Ken suggests this also) This would at least only give
you a loss of 1/3.5 = 0.285 = 28.5%  You could then make a brew of 3.5 gallons 
of serious beer or 5 gallons of a "driver's choice", session beer. 
 
BTW if you sparge to 1.010 as the final sparge gravity, about 3.8 oz of sugar 
remains which would raise the OG by only about 0.002 in a 5 gallon batch if you
could somehow get it out conveniently. It is probably less than that depending 
on the  amount of  liquid you have below the false bottom. 
 
I save time by heating my sparged wort once I have clarified about a gallon and
by periodically adding freshly sparged wort to keep it below the boil. My heat 
rate is such that, as I finish the sparge ( total of about an hour or so), I'm 
just at the boil with 6.5 gallons. I also use this sparge time to clean up and 
prepare my CC cooler, etc. 
 
Why go to the time and trouble of making a brew if you're going to throw a lot 
of it away just to save a few minutes? Would you pour two gallons of your beer 
down the sink? 
- ------------------------------------------------------------ 
Rick Dante asks: 
 
>Am I doomed to having 
>determined hungry mousies gnawing through the plastic (probably at the 
>joint between the lid and the container) to get to my precious grain? 
 
In my own experience No. I have stored grain and malt in plastic garbage cans, 
Rubbermaid Roughnecks, plastic shoe storage boxes, etc. since 1980.  Living in 
the woods, I have mice from time to time and only had one problem where one 
tried to chew through the lid to a shoe box just as you described.  I got him 
before he finished, I guess. 
 
Bacon tied onto a snap trap trigger and a little peanut butter smeared on the 
bacon is a sure invitation to the Inferno.

Subject: Chimay yeast


Brewsters: 
 
P.S. Edwards and S. Murman responded to my questions on Chimay yeast and my 
puzzlement on two apparent stages to the fermentation.and I have discovered a 
passage that will be helpful in interpreting my results. 
 
Paul Edwards says that discussions with a brewer in Belgium and reading Michael
Jackson confirm that Chimay uses the same yeast for fermentation and bottle 
conditioning.   S. Murman has tried several starters, but was cautioned that 
fermenting it at too high a temperature would give too many phenols and be out 
of style. He believes that 64F is optimum. Murman typically has 64 to 70F 
fermentations lasting several weeks. 
 
I have found a passage in Pierre Rajotte's book "Belgian Ale" (Brewers Pub.) 
that says that some of the fermentations take place at as high a temperature as
85F for the first few days.  Also, he says on P.39 in describing how 
fermentation was carried out in small casks in the old days: 
 
"The brewer in charge of the fermentation would add fresh wort at regular 
intervals to replace the beer that had been lost with the outgoing yeast.  He 
knew that as long as thick yellowish yeast foam came through the bung, 
fermentation was not finished. But as soon as the foam turned white, he knew it
was over. The white foam came slowly out through the bung hole, looking like a 
cauliflower.  This was called the cauliflower stage and it was then that the 
brewer added isinglass to help in clarifying the beer and close the bung." 
 
The thick yellowish foam would describe the color of the foam in the first 
stage
of my fermentation and the white, slowly formed foam  "the cauliflower stage" 
would describe the thin layer of finely beaded white foam in the second stage I
observed with this yeast 
.. 
I racked it to a secondary on Sunday and it was very tasty and only a little 
sweet with a % reducible sugar content of 3/4 % and still actively fermenting 
in
a rolling boiling kind of fermentation with no foam.  I expect it will be done 
soon. The first three days it was fermented at about 70F and then I raised it 
to
78F at which time the production of esters became very evident.  Next time I 
will start hot.  I guesstimate that the cauliflower stage occurred at a 
fermentable sugar content higher than 2% which is high for kegging unless they 
used the porous spile method of pressure control. 
 
SInce the fermentation is still going on even after the white foam disappears, 
do you suppose it is the alcohol content somehow acting as a foam breaker that 
is the cause of this phenomenon? Really interesting. 
 
>From OG = 1.072 to finish in a week with an underpitched first-time starter. 
I'm impressed.

Greetings all. 
 
The Hampton Roads Brewing and Tasting Society (HRB&TS) will be hosting 
its 1st ever homebrew competition, "The Taming of the Brews", on February 
22, 1997.  It will be an all-British Isle style competition.  I realize 
this is a bit early for an announcement, but I'd like to give everyone 
the opportunity to start brewing for the competition.  The competition 
homepage is located at http://www.infi.net/~ridgely/hrcomp.html if you'd 
like more information.  You can also e-mail me for more information. 
 I'll post an update here closer to the competition.  Good luck and good 
brewing.

Subject: Egg drop soup?


I had a question for the collective: 
 
Brewed a brown ale over the weekend.   Everything went pretty normal (for a 
change). 
 
8# 2 row pale 
1# wheat 
1# carapils 
2oz black patent 
2 oz chocolate 
90 min boil 
2oz cascade at 45 
1oz fuggles at 15 
Irish moss at 15. 
 
Chilled to 80F and racked to carboy.  After about 3 hours, I had a very large 
batch of what appears to be brown egg drop soup.  I pitched a large volume of 
british wyeast.  Ferment took off with no problems and egg drop stuff seems to 
be settling out.  My question is what the heck is this stuff?  I know it has 
been discussed before on the digest, but trying to do a search on "white, 
slimy, egg-drop soup-like" stuff proved more than a little difficult, hence 
why I am posting here.  Any hints/suggestions.  FYI, this is not IMBR post, 
but I am curious as to what I have created.

I went through this dilemma in just the last couple of weeks. There is an 
article in a recent Brewing Techniques ( I think) that compares all those on 
the
market. Braukunst 218-384-9844 or 800-972-brau (no affil.,etc) wins hands down.
I also got an article on a build your own.  When I had the same experience as 
another HBDer with Braukunst's phone answerback -i.e. none, I thought.  I 
proceeded to build my own. It took quite a number of stops at various plumber's
suppliers, hobby shops and hardware stores to get all the connections. If you 
can't find a #2 stopper with a 3/8 hole - don't start.  Luckily a HB store in 
the area had one. 
 
In summary, it was a lot of work and the cost just about the same as if I had 
purchased one already assembled. The Braukunst with specially machined parts 
has
less metal, fewer nooks and crannies and will be easier to clean. Also all 
hoses,"t" connectors etc. are provided. I would make a minor modification which
will allow me to fill tall (quarts) and short (12 oz) bottles. I made these 
changes on the one I built.  If you want to know, e-mail me. The only skill 
required is three hands!  I'm trying to think of a way to support it so it is 
easier to use.  Any ideas? 
 
The day after I finished my do it yourself version, I got a Braukunst catalog! 
Obviously they will send out a catalog, but won't call back for an order. At a 
surprise birthday party (35 attendees and bye-bye Roasted Oatmeal Porter and 
wine) for me, the following day, my buddies gave me a CP bottle filler from 
Braukunst  as a gift!  When it rains...  Now I know why my wife wanted to buy 
the CP filler for me for Christmas.  I said no because, like you, I wanted to 
bottle some for gifts. Well, its nice to have a backup I guess or maybe a 
whazzit? bar decoration.

That depends.  BTU is energy and Watts is energy/time.  Assuming that your 
burner is rated on an hourly output (like my cajun cooker is), then since 1 
W = 3.41212 BTU/hr, 30,000 BTU = 8792 W.

RE: the general yeast-repitching thread: 
 
As promised, I kegged a pale ale on saturday, leaving just a touch of beer 
over the yeast (Wyeast London)  in the bottom of my secondary.  I filled the 
secondary with CO2, and put an airlock on it.  I brewed a Porter on Sunday 
(OG 1064, ok, it's probably a stout) during a party, where I served the 
force carbonated pale ale (review, great beer, but could stand a little 
aging). I poured the chilled porter wort on the yeast in the fermenter about 
6PM last night.  As of 6AM this morning, fermentation was going great guns, 
at a rate usually apparent with this yeast in this beer at around 24-36 
hours after pitching.  I believe  I finally pitched a decent population 
 
This looks like it works great, folks.  Thanks for the tip.

Subject: Congradulations to the HBD (almost)


Hi all! 
 
    I just finished reading HBD 2262 and I almost had to shout out loud 
    with joy, we almost got the S/N to zero, there were no [none]'s 
    and all but one posting was beer related, almost zero personal 
    bashings, little politics (and so close to US election day!) and all the 
    questions actually related to brewing, what a refreshing change! 
    I guess I can forgive the one non-brewing post as we need something 
    to remind us that not everything is skittles and beer (what the heck 
    are skittles anyway, I mean the saying predates the candy by that 
    name?). 
 
    In response to Eugene's post about a mock pilsner I would sugest that 
    he consider using the Wyeast 2112 (California common) yeast in the 
    project and may try using the carboy in a pan of water with a towel 
    around it (evaporative cooling) to hit a low room temperature 
    fermentation.  Several posts in the past have indicated that there 
    are comercial micro's that use this yeast for all of their brews, 
    ales and lagers.  Just an idea.

Subject: BTU to Watt


Braam Greyling asks how to convert BTU to Watt. The BTU is a unit of 
energy and the Watt is a unit of power (ie energy/unit time) and so are 
not directly equivalent. I assume you mean the conversion from 1 BTU/hr to 
watts which is .293 (1 BTU/hr times 0.293 = Watts). A 30,000 BTU/hr 
burner would be equal to 8.8 kW. 
 
Hope this helps.

Well it didn't outright say that your yeast would kick, although there was 
a clear implication in the article that it's easy to over-aerate your wort 
with pure oxygen. Apparently the "dangers" of under-aeration are so 
obvious that he didn't bother to ferment the worts that didn't achieve DO 
levels to his satisfaction. 
 
It's a very interesting subject which I'm paying close attention to, but 
frankly I also maintain a slightly cynical edge about the usefulness of 
hi-tech aeration techniques. I've observed that many homebrewers, 
including even the most technically- or scientifically-oriented, are far 
from rigorous about ensuring that they've reached a valid conclusion 
before evangelizing it (relax, don't worry, buy an O2 tank). 
 
It did not help my confidence level that the author identified two common 
strains of bacteria as yeast, and described oxygen as a catalyst in fires.

Following on from Dave Burley's recent post on using a Carbonator on a plastic 
soda bottle to wash his beer gun, I would like to share my gadget with the 
collective. 
 
Here in Down Under (or "across" for our South American and African friends), we
seem to have two different types of fittings on our Corny kegs.  Those on the 
larger 23 litre tanks use a standard 1/2" pipe thread, and I have used these 
with a stainless steel "T" fitting and ball valve to produce a handy cleaning 
and CO2 purging device. 
 
In two sides of the "T" I screwed one gas and one liquid keg fitting, and put 
the ball valve on the third using a suitable nipple.  A hose barb on the other 
side of the valve allows various hoses to be easily slipped on as required. 
 
This device allows me to push a hose connected to the hot water tap on the barb
and snap my beer gun on the liquid fitting to flush it out.  Turning off the 
ball valve and connecting the gas hose to the fitting lets you dry the beer 
line and gun with CO2. 
 
Removing the gun and opening the ball valve allows you connect your siphon 
hoses to purge any fermeter, keg etc with CO2. 
 
Just my $0.02 worth (or $A0.03), any questions or comments will be fine by 
eMail.

Here's my 2 bits on the effect of calcium. 
 
For 2 years, I brewed with r/o water with no added salts.  Calcium level 
was essentially nil.  I observed good efficiencys using a 1 hour mashs 
at 155-156F, with reasonable attenuations. 
 
When I started adding in gypsum to get 50-100 ppm Ca, my conversion 
efficiency was the same, but attenuation went way down.  I had to drop 
my mash temperature to 150-152F to get the attenuation I was used to. 
 
I take this as support for more fermentability in low calcium worts, but 
I don't see any effect on overall efficiency. 
 
I think that once I started adding calcium, alpha amylase played a 
bigger role in my conversion, so that I had to drop the mash temperature 
to allow beta to compete.  In the low calcium mashes, beta dominated 
even at high temperatures due to poor stability of the alpha amylase.

I doubt he said that. Maximum output temperature is approached as the 
coolant flow approaches 0 whence the heat trasferred out of the wort is the 
minimum i.e. the amount required to warm 1 chillerful of coolant. The only 
way to be more efficient by this definition is not to use the chiller at 
all (0 water use is less than one chillerful). 
 
If most efficient is defined as getting the wort as cold as possible (i.e. 
to the temperature of the coolant) then the fastest flow possible (short of 
that which will cause heating due to friction/shear in the coolant channel) 
is desireable though for practical purposes the flow should be limited to 
that which gets the wort to within a degree or so of the coolant 
temperature. Large increases in the flow rate are necessary to get these 
last fractions of a degree and are wasteful of water. Note that heat 
exchanger water used to mash another brew or to fill the washing machine or 
to water the garden or to wash the dog or recirculated over ice or put to 
any of the other inovative uses which have been posted here from time to 
time is not wasted.

Mark Bayer asked why brewers aren't cautioned about over oxygenation 
killing yeast. The reason is that you would have to work pretty hard to 
establish and maintain a high enough oxygen level to do this. I really 
don't know what level of exposure and time period would be required to harm 
yeast but toxicity in humans begins only after hours of exposure at partial 
pressures of 0.6 atmosphere. Yeast cells and human cells are amazingly 
similar so let's use that number for lack of a better one recognizing that 
we will doubtless offend the religious right and the physiologists. This 
would be about 300% saturation in wort which can be established by running 
oxygen through an airstone for an extended period but as soon as the 
airstone is turned off two things begin to happen. First the yeast begin to 
consume the oxygen and the partial pressure goes down and second, unless 
the container is sealed, oxygen escapes to the air (trying to establish 
equilibrium with it at 100%) and the partial pressure goes down. Yeast will 
scavenge oxygen amazingly fast and of course the more of it they can get 
the faster they will grow given that the other things they need are 
available. In a properly pitched wort there should be enough yeast cells 
present to consume oxygen at several hundred percent saturation within an 
hour or so. 
 
To kill your yeast seal the brew in a cornelius keg and apply oxygen 
pressure through a regulator at a couple of atmospheres. I don't know how 
much pressure woulf be required but it would make an interesting 
experiment. Note that even if the yeast survived the beer would taste 
horrible.

Subject: Wyeast 1007 question


     Hi all! 
 
     I have a question about Wyeast 1007 (German ale).  I am using this 
     yeast for the first time (beer is fermenting even as this is being 
     written), and have noticed that it is cranking out ENORMOUS quantities 
     of H2S (hydrogen sulfide, smells like rotten eggs). 
 
     I have never used an ale yeast that has done this before, but know 
     that many German lager yeasts do. 
 
     What's the deal?  Is this normal for 1007 or did Wyeast mislabel the 
     package? 
 
     I know Jim would chastise me for using it at all, and is now shaking 
     his head and chuckling (especially if it is a mislabeled yeast), but I 
     never had a problem (that I knew of) before this!

     Howdy! 
 
     Somebody in #2262 mentions that it took a long time to get 6 gallons 
     of wort to a boil on their stove top.  They therefore feel it is 
     necessary to purchase a propane burner to do full wort boils. 
 
     Actually, it isn't.  Just buy a pot that fits over two burners on your 
     stove.  Most department stores sell large enamelware pots that fit 
     this bill for ~$40. 
 
     It is dangerous to run a propane burner indoors (unless you have a 
     super-duper exhaust system), and some people don't like to brew 
     outdoors in January. 
 
     I boil 12-14 gallons on my stove top, and it only takes ~1 hour (maybe 
     1.25 hours) to get it to a boil because my kettle fits over two 
     burners. 
 
     Just trying to minimize equipment costs and safety hazards.  Propane 
     burners are nice if you can brew in an area with adequate ventilation. 
 
     Have fun!

Subject: Barleywine 


Mark & Ava ask about priming their 1.058 FG barleywine and whether they 
should use just priming sugar or repitch another yeast..   
 
I just bottled my first barleywine so I am not an authority but I will share 
my experience.  My barleywine also started at 1.100.  I used a 20oz Wyeast 
Scotch Ale starter, pitching 10 oz initially and stepping-up the other 10oz 
to handle higher gravities.  The last stepup I did was with a 1.08 OG 
starter.  After fermentation slowed to a crawl, I took a reading and it had 
dropped to 1.035.  I pitched the stepped-up starter slurry and fermentation 
went from a crawl to a fast crawl.  This slow fermentation continued for 3 
additional weeks.  Then, I took a reading and it had dropped to 1.023.  I 
bottled it using malt extract and it is now aging. 
 
Now to your question!  With a 1.058 reading, I would GUESS there still is a 
nice supply of fermentable sugars remaining which leads me to believe that 
the yeast could not tolerate the higher alcohol levels and thusly have passed 
on.  Adding priming sugar at this point probably will not generate much 
carbonation.  I would suggest that if you can wait an additional 2 to 3 weeks 
for the use of your carboy, step-up a yeast to handle higher gravities and 
repitch.  Then wait to see what happens.  I believe the worst that can happen 
is an infection so pay attention to your sanitizing.  Good Luck and let us 
know what happens! 
 
Other more experience barleywine brewers, please chime in!
