Subject: Can I convert a PIN to a BALL valve ???


I just got my first soda keg. $15 for a Pin valve and in pretty good 
shape. It seems that everyone that replied to my "what should I get. 
balll or pin" question said BALL. So now I have a Pin keg and need to 
know what's involved with converting, if possible. 
What is the cost to switch between the two ? Say I have a ball and a pin, 
with one C02 bottle. I know the fittings on the lines are different, but 
what would the cost be to have an extra set of lines so I could switch 
back and forth ? Is it worth it ? 
Should I trade my pin on a ball if possible. Maybe the local homebrew 
store will let me, who knows. 
 
Thanks again.

hey gang, 
 
about a couple of weeks ago someone was inquiring about a beer they had 
drank. 
they spelled it pretty close to  altenmuenster (note the ue is really an 
u with an umlaut for you non-linguistically inclined types). 
 
the bar i work at has this beer and i decided to copy what little info 
there was on the bottle, which follows: 
 
Brauer Bier 
das Altenmuenster 
Privatbrauerei  Franz Joseph Sailer 
D-87616  Marktoberdorf, Germany 
 
i'm not sure if it is an alt beer or not,  when i tried about a month 
ago(as i recall) 
it was moderately malty and moderately hoppy. 
 
just hoping this is somewhat useful

Yes, the chemical reactions are the same, but their efficiencies are 
different.  Cajun cookers are *much* less efficient than stove 
burners, especially when you start adjusting the flame.  They seem 
to be engineered for full blast only, and become even more 
inefficient when you try to turn them down. 
 
But to answer your question more precisely, the combustion of fuel 
such as natural gas (CH3) and oxygen (O2) results in the production 
of CO2 and H20. The problem is when the fuel-to-air ratio is not 
chemically balanced you get inefficient combustion which can lead to 
other dangerous products such as CO. In short, cajun cookers can 
produce a lot more CO than your oven and should be used in well 
ventilated areas.

Subject: High temp fermentation


Good morning, 
 
>>> Jim Liddil says in regard to Chimay yeast: 
I caution you against such a high temp ferment, but I'll let you decide. 
I 
prefer not to make headache, banana beer. 
 <<< 
 
I have brewed a couple of trippels at 80 F with very few higher alcohols 
and only enough banana and clove to be appropriate to the style.  Both 
the primary and the secondary of these beers were at 80 F and they were 
bottle conditioned at 90 F.  Primary fermentation took a week for a 
trippel with a an O. G. of 1.080.  I feel that the key is that you 
maintain the temperature at a constant 80 F, if you vary up and down too 
much that is where the high esters and higher alcohols come from. 
 
Yeast Lab's Canadian yeast requires a higher temperature to reduce the 
amounts of fruitiness.  I found that using a temperature of 75 F that 
this yeast produced a much cleaner beer then when fermented at 65 F.

Subject: re:enzymes


Good evening, 
 
>>>Al K had this as point to clarify: 
1) that in a low-calcium environment you would get "poor efficiency and a 
 
 
   more fermentable wort than expected because the alpha amylase is less 
   stable than in a higher calcium environment. 
<<< 
 
If the pH is correct the alpha amylase will be stable and the efficiency 
is what you would expect for the malt being used.  You will find that in 
Principles of Brewing Science in sort of a left handed way. 
 
2) "Most true Pilzens use a lager malt low in husk tannins..." 
 
So do most German, British, and any other beer that is brewed with 
European malts. 
 
3) "They [malts] will slowly lose their enzymatic powers, but it will 
    take several years, based on my personal experience." 
 
I don't know how long several years is but I have used some malts that 
have been stored in Rubbermaid bins with a cover that was not air tight 
at all for five years and I found little or no lose of efficiency and the 
 
resulting beer tasted just fine.

I'm not sure about the protein rest, although it could make a difference in 
the amount of break material. 
Irish moss will help clear your beer, so the lack of it in batch could 
definetely be one of the causes. 
I don't think a slow sparge would create a hazier beer. 
Using whole hops would create a kind of filter catching a lot of the break 
material in the kettle. You didn't mention how you transfer from kettle to 
fermenter. If you whirlpool then siphon, the hops used could make a 
difference. 
 
I have skipped protein rests often and never noticed a difference in 
clarity of beer. I always use irish moss and at least one addition of whole 
hops during my boil. I syphon after stirring and most of the break material 
clings to the flower hops. I found this technique quite effective.

Dave, 
I think that you're missing the point.  No one is suggesting "throwing away 
beer", or making a sissy beer.  If my normal batch is 5 gallons, I can make 
a 5 gallon batch using a no-sparge technique.  If my normal gravity for beer 
style X is 1.050, I can make a 1.050 beer using a no-sparge technique.  The 
difference is to add more grain to the mash, calculated by the expected 
residual sugars that you leave in the grains.  I'll grant you that it would 
be possible to make more beer from those sugars, but it ain't beer yet. 
   Also, in the Fix article that spawned this debate, he notes that he 
*does* continue to sparge and uses the wort from the residual sugars for 
yeast propagation.  I've never done this, but frankly, it looks like a 
worthwhile option to me.  I'll try to list the pros and cons as they appear 
to me. 
 
PRO's 
1.  Time savings, due to eliminated sparge time (important, for those of us 
with families). 
2.  Additional maltiness in profile, which was the premise for the Fix 
article in the first place. 
3.  Potential for less tannin extraction during sparging (a real pro for me, 
given the carbonates of my water). 
4.  Potential for eliminating the need for a hot liquor tank (can heat the 
mash water in the boil kettle). 
5.  Others? 
 
CON's 
1.  More grain required 
1a.  Additional cost (by increasing grain bill about 30%) 
1b.  Additional solid waste to dispose of (not a problem if you have a 
compost pile) 
1c.  Potential for requiring a larger mash tun. 
2.  Others? 
 
Due to the small additional cost per batch, potentially recouped if you use 
the residual wort for yeast ranching, I don't any problem with doing this. 
 Just another opinion....

Subject: O2


Mark Bayer had some additional questions about oxygenation: 
 
1.  how long does it take for the super saturated wort to reach an equilibrium 
    state with regard to its dissolved oxygen level? 
 
This is going to depend on many variables. I have to do some DO 
measurements in the next couple of days and will overxygenate and see how 
long it takes to get back to equilibrium for at least a nominal example 
case. The wiseguy answer is that it never gets back to equilibrium but 
rather assyptotically approaches it. That aside, oxygen will flow from the 
wort to the air at a rate per unit area proportional to the difference of 
partial pressures of oxygen in the air and the wort. Thus the DO level in 
the wort in shallow coolship with a fan lowing over its surface would be 
much greater than the rate of exchange in a tall carboy with a water lock 
on it. In ordinary circumstances I think we are talking in the order of a 
few minutes. 
 
2. what would this final equilibrium dissolved oxygen level be at some nominal 
    temperature, say 65 deg. F, and 1 atm? 
 
That's the only one I can answer definitely. Under a standard atmosphere 
(1013 mbar) DO levels in air saturated water are as follows: 
 
  0C    5C     10C    15C     20C   25C   30C   35C   40C 
14.64  12.75  11.25  10.06   9.08  8.25  7.55  6.94  6.41 mg/l 
 
It's widely reported that O2 is less soluble in wort and so it is but not 
appreciably so in the range of gravities seen in normal (12 degree or so) 
beers. 
 
3.  at what level of dissolved oxygen does yeast cease normal activity and 
    begin the "dying" process?    or the "not optimal for a good beer 
    fermentation" state? 
 
I don't know the answer to either of these. The "not optimal" is an 
especially arguable one. British brewers, for example, fiddle with 
oxygenation of wort and pitching slurry to control ester levels. They want 
an ester profile which would be anathema to a lager brewer. 
 
4.  is there an oxygen level at which yeast becomes unable or unwilling to 
    consume the oxygen?  even if it's not a toxic level, it would surely 
    affect the fermentation. 
 
I believe that they will continue to consume it as long as other nutrients 
are available and even though it is at a toxic (but not lethally so) level. 
I'm extrapolating from my very sketchy knowledge of humans here. 
 
Mark also comments that there must have been lots of research and there has 
been and Tracy Aquila has poured over it so Tracy, come in please.

Just a quick question about yeasts.  This is one I thought about at 3 
A.M when I could not sleep.  What happens when multiple strains of

     clear.  He lists the differences between the two batches. 
 
     The differences that I feel are relevant to the clarity of the beer 
     are: 
 
     1.  The clear beer had a 20 min. protein rest at 122F (50C) 
 
     2.  The clear beer utilized Irish moss 
 
     3.  The clear beer had a shorter sparge 
 
     The reason the first batch is not clear is because of the larger 
     quantity of tannins and proteins that are in solution.  This is 
     illustrated nicely by the fact that the cloudy batch didn't produce as 
     much trub as the clear batch (i.e., the proteins and tannins are still 
     in solution, not resting at the bottom as part of the trub). 
 
     Looking at it point by point: 
 
     1.  The protein rest helped to degrade proteins that contribute to 
     haze, allowing for better protein/tannin coagulation during the boil. 
 
     2.  The Irish moss aided the coagulation/precipitation of proteins, 
 
     3.  The shorter sparge MAY have (not necessarily) reduced the 
     extraction of husk tannins.  If the sparge water pH was acidic, this 
     was not an issue. 
 
     This would be a good BJCP exam question. 
 
     Have fun!

To which I say: 
Does that mean "Don't make wine with grapes you wouldn't enjoy eating?" 
Bad-tasting wine will make food taste bad; ergo, the cooking axiom.  But just 
because corn is too old (meaning - dry and tough) to eat doesn't mean it's 
not a perfectly good fermentable.  I don't know that it *is*, but it's 
suitability as 
a side dish shouldn't be a factor.  Just one guy's opinion.

Subject: Re: Mashing problems


 
My first attempt at posting this was eaten by the [none] bug.  Here's a second 
try: 
 
 
Dean Mueller in #2262 mentioned several problems with his early all-grain 
batches.  In particular, he found his 5 gallon plastic bucket mash/lauter tun 
to be too small for stronger beers.  An easier/cheaper solution (than the 10 
gallon Gott cooler) would be just to move to a 6.5 gallon plastic bucket and 
use the same false bottom (that I assume you already have.) I've handled up to 
16 lbs with no trouble in this set up, although I may be using a thicker mash 
than Dean.  I usually mash in my kettle, using at most two infusions and 
direct heat to move to mash-out temperatures.  Ladling (carefully) into the 
lauter tun is a bit of a pain, but it works in the end.  The 6.5 gallon 
buckets are also very cheap and easy to find. 
 
George De Piro raises a very good point in #2263, in response to Dean.  The 
much-maligned enamel on steel canning kettles have a lot of advantages.  They 
usually fit over two stove burners, so that boiling in the kitchen is feasible 
(although I'm impressed that George can do 12+ gallons.  He must have a better 
stove than I do.)  Also, they're generally much more "squat" in design than 
SS kettles, so that an 8+ gallon kettle fits comfortably in my oven.  This 
makes overnight mashes easy, shortening my brewing day by about two hours. 
Finally, spending $30-40 for a kettle, as opposed to $120-200, is pretty 
attractive.

Koelsch is made with a top fermenting ale yeast in Koeln.  It is a warm

I have yet to sample a koelsch in the US that compares favorably with

What you did was fine, you pitched the proper amount of yeast cells 
which very few homebrewers do without repitching or a visit to the 
local micro.  As Ive heard many times from many brewers, "Im a 
firm believer in overpitching".  Im also a firm believer in lots 
of O2.  Grapefruit is often a result of using wonderfully pungent 
hops from the Pacific Northwest, Cascades, Centennials and Columbus.

Subject: homemade MICRO- keg system


Problem: 
 Don't like to clean, fill, and wash all those glass bottles.  Kegging 
sounds great but I don't have a beer fridge.  Even if I did I would have 
to put it in the basement and walk down there every time I want a beer 
(some days that's pretty often).  Thought about the 5 liter mini keg 
system but even that's a bit big for my kitchen fridge, and I could only 
have one type of beer on tap (heaven forbid). 
 
Solution: 
 I built a kegging system using 2 liter (65oz) PET soft drink bottles. 
Sounds crazy?  Well can't say I'd argue with you.  But it allows me to 
have two types of beer on tap in my kitchen fridge and it takes up less 
space than two rows of bottles.  Each micro-keg holds about 6 servings. 
They are easy to handle, clean, and fill, and they are FREE. 
 
For those who haven't paged-down because you think I'm nuts, here's a 
brief description of my system. I took a 5/8" bolt and drilled a 1/4" 
hole down through it.  I put a length of 1/4" cooper pipe through the 
hole and soldered it in.  The bolt is then put through a 5/8" hole that 
I drilled into the plastic bottle cap.  When it is tightened down it is 
a leak-proof seal.  when the cap is screwed onto the PET bottle the 
copper pipe is cut so that it reaches to the bottom of the bottle.  I 
put a bend in the bottom so that it actually reaches into the bottom 
corner of the bottle. 
 
On the outside of the cap I installed a small 3-way valve.  The common 
leg of the valve goes on the copper pipe.  Another leg goes to a CO2 
line.  My CO2 bottle is in the basement.  I have been using about 10 psi 
so far.  I have cheap plastic tubing coming up through the floor behind 
the fridge and going in through a small hole drilled in the side of the 
fridge (try to sound convincing when you tell your wife that it's just a 
SMALL hole, don't worry).  The other side of the 3-way valve goes to a 
short tube which is my spout. 
 
The micro-kegs (PET bottles) are stacked in a plexiglass holder that I 
built for the top shelf of the fridge.  The two bottles lie on their 
sides on an angle so that the bottom of the bottles are a bit lower than 
the top.  This keeps any sediment at the bottom edge and also lets me 
get the last bit of beer out using that bent copper pipe. 
 
To use the system I simply open a 2 liter bottle of brew and screw on 
one of my custom made keg tops.  I put it in the fridge and hook up the 
CO2.  When I turn the 3-way valve one way I get CO2 coming in to 
pressurize the bottle.  When I turn it the other way I get a glass of 
beer coming out.  After every glass is tapped I simply turn the valve 
the other way to get a fresh shot of CO2 to repressurize. 
 
It works great.  It allows me to have two types of beer on tap at any 
time and it takes up very little space in our fridge.  As with any new 
system, I am experimenting with minor modifications such as nozzle 
design, delivery pressure, etc.. 
Ain't brewin fun!

Picky, picky, picky.  I was paraphrasing.  I knew that wasn't quite right 
when I posted it.  I figured that someone would call me on it.  OK, I just 
looked up the article, which is what I should have done before posting.  In 
the control batch using standard mashing/sparging technique, he used 27.55 
lbs of grain, to get a 1.060 wort in a 13.2 gal batch (28.7 pts).  In the 
experimental batch using a no-sparge technique, he used 36.75 lbs of grain 
to get the same OG (21.6 pts).  So, in fact, he used 9.2 lbs more grain - 
which I make out to be 33% more grain.  The difference in extract is 25% 
less extract.  How'd I do this time? 
 
Kind of like the difference between "mark-up" and "margin" in pricing.

Subject: Stupid questions


Cheers, everyone... 
I want to make a partial mash lager or pilsner resulting in beer with 
very pronounced bread-taste, such as Gron Tuborg or Konig Pilsener. What 
Wyeast-strain and malt composition shall I use? Or, even better, can 
someone of you brewing fans all over the world share me a receipt? 
 
I am also considering the use of asorbic acid as an antioxidant in my 
brewing experiments. Does anyone know how much acid can be added to a 5 
gallon batch without severely affecting the taste? I suppose this is 
variable depending on what kind of beer you are emulating. 
 
Private e-mail is OK but not necessary. 
 
Once again, cheers...

Subject: Oxygenation


The BT article on oxygenation/aeration was in no way the definitive 
treatment of the subject.  I too felt that were several issues that were 
not addressed and that the author's results were in fact inconsistent with 
what others (myself included) had observed.  Although I can offer no good 
explanation for these discrepancies, I also felt that what was published 
will be taken as "the absolute truth" and will lead to the further 
propagation of misinformation. 
 
The optimal dissolved oxygen (DO) levels for yeast are somewhat variable. 
8-12 ppm for ales and 10-14 ppm for lagers.  Some of the Siebel strains 
actually require up to 20 ppm.  Note that these are well above the levels 
at which wort is saturated with air or oxygen (8 ppm).  This is why I have 
been a strong advocate of continuing to aerate (0.5 -4 hours) after 
pitching.  Since the yeast will rapidly absorb the dissolved O2, continued 
aeration post pitching this will essentially increase the net amount of O2 
absorbed.  This is especially applicable if using air to introduce oxygen 
and really depend on your method.   And in my hands, the aquarium pump 
method can produce sufficient levels of oxygen to reach the 8 ppm range.  I 
should point out that the aeration system I use and developed (BrewTek) was 
not tested in this article. 
 
Having been frustrated with the foaming with the immersion type aerators, I 
have since developed an in-line system which I use at home with welding 
grade oxygen.  Visible bubbling at less than 1 psi of O2 only yields about 
4 ppm while setting of 4-6 psi consistently gives levels of 13 ppm.  This 
level tends to be stable for 10-15 minutes.  O2 is clearly being released 
from the wort and  using a flame when pitching your yeast (and the ensuing 
explosion) will verify this.   (I don't recommend trying this). 
 
What do these levels mean in terms of fermentation performance.  Well first 
off, I routinely pitch 15-25 million cells/ml which is well above 
recommended pitching rates for ales and lagers.  These beers take off 
within 2-4 hours irrespective of the O2 levels and I do not think that this 
is really a good endpoint for fermentation.  What is perhaps the most 
dramatic difference is the time at which it takes to complete fermentation. 
The 13 ppm worts (all are around 1.050 O.G.) are finished within 2-3 days 
while the 4 ppm continue to bubble away for several more days.  The 
terminal gravities also seem to be 1-3 gravity points higher than they 
should be. 
 
As far as Dion's oxygenating under pressure, I question how much oxygen 
actually gets dissolved in your system.  Do you shake?  You may be getting 
less O2 than you think.   Dennis Davidson's data with the Oxygenator 
suggest that the equilibration rate is much slower if it is sufficiently 
dissolved.  Again I find this hard to believe based on my own personal 
experience but plan to test for myself. 
 
The real dilemma is how to settle the confusion that has been generated 
from the discrepancies in the article.  The actual work was funded by the 
AHA but not published in Zymurgy because of its technical nature so an 
article in Zymurgy is out. Since it was published in BT, I'm sure they will 
not do another one for at least another year.  Perhaps George's new book 
will shed some light on this subject. 
 
I should point out that the above statements are my personal opinion and 
are not meant to be inflammatory to Dennis Davidson or BT. I expressed 
similar concerns to them prior to publication.   And I would add that 
Dennis did alot of work and should be applauded for that.  Moreover if the 
article stimulates more research, it is a good thing.  My problem is that 
unlike more classical scientific disciplines, we are somewhat limited as to 
where conflicting or even supporting views may be published.
