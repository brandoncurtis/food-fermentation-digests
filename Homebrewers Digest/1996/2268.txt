Hello HBD'ers: 
 
Would it be a bad idea to store a copper wort chiller filled with bleach = 
solution?  Could there be any adverse chemical reactions?  I wouldn't =

     Brian Krause asks what water flow will be most efficient. 
 
     How do you define efficiency?  Do you want to minimize cooling water 
     usage?  Minimize cooling time?  You already have the copper coil 
     immersion cooler.  To minimize water usage, throttle the water to 
     minimize the temperature difference between the water exiting the coil 
     and the wort in your kettle.  To minimize cooling time, run as much 
     water as possible.  You could also build another coil to immerse in an 
     ice - saltwater mixture to further cool the cooling water before it 
     enters the wort chiller.  And, of course, be sure to gently agitate 
     the wort with the chiller or a mixer to avoid the dreaded stagnant 
     boundary layer where the wort contacts the coil.  To further speed the 
     cooling, put your kettle in a tub filled with an ice - saltwater mix 
     and make sure you stir the ice/water and the wort while using your 
     immersion chiller. 
 
     When I chose a wort cooler, I considered 1)How much will it cost for 
     the materials to build it, 2)How easy will it be to clean/sanitize, 
     3)How easy and costly will it be to use, and 4)How fast will it cool 
     my wort? 
 
     Counterflow chillers will require less copper tubing but special 
     fittings (which aren't free) to achieve the same cooling at the same 
     rate.  Counterflow requires a valve on the kettle or starting a 
     siphon.  Immersion chillers are easier to clean and sanitize.  I got a 
     good deal on 50' of 3/8" copper tubing and didn't relish the idea of 
     cleaning and assembling a counterflow chiller.  If I was doing 10 
     gallon batches or larger, I might have had a different opinion, 
     especially after hearing so many people on the digest who use 
     counterflow chillers claim that their cleaning/sanitizing procedures 
     are easy and effective.

I was ordering amber malt extract for a recipe that 
also used crystal malt.  The supplier did not have 
amber malt extract in stock, but said I could 
'make' amber by useing pale malt extract and a lb.

Would I still use the 1/2 lb. of crystal malt that

Subject: Think Zinc


 
Summary:  Zinc supplementation in fermenting wort may be beneficial 
          in Colorado.  Why? 
 
A couple of brewers in Colorado (one brews lagers, the other ales) have 
recently told me that zinc supplementation of water in this area is highly 
beneficial to yeast growth.  Apparently, addition of zinc to the 
fermentation stage increases the yeast growth rate significantly.  This is 
probably a Good Thing, reducing primary fermentation times and making yeast 
propagation more efficient.  Effects on beer taste are reported by one of 
the brewers to be very positive. 
 
Zinc is an essential micronutrient for all biological growth and is a 
cofactor in many enzyme systems, but very a low level is required.  The 
level of supplementation may be in the 1 to 4 ppm (mg/L) range. 
Too much zinc may also inhibit yeast growth and cause a metallic taste. 
 
Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide states that malt _usually_ provides all the 
zinc required.  But, the water on the Front Range of Colorado is apparently 
unusually low in zinc content (a rather uninformative '<20 ppm' on my water 
analysis), possibly explaining the need for supplementation. 
 
Questions for learned beer folk: 
    o   Can anyone confirm a recommended concentration range of zinc in wort? 
 
    o   Does zinc play any role in the mash?  Would supplementation 
          at this stage of the process offer additional benefits? 
          (I'm wondering if zinc is a required cofactor for amylases, 
           beta-glucanases, proteinases, phytases, etc.) 
 
    o   Can too much zinc be toxic or inhibitory to yeast growth? 
           Is this inhibitory level above the taste threshold? 
 
Extra credit: 
    o   Zinc dietary supplement pills typically contain 1000mg of 'zinc'. 
         Are such pills a suitable source of supplementary zinc for brewing? 
         Are the other components in these pills unsuitable for beer 
          (are there any preservatives?)?

Subject: Re: Alpha-amyalse & Calcium


Top of the afternoon. 
 
How much calcium is required is the question.  George Fix states that an 
amount of 50-100 ppm is about right.  With the Pilsen beers being brewed 
with about 5 ppm of calcium how is that possible? 
 
How can I get good extract without adding calcium when my water has less 
then 5 ppm of calcium.  Please don't tell the mash.  If the mash doesn't 
know and it still works please talk about calcium in whisphers.  I just 
brewed a blonde doppel bock with an extraction of 34 points per pound per 
gallon and I added no calcium to the wort.  I brought the pH to 5.3 with 
an 30 min acid rest. 
 
How much calcium is enough???

Subject: Footnote to Using Bleach in Wort Chiller


Hello again HBD'ers: 
 
As chance would have it, I remembered that I had a book on chemical = 
compounds *after* I had posted my previous article on storing a copper = 
wort chiller filled with bleach solution...  ;-( 
 
Anyhoo, the book says that there exists something called cuprous = 
chloride (CuCl) which is poisonous.  It says this compound can be = 
produced by reducing copper chloride (CuCl2).  Could these compounds = 
form if the wort chiller is stored at room temperature? 
 
Maybe it isn't such a bright idea after all (good thing I haven't tried = 
this yet...) 
 
Perhaps another solution might be used instead?  TSP perhaps?

Subject: Protein Rest using Highly Modified Malt


I have decided to try an experiment, based on another poster's 
experience with protein rest. I want my lighter ales to be as clear as 
possible without filtering and without waiting for a few months. I 
always use irish moss (1 tsp in 5 gal, 15 min boil) and I always use 
gelatin (1 tsp, 5 gal, secondary fermentation). Right now I've gotta 
wait about 3-4 weeks before beer really clears nicely - in the fridge, 
taking up space in a keg. 
 
So, question - what temperature would be best for the rest (yes, it 
rhymes) using say Hugh Bairds Pale Ale and for how long? My inclination 
is somewhere between 125 and 130F for about 30 minutes. And oh yeah, 
probably very very thick `at` about 24 oz water per pound of malt. 
 
Or am I completely wasting time and energy? Or am I possibly ruining my 
mash by doing this with fully modified malt?

In HBD2267, Larry asks about the difference between the Chico ale yeast and

'nutty' taste than the 1056, which worked great for the brown ale but may not 
be what you are looking for in a SNPA clone.  Attenuation seemed close.

All this talk about running your cooler at full throttle boggles my 
mind. I have a homemade 30' counterflow cooler that I connect to my 
boiler ( whick is a converted keg). I brew outside, and my water comes 
from a well ( about 150' feet down) and is VERY COLD. I have to throttle 
back my cooler to maintain a decent temperature to start the yeast. Even 
with the water just trickling through, I still have problems keeping the 
temp at or above 65. By the way, the outlet water is VERY HOT. 
 
Of course as it gets colder, the problem gets worse. 
 
just my 2 cents

Subject: Torrified Wheat and Invert summed up


 Thanks for the replies on my questions on using torrified wheat 
and making invert sugar.  Here is a summary for the rest of you newbies 
and anyone else interested. 
 Torriffied wheat definitly needs to be mashed.  The definition 
of "cooked" means the torrified wheat has already had its starches 
gelatinized so that enzymes can attack them, but it still needs to be 
mashed with pale malt or some other high enzyme grain. 
 On the invert sugar question.  The reason I was planning on inverting 
the demerara was to avoid the cidery flavor that comes from fermenting 
sucrose.  Duffy Toler pointed out that the source of these flavors is 
the invertase enzyme that the yeast produce to break down the sucrose. 
He also points out that the cider effect caused by 1-1.5 lbs of sugar 
should be below the taste threshhold so as long as you don't go 
overboard on the sugar you should be fine.  Therefore, I'm just dumping 
the sugar right into the boil.

I'm not advocating an anti-sparging campaign (Stop the Sparge Madness! or 
Mad Mothers Against Sparging, ok I'll stop now).  Certainly, there is 
nothing wrong with making beer the way its been done lo these many thousands 
of years.  I just like to try different things.  It looks like there are 
some appealing benefits (and some potential benefits, which may or may not 
be real).  There is, to me, an insignificant reason against it.  So it's 
$1-2 more grain per batch, so what?  For now, its an academic discussion on 
my part.  I haven't tried it yet.  Are the benefits worth the additional 
cost?  Possibly, but that's an individual decision.  I haven't even 
formulated my own opinion, so I'm not trying to persuade anyone else.  Will 
a no-sparge process replace conventional sparging?  I don't think so.  Will 
it ever become part of my normal (whatever that is) process?  Who knows? 
 
Again, you don't need to actually waste those residual sugars.  You can 
continue to sparge and use the leftover wort for yeast ranching, or even a 
small beer.  This kind of mitigates the loss. 
 
I do agree, Curt, that participating in the process of brewing (including 
sparging, too) is part of the enjoyment of the hobby.  For me, another 
enjoyable part of the hobby is contemplating and discussing how alternative 
materials and processes will change (and hopefully improve) the flavor of 
the beer, if even marginally.  I guess that's how I was sucked into the RIMS 
hoopla. 
 
FWIW, I don't know if the Fix article was actually published anywhere other 
than here.  It is available from The Brewery in the Library, title "Yummy 
Malt Flavors" or something like that.  As I said, it's pretty brief. 
 
Scott 
Brewing is a journey.  Enjoy the ride.

I did not attempt to answer the question of 'how much'.  Levels as 
high as 50-100 ppm may be (and likely are) desirable for reasons other 
than enzyme stability. I do not have a Ca concentration min for 
alpha-amylase stability under mash conditions, nor do I have a 
trustworthy figure for calcium ion contribution from your malt.

I speculated in my previous post (perhaps you misread it), that you 
may get good yield in low Ca mashes because the AMY1 (low isoelectric 
point) requires only 1/10th as much calcium for stability as AMY2 ... 
*AND* the AMY1 form of alpha-amylase performs virtually all the 
granule degradation and starch hydrolization (yield producing). AMY2 
is apparently only involved in degrading hydrolysed starches.

ARGH.  Cruelty to stainless steel.  If you have WWW access (I noticed the 
juno address, so if...), there is a full primer at The Brewery 
(http://alpha.rollanet.org/) by Dion Hollenbeck (also in HBD #1865) that 
covers this topic.   If you don't, let me know and I'll send it to you (I 
know, no attachments with Juno).  In the meantime: 
  1) Do not use Cl- bleach with stainless steel (SS), particularly letting 
it sit.  This will cause chloride pitting at the air/water interface - this 
can be severe enough to corrode a hole through the keg (problem gets worse 
with an increase in temp, but probably not a problem in this case).  This is 
the reason that most folks use an Iodine based sanitizer on SS.  If you look 
at a power plant on the ocean, their cooling piping containing seawater 
(with ~35000 PPM NaCl) are probably going to be a copper alloy (bronze) NOT 
SS just for this reason (plus it is probably cheaper too). 
   2) Ideas to clean.  See if you can find "Barkeepers Friend"(I think 
that's the name)  or similar product - metal cleansers that are oxalic acid 
based which will remove red rust.  Do not use steel wool (will give you lots 
of little bit and pieces of Iron which will rust, and you can't get them all 
out).  If desparate enough to use a metal scrubber, use a stainless steel 
scrubber.  There are also acid baths, but I'd not recommend them unless you 
know what you are doing.  Green scrubbers are what I usually use.  B-brite 
is another option. 
   3) Passivation. SS actually is supposed to oxidize (sort of rust), but 
not red rust.  A thin layer is formed of the things that are added to make 
it stainless (Chromium) preferentially to the Iron in the metal oxidizing 
(red rust) - this is called the passivation layer (molecules thick) and 
protects the metal underneath.   It is possible to remove this layer with 
some cleansers.  If I gave a keg a good scrubbing, I'd fill it with  plain 
water, then empty it and let it dry for a couple of days  before I'd put 
beer in it to allow the passivation layer to reform (gross 
oversimplification here).

Well, I am only guessing, but since *the premier* Munich dark lager is 
Spaten Dark Export, and the way Munich dark lagers get the malty 
caremelly flavor is from Munich malt and Spaten Optimator is from the 
same folks......   Well, you guess!!

I guess I have always assumed that high temp ferments were to be avoided 
whenever possible.  Lately, according some some posts, it sounds like 
they're ok, but only with the right yeasts (of course) and in some cases, 
with low temp _variation_. 
 
Personally, I've not yet had good temperature control.  I have a spare 
fridge, but not completely a brew fridge, and with no add-on temp 
controler.  I'll probably set up an aquarium heater and water batch setup 
this winter in the garage--the weather in Indiana is cooperating nicely for 
now.  I have had good success brewing weizen in the summer with Wyeast 3068 
(where you want banana and clove of course) when I managed to keep the temp 
_varying_ around 68F.  Specifically, I insulated a plastic fermenter and 
moved it in and out of the fridge during the hot summer.  (I left the 
fermenter out at night where the temp would rise to around 75 by morning. 
Then before work I would put it (insulated) into the fridge where it would 
be at about 63F when I got home in the evenings.)  I ended up with a really 
nice banana clove taste so the high and low temps seemed to balance each 
other well, and there didn't seem to be any ill effects of all the 
variation.  The incredible 3068 krausen seemed to rise more when the beer 
was chilling and fall a bit when the beer was warming at night.  (Newbies: 
Be sure to have a lot of headspace in the fermenter, or use a large 
recieving bucket on your blowoff!)

Subject: Cutting enamel pots


I would like to cut a hole in the side of my enamelwear boiler to add a 
brass spigot.  Being manually inept, I'd like to know beforehand whether 
this is a difficult task to accomplish without taking the risk of 
chipping off chunks of the enamel which are so large that they won't be 
covered with the spigot fittings.  Do I just fire up the ol' hand drill 
with a proper-sized bit, maybe slapping a bit of masking tape over the 
proposed void beforehand, er whut?

Subject: violent starter


This is only my second starter, and the first time I've stepped it up, 
but it is behaving oddly (to me anyway) so I wanted to poll the 
collective consciousness.  I started with ~200ml of ~1.040 wort and 
Wyeast 1056.  It fermented for 2 days with a layer of foam on the 
liquid but not a lot of activity.  This is exactly what happened in my 
last starter and my batch turned out great.  Last night I add ~300ml of 
~1.050 wort so I could prepare my yeast for the higher gravities 
they'll be experiencing in my beer this weekend.  This morning I 
checked it and there was foam in the airlock and residue all over the 
inside of the 750ml bottle I'm using!  Needless to say, my yeasties 
must have had some party last night.  In taking off the airlock to 
clean it, I smelled the starter and it smelled awfully sweet.  Hmmm.... 
 The fermentation temperature was sorta high 70-75 so the smell may 
just be esters, but the extremely active fermentation combined with the 
sweet smell has me a *bit* concerned (not worried mind you - just 
concerned).  So is there some sort of infection (*gasp*) that could 
produce what I've described, or is the active fermentation just a 
result of stepping up already strong yeasties and the sweet smell 
probably just esters from a high temp?  Any sharing of similar 
experiences would be must gratefully appreciated.

Subject: RE: Spaten Optimator


     Hi! 
 
     Brian asks how he can achieve the maltiness of Spaten Optimator, a 
     dopplebock. 
 
     Plenty of Munich malt (light and dark) is the key.  Decoction mashing 
     is also of prime importance.  Cara-malts are NOT appropriate in more 
     than small quantities.  They will give the beer a caramel flavor, 
     which is fine in a Scotch ale, or even some dopplebocks, but not in an 
     Optimator clone. 
 
     Malt flavor is the result of melanoidins.  Melanoidins are the product 
     of chemical reactions that combine amino acids and sugars.  These 
     reactions occur at high temperature (i.e., 212F, 100C).  They do not, 
     however, occur to a tremendous extent in the boil because of the 
     relatively low concentration of reactants in the aqueous environment. 
 
     That is why decocting is so vital; it provides the correct environment 
     for melanoidin formation.  Munich malt is made in a way that enhances 
     melanoidin formation, too. 
 
     Spaten Optimator is one of the drier dopplebocks.  They achieve this 
     dryness, in part, through the use of highly-roasted malts, which also 
     deepen the color.  It is also well attenuated, which enhances its 
     dryness. 
 
     Low hop rates also increase the impression of maltiness.  As an 
     illustration of this, I recently made a dunkleweizen that had some 
     "technical problems."  The mash was at 145F (63C) forever (read: very 
     fermentable wort), but I then added only 2/3 the intended hops (read: 
     I need more sleep).  Amazingly, the beer tastes properly balanced! 
     This is because my hop rate was based on a projected final gravity of 
     ~1.016, not the 1.007 I actually achieved!  A perfect example of two 
     wrongs making a right! 
 
     Read Darryl Richman's book, _Bock_.  It is very good, and he goes into 
     some detail about the formation of melanoidins during the malting and 
     mashing processes. 
 
     Have fun!

  Thinking about the recent dry-hopping discussions brings up a question.  If 
the CO2 released during primary fermentation "scrubs" away some of the aroma 
from dry-hopping too soon, does the aroma from a late kettle hops addition get 
"scrubbed" away also?  I know that the aroma from dry-hopping is different 
from late kettle additions but how is it different?  Can anyone please explain 
what the reaction is that "scrubs" away the aroma and how I can get a good 
aroma with late kettle additions and with dry-hopping?  TIA.
