Subject: Wort Chilling


All of this discussion about wort chilling and immersion chillers 
got me thinking about an approach that might be worth a try. 
 
Those of you that have pumps for either recirc or RIMS, might 
consider using the pump to recirc ice water through your immersion 
chillers. 
 
In my arrangement, when I get ready to chill, I'll dump 10-20 pounds 
of ice in my Gott cooler (cleaned out from the mash), top with 
water. Then connect the outlet on the cooler to the inlet on the 
pump, connect the outlet from the pump to the inlet on the chiller 
and the outlet from the chiller back into the cooler. (The knee bone 
connected to the leg bone...) 
 
Seems to me this might work pretty well.  Anybody out there do this? 
At the least it'll save on water. 
 
Jim

Subject: Wyeast 1098 and stuck ferment


I recently brewed a 10 gallon batch of all-grain IPA, OG=1.065, and pitched 
a 1.5 liter starter of Wyeast 1098. Fermentation at 62F started slowly (36 
hours) and stopped after a few days. I racked to the secondary and found 
that the gravity was 1.042! 
 
In back issues of HBD (around 1992-93) there was discussion of the three 
strains present in the Whitbread yeast (allegedly the same as 1098). George 
Fix stated that the first strain is a fast starter that is sensitive to 
alcohol levels over 2.5% by weight. As this strain slows the other two 
strains, which are slow starters, take over. 
 
My stuck fermentation occurred at 2.3% alcohol. Thus it appears that the 
first strain died, and the others never took off. 
 
Has anyone else seen this behavior with 1098?

Anyone have any success using a sparging bag for hops?  I noticed one 
catalog that recommended using a small bag, weighted down with marbles. 
Also, lately I've been dry-hopping in my primary fermenter after everything 
has settled down (about 2 days before transferring) with pretty good 
success.  Good aroma, and cleaner.  Thanks.

 Art, how often do you serve black patent malt at your table?  Never? 
 How about a dish of stewed roasted barley, husks and all?  Not 
 interested?  I doubt that Matthew's corn is really inedible.  It is 
 probably just no longer suitable as corn-on-the-cob.  It might be 
 fine for creamed corn, corn fritters, corn bread, or whatever. 
 
 Matt, I hope that you are going for it, and that some people with

Subject: Salvage operation


Hello collective. 
 
I asked an IMBR question about the thin milky-white layer sitting on top 
of my carboy a couple of digests ago, and have since received several 
e-mail responses.  I've also talked about it with some of my pals around 
these parts.  My thanks to all who sent me e-mail, and my apologies for 
not mentioning them by name here. 
 
The suggestions ran the entire spectrum from RDWHAHB to "dump it."  The 
majority seemed to think that it is worth the effort to go ahead and 
bottle it anyway and see how it comes out. 
 
So I'll be equipping my racking cane with a fresh scrubby this weekend. 
I'll stop the flow into the bottling bucket before anything floating can 
find it's way there, and press on.  We'll see how it comes out in a few 
weeks. 
 
I'll be coming home with new hoses and stoppers from the brewshop on my 
way home.  All that there is left for me to do is to resolve once again 
to practice the best sanitation that I possibly can, 
 
At this point, the worst that can happen is that I won't be waiting that 
long for the next batch of bottles to materialize.  ;-)  Thanks again to 
all who offered their advice/condolences/suggestions, and good brewing 
to the entire collective. 
 
Regards, 
T.

Subject: foxx distribution valves


I am looking at buying the 4 way distribution valves from the Foxx catalog. 
The catalog says they are nickel plated brass and they are intended for 
gas distribution.  Could these also be used for liquid distribution?  I 
want to use one for running the co2 to the kegs and another for running 
four kegs to one tap on the front of my fridge.  This allows you to open 
and close the valves, so i could open the valve on the one beer i want to 
sever while leaving the other three valves closed.  Is it safe to run 
carbonated beverages through nickel plated brass?  TIA for any help!

I have labeled Guy's question 1,2,3,4. I think this thread was a subset of the 
Ca++ thread. 
 
1) I think that's the reason. It is a well known phenomenon that milling 
affects
efficiency, but I have never seen any hard numbers other than my own to this 
effect. There must be a professional study somewhere that shows a relationship 
between grist surface area and rates of enzyme reactions.  In the macro world, 
milling larger in my set of mashing conditions (we must always indicate them 
- -1.1 to 1.3 qts/lb, LT holds,158F, 90 min) gives less efficiency of producing 
soluble carbohydrates in the wort. In the micro world of starch granules and 
enzymes, I just don't understand it. 
 
2) I'm sure this must be a factor, based on my experience with  the rate of 
sparging poorly milled malts which are generally faster running. But I usually 
control the rate to about an hour for 6.5 gals of wort in all cases. On 
thinking
about it, the larger the milled particles in the sparge, the slower the sparge 
should be run.  I suppose a baseline would be a totally unmilled malt. 
Interesting series of experiments to think about. 
 
3) I'd love to see it, it would be part of that database of many variables that
affect mashing outcomes

in the recent bt article on aeration/oxygenation, one of the advantages of 
oxygenation is that you can achieve higher levels of dissolved oxygen in a 
shorter amount of time than with aeration.  the hours-long process of running 
an aquarium pump and aerating was deemed "unacceptable to most homebrewers". 
the advantage of using oxygen was that you could use it for a minute or two, 
achieve significantly higher levels of dissolved oxygen, and be done with it. 
 
well, my observation is this: if you use an oxygen tank and oxygenate your wort
in a minute, then stop,  according to the above information your wort is 
going to have about 9 ppm of dissolved oxygen " a few minutes " after you 
stop oxygenating.  9 ppm is achievable using aeration methods, including 
rolling an oversize (7 gal) carboy around on the floor for 5 or 10 minutes, 
if i understand the article correctly. 
 
 
so if you truly want *higher* levels of dissolved oxygen, you need to do 
some sort of "continuous feeding", even with oxygen.  you need to keep a 
supply going to the yeast, as they are taking it up in the lag period. 
another homebrewer (dion, i think), mentioned how he oxygenated under pressure 
for a number of hours in a corny keg.  this, to me, is the only economical 
way to use oxygen and get *steady*, *higher* dissolved levels versus running an
aquarium pump for a few hours.  and you're still spending a few hours to 
get more oxygen to your yeast, as you are with the aquarium pump. 
 
 
so, really, the advantage of oxygen is that you don't have to roll the 
oversize carboy around for 10 minutes.  you're still looking at 8 or 9 ppm 
if you give your wort a 1 minute blast and then don't do anything else. 
 
 
of course, this assumes you have an oversize carboy. 
 
i really want some criticism of this idea.  i feel like i'm missing a piece 
of information or something.

Subject: CO2 Tank


I recently visited a fire extinguisher store to purchase a CO2 tank for 
kegging.
I was presented with a old tank that looked like a red fire extinguisher, 
but had a Carbon Dioxide label on the front of it. I explained that I could 
not use it because I needed a threaded valve that I could attach a regulator 
to (it had a extinguisher type top-excuse the shop talk!). He said he would 
put on a valve that I could use for this purpose. Is this purchase 
adviseable? It had a bunch of dates on it one of which was 11/96. Does this 
mean a test was done on this date or that it expires on this date? Should I 
have any other concerns, like internal cleanliness? He wants $45. Thanks for 
any input. 
Cheers!

Subject: 1056 vs. 1272


 
 
 
I agree that the two yeasts seem to be approximate in their attenuation; 
however, there are claims that the 1272 is more flocculent and this seems to be
generally true.  Also, it is rumored to emphasize the maltiness more.  This 
seems to be true also.  I've brewed a couple of beers with it recently, but 
they're still pretty green.  I'm going to try it on a brown ale in the next 
couple of days and maybe a stout, too.  It looks like all of my holiday beers 
(30-35 gallons) will be made from the 1272 (because of my sheer laziness) so I 
sure hope it's good. 
 
To be truthful SNPA can get on my nerves a little bit after awhile -- esp. from
the bottle -- but the 1056 beer I've tasted with more crystal or roasted malts,
I liked better.  Is SN using a different yeast for the bottled stuff as 
previously rumored here?

I seem to do well with only two hands.  I use one hand to hold the filler in 
place 
on the bottle.  Then, with the other hand (usually the right one), I open the 
gas valve and close it. I open the bleeder valve and let the air out and close 
it.  I then open the gas valve and pressurize the bottle.  With the same hand, 
I then close the gas valve and open the beer valve.  Then I open the bleeder 
valve slightly and let the bottle fill. 
 
You get the picture.  Since all these things are done serially and not in 
parallel, I get by fine without three hands.  How do the three handed people 
do things?

This is the source for my comment. ((( my highlights))) And this also supports 
A.J. DeLange's response to my comment. A.J.'s point was that the wort would not
support lethal levels of oxygen. I agree, but only if the wort is in 
equilibrium
with air at one atmosphere. 
 
 However, It is possible to get to the teens either through non-equilibrium 
injection( e.g. right next to the injection bubbler or in an in-line injection)
or by pressurization with pure oxygen.

Clears it up for me. 
 
 In a system in equilibrium with air, wort cannot support a lethal-to-yeasts 
level of oxygen, however in pure oxygen at 1 atmosphere the solubility of 
oxygen
in wort will be probably be in the twenties or thirties ppm. This will be high 
enough to be lethal to yeasts. So: if you are injecting oxygen while pumping 
into a FV, pitch the yeast after the oxygen injection. If you are contemplating
a continuous injection into a starter, then use air to be safe.

Subject: No Sparge -- A Parting Shot


One aspect of the no-sparge technique that has recieved much airplay here is 
cost.  Sure, an all-grain brewer will spend more money on a batch than s/he 
did before using this approach, but an *extract brewer* will save large 
dollars over an extract batch even if they "throw away the lost sugars". 
 Yummy malt flavor notwithstanding, I think the attraction of this technique 
is largely in the gateway it provides an extract brewer to make real 
all-grain beers: 
 
*- in a small kitchen 
*- on the wimpy one-burner electric stove 
*- in a small kettle (concentrated wort) 
 
just like they may already do.  No three-tier stands or extra kettles of 
sparge water cluttering up the kitchen.  Not everyone has the wherewithall 
for a "proper" all-grain system (whatever that is), especially apartment 
dwellers or those on a tight budget.  Sure, no-sparge mashing takes an extra 
couple hours to mash & drain compared with extract brewing, but the only 
equipment you need that you didn't have before is the mashtun.  And if the 
time comes later that you want to move to all-grain brewing, you already have 
a mashtun.

Subject: Storing Wort Chillers


If you have ever attempted to sanitize copper using bleach, you will quickly 
realize that it is "not good". It will turn black. Those black oxides will then
be transferred to the wort. 
 
To sanitize copper, use iodophor, or heat. To clean it prior to storage, 
boiling
water and B-Brite would be my suggested method (for Counter Flow). for 
immersion, B-brite for the crud and hot water rinse. 
 
If you suspect a lot of oxides inside a Counter flow, or see them outside on an
Immersion, then use White Distilled Vinegar to remove them.

Subject: re: Mashing specialty grains/Munich


In HBD 2251, Bill Giffen says, regarding specialty grains: 
 
>> Put all the grains into the mash at the beginning of the mash. The specialty
grains all have unconverted starch that needs to be mashed to convert. <<
 
While I agree in terms of Munich malt and other "specialty" 
malts that likewise usually comprise a significant portion of the mash, 
I've seen some controversy regarding this issue in terms of other 
specialty malts, used in smaller quantities and for different purposes, 
such as crystal. 
 
I've read and been told that mashing crystal malt might either damage 
the dextrins that contribute to head retention/body, as well as risk the 
leeching of tannins--especially as malt darkness increases. Mashing 
roast barley and black patent malts, for example, may cause astringency 
and/or overly bitter beer (though the well-known habit of adding a 
little black patent at the end of the mash remains a good addition for 
the clarity of most any beer). On the other hand, mashing chocolate malt 
is said to help acidify the mash and is therefore a good idea. Apart 
from chocolate malt, then, there seems to be a case for not adding any 
of the other specialty/colored grains until mash-out. 
 
What says the collective?

Subject: re: Protein Rest using Highly Modified Malt


In HBD 2268, Charles Burns asks: 
 
>> So, question - what temperature would be best for the rest (yes, it 
rhymes) using say Hugh Bairds Pale Ale and for how long? My inclination 
is somewhere between 125 and 130F for about 30 minutes. And oh yeah, 
probably very very thick `at` about 24 oz water per pound of malt. 
 
>> Or am I completely wasting time and energy? Or am I possibly ruining my 
mash by doing this with fully modified malt? 
 
 
I have been using highly modified malt for all my "pale" ales for about 
a year now, but I have not been using a protein rest with the base pale 
ale malt. Instead, I've done a "mini" protein rest at 122 for 30 minutes 
for any supplemental grains (except crystal) such as wheat or Victory or 
whatever, with a smaller amount of water of course, and then added the 
highly modified malt when I go to saccarification rests. I also use 
Irish Moss in every batch but not gelatin. Every batch has been pretty 
much crystal clear using this procedure. I've yet to have the time to do 
a duplicate batch using a protein rest for the highly modified malt, and 
haven't tried to find the time since everything's been working out so 
far and it hasn't turned out to be particularly more complex. 
 
Prosit!

Subject: Deschutes Brewery BBP Clone Recipe


After working on this recipe for over a year, I think I can finally share 
it with the brewing public.  It is virtually identical to the original, but 
I'll let you be the judge.  Special thanks to George De Piro and Hiawatha 
for their input during the recipe's formulation.  I really hope you enjoy 
it! 
 
Truth in brewing, 
 
Nick 
 
BUMBLE BEE PORTER 
 
Full Mash 
Gravities: 1.049 and 1.017-18 
Alcohol:  4.5% 
Color:  99.1 srm 
Hop IBU:  57.9 
 
Numbers provided by SUDS 4.0 
 
Recipe uses 9.88 pounds grain and makes approximately 5.5 gallons, although 
I only bottled two 12oz. cases out of this batch.  I also used distilled 
water, adding 0.5 teaspoon gypsum to the mash water, and a very small 
amount of 88% lactic acid to reduce pH. 
 
Ingredients: 
 
5 pounds American Two-Row (I used Briess) 
1 pound  Belgian Biscuit 
1 pound  DWC Munich 
12 oz.   Belgian Special-B 
8 oz.    DWC Chocolate Malt 
8 oz.    British CaraPils 
8 oz.    Flaked Barley 
4 oz.    DWC CaraMunich 
4 oz.    DWC Aromatic 
2 oz.    Black Patent 
 
Hops: 
 
0.5 oz.  Galena (12.0%) 60 minutes 
0.5 oz.  Galena (12.0%) 45 minutes 
0.5 oz.  Cascade (5.9%) 30 minutes 
0.5 oz.  Cascade (5.9%) 15 minutes 
1.0 oz.  Tettnanger (3.8%) 5 minutes 
 
Mash with 1 quart/pound. 
Strike water:  2.5 gallons of 170F water. 
Add 0.5 gallons boiling water to raise mash to 158F. 
Recirculated 4 quarts of mash, then drained 4 quarts of mash and heated to 
boil.  Returned to mash for mashout.  Sparge with 5 gallons water. 
 
Once boil is established, begin hop schedule.  I added two quarts distilled 
water 30 minutes into the boil (it was a warm day and the boil was rolling 
nicely).  I added my immersion chiller with 30 minutes remaining.  After 
cooling, I added 1/2 teaspoon HopTech Foam control to a sanitized 6 gallon 
carboy, then carefully poured the cool wort through a stainless steel 
strainer nested in a large funnel.  After chilling the wort further in a 
water bath to 58F, I aerated the wort using an aquarium pump, 0.22 micron 
filter, and aquarium airstone for 30 minutes. 
 
The yeast, which came from a bottle of Black Butte Porter, was stepped up 
to a 2000ml starter.  I think the fermentation temperature might have been 
too cold (60F) because it took almost 36 hours to reach active 
fermentation.  Temperture was maintained at 60F for seven days, then racked 
to secondary, where temperature was allowed to stabilize at 65F for two 
weeks.  Bottled using 5/8 cups corn sugar.  Allow at least four weeks in 
the bottle to condition before taste testing.

Subject: Amber malt exract


To Kevin DeWitt, 
 
In your post you asked: 
 
Subject: What is 'Amber' malt extrat 
 
I have talked to a few people involved in the malt extract industry and 
the answer is vague: "It varies from manufacturer to manufacturer" 
 
One hard and fast rule (so it seems) is that most manufacturers usually 
only make light and dark, and Amber is a mixture of 2 parts light and 1 
part dark. 
 
This is why Charlie P. gives multiple conversions: 
5 lb. Amber malt extract= 5 lb. light extract plus 2 cups crystal malt 
                      -OR- 
5 lb. Amber malt extract= 5 lb. light extract plus 1/2 cup chocolate, 
black or roasted. 
 
Obviously there is alot of variance, and the composition is determined by 
the grains used by the manufacturer.  This is an arguement for all grain 
brewing since you know exactly what is going in. 
 
One final note, I know Superbrau malt extracts uses DeWolf Cosyn Spec. B, 
Chocolate, and Black (or so I seem to remember).  As a result there is a 
caramel character, along with some chocolate/roast character.  But still 
I don't know the ratios. 
 
This problem is why when I make "mash-extract" recipes I'll start off 
with light malt extract (almost exclusively) and add the proper grains 
for the style.  Thus I can "reverse engineer" an all grain recipe and 
still keep the amount of time required short enough to fit into my busy 
schedule. 
 
I'm sorry that there is not a better answer than "it depends" but such is 
the nature of the beast. 
 
Good luck and good brewing, 
 
Kurt A. Meyer

Subject: Sake & koji


Hello everyone, 
 
I have been subscribing to the digest for a couple of weeks now, 
and there is lots of good information contained there. 
 
I have been brewing for a little more than 1 year and I enjoy it 
very much and constantly am learning more about brewing. 
 
I lived in Japan for a number of years and came to enjoy various 
kinds of sake. 
 
I am now interested in trying my hand at a batch of sake, but 
cannot find any good references that can guide me. 
 
Anyone have any recommendations about brewing sake? 
 
I also will need to find a source for koji which is important in 
the production of sake. Any sources out there? 
 
As I say, I enjoy brewing very much, but in my area, the local 
brew supply shop continues to hike their retail prices. I enjoy 
good brew, but surely there must be less expensive sources for 
the materials. 
 
Can anyone out there guide me to good, quality brew material 
suppliers that don't charge an arm and a leg for their goods.... 
 
Please contact me via e-mail at cpenn`at`interaccess.com 
 
Thanks very much in advance and continue to enjoy your brews!
