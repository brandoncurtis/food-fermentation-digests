Subject: Kegging


Can somebody provide me with simple instructions on how to keg beer.  I have 
tried on various occasions and seem to get only a lot of foam, no 
carbonation in the beeer itself.  I think my problem must be somehow 
associated with the length of dispensing hose and the internal keg pressure. 
I sometimes wish I had the quality I used to know in my bottled beer, 
however tedious it was to do the bottling thing.  Please help.....my wife 
thinks I have just wasted a lot of money on my kegging gear.  I have assured 
her that the next batch will be as good as our old bottled efforts.

Subject: Interest in non-RIMS Sparging Systems in Use or Being Contemplated 


I hope readers haven't received the following twice, but I just looked at 
HBD #2269 and I think it was inadvertently deleted along with some other 
messages. Anyway: 
 
Fellow brewers, 
 
I'm would like to hear from any of you who are working on any novel, 
technical sparging systems, or have any ideas along the following lines.  If 
the following strikes you, please mail me. 
 
My feelings on gadgetry: I personally don't think I want to make a RIMS-type 
system because I don't want to have to clean out any more lines and pumps 
with wort residue in them than I have to. I like to stir my mash while I 
manually control the flame under it and like having the flexibility of being 
able to infusion, step, or decoct as needed. My goal in using control 
systems (gadgetry) is to automate the drab stuff that make sense, without 
creating any mess to clean up. That why I lean toward automating the water 
side, i.e., sparging.  Without having experienced RIMS, maybe I'm jumping to 
conclusions... 
 
Standard procedure for 10 gallon batches is to mash my grain in a 
half-barrel keg, transfer it to my lauter, and then, after rinsing the keg, 
use the same keg and burner to boil, a procedure which has served me well. I 
plan to keep this procedure. 
 
The Plan is to use my CO2 regulator to lightly pressurize an my hot liquor 
tank, an aluminum 50L keg of British origin (Grundy) at near-ground level. 
The 50L keg will be heated by an electrical water heater element controlled 
(PID) to deliver heated water via insulated copper tubing to my rectangular 
lauter tun, a picnic cooler with drilled copper water-delivery manifold 
hanging inside the lid. [50L aluminum kegs lend themselves nicely to tapping 
with 1/8" pipe threads due to their adequate wall thickness.  They have a 
seemingly thick plastic internal lining, by the way]. I used a screw-in type 
water heater element, but instead of threading the keg for the element, I 
just made a hole and used two giant versions of worm-gear type stainless 
steel "radiator" clamps wrapped end-to-end around the whole keg to press the 
element against the supplied gasket. Actually the clamp presses against a 
PVC cap which presses against the element. This cap also serves to contain 
the electrial connections. 
 
A float switch in the lauter lid, according to plan, controls a solenoid 
valve in the line between the tank and lauter keeps the lauter (picnic 
cooler) just full.  SpargeMatic. 
 
Note: This will all be strung together to be grounded via my big copper rod 
in the ground so my six children won't be electrocuted. My hot liquor tank 
has a pressure relief valve.  I compost all by-products of brewing. Hot 
surfaces are insulated. 
 
If you have any suggestions, or any thoughts from your experience, 
especially if you have used a compressed gas to drive your hot liquor tank, 
or have good ideas on sparge water delivery manifolds with minimum silt 
disturbance as suited to rectangular coolers, I'd like to hear from you. 
Thanks.

Subject: CO2 Bottles,  Mash schedule


Brendan asks about old fire ext bottles with a current inspection.  Go for 
it the bottle 
is the same as any other CO2 bottle.  A new  one costs about $85.  $45 is 
1/2 price 
of a new one with a new valve and current inspection.  C02 is not reactive 
so the bottle 
should not be corroded inside. 
 
I tried a 40/60/70 mash schedule for the first time and got 28 pts instead 
of my usual 24 pts. using german pils malt.

Subject: Re: Oxygenation Cognitative Dissonance, Sake


 Brewsters: 
 
Mark"Brew Hard" Bayer had some questions about oxygenation and several have 
been
buzzing around in my bean also.. 
 
Using oxygen only allows a 5 times faster saturation ( and maybe less foam) 
than
if air is bubbled in, and does not give any higher final concentration of 
oxygen
in the wort than air as long as the wort is in contact with air at one 
atmosphere pressure. If it only takes a few minutes to saturate with oxygen in 
small bubbles, how long does it take to saturate a wort with no shaking, etc., 
just standing in contact with air? 
 
SInce I've been brewing lots of years successsfully using an open fermenter 
covered with a thin poly sheet and underpitching by commercial standards, is it
possible that in the 12-24 hour wait before anaerobic fermentation begins that 
oxygen diffusion into the wort is sufficient? Anyone with numbers on oxygen in 
wort in this circumstance? Don't we, with our 2 feet depth or so of beer, have 
the same situation ( except ours are  cool and covered with plastic sheets) as 
coolships of old in terms of oxygen diffusion?.  Is oxygenation necessary in 
small volumes like ours or just in commercial quantities? Any hard numbers on  
oxygen content in wort or even water standing in contact with air for 12 to 24 
hours.  How about some of you limnologists out there?  Any info on lakes and 
oxygen?  Is the addition of oxygen needed only when using closed fermentation 
and high pitching rates? 
 
Why is it that such a small quantity of oxygen at the beginning of the brew can
make a difference?  If one calculates the moles of oxygen versus the yeast 
requirements, it is obvious the amount is infinitesimal as far as making a real
impact on the direction of the fementation. In an earlier comment I pointed out
that the oxygen content of a saturated wort is sufficient for only 10 or so 
seconds in a fully active yeast colony. 
 
Although I don't deny experimental facts about falling yeast yields and degree 
of attentuation in the absence of oxygen in commercial situations, some of 
which
I have published here from M&BS, I, like Mark, must be missing something. 
- ------------------------------------------------------- 
Calgarey  Penn, having lived in Japan for a number of years and tasted lots of 
types of Sake, asks for Sake references and sources. 
 
Is there a Sake maker's net out there? 
 
Best easily available book with lots of references is Fred Eckhardt's 
"SAKE(USA)" (1992) from Fred Eckhardt's Communnications, Portland, Oregon 
503-289-7596. He covers the definition and clues to making all different types 
of oriental Jiu. He has a chapter on homebrewed Sake. He claims that Koji can 
be
obtained from a local Japanese grocery store. Failing that, try some of the 
larger Mailorder HB suppliers..  Wyeast sells the Sake Yeast used in the Moto.

from talking to wyeast this is a single strain, the old dry stuff 
sourced from crosby and baker was a triple strain, until they had 
some problems and dropped the entire brand.  i used to get it in bricks 
and then all of a sudden it was not available anymore. 
i forget which strain they actually isolated for use, maybe some else 
knows offhand....for me it does not matter, i have it and it works like a 
champ...drops out quickly and stores pretty well. 
 
>My stuck fermentation occurred at 2.3% alcohol. Thus it appears that the 
>first strain died, and the others never took off. 
 
nahhh - you just under pitched, how did you aerate the wort, i know 
from using this yeast it likes to have (in my usage) lots of aeration 
and a little warmer temps.  i pitch at 72 and by the time it gets rocking 
(2-3 hours later) the temp has dropped to 70 or so, then climbs back to 72. 
the whole fermentation is over within 3 days.  this is just about any 
amount of sugar.  we had a 20 plato wort go to about 3 in 4 days.  this was 
done over with yeast that was eased into it over time. 
 
good luck 
joe 
 
from my usage this yeast is a strong fermenter.

In digest #2269, Brendan Oldham asks about buying a CO2 cylinder used. 
 
The latest date on the cylinder is the test DUE date, sounds like you'll 
need a fresh hydro test.  When you do get your hydro test, and before 
filling, ask that the cylinder be purged with nitrogen.  This will get 
rid of residual moisture in the cylinder, reducing corrosion from the 
inside. 
 
As for the price of the cylinder, you didn't say what size...I'd tell 
him you want a cylinder with a current test date...

Bogus all-grain elitism again. 
 
Serious extract brewers do not use 'extract from various manufacturers'. 
 
They use the *same* extract for re-creating the *same* brew.  I don't use 
say, Briess amber for one batch of brew 'x' and Laaglander amber for another 
batch of brew 'x'.  (Caveat unless I am *delibrately trying* for a different 
effect.) 
 
Grain brewers do not use 'just any malt', they use specific ones.  Why do 
you assume extract brewers do any different?

Wait a bit until he has amber in stock.  Or order from another supplier. 
 
In any case record the brand of amber you use so as to be able to duplicate 
the brew later. 
 
If you do 'make' your own amber, the crystal required to make it is above 
and beyond any required by the remainder of the recipe.

Subject: Sake and Koji


Mr. Penn, 
 In answer to your questions about sake info and the koji: 
 
I would recommend the book "Sake USA" by Fred Eckhardt.  This book is 
very well written and covers well this very involved style of beer/wine. 
 The book also gives info on brewing other rice based drinks found 
throughout the Orient. 
 
The book also gives addresses for companies that sell the highly polished 
rice needed along with suppliers of koji, and sake yeast (Sake var Yabe). 
Any homebrew supplier can get this book easily, the sake yeast from 
Wyeast labs, and the koji from the listed koji suppliers. 
 
About the H.B. stores high prices (I'm not defending him) but I know that 
the prices of barley has risen dramatically around the world (Bad 
domestic crops, and increased demand) and the British Gov't has stopped 
subsidizing the malt industry, as a result malts have been rising in 
price.  I (being the owner of a H.B. store) have held my prices and 
dropped a few since I have opened, but I don't know his/hers situation. 
If they are chargeing over $10.oo for 3 lb. dry/3.3 liquid malt extract 
(8-9.00 for bulk) they are charging too much.  Look on the internet for 
online cataloges, and also look at Zymurgy, Brew your own, Brewing 
Techniques... for mail order.  They have better prices due to low 
overhead as compared to a store front H.B. store. 
 
Good luck and good brewing,

Subject: Spargless, singlevessel, archi_RIMS


This is the Second Posting the first got bounced because of the dreaded 
"test" word in the subject line. 
 
sorry for the confusion> 
 
 
Sunday afternoon was the first grand test of the single vessel- spargeless- 
archi RIMS system. 
 
The equipment, 
1... 100 lit stainless kettle sitting on 
2... multi mega BTU Italian propane fire (not the jet style) 
3... grain basket inside the kettle made from 60 lit plastic barrel with 
1.5mm perforations and a with central mounted Archi-RIMS pump 
 
The process 
1... raised 45 lit water to 57C 
2... doughed in 12.5 kilo grain & started pump 
 
 
The results 
1.....pump didn't work! 
2.....wasted 30 mins figuring out that the wiring had been reversed when I 
replaced the brushes yesterday, and in finding another screw driver small 
enough to change the wiring. (spouse had gone out with the first small 
driver in the car) 
3..... turned fire up after 20 mins because temp was falling below protein 
rest level, 
4..... pump would prime, run for a few seconds and fail, 
5..... twisted knob off pump speed controller whilst venting frustration 
6..... concluded that heat on bottom of grain basket was allowing it to sag 
below the 1cm spacers and settle flush on bottom of kettle. Therefore inlet 
to pump blocked, therefore no recirculation, 
7.... rigged up rope and pulley arangement to elevate grain basket off 
bottom of kettle 
8.... pump starts to run flat out 
9.... throttle pump back before grain bed could become compacted and impervious
10... wake to fact that fire still roaring away far too fast 
11... underlet temperature boiling, mash temperature over 80C 
12... enzymes well and truly killed 
13... experiment a failure. 
 
had home brew and considered relaxing 
had another homebrew and got closer to relaxing 
 
conclusions 
I still believe the system could and will work well. 
 
I'll gamble one more another bucket of grain trying to prove the system 
 
 
Best brewing to all

Subject: Re:HSA


I sent a request for information on HSA, last week, but it appears to be 
lost as a "none".  I repeat it briefly as I will shortly be starting my 
first whole grain batch. 
 
1. Do you need to worry about HSA caused by splashing etc between mashing 
and commenceing the boil? 
2. At what temp can you start to aerate after boiling without worrying 
about HSA? 
 
Many thanks

Subject: Children / Saftey / brewery


A recent posting cautioned brewers who are parents to be very cautious 
concerning potential hazards to their children. 
 
At greatest risk are visiting children, especially those of parents who do 
not normally "do things" in their garage. ie children who are not aware that 
adults working can involve dangers, to curious fingers and boisterious play. 
 
 
BREWERIEs are especialy dangerious, iodophors in Coke bottles, caustic 
solutions, alcohol, gas, fumes, and most dangerous of all boiling solutions. 
Solutions that are frequently precariously balanced on some home-made pedestal.
 
Beware also glass carboys left in the path of a speeding tricycle or child 
chasing the dog chasing the child. 
 
Grain at mashout temperatures is capable of inflicting life threatening 
burns to small people and some home brewers' idea of what constitutes 
adequate electrical safety would bring tears of delight to ligitation lawers. 
 
We must all look at our operations and ensure that they are child proof. We 
cannot rely on quarantine because someday someone will leave the gate open. 
 
Just a thought 
Not beer 
But important to brewers never the less. 
 
I twould tame more than a homebrew to bring on relaxation after scalding a 
child.

Subject: A complement, a few questions, and a funny one...


First of all I would like to thank everyone on the home-brew digest and = 
rec.crafts.brewing for what I have learned over the last five weeks.  I = 
have been a beer aficionado for years, but a few weeks ago I decided to = 
take the plunge and make some of my own.  I went out and bought a couple = 
of books for the basics, but I knew the only place I would pick up the = 
subtleties of brewing would be a mailing list or a newsgroup.  And I was = 
right!=20 
 
There is one down side to the home-brewing thing...my wife recently said = 
to me that "If you are smart enough to make you own beer, you are smart = 
enough to make dinner!"  OOPS! 
 
That said, I would like to ask a couple of questions... 
 
I brewed my first batch, a stout, a month ago (with an Irish ale in the = 
fermentor right now) and I opened my first bottle this weekend.  It = 
turned out better than I expected...it is actually quite enjoyable, = 
though Guinness has nothing to worry about, for the moment ;-)  The only = 
thing I am disappointed about is its body (mouth feel?),  it seems kind = 
of watery.  Is this because=20 
a)  "That's how a stout is suppose to taste, you have just been spoiled = 
by Guinness",=20 
b)  "It hasn't aged enough", it was in the primary for five days, = 
secondary for  ten days, and two weeks in the bottle. 
c)  "You can't expect miracles from an extract" 
d)  "None of the above" 
I know watery is kind of subjective, it feels like (even kind of taste = 
like) Murphy's, but nothing like Guinness or even Sam Adams Cream Stout. 
 
For my third batch I'm going to use some liquid yeast.  Last week I made = 
up some sterile wort for a starter, and canned it a la Miller's "Brewing = 
the World's Great Beers".  Everything went well and I am excited about = 
trying out liquid yeast.  My second question comes from the fact that I = 
used Laaglander DME for the wort.  I have learned since that Laaglander = 
extract is high in non-fermentables.  Is this a bad thing for a starter? = 
 I would think so.  If it is, should I: 
a)  Not use it. 
b)  Use it, but use a different extract next time. 
c)  Relax, don't worry... 
 
Today I was perusing through a kitchen stuff store at the mall looking = 
for brewing fun stuff and I came across a digital thermometer with a = 
temperature probe on a long wire.  I think it would be great because I = 
could keep it in my cooling wort, and would only have to expose enough = 
to use my cooler.  Does this sound like it would be a good idea, has = 
anyone tried a "remote thermometer"?  Would it be useable when I get = 
into all-grain? 
 
Finally, speaking of all-grain, I am planning on doing two or three more = 
extract, then one or two partial-mash, but after that I want to try my = 
hand at all-grain.  What I want to know is whether this is a good first = 
time mashing system.  I want to get a 10-gallon Gott cooler, and an = 
EASYMASHER designed to fit the Gott cooler.  Is this a reasonable = 
first-time all-grain setup, or should I be looking at something simpler. 
 
I hope you all find this as humorous as I do...In my newspaper's travel = 
section today there is an article about taking a trip to Ireland.  = 
Naturally the story talks about Irish pubs and Irish beer, but obviously = 
the author new not of what she spoke: 
 
"It takes a while to get used to Guinness.  This beer from an Irish = 
family of brewers is heavy and good in winter; but the first pint is the = 
hardest to get down.  Stout is a heavy dark-brown beer, somewhat like = 
Guinness, but with less calories.  Ale is a red beer, made from malt and = 
hops.  Lager is a yellow regular beer that has been aged for several = 
months.  Shandy is a mix of lemonade and beer and is popular in hot = 
weather." 
 
Hum, learn something new everyday! 
 
Thanks again!  I hope some day I can be as much help to others as you = 
all have been to me.

tim, 
 
welcome to the club! you can use some dextrine or CaraPils (TM) malt. up to 
about 1/2 pound if you're making a strong stout. grind it up and soak it in 
150F water for 20 min or so. this malt has unfermentable sugar and protine 
which will contribute body, mouth-feel, and head retension. 
 
i started making all-grain beer after i made several extract batches. i 
would probably not have made the switch were it not for the great advice 
from the collective. i think it's a lot more fun, but that's just me. 
 
btw, i thought the story you reported was great!

This should be more readable! 
 
Saturday, at a Maltose Falcons club brew, (a Lambic-style), 
led by Maribeth(MB) Raines-Casselman we ran an experiment 
to compare the effectiveness of pure oxygen to pumped air 
for oxygenation of wert prior to pitching yeast.  We 
measured three five gallon batches of wert from the same 
boil all with gravity of about 1.053 at about 22 degrees C 
using a laboratory instrument. In each case the starting 
level was on the order of 0.5 parts per million (ppm). 
A 2 to 4 micron stainless steel air stone was used. 
For a control batch we pumped air through a filter using 
an aquarium pump into a covered plastic fermenter. 
After 35 minutes the level of Oxygen had risen to only 4.7 
ppm. Into an identical fermenter we ran Oxygen through the 
same filter and stone for one minute. At the end of

I was a skeptic about using pure O2 before the experiment, 
now I am totally convinced.  The time savings, level of
