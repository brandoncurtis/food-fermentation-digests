Subject: Specialty Malts in Mash?


A couple of HBDs ago, someone asked whether it made sense to add specialty 
malts (eg, crystal, caravienne) to the mash. I hadn't thought of that, but 
since these malts are already converted to sugar, they probably don't do any 
good in the mash.  The question is, do they do any harm?  I typically start 
with 8-10 lbs pale malt, and then add 1-3 lbs of these malts, depending on 
style. 
 
I haven't seen a response to this post, and am wondering about the opinions of 
the collective.

Yeah, but also I don't think that anything could live in nearly pure O2, so 
that it's a lot cleaner than aeration, especially in the warmer 
months/climes.

Subject: Weyerman Malts


     Hi! 
 
     Somebody mentioned Weyerman malts in the last digest.  I just thought 
     that I'd mention that they have a really cool selection of interesting 
     malts, some of which I recently acquired (but have not used yet). 
 
     The list includes: Light & dark Munich, Dark Wheat, Cara-wheat, 
     chocolate wheat, Cara-rye, chocolate rye, smoked malt, etc. 
 
     Basically, anything you can thing of, and then some (remember my 
     penchant for hyperbole...). 
 
     I know you can get them from Hop, Skip, and a Brew in Queens, NY.  He 
     mail orders, too.  Phone # is 718-821-6022.  I have no commercial 
     affiliation, but I am friends with the shop owner (no, I won't even 
     get free stuff for this plug, I'm just sharing a good source of 
     interesting malts).

Subject: RE:  ESB troubles


     Hi all! 
 
     Sorry, I forgot to sign my post about a source of Weyerman malts. 
     Oops. 
 
     There was a question about ESB in the last issue (sorry, I don't 
     recall the name of the poster).  He had a long list of possible causes 
     for "that homebrew taste" in his ESB. 
 
     The things that caught my eye were the complaints of thin body and 
     solvent flavor.  Thin body can come from too long a protein rest at 
     too low a temperature.  You need medium molecular weight proteins to 
     give body to a beer, so you don't want to degrade them too much with a 
     protein rest between 113-122F. 
 
     Solvent flavors can come from too high a fermentation temperature. 
     Excessive esters can also come from this. 
 
     Wyeast 1028 is specifically mentioned as a potential problem.  I have 
     used this yeast many times.  The only time it didn't perform well was 
     when I under pitched and didn't aerate: more banana than a Weizen, and 
     some harshness, too! 
 
     The recipe seemed a bit odd for an ESB.  When you say 2-row, do you 
     mean pale ale malt, or pale (lager) malt? 
 
     Try using pale ale malt and no protein rest.  Pitch a lot of yeast and 
     aerate well.  Proper pitching and aeration will also help you achieve 
     a lower final gravity. 
 
     Remember that you want to have high levels of diacetyl in the final 
     product (buttery aroma). 
 
     Does anybody have good ideas on achieving this? 
 
     Have fun!

Subject: Re: Problems with Mash Temp. 


Well, if I do the simple math, ignoring things like the fact that your 
cooler absorbs some heat, I get: 
 
 (170*1* 9 + 212*1*1 + 9*.4*70) / (1*9 + 1*1 + .4*9) 
  = 146 
Assumptions: 
 Specific heat of water is 1 
 Specific heat of grain is 0.4 
 Mash tun absorbs no heat. 
 
The first thing to note is that the predicted temperature is not 152. 
It takes a few minutes for the temperature to settle after mixing, as 
heat diffuses into the center of your grain chunks. 
 
The second thing is that the last assumption is clearly false.  The 
mash tun will absorb heat from your strike water and will lower the 
achieved temperature. 
 
The math on your second addition: 
 (138 * (10*1 + 9*0.4) + 212*1*4) / (10*1 + 9*0.4 + 1*4) 
  = 154 
 
Pretty close to what you got, again, ignoring  heat absorbed by the 
tun.

 Tim Dugan writes in with a bit from his local paper: 
     -- 
     "It takes a while to get used to Guinness.  This beer from an Irish = 
     family of brewers is heavy and good in winter; but the first pint is 
     the = 
     hardest to get down.  Stout is a heavy dark-brown beer, somewhat like

     weather." 
     -- 
to which George de Piro responded thusly: 
 
     I find this sad and disturbing, not humorous.  Think about how many 
     people read that and thought that they learned something about beer! 
 
     People tend to believe what they read.  The beer in this country (USA) 
     would be a lot better, cheaper, and more diverse if people actually 
     knew something about it. 
 
and then, my $.02: 
 
I agree, George, but it isn't just beer.  It's very common (for me, anyway) to 
read some article, usually in a newspaper FWIW, that is written by someone 
totally ignorant of the subject matter and is poorly researched.  The first is 
excusable, the second is not. 
 
We just saw the same principle at work in the recent Dateline "article" / A-B 
Infomercial on micro-breweries.  Just think; how much of the rest of it (that 
we don't have intimate knowledge of) is total nonsense?  Count on the news 
services to keep you informed and educated?  Sure.

Do it by taste.  Pour a measured, small amount of the beer into a 
glass, then add the Chambord using a medicine dropper (or one of those 
syringes they sell for giving liquid drugs to babies).  When you get a 
good tasting combo, you can scale up to whatever quantity you want to 
flavor. 
 
Thus: if you started with 4 oz of beer and added 10ml of Chambord to 
get the desired flavor, for a gallon you'd need 320ml of Chambord (4oz 
* 32 = 128 oz = 1 gallon, 10ml * 32 = 320ml).

Subject: Weyermann Malz


Bob asks about Weyermann malz: 
 
<The local (sort of) shop now has Weyermann beechwood smoked malt.  The owner 
<is not sure how strong it is, since he just got it in and hasn't tried it 
<yet.  He suggested 1 lb in a 5 gal batch to to start. 
 
< Has anyone tried this stuff?  How smoky is it? 
 
Ive brewed with Weyermann smoked malz and it is not too overpowering. 
Beechwood smoked malt is much more mellow to work with than say Peat 
smoked malt.  Ive made a pilot batch of Rauchbier using 94% Weyermann 
rauchmlaz as base.  Not overpowering but readily evident smoke. 
 
<He has a bunch of other Weyermann malts too, such as the Munich malts and 
<some of the crystals.  Anybody have experience with these malts? 
 
Victory Brewing uses these malts almost exclusively.  I find them to 
be very comparable to the best German malts available, certainly in 
the same league as Durst.  Weyermann provides a very extensive line 
of malts including caraWheat malts in both ligh and dark caraWheat. 
If you want a big malty Festbier then the Munich malt is a good choice 
with a decoction mash.  HopDevil IPA gets a lot of its malt character 
from Weyermann Vienna malt.  And St. Victorious Doppelbock was just 
brewed at Victory Brewing with loads of Munich malts.  Try them out, 
they do make a distinctive more authentic (continental) product and are 
light years above the quality found in US domestic malts, specialty 
malts in particular.  Buying better malt does make a better beer. 
 
Prost!

You've got a wort chiller, but maybe there's aeration at other parts of the 
process.

Greetings all. 
 
Has anyone tried to use a drill-powered pump to transfer

yesterday and saw one for a few dollars.  Probably not good 
for a thermodoohicky-controlled RIMS; but to move hot water

Yeah, I tried to clean a pickle bucket or two before I saw the light. 
Buckets can found easily for free at most bakeries or doughnut shops. 
They get cream filling, fruit filling and stuff in 5 gallon buckets 
and are happy to give them away.  They're food grade and with just 
a little cleaning they can be used for many brewery purposes, with no 
aftertastes.

Skip, 
I've made a number of ginger beers, including a couple for holiday-type 
warming.  In general, I use ginger and other spices as I would finishing 
hops.  You may add some at 15 min before flame out, 0-5 min before flame 
out, or steeping at the end of the boil.  As with hops, each addition 
results in different flavors/aromas.  The later in the boil that you add 
them, the more aroma you get.  For ginger specifically, I would use 1-2 oz 
if you want some but not too much ginger flavor, say, equal amounts split 
between 15 min and steeped.  If you want more pronounced ginger flavor use 4 
oz, split the same way.  As a note of caution, ginger is a powerful spice. 
 It can over whelm a beer.  If you're not sure if you and your friend like 
ginger, I'd suggest starting out with less.  Also, if you want the ginger to 
blend with other spices, like cinnamon, nutmeg, etc, use a lesser amount.  I 
chop my ginger into little bits, you could probably grate it and get the 
same result.

I was intrigued by the recent discussion of brewing pseudo-lagers 
without traditional lager yeasts.  I'm curious whether those who've done 
it think that a Munich Dunkel or doppelbock could be brewed successfully 
with one of the California Common (Steam) yeasts, like the Wyeast 
strain.  That strain produces fairly malty beers, which seems 
appropriate.  What do y'all think?  Private email is fine.

     Hello all! 
 
     I just wanted to let people know that a new brewery has just begun 
     shipping product in the NJ area. 
 
     The brewery is called "High Point Brewery" (although they're actually 
     in Butler).  They claim to be America's first exclusive German-style 
     Wheat beer brewery. 
 
     They make 2 beers, Ramstein Blonde and Dark.  They are only available 
     on tap in some NJ bars at the moment. 
 
     The blonde is a good Weizen, with all the banana and clove you would 
     expect.  Not at all a bland American wheat! 
 
     The dark is a more subdued in the ester and phenolic departments, and 
     the roast malt is actually pretty up front in the flavor profile.  An 
     interesting interpretation of the style. 
 
     They decoction mash and use open fermenters.  The beer is definitely 
     worth trying. 
 
     As usual, I have absolutely no commercial interest in this.  Just 
     hoping that some people in Northern Jersey might get excited about a 
     their new neighbor!

     O.K., brain lapse time, so I'll ask the collective oracle: 
 
     With a 9 lbs. grain bill (for a 5 gallon recipe), mashed in 2 1/2 
     gallons water, and sparged with 4 gallons 170F water, why did I only

     about 1.002 - I know, I know, don't go below 1.004, but there was this 
     great article I was reading).  One other thing (isn't there always?!); 
     I mashed in the night before, and left it sit overnight in the 
     insulated Gott cooler.  Over 10 hours, it lost about 20 degrees. Any 
     affect? 
 
     Am I wrong to assume I can sparge any recipe to 6 gallons in the 
     kettle (and therefore 5 gallons in the fermenter)? After adding water 
     to go to 6 gallons, my O.G. was 1.048 (within range for an ESB 
     (1.046-1.060).  Any sparging help gratefully appreciated. 
 
     TIA - Greg Carter 
 
     P.S. to Terry Selba - What's IMBR? 
 
     P.P.S. I think animal testing is a terrible idea; they get all nervous 
     and give the wrong answers....

Subject: Glycerol in freezing yeast


Having searched the archives of the HBD, I have seen multiple references to 
glycerol in the long term storage (read: freezing) of yeast.  Is there a 
commercially available source of glycerol somewhere?  Otherwise I have to 
go to the university's chem stores department and fill out paperwork till 
my skin falls off.  Apparently purchasing chemicals is not an everyday 
thing there. 
 
Any help is appreciated

Subject: Varying bitterness in a single batch


I just started sampling my first attempt at brewing (hopped extract 
with some additional hops at the end for aroma), and am fairly 
impressed with how it turned out.  My wife and I have noticed however 
that the bitterness seems to vary quite noticeably between bottles. 
The beer was siphoned into a priming bucked and before bottling, and 
there doesn't seem to be any sediment other than that from the yeast, so 
I don't see how this could happen.  The only thing that I've noticed 
is that the bitterness seems to be stronger in bottles that haven't 
been refrigerated for as long.  Any idea what might be happening?

Hello All, 
 
    I'm considering buying a pump to re-circulate mash runnings up to

Hello Brewers!! 
Been lurking the list for a while-now I finally have a question! 
I am an extract brewer and my question is, should you or shouldn't you rack 
the wort off the hop pellet and/or spice-herb residue from the boil before 
primary ferm.? 
or should you just dump the whole lot into the primary and then when ferm. 
is over rack off into secondary leaving all the hop pellet and etc. behind. 
Sound confusing? Well I am 
Thanks to all in advance

Subject: Aseptox - One Step - Sanitiser


Hey gang, 
 There's this stuff here called Aseptox. I think in the US it's 
called One-Step. Does anybody know how it works or what the chemical make 
up of this stuff is? H2O3 ??? 
 The way I understand how it works, it's supose to sanitise as it 
releases oxygen. Sort of like peroxyde I guess. It comes as a white 
"crystal like" powder that I mix with water. No smell, no rinse. How can I 
*really* know it's working?

I have had my Oatmeal Stout in the Secondary now for little over a week 
and I have noticed that there is some condensation on the top of the 
carboy. I have the cap on tight and the airlock filled but it's still 
there. Is it from the lack of C02 after the primary ferment ? Is this 
anything I have to worry about ? In the future, what can I do to prevent 
it if needed. 
 
Thanks all.

Subject: Deschutes/bottle filling


Question 1: 
 
 Does anyone know how widely distributed Deschutes beer 
is? I have some friends who just visited Portland and loved it. 
Now they're hoping to find it somewhere in the Southeast. I 
tried to find the brewery online, but the only links were no 
longer good. 
 
Question 2: 
 
 I just bottled a batch of beer using a Phil's Philler 
and felt like it injected a lot of air into the beer as I filled 
the bottles. Anyone else get this impression? I'd been using one 
of those plastic fillers w/ a spring loaded valve at the end, 
but it kept falling off and causing me extreme stress as beer 
suddenly flowed everywhere. I've already bought a new one, 
though. The Philler would explain why I got some oxidation 
comments on the last beer I entered in a competition. 
 
Thanks

     A friend has offered to make me a temperature controller for my

     (following was posted previously and showed up as "none") 
     Is anyone using the "no weld" false bottom-drain or thermometer 
     fittings from Stainless in Seattle? If so, how do you like them? Any
