Well, it's not food-grade, for one. I'm sure the seal would leave a taste 
and probably leach its lubricant into the hot liquor. I'd suggest spending 
the money and getting something like a March model MDXT-3. They're around 
$100, and well worth it IMHO. Any brand of magnetic-drive seal-less pump 
will do, but check to make sure it will handle the temps. Remember: If you 
pay peanuts you get monkeys... ;-)

Ideally, yes, you should syphon the wort off the trub; but don't be TOO 
concerned about it. My belief is that you should leave some crap behind 
every time the wort/beer is transfered, so by the time it gets into the 
bottle there's as little crap as possible. Allowing the wort to settle in 
the boiling kettle is a good start. Someone else can comment about 
whirlpooling. Personally, I use an EasyMasher at the bottom of my boiling 
kettle and use whole hops. I allow the whole thing to settle for about 
15-min befor running thru a CF-chiller. No trub and no syphon. RDWHAHB

Subject: Re: Oxygen diffusion in still worts


Brewsters: 
 
I'll say it in public, as I did in private. Thanks AJ for the very interesting 
experiments on oxygenation techniques. 
 
I agree with AJ that this discussion is of general interest to the readership 
here, so I pose my questions and comments below. 
 
AJ says:

DRB - Interesting, from your results (and I know they're only one experiment as
you said) I think you could conclude that there is a fairly healthy rate of 
equilibration ( no word mincing , please), however, I understand what you mean 
and agree with the direction of your comments in that it is not minutes. 
 
I guess we are talking about defining "long time". 
 
I know that if I pressurize a keg with CO2, it can come to equilibrium or 
nearly
so,  overnight.  Why wouldn't we expect the same sort of time frame for a 
similar volume of wort to do likewise with oxygen in the air? If anything, I 
would expect it to occur even faster since we have approximately 3 or 4 times 
the surface area of interface with a plastic fermenter as with a keg. The 20%pp
in air would reduce its rate from a head of pure oxygen, I believe by a factor 
of five,  so, based on the CO2 experience,  I conclude that in a day we should 
nearly see equilibrium, i.e. nearly 100% saturation of oxygen ( i.e. on the 
order of 8 -10ppm) in equilibrium with air. 
 
AJ says: 
>The rate of transfer of O2 into or out of wort depends 
>on the O2 partial pressure difference across the wort-air interface and the 
>area of this interface. 
 
I agree, in a freshly boiled and cooled wort devoid of oxygen, the pp 
differential should cause the rate of absorption at the surface to be at its 
maximum.  Rate of oxygen absorption into the bulk now becomes a transport 
phenomenon in which the oxygen at the surface has to difuse into the body of 
the
wort in a perfectly still wort.  Any convection currents or agitation would of 
course improve this transfer rate. 
 
> This is true for inflow as well as outgo so the

>about three hours for the DO level to drop from 66% above saturation to 58% 
>above saturation in the experiment. Water in the same pot should thus move 
>from 66% below saturation to 58% below saturation in about the same time. 
 
I agree that transport phenomena should be the same, but you are looking at 66%
saturation with oxygen trying to come to equilibrium with 20% oxygen in the 
air.
Not really the same ballpark as 0% saturation in equilibrium with 20% oxygen. 
 
However, if we look at how much oxygen was transported to the surface in three 
hours it is 8% of saturation in three hours.  Crudely, this suggests that at 
least 64% saturation of oxygen should be obtained just from sitting around for 
24 hours.  Underpitched worts sometimes sit this long.  I suspect the real 
answer could be higher. 
 
If you have the opportunity, why not try the experiment? 
 
Keep on brewin'

Subject: All-grain #2 bottled


 
Brewers, 
 
Last night I bottled my all-grain batch #2.  It was in primary for 
about 3-4 days and secondary for about 10 days (I was too busy to 
bottle).  I used the exact same ingredients as I did in my first 
batch, but mashed at a much lower temp (some of you may remember 
me as the hot-masher). 
 
All joking aside, I ended up with FG=1.011 from OG=1.05x.  Last time 
FG=1.024 (I think ... it was SWEET) so I am hoping that this brew 
will have more alcohol and a drier taste to it.  In a week or two 
I'll let you know.  It does have the same 'flavor' as my first batch, 
however. 
 
For my next batch, I am searching for a basic recipe that will get me 
a beer similar to Hale's Pale Ale (one of my favorites).  Does anyone 
know what style of beer this is?  I might use one of the recipes in 
the back of Miller's book (he calls them starting points, each trying 
to get a certain style of beer), but I need to know what style of 
beer Hale's Ale is. 
 
As usual, any comments and/or pointers would be great, 
 
Thanks, 
 
Barry Vanhoff

Subject: Draught hose length, Nitrogen and stout


In HBD 2271, Dave Burley states: "...hose length is irrelevant..." 
and "Even in a cooled hose, beer in the line will get foamy and 
deliver a spurt of foam at first." 
 
Hmmm. You might want to tell this to my draught system. It's not 
doing it right, I guess. 
 
Heating of the line is but ONE cause of foamy beer. The others 
include the beer hitting the glass at supersonic speeds because of 
too much pressure or too short a line length. Or by the CO2 coming 
out of solution to drive the beer in systems have the pressure to 
low, or too long of line length. 
 
Your "spurt of foam" in a static, refrigerated, balanced line is 
indicative of a pressure leak in the system or of the system being 
imbalanced to the the low pressure/long line side. It is just a 
showcase demonstration of the CO2 coming out of solution. 
 
"Standard" lengths and pressures work fairly well for many people 
since very few of us have special circumstance. Once you step into 
the realm of specialized systems, you'll understand this all too 
clearly. 
 
***************************** 
 
Also in 2271, Adam Back desires to drive his stout with a mix of CO2 
and Nitrogen... 
 
Why do you thinkyou need this? There is a lot of confusion out there 
regarding Nitrogen and why it is used. 
 
First, Nitrogen will not dissolve in your beer; therefor, in and of 
itself, a mix has no effect on the carbonation or heading of your 
beer. If put the same pressure in beverage gas as you would CO2, it 
can have a negative effect in undercarbonation. 
 
Guinness (and others) use mixed gasses to push the beer when a 
higher-than-desirable-for-carbonation pressure is required to drive 
the beer. In Guinness' case, it would be the faucet and velocity they 
require to kick up that incredible head. In my case it is the 35psig 
I require to drive my cold plate-based draught system. I carbonate 
with about 25psig at cellar temperature. 35 psig would clearly 
overcarbonate my beers. 
 
And that brings us to your final question - what mix to use. This is 
dependent on the temperature the kegs will be stored at, your 
carbonation pressure at that temperature, and the driving pressure 
you require. 
 
I carbonate at ~60'f and 25 psig CO2. I store my kegs for the draught 
system at the same temperature, but need 35 psig to drive it. THe 
additional pressure is Nitrogen to prevent overcabonation. This 
yields a mix of 25/35=71% CO2, 29% N2 (I actually use 70% CO2, 30% N2 
as it is "close enough" and easier to mix). 
 
See ya!

Maybe this is a good time for a review, a.k.a. "Why I gave away my Phil's 
Philler to dad for his wine-making and went back to a plastic filler." 
 
1- The valve in the brass jobbie does generate bubbles at the beginning 
and end of the fill. It is hard to tell whether this is CO2 foaming due to 
shear forces in the valve and warming beer, or whether it's air. It sure 
seems like air. 
 
Notwithstanding the uncertainty of point 1, the following convinced me: 
 
2- While ostensibly the brass filler lets you control the headspace in the 
bottle (because the valve is at the top and you are only immersing a thin, 
hollow brass cylinder), it is almost impossible to get a consistent 
headspace. Especially since you always get one last little burst of beer 
as you disengage the filler. You have to be an artist. 
 
3- The plastic fillers create a consistent headspace, even if it is a 
little larger than I'd like. You fill to the mouth of the bottle, take out 
the filler, and the headspace is exactly equal to the displacement of the 
filler. I let the bottles sit for 1/2 hour, covered loosely, before 
tightening down the caps. This allows time for the air in the headspace to 
be at least partially flushed with evolving CO2. All in all, it's a neater 
job which helps the flavor development and carbonation of each bottle be 
pretty much identical. 
 
4- One final observation... I found a plastic filler which uses a pressure 
valve instead of being spring-loaded. It's noticeably more sensitive (thus 
a little tricker to use) than the spring-loaded filler, but it makes a 
slighly smaller headspace and has a very simple (easily-cleaned) mechanism 
which avoids making all the beer flow through a little metal spring.

Why do I see frequent references specifically to R/O water? Is it somehow

>>5) is a mash-out necessary too?  (i think my friend anton just

> 
>Yes, to keep the composition of the wort constant during the sparge. 
 
I've wondered about this, in passing, for quite a long time.  I think 
that someone realized that mash-out temps would denature the enzymes 
and assumed that this was an important purpose of the mashout.  I think 
it's not. 
 
While mashing-out does make it easier to extract the sugars from the 
grain bed, I don't think that denaturing enzymes is really important 
at all.  Here's why (let me know if you think I'm on the right track): 
 
Either you want to make 1) a relatively fermentable wort, 2) a 
relatively dextrinous wort or 3) something in between. 
 
1) You mash somewhere between 148F and 152F or so and you let this 
go a long time.  You're trying to make a fermentable wort, so why 
would you want to kill *any* enzymes?  Why should you care if your 
mashout denatured enzymes.  If your conversion is not compleat, then 
at best you'll be leaving starch behind, *not* stabilizing the 
fermentability of your wort. 
 
2) You mash somewhere between 156F and 160F or so and you let this 
go for an hour.  After that hour, for all practical purposes your 
beta amylase is gone.  Whether you mash-out or not will not change 
the fermentability of the wort.  It was the mash temperature that 
denatured the enzymes that affected the fermentability and not the 
mashout temperature. 
 
3) You can either mash somewhere between 153F and 155F or you can 
mash for some amount of time at the low end (say, 150F) and then finish 
up with an hour at the high end (say, 158F).  In either case, the 
fermentability will be determined by the length of time the beta 
amylase was around, but at the end of the mash (and this is the 
important part) the beta amylase had better be pretty much denatured. 
 
Therefore, in all three cases, mashout would only be killing alpha 
amylase which does not change fermentability.  Another way to think 
about it is: if it mattered to you that the enzymes (which could only 
be alpha amylase) were still working after the mash was compleat, then 
there is *starch* remaining and you mashed-out too early! 
 
Right? 
 
*** 
Dave writes about yeast that he cultured from a Chimay bottle that was 
sluggish at cooler temps, but restarted at 77F: 
 
>Does Chimay use two kinds of yeast, one 
>for fermentation and one for bottling? Is their primary yeast made up of more 
>than one yeast with vastly different habits? 
 
I never made it down to Chimay, but rumour has it that Chimay is bottled 
with the same yeast as they use for fermentation.  Your restarting sure 
sounds like the yeast wanted it to be warmer.  Was your carboy sitting on 
cement?  Cement floors can be a whole lot cooler than the ambient air temp 
and direct contact a much better conduction than via air.  Could that have 
been the problem?

I have been thinking about kegging vs bottling.I currently bottle, and 
perhaps this is a rationalization, but it seems differance in trouble 
and time between bottling and kegging is 6 of one and a half dozen the other. 
Not trying to start a new thread (please), just pointing out they're both a 
labor of love. 
 
My question to the gadgeteers is as follows.  I have seen a lot of discussion 
on the uses of sankey kegs (are these "pony kegs, or 1/4 barrels?) for 
sparge vessels and boilers.  Can they be modified for kegging homebrew? 
Someone should be able to figure out how to attach a CO2 line istead of the 
hand pump.  Is cleaning the issue?  Are they just too cumbersome compared to 
cornys?  They do stack nicely. 
 
By the way I tried the first bottle of my Punkinhead Ale (brewed in the 
pumpkin).  It was the last 
bottle I bottled, and was a partial, so I cracked it at a week.  It was about 
what I expected, predominantly ginger and cinnamon, but had a good head, and I 
swear I could taste some malt.  It smelled like a slice 'o Pumpkin Pie.  After 
some mellowing, I think it should be yummy. 
Full report will be filed 1st of DEC. 
 
Oh- Jeff Kenton wonders where to find Glycerol.  Most pharmacies sell 
Glycerin, and Glycerol and Glycerin are one in the same; propane-1,2,3-triol. 
I have had good luck storing yeast in the freezer mixed half and half with 
glycerin.  Charlie says in NCJOHB to mix it to 10% glycerol, but if it freezes 
solid, the yeast dies.  50% produces a slurry at freezer temperatures, and the 
yeast seems to recover well upon warming and starter building.

absolutely true.  but i would say based on my own experience that the amount 
of bacteria etc. in the headspace of a 7 gallon fermenter with 5 gallons of 
beer in it is negligible, under normal homebrewing conditions (i.e., you don't 
brew outside near a sewage treatment plant or other source of heavily bacteria 
laden air).  all homebrew is infected, it's just a question of degree. 
 
now, the real issue is that a j delange showed via his own experiment 
(absolutely hard core, aj) that the assumption that o2 levels will drop to 
9 ppm in a few minutes due to outgassing is false. 
 
what total amount of oxygen is really required for an optimum fermentation? 
dave burley wrote a while back that an o2 saturated wort will be depleted 
by the yeast in a matter of seconds (at some nominal (hopefully normally 
encountered) yeast concentration).  ajd said he has seen 150% saturation 
levels depleted in a half an hour.  this is presumably at some lower 
yeast cell count? 
 
from aj's experiment, it is evident that yeast can survive relatively high 
levels of oxygen (35 ppm) for an extended amount of time.  the question is: 
what does this do to the beer?  yeast will refuse to ferment until all the 
oxygen is taken up, correct? 
 
can you improve your beer by using oxygen to keep your wort at some higher 
than equilibrium dissolved oxygen level for a few hours?  it seems that 
you might be able to supercharge their reproduction in the initial stages, 
causing them to reach their target cell count for fermentation of the 
volume of wort you have, then cut off the o2 so that they proceed directly 
into fermentation.  this would help minimize lag time, correct?   what would 
it do to the beer flavor?  if you supplied the o2 too long, you would actually 
extend the lag time, correct? 
 
it seems like there ought to be some sort of ideal relationship between amount 
of yeast pitched (initial cell count), total amount of oxygen provided,  and 
the time in which this oxygen is taken up by the yeast to produce the most 
desirable fermentation characteristics.  it may be that a slow supply of 
oxygen over a couple of hours is preferable to a huge dose right at the 
beginning.  it may be that 10 ppm right at the beginning is optimum. 
certainly this is yeast strain dependent, but there's probably enough 
similarity in yeast behavior that an ideal oxygenation schedule could be 
determined. 
 
 
lots of questions here, i know, but the answers to these are good to know for 
those of us using aeration/oxygenation methods or considering doing so.

I have no idea if this would work, but when you mentioned a motor on top of 
a lid, I immediately thought of the motor for an Ice Cream Maker.  I don't

Most ice cream makers even have a stirrer arm that attaches to the motor, 
and they can usually be bought fairly cheap, or at a garage sale.

Guinness is carbonated lightly in the keg and then dispensed 
with a blend of CO2 and nitrogen (N2).  The reason for the 
N2 is simply so you can have a high pressure dispense without 
overcarbonation.  It is meant to imitate handpumped beer 
pushed through a sparkler. 
 
The key to the system is that N2 is virtually insoluble in beer. 
In a typical Guinness mixed-gas system, you use 70% N2 and 30% CO2 
(you can get other mixes).  You run this system at say, 40 psi. 
If you used 100% CO2, you would get all foam, but since the N2 is 
not soluble, only the CO2 dissolves in the beer.  40 psi of 30% 
CO2 looks to the beer as if it was 12 psi of 100% CO2.  The beer 
comes out of the faucet with great velocity (as we wanted) through 
a perforated disk, but it is not as carbonated as if we had used 
100% CO2 to push the beer. 
 
Mixed-gas systems are used often on regular beers when the faucets 
are really far from the kegs.  You need 30 psi of gas to get decent 
flow at the faucet, but of course that will overcarbonate the beer 
if you used all CO2. 
 
All the "Pub Draught"/beers in widget tins are all carbonated 
lightly and then put into cans that are pressureized highly 
with nitrogen (in the form of liquid nitrogen, I've read). 
When you open the can a high pressure spray of beer/nitrogen 
is forced into the main body of the tin through a pinhole.  This 
stirs up the beer like a sparkler or the perforated disk on 
the Guinness faucet.

Subject: All-Grain Virgin - NOT


     Well I finally took the plunge into All-grain.  It went well, but not 
     completely as I expected.  It was a rauschbier from a recipe put 
     together by St Pat's of TX.  The recipe calls for 5# pils, 5# vienna, 
     and 1.5# rauschmalt all from Weyerman.  However, when I went to crush 
     the grain, it weighed at tad over 13#.  Since it was a gift, who am I 
     to complain. 
 
     Bob McCowan asked about Weyerman rauschmalt and with my experience,it 
     was definitely smoky at these quantities, but not sickeningly so.  St 
     Pat's also swears by Weyerman malts, but this is my 1st experience so 
     I will defer comment till I can taste the results. 
 
     I tried to duplicate Munich water with my high sodium water and did 
     pretty well.  Big kudos to Ken Schwartz and his Brewater calculator! 
 
     I did a double decoction mash following along with Noonan's new lager 
     book which was also a great source of info.  Unfortunately, I kept 
     having trouble hitting my temps.  I was always on the low side, so 
     there were actually a couple more small pseudo-decoctions thrown in 
     for good measure.  I hope the final product isn't too thin from too 
     much rest at too low of temps. 
 
     I used pH test papers which told me the mash was acidic.  How do the 
     rest of ya'll tell if pH is 5.4 or 5.6?  I could only really tell that 
     it was between 4.0 and 6.0 and probably closer 6.0.  The color legend 
     was only given in increments of 2 pH units. 
 
     I got ready to test for conversion and retrieved the iodine I had 
     asked my wife to buy a couple weeks ago.  Lo and behold, it was 
     de-colorized.  So it was off to the store for the real thing.  Of 
     course when I returned, conversion was complete. 
 
     Lautering was a breeze.  It was really incredibly clear.  I had to 
     adjust the flow as low as I could get it, but once I did, it cleared 
     right up.  A beautiful thing!  Tasted incredibly sweet to me. 
 
     Boiled for an hour and 15 minutes on the stove and hopped with 1 oz 
     Northern Brewer for an hour, 1/4 oz Hallertauer for 15 min and 1/4 oz 
     Hallertauer for 1 minute.  Next time I do a decoction mash, I will 
     definitely get the old cajun cooker down from the attic.  (Don't 
     worry, the propane is NOT stored with the burner.)  Cooled with my 
     immersion chiller (20' copper coil in an ice water bath, 30' in the 
     kettle water at full blast) and got a nice break.  Transferred to 
     plastic bucket and poured into another plastic fermenter in such a way 
     as to try to aerate.  I had to add about a gallon of make-up water to 
     get 5.5 gallons.  OG was 1.045.  Pitched Wyeast Bavarian in a 1QT 
     starter made with Munich LME at high Krausen. 
 
     At this point, I had intended to transfer the wort to my beer fridge. 
     Unfortunately, there was already a batch in there that I was supposed 
     to have bottled earlier in the day.  The wife surprised me with orders 
     to attend a birthday party for a couple of rug rats that we know and 
     we didn't get home till 6pm.  Therefore, I didn't have time to bottle 
     and brew.  So I let the newly pitched wort sit out overnite.  On 
     Monday, I bottled the lagered O'fest and transferred the rauschbier 
     into the fridge.  I'll let it go at 51 DegF until next Sunday and then 
     transfer to 2ndary.  After lagering and bottling, it ought to be ready 
     for the Superbowl! 
 
     So what did I learn?  Next to experience, planning is key!  And next 
     to Noonan's book, the HBD is undoubtedly the best source of 
     information and encouragement around.  Thanks everybody!!

Subject: 2 Yeast Types


Earlier in October I had posted a question regarding the attenuation 
characteristics of Wyeast 1968 London Special ale yeast. I was concerned that 
by using it
in an American IPA with an OG of 1.065 that it might have trouble getting it 
down to a nice final gravity near 1.010.  Didn't get too many responses to my 
querry about what effect adding a second yeast type like Wyeast 1056 after 
racking to a secondary fermenter would have.  Well, my experiment, though not 
truly scientific, has worked out fine.  The primary fermentation with a qt 
starter of the 1968 worked down to about 1.020; added a healthy and vigorous 
pint starter of 1056 after racking into a secondary fermenter and got renewed 
fermentation action for another week.  Don't know if the original 1968 would 
have continued to attenuate any more just from the additional oxygenation/ 
agitation from the racking process...I'll do that as another experiment with 
a similar recipe next year.  Anyway, to make a long post shorter (or longer at 
this point, depending on your perspective regarding signal/noise ratios!), I 
bottled last night and am very pleased with the final product.  We'll see what 
the club thinks at our upcoming Xmas party in December. 
One last thing:  Let's all raise a toast to the Digest for finally having a

*** 
An update on the Fill Level Experiment: 
 
To refresh your memories, I did an experiment back in January of `96 to 
determine if fill level really did affect carbonation level.  What I 
did was to brew an allgrain American Pale Ale (1.051 OG, 40 IBUs), prime 
the 5 gallon batch with 2/3 cup of corn sugar and bottle it in Anchor 
bottles on 26 Jan 1996.  Several bottles were filled "high," several 
"low," one "very low" and the rest "normal." 
 
On 18 March 1996, I had my wife randomly assign numbers to glasses and 
four bottles of various fill heights and pour the same amount of beer 
into each glass.  This was done in such a way that I could not even 
hear the amount of "fffft" there was from each bottle (and the amounts 
were obviously going to be different).  My blind tasting of the four 
beers, simply on the basis of carbonation showed: 
 
HIGH   (1.6 cm headspace): noticeably lower carbonation 
NORMAL (4.8 cm headspace): normal carbonation 
LOW    (6.6 cm headspace): normal carbonation 
V. LOW (8.7 cm headspace): possibly slightly lower carbonation 
 
I believe that the slightly lower level of carbonation was probably starting 
to be due to the fact that there simply wasn't that much beer in the bottle 
and nearly half the priming sugar was being asked to not only carbonate the 
beer but also fill nearly 6 ounces of headspace with CO2. 
 
Yesterday (12 November 1996), I again had my wife prepare three samples 
for tasting (HIGH, NORMAL, and LOW).  My blind tasting of the three 
beers, simply on the basis of carbonation showed: 
 
HIGH   (1.6 cm headspace): possibly very slightly lower carbonation 
NORMAL (4.8 cm headspace): normal carbonation 
LOW    (6.6 cm headspace): normal carbonation 
 
The bottom line in my opinion (although this was a single experiment), 
is that a high fill clearly slows the carbonation rate and may also very 
slightly reduce the final carbonation level in bottle-conditioned beers. 
Lower than normal fill level DOES NOT cause overcarbonation as suggested 
by Charlie Papazian in his NCJOHB and can actually result in lower 
carbonation.  IF, however, you overprime AND overfill, then yes, it may 
appear that underfilling causes overcarbonation, but actually, it is 
merely that overfilling is throttling the overcarbonation caused by 
overpriming.
