Subject: dry hopping w/pellets


Hi all.. 
 
A couple of weeks back I asked about dry hopping 
with pellets and got lots of good responses.  Thanks 
to all who took the time to drop me a note. 
 
I went ahead and dry hopped a batch of Sierra Nevada 
Pale Ale clone with 2 oz. of Cascade pellets.  They 
floated for the first day or so and then began falling. 
I also helped move this process along by gently agitating 
the carboy each day.  Eventually I moved the carboy into 
the refigerator and crash chilled it overnight.  This 
caused all the hops to fall.  I then added gelatin finings 
in an attempt to pack the hops down at the bottom.  I 
kegged her up the next day and all went well. 
 
I tapped it last night and was very pleased with the hop 
aroma and taste.  It's really got a nice citrusy/grapefruity 
taste which I love.  There were a few bits of hops in the 
first couple of glasses but now everything seems fine.  In 
fact, this is one of the clearest homebrews I have ever seen. 
Virtually void of any haze as far as I can tell.  This is a 
process I definitely will repeat. 
 
Hopheads unite!!!!

Sorry about the double post on Guinness... my system crashed during

the Message received message, I had already sent it again. 
 
*** 
In my previous post on diacetyl, I was not specific as to when you 
should aerate and for how long.  I suggest not waiting too long because 
you risk oxidizing your alcohols.  When your beer just reaches high 
kraeusen aerate once.  You can do this with an airstone or by racking 
the fermenting beer into a secondary, but contrary to the usual advice 
of running the siphon hose all the way into the bottom of the receiving 
container, you let the beer splash in there, aerating the beer.  Do 
this once, early in the ferment.

I hope I didn't cause confusion trying to answer Jeff Kentons' question about 
glcerine/glycerol by misspelling glycerine as glycerin.  I meant to spell it 
correctly:  GLYCERINE.  Glycerine and Glycerol are the same thing.  There. 
 
Al K says: 
" 
Therefore, in all three cases, mashout would only be killing alpha 
amylase which does not change fermentability.  Another way to think 
about it is: if it mattered to you that the enzymes (which could only 
be alpha amylase) were still working after the mash was compleat, then 
there is *starch* remaining and you mashed-out too early! 
                                                            " 
Perhaps, and this is a wild guess on my part, all the enzymes are stable 
below mash-out temps.  If so, enzymes inhibited at higher mash temps 
would reactivate in the collection pot in the absence of a mash-out. 
 
Oh- and Al?  you misspelled complete. 
 
Has anybody considered using those bottles of coffee flavoring they sell 
in the grocery store?  Almost any flavor you want:  Almond, hazelnut, various 
berries, you name it.  Perhaps a hazelnut flavor could be imparted by priming 
with a calculated amount of this flavor syrup:  Take a S.G. reading and 
calculate the weight of sugar. 
 
Any thoughts?

Does anyone know where can I get a 6000 Watt, 240 Volt electric heating 
element for a RIMS system (preferably stainless steel or 
inconel/incoloy) for a reasonable price ? 
 
Most of the commercially available ones have a zinc coating on them - is 
this a bad thing ? I remember reading recently that zinc was an essential 
element for yeast growth/function. Is it a bad thing to have it in your 
beer ?

In Digest #2274 
M257876`at`sl1001.mdc.com (BAYEROSPACE) wrote: 
>what total amount of oxygen is really required for an optimum fermentation? 
 
None if you pitch enough active yeast. The point of aeration is to increase 
yeast biomass and decrease lag time.

That depends a lot on the yeast strain. Some strains need lots of oxygen to 
perform 'normally', others need much less. In general, too much O2 will 
result in extensive aerobic fermentation and yeast growth, accompanied by 
the excretion of metabolic by-products such as VDKs, oxo-acids, fusel 
alcohols, and esters. Depending on the targeted style, this may or may not 
be what you want. 
 
>yeast will refuse to ferment until all the oxygen is taken up, correct? 
 
No, oxygen makes yeast ferment faster. See van Dijken, J. P., R. A. 
Weusthuis, and J. T. Pronk, (1993). Kinetics of growth and sugar consumption 
in yeasts. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, 63 (3-4), 343-52.

O2 decreases the lag time, but too much will result in extended aerobic 
fermentation and increased excretion of the by-products of yeast growth.

Ideally, one would pitch healthy, active yeast at the optimal pitching rate 
and be done with it. However, this is usually difficult to do, particularly 
for commercial brewers. During the yeast propagation phase of a brewery 
fermentation, unsaturated fatty acids and sterols are usually growth 
limiting for the yeast. These lipids are essential components of the cell 
membrane and if unavailable in the wort, they can only be synthesized using 
dissolved molecular oxygen. Therefore, brewers may either add sterols and 
fatty acids to the hopped wort, aerate the cold bitter wort, aerate the 
yeast culture during propagation, or use a higher pitching rate. Commercial 
breweries generally find it most convenient to aerate the cold bitter wort. 
Wort aeration increases the rate and extent of yeast growth and hence 
decreases lag time and results in a larger population of cells. This in turn 
generally leads to more complete attenuation and fewer undesirable flavors 
in the finished beer. However, if one pitches a fresh, healthy yeast culture 
of the optimal size, aeration is usually not essential and may even be 
undesirable in certain cases. Most importantly, the level of wort dissolved 
oxygen necessary to produce the best beer depends on the strain of yeast 
being used, its viability and the pitching rate, and the style of beer being 
made.

I don't want to jump in Al's case, but seriously, folks, one experiment 
does not a study make.  Among the many reasons for doing multiple 
experiments before jumping to conclusions is that they help cover 
a wide range of variables.  Right off the top of my head, I would say 
that temperature would be a big one here, as would time, neither of 
which could be addressed by one case. 
 
The other problem, of course, is that others have experienced very 
different results, and it's unfair to simply dismiss them as anecdotal. 
For one, I've noted repeatedly that severely under-filled bottles (the 
last one being filled, because I'm too cheap to pour out the last cup 
of beer) DO have noticeably excessive carbonation, as well as a strong 
tendency to oxidation and staling. 
 
Time to draw in the real chemists; I suspect the question has to do 
with gases staying in solution when there is available non-liquid 
space, but, hey, I just barely squeaked through high school chem 
class without blowing up the lab.  ???? 
 
Sorry, Al, but there are real risks involved in publishing too early.

When the sg of the sparge reaches 1.010 (or you can taste tannins) you 
usually stop sparging right....? 
 
My normal sparge wort temperature is approx. 150-160 F - should I wait 
until it cools to 60 F to take a reading or is the 1.010 reading at normal 
sparge outlet temperatures and does not need converting ?

Subject: "that homebrew taste"


You folks are lovely, 
 
I got so many responses as far flung as South Africa and Switzerland to my 
"homebrew taste" problem.  I would like to thank misters Gros and De Piro for 
answering on these pages.  If I put every one's suggestions to use I won't 
recognize me which is probably a good thing. I feel like I've been stuck in old
habits for years and now I hear ideas that will really make a difference. 
 
I have considered some of these suggestions before, but clearly they need more 
looking into. The hot-side aeration possibility really kills me because I think
it could still be a problem. And the bit about protein rest breaking down those
proteins too small making a thin beer, blew my mind, but I'll try 'no rest' 
next
time. 
 
As another point, I would like to emphasize Mr. De Piro's question regarding 
enhanced diacetyl levels.  How would you do it?  I've only heard of diacetyl 
rests, necessary for lagers to *remove* diacetyl, for that cleaner lager taste,
but to enhance it? 
 
And one question that I keep ignoring because I generally like my beers alot 
and
figure it's not a problem is this: Why is my wort at sparge time so cloudy? Is 
my 35 minute-sparge for 10 gallons too quick?  Is the conversion 
incomplete?(starch clouds?).  I re-cirulate all during the mash.  I don't see 
why I should have to continue for 15 minutes at mash out, any way it would 
still
be cloudy.

For the temp control, I would recommend just purchasing one.  They only cost 
about $30-35, plug it in and your done.  As for the false bottom, I use a 
Stainless in Seattle weld in place 12  screen for a hop/trub filter in the 
boiler.  This thing produces very clear wort into the fermenter.  For mash 
usage I would get the largest diameter holes available and you should have 
no problem.

I ve been using a March Manufacturing (Mod. MD-MTX3) for a rims system

about $130.

yes, they are expensive, in fact i think they are more than the $35 a sanke 
tap would cost. why not use corny kegs for homebrew and just buy a sanke 
tap for the commercial brews? i would also think that it would be hard to

just my thoughts. i have also found that even though my fridge only holds 
one corny, i can use more than one keg at a time, because the beer can sit 
in the keg at room temp next to the fridge ready to swap in for a nearly 
empty one.

Subject: beer systems


For all the questions on draught beer systems I hope this information 
clears up alot of the answers/comments made here concerning the 
professional dispensing of beer. 
 
1)  Remember the last time you purchased a keg of beer at your local 
party store.  You dispensed it with one of those hand pumps.  What 
happens is you pump air (the stuff we breath) into the keg and it 
forces the beer out of the "cobra head" tap.  Well, when the keg 
didn't get completely emptied the night before, you go tap another 
beer from it and the beer is completely flat and stale.  The effect 
of air on beer is well known.  Staleing!  The beer goes flat because 
all of the CO2 comes out of solution into the headspace in the keg. 
 
2) Commerical beer systems are comprised of several components but 
for this expose the three main units are the CO2 tank, the AIR 
compressor, and the AIR-GAS blender.  Basically what happens is the 
air-gas blender receives gas from the tank and what amounts to an air 
compressor,
mixes them and feeds them into the keg.  Now the purpose of the air 
is to force the beer out of the keg.  The purpose of the CO2 is to 
keep the fizzies in the beer (by creating a pressure balance between 
the CO2 in liquid and the CO2 in the headspace).  Additionally, the 
CO2 is heavier than the air and falls to the surface of the beer while the 
air remains at the top of the keg filling the ever increasing air space. 
 
3)  As for Nitrogen, the prevailing theory (as Mr. Babcock pointed 
out) is that nitrogen will not dissolve into the beer.  Additionally, 
nitrogen is inert and will not cause the staleing of the keg beer 
(again the prevailing theory). 
 
4)  As for a blend of gas in the tank, any gas supply would happily 
fill your tank with a blend of gas.  However, this strikes against 
commonsense.  The whole basis of a beer dispensing system is that 
gases will not mix.  Thus the CO2 is in contact with the beer and the 
air separates out in its own layer.  So apply that to a tank and you 
have the heavier gas settling to the bottom and the lighter gas at 
the top where the gas is dispensed. 
 
I don't claim to be an expert at beer system technology, however this 
is how it was explained to me by my Perlick rep.  And for those who 
don't know who Perlick is, they are the people who make the beer 
dispensing systems.  Additionally, they supply all the big boys with 
their brewery fittings, kegging fittings, etc. 
 
Anyone with additional input please feel free to add and/or refute 
any information.

I recently reveived the latest Williams Brewing catalog. They have a hand 
pump that fits on the gas side of ball-lock corny kegs so that one may 
take their kegged beer anywhere. Knowing that air is not good for beer, I 
have the following question. Suppose I were to fill the head space with 
CO2, then attach the hand pump to dispense. As I recall, CO2 is heavier 
than air. Would it them form a layer between the beer and air. Of course, 
I don't think that CO2 is impermeable to air, so it seems mixing would 
take place. Any thoughts?

Subject: Newer Brewer wants to understand this fermenting experience


Last Saturday I brewed my 5th batch.  I used a kit (what I used and my 
procedure are below if anyone is interested).  It seems that when I 
transfered to the secondary fermenter, the fermentation rate suddenly 
accelerated.  Can anyone explain?  If this is elementry, I apologize. 
 
Anyway this is what happened.  I measure the fermentation rate by the number 
of seconds between "burps" of the fermentation lock. 
 
3 hours after boil, it was burping every 6 seconds 
18 "      "    "     "  "    "       "   3    " 
28 "      "    "     "  "    "       "   3    " 
48 "      "    "     "  Stopped.  Over a 30 Min. peorid I detected no burps 
although there was still some positive pressure observing the level in the 
lock.
 
72 hours, I transfered to the secondary fermenter (6.5 Gal carboy) and dry 
hopped with 1/2 oz of Columbia pellets tossed in the secondary before 
siphoning.
 
After transfer to the secondary, 
0.25 hours, burping every 1 second (surface almost boiling) 
1.5    "     "      "     12 seconds 
12     "     "      "     52    " 
24     "     "      "     52    "  (That was last night) 
 
O.G.=1044 (at 78F) 
SG to secondary 1006 (at72F) 
 
I would like to understand what caused the secondary fermentation to take 
off at a faster rate than the primary fermentation. 
 
It seems a lot of the sugars were consumed already.  How could it take off 
like that? 
 
I may have introduced a little air (a very small amount) during the siphoning. 
 
Prior to siphoning, I took a few sniffs at the wort. If I got real close, I 
couldn't inhale.  I believe it was because of a very high level of CO2 at 
the surface.  I remember hearing that CO2 in the nasel passages turns to 
carbolic acid and signals the body to stop the breath.  Could it have been 
some other vapors? 
 
I drank the SG sample.  Nothing strange but my mouth experienced a sensation 
somewhat like that sensed when tasting wine.  Like a slight sharpness or 
chrispness. 
 
Other details: 
 
Mixture: 
 
3.3 lbs John Barleycorn's Pilsner---expiration date in 1998 
1.5 lbs DME  Munton's extra light 
1.5 lbs Corn Sugar (I know, I know, I should use all DME but I ran out) 
 
4 Qts H2O + one malt can of H2O (to flush the can) 
 
Boiled 15 Min. 
 
Cooled with 1 Gal. chunk of ice made from boiled water (I was going to ask 
if this was a bad thing to do in a post but I got pressed for time so I just 
did it). 
 
Siponed to Primary pail.  I held the outlet end of the sipon hose 3ft. above 
the  surface in the fermenter to get some air into the wort.  This always 
gives me a good "head" on the wort. 
 
Pitched the dry yeast that came with the kit onto the "head" in the pail. 
Waited until the head and yeast settled into the wort then stirred it in and 
sealed it. 
 
 
Comments Please, 
 
Private e-mail is fine.

Bryan, here';s what I did. By the way I got this idea from the HBD a few years 
ago. It works great as long as the mash is thin enough.  I can't tell you all 
how much the HBD has taught me about brewing the last couple of years. I read 
and read about going all-grain til I had to do it myself!! Last winter I set 
down and put together a 3 tier system with the steam injection and stiring 
motor for the mash. All of the ideas came from other on the HBD. I AM FOREVER 
GREATFUL!!! I mostly stay in lurker mode as I just barely have time to read the
HBD let alone append to it. A month or so ago I was about to sign off the HBD 
as the noise and useless appends were the most of the content. Then things got 
better!!! and today the HBD is once again a place where beginner and expert 
brewers can ask questions, get a serious answer, and not be chastized for 
asking. It is now a kinder gentler HBD, THANK GOODNESS!!! 
 
I have a 10 gal Gott cooler that I put a motorized stiring paddle in. It is 
powered by an Ice Cream Maker Motor. The motor is mounted to the top of the 
cooler lid by a couple 1x3 pieces of oak boards, with notches cut in them so 
that the motor sets on them just like it did on the ice cream bucket. Next I 
took a dip tube from a converted keg and drilled a hole in the top of the 
cooler lid that the tube would just fit into, The tube is larger at the top so 
it doesn't fall in.  Then I made a coupler from a wood dowel, 1 end is stuck 
into the dip tube and I drilled and put a set screw thru the side to hold it in
place,  the other end is cut square and fits the bottom of the ice cream 
motor. At the bottom of the tube I have a 1x2 x how ever wide a gott cooler is 
minus an inch for room to turn.  Flatten the bottom of the dip tube with a 
hammer and mount the board on it. I cut a thin slot thru the center of the 
board by drilling a small hole then using a thin saw blade to cut a slot.  I 
use 1.2qts water/lb. of grain and can stir this most of the time. I have had to
start the motor with a pair of pliers to start it turning.   I steam inject 
thru a slotted copper manifold for a few min. then plug in the motor to 
distribute the heat....works like a charm!

Subject: Bottle of what?


I have had an eye opening experience, that I was wondering if the 
collective could comment on. 
 
When I made a starter for my last batch, I had a little left over wort, 
so I proceeded to bottle it.  It only filled up the bottle to about the 
bottom of the neck (lots of head room). 
 
After about a month and a half, I was ready to use this bottle of wort 
for a new starter.  When I opened the bottle a very strong PPHHHST 
occured, followed by lots of FOAMING WORT flowing out the top (fortunatly 
I was over the sink at the time). 
 
Obviously it had been infected, even though I thought I followed a 
rigorous cleaning routine.  The funny thing about it, is the fact that it 
did NOT smell bad, actually it hardly smelled at all! 
 
Any clues, as to what caused it to, lets say, ferment?  If it was 
infected, should it not have smelled bad? 
 
I poured a very small amount into a glass to see the color better, and it 
about filled the glass up with foam.  What little did settle at the 
bottom, seamed to be a milkish brown color. 
 
And lastly, No! I was not brave enough to taste it (the sink was right 
there and it got dumped).

Subject: In-line aerator


I use a counter flow wort chiller taking wort directly from my boiler to my 
fermenting vessel (plastic, no infections, nuff said!) and until recently a 
fish tank air pump and air stone.  I use Chempro SDP for all my sterilizing 
but found that it appeared to cause the air stone to disintegrate (unless 
there's something odd about my ale!).  Does anybody have a neat set up for 
conducting the aeration "in-line" from a wort chiller rather than using a 
air pump/stone dipped into the fermenting vessel?  Alternatively, can 
anyone confirm whether Chempro SDP is the cause of the air stone's demise 
or perhaps suggest an alternative sterilizing agent, like bleach?

Subject: Smoky roasted barley/lager yeast at ale temps/hop aroma/2-day allgrain


Here's a couple more topics from two weeks ago that nobody commented on: 
 
Greg writes: 
     the Victory Circle recipe book).  An article on Scottish Ales (SAs)in 
     Brew Your Own stated that peat-smoked malt was mistakenly used in 
     certain brewer's recipes for SAs, and the brewer's ended up with 
     something they couldn't give away.  (BTW, the article noted that the 
     "smoky" flavor in the beer was actually from roasted barley). 
 
I believe that's incorrect.  Roasted barley gives beer a roasty/coffee-like 
flavour and not a smoky one.  Furthermore, I've read in *several* places 
that the "smoky" flavour in some Scottish Ales was from the yeast and not 
from any malt or grain.  "Smoky" is one of the phenolic aromas (along with 
"clovey") and there are a number of yeasts (Wyeast Scottish Ale, for one) 
that lend a "smoky" phenolic aroma. 
 
Regarding peated malt, I'm sure you've seen that there are various 
"strengths" available and some smoked malts (like Weyermann's Rauchmalz) 
can even be used for 100% of the grain bill. 
 
Frankly, I've seen dozens of important mistakes printed in Brew Your Own 
just like this one.

The concern Tim had was whether it's okay to make a Porter with lager 
yeast at 60 degrees.  The answer is... it depends on the yeast.  Some 
lager yeasts will produce a lot of sulphury aromas *during fermentation* 
at higher temperatures, but I've tried fermenting more than a half dozen 
Wyeast lager yeasts at ale temperatures with excellent results.  Wyeast 
American Lager (#2035) makes some wonderful raspberry esters when you 
ferment it at 68F.  60F seems like a fine temperature for Wyeast California 
Lager (#2112) which is reportedly the yeast used by Anchor for their Steam 
and *Porter*. 
 
You cannot ferment ale yeasts at the lower lager temperatures (40 - 50 F), 
but not because of off flavours, rather because they will just sit there 
and not ferment the sugars.  The size of the starter has a lot to do with it 
in the high 50's F to low 60's F.  Personally, I had a sluggish fermentation 
with Wyeast American Ale (#1056) when fermented at 61-63F, but I only used 
a 500ml starter in that batch.  Others have posted in HBD that they got 
great fermentations with #1056 even at 60F but they pitched much bigger 
starters.  The yeast actually generate heat during fermentation and I feel 
that this has a lot to do with why my results differed from others'. 
 
Finally, you can help out the ale yeast by wrapping the fermenter with 
an old parka or blanket.  This will hold in more heat.  Oh yes... put 
a couple of layers of cardboard between the fermenter and the cement 
floor -- it can be MUCH colder than the air and direct contact will 
conduct a lot more heat than simply air.

     First off a question on Hops.  While I really think Hops is great I 
     would like for some brews to have more hop aroma and little to no hops 
     bitterness for the sake of diversity.  I've tried some different 
     Hopping strategies with no luck.  Any suggestions Hop types etc. that 
     might give more aroma with less bittering. 
 
It's not the variety that affects whether the hops impart bitterness or 
aroma, but rather when you add them to the boil.  Hops boiled for only 
a minute or two will impart aroma and that's about it.  If you boil the 
hops for 10 to 15 minutes, you'll get a little bit of aroma, quite a 
bit of hop flavour and a small amount of bitterness.  Boiling hops for 
more than 30 minutes will boil away virtually all the aroma, most of the 
flavour and give you mostly bitterness. 
 
To get even more hop aroma, you can add the hops in the fermenter.  This 
is called dryhopping.  You will read here and elsewhere that you need to 
put the hops into a bag, but I don't.  For many years, I would simply 
toss the whole hops right into the fermenter when fermentation is just about 
over.  Two weeks is about the right amount of time to leave the hops. I 
prefer whole hops over pellets because they float.  Recently, I've started 
putting a stainless steel screen over the end of my racking cane so that 
I don't suck any hops into the bottling bucket or bottles, but for more 
than six years I simply racked the beer out from under the floating whole 
hops and rarely did any hops make it into the bottles. 
 
You will also read that some hops are only "bittering hops" and others 
are "aroma hops."  You can use any hop variety for bittering and/or 
aroma.  Some varieties' aroma are simply more accepted than others. 
John "Hopduvel" Isenhour once made 5 gallons of beer with a pound of 
Pride of Ringwood hops.  Yes, he even dryhopped with them.  The resulting 
beer smelled and tasted like a tree branch, but I would have to say the 
beer was "unique-tasting" and not unpleasant.

Many have reported this method to work, but if you must do it in two 
days, *personally*, I would try to do chunk 1 on Friday night and 
chunk 2 on Saturday morning (shortening the time between the two chunks 
to about 10 hours).  Leaving the wort sitting around for 20 hours can 
result in some nasties taking hold that will (of course) be killed in 
the boil, but can produce enough off flavours/aromas to be noticeable 
in the finished beer.  One example is lactic acid.  If you intentionally 
pitch a lactic bacteria (even a handful of grain) at the end of chunk 1 
you will certainly get a noticeable pH drop in 20 hours.  It may not be 
noticeable to the taste, but then again, it may.  Some vegetive aromas 
are known to be caused by what's called "wort spoiling bacteria" which 
give slight vegetive aromas and then are killed by the alcohol.  Their 
effect can be minimized (to below smell threshold) by cooling quickly 
and pitching a big starter.  Slow cooling and long yeast lag times are the 
usually the culprit.  If you must wait 20 hours, then put it in the fridge 
if you have the space -- this will slow down any life that did get into 
the runnings and minimize their contributions.
