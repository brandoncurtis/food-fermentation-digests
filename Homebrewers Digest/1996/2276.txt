Several people have responded that this may be a result of effects on the 
diastatic enzymes, particularly alpha amylase.  What Dave observed was that 
after he began adding calcium to his RO water the final gravity (FG) of his 
brews went up. 
 
To me this doesn't suggest an effect on alpha amylase (in which case I 
think he would see lower FG due to production by alpha amylase of more 
substrate for beta amylase and therefore more fermentability) but rather 
suggests an effect on the yeast.  I just know I have a reference on the 
effect of calcium on yeast floculation, and I've been looking for it for a 
week while this thread has been running but I can't come up with it. 
Anyway, I believe that increasing calcium improves yeast floc formation, 
and that this would explain Dave's higher FG in the prescence of increased 
calcium; esentially the yeast is dropping out a bit sooner and leaving more 
fermentables behind. 
 
If this is the case, then Dave should be able to get the FG back down by 
rousing the yeast.  Does anyone else recall hearing that Ca++ increases 
floculation?

I find it very irritating that I have to check to make sure that posts 
actually make it into the HBD.  A response from aob.org is no guarantee 
that the post actually will make it.  Furthermore, you will see a post in 
#2274 that refers to "my previous post on diacetyl."  Well, that previous 
post was probably a victim of the "[none]" bug or something.  I've fixed 
up this post so you don't have to refer back to my correction in #2274.

     The things that caught my eye were the complaints of thin body and 
     solvent flavor.  Thin body can come from too long a protein rest at 
     too low a temperature.  You need medium molecular weight proteins to 
     give body to a beer, so you don't want to degrade them too much with a 
     protein rest between 113-122F. 
 
     Solvent flavors can come from too high a fermentation temperature. 
     Excessive esters can also come from this. 
 
 
Actually, I believe that excessive amino acids can result in more higher 
alcohol production, so the two may be related.  A long rest between 113 
and 122F will cut a lot of proteins down to amino acids.  Losing these 
proteins will affect body and head retention and I believe that excess 
amino acids will increase higher alcohol production.  Comments? 
 
George also asked about how to increase diacetyl, that buttery aroma. 
While I don't think that neither Fuller's ESB nor Young's Special London 
Ale are as buttery as some other British ales (like Samuel Smith's or 
Bateman's), use a highly flocculent yeast (like Wyeast #1968 London ESB) 
and then aerate during fermentation.  Yes, that's right, aerate during 
the first part of the fermentation.  This will increase diacetyl production. 
I suggest not waiting too long into the fermentation because you risk 
oxidizing your alcohols.  When your beer just reaches high kraeusen 
aerate once.  You can do this with an airstone or by racking the fermenting 
beer into a secondary, but contrary to the usual advice of running the 
siphon hose all the way into the bottom of the receiving container, you 
let the beer splash in there, aerating the beer.  The highly flocculent 
yeast will drop out before reducing all the diacetyl it made and voila! 
Butterscotch beer!

Subject: Mash Efficiency Question/Problem


Hey Neighbors, 
With only four all grains batches under me I decided to down load one of 
those recipe formulation programs yesterday and run two of my recipes 
through it to see how I was doing on my mash efficiency and I.B.U. hop 
calculations.  To my chagrin I was considerably under the programs 
default mash efficiency of 70%.  One recipe was 42% and the other 
was 51%.  Trying to analyze why I am getting low efficiency I can only 
guess that 1) my hydrometer is off 2) I'm a piss poor masher 3) you tell 
me, please. 
I mash in a Gott cooler, single infusion around 155 degreesF, Klages as 
base malt, sparge with home made rotating Phil's arm, take hydrometer 
reading after boiling and chilling to 65-70 degrees. 
Is a 70% efficiency too much to expect after only four batches?  I really 
don't understand this efficiency stuff that well but I do like the beer I 
made but if I can do better I would like to learn how.  What of the big 
picture I'm I missing here?  If someone would like to take me to the 
sidelines and couch me on this I would sure appreciate it. 
TIA

Subject: Beer Filters


Ian Smith asks about filtering his beer. 
 
Assuming you keg the stuff right now, you're in luck.  Otherwise, I 
can't help you. 
 
I've got a partly-completed web page that should have enough information 
that you can figure out how to build your own filter.  Basically, it 
involves one of those whole-house filter units (maybe $15 at builders 
supply houses) with a 0.5 micron pleated polypropylene filter cartridge 
available from The Filter Store Plus (see ads in homebrew mags, $45 or 
so) and some other places.  You should be able to save a few dollars 
over buying the ready-made filter (and you'll have the satisfaction of 
having done it yourself...) 
 
Regarding the reusable vs. disposable filters - the one sold by The 
Filter Store Plus is a reusable one that you backflush after each use; 
I've done a dozen or so batches on it with no problem.  I tried the 
single-use disposable filters from Crystal Clear Products (also 
advertises in most mags, around $6 each) and was disappointed in the 
results (too much foaming and not enough filtering) so I tossed them out 
and went back to my permanent filter.  They may work for some people, 
but I wasn't one of them. 
 
Anyway, the filtering web page and all kinds of other homebrew gadgets 
are at

Regarding using CO2 as a protective blanket between air and your kegged 
beer........ 
 I have had good success using this technique with mini-kegs.  I 
have a combination tap which allows me to use either a CO2 charge or a 
hand air pump to dispense from the same keg.  I've frequently been able to 
use CO2 at first (creating a blanket of it above the beer) and then switch 
to the hand air pump.  Though the CO2 and air may mix, this usually hasn't 
been a problem over the course of one week.  I would assume you could have 
similar results with corny kegs.  Your mileage may vary.....and how 
couldn't it with all this snow?

Subject: Frozen yeast died


Hey Neighbors, 
This week end I couldn't take the suspense any longer so I thawed out 
one of my jars of frozen yeast that I put in the deep freezer from last 
brew season.  I opened an old can of extract and boiled it in 2.5 gallons 
of water, cooled and pitched.  Nothing!!! Dead, Still, Quiet after two days. 
This was my first attempt at freezing yeast.  I used London Ale slurry 
with 25% glycerine. 
Maybe I should have waited a few more days but I didn't so I tossed 
some dry yeast on it just to save the batch.  Maybe I should have step up 
the slurry but I didn't.  My whole reason for freezing yeast was for the 
convenience,  just thaw, decant the glycerine and pitch.  I really had 
great hopes for this process and I was really disappointed that it didn't 
work for me.  I have one jar left to experiment with so do any of you 
arctic yeast ranchers have any idea how I might proceed next time? 
 
Frozen but not dead,

Subject: Using weight for priming sugar


Hello all, 
 
I have been reading Dave Draper's and Mark  Hibberd's papers on using 
weight for the amount of priming sugar to add at bottling. This makes 
allot of sense to me. 
 
However, when I compare the figures that each give for calculating 
the amount of sugar to add, I come up with 2 different figures. 
 
Mark states: 
 
4 grams/l of sucrose will ferment to give 1 volume CO2 and that it takes 
15% more dextrose/glucose (ie 4.6 grams/l) to give 1 volume of CO2 
 
Dave states: 
 
3.7 grams/l of dextrose/glucose will ferment to give 1 volume CO2, and 
(working backwards from his formula) 5.822% less sucrose (ie 3.5 grams/l) 
 
 
I only use dextrose at bottling, so I'll use that in the following example. 
 
Beer - ESB, temp = 18 C, (64.5 F), desired volume CO2 = 2.0 
Batch size = 23 l 
 
Marks method works out to  (2 - .93)*4.6*23 = 113.206 grams 
Daves method works out to  (2 - .93)/.27027*23 = 91.05 grams 
 
To me this is a fairly significant difference of 22 grams or about 24% 
I would like to know which amount is more accurate in producing the desired 
volume of CO2 
 
Can anyone clarify this for me? 
 
Can anyone with experience using either of these methods tell me what kind 
of results they have had and which method they use? 
 
Thanks

Subject: Lightstruck Taste discussed


Hello, All. 
 
I was doing research in Iowa State University's Library Tiers and came 
across an article that may have some relevance to this forum.  It is 
entitled "The Action of Sunlight on Beer" and was written by P. Gray, 
I.Stone, and H. Rothchild of Wallerstein Laboratories, New York.  The 
article was reprinted from Wallerstein Laboratories Communications, Vol IV 
April, 1941. 
 
In general, these fellows found that the presence of free oxygen in beer 
which has been exposed to direct sunlight leads to increased "sunlight 
flavors."  Sunlight is a catalyst for the oxidation reactions. 
 
Interesting also is the fact that a weak iodine solution added to exposed 
beer completely neutralizes the skunky odor.  A 2 ppm copper solution also 
has this effect, but makes the beer so oxidized as to be undrinkable. 
 
The production of the sulphury compounds in the beer was found to be from 
the introduction of yeast into wort.  Yeast produce sulphury compounds in 
the process of fermentation.  Un-fermented exposed wort did not produce 
skunky beer when later fermented.  Read this as:  when unfermented wort is 
exposed to direct sunlight, it is not ruined.  Correctly handling the wort 
after the yeast is pitched is the main concern. 
 
Bottle glass color was also described.  Clear glass was worst, followed by 
green, and brown.  These researchers found that ORANGE or RED glass is the 
best for preventing UV light from entering the beer.   (Anybody ever seen 
an orange or red beer bottle? ) Brown is the best available alternative. 
 
In summary, do not incorporate oxygen into fermented beer.  Don't worry 
about exposing your WORT to sunlight.  The effects of skunking occur after 
the yeast have been pitched. 
Do not bottle your fermented beer in clear glass.  Orange and red glass are 
the best for storing beer, but amber is the best available alternative. 
Though a weak iodine solution can eliminate the skunky smell from exposed 
beer, do not try it.  (Iodine is toxic)  Same goes for copper in strengths 
greater than 2 ppm. 
 
I hope this blast from the past helps someone, or prevents them from 
tossing out an otherwise fine batch of beer

Although it's true that 'one experiment does not a study make', at least 
Al's single experiment had the advantage of being 'blind'.  This makes it 
*ONE* data point.  Unless the repeated experiments you related above were 
also done blind, I would suggest that they constitute something less than 
one valid data point, ie, *ZERO*.  Really, you can't measure carbonation via 
a non-blind tasting and report it as valid data. 
 
(BTW, Al, that's a pretty clever trick - getting your wife to serve you 
homebrew: "Honey, could you get me a beer? What? Why can't I get it myself? 
Ummm... its an EXPERIMENT! Yeah!) 
 
To add a theoretical (as opposed to experimental) slant to the argument, I 
can state that, if we consider simple liquid-gas equilibrium in a closed 
space, there is no reason why an underfilled bottle should exhibit higher 
carbonation. There should only be a minor effect on carbonation due to the 
fact that, as Al correctly points out, some of the carbonation is going to 
fill the headspace rather than staying in the beer. 
 
Additionally, there is no reason (within the realm of liquid-gas 
equilibrium) as to why an overfilled bottle would be undercarbonated, 
although Al claims to have noticed this effect.  One possible explanation I 
have heard bandied about is that the yeast still present in a freshly 
bottled beer are too 'pooped' to effect the carbonation. The oxygen in a 
normal headspace helps get them back on their feet, whereas the lack of 
oxygen in an overfilled bottle leads to a significant lag time before full 
carbonation is reached.  Note that this 'yeast effect' would not fall under 
the umbrella of "liquid-gas equilibrium", so my previous statements stand. 
This yeast effect lies outside the realm of my expertise (could you tell?), 
so I will leave it to others to debate whether this is a valid explanation. 
 
Jeff continues by adding that he has experienced, in underfilled bottles 
>a strong tendency to oxidation and staling. 
 
The reasons for this should be obvious, however they are not related to the 
gas equilibrium issues. 
 
>Time to draw in the real chemists 
 
Feh! I'm a real Chem Engineer, which is what you really want here. 
 
Of course, most of this discussion is mostly academic, there's really no 
good reason to underfill bottles, except for those of us too cheap to throw 
out the last half-bottle from a batch (and this would include me!).  And 
when we're being that cheap, we can certainly learn to live with a single 
bottle which is over- or under-carbonated, depending on whom you want to 
believe.

Sorry about the long post and breaking my rule about waiting for others

Before I comment, I'd like to point out that I am very much in favour 
(yes, f-a-v-o-u-r) of doing mashouts.  I know that they increase the 
extract efficiency (you get more out of the goods) and you decrease 
the likelyhood of a set mash (stuck laeuter).  I just don't believe 
that a mashout makes any *practical* difference in fermentability. 
 
I'm afraid your wild guess is wrong... enzymes are not all stable below 
mashout -- that's exactly why you can vary the proteolysis (a fancy word 
for cutting up proteins) and fermentability.  If you do a protein rest 
at 122F, both the peptidases and proteases are active for quite some time 
and they cut all the proteins down to amino acids.  If you do your 
protein rest at, say 140F, the peptidases are denatured quite quickly 
and only the proteases are active for any length of time.  These cut 
big (haze-producing) proteins down to medium-sized (head-retaining and 
body-building) proteins. 
 
Similarly, if you mash at 150F, both beta and alpha amylase are active and 
you get a lot of maltose and very few dextrins (highly fermentable wort). 
If you mash at 158F, the beta amylase gets denatured quickly and for most 
of the mash, only alpha amylase is active so you get less maltose and 
lots more dextrins (dextrinous, high-FG wort). 
 
There are many other enzymes some that are denatured even at 122F so that 
you need to do a rest at 95-100F to get anything from them. 
 
As for the spelling of compleat, visit the UK and ask them who is spelling 
it wrong... 
 
To paraphrase Dave Draper: "I'm not from there, but I love it there."

The beer was bottled in January and I tasted it in March and October. 
In the meantime, the bottles spent most of their time between 60F (winter), 
and 70F (summer).  I encourage everyone to repeat my experiment, but I 
ask that you do as I did: GET SOMEONE TO POUR THE BEERS FOR YOU IN ANOTHER 
ROOM.  When you open a low-fill bottle it makes a *huge* "FFFFFFFFT." 
This can cause a lot of bias... as a matter of fact, warn the person 
that some bottles will have a lot of hiss because they may be tempted 
(as any of us would) to dive for the sink after a sound like that!

Please try tasting those half-filled bottles "deaf" as Jacques put it 
and see if you may not have been swayed by the sound. 
 
>Sorry, Al, but there are real risks involved in publishing too early. 
 
No problem Jeff... you didn't call me names and you made some good points. 
Incidentally, I've done this experiment very informally literally a hundred 
times (I too cap that last 1/2-filled bottle) and I've found there to be 
no overcarbonation in the low-fill bottles.  This is just the first time 
I actually tried to quantify the depth of the headspace and did high-fill 
bottles too.  The high-fill experiment was indeed done by another poster 
before me.  Really, folks... this has to be the easiest experiment to do: 
next time you bottle, fill a few low and a few high... simple!

Subject: how long to sparge?/O2 cap sanitation/air dispense


Sorry again... I'll try to behave myself again after this post. 
 
Ian asks:

I stop sparging when I've collected the proper amount of runnings.  For 
5 gallon batches, that used to be between 6.5 and 8 gallons (depending 
on my mood and willingness to boil for hours.  As for tannin extraction, 
monitor the pH and acidify your sparge water if your water limits you 
to less than 6.5 gallons of runnings (i.e. the pH gets above 6 before 
you have 6.5 gal).  Now, I do 1/2bbl batches and my kettle limits me 
to about 18 gallons of runnings.

If you do go by SG, yes, you must compensate for the high measuring temp or 
(alternatively) cool the sample to 60F.

Sanitizing O2-absorbing caps can be done with iodophor or 200 ppm bleach. 
That's what the application engineer at Zapata told me.  One-step and 
B-brite will ruin them just as boiling will.

I've read about systems like this and frankly, I don't buy it.  CO2 *is* 
heavier than air, but gasses don't behave like liquids, in other words, 
they don't separate into layers.  I know that there are many commercial 
systems that use air compressors, but I suspect that it's important that 
the beer be kept at 33F like they usually do and you have to go through 
the kegs pretty quickly or the beer will stale.  The CO2 will initially 
sink to the bottom and displace the air, but if you put the CO2 and air 
together in the same space, they will mix into a homogeneous blend of 
gasses in a short amount of time. 
 
In Scotland, one traditional method of dispense is with an air pump. 
"Doesn't that oxidize the beer?" you may ask... yes it does.  The key 
is to buy no larger a cask of each beer than you can dispense in a day 
or two.  All over Britain, all the traditional methods of dispense have 
the beer exposed to air.  Slow-moving beers will tend to go bad which 
is why some suggest that cask breathers be used.  CAMRA diehards will 
say "no way" but I (a CAMRA member) believe that good beer is more 
important and I'm not as afraid of the "give `em an inch, they'll 
take a mile" syndrome as some of the opponents of the breather believe. 
(Ooops... a cask breather is a demand CO2 system which simply replaces 
headspace with CO2 as the beer is drawn out by gravity or handpump). 
 
>air separates out in its own layer.  So apply that to a tank and you

That's simply not how gasses behave... I also thought that initially, and 
it is intuitive, but really, gasses will diffuse into each other till 
their concentration is the same throughout the tank.  Really!

I don't think they require a degree in physics for sales positions at 
Perlick.  I know a local Perlick rep personally.  He's a nice guy. 
He used to sell suits at a big and tall shop a few years ago.

Subject: Multiple responses


I sent this last night but it seems that the "NONE" monster got it. Hope 
it gets out tonight. 
 
To the HBD, 
Here is my $.08 worth (4 responses at .02 each) to some questions on 
#2273. 
 
1) Weyerman malts:  Weyerman is the supplier of malts to Ireks, so they 
are one in the same.  Their quality is supposed to be second to none and 
I have been told that they are the suppliers to many German breweries. I 
too have just recently gotten in the smoked, caramunich, carafoam, 
carawheat, melanoidin, and carafa.  I'm looking forward to trying 
them....so little time so many malts. 
 
2) Ginger Beer (Re: Skip) I agree with Scott about using ginger, and the 
characteristics, make sure that you strain it out or else in the 
fermenter it will keep on spicing the beer and overpower it. 
Here is a mash extract recipe I have used in the past and it is very 
tasty and strongly flavored with ginger.  Give this beer at least 6 weeks 
to age.  Similar to some of the Jamaican "ginger beers" 
 
Ginger Beer: 
1/2 lb. Muntons Crystal malt (60L) 
1/2 lb. Muntons Carapils (10-15 L) 
"Mash" at 150 F. for 30 minutes. Remove grains. 
6 oz. Fresh grated ginger. 
Willamette hop pellets (4.3 alpha) 
Boil 45 min. 
1/2 oz. Cascade hop pellets (5 alpha) 
1/2 tsp Irish moss 
Boil 15 min. 
1/2 oz. Cascade pellets 
Turn off heat and steep 2-5 min. 
Sparge, bring to 5 gal. 
Ferment with Wyeast (#?) London Ale 
 
3) California Common yeast in uncommon beers.  After  having a lengthy 
discussion with the head brewer of 2 brewpubs in Florida, I used the Cali 
Common in some lagers (they use it in theirs due to quick turn around). 
I used it in a Munich Helles, Dortmunder, and then for the heck of it I 
added it to a Cream Ale that I was teaching a class on.  The cream ale 
turned into a great summertime lager, light refreshing.  I was happy with 
the results in all of the beers, not identical to the Munich Lager yeast, 
but good none the less.  Also the beer seemed to age quicker and thus be 
ready to drink more quickly (See above).  Make sure you ferment below 
60F. I was at 52-55. 
 
4)  Glycerol for freezing yeast:  Any homebrewing store that carries 
liqueur extracts and wine supplies should carry "Finishing formula" a 
food grade glycerine.  I have been told that glycerine and glycerol are 
basically the same.  Either way I have used the glycerine to freeze 7 
different liquid yeasts for reuse, and the yeasts have lasted up to 10-12 
months in the freezer. 
        NOTE:  when stepping up the liquid yeast make 2 starter bottles 
(possibly 3).  Take 1-2 tsp. frozen yeast slurry and add to a sterile 
bottle with 1-2 oz. starter solution (well oxygenated).  Within 24 hrs 
you will see a small krausen and the airlock will be "up", you may even 
see it bubble.  Then step this up to 4-6 oz. give it 24 hours, and if 
possible step up to 1-2 pints. 
        DO NOT try to step from frozen to 4-6 oz.  It will lag 36-72 
hours and then go berserk.  The problem is that you don't know what else 
may have gone berserk in the mean time.

Subject: Hazelnut brown


Another one eaten by "NONE", I hope it gets out this time. 
 
Phil Wilcox, 
I know your question was directed to the Boston Wort Processors but I 
thought I could help.  I made a similar recipe to the Longshot, except I 
wanted it to be richer, and a little less hazelnut.  I based mine on a 
nut brown recipe (Millers) with honey (1 lb.) instead of brown sugar and 
used 1 bottle of T. Noirot Hazelnut liqueur extract at bottling. Myself 
and a few friends said they liked it better because of its balance. 
        Since then I have gotten the original recipe from my rep. at 
Northwestern Extracts; 
 
Doug and Vicki Parkers hazelnut Brown: 
6.6 lbs N.W. Gold liq. extract 
1/2 lb. M&F pale ale malt 
1/2 lb. M&F crystal malt (60 L ?) 
1 lb. Cara-pils 
1.5 oz. Willamette (or Fuggle) 
60 minute boil 
1 oz. Willamette or Fuggle (aroma) 
5 min. steep 
1 tsp Irish Moss (15 min rrom end) 
1.5 bottles All Natural Hazelnut Flavoring at bottling 
2 tsp. gypsum 
Wyeast British Ale. 
Mash grain at 160 F. 
5 gal. yield. 
 
This is how I received the recipe, as you may notice no alpha ratings for 
the hops so your guess is as good as mine.  The T. Noirot should be 
available at your favorite H.B. store or they can order it if they buy 
from L.D. Carlson.

This really caught my eye, the part about the really clear beer.  I brew in 10 
gallon batches and keg in 5 gallon cornelius kegs.  Lately, I dry hop one and 
leave the other alone.  This last time around, I dry hopped with pellets in a 
ripped cheese cloth bag and it the pellets disintegrated and got all through 
the
beer.  The beer tasted pretty good (after 1 week of dry hopping) and I decided 
to filter out the hop particals.  Two things happened, the beer got very clear 
(unusually so for me) and the hop flavor dissappeared.  Now I figure if I had 
dry hopped for two weeks instead of one the dry hop flavor would have remained 
after the filtering, but what really surprised me was the clarity of the beer. 
My other keg (with the dry hops) was also filtered, but remained rather cloudy.
So hop pellets as finings, right?  If you can get rid of the hops.

Sorry Graham, 
I have no knowledge of in-line aeration, as I do the same thing you do.  I 
aerate with a large blue stone thing that I got from an aquarium store and I 
use
an aquarium pump and my stone is very slowly losing stones (bits). I do all my 
sanitizing with steam or chloring bleach.  In the case of the air stone, it's 
chlorine bleach. And I too wondered if (in my case) it was the chlorine making 
the stone fall apart.  I mean, what's making the stone hold together in the 
first place.  It looks like blue sand and glue.  (in my beer?). 
 
 
And finally, I ask: 
 
When you have one of the those little March MTX motors like I do and it pushes 
something like 7-gallons per minute, you don't leave it on for the whole mash! 
Do you?  I let the liquor slowly fill a bucket which has a float switch, which 
turns on the pump and so on...  How do others do it?  My float switch is home 
made, senses a high and low level and uses fishing floats and I don't like it 
very much except that it works great (it's a mess to look at, and maintain). I 
would rather have a very slow pump that I could keep on the whole time and 
forget the sump pump approach.  Comments?
