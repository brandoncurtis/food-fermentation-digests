Re the recent comment by Tom Herlache of Ca, alpha-amylase and yeast 
flocculation. Tom is correct that excessive flocculation could laeve 
excessive residual sugars and I have also read of improved 
flocculation with increasing Ca concentrations.  Tom and others 
shouldn't discount the possibility that based on the temp, time, 
enzyme content and Ca concentration of the mash it's quitee possible 
that non-fermentable sugars are being produced at a higher rate that 
their reduction to fermentable sugars during some portion of the mash. 
End that mash at such a point would leave a higher % of 
non-fermentables.  There are some great data collected by Bent Stig 
Envoldsen of Tuborg breweries and published in the 1969 and 1974 EBC 
and in the JIB in 1974 too (tho' I haven't personally accessed the 
last two).

Brewsters: 
 
Kevin Sprague offers some advice on the kegging and gases and his attempt is 
appreciated, but some of his explanations are outrageously incorrect.  Better 
not listen to Mr. Perlick any more when it comes to gases and kegging.  Sorry, 
Kevin, but this needs more discussion. 
 
At equilibrium, all gases fill *all*  the space to which they are confined 
totally independent of the presence of other gases.  This is one of the big 
differences of gases from solids and liquids. 
 
Kevin says: 
 
>  As for a blend of gas in the tank, any gas supply would happily 
> fill your tank with a blend of gas.  However, this strikes against 
> commonsense.  The whole basis of a beer dispensing system is that

This is completely incorrect. 
 
1) Gases always mix completely, eventually. Air does not spontaneously separate
out into oxygen and nitrogen or we'd be in trouble, ditto CO2.    In making 
highly quantitative gas blends, it is normal for the supplier to roll the 
cylinders on motorized rollers for a short time, creating currents, to blend 
gases when they were injected one at a time, especially in high pressure 
situations, but they never separate back out.. For our turbulent, low pressure 
kegging situation, "no wirries" as the mid-western Ozzies say. 
 
Kevin says: 
 
> Additionally, the 
> CO2 is heavier than the air and falls to the surface of the beer while the 
> air remains at the top of the keg filling the ever increasing air space. 
 
2) Since gases always mix and stay mixed regardless of their STP density as a 
pure gas, it is not possible for the CO2 to settle down on the beer and the air
to be on top. 
 
This misconseption may exist because situations do exist where heavy gases ( 
i.e. STP density > air = about 30 gms/22.4 liers `at`STP) like propane will form a
layer on the floor pouring down form a raised source, but this happens when the
flow is in a non-turbulent stream. This is why propane detectors should be put 
down low and methane detector up high. However, given long enough or turbulent 
air currents, propane will diffuse throughout the room to the same 
concentration
all over the room and stay that way. CO2 in a non-turbulent situation can 
likewise display the same temporary behavior. It is not "settling out", it just
hasn't been mixed in yet. 
 
You are correct that if you take a carbonated keg and replace the gas in it 
with
air, that CO2 will eventually come out of solution to arrive at a certain 
pressure determined by the solubility of the CO2 at the current temperature and
the beer will be flatter than it was before the CO2 in the gas phase was 
replaced or, in this case, the volume of free gas space was increased by the 
disappearance of the beer. The partial pressure of CO2 at the given temperature
is the determining factor on how much will come out of solution. This is for an
equilibrium situation. 
 
What is the controlling factor and makes it useful to the dispensing industry 
is
the slow RATE of equilibration of the CO2 in solution with the gas above it, in
the absence of nucleation sites for the bubbles to form on.  This makes it 
possible to inject air into the headspace and deliver carbonated beer in the 
short term. 
- ----------------------------------------------------- 
Tom Herlache suggests that premature yeast flocculation may be the cause of the
lower attenuation in Dave Whitman's higher calcium worts. Good departure point 
for this discussion. 
 
>If this is the case, then Dave should be able to get the FG back down by 
>rousing the yeast.  Does anyone else recall hearing that Ca++ increases 
>floculation? 
 
Yes, Calcium content does affect flocculation, but I don't know the minimum 
required to avoid a powdery yeast and don't ever remember reading an actual 
value. 
 
Also, without explanation, M&BS says for high calcium beers it is best to 
adjust
the Ca++ in the mash to 50ppm and to add the remainder of the Ca++ later. 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Jorge Blasig writes that his malt extract will have about 50-55% maltose and 
20%
dextrins. If you have an OG of 1.060 as you plan, I guesstimate you should get 
an FG of 1.017 to 1.016 (( 60*20/(50+20) = 17 60*20/(55+20) = 16 )) since the  
dextrins won't ferment. It will be a little lower since you are making alcohol 
and possibly a little higher if the yeast aren't fully attenuative.  Alcohol 
content should be about 6.5%.  Sounds like you will be just perfect. 
 
It is a good plan to use the ale yeasts at that temperature. Last I heard you 
had a choice between a yeast that had an alcohol tolerance of 12-14% and one 
about 8% without specifying the type of yeast.  I suggested the latter because 
it sounded like a beer yeast. 
 
You're on your way.  Good Luck!

Without a doubt. At what length of line does the beer start flowing backwards? 
 
But seriously. Do you or does  anyone else have a plot of flow rate vs line 
length/i.d. at some given head pressure?  This has been discussed here ad 
nauseum with mostly bad physics.  I'd like to see someone with your experience 
and knowledge lay to rest the misunderstanding that pressure drop is determined
by the line length, because of the mistaken belief that the line has a constant
pressure drop/ft.( true only at a constant flow rate). 
 
I believe that the flow rate is determined by the pressure differential of keg 
head to atmosphere and the size/length of hose if the valve is wide open and is
the same as or bigger than the line diameter. Any recommendations on books on 
this subject?

Pat, 
 
Michael J. Lewis, author of  "STOUT"  (Classic Brewing Series), believes it is 
the nitrogen which is responsible for the foam stability.  He says on p.120 
 
"Nitrogen effectively stabilizes the foam of the draught product because as it 
passes through the small holes in  a Guiness tap the stout receives a high 
shear. This causes the nitrogen and carbon dioxide to break out of solution to 
form very tiny bubbles of rather even size which are inherently stable. The 
nitrogen, being insoluble in the beer, then tends to stay in the bubbles, 
rather
than leaking through the bubble walls to form larger, less stable bubbles or to
the atmosphere( which is mostly nitrogen) thereby causing the foam to be 
stable."   and it goes on with recommendations on how to set up. 
 
He also says "The dispense gas must then be correctly formulated according to 
Henry's law to keep both the carbon dioxide and nitrogen in solution in the 
stout.  This formula usually results in a mixture between 40/60 percent and 
30/70 carbon dioxide /nitrogen by volume."  and on about canning Guiness, etc. 
 
As you stated, I too believe that carbon dioxide is much more soluble in beer 
than nitrogen. The above statement about Henry's law ( which says the 
solubility
of a barely soluble gas is proportional to its own partial pressure in the gas 
phase) had me puzzled, since I didn't think nitrogen solubility was on the same
order of magnitude as carbon dioxide.  Well, good old Chem. Rubber Handbook 
p.6-4 says that at 20C, the ratio of mole fraction solubility of Nitrogen to 
CO2
is 0.127/7.07 = 0.018 or on a weight basis multiplying by 28/44 = 0.0114.  SO, 
nitrogen solubility in water is 1% that of the CO2. So that checks. 
 
 Why did Lewis say both soluble?  Since the nitrogen is insoluble, how does it 
get into the beer so it is there at the dispense nozzle if the mixed gas is 
only
applied to the keg? So I guess I'm puzzled about how this statement checks with
yours and the relative solubility of the gases.   Is there something basic I'm 
missing? like the design of the dispense valve? Is the keg pressurized with the
mixed gasses plus mixed at the valve? 
 
I guess I fall into that class of "a lot of confusion out there" you speak 
about. I thought the nitrogen was used  in the dispense gas to behave like the 
old hand operated "sparkler" valves which passed the gas through a fine nozzle 
to break out the CO2 and mixed air into the beer foam. In this mixed gas case 
your recipe says to take the pressure of the carbon dioxide in the keg at 
storage and use that pressure plus nitrogen to get the dispense gas total 
pressure.  Your ratio of 70/30 CO2/N2 is exactly opposite to that used in the 
industry, based on Lewis' comments. Is it because you store your beer at near 
room temperature and cool before delivery, whereas industry keeps the beer keg 
cold before delivery?

Alex Santic asks about RO water and why it is referenced. I have reverse 
osmosis
purified (RO) water in my home because I have a well.  My well water had an 
undesirable and increasing amount of iron, manganese and other stuff in it and 
was becoming increasingly problematical in my beer making as well as brown 
dishes and blue bath water from the dissolving copper pipes. So, I installed 
carbon columns to remove organics, a limestone bed to neutralize the acidity, 
softened it to remove all cations except sodium and installed a 10 gal/day 
(guess why) RO at the kitchen sink so I would have a source of ion free water 
for my beer making. My wife thinks the RO is to remove the sodium from the 
water
for drinking and coffee ( 2 people, 10 gals per day?), but then she puts the 
dog's water through a Brita filter after all of the above.  It's fun with two 
A/Rs in the same house.

Jeffrey - Glycerine and glycerol are the same thing, just common and old 
chemical names for the same thing. Go to your pharmacy for a safe supply. 
- ---------------------------------------------------------- 
AlK's nice bottle filling/carbonation experiment is appreciated.  Do you think 
the lower carbonation for the nearly filled bottle is because no oxygen was 
present for the yeast to grow?  I'm puzzled for an interpretation, as I would 
have bet no difference. Any way to measure bottle pressure at various times and
temperatures? Say with a tire valve in a  bottle top?  Thoughts anyone? 
 
Regarding Jeff Frane's comments, I think you did give warning that this was 
only
one experiment, and I appreciate being in on your experimental results at the 
outset.  Critics should also do their own experiments and publish them for 
comment.

Dave... you must have forgotten the other factor involved.  This is taken 
from our off-line conversation on beta amylase: 
 
Steve Alexander> The rate of catalytic reaction is also decreased by this 
 
DRB says - I agree with you and Steve Alexander that dilution will possibly 
cause the reduction of the forward rate and that Lake Michigan would probably 
not be a good place to make beer with a pound of malt if you were in a hurry 
(not to mention the BOD would not be not acceptable by the EPA, I'll bet) , but
I didn't bother to discuss the free energies of complex formation, it's effect 
on rates, soild starch vs solubilized starch, etc, etc. in addressing Steve's 
valid comment. I took M&BS's observation that diluting the mash has an OVERALL 
effect of giving a more fermentable wort. It was their interpretation, which I 
repeated,  that the products like sugar, slowed down the production by 
inhibiting the forward reaction. If you want the reference to this I'll provide
it again. 
 
***** 
Dave writes in response to a question:: 
>>5) is a mash-out necessary too?  (i think my friend anton just 
>>asked this same question ... but somehow i missed the answer). 
 
Dave says ( among other things, I'll bet - DRB) 
 
>Yes, to keep the composition of the wort constant during the sparge. 
 
AlK says: "I've wondered about this, in passing, for quite a long time. I think
 
that someone realized that mash-out temps would denature the enzymes 
and assumed that this was an important purpose of the mashout.  I think 
it's not. " 
 
And after providing a thorough examination of various time and temperature 
cases
AlK says: 
 
"Therefore, in all three cases, mashout would only be killing alpha 
amylase which does not change fermentability. ....... then 
there is *starch* remaining and you mashed-out too early! 
 
Right?" 
 
 
DRB says: 
 
We agree, if the mashing is carried to completion (meaning the starch is gone 
from the solution and the malt grains) AND all of the beta amylase is gone by 
the end of the mashing step. 
 
However, if mash conditions don't guarantee all the beta is gone, even if all 
the starch is solubilized by the alpha, then the mashout/sparge temperature 
does
have a beneficial effect in stabilizing the carbohydrate composition. Remember 
SteveA, you and I discussed the lifetime of Beta offline ad nauseum and despite
his excellent library work, we could not come up with a definitive answer for 
beta lifetime *under real wort conditions*, except for the M&BS statement that 
beta had a lifetime of about 45 minutes to 1 hour at 150F in a wort. 
 
 M&BS also indicates that alpha is stable at pH =6 in the presence of 
suffficient calcium, even at 158F. Other places indicate the alpha hngs around 
for 2 hours or so. As you indicated, if starch is still present then the mash 
should be continued.  However, I have repeatedly read that the reason for 
recycling the sparge to near clarity before moving it to the copper is to 
reduce
the chances of remaining starch in the grains bits becoming solubilized during 
the boil and causing clarity problems.  This implies to me that starch could 
still present to some extent even at the end of a successful mash. This is the 
reason the sparge water is kept in the range 167 -179F, rather than using 
boiling water in the sparge.  If starch is around and alpha amylase is around 
during the no mashout, cool sparge case, I can see that the wort composition 
will be changing.  Is it important?  Probably not, if the amount of residual 
starch is small. 
 
I believe that, under certain mashing conditions/times and, perhaps, high 
enzyme
malts, mashout does stabilize the wort by destroying enzymes.  To be safe, I 
always do a mashout in case a sparge gets stuck or something else interferes 
with going to a sparge immediately.  It also has the benefits listed below: 
 
Sorry to provide a quote, but M&BS says on p225, 1st ed on the subject of 
sparging 
 
"....at 167 -176 on to the goods, that is the solids in the mash tun.  The 
higher temperature results in (i) reduced wort viscosity, (ii) a more rapid 
dissolution of insoluble materials, and (iii) almost complete inactivation of 
the enzymes..." 
***** 
AlK says in response to my question addressed to him on Chimay yeast and his 
tour of Belgian breweries  "I never made it down to Chimay, but rumor has it 
that Chimay is bottled with the same yeast as they use for fermentation." 
 
Thanks Al, other comments also support the idea that Chimay yeast is the same 
in
the fermentation as the bottle. I think the answer to this question of yeast 
habits followed in the next few days from my reading about kegging of Belgian 
beers.  Belgian yeasts of old (which may include Chimay) during fermentation 
used to display just this habit that I observed. The old brewers observed a 
yellowish foam flowing from the keg during fermentation which disappeared 
followed by a bright white tightly knit foam which formed a "cauliflower" in 
the
bung hole. This signaled the time to put in the bung and ship to the pubmaster.
This closely parallels my observations.  I estimated that this" cauliflower" 
stage was about 2% sugar content, based on my observations. 
 
Yes,  It was on a cement floor next to the furnace and the air temperature at 
the fermenter was in the high 70s, but this phenomenon of the disappearing 
yellow foam and appearance of white foam happened before the increase in room 
temperature from 70F to 77F could have an effect I believe. Interestingly, the 
onset of the white foam was accompanied by an onset of ester formation, judging
by the aroma from the fermentation. Although a below ground level cement floor 
should be about 55For warmer all the time, I think I will sit my FV on an 
insulating foam pad from now on.

Answer to: how to serve Mead. 
 
Obtain a funnel and about two feet of hose. 
Connect the small end of the funnel to the hose. 
Have a friend hold the funnel above your head and fill 
it with the mead as you keep the hose kinked.  When 
all the mead (preferrably more than 24 Oz.) is in the 
funnel place the hose in your mouth and unkink. 
 
pretty easy. 
 
But really, I don't know.  I have about 5 gallons of mead

I realize that running the HBD is not an easy task, but these were some of 
the concerns that were raised when the original HBD was contemplating

Where is the AOB, and why haven't they addressed the digest to at least

Actually, Al we are correctly spelling both words correctly in both countries. 
"Compleat" is a variation of "Complete", but usually refers to a skill. ala the
book "The Compleat Angler" meaning a fully skilled fisherman. "Complete" has   
the same spelling in both countries and means the same thing, such as "to 
complete a task". 
 
Both spellings are understood in both countries. 
 
As for flavour, er, flavor.  That's a different thing. 
 
Having lived and drunk ( both meanings in both countries) in the UK, having a 
daughter born and in graduate school there and having lots of friends there, I 
understand and agree with your Anglophilicity. Thank goodness their food is 
starting to catch up with their beer.

Subject: Air pumps and filters


In Digest #2277 Steve Adams asks what kind of air pumps people are using. 
 
I'm using a "Hagen Optima" pump that I picked up a few years ago to use on 
an aquarim that was never meant to be...  (Long story)  The pump has a 
granular activated carbon pre filter, and a rheostat so that you can control 
the air flowing from the pump.  I use it with a floss/ granular activated 
carbon filter and a sterile air filter after the pump, and a plastic "Tetra 
Luft" airstone. 
 
One of the more interesting things about the rheostat is that you can just 
turn it down when the wort starts to foam out of the carboy, instead of 
shutting it down. 
 
Cheers!

I will be driving to DC, Wilmington,DE, Philadelphia,E. Rutherford, NJ, 
and NYC from Atlanta in the next few weeks.I will be returning to 
Atlanta, 
probably taking 2 days to do so, but I haven't worked that part of the 
trip out yet. Anyway, will the collective email me suggestions on beers 
sites along the way (brewpubs,beer bars,must sees, tours, etc), all 
recommendations will be appreciated. Also, if there are suggestions on 
where to buy the higher alcohol Belgian beers that I love or rare 
microbrews, send them to me.TIA, lee

I highly recommend stopping at a bar called Brickskellers in Washington 
DC, it is off of the Dupont Circle Metro Stop.  They have an import and 
micro brew beer list like a phone book, (no kidding), literally hundreds 
on hand.  I have tried some very hard to find Belgium and German beers 
there.  They also have fantastic chicken wings.  Have a Belgium Kwak for 
me while your there.

REPLY: In my experience, the last date stamped on the tank is the last 
"hydro" test. The testing (passing the test actually) is required evry 10 
years. The test seems to cost about $15.00. I wouldn't suspect that there's 
anything inside the tank to worry about. You could maybe turn it upside down 
and blow out a little gas.....see if anything undesireable blows out with 
it.

Subject: Beerfridge controllers


 
Well, it is that time of year again.  My beerfridge controller (an airstat) 
seems to be functioning poorly, and I would like some advice from the 
collective. 
1.  Johnson Controls  makes a fridge controller....cooling only.  Has anyone 
used it? 
2.  A cooling/heating control would be nice, as I live in a northern clime 
and would like to avoid beersicles.  I could plug a lightbulb into the heat 
side and do nicely.  Does anyone know of one readily adaptable?  I have 
looked at several wiring diagrams, but simply don't know how to make one. 
3. Any others?  Response by private email would be fine, and I'll post 
responses later. 
 
thanks

Subject: Wort Levels and Efficiency


In HBD 2277, Tim Martin asks about measuring the volume of his boiling wort. 
Here's what I do: I filled  my kettle with water to the desired (5.5 gallons) 
level, stuck a wooden dowel into the water, marked the level with a non-toxic 
marker.  Now when I want to measure, I quick turn off the heat, stick it in, 
(stop that!) and measure. Quick, cheap, easy. 
 
In the same post, the efficiency monster raises its ugly head.  I wish to 
(your favorite diety here) that I had never measured mine, because it drives 
me nuts.  I started at 25 pts/lb/gallon with my EZmasher (tm).  Al K proved in 
a technical article last year that 31 pts was achievable.  So...I tried 
different grains (Schrier, DWC, H-B), different mash schedules (single 
infusion, 40-60-70), adjusted my mash PH with Ca+, adjusted my sparge water 
with lactic acid, bought a second thermometer, bought a second hydrometer, 
switched from a corona to a maltmill (tm), sacrificed my wife's cat....all to 
no avail.. 
 
  Just for the record, yesterday I brewed an English Pale Ale, I used 11 lbs 
Hugh Baird, 2 oz crystal, I added 3 tsp gypsum to my water, I pre-boiled to 
eliminate both chlorine and bicarbonate, I added another tsp gypsum to replace 
the calcium that was precipitated out with the bicarbonate, I mashed at 152F 
for 90 minutes, I mixed the mash like crazy to eliminate hot spots, dough 
balls, and evil spells, I mashed out at 170F for 15 minutes, I sparged until I 
hit 1.010, which took 90 minutes, I danced around the kitchen, and I still got 
an OG of 1.050, (pre-boil gravity 1.040 for 7 gallons) which comes to.....25 
pts/lb/gallon. 
 
HOWEVER....in 2277 Mark Bayer suggests 1 & 1/2 quarts per pound....I've been 
using 1 quart /pound ala Papazian...Could this be the magic answer?...Naw, I 
didn't think so either....I think I'll throw away my hydrometer. 
 
I was at a fundraiser for my daughter's pre-school and the host was a sales 
manager for Miller.  I didn't know this, so I brought a six-pack of SNPA, and 
had to add it to the ice chest containing miller, miller lite, miller ice, 
miller ice dry, etc etc etc.  I only had two, someone else drank the other 
four and I think it was the host.   I asked him about heart of the hops, and 
he excused himself to get more dip...

Subject: Floating Thermometer


I've decided a few things in my year of homebrewing: 
 
   1) Glass thermometers and I don't get along.  (Broken 3) 
   2) Electronic thermometers are great, but they have a while to 
      go to catch up to the rigors of homebrewing (Confused it by 
      dropping into pot of wort...can electrons get drunk??) 
 
So, given that, I'm looking for this: 
 
    A FLOATING, analog, dial thermometer.  I say floating because my 
last glass thermometer was a floating one, and I really enjoyed using 
it.  Analog, well, heck, because it can't break. 
 
Anyone? 
 
Thanks for any info!

Subject: glatt mill gear replacement


 
A few months ago I came across some info that I can't find again regarding 
someone who had a machinist fashion a set of metal gears to replace the 
plastic gears in a Glatt Malt Mill.  If someone has the info about this 
replacement could he/she please send it to me. 
 
Today a terrible tragedy struck my brewery as I was milling about 22 lbs 
of grain for a Schneider Aventinus weizenbock clone.  A rock took hold of 
my mill and in spite of the clutch, the plastic glatt gears got hosed. 
Fortunately, it happened near the last pound of grain so I was able to 
slowly grind the rest with my mill limping along.  I'm afraid I won't be 
able to brew again until I fix my precious mill. 
 
TIA,

Steve, and everybody else that's interested: 
 
I believe that the law requires anyone selling chemicals such as this to keep 
a "Material Safety Data Sheet" (MSDS) on hand to give advise on first aid, 
handling precautions, etc.  They usually list the principle ingredients on the 
sheet as well.  If you ask your HB shop to show it to you, it is my belief 
that they are bound by law to comply.  If they say that they don't have an 
MSDS then they can be reported to OSHA or some other agency(?).  Even liquor 
stores are required to have MSDS's on hand for the products that they sell. 
I seem to remember someone saying that there is a government web page 
somewhere that lists *all* MSDS's if you are really interested in what is in 
the products that we brewers are using.  I'm not trying to stir up trouble for 
any HB shop owners, as most of them are just squeeking by trying to stay 
in business anyway.  But if any business p*ss's you off, it's a grand way to 
harrass them.  Just demand to see the MSDS on every product they carry.
