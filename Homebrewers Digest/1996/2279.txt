John, I don't share your love for diacetyl--I can hardly stand to drink 
any of the Samuel Smith's (English) ales, for example. The aroma hits me 
right in the face before I even take a sip--and I don't feel like I 
should be smelling anything reminiscent of popcorn when I'm about to 
drink a malt beverage! But I understand that the perception of diacetyl 
is genetic--some people don't perceive it at all, whereas many people 
(most of my friends) can't pick it out of the flavors, they may just make 
comments like "this is smooth". But I do like McEwan's (if not 
necessarily the strong, sweet style), and I did not perceive noticeable 
diacetyl in the six-pack I tried. Any chance you're perceiving something 
other than diacetyl? Or maybe it's subtle enough in that beer that I 
don't perceive it as unpleasant... 
 
At any rate, I tryed a Scottish ale recipe earlier this year (I believe I 
saw it on the HBD) that came out VERY similar to a McEwan's (but again, I 
didn't perceive diacetyl):

I used: 
 
1.25 lb. Munton's amber dried malt extract 
6.60 lb. Munton's amber malt extract syrup (2 cans) 
9.25 oz. 60L Crystal 
2.75 oz. 120L Crystal 
0.25 lb. roasted barley (I was afraid 2/3 lb. would dominate, but next 
time I would try it) 
2.33 oz. E. Kent Golding pellets 4.5a 90 min. 
1.00 oz. E. Kent Golding pellets 4.5a 10 min. 
1 pint starter of Wyeast 1728 Scottish 
 
This was a no-fuss recipe that came out very true to the McEwan's style, 
I thought. The Scottish yeast left the beer clean, sweet and malty. If I 
made this again, I would try the 2/3 lb. roasted barley of the original 
recipe, to try for more roasty balance to the maltiness. 
 
By the way, I've made a stout with the 1084 and didn't perceive diacetyl. 
Of course, I didn't try, either. ;o) 
 
You could try racking to secondary early to get diacetyl. Most yeast 
creates diacetyl but reduces it out, given time to fully ferment the 
beer. 
 
Good luck!

Brewsters:

Dave Hinkle asks about using quick Grits in brewing.  I always precook even 
quick grits and other such "prepared" quick cook cereals to make sure the 
starch
is gelatininzed. Instant Cream of Wheat has been treated with Papain to make it
quick cooking. This will affect the protein chain length and open up the starch
granules, but not gelatinize the starch. All of these have possibly been steam 
treated, I don't know.  Why chance it? 
 
I often make up corn based lagers using grits and do like the big boys do with 
no trouble.  I do a "goods" mash first in which I boil the grits or other 
adjunct, add cold water to get to my lowest rest temperature, (usually 110F for
things like Cream of Wheat), add milled malt ( say 2#) and proceed through a 
quick mash. Adding water to this and then the malt I do a staged infusion mash.
This keeps the real mash from becoming viscous and gets the grits goodies 
available.  You can also do a pseudo-decoction (George DePiro are you 
listening?) using this technique with any adjunct ( say Cream of Wheat or even 
just malt) staging it at various temperatures and then boil like you would in a
decoction. Using this technique I have never had a stuck or slow sparge and the
efficiency was right up there where it should be.

Tom Lombardo asks if there is a book on classic beer styles and how to make

Tom, you are a marketers dream. There's a whole series of such books called 
"Classic Beer Style Series" from Brewer's Publications.  C.Papazian's Beer 
Companion has a complete listing of the technical characteristics for beer 
judging and recipe development.

I don't know if it has been disproven experimentally, but it can probably be 
ruled out on a physiscal basis.  Consider how carbonation occurs: The yeast 
produce CO2 in solution, which gradually degasses from the liquid into the 
headspace. This continues to happen until the system is in equilibrium, that 
is, the tendancy of CO2 to be forced back into solution by the elevated 
headspace pressure is exactly balanced by the tendancy of CO2 to degass from 
the solution. As the fermentation progresses, the concentration of CO2 in 
the liquid increases, causing the equilibrium pressure in the headspace to 
rise.  But at all points in the process, the equilibrium headspace pressure 
is simply a function of the concentration of CO2 in solution.  The volume of 
the headspace does not factor into this equation at all.  The pressure in 
the headspace is a function of how fast the fermentation proceeds, not 
vice-versa.

Subject: Harvesting blowoff yeast


 
Has anyone ever harvested the yeast from blowoff collection with good 
results?  Here's the setup I'm using but I'm not quite brave enough to use 
the yeast: 
 
Fermenting in corny kegs with 5/8" tubing into a 1 gallon jug.  Jug was 
cleaned and sanitized with about a quart of boiling brewing water. 
Stuffed the opening with paper towel after putting sanitized blowoff hose 
in.  Figure the paper towel will keep most nasties out.  Wrapped paper 
towel and hose with aluminum foil for good measure.  Gas escapes and nice 
white weizen yeast sits in the bottom of the jug either waiting for the 
sewer or waiting for harvesting.

Hello friends, 
 
I made a small typo in my bit about hops as finings.  To clarify (get it?), it 
was the keg with no dry hop 
bits that was somewhat hazy even after filtering.  But the dry hopped one was 
out of sight 
clear. 
 
On slurry, 
Do you know that I have now seen the word 'slurry' maybe hundreds of times and 
nowhere has 
anyone ever said where it comes from? If I make a starter, is the stuff on the 
bottom a 
slurry?  And is that somehow more useful in some situations than a starter? 
 
On Acidify, 
Do you know that I have now seen the word 'acidify' maybe ten times and 
nowhwere
have I noticed 
anyone ever saying how to acidify?  I would like to hear how people acidify. 
 
Respectfully submitted, 
Rick Walton, not Walto.

I have two of them and they work well. Sometimes I keep a bottle or 
hydrometer jar of water in the fridges in order to check temperature and 
it's been pretty much spot-on. These units also treat your compressor well. 
 
Personally I find it a slight pain to deal with positioning the metal air 
bulb in a stable manner in the fridge, but it's not too bad.

First Lewis says the nitrogen and carbon dioxide break out of solution 
then turns around and says nitrogen is insoluble in beer, then turns 
around and says the bubbles are nitrogen. If the nitrogen is insoluble in 
beer how can it "break out" of solution. Something doesn't jive here. Is 
nitrogen soluble or not? If not, it couldn't have anything to do with the 
foam stability. Don't divers get the bends from nitrogen comming out of 
solution in their blood? If nitrogen dissolves in blood and isn't bound to 
something else(like a red blood cell), I'd guess it would dissolve in beer 
too. What's the real story? Maybe we should put DATELINE on it.

Definitely try this. I dunno how your arm can stand mixing such a thick 
mash while adding heat. Your chances of getting an even mash temp are slim 
unless you whip up a froth and probably dislocate your shoulder. If you 
like, you can start with 1 qt/lb for a protein rest if you need one, and 
heat 1/2 qt/lb for infusion. This favors the proteolytic enzymes as well 
as giving you a head start to the next rest. Sometimes I dough-in cool and 
allow a short rest before heating...that may help a little too. 
 
I'll bet you have better results this way (also note that it's in 
accordance with Schmidling's instructions). I got 32 pts/lb/gal with a 
single decoction yesterday. I get very respectable results with infusion 
mashes also. Still being somewhat new to all-grain, I'm always afraid of 
the worst but some magic seems to levitate my hydrometer. 
 
Don't go crazy with the gypsum...better to calculate target ppms for ions 
and measure mineral salts as appropriate. I treat all the cold water I 
need for the brew ahead of time and use it as required.

Also, note the line "a lot better than assuming zero (as I think

was inserted by deranged space aliens and is not part of that

Subject: Belgian Beer festival report


Here is my trip report from a wonderful visit to the Great Belgian Beer 
Festival:  24 Hours of the Belgian Special Beers.  What a treat!  This was a 
great opportunity to taste the wide range of available flavors of beer in 
Belgium.  The festival was held in Antwerp Belgium for 2 days (Saturday 16 
November and Sunday 17 November).  The event was put on by the Belgian beer 
tasting organization, de Objectieve Bierproevers (OBP).  We attended the 
first day.  There were 152 different beers (emphasis on the "different"). 
Of these, I was (regrettably) only able to taste about 25 of them.  Whew! 
 
Here's how the festival worked:  buy a glass, a nice "snifter" style glass; 
next, buy some tokens (each token was good for one sample and cost about a 
dollar); finally, trade tokens for beer.  The 55 breweries were spread out 
in a small hall.  Every stand had a glass washer and most had bread for 
cleansing the palate.  Servings were 15cl (about 5 ounces).  The program was 
organized to list the beers according to style.  This was very detailed.  In 
addition to the beer styles that I was somewhat familiar with, like lambic 
and gueze, there were kerstbiers (Christmas beers), honingbiers (honey 
beers), etc. 
 
I tasted many quite unusual beers.  I'm not really much of an expert on 
Belgian beer, but I did get the chance to build on my knowledge.  There were 
many other beers.  Unfortunately, I don't have notes on all of them (you can 
imagine how difficult it is to carry around a pad and pencil.  I wrote 
several notes in the margins of my program.  Here's a small sample of what I 
tried: 
 
The strangest _looking_ beer was Villers' Paranoia Groen, a "green" beer. 
It was somewhat cloudy with a distinct green tint.  It was a fairly sweet 
beer, reminiscent of a trippel.  Quite bizarre to look at, but not bad to 
drink! 
 
I met several members of the OBP (hi Johan and Marc;-) who ensured that I 
got to try some great beers.  The first one they set me up with was Gueze 
Drie Fonteinen.  This was a very complex beer.  The first sip was sour, with 
traces of cherry.  Later sips revealed stronger cherry, some mustiness, and 
sherry like qualities.  Really, each sip was like tasting a different beer! 
 
Hommelbier from Van Eecke - This beer was very hoppy, especially given that 
most of the other beers were more on the malty side.  Good bitterness. 
 
Lindemans' Tea Beer - This was really weird.  Strong tea flavor, fairly 
floral, too.  I've had some similar homebrews.  This was not really to my 
taste. 
 
Divine from Silly - This beer was one of my favorites.  It had a rich 
flavor, very malty/sweet.  Like many of these beers (not all abbey beers), 
it had a yeast character that I associate with the abbey beer style.

It really isn't the lenght of hose that causes beer to flow backwards, it 
is mostly due to over indulgence :)

Try this to unstick a ferment: Secondary the beer. Pour the 
yeast/sediment 
from the bottom of the primary into a sanitized jar. Now make up some 
starter wort and pitch that to the yeast. When this starter takes off, 
add it back to the beer you just removed it from.

Subject: re: serving mead


Since no one seems to want to tackle this one (except the guy with 
the funnelator idea), I'll give it a stab (where is Dick Dunn when 
you need him?): 
 
Since mead is much more like wine that beer, I typically serve my 
mead in a stemmed wine glass.  Sparkling meads look better in tall, 
fluted glasses; still meads can go in balloon-type wine glasses. 
Small glasses should be used; mead is something to be enjoyed in 
moderation (as anyone who has had a mead hangover can tell you - oh 
brother!!!). 
I typically serve my mead at about 45-55F (my cooler is set at 40F 
and I take the mead out and let it set at room temp for 10-15 minutes 
before serving). 
All of the sensory activites used for beer work well for mead:  hold 
it up to the light and look at the color and clarity; swirl the glass 
and smell the aroma(s); carefully taste it - look for expression of 
honey flavor.  One of the biggest problems that I have found it that 
folks don't use enough honey and typically use champagne yeast - the 
result is a dry, alcoholic product without the honey aromas and 
flavors that set mead apart from any other beverage. 
 
Hope this helps...

No. Not if you're interested in saving CO2. 
 
Whether you use the shake-rattle-and-roll method or the teensy-bubble- 
through-stone method, the same amount of CO2 will is required to reach a set 
CO2 volume at a set temperature. The stone should take less time, however - 
something more valuable than CO2, IMHO...

     I called the AOB yesterday and was informed that since the leaving of 
     Shawn the AOB no longer has anything to do with the HBD. 
 
     Therefore, they could really care less because all we did was bitch 
     about the way they screwed it up in the first place. 
 
     Face it people the AOB/AHA is floundering and ruining our HBD. 
 
     I have talked to Karl Lutzen from the Brewery and he is looking into 
     some options.

Subject: High Mash Temps. & Using Liquid Yeast


 
     Fellow Brewers: 
 
     Recently my assistant mashed 22 lbs of British Pale Malt with 2 lbs 
     Crystal 40 at 169F for 1 hour.  Question 1:  What is the predicted 
     outcome for this brew? 
 
     It was supposed to be a 10 gal batch of Holiday (spiced) Ale as in 
     Papazian.  Will it be drinkable?  Its fermenting slowly at 58F with 
     WYEAST American ALE II liquid yeast. 
 
     Second question regarding the proper use liquid yeast cultures.  I 
     prepared a started for the above yeast, and propagated the starter a 
     second time approx. 12 hours before pitching.  However the liquid 
     yeast still seems to start slower and ferment less vigorously than dry 
     yeast, requiring 12 hours to kick in.  Question 2.  Does one need 
     enormous quantities of liquid yeast to achieve the shorter lag times 
     experienced with dry yeast? 
 
     I pitch 3 packages of the dry yeast per 10 gallon batch.  I try to 
     have the wort temp. around 80F at pitching, and I wrap blankets around 
     the fermenter to keep the heat in (its 58F in my cellar).  Dry yeast 
     usually starts fermenting in 3-6 hours; liquid yeast (2 packs in a 2 
     pint starter with 2/3 cup pale hopped malt for 12-24 hours) takes at 
     least 2-3 times longer, despite the fact that it was fermenting the 
     starter nicely at pitching time. 
 
     Thanks for your help.

Subject: N2/CO2 ratios and chicanery...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager... 
 
Further comments on Dave's comments on my commnets on his comments - 
specifics from 2278 missed first swing out... 
 
> I thought nitrogen was used in the dispense gas to behave like the old hand 
<SNIP> 
> Is it because you store your beer at or near room temperature and cool 
> before delivery 
<SNIP> 
 
Dave, you're not confused. Nitrogen is used for both purposes. The mix for 
driving beer in long lines or at high pressure is a different animal than 
injecting nitrogen at or near the faucet (I've heard of these beasties, but 
haven't seen one...). They are acually not really related. 
 
The pressure used to inject N2 into the stream near the nozzle to knock the 
CO2 out of solution would be whatever is perceived to give the desired 
results. The effect of this form of sparkler chicanery would be analogous to 
the pressure required at the head to drive the beer through a "sparkler" - 
or, simply fast enough to generate the desired foam/stillness ratio in the 
glass. I might point out here that nitrogen is not required for this purpose 
(injection at or near the faucet). Any gas will create the same effect. 
 
In systems where "balance" is desired, the mix is determined for the storage 
temperature of the beer, the carbonation pressure at that temperature, and 
the driving pressure required (this was in the original post, I believe). You 
are correct in your supposition that my inverted mix is due to the storage 
temperature of the kegs - and by "storage", I'm referring to the temperature 
of the bulk beer while on the system ("tapped"). The typical mix creates a 
much smaller partial pressure of CO2 and is suitable for systems having the 
beer stored in a cooler while on the system. 
 
This is another case of "standards" and "circumstances". If I blew through 
four kegs of beer a night, I could happily drive my system with 35 psig of 
CO2 or 35 psig or 30% CO2, 70% N2 and never notice any ill effects (if it sat 
a few days under the traditional mix, I may not notice the effects, either). 
Since I find it challenging to consume 20 gallons of beer in a short period 
of time, I require a mix that maintains the partial pressure of CO2 at my 
carbonating level for the storage temperature. When I originally built the 
system, I drove it with pure CO2. The beer became more and more carbonated as 
it spent time under the head. To the point that the beer had the bitterness 
of soda water! Yuch! Imagine what the beer would have been like if it 
werestored cold under such pressure! 
 
(By the way, my draught system cools the beer incrementally, much like how a 
CF chiller cools your wort. Perhaps part of the confusion will be taken care 
of by that clarification. The beer is not cooled before delivery; it is 
cooled DURING delivery!) 
 
Most bars don't pay attention to the mix - they either use it, or they don't, 
regardless of their circumstances. But they go through beer much faster than 
you and I. I might even suggest that their patrons are a bit less 
discriminating than you and I as well ;-) And, you might have to wrestle your 
gas supplier to the ground to get them to provide you with a custom mix. Mine 
insisted that I wanted the traditional mix. 
 
Anyway, I've gone on long enough about this. If I can answer any other 
questions regarding my experience with this, fire away! 
 
(Gads, I hate this Unix editor...)
