Subject: RE: Beerfridge controllers


Guy Gregory asked about Beerfridge controllers. 
 
The problem of temp control of fermentation refrigerators comes up from 
time to time.  I have never used the Hunter controllers but keep reading 
of their unreliability. 
I use mechanical controllers that have a brass bulb connected by a thin brass 
tube to a diaphragm that makes the switch as the liquid inside the tube and 
bulb expand or contract.  These were recommended to me by my son-in-law who 
is in the heating and cooling business.  I have good luck so far. 
I use two controllers in my fermentation fridge to control both the 
refrigeration for high temps and a light bulb to provide heat during periods 
of low temp.  One controller is a Honeywell SPDT (Single Pole Double Throw) 
which will switch to one pole if the temp is below the set point and to another
if it is above.  I cut the red hot wire to the normal thermostat and tied it 
to the input (labeled common, I think) of the SPDT thermostat.  The terminal 
switched to on low temp is connected to the interior light of the refrigerator,
bypassing its normal door operated switch.  If the temp goes below the set 
point of the refrigerator, the light comes on to provide heat.  The other 
terminal of the SPDT thermostat, the one that is switched to above the set 
point, is connected to a SPST (Single Pole Single Throw) thermostat (White- 
Rogers, I think) whose other terminal is connected to the other end of the 
red wire I cut to the normal refrigerator thermostat.  This thermostat is set 
for the highest desired temp of the refrigerator. The SPST thermostat could be 
left out with the high temp side of the SPDT going directly to the refrigerator
thermostat but this would mean that either the bulb would be on providing heat 
or the refrigeration would be on cooling.  The way I have it set up I can have 
a lower limit and an upper limit separated by a few degrees during which 
neither heating or cooling is going on.  By the way, the normal refrigerator 
thermostat is set to its lowest temp. 
I bought these thermostats from Grainger through my son-in-law for ~$25-30 
apiece.  The one caution is to cover glass fermenters with something opaque 
(I use large dark trash bags) if the heat may come, on to protect the beer 
from the light.  Of course, if you ferment in SS there is no worry. 
The unpredictable weather in Texas during the winter, my location of my 
fermenter in an out building, and the fact that I brew on the weekend and 
don't return until the next weekend make it necessary for me to control 
temp swings both ways. 
The setup is no more expensive that electronic two way controls I have seen 
advertised and has the advantage of having a dead spot between heat and cool. 
Also, it may be more reliable than electronic units.  Another advantage of 
putting it in series with the normal refrigerator thermostat instead of 
controlling main power to the box is that circulation fans in the refrigerator 
may operate even if cooling is off.

Subject: New York Area Corny Kegs


After breaking yet another carboy (thankfully, I did not cut myself or lose 
any beer!), I have finally decided not to brew in glass (I had five stitches 
in my hand several years ago to show for carboy brewing, but there's no time 
to go into that now). 
 
Anyway, I want to do all my fermenting in stainless steel now (please don't 
talk to me about plastic). I have some cornelius kegs (pin-lock), and I am 
looking for more. I was wonder if anyone in the New York area (I live in 
Brooklyn) can write me by private E-mail (I don't want to waste too much 
bandwith) regarding any good source for cheap, used corny kegs. Pin lock is 
preferred, but if there is a good, cheap enough source for ball lock kegs, I 
guess I can some extra quick disconnects. 
 
Thanks for your time.

Subject: Beer Tasting, Corny Handpump and Mash Schedule


     ** This is a repost (thanks to the None fairy).  I humbly apologize 
     for any bandwidth wasted if this gets posted twice.  However if it 
     doesn't get posted at all I will expect someone from the digest's 
     crack maintenance staff to come to my home so I can hit them in the 
     head with a tack hammer once for every "none" entry I've seen in the 
     digest** 
 
     Hey Beerfans, 
 
     First of all last Saturday a few friends and myself held a beer 
     tasting for about 25 or 30 acquaintances.  In preparation for that 
     event I had posted several questions for the collective conscience 
     here at HBD and received many helpful responses.  I'd like to now say 
     thanks to all contributors.  The day ran very smoothly and there were 
     a suprisingly high number "bitter beer face" converts. 
 
     (oh my god there's a lot of bottles to wash :( !!!) 
 
     Leading me to my next question,  I've seen some post about the evil's 
     of using a handpump on your corny that may introduce some air into 
     your beer.  However if I get 10 or 12 guys together for a football 
     party I'm confident we would go through the beer before the beer had a 
     chance to stale.  Not to mention the carpal tunnel syndrome that could 
     be avoided by not washing 3 or 4 cases of bottles anytime I have to 
     take the beer on the road.  So if one or two of you handpump advocates 
     could mail me some info on who makes a good corny handpump (price, 
     durability ect.) it would be appreciated. 
 
     Lastly I'm thinking of putting together a Two tier 3 kettle system 
     based loosely on marty's webpage (www.wwi.net/martyt).  I need a good 
     5 gallon mash schedule including cook times, water volumes and 
     temperatures (I'd like to see a couple step decoction schedules). 
     Private mail is fine but I wouldn't mind if a couple of the elders 
     posted a favored schedule here on the digest and chewed the fat on 
     that thread for a while (I learn a lot from those Al K. and Dave B. 
     discussions :) )

Subject: Harrasment by OSHA


I don't usually like to comment on this sort of thing in HBD but the statement 
referring to reporting people to OSHA for not having MSDS's 
  "...if any business p*ss's you off, it's a grand way to  harrass them." 
sort of irks me.  I am not attacking the author of the sentiment but I must 
say I can't agree with the it.  If there is any purpose to OSHA 
(and I'm not sure there is) I don't think it is to harrass people who may 
annoy us.

Craig Rode is having trouble with getting a high effficiency that even 
resorting
to the black arts hasn't helped. 
 
Craig, if your mill is adjustable, try milling your malt twice.  Once at about 
0.070-0.080 in. nip to crack the malt and remove the husks whole and then about
0.060 in. nip. to crush the malt to about 1/16 in cubes and little flour.   It 
won't take much or any longer and the results on efficiency and improved 
sparging will amaze you.  Use a sparkgap tool to set the mill nip

Subject: Wyeast 1007:  the Saga Continues


     Hi all! 
 
     Back on Nov. 5 I posted a query about Wyeast 1007.  I, like some other 
     people, experienced a very sulfury smelling fermentation.  The Wyeast 
     folks that I spoke with said that it good be the result of a lot of 
     simple sugars in the wort (although it was an all-barley malt batch). 
 
     Well, it turns out that batch didn't attenuate well, either.  I have 
     repitched this yeast into a different beer, and am not getting nearly 
     as sulphury an odor. 
 
     There are two big differences between the two ferments: aeration and 
     pitching rate.  The first ferment was under pitched much more severely 
     than the second (I think the second was near optimum, seeing as the 
     fermentation started in a few hours, as opposed to the 12-hour lag the 
     first time). 
 
     The first ferment was aerated by splashing the wort, then shaking the 
     carboy for 10-15 minutes.  The second ferment was aerated by running 
     an aquarium pump for 3 hours. 
 
     So, I think I have narrowed the cause of the sulfur down to lack of 
     aeration and underpitching.  Does anybody out there have any data to 
     help figure out which it is?  It certainly has nothing to do with 
     simple sugars in the wort (in this case, and many others.  About half 
     of those responding to this post experienced sulfury ferments). 
 
     I expect this batch to attenuate better, too. 
 
     Have fun!

HB Community at Large,

to fill his shoes.  I, too, am an avid consumer of the information 
shared in the HBD and greatly desire to see this forum continue.  As 
I have expressed to others with whom I have exchanged email directly, 
I am keeping my fingers crossed that these issues get resolved quickly 
so that we as a community can return to sharing the wealth of information

(Attempt #2(I'll beat the 'none' bug yet!)) 
Hello All, 
A simple question regarding Wyeast 1056: 
I harvested into a 1.5L wine bottle, the dregs from a primary and 
repitched this into a batch of American Ale. As my primary is a 6.5gal. 
'pickle bucket', can I re-repitch right back into the primary, or do I 
have to sanitize the primary each time? Do the Zen Masters have any 
recommendations on the maximum times 1056 can be recycled?  I guess this 
is really 2 questions, but after last night's debacle in Oakland 
(http://espnet.sportszone.com/editors/nfl/features/1118raiders.html), I 
really am finding it hard to concentrate.

Subject: Big Brew Pot


Hello brave challengers of the evil [None]-monster, 
 I'm looking for a large enamel pot, hopefully 7 gallons or more. 
I have checked several stores and seem to max out at 5 gallons.  Does 
anyone know of a source for large enamel pots.  I hope to spend less then 
$40 so SS is out of my price range.  I also hope to avoid mail order 
because I figure the shipping on a pot like this would be expensive, so 
if anyone got their pot at a chain store it would be helpful.  I've also 
been thinking a large oval pot (the kind used to cook turkeys) would be 
nice because it would fit nicely over two burners on my stove so if 
anyone has found one of these please tell me.  TIA and private email is 
fine. 
 A quick thought on the [None]-monster.  Maybe brewing beer is a 
sin and we are being punished.  First the all-powerful gods made us 
fight each other, but when we found peace at the digest they sent the 
[None]-monster to destroy us.

This was posted by Karl Lutzen on The Brewery Site.  Another reason to wish a

No, I think what is going to happen here, is that the HBD will die in it's 
present form (as it currently is), and then some brave soul will pick it 
up again. Remember, he that picks it up is facing a good 200Mb per 
digest distribution. A daunting task, to say the least. 
 
I really wonder if the AOB really cares about their image out here

it be say, dark malt syrup? Does it have to be light DME? Any/all advise 
is appreciated. 2) Is the SG of the wort important? Why? And last, how 
can I extend the life of the starter until available brewing day? 
 
I have read "Making a Starter" in the Brewery but still have questions. 
 
TIA

After a recent trip to the Czech Republic I have decided to start brewing 
pils.  I am looking for suggestions on which temperature controller 
I should purchase for my chest freezer. I want a tempurature range of at least 
 -1oC to ambient.  Any information would be appreciated.

Subject: propane cooker/hbd home


 
So OK then...a few months ago I posted that I use a jet-style 
burners in my brewery.  I said that, under the same conditions, 
my two jet burners of different make both burn cleanly and without 
causing soot on my brew pots.  Well, I was wrong.  All jet 
burners are not equal; one causes lots of soot. 
1. Morrone Cook-All: this burner has never caused soot or yellow 
     flames, and I've been looking. 
2. Masterbuilt from a smoker set: worthless burner.  Smokes a ton 
     at low and high flame alike. 
The burners have different sizes of air baffles and the Masterbuilt 
uses a lower pressure regulator, FWIW.  Hope this interests someone! 
 
And then there's the nobody'd home HBD issue.  Last go 'round, I 
recall there was only one other genuine offer to host the HBD. 
While some were not in favor, Jack Schmidling offered once upon 
a time.  Most of us voted (?) for the AOB last time, I wonder if 
Jack "Great Mill By the Way" Schmidling would be so humble?  Others?

I acidified last night for the first time ever.  At least

I had 6 qts of water, added about 1/2 tsp of lactic acid 
Ph went below 5.2, woops.

I recommend against that... CO2 at room temperature and the typical 
pressures of a partially full tank is a liquid.  Turning it over 
and opening the valve will squirt liquid CO2 which can be dangerous.

Subject: NAOB (none)


Not to slam the AOB arbitrarily, but if Scott Abene is correct that the 
AOB no longer cares about the HBD it might explain the increased number 
of (none) posts lately.  If so, maybe they should become the NAOB 
instead--NOT Association of Brewers.  As for Mike, the Digest Janitor, 
give him a break.  He seems to have a good attitude and is responsive. 
However, he's got a tough job since he isn't at the AOB and I'm sure its 
hard to fix problems remotely. 
   If Karl Lutzen can come up with an alternate site that would be 
great.

     Here's the deal: 
 
     I called the AOB yesterday and was informed that since the leaving of 
     Shawn the AOB no longer has anything to do with the HBD. 
 
     Therefore, they could really care less because all we did was bitch 
     about the way they screwed it up in the first place. 
 
     Face it people the AOB/AHA is floundering and ruining our HBD. 
 
     I have talked to Karl Lutzen from the Brewery and he is looking into 
     some options. 
 
     This Janitor in training guy is A JOKE!!! Who has No Clue how to run a

I've refrained from openly bashing the AHA/AOB until now, even though their 
support of the HBD has been less than steller.  To the less jaded among us, 
this may be a wake up call that the AOB really doesn't give a sh*t about 
home brewers at all.  The AOB apparently *is* a self-serving organization 
whose only raison d'etra is to make money for Charlie Papazian.

In 2279 Jared asks about propane burners. 
 
I use the Cajun Cooker, burner type as opposed to the "jet" type.  This has 
an output of 170K BTU's and won't turn your kettle black with soot-helps at 
cleanup time.  Works quite well, will boil 10 gal of tap water in 15-20 
mins.  The only complaint I have is that I purchased 3 of these things for a 
RIMS system and have had to replace 2 of the control valves.  The valves 
were leaking and kept a small flame in the throat when turned off, not 
exactly safe.  No affiliation...all disclaimers apply.

gee, i have one of these and mine works great!! it will only smoke if the 
air mix thing is not opened all the way. i have even used it indoors, and a 
co detector right next to the unit never went over 12ppm. the waranty on 
mine was pretty good. maybe you should see if they will fix it.

How about this: 
 
Right now the AHA is not for profit, yet people draw salaries 
'publishing' Zymurgy for the 'members'. 
 
What would happen if the HBD was set up the same way, with the 
subscribers paying a small fee to set up a server, administrator, etc. 
 
If everyone on this 'none' list chipped in $5 apiece, a new system could 
be setup...or am I just dreaming?

Subject: Repitching Dry Yeast


Would like to get some input from anyone who has experience pitching a 
new beer into the yeast cake from a previous beer fermented with dry 
yeast. I used Yeastlabs Whitbread dry to make a porter then pitched the 
yeast cake from secondary into an extra  bitter. I usually use liquid 
yeast, but since the move from Ill. to virginia beach I haven't had time 
to grow a good starter. The ferment seems to be going well, I haven't 
detected any off odors, the krausen is thick and rocky and the temp in 
the garage is 62F. I don't plan to make a habit of this, it's a first 
and I was curious as to how many brewers did this, and what were the 
results. Any feedback is appreciated private e-mail preferred.

     Why don't you brew some beer and give us all a break.  It doesn't take 
     a genuis to copy from books and post to the HBD. What is does is take 
     up the space that others could use for productive comments, rather 
     than being used by someone who is full of himself. You've had your 15 
     minutes. Give it a break.

This is very interesting to me, because, though I haven't done it , I was 
thinking 
something very similar a couple of months ago. I was taking a BJCP class, and 
they  were talking about some English methods of recirculating fermenting 
beer, in Burton Unions and Yorkshire squares. As I understood it (and I may 
have some details wrong), in the original Burton Union system, the krausening 
wort would gush out the fermenting barrels, and flow by pipes into other 
barrels that had freshly chilled wort straight from the brew pot. This way, 
the yeast would repitch itself, and there would not be a need to grow up 
yeast cultures very often. Over a period of time, the yeast adapted to the 
system, and many distinctive aspects of the flavor of Burton ales were due to 
this method of fermentation. Supposedly, much of the complexity of Bass ales 
were eliminated when 
they discarded the system. 
 
Now, I was thinking about how to do this in a homebrewing setup. It occurred 
to me it could work if you made 2 batches in fairly quick succession, maybe a 
day or two apart. The first carboy would be filled right to the top with 
fermenting wort, rather than with the usual head space; then, there would be 
a full-sized blowoff tube, the width of the carboy neck, which would go into 
another carboy. As the head is building up and working down the hose of first 
carboy, the second would be filled with wort. When the krausen gets going, it 
goes into the new beer, and fermentation begins. 
 
The reason I never tried this is that I never was able to time two batches so 
closely together. However, Rick's method would seem to resolve that problem. 
I  think it may be worth trying. Sanitation of the blowoff tube would, of 
course, be very key. I also think the effectiveness of this method would be 
dependent on the yeast, on how flocullent it is, and so on. I wonder if 
anyone else has any comments on this. Has anyone tried anything like this out 
there?
