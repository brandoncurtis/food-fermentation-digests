I picked up a very nice cast iron burner from a local store for only $40. It
was meant to be a Cajun Cooker. The display had a broken pot (which I didn't
want) so I offered to buy just the burner. I got a regulator and needle valve
with the unit for a neat $30 off. It does simmer well but not efficiently. It
stands ~2 ft high. This is a good time of year for buying floor models......


It is nice to see the HBD back on track. I am still working on a list of Web
sites. Thanks to all who have helped me with this. I have even picked up some
others, after much wading through rec.crafts.etc. Hopefully I will finish in
time for Christmas. If not, it looks like I have resolution fodder lining
right up.

Subject: Starter vs Primary fermentation


        I made a starter with Yeast Lab A05 Irish Ale using the recommended
"recipe". (5 tbs DME and two cups of water, boil, cool, pitch)
        I hardly saw a krausen in the starter and the activity was very
slow. But in the primary, (an Irish Stout) it became a real monster. Blow
off hose and everything! Lots of activity, big krausen, rolling boil kind
of fermentation.
Is this a usual occurance? This has happened a few time lately where my
starter and my primary have very different fermentations.

Hi all, and welcome back !


For a couple months now I have been experimenting with my beer fridge.


Because I keep the beast in an unheated room, when the weather turns cold, I
have a problem with the contents becomming too cold. So, I broke off the
button for turning the light on and off, and with a hot glue gun made the
switch always on. So far with a 25w bulb in place and with the fridge on a
setting just above defrost the temp has maintained 40 to 45 degrees F.


My only concern is the constant light inside and the bottles of yeast
sediment I have saved from secondarys.


Coments - criticisms ?

Subject: Gaaasssp!!!! (and Carmelization)


Whew!!!!! Talk about holding your breath.  I was turning blue and =
hallucinating about the wonderful, beautiful, sumptuous.......Oh,.... =
that's for alt. something else.


Really though, it's be so long that I just have to come out and let =
everyone know how my beer has been doing. Usually just listening and =
asking a question here and there is enough but I'm about to POP!


In September I ask about carmelization techniques for making Scotch Ale. =
All responses were about the same and this is what I did.


I used Gregory Noonan's recipe for 1991 90 Schilling Scotch Ale and =
bumped up the base malt about 10% to account for my utilization, =
otherwise I followed Noonan's recommended processes. After the specified =
rests and 1 hour sparge to get ~7 gals. I boiled approximately 15 =
minutes then removed 3 quarts for carmelization.  I reduced this 3 =
quarts down to ~1 quart over 80 minutes.
When the main boil was almost done, I added the reduced wort to the main =
batch, chilled racked to my primary and pitched. The OG was 1.065, one =
week in primary, one week in secondary, and six weeks in keg.  The FG =
was 1.012.


After the six weeks the taste was very pleasing.  The maltiness is what =
I have experienced in other Scotch Ales I've tasted, and liked, and the =
sweetness was where I thought it should be (not too sweet, but there).  =
Overall, very satisfying.....and now very gone.  The batch and process =
are worth repeating for me.


Well, I got that off my chest, now back to my current batches. And time =
for all of us to continue on where we left off (but hopefully with a =
little more consistency).

Many of us thought that the biggest threat from the aob would be from
censorship.  Little did we realize that aob would choose to destroy the 
HBD by allowing it to consume itself.  Rob Gardner restricted the daily 
output to 50KB.  He provided a mechanism whereby posters could delete 
their queued posts.  If a post was sub-standard or already answered, the 
poster deleted it.  Given time to reflect, I purged many.
 
The HBD is too important to allow to die.  Hopefully it will be picked up
by someone who cares.

too fast during the boil.






Boil it too fast? Is there such a thing? I have found that if you use 
a good heavey bottomed stainless steal pot, your wort will not scorch 
no matter how fast I boil it....

Superior cast ring burners which are really nice burners, but unless
you go with someone and buy a few, the price will be way over $90
each. 




Actually this is not true. You can get a VERY GOOD multi-jet burner 
from Pico Brewing in Ypsilanti MI for 65 bucks. (no affiliation etc 
etc).  This rig is 170K BTU and very adjustable at the low end of 
things. This burner also will not leave much (if any) soot on the 
bottom of your pots. You can find an advertisement for Pico in any of 
the brewing rags.

There was an article in the Thrid Quarter 96 issue (Vol 5, Number 3) of
the "The Malt Advocate" discussing "Vintage Beers".  While the focus was
on commercial beers, how beer is affected by aging was discussed fairly
indepth (i.e. fruit, spice, and hop cahracteristics).

Dear Collective (v. 2)


I've made an IPA that screams hops for days.  My unenlightened friends
find it too bitter.  Being the eager to please type, I was toying with
the idea
of diluting this batch with a lightly hopped batch in another carboy.
Stylistically bankrupt I know, but has anyone ever blended beer and
gotten satisfactory results?  Does two good beers make a bad beer or
will they have a synergistic effect?


BTW, thank whoever for the early Christmas present of the HBD.  You
never realize what you have got until it's gone.

Subject: Kraeusening


I've always bottled using corn sugar.  Then, I got a kegging system, and
force carbonated everything.  I would, however, like to experiment with
kraeusening my beer.  I've read CP's appendix, but would like more
information, and actually, more "real-world" anecdotal evidence.


For those of you who kraeusen your lagers and ales, how do you do it?  Is
the process the same for both lagers and ales?  What formulas do you use
for calculating how much wort to reserve?  Have you tried using different
worts (e.g. fermented brown ale with a pale ale kraeusen, or fermented
munich lager with a DME kraeusen)?  And, probably most important, are you
pleased with the results, or are the "advantages" assessed in other ways?


Lots of questions, huh?  Hopefully more will come up, too!

HBDers,,
First, welcome back everyone!  There IS a Sanni Claus.


My latest brew, a porter, was pitched with a 3rd generation primary dregs of
Brwetek's CL-10 American Ale #1 yeast (Chico?).  OG 54 FG 21!!!  
AAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHH!!


I figure the yeast just pooped out .  Batch 1 started from slant to starter and 
finished in the low teens.  Same with Batch 2 with using the primary dregs from
Batch 1.  Batch 3 started showing problems with a FG of 20. I used the dregs
from batch 3 on batch 4 (porter) and sure 'nuf another high FG (21).


So I made up a fresh starter from Wyeast's 1275 Thames Valley (about a gallon)
and poured the slurry between 2 carboys and then racked the porter onto the
yeast (no aeration)


.  Will this knock the FG down into the teens?  Should that Chico yeast have
pooped out only after 2 batches?

The Homebrew Digest has been experiencing growing pains. The Association
of Brewers (AOB) became home to a much smaller Digest in June of 1996
and has been working to keep up with the growth ever since. On November
20 growth-related technical difficulties forced temporary shutdown of
the Digest.


The ever-increasing number of subscribers and volume of messages
overloaded the AOB's computer systems. Both hardware and software
problems have been diagnosed and corrected. The Digest will be
relocating within the next two months to a site with dedicated computing
power that is able to handle the forum's increased growth. The AOB will
continue to support the Digest until it moves to its new location and
will work closely with the new site to ensure a transparent transition
for subscribers.


The Digest has doubled in size during the past six months from 2,500
subscribers to more than 5,000. The AOB is committed to keeping the
Digest up and running as a service for the homebrewing community, but
are unable to provide the service from their computer system. 


We, at the Association of Brewers, regret any inconvenience the Homebrew
Digest's technical difficulties have caused subscribers.

Several factors should be considered.  First, it must have a high
enough BTU rating (get hot enough) that it does not take an overly
long time to bring your wort to a boil.  This will depend on 1) the
volume you boil, and 2) to some degree, your patience.  You can use a
very low BTU burner (35K BTU) if you are patient.  The second factor,
and IMHO, the most important, is the burner controllable.  The 170K
BTU Jet burners, while they may be very hot and get the wort boiling
very quickly, are not as controllable on the simmer as other burners
which are available.  They will boil your wort faster than any of the
other commonly available burners, but may scorch it, or may boil it
too fast during the boil.


Burners which are available:


All sorts of "cajun cooker" burners meant for seafood cooking which
are generally the jet type and usually come with an aluminum pot and
legs. 


Superior cast ring burners which are really nice burners, but unless
you go with someone and buy a few, the price will be way over $90
each. 


Many restaurant supply houses have natural gas ring burners, but the
price will be high.


In my estimation, the widest range of burners for the least amount of
money is made by Metal Fusion.  You can buy anything they sell
directly from them, but you will pay full "list price".  You can buy
many different ones of their burners from homebrew shops.  They have
the King Kooker which comes in both the jet burner and ring burner
style and puts out 135K BTU for ring and 170K BTU for jet.  They come
on tall stands, shorts stands, round stands and square stands.  Metal
Fusion will sell individual pieces, like just ring burner and gas
regulator if you are building one into a stand.


THE BEST DEAL GOING:


Cabela's 800-237-4444
Kamp Kooker  by Metal Fusion
Spring 1994 catalog page 161
Outdoor Cooker 136k BTU
Single Burner Unit  AE-50402-000   $49.95
Double burner unit  AE-50403-000   $84.95
30" extensions legs AE-50536-200   $19.95


Fits keg perfectly, 8" high and about 12" square, also fits any sort
of pot because of the grate they use over the burner.  It is complete
and needs nothing but a propane bottle.




This is the one I use and am quite happy with it.  I have called Metal
Fusion when I first got my burner from Cabela's because one part was
missing.  They sent it out with no charge and no questions asked other
than my name and address.  When my burner was sooting up the bottom of
the pot, they sent me out a whole new burner assembly free of charge.
When I wanted to switch from propane to natural gas, one of their
technical people talked to me for 15 minutes discussing the options.
These people are one of the best companies I have ever had to deal
with.  I have no financial interest in Metal Fusion, I am just a
*very* satisfied customer.  If you need, they can even build special
stands for you (but that will cost a lot, but you know it will be done
right).

Subject: WHEW! Question on DME


WHEW! Did anyone else find him or herself becoming irritable,
twitching uncontrolably and experiencing formication (with an M)
during the early HBD withdrawal stage?


About 3 weeks ago I decided to brew a real quicky (extract) thick brown
ale to have ready for Xmas.  From memory it was:


        6 lbs. Laaglander (Laglaander?) dark Dry Malt Extract
        .5 lb crystal (unknown L)
        .5 lb black patent
        1 oz. Galena pellet
        1/2 oz. Cascade plug last minute
        1/2 ox. Cascade plug dry hop
        12 oz starter made from the above DME & Coopers yeast
        *VERY* well aerated at pitching (cooled wort siphoned through
        a sanitized strainer with a 2' drop into open plastic bucket)


The starter was not very impressive after 24 hours, but it showed
signs of activity and smalled O.K. This was the only day I would be able to brew
until after Xmas, so I had to go with it.


24 hours after pitching I had some bubbling evident in the airlock. 
24 hours later, nothing.  I was patient adn kept an eye on the lock
for the next couple of days - still nothing.  I removed the bottled
slurry from an earlier batch I had in the fridge, warmed it to
pitching temp (same as in primary), saw signs of life and pitched. 
Nothing!  A couple of days later I rehydrated and pitched the only
other yeast packet I had in the house, a Morgans dry lager pack left
over from something earlier.  Nada!  After a week I dryhopped and let
it set for another week.


OG 1.048   FG 1.038


Bottled with 5 oz. corn sugar.  I have good carbonation, and the beer
has a great thick luscious brown head like I wanted.  Just that I
wasn't looking to brew a sweet brown LA ale.


Brewing and sanitation practices were normal (for me anyway).  I had
tried rousing the yeast and introducing additional oxygen prior to
the 3rd pitch ( 3 strikes and out?).


The only thing I can think of is that this DARK DME is just chock
full of non-fermentables.  Anyone know if this is the case?  Had this
produced a little alcohol, it would have been just what I was looking
for.  Where did I screw up this time?

To All Home brew digest and rec .beer readers;


I sincerely APOLOGIZE for the ACCIDENTAL post I made to the home brew
digest just before it went down. I had received over 70 e-mails from
the digest and too hastily typed out a letter of protest, meant ONLY

any thing else but It has not. I realize that I offended many and am
truly sorry. Those that have never made a mistake won't buy this but I
hope the majority will.


P.S.   I hope this message gets out today 12/9/96, I have been trying
to post it for about two weeks, again sorry.

Hello HBD!!!  Nice to have you back!
Thanks also to Dion for the info on Metal Fusion burners -- Very good 
advice, and very timely for me.
This post reminded me of a question I was about to post around the 
middle of November.  What do all you "outdoor brewers" do for a water 
source?  I have an outdoor spigot on my porch, but I don't think I 
want to run my brewing water through 50' or so of rubber garden hose.  
I've seen the cartridge filters at Home Depot, etc. and have been 
thinking about buying one to mount to a brewing stand, etc. for a 
"clean" water supply, but don't know if this is a good way to go.  How 
could I store the filter between uses to prevent bacteria, etc. from 
taking it over?  What is the best way to go on this?  I would really 
appreciate some good advice on this and other details about brewing 
"out of the kitchen".

Subject: Indoor Propane revisited


Welcome back to the HBD.


Several months ago I sent in a question about the dangers of using
propane indoors. For the most part, the replies came back advising
against using propane indoors due to the possibility of leaks and
explosions caused by even the slightest of sparks igniting the propane
which has pooled/collected in a low lying place (in my "basement
brewery", near the furnace, perhaps?)  Not a pretty picture.  Another
concern, less severe, but very important to avoid, is the creation of
carbon monoxide.


Now the questions.  At what point would the leak be most likely to
occur?  Is it at the tank, or at the point where it connects to my
cajun cooker, or somewhere in between?  Is there anyone out there who
has eliminated most of the risks associated with indoor propane use?
Would keeping the tank outside (and running a long line to the cooker)
eliminate the risk?  If the leak is at the tank/hose connection, would
keeping the tank and a foot or so of hose submerged in a garbage can
filled with water resolve anything?


If anyone has suggestions or remedies, fast responses will be greatly
appreciated, since it's starting to get a little nipply here on Long
Island to continue outdoor brewing.

Hi,
I've located some 200K BTU jet style cookers with deflector plate
but without a regulator at ACE HARDWARE stores for $25.
I've bought one but haven't used it yet.  This is a really good

Aluminum pot sells for >$120.  Forget the pot - get the cooker.

From: MaltyDog`at`aol.com
Subject: Topping off and gravity variation


I am just posting this to the newly-reactivated HBD to see if anyone else has
had a similar experience.


Saturday, I was working on a high-gravity triple-as it turned out, it was
even a little higher gravity than I expected! (I'm beginning to think my
grain scale is off!)


Anyway, I could see it was running high, so, towards the end of the boiling,
I topped off my ten-gallon brewpot with water, to lower the gravity some.
After that I stirred the water in to mix it fairly thoroughly, though I admit
I'm a little careful about how much I stir at this point, because of worry
about hot-side aeration. 


Anway, fifteen minutes later, I turned off the heat. Then, I let the pot sit
for about fifteen or ten minutes. Then, I started running the wort through
the wort chiller, from a tap I have at the bottom of my brewpot. After a few
minutes, to let all the water I had run through the chiller to sanitize it to
run out, I took a gravity reading. It was 1.090, a little higher than I
planned!


Okay, so I fill up my first carboy. Then I get my next one ready, and start
filling it up. I decided to take another gravity reading, because I was
afraid if the water I topped off with didn't mix well with the wort, the
gravity reading for the second carboy, which was from the top of the pot,
would be lower.


Actually it was 1.100! This doesn't make any sense to me at all!  I would
think the gravity from the second half of the chill, if it were different,
would be lower, because the water sat at the top off the pot, and didn't mix
with the heavier wort. But it was higher! It doens't make any sense to me.


A couple of hours later, I check the gravity in each carboy, just to verify
that the gravity variation wasn't just due to some water in the wort chiller.
Sure enough, one carboy was 1.090, and the other was 1.100.


It looks as if my yeast has some work cut out for it.


Can anyone explain why this happened?

Subject: Hop Pellets


Welcome back to all the HBDr's out there!  During the time the digest was down,
I had my brother pick up some brewing supplies for me and he mistakenly brought
back hop pellets instead of whole flowers, which I'm used to using.  Now that I
have them I'm actually looking forward to using them (K. Goldings) in a Pale
Ale.


I'm assuming my brewing process will be essentially the same, only there  will
be no "sparge" following immersion chilling, only waiting to allow the hops and
trub to settle out prior to racking to primary.  Any hints/warnings/suggestions
would be welcome.

Subject: Re: No sparge


Good to see the HBD back on-line; someone can turn off
Al Korzonas' life support system now.


Through some discussion on the Digest before the Crash,
I had gotten the notion of doing a no-sparge mash, with
the intention of replicating George Fix's success in
enhancing malt flavor.  When I get a chance, I'll
send along some details, but for now, let's say I'm
a convert.


My basement has gotten pretty cool lately, so I decided
to do something with Wyeast 2112 (a steam beer, natch!),
and try George's technique at the same time.  Big success
all around, a sort of steam bock.  Because I was uneasy
about the whole idea, I added less water than I had 
originally planned, and ended up with a stronger beer,
and less of it.  Very nice result for the season,
however, and the main point is that the results seem
to bear out George's idea: malt flavor was *very*
high, relative to beers I've brewed to a similar OG
(1.060).  Lots of hops, too, as I used another technique
I learned from George: first wort hopping.


As I said, details to follow (if not here, then in
BYO magazine).  For the time, though, I'm sold.
