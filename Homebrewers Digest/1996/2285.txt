Someone else re-posted George's description of the process, and I

the *why* of the process, not Jeff.  Trust me.

Because I wanted to do a two-step infusion and need to use boiling
water to achieve the second step, I ended up with a fairly thin mash,
so *most* of the liquid in the kettle had been in the mash tun at 
some time.  Don't have my notes to hand, but I didn't add more than
a couple of gallons of the seven gallons in the kettle. 


My (admittedly limited) understanding of the principle is that
sparging beyond a certain point has a negative effect on the 
malt flavor, in essence, and this is an extreme approach.  Bear
in mind that you have to add about 1/3 more malt, which has probably
got a lot to do with the flavor.  But, hey, ask George.  I'm just
another datapoint on George's research curve.

Ditto.  Definitely add positive results with the hop *flavor* and
have taken it as a new, standard procedure in brewing.  Anything that
works.  But for aroma, I'll stick to late hopping and dry hopping 
(especially dry hopping).

Help!


I brewed an ale this weekend and I used 6lbs. of liquid malt extract 
(Premier) and 1lb. of dry malt extact.  The problem I am having is when 
I took a hydrometer reading on the wort before I pitched my Glenbrew 
secret brewers yeast, btw, it showed 1.030.  This seems very low to me 
considering the amount of fermentables +7lbs!  I was expecting 1.050+. 


:(


I put the hot wort into my carboy first, before I added water to fill up 
to 5 gals.  Is it possible that my wort wasn't properly mixed causing it 
to be higher in water on top and heavier in wort on the bottom?  One 
qlue that this might be the problem is that the wort was warmer on the 
bottom than it was on top before I pitched the yeast.


Can someone please help me out.  I'm afraid that I might end up with a 
major whimpy beer.  TIA.

Cathy,


Thank you for your letter about the AOB corporate structure and your
HBD efforts.  Since I am a newbie to homebrewing, (and having an
absolute ball by the way), I have missed a lot of the brew-ha-ha about
the HBD problems.  I subscribed just before it went down and was
immediately hooked.   This is one of the best boards for new and old
timers alike on the entire Internet!  I learned more truely useful
information  from the HBD in a short time than any of the brewers
around my hometown could provide.  For this I thank you.


Thank you also that you have taken so much time and spent so much
effort and money to continue to provide this valuable service for the
homebrewing community.  With all the talk about boycotts, the 'free'
advice about how to do what you are trying to do, and the telling of
exactly why and what you are 'doing wrong', I just wanted to say that
you and the efforts of your staff are appreciated!  The Home Brew
Digest is a noble effort and I encourage you to continue.  


The saying comes to mind "No good deed will go unpunished".  Please
don't let the impatience and intolerance of a VERY TINY number of
people discourage you.  I know there are many others like me who are
excited about what you are doing and content to wait out the process. 
To those who are not I say "relax, don't worry, have a homebrew".


Wishing you and your staff a very merry and blessed Christmas!

I'm no expert, but from my Micro Bio 101 days I remember this discussion. 
 Themophillic bacteria don't deal with normal fermenting temps to well.


If you have an older house like I do, I would be more concerned with lead 
leaching from solder joints.  I always use water from the cold side of the 
faucet for cooking and brewing.


I'll let the *real* experts tackle the mineral question, I would guess you

Hello brewers and brewsters,


        I'm just enjoying my effforts at my first Holiday Ale. It's an
all-grain, DME enhanced, hopped, spiced pale ale. The color is amazing,
it's one of the cleareast beers I've brewed, the flavors are great, nutmeg,
cinammon, vanilla, orange and honey, etc.... the only trouble is, no head
retention!!!! I pour it out, I get a nice head and almost immediately it
vanishes. The beer is still "fizzy", no lace, no head :-(


        I used enough Crystal Malt and Wheat Malt, and the FG is around
1.020 so there's plenty of body. I also "dry spiced" in the carboy... I
dunno, Now, I'm usually pretty good at figuring out what's gone wrong in my
batches and I think the problem is Orange Zest (peel).


        Could the oils from the orange peel kill the head retention? What
could I do to remedy this next year? What do you think?

You should be able to e-mail Centennial from MOST homebrew shops. If 
you cannot find them local try Hoptech at 1-800-DRY-HOPS. Mark Garetz 
has many types of hops available.


As for a substitute. Perhaps Cascade? Its a poor substitute IMHO, as

Hello All, 


I'm relatively new to brewing (only done about 8 batches, 1 beer, the rest
mead and ciders), and I was wondering if anyone had any idea of how to
'sweeten' a wine/cider and still plan on carbonating it by adding priming
sugar before bottling. The way I see it is that you either have to go dry
and prime, or you use a sulfide/stabilizer to kill the yeast, add the
sugar, then force carbonate with a kegging system. I'd love to be able to
have my cake an eat it too, so are there methods of adding sugars that will
not ferment, yet still taste okay in the brew? any suggestion or experience
on the subject?

Fellow HBDers,


 I have gotten into a habit of making the same beer over and over. The reason 
is because I enjoy it, makes sense huh. It is an ale with Fuggles hops for 
bittering and E. Kent Goldings for aroma and requires a single step infusion 
mash. What I'm looking for is another recipe that may be your favorite which 
uses different hops than the above and is an ale (i.e. IPA, etc). If any of you 
have suggestions please email me the recipe of your choice at 
bbessett`at`pictel.com...


Cheers,

In reading Miller and Pap., they advocate skimming the head from a

I've got an APA w/1056 that was brewed on Sun. and the airlock is down
to about 3/min. As I'm always interested in improving my brews, does
anyone have a recommendation as to when or if I should skim, assuming
that opening the lid is O.K.? Also, AOB/AHA aside, I prefer to think
that it was the off-topic bullshit that killed the old HBD. Karma an'

        I'm sorry Alex, but I think you're confused as to what a partial
mash is! A partial mash is a mini-mash. It's done exactly the same as a
full-mash using the same grain to water ratio, except that you use less
grain than a full mash. To make a 5 gallon batch, you get the rest of your
fermentable from LME, DME and/or Sugar.
        I think what you may be referring to is a "grain infusion" which is
a method to add specialty malts to extract brewing. In this case, the
amounts are usually so small, that I don't think they could account for
bitterness unless of course you boil it for a while!

        Again, I disagree. I made myself a Zapap lauter tun and took the
plunge into partial mashes by my third or fourth batch. The difference in
the taste of the beer was obvious right from the start. I think it's a
great way to get into grain brewing without buying anymore equipment. Once
you've saved up, you can go out and get something big enough to boil 7
gallons in, then you take the next step and go all-grain.


        BTW, I've been told that some mashers actually don't mash their
specialty malts (Crystal, Roasted, Chocolate, etc.). They just mash the
2-row, 6-row, Munich, etc. and then they either add the specialty malts at
the end of the mash, or steep it in the kettle. What does everybody else
do???

My experience has been much the same as Al's with respect to lager
conditioning. Generally I lager for two to three months. After this I bottle
the beer and leave at about 65 - 68 degrees F for two to three weeks. I have
had good carbonation in as little as 7-10 days. I can not comment on
krausening since I have not tried it yet. It may very well result in quicker
more thorough carbonation. My concern would be clarity and sediment, if that
type of thing bothers you.


Now, for a question. Recently while re-reading a portion of one of Dave
Miller's guides, he suggests moving the bottled beer to a temperature of 50
- - 55 degrees F. after the bottling sugar has been fermented (I assume 7 -10
days). His reasoning is that co2, that developes in the head space, will be
reabsorbed into the beer quicker. Applying the same principles used for
forced carbonation at lower temps, this seems to make sense, not to mention
that it would help to minimize the oxidation effects of higher temperatures
and slow autolysis. Would even lower temps help expedite this process,
assuming all bottle fermentation is complete?


Any thoughts?

Top of the morning to ye all,

would like to in the past.

I think that this is without doubt one of the understatements of the
century.  In fact the Board of Advisors has for the most part been
ignored.  If you know a member ask how much their input has been
considered.  I have asked a couple of the members of the Board of
Advisors, we had two in our area, if their input was considered.  They
said no.


>>prestigious group of people. The Board of Advisors<<


How can you feel prestigious if you are ignored?


I keep hearing that the AHA is a membership organization.  Yet I have
never received a ballot to vote for the President of the AHA, a member of
the Board of Directors of the AOB, nor even the Board of Advisors.


I have to believe that anyone who is  chosen to the Board of Advisors
will be well house broken to the ideas and purpose of the Board of
Directors and the President of the AHA.  I question if these folks would
be chosen if their choice were left up to the "MEMBERSHIP" (chuckle,
chuckle).


I feel that this digest is an example of the competence of the AOB/AHA
VAST IDEAS with HALF VAST RESOURCES.


I allowed my "membership" in the AHA to lapse, but I assure you that if I
as a member were allowed to vote for the President of  the AHA I would
renew just to vote in a new President.

Hey Neighbors,


Thanks AOB for reviving the HBD.  


Here is a personal experience with stuck fermentation using Laaglander
Light DME that might shed some light on why people are having problems
with this product.  When I first started brewing (six years ago), on my
second batch I tried Laaglander LDME for the first time and the
fermentation stuck, brew another and it stuck and brewed a third and
again it stuck.  I called the supplier and all sorts of homebrew supply
advice line folks to help solve this frustrating dilemma.  Tried all the usual
advice steps like pitching yeast again, put heating pad under carboy
which only grew some great looking spaghetti micro-bacteria stuff in the
wort.  
So,  just when I was at the point of chucking this really stupid hobby of
making my own beer and pouring 15 gallons of sweet crap and yeast
down the drain I called my supplier again and this time he informed that
Laaglander had mistakenly supplied him with 4 tons of baking or pastry
quality DME instead of brewing DME.  Apparently  Laaglander makes DME
for the baking industry as well as the brewing industry.  The baking DME
will not ferment out as complete as the brewing DME.  
So the moral of the story, buy Munton & Fison DME to be safe, perhaps
suppliers are still receiving the wrong product%^)   Oh yea...I don't think
it's stupid anymore.


Hope this helps someone.

My friends and I just finished a party pig from the Roffey Brew Company
in Holland Mi.  The pale ale was excellent all around with noticeably 
strong hop aroma.


What makes this experience unique for me is that Jim Roffey,  the
owner and founder of the Roffey Brew Company, was the  guy that
got me into brewing five or six years ago.  We brewed for a
couple of years in his kitchen, but then he got married and we
had to brew in the basement.  Jim wasn't satisfied with the
basement nano-brewery, so he quit his nice stable engineering job
at a major airplane manufacturing company, moved from Seattle to
Holland Michigan and is now making a living brewing beer.  I love
this hobby.


Anyway, if you are in Holland Michigan and you want a good beer
now you know where to go.

First, Al piqued my interest in V2 #3 when running though beers he dry hops
he wrote "Sticke (a dryhopped version of Duesseldorfer Altbier)".  Sounds
great!  Al would you have a grain profile and hop/yeast suggestions?


Second,  I've been thinking about using popcorn as an adjunct for upcoming

Subject: RE: Yeast bite / Partial mash:  George De Piro


     Hello again!
     
     Al K. writes that he doesn't believe autolysis is a problem these 
     days.  I have to agree; I've let beer sit on the primary yeast for 
     embarrassingly long periods of time without a problem (well, not 
     autolysis, anyway).
     
     Is autolysis "yeast bite", though?  From what I've read, I thought of 
     autolysis as a rubbery, sulphury, rotten yeast flavor.  Isn't "yeast 
     bite" more of a sharpness, imparted by yeast that has remained 
     suspended in the beer?  Any opinions?
     
     -----------------------------
     
     Alex Santic ponders the usefulness of partial mashing, concluding that 
     it seems pointless.  This is also my opinion.  As I've written 
     somewhere before, I think that the jury rigged equipment that most 
     people (myself included) use for partial mashing produces inferior 
     results and makes lautering seem much harder than it is (I remember 
     trying to use a big colander as a lauter tun...what was I thinking!).
     
     If you currently brew from extract, and are considering taking the 
     grain plunge, do yourself a favor: forget the partial mash, go all the 
     way!  Fortune favors the bold!
     
     This is, of course, just my opinion, born from my own experience.
     
     Have fun!

     Al K. wrote in response to my post about removing hop pellets from the 
     wort:
     
     >I find just the contrary in my system.  I use an easymasher-like 
     >screen in my kettles and it clogs almost immediately with pellets.  
     
     Yes, it makes sense that the finely shredded pellets would clog your 
     screen.  Note that I said that pellets are easy to remove by 
     whirlpooling; they will settle to the center of the kettle.  If you 
     are using an easy masher type of thing, then the pellets will settle 
     on it!  That's a bad thing.
          
     Al also writes that his lager experience is different from mine, and 
     that he doesn't have to kraeusen:
     
     >My experience is very different from this.  Recently, I bottled a 
     >Bock and a Doppelbock which were fermented and lagered at 45F for

     >carbonated in three weeks at 65F.
      
     I think the big difference here is that I lager my beers near 
     freezing.  I believe that 45F is too warm for lagering (just my 
     belief), and I certainly wouldn't bottle condition at 65F.  Heck, I 
     ferment my lagers at 45F, so I wouldn't expect the yeast to go dormant 
     after three months at 45F.
     
     After a few months at below 32F (0C), the beer is incredibly clear and 
     the yeast is quite sleepy!
     
     So, if you lager like Al, then priming should work.  If you lager very 
     cold, then priming is a crapshoot.  Kraeusen it, or spund your unitank 
     (one person is giggling...).

Subject: No sparge brewing


Louis K. Bonham  responded to my post of questions about no sparge brewing.
Essentially my questions were:
1) Would the amount of water in the mash tun, including the mash out addition,
   affect the maltiness of the resulting beer.
2) With no sparge the collected wort should be of higher gravity that would
   need to be diluted to reach the desired OG or less grain would be used with
   more mash out water (see 1 above).


Louis thinks I missed the point and am confusing gravity with maltiness but I
don't think so.  My point is that if no sparge brewing really works then it
must matter how much water is in the tun at run off.  With a tun full after
mash out some of the effects of sparging must surely be seen.  Also, if the
higher gravity wort is diluted with plain water to reach the desired OG why
isn't the maltiness diluted as much as if the dilution were the result of
sparging?  The only thing I can think of is that sparging washes out a higher
proportion of fermentable sugars than are in the first runnings, having
somewhat the same effect as using adjuncts like flaked corn or perhaps
even corn sugar.  If the sparged runnings are higher in fermentable sugars
then perhaps the resulting beer would be thinner with less body (maltiness?).
If this is the case, it would seem the FG should be lower with the sparged
beer.  Has this been observed?


If anyone knows why no sparge brewing results in more maltiness I have
not seen the explanation.  Of course, this would not be the only thing about
brewing that is not completely understood.  I suppose the best thing to do is
try it and see.  However, I don't ever seem to make the same beer twice so
I am not sure if my comparison will be valid.  As long as it is good to drink,
however, the time and grain will not have been wasted.
What a great hobby.

Subject: Need help with electric thermometer


Hey Neighbors,


As a quasi-master of turning junk into brewing equipment I have yet
another piece I'm trying to adapt to my brewery.  It's an electric analog
thermometer salvaged from an industrial solar control panel.  It's range is
from 0 to 250 df.  It measures 1.25''w x 4''L x 3.25''D black plastic body
with a clear convex plastic cover over the gauge.  On the back are two
electrical posts, one post is marked positive with a single lead and the
other is unmarked with two leads.  I believe this works with a low
voltage DC current and a submersible temp. probe.  The is no
manufactures name to be found on the thermometer but there are
several numbers and some letters (FSIDCMA).  I would like to use this in
my brewery but I have no idea how to hook it up.  Does anyone out there
know what type of thermometer I have so I might be able to contact the
manufacture or order a probe and supply current to it.  I have exhausted
every contact in my local area to no avail so you guys are my last hope. 
Any help is greatly appreciated.

This is vaguely related, so bear with me...


Time is the most expensive ingredient for me.  Setup, cleanup...
it's all the same whether you do one batch or two, really.


Last Saturday, in 8 hours, I made 4.75 gallons of 1.070 IPA and
11.5 gallons of 1.043 Special Bitter, from one (sort of) mash.
The initial mash started with 24.75# of M&F Pale Ale malt.  From
this I took the first runnings and made the IPA in my old 10 gal
kettle.  While this was boiling, I added 3# of crystal malt and
took another 14 gallons of runnings which I boiled down to 11.5
gallons while the IPA wort was being chilled, oxygenated, pitched,
etc.  I don't have great hopes for the Special Bitters... it was
the IPA which I was really trying to make, but I couldn't let
all those sugars go to waste.  The Bitters (two different yeasts)
will probably not win any competitions, but with 2 hours more time
(I could have quit after 6 hours and have just the IPA) I have
11.5 gallons of session beer.  The rub is that you need two kettles
and my mashtun is 18.75 gallons, but other than that, it's easy.

Subject: Wife Ale / Mashing Rice


After years of making good ales and porters, I've decided
to try to draw my wife into the homebrewing experience by 
brewing a beer that she might actually like.  


She's strictly a Michelob drinker, but over the years I've
gotten her to venture into "heavier" (her term) beers such
as Corona, SA lightship, Shipyard light, etc ...so I think
she's "primed" for a lite homebrew.  Here's the recipe I'm
planning to use:


WIFE ALE  
5 lbs American Pale malt
2 lbs Uncle Bens Converted Rice
0.5 oz EKG whole hops (6.6 alpha) (60min)
0.5 oz EKG whole hops (6.6 alpha) ( 5min)
Wyeast American Ale yeast
        (recipe for 5 US gallons)


I'm planning a single step infusion mash at 150F.
I'm using EKG hops because I have a half pound in
the freezer. 


My first question:  What do I do with the rice?
Some Ideas I've picked up from back issues of HBD,
  (and a few of my own): 
        a) Just include it uncooked in the mash
        b) boil it first, until just tender
        c) boil it until it's well overcooked                
        d) eat it for dinner and put something
                else in the beer.
My Second Question: Is Uncle Ben's Converted an
        appropriate rice to use? I chose it only
        because it's the rice we typically have
        around the house.
My last question: Any comments on this recipe
        which might improve it would be greatly
        appreciated.

coolers, one for lager fermentations, one for ales, plus a lagering fridge...
there's a restaurant supply place near here that has a dozen 6-door

Iodophor is not just Iodine in phosphoric acid. Iodine (I^2) is not even
soluble in phosphoric acid. What is sold as iodophor is Iodine in a carrier
molecule. One I know of is polyvinylpyrrolidone, and the complex is called
PVP-I. The stuff we have in the lab is 11% w/w iodine, the rest being the
polymer. This makes a stable solution of Iodine in water that doesn't
gas-off the way a drop of tincture of Iodine (an alcohol solution of I^2)
would; i.e. it is a much more stable solution of iodine because of the
carrier.


I recall others saying that iodophor is sold in farm and dairy supply
stores; just be sure that it is free of detergents.
