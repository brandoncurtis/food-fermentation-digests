here's a tip:  have some acidified brewing water ready at this point, and use
it to dilute your decoction to such a degree that scorching is not problematic.
make sure the pH stays down below 6.0, preferably around 5.5.  if  trying to
boil the thick decoction without diluting it, i've found it's easy to scorch.




>  Add decoction back to main mash and stabilize at 155F.


just a note of caution - be careful when you do this and monitor the temp.
closely, especially if you're taking 3/4 of the mash for the decoction. you
may overshoot your sacch. temp. otherwise.

i have noticed that my single decocted pilsners take on a gold color, very 
close to sam adams boston lager, when they're based on nothing but dwc pils
and briess carapils.  yours may come out a bit darker if you're adding some
of the higher kilned pale malts (aromatic, etc.) or the crystal malts. give
it a shot.

John, you're a fine metallurgist, but not much of a geometrician! 8-)
Actually, the formula for volume change, given a length of l and a length
change of dl, is approximately dV = 3*l^2 *dl, or 3*14.5^2*.0209 = 13.2 in^3.
Much more than a few drops, but still not large enough to worry about in
doing mash efficiency calculations.

Two of the more interesting ideas which popped up on adding coffee to
beer.
- -Adding 1/4 pound and steeping 20 min after the boil.
- -Adding 1 cup of brewed coffee at bottling time.


I will most likeley try a combo of these two techniques.  Thanks again

On Decoction.  I have had really good Dopplebock results by boiling a
small (6 cup) portion of the mash for a little extra heat in a two stage
infusion process.  It seemed to help Malt flavor without going through
the rigors of a full decoction (wich is a real pain.) Best of all, it
didn't take any extra time from my normal mash.

Yes, I've been innoculating new slants directly from old for about 4 years.
I usually have about 12 to 15 slants on hand so I've got a pretty decent
track record.


Reculturing every 6 months works well for me with one exception: I've had
two cultures of Wyeast 1056 die on me.  That is, reculturing after 6 months
produced no growth on the new slant.  I now reculture 1056 every 4 months and
have had no problems since.

Subject: Plastic kettles


    Daryl K Kalenchuk asks about plastic kettles.


I have been using a 15 gal blue plastic (HDPE #2) container for the last
dozen or so batches with very satisfactory results. The plastic seems to be
very able to contain and handle the boiling wort.


The particular container that I am using is one that was from the homebrew
store, it was originally used to hold liquid malt extract.  These should be
easy to obtain from your homebrew source.  Just let them know you want one.
I paid $7 for mine.  I figured since it was used to hold malt extract then
it should be food safe.  The first time I tried it I just boiled water for
an hour then tasted it to see if any off flavors could be detected, and I
was quite pleased to find very clean tasting water with no detectable off
flavors.


I use an electric heater 4500 watt 220 volt element with a 'homebrew' power
controller to throttle the heat.  I can reach boiling in about 45 minutes
for 12 galons of liquid. This is so much more convenient than those noisy
rocket blasters with propane.  Just use a paddle type wood bit to make the
hole in the side of the bucket for the heater element and another one for a
ball valve.


The Brewery web site has plenty of information on plastic boilers, (and lots
of other stuff too).

I used to think this too (i.e. pebbles in the river don't affect the
water's SG), but in my experience, there *is* a significant effect.
Try this: next time you brew, save 16 oz of trub-laden wort from the
bottom of the kettle.  Measure the SG when it's murky.  Let it
settle and measure it again.  I did this and there was a pretty big
difference.  I don't know which bit of science proves this is true,
but in practice, it is.

The tables say that 15psi `at` 45F will result in 2.51 volumes of CO2 in
the beer, so that's where it will stop.  I've had some beers on CO2 for
3 months without overcarbonating.

Didn't someone post a year ago or so, that the dyes in pantyhose can come
out of them?  Personally, I use to use fine nylon mesh bags (L.D.Carlson
is the wholesaler) for hops in the kettle.  They are white nylon mesh and are
(I believe) made for fruit straining or something like that.  They have
worked well for me on over 200 batches.  Recently I've changed my kettle
design and now use whole hops loose in the boil, but I've had only good
experiences with those white nylon mesh bags.  As for dryhopping, I never
have used a hop bag -- I just use whole hops and toss them into the primary
(yes, primary) and put a screen on the end of my racking cane when racking
to the priming carboy or Corny keg.

Subject: tannins and no sparge


I had a couple of thoughts about sparging, no-sparging, tannin
extraction, etc.


I've always considered the sparging process similar to making a pot of
tea, in terms of the chemical processes involved anyway.  In preparing
tea, it's critical not to let the tea steep (sparge) too long,
otherwise you'll end up with a bitter cuppa.  The reason is that the
pleasant flavor compounds (including caffeine) are extracted early in
the steeping process, while the bitter flavor compounds begin being
extracted later in the process.  Sparging is very similar to the
steeping of tea, in that hot water is in continual contact with the
leaves/husks in order to "wash" chemicals from the grain.  The
arbitrary cut-off of sparging until you reach a SG of 1.010 may in
fact be a rule of thumb on how long you should sparge, i.e. really
more of a time limit.  After 90 minutes you're no longer retrieving
any flavor compounds, just bitter compounds which can quickly
overwhelm the others.


I could also see how this relates to the perceived malti-ness of
no-sparge brews.  The sparging process is extracting many flavor
compounds, some of which will balance the malt flavor of your wort.
If you don't sparge, these compounds will not be in your wort, and
even if you dilute with H20, you'll still have a maltier wort than you
would if you added the sparge flavor compounds.  Very similar to the
manner hop bitterness can balance with malt flavors to produce an
"even flavored" brew.


My $0.015 anyway.

P.S. Jethro, I think you're making some of these acronyms up on

Hi all


I just picked up a jar of _Ovaltine_ at the store and was wondering if
anyone
had previous experience using this product in homebrew.


Paul >> brewin' and relaxin' in Deposit,NY


Paul:
It occurs to me that I may well be the only man on the face of the
planet that has brewing experience with this particular item. Let me
explain. I first started homebrewing in 1971. At that time Homebrewing
was illegal in the United States, which didn't trouble me much, as I was
a draft-resisting-leftist-leaning-semi-anarchist college student (ah,
those were the days!) I was also poor, as may be expected, and loved
beer. I saw homebrewing as a method of getting beer cheaply. At that
time, about the only place you could get beer-making materials of any
kind was from England, a process which took a minimum of three to four
months. This was depressing to someone as used to instant gratification
as I, so I took to "experimenting" and making brews, some fair, some
foul out of what was available. According to my surviving notes. (Much
of that period was lost in a housefire in 1983) I was in the Navy in
about 1974 or 75 (How I went from being an SDS member to Navyman is a
story that is too long for this venue). During one boring weekend, I was
discussing homebrewing with a fellow gob, Ken Venable. He was all
excited at the prospect of a project that might one day result in
intoxication from a product we made ourselves. Well, We hopped in the
car and proceeded to look for malt syrup. No luck. Malt syrup (Blue
Ribbon) was a popular tonic in Mississippi where I was stationed, and we
couldn't find it in stock anywhere. In desperation, we turned to
unflavored Ovaltine, and in a mad dash bought about 12 pounds of the
stuff, just about every jar from every store within a 20 mile radius of
Meridian Mississippi. We chose unflavored (do they even make unflavored
any more?) because we were hoping it would be more "beer-like" than
Chocolate. I dunno, maybe we could have made a heck of a chocolate
porter... At any rate, we took it home poured the whole lot into a three
gallon stockpot, boiled the dickens out of it, added about a ton of cane
sugar into it, some plain karo syrup, two pounds of brown sugar, and
some hops extract from some brew-supply store in Kent, England, and
using a few packages of baker's yeast, poured the whole mess into a new
plastic garbage can which we covered with a sheet of plastic and set
under the moble home to ferment. Amazingly enough, it did ferment and
dispite everything we could do to it, didn't get infected. After a
couple of weeks, we remembered it and bottled it with a teaspoon of cane
suger in each bottle (Quit shuddering, this was 1975, we didn't know any
better. Charlie Papiazan was a college student at the time.) After a
week of "conditioning" we tried a bottle. It was... different. It was
dark, about like a bock, and suprisingly clear as I recall, given the
baker's yeast, and other assorted crap. It wasn't exactly beer. I don't
think beer comes with a distinct taste of vanilla (the karo syrup?) but
it sure was alcoholic, and that's all that really mattered. We
eventually found a good source of blue ribbon syrup, and the experiment
was not repeated. As I recall, we eventually made some pretty fair
beers. I do know we eventually drank all of that ovaltine, but it wasn't
easy. I don't think the Great American Brew Fest is going to make a
category for this brew anytime soon. Don't know if this helps you, but
it was fun to recall.

different yeast strains in a usual unique Belgian manner:  the wort is
separated into two batches of unequal size and fermented with the yeasts
separately, being filtered and mixed at the end of fermentation.  No one
mentioned if both yeasts are in 1388 or not.  In any case, primary
fermentation occurs for 5-6 days (16-28C/60-82F) - what a large temperature
range, then shifted to secondary (cold maturation vessels) and the temp
lowered over 3 days to freezing for 3-4 weeks, then taken to -3C (26) to
precipitate the yeast.  After filtering and mixing, one of the yeasts is
added back in along with some priming dextrose.  There is actually quite a
bit more to the process,  I am just relating the items affecting the yeast.
Wow, an ale that has to be lagered?  This yeast is obviously requires some
unusual temperature steps.
     I don't have the capability to conduct this temperature step method,
but I will put the carboy my lagering refrigerator and see what I get (I'm
afraid to put it in the garage since it is 0F/-18C outside right now).  I'll
probably eventually transfer to a corny keg to condition, and eventually
bottle.  Bottom line with this yeast is that it is NOT one of the easier to
use yeasts, but eventually produces an excellent, fruity beer.  On user
mentioned that he had bottled while still cloudy after 3 weeks in the
secondary, and within a week it had cleared.  I think I may use 1388 next in
a 1 gallon batch of a mead if I am going to have to wait and wait.  For my
next Belgian, I'll probably use 1762 Belgian Abbey II - supposedly Rochefort
- - which is reported to ferment and clear very fast.  I guess that by the
time a homebrewer feels up to doing Belgian styles, it is a whole new paradigm.
The secret to life is to die young, but to delay it as long as possible!!!

Subject: Dry hopping & nasties


Recently, someone advised boiling hops before dry hopping to sanitize
them.
As Jethro pointed out, boiling defeats the whole purpose of dry hopping,
but
a recent article by Drs. Guinard & Lewis and their students (MBAA
Technical
Quarterly, Vol. 27, pp. 83-89) goes further, and explodes the myth that
dry 
hopping risks infection.  I'll quote the abstract of this article in
full:


"The microbial flora of Cascade, Chinook, and Williamette hops and of
fermentations dry-hopped after innoculation or after three days with 
Cascade of Chinook hops was characterized.  A few yeasts belonging to 
the genera Saccharomyces, Candida, and Cryptococcus were isolated from 
hops along with many bacteria, mostly enterics.  None of these micro-
organisms survived in dry-hopped fermentations after the second day
of fermentation.  This study suggests that dry-hopping does not
represent
a significant risk for contamination of beer."


Ergo, as long as you dry-hop after primary fermentation (i.e., after the
yeast 
has dropped the pH of the wort substantially and after the ethanol level
is 
3% or so), you probably needn't worry about dry-hopping causing a
significant 
level of nasties in your beer.

Wouldn't it be simpler to use a longer hose and bend it back on itself, 
and pour a little water into the tube?


This would look and act like the trap under a sink.  You could even bend 
the top of the hose down, so that nasties couldn't get in.


The hose would have to be long enough to prevent any suck-back from when the 
fermentation temperature drops, at the end of fermentation.

Subject: skimming your wort when boiling


Hi Guys


Ron Narvaez asked about the foam he gets when boiling.  I'd like to add to that:


I get a sort of creamy-grey scum/foam on my wort as I raise it from mashing/sparging temperature to boiling point.  I've been skimming most of it off, and when boiling is achieved it doesn't reappear. In fact it seems to disappear into the wort.  All this happens before I add the hops (unlike Ron, who seems to get it after hopping).


I have never seen mention of this in any books.


1. Am I doing the right thing by skimming it?
2. Does anyone know what is causing it?
3. Is my mashing technique at fault (I don't think so since I have occasionally extract brewed and get the same effect)? 
4. Could it be caused by the emersion element in the boiler?


Any thoughts?


Neil Kirk


PS  Can we have less of the personal attacks.  This sort of vitriol (V2.10) is not necessary and simply cheapens the HBD.

Yup, that's really what's being said. Nobody has come up with a technical
explanation yet, the mystery being that flavor compounds could probably
not be extracted preferentially to sugar. The most plausible suggestion so
far has been that the sparge extracts compounds that neutralize or mask
some of the malt flavor. It's a reasonable speculation of you consider
what an important role *balance* plays in beer flavor. The proportion of
any particular flavor component affects the perception of other flavor
components (i.e., add bitterness and the beer tastes less sweet). 


>To successfully conduct a no sparge mash, does the mash need to be thinned
>out substantially to get close to the boil volume you are aiming for? 


No, you would typically collect half or less and then top up with water. 
As you've noticed, we've been discussing ways of planning this better. 
But you don't have to do any intricate calculations if you don't want. 
Just use about a third more grain and drain the grain bed at the end of 
the mash. You might not hit your OG dead center, but you'll be in the 
ballpark and you can always adjust your hopping rates or whatever once 
you see what you've got.

Subject: wort aeration


Hi fellow brewers


I've been receiving HBD for a few month now, and this is my first foray into contribution.  So I hope it works.


I am a grain brewer living in England mainly brewing ales and wheat beers, which I have been doing on and off for about 25 years.  This has been pretty much in isolation since none of my friends are interested in anything but the drinking stage of the process.  So it's good to have company.


The question is, why is everyone getting so hung up about wort aeration in connection with final gravities?


I used to aerate, but one day forgot.  The result was a beer with a freshness that I didn't know was missing. And that slightly off taste that I had been trying to persuade myself was really quite nice had gone. 


I've always thought that you aerate the wort to ensure that your yeast established itself quickly by allowing it to multiply and spread aerobically (ie in the presence of air (oxygen)).  This is done mainly  to ensure that no other nasties (eg wild yeasts etc) get there before your yeast has taken over. Later in fermentation, the yeast reverts to anaerobic behaviour and completes its task of converting sugar to alcohol without oxygen.  So I cannot see how the amount of oxygen in solution at the start of fermentation will significantly affect the level to which fermentation will proceed.


The only problem I can see if you don't aerate is that the yeast does not establish well at the start, and this is much more likely to cause other problems (eg off tastes and infection).


I do not aerate my wort except during run-off after the boil (ie whilst the wort is still hot).  When the wort is down to pitching temperature I (carefully) stir in my yeast starter culture (about 1:40, starter:wort) and we're away.  Fermentation is well established in 12 hours, and the beer (almost) invariably ferments down to the desired FG (sometimes faster than I would like).  In this way I am pretty certain that any airborne nasties don't get in my lovely wort and so I end up with a fresh, full flavoured beer that keeps well.


Someone please re-educate me!


Good brewing


Neil Kirk

There was a post pondering what the second hole in those orange carboy caps

hole and you blow into the second hole (or use a low pressure pump if you're

  OFFICE MEMO          Coffee Beer                            Date:12/19/96


   I put about 1/4# of coffee in my last beer, see previous HBDs V1 for
recipe, and I added it just after removing the pot from the boil.  Basically I
steeped the grains at the end since you do not want to boil coffee.  The aroma
was wonderful in the cooling pot but non-existent in the bottled beer.  Since
the beer was a chocolate stout, I'm not sure how much flavor the coffee
actually added.  When I made Papazian's Imperial Stout recipe it had a coffee
flavor but there was no coffee in it--just roasted grains.  So the advice to
put 1/4-1/2# is probably a good starting point. Realize that the flavor will
depend on what else you put in the recipe, particularly specialty grains. 
Experiment with your favorite porter or stout and pour a little actual coffee
in the glass before adding your beer.  Then scale up to your batch size, let
us know how it turns out.

Subject: Specific Gravity of suspended particles...


Greetings all!  I should introduce myself first.  I'm a brewer in Seattle
(currently) and have been brewing for a couple of years.  I certainly do
not claim to be an expert, but I hope I  can make some worthwhile
contributions to the digest.  I've been a bit of a silent "shadow" since
you know what they say about opinions.  The specific gravity issue,
however, has caught my fancy and I'd like to put in my two cents worth.  I
am in no means trying to be condecending, so please don't think I'm trying
to be a "know-it-all", I just ask, if you're interested, to consider the
following:


By definition, anything added to the wort will increase its specific
gravity.  The definition of specific gravity being the weight of the
"system" divided by the weight of an equal volume (as the "system") of
water at 4 degrees C.  So, if you have a volume V1 of water, add a rock
with volume Vr, the total volume of the system is V1 + Vr.  Now, the
specific gravity is the weight of the sytem = Wh2o + Wrock divided by the
weight of (V1 + Vr) units of water (at 4 deg. C).  Since the rock most
likely weighs more than an equal volume of water, the specific gravity
increases.  The same idea applies to hop particles in suspension.


Now the question is, do we care?  No, probably not, since a) the hydrometer
is (probably) not accurate enough to detect particles in colloidial
suspension and b) the hops particles will (probably) eventually settle out.
Thus, I propose, that not including the hop particles (or rock or whatever)
in the specific gravity of the wort in the initial reading will balance out
since they will also not be considered in the final reading (i.e. the delta
will be the same).  Of course, the best way to determine is to experiment.
Take your hop suspended wort, measure the SG, then filter it and measure
again (same temp is a good idea).


Happy brewing (and experimenting)!

Subject: Dextrin(tm) malt


I know that in the past, certainly several times, I have posted that
Dextrin(tm) malt (sometimes called CaraPils) was just like other
crystal malts and that it didn't have to me mashed.  Well, this
post is my admission that I was wrong about that...


My experience with Briess Dextrin malt goes back about 7 or 8
years, back when I wasn't as critical of my results and a little
haze was the least of my problems.


Tuesday night, in response to a post by someone about two months
ago (I'm pretty busy, you see...), I steeped the equivalent of
1# of Briess Dextrin malt in a gallon of 170F water and checked
both the SG and clarity.  The SG was 1.015 and the clarity, was,
well... it wasn't.  The "wort" was very turbid.  Thinking that
perhaps it was suspended protein, I boiled it for an hour and force-
chilled to 60F.  Still quite hazy.  Granted, it would be a very
faint haze if it were only 1# in 5 gallons of wort, but still,
I feel that I should set the record straight and admit my mistake.


I've done similarly with DeWolf-Cosyns, Muntons and a couple other
malts labeled "CaraPils" or "CaraPilsner" and all of these
performed like crystal malts... they would not need mashing.
However, the Briess Dextrin malt is clearly a different animal
and really should be mashed with some base malt (like Pale Ale
or Pilsner or even Munich) to both get the expected 24 or so points
per pound per gallon and to saccharify the proteins and starches.


Sorry about that.

Paul of Deposit, NY fame has asked about using Ovaltine in a beer.  All I

The whole mess was bottled before it was done fermenting.  The result was
Ovaltine grenades!  It was very thick, like a milkshake.  I drank the entire
ounce or so and that was plenty.  I would have no idea what to do with 5

Subject: Most Important "variable" in all-grain brewing.


This question is somewhat all encompassing, but info from the experienced
all-grainers would be appreciated.


I made the move to all-grain (6 batches so far) in the fall of this year
after 6 or so extract batches, and must admit, the quality of the beers has
improved significantly.  While I sit here and ponder my brewing goals for
1997 I was wondering about the types of things I should focus on in 97 to
improve my beers even more.  So my question is:


What is the ONE most important variable that I should focus on or try to
control to move to that "next step" in brewing quality?  (i.e. What part of
the process control will give me the biggest "bang' for the buck).


The kinds of things I'm looking for are:  Is it mash temp? Sparge temp?
Sparge time? pH? etc.


I'm not really interested in getting that extra point or so of extraction
(although I expect that will come), but what will make better beer.


A few comments about my all grain setup.  Brew 5 gallon batches, grind in a
PhilMill (TM), I've mashed in both a 10 gallon Gott (TM) (infusion), and my
in a kettle on my burner, transfer my mash to a Phil's Lauter Tun (TM) setup,
sparge for 45-60 minutes indoors to minimize temperature drop, sparge water
170F.  Brew kettle has a SS false bottom (1/4 inch diameter holes on 5/16
inch centers).  Use leaf or plug hops (no pellets) and liquid yeast
exclusively with minimum 1 quart starters,  Primary and secondary ferment in
glass.


So, all-grainers. answer my challenge.  What should it be.  Post either here
in the digest or E-mail me.  I'll summarize any private e-maill comments for
the collective after the first of the year.
