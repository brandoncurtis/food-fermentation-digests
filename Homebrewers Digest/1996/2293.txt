Subject: HOW TO UNSUBSCRIBE YOURSELF FROM THE LIST


Please pay attention.  Recently, the horde of mail filling up the
list-owner's box has been from people attempting to remove themselves and
then getting really upset when the keep getting the digest.


The list-owner is not here to administer your every need.  The software
has features which will do that for you if you simply follow the
appropriate procedures.


To wit:


If you want to unsubscribe yourself from the list, send a message to
<majordomo`at`aob.org> with the text "unsubscribe <listname> <your email
address>" in the body, NOT IN THE SUBJECT.  The subject field is ignored
by the listserver.


Example:  Bob is a subscribed to homebrew, the list (NOT THE DIGEST) and
wants to unsubscribe.  He sends his message to <majordomo`at`aob.org> with
the following in the body:


unsubscribe homebrew bob`at`bobsdomain.com


This takes him off of the list.  If Bob is subscribed to the digest, he
would type:


unsubscribe homebrew-digest bob`at`bobsdomain.com


Now...Bob's mail program doesn't put just "bob`at`bobsdomain.com" in the
header of his messages.  It puts "Robert Subscriber <bob`at`bobsdomain.com>"
instead.  If Bob tries to put only bob`at`bobsdomain.com in his unsubscribe
message,  it will bounce and fail, and bob will get really upset and yell
at the list-owner for running stupid software.  When Bob subscribed to the
list, he received a message from majordomo which told him to do a couple
of things:


a. save this message so you can refer to it later
b. use your complete address, exactly as follows: (and then it quotes
   the address)


So.  Bob needs to type:


unsubscribe homebrew-digest Robert Subscriber <bob`at`bobsdomain.com>


in order to find true happiness.




Now...let's say that Bob unsubscribed several months ago and is REALLY
UPSET THAT THIS #$$&!`at`! DIGEST IS STILL COMING TO HIS BOX!  This is
because after the old listserver broke, the only list we could resurrect
was a backup copy from September.  As such, it was not the most current,
and we apologize.  Bob tries to unsubscribe, but it doesn't work, so he
pulls out all his hair and mailbombs the listserver.


All he has to do is this:


Send a message to <majordomo`at`aob.org> with the text "who homebrew-digest"
in the body of the message (or "who homebrew" if you're on the list only).
This will return a list of ALL SUBSCRIBERS.  Bob has only to look through
this list (and any word processor can help by using Find or Search) to
find whatever address he's still receiving mail from, and send his
"unsubscribe" message with THAT ADDRESS, EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS, USING ALL
OF THE TEXT ON THAT LINE.


If, after exhausting all of these options, Mr. Subscriber still can't
get off of the list, only THEN should he send a message to
admin`at`softsolut.com or root`at`aob.org, or owner-homebrew-digest`at`aob.org
requesting assistance.


The AOB does not pay someone to babysit the listserver all day long.  If
it is used in accordance with its own rules and procedures (just like any
other piece of software - do you yell at MS Word because it can't hear
your voice when you tell it what to type??), it will work just fine.


Periodically, myself or a staff member from the AOB goes through the
mailbox and tries to delete as many of the names as possible from people
who can't seem to unsubscribe themselves, but this is done on our OWN
time, and not on the time of the company.


If any of you would like to pay me my consulting fee, I will gladly
babysit the listserver 10 hours a day and see to it that all of your
options and percs and services are fulfilled to your every desire.  Until
then, please understand that I am doing everything that I am able to do
under the limitations of my contract and my employer, and that anything
else (including this message to try and make your lives easier) is done
solely on my own time because I want your digest to work.


Your patience, tolerance, and understanding is appreciated.

  OFFICE MEMO         SG and no-sparge                      Date:  12/20/96


Concerning particles in suspension affecting SG readings:
I feel that particles which are significantly lighter than wort will quickly
float to the top and those significantly heavier will settle to the bottom so
that particles similar to wort density will stay in suspension for a period of
time.  Hence, the primary density measuring portion of the hydrometer (the
larger "fat" area) hopefully floating somewhere between the top and bottom of
the wort, is not significantly affected by suspended particles.


Concerning no-sparge techniques providing a more "malty" flavor:
One can possibly draw a parallel between this and brewing coffee.  At work I
frequently "rob" the pot by getting a cup of coffee early in the process of
the hot water falling through the grounds and filling the pot below.  This cup
is very strong and well flavored in my opinion.  Now, maybe someone would like
to run a crude test by drawing off a early strong few ounces of coffee and
then collecting a normal cup of coffee after the whole pot is filled.  Then
incrementally dilute the strong cup of coffee with hot water while tasting and
trying and achieve the taste of the normal cup.  I venture to say that the
strong cup will never match the taste of the normal cup but will go from a
stronger taste to a weaker taste without ever duplicating the normal cup
taste.  Confusing?  Hence, early sparge runnings, diluted, may never taste
like a full sparge?

Good morning all,


With all the talk about no-sparge brewing to creat malt charactor, one
thing comes to mind.  If you want a really malty beer back off on the
hops.  You can have either a very malty beer or a very hoppy beer but it
is very difficult to have both in the same beer

rollermills are far, far superior to the Corona.  I prefer the adjustable
MaltMill over the PhilMill primarily because of throughput, less
cranking,
and much less airborne dust.

I am not sure how the available roller mills are far, far superior to the
Corona.  I have conducted screen tests on all of the mills; PhilMil,
MaltMills,Corona; and the Corona when properly adjusted provided the best
crush.  I have heard complains of the husk being broken up with the
Corona and this is true if the mill is not set up properly.  When the
mill is set up properly the  husks for the most part are whole and
provide a good filter bed in the lauter tun.


Al complains about the cranking of the Phil's Mill.  When you use an 1/2"
electric drill cranking is a breeze.


Many of the faults that have been attributed to the Corona mill are not
the mills fault but rather the lack of skill to process the crushed malt.


Al how did you evaluate the mills by here say and lack of good procedure?

Subject: RE: Improving your beers, my .02 (George De Piro) 


     Ho Ho Ho!
     
     Chuck asks how to improve his all grain brews.  My feeling is that the 
     single most important thing a homebrewer can do is to pitch adequate 
     amounts of yeast.  I believe in aeration as well, but this is more 
     debatable.  I don't believe that anybody would disagree with pitching 
     as much yeast as possible.
     
     The one quart starter Chuck uses is better than some, but not nearly 
     optimal.  I get upset if my lag time is more than 2-3 hours.  To 
     achieve this you must pitch a ton of yeast.  Repitching from a 
     previous batch is a great way to do this, and is essential for quality 
     high-gravity beers (and damn useful for lagers, too).
     
     Think about most of the homebrew you taste at contests and club 
     meetings.  What are the most common flaws?  Excessive esters is a 
     common problem, and stuck fermentations are often a complaint here and 
     in other forums.  Both of these problems can be eliminated by pitching 
     a lot of yeast.
     
     Aeration is also key, especially because few of us find it practical 
     to pitch proper amounts of yeast for every single batch we do.  
     Adequate aeration in this case will reduce unwanted esters and prevent 
     the dreaded stuck ferment.
     
     Just my opinion, and Chuck only asked for the ONE most important 
     factor in improving homebrew.
     
     Have a great Holiday Season everybody!  I wish you all health and 
     happy brewing in the New Year!
     
     Have Fun!

The HBD is part of a hobby not a professional or productive endeavor.  We
use the   HBD  to discuss our interests and in part to forget the
drudgery of our normal workday to relieve stress, to have fun and to gain
a bit of information.  When it doesn't work we become just slightly

drinking beer would we worry if we told someone to go to Hell?  Not with
the bunch of folks I drink with.  


The discontent that the AOB generated will take some time to be overcome.
 Until the HBD  makes it to its new home those of you who are providing
services have been lumped with the AOB.  Perhaps you don't deserve
profane remarks directed at you, but I doubt that they were personal. 
The AOB has to learn that we enjoy the hobby and the AOB/AHA seems to be
going out of their way to control the hobby and have their own way.  When
the AOB can't have their own way as a petulant child they pick up their
marbles and run home to mother.  Isn't this what happened with the
B.J.C.P and the HBD? Where is the wonderful new judging program, or
should I say beer evaluation program, that the AHA promised us they would

so many of the things that we have been promised by the AOB/AHA

Forget the "system" stuff...the def. of SG is the ratio of its density
to that of water (_General Chemistry_ by Siebring & Schaff, Wadsworth
Pub. Co., 1980; also any CRC handbook)...most (can't say all, tho its
close) brewers measure specific gravity by floating an instrument
(hydrometer) of a certain mass and volume in the beer/wort. The density
of the liquid will float the hydrometer to a level where:


(mass of hydrometer)/(volume of hydrometer submerged)=SG of solution.


Rocks/trub floating around in there are not dissolved and therefore do
not add to the specific gravity. _However_, if you measure specific
gravity by taking a known volume and weighing it (like Mike describes),
then the trub and other suspended materials add in and throw the SG
reading off.


Also, Al K. writes:

The effect you notice is probably due to temperature differences from
the initital measurement and the settled measurement as the hydrometer,
hydrometer jar and beer/wort all reach temperature equilibrium with the
room.


Try this experiment...pour a cup of table sugar into a quart of cool
water _without_ stirring so as not to dissolve the whole sugar charge.
take a liquid sample and measure the SG.  Now stir thoroughly to
dissolve all the sugar, sample and measure the SG.  It will now be
higher.


Conclusion:  If it isn't dissolved, then it does not contribute to the
SG reading on a hydrometer.

Subject: La Chouffe question


Last month I brewed a lightly spiced Belgian ale using a fairly large
starter of La Chouffe yeast cultured from a bottle. (By large, I'd guess
maybe 300ml of slurry - I built up a 1.75L starter and then continued to
feed it by draining and replacing wort for about three weeks.) Grain bill
was mostly pils with a little Munich and a pound of candi sugar. Spiced with
coriander. It fermented for one week at 70F, and then slowly dropped to 62F
for four weeks (this drop wasn't exactly planned - I went out of town for
three weeks and lowered the thermostat, which dropped the temp in my
basement). I'd like to bottle this weekend. My question: There is a
noticable sulphury note to the odor from the airlock, not as pronounced as
during that first week, but still there. Is this normal for this yeast?
Should I wait until it goes away to bottle? Is my beer ruined (TM)?

Well, the 'cancel' feature couldn't save me here, as it took me two days to
figure this one out. After careful consideration, some experiments with
suspended cornstarch, and a little friendly persuasion from Bill Macher, I
hereby rescind and recant my previous assertion, and extend my apologies to
John Palmer. A hydrometer does not measure the density of the suspending
liquid, but rather the density of whatever it displaces, including
particles in suspension. The significance of this in practical brewing
terms will be left as an exercise to the reader. We now return you to the
digest in progress.

     Hi all, and Ho Ho Ho again!
     
     Al K. writes that he dry hops in the primary.  I want to ask two 
     things about this:  
     
     1.  Do you worry about infection?  As has been recently pointed out, 
     there are various wort loving microflora on the hops.  They don't 
     survive well in beer, but in unfermented wort, they could be quite 
     happy.
     
     2.  Do you find that the aroma survives the fermentation?  The massive 
     CO2 formation during the primary would scrub out most other volatiles. 
     I guess that you are happy with the results you're getting, but I

        Al is correct, there are dyes involved, but they can be done in by
steeping in boiling water, wrung out, and re-steeping in another batch of
boiling water. You will see the extracted dyes in the water, and the nylon
changes to a sort of pink color. They work great and when the beer is moved
to serving, I just throw the whole thing into the dumpster and have no
hassles with cleaning and reusing a more traditional hop bag. They are also
very inexpensive. I have a call into the tech side of Kayser Roth on this
subject and will post any info I receive from them.

Subject: Brown Sugar Priming


Just a quick question...


Say someone wanted to try priming with light brown sugar instead of
his normal corn sugar (for a 5 US gal batch), what would be a good
amount to add for 'normal' carbonation?


The thought is to get just a taste of that molasses/brown sugar
flavor in an IPA.  I realize brown sugar isn't as fermentable as corn
sugar, so I want to find that happy balance between insufficient
bubbles and drying off the ceiling.


Anyone on this digest ever use BS for priming?

To add my $.02 to the density vs. particulate discussion, I would agree that
theoretically, a stone in a pond adds to the SG of the pond, and suspended
hops, yeast and trub add to the SG of the contents of the hydrometer vessel.
However, none of these particles are a part of the solution:  If you weighed
the empty vessel, then reweighed it with the hops, trub, etc. and divided the
weight by the volume, you would have the SG of the contents of the vessel.
Hydrometers only measure the SG of the solution.  Hops and trub being
insoluble in the beer (or at least beyond its' saturation point) cannot
contribute to the SG as measured with a hydrometer.
 
That being said, has anybody tried isolating and/or culturing yeast from a
bottle of Widmer Bros Hefeweizen?  Cool web page, too (www.widmer.com).
They claim secrecy about their "special" yeast.  Anybody know what they use?

Subject: Sparge/Nosparge


I am thinking of trying a nosparge experiment over the holidays if I get time.
My problem is making two different beers varying only the sparging.
I don't seem to have much luck doing things again.  I don't even seem
to do something similar.  What I plan on doing to try to have a legitimate
comparison is to mash and then drain all the liquid to a bucket.
Then I will fill the mash tun with hot water, stir, recirculate until
clear again, and sparge. I will then take a portion of the unsparged runnings
and mix it with the sparged and add water to the unsparged to come up with
equal volumes of the same SG. I think the mixed wort (sparged and unsparged)
batch should be equivalent to a regularly sparged batch.


I have calculated the following:


If:
   Vu  = volume of unsparged runnings
   SGu = SG-1 of unsparged runnings
   Pu  = total points of unsparged runnings (Vu*SGu)
   Vs  = volume of sparged runnings
   SGs = SG-1 of sparged runnings
   Ps  = total points of usparged runnings (Vs*SGs)
   F   = Fraction of Vu to mix with Vs
   Vw  = volume of water to add to Vu
   Vm  = volume of mixed sparged runnings and fraction of unsparged
   Vd  = volume of remaining unsparged runnings diluted by Vw


then:
   Pu - F*Pu = F*Pu + Ps
and
   F = .5 - Ps/(2*Pu)
   Vm = Vs + F*Vu
   Vd = Vu*(1-F) + Vw
   Vw = 2*F*Vu + Vs - Vu


Vd should equal Vm.


Both batches should be of equal volume with the same OG.  Ideally, these
would be cooked exactly the same (as near as possible) with the same amounts
of carefully measured hops.  The hard part might be coming up with equal
amounts of the same yeast for each and aerating the same.  I am going to
try to get everything as close to the same as I can.  After they are through
and aged a blind testing would be in order.  Probably several testings on
different days would be best (that is the fun part).  This experiment has
all of a sudden gone from being tedious to exciting!


If anyone sees any flaws in my theory, please let me know.

No. Its easy to calculate, but today, I'm to lazy to do so. Also, thick or
thin walls won't change anything. Aluminum will expand considerably more than
stainless, but still insignificant in terms of volume.

Subject: sparge water T


collective homebrew conscience:


can elevated sparge water temperatures cause starch to be dissolved into
the wort?  i have a clarity problem that i've not had before this year, and
one of the changes i made was monitoring the grain bed temp instead of the
sparge tank temp, which lately has been up around 180 F.  the grain bed T
usually does not exceed 160 F during the sparge.  but i can't explain this
haziness in the fermenters i've seen lately and am wondering if i should
get the sparge water T back down 10 degrees or so.  i've noticed in a couple
of beers that have fermented out this fall that in the secondaries there is
evidence of a lot of non-yeast sediment.  usually my secondaries don't have
much other than yeast at the bottom, but i'm seeing more stuff down there
this year.  i'm wondering if the elevated sparge temps are extracting something
into the sweet wort that is causing the haze and excess sediment.

You can also pressurize through that hole with your CO2 if you are so
equipped! Just keep the pressure WAY down low! I use a piece of ss
tubing with a hole drilled in the side that I put my thumb over when I
am pushing the beer and let go to stop the process.

I have been following both threads for some time and was
wondering if I could combined both techniques, more malt flavor
and great hop flavor and aroma, I'm all over that!


To combined both methods I plan to do the following:
Take .50 oz EKG pellets, it's what I have, and add them to
a jar with some warm water to help them swell and break up.
Then using 33% more pale ale malt than normal, mix my
hop paste into the mash and hold the temp at 155 until
conversion is complete. Then sparge, oh I mean drain
the mash tun into my kettle.  Boil as usual.


My thinking is that the having the hops in the mash would
keep them at around the same temperature as the FWH
technique.  It might even keep them there longer and I
won't have to remove them when I add my bittering hops.
I think I remember some posts saying that they remove the
FWH hops after sparging onto them.


I'm I completely mad, will the hops cause me other problems
in the mash?  Is there any reason not to give this a try?


One last thing...
Thanks to everyone who contributes to this digest,
I have learned so much here, it has been an indispensable

Subject: no sparge/small beers


collective homebrew conscience:


recently the no sparge discussion has raised a question in my mind.  the idea
that there exists something in the spargings that "counteracts" the maltiness
in the recirculated first wort makes me wonder about small beers made from
second runnings.  since they don't have the benefit of having the superior
"maltiness" of the first recirculated wort, and all the bad things that 
"counteract" malty flavors, these beers must be very devoid of malt flavor.


i  have never made a small beer from the second runnings of a barley wine or
other high gravity style.  has anybody out there made one?  if so, was it
clearly inferior in terms of malt flavor?

Dave: I have used the Yeast Labs Dusseldorf yeast once, and I didn't
experience any problems with it clearing. I hasten to add, however, that
this probably has less to do with the yeast itself (or my brewing
techniques, for that matter) than sheer laziness on my part. You see, I let
the beer sit in the secondary for well over a month before I had a chance
to bottle it. In fact, the beer looked so clear at bottling time that I
purposely siphoned a bit of the slurry into my bottling bucket, just to
make sure the batch would carbonate properly in the bottle. So the good
news is that the yeast will fall out at room temperature, but the bad news
is that it may take a while. If you haven't got the time (or the lack of
motivation to bottle) that I had, you may want to hustle it along with
isinglass or the fining of your choice, but refrigeration is probably not
necessary.
Hope this helps,
Mitch.

Subject: small infections in beer


Those of us that have taken shortcuts in sanitizing as sucking to start
siphons, rinsing with tap water, pouring bucket to bucket to aerate,
adding tap water to top off beer, fishing out dropped implements from
cooled wort with our fingers, etc., may claim to not have infected beer
in that we had to dump it, ropey strings of things grew in our beer, or
gushers.


        Infected beer may be only a small infection that gives a faint phenol
or bandaide or electrical insulation smell, detectable only when
concentrating as in beer judging.  It may appear only after a long
storage period.


        The issue isn't whether shortcut techniques cause infections, they do;
rather, it is whether your beer is too infected for your purposes.


        Yes, I suck, fish, pour and committ other sins.  I don't recommend them
to other brewers. I've been lucky to have only very small infections so
far.


        By the way, I've purchased some 160 proof vodka which I suck thru
hoses, and dip hose ends into to sterilize.  I also wet down carbouy
stoppers before lifting these out.  Works great but burns like hell in
the mouth.

Greetings likeminded (somewhat, anyway) conferees,


In number 11, J. Varady submitted a jingle that is
worth repeating.  I sang it to my wife (ala Julie Andrews) and
she, not a drinker of any kind, loved it.
For those of you who missed it.

     D'OH!!!
"


I've been waiting for my que,
and it's counter pressure bottle filling, really, just bottle filling.  I am
perplexed
by this problem now addressed by Mr Gladden and most recently by Orville 
Deutchman.  I do not often prime and bottle, being much more interested
in force carbonation and the clearer, more distributable beer it produces.
Believe
it or not, I actually will sometimes drink this stuff out of the bottle and when
bottom goes up yeast is all over and the cloudy mess is no longer fun for myself
and others to drink.  So on and so forth.


I never liked the idea of counter pressure bottle filling as it was always too
expensive
and if not expensive, then cumbersome.  So I was once talking with a friend who
had
toured a brewery in Texas and he said they cooled the beer way down and then
just poured into the bottles.  It was his impression that counter-pressure was
not involved.  
He was talking my game.  


So, armed with a long thin tube inserted tightly into a tap, I just poured neer
freezing beer 
into refrigerated bottles.  The results were varied,  but when it worked, it was
as simple as 
it sounds - 10 or 15 seconds per bottle and then on to the next.  I would
sometimes do 
5 gallons at a time, before capping the bottles.  When things were going well, 
the already-filled bottles would just sit there and NOT FOAM, patiently waiting
to be capped.  When things went well, the beer was wonderfully carbonated, clear
and
had very little sediment so that bottoms up was not a problem.


When things went well...  If the carbonation isn't just right, the beer cold
enough, the bottles
cool and happy and Bacchus smiling, it is as good as it sounds.  That's about
60% of the
time.  The rest of the time I'm foaming at the bottle.


So, do you know?  A) How DO the pros do it?  B) Is there an easy way to up my
60% hit
rate?  As elaborate as have been some of my efforts at brewing, I'm still
somewhat of
a minimalist and I really do bawk at counter-pressure techniques.  Comments?
