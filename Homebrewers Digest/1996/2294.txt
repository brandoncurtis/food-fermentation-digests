G'day,


I just recieved my first issue of the digest list, and most of you all
seem to be pretty knowledgeable.  Allow me to explain my situation: My
first attempt at a homebrew is currently sitting in a glass carbuoy, 23
days out of conception.  It appears to be, at this point, free from
infection, and the bubbling has slowed to a snail's pace.


I began with ten pounds of honey from a local Apiary and added the
obligatory yeast energizer, acids, salts, and champagne yeast, along
with some cloves, allspice, and ground mace.  The mixture was allowed to
rest for 13 days, then transferred to a second carbuoy and allowed to
rest for ten more.  (If anyone has a comment at this point, please do
not hesitate to add).


It's getting down the wire here and it's almost time for bottling.  My
question is about specific gravity.  I don't envision the final reading
to be equivilent to exactly 1.08 or whatever the recommendation is.  I
heard that you can take a reading three days in a row, and if you come
up with the same reading, it's okay to sugar and bottle.  Is this
entirely accurate?  I don't want any of those damned grenades. :)


If you could also offer some general advice, I'd appreciate a mail or
two.  In my experience, nothing ever goes according to books, and
there's no substitute for anecdotal evidence.


Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

Try 2/3 cup if doing bottles, and 1/3 cup if you're kegging. I recently did
a ESB in bottles. The carbonation is perfect!

Subject: First Partial Mash


Greetings Fellow Brewers,
  I am yet another first time poster to HBD.  With so much great advice
flying around
(I have learned alot just reading HBD), i figured I toss in a question
of my own, actually more a plea for friendly advice.
 I like most brewers started out with extracts, then added specialty
grains to
improve my brew and was very pleased with the results.  Now I'd like to
take the 
next step and do a partial mash.
  here are my questions:
 
 a) What would be a relatively easy partial mash recipe to start off my
    journey into all grain? ( I really like Porters and Stouts)


 b) What would be a good lauter tun for small mashes like this? Would a
simple
    strainer of some sort be ok?


 c) Will partial mashing improve head retention on my beers, while the
ones in the
    past have tasted great, the head retention has been lacking (my
glasses are clean
    I don't have any problems with an commercial brews I buy)?


   Thanks in advance,
     Scott

Rick,


Couldn't be simpler. It's name is its explanation.  


Thus, as a numerical example, if 10 pounds of malt were to give an SG of 1.060
in 5 gallons of wort.  or 2# of malt per gallon of wort gives an OG of 1.060 (
i.e. 60 points).  This is 60/2 or 30 points per pound per gallon - a good
number. 100% efficiciency for pale malt should be about 36 p/p/g.  So in our
case above we have 30/36 = 83% efficiency based on the theoretical maximum
expected extract. 


People sometimes appear to use this p/p/g number as a measure of efficiency,
which it is not.  It can be used to calculate the efficiency of extraction once
the theoretically expected extract has been calculated.  To give you an extreme
example of why it is not a measure of efficiency, suppose you had made up a mash
of 100% Belgian Chocolate malt  ( Just the name would send my wife crying for
some)  and got a p/p/g of 30 you might be tempted to say this was an OK
efficiency when it is actually exrtaordinary at 100% of theoretical for this
malt.  Bigger differences can be had with high roasts and adjuncts.  So use
p/p/g carefully in your conversation., please.


To give you an idea of the theoretical p/p/g for a complex grain bill see
Charlie Pap's "Home Brewer's Companion" for a series of tables of expected
extract from malts and various adjuncts.  This willl let you calculate the
expected extract from any possible mixture of malts and extracts. Using this
number and your p/p/g obtained you can calculate your efficiency.

It is called balance and it certainly is achievable.  A beer that can be
transferred to different parts of the mouth and seems both malty and and
bitter depending on where it rests.  I love to achieve this in a brown
ale by using a high proportions of munich, vienna, and D.W.C. aromatic
malts without having to increase the starting gravity past 1.055.

As with anything if you have the spare time to sit there and mess with
it, yes you can get a good mill.  It is a pain in the ass though and
you  have to readjust alot.  I got rid of mine and moved to a
phillmill.  If this comparison takes price into comparison, then you
have to make do with what you can afford.
        After dealing with the philmill I moved to a maltmill, which is what I
currently use.  Yes you can motorize a philmill and listen to it wheeze
while it throws dust all over your brew room if you want to.  Hook that
same drill up to the maltmill and you will be mashed in before somone
using the philmill is ever done milling.  It is 3-4 times as fast, no
exageration.  The corona and phillmill are ok for extract and 5 gallon
all grainers but when moving to 10 gallons at a time the maltmill is the
only way to go.  I would like to mention however that the customer
service and general friendliness provided by Jack Schmidling Inc. is
deplorable.

Please Bill,  I think Al has probably had more exposure to mills than

 Hi All
  
  I have been lurking in the background for about one year and have learned
a lot
 from the group. I teach Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Polytechnic
University ( AKA Brooklyn Poly) and have have been an extract brewer for
about three
years. After spending the last summer as an apprentice at a local brew-pub I
have just
switched to all-grain. The reason for my 'surfacing' into the group is that
I have noticed some misinformation at times relative to fluid and heat flow
questions. 


 With regard to the pot expansion question both responses have errors in
them. John Palmer approximated the cylindrical pot as a cube and assumed
expansion in all directions.
 In addition he used the actual pot temperature of 150 deg F rather than the
change in temperature (150 - room temp). Kelly also calculated the expansion
incorrectly. 


 When a pot is heated it is free to expand only in the vertical direction.
The material
in the circumferential direction is not free and does not expand any
appreciable amount.
To see this, consider a bar wedged between two immovable ends. What happens
is that
as you increase the temperature, the material tries to expand but can't.
This creates
a thermally induced force in the bar. The magnitude of the force created in
the bar is simply equal to the force it takes to compress the bar from the
length it would have attained if heated without constraints back to the
original length before the heat was applied.
  
 Assuming a height of 16 inches, a 50 liter pot would have a diameter 15.6
inches. Thus the
assuming a mash temp. of 155 and a room temp. of 60 the change in temp is 95
deg F and
the change in height (using John Palmer's value for the expansion coeff.
which seems reasonable) is given by 16 x 9.6x10^(-6) x 95 = .0146 inches
increase in height at the top. If we now multply 
this by the pot area we get a change of volume of 2.78 cu. in which is
equivalent to 1.5 fluid oz.
This is obviously not significant. Also remember that this is only if the
pot is full to the top. If
half full this value is one half or about one oz. in 25 liters!!!


 I also have some comments regarding the thread on immersion heaters and
line pressure drop.
If anyone is interested drop me an e-mail at jbentson`at`htp.net or
jbentson`at`rabbit.poly.edu.


 By the way, since i have done a fair amount of work on pebble bed heat
exchange I recently
got interested in developing a computer model of a grain bed during
sparging. This will take some
effort and I will keep you posted


 Since this is my first post please excuse if I inadvertantly make a mistake
and send extraneous 
material.


 Regards


 Jim Bentson

Subject: How to make Megaswill


With the recent threads on both FWH and NSB, I have tried them both and
will continue to compare them with other brews. 
        But, on to the point, if you sparge your mash after you do a NSB, the
grist still has a small amount of fermentables in it, but very little
flavor, (IMO from tasting it) and you take the hops you used for the
FWH. You boil for about 10 minutes, ferment, add an excessive amount of
priming sugar. Would you end up with Megaswill?
        It would be dirt cheap, (free) beer you could let the non-friends you
have that don't like good beer drink! Just haven't figured out how to
get the corn and rice in it.

I have done FWH and seem to get an added hop flavor and aroma. I try to
make a comparable beer to the good ones using extracts, and was
wondering if you could steep your aroma hops with the specialty grains
and get a similar effect to FWH. Has anyone tried?
        I plan on brewing an extract version of an all grain ESB and will try
steeping and will let everyone know the results.

Subject: Shelf life of beer


I was wondering what the shelf life of beer is. I realize that much is 
dependent on the quality of the yeast and the gravity of the beer.


I had a pleasant surprise at a party last night. I friend of mine pulled 
out a bottle which I had given him last Christmas. I seem to recall that 
it was a pale ale with a SG of about 1.042. The beer was lovely and 
clear, had a nice hope noise and malty taste, though a bit dry on the 
palette. 
Any thoughts..


Cheers....

To whom it may concern:
   I am new to this media.  I can receive mail, news (occasionally), but 
am uncertain that any thing I write comes out.  As I understand it, 
there is a discussion of "spargeless mashing".  As I can understand your 
description, it is what I have been going for about 12-13 years.  I've 
thought a lot about it and am willing to share my experience on the 
matter, but would like to see that this missive ends up in the right 
place before expending the energy.  Should this actually end up in the 
HBD, please let me know and I'll be happy to share the historical 
background, theoretical rational, and the method I've been using to 
avoid sparging (which is a bloody bore!).
  As I mentioned I am quite new to this manner of communicating, but 
quite "old" to brewing.  Please send up a flare if I've ended up in the 
right place, and tell me how to formally get connected (I bumped into 
this on RCB).
With thanks in advance,

nice to see the HBD back.


i have a keg full of beer which tastes strongly of wet bandaids (phenols).
i think i know why, but does anyone know anything i can do about it? Since
the beer is lightly hopped, i have considered hop extracts and/or dry
hopping to cover the taste. since it's in a keg, if there is anything that
will neutralize the phenols i can add it.

i bought some Christoffel Robertus, mainly becuase it was in a cool 1/2
gallon growler with an aluminum handle. the style claims to be
"dubbelgemout bier". the card on the bottle neck explains it comes from
holland (st. christopher brewery), and the brewer calls it a "dubble malt
beer" brewed in the "munich tradition". the freshness date claims sept97
(go figgure). it is dark amber, with no esters present.  it is very malty
and dry, and maybe a little sour. Does anyone know how to brew something
like it, or what flavor components are in it that i haven't identified?

Subject: No sparge, s.g. readings with solids


1.  No sparge data


Over the weekend I did a no-sparge mash with 12 lb of grain.  This was
for a 3-3.5 gallon batch:
- - 9 lb pale malt
- - 1 lb Munich
- - 1/2 lb wheat
- - 1/2 lb carapils
- - 1 lb crystal


Crush - two roller mill at homebrew store.  


Using 1.33 qt/lb grain = 16 qts of mash water.   Single temp infusion,
in a 10 gallon Gott cooler, no mash out.  Mashed at 154F for 100
minutes, temp. at end was 150F (it was cold in Houston).  I recirculated
the first gallon, then let it drain with the valve wide open.  It took
longer than normal, about 20-30 minutes.


I collected 2.5 gallons of 1.075 wort, then diluted to 1.048 at just
under 4 gallons and proceeded as normal. 


This message is a datapoint only for those who use Gott coolers with
single temp mashes.  I don't have accurate scales or volumetric flasks,
so don't get too anal analyzing the results.   I left 6 quarts of liquid
in the mash tun, or about 0.5 qt. per lb of grain.    YMMV.


2.  Measuring gravity with stuff in the liquid


Same batch as above.  Measured 1.060 final gravity in the trub and hop
pellet saturated liquid from the bottom of the pot.  Drained this
through a coffee filter and measured 1.055.  Temperature of liquid in
both cases was the same.

Well Guys,


I finally tried to make a rye beer as suggested in HBD.  I've notice that it 
hasn't cleared after two weeks in the secondary.  Any suggestions??


6# 2-row
4# rye-malted?
1056 yeast
2 oz perle (1/3 PWH) 4.2%




I added 2.5 gallons of water `at` 170 F. The cooler was quite cold and the 
temperature equalized at 130 F.  I added about 1 gallon of boiling water and the 
temp moved to 140F.  I pulled a thick decoctation of bring to 160 then boil for 
15 minutes and back in the mash.  Stired in and didn't check the temp until an 
hour later(153 F).  Recirulated until it cleared mostly, then obtained 6 
gallons.  Boiled, chilled, areated, added yeast and had fermentation in about 4 
hours.  Primary fermentation appeared to end in three days, transfered to 
secondary at one week.  Added geletine at transfer.


Got any suggestions??  Maybe I didn't get full conversion and have a starch 
haze??  Is rye beer normally hazy like wheat beirs??

Subject: Efficiency Question


Greetings.
Some of you may remember me as the guy who can't get better than 25 p/p/g. 
Here's a question.  This weekend, I brewed twice.  Once with HB English Pale
Malt and once with Schrier 2 Row.  Plus some specialty grains, but I don't
think that matters.  Both with about 10 lbs pale malt.  Identical procedures: 
25 min protein rest at 122F
90 min rest at 152F
10 min mashout at 168F
Maltmill to crush, EZmasher to mash/sparge.  Collected 8 gallons for each. 
About 90 minutes to sparge.  Calculated yield approx 25 p/p/g.  Now here's the
question.  After collecting the 8 gallons, I took a SG reading on the
runnings.  They were still, in both cases, at 1.020!  I always thought you
should stop sparging when SG hit 1.010.  So clearly, I am leaving sugar
behind.  WHY?  Too slow a sparge? Too coarse a crush?


 Oh yeah, I also, during the second session, stopped sparging in the middle,
mixed the mash like crazy just in case any channeling was occuring, then
recirulated until clear again and resumed. My sparge water has a pH of 7.8,
but I have in the past tried acidifying it with lactic acid and it has made no
difference.  


What would lead to runnings, after 8 gallons, to still be at 1.020?


TIA

Yes, I tried Al's dry hopping in the primary for an ale and was quite happy
with my first dry hop attempt.  I waited until the bubbling had slowed--after
a few days, dry hopped with 1oz. of Cascade, then bottled before two weeks
total time in the primary to avoid autolysis problems.  Next time I'll do the
same but I might try 2oz of Cascade.  Certainly if you dry hop in the primary,
you want to wait until fermentation slows to avoid bubbling away your hop
aroma.

I've got another question for the chemists, although any

lab work would probably know.


Okay...


Percent by weight (% w/w) is easy:   grams/100 grams or pounds/100 pounds
(okay, pounds are technically a force, not a weight, but on earth...)


Percent by volume (% v/v) is also easy:  ml/100ml or gal/100 gal, etc.


Now, what's with % w/v?  What the heck is this?  Is this some sort of
agreed-upon convention (like w is always in grams and v always in liters)
or is it just a mistake?  How can something be a percent weight of a
volume?


Is this really a measurement convention or are a lot of people using
the wrong symbols when they mean w/w and v/v?


Thanks.

Subject: Small beers


     Mark Bayer inquires about small, second-runnings beers, which in the 
     brewer's parlance are often referred to as "gyle" beers.
     
     I have been making these types of beers ever since I started making 
     really big beers -- just seemed like the proper thing to do. And 
     within the context of the no-sparge discussion, the results of these 
     efforts are somewhat surprising: I have made some quite memorable gyle 
     beers, noticeable for their *malt* character, and have often thought 
     about how unique they are.  That is, the methods of making them are 
     unique and quite different from normal mashing routines, and that you 
     probably cant recreate their character in any simpler manner.  That 
     is, the malt flavors are a distinct function of the mash regime.  Now 
     I warn the reader that the following only relates to my experience, 
     and in no way confers any particular understanding of the mechanisms 
     by which things come about.
     
     When making barleywines and imperial stouts, my grain bill usually is 
     on the order of 75-85 pounds.  I used to use two 60 qt coolers for 
     this, but have since built a larger single tun (obtained a used 120 
     gallon oak barrel, cut in half, natch).  This is a lot of product for 
     a target of 12 or so gallons of cast out strong wort.  The gyle beers 
     that result from this kind of bill have often been in the 1060-1065 
     range.  Consequently they are only  "small" in a relative sense.  On 
     one occasion, the gyle beer from a russian stout turned out to be 
     quite amazing -- easily the best beer I thought I had made all year.  
     What made it stand out was a beautiful malt flavor that complimented 
     the acidic sharpness of the roast.  I have had similar sorts of 
     impressions of amber gyle beers from barleywine grists: a noticeable 
     maltiness that seems to be what those advocating no-sparge techniques 
     are describing.  
     
     Now it could be that my techniques of using lots of malt really doesnt 
     result in a traditional thin second beer, where most of the 
     carbohydrate went into the big beer, and you are getting the very last 
     of the sugars out of the grain, hence possibly some kinds of compounds 
     that tend to counteract maltiness derrived from early runnings.  In 
     any event, I have had very good results with the gyle beers I have 
     made using my techniques, and in no instances that I can recall did 
     these beers ever seem to be lacking in malt character.  Another nice 
     thing about these beers is that while you are waiting the six months 
     for the monsters to approach drinkable, you can enjoy one of these and 
     remember how fun it was looking at that tun full to the gills!
     
     Just one person's experiences.  Use or loose at your discretion.

Kent,


The volume errors from expansion of the pot are an order of magnitude smaller
than more common sources of error. Don't forget wort also expands with an
increase in temperature which will reduce the error from the pot expansion when
using this dipstick method.


Why don't you weigh the pot full (Pf) and empty (Pe) on your bathroom scale.
You know the density of the solution from your SG measurement. (Pf-Pe) /(8.6X
SG) = V   Voila! the volume in gallons (8.6 lbs/gal).  Although there are
extensive tables, I generally correct for temperature changes over small delta
T's by using 0.00023/deg F. You could try a nice clean plastic rod or several
coats of sealer on your stick.

Well, I guess you missed the whole point of the discussion. Of all the steps in
brewing beer, aeration of the wort whilst it is hot is just about the worst
thing you can do.  When I discovered this myself a few decades ago I felt like
Aristotle and screamed "Eureka!"  The difference in beer produced by cold and
hot aeration is remarkable.  Next time, try immersing your covered boiler with
your hot wort in a cold bath or immerse a cooler made of copper tubing through
which you pass cooling water to get it down to about 70F or so.  At this
temperature, oxidation of melandoins and other compounds to form staling
aldehydes are substantially reduced and the yeast will benefit from the
additional incorporated oxygen during startup.


Try it.  I garontee you will like the result.




Keep on brewin'
