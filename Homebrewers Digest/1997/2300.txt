Well, I don't know what a stopcock is (sounds mildly sexual...), but I was
planning on using a 1/2" spigot/tubing assembly to quickly transfer the
wort from the bucket to the kettle, avoiding HSA. :-)  I'm glad to hear any
accumulated DMS will evaporate, although now I'm a little concerned with
enzyme activity while the wort sits around. <grin>  Oh, and I use a CF
chiller so DMS isn't a problem once the boil is complete....

Thanks! So, what I'm looking for is a PH meter w/ temp. compensation to
70C+, which gives a temp. reading fast (5 secs?), and displays the temp. in
C/F. Should I be looking for anything else which may be useful?

Bleach will oxydize most metals, including Stainless-Steel and Copper which
are used very often in all-grain systems. If you want to sanitize metals,
the prefered sanitizer is usually Iodophor. It isn't dangerous, doesn't
cost much (although bleach is cheaper), and is easy to use. Typically, the
dilution is 1 tsp. for 5 gals of cold water. This will sanitize in about 30
mins, although you can use higher concentrations to sanitize in 30 secs.
I've used this higher concentration in a spray bottle (Windex type) to
clean my work area and odds-n'-ends I sometimes forget to soak. :-)


If you're only using plastic, bleach is probably just as good, although you
have to be careful not to splash it around! <grin>  Iodophor won't damage
clothing like bleach, but it does have a tendancy to stain plastics when
used at higher concentrations. You should always add Iodophor after your
bucket is filled with water. If you do it the other way around, the bottom
of your bucket will be stained yellow. :-)


I use one or the other, depending on what I'm sanitizing...


later!

I have a Newport combination digital pH meter and thermometer (sorry, don't
have the model number handy).  It's a nice pH meter, because it temperature
compenstates to 70C (158F, perfect for mashing), where many only go to 50C.

Subject: Propane gas regulators


I fired up a new brew system for the first time yesterday.  The burners
are 160K BTU Brinkman ring burners, burning propane.  I used a
regulator/hose assembly that came with a propane space heater.


The problem is, I got nowhere near 160K BTU from these things, even with
the control valve wide open.  In fact, I could barely maintain a boil in
a 10 gal batch (something I was able to do easily with a 30K BTU natural
gas burner).


I'm wondering if the pressure regulator is not the right one.  Are there
different pressures at which LPG is used, or are all LPG regulators set
to the same value?


Has anyone else had similar problems with the Brinkman burners?


Thanks for any help,

Subject: Clearing problem


Before Christmas I brewed 2 x 5 gal. batches of pale ale on consecutive 
weekends to be ready for 15 Dec. and 22nd Dec.  Both recipes were identical 
(4kg Maris Otter, Challenger/EKG, yeast salvaged from bottled Hopback 
Summer Lightning) with the exception that the second batch had 1% chocolate 
malt added.  Both batches were fermented at 18-22C for 1 week before being 
transferred to a secondary and fermented for a further 1 week.  Both 
batches were then transferred to kegs, had isinglass finings (Richie 
Products) added to the makers recommended dosage, dry hopped with a 
generous handful of EKG and conditioned at 10-15C for 4 weeks before 
sampling.


The first batch was nothing like clear by the 15th Dec. but the second 
batch (supposed to be ready a week later) was already pretty clear.  Both 
batches tasted good but the unclear one tasted pretty yeasty.  By the time 
the second batch was supposed to be ready it tasted great (no yeastyness) 
and was nice and clear.  However, the first batch had still not cleared and 
did not clear even when left a further 2 weeks.  Eventually, I filtered it. 
 Now both batches were perfectly clear and both tasted great.


There is only one other difference between the 2 batches.  The one which 
cleared was kegged in a spherical Beer Sphere (don't know the maker) whilst 
the one which remained cloudy was in a typical UK home brew keg which is 
like a vertically oriented traditional barrel (or pin, I suppose).  There 
is a big difference between the height of the beer from top to bottom of 
these two containers.  Could this account for should a phenomenon?  Can 
anyone help?  Any other tips on getting beer bright?  How long do 
commercial breweries condition and fine real/cask conditioned ales?

Subject: CO2 bottles, Carbonoation and Corny kegs


Here in the UK I don't think there are too many brewers who use Corny kegs 
(The Homebrew Shop in Farnborough, Surrey* got me mine - no affil....., 
blah, blah, blah...).  We also have a major problem getting hold of 
reasonable size CO2 bottles.  The home brew shops all sell small Soda 
Stream size (1'x2") bottles but it appears impossible to get hold of larger 
bottles (e.g. 15 lb +).  One of the countries largest gas suppliers told me 
that it was illegal for a private individual to own a larger CO2 bottle on 
grounds of safety etc.  If this is true, it's absurd!  In my brewery I also 
have the remains of my SCUBA equipment which includes a 60 cu.ft air 
bottle.  I understand that the bottles would have to be pressure checked 
from time to time and that if they fail you don't get them back - fine! 
 Can anybody in the UK tell me how I can legally get hold of a reasonable 
size CO2 bottle which I can also readily get tested and filled?


Next.  Given that my Corny key is fitted directly with a pressure gauge 
which goes up to a max. of 30psi and that my gas bottle screws directly 
onto a value fitted through the oval lid to the keg, how can I adequately 
carbonate my lager (which is filtered, by the way) and how long will the 
process take?  My keg is kept in the fridge `at` 3-10C and I've tried the 
shaking trick and also inverting the keg before injecting the gas (which 
worries me in case beer gets pushed into the pressure gauge).  Both methods 
do add some carbonation but only really when the keg is half empty.  I'm 
looking to carbonate the beer fairly generously even when the keg is full. 
 Any good techniques?

A question for yeast ranchers - 


I am currently in Europe, and have been drinking 9% Chimays and other 
fine brews of note, and had an idea - GET THE YEAST!  I am having the 
same idea with several of the draught wiesens that are available here.


I am rather inexperienced in such things, but I have access to a 
culture disk, agar, and a cotton swab.  The Chimay is marked as being 
made in '95 and good 'til 2001.  The questions:


1. Can I do this with what I have?
2. Is the Chimay too old?
3. Is the wiesen yeast that provides the banana/clove profile still 
viable when on draught?


Thanks all!

I finally had the bright idea to use this method on my last batch with
my EM setup, also using an immersion chiller and whole hops.  Two
questions about this:


(1) Do you whirlpool the wort?  The only benefit I could see to doing
    this would be to increase the depth of the "trub-bed" over the EM
    screen.


(2) This probably sounds crazy, but do you recirculate at all?  It
    seems that you would be increasing your chances of infection for
    little gain, but I just had to finish the mashing analogy.


Cheers!

Subject: Splitting CO2 Lines


Hi All,


Someone was recently talking about splitting their CO 2 lines:


>I'm going to have a two tap tower (say that 3 times
>fast) on a chest freezer so I obviously need something to split the 
>CO2 output to the two kegs.  I also plan on bottling sometimes using

Here's what I do, I have a T that splits off just out of the regulator 
with a quick disconnect (QD) fitting attached.  This is the female air 
system QD, I picked this up along with several fittings at a discount 
store for under three dollars.  I have a rig that I made up with an 
air chuck on one end and a male QD on the other.  This rig is used for 
pressurizing PET bottles and for use with my homemade counter pressure 
bottle filler.  


For the PET bottles, I drilled several of the plastic caps and 
inserted stainless steel tire stems (replaced the rubber seals with 
o-rings) into the caps and I now pressurize without the help of The 
Carbonator.  I had a carbonator that spit it's guts into my beer. :^(
This one is cheaper to boot. (Thanks Jeff!)


For the counter pressure bottle filler I took an 18 inch racking cane, 
#2 drilled rubber stopper, an air needle (the type used to fill 
footballs) and a plastic tire stem extension.  Place the rubber 
stopper on the end of the racking cane, drill a hole the size of the 
needle from the bottom of the stopper, insert the needle and attach 
the plastic tire stem extension.  You now have an inexpensive and 
easily held and handled counter pressure bottle filler.  It works 
great! I found this idea at The Brewery, sorry, I don't remember who 
the author was.


In line after the first T is a hard plastic valve that allows me to 
isolate my kegs while I increase the pressure for the PET bottles.  I 
can also use the valve on the regulator to isolate the kegs and bleed 
them off using the air chuck.  My air line then goes into the fridge 
(not frig ;^) that's an activity) where it T's off to two kegs. 


If anyone has any questions feel free to send e-mail.

You're right, it's not normal, but I would venture that it's not 
impossible, either. Have you checked the specific gravity? How does it 
compare to the starting gravity? If it is at an acceptably low level, let 
it sit for a few days and measure again. If you see no change, assume it's 
done and bottle as normal (or transfer to secondary if this is your norm). 
What, no hyrdrometer? Get one! Hope this helps.

Foxx Equipment (no affilliation blah blah) sells manifolds just for that
purpose. They come with a valve on each output which has a backflow
preventer in it. These things are great.  The shutoff/backflow valves 
allow you to pressurize kegs to different pressures. Believe they come 
in 2,3,or 4 outputs and if I remember correctly the 2 output goes for 
about $20 or get a 3 output and have an extra line for other uses. If 
you build your own keep in mind the shutoff/backflow valves as it's nice 
to be able to carbonate different styles of brews differently, 
or be force carbonating one keg at 30 lbs while keeping another around 
12 lbs for serving.

Kevin,


One of the mysteries of brewing is the names associated with the various color
beers.  I mean you wouldn't call an IPA "pale" would you?  Likewise, in my early
days of brewing with Blue Ribbon Malt Extract, I was constantly perplexed at
trying to figure out Pale, Extra Pale, Light, etc.  So I finally realized it is
all relative and depended on the current beer drinking habits when a particular
style of beer was brewed and named for the first time. Light is darker than Pale
and Light can be used to make a Pale ale ( which is darker than the American
Pale)  type of brew.  All Better Now?  I didn't think so.  The can of Malt
extract you  got was probably just fine and hadn't darkened excessively in the
can.


Remember Light is dark and Pale is light.


Happy New Year and
Keep on brewin'

Subject: Bottling Time?


On New Years Day, I brewed my second batch.  As a novice that's been =
lurking for a couple of months I have a question.  I brewed from a kit =
(American Micro Style) obtained at my local homebrew store.  I followed =
the instructions (except I pitched 2 packets of Muntons dry yeast =
instead of just 1) and all went well.  Fermentation began within 6 hours =
and was vigorous for about 18+ hours.  When I got home from work =
yesterday (30 hr. after pitching) there was no sign of active =
fermentation.  Temp has remained pretty constant at 70 deg.  I was =
rushed towards the end and neglected to take a SG reading, so I can't =
give you that.  What's the deal here?  Have I got a stuck fermentation =
or am I just paranoid?  My first batch (purely extract) went OK, just =
very little carbonation after 3+ weeks in the bottle so I'm anxious for =
this batch to be "perfect".  Any thoughts/comments appreciated. TIA


BTW the instructions indicate fermentation should last "3 to 7 days" and =
bottle when FG is 1.005 - 1.010.  Ingredients included 3.3 lb. LME, 2 =
lb. DME, 12 oz crushed crystal grain plus bittering and finishing hops.

My sweetie want me to move into her country home. It's an older farmhouse
in the wilds of Wisconsin. My concern is the water. It seems to be hard on
copper plumbing. There is blue-green corrosion at flare fittings and it
leaves a blue-green tint where the old faucet leaked for a while.


I haven't had a chance to get the water tested yet. What sort of water

be better than trying to brew with this water?


Thanks in advance to all you water chemistry geeks.

Thats the standard method. I would recommend using Corn Sugar instead of
regular table sugar, if you have some around. The Corn Sugar tends to give
a cleaner taste once it's fermented. The measured quantity is about the
same too.


One suggestion I'd make would be to weigh your priming sugar once you've
measured your 3/4 cups. If you like the level of carbonation, it's always
easier to re-measure the exact amount by weight than volume.


Oh, and keep your Corn Sugar in a dry place so it doesn't soak up moisture
and change weight! :-)

Stuck sparging....I can relate to that.  I experienced a stuck sparge the first
time I used my Gott 5 gal mash/lauter tun only I was using a Listerman Phalse
Bottom.  I suddenly became the Turrets brewer.  That was my first and last stuck
sparge after I figured out that I should use a spoon to hold the phalse bottom
flush with the bottom and one to stir and s-l-o-w-l-y add the grain and stir at
the same time.


I also recommend that you use one of those nice big/long temperature probes from
Williams to accurately test your mash.  I suspect you're getting some inaccurate
reads from just the top half of your mash.  You might find it hotter towards the
bottom.  Good luck, have fun, and happy all-grain brewing.

Darrin writes about his first all grain "can you say stuck sparge"...


Well, I think the key here is the other little quote "Hell with any 
sparging...". Darrin never did say that he started sparging. 


The key to an easy flowing sparge is to keep at least 1 inch of water on top 
of the grain bed. This helps to prevent channeling and my guess is it would 
also keep your grainbed from turning into "cement".


As far as the bubbles getting into the loose tubing, you've got to just 
shove that tubing a little farther up onto the spigot, then pinch the tubing 
where the bubbles are appearing. This works for me.

I have heard this term tossed around quite a bit, What EXACTLY is an
"EasyMasher".


I am getting ready to modify my brew kettle (5 Gal) so i can try Kettle
Mashing (and consequently start ALL GRAIN Brewing) and would like to
bounce my plan off of you all.


My Plan...
drill a hole in the sidewall of my kettle as close to the bottom as my
spigot (tbd) will let me, and the i will add some sort of False Bottom.
My intent, and reason for this is to put my "grain bill" into the
kettle, bring the temp up to 150 degrees. let sit for an hour. then
Mashout, by raising the temp up to 170.  then i will drain off the
liquid into a plastic bucket, clean the grain out of my kettle, pour in
wort, bring to a boil, and add whole hops and adjuncts.  


If nothing else this will give me a brew kettle that will give me clear
wort, and leave the gunk behind (hops, etc), but i think this may be an
easy and inexpensive way to get into all grain brewing.

Use a disposable lighter to flame the top of the bottle and you can
drink
95% of the beer and leave only 5% in the bottle -- that will be enough.




what is the best way to "decant" the beer out of the bottle, pouring
seems like it would lose too much of the yeast.  siphoning seems like
you would drink most of it trying to get suction started?


i am going to start culturing yeast soon, and need to know the best or
