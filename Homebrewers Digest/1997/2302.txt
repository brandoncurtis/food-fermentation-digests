Subject: Perforated Sheet Goods Open Area Calculation


The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted as well.


I wrote a program to calculate open area of perforated sheet goods
given hole diameter and center to center distance, but when I checked
it against some tables I had in a catalog it did not come out right.


Finally figured out that I had written a program which worked for
"straight" holes, not staggered.  In a staggered hole pattern, while
the distance for center to center between holes is constant, the
distance between rows is not the same as the center to center distance
and I was calculating based on too few holes in one direction.


So, does anyone know of some sort of "formula" to apply to a center to
center measurement to get the row distance in staggered perforated
sheet goods?  I tried measuring on two very different sizes I have on
hand and it certainly is not a straight percentage of the center to
center distance.


If someone helps me out with something which works, I will be happy to
post the program source for all to use, but as it is now, it will only
work on "straight" pattern perforated sheet goods.


thanks,
dion

Subject: Brewing salts


I am interested in getting information from anyone who has used an additive
sold under the name "brewing salts".  It's label says it contains  "yeast
nutrients and heading compound".  I'm always interested in trying something
new, but I would like to know more about it before I try it.  What are the
specific ingredients?  Has it helped your fermentation?  Does it affect the
final flavor?  Does it contain any minerals like gypsum or chalk?  (I don't
want to add something that I already have in abundance in my local water.)


Also, I'm assuming that "brewing salts" are not the same thing as "Burton
water salts" which contains gypsum and papain.


Any information would be greatly appreciated!


Thanks - Ken Cannon.

On getting clear wort-
        Is there any non-anecdotal information that says that leaving trub
in the wort affects flavor adversely?  My beers always settle and are clear
after fermentation so I curious if we need to care.

I don't know what commercial "storage solution" is, but Fisher Scientific
recommended pH 4 buffer saturated with KCl if you run out.  I've had good
luck both with and without the KCl in the pH 4 buffer.

Right.


Priming the bottles individually is a time-consuming and error-prone
chore.  The amount of priming sugar you get into each bottle tends
to vary, resulting in variations in the amount of carbonation in your beer.
And worst of all, if you just put sugar into the bottles, the sugar isn't
sterlized or sanitized, and so could introduce an infection into an
otherwise perfect batch.


It's easier, and produces more consistent results, to mix your priming sugar
into your beer, in the bottling bucket.  If you're using corn sugar (aka
brewer's sugar), the recommended amount is about 3/4 of a cup per 5 gallons
of beer.  You may want to use more or less sugar (between 1/2 cup and 1 cup), 
depending on the style you're brewing - less sugar means less carbonation, of 
course.


The general procedure is to put some water in a pot (I use a 1-quart saucepan
and fill it half full).  The exact amount isn't important, as long as there's
enough water to dissolve the sugar, and not so much that you'll noticably 
dilute your beer (more than a couple of quarts is too much).  Dump the sugar
in, and stir it to dissolve the sugar.  Don't worry if it doesn't all dissolve
right away - more will dissolve as the water heats.  If you get close to a
boil and it's not all dissolved yet, then add a bit more water.


Boil the sugar water to sterilize it.  This will help prevent infections in
your beer.  After boiling, pour the water (carefully) into your bottling
bucket.  Then rack (siphon) your beer into the bucket on top of the water.
The swirling action of the siphon in the bottling bucket will mix the beer 
and the priming sugar without your having to stir (and possibly splash) the
beer.


Then just go ahead and bottle!  Each bottle gets exactly it's share of the
sugar, without the mess and bother of priming each bottle, and the sugar is
sterilized, so your beer is safe.

Subject: RE: Steve's mash schedule/Weyermann wheat malts (G.De Piro)


     Happy new year to you all!
     
     Steve describes his single decoction mash schedule, and in it he 
     doesn't add the crystal malt until after the decoction.  My guess is 
     that he wants to keep the sugars in it unfermentable and thus only 
     mash the crystal malt at ~158F.
     
     I have read about this practice on the HBD and have always wondered, 
     "Why do people do this?"  All the pro brewers I know mash all the 
     grain at the same time.  The sugars in crystal malt have been 
     caramelized, which (I think) makes them safe from degradation by beta 
     amylase.  I could be wrong about this, are there any other opinions 
     out there?
     
     If I'm correct, however, than there is no reason I can think of to add 
     the crystal malt at the end of the mash rather than the beginning.
     
     -------------------------
     
     Keith asks about using Weyermann's wacky wheat malts in a Dunkel 
     Weizen.  I just bottled such a thing.  I used 10 lbs of dark wheat 
     malt, 2 pounds of cara-wheat malt, and a few ounces of roasted wheat 
     malt for color (along with Munich malt, light wheat, and pils malt).  
     The mash was a single decoction.
     
     While the beer is a bit young, the aroma is very toasty and malty, 
     with the usual Bavarian yeast accents, too.  Very nice.  The flavor is 
     not as malty as the aroma portends, but hopefully this will change 
     when the beer ages a bit (just bottled it last week).

I picked up a 6-pack of Thomas Kemper Belgian White Beer over the
holidays.  They've redesigned the packaging, and the beer seems much
more potent than when I tried it over the summer.  Does anyone know if
they have changed the formulation, or is it just my imagination?  Also,
is this a good example of the Wit style?  If not, what is?


I intend to brew something similar this spring, so I streaked a petri
dish from the bottle dregs.  There seems to be a tiny bit of growth, but
it is NOTHING compared to the hefe-weizen culture I streaked at the same
time.  Could this possibly be a lager bottling strain?  (It is from
Thomas Kemper LAGERS!)

Subject: Yeast for Belgian Dubbel


Many thanks to those who have responded to my request for
information.  I have learned a great deal, and in particular, the following:


1.  Wyeast 1214 is has its loyal adherents who consider it to be one of
the best yeasts for the Abbey style.  It is reputedly Chimay.  If the 
fermenting wort can be kept cool enough it is the yeast of choice.


2.  1214, 1762, 1388 and 3787 all produce fine Belgian Abbey style ales. 
Dr. Michel Brown has pointed out to that esters are more predominant in
the lower numbers and reduce in the higher numbers.


3.  Dr. Brown also mentioned that 1388 and 3787 are well suited to
making Trippels and Strong Ale.


4.  1388 makes great beer but some people have experienced long
periods in waiting for it to settle out.  This also seems to require low
temperatures.  I have brewed with this yeast myself and can confirm
that it does make an excellent strong ale.  It is reputedly Duvel.


5.  1762 is reputedly Rochefort.  Inasmuch as Rochefort is the strongest
Trappist ale on the market and Wyeast posts a temperature range as
high as 75 degrees for this yeast,  this is the yeast I intend on using. 
While I love Chimay, I am concerned that even in  a cool room, a carboy
with two trash bags and a flannel shirt over it (OK I am paranoid about
my beer becoming light struck) may become too hot with the result that I
wind up in the "banana zone".  This yeast is also reported to ferment and
clear very fast.


Thanks again

Subject: Twistoff bottles


As is happening in millions of households across the country, I just
bottled the first batch of beer made from a homebrew kit received for
Christmas. I had been saving the bottles for months in anticipation.


I got half way through capping them when I realized that about 20% of
the bottles were twistoff! (The wife drinks `at`$#%$&%`at` Coors NA)


The crown caps that I bought actually had twistoff written on the side.
They seemed to fit OK and were tight. Does this matter? Everything I've
read mentions using non-twistoff bottles. Obviously Coors gets their
beer to carbonate OK in twistoffs.


TIA.

If particles in suspension increase the SG as measured with a hydrometer
wouldn't the SG measured by two hydrometers in the same batch be higher than
that measured by just one?
I haven't tried any experiments measuring SG but it would seem that suspended
particles would displace the liquid but not change its SG, as would the second
hydrometer.

I) If you make a beer with 2-3.3lb cans of syrup and 3 lbs of dme and want to
put raspberries in in place of one can of syrup-------How many pounds of
raspberries should you use for the same final alchohol content?Assume the
desired alchohol is about 8%.
2) If you used 1.5 oz of bittering hops at an alpha of 5.5 for the all malt
above , how much hops would you use with your recommended amount of fruit
instead of malt from question 1?
I intend to make this change for an upcoming batch. Last time , I added 7lbs
of raspberries to the recipe with the 2 cans and 3lb DME . The stuff was
rocket fuel! It all went in about 3 weeks though so its taste was agreeable.
I want the same taste but no more than 8%.

Actually, I'd like to, but I don't because the wort chiller makes it rather
cluttered in the kettle.  I have two screens in each kettle and they are
positioned along the sides (not in the middle like the traditional
EasyMasher(tm)).  After draining, the hops are just about at an even depth
across the whole bottom of the kettle.

It's not that crazy, but I don't do it for exactly the same reason you
mentioned.  I'm going to put photos of my system on my website, but
it could be a few weeks.  I'll start putting my website URL in my .sig
when it's ready for human consumption (still under construction for now).

Don't even get me started on the "sucking to start a siphon" issue...


No... just pour gently.  If you leave the last 1/2 oz of beer in there,
you will have 90% of the yeast.  Just make sure the beer isn't shaken
up -- i.e. make sure it is well-settled before attempting this.  You
also want to shake that last 1/2 oz of beer well to dislodge as much of
the yeast cake as you can.

If it is indeed Briess Dextrine malt, then yes, you do need to mash
it with some Pale Ale malt... not only to get all the goodness out of
it, but also so you don't get a starch haze.  I've also found that
other *very* pale crystal malts really should be mashed too.


Generally, I've found that most crystal malts labeled "CaraPils" fall
into two categories: 1) the ones that are about 8 to 10L and 2) the
ones that are about 2 to 5L.  The darker ones seem to work fine without
mashing.  The paler ones make for cloudy steep water which clears a
little after the boil, but not enough (I feel).


You may want to use one of the darker CaraPils (like DeWolf-Cosyns) which
don't need to be mashed.


Finally, you may want to reconsider that lemon peel because it contains
oils and will kill your head retention.  I suspect that if you are
dryhopping with Cascades, a slight lemony aroma will be overwhelmed by
the grapefruity aroma of the Cascades.  I once tasted a beer made with
lemongrass... it did indeed smell lemony and was quite nice.  Perhaps
you may want to consider that in place of the lemon peel?

There are two breaks - the hot and cold break.  Presumably letting the wort sit
around for hours allowed both breaks to settle out giving you an ultimately
clearer wort in the fermenter.

I get clear worts over the trub and hops in the brew kettle while it is still
hot, but it goes cloudy when I cool it in my counter-current  cooler  because of
the cold break forming as it goes down the pipe.  Eventually it settles and is
clear over the cold break ( which I leave in as a lipid source for the yeast) if
the yeast hasn't started quickly.  Presumably if you cool in the boiler with an
immersion chiller and wait long enough, you could get both hot and cold break
down before racking to the fermenter through some kind of strainer to hold back
the hops and filter the trub through the hop bed formed on the strainer.

 Pouring wort ( only cold wort, I hope!) through a strainer gives good aeration
but is much too ambitious and you will never get the filtering action of a good
hop bed.  Even the big boys lay down the hop bed quietly in the hop back before
starting a relatively gentle removal of the wort through the bed.  Using a
whirlpool method to move most of the hops and trub to the middle of the kettle
followed by a siphoning through a choreboy metal scrubber on the end of a
racking cane works wonderfully. Try it you'll like it!  I suppose you could
attach a Choreboy to the tap to get the same effect.


I prefer the choreboy type strainer versus a simple screen because the screen
tends to plug up.  The scrubber being larger diameter has more surface area than
a small screen and therefore a greater throughput of wort through the cane,
given each were surrounded by hops.  Using whole leaf hops and a choreboy on the
end of the racking cane in which the end of the cane is in the middle of the
scrubber and not near the edge, gives a virtually dry muck of hops and trub in
the bottom of the kettle, a high recovery of wort and no crud is carried over. 


Make sure you are using a copper finings like Irish Moss to help collect the
breaks into large flocs which settle rapidly and can be removed by hop
filtration.

He also wrote some good ideas on how to modify and use a cylindrical immersion 
chiller.  But I think chiller design can make a big difference here.


I wish I could remember who, but someone in HBD in the past two years wrote 
about using a "planispiral" wort chiller (it might have been in an e-mail to 
me, but it was an HBD response).  I could not find this word defined anywhere, 
so someone out there deserves the credit for the term I guess.  I interpreted 
this to mean a flat, or planar immersion chiller, so I made one with about 40' 
of 3/8" copper tubing.  The flat spiral shape was tough to form (I worked from 
the inside outwards), until I got a decent tubing bender for the first few 
tight winds.  I kept winding it until it was the same diameter as my brewpot, 
then used 14gauge copper wire to radially criss-cross tie the coils tightly 
together in four such "spokes".  The inlet water enters at the center and the 
exit line was tied about 120 degrees from the inlet tube.  A wire hook is used 
to form the third suspending point to hold the chiller in a plane right at the 
5.5 gallon height of my brewpot.  I wanted the coils to be just barely 
submerged.  When suspended in the pot, the entire wort surface is covered with 
copper tubing except for the 1.5" hole made by the center circle (result of the 
smallest radius the tubing bender could do!).  After tying the coils, the 
chiller became somewhat dish-shaped at the center, but I figured this gives me 
a litttle leeway in my fluid level at the end of the boil.  In any event, I 
call this my "hurricane immersion chiller", because of its shape, and because 
when I use it, the convection currents are visably active through the "eye" of 
the chiller when in use.  Another nice feature is I just leave it in the pot 
when I knock out through the kettle's spigot ( w/ copper chore boy filter 
inside of the pot).  Like Alex suggests, I get better results when I do NOT 
stir after chilling.  I think this is because the heavier hop cones sink first, 
with the break settling on top.  The cones & hop pieces form a natural filter 
bed this way.  Anyway, this works for me and stirring was a waste of my time.


I just wanted to share this idea, because I, like so many others, made their 
first immersion chiller by winding copper tubing around a paint can.  This 
cylinder design works, but you have to agitate or stir.  It's so much easier to 
sit back and let the "hurricane" do all the work.  I just suspend the thing 
during the last 10-15 minutes of boil (Irish moss time), then when I kill the 
burner, I dump in some finish hop pellets through the chiller's eye, put on the 
lid, wait a few minutes, then turn on the cold water to the chiller.  It drops 
the temp a lot during the first 10 minutes, but I let it run a half an hour to 
get it close to the tap water temp.  In the winter here in Phoenix, the tap 
water is around 60-65F.  During the summer, I run ice water through the chiller 
after running 85F tap water for 10 minutes.  Gets down to pitching temp rather 
quick, even in 100 degree weather.


To the original person who gave me this idea, Thanks!!  And to those people 
making immersion chillers, think two-dimensional.

Subject: Decoction Procedures


Steve Garrett's question on a single decoction mash got me to
wondering...What exactly do they mean when they say "pull off
20% of the thickest part of the mash" and boil for however long.
 I have read CP, Miller, and the Brewing Wheat Beer book and I
am still unsure.  I am assuming that they mean to scoop out 20%
of the mash, boil and add it back but where I get confused is
are you pulling out just liquid or liquid and grains?  I might
be nuts but if you pull off liquid and grains what are the tannin
risks?


I am very interested because I would like to brew "maltier"
German beers than the ones I am now with infusion mashing, but
I have always been skittish to try decoction mashing. I am also
interested in the value of double decoction over single decoction.


Thanks for the help

If your water is questionable, i.e. deep well water, you can save yourself
a lot of grief (and blue balls for that matter) by just buying six gallons
or so of distilled water whenever you need to brew.  That way you can make
anything from a crisp Pils to a hearty Stout by just adding a pinch of

i recently brewed a scotch ale (5 gal batch, mash-extract, 7# light liquid
malt extract, 4# 2-row, 1# 40L crystal, 1/2# toasted malt).  o.g. = 1.078.
16 days in primary fermenter.  s.g. = 1.028.  5 days in secondary.  s.g. =
1.026 (but bubbling through airlock every 35-40 seconds).  primed with 3/4
cup corn sugar and bottled.  tasted 15 days later.  while conditioning in
bottles, some of the bottles had a thick foam on the top like kraeusen.
when i opened a bottle the foam come rushing to the top and out.  if i pour
it fairly quickly the foaming is limited somewhat.  there seems to be no
signs of infection (no rings around the necks) and it tastes great.  did i
merely bottle too soon and get overcarbonated?  or could something else be

Just an FYI to anyone thinking of using an EasyMasher for filtering the
wort after the boil:  It doesn't work worth a damn if you use Irish Moss in
the boil.  The protiens coagulate all over the easy masher screen, plugging
it up and leaving you unable to drain your kettle.  I don't think Jack uses
Irish Moss (and I think he'll even argue that it's unnecessary) so this has
never been an issue to him.  And I suspect that it works fine for this
purpose if you don't use the moss.


Aside from that little 'problem', the EasyMasher is indeed a great gadget.
Wish I'd invented it... ;-)

My understanding is that the end SG is not the issue but rather that the

3 days, if they're the same then you should be ready to bottle!)   And

You're not going to find much for $2/ft or less that will work for handling
boiling liquids.  Braided vinyl tubing is about the only thing in that
price range, and it'll delaminate at boiling temps (I think it's rated for
150 to 180F or so).  


I went through this search almost exactly a year ago whilst designing my
converted keg system.  I settled on some 1/2" ID Norton PharMed tubing, at
about $4/ft in 25 ft. lengths (the only way it's packaged).  This is an
opaque, flexible tubing with 1/8" walls, rated for something like 250F.
Doesn't get soft and limp at high temperatures, fairly good at not picking
up smells from the wort, and quite durable.  I've been quite happy with my
decision.


Since I didn't need a whole roll, I found 2 other guys on the 'net to split
it with.  You might have similar luck.  I'd also advise you to check
several places before you purchase this stuff - depending on where you go,
you'll find very wide differences in price (the roll I bought was $110; I
found prices as high as $150 at some mail-order scientific supply houses).
