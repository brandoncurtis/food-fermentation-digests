Dan,


I have taken 2 six packs on a commercial flight with no difficulty.
I passed it through x-ray for carry-on and when asked what was in the
bottles,  I told the security guy it was homebrew, he said "Oh, somebody's
going to have a great flight".  


I just stuffed the gym bag in the overhead compartment.  Of course, this
stirred up the yeast sediment, but we let them settle for a few days
afterward.


I have never (kiss of death?) had a bottle explode here at home, so I never
considered that one might blow at 25000 ft.  The cabin pressure is pretty
stable, I don't think that will be a problem.


Enjoy the ride and the brew.

Subject: Decoction Mashing, re: to Chas P. post (George De Piro)


     Howdy!
     
     Yeah, yeah, I know you're all probably sick of my writings on 
     decoctions, but I would like to discuss Chas's post.
     
     Chas describes how he decocts by mashing 1/3 of the grain overnight, 
     at a starting temperature of 125F, allowing the temp to fall to ~100F. 
     He says in this way he takes care of his protein and acid rests.  In 
     the morning he heats it to saccharification, then boils it, then adds 
     it to the "main" mash (the remaining 2/3 of the grain).
     
     He does this to avoid leaving the main mash in the protein rest range 
     for too long.
     
     One problem I see with this is that he's leaving 1/3 of his mash in 
     the lower protein rest range for several hours, while 2/3 of the mash 
     never gets a protein rest.  Depending on the malts you're using, this 
     could leave a lot of higher molecular weight proteins and lots of very 
     degraded proteins (free amino acids), with not a large amount of the 
     more desirable mid-weight proteins (that provide body and mouthfeel 
     without as much haze potential as the larger proteins).
     
     Also, the bacterial action that occurs in a pot of wet grain at ~110F 
     over 8 hours will be noticeable.  The mash may taste a bit sour, 
     which is not usually desirable.
     
     I usually avoid over long protein rests when decocting by heating the 
     main mash to saccharification and then pulling the decoction (after a 
     good deal of conversion has occured).  I then boil the decoction mash 
     and add it back very slowly to avoid raising the main mash to too high 
     a temperature.
     
     I'm not really using the decoction to achieve temperature steps, just 
     to form melanoidins.  This won't work in some people's systems, but 
     it's definitely less work than splitting your brew session over two 
     days.
     
     Have fun!

Caveat: what you will probably get is an average over a long period,
usually a year.  And it's generally not the most recent year, which
doesn't matter much unless they've changed water sources and/or
treatments since they last printed up the analysis.


If your water varies significantly throughout the year, as it will if
much of it comes from surface sources (river, e.g.), then the report
is useful, but should not be taken as gospel.

Subject: "Technical" agar questions (Paul Henning)


I've seen a variety of posts in the last few digests about obtaining
"agar-agar" at Asian groceries.  My problem is sort of opposite of
that.  I have access to a wonderful biochemistry supply store, but I
don't know how to specify exactly what type of agar to get.  On the
Yeast Culture Kits homepage, they mention "YM" agar and "YMA" agar.
Are these appropriate?  Do I need to specify anything else?  USP?


As a side note, what does the designation "USP" stand for?  It seems
to imply that the product receiving that designation is safe for food
use.  Is that correct?

Avery makes a removable label stock, part number 6464, that is perfect.  The
labels are 6 to a page, 4" x 3.33".  Although spec'd for laser printers, I

Subject: Sparge Temperature - Why not lower


I'm going to try this again using a different system.  Sorry for the
garbled post; hope this one appears normally.


A series of niggling problems, poor planning, and interruptions
resulted in my wasting enough time prior to sparging that my sparge
water temperature dropped to the high 150's.  I raised it to the low
160's by adding boiling water, but I ran out of preboiled brewing
water, and headroom.  Since I use gravity feed, I didn't want to
screw around lowering 10.5 gallons of hot water and heating it back
up, so I didn't worry and sparged away. I had already mashed out to
168=B0F.  Over the course of a 2 hour sparge (22# grain bill in 10
gallon Gott), the temperature of the sparge water dropped from about
162=B0 to about 156=B0.  Granted, I need to better insulate my reservoir.
=20


Extraction was a whopping 80% efficient compared to my expected 75%
or so.  I guess this was the result of continuing enzyme activity
during the sparge, although I ended up mashing for 2.5 hours, which
was an hour longer than planned.  The wort tasted great and fermented
out quickly in primary.  The beer is drier than I hoped when
transferred to secondary (1.010 SG), but still tastes great.  It
shouldn't have been more fermentable, though, since the temperature
during sparge was higher than my 153=B0F mash temperature. =20


So the question is:  Why not sparge at these lower temperatures?=20
Seems less attention to ph would be necessary to prevent tannin
extraction.  What difference does it make if the enzymes keep working
a bit?  Why was the wort apparently more fermentable than planned?


Thanks,

But pay attention!  For some completely bizarre reason, you
will occasionally find "agar agar" that is actually white
tree fungus.  The actual agar is sold in long lumpy-looking
strips.  The Chinese use agar for various treats (many dim
sum dishes), and the fungus in dishes like hot & sour soup.

Subject: yeast recommendation (Jerry Cunningham)


First of all, thanks for all the great stuff you all have been posting
lately - lots of interesting articles (I especially liked Don Van
Valkenburg's dry hopping observations) and even a plaid joke! 


I'm going to try my first true lager soon, and I need a recommendation on
yeast. I'm planning on a German pils following closely by a doppelbock,
using the same yeast. The old Wyeast spec sheet recommends these strains:


- ---
German Pilsner:  Light to medium body. Dry. Bitter. Medium to high hop
flavor and aroma.  Very low diacetyl OK.  Nofruitiness/esters.  Wyeast 2007,
2124, 2308.


Bock/Doppelbock:  Full body. Malty. Low bitterness. Low diacetyl OK. No 
fruitiness/esters. Medium to high alcohol.  Wyeast 2124, 2278, 2007.
- ---


So, I was thinking of using one of these strains:


2007  Pilsen lager yeast  A classic American pilsner strain, sturdy and
simple to use.  Ferments dry and crisp.   Flocculation -medium; apparent
attenuation - 71-75%. (48-56F)


2308  Munich lager yeast  A demanding strain, but capable of producing some
of the finest lagers made.  Very smooth, well-rounded and full-bodied.
Flocculation - medium; apparent attenuation - 73-77%. (48-56F)


2124  Bohemian lager yeast  A pilsner yeast from the Czech Republic.  Ferments 
clean and malty, with rich residual sugarin full gravity pilsners.
Flocculation 
- - medium; apparent attenuation - 69-73%. (46-54F)


I'm leaning towards 2007 or 2124, the "demanding strain" clause from the
2308 description kinda scared me off from that one. I also have some yeast I
scavanged from a growler of DeGroens Pils (from Baltimore Brewing Company, I
believe it's viable) that I was thinking about using - does anybody know
what strain this is? 


Thanks for any help!

Vince Mitchell asked about All-Grain --> Extract --> All-Grain conversion.


See my web page (URL below) for my article on all-grain to extract
conversion.  The basic idea is to take each grain individually and decide
whether an extract substitute is available, whether a simple specialty-grain
steep is adequate, or whether a mini-mash is necessary.  Then combine these
steps into your recipe and fire away.


As far as going from extract to all-grain, this is where it gets tricky.  For
conversion of only pale extract, substitute pale malt (pale ale malt in
english ale recipes, lager malt in lagers, etc).  The converision rate would
be about 1.5 lb grain per lb of dry extract, or 1.3 lb grain per lb of liquid
extract, assuming about 75% efficiency (typical).


For "dark" and "amber" extracts, you have several options, none of which will
be right all the time.  The reason is that "colored" extracts may or may not
contain anything in addition to pale malt other than coloring.  And even if
it did contain dark malt, how much and what kind is never revealed.  So you
have to guess.  My suggestion is to substitute pale malt as described above,
then add appropriate (for the style) specialty grains to bring the color up
to the same as the extract.


Converting all-grain to extract is useful for the extract brewer, but
converting extract to all-grain is unnecessary IMHO since there are many fine
recipes and style guidelines available.  Extract beers are often (but not
always) "simplified" versions of the beer style they represent, and for
reasons already mentioned, a lot of guesswork and augmentation would have to
go into a conversion.  Start form scratch with all-grain.

Subject: First Brew Troubles


Being the pioneer brewpub in this province is exciting but not without
frustration.  We lack sources for discussion locally, and therefore the
learning process can at times be hindered.  We kegged our first brew two
weeks ago (a top fermented amber ale using extracts).  We poured yesterday
and two problems ensued.  First, the brew is extremely cloudy and has
excessive sediment, despite having been filtered.  Second, the brew is flat
(we use a CO2/Nitrogen, 70/30 carbonation system which has been effective
for all imported kegged beer).  We didn't clarify the beer.  Could this be
what has caused the cloudiness, and if yes, will it help if we clarify now?
And then the problem of carbonation remains.  We'd like to salvage this
first brew because ... well it's our "maiden brew" ... and because despite
these two unfavorable characteristics, the brew imparts a rather pleasant
flavor.  What can we do about it now, or what should we look to change in
future brews?  Suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated.

Hello fellow brewers!


I have been looking everywhere for a large (~12inches diameter) strainer
and an accompaning funnel for straining my wort before going into the
primary.  I can find a strainer at Walmart, but it is not fine enough to
get out the pellet hop remains.  


Anyway, I figure that I can get something from a commercial kitchen supply
place but 1) I don't know where any are and 2) they probably won't sell
just one to me.


What is everyone out in homebrewland using?  My brewpot is large and does
not pour very easy so I am trying to be neat.


Any comments would be appreciated.

Everybody knows peroxidase is an oxidizing enzyme not a hydrolyzing

instead of using H2O. Phenols aren't eliminated, instead the oxidized
phenols readily polymerize, hopefully to such an extent that they

Hi there,


In HBD Volume 02 : Number 025 Dave Hinkle posted his experiences with 
planispiral chillers.  To my knowledge Ed is the one who came up with 
this idea, but I wouldn't be surprised to discover that it occurred 
to others independently.


I built mine after looking at the one Ed built and it has served me 
well.  I made mine out of 1/4" copper tubing, and would recomend 
3/8's I think for somewhat increased rigidity.  Mine works quite 
well, but I am in the process of changing my brewing setup in many 
fundamental ways, and rather that build another immersion chiller for 
my new 15 gallon boiling vessel, I'm going to do a counterflow 
chiller this time.  Ed to my knowledge is currently in Ontario and last
I heard he was no longer subscribed to HBD.  I do not know his 
current email address.


Ed did also write a letter to BT describing his chiller, I have that 
issue at home but do not remember which one it is.  If there is 
sufficient interest I'll dig it up and post the year and version.

My question is, if the non-husk beer has 91% of the tannins of the husk beer
and hops contribute only 33%, where does the rest come from?  Am I
misinterpreting Bill's statement?  Are the husks sieved off after they have

Sorry, Ronnie, but the glass envelope around the pH meter electrodes is critical
to the measurement and the type of glass and thickness is important and the
manufacture is still somewhat of an art. There is a reference electrode ( which
can be calomel - mercuric chloride ) in there also.  In the old, old days pH was
first measured electrically with a bare platinized platinum electrode in a
hydrogen gas atmosphere versus a calomel electrode connected by an agar-agar or
gelatin containing potassium chloride bridge. Very clumsy and both the hydrogen
and calomel are dangerous, especially around sparks and a foodstuff like beer. 


My recommendation - don't waste your time or money.  Buy whatever you want -
temperature compensated or not -  it will be a lot cheaper and certainly it will
work. Personally, I wouldn't bother with temperature compensation, since, as
pointed out the other day here, pH itself also varies with temperature.  Use a
metal cup ( I use a thick walled metal shot measure or a SS measuring cup) which
can be cooled quickly to the desired reference temperature with ice and water on
the outside. 


My advice -don't re-invent the wheel. Why not spend your time on a RIMS or
something else where your creativity can be useful?   
- -----------------------------------------
Mark Bayer clarifies his question about cloudier wort resulting from putting it
through a sieve versus just drawing it off the brew ketle.


Answer.  Part of the purpose of the rolling boil, particularly after the Irish
Moss is added, is to collect the trub into larger flocs which settle rapidly.
By putting them through a sieve you broke them up and these smaller particles
settle slower.  The solution - siphon the wort off through a choreboy scrubber
which can use the hops as a filter bed and not break up the flocs.

Greetings Beerlings!


Having read a little about decoction mashing (single, double, triple)=

been interested in trying it to get the benefits of the improved malt=

The question is whether decoction mashes will add any noticeable flav=

would apply to "No Sparge" mashing.


Currently, I brew extract beers.  Would any of these two techniques p=
rovide
improved maltiness if used with a partial mash (again, only talking a=

not lagers)?  Would it require full volume wort boils (6 gallon), or =
could the
sweet liquor from the partial mash (~3 gallons) be used for the wort =
boils that
I would add my malt extract and hops on the stovetop?

This is not a good recommendation to make.  Any metal finishing with
steel on a stainless piece will embed small particles of steel in the
stainless which *may* eventually rust.  One should never recommend
using steel wool on stainless.  Stainless steel scrubbers are not even
a good recommendation because being the same hardness as the other SS,
they will tend to scratch it and those scratches can be sites for
corrosion to begin at.  This is one of the reasons that in commercial
production of stainless steel things that after all fabrication is
done (usually the machining) that the pieces are passivated in nitric
acid to eat the steel away.  The best way to clean SS is the
recommendation made by John Palmer, and that is an oxalic acid based
cleanser and a ScotchBrite pad,  or if you are actually trying to
remove welding oxidation, UTP, a highly corrosive acid paste made
specifically for that job.

I've had great luck using plain old paper with my color bubble jet.  I format

paper cutter to cut.  For "special occasions" like Christmas/Hannukah Sparkling
Cider gifts, I used a fancy recycled stock purchased from Wal-Mart, with equal
success.  I attach them to the bottles with one of those paste sticks.  The
labels come right off when soaked in water.  I have also started a collection of
one empty bottle of each batch.  My wife sprayed some kind of lacquer on the
"permanent bottles" to protect the labels from discoloration.  Welcome to
brewing -- enjoy!!!

 I use just good old white or colored paper...thing is with Inkjet is that
the colors or even the black and white ink will run...but I got around that
one, Get to an art supply store and get a can of clear acrylic sealer. Spray
you labels with this after they are printed out. Let dry and they will never
run!
As for the glue..... I use good old MILK, yes, I said milk. 
Pour some milk in a small dish and run the BACK of the label over it, no
sence in getting the top wet. Lay it on the bottle and hold one conner with
your thumb and with a dish towel dry the label off,....gently rub untill all
the air is gone from under it. This will stay on untill you soak it and it
floats right off.

Actually what has happened here is a change in the crystalline structure of
the metal. Most pots and utensiles are a 300 series stailess which is an
Austenitic stainless. Welding causes the formation of ferrites. The
material around the welds is now a Ferritic stainless (like some 400
series). You will also find that the material around the welds has lost its
non-magnetic properties. Sanding or otherwise cleaning the surface will not
fix it. It is permanent. This problem is common and well known.

The pump is a

The pump is cylindrical with about a 4 inch diameter and the following
specs are printed on its side
1500 rpm  115 Volts   60 Hertz   .48 Amps


The two-page brochure that came with the pump is a general bulletin

Hartell and their uses (hot and cold water circulation up to 200F and
150 psig,...etc).

Can anyone direct me to a design or set of plans for using this pump in a
RIMS (I already mash in a 10 gallon Gott cooler with a Phils Phalse
Bottom in case there is a design for a Gott RIMS )? If this pump isn't
