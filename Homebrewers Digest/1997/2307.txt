What about pulling your decoction and heating it in an oven? It wouldn't
scorch that way? Just wondering...

Subject: Labels


There have been a few post about what sort of sock to use to print up labels.


I just thought I'd point out why you are probably not getting a heck of a
lot of recommendations to try Avery labels. Recently I bought a whole box of
these and they are great until you try to get the label off the bottle.  The
glue they use is terriffic, which is the exact opposite of what you want
when you're ready to reuse the bottle. When you try to peel the label off,
the glue stays on the glass. 


I have the Avery 5163 2x4 labels. I have some 2" clear packaging tape which
can be placed right over the label and seal the ink.  Unfortunately I
thought of the tape idea after I bought the labels (obviously you don't need
glue on the paper if, by making the tape just a bit longer than the paper,
you can use the tape to get the paper to stick to the bottle).


I'm going to try some of the other ideas that have surface here.  Thanks, folks.

Tom, if you sparge lower temperature, then sugars will crystalize and wil=

Reason that you obtained good efficiency was the long mash time.
Beware of extremely long mash timrs: it can cause to a typical flavour =

Several people have asked about advice on opening a homebrew shop. I have 
certainly never done it, but if I were contemplating doing so, I would go 
to a large town far enough away that I would not be competition and I 
would talk to the owners of the homebrew shops there. I am sure many 
would be happy to help, and maybe allow you to work there for awhile and 
see how the shop works.

From: "A. J. deLange" <ajdel`at`mindspring.com>
Subject: Aggressive Corrections/pH Electrodes


My recent posting on agressive water contained two glaring errors (2 points
to Dave Burley who spotted both and 1 point for Bob McCowan who got 1 -
thanks guys). I wrote "an aerator rather than a neutralizer to drop the pH"
where I meant "raise" the pH. I still have trouble with pH going in the
opposite direction from ion concentration. Now I'm not saying old Doc
Sorrenson did it backass, it's just a mental block of mine.


The other goof referred to KCl exchangers being preferrable to NaCl in
terms of the aggressive question. If some muse inspired me to write that
the other night she has deserted me now and I can't think what I had in
mind at the time. I can see no reason why replacing calcium with potassium
is any better than replacing it with sodium as far as agressivity is
concerned. If the calcium is removed, the water becomes more aggressive.


For those who may be bothered about pure water dissolving copper which has
a reduction potential greater than that of hydrogen, a very brief
explanation follows. The reduction potential for the half reaction Cu++ +
2e -> Cu(s) is


      E = Eo + .03ln(copper ion concentration) (at 25C)


The tabulated value is the value when the copper ion is at unit ionic
strength (concentration) which is E = Eo = + 0.34 volts (ln(1) = 0). Thus


      E = + 0.34 + .03 ln(copper ion concentration) (25C)


When copper is placed in pure water, the concentration of copper ion is
initially very small and E is therefore quite negative so that the reaction
procedes in the opposite direction to that written and oxidation takes
place. As oxidation procedes the copper ion concentration rises until
.03ln(copper ion concentration) = -0.34. At this point the reduced and
oxidized states are in redox equilibrium. The other details have to do with
the other half reaction. I'll be happy to supply the details to anyone who
wants them. I estimate that the equilibrium copper concentration in DI
water at 25C in equilibrium with the atmosphere would be about .15 ppm at
pH 7. Note that that is not very much.

Someone requested information on the fabrication of pH electrodes. This
just isn't practical. There are so many electrodes available today over
such a wide range of prices and capabilities that I can't believe that
anyone could make one for less than one of better performance could be
purchased. The upcoming issue of BT will have an article which discusses
some aspects of electrode selection.

Subject: Carrying beer onto planes


I have also carried homebrew and commercial brews onto commercial airlines
with no problems at all.  Airport security gas no problem with it either
and actually, they will usually give you a smart-ass comment too :)   I
usually carry a case of bottles onto planes when I travel. I recommend you
rig up a harness that supports the bottom using clothesline rope and a
handle.  Avoid using the box handles, because they will fatige and
sometimes tear off with constant use (like toting it through airport
terminals on the way to your connection).

This is not a good recommendation to make.  Any metal finishing with

From: Mark Preston <prestonm`at`labyrinth.net.au>


...I have done some reading on aeration of wort with a fish tank pump,
how does one go about keeping the air that is pumped into wort
contamination free??...


  From ideas read on the HBD I built a filter.  It took me a while to find
out what I could easily get in my local area, but once I found out what can
be had it was real easy.  


  From the drug store, I bought a cheap plastic hypodermic injector syringe.
It does not need the needle, just the plastic part will do.  Throw away the
plunger as it is not needed.


  The small end that the needle would normally connect to is now inserted
into the small tubing available from the fish store and the pump is
connected on the other end of this tubing.  Get a rubber stopper to fit into
the larger part of the syringe. (At this point I must tell you that it is
much easier to get a syringe that will fit the rubber stopper). The stopper
must have a drilled hole to accept your standard syphon tubing.


  Sanitize everyting, then stuff two sterile cotton balls into the half inch
diameter syringe, place the stopper into the syringe after inserting the
syphon tubing into the stopper first. I place my racking cane into the
fermenter without any airstone, and bubble away for 4 hours or untill I am
ready to go to sleep that nite.


  So basicaly all you need is :


      1 - syringe casing
      1 - drilled stopper
      2 - sterile cotton balls


  You already have:
      
      pump
      pump tubing
      syphon tubing
      racking cane

Subject: Wyeast London ale yeasts


Greetings!


        I'd be interested in a discussion of Wyeast's London ale yeasts 
(1968 and 1318 in particular).  


        First, 1968 is probably my favorite ale yeast -- very complex 
and malty, and wonderful for ESBs.  My only complaint (and it's a minor 
one) is that I typically have to increase my hopping levels to have the 
hop character come through past the malt and other flavors.  I'm curious 
if anybody knows the source of this yeast -- is it Fuller's?  


        I remember a short thread several months ago that the 1968 
strain may have changed in the last year; Wyeast Labs now calls it 
"Special London ale" or something like that, whereas before they called 
it "London ESB".  I haven't gotten a new packet since the change.  Has 
the 1968 strain been changed?  Also, is 1968 a mix of several strains?  
Also, in their most recent flier, Wyeast Labs recommends repeated 
aeration and rousing of the yeast to get it to finish properly.  I've 
used 1968 a lot in the past and never had any problem getting acceptable 
levels of attenuation (around 70%, which is in 1968's expected range) 
without doing any extra aeration or rousing after start of fermentation. 


        So, do any of y'all have observations on your experience with 
1968 recently, particularly about whether it's been changed and whether 
it now really needs additional aeration and rousing to get proper 
attenuation? 


        Second, anybody know anything about the new yeast, #1318, 
"London Ale III" or the "Thames Valley" yeast, #1275?  I recall raves 
about #1318 a while back in the HBD. Any of you really like these new 
yeasts, or really dislike them?  How do they compare to #1028 (dry, 
minerally), and 1968 (malty, complex)?  Also, what's the source -- is 
1318 from Young's?  And what's the source for 1275?

Subject: Sanitizing mini-kegs (Alex Santic)


Kevin Sinn <skinner`at`MNSi.Net> asks:
>I've just purhased a mini-keg system and I'm curious as to the best way to
>sanitize them.  I'm aware that chlorine bleach will pit the aluminum over
>time. What are some other alternatives?


The mini-kegs I use seem to be made of some type of thin stainless. These
are the ubiquitous German variety, but if yours are really aluminum then
you are using something different. 


The most obvious answer is probably iodophor. It's non-corrosive and
no-rinse (convenient because mini-kegs drain rather slowly so rinsing is a
pain). Personally, what I've identified as the biggest problem with
mini-keg maintenance is getting them to dry.  It can take ages with just
the little bung-hole for ventilation.  Therefore I wash them physically
clean with hot water, drain as thoroughly as possible, and place them in a
200+ F oven for a few hours. This would seem to eliminate the need for a
sanitizer, though you can use the BTF iodophor as well if it makes you
more comfortable. 


The heating technique may yet turn around to bite my butt. Most of these
mini-kegs are laminated with plastic on the inside. It's important not to
damage this coating or the containers will start to rust. But so far I've
not detected any ill effects from the heat...just don't overdo it.


While we're on this subject, let me mention another interesting kegging
solution. The 5+ gallon Edme plastic pressure barrels that are common in
the UK are also available in the States. I think they are distributed by
L.D. Carlson and I've found a few homebrew outfits that sell them. A very

No, Man, don't strain your wort unless it is also frosty or nearly so or you
will ruin it through oxidation.  Also, this violent action will break up the
trub and it will be carried over into the primary.   Attach a copper or
stainless steel Choreboy scrubber to the bottom of your racking cane and siphon
your chilled brew into the primary.  The scrubber acts as a filter for the hops
and the hops filter out the trub. It is cheaper and neater than a strainer and
funnel.

yes, you can use decoction with ales and with partial mashes
and get excellent results.  I routinely do this.  I would,
however, recommend not using one in a mash consisting of a
large percentage of colored malts, like what would happen
in a munich beer.  When I have tried this, I have gotten
tannins so hot they burn your mouth.  As an alternative,
but pale malt in the decoction, and save any colored malts
for the main mash.

The day before you brew, boil six gallons or so of the water and left 
it sit overnight (covered).  Next morning, the minerals should have 
settled out.  If that sounds like too much work (it can be), try 
brewing a batch with water straight from the tap (this is the 'relax, 
don't worry' principle).

Subject: Re: Spiral Heat Exchangers   --    Jim Bentson


 Recently there have been a number of posts about spiral heat exchangers and
who "invented" the idea. As often happens, this is a reinvention of a common
device used in a different field. The spiral heat exchanger is extensively
used in applications  in mechanical and chemical engineering. I haven't done
an extensive search but found a reference to a paper entitled "Spiral Heat
Exchanger Heat Transfer Characteristics" in the 1947 Chem. Eng. Prog. These
devices are probably older than anyone reading this. 


 From what I read in the literature, the suggested method of analyzing them
is to treat them as a helical coil of radius equal to the mean radius of the
spiral. This means (that at least in the forced convection case   i.e.
moving the coil as you cool) the two designs will probably not differ
significantly. In the free convection case( the unmoved coil) the major
difference that I see is that in the helical case,  thermal currents see a
blockage due to the next coil above it. The spiral design  would not have
this blockage and the interaction between adjacent thermal currents is
reenforcing rather than retarding. My guess (and it is only a guess) is that
the spiral is therefore probably more effective in promoting mixing due to
this. In addition, in the spiral,  the thermal currents are distributed over
a larger area


 The main difference between the helix and spiral is due to the fact  that
in a curved duct, the centrifugal forces acting on the internal cooling flow
affect the heat transfer. In the helix the radius of curvature is constant
and these forces are also. In the spiral, the centrifugal forces increase as
the radius decreases. 


 For the technically inclined they both are discussed in the "Handbook of
Single-Phase Convective Heat Transfer" by Kakac, Shah and Aung

the difference in performance of the EM is due to differing flows?

Ian Smith <rela!isrs`at`netcom.com> in #24 asked:
>Does anyone know what the 5 l mini-kegs are made of ? I have seen

I have one I got for playing around with before converting to corny kegs.
It's definitely made of aluminum.  It contains no mfg's name and appears to
have a lining like a beer can.


>Also I was told that you can only pressurize

>psi can cause bulging. I called the manufacturer's distributer in the >
U.S. (they are made in Germany) and they are rated to 3 bar (45 psi).


45 psig (or even psiA!) is OUTRAGEOUS, at least for the mini-keg I have.  A
steel keg would have to be *really* heavy to withstand this pressure due to
the large, flat ends on the kegs.  Mine has ends about 6" in dia.- that
works out to a force of about 850 pounds on the keg ends at 45 psig.  No
wonder they bulge at 30 psi!  I'd be *extremely* careful with pressures
higher than 10 psig.  A compressed gas contains alot of energy.  Ever pumped
up a tire with a hand pump? It takes a good bit of energy. The energy that's
not lost to heat is stored in the compressed air.  If the keg ruptures it's
likely to do so rapidly hence, the effects might (depending on the amount of
gas space in the keg and the pressure) resemble those of a small grenade.
To pressure test them, first fill them completely with water.  Then, if
there's a leak, it's not likely to explode since water is incompressible
compared to air.


To force-carbonate and use mini-kegs, I'd force-carbonate in a corny keg
then fill the minikegs from the corny with a counter-pressure bottle filler.

There's no reason that the pot can't be covered.  I'm using 1/4" thick piece
of plastic intended for window glazing as a cover for a mechanically
agitated immersion chiller I'm working on.  It does deform maybe 3/8"
vertically from the steam and heat during boiling (for sanitizing it and the
chiller coils).  This ruled it out as a support for the gear motor agitator
and chiller coil (wood "rails" are used for that purpose).  Otherwise, it
performs fine.  The necessary gap between the lid and the chiller
inlet/outlet lines is sealed with a bit of plastic food wrap.


For those using an immersion chiller or a racking cane which mandates
cracking the pot lid open, plastic wrap works well for sealing the crack.
Well, you can't seal it 100% since air's going to get sucked in as the wort
cools and as it's drained off, but, it at least keeps stuff from falling or
(in the case of bugs) flying in.  It clings nicely to a hot pot.  FWIW, the
Walmart (blah, blah...) brand has the most cling and is cheap too boot.

Lee,
   I've always cut by pickup tubes about 1/2 " just in case their is some
residue that settles once I move by beer to the keg. A hacksaw works fine
but if you can get a tubing cutter like is used for copper tubing, it gives
a smoother cut and has less chance of having a bur. If you cut with a
hacksaw, you may want to sand the end slightly to give a smoother finish
and less places for bacteria to hide.

Golden Hop.  The following description in from the catalog:


"Released in 1995 by USDA and NW Ag Experimental Stations.  Brilliant yellow
foliage.  Aromatic cones are suitable for Northern European type pilsners.
Grow Sunbeam in filtered light or semi-shade.  Foliage may brown in bull
sun. Vigorous."


Has anyone heard of this hop, grown it, used it or know any more about it?

Subject: Do you really NEED to boil the wort?


G'day,


After several successful partial mashes (and noticiably improved beer)
I'm setting up a plastic electric all grain brewery to give it a go.
I already had a 2400W element and a 45 l (11 gal) container so I thought I'd
give it a go as a kettle.
The first test boil of 26 l (7 gal) basically produced a result I expected would
happened  - it couldnt maintain a rolling boil without a lid.  With the lid 
sealed it boiled violently, however without it the temp could only reach 98 C (208F)


Is it really necessary to have a rolling boil or will 98 C be OK if I stirred 
it frequently. I've heard you must boil with the lid off.  Is this correct or 
can I simply leave the lid on to maintain the boil?


Secondly, I haven't insulated the container yet.  Has anybody else has this problem
and solved it by isulation or should I just increase the element power?


TIA

There have been a lot of comments about the use of the EasyMasher(tm)

claim it doesn't.  In order to understand why this might be, I think we need
to know more about the particulars not only of the brewing process, but
more importantly, the specifics of the Irish Moss and how the individual
brewers treat it - is it powder or flake, is it added to the kettle in the last
15 min or is it there for 30, do the brewers presoak it, or add it dry.  It
seems to me that we may find the answer to why some feel IM and EMs
don't mix in the answers to these and similar questions.

Subject: Simplified version of decoction?


Greetings All,


        Several people have written recently about concerns with excessively
long protein rests while decoction mashing.  I tried a simple variation on a
single decoction yesterday, while brewing a "Dutch Pilsener,"  that seems to
address the various problems.  I thought I'd run it by the group to see if
there are any obvious problems that I've missed.


        The idea is just to start with a very thick mash and use a combination
of infusions and decoction to get the malty flavor from a decoction, but to
avoid prolonged rests that might yield too much protein degradation or too dry
a finish in the beer.  I also hoped to follow George Fix's 50-60-70 mashing
regimen, but without spending all day on a double or triple decoction.  (I had
originally planned to use the 40-60-70 program, but the grist of this lager
includes enough adjuncts that I thought the 122F rest was needed.)  Dough in
with just 8 quarts of 132F water for 10 lbs of grain, to hit 122F.  Rest 15
minutes.  At 15 minutes, pull about 1/3 of the thickest part of the mash (with
a strainer) and remove to the decoction pot.  Add 2+ quarts of boiling water to
the decoction to hit the lower end of the saccharification range (anywhere in
the 140F+ area), then apply heat to reach 158F and rest 20 minutes. 
Meanwhile, about 30 minutes after doughing in, add 3+ qts of boiling water to 
the main mash to hit 140F, then rest until the decoction is ready (which should
be about 30 minutes.)  Boil the decoction vigorously for 20 minutes, then add 
it to the main mash to hit 158F.  Rest about 45 minutes (if you're too lazy 
to use iodine tests, like me) or less, then mash out to 168F with direct heat 
or infusion and sparge as usual.


        The whole process was not much more involved than a step infusion mash,
but should have the malty "decoction flavor" I was after.  It avoids the long
protein rest that you often get with decoctions (by infusing the main mash to 
140F after half an hour, rather than waiting for the decoction to finish 
boiling.)  It also avoids a long rest at 140F, that might yield a very dry 
finish from too much beta amylase action.  And, most importantly, it was 
about two hours shorter than the double decoction schedule for the same beer. 
The sparge, by the way, was a typical "decoction sparge": very easy, with 
very clear wort.  Apparently boiling even just a third of the mash seems to 
yield some of the benefits of full scale decoction.


        Please let me know if you see any obvious flaws in this idea, or have
any ideas for improvements.  I'm looking forward to sampling the beer, but
these lagers take so much patience!
