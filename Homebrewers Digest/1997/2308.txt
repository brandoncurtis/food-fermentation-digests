Subject: Heating mash - scorching


Hey folks,


I have a question pertaining to the design of my brewery. I have thought
about using the opposite of an immersion chiller to heat the mash in my new
three vessel brewery. What I am thinking is along the lines of an
electrically heated RIMS only using a copper coil submersed in hot water
and pumping the wort through the coil and back onto the mash bed. I have
received a question to this on how hot the water would have to be to
prevent scorching or at least denaturing the enzymes as the wort travels
through the coil. Not being one of the engineering heavyweights I can't
answer the question. I plan on doing some testing to see what I get for
temp raises using water and adjusting for the increased viscosity in the
wort to avoid problems associated with over heating the mash. Do any of the
RIMS inclined folks have any comments as to what their electric heated
systems induce on the wort as it passes over the heating element? I realize
that I will have more liquid in contact with heat for a longer period of
time, depending on what temp the hot water is set for. Can anyone comment
on the effect this will have on the wort as it is recirculated through this
coil. 


Some more specifics on design. Using 1/2 barrel sankey kegs with 3/8"
copper tubing from mash tun to pump and then flexible (read: vinyl) tubing
from pump to heating coil inlet. 20' of copper total for the coil assembly
and then 2' of flexible tubing back to the reciculating unit in the mash tun. 


As I stated before I am not sure what temp to set the Hot Water Tank to
yet, but if anyone would care to make a fair calculation or even an
educated guess at a place to start from I would appreciate it.


Thanks and cheers,
Bill

However, it was conveniently designed to be too large for use with carboys.  A 
glance at the manual explains that you can eliminate the need for racking from 
a secondary by using a FermenTap.  Biting my tongue and assuming this wasn't 
done to try to get people to buy the Fermentap, it's still a useless product 
for the many people who primary in glass.  I don't think we'll be re-ording 
any more for our store.  Most customer's 2nd remarks have been "how do I get 
this in my carboy".  Once I point out the statement on the back leading them 
to the Fermentap, they place it back on the shelf in disgust.


A good idea poorly executed.

Zymurgry is pretty good, but since it only comes out 4 times a year (+ the
special) I get anxious for more.

Subject: No-sparge data, planispiral chiller


Another data point for no-sparge brewing.   Both batches in a 10 gallon
Gott with slotted copper manifold on bottom.  Single temp. mashing with
no mash-out.  Grain crushed with a 2 roller mill at the homebrew store.


I reported the results from my first attempt earlier, but to review
(Batch 1):
- - 3 gallon recipe
- -12 lbs of grain mashed with 4 gallons of water (1.33 qt/lb) at 154-150F
for 90 minutes
- - Collected 2.5 gallons of 1.075 wort, diluted with water to just over 4
gallons at 1.051 SG
- - Left 1.5 gallons of liquid in the tun, or 0.5 qt per lb of grain.  


Batch 2 (new data)
- - 5 gallon recipe
- - Mashed 19.3 lb malt in 6.5 gallons of water (1.33 qt/lb) at 156F for
60 minutes
- - Collected 4.1 gallons of 1.075 SG wort
- - Diluted to 6.2 gallons of 1.052 SG wort and boiled as normal
- - Again I left 0.5 qt of liquid per lb of grain in the tun 


Now I can plan for higher and lower gravity brews for my system, since
the results appear consistent. 


Batch 1 has been in the bottle for one week now and tastes great.  I
typically use Shrier 2 row as the primary base malt.  I can't comment on
the maltiness of this technique from Batch 1 because I used Marris Otter
pale malt for the first time.  Batch 2 was made with Shrier, I'll post
the subjective tasting comments after bottling. 


I re-worked my old 1/4" copper immersion chiller into a planispiral
chiller this weekend.  It worked very well, no agitation to get a
uniformly cooled wort.  I wish I had done this in '93 when it was first
posted.  As mentioned in an earlier post I "weaved" 18 gauge copper wire
in four radial lines through the coils to keep them from drooping too
much when suspended in the wort.   If anyone is thinking of doing this
many hardware stores sell the tubing (1/4" or 3/8") already in a
planispiral shape, all you have to do is bend the ends fo the tubing
(inlet and outlet) so that you can run them over the top of the kettle.
Give it a spin.

Subject: Boiling Wort, a reply and a question (George De Piro)


     Hi all!
     
     In the last digest somebody from down under asked if boiling is 
     necessary, or if it is enough to just heat the wort to near boiling.
     
     From my experience, you can achieve a good hot break by holding the 
     wort at around 200F for several hours without ever boiling.  I don't 
     know what kind of hop utilization you would get, though.
     
     I also don't think that most people would want to wait several hours 
     to achieve a hot break.
     
     Several of you may now be wondering why on earth I know that you can 
     achieve a hot break without boiling.  This segues nicely to my 
     question:
     
     Can anybody think of some reasons that it would harm the wort to heat 
     it to ~200F, then let it sit overnight before continuing the brewing 
     process (T ~140F the next morning)?
     
     I have had to do this because of scheduling conflicts and/or longer 
     than expected pre-boil brew days.  I have done this on three or four 
     occasions, with no apparent ill effects (a Weizen I made this way 
     actually won a blue ribbon!), but then again there was no "control" 
     batch to compare it to.
     
     Any opinions?
     
     To continue my reply about boiling, the poster mentioned that he can 
     achieve a rolling boil if he keeps the lid on, but has heard that you 
     should keep the lid off.
     
     The reasons to keep the lid off are to allow evaporation of water and 
     to allow evaporation of DMS (Dimethyl sulfide).  DMS, in excess, will 
     make beer taste like a can of creamed corn.  It boils at 35C (95F).
     
     I think you may find that you can keep the boil going by either 
     keeping the lid partially on (so that gasses escape, but some heat 
     stays in), or by leaving the lid on and occasionally removing it (a 
     pain in the butt).
     
     Have fun!

Subject: Stout, Irish and Dry


Hello!


I received this recipe with an Irish Stout kit for x-mas. It fits neatly
into a one gallon spring water container from the grocery store:


One gallon spring water (minus one pint to be used at priming)
1 lb. Dry Malt Extract (DME)
3 oz.s of roasted barley 
2 1/2 oz.s of brown sugar (my addition - I tried a couple of variations and
this one I liked)
1/4 oz. of northern brewer hop pellets
1 oz. priming sugar mixed with the one pint remaining water.


The basic directions were: run the grains through the coffee machine with
eight cups of spring water then add to the DME with the rest of the water
and hop pellets. Cook for one hour. Ferment in the original gallon jug. Mix
in the priming sugar and final pint of water after fermantation is finished
and bottle.




I want to convert it to a 5 gallon batch. Here is my guesstimate:


Recipe Makes     :  5.0 gallons
Color (srm)      : 94.9 
Hop IBUs         : 27.5


7.00  lb.     Pale Ale
1.00  lb.     Flaked Barley
1.00  lb.     Roast Barley 
1.00  lb.     Brown Sugar 
1.00   oz.    Northern Brewer  7.5%   60 min


Questions:


1.) The flaked barley adds head retention but from what I've read so far a
protein rest is not needed because the haze normally found won't be visible.
Is this true?
2.) In the partial mash recipe the grain is briefly steeped in the coffee
maker - how will the taste and color differ if it is mashed full cycle in
the whole grain recipe?
3.) I have never had a stout or porter that I liked comercially (never tried
guinness) but the kit I liked. Any recomendations or improvements will be
gratefully accepted. Thanks.

The husk fraction was sieved off before brewing in the M&B Sci

Subject: Big Head follow-up


Thanks to everyone who provided suggestions on improving my head size.
Here's a summary.


If brewing a high-gravity beer, such as Belgian abbey's, add fresh
yeast when priming.  I guess this would be called a "finisher" as
opposed to a starter.


The quantity of priming sugar that will provide a big head is larger
than I thought.  Checking an article at The Brewery site
(http://alpha.rollanet.org/library/YPrimerMH.html), and advice from
Dave Burley, both point to using 8-10 oz. of corn sugar for styles
such as wheat beers that maintain big head.  The 5 oz. that I used for
these styles seems paltry in comparison.


The last point, which was made by several people, was the importance
of protein, not only for head retention but also head formation.  The
most common suggestions were to either add some wheat malt to your
grist, or skip the protein rest altogether.


Thanks for the help,

Subject: Re:Using kegs as sparage water containers


- -
Does anyone see any potential problems with using a corny keg to hold my
sparage water (with a towel wrapped around it for insulation) and
delivering the water under pressure to my sparage arm?  I had planned to
install an inline valve in the line from the keg to the sparage arm to
control the flow.  Right now, with about 5psi and no valve, it makes the
arm spin around so fast I think it's going to take off.
- -


I've been using a keg for sparge water for the past 2 batches and love it. 
You don't have to worry about having a height difference and the sparge
rate is MUCH more controllable.  With a gravity system you lose a lot of
head pressure towards the end of the sparge but with a pressurized keg you
can keep the flow rate constant or adjust it to whatever you want.  The
heated air in the keg actually helps because you end up using less Co2 to
pump the water.  


I learned this from my local HB shop, who also suggested that I solder
(lead-free) copper end caps on the sparge arm to replace the plastic ones
that are likely to pop out because of the pressure.

Jean-Sebastien writes:

I believe that such a small difference in thickness would not be noticeable
in the finished beer.  Thicker mashes don't necessarily promote *all*
enzyme activity because for some enzymatic reactions the products of the
reactions slow the reaction (and a thicker mash would mean a higher
concentration of the products).


What you may be thinking of is that thicker mashes protect more heat-labile
beta-amylse from being denatured as quickly and therefore thicker mashes tend
to favour the production of maltose (along with a reduction in dextin levels)
over the level created in a thinner mash at the same temperature.


I do know that between alpha amylase (less heat-labile) and beta amylase
(more heat-labile), thicker mashes tend to make for a more fermentable
wort (i.e. the heat-labile beta amylase *lasted longer* in the mash and
cut up more of the dextins into maltose).  A similar grouping of the
proteolytic enzymes exists: peptidases and proteases.  The peptidases
break medium-sized proteins into amino acids and is more heat-labile
than the proteases which break big proteins into medium-sized proteins.
The medium-sized proteins contribute very strongly to mouthfeel and
head retention.  Furthermore, dextrins contribute to mouthfeel too.


[SPECULATION MODE ON]
It would seem logical that if a thicker mash protects beta amylase, it
would also protect the peptidases too, no?  Therefore it seems that
a thicker mash would have TWO reasons for having less mouthfeel than
a thinner mash *at the same temperature*.
[SPECULATION MODE OFF]


The difference in thickness to cause a noticeable amount of difference is
much greater (I don't have my copy of MBS or Fix here, but I'm sure that
"thin" would be at least 50% more water than "thick").

Hello Beer Brewers
        I've been very happy with my mini-keg set up (2 years now).  I
have a tap which allows me to switch mid-keg from CO2 to a hand pump which
lets me save those CO2 cartridges.  But for parties, it would be nice to

with these types of taps?  How well do they work?  How expensive are they? 
This information would be very helpful.

We must be careful to not jump to the wrong causal relationship (remember
the relationship between aluminum and Alzheimers?).  I find it very
hard to believe that a 100% fermentable sugar, made of little other
than a molecule of dextrose and a molecule of fructose could increase
head retention.  Presumably, the "moussyness" of the head would have 
to be affected by the only other factor in the equation and that is
the extracellular enzyme invertase that the yeast produce to allow
them to ferment sucrose.  I'm still very skeptical.


What about the moussy head in Bavarian Weizens (certainly not made
with sucrose)?


Let's not forget that head is a combination of head formation (increased
with high carbonation) and head retention (primarily increased by
increasing the level of medium-sized proteins) are not the same.  If
you don't have enough protein, increasing the carbonation will not
give you better head, it will give you more carbonation (like Pepsi).

I'd reccommend against it.  Rumour has it that this strain is the A-B
yeast and the level of acetaldehyde it produces backs up that assertion.
This is a great yeast for cloning Bud, but will give you too much
acetaldehyde for a German Pils or Bock.

Yes, this yeast has a tendency to create some byproducts that take months
to lager away.  I made a Bock with it that smelled like home perm solution
for four months of lagering (at 40F), but then the smell went away and the
beer won several ribbons.

I've heard that this is the Weihenstephan 34/70 yeast.  If so, it is one
of the most popular yeasts in Germany.  I would suggest either this yeast
or the Wyeast #2206 Bavarian Lager.  That's another very clean and popular
yeast in Germany.  I made my last two bocks with the #2124 and #2206.
The #2206 is still in the primary, so there's no data yet, but the #2124
batch is very nice.  I used it also for a Doppelbock, but it got a little
fruity.  I believe that I had the fridge set to 60F for the first 8 hours
and when the yeast took off, it raised the temp up even more.  I should
have started at 55F or even 50F.

When you write "clarified" I presume you mean "fined."  As for why your
"filtered" beer is cloudy, I cannot say.  Either your filter's pore size
was too big and all of whatever is clouding your beer didn't get filtered
out or you used too high a pressure and forced it through the fitlter.
You didn't give the recipe, but if you used grains that need to be mashed
(like Pilsner, Pale Ale, Biscuit, Munich, and Aromatic malts, for example)
and you didn't mash and laeuter them properly, then you have starch haze and
you are stuck with it (well, you could use some amylase enzyme, but I
recommend against it).


If you did use a very large pore size (say, larger than 5 microns), lots
of yeast could have still gotten through and now if you are drawing off
the bottom of the tank, you could be just getting the little bit of yeast
that did make it through.  If this is the case, the beer should start
running clear after you run off a handful of pints.  Do you have an outlet
higher up in the serving tank?  If so, you can check the clarity at the
higher outlet to see if it's just settled yeast at the bottom.  Note that
if your yeast happens to be a slow flocculator, you could get a clear
sample higher up and still have a bbl or two of cloudy beer.  If this
is the case, you can help settle the yeast faster with isinglass or gelatin.


Why it's flat is easy... since it's an ale, I'm assuming that you have it
at ale serving temperatures (55F or so).  At this temperature, to get between
2.0 and 2.5 volumes of CO2 in the beer, you want it to see 15 to 20 psi
of CO2.  But you are using 70/30 CO2/Nitrogen (usually the 70% is
N2 and the 30% is CO2...) so you need to increase the pressure the beer
sees of this mixed gas.  If indeed it's 70% CO2, then divide the 15 to 20
psi by 0.7 to get the pressure to use (21.43 to 28.57psi).  If it is 30%
CO2, then you need to divide by 0.3 and use 50 to 66.67 psi.  The reason
it works for the imports is because they are pre-carbonated.  Incidentally,
you want to add the finings before you carbonate or you will have a huge
gusher on your hands when you add the finings.

Subject: lowering pH of canned wort? (Sandy C.)


Hi all,
I am hoping to can a dozen quarts of sterile wort this coming weekend.
I have previously done so with the boiling water method as I have no
pressure cooker. I often read that this is a potential health hazard
from botulism.  My 1st question to the collective is - can I add acid blend
or something else to lower the pH of the wort to around 4.0 so that I am
in the range of "acid foods" like you always hear about for the boiling 
water method?  Question #2, will this cause any problems with my yeast?
I don't think it will, but before I make up 3 gallons of this I wanted to
check with you all.
Thanks!

collective homebrew conscience:


regarding leaving your "rest mash" in the protein rest temperature range for
a longer than desirable time when decoction mashing:


doesn't the fact that you have the vast majority of the starch grits in the
decoction vessel minimize this danger to a great degree?   i mean, i realize
there are proteases and peptidases in the rest mash, but there's not really
much protein in the rest mash for them to break down, is there?  it's in the
decoction vessel, isn't it?

Glenn asked about Sunbeam hops.


Glenn,


I bought a rizome from freshops in Oregon a couple of years ago.  This was
one of the strains that I bought.  *


I planted in spring of 1995.  The yield was not great for the first
harvest, but I understand that to be normal.  I did not brew with them.


I did however have a pretty nice yield this last fall.  I did not brew with
them.  I'm an all grainer, and I just can't see brewing up a batch based on
'guesstimates of alpha acid', plus going through the hassle of drying etc. 
I've got too many hops in the fridge as it is.


Besides the hops did not have much aroma, which doesn't hit the profile
'Northern European Pilners' very well.  It was a strain that from what I
can tell, has not taken off **.  I probably would have made a test extract
batch had the things given an aroma.  (I sample aroma from green to all the
way to brown - nothing.)


If you are interested in growing hops, and you should be*** , its early to
order yet, but look through the brew mags for Freshops or one of the other
growers, and call for a list.


By the way the Sunbeam was a Saaz hybrid.


Hope this helps.

I am in the process of building a brew system ala Marty Tippin

mash with a recirculating system.  To date I have used a Gott 
cooler to mash in starting with an original strike water addition 
at a calculated temp for the first step at +/- 1qt water/# mash.  
Subsequent temp steps were attained by adding calculated amounts of 
boiling water. The mash out step was ignored.  I will now be mashing
in a kettle with fire under it.  The question is: should the mash
water be added all at once and then temperature step increases
attained by heating the mash kettle, or is it better to start with a 
thicker mash and add water in subsequent stages?  Another question is
about flow rate for recirculating the mash.  Is 1 gpm a reasonable
rate?  Thanks in advance for any assistance.

I noticed upon re-reading that I referred to mini-kegs as being made of

Some other posts indicate that these cans are made of aluminum. Not having
been so fortunate as to never see them rust, I think I can confirm that
they are made of steel, not aluminum. 


Even with the plastic linig intact, they have a few vulnerable areas. 
They are prone to rust along the top and bottom rims if left on a wet
surface. They will also rust around the edge of the bung-hole if left
filled with liquid for a protracted period.

Morning Marshall (and thanks for rescuing our Sailors!).


I've recently made a 13 gal boiler from a plastic bin which is fitted with 
2x2.75 KWatt kettle elements.  Uninsulated, with both element on it will 
boil in about 1 hr. 10 mins.  However, by insulating it with green house 
bubble wrap this time can be shortened by up to 15 mins.  Once the liquid 
is boiling, it will maintain a reasonably vigor boil with just one element 
on.  If it should be necessary to get the boil more vigorous (e.g. to 
reduce volume quickly), the other element can be switched on again.  Since 
I haven't tested the difference in the final beer between boiling with 1 or 
2 elements, I'll stick to using 1 for an long as I can purely on grounds of 
economy.  BTW, each element is plugged into different sockets on my ring 
main.  Hope this helps!
