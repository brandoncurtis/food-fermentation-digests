Greetings Homebrewers,


I started wondering about the extraction of excessive tannins during the 2nd
and 3rd decoctions when you are pulling out some of the grains and boiling
them.  I recall always reading that boiling of grains in not good, and will
cause excessive tannins in the wort and then final beer.  Why is this not a
concern with double and triple decoctions?

I've been doing this for a couple of years.  Yields achieved are very high
implying that enzyme degradation is not significant.  


Water bath temperature depends on many things including recirculation rate
and the temperature profile you are trying to achieve.  Usually in our
system we achieve a recirculation temperature 10 C below the water bath
temperature. Two thermometers and a little experience with this setup and
you'll be step mashing with the best of them.  We usually do step-infusion
mashing and only use the water bath for temperature maintainance during
recirculation for wort clarification and to raise the temp. for mash out. 


The water bath adds a lot of thermal stability to the system so small
drifts in temperature are damped out.  Scorching and browning would tend
to be less than in an electrically heated RIMS system.

>Glenn & Kristina Matthies ask about Sunbeam hops------------


Sunbeam was developed and registered as an ornamental hop by Al Haunold 
(recently retired) who at Corvallis, Oregon,  developed many hops currently in 
use today.  Sunbeam was registered with the USDA as an ornamental hop, along 
with its sister hop Bianca.  Though not recomended for commercial production, 
the literature does say that it could be used for brewing purposes.  Here are 
some excerpts from the registration that was filed with the USDA:


"Sunbeam and Bianca originated from a cross made by geneticist Alfred Haunold 
in 1990 on the diploid virus-free selection Saazer 38 (USDA #21522) with a 
tetraploid European-type aroma male (USDA #21617M)."  Both Sunbeam and Bianca 
are diploids, which supports the assumption of open pollination.  


"Sunbeam has bright colored red stems throughout the growing season, which 
makes it particularly attractive in contrast to its yellow lemon-colored 
foliage.  It is a female hop which matures early to medium early (about Aug. 
25 in W. Oregon) with medium low yield potential.  The cones are of medium 
size and yellowish green.  Sunbeam's quality characteristics, largely 
inherited from the Saazer mother,  are 4-5% alpha acids, 2.5 % beta acids, a 
cohumulone content of 36 percent, and an oil content similar to that of Saazer 
(about 1-1.2 ml/100g)."


"Sunbeam and Bianca were observed as single plants for three years in an aroma 
breeding nursery near Corvallis, Oregon where they grew vigorously in early 
spring and reached the top of the trellis (5.5 meters) at approximately the 
same time as other seedlings or commercial cultivars growing nearby.  Their 
foliage remained brilliantly yellow throughout the spring and early summer but 
showed some burning in mid- to late summer in direct sunlight, brobably due to 
insufficient protection by reduced chlorophyll pigmentation in the leaves.  in 
semi-shade or in the greenhouse, under simulated semi-shaded conditions, 
leaves remained attractive and undamaged throuhout the growing season."


Hope this is helpfull.

Subject: LM34 temperature sensor/RIMS

The LM34 will output a very small voltage proportional to the temperature.
It can easily be connected to a digital voltmeter that can read into the
millivolt range with good accuracy and resolution. 


A computer may have a plug in board which will respond to analog voltages.
It's called an analog to digital board. The better boards will have a
greater range of input voltages and better resolution.  The resolution is
described as the number of bits. An inexpensive board will have 8 bit
resolution, a better board will have 12 or more bits of resolution.  With an
8 bit board you can only measure 256 levels of resolution meaning that if
you were to feed the board with the LM34 output the most accurate readout
would be 256 different temperature readings. This is if the output varys
from the lowest to the highest level that the board is setup to read.


In the case of the LM34, I do not have the spec. sheets in front of me but I
seem to recall that it would output 2 volts at 200 degrees F. So if you have
a board that will resolve 0 to 5 volts for instance, you would lose over
half of your resolution because boiling water at 212 would output 2.12
volts, therefore the maximum number of resolution steps would be 2.12/5.0 X
256.  


This might get you in the range of 2 or 3 degrees of readable temperature
resolution.  Resolution but not accuracy.  Two entirely different animals.


The cheaper LM34 has an accuracy of a few degrees F. If you use the computer
to convert an output of a specific LM34, then you calibrate against a known
reference (oh oh! - do you smell big bucks here?), then you can have much
better accuracy. You still are limited by resolution however, and drift in
characteristics with time.


If you enjoy the smell of hot solder, you can have fun constructing an
amplifier to boost the output of the LM34 to match the input characteristics
of the analog to digital board.  You may also design in adjusting devices so
that you can set the gain, range and span. This will allow you to have a
better instrument, but now beyond the realm of simplicity.


Once you have all this resolved, you can relax, have a homebrew and consider
yourself an engineer.


Happy Brewing

Subject: HSA/force-carbonating/kraeusening/CO2 pressures and hose lengths


Here are some questions I saved and never got around to answering
before HBD V1 croaked.  I still haven't seen them answered and since
searches will be doable when the HBD moves to its new home, I feel
it's important to address these issues.


Nigel writes:
>1. Do you need to worry about HSA caused by splashing etc between mashing 
>and commenceing the boil? 


Yes.  As a matter of fact, according to Charlie Scandrett's post from
a few months ago, HSA during the mash can actually be far worse to the
quality of the finished beer than HSA after the boil.


>2. At what temp can you start to aerate after boiling without worrying 
>about HSA? 


Among the HBD subscribers (over the last 9 years), 80F (27C) has become
sort-of a defacto standard.  However, according to DeClerck, very little
detrimental oxidation occurs below 140F (60C).
 
Personally, I cool to 70F for ales and 55F for lagers.  Say, I'd like
to mention that I chilled 5 gallons of Bock wort two weekends ago down
to 50F with tapwater and an immersion chiller.  Yes... Chicago tapwater
(about 40F), 35feet of 1/2" OD copper tubing... it took about 45 minutes.
I was busy aerating and pitching the Tripel and when I got back to the
Bock, it was at 50F!.

15 to 20 minutes at 20 psi with 45F beer will give you several dozen glasses
of foam.  Also, you can serve the force-carbonated beer 1 hour after force-
carbonating (just give the swirling eddies in the keg some time to settle).


Here's what I recommend:


1. get one of those charts of CO2 volumes vs. pressure vs. temp (there
are some in the archives as well as many in kegging articles) and Byron
Burch's books,


2. cool your keg/beer to the serving temperature,


3. select the volumes of CO2 you want from the chart and read the
proper pressure for that number of volumes,


4. dial-up that pressure and shake the keg till you don't hear gas going
in anymore (you can speed up this process by adding 5 psi for the first
5 minutes of shaking), and


5. use at least 6 feet of 3/16" ID hose for the liquid line (if you are
using a high level of carbonation, you will have to use an even longer
liquid hose).

This is very imprecise kraeusening... "1-2 Tlb" should probably be "1-2 tbsp"
and still, that's not precise at all.  I don't have my books here or I would
give the proper formula for calculating the amount of malt you want to use,
but I believe this has been posted.  My main point here is *the method
described above is more likely to give you the wrong level of carbonation
than the right level!*

Yes, always deliver the beer with the faucet wide open, but the length of the
hose *DOES* indeed make a difference.  The longer the hose, the more pressure
will drop *inside* the hose and the smaller the pressure difference will
be between the beer AT the faucet and the room air pressure.  If the hose
is too short, the pressure drop from the inside of the faucet and the
outside will be too big and a lot of your beer will turn to foam.


This "the hose length doesn't matter" kegging information has been posted
and printed FAR too many times.  It is *wrong* and I wish that people would
stop posting it.

This is wrong.  Beer can be served at a lot more than 15 psig.  The reason
*you* can't is because you believe that hose length doesn't matter.  Again,
I don't have my books here, but I'll bet that with 10 feet of 3/16" ID hose,
you can serve 50F beer at 20 psig (assuming it is not overcarbonated --
i.e. it is at steady state at 50F and 20 psig).

I see several problems.  One, when you want to do a decoction, remove the
THICKEST part of the mash (the grain)... NOT the thinnest part.  By boiling
the thinnest part, you are killing the enzymes.  The reason you got a low OG
is probably because you did not take enough runnings (you should take about
6 to 7 gallons of runnings for a 5 gallon batch).


>Basically, I am wondering 1) Is that damn thermometer defective? (Regardless, 
>I'm getting a dial-type this week) and 2) Did I actually get the right sugars 
>and what-not at such a low temp? 


The thermometer is not to blame.  The thermal inertia of 9 pounds of grain and
a 10 quarts of water is so much higher than that of the 3 quarts you decocted
that I'm not surprised you didn't get much rise in temp.  What you should
have done was take 1/3 to 1/2 of the grain with a seive, add a few quarts
of water (so it doesn't scorch) and heat that to 158F for 30 min, then on
to a boil for 5 min.  Add this back slowly watching the temp of the main
mash and stirring as best you can without aerating.  If the temp of the
main mash starts to get too high, let the decoction cool before adding the
rest back.
 
You mashed at a low temperature and got a lot of maltose and very few
dextrins.  The resulting beer was probably a bit thinner and quite a bit
drier than you wanted.

You are missing a lot of oxygen there... rember that it's 66% ABOVE
saturation or 166% of saturation.  You're right that this is not in

Whoa... I have to disagree.  There are probably several hundred thousand
wild yeasts and bacteria in 2 gallons of air in even the cleanest house.
The question is: do any of those wild yeasts and bacteria multiply fast
enough and make nasty-enough byproducts (like phenolic aromas) to ruin
your beer?  I know that, in the summertime, in my house, they most certainly
do.  Therefore, I switched to fitered air and then oxygen for aeration
and the problem went away -- I can now brew confidently in the summer
without my English Bitters smelling like Bavarian Weizens!

Subject: Making starter wort


Greeting!


I am planning to brew next weekend and need to prepare some starter wort in
order to step up to my normal 1 litre starter.  I have always used "canned" wort
that I made from LME (from Dave Miller's Book).  


This time I will be making starter wort from a bag (3 lbs) of amber DME.  I have
read on the HBD of brewers that make up a cup of starter at a time.  Does anyone
have a routine (recipe) that works for them?  I will be using hop pellets (cause
thats what I got in the fridge).


TIA,


John

Note that for extremely thick mashes of column 1 there is a drop-off
in the amount of maltose produced compared with column 2 - normal mash
thickness.  I find M&B Sciences statement that beta-amylase is more
effective in thick mashes a bit hard to justify by comparing column 1
and 2.  Comparing columns 2 & 3 (normal and somewhat thin mash) there
is a drop-off in maltose at the intermediate mash temperature of 150F
for thin mashes.  It is possible that this trend continues for very
thin mashes of say 2 to 3 quarts per pound - in which case the
statement has justification.  I understand that some traditional
decoction mashes used thin mashes around 2.5 qts / pound.


As far as proteases are concerned, check the soluable nitrogen figures
above.  Nitrogen (mostly from  protein) is greater for the thicker
mash at every temperature, and very much greater for the thick mash at 
140F.  Having said that, M&B science notes that despite previous
assumptions, quite a bit of nitrogen is soluabilized in the mash for
even pale ale malt due to the action of carboxypeptidases which can
survive higher temperates that the endo- and exo-peptidases of the
traditional protein rests.


If you want extra soluable protein for body, a thick mash rest at
55C-62C/131F-143F should help considerably.

George De Piro writes ..

M&BS and several other sources indicate that a rolling boil is
necessary for good flocculation.  pH is also critical for good
flocculations. YMMV.


George also writes ...
>     Can anybody think of some reasons that it would harm the wort to heat

I take it hops haven't been added and that a 60+ minute boil takes
place the following day ?  The DMS issue isn't so much the temp at
which it boils off as its rate of formation at these higher temps.
[BTW - there's an obvious error/typo in Fix's PoBS book in his kinetic
formula for DMS formation - a first order kinetic reaction doubles
roughly every 10C not every 100C at 'reasonable' temperatures].


I think the biggest risk is the chance that additional aeration and
oxidation will take place, a form of HSA.  If you leave the lid off,
DMS will be lost, but aeration is potentially much higher.  With a lid
on a vast amount of DMS is trapped and may be difficult to eliminate.
Even with a lid, because the wort is constantly cooling overnight, it
will be difficult to exclude air from the kettle.  You could bubble
CO2 thru the wort overnight, but now the cure is worse than the
disease.


George frequently appears in the 'winners circle' and is a first rate
brewer so I'm certain he has a good handle on DMS flavors as well as
subjective evaluation of these beers.  I'd be interested in knowing
how the 'shelf life' and staling or other HSA related properties of
these beers stands up to other more typical homebrews.  George ?


My instinct would be to cool the wort to <90F and seal it.  Then boil
the next day.  This method has the potential for infections and other
problems too, but DMS and HSA aren't among them.

My preference for a Porter is Scottish Ale Yeast (can't remember wyeast #,

stating that they (as do I) regularly decoct munich and vienna malts.
Perhaps the problem is the source of the malt.  One widely distributed
US maltster uses 6-row barley for every malt except one labeled as
2-row pale.  I can imagine that a decoction from it's 6-row munich or
6-row crystal might turn out badly.

Subject: Motorizing a PhillMill


Greetings all,


I'd like to ask some advice regarding motorizing a PhilMill. A few 
weeks ago I thought I'd try to motorize my PhilMill by attaching my 
drill to the crankshaft of the mill via a bolt with the head cut off 
(exactly as per the directions that came with my PhilMill). Without 
any grain, the mill ran nicely. The minute I added any grain, whammo, 
it stoppped dead. The mill ceased turning via the drill whether I 
added a few grains at a time or whether I had the hopper full. 


Now, I am a bit embarassed to say that I am not very mechanically 
inclined (Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor I am not), but I have heard that 
these mills can be automated using an electric drill. I have  Sears 
Craftsman 3/8' variable drill (3.0 amp/ 0-2500 rpm). Is this drill not 
powerful enough? What am I doing wrong? Not only did the mill not turn 
using the drill, I had one hellofa time getting the bolt back out! I 
felt like such a putz. If there are any of you out there with 
motorized PhilMills, I'd love to hear from you.


TIA for the advice,

This will be my second run with this recipe. The first had 90 IBU's, which
I admit was a little over the top. I expect it to be very drinkable in 2-3
years! <grin> I'm afraid the Biscuit and Aromatics will tend to give me a
very strong malt profile, so I'm trying to balance it with Brown Malt,
Chocolate, and Hop bitterness. If you notice, I haven't used Black Patent
or Roast; I want to stay well away from a Stout-ish taste.

Nope, that's what I got in the freezer -- for some reason I just can't seem
to get European hops in the higher range in Montreal.

I'll probably replace the 40L Crystal with 1kg+ Carapils to get more
mouthfeel and less colour. I'd like a dark ruby red, but the Aromatic,
Biscuit, and Brown Malt are making this difficult. :-)

The first one at 90 IBU was a little too bitter. :-) I also used Munich
Malt which gave just a hint of maltiness, but not enough, which is why I
went for the Aromatic and Biscuit in this one. I've heard Special-B is also
quite good in Porters too.


My first batch was mashed at 150F and gave an FG of 1.020. I'm still
puzzled by that one.... :-)


Thanks for the interest!
