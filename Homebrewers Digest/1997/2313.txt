From: "P. Edwards" <pedwards`at`iquest.net>
Subject: White Labs yeast (Paul Edwards)


One of the local HB suppliers is touting a new product - White Labs Yeast.


The info sheet says some things that got me scratching my head, so I
thought I'd troll for information.


First, the info sheet claims that the vial contains 300-500 billion (yes
with a "b") cells.  Now, it looks to me that the vial has maybe an ounce or
so of slurry covered with some liquid.  I did a little asking around, and
came up with a density of yeast cells of about 1 million cells per
microliter of slurry.  That would make the volume of 300 billion cells to
be 300 ml or about _ten_ ounces.  My hb supplier says that White Labs uses
a "slow speed" centrifuge at 1200 g's to compact the yeast w/o injuring it.
1200 g's doesn't sound like "slow speed" to me, and I still don't think
you can get 10 ounces of yeast slurry into a one ounce vial.  Or am I all
wet here?


Next, the info sheet claims you can pitch the contents of the vial into 5
gallons of wort w/o making a starter.  While, you are undoubtedly getting
more viable yeast than w/ a swelled pack of Wyeast, I can't believe that
the amount of slurry in that vial is equivalent to the cup or so of thick
slurry I'm used to pitching.  One person claims that pitching right out of
the vial netted him an eight hour lag period.  Better than the 24-36 hours
one might get from Wyeast, for sure, but when I pitch a cup of slurry I get
about a 2-4 hour lag before visible signs of active fermentation.


Using the widely accepted pitching rate of 5 x 10^6 cells/ml of wort for
middling gravity ales, if the White Labs vial did indeed have 300 x 10^9
cells, then there'd be enough yeast for about 15 gallons of wort (at 100
percent viability), So, why an 8 hour lag time?


Lastly, the info sheet says that for best results, the yeast should be used
within fours weeks of packaging.  Yet, the package isn't dated. So I'm at
the mercy of a HB retailer who may or may not have my best interests in
getting a fresh product in mind when he sees dollars slipping away with
every passing day the product sits in his fridge.


I'm skeptical.  Have any of you used White Labs Yeast w/ or w/o a starter?
What are your experiences? What do you yeast guru's think?

Subject: War of the Worts - Judges needed!


Response to the War of the Worts contest, Jan 18th, has been
overwhelming, we have at least 320 entries, far more
than we imagined possible.  The organizers appreciate
the response, but it leaves us with one problem:


     !!!!  WE NEED JUDGES !!!!


- -If you've signed up already to judge, thank you and please
be sure to attend.


- -If you're a BJCP judge and in the greater Philadelphia area,
why haven't you signed up ?!


- -If you're down in the Washington area, we have ONE judge coming
from there, where are all the rest of you?


- -If you're the organizers out on Staten or Long Island that want
ME to come judge in YOUR contests, hey, the turnpike has lanes 
going in both directions! It's only an hour or so from NYC.


- -Where are the judges from Northern NJ?


We provide all stewards and judges a hot lunch, a souvenir 
pint glass, and hopefully a good time at one of the best brewpubs
in the area.

Subject: line cleaning


Running idophor is not enough to clean lines. I clean lines for bars
and pubs using line cleaner. You would be shocked at the amount of crud,
slime and stone that builds up in the lines and tap heads even the light
beers!. I dissassemble all fittings and brush clean them and flush the
lines for 15 minutes with line cleaner followed by a couple of fresh
water flushes. After flushing a few times with fresh water I lubricate
all rubber seals with a very light coating of "Petro Gel" a food grade
lube that is tasteless and impervious to water. Then I reassemble the
whole thing and test for leaks. I perform this about every 8-10 1/2 kegs
or a minimum of every 30 days. If you have a hard time finding line
cleaner I can send some to you. With corney kegs I recomend a
dissasembly of the in and out fittings and scrub the springs and tubes,
& lube the seals. Make sure you flush well with fresh water, line
cleaner is stong stuff.

From: Kyle Druey <kdldmd`at`lightspeed.net>
Subject: Crystal Malt and Wort Fermentability


How does the use of crystal malt effect wort fermentability and the final
gravity of the beer?
 
For example, if 100% pale ale malt is mashed at 151 deg F producing an OG of 1.050,
the wort will contain 71% fermentable sugars (using Fix's numbers) and the final
gravity = {((1 - 0.71)X50)/1000} + 1.0 = 1.014.  However, what is the final gravity of
the beer if the grist is composed of 90% pale ale malt and 10% crystal (40 deg L)
by weight?
 
I read somewhere (HBD?) that only 50% of the sugars from crystal malt are fermentable.
If this is true, the final gravity for the above example would be:
 
malt       % of grist   % fermentable sugars
- --------   ----------   --------------------
pale ale          90%                   100%
crystal           10%                    50%
 
final gravity = {{50 - {0.71 X [(0.9 X 1.0) + (0.1 X 0.5)] X 50}} / 1000} + 1.0 = 1.016
 
Maybe this isn't such a big deal to some, but I sure would like to know how the crystal impacts
the final gravity.  Any insights here?

Subject: RE The perpetual fermenter


Ken's late night conjecture on the perpetual fermenter actually
dredges up an old thread.  For those of you old enough to
remember the "Beer in Spaaaaaaace" thread, this issue
came up in the "Beer Cell."  This involved borrowing
technology from fuel cells and applying it to brewing
in a microgravity.  Yeast slurry in one end and wort
in the other then beer and CO2 from the center of the
reaction cell.  Some engineer wanted to actually
design it using selectively permeable membranes, but
then the thread petered out.  It occurs to me that a
tank to tank gravity driven fermenter would be easy.
Akin to the three tier breweries advertised in the magazines.

Subject: Newbie question


Hello fellow homebrewers,


My wife and I have just begun trying our hand at homebrewing. Our
first batch is fermenting merrily away as I speak [pause for
applause]. After this run, I have a couple of questions:


1) We're talking about getting a new stove. The one we have is an
ancient (and I do mean ancient) built-in electric. We were weighing
the positives and negatives of gas vs. electric. One of my concerns is
whether or not the newer electrics can put out enough power to boil
large amount of fluid (read: for brewing). This old electric had all
it could do to keep our water boiling. It would be easiest and
cheapest to get an electric, but I wanted to get the opinion of the
experts. FWIW, I would eventually like to get into all-grain brewing,
but that's a ways down the road.


2) When we were making this first batch I got to wondering. Most
people say to boil the extract in 1.5-2 gallons of water and put the
remaining amount in the carboy. Fine and dandy. But how do you get
that water sanitized? It seems like it would be infection-city. We
only did a 3 gallon batch this time so we just boiled the whole thing,
but it will be an issue next time (especially if this one turns out
well!). I read something saying to boil it the day before and put it
in a container in a fridge or something, but how then would you keep
it from being re-infected?


One nice thing about being up here in the "frozen tundra" of northern
Wisconsin is that the barely positive temperatures and abundant snow
hills make excellent wort chillers!


Thanks for the help!
  Matt

- --_[INTERGATE-SMTP162865937]_
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"




I have a bit of a dilema concerning slow to no carbonation heppening in   
the bottle. I wanted to share my observations and see if anyone had any   
suggestions or had experienced this same problem.


I brewed a brown ale back on Dec 9 that I racked to the secondary on Dec   
15. I didn't get around to bottling until the 5th of Jan (Three weeks in   
the secondary). Now two weeks later, the beer, in the bottle, has yet to   
carbonate. None of my previous batches (approximately 20) have taken this   
long to carbonate. I don't know what happened. I used my standard priming   
procedure 3/4 cup corn sugar.


I have three theories on why this happened.
1. The majority of the yeast settled out in the secondary and there isn't   
enough left to carbonate
2. Somehow some residual bleach remained in the bottling bucket and   
killed the yeast (the beer doesn't have any bleach flavors at all,   
though)
3. I forgot the corn sugar all together (VERY unlikely)


Now what should I do? I am comfortable waiting for a while yet to get   
carbonation. If no carbonation comes what are my options?


Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in   
advance. Private e-mails are welcomed.

Subject: SUMMARY - Brew Your Own Magazine


Thank you everyone for your great responses.  The HDB is alive and kickin'


Anyway, I just wanted to summarize for everyone what the consenses was
from all of the emails I received (thank you!).


Most of the people liked BYO.  However, most people did not really use it
for any technical contect, mostly interesting articles at a good value.
People said that they read it in a day as oposed to others magazines
(such as Zym and BrewingTechniques) which took much longer.


Also, about 1/2 the people who wrote me recommended Brewing Techniques
very very highly.  It is a different audience than BYO, but very good.
Brewing Techniques apparently is a technically oriented magazine, as
opposed to BYO which is a much higher level, beginner oriented magazine.


The best advice was to just buy both.


My decision was to subscribe to Brewing Techniques and in a month or two
maybe subscribe to BYO (Getting married sure costs a lot of
money...limited brewing funds!).


Thanks again for all your help!

Subject: Summary heating mash


First, I would like to thank all who answered my questions about my brewery
design.  As I suspected, I am not the first to think of this design. Others
have been using it successfully for some time. 


The thread from last years digests regarding heat tranfer of mash pumped
through a pipe surrounded by water heated by an electric element (Ken
Schwartz and Charlie Scandrett I believe) motivated a few folks to try
their hand at this. 


I guess to make it somewhat short, it works and it works well. Those I have
had conversations with say that there are no ill effects and much to the
contrary, the wort is easily heated and there is no scorching to speak of. 


The ideas to come across my email are:


Keep the wort flowing fast enough through the coil to prevent too long of
contact between heat and enzyme-laden wort. Don't want the little beasties
being denatured.


Make sure that your pump is of sufficient power to pump all the liquid
(somewhat viscous) through all the tubing in the heating coil. Also, make
sure the id of the tubing is at least 3/8" to allow unrestricted flow. 


Once the mash is at temperature and stable, recirculating can stop. Running
the wort through recirculation can couse heat loss if tubing is not
properly insulated. And there really is no need.


The temperature of the water bath should not approach boiling. It is
probably good to keep it at or around normal sparging temps. That way there
will be no need to change it for those that decide to use the water bath
water. Ready made sparge water. 


Monitor temps and keep an eye for when to back off on the heating cycle.
This will be done manually in my system as I don't want to get into mov's
or pump speed controllers. Best places to watch temps, inlet of mash tun,
outlet of mash tun, body of mash, body of water bath. Watching the inlet
and outlet of the mash tun will let you know what the temp delta is going
through the coil. 


Have fun. Most important part of brewing often overlooked. I think Keith R.
was right, sometimes we can't see the forest for the trees. Do what is
necessary and enjoy the fruits of your labor. 


I will have most of what I come up with on my web page at sometime in the
future. I want to build the system and then work on that. Can't do too many
things at once ;-)


Cheers,
Bill

Subject: Re: DWC Aromatic vs Special B (Tom Gaskell)


In the recent HBD, Charley Burns asks about the difference between DWC's 
Aromatic Malt and their Special B:


> I went to buy some Belgian Aromatic and the homebrew shop owner said 
> that it's the same as Special-B and sold me some.


As George Carlin once remarked, "Au contraire, mon frere!"


Aromatic is a more highly kilned version of Munich, and will produce wonderful, 
but subdued (when compared to decoction mashed German Munich), malty aromas 
and flavors, even when infusion mashed.  I suppose that if you really wanted to, 
you could use a large proportion of Aromatic in the grist; maybe up to 30%.  If 
my brain hasn't flushed it, I believe that the color is about 26^L.  It has some 
diastatic power (enzymes), enough to convert itself, but it is minimal.


Special B is a whole 'nother ball game.  It is a crystal malt (no enzymes) that 
is highly kilned to a color of about 120^L, or more.  In small quantities, it 
lends a reddish color to the wort, and a raisiny, caramel sweetness.  With 
Special B, tread lightly, in grist percentages over about 3 - 5%, its character 
can be overwhelming.


Special B is delicious to eat, right out of the bag!


Personally, I am a big fan of both of these malts, but I am very careful 
not to confuse them.  There are BIG differences!


I will reserve comment on my opinion of your local shop owner.

Subject: Priming with Liqueur


I've been reading through some of the brewing books I got for Christmas and have found that two of them suggest  
using Liqueurs as a way to prime a fruit beer, or any other flavor for that matter.  Both books said a 750ml bottle is  
enough to prime a 5 gallon batch, and only increase the alcohol by 1%.  Has anybody out there tried this before?   
How did it work out?  I got this crazy idea to do a chocolate porter primed with Creme 'de Menth.

Subject: More on Husk material


Top of the morning to ye all,


Husk material in your beer can cause your beer to be astringent.  This is
what I have been told when I talk about properly crushing the malt with
a Corona.  Some folks have expressed a concern that you would
fracture the hush thereby adding more husk material to the wort.


When I stated that more husk material could wind up in the wort when
you have poor mash efficiencies this same person couldn't see anything
wrong with adding more malt to the mash.  In fact he gave a reference
to  no sparge brewing as his justification. The problem with this
argument is that the mash in a properly conducted no sparge mash has 
a pH of about 5.3, well below the pH that would easily extract tannins
from husk material.  Guess that argument doesn't hold water.  


If you brew two beers where everything is the same except for the
amount of grain, then the beer that has the most grain will have the
most husk material in the wort.  And as  I  have been told many times
this is not a good thing.  


There are a number of way that the amount of husk material  can be
reduced in a mash.  but as it really isn't of concern should I trouble
myself with this.  Yes if I want to brew great beer.

well, i don't brew in the summertime, so i have no summertime data to draw
upon, but i have never had infection problems using 2 gallons of headspace air.
i guess my air must be cleaner than al's.


despite this, i'm moving to filtered air for more aeration, in addition to
the 2 gallon headspace shaking method.  i need more air.  i'm debating
putting together a flotation tank.


question:  i have some kegs, and i was cleaning one out last night, and i 
took the gas fitting off and disassembled it, removing the little gas "dip"
tube and the poppet valve.  i had to press on the head of the poppet valve to 
get it to come out of the fitting.  


after i cleaned the fittings/pieces, i put them back together and installed the
fittings/lid back on the keg, so i could shake some cleaning solution around
inside the keg.  i noticed liquid was leaking from the gas fitting, from the
poppet, so i cranked the fitting down with my wrench to tighten it even 
further.  this stopped the leak, but upon disassembly, i noticed the little
"legs" of the poppet valve (which fell out of the fitting easily this time),
were slightly damaged.  i had tightened the fitting down so much that the 
legs had gotten pinched and twisted in the threaded parts of the fitting/keg.


my questions are:  what do i need to do to get this leaky poppet valve situation
rectified?  are the poppet valves supposed to sit up even higher in the fitting
so that the little legs don't get damaged by massive tightening?  should i
use more o ring gaskets on the gas tube?  when reassembling the poppet valve
and fixture, do you just put the poppet valve in place loosely and expect the
top of the gas tube to push it up into its proper position, or are you 
supposed to "jam it" up in the fixture somehow so the little legs are up and
out of the way of the threaded part of the fixture?


also, this happened on one of my kegs with a plastic gas tube (the little tube
that extends an inch or two down into the tank).  some of my
kegs have metal gas tubes.  does this make a difference?  is metal better? 
does a metal tube keep the little legs of the poppet valve from getting damaged
when threading the fixture on?

Note that for extremely thick mashes of column 1 there is a drop-off
in the amount of maltose produced compared with column 2 - normal mash
thickness.  I find M&B Sciences statement that beta-amylase is more
effective in thick mashes a bit hard to justify by comparing column 1
and 2.  Comparing columns 2 & 3 (normal and somewhat thin mash) there
is a drop-off in maltose at the intermediate mash temperature of 150F
for thin mashes.  It is possible that this trend continues for very
thin mashes of say 2 to 3 quarts per pound - in which case the
statement has justification.  I understand that some traditional
decoction mashes used thin mashes around 2.5 qts / pound.


As far as proteases are concerned, check the soluable nitrogen figures
above.  Nitrogen (mostly from  protein) is greater for the thicker
mash at every temperature, and very much greater for the thick mash at 
140F.  Having said that, M&B science notes that despite previous
assumptions, quite a bit of nitrogen is soluabilized in the mash for
even pale ale malt due to the action of carboxypeptidases which can
survive higher temperates that the endo- and exo-peptidases of the
traditional protein rests.


If you want extra soluable protein for body, a thick mash rest at
55C-62C/131F-143F should help considerably.

George De Piro writes ..

M&BS and several other sources indicate that a rolling boil is
necessary for good flocculation.  pH is also critical for good
flocculations. YMMV.


George also writes ...
>     Can anybody think of some reasons that it would harm the wort to heat

I take it hops haven't been added and that a 60+ minute boil takes
place the following day ?  The DMS issue isn't so much the temp at
which it boils off as its rate of formation at these higher temps.
[BTW - there's an obvious error/typo in Fix's PoBS book in his kinetic
formula for DMS formation - a first order kinetic reaction doubles
roughly every 10C not every 100C at 'reasonable' temperatures].


I think the biggest risk is the chance that additional aeration and
oxidation will take place, a form of HSA.  If you leave the lid off,
DMS will be lost, but aeration is potentially much higher.  With a lid
on a vast amount of DMS is trapped and may be difficult to eliminate.
Even with a lid, because the wort is constantly cooling overnight, it
will be difficult to exclude air from the kettle.  You could bubble
CO2 thru the wort overnight, but now the cure is worse than the
disease.


George frequently appears in the 'winners circle' and is a first rate
brewer so I'm certain he has a good handle on DMS flavors as well as
subjective evaluation of these beers.  I'd be interested in knowing
how the 'shelf life' and staling or other HSA related properties of
these beers stands up to other more typical homebrews.  George ?


My instinct would be to cool the wort to <90F and seal it.  Then boil
the next day.  This method has the potential for infections and other
problems too, but DMS and HSA aren't among them.

Charles asks in HBD 27,


        I'm interested in a discussion.... Wyeast 1968 and 1318...


I used 1968 when it was called ESB and loved it. I used 1318 and hated it. 
It would not flocculate and took fffffooooorrrreeeeeevvvvveeeerrrr to 
finish. I then tried the 1968 AFTER the name change and low and behold, 
acted just like the old 1318. Bummer. I may try it again, because I've heard 
other people like the 1968, but I will NOT try 1318 again.


My $.02 worth, YMMV.

        Heres a porter recipe i'm working on, appreicate any comments...


My first response was, hmmmm, Belgian Aromatic, what a great idea.


My second response is, 61 IBU's is well above the [proper] range for a 
robust porter. Third, where do you get fuggles at only 3.2 %aa? Lowest I've 
seen is 4.5. Becareful that these numbers are what you can actually buy, and 
not what got left in the SUDS database from wherever.


My preference for a Porter is Scottish Ale Yeast (can't remember wyeast #, 
17something). It leaves it a bit sweet which will balance the high alcohol 
content in the thing. You might not achieve a FG of 1.016 unless the mash 
temp is a little higher, more like 156F.


I'm saving this recipe because it looks really good, ingredient wise, just a 
little too bitter for my personal taste. Please report back on how it turns out.

stating that they (as do I) regularly decoct munich and vienna malts.
Perhaps the problem is the source of the malt.  One widely distributed
US maltster uses 6-row barley for every malt except one labeled as
2-row pale.  I can imagine that a decoction from it's 6-row munich or
6-row crystal might turn out badly.


Brian - whose colored malts did you decoct ?

Subject: Motorizing a PhillMill


Greetings all,


I'd like to ask some advice regarding motorizing a PhilMill. A few 
weeks ago I thought I'd try to motorize my PhilMill by attaching my 
drill to the crankshaft of the mill via a bolt with the head cut off 
(exactly as per the directions that came with my PhilMill). Without 
any grain, the mill ran nicely. The minute I added any grain, whammo, 
it stoppped dead. The mill ceased turning via the drill whether I 
added a few grains at a time or whether I had the hopper full. 


Now, I am a bit embarassed to say that I am not very mechanically 
inclined (Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor I am not), but I have heard that 
these mills can be automated using an electric drill. I have  Sears 
Craftsman 3/8' variable drill (3.0 amp/ 0-2500 rpm). Is this drill not 
powerful enough? What am I doing wrong? Not only did the mill not turn 
using the drill, I had one hellofa time getting the bolt back out! I 
felt like such a putz. If there are any of you out there with 
motorized PhilMills, I'd love to hear from you.


TIA for the advice,

Subject: Vienna Malt - highly modified?


I thought Vienna Malt was highly modified and would not require a protein 
rest. However, I picked up a recipe for a marzen that calls for 9+ lbs of 
vienna, plus some other stuff, and the recipe calls for a *double decoction* 
mash. Am I in for trouble on this? Could I do a single decoction and get 
away with it tasting the same? Is the recipe bogus (came from CMIII)?

Special-B was also very tempting and I might try it in another batch.

This will be my second run with this recipe. The first had 90 IBU's, which
I admit was a little over the top. I expect it to be very drinkable in 2-3
years! <grin> I'm afraid the Biscuit and Aromatics will tend to give me a
very strong malt profile, so I'm trying to balance it with Brown Malt,
Chocolate, and Hop bitterness. If you notice, I haven't used Black Patent
or Roast; I want to stay well away from a Stout-ish taste.

Nope, that's what I got in the freezer -- for some reason I just can't seem
to get European hops in the higher range in Montreal.

I'll probably replace the 40L Crystal with 1kg+ Carapils to get more
mouthfeel and less colour. I'd like a dark ruby red, but the Aromatic,
Biscuit, and Brown Malt are making this difficult. :-)

The first one at 90 IBU was a little too bitter. :-) I also used Munich
Malt which gave just a hint of maltiness, but not enough, which is why I
went for the Aromatic and Biscuit in this one. I've heard Special-B is also
quite good in Porters too.


My first batch was mashed at 150F and gave an FG of 1.020. I'm still
puzzled by that one.... :-)


Thanks for the interest!

Rick Gonterak asks about motorizing a PhilMill


I use a 3/16 hex bit from a cordless screwdriver chucked up into my Craftsman
3/8 0-1200RPM drill which I insert into the shoulder screw socket.  I have a
large 12" funnel that I drop into the 2-liter soda pop bottle.  Then I get
the drill running while my wife fills the funnel.  This seems to meter the
grains into the "crusher" a little better and my drill has more than enough
oomph do do the job.  Can usually mill enough grains for a 5 gallon batch in
under 5-minutes.  Be warned though, motorizing this mill creates a tom of
dust!
