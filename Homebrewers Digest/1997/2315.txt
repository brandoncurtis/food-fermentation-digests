As an industrial training consultant, I've recently had the opportunity to
tour an operation where they make alcohol (rubbing and gasohol, not beer).
I was intially expecting that they did batch fermentations, but low and
behold they have a continuous flow set-up with 5 open-top,wooden fermenters
cascading from one to the other via gravity. Total fermentation time is 24
hours and they make about 60,000 gallons/day (don't quoute me on the
numbers). Since they distill this brew (made from the by-products of the
wood pulping process), they don't have to worry about contamination.
Another thing I thought was pretty cool is that they control O.G. by
running the liquour through an evaporator and boiling off the water.I only
got a tour, but may end up documenting the whole process eventually, so I
could post more in the future if anyone's interested.

Howdy folks.  


I have a 10 gallon stainless steel brewpot from Vollrath and I am considering,
based on some of your experiences, adding an Easymasher (tm) to it so I can
toss in whole hops and use them to filter the wort.  However, it brings up
several questions.  Can I drill the stainless without impacting the material,
or will the heat and friction change the molecular structure like the welding
that was discussed (mr palmer, are you out there?)  Also, if I mix whole and
pellets, at what ratio will I start seeing unacceptable clogging?


I've been trying a 25 minute protein rest lately for my ales, and I'm not
convinced the benefits (clearer beer) outweigh the cost (more time, less head
retention).  Should I blow off the protein rest and instead add irish moss?


What is with Wyeast American II 1272?  I can't get the stuff to sink into the
beer after primary fermentation.  I racked my beer into a 5 gal secondary
after 7 days, and I still got a airlock full of gunk when it started
fermenting again and formed an evil layer of foam rubber on top of my beer. 
Is there a secret to using this stuff?


Yesterday, the wind chill was -50 here in Wisconsin, which got me to thinking
about air cooling the beer.  What would be the formula for calculating cool
time for 5.5 gallons of wort from 212F to 70F in a cylindrical kettle with a
wind chill if -50?  My immersion chiller's hoses freeze at this temp, unless I
run it into the house, which means cracking a window in the bathroom, which
means....well, if your married, you can figure out the rest.

Yep, you got it Kevin, I never once attempted to sanitize the air. I filter
the air. How can anyone sanitize air?.


I certainly am no biologist, but my overall mental concept of air is that
air may carry dust, germs, whatever, as particles suspended about - but air
itself cannot be unsanitized.  It's just the scuzz in the air we want to
remove and we do that with a filter.


Now a simple analogy. Some people say they do not filter the air and their
beers never get infections. Well and good but consider this:


        I always clean my windshield before driving on the highway at nite.
        I haven't had an accident, but I still use my seatbelt anyway.


        I had a few beers at the monthly club meeting, drove home and never 
        had an accident, but now I have my wife drive me as a precautionary
        measure.


        I never got run over crossing the street but I still look anyhow.


So if anyone chooses not to filter the pumped air, fine. Hey, I really do
not mind. It's cool, man, but I do.


Happy Brewing

Subject: What's in a starter?


Further to my earlier posting about collecting live yeast from 2-3 day old 
krausen rather than the bottom of the fermenter, it started me thinking 
about the contents of a starter bottle.  If the starter bottle is a 
miniature fermentation tank, where are the most live yeast cells and how 
should they be harvested in order to maximize the growth of the yeast and 
hence the number of live cells that are eventually pitched?  My guess would 
be in the krausen (if there is one) and in suspension - good cells rising, 
bad ones sedimenting.  If this is so, is there any point in pitching the 
stuff which settles to the bottom?


Please forgive me if the answers to all this are well known to you'll.  If 
they are, can someone put me out of my misery and point me to the 
literature.

Subject: lagering question


i'm hoping to venture into lagers sometime soon, but i've got some
concerns about flocculation.  the last ale i did sat in secondary for
longer than i'd expected (didn't have time to bottle it), and it seems
that more yeast had fallen out than in previous batches.  the beer has
taken a VERY long time to carbonate in the bottle.  my concern about a
lager is that if it sits in secondary for 3 months or so, will so much
yeast fall out that i'll have a similar, or even worse problem with
the beer being really slow to carbonate in the bottle?


now, one interesting suggestion i got from the owner of a local
brewpub was to bottle the beer shortly after primary fermentation is
done, and keep the bottles cold for the 3 months or so of lagering.
ie: let the secondary fermentation and conditioning happen in the
bottles.  now, obviously i don't want two cases of exploded bottles,
so i guess i'd need to time the bottling really accurrately.  seems
like it's almost too risky.


another thought i had was to re-pitch some fresh lager yeast when i
prime the beer for bottling, then store the bottles cold while that
yeast ferments away the priming sugar to carbonate the beers.  seems
more reasonable.


so, am i just needlessly worrying myself about too much yeast dropping
out during the lagering?  if not, what have others done to solve the
problem of there not being enough yeast left for bottling?


thanks.

YUP, this is a down side.  However, here in San Diego, the yeast goes

I am not a yeast guru by any stretch of the imagination, but have had
excellent results with Chris's product.  The fact that it is so well
accepted by brewers here in the San Diego area is evident in that they
have a hard time keeping stock.  Chris does an excellent job and if
you want to contact him, I am sure he would be more than happy to
answer any of your questions.  He is a microbiologist by profession
and not a marketeer, so I am quite sure that any claims he makes are
accurate. 


All I do is to take the vial out of the fridge at 8am and pitch it
into properly oxygenated wort at about 3pm and by 5pm or 7pm at the
latest, I have bubbling out of my blowoff hose.  I am extremely happy
with the product and am among hundreds (if not more) of very satisfied
brewers here in San Diego using White Labs Yeast.  Chris is not a
Johnny-come-lately out to make a buck, but has been providing a very
limited distribution of his fine product locally to only two shops
(that his brother owns) until within the last year the clamor for more
wide distribution prompted Chris to branch out to other local shops
and then more wide distribution.  Not someone out to make a fast buck,
but someone drawn into the market because of demand for a high quality
product.


BTW, as much as I like Chris and have gotten to know him personally
through the local brewing community, I used his yeast for a year
before ever meeting him and was extremely satisfied as strictly an
anonymous customer.

I think it would be helpful to make a distinction between the "actual" truth
and a "practical" truth here.


Actual truth: If you pitch 'adequate quantities of healthy yeast' there is
no need whatsoever to oxygenate the wort.


Practical truth: A 'work-around' of sorts to pitching adequate quantities of
healthy yeast is oxygenating the wort, which compensates for inadequate
amounts of yeast. Since most homebrewers do not pitch adequate quantities of
healthy yeast, oxygenating is in order.


But I find something mildly oxymoronic about the concept of 'pitching
adequate quantities of healthy yeast into properly oxygenated wort.'
Oxygenating becomes necessary because we're pitching *inadequate* quantities
of yeast. If one pitches adequate amounts of yeast, the 'proper' level of
oxygenation is either none, or whatever helps a homebrewer relax.


Perhaps I'm picking a nit here, since the practical reality for most of us
is that it's generally helpful to oxygenate, and it's generally a pain to
step up the yeast like we really should. But practical truth has a way of
replacing actual truth in practice, and I'm not quite comfortable with that.


Perhaps I'm the only reader who felt, upon reading Keith's observations on
the anal retentive ways of many homebrewers, that his comments were
unwelcome and unnecessary. We're learning, and we each have our own ways,
and different things are important to different people. If we read or are
taught certain things that a more experienced brewer has learned aren't
really so important, and then repeat them, does that make us AR, or just
novices? Why is Keith so AR about my AR ways?


No attacks or flames intended here; nothing personal, Keith or Dion. Just
speaking my little old AR mind.


Stop by for a brew,

First, how does the HBD collective feel about WYeast Belgian Lambic?  Are

they've been sitting in my freezer.  They're 1994 crop East Kent Goldings.

Ken Smith's email back from UPS was interesting if not definitive in
UPS' willingness to handle beer.  Last year or so I had a similar
experience at my local UPS and went through several levels of management
before their headquarters stated that it was NOT against policy to ship
beer if sent to a commercial address such as a homebrew store but that
when sent to a residential address it must be signed for by an adult. 
It seems to me that UPS does in fact ship lots of beer: Beer of the
month clubs for example that are NOT in the states mentioned in Ken's
note shipped interstate to states NOT on the list as well the
potentially THOUSANDS of homebrew entries each year.  But why be
"honest" and claim the contents as beer?  Any other euphamism for "food
samples for analysis" will work and avoid confrontations and the spector
of what's allowable or not.  If asked, "just say no."

I hate to discourage you, but I would spend the extra money for the glass.
A batch of extract costs more than a carboy. Dump one batch and you'll
wish you had spent the money on a good fermenter. It all works out in the

I've got the same tap for my mini-kegs, and have been told that the CO2 may

start to drain as Tom describes.  The dealer where I purchased the tap suggests

Ken and Mark,
   I understood that this policy was in effect for commercial beer because
of laws governing interstate movement where alcohol taxes/licenses had not
been met. This has been a major headache for the brew of the month clubs.
However, you as a homebrewer do not have to abide by these same regulations
because you may share your homebrew with any guest (read friend in another
state) that you may desire. Being a private company, UPS certainly has the
right to refuse business from individuals for all legitimate legal reasons.
Homebrew is not a legitimate legal reason. In fact, I may ship a beer of
8%, 10%, 12% to a friend in a state that has a 6% alcohol limit (like NC)
and the federal government has no control over it as long as I don't
receive money for it, produce less than 200 gal each year (2 in household),
and ship to someone at least 21.
   Would the UPS refuse to ship me my Aunt Bea's famous Rum Cake at
Christmas because it has alcohol in it. I don't think so!
   I also ran into this problem once at a local UPS site but once I
explained that this package was not commercial beer and thus not subject to
federal regulations on the shipment of beer to another state, I was allowed
to ship the package.
   I did note that they required the adult signature label on the package.
I have absolutely no problem with this requirement. It meets the law that
ATF places on homebrewers (at least age 21).
   The reason that the four states listed have an allowance for shipping is
because these states have established reciprocal agreements on the
licenses/taxes. There is a mechanism to handle this interchange in these
state only for commercial beers. Again, homebrewed beer is NOT affected.

okay, here are my comments:  


most of you guys who pump air through your wort without using an air filter
are probably pumping a heck of a lot more than 2 gallons of air through it.
your wort effectively becomes a "filter" through which you pump gallons and
gallons of air, containing vast quantities of microbes and bacteria, according
to al.  my two gallons of headspace air contain "two gallons of air"'s worth 
of microbes and bacteria. 


if two gallons of headspace air contains more than enough contaminants to 
spoil a batch of al k's beer in the summertime, how are you guys keeping your
beer un-infected?  


al, how much yeast are you pitching?


this is going to be quite a lively debate, i can tell already.


brew hard,

Subject: Oxygen


In HBD V2 #32 Dion Hollenbeck mentioned using welding oxygen to oxygenate his
wort.  I have been looking into this and wondered if anyone had any estimates
of how much oxygen would be used to adequately oxygenate  a starter and ~10
gal. of wort?  The disposable tanks hold 1.4oz. of oygen, I think, and are
claimed to be good for up to 20 batches (presumably 5 gal.).  I am trying to
justify buying an oxygen tank and regulator instead of the disposable type
but wondered about the break even point.  Something about buying tiny tanks
and disposing of them bothers me.  I am no "save the trash dump" freak
but like the idea of a refillable tank if I can rationalize it.  I may just
do that by getting an oxy-acetylene outfit as I have wanted one anyway.
I have only priced a tank and regulator at one place and came up with ~$175
including some hose and fittings.  Where is a good place to look for this?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Dave Burley writes of krausening with 1-2 tbsp. malt extract plus 4 oz.
corn sugar with yeast from the secondary plus a little of the beer.  Why
not just prime with the corn sugar?  I can't see that the small amount of
malt extract adds anything and the yeast would seem to be unnecessary.  Also
he spoke of adding CO2 if the carbonation was not sufficient as he was priming
kegs.  Why prime a keg at all.  Forced carbonation should be sufficient and
undetectable from primed carbonation.  All that krausening sounds like a
lot of effort for nothing in this case.


There was also some discussion of beer line length and ID.  I have found 3/16"
I.D. line to result in excess (to me) carbonation with 2-3 feet of line for
a decent serving rate.  I have replaced my 3/16" lines with 1/4" line and
am much happier with the results.  My lines are all within the refigerator
so no warming occurs there to cause foaming.

Excellent idea Alex.  The first thought I had was storing a large
amount of yeast in sterile water.  I'm currently moving my yeast bank
to sterile water storage, and it seems to work very well.  The basic
idea is to add a small amount of yeast to a vial of sterile water w/o
adding any nutrients.  The yeast go dormant and remain viable for long
periods of time (how long depends on who you listen to, at least 6
months).  I wonder how much yeast per volume can be stored this way.
The main problem would probably be removing all of the nutrients from
your yeast cake to insure that the yeast go dormant.  Any more
experienced yeast ranchers with thoughts on this speculation?

Don't worry.
 
I put 1/2 lb. of flaked barley in EVERY batch and keep the stuff around
for months in a jar with no other preparation.  I don't think moisture
does anything negative to it at all.  I've kept the stuff around for
almost a year and it still tastes great (sometimes I eat it like oatmeal).
 
The reason I put it in every batch is that I've found that it increases
head retention in my beers (all grain) and doean't affect the flavor.


Got head problems?  Give flaked barley a try.
 
By the way, the only other standard ingredient of mine is to always
include 1 lb of malted wheat in every batch to aid in trub formation.
There are more glutens or proteins (whatever) that help the trub glom
together and fall out of solution during the cooling phase.  I then rack
off of the trub immediately prior to pitching the yeast.  I've found that
this improves the flavor of the beer (to remove the trub prior to
fermentation).

     Hi all,
     
     Lou asks why his lager didn't carbonate.  Al K. and I were discussing 
     this very problem here last month.
     
     Lou lagered his beer for 6 weeks at 34F (1.1C).  My guess would be 
     that the yeast is quite happily sleeping because of the cold storage.  
     I would also guess that if he racked carefully there isn't a lot of 
     yeast in the beer.
     
     If you warm the bottles to around 50F (10C) it might carbonate, but 
     because of the reduced number of active cells it may take a while.
     
     It is best to either kraeusen lagers, or force carbonate them (or 
     spund your unitank; you know who you are).
     -------------------
     Dr. Stone speaks of a local brewer that serves ale in as little as 8 
     days.  Some beers can be drunk that young, but many will improve if 
     aged longer than that.
     
     [RANT ON]
     Many small brewers are more concerned with $$$ than quality, and will 
     serve green beer as long as people will drink it.  This is a plague I 
     find all too common in many of the NY area brewpubs.
     
     Certain manufacturers of brewing equipment even tell prospective 
     customers, "10 days to ale, 21 to lager" (referring to the time from 
     brew day to serving).  This is generally ridiculous.  Unfortunately, 
     the owners of brewpubs are told this, and predict capacity using these 
     figures, and don't want to tie up tanks longer than they think is 
     necessary (lest they hurt the bottom line).
     
     I have made ales that are passable in 2 weeks, but bottles that I have 
     aged longer are invariably MUCH better.  I have yet to brew a beer 
     that has peaked in 10 days!  Lager in 21 days?  Yeah, right.
     
     There is a big difference between "fresh" and "green."  Just my 
     opinion.
     [RANT OFF]
     
     As homebrewers, we can usually afford to be more patient and allow our 
     beer to mature to its full potential.  Patience is the key.
     
     Have fun!

I've had very good luck using molasses.  A few years ago, I brewed up a
Christmas ale that was based on a Cat's Meow recipe, but to which I added a
significant shot of molasses (sorry for the qualitative measurement, but my
log book is at home).  The flavor notes from the molasses melded quite well
with the light spicing that I added.  Since I didn't want anything getting
in the way of the molasses and spices, I used minimal finishing hops and
used the Wyeast #1056 yeast.


The one caveat to this is that I like molasses.  Indeed, in the winter, I'm
as likely to put molasses on my oatmeal as I am maple syrup -- but that's
what you get from spending some formative years in Memphis.

Subject: Air Filtration (Steve Potter)


My $.10 on the continuing aeration/filteration saga-


I have been reading with amusement the thread on air filtration. It seems
to me that most folks feel about sanitization the way they feel about sex-
if anyone is doing it differently than you, there has to be something
wrong with them.  8^)


There _is_ a practical (and easy) way to filter air as Ron mentioned.  It is
a syringe filter that can be put into the air line with luer locks.  To
purchase them retail costs about $3.50, but if you know how to shop
they can be had for less than $.50 each in quantity.  Some people feel
that you should change the filters after about 10 batches, other people
use one per batch.  In either case, I think it is cheap insurance.


As to why one would want to use one- it all relates Keith's original point
about pitching an adequate supply of yeast.  We both believe that
pitching enough yeast is critical for producing good beer.  This belief
leads me to culture yeast through multiple step-ups.  The quantity of
yeast produced is in large part a function of adequate aeration of the
starter.  It is in this step up process that the use of air filters is most
important.  I get downright anal-retentive (gee, does anal-retentive have
a hyphen? 8^) about all aspects of sanitization when yeast culturing
(can you say laminar flow hood?  I knew that you could ;^).)  It doesn't
take much contamination at this stage to cause problems later.  It really
does not matter how much yeast you pitch if it is already contaminated.


I do not believe that filtering pure O2 is a worthwhile activity and have
refrained from doing so since I switched from pumps to tanks.  Pure O2
from a tank and air pumped from the environment are fundamentally
different.  There are no beer spoiling bacteria that I know of that can
survive long in pure O2.  Oh would that that were true of air.  (In any
case, some regulators have a filter built into them where they attach to
the tank.)


The necessity of filteration may also relate to where you live.  I live about
two hours up I90 from Al.  Here in Wisconsin our summers are hot and
humid.  That, combined with the fact that I live 1/4 mile from a vineyard,
makes for air contaminated with wild yeast and assorted other beasties.
As usual YMMV.
