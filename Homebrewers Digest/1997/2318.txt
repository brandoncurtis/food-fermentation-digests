Hi,  Some time ago (read last year) there was some discussion regarding the
modifications to Gott coolers to use them for mashing.  I was wondering if
anyone had directions for this.  It involved removing the drain and replacing
it and there was also discussion regarding insulating the top with foam.


Also what is the price range for these coolers?  I haven't priced them yet but
plan on getting one soon.


Thanks in advance.

- -- [ From: Michael Gerholdt * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --


Dave,


While bowing to your knowledge which certainly is greater than mine in
certain areas, this puzzles me:


>> Why prime a keg at all.  Forced carbonation should be sufficient and
>>undetectable from primed carbonation.


>Well, I and a lot of other people believe that natural carbonation produces
a
>finer bead in the head and a better mouth feel.  That's why I do it.


David, once CO2 is actually and fully suspended in the beer then, if
conditions are the same, there should be absolutely no difference in how the
CO2 comes out of suspension based on how it got in there.


The idea that force carbonation produces "fish eye" bubbles and natural
carbonation produces a finer bead ... this can only be the case, can't it,
if the force carbonating homebrewer doesn't get the CO2 fully into
suspension (dispenses before it's really ready)?


If not, then how do you theoretically support the notion that all CO2 isn't
equal, other things being equal? What info does CO2 have that lets it know
it is either forced or primer-produced?


I think it's a momily.

I wasn't offended, Keith. Just thought the labeling of other homebrewers
anal retentive based on your opinion about the non-necessity of filtering
air was 'unwelcome and unnecessary.' Especially so when you now are willing
to be persuaded that filtering air might be beneficial.


>Actually, I don't even feel as strongly about filters as it sounded.  I

Everyone has his/her own methods. Disingenuousness is an interesting choice;
sort of devil's advocate sort of approach, hmm?


>I am enjoying the conversation regarding air filters and anal retentive (AR
) brewing >methods in general. 


The AR bit is old before it starts; but I agree on the filtering discussion.
It's helpful, and it is good to learn that it's as easy and cheap as using
some sterile cotton and a plastic syringe or two. Nothing to AR about that.


I used an aquarium pump once, no filtering, and I had an infected batch that
time around. Might not have been from the air. Might have been some stuff
living in the used pump from a home that has animals running around. Or
something else. Don't know. I haven't pumped air since. Working instead on
keeping a good steady supply of adequate amounts of yeast on hand.

The facts as I know them: seen on video (Beer Hunter, I believe) were
open, ground level windows in a Belgian brewery (could have been abbey,

Jeremy, it takes more than filtering.  Once you remove the particles,
you have to keep new ones out.  Hence isolating the people, putting
positive pressure in the room so the breezes are always out, etc.
Again, the point...it's very hard, albeit possible to sanitize air.
Indeed, as you point out, for our purposes most air is probably sanitary
enough to cool and oxygenate, and for the anal, get a fliter.

hi all,


I'm trying to calabrate my brewing software (HBRCP by J. Varady).
I keep making ales that are on the very hoppy end of the scale but
but continue to get comments about how they are not bitter enough.
Does anyone have an idea about the correct percent usage for hops
( a function or table of time/ % usage ) I'm using ~30% for 60 min
down to 5% for 0 min additions. All help welcome.

Subject: RE: Koelsch yeast


Hello Dave,
first: I don't brew myself - I tried it once, but as here (Germany) beer is 
cheap and good, it's not worth while. I make fruit-wines, mead, liqueurs and 
things like that.
I live nearby Cologne, and Koelsch is the beer I usually drink. It's a protected 
name; only breweries in or nearby Cologne are allowed to call their beer 
Koelsch, we've got about 20 breweries in Cologne. In fact, I've just opened a 
bottle of "Frueh-Koelsch", one of the best! I've visited some of the Cologne 
breweries.
In general, there are two types of yeast: "obergaerig" (saccharomyces 
cerevesiae) and "untergaerig" (saccharomyces carlsbergensis), with different 
types in both of them. I didn't find "obergaerig" and "untergaerig" in the 
dictionary, sorry, it means something like "upper fermentation" and "lower 
fermantation". There are two big differences between both types: 1. Temperature 
of fermentation 2. Wether the yeast goes on top or to the bottom during 
fermentation.
1. obergaerige yeast works best from 18 to 24 C(about 70F?), untergaerige from 6 
to 10 C( up to 50F?).
2. obergaerige yeast goes to the top of the liquid and is taken away from there 
(commercial breweries don't wait till it dies and sinks to the bottom, 'cause 
that would give a bad taste), while the untergaerige goes to the bottom.
In the past, most of german beer was obergaerig, only in winter they brewed 
untergaerig - except in Bavaria: they put lots of ice into their cellars in the 
winter, so it was cool all the year. Last century, Mr. Linde invented the 
refrigerator (first tried it in the Munich brewerie of Mr. Sedlmayr in 1873), 
and since that time, untergaerige beers became more familiar in germany. Now, 
most of the beer here is untergaerig (pils, export, bock etc.), only some 
regional specialities are obergaerig (koelsch in Cologne, alt in duesseldorf, 
weizen in Bavaria, weisse in Berlin).
Koelsch is a light beer, it's got about 4,8 % alcohol. You can buy it in 
bottles, but it's best in kegs (10, 20 or 50 liters). If you buy it in kegs (for 
a party, f.e.), you normally don't use any CO2 equipment or anything like that - 
you just have to empty it the same evening, it's very familiar here!
If you ever happen to come to Cologne, tell me early enough, I might show you 
some really nice pubs!
Eckard

In reference to drilling stainless, the most important things to 
remember are 1) use a good drill bit (I used just a good quality 
hardened steel bit)  2) keep the bit well lubed (I used Kool Tool, a special 
synthetic cutting fluid, but any decent oil should be ok, and 3) keep 
constant pressure on the work! If you back off the bit, you can 
work-harden the surface, making it even harder to cut. A drill press, 
with an assistant, is the best way to do it. If no drill press is 
available, an assistant and steady pressure on the drill should work.


Also, measure twice, cut once! Make absolutely certain the hole is in 
the right place, as you only get one shot. I drilled my Duraware 10 
gal. kettle, and it was a traumatic experience for sure. Came out 
fine, but just be sure to do it right.


BTW, the drilling advice came from the guy who runs the model shop 
where I work, and it worked for me. Metalurgists may have other 
views.

I don't know what you have to pay for CO2, but if I had to pay that much,
I'd only be able to carbonate about 5 kegs per 5 pound CO2 tank. I think
the last time I refilled my tank it was about $8 or so. I consider CO2
cheap and use it liberally for many things.... To flush carboys and kegs, 
to push iodophor from one keg to another, to push some of my beers through
a filter, and whatever else I feel like using it for. Oh, of course
carbonating my keg beer and dispensing it. Just my CO2 cents.

smaller bits 1/8" or 3/16" would be good sizes. First step is to figure
out where you want your hole then lightly center punch it. Hit the punch
just hard enough to put a small dimple in the steel. The second step is
to drill a hole with your small drill bit using the center punch dimple
as a place to start (this will keep your drill bit from "walking")and
you can use WD-40 or clean motor oil as a lube. Thirdly use the 3/8" bit
on the smaller hole. Last step, using new sandpaper carefully remove any
sharp edges of the hole and then clean the pot and install your new easy
masher.


When drilling SS use a heavy feed and little speed (press down hard and
turn the drill bit at a slow speed).


Hope this helps

HELP,
I threw 2 Cups fresh wort on top of a slurry-maybe 1 1/2 cups? in a
1.5liter wine bottle tonight in prep. for tomorrow's brewday it's maybe
2/3 EMPTY and it is now blowing out the airlock quite nastily. Do I
leave it and assume positive pressure will keep out bugs? Is this a sign
of infection? Mutation? Can I pitch this? EEK!

They have given you reasonably good advice. However, I would do it as a 2
step 
process by drilling a smaller 'pilot' hole first. 


This will do 2 things of benefit; first it will stop the large drill from
skidding
on the smooth, hard surface, and second, a well chosen pilot hole size will
allow 
the bigger drill's cutting edges immediate contact with the steel thus
reducing 
friction.
 
I'd suggest around 3/16" should be right but I'm used to working in metric.
To get it
more accurate, look at the 3/8" drill, note the point is not really a
circular point 
but is an 'edge', your pilot hole should be just slightly larger than the
'point'.
(If you're confused I'll send you a drawing).


Also, the main benefit of a cobalt tipped drill is less friction thus it
keeps it's 
edge longer.

Subject: Force carbonation


Two quick questions:


1.  If I want to force carbonate my beer at 30 PSI, how long would it take at 
45 degrees F. ?  35 degrees?


2.  Once its carbonated, and I wanted to leave it hooked up for dispensing, I 
assume the carbonation would slowly go down if my dispensing pressure was 4 - 
6 psi (thats all I need).  Is there any solution other than relasing pressure 
and then re-pressurizing every time I want a beer (say once every few days)?


Thanks for the info.

  Anyone out there have a good Oktoberfest style beer recipe?  I'm fairly
  new at this but have progressed past wanting to use kits to brew with.  I
  don't have lagering capabilities as of yet so will be aging at the low
  end of the ale spectrum.  I can also secondary ferment (both in glass)
  and have chilling capabilities.  I prefer an extract recipe since I don't
  have mashing capabilities either.  I do intend to use yeast obtained from
  my preferred beer at the local microbrewery.


  It appears that most of you have been doing this for years and maybe I'm
  getting ahead of myself, but I wish to quickly progress into better than
  average beers, and not the typical Heineken, etc. clone.


  Thanks for the input.  You can respond directly to Mark_Snyder`at`wmx.com.

Subject: 1338 European Ale cold ferment


A few HBD's back, George De Piro and I exchanged initial observations of
apparent good fermentation when using Wyeast #1338 at 56F, well below the
recommended fermentation temperature.  I racked to secondary yesterday, and
am now questioning how well things went.


OG for the wort was 48.  I pitched an active 350 ml starter, and the batch
was aerated with 2 x 15 second blasts of O2 through a 2 micron stone. The
batch formed a nice krausen and had settled down after about 5 days.  There
was still a lot of yeast in suspension (only about 3/4" on the bottom), but
no obvious airlock activity or krausen.


I racked on day 7, and the SG was 20 (expected 14).  Looks like the yeast
may have pooped out due to the low temperature.  I have moved the secondary
up from the basement to get a 65F ambient.  The beer began to fall bright
overnight at this temperature, so this morning I swirled to rouse the yeast
and got some outgassing through the airlock.  I suspect the outgassing is
just CO2 that is no longer soluble since the temperature went up.


Any suggestions on what to do if I can't get the SG down where I expect?
Should I pick some fresh yeast?

actual truth - who knows - do what works best for you in your brewery.
i for one do not know of any brewery (commercial) that does not aerate in some 
fashion.  and speaking from my own experiences (over 500 brews in the past
4.5 years - commercially), i can atest to M.B. Raines statements in the latter
part of the Sunday 19th HBD.. low air even with nice pitching qty, resulted
in (with our house yeast and wort composition) long ferments (over 4 to 5
days for ale
at reasonably normal ale temps of 68F - time was closer to 7 to 10 days
actually) 
and loss of attenuation by several degrees Plato - not good.  these were
considered
defective fermentations and the yeast was sewered and not repitched.
on a well aerated wort with similar pitch - 3 days - all done. harvest on day 7
and repitch right away....the yeast was healthy for over 100 generations
(about a year).


some yeast need tons of air (ringwood for example amoungst some other fine
british
true top fermenters) they recirc wort for a long period of time to keep it
in suspension and aerate. others do not need as much or so i have heard.
but it comes down
to one thing is the beer drinkable?  if you can make good drinkable beer without
aeration - do it but.....saying that there is no need to aerate/oxygenate -
i doubt this aspect...
that is like saying the water has nothing to do with making beer or pH does
not matter.
for some it does not - granted - but it is considered good brewing practice
to monitor
both (in addition to about 1000 other things also).


maybe all of us commercial brewers are wrong - i doubt that too....but i am
open to
hearing from your sources....




good brewing to all

Subject: Sanitation-Air filters/40F ferment/1338 data (G. De Piro)


     Hi,
     
     A lot has been said about the necessity of air filtration and the 
     degree of analness required for good sanitation.  I'd like to throw in 
     my .02.
     
     First, on air filtration:  I use an aquarium pump to aerate my worts.  
     I filter the air, but haven't always.  I haven't had a problem either 
     way.  I filter now because it really is easy, and why beg the 
     lightening to strike?
     
     On sanitation:  I feel that people can go too far (you don't really 
     need to wear masks and gloves when pitching your primary), but I think 
     that many people don't go far enough.  I believe it is especially 
     dangerous for beginners to read about the relatively maverick 
     practices of some advanced brewers.
     
     I judged a competition this past weekend.  Almost every entry (that I 
     judged) was infected to some degree!  There are different levels of 
     infection, and they can cause different problems.  At best, an 
     unwanted microbe will impart slight off qualities that may fade as the 
     open glass sits on your table.  A beginner may not even notice it.
     
     At worst, the beer will hit the ceiling when it is opened and 
     taste/smell horrible.  There is a wide range of possibilities between 
     these extremes.
     
     My point is that we all need to be very careful.  One reason that an 
     advanced brewer may get away with slacking off a bit (like not 
     filtering air) is that he/she is usually pitching a lot of healthy 
     yeast, aerates the wort, and has been very careful when stepping the 
     yeast up.  This TREMENDOUSLY reduces the risk of other bugs getting a 
     chance to mar your wort.
     
     Beginners hardly ever pitch or aerate adequately, and therefore must 
     be VERY careful about sanitation.
     --------------------
     Dckdog`at`aol.com asks why his fermenter is still.  He pitched rehydrated 
     "lager" yeast and has the fermenter at 40F (4.4C).
     
     First, I was under the impression that only ale yeasts survive the 
     freeze-drying process and therefore true lager yeasts are not 
     available in this form (this may be an outdated notion, though.  
     Anybody out there know better?).
     
     Secondly, 40F is a bit too cold, even for a true lager yeast.  45-50F 
     is better, and if it is really an ale yeast it should be over 55F, 
     probably even in the 60's.
     
     Also, you rehydrated the pack at 100F (~37.5C).  Did you then pitch 
     that into 40F wort?  You could shock the yeast doing that.
     
     Perhaps warm the wort and wait, or warm it and pitch again.
     ----------------------
     Just another observation about Wyeast 1338 (European ale).  My 
     fermenters hit 49F (9.4C) and the yeast is STILL going (although 
     slower than at 56F (13.3C).  I hope the weather warms up, I think I'm 
     really pushing the envelope on this one...
     
     Have fun!

Subject: Oxygenation, sea salt, yeasty beer


Brewsters:


Maribeth makes an excellent couple of points about oxygenation, which I will
paraphrase and modify a little.


 1) Under-pitching followed by  "excessive" yeast growth can lead to ester
formation under certain circumstances with certain yeast.


  2) Repeated use of yeast in sequential batches with no oxygenation results in
a degrading performance  (read high FG amongst others)  in successive batches.
This comment is substantiated by Kirin, as Maribeth says, and by M&BS in a quote
I provided some months ago. 


In my opinion it may be that 1) is related to 2). 


I accept these facts, but I have always been puzzled by the stoichiometry of it
all.


How can such a small amount of oxygen, which, in the presence of an active yeast
colony, lasts only a few minutes, have such a large effect on the outcome of the
yeast colony  and subsequent batches. Anybody?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------  
 Rod Schlabach asks:
> 
> Can anyone out there comment on the use of "sea salt".


My only comment is that I have read that iodized salt is good for your thyroid
but bad for yeasts. I don't know if this is true or not about its effect on
yeast, not having seen a professional report.  I would guess sea salt would have
a higher amount  of iodide than a more purified product like Morton's or such.
When I use salt for beer I use Non-iodized Morton's or Diamond Crystal salt.

I have never seen this unless you are pouring ALL  of the beer out of the bottle
and pouring the yeast on the bottom of the bottle into the glass.  In pouring
bottle conditioned beer ( which is what you have), if you want clear beer, pour
slowly, steadily and leave a small quantity of beer in the bottle.  For the
first few bottles put a piece of white paper on the table under where you are
pouring so you can see as the yeast cloud comes to the lip of the bottle and
stop pouring.


Some people like to drink the yeast in their beer, especially German wheat beer
(mit Hefe) drinkers, and some British Whitbread White Label ( a discontinued
bottle conditioned British Ale) drinkers of old used to swirl the bottle at the
end.


Live yeast causes gastric distress for some people, but brewer's yeast ( which
has been steam treated) is a valuable source of B vitamins as any vitamin bottle
will indicate.

John,
 Up until I went to Holland about a month ago and stayed about 2 miles from the 
Heineken brewery I would've agreed with you about Heineken being skunk beer. 
But after having tried it in Holland I would have to say that it is much 
different there. It's like comparing Guiness here to Guiness in Ireland. You 
can't really compare the two. But good point... Any Heineken I have tried here 
has been skunk beer and I can't imagine wanting to clone it. 


Cheers,
Bob

CNN has been running a "Women Brewers" spot featuring our own Maribeth
Raines. Karen B from the AHA is also in it. Welcome to your 15 minutes of
fame, Maribeth. (You are younger than I had imagined.)


The pitching quantity/aeration question is very timely. I just made a pale
ale with 1318 and pitched the cake into a Scotch ale (1075). I aerated with
an aquarium pump for 30 minutes and it started bubbling within 2 hours. I
worried about oxidation until I read Maribeth's article. Now I feel better.


As I was setting up the sparge bucket for the Scotch ale, I spilled some
170F water and suffered some 2nd degree burns on my neck. There is another
advantage to the no sparge technique. I'll let you know how the Red Neck
Scotch turns out.

Subject: Hose Length


Hose length gurus unite!  I have read previous threads about hose length 
and thought it to be a unique academic pursuit.  Then I kegged a batch 
of beer.  Hose length matters.  I can easily increase the hose length on 
my "picnic" faucet.  No problem.  The problem lies in the fact that I 
acquired a cold plate, faucet, cooler combo some time ago.  I only tried 
it one other time on my first kegged brew which never carbonated due to 
my own ignorance.  I now force carbonate.  My question relates to the 
relatively long distance the beer flows through while in the cold plate. 
 I don't have an exact measure, but suffice it to say, it's long.  How 
will this effect the beer at the tap?  Will I lose carbonation due to 
the long length?  Will it equilibrate?  The cold plate itself is what is 
cold.  The beer can be kept at higher temps (that's what these are for) 
but be dispensed colder.  Thus, no effect of "warming" in the hose will 
occur.  Anyhow, any brewers out there ever use one?  Any tricks out 
there?  I suppose you could fill a small refrigerator with a bunch of 
these rather than a big frige with a few kegs.  Sorry so long.  Private 
e-mail is fine and I can post a summary.

Subject: Yeast, Hops, and Weather


I've been reading this recent yeast/aeration thread with interest.  I think
it is useful to note that we do not all approach this topic from the same
perspective.


In seeking to improve our final product we homebrewers try to emulate the
practices of commercial brewers (in varying degrees).  As homebrewers we
are often brewing only periodically (ie 1 x month, 2 x month) and use our
raw materials to the best of our abilities.  Often we will brew once, and
use a re-cultured (or different) yeast strain for our next brew.


Yes, it is possible to pitch a sufficient amount of yeast to successfully
ferment a batch of beer without aeration.  If you are wishing to keep
re-pitching the same yeast (as breweries do) you will ensure that the yeast
is in optimum health, and that normally includes aeration in some fashion.


That we can homebrew without sophisticated aeration is really a bonus,
though my opinion (sorry, no facts here) is that aeration is a *good*
thing.


Now, what about First Gold hops ? I have a small quantity with which I'm
going to brew some pale ale, then use in conjunction with Northern Brewer
for a stout.  I'm interested in your opinions of this new hop, please
privately e-mail me with the a/a%, physical description, and end result in
your brew.  I suppose if these get popular we could use "Up the Dwarves" as
a cheer,  but it might get us some funny looks !


Finally, the weather.  Since I live in the "California of Canada" I have to
see if anyone can match our one day snowfall record in 1996.  On Dec. 29 we
had 64.5 cm of snow in a 24 hour period.  It's a lot even when you convert
to inches.  I have found that homebrew is essential when snowbound !!


Good Brewing.
