Mike Dowd remarked on his stuck sprge problems using Crips's Marris Otter
pale ale malt. 


I did a batch with Crisp Marris Otter recently and didn't note any unusual
qualities realtive to other UK pale ale malts. Whatever caused your
difficulties, I suspect it wasn't connected with the typical qualities of
this malt. Maybe you did get a bad batch of grain, though I'd think the
probability isn't high. 


IMHO, it seems your technique is not very well adapted to the equipment
you're using (kettle with EasyMasher). There's no great trick to getting a
good mash and lauter with this grain. Just dough in as you did, using
about 1.5 qts/lb so the mash is thin enough to mix without breaking your
arm or sucking in huge quantities of air. 


There's no need to hold the low-temp rest that you described. Just start
heating slowly to your saccharification temperature while stirring. Rest,
heat to mashout, and rest again. I don't see how you're liable to have a
problem with any pale ale malt that way. The long cool rest and thick mash
may be contributing to your lauter problems when using the EasyMasher.

HBD-
 
Did anybody else recieve HBD #33 before they got HBD #32?  Does anybody know
why?  Does anybody care?
 
Anyway, I've never used Wyeast 1968, although it sounds intriguing.  What if
you pitched to the primary as usual, then when racking to the secondary, allow
the beer to fall a good foot or so, splashing copiously into the secondary?
Goes against every brewing fiber of my being, but if it needs the extra
aeration...
 
I tried my hand at a no sparge dual brew session this weekend:
10# pale ale malt
5# wheat malt
Mashed in to 158F with four gallons of water (180F), and mashed for 2 hours.
The temp dropped to 140F, kind of a reverse step infusion mash.
Any comments on this technique (or lack of technique)?
I then added the mash to 2 gallons boiling water and drained the lauter tun.
That took a while, because I ground my wheat malt too fine.  I think I made
"maltcrete".  I then added three gallons back to the lauter tun and mixed it
up avoiding HSA as much as possible.  Eventually, I had to ladel out the
entire contents and clean my screen and add it back to get any flow.
Eventually, I ended up with:
1st brew: 4 gallons of 1.060 wort, bittered with chinook, flavored and
"aromaed" (I think I just made a new word- two if you count "maltcrete") with
hallertaur.  SG 1.050, inocculated with Widmer Bros "hefeweizen" yeast.
 
2nd brew: 2.5 gallons of 1.050 wort, bittered with chinook, flavored and
"aromaed" with cascade.  I added 2#s honey and 16oz of frozen concentrated OJ
to get a SG of 1.052, inocculated with Wyeast 1084.
 
I also canned 4 qts of third runnings for yeast starters.
 
Both hot worts were cooled using a newly "constructed" planispiral chiller:
I bought two 25 foot coils of 3/8 inch copper tubing, and after trying to bend
one into nice tight concentrically spiraling coils, I pretty much butchered it
up (even using a tubing bender).  The other coil, I just worked the existing
coil into smaller concentrically increasing spirals by hand.  I ended up with
a 25 foot coil with about a 3 inch wide open spot in the center that aint
pretty, but fits my kettle.  It cooled both worts (at different times) to 85F
from 190F in about 15-20 minutes.  No stirring.  Not bad.

Subject: manifold construction


I recently made a new manifold for my mash/lauter-tun by making a spiral
with 10 feet of copper
tubing and then cutting slots every couple of inches.  I spaced the slots
at closer intervals as I moved from the outlet to the closed end to try
and compensate for the obvious flow behavior (less flow into the tubing the
further away from the outlet you get).  


I tested the construction by filling my cooler with water and placing drops
of colored liquid in different locations as I drained the water.  I noticed
that there was hardly any flow into the manifold past the first few slots.


I was able to get 80% efficiency with the new manifold but still think the
design could be improved.  Any ideas?


I was thinking about making a single slotted loop with the copper tubing
around the I.D. of the cooler.  Then when running-off I could tilt the
cooler slightly so the flow at the bottom is towards first few slots in the
loop.  Seems like
this way I'd be able to get a little more extraction but I'm wondering if
tilting the cooler slightly will effect the flow through the grain bed. 
Any thoughts?

Scott Murman comments on my suggestion that being able to store large 
pitchable quantities of yeast for prolonged periods would significantly 
enhance our brewing endeavors:

I same thought passed through my mind when I read the article on distilled
water storage in the Brewery Technical Library. However, assuming this
technique works, I don't think it applies at the scale we are considering.
We can rinse the yeast and store it under sterile distilled water, but
this doesn't produce the same results as the technique you referred to,
which is basically uses little water vials as a replacement for slants. I
think the rinsed yeast probably needs reculturing after after a relatively
short period of storage. 


I still find myself very curious about the technique Noonan describes. As
mentioned, I can't quite imagine doing this at home with making a mess and
contaminating the culture, but here is an excerpt for those who don't have
the book: 


"The liquid above the yeast is decanted, and the yeast sediment is pressed
to remove at least all of the free liquid. The yeast mass is formed into a
ball, tightly covered with plastic wrap, placed in chipped ice, and
frozen...Yeast prepared in this manner may be stored for several months."

to be a bit messed up.  In the contents for #37, for example, only the
first seven items actually appear in #37, while the rest of the items
listed appeared in the previous issue (#36, which was dated Saturday but
didn't get to me until Monday...), while the three items listed in the

Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide describes this procedure for
harvesting yeast out of a fermenter for reuse. I believe he
writes about a 3 day primary fermentation where you harvest
from the 2nd day's skim of the head of kreuzen. The 1st and 3rd
day's skim you discard, as the yeast are either too young or
too old. (Refer to the book for exact details).

I didn't think that the yeasts on the bottom of the fermenter
were the yeasts that carbonated the finished beer. I thought it
was the yeasts still in suspension in the finished beer. Not true?
Aren't the yeasts in the bottom of the fermenter going through
autolysis?

Subject: drilling stainless


Hi Dan,


The cobalt drill bit is a waste of money IMHO. Here's what I've done in my
3-tier:


1. Decide where you want to place your EM and mark the spot. 


2. With a center punch, tap the center so there is a small dimple. This will
serve to start the bit. If you're good with a drill, this step is unnecessary.


3. Use a 1/8-in bit to drill a starter hole. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP! Ideally,
I'd recomend a double-ended stubby bit, but they're sometimes hard to find.
They're nice because they don't break as easily due to their short length,
and when they do break, you just flip it around and you have a fresh cutting
edge. Try to get your bit from a real harware store (and not someplace like
Home Despot) that sells loose bits--Hansen makes nice bits. I tend to like
the ones that are black in color, but it doesn't really matter as long as
it's sharp.


4. PROCEDURE FOR DRILLING METAL: Using wd-40 or some type of oil is not a
bad idea, but it's not really necessary with only one hole thru such thin
metal. What IS important is to use a variable-speed drill and to run the bit
slowly and with a lot of pressure. Since SS is fairly brittle, the metal
should come off the bit in chips. Just before you're about to pop thru the
metal, increase the speed of the drill to maximum. This will minimize the
tendency of the drill to jam, or to act like a tap and screw itself into the
hole.


5. Finally, when the pilot hole is done, switch bits and drill the final
hole the same way. 


6. NOTE: You didn't specify what size hole you needed to drill. Spiral bits
do not cut holes very well beyond about 1/2-in diameter (i.e., in a hand
held drill). Beyond that, I'd use a hole-saw.


7. NOTE: Practice on a piece of srap stainless until you feel comfortable,
just be certain to use a new pilot bit when you drill your pot.


If you have any further questions, please feel free to e-mail me. Just
remember the carpenter's adage: Measure twice, cut once.


TTYL,


Harlan

Subject: RE LM35 stories qnd dattalogging.


Hello, HBers.
1) LM-packaging stories:
Here how I fix the PLASTIC LM35CZ (or LM34 -thats the Fahrenheit thing):
Take a 400 mm long Stainless tube (inside diam 6.5 to 7 mm) from a beer
cooler (Englisch name = Chiller?)and on one end we solder (brazing with
silver) a piece of 6mm outside diam. copper tube. Thus the copper tube is
fitted in the SS tube. Drill out the copper tube so that the inside diam is
approx 4.8 mm. Put the cable with the sensor IC (who is already soldered on
this cable ans insulated where neccesary..)through the tubes and fix the
sensor with silicone in the copper tube end. Flatten the copper end and
solder it tight using solder with high content of Sn (68 percent or more, as
they use for copper water supply, than there is no danger for lead
migration..)This is possible with a 18 watts solder iron, just make that the
copper is fresh and clean, you can use normal rosin-flux centercore solder
for electronics. Such a temp. probe is living already more than 22 months
and nany brewsels. Al the other plastic encapsulated versions did not
survived longer than 6 months (=6 brewsels). Especially the hopping/cooking
90 minutes did suffer the plastic schrinking tubes and epoxies..
2) Measuring and data-logging:
For data-logging, I use a Korean multimeter from METEX, type M-3850D: it
measures, and is in communication with the PC via the rs232. Cable and
software is supplied with this meter. Here in Ghent it costs approx 90 USD
(3150 BEF). There are also other RS232-provided meters in same price range..
For future I will look for a more gently solution, because the brewing place
is not the ideal place for putting in a PC: There already excists cheap
dataloggers, cost approx the same price (100 USD, one year ago, that is what
I have seen in US magazines..). Those things have standard 2 inputs:  one
voltage input for 1 volt and one thermocouple (type K) input. Those modules
can be programmed with the PC via the rs232. Later, after brewing, you can
import the data in the PC.


Here in Europe they are not so easy to find (since I am pre-retired, I have
no much contacts anymore with the electronics world..)But in America!...
Is there somebody who can give info where we find info via www or where we
can buy it?

Greetings -
I wanted to pass along a warning concerning the plastic, conical bottom
tanks that can be ordered through U.S. Plastics. These are the ones that
come with a metal stand, and are available in 18 gal, 30 gal, and one
larger size - I think it's 45 gal. I heard about these tanks right here
on the H.B.D. Anyway, at first glance these appear to be custom made for
doing single stage fermentation of larger batches. Because of this, my
partner and I at the Double-Barrel Brew Pub decided to order two of them.
Well, it turns out they are less than ideal for this application :( 
Although they are well made, and appear to be thick enough plastic, we 
saw two major flaws with them. The first problem is with the top. It is a
VERY loose fitting cap that is impossible to seal, giving rise to infection
concerns. In order to use these as fermenters, we felt that the existing
cap would have to be discarded, and a new top fabricated. (yup, it's that
loose) Not impossible, but not what we expected. The other problem we saw
was with the way the threaded part is attached to the bottom of the cone.
There is a 3/4" lip that extends horizontally all the way around the bottom
of the cone, right where the threads attach. This would prevent all of the 
yeast sediment from falling down into the valve we planed on installing on
the bottom of these tanks. Also not the end of the world, but still kind of
a bummer. It's too bad these weren't designed by a brewer. We're sending 
them back...

I inquired about refilling costs and I was quoted $11 for 5 lb tank and 
$12 for 10 lb tank - apparently most of the cost is labor ! It makes 
sense to spend a little extra on a 10 lb tank and save on re-filling not

doesn't even screw on, it's more like you drop it into place. We figured that 
this could probably be rectified, but that would require discarding the top,
cutting a new opening, and then fashioning a new lid. The other problem we saw
was with the bottom, where the threads connect to the bottom of the cone. There
is a rather large lip that extends horizontally around the top part of the 
threads, a good 3/4 inch into the tank. This would prevent all of the yeast 
from falling into the valve we were planning on installing on the bottom of
these tanks. (Kind of like having a shelf in your conical bottom fermenter)
Not very desirable, if you ask me. Too bad these weren't designed by a brewer.

Subject: Hoppiness, CO2 cost,natural vs (un)natural carbonation


Brewsters,

Making your brew water a little harder using calcium sulfate and a little
magnesium sulfate will improve the perception of bitterness.  Try keeping your
mash at about 50ppm calcium and then add salts later as some of the Brits do.
Split a batch and add various amount of salts to "calabrate" your brews.
- ------------------------------------------------------ 
A couple of private e-mails and a comment here ask how I estimate the cost of
force carbonation, indicating, but never quite giving me hard numbers, that it
is actually much less expensive than my estimate of $2-3/ 5 gallon batch.


My estmates on the cost of force carbonation are based on numbers from a brew
shop owner who told me that a 5#  keg will carbonate three to five 5 gallon
batches.  I pay $10/5# cylinder.  It has never been an issue with me since I
have always carbonated naturally for other reasons. I am tempted to force
carbonate a Roggen that has been in secondary for a long time due to illness
over the holidays. I'll try to do an experiment to find out how much CO2 is
really needed for this activity. I know it can be easily calculated, but that
assumes no CO2 in the beer already.


If you're interested, I'd like to hear actual results, from those who force
carbonate, of the cost of carbonating young beer still with CO2 and beer that
has had a chance to equilibrate with a long stay in the secondary to get a
spread on cost estimates. Give us pounds of CO2 per gallon and your cost.

Michael,


With a PhD in Physical Chemistry I agree with your basic theoretical premise
that if all is the same, the same output should result.


Question is: How do you know all is the same?


CO2 is one of those creatures that forms structures with hydrogen bonding
liquids that you don't learn about in freshman chemistry.  These clathrates can
be pressure dependent and can have unusual physical properies.  Surfactants
(such as proteins, etc.) can affect clathrate rate of formation and
disappearance.  CO2 can also form association complexes with any number of
compounds, which could theoretically aid in producing a more stable CO2
solution.


How do you explain the stability of CO2 in beer in terms of basic principles?
Pour a glass one day and it may still be fizzy the next day, particularly if it
is a beer which has good head forming properties and especially if it is
naturally conditioned. Filtered, force carbonated beer like BudMilloors will
likely be flat. It is very difficult to provide you with a theoretical answer,
since head formation and bubble size is a kinetic phenomenon which is responsive
to physical agitation ( shake two cans open one now and one later versus an
unshaken can) , nucleation sites ( dirty glasses), surface tension (greasy
glasses) and other not really well understood phenomena in terms of basic
principles. We are not dealing with a thermodynamic equilibrium.  Perhaps the
CO2 formation from a yeast has a different  solvent cluster formation pathway
than just dissolving the CO2 in the liquid and it remains in a sort of complex
solvent state which has an energy barrier and therefore is slower to break up. I
only speculate since I don't know and don't know anyone who does.  


It may also be that yeast decomposition products provide a better surface active
group of compounds that somehow affect the size of the bead.  As you know, the
diacetyl rest has several activites - to carbonate the beer, purge undesirable
volatiles, reduce many compounds chemically and take up all the dissolved
oxygen. Extending the yeast activity through natural carbonation could bring
about other chemical changes not found in filtered and force carbonated beer.
Such chemical changes could affect the chemical compostion and the bubble size
formation.


It may also be something as simple as the naturally carbonated beers have more
yeast in them which acts as nucleation sites producing finer bubbles than the
relatively cleaner beer which has been filtered and force carbonated, fewer
nucleation sites and fewer, bigger bubbles.


In short, I don't know. I have never done an actual experiment to prove it one
way or another ( other than drink lots of beer of both kinds).  I can only ( as
can most of us) depend on what other, supposedly reputable people impart to us
until we are energized enough to do a proper ( and in this case difficult with
so many parameters) experiment ourselves.

Subject: Re: Spargeless Mashing: Something New?


I, for one, greatly appreciated Dr. Pivo's post, and I'm only piping in
because I'm afraid that a lot of the follow-up discussion will be private
and I will miss it. Please forgive my ignorance, as I've only seen two
all-grain brewing sessions, the second of which was the first one I ever
commanded. I've only seen mashing/lautering/sparging done one way, and I
don't understand the other ways of doing it: indeed, I can only imagine TWO
vessels (I use one) and I don't understand why one could possibly need a
mash tun, a lautering tun, and a sparge vessel.=20


As I understand it, what I did was simply an infusion mash. You take a big
picnic cooler, put in a Phil's Phalse Bottom with a siphon hose attached,
then dump in your grain, and cover with hot water to get the whole thing to
the first desired temperature. Stir and let sit. When it comes time to raise
the temperature, you add more hot water, stir and let sit. When you're done,
you siphon the stuff out through the false bottom into a plastic bucket and
pour the first runnings back through the grain. Then pour hot water through
the grain to get the volume up and specific gravity down to what you had in
mind. Then you add hops, put the liquor on the burner, and dump the grains
for the compost heap or wild animals.=20


So, it looks like I've got one vessel that serves the purposes of mash tun,
lauter tun, and sparge vessel.=20


Apparently there are folks who mash in a kettle. So, how do you sparge? Do
you just shovel the glop from the kettle into some other kettle that has
holes in the bottom? That seems like a lot of extra handling, a chance for
infections, a good way to get burned, and an opportunity for hot side=
 aeration.=20


Now, don't talk to me about RIMS. It seems like a great way to go, but way
too expensive for me right now.=20

Subject: Lagering in the bottle-jim booth


I understand why the big boys lager beer in tanks and then blend,
filter,bottle and ship, but what is the difference for the homebrewer
between bottle conditioning and lagering the bottles, and lagering in a
carboy and they bottling and storing the bottles.  


If one lets the beer settle fairly well before bottling, wouldn't
storing the conditioned bottles  at the low 30'sF be about the same as
bulk storage (assuming one has room).


Any advices out there?   Cheers, jim booth, lansing, mi

It's easy to understand why your beers are turning out less bitter than
you planned. For instance, In a 60 minute boil I'll guestimate that you're
not getting more than a few points over 20% utilization. For 0 minutes,
the utilization is basically zero. 


3 or more methods of calculating hop utilization are common among
homebrewers. Personally, I like the Glenn Tinseth formula. It's perhaps
the most conservative, but works very well for me. Hit the following URL
for a description: http://realbeer.com/hops/research.html


Mark Garetz, author of the book Using Hops, also has a methodology which
is described in his book. A less detailed description is available at the
website for his retail store, at http://www.hoptech.com/uhops.html. 


Finally, there's a classic formula in the special hops back issue of
Zymurgy. It's the most optimistic formula and personally I wouldn't use
it. Others may disagree. 


Hope this helps. Send mail if you have questions.
