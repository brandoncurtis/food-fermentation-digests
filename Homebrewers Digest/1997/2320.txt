Hi y'all,


This post is about adjusting the salt content of the beer after
the brewing session.


Recently I brewed an all-grain batch of oatmeal stout.  After the brewing
session I discovered that the local water that I used for the brew was
much softer than I had expected.  The mash and sparge were performed
without any problems.  The stout is currently in the primary
and tastes fine except that the beer is not as bitter as I had hoped.  Can
I add gypsum to the priming sugar at bottling to increase the hardness and
the perceived bitterness?  Would it be better to just make a hop tea at
bottling to increase the bitterness?  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.


Cheers,

I have apparently demonstrated the sanitizing power of pure oxygen. Do you
know what happens if you give a starter flask a good blast of O2 after the
Wyeast pack has already been poured into it, and then give it a shake?
Nada. Murderized yeast. 


Having had the experience of sanitizing a yeast starter with O2, I'm now
feeling a little paranoid. If I add a starter to the primary after
oxygenating with an airstone, do I need to worry? Normally I'd shake the
carboy a little bit just to mix the yeast into the wort, but what about
the O2 in the headspace and the O2 foam...does it cause casualties when it
mixes into the wort? Should there be a waiting period before pitching?

Greetings to the collective.  With regards to sea salt and iodine, iodine is added to 
Morton's iodized salt.  It does not naturally accompany "salt" (i.e. NaCl).  Iodine was 
added to salt in an attempt to supplement the diet in areas with low iodine contents in 
the soil and thus in foods.  Geographic areas came to be known for "endemic goiters" 
because of the lack of iodine in the local diet.  Iodine in iodized salt would have a 
negative effect on yeast, just as with iodophor.  Sea salt, on the other hand, should 
not have iodine in it unless it has been fortified.

The way I understand it, the yeast on the bottom of the fermenter is 
not dead but only resting. It will start going through autolysis if 
you leave it too long without food. Some people pour their wort on 
the previous yeast cake and then it ferments like a rocket. I dont 
think it is inferior yeast on the bottom, it is just yeast without 
food.


Am I understanding things wrong here ?

Greetings to the HBD braintrust,
        Anyone out there know how long we can trust plastic fermenters?
Assuming my fermenter hasn't been scratched (I don't scrub it and don't
store anything in it), should I wait until I have a problem with it?
Would a food-grad plastic pail have a certain lifespan?  On the same note,
would plastic siphon hoses and racking canes "expire?"  I figured you
folks are a more reliable source for this info than a homebrew shop which
would love to sell me new ones.

Subject: Double Batches


Good day brew collective.


I wanted to post a follow-up to  a discussion about a month ago extolling the
benefits of making two batches in one brew session.   Because my brew time has
been limited due to the addition of a new family member, I was looking to
optimize my brew schedule.  This past saturday, I attempted to make two
batches back to back.  I want to say it was a great success, only requiring an
additional two hours over what it normally takes to make a five gallon batch. 
 Some tips if you want to try.  You will need more than one pot to heat
infusion/mash/sparge water. Two heat sources would be great, but are not
necessary.  Try to stay organized.  Handling two recipes with at least 4
grains and 3 types of hops each can be trying.  Optimize down time, prep for
the second batch while the first is resting, boiling, etc.


I am sure there are more tips that the veterans can offer, but I am hooked. 
It does make for a long day, but you have twice as much beer for the effort.

     Eric asks for comments about his technique of starting

     Well, in short, you can't work backwards with mash enzymes.
     
     The high initial heat will denature the beta amylase.  As the 
     temperature drops all that you will achieve is slowing down the 
     surviving alpha amylase.  You'll get conversion, but a highly

You are exactly correct that the yeast in suspension do the majority of the
fermenting.


> Aren't the yeasts in the bottom of the fermenter going through

Nope, at least not if your fermentation is just finishing.  My point was these
yeasts are viable and only need food to continue fermenting and get re-suspended
by the CO2 and agitation. They are not damaged,dead and dying yeast, in the
large part, in contrast to what Graham Stone was told by a local brewer.  I pick
up these yeast with a siphon and use them for a krausen starter.

Should be the same or better in the bottle since the beer is closer to the
yeast. This is how I did it for decades. It's sorta like a flat carboy.
However, you touched on the reason with your parenthetical comment. Cornies or
carboys are much more space efficient in a fridge. , which is the same reason
the big boys use big tanks instead of lots of smaller ones.

        The time is roughly the same, the amount of dissolved CO2 the beer can
hold increases with decreasing temperature.  There are two methods I
use.  The "Pressurize it up to 35 psi and shake the sh*t out of it"
method, which will do a reasonably good job of carbonating it in about
45 minutes, and the "Just let it sit with the pressure on at 30-35 psi"
method, which takes about 3-4 days.  This second method I use for ales,
letting it corbonate as the yeast drops (pressure seems to speed up the
dropping too).

        If you want, keep the pressure up around 9-10 psi, and just release
excess pressure if you have trouble with foaming.  Otherwise, just get a
longer or narrower hose.  If it's an ale, I usually leave mine at about
7psi for dispensing, and the carbonation is about right.

        We think of wort as yeast food, but it is really a harsh environment. 
At first it is a hypertonic solution, tending to draw water out of the
yeast cells, and later it is full of toxic ethanol.  By increasing the
availability of oxygen to the yeast the cells can better build up their
defences, reproducing more effectively, and passing on more of those
defenses to daughter cells.  In this way the yeast can go though more
reproductive phases before succuming to the nasty effects of the
environment.  And by the way, some authors recomend aerating for a full
12 hours after pitching, which is more than just a few minutes...

        The big-bubble misconception is a hard one to shake.  I know
experienced brewers and judges who admit they should know better but
still cling to this notion.  The truth is that bubble size is determined
by the protein content of the beer, thus commercial hyper-filtered beer
is force carbonated and has bigger bubbles, but "kit & sugar" homebrew
is bottle conditioned and has bigger bubbles as well.  A hearty
all-grain or partial-mash beer shows no difference in the quality of
carbonation whether it's naturally conditioned or pressurized.

I would have to agree that skimming the krausen off and saving/repitching
it IS the best way to reuse your yeast, as ALL the brewery visits I have
been to can attest to that.


My only question...in order to adapt it to homebrewing, wouldn't you
need to do your primary fermentation in an open fermenter (plastic bucket).
In order to remove the krausen, you need to get to it!


If anyone has any ideas about removing krausen from a glass carboy I'd
like to hear it.  Especially if you plan on skimming off the brown trub
first.  Maybe a turkey baster to "suck up" the good stuff?

Subject: Aeration/kraeusening


There have been a number of posts recently saying that using submicron
filters for aeration/oxygenation is unnecessary and several posters have
given testimonials on how they used room air for aeration with no problems.


These statements are very narrow-minded.  These procedures may work for
you, but they don't necessarily work for everyone.  The FACT is, that in
my basement, in the summertime, I CANNOT use room air for aeration of
wort, else I will get a beer that has a faint clovey character that
increases over the course of several weeks in the bottle.  First, buying
a filtered air aeration system from Heartland Hydroponics (about $25,
including submicron syringe filter) immediately solved my problem.  Now,
foaming became a problem because I had to run the system for several
minutes.  I then switched to an Oxynater(tm) which not only solved the
problem of my clovey Bitters and Brown Ales, but also gave me faster
starts and lower FGs.  Incidentally, nobody suggested that oxygen needs
to be filtered and it's generally accepted that nothing harmful can live
in 99% O2, but I believe that spores can actually survive and there are
a number of beer-spoiling yeasts that do form spores.  So, while I don't
filter my oxygen, it's not as silly an idea as you may have initially thought.

Sorry... I was under the assumption that you were using dried malt extract.
Why anyone would have liquid malt extract sitting around at all is beyond
me... DME was the only logical "malt extract" in my mind.  Since there can
be an incredible amount of difference between a heaping tablespoon of DME and
a level one, you can see why I reacted to the "imprecision" of this method.


Regardless of whether it is DME or liquid, I fail to see the use of adding
extract if you are priming with corn sugar.  If you're going to say "to
absorb the oxygen added during bottling" forget it... the yeast will absorb
the oxygen because they like oxygen, not because there's some maltose in
the primings (there will be no difference in oxygen use between all-malt and
all-dextrose priming).  If you're going to say "because it gives better
head retention" or "for the nutrients" forget those too... there just isn't
enough of anything in two tablespoons of syrup to make a difference.


Now, regardless of all of that, this is still an imprecise way of kraeusening.
Why?  Because the yeast in the kraeusen beer is eating up the priming sugar.
Simply waiting 8 or 12 or 24 hours will not give you a predictable amount of
fermentable sugar in the kraeusen beer... neither will waiting for the
nebulous "high kraeusen."


The proper way to kraeusen a beer is to *know the FG of the kraeusen wort*.
Let's say you knew it was 1.010 and you started with 1.045 OG kraeusen wort.
What you want is to add a precise amount of fermentable sugar to the
finished beer.  Let's say you wanted 2.5 volumes of CO2.  Let's say the
finished beer was at 68F.  I happen to know that I need an increase of
0.00222 in gravity to get the 2.5 volumes of CO2.  This is 2.22 "gravity
points" or just "points."  The final volume will be about 5.3 gal (simply
because I happen to know that the kraeusen beer volume will be about a third
of a gallon).  Multiplying 2.22 times 5.3 gallons gives 11.77 points needed.


Now, let's get back to that 1/2 gallon of fermenting 1.045 OG wort (or
corn sugar water, for that matter) that we know will have an FG of 1.010.
We measure the SG and it's 1.040 (it has lost 0.005).  We now know that
each gallon of this liquid will add 30 points.  We also know that we need
11.77 points to add to the finished beer.  Dividing 11.77 by 30 gives 0.39
gallons of krausen (see, about a third of a gallon) beer needed.  0.39 times
128 ounces is 49.92, so you should add 50 fluid ounces of the kraeusen beer
to the finished beer and bottle immediately.  Had the kraeusen fermentation
gone a bit longer and there were only 25 points per gallon left in the
kraeusen beer, you would have had to add about 60 fluid ounces (20% more).


THAT'S kraeusening!

Greetings -
I wanted to pass along a warning concerning the plastic, conical bottom
tanks that can be ordered through U.S. Plastics. These are the ones that
come with a metal stand, and are available in 18 gal, 30 gal, and one
larger size - I think it's 45 gal. 




Hearing your warnings about these brought to mind a particualar idea i
had a few months ago.  Fermenting in large batchs.  so i got to
thinking....  (i know it gets me in trouble. :)


what to ferment in?  i wanted to do Oak Cask, but the price is
prohibitive.  so i was thinking of acceptable substitutes and came
accross a web page that had 30 gallon 2 hole plastic barrels for ~$27,
and thought  Hmm..  30 gallons of beer...  wow!


my questions are this...


1) has anyone tried this?  
2) how do think i could steralize these things?  they are not open, but
have to holes fist sized in the top.  hard to get into them.
3) how would i scale up batch size, and work in 30 gallon batches using
a 15 gallon converted keg brewing kettle (when i get it set up)?
4) comments, other ideas?

Subject: 5# CO2 tanks/reusing yeast


To catch up on a few recent threads...


I have a 5# CO2 tank and 4 corny kegs, 2-3 that are usually full and 
in use at any given time.  I only have 1 spigot, so I usually only 
have one beer on tap at a given time (although I also have 2 picnic 
taps).  I use my CO2 tank to purge sanitized kegs and for force 
carbonation.  
I'm not sure who posted the original note saying that you could get 
about 5 kegs out of a 5# CO2 tank, but that was a horrendous 
underestimation.  I get my tank filled about twice A YEAR, and I must 
get 15-20 kegs purged, carbonated and dispensed from that same tank.  


And a KISS (keep it simple stupid) guide to reusing yeast...


After I bottle or keg my beer from the carboy, I have a clean yeast 
cake on the bottom (this does not apply if you dry hop).  I swirl the 
last few ounces of beer around to suspend the yeast, then pour it out 
of the carboy thru a (sanitized) funnel into a (sanitized) grolsh 
bottle.  I then label the cap and put it into the door of the fridge. 
 I have kept yeast for 2-3 months like this with no problem.  A few 
days before brew day, I remove the bottle, release the pressure 
(especially important with lager yeast!) in the bottle, decant off 
the old beer and add the yeast slurry to
some freshly made starter (1/3 c. DME in a quart of water), and in 2 
days or so, I have a quart of yeast (about half slurry) at high 
kreusen.
I don't want beginning brewers to think that getting more than one 
batch of beer out of a smack pack is any more difficult than it is.  
Extended yeast propogation is not difficult, time consuming or 
expensive.

Subject: Re: CO2 cylinders 


Ian Smith asks how many "corny kegs" of beer you could carbonate and
serve with a 5lb tank of CO2.


Well, let's see.  


5lb of CO2 is about 2300 grams.  At 1/2 gram per liter, this is about
4600 liters of CO2 at STP.  If you assume a carbonation rate of 2
volumes, then you could carbonate 2300 liters of beer (60 kegs).  


BUT, you need to push the beer out of the tank.  Assume you do this at
14PSIG, or 1 atmosphere.  Then it takes 10 gallons (38 liters) of CO2
to push 5 gallons of beer out of the tank.  And it takes 10 gallons of
CO2 to carbonate the 5 gallons of beer, or 20 gallons per tank.  20
gallons of CO2 is 76 liters.  Therefore, you can carbonate and serve
about 30 5-gallon kegs of beer with a 5lb tank of CO2.


This is not out of line with my experience.  Of course, I use the CO2
for much more than just serving the beer, and I'm sure I DO have leaks
in my system.

Subject: No sparge mashing, recirculation (Dave Mercer)


Tried a no sparge mash this weekend.  Efficiency was lower than expected
(maybe 50%) so the gravity was about 10% below my target, but that's
okay. Live and learn. 


Some questions: I assumed it would be a good idea to top-off with boiled
(and still hot) water, as this would decrease likelihood of HSA. 


Q1 - Is this correct? What I actually did was guesstimate that I'd need
around 3.5 gallons of extra water, so I brought it to a boil in my
brewpot, then drained the mash directly into the pot with the boiled
water (aka reverse topping off) keeping the tube outflow below the water
surface the entire time. Smart, huh? 


Q2 - is there any benefit to a slow, medium, or fast drain (other than
time saved)? For the record I had the valve opened all the way and let
'er rip.  Which brings me to...


Q3 - I vorgot to vorlauf (doh!) and the wort was pretty murky (although
usually I only have to recirculate a quart or so before it's running
clear so I don't know how much unwanted crap actually got in.) It didn't
taste bad when racking to the primary (In fact, it tasted damn good
although I overshot the IBU's a little, I think.) Didn't look any more
muddy than usual with cold break either. So the question: Is
recirculation done for aesthetic reasons, or taste? I.e. Will I have a
beer that will not clear, or one with tannin off-flavors, or both, or
neither?

Apparently there are folks who mash in a kettle. So, how do you sparge?

you just shovel the glop from the kettle into some other kettle that has

I have never done it, but am thinking of starting. I think the important
item that you need to know is an EasyMasher is installed to drain the
Liquor into a plastic pail, then more hot water is added after the
Mashout to sparge the remaining liquor out.  "Then pour hot water
through the grain to get the volume up and specific gravity down to what
you had in mind."


does that clear it up?


the reason i am thinking of going with this method is reduced cost, and
clutter, and better tempeture control.  this is open to debate of
course. :)

Subject: Anal Retentiveness Disorder (ARD)


ARD is a disease of psychosomatic (worrying too much) origins. The basic
presenting complaint is of inability to pass a stool which is interpreted as
constipation (ie full of it). Most commonly constipation (or more seriously
obstipation) is caused by dehydration (lack of homebrew) and compounded by
ingestion of constipating foodstuffs (like cheese). ARD is relieved by
digital dilatation of the anal sphincter muscle (you know, the glove trick).
This procedure is most commonly performed in the left (or right if you are
left handed ;^)) lateral decubitus position (a la modified Sims). 


I frequently recommend to my patients a round or three of sitz baths (~105'F
with Epsom salts, waist high), stool softeners (like spent grains), and
suppositories (as seen on TV), subsequent to digital dilation (you know, the
glove thing again). I also find a good dose of homebrew helpful in causing
relaxation of the smooth muscle tissue found in the anal sphincter
(rostrally, the distal being striated and less reactive to homebrew). So, by
relaxing, not worrying, and having a homebrew, ARD is avoided, or at least
deminished to the point of being nonsequiter 8-)

Subject: Iodophor


Hi all,


I've recently started using Iodophor as a sanatizer.  I've been 
following much of the recent discussion and I've searched the 
archives for all posts on Iodophor.


My first attempt left me with quite an 'interesting', unpleasant 
taste, in the sample I drew off for a gravity measurement.  I'm about 
as certain as I can be (without being positive) that this flavor was 
not there prior to racking.


The Iodophor I'm using is B.E.S.T (forget what they stand for) and it 
says on the small 4 oz bottle that 1 oz to 10 gallons will give 12.5 
ppm of titratable iodine.  Looking on my measurement chart in the 
kitchen I see that 1 fluid oz == 2 tablespoons, thus it would seem 
that 1 tablespoon / 5 gallons would be about right.  This matches 
both the information in the archives and recent posts on the 
subject.  That is what I used to sanitize my carboy and my racking 
cane.  I left them both to soak for .5 hour, and then lightly rinsed 
each.  I did not let either air dry, nor did I do the triple hot 
water rinse procedure that I usually follow with CTSP.


So, my questions for those with more experience using this stuff than 
I are:


1) Does it seem likely from this description that I've gotten 
Iodophor at detectable levels in my beer? ( I still have positive 
pressure on the airlock of the secondary.) 


2)  If it is in solution, will it degrade with time? 


3) Get scrubbed out by CO2?


4) Should I stick with CTSP for glass and siphon tubes, and use 
Iodophore strickly for kegs?  


5) How critical is it to allow it to air dry?


Thanks in advance.

When I started getting geared up for all-grain brewing, I knew that my new

old kettles (4 and 5 gallons each) would not be adequate for even a single
all-grain batch of 5 gallons. So I made sure that my new kettle was at least
12 gallons, I got a 10-gallon keg, and I got an outdoor propane cooker. My
new plan is the brew less frequently (sad face) but brew a lot more on those
days (happy face). I plan each brew session to do a 10-gallon batch of
all-grain, and while the grain is mashing to do a five-gallon extract batch.
I've only brewed one all-grain batch so far, and it was a five-gallon batch,
but it was no problem to brew a five-gallon extract brew during the mash.

G'day from New Zealand,


I've been reading the HBD for only the last week or so, so I'm a bit puzzled 
by the discussion of aeration:


1.  Isn't the process by which yeast converts sugar to yeast an anaerobic 
process, ie doesn't require oxygen?


2.  Doesn't aeration lead to oxidation, a bad outcome?


I've also got a few unrelated questions about yeast?


3.  What constitutes an adequate supply of yeast?  Doesn't yeast multiply?  
Doesn't the difference between a million yeast cells and a billion come down to 
time and sugar?


4.  What's the point of a starter bottle? Is it to shorten fermentation time 
overall, or is it to give the "good yeast" a head start in the life and death 
battle against "bad yeast"?  The starter bottle looks to me like another source 
of contamination, so I've just pitched the yeast into the wort straight out of 
the package.  Is this heresy?


5.  Why do brewers reuse yeast?  Is it to save money, or is there another 
reason?  


Thanks in advance for your replies.

well from my and several other commercial brewers there IS a big difference.
forced/jacked up co2 take more time to mellow out, no i dont have technical
articles on this (does anyone?) but it is very apparent thru blind taste panels 
we have done (and others).  actually artifical co2 produces large bubbles for
a period of time, top yeast tended to produce smaller bubbles and bottom
yeast <seemed> to produce the finest bubbles of all.  the yeasted beers
were (of course) bottle conditioned, same beer, same primings(both were
fermented out). from this the only difference was bottle conditioning
temperature.
taste wise all the panelist mentioned a harsh (carbonic??) bite to the
artificial
carb and smooth carbonation to the yeasted beers. over time the carbonic bite 
does mellow and the head is better but the retention was still much better
in yeasted beers.


most commercial breweries (not all) bung off the fermenter with about 2P
or so left as fermentables.  not only does it save money and time, but the
beers just taste better quicker.  


this again is a commercial experience, based on our results with our beers
and was corroberated by my mentor. just a data point
