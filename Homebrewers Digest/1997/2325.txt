Al, my CRC handbook shows Ca oxalate as being soluble in acid solution
but insoluble in acetic acid (vinegar).  I would suggest using dilute
HCl (Muriatic acid) to remove the beerstone.

 It is entirely possible, but that's not how I remember it. It has been nearly
three decades since I drank it and it wasn't that often, staying with the kegged
versions of beers mostly.  Was White Shield bottle conditioned?  Is it possible
both existed?

Hi.  I'll be moving to Boston late this spring.  So I wondered if somebody
could give me a run down on the best brewpubs, bars with good selections,
good suppy stores, store with the best selection of hard to find imports,
and, hell, any good info you feel like sharing. Also, I'm interested in the
industry, so I was thinking of looking for a job at a brewery there to get
a feel for it.  Could someone give me a list of addresses of good breweries
that I could contact?
Thanks a lot for any info you could give me....private e-mail would be good.

Welcome to the first digest from the new home for the Homebrew Digest.
As you will notice there is a completely new address for article and 
submission requests.  To post articles to the Homebrew Digest, use the
following address:


                homebrew`at`brew.oeonline.com


All subscription, unsubscribe (Except for those on BEER-L), article
cancellation and help requests should be mailed to:

The previous addresses relating to the HBD will be forwarded to this 
system for a few weeks, then will be turned off.  It's best to memorize
the new address now and start using it as of now.


We have implemented all of Rob Gardner's old features (as well as his 
software).  You may once again cancel requests as before, and digests


We have re-instated the old Digest numbering sequence, allowing for the V2 
digests that were issued through the AOB.


Other than that, you should see no differences in how the system works.
At least we hope not major differences.  If you have specific questions

Subject: Freshman digest/Coffee filters


On the freshman digest-
        I doubt this would work.  It needs to be made clear that no
question is "too basic" to be asked.  If something is beyond you (or
beneath you), page down.  I also suspect that there would be subscribers
that would dominate the forum feeling the need to answer (and argue about)
every newbie question.  Good thing nothing like that ever happens on the
HBD...


On Coffee Filters-
        I bought these coffee filters that say on the bag "fits most Home
Brewers" -  They don't really fit me unless I wear them as a hat; under any
circumstances they aren't very stylish.  I guess I'm confused.  ;)

How can you say definitely? Look at Guinness. It's been filtered and it
has a 
great head! Don't you agree?

You shouldn't make blanket statements like that. I use a 5 micron filter,
force carbonate, and don't have any trouble with head retention.

Most beers contain 300-1000 ppm total nitrogen, which (when multiplied by 
6.25) represents < 1% protein in beer. A very small proportion is FAN, and 
another very small proportion > 100,000 MW. The biggest fraction is in the 
5,000-12,000 MW range. 
 
It has been experimentally proved that there is about 4-5 times as much 
Medium Weight surface active proteins in an all malt, single step infusion 
mashed beer to hold an acceptable head.(As long as lipids are low enough)
A 
head measuring device and progressive dilution was used to come to this 
conclusion. However in decoction with medium modification malts it is a
lot 
more critical.(I forget how much excess) 
 
With all malts available in the US and UK it seems practically impossible 
using all malt recipes to have too little FAN (amino acids), too much is 
more likely. Thus, I can't think of any reason to spend more than ten 
minutes between 45C and 55C?(*peptidase* rest) You will already have
enough 
FAN, and over-reduction of Medium Weight Proteins is only significant in 
this range. 
 
The "protein rest" (I dislike the use of that general term, it is 
misleading) in Fix's 40-*60*-70 schedule is at the top end for a 
*proteinase* rest and would only reduce High Molecular Weight Proteins to 
Medium anyway. I can't see much chance of loss of head or mouth feel 
proteins in infusion mashed beers that minimise the 45C-55C time. Lipids 
(from fast runoff shallow lauters) are a more likly culprit with head
problems.
 
The good people at Amicon Tech. (thanks for your research John Carpenter) 
say that

The *most* haze forming proteins are of the order of 50,000 plus. The 
"MMWP's" of brewing are of the order of 5,000-50,000. These are the 
mouthfeel and head retaining proteins, although they overlap with haze 
forming ones. Proteins greater than 1,000,000 (HMWP) have no chance of 
surviving a 60 minute boil and end up in the trub. (One reason for a
58-60C 
rest is to reduce these HWMPs to Medium Weights that could survive the 
boil.) Thus with a 5 micron filter, *all* soluble beer protein should pass 
through except for "protein binding" to the filter medium itself. (As
Chuck 
Burkins pointed out.) Some yeast would also get through 5 microns. 
 
>From Amicon's info above, a 2 micron or even 0.2 micron filter would also 
not seem to be a problem. However 0.2 micron sterile filtrations in 
breweries reportedly give a thinner mouthfeel although Amicon says
molecular 
weights as high as 1,000,000 should sail through? Something doesn't gel 
here? I will research this further unless someone has data. 
 
It is interesting to note that the "Ice Beer" technique was partly
directed 
at getting tiny icicles to form (nucleate) around all insolubles (yeast, 
haze, bacteria) however small, and thus allow sterile filtration at larger 
micron ratings, preserving the mouthfeel of larger solubles.
Pastuerisation 
with the same filters would give a good beer too, but that cost more and 
wasn't as sexy for the marketing department. 
 
 At present 5 micron would seem to filter fat yeast, yeast flocs, and
larger 
haze flocs. Smaller yeast and *any* soluble protein should pass
through.(As 
John Carpenter posted) BTW, this is Fix's preferred filter pore size, he 
likes some invisible yeast in his beer. Also, avoiding 45C-55C peptidase 
rest, and including a 58-60C proteinase rest will maximise your available 
MMWPs. 
 
The relationship between these and dextrins in contribution to mouthfeel 
would be interesting to understand fully.

I'm about to brew a stout and I've been thinking that maybe a mint flavoring

Any suggestions? I think it would be kinda neat if it's not over done.

Well aah, depends on how you aerate.  


The first couple times I used a pump and an airstone and it was foam city.
I mean it was the great grandaddy of blowoffs - really a blowout.


Enough of that.  Now I simply use my racking cane with no airstone and pump
filtered air. I get big bubbles, but the foam gets about one to two inches
thick and I let it go for about 4 hours.  


I haven't taken any measurements on this but my feeling is that 4 hours of
continuous bubbling (with large bubbles from the racking cane) will
sufficiently aerate the wort.  


When using the airstone, I had to keep stopping the pump. On for a couple
minutes then off for ten or so minutes.  So I am thinking that it's much
easier and probably as good or better without the airstone.


Stand back, here come the comments!! :>)

Before you go starting some Freshman HBD, you should consider who
will be answering the questions asked... I mean, as much as I like to
help out and answer beginners' questions, if not for the discussions
of planispiral chillers, beerstone removal, and anthocyanogens, I don't
know if it could keep my interest.  No, this has been proposed before
and the fact is that to keep the interest of all, you have to bore
everyone some of the time.  Keep trying to understand the advanced
stuff... you'll be surprised how quickly you get up to speed!  It
reminds me of those "improve your vocabulary" offers on TV: once you
learn words like unction, obdurate, and bacchanal, who the heck are you
going to talk to?

I've used this yeast enough to know it pretty well and I find that it
does not require aeration during fermentation to get decent attenuation,
but it does benefit from rousing.  Rousing is where you whip the yeast
back into suspension somehow.  We as homebrewers have the advantage over
commercial brewers in this respect because we can simply rock the fermenter
in a circle till the yeast is back in suspension.  As long as you keep
the airlock on the fermenter, no oxygen is dissolved into the beer because
the headspace is still all CO2.  I rouse the yeast every two days or so
for the week of fermentation.

I agree that it's the yeast in suspension that are creating the carbonation.
When we rack to the priming vessel, we typically leave all the yeast that
has settled in the fermenter, no?  That's what I do...


As for autolysis, I think that for most strains we use these days,
healthy yeast doesn't autolyse for months.  I have had several beers
in primaries at 63-65F for months and I've had no noticeable autolysis
in any of my beers.

It's not hardness than matters... it's sulfate.  Harness is a measure of
(primarily) calcium and magnesium in the water.  Yes, the water would be
harder after these additions, but it's the sulphate that accentuates the
bitterness and not the Ca or Mg.  Furthermore, watch the Mg levels... too
much will give you the runs.

Assuming you have no leaks and don't use CO2 for purging anything, you will
need between 1.5 and 3 times more CO2 if you force-carbonate than if you
simply dispense.  Here's why: when you just dispense, you use up 1 volume
of CO2 for every volume of beer you dispense (it takes 5 "gallons" of CO2
to push out 5 gallons of beer -- the quotes are because a gallon of gas
at 22psi is 2 gallons of gas at 11psi, but if you ignore this, it all works
out anyway, so don't worry about it).  Now, to carbonate, you need between
1.5 and 3 volumes of CO2.  Remember that the beer will already have between
1 and 2 volumes of CO2 already dissolved in it and you want a final level
of carbonation of about 2 to 4 volumes (depending on style).


Personally, I use my CO2 to push iodophor, water, purge fermenters, CP-fill
bottles, etc., so I can't really say how many 5-gallon batches I get from
my 20# tank, but with all those other uses, I still get at least 10 batches
from 20# and that includes some force-carbonation.  Maybe it's 15 or 20
batches... I've never really counted.  But let's say you get 20 batches
from your 5# tank without force-carbonation or all the other stuff.  Then
you would get roughly 7 to 10 batches if you did force-carbonate.

I'll tell you how I know: because I get a beautiful moussy head on my
beer with force-carbonation (if it's appropriate for style).

Whoa!  Who said filtered?  I didn't... I force-carbonate *unfiltered* beer.
As for the diacetyl rest, it's primary purpose is to help the yeast re-
absorb diactyl faster than if you simply went from fermentation at 50F
to lagering at 40F.  The diacetyl rest has nothing to do with carbonation,
purging undesirable volatiles, dissolved oxygen (what dissolved oxygen --
you simply raise the the temperature of the beer -- no transfer is implied
or needed in the diacetyl rest) and the only compound other than diacetyl
that I could imagine would be re-absorbed might be acetaldehyde.  The
only time I naturally carbonate my kegs is when it's important to me to
be able to say "this is cask-conditioned real ale."

This may be the most brilliant thing you've posted, Dave.  I think it has
real possibilities.  We should investigate further.  It would explain why
my unfiltered, but force-carbonated, beer has fine carbonation.  I've recently
bought a filter, so I can do some side-by-side tests, but remember that
bubble formation is *very* strongly affected by medium-sized protein
content and filtering can (and often does) strip-out these important
proteins.

Right you are... I disagree.  For my old system (pretty standard 10 gallon
Polar, 12,000 BTU NG kitchen stove) the Garetz formulas gave me more than
200% of the expected IBUs whereas the Rager formulas (the ones in the 1990
Hops Special Issue that Alex dislikes), plus 10% more hops to compensate
for the hop bags I was using, gave me IBUs that were within 3% of the target
value (as measured by The Siebel Institute of Technology)!

I use an immersion chiller in 5 gallon batches. Mine can take the boiling 
wort down to 85F in 10-12 minutes (a little more than a few seconds). I get 
a very nice cold break. After chilling I whirlpool the wort and let settle 
for 15-20 minutes while I do cleanup, drinking, sanitizing, drinking, 
getting yeast ready, drinking, well, you get the picture.


I still get some cold break in the fermenter but maybe only a 1/4 inch or 
so. I also use a secondary, usually after about a week. I like to add the 
gelatin to knock down the yeast and I always do this during transfer from 
primary to secondary. Even on a dark beer like porters and stouts. I don't 
like the taste of yeast and I want it OUT of the beer.

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


As you (should) be able to see, the HBD is now in what we hope to be 
its permanent home. Many people pulled together to bring this 
together. The donors of material and monies to

for us to function on the net. The one no-one notices, quietly chugging 
away in the background is the "brains" of this operation. I wish to 
offer my sincerest thanks to my friend and teacher Karl Lutzen. 
Without Karl's expertise, the server from whencce this now comes 
would be doing little more than consuming electricity.


Take a look at http://oeonline.com/~pbabcock/hbd to see our own

Thanks again for your support, and we look forward to your continued

OK, enough mushy stuff! I remember reading about some fairly

Don't worry Alex, my pride is unwounded.  What I objected to in your post
was not that you were telling me my procedures were bad, but that you were
doing so without explaining why.


_Why_ is my technique not well suited to my equipment?


_Why_ would resting at 104F have a negative impact on sparging?


_Why_ would a thick mash during saccrification but not during
     mashout/lautering make for difficulties during lautering?


If you (or anyone else) have answers to any of these questions, I would
definitely like to hear them -- I'm not just looking for people to tell me
what I want to hear.  What I'm really trying to figure out is _why_ this
happened.  I certainly appreciate the replies I have gotten -- there were
several times in the past when I wrote into the HBD with what seemed to me
like interesting topics, but never heard a peep from anyone else;
meanwhile, there seemed to be 53 posts every day on the "Beer in Space"
thread. (Note: this is not, repeat _not_, an invitation to restart the Beer
in Space thread.  If it is finally dead, let it stay that way, please.)
But if you write in attacking a man's technique, you can't expect him not
to defend himself.  ;)


In reply to your questions, there is no difference between the Crisp malt
and any other pale ale malt in the way it feels, tastes, or looks.  There
may be a way for me to get it analyzed it further -- I will check into
that, and if I can find a way, I will report back on that.

  How? By bringing them in contact with EACH OTHER.


  A week-long pass to the WE Festival is only $15.00. The cost for 
anyone attending as a "representative" of any corporate conglomerate 
is $1500.00(that is not a joke). 
  
  WE Festival attendees will get in to all participating venues free,
and receive a We Guide(to help them navigate the new frontier).
Plus, they'll get free access to the Wilmington Exchange Center,
(a deconsecrated church)where they can bring a bigass bag and fill it 
with as much as they can carry, since tons of free swag will be theirs
for the taking (as well as giving - show off what you DO!).


  Detailed submission guidelines, schedules of events, accepted bands, 
neat pictures, etc., are available on the web `at`

>(g CO2/100 g beer, according to Eric Warner, _German Wheat Beer_). 


[Large snip]


I disagree. The only time the amount of CO2 used seems to come up is when
someone asks how far a bottle of CO2 should go. In that regard, even the
best theoretical information is only the most optimistic case for empirical
results. The rest of us waste CO2 on leaks, trying to get seals to seat, and
pushing cleaning solution through lines and kegs. 


For the force-carbonator, empirical results show that hooking your keg up to
30 psi and shaking and/or letting it sit a few days carbonates the beer
enough. For the keg or bottle conditioner, empirical results show that a
certain amount of sugar (or gyle) will carbonate the beer enough. There's
little confusion or problem with the empirical results. If X volume of sugar
doesn't sufficiently carbonate one batch when it has sufficiently carbonated
previous batches, it's unlikely that the problem is with the volume of sugar
added.

>> Why do they use green glass for beer bottles, =
>>anyway?


Agreed -- but green bottles are surely superior to clear glass bottles, and
there's some mighty fine beer sold THAT way. 


I guess I don't understand why Heineken in green bottles is so consistently
skunked. As I understand it, it's the light through the bottle that's the
problem, not necc heat or motion. If I were shipping Heineken to the USA,
the bottles would be in cardboard boxes which would be on pallettes which
would be in containers on container ships. There would be AT LEAST
corrugated cardboard between the beer and daylight until they reached the
retailer, and for most of the journey there would be a layer of metal (the
container, ship hull, truck sides). How does beer get skunked under those
conditions?

anyways after adding the yaest to the 95 degree wort I saw a lot of 
action, it bubbled for about 24 hours then let off and now is not doing 
anything, is this still normal? I would also like to think all the
