                        The Jethro Gump Report...part 2
Subject: BATF/FDA Testing for Copper


        Back in November, we were paid a visit, following a phone survey on
the use of brass in the brew-house, particularly in regard to fermented
product...I'm sure you folks have heard of the FDA 'suggestion' that brass
be eliminated from the brewery, when it is able to be in contact with acidic
pH's and the relatively high percentage, (compared to H2O) of ETOH....the
fear being that copper might be leached from the brass, and harm the
customer.   
        It being my understanding that the majority of bar faucets in the US
are brass, and having been told that certain states have already adopted the
'suggestion' as law, (California?) I was most interested in this project.
        Anyway, an agent of BATF visited, and took samples of 2 beers for
analysis. She very kindly sent me copies of the results......our Wheat had
43 ppb copper, and our Red had 27 ppb. This, as stated on the analysis
document, with the notation "The copper level found in the sample is below
the FDA established limit of 1000 ppb in bottled water." ....BATF, National
Laboratory Center, Rockville, Maryland. It seems that this bogey has been
laid to rest.
        FWIW, our fermented product is in stainless, except for the sample
cocks, which are brass on fermenters, conditioners, and servers. The servers
are TC clamped to a stainless piece that then is attached to brass T's, and
brass nipples that join the beer hose (vinyl) to the brass faucets. 
        Our first real lab analysis! Boy, maybe, FDA can come up with a
suggestion that clarity, sediment, air, CO2, SG, real and apparent extract,
ETOH, original extract, attenuation, reducing sugars, protein, iodine
reaction, pH, sulfur dioxide, iron, acidity, and bitterness levels in beer
might be harmful! Then I can stop lusting over the analytical services
provided by Siebel that my boss will never go for!

        Of course you know I'm no chemist, but every 3rd or 4th brew in the
kettle, whether cleaned with caustic or PBW by 5 Star, I use an acid
rinse....currently using 2 different acid products, but essentially the
same...a blend of Nitric and Phosphoric. Works well. 1 ounce per 10 gallons
at 140 F, for 20-30/60 CIP. 5-Star's 'Acid 5' recommended.

        Ah, the technical versus the practical! Of course, George is not
wrong, but I get decent results mashing into 150-155 F (Depending on the
beer), and dropping to 140-145 F over an hour and a half. Systems built for
single infusions seem to work well with this plan, IMHO.

Cotton plugs are used all the time on test tubes containg bacteria
cultures. This cotton, though, is non-absorbant. But I don't see why
ordinary cotton balls can't be used as an air filter, especially if it is
kept dry.

   I've got an easy answer to that: as soon as the strainer start to become
clogged with hop gunk, fling the gunk into the kitchen sink.  At most, you
might have to rinse the strainer under the kitchen sink for a second or
two.  I can easily strain 2.5 gallons of wort (using 6 oz. of hop pellets
for an IPA) into a carboy in less than 5 minutes.


   As far as a hop bag lowering utilization goes -- I can't help you there.

>
>1)  I put hot bleach water in my keg, sloshed it around, sealed the keg
>(after a few tries) and then under 5-7 psi....


NEVER, NEVER, NEVER ever put bleach in a stainless container.  Even if you
do, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER ever do it hot.  Even if you do put a hot
bleach solution in a stainless container, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, put a stress
on the material by, for example, putting it under pressure.


The chloride hates the stainless, and the stainless can do without the
chloride.
For those who are unaware, the best one can hope for after putting any
material containing an appreciable amount of chlorides in a stainless
container is severe pitting.  At the worst, it will split!  NO KIDDING.
All stainless steels are subject to chloride atack, but the austenitic
stainlesses (a magnet won't stick to it) are highly suceptable to a
phenomenum known as Chloride Stress Corrosion Cracking.  Very low chloride
levels, < 20 ppm, has been known to cause it.  High temperatures make it
worse.  I impressed my boss (an engineering manager) one day when he showed
me a 5 gal  stainless pot that had split down the side and asked me why?  I
asked him "What were you doing, boiling chlorides in it?"  He looked at me
as if I was psychic, then smiled and said "No, it was only at 140 degrees
(F)".  No applied stress, only residual stress from the deep drawing during
the manufacture of the pot.


Use non-chloride cleaners on all stainless and iodophor for sanitizing.


A bit long of a response, but homebrewers often have bleach and stainless
containers at the same time and it can't be repeated enough.


Yes, I am a metallurgist, a homebrewer, and in no way anal retentive.

Subject: Pronounciation of Gueuze




Well, there's no way to pronounce the word using American English
sounds.  The consonants are easy, it's the vowels that are tricky.


The vowel sound in the middle is close to the French eu (as in pneu),
and the German o-umlaut (or Scandinavian o-slash).  Then there's an
unaccented short-e sound at the end.  It's sort of like the vowel
sound in "bird", but without the following "r" sound, and longer.


Jackson says it's close to "cursor", but that's only because he's
British and they talk funny.  :-)

Subject: Remedies after kegging


I have just tasted the finished product of my first all-grain brewing
experience. I found I made a couple of mistakes, and I wonder if it's
possible to address them now, or if I should just make a note for next time.


First, there aren't enough bittering hops. I was trying to do First Wort
Hopping, but I mis-remembered how that is done and just dumped the bittering
hops (pellets) into the grain bin before I started the mash. Apparently most
of those got filtered out and never got boiled at all. After I brewed, I
read up on First Wort Hopping again, and discovered I should have added the
hops to the first runnings from the sparge. 


Anyway, very little of the hops intended for the boil got boiled, and my
finished product is fully fermented and force-carbonated. I was considering
making a "hop soup" by boiling some hops in a half-gallon or so of water for
an hour, and then adding some of the soup to the finished product to hop to
taste. Thoughts, suggestions?


Second, I was trying to make an ESB, and I really like the taste of one of
my previous (extract) batches of ESB. The previous batch had .25# of biscuit
added, and I forgot to put that in this batch. As long as I'm making a hop
soup, should I steep in some biscuit as well? I looked in my only brewing
book, Papzian's New Joy, and I don't find biscuit listed, so I don't know if
it's a malted grain or a roasted grain, hence I don't know if it will
produce fermentable sugars.

secondary, 1 more week,FG 1.006 (low?), bottled, primed with 1 
tsp/750ml dextrose. Yeast Labs W51 was used.


2 weeks later there is very little carbonation. I have never racked to 
a secondary before as I didn't feel it neccessary for this beer type.
The previous batch differed from this one only in that I did not rack
to secondary and bottled at 1.014. In hindsight 1.014 might have been
a little high as the beer turned out slightly overcarbonated (but
not unacceptable for this style beer). 


comparing the SG of the two batches:
day        previous        current
1        1.050                1.050
2        1.028                1.030
3        1.020                1.018
4        1.015                1.014
5        -                1.012
6        1.014                1.011
7        bottled        1.010


Temperature was about the same for both, but for some reason
the current batch was prepared to ferment down to 1.006 whereas the
previous batch was finished about 1.014. According to Eric Warner
1.014 is quite acceptable for a FG for a weizen. I did not expect
the current batch to go as low as 1.006.


My questions are:
1. why should one batch ferment to a much lower FG almost everything
else being 'equal'?


2. is 1.006 low? Should I have added more priming sugar?


3. since I reused the yeast shouldn't it have less 'vigour' than the
previous batch?

Does Munich malt generally have enough enzymes to convert itself (100% of

Subject: Sea salt


Rod Schlabach asked about sea salt.


Can anyone out there comment on the use of "sea salt".


I work for a salt company and have been making salt directly from sea water
for 20 years.  Most of the salt sold on the west coast is made from sea water
no matter what the package says.  East of the Rockies, salt is obtained from
underground salt deposits put there by ancient seas.  Producers refine these
salt sources to various degrees and mix in whatever additives the customer
wants.  As stated in an earlier response, a common additive is a salt of
iodine for use in those few areas of the country where the diet is low in
iodine due mostly to soil conditions.


Some marketers put out a low grade salt (not washed well) or add magnesium to
make a "sea" salt.  Most producers do their best to remove any magnesium
because it tends to make the salt taste bitter.  


Bottom line is, "sea" salt will give you a little extra magnesium which you
need in the mash anyway.  I wouldn't sweat it and I wouldn't pay extra for
"sea" salt.

Oxalic acid has pK's of 1.23 and 4.19 so that beerstone should dissolve if
enough of any acid (hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric...) is used
to make a rinse with  pH lower than 4.19 assuming that the monohydrogen
salt is soluble. For sure it will dissolve at pH < 1.23 so 0.1N

Dear Collective:


        OK, this post might seem to be a bit out line with brewing, but be 
patient... It'll get there


        I happen to find myself in Barcelona, Spain for a few days.  My first 
night out, I managed to find a little bar who specializes in Belgian beer. 
 (Isn't it amazing how we can home in on places like this....) They have 
about a hundred varieties.  What I would like to know is, what are the six 
Trappist breweries of Belgium, and the names of the beers they make?  I 
know Chimay and Orval, but can't remember the rest.  I feel certain that 
they have 'em all.


        Here's the brewing tie in - I plan to take yeast samples, and I need to 
know which beers to get.  Also, besides the 'big six', what others would 
you want to get if you had the chance.  I have a limit of about 12 total 
samples.


        More questions for yeast ranchers:  I will have to use agar for medium 
(no wort available), and the samples won't be used for 4 months.  Any 
helpful hints on storage and culturing?


        Thanks in advance for your input - private e-mail is fine.  I'll be 
thinking about all of you as I gently pour out my first Chimay of the 
evening tonight.

Subject: Beware the Rootbeer Beer




Although Phil Wilcox and Robert DeNeefe asked very different questions in 
#42 & #43 respectively, they both touched on a scary subject...  the after 
effects of rootbeer on your homebrew.


Do not, I repeat, DO NOT use your kegs for rootbeer unless you want to 
dedicate that keg to rootbeer for all time.  All the associated plastic and 
rubber parts will be contaminated with the flavor/aroma of the rootbeer, and 
will have to be replaced.  We were unfortunate enough to not know this 
before we kegged up a batch of the "kid's beer", and even though we have 
very good sanitization procedures, the next 3 batches of homebrew tasted 
like rootbeer.  This was extremely disappointing, as well as hard to 
swallow.


After the 1st batch, we decided to replace the o-rings, but the 2nd batch 
was just as bad.  When we asked our favorite pro-brewer about the problem, 
he commiserated with us, and informed us that any brew-pubs, etc that make 
rootbeer dedicate some equipment to this process because the time and effort 
(and $$) involved in completely removing the offending flavor is just too 
great.  Then he suggested replacing the serving line, but that didn't 
completely solve the problem.  It wasn't until the actual picnic tap handle 
was replaced, that we achieved satisfactory results.  It was a valuable and 
overly long lesson we learned, and I would hate to see my fellow brewsters 
travel that same road.


The moral of the story is:    Just bottle it (rootbeer)!!

A couple of observations: If you use the aquarium pump method, using the
airstone (even though it foams) may be desirable since it causes small
bubbles to percolate through the cooled wort., which reportedly causes
more uptake of the gases. The Brewing Techniques (BT) article on ways to
oxygenate/aerate your wort mentions the porosity of the airstones
effects the rate of oxygen uptake.


In the following month's Letter to the Editor column, a reader mentions
that he gets good results using his aquarium pump and airstone by
placing the fermentor in a plastic bin or tray and letting the foam exit
the fermentor and accumulate in the tray. Much of the foam, he reasons,
is cold break and this system works for him like a flotation tank. Many
commercial lager brewers reportedly use a flotation tank to remove some
cold break according to Dave Miller (Homebrewing Guide, Storey
Publications). They rack the freshly cooled wort into the tank, bubbling
air up through aeration stones placed in the bottom of the tanks, and
finally racking the beer through valves placed near the bottom of the
tank, leaving the foam (containing much of it cold break) behind.


Obviously, you could aerate longer this way and get more oxygen into
solution by letting the foam exit in some sanitary way. You would lose
some wort. I have personally switched to oxygenating with pure oxygen.
It is quick and easy. Anything that shortens my brew day is a good
thing. If you use the aquarium pump method, this may work well for you.


Glad the Home Brew Digest has found a good home!

Let's not forget that the after fermentation and prior to carbonation, the
beer is already saturated with CO2. I calculate that this is approximately
0.73 volumes of CO2 near room temperature. Thus, only an additional 1.27
volumes is needed to carbonate to 2 volumes. Thus, a 5 lb CO2 tank will
last for about 18 five gallon batches.


In my neck of the woods, a tank refill costs about $7.50, an almost
insignificant cost per batch, IMHO.

Subject: Re: Trivets and Heat Transfer (John Bowen)


David Conger (V2.42) asks about trivets under his brew pot.  I made a 
trivet from a heavy coathanger:  My burner is 7 1/2" dia, so I made the 
trivet as a simple square, 6 1/2" on side.  Its fits just fine and 
supports the kettle on the adequately.


But I don't use it!


As you pointed out, the purpose is to reduce scorching where the coils 
contact the bottom of the brew pot.  Unfortunately, from the stove's 
point of view, the purpose of the brewpot is to accept heat from the 
coils and keep them from overheating.  The trivet greatly interfers with 
this by slowing the heat transfer.  I had to keep my burner on "high" 
for the whole boil time, where I can use "8" without the trivet.  The 
surface of the stove became too hot to touch and the plastic parts 
started to stink.  I think this risks damage to the stove surface, if it 
is not a significant fire danger.


So I just put up with a little scorching for now until I can move to a 
gas cooker and/or an expensive pot with an aluminum sandwich bottom.  I 
wonder if a solid aluminum disk (say 1/4" thick) under the brewpot would 
transfer the heat fast and evenly enough to prevent scorching.  Anyone 
have any ideas on this?


Another thought:  I have purchased a "canning element" (ca. $40, should 
fit most (US) electric stoves).  It fits just like the regular element 
but it raises the element about 1" in the air, to allow better airflow
between the element and the stove top, which the manufacturer says is 
important when using large kettles.  The stove is definately cooler 
after a long boil.

Subject: Over-filling bottles...


I'd just like to state that it *is* possible to over-fill bottles. Over the
last year I've been decreasing the amount of head-space in my bottles to
help prevent oxydation. On my last batch, the head space was non-existant.


A few days after bottling, I noticed the bottle caps were bulging a bit. I
thought it was just my imagination and let them be. Well, yesterday I
noticed my shelving was a little sticky. :-) Sure enough, a bottle in the
back had broken, and beer had 'oozed' from under several bottle caps. I
opened, withdrew a 1/4" of beer with a syringe, and re-capped the hole lot.


I just wanted to bring this to the attention of the list. It looks like at
least *some* head space is required for the expansion of liquids as room
temperature varies (warmed liquid expands).... :-)

"At work we use these 6 gallon food safe plastic water jugs in our water

Yes, assuming you're able to keep them sanitary and you don't plan on
reusing them.  


"...but would it cause any harm if I used them for the Secondary
Fermenter as well?"


Again, treating these plastic carboys as one time use items may be save you
some money on the initial outley for glass carboys.  However, if you plan
to reuse the plastic carboys you may find problems when you try to clean
them.  I'm not sure of the reactions you may encounter with using Bleach or
Idophor with the plastic (I'm sure one of the many chemists lurking on this
Digest will chime in on that) but if you ever have to use a carboy brush it
you might scratch the interior of the plastic carboy.  These scratches may
become vacation homes for bacteria.  I'm not a chemist, but after the
effort and care I put into making a good batch I wouldn't want to
jeopardize it by trying to save the $20-40 for a couple of glass carboys.


"These jugs are tinted light blue, will this have any adverse  effect on my
brew?"  


Again, I'm not a chemist so if you must use them keep the carboy covered
from light.  That blue is for marketing water not the blue of "blue

Most of all I'm glad you're teaching your sons about beer and alchohol in

Subject: Keg Conditioning Beer


Hello to the New Digest!


I am in the process at the moment of moving to a totally
keg-oriented system. (I've broken enough carboys to last
a lifetime!) I'm using kegs for primary and secondary
fermentation, and serving from both kegs and bottles,
depending on the situation.


What I was interested in asking about was the process of
naturally carbonating in kegs; that is, "keg
conditioning." I've heard about using some kind of
diabetes kit from a pharmacy to measure the sugar
currently in a beer, so that you can rack it into a
sealed keg while the fermentation is not quite complete,
thereby carbonating "naturally," with no sugar added.


I was wondering if anyone who has had experience with
this method could enlighten us all on the procedures for
doing this, and how to calculate the right time to rack
(I sure wouldn't want a stainless steal keg to explode!)


Thanks,

Subject: Thermometers and Congrats!


Greetings Beerlings (What, did you copyright this Pat?)                         


I just got a digital thermometer for X-mas that's GREAT!  It's made by Poldar   
and quite a great tool.  It's designed for kitchen use and has a 3' long        
SS braided wire with a 6" long rigid probe.  The actual thermometer is a        
square base that is magnetized, the display is about 3" square and has the      
actual temp (32-400 or so degrees range), a programmable target temp with       
beeping alarm and a countdown timer, what more could an all grainer want?       
It's really designed for sticking in a roast as it cooks but works great        
for brewing.  I tested it in on ice water and boiling water and it was dead     
nuts right on.  I believe they are mail orderable from the chefs catalog,       
brookstone (check any mall) but I just found a kitchen store in Dearborn        
that has them for $25  (oops, $30 plus s/h if mail ordered)  I called their     
customer service and they sell extra probes for $10 (they just plug in to the   
base)  so you could potentially mount a probe in a stirriing paddle/spoon,      
in the flow of a recirc pump etc....                                            


CONGRATS!  Congratulations to Pat & Karl, I can vouch as a friend of Pats       
how much blood, sweat, & tears he has sunk in to this project. His love of      
beer & brewing is only rivalled by his love of computers and things of a        
techno nature (but but both pale in comparison to his love of family) and I     
have no doubt this digest will be kicking but well into the next century!       


I raise my mug to you sir Pat of Babcock, Janitor of the roundtable!            


Huzzah!

Subject:  Mash Yield Data for SUDS 4.0


After 25 extract batches, I
recently did my first all grain.
Thanks to all of the great
information I have received from
HBD and my local homebrew store,
everything went very well.  I
couldn't believe how clear it was
when I bottled.  Tasted great too!


For my second all grain batch, I
would like to use some Belgian
specialty malts (caramunich, and
aromatic) in the mash.  When I went
into the SUDS 4.0 program to
calculate the expected OG, IBU,
etc., I found that these malts (and
several others) are missing from
the malt table.  Where can I find a
listing of expected yields (in
points/pound/gallon I think) for
the various malts that are not
included in the SUDS 4.0 malt
table?


I am very happy with SUDS for
calculating expected OG, IBU and
mashing conditions.  Are there
other programs available that are
better for calculating this
information?  Is there a good
source for a complete listing of
expected malt yields?  If I can get
my hands on this information, I can
update the SUDS malt table to
include the grains I want to use.


TIA,
