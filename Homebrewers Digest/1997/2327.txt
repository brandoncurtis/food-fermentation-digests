Subject: Re: Oxycap questions


What is the straight scoop on Oxycaps?  By what mechanism do they work?  
Are they an O2 barrier or an O2 absorber?  I have heard that they 
contain ascorbic acid and become active when wet.  If so, how should one 
sanitize them to keep them from just absorbing atmospheric O2 before 
they go on the bottle?  Do the bottles need to be inverted for a while 
to bring the beer into contact with the cap?


And more importantly, are they really useful for bottle conditioned 
beer, as I anticipate that the live yeast will use most of the O2 in
the bottle, anyhow?  Has anyone done a taste comparison with bottle 
conditioned beer (filled 1/4" from the rim)?


TIA for the advice.   -John

Subject: Oxygenation speculations


Brewsters:


Craig Amundsen speculates that young yeast (he defines as less than 8 bud scars
 - and I define as not having been oxygenated)  are not the source of estery
beers, rather it is the creaky old cells breaking down that are the culprits.


How does your theory or WAG explain the floculation/oxygenation relationship
that I think exists with certain of the highly flocculant ale yeast?


Does anyone have information about ester formation rate as a function of time
elapsed in a fermentation?

M&BS says 2nd ed vol2 p 692:

the oxidative decaboxylation of alpha acetohydroxy acids to vicinal diketone*s*,
followed by the reduction to the corresponding diols. (Chapter 17).
***Essentially it involves intense yeast activity to *carbonate the beer*,

I remember reading somewhere, sometime,( can't guarantee the validity)  that
Heinehen is not actually skunked (in the light sensitive way) but that it is a

In-Reply-To: The letter of Thursday, 23 January 1997 11:15pm ET
 
HBD-
 
According to Charlie P. (page 254, NCJOHB), Alpha amylase degrades at 153F,
67C in two hours.  Beta amylase degrades between 40-60 minutes at 149F, 65C.
 
So, if I mash in at 158F (and I did have my mash pot insulated, but apparently
not very well), and the temp drifts to 140 over the course of 90 minutes, I
got some, but not much activity out of the beta amylase (realizing the b.
amylase will degrade even quicker since 158F is higher than 149F) since b.
amylase still has *some* activity at the higher temp.
 
At any rate, b.amylase deactivates twice as fast as a. amylase, which is fine
for me, as I hold no prejudices against a highly dextrinous wort.  If I were
trying to brew to style, I would be much AR about my mash temp profiles.  For
now, I'm still making stuff mucho better than the budmilloors guys, which may
be no great feat, but at least even my mistakes taste great (less filling]).
 
I guess it's time to start brewing stylistically true brews, and slow down on
the Coffee House Porters, PunkinHead Ales, and O.J. Honey Ambers.

This is from a recent J. Inst Brewing review article on mitochondria and oyxgen
in brewing.  It is an excerpt. WAGs are not for me. :-)


Jim
www.u.arizona.edu/~jliddil
***********************************
In a traditonal brewing fermentation, wort is cooled and aearted to 6-8 mg/L
DO.  Within 3 h of inoculation, all of this oxygen is removed from the wort. 
During this period, there is intensive lipid synthesis.  Of the oxygen
available to yeast at the time of inoculation, only 5-15% is used for sterol
synthesis, whilst another 15% is used for unsaturated fatty acid production. 
The remainder is reportedly consumed by reactions such as the oxidation of wort
components, CO2 stripping and biological reactions. Kirsop proved that under
his experimental conditons the first oxygen-consuming process was
insignificant.  CArbon dioxide stripping should not occur to any extent until
fermentation has progressed so the majority of the remaining oxygen not used
for lipid synthesis must be consumed by other biological reactions. These
observations have led some authors to suggest alternative roles for DO in the
yeast cell.


Oxygen has been identified as having some other roles in the yeast cell
although these roles are not given the same relative importance as its
participation in unsaturated lipid formation.  These alternate roles include
oxygen participation in porphyrin and heme biosynthesis, the regulation of a
number of yeast genes, the ring cleavage of proline, the uptake of some
carbohydrates and the differentiation of promitochondira to mitochondria. It is
highly likely that many as yet unidentified roles of oxygen exist.  In the
presence of inhibitors that functioned to block fatty acid desaturation and
ergesterol formation, the provision of dissolved oxygen led to enhanced yeast
growth and faster assimilable nitrogen uptake.  Blocking the unsaturated lipid
production significantly decreased yeast growth and caused over production of
stress factors indicating yeast in poor overall condition.  It is obvious that
yeast unsaturated lipid formation is likely the major role of oxygen in the
brewing fermentation but it is not the only role.  CONVERSLEY, too much oxygen
has now been proven to NOT be a safegaurd against yeast degeneration BUT TO
DIRECTLY CAUSE IT.  The optimised supply of oxygen is critical to the brewer. 
However to truly optimise the supply one must know where and how it is
utilised.....

Jeff, this is the 2nd trial, the first message is rejected because the

therefore, I try to explain it via a German example: I am shure that you
know how to prononctiate the name of the city of Koeln. I cannot write it
with te O with two dots on it, otherwise the wessage will not go trough.
If you replace the ueu from gueuze with the German O wih two dots on it, and
you pronounce that "O" a bit longer,than it's OK. You may end with S, or ZE,
not Z, ( it's depending of the local area here, in the French and Flemisch
speaking part they say Geueze, in Brussels dialect, it's Gueus.


Do you know what the word Gueuze means? It is the old Flemisch word for
"GEUS, Geuzen = plurial" this are men who did not agree with the laws of the
church (Cardinals). It happened in Flanders a 500 years ago (when we where

Subject: Re: Quality of cold break with immersion chillers?


Stuart was asking about the effectiveness of removing cold break with 
an immersion cooler, and was particularly interested in not adding 
extra work to his brewing process.
   The immersion cooler will make a reasonable removal of cold break 
if you filter it through a hop bed.  Cold break works best with a 
sudden shift in temperature.  Should you wish to enhance your cold 
break, you can always brew to a higher O.G. than wished, and then add 
cold water just as you start cooling.
  The bottom line is how much cold break to remove?  I thought I had 
the answer to that question based on my own experience.  I have been 
amazed however at the lengths at which people have been going to to 
remove it, and decided to test this question once again.  This time I 
have used an independent blind tasting panel.   It turns out that what 
you like, is what you like.  I find no consistant pattern in what is 
preferred, however a consistancy within the same taster from one 
occasion to the other.
   I have one more experiment series fermenting in the cellar now, and 
should be happy to report to you when completed.
    In short- Yes, an immersion cooler can remove a large portion of 
the cold break.  Your own taste may determine whether you want more or 
less of it removed.

I use a .22 rifle cleaning rod with a small square of "Scotch Brite" (tm)
on the end.  I actually just push it through instead of threading it into
any rifle cleaning tools.  I also soaked my kegs, when they were new,
in warm water with a large handful of baking soda to get rid of any
odors of the original contents.  Not wanting to take any chances, I
replaced all of the "O" rings, too.


Just as an aside, Wayne Waananen took first place with his "Hi-Res
Root Beer" recipe in the Herb Beer catagory in the 1987 National
Homebrew Competition.  It's in the Winners Circle booklet from the
American Homebrewers Assn.  "Barq's Beer" may not be too bad. #%^)
If you're interested in the recipe and can't find the booklet drop me 
a line and I'll type it up for you.  (Hi, Wayne!  Hope your new job
at "Five Star" is going well.)

Subject:  Mash Yield Data for SUDS 4.0


After 25 extract batches, I
recently did my first all grain.
Thanks to all of the great
information I have received from
HBD and my local homebrew store,
everything went very well.  I
couldn't believe how clear it was
when I bottled.  Tasted great too!


For my second all grain batch, I
would like to use some Belgian
specialty malts (caramunich, and
aromatic) in the mash.  When I went
into the SUDS 4.0 program to
calculate the expected OG, IBU,
etc., I found that these malts (and
several others) are missing from
the malt table.  Where can I find a
listing of expected yields (in
points/pound/gallon I think) for
the various malts that are not
included in the SUDS 4.0 malt
table?


I am very happy with SUDS for
calculating expected OG, IBU and
mashing conditions.  Are there
other programs available that are
better for calculating this
information?  Is there a good
source for a complete listing of
expected malt yields?  If I can get
my hands on this information, I can
update the SUDS malt table to
include the grains I want to use.

C'mon with the drilling stainless problems. Put a drill in a hand drill.
If you want, and I suggest you do, center punch it. I also suggest step
drilling it, from small to large. They sell something called a unibit,
its a drill that rises in 1/16 increments and it drills a beautiful

because, according to some british transplant friends of mine, it's apparently
not produced any more.  al k notes this also.  one of my friends  told me
that when he was still living in britain, worthington was available as
real ale.  i'm not sure how many years ago it was, but he claims that when it
was well kept, it was outstanding.  it tended to be quite fragile, though, and
if not kept well, it would go "off" quickly.  that's all i know.  i never had
the pleasure of trying it. in either style.

it is possible to express extraction in points per pound per gallon. for 
example, if you used 10 pounds of pale malt and got 5 gallons of wort at
a starting gravity of 1.060, this means you got 


                5*60/10 = 30 points/lb/gal  (or, points*gal/lb)


while this is useful, it's even more useful when also using a "maximum" figure
of extraction for different types of grist material.  some homebrew books list
the "maximum" amount of extract for different types of malt and adjuncts.


the reason this is important is because it gives you a "brewhouse efficiency"
that is the result of your equipment and technique.  this efficiency can
be used to predict the starting gravity of a recipe.  this is most likely to
be successful for beers that use roughly the same amount of grist, i.e. you
won't get the same efficiency for a barley wine as you do for a bitter, 
because you have to stop sparging with considerable sugar left in the lauter
tun on the high gravity styles.  
                                     
for example:  a pilsner using all 2-row pils malt will have a "maximum" extract 
of about 35 points/lb/gal.  this is based on one of dave miller's books.
for 100% efficiency, the recipe should contain (48*5)/35 = 6.86 pounds of pils 
malt.  


a steam beer, however, using a 7:1 ratio of 2-row pils malt to crystal malt, 
will have a "maximum" extract of [(7*35)+(1*24)]/8 = 33.625 points/lb/gal.  
(24 points/lb/gal is the "maximum" for crystal malt.)  for 100% efficiency, you 
would need 48*5/33.625 = 7.14 total pounds of grist.  for a 7:1 ratio, this 
would be 0.89 lb of crystal and 6.25 lb of pils malt.


if your "brewhouse efficiency" is 85%, in the first case for a starting 
gravity of 1.048, you will achieve .85*35 = 29.75 points/lb/gal.  this 
means you need to use 5*48/29.75 = 8.07 pounds of pils malt. (note that all you
really have to do, *if you know your brewhouse efficiency*, is just divide the 
"maximum" recipe grist quantity by your brewhouse efficiency, in this case, 
6.86/.85 = 8.07.)
 


in the second case, for 85% efficiency, you would get .85*33.625 = 28.58
points/lb/gal.  this is the average extraction for the ratio of malts in the 
"maximum" extraction recipe.  so, the total amount of grist required is
(48*5)/28.58 = 8.4 lb.  for a 7:1 ratio of pils to crystal, this comes out
to 8.4/8 = 1.05 lb of crystal, and (7/8)*8.4 = 7.35 lb of pils.


but note that, similar to the pils recipe, you can simply divide each grist 
type quantity by your brewhouse efficiency to get the same results:
pils = 6.25lb/.85 = 7.35 lb; crystal = .89 lb/.85 = 1.05 lb.




you have to have a set of "maximum" numbers for each grist type, and you have
to be able to calculate your actual points per pound per gallon, in order to
come up with a brewhouse efficiency.  once you do that, you can predict 
starting gravities as accurately as your brewhouse efficiency represents your
real performance.  mine varies from 84 to 87 per cent for recipes like the
ones above.  this means for gravities in the 1.048 range, i'm as much as a
couple of points off.  i can usually get within a point, though. 


there are many different things that determine your brewhouse efficiency and
affect its reliability.  it's useful to look at past recipes where you plan
on using the same types of raw materials and the same techniques and 
equipment.  and , as stated earlier, the gravities need to be in the same
ballpark.  generally, as your target gravity goes up, your brewhouse efficiency
will go down.


this probably bored a lot of you advanced guys, but it's helpful i think for
brewers just getting into all grain because it gives them a way to predict 
starting gravity of a recipe, starting with the second time around.

Subject: No Head!


Hello fellow homebrewers,
        I am having a perplexing problem! My last two batches (a brown ale
and a porter) have had very little carbonation. There is no head, a very
little fiss when you pop open a bottle, and it tastes a little flat. The
perplexing part is that I prime the beer the exact same way at least a
dozen times and have never had this problem before. 
        I use 3/4 cup of corn sugar and boil it in a cup of water for 10
minutes. Then add it to the bottling bucket when racking 5 gallons of
beer. Can someone give me a clue? Is there a way to recarbonate the flat
beer I have now?

Gavin Scarman asks about the Wyeast Weihenstephan (3068) giving the

reminiscent of a good Weizen. If you haven't tried it yet, you should
definitely give it a shot. Be prepared for vigorous fermentation, and

Along these lines, I have experimented with hop tea in a somewhat different
form.  I suspended the hops in water in a fruit canning jar, closed it up,
and pressure cooked it about a half hour.  Presumably the hop acids are
maximally converted and the aroma is locked into the sealed jar.  The
resulting tea can be added to the cooled brew like dry hoppping with
allowance for the greater bittering effect.  This seems to work but it would
take a bit of doing to quantify how much bittering and aroma effect is
obtained.

Hi all,


        I have been enjoying reading the digest for the last 6 months 
now and have been getting a lot of good info out of it as well as 
being utterly confused at times :), but I guess that's what learning 
is all about.


I have been brewing for about a year now, my first 5 or 6 batches 
being of the kit and corn sugar variety, the last few batches I have 
moved on to brewing with extract with pretty good results so far. 


This christmas past I recieved a Munton & Fison Blonde kit and being 
anxious to get it started (as all my carboys were empty, and the beer 
supply was getting low) I went out to get some DME from my local brew 
shop, unfortunately it was closed till after new years, I went to 
anither place and to make a long story short the owner convinced me 
to buy 3 lbs of high maltose syrup instead of DME. 


I just tasted my first bottle last night (a bit premature, but as I 
said the supply was getting low) and the initial taste was pretty 
fair but the aftertaste left a lot to be desired. It's hard to 
describe but it felt as if it left a coating on the roof of your 
mouth, and a real dry aftertaste. 


Anyhow I'm wondering if anyone who has used maltose syrup before can 
comment on this. I _don't_ plan on using it again!!

Subject: Bitterness, Thanks Pat


Brewsters:


The other day, I suggested to an HBDer that increasing the hardness of his water
and specifically adding calcium and magnesium sulfate to his beer might increase
his friends' perception of what they call "bitterness".  


AlK commented that it wasn't the cations of calcium or magnesium but rather just
the sulfate that was the active ingredient.  I intended to respond but forgot
until I saw the following comment by John Pyles, a salt maker:
 
> Some marketers put out a low grade salt (not washed well) or add magnesium to
> make a "sea" salt.  Most producers do their best to remove any **magnesium**
> because it tends to make the salt taste **bitter.**  


** emphasis is mine


Also, on p 844 M&BS 2nd ed vol 2:


"...Bitter(1) is evoked by hydrophobic amino acids and alkaloids at the front of
the tongue, while Bitter(2) is produced by magnesium sulfate, phenolics,and
presumably iso-alpha-acids at the rear of the tongue."


Magnesium sulfate is used as a standard as one of the substances to evoke
bitterness in tasters.  Its taste threshold is 4.6X10^ -3 M or 5.54 X10^ -2%. op
cit p848.  Rather than salty, magnesium sulfate only tastes bitter op cit p 849.


Perhaps you recall my story some months ago which related how one of my British
friends on the way home from a youthfully exhuberant drinking session in a pub
suffered the effects of high levels of Magnesium Sulfate ( perhaps to reduce the
cost of the hops or non-availability)  in beer produced during the second world
war.  AlK is correct, too much magnesium sulfate and your beer will "go through
you like a dose of salts".  And you thought Epsom Salts was only good to bathe
your feet in . Read the box.

of days.


No, you will never explode a keg since their WORKING pressure is 130
psi.  As long as you let the krauesen fall before racking to
secondary, and check on the pressure every couple of days, the most
you could do would be to overcarbonate the beer.  


If you goof on how much sugar is left on the low side, then you may
have to force carbonate, on the high side, and the relief valve, or
manual relief will take care of it.  Sugar measurements are
unnecessary unless you just *want* to.  Besides what do you think a
hydrometer is for, a fancy Xmas tree ornament?  You have a cheap,
accurate way of measuring sugar content already, unless you don't
happen to have a hydrometer.

        Worthington White Shield was, and still is bottle conditioned.
I cannot find reference to White Label in either Protz or Jackson.

Subject: The moral of the story is:    Just bottle it (rootbeer)!!


In the article about rootbeer, I realized how great the wealth of
information is that I get from this digest.  My children have been bugging
me to make a batch of rootbeer for quite a while now.  Glad to find out
what to look out for.  I'm reminded of the following quote:
"The un-wise man will repeat mistakes.  The smart man will learn from his
mistakes.  The wise man will learn from other peoples mistakes."  - Quoted
from an episode of the Commish.


While on the topic of rootbeer,  What is the best/easiest way to make up a
batch.  I have never done it and have only brewed from extracts up to this
point.


Thanks

That's exactly what I did. Pour, clog, rinse, pour, clog, rinse -- 45 mins.
I bet your strainer is bigger than mine. Now I feel inadequate. Thanks
anyway Matt.
