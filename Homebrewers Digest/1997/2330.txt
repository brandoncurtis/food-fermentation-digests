     I say this whole Big Headed Ego brewer shit is really starting to get 
     on my nerves. None of us, and I mean NONE OF US! (are you listening 
     Al, Dave, John) are above learning from any member of this forum. 
     
     I have been brewing for a long time. Probably longer than many of you 
     out there but I  am still learning about homebrewing methods and 
     equipment everyday. you know what? Sometimes I even learn from extract 
     brewers, or god forbid  first timers. 
     
     Get off your damn high horses and stop turning into big headed asses!
     
     What are a bunch of Newbies doing here Al? They are trying to ask 
     questions and learn how to brew as well as you do (and you do brew 
     very well). Without all of the long time brewers helping the newbies 
     the hobby will become a bunch of secretive bad tempered "Good Old 
     Boys". The whole point of this digest is for people to learn more 
     about every aspect of the hobby and despite the fact that I think I 
     personally know everything 
     
     I DON'T!
     
     and neither does anybody else in this forum. If we did, we wouldn't be 
     here.
     
     Although I tend not to post often, I still get a ton of very good 
     information from the HBD. 
     
     What might appear to be useless info to any one of you is somewhere 
     helping someone else make a much better beer... 
     
     Have you ever stopped to think of that..? Have any one of you ever 
     taken the time to look at any one of your rambling nasty ass put down 
     posts to some poor brewer that just asked a simple brewing question or 
     made a brewing mistake that was to you all so obvious? Have you ever 
     stopped to think that after making that brewer feel so bad about the 
     methods that he used or the mistakes that they made they have since 
     never brewed again because they were convinced that they couldn't 
     brew?
     
     Without new brewers, without seasoned brewers, without extract, 
     partial, all-grain and innovative brewers there can be no turnover of 
     knowledge and the learning process stops. Look at the AHA, that is 
     what they have become. Do you want to become that too? I hear they are 
     hiring.
     
     An HBD for newbies would be great only if there were advanced brewers 
     to hold their hands and teach them to brew better beer. These people 
     are not lepers, they are merely seeking the knowledge and experience 
     that some of us have. Don't cast them off to some island to live by 
     themselves. Teach them to brew for crying out loud! Make them a better 
     brewer than yourself. Encourage them to go all grain. Show them the 
     ways of PLAID but
     
     TEACH THEM DAMN IT!!!
     
     This forum is all about learning. Again, let us not forget that fact. 
     We learn through calm discussion, moderate and sometimes very heated 
     but we are still here to learn and don't ever forget that.

Actually, you can ferment out a sample, taken after pitching, at a
higher
temperature (75F-80F) for a good approximation what the FG of the 
batch will be.

Subject: Decoction Mashing


In my continuing quest to develop an efficient decoction routine for 
my Czech Pils and German Helles/Bock/Fest beers I did a double 
decoction batch this past weekend. It was a Bavarian Pils with mostly 
Durst Pils malt and a little Carapils dextrin.


I decided to use the oven to help maintain the decoctions at rest 
temperatures. This worked so well, I decided to extend the idea. I 
turned the oven up to 225F and once I got a strong boil of the decoc 
going on the burner, I covered the SS pot and put it in the oven. I 
checked 5 minutes later, and it was merrily boiling away with no 
scorching or sticking. So I ended up doing my 30 minute boils in the 
oven.  Checked once in the middle of the boils to make sure it wasn't 
scorching and to stir. Seemed to work great.


Now a question. I just re-read Richman's Bock book. He has a lot of 
good info on decoction mashing. In his discussion of the formation of 
melanoidins he emphasizes that the malty aroma/flavor melanoidins 
from the combination of the amino acids valine and leucine with 
simple sugars, will only occur once 212F is reached. I brew at 5000+ 
feet where the boiling point of water is only 200F. My stove top 
decoction boils stick at 200F. Will that hinder me in producing these 
melanoidins? Maybe I should crank the oven up some more.


Cheers!

Subject: Clad vs. Unclad


I just bought a 10 gallon Vollrath brew kettle from Precision Brewing
Systems.


I was told this was one of the best available. It does not have an
alluminum "clad" bottom but, instead, the alluminum was apparantly
"sprayed" on and then machined down to a smooth surface. It is hard to tell
exactly how thick the bottom of the pot is. My question is this: Should I
return the pot and hold out for one with an alluminum clad bottom or am I
being a worry-wart. Is the pot I have the best?


Please respond to simtech`at`compuserve.com


Thanks!

Subject: Filtering Cold Break


Greetings Fellow Beer Lovers,


I'm confused about cold break and whether I'm actually
removing it or not.


My normal procedure is to cool with an immersion chiller
and then pour the cooled wort through a mesh kitchen strainer
into my carboy.  I didn't whirpool or siphon because I use whole
hops and that seemed impractical and slow.  Plus, if I siphoned
instead of strained, I wouldn't aerate the wort as much and my
ferments would be slower.


But, in HBD 2327, Jeff Irvine mentions that using an immersion
cooler will make reasonable removal of cold break if you filter it
through a hop bed.  Which is exactly what I do when I dump wort
into my strainer.  After the first scoop, the whole hops line the
strainer and the remaining wort filters through the hops as I
dump it in.


So, am I actually doing any beneficial cold break removal, or
should I move on to whirlpooling experiments? (btw, my beer
isn't bad, but I am interested in legitimate process improvements.)


Thanks.

Subject: Re: No Head, Re: Lacking Carbonation ...


Several posts about no carbonation.  I had this trouble.  Now I keg and
force carbonate, problem gone.  When I couldn't get my bottled conditioned
beers to carbonate, my local brewers, homebrew shops, etc..., acted as if
they had never heard of such a thing and only suggestion was maybe I got
them infected.  From what I had heard, however, infection makes a gusher
(not an accurate discription of the problem).  I was begining to think that
my sanitizing operations were to blame.  I even wondered if I had acutally
added my boiled and cooled priming sugar or could it have been a container
of sanitizer?  But in reviewing my brewing log, I discovered that the
batches that would not carbonate had spent a considerable amount of time
(three weeks or so) in the secondary.  I assumed that too much yeast had
settled and that I needed to let my problem batches condition some more.
After a month or more, they were fine.  If I am going to bottle now, I
*always* jab the racking cane in the yeast cake a couple of times and watch
the yeast flow through.  Not much, but a little.  Just in case.  With
bottled batches, I haven't had this problem since starting this parctice.


Don't throw out your beer because of this, particularly if it tastes OK,
only flat.  Let them sit some more.  You couldn't have removed all of the
yeast.  Keep the bottles warm, but not hot (68-74F) and be patient.  It's
well worth the wait.

I don't clip my dip tubes.  I find that after the small amount of
yeast remaining in the beer settles, that I suck up a little bit from
around the bottom of the tube, and then the beer runs clear.


Try adding some gelatin to your fermenter to drop the yeast the day
before you rack to the keg: sprinkle the contents of one envelope of
unflavored gelatin on 1/4 cup of *cold* water.  Wait 10 minutes.  Then
add boiling water to make 1 cup.  Stir until dissolved (almost
instantaneously).  Pour into the carboy and swirl gently.  Watch the
beer clarifly like magic.

Subject: Yeast doing summersaults




I had a strange experience two or three weeks ago with some yeast that I had
stored from the sediment of a secondary. 


Some of you will recall that I asked about the viability of the yeast at the
bottom of all those beer bottles that we carbonate by priming. The responses
I got then indicated that those yeast cells were merely dormant and happy to
be called back into action.


So I took this a step further and with a recent brew: after I had transfered
the beer out of the secondary into the bottling bucket, I swirled the
remainder of the secondary and bottled the entire sludge mess into a
sanitized champagne bottle, capped it, labeled it, and stashed it in my brew
closet. The bottle was filled to within about 2 inches from the top.  After
a few days everything settled out so that about 30% of the content of the
bottle was yeast, the rest beer. I figured that any residual activity would
give a slight carbonation. 


Well, during a recent brew session I was looking forward to drinking that
beer just prior to pitching this yeast.  But here is the strange part:  when
I uncapped the bottle all the yeast lifted off the bottom and ended up on
the surface of the beer, some of it erupting out of the bottle. There was
quite a bit of pressure in the bottle, but not a lot of carbonation in the
beer that I could see.  How is it possible that the release of pressure
allowed the yeast to all of a sudden start to float?


I was bummed out by this for two reasons: (1) the beer was now all cloudy
(Sorry, but I hate drinking yeasty beer) and (2) I figure the sudden change
in pressure must have killed the little guys so that they were now all
"belly-up" floating on the surface.  Since I had no back-up yeast ready, I
pitched as much of this yeast as I could.  well, everything worked out
pretty well - I had pretty good activity within a few hours.


I'm going to do this again in the future because bottling a "ton" of
sediment is much less work then stepping up the yeast from scratch. I might
be inclined to do some "yeast washing" but that sure sounds like a lot of
work for little gain.


Anyway,... why would the yeast do this strange summersault?  It doesn't
happen when I open a regular beer bottle (there the sediment stays parked on
the bottom).


Also, only slightly related: It seems that there are some posts occasionally
that suggest that the sediment in primary and secondary fermenters contains
many dead cells.  A few days ago I placed wort directly into a fermenter
without removing the (10 day old; Wyeast Koelsch yeast) sediment.  I swear,
there is currently nothing on the bottom of that fermenter: every one of
those "dead" cells is back in action.  I've never seen my airlock bubble so
fast.

Subject: Re: Esters & Oxygenation


My friend David Burley writes ... (Hi David) ...
> Does anyone have information about ester formation rate as a function of time
> elapsed in a fermentation?


In a paper in JIB V100, 1994 pp 321- by Douglas A. Gee and W.Fred
Ramirez of U.Colorado at Boulder titled "A Flavor Model for Beer
Fermentation" - there is a development of formulae to model amino acid
and sugar uptake, fusel alcohol, ester, VDK and acetaldehyde production
and yeast mass.  The parameters for these models are experimentally
determined to fit some sample fermentations which they have
instrumented.  For the three esters modeled we have ...


Ethyl Acetate (fruity solvent smell) [EA]: Arising from enzymatic
esterification of ethanol and acetyl-CoA.  They model the intracellular
concentrations as proportional to the sugar uptake or EA' = -y *
(G'+M'+N'),  where the single quote denotes the derivative with respect
to time.  EA is the ethyl-acetate conc. G, M and N represent Glucose,
Maltose and maltotriose concentrations.  This constant (with respect to
time) "y" seems to rise rapidly with temperature in their experimental
data.


Ethyl-Caproate (apples)[EC]: is generated from a reaction of ethanol and
caproyl-CoA. Caproyl-CoA is an intermediate product in the fatty acid
anabolic and catabolic pathways and is the limiting rate factor.  The
activity of the fatty acid synthesis and breakdown is related to the
cell growth so EC' = y * X', where X is the yeast mass.


The third ester considered is Isoamyl-Acetate (bannana ester) [IA]:
which results from a reaction of isoamyl alcohol [IAA] and acetyl-CoA in
the cell.  The concentration of isoamyl alcohol is considered to be rate
limiting (since Acetyl-CoA is abundant) so : IA' = y * IAA' * X, where
the IAA' term can be further reduced.  The rate of IAA formation IAA' is
due to a synthetic mechanism related to the yeast growth rate X' and
limited at high Leucine levels, and also due to an 'Ehrlich mechanism'
which term which is proportional to the Leucine uptake rate -L' .


The above is my restatement of portions of the Gee and Ramirez paper,
I'll take the blame for any typos or misinterpretations.  Gee and
Ramirez and their references deserve credit for the model development.


In the portion of the experimental data shown, all three esters increase
at a roughly constant rate and then the formation slows.  EA and EC
formation slows as the fermentable sugars are exhausted and yeast growth
ceases.  IA formation stalls as leucine is nearly exhausted.  The
modeled results for esters, VDK and acetaldehyde are fairly good, the
results for sugar uptake amino acid uptake and fusel alcohol production
seem extremely good.  Temperature and yeast strain dependence is not
addressed in this paper.  Only these important three of the 90 or so
esters are in beer are modeled.


I'm afraid that the best advice regarding esters levels and oxygenation,
pitching rates, cold trub and available FAN is that it all depends on
the specific ester you are considering and its formation mechanisms. 
Generalizations that ignore formation mechanisms of the fusel alcohols
or the various acetyl CoA compounds aren't likely to be very revealing.


Andy Walsh and Tracy Aquilla were involved in an HBD exchange last June
culminating in a referenced note on ester formation by Andy in HBD #2080
which also appears at "The Brewery' website.  Andy's note includes
specifics that contradict some of the simple extrapolations that one is
tempted to draw from the equations of Gee and Ramirez.  


One confusing point made by Andy and M&BS as well, is that "Acetyl CoA
plays a key role in growth .... hence any restriction of cell growth
will elevate acetate esters, by increasing the the availability of
Acetyl CoA ..." implying that Acetyl CoA is less available for ester
formation during 'unrestricted' yeast growth.  I don't understand why
this should be so except in the case of oxygen restriction of cell
growth where the metabolic processes require more Acetyl CoA.  Does
growth restriction by carbohydrate or lipid or amino acid limitation
also increase Acetyl CoA and esterification ??

Subject: I know there was a head


I have a quite dark weizen (used too dark a 'dark malt'), which is almost
porter-like. At 2 weeks it had a great head, at 3 the head was ok and at 4
well there's no head. However there is a lot of corbonation, too much in
fact. I suspect this was a stuck fermentation tho it finished about 1.013.
It's almost coke-like in it's large bubbles with a head that quickly
dissappears. My question is why did the head retention fade with excess
carbonation?

   I think I know where our techniques differ.  I use a 8-10 inch strainer

Congratulations on your purchase of liquid yeast (presumably your first).
Your "most expensive batch" will be greatly improved because of it.
Wyeast 1084, Irish Ale, is a strong fermenter.  You need to pay close
attention to your headspace.  A colleague of mine recently blew the lid off
his 7 gallon plastic primary using this yeast.  He had 2 gallons of headspace]
(He did not use a blow-off - his bubbler became plugged).
A batch I have going right now blew foam out the blow-off for two days before
settling down.  Use a large blow-off tube and check it often during the first
few days to be sure it is unobstructed.
As far as the lack of black patent- that may be the reason you did not like
Guinness- they use black patent.  My personal preferance is to use twice the
amount of roasted or chocolate barley instead of black patent.  That will give
youcomparable bitterness and color without the charcoal bite.

Just one datapoint.  I brewed an extract batch of wheat beer
using YL Bavarian Wheat yeast, stepped it up twice with starters,
pitched and fermented at 60 degrees.  I used a secondary, then
racked to keg where it currently resides at 55 degrees.  LOTS OF
CLOVES.  Time has somewhat mellowed out the clove but it is still
very pronounced.  I'm not sure how much if any banana there is in
it.  I've eaten bananas but really don't like drinking them (i.e.
milkshakes etc...), so it must not be too pronounced.  Next batch
I am going to increase the fermentation temp. a few degrees to
try to get more of a tart taste to complement the clove (it's a
personal preference thing - why else would I homebrew!).

I've been brewing beer from extracts for about two years with pretty decent 
success.  But with the last few batches I've noticed that the beer becomes 
cloudy after chilling.  The beer is very clear in the bottle and is clear 
if it is chilled for less than 24 hours or so.  However, if I leave it in 
the fridge for a couple of days or more, it becomes cloudy.  To my 
recollection this hasn't happened in my previous batches.  Any ideas?  I am 
using a small amount of Irish Moss in the last 10 minutes of the boil and 
have done so for quite a while.  There aren't any off odors or tastes that 
would indicate contamination.  I have recently moved to a new residence so 
perhaps the water is the reason...  Any suggestions of things I could try?  
I might go with bottled water next batch to see if that helps.

Rye in a total grain bill of 11 lbs (some crystal, some carapils, some

I didn't see any jumping going on by anyone, just commenting. As I recall
though, you said that magnesium didn't contribute to the bitterness, just the
sulfate.

To prove his point, AlK did a one of a kind experiment in the following way:

I posted from M&BS as part of the discussion, with no intent to harm or
disparage Al's contribution:

>


Translating this theshold to Al's ppm terms:


5.54 X 10 ^ -2 % is 0.055 %  = 0.000554 g /g of solution or 554 ppm of magnesium
sulfate or about 100 ppm of magnesium if we assume the standard is not Epsom
salts, but rather the anhydrous magnesium sulfate. This is just about what Al
ran and didn't find it to be bitter. If the standard is Epsom Salts with 7
waters of crystallization ( which I doubt) then this reported threshold  level
is about 50 ppm. Whether it is valid to calculate the contribution from the
magnesium by simply assuming that it is a weight for weight contribution by
magnesium and sulfate, I doubt it.


Al comments that he doesn't disagree that magnesium sulfate contributes to
bitterness, just that magnesium sulfate is below the taste threshold, based on
his experiment. He comments that the magnesium ion content of Burton water is
less than his experiment. 


It may be that, since the sense of bitterness for magnesium sulfate and for hops
are both felt in the back of the tongue and mouth  (bitter (2)) , that even
though the magnesium may be below the threshold, it still contributes to the
sense of bitterness if this sensation is in any way additive to the hops'  (or
for that matter sulfate) contribution.  If this were the case, then even though
both the hops and magnesium sulfate may individually be below the threshold, the
combo may be above it and the taster senses bitterness.  Also, the relative
contribution of magnesium and sulfate to bitterness is still unknown (at least
by me) given the little I have read on this subject.  Are there any  experiments
in which sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate are used to evaluate the relative
contribution of magnesium and sulfate?  How about magnesium sulfate and
magnesium chloride mixtures?   Any comments?

Well, that may have been the reference. Could this be formed in hops drying?
Would pasteurization somehow contribute to the formation of the prenyl
mercaptan? Hard to believe since the wort is boiled. Being a photochemist, a
non-photochemical reaction makes more sense to me in this particular instance,
given what appears to be a lack of light. I know PU has a similar( but not the
same) problem.  I too had a good Pilsner Urquell just recently.  Same green
bottle.    A plain chemical source seems to make more sense to me than skunking
by light inside a package. OTOH, why doesn't it show up in Holland if it is
formed in the hops drying stage. Is it the decomposition, over time, of
something that is forming a mercaptan? The only factor that I can see that is
common beside green bottles is Saaz hops and a long time from brewing to
drinking.  I'm still mystified.

I personally do not use a secondary fermenter when making an ale unless I

outweighed by the risk of contamination during transfer and the time
involved. 


Your wort should clear at 65 deg. If you like using a secondary, that's
okay but my concern is your ale yeast will become inactive before its time
at temps below 60 deg. An experience I had while bottle conditioning an ale
at 50 deg. resulted in no carbonation until I conditioned them at 65 deg.
for a couple of weeks. I then stored them colder. 


The sediment should settle well. Its very nice to see a bright beer at
bottling time with hopes that you will keep this sediment to a minimum but
I'm not sure the amount of sediment at the bottom of a well conditioned ale
has any effect on flavor.

I don't have an answer, but am interested in this thread because just
before Christmas I had a milk stout that wouldn't carbonate in the keg.  I
force carbonate, keeping the CO2 attached at 12 psi at all times.
Typically it takes a few days before a keg carbonates fully.  The two other
kegs in the same refrigerator (a bitter and an Oktoberfest) and also
attached to the same 15 lb CO2 tank with a manifold carbonated nicely, but
the stout never carbonated after several weeks.  No head, no bubbles
visible in the beer, and tasting very flat.  I checked for leaks, made sure
CO2 was getting into the keg, swapped the gas-in lines between the kegs,
swapped the liquid-out lines between faucets, made sure the manifold really
was on, etc.  Nada.  After about a month I finally just hooked the keg up
to my 5 lb CO2 tank and kept it at about 20 psi... where it carbonated
properly after several days, and continued to dispense correctly at that
pressure.  Meanwhile, the two other kegs sitting right next to it in the
refrigerator were almost over carbonated at 12 psi.


Since then (and before this mysterious batch) other kegs hooked up to my
kegging system have worked fine at 12 psi.  The milk stout was all-grain,
and I had followed the same recipe about a year earlier with no kegging
problem. I still don't know what caused this.

With regards to magnesiums laxative effects, I haven't done all of the

and Gilman's The Pharmacologic Basis of Therapeutics indicates that a 
40mEq dose of magnesium is sufficient to produce a laxative effect.  
Since magnesium is a divalent cation, this would correspond to a dose of 
40mMol.  I don't have the molecular weight with me to calculate the 
milligram dose that would be required.  Anybody else care to take it

Subject: RE: Filtration, carbonation, and head retention/Freshman HBD


     Hi all,
     
     It has been pondered here that filtration can hurt a beer's ability to 
     form and hold a head, and that filtration (and force carbonation) can 
     also cause those large fish-eye bubbles.
     
     Filtering does strip protein from beer, and can be over done, but you 
     can formulate recipes to compensate.  One reason a beer like 
     budmilloors has poor head retention and no body is because it has so 
     little protein in it to begin with!  The use of adjuncts like corn and 
     rice lowers the protein content of the beer, thus lightening body, and 
     killing the head.
     
     Many fine, commercial beers are filtered, and demonstrate great head 
     retention and have full body.  They also have nice, fine bead 
     carbonation.
     
     In my experience, it is difficult (if not impossible) to tell the 
     difference between force carbonated beers and bottle conditioned ones 
     based on bubble observation.  All display fine bubbles as long as they 
     have been given adequate conditioning time and are served below 60F 
     (15.5C).
     
     I think carbonation becomes rough at higher temps or short 
     conditioning times because the CO2 is leaving solution so quickly that 
     it can form larger bubbles regardless of protein content.

Subject: dip tube summary/barleywines


First off, thanks to everyone for their suggestions on cleaning dip
tubes.  The most common suggestion was to use a rifle brush that fits
inside the tube.  Such a brush should be available wherever ammo is
sold.  A rod (also available where quality ammo and other
explosive-propelled projectiles are sold) would also probably be needed
to push the brush through.  Another suggestion was to use a bent wire
coat hanger with some cloth (or a piece of cleaning pad).  One person
suggested soaking the tubes along with everything else inside a keg
filled with a TSP solution.  Since I had decided use TSP to clean my
rootbeer-smelling kegs anyway, this way seemed the easiest for me, and
that's what I did.  A rifle brush seems like a good idea for future
cleanings though, and since I've never cleaned a gun before, I would
never have thought of it!  Ah, the power of sharing ideas...  I now
have clean, shiny, neutral-smelling kegs, and not a drop of beer to put
in them.  This problem I can solve by myself though. :)


Now onto a new question.  A couple weeks ago I brewed a barleywine
(about 2 and a quarter gallons) that was pitched with a 500ml starter
of Wyeast 1056.  It fermented well for one week at about 65F, at which
point it had slowed considerably and I moved it to a secondary.  The
gravity was about 1.026 from an OG of 1.085 or so.  It bubbled well for
a few days and now just barely has positive pressure on the airlock. 
I've read in the archives about people leaving their b-wines in
secondaries for months.  What's the benefit of this?  I was planning on
leaving it in for about 2 weeks total and then bottling for extended
aging (as I don't want to tie up one of my new kegs for over a year). 
Is there some significant advantage of leaving a beer such as this in
secondary even after the target gravity is reached?  I bottled a batch
of OG 1.085 FG 1.030 imperial stout two months ago after only a couple
weeks in the secondary.  Was that too early?  All scientific,
psuedo-scientific, or anecdotal help would be appreciated.

Subject: Aeration with a "Y"


Top of the afternoon to ye all,


This is not part of the bit on how much is enough.  It just another way of
aerating your wort.


I took a piece of 3/16" brass tubing and soldered it into a piece of 3/8"
tubing,  I did make a hole, connected an aquarium pump to the 3/16" tubing
and the 3/8" was connected to the racking cane.  


As the wort was being racked out of the kettle I had the pump running which
then aerated the stream of wort going into the carboy.  Seemed to work quite
well.


Bill
