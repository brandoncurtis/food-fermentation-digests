Subject: Temp. Control


I want to go all grain, and have read just enough to pose a basic question 
on the type of equipment best suited  for what I have in mind.  Has anyone 
used the Bruheat(r) system to do a step infusion mash?  Does this pulsed 
heat element raise temperatures rapidly enough without scorching?  Or, 
would using a SS kettle/false bottom on an electric stove or over a propane 
burner be a better approach?  Right now, I boil with a propane cooker, but 
am concerned about temperature control for mashing.  Also, I am skeptical 
about adding X gals. of boiling water to achieve Y temp.  I want to keep 
things as simple and non-labor intensive as possible.  Not interested in 
insulated coolers or RIMS gadgetry either.  Any thoughts from those who 
have "been there - done that" would be greatly appreciated. Private e-mail 
is fine.  Thanks!

Subject: Skunkiness


        Dave Burley indicates he is "Mystified" how skunkiness can develop
in beer.  I'm no chemist, and certainly not a photochemist, but you just
have to walk around the garden on a sunny summer afternoon with your
favourite homebrewed pilsner or pale ale in your favourite (clear) glass and
within minutes you'll think you're drinking Heineken.  This just doesn't
happen on a heavily overcast day.


        As for the controversy over the additive contribution of Magnesium 
Sulphate to bitterness of a beer, it would seem to me to be a relatively simple
experiment to add small small concentrations of the stuff to a beer, preferably
a bitter at traditional carbonation, to see how the flavour changes, relative
to the initial bitterness profile of the beer.  This should be done blind,
with tasters unaware of the working hypothesis of the experiment.

Paul,
This answer will confirm what Eric Fouch said about Wyeast 1084 Irish ale.
It is really a strong and fast fermenter. The average time to complete the
primary fermentation ( from S.G. 1050 to S.G. 1012 ) using a 1 quart yeast
starter is 4 to 5 days at 15 degrees C ( 60 F ). I ferment in a 7 gallons
carboy  for a 5 gallons batch and use a blow-off tube only with the 1084
strain.
It is a good strain for stout and can be used for brewing a neutral Pale
Ale too.
Welcome to the " Elite Club " ( I say that wearing my asbestos suit ) of
the liquid yeast users.

Eric, I thought Guiness uses exclusively roasted barley because it was less
taxed than dark malts ( black patent and chocolate ). Could you please tell
me where you saw the Guiness recipe that uses black patent malt?

Excuse me, but my point was (if you hadn't noticed) that the HBD should
NOT be split.  Also, if you search the archives, you will find that I
have probably posted more answers to beginners' questions than all other
subscribers combined.  I am not stingy with what I've learned.  In addition
to the questions I've answered in HBD, I also answer a lot of beginner
questions via direct email (usually when something has been covered in
HBD recently or when I have already posted a lot that day).

I'll pay Scott $10 for every post of mine that he can find in which I put
down a beginner.  I only put down the self-proclaimed experts who think
*they* know everything.  Oh... there was that one series of posts in which
I put down a beginner named Leigh P. Beadle (around HBD #1170-1180), but
he has written two books on homebrewing ;^).  I guess the only beginners
I bash are the ones who have written books...

Been there, done that, worked for the AHA as a Technical Editor for Zymurgy.

Those of you who seem to think that I'm some "hater of beginners" should

Sounds like a bacterial infection cutting up proteins (which give head
retention) and dextrins (into fermentable sugars for the yeast to
eat and overcarbonate the beer).  Review your sanitation techniques
and consider if perhaps your yeast culture could even be the source of
the infection.

I presume you mean that it was bitter at bottling time?  If so, it
will mellow somewhat, with time.  If you really mean that the *unfermented*
wort was unpleasantly bitter, then I think you may be in trouble.  When
the sugars ferment away, it will only taste even more bitter.  Don't
give up on the batch till you have given it a few years (yes, YEARS) to
mature (note, this works better for strong beers).  Many a batch that
was presumed a failure was just hiding a wonderful beer underneath.

It may help to switch to bottled water if your new water is high in
carbonates/bicarbonates or if it is very acidic.  What you are describing
is "chill haze" and is caused by a reaction between proteins and polyphenols
(a.k.a. tannins).  The way to reduce chill haze is to either reduce the
protein or the polyphenols or both.  Too high a pH (above 5.8 or so) will
extract polyphenols from your grain husks as will boiling the grain (unless
the pH is in the low 5's).  If you have high-carbonate/bicarbonate water,
you are prone to high-pHs.  You can reduce the bicarbonate by boiling the
water and then decanting off the sediment before you use the water.  You
can reduce protein in your wort by boiling well and at least 1 hour.  The
Irish Moss helps, but too much is as bad as not enough -- I've found that
1/4 teaspoon per 5 gallons of extract wort is just about right.  Too
acidic a water (very rare) can result in too low a boil pH (below 4.6,
I believe) and can result in poor break formation, which will allow excess
protein into the finished beer.  You can reduce polyphenols in the finished
beer by using Polyclar (PVPP) as well as some other finings.  Most finings
will help chill haze by reducing either protein or polyphenols, even though
many (like isinglass and gelatin) are primarily for settling yeast.

Subject: Large Volume Bottling


        Hello all, I have a question for the HB collective.  I'm going to
have a homebrew wedding and have a big problem with bottling.  I'll be
brewing up 4-5 5 gal. batches.  I'm a poor college brewer so I can't afford
to buy the kegging system to keg all that beer.  The closest thing to a
keg I have is my 2.5 gal party pig, and that won't even put a dent in my
total volume.  So what I need is a way to bottle all this beer cheaply.  I
don't want to haul 200 or so bottles to the wedding, let alone collect and
bottle that many.  I have two ideas so far. 
        1)2 liter PET bottles
        2)4 liter glass wine jugs
        The plastic bottles would work but I would prefer something else
because they are ugly and have a short shelf life. The 4 litter wine jugs
I can get from a local restaraunt.  The problem is that they have screw on
tops. The caps that come on them are cheap metal caps with cardboard to
seal them.  Does anyone know where to get beter caps or a way to improve
the existing ones so they would work? 
        Any other ideas would be very appreciated.  TIA and private Email
is fine.

I think that a protein rest would help a lot.  I made an IPA with
43% rye (sorry I've already trademarked the name RyePA(tm) ) and had
a very slow sparge.  I missed my protein rest temp so I forged ahead
and it took me 3 hours to collect 6.5 gallons of runnings!  The flavour
was, ahem... a little "extreme" but I definitely know that rye malt
tastes like!  25% sounds like a good amount.  One additional word of
warning: absorption.  Rye malt absorbs an incredible amount of water!
Have a gallon or two more sparge water than you think you need.

I don't think you did.  If you had, you would have noted that the bitterness
of MgSO4 in water would be insignificant as compared to 20 or 30 or 40
IBUs.  If adding too much MgSO4 was your concern, then why was your post
a one-line sarchastic remark about the bitterness of MgSO4?  You're like
the proverbial kid with a stick in the hornets' nest, Bill...


>Al be so kind to explain what characteristic that MgSO4 brings to a
>beer.  When is this character appropriate and when is it not?


I could write a book on water with a chapter each on magnesium and sulphate.
Here's the short version:  The important ion is really sulphate when it
comes to beer flavour.  This is well-documented in every pro brewing and
homebrewing book.  Many books have some of the other ions' contributions
incorrectly described, but sulphate they usually get right: it increases
the *perception* of the hop bitterness and adds a lingering dryness to
the beer.  Some describe its contribution as harshness, and I would
agree that high-sulphate beers (Dorts, Burton-style Bitters) are not as
"delicate" as low- or medium-sulphate beers (Bohemian Pilsner, Munich
Helles, American Pilsners), but I would not call it "harshness."  I
would call it "assertive bitterness."  Magnesium, I believe, should
be "used" in moderation.  If you are making a high-suphate beer, you
are much better off adding suphate via gypsum (calcium suphate) than
via MgSO4.  Besides the fact that the calcium helps lower the mash
pH and is required for proper yeast flocculation, magnesium carbonate
has a much higher solubility than calcium carbonate and therefore
high magnesium levels make it difficult to reduce bicarbonate by simply
boiling and decanting.  All of this is above and beyond its diuretic
and laxative properties.

See my answer to Bill's question, above.  Any homebrewing book will tell
you that it's the sulphate.  If that doesn't convince you, compare MgSO4
(Epsom salts) beer with CaSO4 (gypsum) beer.  If you match the sulphate
levels, the beer ends up with the same *perceived* bitterness (although
the Epsom salt beer will affect your bathroom habits).

Read the article in the second from last Zymurgy... the one with the
*skunk* on the cover.  You can also search the archives for "mercaptan."
The "heat causes skunking" I got from HBD -- someone (sorry) posted 
that they had skunky beer from *cans*.  Search the archives for "cans
AND skunk AND trunk" (the beer had gotten hot in the trunk of a car
(that would be "boot of a car" for our British and Australian readers ;^).


Oh, and contrary to what Bud ads imply, skunkiness has nothing to do
with age and Bud is no less susceptable to it than other brown-bottled

        FWH is when you lauter your first runnings onto aroma hops in the
kettle. Best explanation provided by George Fix in a previous
digest..(search the archives.) He states that this is best employed in
lighter beers, but I use it with good effect in my IPA.

        Enamel much cheaper, but can be used to make great beers. The prob
is with chipping of the enamel surface, leaving a non-stainless surface that
can rust.

        No, it's done all the time. I ferment at 66-68 F, and then go to
secondary at 38 F. I don't have the luxury of months at that temp, (wish I
did) but you should have no probs. The cold helps to floc out remaining
yeasts more rapidly. All ales, FWIW, in secondary for a minimum of 7 days
with gelatine and isinglass, then serving with isinglass, commence force
carb'ing, and 48 hrs later, it's ready. The initial run is cloudy, as
Spencer reports with his corny's, but soon clears as the sediment closest to
the 'beer path out' (scientific term!) is removed. The final product is
'brilliant.'

        Al is correct, to my knowledge. 'Skunky' beer is beer that has been
'light struck,' a photo-chemical reaction between isomerized hop components
in the beer and certain wavelengths of light, (blue-green?) Clear bottles
are the worst, green bottles are better than clear, but not much, brown
bottles are better and opaque bottles the best.   OTOH, sunlight is the
worst, fluoro's better (but not much...ever notice the blue-green tones on
photographs taken under fluoroscent lights?....Yes, you can use a filter on
your lens to correct this....wouldn't it be nice to have optically correct
light filtering bottles?), and incandescents better still. No light at all best.
        On a related subject, it just drives me "Nutsboy' to hear the AB ads
with the 'skunky beer guy, impyling that skunky beer is the result of age.
Education is good, if accurate. But now I overhear people explaining to
their friends that my highly hopped beers are 'skunked', cos their 'too old!'

        Here's a psuedo-scintific and anecdotal response...I recommend long
secondaries for B-wines and any other high gravity brews. I wish I had the
space to keep mine in secondary for a minimum of 6 months. It is my P-S
opinion that high grav brews produce more of the higher alcohols, (fusels?),
but that these can be reduced by long storage...I don't put any pressure on
my secondaries, just rely on a foil sheet on top of the tank to keep the
critters, both micro and macro, out. These higher grav brews also have a
high percentage of residual proteins that take a long time to drop and
clear. (Hell, they have more of everything.)
        My Barleywine was fermented for about 10 days in primary, and then
had a dose of gelatine/isinglass in secondary, where it sat for 4 months
prior to being force carbonated and served. The beer was 'rough' during
sampling taken in primary, secondary, yet was smoother in serving...and it
continued to mellow out over time and at judging time was 10 months old. 
        Pseudo-scientifically, I don't know if this 'roughness' would
diminish in a sealed vessel to a greater or lesser degree, than in an 'open'
one...this would depend on whether or not the higher alcohols were
absorbed/adsorbed or merely vented off, being volatile.
Pseudo-Scientifically, I also think that such beers benfit from longer times
'on the yeast,' in secondary. I don't think that they would benefit from
early filtering. (Micah?) I just know what worked for me.


        I also know what doesn't work for me....Just tried another approach
to my B-wines....won't do this again! Original B-W fermented with 'dry' ale
yeast till all activity ceased, then hit with 'dry' Champagne yeast, and a
wee bit of O2 as a propellant. OG 23.9 P (1.095). Paper calcs showed roughly
10.25% ABV with ale yeast, rising to 10.5% ABV, following champagne yeast. 
        I had discussed this with my yeast specialist, and decided this
would be the way to go, and it did produce a nice product. 
        Although I do believe that "perfect is the enemy of good enough," I
tried it with champagne yeast only...bad decision...gravity fell to 14
Plato, (1.056) and stopped....I hit it with another ale yeast, and a wee bit
of O2, and got renewed activity, but very slow activity....some days later,
tried it with a double dose of ale yeast, reconstituted and added to 5
gallons of fresh wort, allowed to work for 6 hours before pitching.....now
am getting decent activity, but it seems that the relatively high level of
ETOH, and low pH are preventing reproduction, but are allowing the 3 doses
of ale yeast to eat those sugars that are left after the 'bayanus' ate it's
fill.
        I will return to the ale/champagne plan, next time around. At this
rate, currently 12 P, it looks like another 2-3 weeks in primary. Might be
good drain cleaner, though!

Cute, but if you use a pump for your wort, here's another really cool way:


Once the boil is over, the wort is pumped from the kettle, through a CF
chiller, passed a "T" fitting, into a magnetic impeller pump (March, Little
Giant, etc), and into waiting fermenting vessels.


The trick is that "T" fitting, which has a 1/4" OD plastic ball-valve to
let in just a *tiny* amount of air (using .2 micron filter) -- about 1
bubble per second. The air is sucked in by the pump and the momentum of the
beer (although impeller pumps don't pull too much). When the cooled wort
and air bubble hit that impeller running at almost 4,000 rpms, it turns
into Guinness!!! The foam is so thick, it take HOURS before I can take a
hydrometer reading! This is probably caused by the Nitrogen content of air,
which gives you a good indication of the oxygen content. It's a good idea
to put your yeast in the carboys first! :-)


After two batches using this technique, I re-tooled the valve assembly and
upgraded to a 3/8" SS ball valve. This turned out NOT to be a good idea
since you need to a very fine control on the valve. I couldn't get the 1
bubble/min I wanted and the pump kept un-priming itself. I'll be installing
a 1/4" brass needle valve next.


I'm also thinking of just injecting pure Oxygen which should elliminate
that Guinness effect. The down side to this is you run the risk of OVER
oxygenating your wort!


I use a CF chiller, but this would probably work better with an immersion
chiller since impeller pumps should be as close as possible to the source
- -- sucking liquid through 25' of 3/8" copper probably isn't a good idea. Of
course, restraining the output to 3/8" sorta balances things.

At least you didn't shake it to suspend the yeast. I had un-capped the

Subject: SF beer/O2->dead yeast/Maris Otter sparge/immersion chilling


Greetings brewers. I'm back from San Francisco and playing catch-up with
the HBD. First off, I must say I was disappointed with what I saw of the
SF beer scene, though maybe I just wasn't clued in. Also, being used to
NYC can make San Francisco seem like a frontier town, much as I like it. 


There isn't a fine English ale to be had in all of SF, far as I could
tell. There was one small corner bar with over 60 taps crammed into it,
which was kind of impressive, but the selection still wasn't great and the
beer was served poorly. 


Stopped into the SF Brewing Company (brewpub) and enjoyed the experience. 
However, their ales were peculiarly murky. The Anniversary Ale was very
tasty and seemed to incorporate some chocolate malt and a lot of late hops
for a rich flavor. The porter was tasty but a little sweet, and had a
spicy/clovey flavor in the finish that had me puzzled. Wondered if it was
a phenolic from the yeast, or a sign of infection.

A lot of people were curious about my experience with the dead starter. 
The yeast was Wyeast London Ale from a fully-puffed pack. 1650 ml of 1.040
malt extract solution was boiled and chilled in a 2000 ml flask, and the
yeast was added. I oxygenated for the better part of 10 seconds using pure
O2 with a Liquid Bread diffusion stone. The flask was then stoppered and
shaken for the better part of 10 seconds. The head space probably had a
high concentration of O2 so I presume the starter wort became temporarily
super-duper-saturated with oxygen, with the yeast already in it. 24 hours
later there was no positive pressure in the flask, no gas release upon
swirling, and nothing at the bottom of the flask except a little trub.
This was my first lifeless starter, and I'm pretty confident that the
yeast died at the oxygenating step. 


Al K. regarding utilization formulas:
>Right you are... I disagree.  For my old system (pretty standard 10 gallon

My main purpose was to summarize the popular methods in response to a
novice question, but it's understood that we all get good results with
different systems so there's no point in debating it. You are clearly
getting hop utilization on a par with commercial breweries, but some
people aren't. I don't know what accounts for the difference since your
old system was a big pot on a stovetop (presumably not an optimal
situation). For whatever reason the Tinseth formulas seem to be the most
accurate for me. I sometimes wonder if elevation above sea level isn't a
bigger factor than we think. I suspect the violence of the boil is more
important than temperature, hence people at higher elevations might get
better utilization on the average (Papazian hop additions seem skimpy to
me, for instance).

There's admittedly no theoretical basis to my comments -- in fact, the 40
C rest should theoretically be helping rather than hurting. On the other
hand, rather than analyzing the theoretical factors, I think another
empirical experiment might be more helpful, using the simplest and most
proven methods for this type of mashing setup and type of malt. If you are
game for this, I'd suggest one of two procedures to see if you get the
same strange results: 


1) The basic guidelines for kettle mashing from Jack Schmidling seem to be
pretty well founded. Using his approach, you would mash in with warm water
at 1.5 qts/lb to make the mash stirrable, and slowly add heat to bring it
up to saccharification temps. The slow heating through all the temp ranges
obviates the need for any low temp rests, so this method accommodates just
about any type of malt. 


2) With UK pale ale malts, the low temp rests are really quite
unneccesary. I get 85% efficiency and clear beer just by running hot water
slowly and evenly over the grain (to avoid balling) and stabilizing at 15X
F for saccharification. This would simplify the procedure down to its
time-tested basics. If the grain behaved strangely when treated this way,
then it would all but prove something's wrong with the grain, don't you
think? 


Apologies again if the the language of my original reply was objectionable
or unclear.

I never considered this as I like to pitch on the cool side anyway, and
don't mind living with the slightly longer lag time. In any case, it might
be best to chill to the max (say about 1 hour with the immersion chiller
suspended at the top) to get the best cold break. It'll warm up to a
noticeable extent as it's transferred to the fermenter, and you can always
let it sit at room temperature a while longer if you like. One of those
stick-on thermometers would be useful in this situation.

This technique doesn't filter out much if any of the cold break, as it
gets broken up with all the pouring and goes right through. A slow siphon
or drain through through the hops, however, works well. Obviously you need
to screen back the hops somehow, and they should remain as undisturbed as
possible while chilling and draining the wort.

About the proposed "Freshman Digest"- IMO, Scott Abene and George
De Piro nailed it. This should be an *all welcome* learning tool.
Like Scott, I've been brewing awhile,started 25 years-gave up after
a few batches cause my beer was *bad*. Restarted about 10 years ago and 
with a lot of help,advice and brutal criticism from a great group of
brew club friends (Bock'n'Aleians),learned to brew good to occasion-
ally great beer. I learn something new all the time from the Digest
and hope that I occasionally add something. Give it a chance, newbie
brewers, ignore the high tech, over esoteric and "Big Head Ego brewer
shit"(thanks Scott, great words) and follow what is on your level and 
soon you will see your brewing abilities increase and drag your under-
standing with it.


About recipes: Shane Saylor thinks more should be posted. Why not? Mine
are no secret and I *will* post one soon. A lot of the recipes I use 
have originated somewhere other than my great mind-got a Red Ale recipe
off Dion Hollenbecks web page today. I probably wont follow it exactly
but, its a starting point. Good recipes will also help the newbie brewer
to make better beer, keep brewing and in turn, help us old coots keep
our enthusiasm.


For my question of the day-I always purge my 5 gallon carboy with CO2
when I rack to secondary. I've always used 15 PSI for about a minute.
Is that enough?? Am I wasting my time and CO2? All input will be taken
with appreciation and maybe other "inquiring minds want to know"!!

Subject: Melanoidin Formation,AcCoA, MgSO4


Steve Garrett wonders whether his altitude will effect mealanoidin
formation in the boil. Doubtless it will slow it down but probably not stop
it. Processes like this one seldom are turned on or off by 10-15 degree
temperature changes though they may be slowed substantially. Note that
turning up the heat in the oven will only increase the rate at which water
is boiled off, not the temperature of the boil. To do this you will have to
raise the pressure: a bit beyond the average homw brewer!


On Steve Alexanders question of question about M&BS remarks concerning
acetyl-CoA availablility when growth is restricted: I have always taken
this at face value i.e. during growth a larger proportion of the total
available AcCoA is being taken for mevalonic acid and lipid synthesis and
so less is available for ester formation. My simple model is  that, for
example, AcCoA + B <--> MA + D where MA is mevalonic acid and B and D are
other stuff (water, NADPH, NADP, hydrogen ions) goes faster towards the
right than AcCoA + ROH <--> RAc + G does because MA (mevalonic acid) is
removed (converted to squalene) wheras the ester (RAc) sticks around. At
the end of growth MA is not consumed, its concentration rises and the first
reaction no longer procedes so rapidly to the right allowing AcCoA to
accumulate pushing the second reaction to the right. If my little
hypothesis is correct, a dearth of anything needed in the squalene or lipid
pathways would work to make the esterification reaction procede with more
vigor. I'm sure it actually much more complicated than this when the
enzymes, the kinematics, the redox potentials, the pH...are all considered.


Nathan L. Kanous posted that 40 mEq of magnesium is enough to send you
