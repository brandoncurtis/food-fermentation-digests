Esters are the reaction products of alcohols and carboxylic acids.  They are
apparently not formed this way primarily in a fermentation, but are the result
of a metabolic pathway in yeast.  They are the primary odorants in many fruits
and in low concentrations in beer may make you think "fruity" without being able
to identify the fruit.  At higher concentrations you may smell ethyl acetate (
reaction product of ethanol and acetic acid)  and think "nail polish remover" or
"solvent".  You may smell amyl acetate (amyl alcohol and acetic acid)  and think
"bananas".  If you smell "cloves" or "spices" it is not an ester, but rather
eugenol which is phenol substituted with an ether and an unsaturated side chain.
Fusel ( higher molecular weight)  alcohols are reputed to provide an oily,
solventy smell sometimes.

Rye malt is gummy and will give you a slow lauter, as you know.  Do a beta
glucanase rest at around 122F  as  95 -131 F is the active region for glucanase
at mash pH, assuming the enzymes in rye are the same as barley .  Although I
didn't, you may want to do this rest at this temperature with just the rye malt
( a split mash) to prevent depleting your beer of head forming properties which
come from the barley proteins. I recommend a thick mash to maximize these gum
destroting enzymes' activity  Even with this low temperaure rest for the entire
grain bill, my rye beer had a big thick head, but I used a German Pils malt to
simulate a Roggen. A split mash at the start of the mash is a good idea with
fully converted malts like you would use in an IPA. 


My observation is that the wort viscosity in this mash is very noticeably
temperature dependent, so run the lauter at a higher temperature than you
normally do to reduce the viscosity.  I have even drained the grain bed (gasp!)
at maximum speed to prevent cooling, rinsed the bed with hot water and heated
the wort up and then recirculated it to clarity,  followed by a final hot water
sparge.  It worked great.  This was more than 30% rye malt as I recall and was
marginally slower than my normal sparge which I control to 45 minutes to an hour
with largely barley malts.
 .---------------------------------------------
 Tom Williams asked is it necessary (or advised) to flame the mouth of
> the secondary prior to transferring yeast to storage? 


Personally, I think flaming of the surface has little to offer in way of
sterilizing or even sanitizing the neck the of the carboy unless you get the
surface temperature up there.  It is possibly dangerous depending on how you do
it. Above all don't put alcohol into the carboy or on the surface and light it.
It will not heat the glass and you may get an explosion.


I do it this way:


Dampen a cloth or paper towel with *acidic* metabisulfite solution.  The
metabisulfite should be about 500 ppm.  pH should be below 3.5, 3.0 is better,
but it is not critical how far below.  Use a food acid, say, citric or tartaric
acid.  Wipe the neck of the carboy with this cloth, removing any crud that may
have somehow gotten there, but don't let the solution drip into the yeast.
Since yeast can stand 100 ppm of metabisulfite, pouring the yeast out over this
neck now will not affect them as the amount of metabisulfite is small and
bacteria are killed above about 30 ppm with acidic metabisulfite.  I cap it in a
12 oz beer bottle and put it in the refrigerator


If this worries you, stop worrying. I occasionally wash my yeast in 50 ppm
metabisulfite which is acidic, followed by cool boiled water twice and pitch
into a starter.  I've never done it, but I suppose the yeast will be stable in
the water if placed in a refrigerator without pitching. Others have written here
about using distilled water to store their yeast, minimizing the potential for
bacterial contamination. Although some commercial brewers pitch  washed yeast
directly, apparently there is evidence  that acid-washed yeast can sometimes not
behave "normally" for the first fermentation (maybe because its
uncontaminated??). Since I pitch the yeast into a starter before it goes into a
batch, I have never seen this problem.

What is the feeling you get from drinking beer or any other alcoholic
beverage.  I'm serious.  I would like to read some different people's
description of the "feel-good" feeling they get from alcohol; not the
drop-down-drunk feeling but the level at which the effect is pleasant.


Can you describe this feeling?  What kind of thoughts occur to you that would
not happen without the drink.  Does the drink make any unpleasant thoughts or
feelings go away, become less important or become solved?  Does the drink
have any effect on physical pain.


If you can put together a description of a beer drinkers "feel-good" I would
appreciate an e-mail copy.

Subject: Malting amaranth


Hi,
I had a dream of making a high-percentage amaranth beer which would 
require home-malting 5 pounds or so. I've just tried test malting a 
pound and all I succeeded in creating was an incredibly foul stench.


I failed miserably and I think I know why: amaranth is small. After
soaking, the grains are 1 mm of so in diameter. Unless laid out rather 
thinly, there will be no air flow between grains and they will 
rot/mold. And if they are spread thinly, they will dry out quickly
(because they're small), necessitating frequent soaking or spraying to 
keep them wet.


Needless to say, I used a tall container- soaked them for about 24 
hours, changing the water every 8. Then I drained the water, and let 
it sit for a few days, soaking and draining every 8 hours or so to 
keep the grain wet. The smell just got worse and worse until I gave up 
and tossed the mess.


Has anyone tried this? If someone has used it as an adjunct, how did 
you use it? Milled or flour? boiled for how long before adding to the
mash? Does anyone know the gelatinization temp? I tried using 10 oz of 
flour, but I got no noticable flavor contribution and I'm afraid I 
didn't gelatinize it first. Amaranth has a unique kinda nutty flavor
that I think would be a great addition to some types of beer.


Thanks in advance for any help,


Andy Milder

There was obviously a little residual activity continuing and the
yeast flocs with their attached CO2 bubbles were not bouyant at
pressure.  When you opened the bottle and released the pressure the
CO2 bubbles expand and the yeast flocs rise.


You may not need to acid wash your yeast for reuse, but washing the
'sludge' with sanity water to remove the wort/beer will prevent this
problem and then storing the yeast under pure water should improve the
survival of the yeast (see HBD article last 1996).  See 'the brewery'
website for washing details.

Subject: Aeration (are we still having fun? ;-)


Hello HBD,


While I personally haven't adopted an aggressive aerating
regime (yet), I thought the following might be pertinent to
the current thread:


I know from my aquarium days that aeration is best accomplished
with the largest air to water surface area and a mechanical
means of moving water in the tank so that it flows past this
surface.  The air stones you see in an aquarium contribute
relatively little to directly aerating the water since the
bubbles have a small surface area compared to the top of the
tank.  It is the motion of water created by these air stones
that keeps the water moving past the air/water interface (basicly
the top of the tank) where the water can pick up oxygen.


With that in mind, perhaps it isn't necessary to have the air
stone going full blast, but instead, set at just the right speed
to get the wort in motion.  There would be the benefit of
less foam (who needs it ;-) and for those using oxygen, less
oxygen bottles to buy.


So... with that all said, a crazy thought pops into my head.


Picture this:


A small impellor on a long shaft is driven at moderate speed
by a small DC motor (kinda like those things they make
milk shakes with but not spinning so fast).  This gets the
wort in motion but doesn't generate (much) foam.  After
an initial blast of oxygen to purge the head space with the
pure gas, set the oxygen on trickle. Less foam, less oxygen
to buy (and hopefully happy yeasties).


This really is a great hobby...  ;-)

i think you might be able to make a grant out of it, if you can drill a hole
in the side near the bottom and affix a valved outlet.  this piece of 
equipment is used at the outlet of the lauter tun during recirculation.  
basically it allows you to keep the output of the lauter tun running at a
constant flow rate while you recirculate.  depending on the quantity of liquid
and grain in your mash, it allows you to maintain the level of the liquid in the
lauter tun at whatever distance above or below the grain surface you desire 
while vorlaufing.   judging from the dimensions you gave, it would probably 
hold nearly five gallons.  this is plenty of capacity for a typical five 
gallon batch, and would be enough for even a 10 gallon batch.  
if you wanted to get fancy, you could even heat it *gently* from the bottom 
to keep the mash liquor warm as you recirculate.  if you do use it as a grant,
run a hose from your lauter output to the bottom of the pail to avoid 
splashing during recirculation.


additionally, you could use it as a small open fermenter for 3 gallon batches.


you might be able to make a flotation tank out of it.  you could
do all three, actually.  for a flotation tank, you may want two valved outlets.


since stainless is a relatively poor heat conductor, it wouldn't be an ideal
"turn on the heat and let it go"  decoction vessel, but you could use it if 
you kept an eye on it and stirred often.  i have a very thin bottomed stainless
pot for decoctions and it's not a huge hassle.  if it has handles, that's even
better.


sparge water reservoir?  put a valved tap on that sucker and you could do 
nearly anything with it.

Subject: Wheat malting and wheat and extract recipe




Dear Friends:


I am planning to prepare a new batch of homebrew using my malt extract 
and wheat malt. I have prepare a couple of batches and did it good 
(the second one is better than the first). Anyhow, my beer did not have 
nice head retention. It presents good carbonation and head, but 
retention is poor. At least, this is my opinion. Taste, flavor and aroma
are good, though I do not have any other homebrew to compare with.
I believe I will improve head retention in my beer if I use wheat malt . 
However, there is no chance to obtain wheat malt
here, so I need to malt it myself. I will have no problem to obtain raw 
wheat and will malt it if I can get the correct procedure to do it.


I wonder if you can send me some information on malting procedures, in 
particular on wheat malting.


As you know, my malt extract composition is: maltose 45-55%, dextrins 20%,
proteins 5-6% and xBrix 80-83 (1.47 specific gravity). I have used a recipe 
with 5kg of extract (OG 1.055), ale yeast and got a FG of 1.010 and a alcohol 
content approximately 6% in volume. IBU is approx. 25, using Northern 
Brewers for bitterness and Cascade hops for aroma. I had some problems with
temperature during the second batch. Temperature was around 25 to 30C 
during fermentation and I wonder whether I will obtain better brews when
temperature decreases.


I would appreciate if any of you suggests me a recipe using wheat or wheat
malt and this extract. I will use the recipe you suggest for my next batch. 
Thanks.

Would there be any advantage to layering your grains for the mash?


There have been several posts about having a sticky mash, due to grains 
like rye.  If you were to put several pounds of barley malt than add 
corn, wheat, or rye, than on top of that add the rest of the barley malt, 
would it help or make it worse?

Ray,


I just got a similar freezer, and am in the process of doing the same.
The best way of doing this is to drill into the lid, where there are no
coils. You have two options. 


        1)Drill on the front face of the lid (usually about 2 inches high)
          doing this puts the tap at a reasonable height, and still allows
          you to fit the kegs in, without having the taps in the way.        
        -or-
        2)Buy chrome columns and top mount them.


I just ordered 2 columns, with faucets, for $165 each. Each one has
2 faucets, allowing 4 beers on tap. If you do top mount, realize that
the freezer is constructed with thin sheet metal, and support, plywood
works well, should be used inside the lid. Also, don't buy a cheap
thermostat, if it stops working, how can you pour frozen beer?


Best of luck with the modification.

If a lower temp ferment 'overlooks' any sugars (what else would account
for a significant difference in gravity) sugar test strips will indicate
the same unfermented sugars.  So whether using test strips or a fast
fermented-sample you have the same result; you know you have some
unfermented sugars.


In practice I find very good agreement between predicted and actual FG's
**to the resolution of a hydrometer reading** (emphasis mine).  A hot
ferment might be a little more complete than my batch ferment mainly
because I don't always need/want to wait for the batch to ferment the
last little bit, but I know pretty well what fraction of potential
gravity I'm trading off.

Do it quickly, you shouldn't be holding a flame there long enough to really
heat up the glass.  Simple measures to keep your yeast clean are good
things.


On a yeasty note-does anyone know what strain of yeast used in Mad River
Brewing's "Jamaica Brand Red Ale"? I made a starter form the dregs of one
bottle, more out of curiosity as to their viabililty than intention to use

delicate fruity aroma), I decided to use it in a batch of an all-Columbus

dryhopping now in the cellar.

I haven't made it in a few years, but I have a recipe for a honey-basil ale
which is a nice beer, if a bit unusual.  I had a basic american wheat beer
recipe, lightly hopped, to which I threw in about 2 oz. (or so) of fresh
basil.  The result was subtle but noticible on the herb.  A refreshing summer
beer, and good to cook with!

Subject: Inverted fermentation


In my quest to eliminate the secondary fermentation and cut down on
washing up and other labor I am going to try inverted fermentation. 
Rather than the available commercial set ups for this (Brewcap and
Fermitap), I am going to make my own stand for an inverted 6.7 gal carboy.
The stopper will be clamped on and a long tube will go to the bottom (top
when inverted) to allow CO2 to escape and a short tube at the top (bottom
when inverted) will allow me to pull off the yeast when the fermentation
is completed, preventing autolysis and overexposure to residual cold break
trub.  I'm going to add another intermediate length tube to permit me to
sample during the fermentation.  


Can anyone offer some advice?  Pros and cons?

I'm turning to the collective wisdom of the digest for some guidance on
why we may be getting low original gravities.  Our last 3 batches have
had less than expected starting gravities.  For all 3 we used "bulk"
pale malt as the base.  A porter with 6 pounds, a spice ale with 6
pounds, and an Octoberfest with 8 pounds.  The original gravities were
1.033, 1.030, and 1.020!!! respectively.  The first two tasted just
fine, if a little thin.  The fest is still fermenting.


What gives?  Our hydrometer reads 1.000 in plain water.  Is anyone else
getting these low results with bulk syrup?

I've always used "Mason" jars for canning wort for subsequent use as
starters.  Recently, lacking sufficient jars, I tried ordinary 12 oz. beer
bottles with good results.  I'd worried a bit about the seals on the bottle
caps withstanding boiling temps. but, after one month at room temp., there's
no problem with the worts.   Method was the typical canning method- boil
bottles, drain breifly and fill while hot with boiling wort, cap (I didn't
preheat the caps) and process for 30 mins. in a boiling water bath.  A
caveat:  be careful around hot fluids- particuliarly when capping the
bottles of hot wort since the bottles you use probably weren't designed for
this service.  The only disadvantage I've noted is that I miss the lid of a
jar being sucked down as an indicator of a good seal.

Subject: Rye for beginners and Old Peculiar recipe request


After reading everyone's comments on using Rye malt, I was wondering if
anyone has experience just using malted Rye as a specialty grain? My plan
was to put it a pot of cold water and over 45mins-1 hour bring it up to
~170degF, treating it like Crystal or chocolate malt. I have heard two
descriptions of the flavor that Rye imparts; some have described it as dry,
others as sweet. I am sure this is due to different ways of treating the
rye. Does anyone have experience which one you'll get by just steeping as a
specialty grain and what quantity of Rye would a good upper limit to use
this way?


Also, could someone reproduce (even off-line) the recipe for Old Peculiar
from the latest edition of Zymurgy (Old Ales are the cover story)? Extract
and all-grain if possible.

Subject:  intensity of boil


collective homebrew conscience:


i noticed a mention of boil intensity as it relates to hop utilization.  i, 
unlike al k, cannot get sufficient bitterness using the rager formulas.  my
beers are a lot better balanced when using the hoptech utilization scheme, but
i think the reason i don't get utilization as high as some others might is
because the intensity of my boil isn't tremendous.  i achieve a rolling boil
in an enamel kettle over two burners on an electric stove. most of the intense
rolling action is over the two burners.  


i've taken the anheuser busch tour a few times, and one thing that struck me
about their brewhouse was the intensity of the boils they were conducting at
the time.  it appeared to be a much more intense boiling than what i can 
achieve with my equipment. 


if it's the motion of the wort that helps the isomerization, i wonder if a 
longer hop boil (90 min. or more) would increase my utilization. i've read that 
overboiling hops can lead to decreased bitterness, but is this because of too
much motion, or too much long time exposure to temperature?  if it's too much
motion, i suspect i would not see decreased utilization.


regardless, until i have an equipment change, i will probably just use a 
little more hops to get the balance i desire.


just out of curiosity, have any of you brewers who moved from stovetop to
propane/natural gas burner setups seen an increase in utilization due to 
increased boil intensity?


also, i've read that some brewers advocate boiling past a positive hot break
before adding hops.  do first-wort-hopped beers have decreased break potential?
i've used first-wort-hopping, but didn't really notice a decrease in break
material.  of course, i've been using 1/2 tablespoon of irish moss per 5
gallon batch.  al k's recent post suggests maybe i should back off on this a
tad.

I have been fortunate enough to inherit a home made SS pot.  
It is just over 8 gal. It has been welded along the bottom 360 
deg., as well as, vertically where the top section was welded 
together to make a cylinder.  This pot was used many times to 
steam C.B. Blue Crabs.  It has sat for at least two years. When 
I found it, there was some slight surface rust around the welds. 
I cleaned them with a small stainless brush, all the rust was 
removed with little effort.  I am concerned that this may be a 
"bad" pot to use as a brew kettle...  Is this the case?  Can I 
just clean and dry it thoroughly after I brew to prevent the rust 
forming?  Any assistance with this matter would be greatly apprec

extracts, and a full 5 gallon boil...

I used my newly built "planispiral" wort chiller yesterday on a batch of
special bitter. (For anyone who hasn't been following the planispiral
chiller thread, it is basically an immersion chiller made of copper that is
wound into a tight spiral - think of a heating element on an electric
stove.)


I admit to being somewhat skeptical of the claims that this design would
eliminate the need to agitate.  But, it works!  My chiller is configured so
that about 1/2" of wort covers the coils - in other words the chiller is
suspended at the TOP of the wort.  My wort chilled from post-boiling temps
to 65F in 25 minutes (no stirring!).  In another 15 minutes it came down to
a pitching temp. of 55F. I cool my tap water before it enters the chiller
with an ice bath - I'd guess the water enters the chiller at 45F. During
the chilling process I could feel the temperature differential on the side
of the pot.  The bottom of the wort coiled first, gradually moving toward
the top.  I now have an extra half hour in my brewing process that I can
devote to something other than hovering over the coiling wort.  Very cool!

I recently re-subscribed to this list and only caught the tail end of the "no
fizz in my bottles" thread, so if this has already been covered, let me know
and I'll go back to the "shup-up, listen and learn mode."  In Dec I brewed a
couple of California Common style batches--my first ever use of lager yeast.
 I used one and a half quart starter of 1.040 (probably over kill, but it
kicked off like a son-of-a-gun).  Primary fermentation was 5 days at 65-70 F,
secondary was three weeks in basement at 45-50 F.  I primed using 4 oz of
corn sugar, bottled and put the bottles back in basement.  Three weeks later,
I tested one--FLAT!  A week later--still flat.  A couple of days ago I moved
the bottles back to warmer temps in hopes of someday having carbonated beer.
 Now for the neophyte question--I thought lager yeast liked it cold?  The
yeast-faq says #2112 ferments well to 62 F.  Is that up to 62 or down to 62?
 Was I just being impatient?  
   
I will now humbly bow before the monitor and await enlightenment from the

Hello out there!


I have what may be a stupid question, but here  goes anyway.  I have

gas and bloating until my last two batches.  It's really bad!  I have 
tried the gas-x, etc., but find no relief.  I have read that the 
yeast ferments substances in your bowels, thus causing the extra 
wind.  Would filtering the beer help in this situation?  If so, what 
size (microns) would be the best?  Has anyone out there fooled around 
with Diatomacious Earth filtration?  I was wondering how D.E. would 
work.  I have a DE filter on my pool, and have a endless supply of 
DE (and it's cheap).  I can't bear the thought of having to give up

Subject: CO2 purge


Brewsters:


Val Lipscomb asks a question I asked myself many times, especially when purging
cornies:


> For my question of the day-I always purge my 5 gallon carboy with CO2
> when I rack to secondary. I've always used 15 PSI for about a minute.
> Is that enough?? Am I wasting my time and CO2?


Here's how I answered it for my needs:


Psi is unimportant.  Volume of CO2 per unit time X time is what is important.
The real question is, "How many volumes of CO2 do I need for a given container
volume?"  You can determine your volume for your equipment by taking a 3 or 4
liter botte full of water. Invert it in a sink or large bowl of water. Put your
gas tube in the neck and turn on your CO2 and measure how long it takes to empty
the bottle of the water.  This will give you the gas flow rate.


Assume that your gas flows at the rate of 1 liter per second on your particular
settings.  A five gallon carboy is 20 liters.  Assume that at any instance the
gases are perfectly mixed, the CO2 is going in the bottom and pushing out the
current mixture ( not quite true, but 5 gallons is a small volume and the gases
are turbulent) If the carboy or cornie is open to the atmosphere, at the end of
1 second the mixture of gases will be 19 liters of air and 1 liter of CO2, At
the end of 2 seconds it will be 19 X (19/20) air and 19 X (1/20) + 1 liter of
CO2, etc. Air is 20% oxygen as you know. 


If you do this calculation as a method of approximation you find that once you
have pumped in 100 liters (5 carboy volumes)  of CO2, the oxygen content in the
gas is about 1000 ppm.  This is about a minute and a half of purging at 1 liter
of CO2 per second. If you rack the beer into the bottom of the carboy without
splashing and let it push the gas out you will have very little oxygen in your
beer.


To give you an idea of the curve shape:


CO2 - liters       Oxygen - 1000 ppms     Container Volumes
0                               200                                  0
10                             120                                  0.5
20                               68                                  1
40                               24                                  2


60                                 8.8                               3 
80                                 3.6                               4
100                               1.1                               5


Using the right hand column makes this a useful table for all size containers if
the above assumptions are applicable.


This is important when racking to cornies if you are going to force carbonate
cleared beer or when moving beer into a cornie after filtration, since the  beer
is at its most sensitive to oxygen with no yeast around to protect it.


However,when I rack into my secondary, my beer is still fermenting and I do not
bother to purge at this point, since the combination of dissolved CO2 being
released and an actively fermenting yeast population will prevent the oxygen
from doing damage. In this case, I don't think you need to bother purging your
carboy.  I do, however, minimize splashing by racking into the bottom of the
carboy.


Keep on brewin'
