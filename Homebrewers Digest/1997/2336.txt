My homebrew shop has small vials of "amylase enzyme" distributed by Crosby

marginal enzymatic power?  Any idea what the mix of alpha/beta is?  How much
do people use.


I figured that this stuff might be useful to have on the shelf for a

Subject: London Ale III


A while back, someone asked about experiences with Wyeast London Ale III. I
brewed a pale ale (0G 1050) and then pitched the yeast cake into a 1075
Scotch ale.


It took two days for the pale to take off using a 500 cc starter and
aeration at 68F. If the temperature got to 62, activity would slow
drastically. It took 14 days until I was able to keg. The flavor is very
clean. Very low esters. No diacetyl.


The Scotch ale was 99% pale ale, 1% black, 35 IBU E.K. Goldings at 45 min. I
used Dr. Fix' partial reducton method of removing 3 qt of wort and reducing
it to 1 qt on high heat. I aerated on pitching and fermentation started
within hours. After 14 days at 68F, it was kegged. The flavor is again, very
clean. Very low esters. No diacetly. No smoke phenols.


The beer is still very cloudy. I used gelatin to clear it, but without any
noticeable effect. 


The only problem is that the hops are not as high as I had anticipated. I
used the EK Goldings pellets (powder) from Sam Adams. They must be pretty
old. If you use these, increase the amount by at least 25%. Better yet,
don't use them.

Subject: Recipes


Good morning all,


Recipe formulation requires that you know what the underlying malt
taste like.  One way of finding out what these flavors are is to brew a
"single malt" beer.  Try brewing a beer with only pale ale malt, pilsner
malt, Vienna malt or Munich malt to an OG of 1.050 hop it at about 35
ibu's and you will wind up having a much better idea of what the
contribution of the base malt is to the beer.  Might even have a great
beer.


If you want to brew an English style beer use English ingredients, or
German ingredients for a German style beer and so on.   This is
important if you want to brew a particular style.


Use the KISS system in brewing.  Most styles of beer can be brewed
with only two malts at most three.  Don't follow the recipes in Zymurgy
as most of the recipes presented there were designed for only one
purpose and that was to stand out against all the rest and win.  Most of 
recipes in  Zymurgy  are to large for the style they were entered in and
most were over hopped (they probably were good beer just not to
style).


Keeping good records of what you have done can be helpful to
improving you recipes.  If you use a method to calculate bitterness
don't bother changing it just because its results didn't provide the
bittering you thought it should just note if the beer need more or less
bittering and adjust the next batch.  The last batch is done, either you
drink it, dump it or give it to unsuspecting friends,  but you can't easily
change that batch.

Subject: Thin mash temp variablilty / stone's in my beer!


Greetings,


Just mashed a porter yesterday and somehow managed to dilute the mash 
more than usual.  I ended up with a water:grain of 1.5 qt:1 lb.  I 
usually use 1.25 qts of water per pound.  I was unable to get an 
accurate temp on this mash.  I used three different thermometers and got 
all sorts of strange readings.  One step had readings from 136 degF to 
174 degF.  Can the "thinness" of the mash contribute to strange thermal 
currents in my mash?  Anybody else had this problem?  Yeah, it was 
groundhog's day.


Also, I bought one of those lovely wort oxygenating systems.  I boiled 
it in water for 15 minutes as per the directions.  I got ready to 
oxygenate my wort and turned on the O2 for what seemed like an eternity 
(probably closer to about 45 secs).  The directions say start low and go 
slow, so I thought I did.  The first sign of any oxygen moving through
the system was when the stone blew off the end into the wort.  The 
package recommends to avoid handling the stone with your hands because 
oils in the skin can actually clog the stone.  How about 
lipids/break/yeast/etc. in my wort?  Will this clog my stone forever
once I retrieve it?  Anybody else managed to do this?


TIA.  Private e-mail is fine.

Subject: wyeast 1028






I recently made a brown ale using Wyeast 1028.  At bottling time, the
beer was still fairly cloudy.  I bottled anyway because 1) I figured it
would clarify in the bottle and 2) I needed the yeast cake for my next
batch.


The next batch is done, and it too remained cloudy.   I tried geletin,
and this helped a little, but it's still quite cloudy.


Is this natural for 1028?  Could I have introduced some contaminates
that might cause this?


The beer tastes good, but I've gotten a headache when I tried either
batch.  (I plan to do a more scientific study of this as other
environmental stimuli [aka kids] might have been the cause of the
headaches)


TIA for any info

Subject: Canning in beer bottles/Bittered wort/Small boiler volumes 


     Hi all,
     
     CD Pritchard writes about canning wort in beer bottles.  He was 
     wondering about the integrity of the cap liners after boiling.  As 
     some of you have read in the past, I sterilize my chiller and save 
     sterile wort in beer bottles by running hot wort through my 
     counterflow chiller (with no water running through it!) at the end of 
     the boil.  I then seal the bottles and lay them on their side, so as 
     to ensure that the entire interior is in contact with the 200+F wort.
     
     I have recently experienced problems with the seals on some bottles 
     melting and failing.  It is quite easy to spot these bottles because 
     they get moldy after a week or two.
     
     I now only leave the bottles on their sides for 30-60 seconds to avoid 
     overheating the caps.  I am now also more careful about boiling caps 
     when bottling beer.
     ------------------------
     Al K. writes that if wort tastes too bitter prior to fermentation, 
     then the beer will be too bitter because there will be less sugar 
     balancing that bitterness.
     
     This is contrary to my experience.  I find that freshly bittered wort 
     is deeply and harshly bitter, and that the bitterness is reduced and 
     smoother after fermentation.  This makes no sense if only considering 
     the balancing sweetness of the wort sugars, but does make sense when 
     factoring in the fact that yeast activity reduces hop bitterness (by 
     what mechanism, though?).
     ------------------------
     Tim Watkins describes his lack of ability to do full volume boils 
     because of his small pot.  He wants to try mashing, and outlines a 
     rather labor intensive scheme involving the brewing of small batches 
     over a 2 or 3 day period, and then combining them in the fermenter.
     
     Tim, please do yourself and the people around you a favor.  Go to the 
     nearest department store and drop the $30-$40 on a 7 gallon 
     enamel-covered canning pot.  You will be done brewing a 5 gallon batch 
     in one day.  That's one day of brewing, cleaning, cursing, drinking, 
     ignoring the loved ones, etc., as opposed to 2 or 3.
     
     You will not regret the purchase!
     
     Have fun!

Stuart writes in HBD #2334
<
In my quest to eliminate the secondary fermentation and cut down on
washing up and other labor I am going to try inverted fermentation. 
Rather than the available commercial set ups for this (Brewcap and
Fermitap), I am going to make my own stand for an inverted 6.7 gal carboy.
The stopper will be clamped on and a long tube will go to the bottom (top
when inverted) to allow CO2 to escape and a short tube at the top (bottom
when inverted) will allow me to pull off the yeast when the fermentation
is completed, preventing autolysis and overexposure to residual cold break
trub.  I'm going to add another intermediate length tube to permit me to
sample during the fermentation.  
Can anyone offer some advice?  Pros and cons? >


Save your time and money Stuart.  A neat idea, especially for lagers but
the slope of the carboy shoulders is not great enough to purge off the
yeast.  The whole setup is more trouble than it is worth.  I know because I
tried it with limited success.  The best thing that came out of my
investment is a spare racking tube and a nifty stand to dry my carboys.

From:  C. Erik Larson
To:  EX.MAIL."homebrew`at`brew.oeonline.com"
Subject:  Flaked Barley in Partial Mash / Wyeast California Lager / 
          Foam Control (TM)


A couple of days ago, I brewed a stout employing  the following recipe
(for 5.5 gallons), about which I now have some questions.
 - -RECIPE - - - - - - - - - - - -
Partial Mash:
2 lbs Crisp Pale Ale Malt
1 lb Flaked Barley
1 lb Roasted Barley, and
1/2 lb Chocolate Malt.


Addidtional Sugars:
4 lbs Alexander's Pale Liquid Malt Extract
8 oz. Malto-Dextrine Powder
8 oz. Dark Unsulphured Molasses


90 minute boil with 2 oz of 4.7% AA Wilammette bittering hops.
Force cooled, force oxygenated, and pitched 1/2 cup of Wyeast
California Lager slurry.  Also added 1 1/2 tsp of Foam Contro (from
Hoptech)..
It's happily fermenting at 57.8 degrees.
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Now for the questions:
I usually do my partial mashes in a 2-gallon round Igloo water cooler, to
which I fitted a home-made  "easy-masher".  For the above brew, I
may have had my first stuck sparge.  I say "may have" because things
were going so slow, that I took a long fork and gently broke up the grain
bed a couple of times to get things running.  Nevertheless, it  took nearly
1 1/2 hoiurs to recirculate the first runnings and sparge with 2
additional gallons of 170-drgree water.


Could this slow pace of the sparge  have been caused by the relatively
high percentage of flaked (and I assume unmalted) barkey in the mash?


What are the collective's thoughts or experience using Wyeast
California Lager yeast in beers other than those of the California
Common style?


I have only seen Hoptech's  Foam Control mentioned once in this forum; I
believe in one of Mr. Moline's J. Gump reports.  I've used it  in three
batches so far, and have been relatively happy with it -- the exception
being that it failed (at the recemmended dosing rate) to restrain the
blowoff in a Tripel I brewed a month ago.  When I added a total of 4 tsp,
the blowoff subsided.  When it works, the product lets me relax and not
worry that my wife will call me at work to report that my fermenting beer
is gushing all over the home office or worse..  Does anybody else on
the HBD use this stuff?  How has it affected your beers?  None of the
batches where I used foam control have made it to bottle yet.

Subject: Re: Sterilizing carboy neck


There has been some discussion lately about flaming the neck of glass 
carboys.  I my bacteriologist days, I was taught that flaming the top 
of tubes, etc, prior to sterile transfers was not done to sterilize 
the tube, but rather to heat the tube a little to induce upward 
convection currents in the air contacting it.  This was to keep 
airborne spores, etc. from settling into the neck of the open vessel.  
This was before the widespread use of HEPA filtered air hoods.  I am 
willing to bet that not many modern bacteriologists working in hoods 
bother with it.




When I feel the need to sanitize the neck of a vessel, I use 70% 
ethanol.  Either denatured ethanol rubbing alcohol if I expect to 
remove it all from the surface, or (better) undenatured Everclear 
diluted about 75 parts to 25 parts water to make about 70%.  Then if a 
little gets into the wort/beer/yeast, it won't matter.

A. J. deLange kindly writes re my question on AcetylCoA ...


Just to recap the motivation here.  Alcohols with AcetylCoA in yeast can
produce esters.  The desireability of esters in beer is highly dependent
on the beer style and the type and amount of the particular ester.  To
understand *when* esters are produced it would be useful to understand
when yeast have pools of AcetylCoA available for this reaction.

Yeast, like the rest of us, produce various isoprenoid compounds as well
as squalene from mevalonate. The relative amount of mevalonic acid used
for each during yeast growth isn't clear.  Squalene can't be used to
form steroid rings without free O2, so once the fermentation goes
anaerobic there must/should be some mechanism inhibiting squalene
production.  In eukaroyte cells at least the formation of mevalonate by
3-hydroxy3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase enzymes is the rate limiting
step.  The activity of this enzyme and so the first reaction above is
modulated by phosphorylation of the enzyme - the phosphates are
presumably thrown off during the conversion of mevalonate to
pre-squalene compounds.  This rather than the mevalonate build-up may be
the controlling factor in yeast too.


This all matches quite nicely with various references to the use of
ergosterol added as a growth factor for anaerobic fermentations - this
bypasses the need for O2 in sterol formation, but won't necessarily
inhibit AcCoA pooling or ester formation.  Do we know if it does ?


The case for the pooling AcylCoA in lipid synthesis is much less clear
to me.  Apparently the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in yeast
requires O2, (like squalene usage above) and this use for O2 can be
bypassed by adding oleic acid to an anaerobic fermentation.  Some
unsaturated lipid syntheses don't require the free O2 - yeast appear to
tho'.  The first step in synthesis is conversion of AcetylCoA into
Malonyl-CoA which requires an enzyme, biotin and several co-factors and
is irreversible.  How this step is regulated isn't clear.  Andy Walsh in
his 'Esters paper' refers to a trub study that indicated that the
presence of linoleic acids in wort prevents formation of some esters.
This implies that the unsaturated lipid product prevents the AcCoA
pooling. More study needed here.


Anyway, I guess my original question was how would NON-oxygen related
growth restriction (like lack of FAN) relate to ester formation.  I
suspect an extensive understanding of the regulation of various
processes in yeast might be necessary to answer in detail.

It sounds like a process that might work. But if you can do 3 gallon boils, 
why not do 2 batches of 2.5 gallons instead of 3. If you have a 6 gallon 
secondary it would probably be ok, but 6 gallons in a 6.5 gallon fermenter 
will most likely blow out the airlock. Not enough headspace.


The only other thing I would question (someone else should comment on this) 
is when you add the 2nd and 3rd batches to an existing fermenting wort/beer, 
is there a need for futher aeration or would it be best to NOT aerate, 
depending on what the additional air (or oxygen, depends on how you aerate) 
would do the the yeast.


More a question than an answer.

Hello -


Several months back there was a thread in r.c.b. on bulk malt extract. 
Here's a bit of potentially helpful info:


Malt Products Corp. of Saddle Brook, NJ advertises themselves as an
extract supplier to the brewing industry and has an ad in the Winter
"Zymurgy" promoting Brew On Premises.  I've also seen them listed in the
Thomas Food Industry Register.


They'll also sell malt directly to home brewers; smallest container is a
5 gallon pail.  That should be about 60 lbs of extract.


Cost is $1.09 / lb FOB Garfield, NJ for light extract.  Pail included.


Contact info:


Joe Hickenbottom, VP Sales & Marketing (hard to get a hold of; he said
"Debbie" would be able to provide info).


Phone:  1-800-526-0180; Fax 201-845-0028.


I asked about local pickup - since I drive between MD and CT regularly;
this would be OK; warehouse is in Garfield, NJ; its hours are 830a -
400p.


The message thread back in November mentioned there were no issues
regarding storage; some suggested spraying vodka on the surface of the
extract as a precaution.  General opinion was that concentrated extract
was inhospitable to bacteria.


Sure beats $8.95 for a 3.3 lb can, or even $1.80/lb for a 12 lb pail.

two cases:  


in the first case, you aerate by shaking a closed carboy.  there
is one gallon of headspace.  there is one gallon of air's worth of bacteria 
exposed to your wort.


in the second case, you pump unfiltered air through your wort.  for how long?
dennis davison reported in a recent zymurgy article that it can take several
hours of pumping to achieve optimal dissolved oxygen levels using air.  so
assume the pump runs for 3 hours.  now, how many gallons of air have you 
pumped through your wort?  probably a lot more than one.  all the bacteria in
the air you're pushing through the pump is being filtered out, not by a filter,
but by your wort.  how much does it take to infect the batch noticeably?


i don't know.  but why risk it?

Many thanks to all who replied.  The reponses were unanimous.  In
short, a full 5 gallon cylinder has lots of pressure (around 800
pounds).  The danger is if the valve stem where the regulator
joins the cylinder is damaged.  IF it were damaged/broken, the
effect would be like when you blow up a balloon, don't tie the
end, and let go ... only instead of a balloon you have an
aluminum or stainless steel object being propelled (probably
through the walls of the car) by lots o' pressure.  General
precautions include removing the regulator and firmly securing
the CO2 cannister and/or wrapping the valve stem area in an old
blanket, putting the cylinder in a protective cage for
transporting etc...

over used.  I wouldn't go over 10% of the grist, certainly.  It is similar,

any commercial beer, just a very quaffable ale with a bit of complexity
(maybe a touch of Biscuit, Victory, or Special Roast?).  


The following are "givens:"


  Mash:
 
0.5 lb. Torrified Wheat  
1.5 lbs. Maris Otter   


  Extract: 


3.3 lbs. Munton and Fison Extra-Light Extract
1.0 lb. Munton and Fison Amber DME


  Hops (not sure of how I'll use them; but here they are):


1 oz. Chinook (12.4%)
1 oz. Styrian Goldings (5.4%)


  Yeast 


Wyeast Ale Blend (#1087)


OG (est.) = 1.040-1.042


I'm hoping to get good head retention via the torrified wheat;

Subject: sparge/HSA questions


The results I've gotten from the last couple of competitions 
I've entered included comments on astringency and oxidation. As 
a result, I'm looking for suggestions on how to improve my 
process.


I assume that the astringency comes from oversparging my mash 
and letting pH get too high. Generally, I don't monitor pH of 
runoff b/c my pH meter isn't temperature corrected. And I don't 
measure SG because 1) it's a pain and 2) I worry about pouring 
the measured wort back into the pot and introducing air. My 
water is soft and I usually just add some lactic acid to the 
sparge water to adjust its pH and then quit worrying about it.  
Are there any simple methods to avoid this problem? Also, is 
there any difference in the runoff between draining the grain 
bed for the last runnings and keeping water level above the top?


As for HSA (and oxidation in general), I may have eliminated my 
problem by replacing the plastic valve on the outlet to my tun 
with a copper one which doesn't suck in outside air. But I still 
am interested in hearing what folks think is the right level of 
caution, including 1) below what temp is HSA no longer a problem 
and 2) whether people CO2 purge bottling buckets too (like you 
would a corny)

I've been doing mashes in a BruHeat since I began all-grain brewing
 - about 6 batches. I tried a step infusion once - and wish I never
had.  I figured that, by stirring constantly during the boosts, I
would avoid scorching and make sure the heat distributed quickly.  
My stirring achieved my stated goals, but ignored a more serious 
problem...carmelization on the element: I ended up with a black,
hard as steel coating on my heating element. I have tried everything
to remove this, and nothing has worked. Fortunately, it doesn't seem
to have affected the element's performance.  Someday, I'll order a
replacement element.


I plan on changing my brewing setup soon.  I will keep the BruHeat
for heating strike and sparge water, and for wort boiling. For my 
situation, the BruHeat is an ideal boiling vessel. I will use a Gott
cooler for mashing and lautering, and stick to single infusion mashes 
for a while.  Eventually, I hope to convert to a RIMS style setup
with the same components, and the addition of a pump and a few odds 
and ends.


Bottom Line: 
If you're a fan of step mashing, don't plan on mashing in a BruHeat.

So I picked up some lactic to keep my sparge water at a reasonable pH.
The thing is, i don't know how much to use per x-amount of water. During
my brew session yesterday, I added 1/4 tsp to 2 gal of water. Before the
addition, my yellow pH test strip would turn purple (I forget the
approx. pH), but after the addition the yellow strips didn't change
color at all. At the time I thought this was great. But in 2332  Al K.
states:
"Too acidic a water (very rare) can result in too low a boil pH (below
4.6, I believe) and can result in poor break formation, which will allow
excess protein into the finished beer."
Yes, my break was not very good. 
So, the big question is, what is the proper way to utilize lactic acid?

Right -- they make all of all alcohols, *including* higher (a.k.a. fusel)
alcohols.  Also, all that OG tends to increase the temperature of the
fermenting wort itself which *further* increases higher alcohol production.

The yeast play an *important* role in reducing (oops, another chemistry
word)... er...  decreasing the levels of the higher alcohols.  Dosing with
gelatine or isinglass or filtering will actually SLOW the process of
esterification (yeast turning alcohols and acids into esters) and will
make the beer take LONGER to lose that "rough" character.

Yes, but they can also mellow (lose that roughness) in the bottle if the
beer is unfiltered.  Consider how Sierra Nevada Bigfoot mellows.  In my
opinion, a GOOD vintage of Bigfoot is one that burns the throat after one
month in the bottle.  I've got sealed cases of Bigfoot and Thomas Hardy's
dating back to 1989 sitting in my cellar.  Don't filter!  Open or sealed
is not really a big factor although you want to make sure you don't
oxidize all those higher alcohols.

Have you tried using the whole yeast cake from a 1.050 beer for the BW?
I did this with several Barleywines (homebrewed) and it takes the 1.100+
wort down to 73 to 77% apparent attenuation without any other yeast
addition.  I dare not try to ask this yeast to carbonate the beer,
however (chicken, I guess) so I DON'T FILTER, force-carbonate, and counter-
pressure fill the beer bottles.  Yeast settles out in the bottles eventually

If you can afford to tie up kegs and space, how about just letting it
condition in kegs for a year or two?  You probably want to keep them
airlocked as opposed to sealed for the first year.  Based upon the first
corollary Murphy's Law, it will be your best beer ever and impossible to
duplicate!  ;^)

Regarding the recent barleywine thread...


Based on a couple recipes in Charlie Papazian's second book (the 
Homebrewers Companion), I have used Wyeast #1056 - American Ale
(also reputed to be Sierra Nevada's yeast) for the two barelywines 
that I have made with excellent results.  1056 is a hard fermenter, 
has a fairly neutral taste & can take high alcohol levels without 
(appearent) damage.  In both cases the beer carbonated well in the 
bottle without repitching (one had a S.G. of 1.080; the other 1.096; 
both ended in the teens).
I've never used champagne yeast with beer (only twice with mead), but 
I am concerned that it would make the finished product too dry.  A 
good barleywine strikes a fine balance between lots of alcohol, 
plently of hops and a solid maltiness to back it all up.  I would 
think that barleywines made with champagne yeast might be awfully 
heavy on the alcohol and hops and a little thin on the malt side.
Anyway, for you barleywine makers, try Wyeast #1056, and be sure to 
make a VERY BIG starter (mine was twice what I usually make for a 
1.040-1.060 beer; a 1.5 liter wine bottle almost full of slurry!)  
It has worked well for me.

Because my alcoholic drink of choice is beer, I find it hard to get the
nice numb like feeling I used to get with wine and hard liquor due to I get
sick first because of the volume of beer I would have to consume.
