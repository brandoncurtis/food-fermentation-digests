Subject: Wyeast 1056 and High O.G.


Yesterday I pitched a large quantity of healthy Wyeast 1056 into a wort 
of much higher gravity than I was expecting--1.073.  I'm aiming for an 
old ale, so the gravity itself is fine with me, but I'm a little 
concerned that 1056 might not be able to handle it.  I'd have diluted the 
wort a bit, but at the time of pitching the wort in my hydrometer was 
still rather foamy, so I couldn't read the gravity.


Anybody have any experience with 1056 and a gravity this high?  If the 
yeast peters out, would pitching some fresh 1056 (I have a culture in my 
fridge available) help?  Or should I go with a high-alcohol-tolerant 
yeast if this yeast can't make it?


Thanks.  (By the way, this is my first partial mash--staggeringly more 
work than extract, but deeply satisfying.)

Subject:  Dead Yeast ???


Hello all Homebrewers


Here's my situation;  The last batch of beer I brewed got off to a  
bad start.  I mistakenly pitched a yeast slurry that was almost 6  
weeks old instead of the 2 or 3 weeks old like I thoght.  I  
realized it after I smelt the jar.  The risdule yeast had a very  
sour off smell.  It was late that day so it was too late to go get  
fresh yeast from the home brew store.  First thing the next morning  
I went out to check and there was only a slight sign of  
fermentation starting, and as I had hoped, a good layer of yeast  
that had setteled out in the bottom of the carboy.  I went down to  
the shop and bought some fresh yeast, came home and racked the beer  
and pitched the new yeast(I figured I needed to use the dry stuff,  
I couldn't wait to make a starter.)
With the fresh yeast things got foaming in about 4 hours.  The gas  
coming out of the airlock had the rubbery smell that I was affraid  
of.  The rest of the primary went well. After racking to the  
secondary and dry hopping with whole leaf hops, things got cold in  
southern California and it took almost three weeks for the yeast to  
drop out and the beer to clear.
At bottling time there was still a faint aroma of burnt rubber  
(what is that "auto- something word?)  Last night I tried a bottle  
after two weeks of conditioning, and was plesently surprised.  It  
had a little off taste in the first sip, but no where near as bad  
as I thought it might.  My wife tried it and liked it.  After I  
explained the burnt rubber taste she tried it again, and said it  
was there but not very strong.


Finally my question, will the situation improve, will the off taste  
(not very noticable now) get stronger or mellow with more time in  
the bottle?


Thanks for your help

miniscule....as another co-respondent said in private

Subject: Hops


G'day y'all,


Something I've been wondering about lately is how different are different 
varieties of hops.  So far, I've tried some New Zealand grown Hallertau, 
Stiklebracht (which I have never seen reference to in books, but is described 
as a relative of Northern Brewer), and some Saaz I got from Australia.


My impression is that the two strands of New Zealand hops are very much the 
same, while the Saaz hops are less bitter.  Is there any consensus on whether 
hops are wildly different (like bell peppers and habaneros) or quite similar 
(like Burpee Big Boy and Beefsteak tomatoes).


Cheers,
Bruce

Subject: spigot for Aluminum brewpot


Another homebrew lurker comes out of the closet: I've been reading the HBD
for about a year now and have learned many things. As a novice I greatly
appreciate the experienced brewers sharing their knowledge/experiences.
Hopefully I will be able to learn to be a better brewer.
Now for my question: I have a large aluminum brewpot for my boils (I don't
really want to open the Aluminum vs SS debate again) and I'm thing of adding
a spigot to it to save wear and tear on my back. I would like to use a
bulkhead-type fitting instead of having someone try to weld a fitting into
place. However, I also know that there is such a process called electrolytic
corrossion caused by joining two different metals. Would this be a problem
in my case and if so how can it be solved (other than buying a SS pot -
having a teacher's salary and a frugal wife prevents this).

I've done some home malting of corn, and you have to turn the "piece"
often.  Just get in there and gently stir it up at least twice a day.
Rinsing is important too, but you must turn it as well so that you
discourage the growth of mold and allow the grain to get some air.
This also seems to make the rate of sprouting more even.


> I used a tall container-


Use something shallower, like a plastic tub with holes drilled in the
bottom.  I'd *guess* that for a small grain like amaranth you'd want
about 1 to 2 inches deep.  You can cover the tub with a damp towel to
keep the grain from drying out.


The rest of your procedure sounds fine.


Why not try it without malting it first?  Be a lot simpler and the
worst thing that could happen would be that the finished beer is cloudy.
Not much of a tragedy IMO.

A more important caveat is that YOU CANNOT SAFELY CAN WORT IN A BOILING
WATER BATH.  Sorry about the shouting, but it is not good procedure to can
anything  with a pH higher than 4.2 in a boiling water bath.  Everything
else, like wort, needs a pressure canner.  If you don't believe me, look in
the Ball Blue Book, the Kerr Canning Guide, _Putting Foods By_ or any other
modern canning cookbook.  I agree that canning wort is a timesaver, but it
is stupid to put your health at risk to save a few minutes.  While botulism
is quite rare, it is most often caused by home-canned food, and its effects
are irreversable.

Subject: Predicting FG, Predicting OG


Brewsters,


Charles Rich says about his method of fermenting a small batch at high
temperature to predict the FG before the main batch finishes.:
 
> In practice I find very good agreement between predicted and actual FG's
> **to the resolution of a hydrometer reading** (emphasis mine). 


That "accuracy and repeatability" rather than the resolution of the hydrometer
is strongly affected by the CO2 bubbles in the still fermenting beer, I'm sure.
It is possible to do it the way you suggest and likely get decent results most
of the time,  just not very practical IMHO when Clinitest is so easy to use.
- ------------------------------------------
Ray Love is having OG problems with pale malt syrup:


I assume the bulk syrup is of constant consistency and not obviously picking up
moisture from the air, fermenting or any other weird thing.  What is the% water?


I assume the wort is well stirred and has the same gravity on top as on bottom.
Often that last gallon or so of water added to bring the wort up to 5+ gallons
doesn't get stirred in very well.  How well do you stir it?  If you have this
problem rack it into another carboy with the wort swirling in the bottom of the
second carboy, move the hose up and down in the first carboy.  Testing  the SG
several times a few hours apart will show you if you have this problem.  If the
SG goes up over time, improper stirring is your problem.


Although I favor a poor job of stirring as the culprit to explain these large
discrepancies, I have to ask this also. Are you correcting your OG readings to
60F? and measuring it at a standard volume of wort? ( say all at 5.5 gallons or
whatever)   Try a test, take a known amount of extract, dilute it to a known
volume with water, Stir very well,  measure the temperarture and the SG.  Go to
Charlie Papazians book and check what you should get.  If you don't have his
book e-mail me your results and I will tell you if the extract is on target or
not.

Subject: The Decoction From Hell - What Did I Create?


Comments from the collective and especially the experienced decoction  masher
are requested.


Tried my first decoction Sunday, which became the decoction from hell.  Grain
bill was 7.25# Belgian Munich, 1.5# Belgian CaraMunich, 2# Crystal 60L, 2.50
Belgian pilsner malt.  The planned mash schedule was to mash in with .9
qts/pound to reach a 131F rest, hold for 15 minutes.  Pull 40-50% of the
thickest part, heat to 158F, hold for 10 minutes, heat slowly though to
boiling, boil for 5 minutes.  Return this first decotion to the main mash to
reach 158F rest.  After conversion, pull the thinnest 50% of the mash, heat
to boiling for 5 minutes, return to main mash to reach 170F mash out
temperature.


Ok lets mash!


Mashed in as above (12 qts total H2O at 147F) and actually got 131F (At this
point I was overwhelmed with joy! :)).  Rested for 15 minutes (the mash, not
me) and pulled the first decoction.  Decoction was thick, not runny, and
didn't scorch.  Did the decoction thing per schedule above (confidence is
building in my abilities) and returned to main mash which had only dropped to
128F (from 131F)  Added the decoction back to the main mash hoping (expecting
actually, high confidence level now) to get 158F.  What!  Temperature
stabilized at about 145F!!!!  All confidence is now gone :(  Threw the whole
mash kettle on the cooker and heated entire mash up to 158F.  Waited for
conversion (60minutes or so)  Not wanting to tempt fate again pulling another
decoction I just heated the whole #$%^& mash up to 168F for mash out.
 Transfered to lauter tun and sparged as usual.


Was expecting an OG of around 1.072, got only about 1.062.  OK not bad, this
was a learning experience.


I know it's not ruined.  It was wort, it's fermenting, it will be beer and
I'll drink it.   So what did I actually produce with this kind of mash

I am fairly new to brewing, but sure liked my initial results. I have found
bottled beers which I like, but do not know what to use in an attempt to get
similar results. I think I lean toward the malty, sweeter, medium hopped
types. Any (partial mash) recipe suggestions, that are similar to these
beers?


Brews I found to be excellent: 
                                       Brasal Bock (Canadian Dark Lager)
                                       McRogue Scotch Ale (Oregon)
                                       Flag Porter (Britain)
                                       Devil Mountain Black Honey Ale
(California)
I was at the Chicago Beer extravaganza on 2-2-97. Out of 35 beers I could not
find one like the ones above. I asked my local brewing supplier, and he had
not tasted the beers I am refering to - HELP!
               Thanks much!! - Help a guy get started! - Thanks again

HBDers -


I will be going to London in a few weeks on business, and am hoping to pick up 
a beer engine or two while I am there.  My understanding is that the pubs were 
recently required to change out their beer engines (some had brass parts), and 
that many are simply lying around in cellars waiting to be bought by American 
homebrewers longing to infect their brains with lead. :-)  


Does anyone out there know of someone I can contact in the London area that 
might have a few of these "banned" engines?


TIA,

HBDers -


Alex Santic recently wrote lamenting the poor selection of beers in SF.  I was 
recently in the Bay area, and had no problem finding some great beers.  Of 
course I was in the San Jose area, and had a car, so if you're willing to ride 
the highway a bit you can find some truly great brewpubs in the Bay area.  My 
two favorites are the Front Street brewpub (for ales) in Santa Cruz -- they 
had some live music when I was there, and Los Gatos Brewing Company in (where 
else) Los Gatos (IMHO, the best brewpub I've ever been considering atmosphere, 
food, and drink -- they specialize in Lagers).


Granted SF is not Seattle or Portland where you can easily find cask ales and 
the like, but remember you are in wine country!  


The Tied House and Gordon-Biersch (sic) are always good standbys too.


Perhaps this will help other HBDers headed to SF,

Subject: Filtering Beer....


HBDers -


I just wanted to give the filtering thread a kick or two.....


I recently aquired a 0.5 mircon filter (from the Filter Store plus, standard 
disclaimers, etc), and have been very interested in some of the posts 
regarding head formation and the affect of filtration on flavor.


So far I have "packaged" three batches of beer with the filter.  I usually 
make 10 gallons or so -- I've been bottling 5 and kegging 5.  For the first 
two batches, the bottles were entirely unfiltered, and the kegs were filtered 
and forced.  Here are the results so far:


Batch 1 -- a 100# wheat beer:
I found no difference in flavor or head retention between the two batches.  
Also, carbonation bubble size was, if anything, smaller in the kegged batch 
than in the bottled batch.  This may simply be due to different carbonation 
levels (the kegged had less carbonation).  Of course the keg batch was clear 
and the bottled was hazy, as you would expect.  However, the bottled batch is 
clearing somewhat as time goes on.  These results, since this was a wheat beer 
probably loaded with protiens, may be suspect as to the heading and 
carbonation properties.


Batch 2 -- a low gravity mild:
Again, I found no difference in the filtered and unfilted batches, except for 
haze.  This too may reduce with time as the bottles clear.  


Batch 3 -- an IPA:
Here, I filtered 9+ gallons and will force the keg and "spunded" (sic) the 
bottles with the remaining unfilted beer (to make a total of 10 gallons....).  
Results TBD.  To be scientific here, I probably should have reserved a bottle 
or two of totally unfilted beer to compare the keg-filtered bottle-unfiltered 
bottle, but the filtering process takes so long that I didn't want to bother.  
Which leads me too a few questions:


What is the benefit of filtration?  My beers ususally get clear (most times to 
commercial clarity) with Polyclar if I let them sit a month or two.  And since 
I cannot as yet detect a flavor difference in the filtered/unfiltered batches, 
the extra 2 hours filtering adds to my bottling process (not to mention the 
extra expense and mess; oops I just did :-) )  does not seem to be a clear 
"winner" of an investment.  The only advantages I see so far is that I can get 
clear beer FAST, and if my bottle conditioning experiment works out, I may be 
able to reduce the sediment in the bottle or keg, making it easier for 
non-homebrewers to consume my beer (which I guess is a benefit.....).  


Perhaps I should try a larger micron rating (say 1 micron) -- will this speed 
the filtration process?  Intuitively I'd say yes, but others with experience 
may have some real data points here.


Also, I'm not keen on force carbonating.  Just my personal preference, but it 
seems to take for me about as long to force a keg as it does to naturally 
carbonate (yes, I simply refuse to sit and shake a keg for 15 to 30 
minutes...).  Will a 1 micron rating leave enough yeast in the beer to prime 
with sugar as typically done, or do I need to reserve some unfiltered beer as 
a yeast supply?  How about a 5 micron rating?


Just some datapoints from a "newbie" filterer,

Subject: Re: purging with CO2


There have been a couple of posts lately describing different methods 
of purging an empty carboy or keg with CO2 prior to racking into it.  
The methods described so far attempt to describe how to fill the 
container with CO2 so as not to under fill (allowing for some O2 to 
still be in the container) or over fill (wasting precious CO2).


I would like to offer another method.  If the price of CO2 is of no
concern to you and/or you will not be able to sleep well at night
unless you squeeze every last drop of O2 out of your process, then
this may not be the tip for you.  Otherwise read on....


What I do is first rack the beer into the keg or carboy without 
pre-purging.  If you rack it carefully and slowly so that there is no 
splashing, then there will actually be very little oxygen that gets 
into the beer in the short time it takes to rack.  NOW, purge the 
headspace with CO2!  Instead of taking ~5 minutes to waste 5 gallons 
of CO2, you now only need to take ~15 to 30 seconds to purge the much 
smaller headspace.  The headspace in kegs will typically be smaller 
than carboys, so adjust your purge times accordingly.


Even though this method does not allow for accurately knowing when to 
stop purging, if you err on the side of caution, you should be 
covered and you still will have used much less CO2 than if you tried 
to purge the entire container. This process saves time and CO2, while 
only slightly increasing the inevitable introduction of small amounts 
of O2.


PS- I never did get a response regarding whether or not submicron air 
filters are necessary based on my assumption that the little nasties 
floating around are actually not free floating but attached to larger 
dust particles that can be filtered easily with basic cloth, cotton, 
or something similar.  Does anyone have a comment on whether this 
assumption (nasties do not free-float) is correct or not?


Thanks! Oh, and thanks to Pat and Karl (and others) for the 
new?/old? HBD!!  Your efforts are honorable and noted!

Subject: Stout, Siphons, History of HBD


Thanks to everyone who responded either privately or through the
digest to my concerns and questions on my first stout.  I never did
locate either the black patent or the chocolate malt called for in
the recipe, but I have a great color and the hydrometer sample tasted
great, so I have great expectations for the outcome of this one.


What is the suggested priming rate for a bottled stout?  The Guinness
I tried had that nice man-made head (nature had nothing to do with
it).  Is a stout heavily primed to emulate the artificial Guinness
head, or should it carry a more subdued carbonation level like an
English bitter?


I tried the 'Chore Boy' in a hop bag wired to a racking cane idea for
the first (and last) time Sunday.  I was trying to impress my wife
with the low tech solutiion to a niggling problem.  I cooled the
wort, whirlpooled and let it set for about 1/2 hour, then inserted
the cane/chore boy thing, grabbed the turkey baster and started the
siphon - for about 10 seconds.  As the wort crawled back up the
tubing, I watched the break whirl back into suspension from the
backflow.  I could not get the siphon to start again.  I thought this
invention was designed to work with hop pellets, but the hop bag
became so clogged with pellet powder that the wort wouldn't siphon. 
The turkey baster  proved insufficient to pull wort through the now
plugged hop sack.  I tossed the baster and locked my lips around the
tubing.  Even that couldn't pull the wort.  I gave up, pulled the
chore boy et al. from the racking cane, reinstalled it and gave a
real hearty suck on the tubing.  Wort jumped through the tubing, into
my mouth, engaging a gag reflex and impressing my wife as wort
squirted out of my nose and mouth onto her kitchen floor.  You get a
whole new life experience when you have 8.6% AA hop particles drying
in your nose.  You also make odd noises and facial expressions.  My
wife thought it was worth the price of admission.


About 8 months ago I began the task of reading all past issues of the
HBD.  I can only read a couple of past issues a day during lunch, but
I'm all the way up to 1992.  Believe me, there's a lot of reading to
do, and I'm waiting to see how some of the threads turn out, and to
see what became of some of the luminaries of the past who rarely (or
never) post anymore.  One of the great constants, however, is Al K. 
He was answering some of the same questions 6 years ago that he is
answering for a whole new batch of homebrewers today.  He not only
answers through the digest, but also takes the time to send private
email to neophytes who run into problems.  I know because he has done
this for me (as have several of the *VERY* knowledgable members of
this forum).  People who are intimidated by some of the discussions
(and expressed heat of some of those discussions) and feel that this
forum is too advanced should just ignore the heat and grab the
nuggets.  There is knowledge to gain here by everyone.  People who
think the HBD is too vitriolic today should read the past digests,
there was some unabashed bashing going on in the past.  


I wish to thank all contributors to the HBD, past, present and future
for helping me turn that first can of brown gooey sweet stuff into a
drinkable beer, and for all the improvements I've made since then. 
There is no greater jewel than knowledge.  Sometimes you have to wait
for the lotus to open fully, however, to see the jewel within.


Sorry to pontificate, just very appreciative of everyone here.

It was a dark and stormy night... That story is just too long. Fact is, I 
made a practice run of my first Decoction and it went south on me. 
Temperature control is the bane of my existence. The practice run was to be 
my Strawberry Blond, I thought that an extra malty flavor would make the 
beer taste like a Strawberry Milkshake (the old fashioned kind made without 
cornstarch).


Well, after 14 days in the primary the gravity went from 1.057 to 1.006. 
This is just a bit too dry for my taste.


The strawberries go into the secondary after being frozen and then 
pasteurized. Question is, will the sugar in the strawberries be fermentable 
or unfermentable? The beer definitely needs more body and I'm wondering if 
the berries will take care of it.

Subject: Newbie making stout


I've just bottled/kegged my first batch of beer since about 1980. It's a
nice pale American Lager that turned out pretty well, but just a little
on the cloudy side....nevertheless, it tastes great.


I wish to brew a stout now, but, I'm no big fan of the very bitter
aftertaste found in most Irish Stouts that I have sampled (which ain't
many).


If I used a dark DME and instead of using Black Patent Malt I chose
something a bit less bitter (like chocolate malt), would I be able to
still have a nice thick stout, with moderate alcohol content, and a
little lighter on the aftertaste?


Reply to the digest or just email me. (bmurrey`at`bellind.com)


Thanks


Any additional tips are appreciated. I'm using a (God forbid) 10 gallon
plastic pail to do the primary fermentation in, then I rack over to my 6
gallon glass jug with ferm lock. I cover the primary with a sheet of
plastic and a big rubber band.  When the secondary slows way down I
usually rack back to the pail, clean out the jug, and rack back to the
secondary and let it sit for a couple more days. I find this helps to
clear things a bit but I'm curious as to the magic that irish moss
claims in clearing proteins.


I'm putting my brew in the 1.5L kegs for th emost part, and 2L PET
bottles for sharing. I hate getting just one 12 oz beer to try, what if
it's good?  2L is a much better quantity.


All beer is good, it's just that some is better.

Subject: Strange Fermentation


Fellow Brewers,
 I am actually writing this from Holland. I'm here on business.I had an 
excellent white beer last night called Wietske Witte and it was excellent. It's 
actually made in Holland, not Belgium, even though it's very close to Belgium. 
I plan on trying a few Belgian Whites while I'm here also.


 Anyway, this is not why I am writing. My last batch had a rather strange 
occurrence with the fermentation. My typical ferment happens like this. The 
wort churns and churns pretty violently for a day or two, the airlock bubbling 
every second for the first day or 2 and then slows down and bubbles every 10-20 
seconds for another day or 2. This time I had the violent churning for the 
first day or 2 and on the third day the wort was still churning but the airlock 
did not bubble anymore. Even though the beer was still churning fairly 
vigorously there was no bubbling at all. I don't think there was a problem but 
I just thought that this was strange. I did not see any problem with the 
stopper (no slight holes or air breaks) and the airlock itself appeared to be 
fine. 


I am not real concerned about the batch because it smelled heavenly upon 
racking was just wondering why the air bubbles would stop so suddenly? 


Cheers,

Subject: Milk Stout, paddling along


Brewsters:


Tony Owens asks about Milk Stouts and Lactating Mothers and stout rationing to
mothers in WWII.


Michael J. Lewis in "Stout" (Classic Beer Style Series - Brewers Publications)
has a something to say about this and I suggest you take a look.  It appears to
be related to health ( similar to the origin of Milk Chocolate), but Lewis
implies at the beginning of the book that this was just a way for a woman to get
a good drink in Victorian and post-VIctorian times ( especially in Methodist
Wales - boyo)  without embarrassing anyone. Then again it may have helped babies
( or the mother ) sleep better.


I had always thought that Milk Stout was called this because lactose (milk
sugar) was added and didn't have anything to do with nursing mothers, although
it was a favorite among nursing mothers and this extra nutrtional product may
have been targeted at this unfulfilled ( for religious and social reasons)
market niche. Lewis indicates the concept of drinking mothers preceded the
addition of the nutritional enhancers like lactose,whey and concentrated
peptonized milk. ( and the term "milk" stout may not have been used before these
additions either - I'm not sure about the origin of this name). He says on p 26
"Furthermore, for nursing mothers stout or other beer is a tradition of great
antiquity."   British truth in packaging laws now prohibit the use of the term
Milk Stout because it is misleading.


As far as beer restrictions in the Great War (WWII), this was attempted on many
fronts by the then PC anti-drinking establishment. Preserving this tradition for
mothers may have been a way of softening the position.  It was proposed at one
time that beer production be restricted or even stopped and the grain fed to
people and cattle ( sorta like the grain vs beef thread going through the PC
community at present - have you eaten your 5 pounds of grain today?).  Efforts
like this failed because it was pointed out that nutritious beer was made from
this grain AND the cattle were fed the dried remains of the mash tun. This
represented the most efficient use of the grain, notwithstanding the uttter
social upheaval this would have caused if beer production were restricted or
stopped.  Can you imagine it?! no pubs or beer in war-torn Britain!!!  Without
the pubs and beer to foster community and relieve tensions, maybe the Americans
wouldn't have been over-paid, over-sexed and over there!

I built a large paddle many,many ( 10 -15 - 20?) years ago from new oak floor
boards and sealed it with a urethane varnish. Many pounds of malt and gallons of
wort have passed over its surface. It is still doing fine and so am I.  Properly
cured urethane varnish is about the best sealer you can have as it is tough,
chemically stable,  water repellant, able to withstand boiling water
temperatures and a good bonder to wood.
