Subject: Home malting, part 1




My brother-in-law grows barley, and I brew.  I thought perhaps I should brew 
some beer from his barley, appropriately labeled, to help maintain my bird 
hunting rights on his land, and to provide all of us an idea of what is 
involved with malting.  He graciously donated a 5 gallon bucket of barley 
for this task.  It turns out that is about 45 lbs.


The barley he grows generally goes for soup or other uses.  I have no idea 
of initial protein or nitrogen content, figuring that in the old days, they 
didn t worry a lot about that. It is a 2-row barley, with nice plump equally 
sized grains similar in size to what I buy from my homebrew shop.  I also 
have no idea of the initial moisture content, but it was in marketable and 
storable shape, so it must be pretty low.


I weighed out 10 lbs on my bathroom scale.  This I soaked in my old zapap 
lautertun in 65F water for about 38 hours.  At that point, the grain weighed 
14 lbs, for a 40% moisture weight gain. I built a screen frame out of 1 by 
4 s to the interior dimensions of my oven, and covered the bottom with 
aluminum window screen.  I placed the soaked grain in this frame and placed 
it on my floor in my basement (ambient temp 64F).  I covered it with a towel 
so my geriatric cat wouldn t make an unfortunate mistake. Each day I would 
examine the grain, raking it with my hand, and turning it a bit.  I rinsed 
it about every 48 hours or so by placing the frame over my brew sink and 
hosing off the grain with clear water.


By the second day in the frame, little rootlets appeared.  These things tend 
to bind the grains together into mats, easy enough to break up, but somewhat 
unexpected.  The grain has a very distinctive odor, not dissimilar to wet 
grass, but very clean smelling.  I began checking for the acrospire to grow. 




5 days and 16 hours in the frames, I noticed the acrospire was done.  It is 
a very green line on one side of an otherwise white, mealy appearing grain 
interior.  It is thick near the base at the rootlets, but thins toward the 
top.  Most folks say when the acrospire has grown to between 3/4 and the 
total length of the grain, it s ready for kilning.  I tested 5 or 6 kernels, 
cutting the grain in half lenghtwise, and they all seemed about the same.


I took the frame up to my oven.  My wife was out of town, so this part was 
easy.  I placed the frame inside the oven at 125F and left it for 30 hours. 
I would rake it occaisionally with my fingers, noticing how moist it felt. 
 The smell was glorious, sort of like baking bread.


I weighed it at 30 hours, or when it quit smelling really great in my house 
and the grain got dry to the touch,  and the grain weighed 9 lbs. 
 Accounting for loss, I should be dry, or a bit drier perhaps, then the 
original moisture content.  Now, how to get rid of the rootlets....I put the 
new pale malt in my lautertun again, and began milling it between my hands. 
 The little rootlets fall off, and out of the bottom of my lautertun, and 
all over the floor.  Hooray, it s malt....now to grind it.


I don't have a mill, as my homebrew shop grinds grain when I buy it really 
nicely.  I decided a test mash was in order.  I got 1 lb of my home malt, 
worked it over with a rolling pin for a while, and mashed.  The rolling pin 
method didn't yield a really swell crush.


My 1 qt water to 1 lb. mash seemed to use less grain than it does with 
commercial malt.  I stepmashed on my stovetop in the same way as my regular 
beer, and sparged with 1 qt of water through a kitchen strainer for about 
1.75 quarts of wort.  My gravity was 1.010 for this batch.


Anybody want to tell me what went wrong?  Should I go for a kilning step? 
 Is my crush that bad? Or maybe it's the variety?  Will I bird hunt this 
fall?


I appreciate your kind attention to this post.  My plans are to kiln, crush 
better, and try again.  I'll post the results.

Subject: Recipe for Strong Scotch Ale


     Since someone asked that more recipes be posted, I thought I would share
one of mine for a batch I made in December.  Due to lack of equipment, I 
generally make 2 1/2 gallon batches.


     Basenji Strong Scotch Ale


   Category         :  Strong Scotch Ale        
   Method           :  Full Mash
   Starting Gravity :  1.070
   Ending Gravity   :  1.010
   Recipe Makes     :  2.8 gallons
   Total Grain      :  7.10 lbs.
   Color (srm)      : 45.6
   Hop IBUs         : 18.5


Malts/Sugars:
  5.00    lb.  Pale Ale                 
  0.50    lb.  Crystal  20L             
  2.00    oz.  Roast Barley             
  0.50    lb.  Crystal 100L             
  0.55    lb.  Brown Sugar              


Hops:
 0.33     oz.  Kent-Goldings hop pellets   7.0%     70 min


Yeast:  
     Wyeast #1969 in one quart starter which had been stepped up
twice.


Remarks:


     I was trying to clone McEwans Scotch Ale.  All grains (except
roast barley) were mashed for two hours at 154 degrees. I added the
2 oz. of roasted barley at mashout.  After sparge, wound up with
more than 4 gallons of wort.  Specific gravity:  apx. 1.060 for 4
gallons.


        The key to the taste of this beer is the carmelization of the first
runnings.  I caught the first quart of clear runnings in a pyrex measuring
glass and microwaved them for 15 minutes along with a half pound
of brown sugar.  


     Boiled for 100 minutes, the last 70 minutes with the hops. 
This is not a bitter beer but has a great caramel flavor.  After
the boil, I had 3.5 gallons with a SG of 1.070.


     This was the second time I tried Wyeast #1969 yeast.  The
first time, the yeast floc'd out too fast.  This time, I
agitated the carboy every day to get the yeast back into
circulation.  It seemed to work since the final gravity was lower
than expected. (1.010).  Primed with 1/2 cup of corn sugar.
                          
        The bottles carbonated within three weeks.  The beer turned out 
tasting very similar to McEwans.  I am not much on competitions, but would 
consider entering this beer.

Subject: Flood water analysis




Does anyone living in Northern California have any idea what our water
looks like these days, since we've had so much flooding?  A friend of
mine who has a big aquarium setup, said that he suspected that they
had added a lot of chlorine to compensate.  I'm planning on mashing
some pale ale malt this weekend, and I'm not sure what water treatment
to perform.

Subject: "dropping" and British ales


Some time ago, there was a brief discussion on this list about the 
practice of "dropping" British ales, as recommended by Wheeler and 
Protz.  Dropping involves transferring the ale from primary to secondary 
after only about a day or two of active fermentation.  In the transfer, 
the fermenting ale is dropped from the siphon from a height of several 
feet, in order to provide some aeration.  The homebrewers who tried this 
said that it produced noticeably smoother, rounder beers, and also 
seemed to accentuate the hop character of the beers.  My question is 
this:  how do these beers fare over the long haul -- do they degrade 
more rapidly than non-dropped beers due to the infusion of oxygen?  I 
guess another question is whether others of you have tried this -- if 
you have, how did you like the results, both short-term and long-term?

Subject: skunking and beer colour


If skunking is related to light and the reaction is inhibited by brown beer
bottles, is the degree of skunking experienced by a beer exposed to the same
light source dependant on the colour of the beer.  What I am thinking is
that should I bottle my brown ales, porters and stouts in the green bottles
I have and my pilsners etc in brown bottles.

        The stuff in stout that assists mothers breast feeding is simply the
fact that stout is full of 'fuel.'  "Beer is Food," and big beers like
stouts simply have more 'food' than lesser beers. And the added benefit is
that the 'medicine' is usually eagerly consumed!
        When I was training as a nurse in Gladesville in Sydney, and on 3
months specialty training at Sydney Hospital, it was not uncommon for the
physicians to order Guinness for patients who were recovering from surgery,
or who were mal-nourished. Usually ordered as "one bottle of Guinness with
meals," the stout was ordered from the pharmacy, just like other drugs. 
        
Allergies..
        FWIW, many patients who say they are allegic to certain drugs, are
not clinically. Reports of the effects of consuming the allergic drug are
often related as "felt nauseous;" these are side effects of the drug, not
indications of allergic reaction, whereas skin eruptions, sweating, pallor,
swelling of the airway and vascular changes are evidence of allergic
reaction. The anaesthetist would note the patients statements, and then
proceed to nuke them with similar drugs, and no reaction would occur.
        Recently, a customer complimented my rye beer, stating that he
preferred it to my other beers; as he was allergic to wheat he had never
tried my wheat ale. I didn't tell him that most of my beers use wheat as a
'head-grain,' and that my rye beer has more wheat in it than any other,
including the wheat ale. He has been drinking these beers for over a year now.
        IMHO, and not to dispute anyones experiences with allergic
situations, which can have life threatening outcomes, it is apparent to me
that many 'allergies' are more psychological than physiological.

Subject: Thanks & a recipe


Just a short thank you to Dave B. and Harlan for the CO2 purging input
and to Al K. for several assists and especially to Pat and Karl for the
resurrection of the HBD.


A week or so ago, I agreed with the idea of posting recipes and promised
I would put my recipe where my mouth is. This is an exceptional American
Pale Ale house beer (thanks to Allen Ford). I was a confirmed lager brewer
'til Allen brought this to a Bock'n'Ale-ians meeting a few years ago. The
13th batch is in primary now, I must like it. The combination of grains
works best, but I've used all US, all Belgian and different percentages
and it's always great. The mash temp is also flexible from 155 to 160.
So, here it is:


Just Beer


for 5 gallons


4.5 Lb-US 2-row
4.5 Lb-Belgian Pale Ale (British works too)
0.5 Lb-Belgian Carapils


Single Infusion mash at 158F for 75 Minutes (12 Qts water)
Sparge with 175F water to yield 6.5 gallons to kettle


25 Gm-Kent Golding pellets(6.0% AAU) for 60 minutes
25 Gm-Mt Hood pellets(5.1% AAU) for 2 minutes
25 Gm-Mt Hood pellets-dry hopped in secondary


90 Minute boil


Ferment with Wyeast 1056


OG: 1.055
FG: 1.013
IBU: 28
Color: 7 SRM


Another thanks to Dion H. for the Red Ale recipe and this simple
recipe format.

Subject: pH adjusting


I'm looking for some practical advise for adjusting the pH of my sparge
water.  I'm a novice grain brewer and have done a few batches without
adjusting the pH of my alkaline tap water.  Results so far have been
good, but I'm always working for a better ale.  


I've read about this in Papazian and Miller's books snd have searched
some FAQs but have found some conflicting advice.  


What are you using to adjust the pH?  What pH are you trying to reach? 
Would you recommend adjusting the pH of the mash water (my tap water pH
is about 9)?  If you use lactic acid or phosphoric acid where do you get
it?

Subject: Filtering Flattus


Spankster, regarding your HBD Post:


I have what may be a stupid question, but here  goes anyway.  I have 
been extract brewing for close to two years now, with much of my 
product being consumed by me.  I have never really had a problem with 
gas and bloating until my last two batches.  It's really bad!  I have 
tried the gas-x, etc., but find no relief.  I have read that the 
yeast ferments substances in your bowels, thus causing the extra 
wind...


A couple of observations. First, it is not the yeast that is causing
your gaseous discomfort. What is happening is that certain,
unfermentable sugars from your brew are getting into your digestive
tract where they are not easily digestable. they go into your large
intestine largely unchanged where they are acted upon by certain
anerobeic bacteria that are fermenting it in much the same manner that
yeast acts on the simple sugars of malt. The resuslts are uniformly
unpleasent: large volumes of methane and carbon dioxide gas being mixed
with ketone byproducts that give flattus that, ahhh... distinctive aroma
that has driven your wife out of the bedroom. Unfortuantely, although
nailing down the cause is fairly simple, the cure isn't. You say you
have tried gas-x (simethecone) Have you tried bean-o (an enzyme compound
that helps break down the complex long-chain sugars into simpler more
digestible sugars)which often gives people who have similar problems
with beans (for the same reason) considerable relief. Failing that, you
might try activated charcoal tablets or capsules, which have a powerful
ability to absorb noxious odors (but will likely do little to eliminate
the gas problems itself). In my experience it is the potency of the odor
and not the volume of the report that wives have the most problem with
in any case. Another thing, You say that you first started having gas
problems recently. Have you changed your recipie recently? Perhaps
having additional malts with unfermentable sugars for "mouthfeel" may be
at the root of your troubles. You might try making a beer, as an
experiment, with a very high order of conversion to simple sugars, to
see if that has any effect on your flattus and borbourigny.


Best of luck,

I was given a recipe to make light cherry beer that said the following:
- -----------------------------------------------------
Mix - premier super light malt extract


Merlin Cherry Mix - 25 oz
1 pound of brown sugar
1 pound of malt extract

Thats it....


Seems to be missing some things (like hops and type of yeast to use) and I
don't want to spend money on quality ingredients for something that *might*
taste good.  I would like to make a beer that has the body of a bass ale
with a hint of cherry flavor or something like that.  I only have the
equipment for extracts and a single carboy right now, so some help with a
simple recipe would be greatly appreciated.  I wouldn't mind more complex
recipes either.  I hope to learn enough to buy more equipment and try them
sometime this summer!

Subject: Re: Low gravity blues


In reply to Ray Loves posting in HBD #2334


I have been experiencing the same problem lately.  the last three batches, 2
of my own and one of a friend, had an original gravity of about one half of
what was estimated.  My last batch, 5 gallons, used 6.6 lb. of liquid malt
extract, 1 lb. 2-row malt, 1/2 lb. Crystal 60 malt and 1/4 lb. Carapils
malt.  I was expecting an original gravity of about 1.053, but got a reading
of 1.026.  The other two batches had about the same results.  The malt
extract we are using all came from the same case of Northwest Gold that was
mail ordered and shipped directly from Northwest as the mail order supplier
was out of stock.


Two of the batches are still in carboys and one batch was just bottled.
Previous batches have not had this problem.  Could it be a bad batch of
extract, has anyone ever heard of this happening before?  If so how can that
be determined?  I have used Northwest extracts previously without this
problem.  If the extract happened to have been frozen during shipping could
this be the problem.  We have used two different hydrometers and both gave
the same readings.


I look forward to reading any responses anyone may have concerning this.

Hello All,

Phils Phalse Bottom and am not interested in a Gott cooler type of
mash/lauter tun.  I am thinking about converting a keg (Pico Brewing, Sabco,
etc) or purchasing a 15 gal ss pot with ball valve and thermometer.


Which do you recommend and why?

I'm trying to remember the procedure to salvage yeast out of my
secondary for reuse.  It has been discussed several times in the past 6
mos on the HBD, but I don't know which volumes. I tried to search for
the Brewery URL but couldn't get my engine to work. As I remembered:


I boiled 3 qt jars 1/2 full of water and sealed and cooled.
Used the 1st to wash the carboy back into the qt and let it stand 24hrs.
Discarded the top h2o and swirled in the 2nd 1/2 qt and let stand 1 hr.
Saved the top solution into the third jar for next batch.


9/10's of the slurry is left behind...is that right?
Should the yeast be fed as it has been 6 weeks abrewing?


Does anyone have a reference I should look up?


Thanks and my compliments to the new HBD homeowners.

George and others, I think you may be taking deadly serious risks
here.  Canning or preserving safely is a combination of proper heat
and proper pH.  Foods which have a pH below around 4.6 can be canned
using only a boiling water bath, but foods with a pH above 4.6 must be
canned using a high pressure canner with about 10 lbs. of pressure.
Almost all worts will have a pH of over 5.0, and hence should only be
pressure canned.  All canning jars should also have the proper seals,
bottle caps are not sufficient.  If you do not achieve a temperature
of around 240F at sea level with low-acid foods, such as wort, you run
the risk of "awakening" the botulism spores in your wort.  Botulism is
a very deadly nerve toxin which will kill you very dead, very quickly.
If you don't have a pressure canner do not fuck around with home
canning wort, it's not worth the risk.  Just because you haven't had a
problem so far is no guarantee that you won't on your next batch.

>>I've been using JM Easymasher(tm) in my mash tun for some time now and
I'm very happy with its performance.  I have experienced clear running
wort with only 8oz of recirculation and have never had a stuck sparge. 
But.. like many before me, I was frustrated with the air bubbles forming
in the hose because of the "ridge" on the tap.  Also, I had a hard time
adjusting the outflow especially when the tap was hot from heating. 
I've solved these quirks by replacing the tap with a 1/4" ball valve and
a hose barb for about $10.  Following is the materials list if your
interested:<<


I had similar problems, i.e., the air leaks and flow adjustment. I 
solved the air leak by filing off the ridge with the file on my trusty Swiss
Army knife. Also, I alleviated the adjustment difficulty by using a 
small pair of Vice Grips to grip the handle. Gives much finer control 
of the flow, and is quick and easy. 


(Note: Do not leave the vice grips on the valve while boiling!)

Subject: Best temp for Cold Break?


At what temperature "should" the wort be chilled down to to achieve the
most efficient cold break?  I have a 2 tier, 3 converted keg set up
with an "in-line" counterflow chiller which works quite well.  I was
wondering if it would be worth it for me to chill the wort as much as
possible to achieve as much cold break as possible, then run the wort
back through the chiller (except this time the surrounding water will
be from the hot water vessel) to bring the temp up to pitching temps.


Has anyone done this?  Is it worth it for me to make the changes?

My question concerns the material. I went with 1/2" PVS pipe. In order to 
clean the exterior of the pipe (cleaning to get dirt as well as the blue 
lettering off), I used some cleaning solution I picked up at the hardware 
store. I told the guy this was going to be used in a food application, 
and he said that as long as I washed with soap and water afterward, it 
would be ok. The solution seems to be mostly alcohol, but has quite a 
powerful smell. The smell seems to have left the pipe. I am still 
concerned though, about having used this. Additionally, it did not quite 
get all the lettering off. Any comments about using or not using this 
manifold.


Thanks,

It all depends on the pH of your tap water.  I use 1/2 teaspoon of 88%
lactic acid to reduce 5 gallons of sparge water to a pH of 5.7.  I
determined this through trial and error - adding a little bit of lactic
acid at a time while checking the pH.  My tap water pH seems to vary
slightly over the year so I don't just assume that 1/2 teaspoon is the
right amount - I always check the pH.

I've had four inverted fermenters in continuous use for over three years.
My experience is the exact opposite of the Ganister and Fields architectural
firm.  My carboys rest on lazy-susan bearings, ~$2 at the local hdwr store.
Wiggle the bearing, sediment slides into neck.  That easy.


So Stuart, YMMV.


I'll be reverting to upright fermentation soon for twenty gallon batches,
and I'll miss the inverted carboys.  They've certainly made things easier.

Hello Fellow Brewers!


I am looking for a new brew pot.  I have a SS 5 gallon pot now for my
extract batches and an 8 gallon enamal on steel (blackish with white
speckles).  I want to get a new 8-10 gallon SS pot but I have a few
questions:


1)  How much.  I read about some on the hoptech homepage.  They had a
Vollrath 38.5 qt (9.6 gal) for $170.  This is kind of expensive, but I do
want quality.  This will last a long time. (well, it should).  Any other
suggestions?


2)  Can I heat this new pot (whatever it is) on the stove.  I have a
standard gas stove?  I do not want to but a propage "burner" just to heat
this sucker unless I have to.


3)  How easy is it to convert this to the easymash system.  I have been
reading the threads about drilling stainless, and it doesn't seem to
hard...*swallow*  It will be scary if I pay > $150 for a brewpot.


4)  Do you ever take out the easymasher.  Is is now a permenant part of
your brewpot?  What if you want to go back and do a quickie extract batch?
Does it just sit in there doing no harm?


5)  Is the easymasher hard to clean.  


6)  What about hops.  Do they get stuck down there?  Pellets?


Whew!  That is a mouthfull.  Any help you give would be greatly
appreciated.

Bad news here.  I have seen yeast (read this to be yeast or bacteria, I
didn't test it) grow in malt extract.  Over two years ago I split a "case"
of malt extract from James Page in the Twin Cities with my bother in law.
With a week a got a call from my bother in law asking if my bags of malt
were swelling up and that his had blown up like a balloon. As of that day
they had not but they had developed a white froth on them.  By the next time
I brewed the packs had swollen and when opened it had a sickening yeasty
smell.  Though the LME did have a slight "stale/old" flavor it wasn't strong
enough to come through in a dark beer, which is what I started making.


Two other thing if you brew a batch of beer once a month and use 6lbs in it
that last batch of LME will be 10 months old and could be stale.  I also
know two people how have bought 60lb buckets of LME only to open them up one
day to find mold growing on it. 


I do know people how have bought 60lb buckets and had no problems.  I just
want to point out that this is not problem free.  Think carefully before
spending $65 plus shipping.


PS "spraying vodka on the surface of the extract as a precaution" won't do
much but make you feel better.
