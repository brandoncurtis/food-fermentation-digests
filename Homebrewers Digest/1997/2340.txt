Yes, phosphate in one and pyrophosphate in four of the seven steps prior to
squalene.

Could be at least part of it. While I'm aware that this mechanism is
recognized I don't believe that its importance has been fully established
(Steve may have more recent info than I) and thus assume that the control
is mostly via the rate of biosynthesis of HMG-CoA reductase. But certainly
anything which reduces the rate of conversion of Ac-CoA (i.e. activity of
the enzyme) or increases the equilibrium concentration of mevalonic acid
would result in pooling of Ac-CoA making it available for ester synthesis.


HMG-CoA reductase (a subject near and dear to my liver and heart - were it
not for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors I'd be unable to eat eggs Benedict) is
well established as the regulatory enzyme for sterol prodution but the
details of what inhibits HMG-CoA reductase biosynthesis are not fully
understood.

I don't but according to my model no Ac CoA would go down the sterol
pathway and it would pool. I would, thus, expect more esters in a beer
where sterols had been supplied. There has been lengthy debate on whether
cold trub should be removed or not with, if I recall correctly, the general
consensus being that it should be, from lagers at least, if the cleanest
result is to be obtained.


>Anyway, I guess my original question was how would NON-oxygen related
>growth restriction (like lack of FAN) relate to ester formation.


In higher animals it is known that dietary cholesterol inhibits
biosynthesis of HMG-CoA reductase (as ergosterol seems to inhibit it in
yeast) but _fasting_ has an inhibitory effect as well. Could it be that
yeast behave in a similar way with a dearth of FAN (or any of a list of
other essentials including oxygen) resulting in reduced HMG-CoA reductase
synthesis?


>I suspect an extensive understanding of the regulation of various

I expect so but it's fun to speculate!

I want to be clear that I don't disagree with Dave Burley on the value of
using reducing (note "reducing" - the sugar reduces copper ion and is thus
oxidized) sugars to detect the end of fermentation. You don't have to
fiddle with a delicate hydrometer or sterilize it or the test jar. The
intent of my post was to point out that it is imperfect in ways similar to
the hydrometer: it responds to non fermentable sugars with reducing ends
(just as the hydrometer does) and can't tell you when all the sucrose is
consumed (Belgian brewers beware). Despite these failings it _does_
indicate, by assymptotic approach to a constant reading, that fermentation
is over. I'm going to go back to the drug store and be more persistent
about getting a kit.

        <snip>
  I posted this same concern about 2 years ago.  The idea of canning 12 
  quarts of starter in one afternoon was too appealing to pass up 
  though.  I prepare about 3.5 gallons of 1.040 wort, then adjust it to 
  pH 4.1 - 4.2 with acid blend, and use my brew pot as a water-bath 
  canner.  My only concern with this was how the yeast would do, first, 
  in this environment, then pitched in wort at normal pH.  So far, I 
  have noticed no difference in using these canned starters with 
  starters of normal pH that are prepared just prior to brewday.  I 
  assume you could adjust the pH back to normal when ready for use, but 
  I don't think it is necessary.  This adjustment may seem like overkill 
  to most people who have had no problems canning in the past, but it is 
  cheap insurance.  If anyone is thinking of canning wort, or anything 
  else, I strongly encourage reading the Ball Blue book of canning 
  (probably available at your public library).

I'm surprised to see the negative comments about vodka - I have seen

bottles for yeast harvesting, and when harvesting yeast from carboys. 
Why wouldn't it work in this application?

HBD-
 
I had a thought, OK more of a question, regarding the current thread on
botulism toxins developing in improperly "canned" wort.
What is the toxicity of a botulism toxin grown in a quart of wort, then
diluted to 5 gallons (assuming an acidic and alcoholic medium created in the
starter stops botulism activity) and enjoyed one, maybe five bottles at a
time?Would the toxin be diluted to non-health threatening levels?
 
Jacques queries:
 
- -->
Eric, I thought Guiness uses exclusively roasted barley because it was less
taxed than dark malts ( black patent and chocolate ). Could you please tell
me where you saw the Guiness recipe that uses black patent malt?
 
Long life to the new HBD and its administrator.

Jacques-
 
I didn't mean to pretend I'm privy to Guinness' recipe.  I don't really know
if they use black patent or roasted barley.  I guess that was a WAG based on
Guinness clone recipies I have seen (TCNJOHB, pages 206-208).  My only real
point was substituting roasted barley or chocolate malt for black patent can
tame the charcoal bitterness in stout recipies if you don't like it.  Perhaps
then it aint really a stout.  Thats why we homebrew.

Subject: Inexpensive brew kettle


Several folks had mentioned needing a vessel to do at least full-wort boils
for 5-gallon extract brews, and maybe a bit larger. Someone had mentioned a
$30 or so 8-gallon speckled enamel pot. 


I had no luck finding the 8-gallon speckled enamel pot, even for the
hardware to special order for me. So I went to one of the local restaurant
supply stores and wandered around. Really cool. Found a number of
interesting tools and gadgets. 


I found a 15-gallon stainless pot without a lid for less than $100, but I
found another treasure even better. Assuming you resolve the aluminum vs.
stainless debate the way I did, which is that aluminum is OK, then you'll
find this deal interesting. They had a 12-gallon lightweight aluminum tamale
steamer with lid and steamer bottom for $33.95. It's a bit more squat and
short than your basic stockpot, but entirely workable. I had hoped to find
something I could afford that would allow me to make full-mash double
batches (yielding 10 gallons) and I couldn't quite do it. Maybe I'll find a
way to adjust my recipes to an 8-gallon yield (got to find some use for that
10-gallon cornelius keg I bought). 


Anyway, this is NOT a 15-gallon SS brewpot, but it seems like a much better
value than an 8-gallon speckled enamel job.

I am glad to see this particular thread making its rounds right now as
I just spent Tuesday making some "sterile" wort for a starter I have
since begun. In the process of making the wort, I bottled (not canned)
5 beer bottles with wort that had only been boiled, not pressure
cooked. I wanted to pressure cook them, but I couldn't find any mason
jars or lids anywhere (not even on the web for mail order!).


Scott makes some good points about being very aware of the dangers of
botulism in improperly canned foods. To help clarify this point further,
here is an extract from a web site that discusses food-borne illnesses:


 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


http://www.fmi.org/media/bg/bact3.html


1.Botulism
  --------


Although rare, botulism is a public health concern because it can 
be fatal if untreated. Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that 
causes the disease, exists in soil, water, honey, feed, manure and 
sewage, on fruits, vegetables and other plants, and in the intestinal 
tracts of animals and fish. 


Botulinum produces spores that can contaminate raw foods during 
production, harvesting or processing. If the foods are not properly 
processed, the spores will germinate, grow and produce a toxin in the 
food. One of the most potent poisons known, this toxin affects the 
nervous system and can cause death even in small amounts. 


Preferring an oxygen-free environment, botulism is usually associated 
with low-acid canned foods that have been improperly processed, stored 
or consumed without proper heating. Although potent, the toxin can be 
inactivated by boiling food for 10 to 15 minutes. 


Most botulism outbreaks have been traced to home-canned foods. The 
foods involved in a majority of these outbreaks include: 


Low-acid canned vegetables, such as green beans, corn, spinach, beets, 
asparagus, peppers, pimentos and mushrooms. Fish and fish products, 
such as fermented or smoked fish and fish eggs. Home-canned fruits and 
vegetables. Condiments, such as chili peppers, tomato relish, chili 
sauce and salad dressing. 


Meat, poultry and dairy products have rarely been associated with 
botulism, although several outbreaks have been attributed to baked 
potatoes, sauteed onions, potato salad and pot pies. In each case, 
the foods were cooked and held at temperatures that allowed the growth 
of botulinum before being served. 


Symptoms 
- --------


Botulism can develop within two hours to 14 days of ingesting contaminated 
food, but symptoms usually appear within 12 to 36 hours. In general, the
shorter the incubation period, the more severe the disease and the higher 
the fatality rate. 


The most common symptoms are gastrointestinal disturbances, sometimes 
followed by nausea, vomiting and possibly diarrhea. Blurred or double
vision and difficulty in swallowing and speaking are also common symptoms. 
Fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headache and constipation may occur.  Certain 
muscles become paralyzed, and the paralysis eventually spreads to the 
respiratory system and heart. Death usually is caused by respiratory
failure. 


Prevention 
- ----------


Botulism can be prevented by strictly following safe, approved and up-
to-date methods for canning foods and by thoroughly heating them (boiling 
for 10 to 15 minutes) just before serving. All cooked foods should be held
at temperatures higher than 140F (60C) and rapidly cooled to 40F (4C)
or below. 


 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


It seems there are three ways to prevent infection:
1) Pressure-can;
2) Make fresh wort prior to use; and
3) Reboil previously bottled wort prior to use.


Anyone see a problem with item 3?

Subject: re:  Best temp for Cold Break?


Mike Otten asks what temperature "should" the wort be chilled to in
order to achieve the most efficient cold break.  Greg Noonan says the
wort should be brought from boiling to an ice slurry very quickly to get
the best cold break.  On a homebrew scale, that's pretty tough to
accomplish.  So the answer to the question is probably "as cold as you
can get it in a short period of time."


The best I've been able to accomplish in my system is boiling to about
50_F (10_C) in a matter of seconds by running wort through my immersion
chiller which is sitting in an ice bucket.  I get a big cold break, and
my beers come out quite clear.  Then again, I get clear beer just by
using an immersion chiller in the usual way, so I don't know how much
practical difference it makes at the amateur level.

Subject: Home Malting / Cheery Beer / PV?S? Manifold


A very happy Waitangi Day to our friends in New Zealand.


Guy Gregory tried malting at home.  Can't comment much on the procedure but
I'll present a data point on the moisture content.  Guy writes:


"He graciously donated a 5 gallon bucket of barley for this task.  It turns
out that is about 45 lbs....I weighed out 10 lbs on my bathroom scale....I
weighed it at 30 hours, or when it quit smelling really great in my house and
the grain got dry to the touch,  and the grain weighed 9 lbs."


My experience with M&F 2-row pale ale malt  is that a 55-lb sack takes 2
5-gal buckets, with a little left over.  Let's say 11 gallons for 55 lb, or 5
lb/gal.


Guy's raw grain weighed 45/5 or 9 lb/gal.  He malted 10 lb of this or 10/9 =
1.1 gal.  This weighed 9 lb after kilning, for a "density" of 9 lb/1.1 gal or
8.2 lb/gal.  Compare this with the 5 lb/gal "density" of commercial malt.
 Looks like your moisture content was still up there.

Ken, the simplest thing to do is brew your favorite "light" extract recipe
and add 1 bottle of cherry extract, available at HB stores.  This produces
quite satisfactory results.  At one bottle per 5 gal, the cherry flavor will
be quite noticible; if you're looking for something more subtle, use 3/4 of
the bottle.  Also, hop your beer lightly (20 -25 IBU) and go easy on (or even
delete) flavor and aroma hopping so as to avoid "competition" between the
hops and the cherry extract.  Add the extract at bottling to preserve the
aroma.

R. Wayne McCorkle made a Mash/Lauter tun manifold out of "PVS" (PVC?).


PVC's service temperature is only 140F and from what I've read (here, I
think), it can leach chemical compounds into the wort under conditions of
high temperature and low pH (comapred to water).  You'd be better off with
copper or CPVC.  CPVC is rated to 180F and is approved for potable water.
 Lutzen and Steven's book "Brew Ware" (did I get that right?) has a brief
discussion about CPVC manifolds.


As far as the cleaning fluid goes, chances are it's evaporated off by now,
but it could have left some sort of residue behind or even reacted with the
plastic.  Use some fine sandpaper instead to remove the markings.  And if
you're concerned about "scratched plastic" being hard to sanitize, remember
that your mash tun components need not be *sanitized* (though they should
always be kept "clean"), since the wort produced in contact with them will
soon be boiled.  Wipe the parts down with a little iodophor before use if you
wish.


I'd also avoid cementing the pieces together.  Simply press-fit the parts.
 The cement may add more chemical troubles to your worries.  If you're afraid
that the parts will disassemble during use, drill a hole throuh the joint and
run a stainless-steel bolt through, to pin it together.  Hint:  if you cut
the long sections of the manifold into two or three pieces small enough to
fit in your sink, and assemble them with slip couplings, you can soak the
whole thing in sanitizer before use.

I'll leave our esteemed comrades to comment on specific kettles (actually,
better if you read the archives), but there is a sharp dividing line
between the largest of the standard stock pots (7.5 gal) and the larger
10+ gal pots. 7.5 gal is workable for all-grain, but it's a little tight
when you take into account extra water for boil-down, hop absorption, etc.
If you kettle-mash, it's large enough for about 15 lbs of grain,
understanding that the mash needs to be thin enough to stir easily. Price
is typically about $75. I use one for my apartment brewing and it works
well, but Barleywines and Imperial Stouts would be problematic. 


Once you make the jump in price, you have some additional options. If you
want to go the Easymasher route, you can get a simple kettle with no
spigot. However, there are also models that can be outfitted with false
bottoms, etc. I'd probably go with a simple one and install an Easymasher,
but only because I've had such good experiences with the system. others
might share their own success stories with you. 


>2)  Can I heat this new pot (whatever it is) on the stove.


Yes and no. Al K. reports having used a 10 gal (Polarware?) pot on a
stovetop in his previous system and apparently it worked well. The 10 gal
size is probably the largest you can heat unless you have one of those
kick-ass professional stoves. I wouldn't try it without at least a decent
stove. It's possible you may have to leave the cover partially on, but
that works okay. 


>3)  How easy is it to convert this to the easymash system.
Your feet will feel cold, but it's pretty easy.


>4)  Do you ever take out the easymasher.
You can take it out, but you won't find much reason to.


>5)  Is the easymasher hard to clean.
I spend more time cleaning the inside of the kettle than the Easymasher.


>6)  What about hops.  Do they get stuck down there?  Pellets?


The Easymasher creates essentially a hop-back, with whole hops filtering
the break material as you drain the pot. An immersion chiller lets you
catch the cold break too. Pellets are sub-optimal with this system. You
lose the filtering capability and they might clog the screen. You can
easily remove the screen before boiling and leave just the spigot, perhaps
add a copper scrubber, then whirlpool the wort before draining.

Guy J.Gregory writes about his malting experience - great job Guy.
You note dense malt and low yeild for your malt.  I think your malt is
undermodified.


Commercial malts today malt for about 7 days and to achieve this speed
they use gibberellen - a plant hormone.  I believe that malting for the
whiskey industry does not use these hormones and takes 10 to 14 days.  I
don't have a reference under my nose, but 5.6 days is too short.


Your poor extraction may also be partly due to poor crush - likely.  I
suspect that your local HBshop would crush your malt in exchange for the
story or a small fee if the folks there are at all friendly and you are
a regular.
 
BTW - I understand that if your wife isn't home you can dry the green
malt and seperate the clums by placing the wet malt in a pillowcase
liner (zip it closed) and throwing it in the clothes dryer on low.


Your options for the current malt batch are to kiln it for a darker malt
or use it with a commerial pale malt at 50% - 50% or so.

Talk to the Filter Store. ( 800-??) or Zymurgy advert. I believe they sell
filters to produce bacteria free fluids which will allow you to do this without
risking infection from bacteria in unboiled water passing into your fermentation
vessel through a simple, roughly 5 micron, icemaker sediment filter.

It sounds to me like Guy Gregory was successful in his home malting efforts.
However, Guy, you need to mill your malt properly to get good extraction.  Take
it to your HB store and see if they will mill it. You can make a comparison with
the malt you normally buy, this way..  You could also try to mill a small amount
for a lab scale extraction. You could  "mill" it with a hammer.  - Messy but it
works.  Also try soaking it in ice cold water in the refrigerator for an hour or
so and wet milling it in your food processor or blender then quick mash it just
to see if you were successful in your first efforts.

Yes.  Just because you're boiling does not mean you've achieved a
temperature of 212F.  Most preserving books will strongly advice
people above sea level to pressure can, and to use a good pressure
canner that is capable of high pressures.  I've grown to enjoy life,
so I err on the side of caution, and will pressure can when
appropriate regardless of what I *think* I might do with it after it's
been canned.  How would you like the family pet to start licking up a
broken bottle of improperly canned wort?  I'm not trying to be an
alarmist, I just want to make sure everyone understands the facts, and
how serious the risks can be.  It's a subject that is commonly
misunderstood and filled with folklore.


With regards to using mason jars instead of beer bottles.  The tops
for mason jars have an almost glue-like seal.  These are designed to
preserve a vacuum inside the jar, and also to keep microbes out -
microbes that would like your nice sticky wort.  Bottle caps are
simply not designed for this.  You should always use a new mason jar
lid.  Mason jars and lids can usually be found at any major
supermarket.


A pressure canner will run about $100-$150 US.  If this puts you off,
realize that you can preserve a lot of things, especially over the
summer.  Peaches, chiles, wort for kreusening, etc.


An excellent book on the subject is


"Putting Food By, 4th Ed.", Greene, Hertzberg, and Vaughan.  It also
covers smoking, salting, drying, brines, home toxicology, ...


Hope this helps.

Greetings all,


        In HBD#2338, Ron LaBorde asked about whether using stainless steel
airstones might increase the risk of contamination, since the porous stones
should provide good hiding places for bacteria and wild yeasts.


        Ron's question points out clearly why the stainless steel stones are 
so nice.  Typical instructions call for boiling the stone for 20 minutes, 
both before and after use.  This very definitely kills off any nasties that 
might be around.  You can't do this with a plastic or plastic-and-"stone" 
aquarium airstone.

     Hi all,
     
     Scott Murman writes (quite emphatically) about the threat of botulism 
     in stuff over pH ~4.6.  He says that worts are over pH 5.
     
     Well, in my experience, worts are always below pH 5 (usually around 
     4.8), which may explain why nobody is dead yet.  The fact that 
     Clostridium botulinum doesn't pose a risk to wort, even when severely 
     underpitched and unaerated, also supports the notion that it cannot 
     function in wort.
     
     Canning wort without pressure cooking is recommended by the likes of 
     Dave Miller, and practiced by many homebrewers.
     
     What is the deal?  Is pH below 5 safe, or not?
     
     I looked in Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology but found it 
     useless in this case (I doubt that I'll ever be inclined to add bile 
     to my wort to inhibit the growth of Clostridium).

Dear Brewing Collective:


The HBD is a fantastic medium for learning.  Thanks to all of you brew gurus
who take the time to teach us newbies!!


I'm just getting ready to leap into the all grain universe.


Due to both limitations in my storage space as well as a small 
(honest!!) personal consumption volume, I am going to be resizing 5 gallon
batch volume recipes down to 3 gallons.  I also want brew day to be as
simple as I can make it, so I'm going to take a shot at the no sparge technique.


I was thinking about taking 60% of the grain bill for a 5 gallon recipe 
to convert it to 3 gallons, and then adding 1/3 more grain as an offset for
the no sparge.


Does this look workable to any of you?


If so, should I use the first runnings only, or should I also think about 
doing a batch sparge on top of this?


Thanks for your help!  Randy

 ... by tasting *really* good I imagine  :-)


So many objections to this come tumbling to mind that it's hard to offer
them in any order.  Personally, when I first noticed the elaborate grain
bills in some of the winners I thought they were clearing out their
grain closets, but now I too am an elaborate grain-bill brewer and won't
go back.


Routinely, I'll use at least four grains in nearly any beer I make, ale
or lager: a base malt, something(s) for body and flavor, something for
color and almost invariably some flaked wheat for the right degree of
heading (not to get too nautical there) . I usually use two or three
varieties of malt for the flavor alone.  I'm into the flavor of biscuit
in my porters and stouts right now.


I can't argue the benefit of really knowing your ingredients by doing
"single malt" recipes at first (BTW, I think that term has great
marketing potential for breweries wanting to justify cheaping-out on
their grain bills, but I'm getting ahead of myself), but it's BORING.  A
homebrewer can afford the extravagence of a real cat's pajama's,
perfect malt flavor profile and a chord is simply richer than a note.


After brewing some "single malt" recipes, any newbie all-grain brewer
should immediately get to know their adjunct malts.

Subject: Lazy Yeast Propogation (not propogating lazy yeast)


In HBD #2337  George De Piro (George_De_Piro`at`berlex.com)  responds to CD
Pritchard about canning wort in beer bottles.  As yet-another-way,  I
use a pressure canner in the following way and haven't had any seal
failures (a pressure cooker would work fine too if your bottles fit).   


Every so often, as needed, I half-fill six 12-oz clean (not sanitized)
beer bottles with bitter wort from a not-too-extreme batch of either an
ale or lager wort, and autoclave them.   Before putting them in the
canner, I place a crown bottlecap on each and hold it in place with a
twist of 5" square of aluminum foil.  The caps can jump off the bottles
during the process otherwise.  After hitting them for 20 mins at 15 lbs
(250F) in the canner, I let it cool until pressure is back to normal,
still very hot though, and then cap them with my bottle capper leaving
the foil in place.  Although it often tears a little it still helps
protect a sterile zone about the cap during storage.


I pitch from little 2-dram screw cap vials from my yeast bank and step
up as usual.  In pursuing my quest for just how much I can relax and
still brew perfect beer, I propogate my yeast samples in a similar way.
After opening a newly started foil pack (Wyeast) I dribble sample into
the pre-sterilized vials and refrigerate them.  I find they keep for
months.  I sterilize the vials in my canner.  I've gone from plating on
agar-nutrient in petri dishes, to agar-nutrient slants, to gelatin
slants, to this.  This is easy.  I'm glad the laboratories go to the
trouble they do but I find I don't need to at home.


I also keep a few jars of washed slurry in the fridge for my favorite
strains.  I pitch the whole jar then.  I'm more nervous about the slurry
though and only use if for a few generations.  I keep on hand a couple
"washing kits" of 1 qt. sterile water in a mason jar, and 1 empty but
sterile pint mason jar.  I wash the slurry from a batch as described in
The Brewery's library and keep the result in the smaller jar.  It makes
a good big pitch.


I like having a supply of both ale and lager sterile wort on hand.  I
think in practice it's probably a small matter of difference to the
yeast, but it's easy to do and it gets the yeast started on the same
spectrum of sugars they'll work in.  


Well anyway,  that's my current lazy way.  If I can get any lazier - I
will.


Cheers

Subject: wort more bitter than beer


AlK commented recently that finished beer tastes more bitter than the
unfermented wort.  George De Piro argued the opposite case.  Of course
they were talking about subjective impressions, so I'm not about to say
that either one is wrong, but my experiences have been more in line with
George than with Al.


I never knew why until recently.  In the last issue of The New Brewer,
there is an article called "Better Utilization of Hop Products" by David
Hysert, which explained why some bitterness is lost during fermentation.


A quick and dirty summary of how hops bitter beer:  Water-insoluble
bitter alpha acids found in hops are transformed into iso-alpha acids
during the boil.  These iso-alpha acids are more water soluble than
alpha acids, so they will stay in solution and give the beer its
bitterness.


But the iso-alpha acids are still not very soluble.  In fact, it is
difficult to achieve a .01% solution of iso-alpha acid in beer, no
matter how many hops you use.  That's probably why when you brew your
"100 ibu" IPA, it is not much more bitter than your 75 ibu batch (which
is just under .01%, according to the Hysert).


The iso-alpha acids, as well as the insoluble alpha acids, are "surface
active," so when your beer foams up during fermentation and sticks to
the walls of the fermenter, or if the foam is blown off or skimmed, you
are losing some bitterness.  (Ever notice how bitter the foam tastes?) 
Also, as CO2 is produced by the yeast and pH of the beer drops, the
solubility of the iso-alpha acids goes down, and you lose even more
bitterness.


So in a very real sense, the ibu's are dropping as a beer ferments out.
The moral of the story:  don't panic if you pucker while tasting your
O.G. sample.


P.S.  For those living at high altitudes, according to this article the
rate of the isomerization of alpha acids doubles with each 10_C increase
in temperature.  Therefore, you need to either increase boiling times or
increase hop usage (or, gad!, boil under pressure) to get the same
bitterness as a sea-level boil.

In HBD#2337 Chuck discussed some difficulties with his first decoction:


He added 0.9 qts/lb to mash-in at 131 F.  He then pulled the thickest
40-50%, ..., returned it to the main mash, and ... wound up at 145 F. 
He was targeting 158 F for conversion.


My $0.02:  1)  Increase water to 1.4 qts/lb
           2)  mash-in at 135-40 F (helps reduce chill haze etc.)
           3)  Decoct 50 - 100% of the grain (add ice if necessary)
          4)  Shoot for 150-55 F for conversion(158 F is too high, IMO)
 - add grain back to main mash until strike temp is reached, then add ice
to decoct to cool to strike temp (Note:  this is MUCH easier than
heating the entire mash)
           5)  sparge *slowly* (1 qt/min or less) with 2 qts/lb `at` 170F


This is a simple single-decoction mash schedule.  I will be using it on
my next Munich-style Helles lager.


Don't give up!  You can easily make great beers using a
decoction schedule.  My first few decoctions were exercises in
frustration.  All I had to go on was Noonan's "Brewing Lager Beer".  My
results were never even close to his.  Gradually, I developed my own
technique that works well *with my brewing setup*.  Knowledge gleaned
from the HBD over the years has helped as well.
