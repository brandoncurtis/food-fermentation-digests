Having done home malting on several occasions, I was impressed by Guy's success
and methods on his first go-round. If Guy started out with 10 pounds of barley
and ended up with 9 pounds of malt, assuming some losses from physical ( grains
and rootlets) and chemical (CO2 evolution) (( total losses around 10 -15 % on a
dry weight basis are typical for commercial malting)) causes, it looks like he
got back to, at least approximately, the original moisture content of the
original barley (whatever that was). Hand dry malt has a moisture content of
5-8% and is then ready for curing at a higher temperature. 


Your calculations show a 8.5 - 5 = 3.5 or moisture content of at least 40% of
the original barley or 70% on a dry weight basis, which I'm sure doesn't match
Guy's original description of the barley being market ready. M&BS says barley
may come to the market with a moisture content of 15-25% but in order to store
it successfully it should be below this range or stored in special ventilated
bins. Given this information of losses and typical moisture content in barley
and malt, Guy's results have some creditbility.


 Either I don't understand your calculations which appear straight-forward or
there's something incorrect in your assumptions or whatever. It jingles with
cognative dissonance.  Guy should dry small samples of both at about 212F to a
constant weight to determine the actual % moisture for all of our edification.

To combine the sparge water with the first runnnings or to make a separate small
beer, OK. If you have thoroughly converted the starch you will have more trub,
but not a big deal.


My feeling is that too much is being made of the difficulties of sparging.  I
look at it as a process step just like mashing or boiling, you wouldn't not do
them, so why not sparge?  Not sparging may serve as an intermediate step, but it
is far from a difficult step and I would encourage all to move onto it as soon
as possible - even the first all grain batch.

Subject: Botulism/Iodophor $$$


I'm pretty concerned about the botulism thread, since I've been
"canning" (not pressure-cooking) wort for about 7 months now.  I've got
a couple more questions that I'd like to throw out:


1) Has anyone ever heard of a botulism case resulting from beer?
2) Is it possible that the well-known "preservative effects" of hops
   also counteract botulism?
3) What about the alcohol environment?
4) I know that there are lab tests for botulism -- does anyone know
   of any for *home* use?


On another topic, I've found a way to save money on iodophor that I
wanted to share.  Many of you probably already knew about this.  Go to
your local restaurant supply and buy iodine-based sanitizers by the
gallon.  My best deal (so far) is $23.69 for a gallon of a product made
by Diversey.  One word of caution, however: be sure to check the
dilution rates required for your desired ppm's.  I found another similar
product for only $6.40/gal. *but* it required five times as much to
reach the same ppm.  BTW, they also had some *fantastic* deals on
kettles, utensils, measuring devices, thermometers, you name it.  (The
exact same thermometer that I'd paid $12 for in the brewshop was selling
for $3.90!)  A trip to your local restaurant supply will be *well* worth
your while!  Many of them also carry used equipment as well.

Delano DuGarm warns:


 ....While botulism is quite rare, it is most often caused by home-canned
food, and its effects are irreversable.......


While we all agree that botulinum toxin can be hazardous to one's
health, it is not a particularly stable chemical.  It can easily be
destroyed by heating the effected liquid to 80 C for 30 minutes or boil
for 15 minutes.  If your starter was crawling with botulism toxin, you
may want to put it in the microwave and nuke it for 20 min.  But then
again, why take chances?  Boltulinum toxin is several hundred thousand
times more deadly than VX (a nerve agent as seen (not very accurately)
in the annoying movie "The Rock"). 


BTW, I'd like to see what has caused more deaths, botulism or pressure
canning accidents?

Subject: Re: Drilling enamel pots






Hello all,


        In #2340, Greg Moore asked about drilling enamel-on-steel pots,
concerned about chipping problems.


        I've done this twice now, and I probably worried more than necessary. 
First, I put some masking tape on the outside of the site, to keep the drill
bit from slipping and to help hold the enamel in place.  Then I drilled an
1/8th inch guide hole, with a fairly low speed cordless drill, with no
problems.  For the main drilling, I used a new 3/8th inch high speed bit.  On
my first kettle, I made the mistake of using my slow corless drill, which bent
up the steel a bit.  A 1200 RPM corded drill did just fine for cleaning up the
first hole and drilling the second kettle.  Maybe I got lucky, but I got no
noticable chipping.  The bare steel edges are covered up by the edges of the
Easymashers that I installed.


        By the way, switching to the Easymasher (from a Phalse bottomed bucket)
made my brewing day much more pleasant (no scooping into a lauter tun, the
sweet wort cleared almost instantly, and the sparge was completely
problem-free, despite lots of sticky things in the mash.)  But my extraction 
rate fell a few points from what I had been getting.  Part of this might be 
the lack of insulation on the kettle letting the mash cool too much, so I'll 
adjust my sparging temperature.  Has anyone else noticed lower extraction with
an Easymasher?

Subject:  Decoction from Hell


Hello, 


I've been reading for awhile and came across the post from
Chuck about the decoction from hell.  What Chuck is
describing sounds really close to what I have been doing for
the last 10 batches or so.  I won't try to kid anyone and say
that I regularly do decoction mashes.  I call it Modified
Decoction Step Mashing (MDSM).  Basically, instead of
adding infusions of boiling water, I pull off some of the main
mash, heat it to a boil and then add it back to the main mash
to acheive the next temperature rest.  I use a kitchen strainer
(colander?) to pull out the grain and place it in a two-gallon
pot that already contains about ?  gallon of boiling water. 
This way I am not boiling (deactivating) the ezyme rich broth
in the main mash.  The boiling water helps to heat the
decoction quicker and it helps to bring the main mash to the
next step when I add it back to the main mash.  I usually
don't heat the decoction much longer then it takes to get it to
a good rolling boil.  It has taken me quite awhile to get a
good feel for the amount of decoction to pull in order to
achieve the the next rest temperature.  If you try this, don't
be shy and pull just a little bit of main mash to see how it
works.  It generally takes a hell of a lot more than you would
think, and them some.  I good thermometer is critical so you
can make sure you are not overshooting (or undershooting)
your nest rest temp.  Doing this quite a bit, I have found that
is is a lot easier to overshoot the temp and then add ice
cubes (a couple at a time) to fine tune downward to the rest
temp you want.  Adding ice is much preferable than pulling
another dectoct.


It's not really decoction, but it works great.  I definately get
better extraction and I have noticed a much maltier profile to
all of my beers.

Hal Ponders:


 .... I've heard it oft-said that there are no known pathogens in beer.
Supposing that the only reason you're canning wort is to cultivate a
yeast starter to make beer. If the yeast does its thing and beer is
made, wouldn't that kill any botulism baddies?........


It is not the botulism baddies (Clostridium botulism) you need to worry
about.  They (or at least their spores) occur in soil, agricultural
products, marine sediments, digestive tract of some fish and animals, in
fact you may have some in your intestinal track right now!  They
probably will be out competed in an inoculated starter, but by then it
is too late.  The baddies have done their anaerobic dirty work while in
the mason jar and produced one of the most lethal known substances on
earth (up there with shellfish toxin).  An incredibly small amount will
paralyze your respiratory system and you will die in a most unpleasant
way.  On a happier note, only about 15% of botulism cases are fatal.
However, in sublethal doses, it can damage the heart and nervous system.
 A near death botulism case will require many months to years to
recover.

Nothing excites me like a good discussion on botulism!  Looks like a lot
good sense out there on how to prevent it.  I personally would go with
pressure canning rather than reboiling.  Even the slightest risk of
ingestion of the toxin is way too much.  My handy dandy biological
warfare guide puts the LD50 at 7-10 nanograms (that's the amount where
you can expect half the people taking it to die).  A very small amount
to say the least.

     Well, in my experience, worts are always below pH 5 (usually around 
     4.8), which may explain why nobody is dead yet.


Sorry George, I wasn't trying to knock you down or anything.  Remember
that pH is a logarithmic scale, so the differences can be significant.
The cutoff point for what are considered "strong-acid" foods which
don't require pressure canning is arbitrary.  Some people will
recommend pressure canning everything above 4.0, others say 4.2,
others still will say 4.6.


     The fact that 
     Clostridium botulinum doesn't pose a risk to wort, even when severely 
     underpitched and unaerated, also supports the notion that it cannot 
     function in wort.
     
There's two things here, the botulism spores and the botulism toxin.
The spores themselves are everywhere, so just assume they are in
whatever you're going to try to preserve (they'll come from your
hands, the air, dirt, whatever).  The spores themselves are harmless,
but when they sprout, or whatever spores do, they create the botulism
toxin.  The spores will only sprout if the conditions are right;
namely a near vacuum (anaerobic), with a high humidity.  That pretty
much describes a can of wort which has been sealed by heating and
cooling, so botulism will "like wort".  In fact, they probably love
it, just like every other critter.  Remember, we're not talking about
finished beer here which has been fermented in a tank.  The old saying
"there are no known pathogens that can survive in beer" does not apply
to canning wort.


     Canning wort without pressure cooking is recommended by the likes of 
     Dave Miller, and practiced by many homebrewers.
  
There are two things that help make it easier to can wort.  The first
is that wort is almost always re-boiled after it has been canned.
Temperatures above 212F will kill the toxin in a relatively short
time.  The second thing is that wort does have a relatively high acid
level, call it 4.5-5.5 depending on the wort, so it's near the cutoff
level for being save to water-bath preserve.  People have most
definately died from preserving, it's not much of a problem these days
because not many people do home canning anymore, but there are still
about a dozen cases a year.


Someone asked about being able to dilute the botulism toxin to safe
levels by mixing it with 5 gallons of beer.  NO, NO, and NO.  Botulism
is very nasty stuff.  IF you had a quart of wort which produced the
toxin over a long period of time you would have enough to wipe out an
entire city.  I kid you not.  This is the kind of home biological
terrorism that many folks at the CIA spend nights worrying about (I
hope). 


Again, I'm not trying to freak everyone out, and I don't think
everyone should rush out and buy a pressure canner, I just want to
make sure everyone is educated on the subject.  If you are saving your
wort I would suggest using a mason jar with a fresh lid, and make sure
you boil it vigorously after you open it. If you live at a significant
altitude, I would suggest you educate yourself even further; it may be
necessary to acidify your wort or pressure can it to be safe.

 The Wyeast Labs pamphlet gives the fermentation range for 2112 yeast as

Subject: Pumpkin Beer


Greetings.  I have made two pumpkin ales.  I mashed the pumpkin in both.
That's what Charlie's book says.  This can be very difficult and frustration
to sparge.  Both batches suffered from stuck sparges.  


Spices in pumpkin beer?  The first batch had the spices added to the boil as
per Charlie's recipie.  This beer had a woderful pumpkin pie aroma during
the boil and in the finished beer (not as strong in the finished beer, but
there).  However, you had to think about it really hard to taste those
spices.  For the second batch, I added the spices to the secondary fermenter
with nearly the opposite results.  Very little spice in the nose (watch out,
the ginger comes through the most) but WOW did it have the flavor!  Be
somewhat cautious with the ginger and nutmeg, they tended to overpower the
other spices I used (cinnamon, cloves), but if you like those spices, go for it.


With regards to mash / not mash the pumpkin, I don't have any data.  I'll
leave that to someone else.

I made something similar with one of those orange carboy caps which have two
holes in them and a 5 gal. carboy.  I used 3/8" copper tubing as the
blow-off and 1/4" tubing for the "drain".  Hose clamps secured the cap to
the carboy and the tubes to the cap.  I purposely fermented at a lower than
normal temp. with a yeast I knew wouldn't give a violent ferment, but still
worried alot about the small blow-off plugging and the carboy becoming a BIG
grenade.  It did work without doing the grenade thing and did allow for
removal of the cold break and trub- along with 1/2 gal of wort (would have
been less had I waited for it to settle well).  If I was going to do it
again, I'd use a 6.7 gal. carboy and buy the Brewcap since it is fairly
widely used, is relatively inexpensive and has a relatively large blowoff
tube.  Until I got comfortable with the method, I'd still use a relatively
slow fermenting yeast, at least

Subject: Errors and bitterness


Brewsters:


In trying to unweave this magnesium bitterness/ water/beer thread I quoted Brew
Chem 101's author, Dr. Jansen, saying excess magnesium could result in
bitterness and sulfate gave a fullness and dryness.  The author is a PhD
bio-chemist and a certified judge.


AlK says in response to this:


> I have read some things in HBD quoted from that book in the past, but cannot
> find them because I can't reach Spencer's search engine and The Brewery's
> HBD search engine rejects "Brew Chem 101."  I recall that there was at least
> one glaring error posted that referenced that book.


Why is it you always try to belittle an author's published works and ignore a
quotation of them which is in contention with your point by saying "I found an
error in there"? It is logical non-sense to say "there is an error in that book
therefore everything is incorrect."


I am sure all books contain errors.  I'm sure any author of these hobby books
would be shocked to find his works in the Lake MIchigan Scrolls two thousand
years from now. As you know, even translations of the Bible are in contention
for contextual and translation errors and even content.  I find errors extremely
annoying and
 if there are too many, the author does lose his credibility for good authorship
and it is correct to doubt his expertise at least to write in a clear and
non-confusing manner. BUT it does not mean Everything in the book is incorrect.
I remember you saying you had gone through one author's book ( was it Noonan's
first?) and provided the editor with a list of errors.  Maybe you should publish
this here or at the Brewery or somewhere. That would be a useful activity we all
could benefit from. Other readers could also add their list as they read these
books.


To settle the issue at hand, I suggest a number of us HBDers in our homes and
club meetings take a Budweiser (since its quality is about as close to standard
as we can get) and add Epsom Salts and other salts at various levels and compare
the bitterness to see what the onset of bitterness perception induced by the
salt is.  Do the same experiment with water. Any thoughts as to protocol? Order,
randomness, etc.


AlK said:


" My whole point is that just like
CALCIUM sulphate increases the bitterness of beer and as sulphuric acid
increases the bitterness of beer, so will MgSO4, but by the action of the
sulphate on the *perceived* bitterness of the beer.  Suphates accentuate
the bitterness of the hops!  MgSO4 *is* bitter, but it is not bitter
*enough* to change the bitterness of the beer if it didn't have any
hops in it!"


We agree magnesium sulfate is bitter, since it is a mineral bitterness standard.
The point you made some days ago and appear to be making here was that magnesium
ion itself was not bitter, rather it was *just* the sulfate.  Do you still
support that? Personally, I would like this to be the case since it supports my
theory of the cause of some of the primitive tastes, but the literature I read
doesn't support it.


Sulfuric acid by itself is not bitter. All acids are sour. Mineral bitterness (
due to the hydroxide ion) and sourness ( due to the hydrogen ion) are opposites
and never occur together. It is a chemical impossibility.

>I've been following the scary thread about wort canning.  Scott Murman's
>comments are quite convincing.  Would the procedure laid out in Charlie
>Papazian's TNCJHB about preparing beer bottles of wort to be later used as
>starters be subject to the Botulism risk?


I'd say yes, they are subject to this risk.


Let's put this in perspective.  There are 10-30 outbreaks of botulism
poisoning per year, mostly from home-canned food.  Many more people die of
other forms of food poisioning than from botulism.  On the other hand, only
a few nanograms of the toxin are necessary for illness, and the only way to
denature the toxin is to boil the canned wort. (In which case, why boil it?) 


This means that you can probably get away with using Papazian's method for
years and years and never have a bad effect, especially if you examine the
wort carefully before using it, just as my mother canned low-acid
vegetables and fed them to her family for decades without ill effect.


On the other hand, when you get botulism poisoning, it is very unpleasant,
as one of the symptoms is that you stop breathing.  A nice case is
described at hammock.ifas.ufl.edu/txt/fairs/6305.


What we're dealing with here is a small risk of something very, very nasty
happening.  Do you feel lucky?  I don't, so I use a pressure canner, just
like I wear my seatbelt even when the pilot "has extinguished the fasten
seat belt sign."

Somebody was asking about SS brew pots in the 8- 10 gallon range...


I went through a similar exercise a few months back, and I eventually
wound up purchasing an 8 gallon DuraWare pot with a solid aluminum
sandwiched bottom and  lid, for about $135.  I got it from a restaurant
supply house in the city - if somebody needs the name I can dig it up.


For me, 8 gal is the perfect size, and so the Vollrath 38.5 qt was more
than I needed.  I use this pot on my "regular" gas stove in the kitchen, and
it works fine.  Boil-over problems have effectively been eliminated due to
the solid bottom and increased head-space.


Hope this helps,

OK, I believe you that I need to pressure can my wort for yeast starters 
if I am going to do it in advance. I have pressure canned my wort in the 
past. The problem is that (I assume since I cannot see it) the wort foams 
up in the mason jars and most of it winds up in the canning pot. Does 
this leave us with only making the wort when ready to use or is there a 
way to can without foaming.

Funny you should ask.  I've got an article coming out in the Spring Zymurgy
called "Baking for Brewers."  While it's  mostly about using spent grains
and last runnings in bread, I briefly address your question.  I've had
limited and spotty success using brewing yeast.  I'd suggest a good deal
more than the amount of baker's yeast you'd typically use - about 1 Tbs
thick yeast sediment (paste) per cup of liquid in your recipe.  Expect slow
rises, and possibly fruity flavors and aromas.  The last batch I made, a
whole wheat bread with with YeastLab Canadian ale yeast had such a banana
flavor it was like banana nut bread.  The ale had none of this flavor, BTW.
Ont the other hand, I have had some very flavorful breads with it.


I'd suggest boosting the yeast activity by making a sponge using the yeast,
all of the liquid, and 1/3 - 1/2 of the total flour and letting it ferment
for 1 - 3 hours before adding the rest of the ingredients.


Keep us posted on your success.

        At the Little Apple, we flush a PBW solution through the stone,
while doing the CIP (clean in place.) The pump draws solution at 150 F from
the bottom of the kettle and then propels it through the heat exchanger, and
then back to the top of the kettle, where it is sprayed on the interior
walls of the ketttle to start the process over. By opening the ball valve
that allows O2 to be blown through  the stone, you can 'back-flush' the stone. 
        The same is done with a H2O rinse and the acid rinse, when we do
one. Periodically, like once every 6 months, I take the stone assembly
apart, and give it a really good, high temp, 24-48 hour soak in PBW or
caustic, and then acid. I think that back flushing actually forces some wort
into the stones pores, and over time these build up to cause a decrease in
performance. But after the long soaks, it's as good as new.
        Other brewers I know flush them with a peracetic acid solution.
        These stones (25 micron..not bad for aeration, but not fine enough
for carbonation) are quite reasonably priced at 25 bucks, and come Monday, I
will call my supplier to see if he wants to sell to homebrewers. If so, I
will post his details.

Subject: Extract potential of Crystal


  Recently Mark Bayer quoted  data from Dave Miller's books in a comment
about calculating brewhouse efficiency . The value of 24 pts/lb/gal he used
for Crystal malt looked low so I checked my copy of "Homebrewing Guide" by
Dave Miller and sure enough found the same value that Mark had quoted on
page 300. The problem is that this number does not agree with the value of
33 - 37 pts/lb/gal (depending on type) that Papazian has in his Malt Table
on pgs 44-47 in "The Home Brewers Companion" nor does it agree with the
value of 32 pts/lb/gal (assuming 92% efficiency rather than the usual 100%)
that Noonan gives in Table 16 (pgs 208-210) in "New Brewing Lager Beer". 


 I noticed that Miller lists his grains alphabetically and that chocolate
malt (which 
WOULD be 24-28 pts) is conspicuously missing. While only a guess, I think
Miller is wrong here and interchanged the chocolate and crystal values by
mistake. Does anyone have any confirming data on the theoretical efficiency
of Crystal malt from other sources?? I have been using Papzian's values in
my grain bills and usually hit within a point based on the 87% efficiency
that my rig gets.

I'm trying to formulate an ESB recipe. The guy at the local homebrew shop

carmel flavor so predominant in Fullers ESB.


When I include 2 lbs of Crystal 60 in my recipe the color goes up to 32,
with 14 (SRM) being the maximum for the ESB category (AHA style guidelines).


So, is the homebrew shop guy wrong or SUDSW wrong or should I be using some

I don't ever recall tasting a skunked Corona [yes, I admit it; I drink

Corona uses clear or nearly clear bottles.  I don't recall a skunked
stout either, even though I've had those in clear bottles as well.

This is I assume referring to the Import Corona. I can recall drinking
Corona in Ensenada many years ago. This predates my current
understanding of brewing but there was a definite fault in the local
variety. It would usually take the first 3 beers just to get used to it.
The skunking of Corona FAR exceeds that of Heineken. (Of course I never
have tried a local Heineken tho'). Perhaps it's the urine in the export
Corona that reduces the skunking?

lots of splashing and lots of froth and that some breweries still do this
although the trend these days is not to. (I've always said that if PU,
which uses the sink, is suffering from the effects of HSA then I want HSA
in my beer). It's pretty easy to minimise exposure by conducting the runoff
into the boiler via a tube beneath the surface of the collected wort. The
initial runnings will, of course, splash onto the bottom of the kettle and
the surface will always be exposed to air but once there is enough wort to
cover the tube end there will be no further splashing.

Jeff Sturman asked about purging kegs with CO2. If beer is transferred into
a vessel which is full of CO2 any air in the beer is likely to flow from
the beer to the CO2 in accordance with the laws of physics. But if the beer
is being drawn from a container with a CO2 filled headspace (presumably a
unitank in the brewery) the beer should be oxygen free and the transfer
process should not permit any pickup. In this case the brewers procedure
should work well. Yes, a minute amount of O2 will dissolve when the first
beer splashes into the keg but the foaming associated with this first rush
should sweep it away. Remember also that the redox reactions of staling are
slow ones and that keg beer is usually consumed before they have a chance
to procede very far. Commercial operations are much more cautious when it
comes to air in their bottled beer.

Paul Edwards wrote "1 billion cells per degree Plato per milliliter of wort
pitching rate" when he clearly meant "million" (as indicated by the
subsequent calculations). Another thing which caught my eye was that a
dilution of 10:1 was mentioned and then counts given without specifically
stating that the final results included the effect of the dilution. I'm
sure they did but since the manufacturer is being accused of being off by
an order of magnitude and the dilution would lead to an order of magnitude
reduction I have to ask. I'm also curious as to whether the counts were
done automatically or with a haemocytometer. I also must say that I'm not
too happy about conclusions drawn from testing one package of each of two
strains of yeast.

Good morning all,


<<Charles Rich said:
 but it's BORING.  A homebrewer can afford the extravagence of a real cat's
pajama's, perfect malt flavor profile and a chord is simply richer than a note.

Well brewed beer whether it has one malt or ten is not boring.  It is
obvious that there are only a few classic style that can be brewed with only
one malt, but some of those are some of my favorite beers.  I do think
however that you can brew just about any classic style with 3 different
malts or less.  A lot of great music has only one note at a time.

Subject: Dropping question


I'm interested in the dropping technique and wondered if anyone has
tried this experiment.


I quit using a secondary fermenter about a year ago.  I'd like to try
dropping 1/2 the volume of the primary into a secondary, leaving the
rest behind to finish per my usual practice.  At bottling compare the
two for differences.  


I realize there are a lot of variables here besides just dropping - no
need to go into that.  It seems like a good way to get a feel for the
technique compared to my normal practice.  


Any comments from the Droppers?
