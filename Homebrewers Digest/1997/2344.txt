Subject: False bottom-pump it!


A. J. deLange ajdel`at`mindspring.com states:
| Tom Neary seeks comments on false bottoms in mash tuns. His post mentions
| that direct heat applied beneath a false bottom doesn't circulate very
well
| through the rest of the mash (this is not a problem with false bottoms in
| kettles where as the wort is thinner and the agitation more violent). The
| other problem with false bottoms is that lots of stuff works its way
| through during the stirring
| which is required to keep temperature evenly distrinuted even if a pump
is
| used. This results in a bit of a problem with crud in the vorlauf
(whether
| this is recirulated manually or with a pump) leading to longer lauter
times
| and sensitivity to mechanical motion of the mash lauter tun. I know
people
| who mash with false bottoms (using pumps) with success but I have given
it
| up.


I use a false bottom that rests on a lattice placed about three inches off
the bottom of a  barrel mash tun, (same as in the PICO System). The design
allows about 3 gallons of foundation water to be directly fired without
scorching by the Metal Fusion burner below. The mash is then circulated by
a pump through a RIMS and returned to the top of the mash. By using two
thermometers, one in the foundation water and the second in the center of
the mash, I am able to see if there is a differential and prevent too much
of an uneven condition from occurring. This is important during stepping up
as to not pass the targeted temperature. Since the tun is insulated and I
am careful not to "tunnel" through the grain, the temperature remains even
and maintained throughout the entire mash. The  inch dip tube is
positioned to leave about  gallon in the tun at completion and is pointing
slightly off center. This helps to prevent the grain particles which have
made it by the false bottom from being sucked into the system. In the
beginning of the mash about a tablespoon or so goes around the system and
reappears at the top of the mash. As to stirring am careful and do so only
down about six inches as to not break up the grain bed. 
My extraction rate is in the low 90's with this system even with a fast
sparge of 30-45 minutes.

Subject: conical fermenters-what do you use?


I would like to refine my brewing process to use only a 
single vessel for fermentation. A cone shaped vessel 
with a large valve in the bottom to drain off the trub
and spent yeast would be ideal. I've seen the Fermentap
product, but, would like something a little more industrial.
Since I brew 12 gallon batches I would like at least a 15 gal 
fermenter with at least a 1" valve in the bottom and a hole
in the top for filling / cleaning that is sealable for an
airlock.


Do any of you have / use a similar fermenter?


The US Plastics catalog has a plastic tank to meet these
needs for $68. Its made of linear low density polyethylene
and is FDA approved for potable water. I've always used glass
fermenters, and understand the problems with scratching
and sanitizing plastic.


What other concerns are there with fermenting in 
linear low density polyethylene?


Naturally stainless would be preferred, however, I don't
know where to get one of these, and probably couldn't
afford it if I did. Therefore I come to the HBD collective
for advice. TIA.

Subject: Botulism questions




I can't relax, don't worry and have a homebrew.
Espescially not have a homebrew.
Not until I get a few questions about this botulism thing answered.


I typically top off, with preboiled and chilled water, after racking to   
my secondary.
I had decided to try priming my beer with wort saved from  the boil.
After re-calculating I realized there was just not enough saved wort.
I topped off the secondary with the bottled wort, right from the   
fridge.(doh!)


The Hellesbock is still in the secondary, still slowly falling (at about   
1.024 now).


Questions:
1. Is my beer ruined?
2. How can I check for botulism?  (Drink and die is not the answer I was   
looking for.)
    I' m obviously not a chemist, or micro-biologist, but is there any   
practical botulism test?
3. If I just drink this death brew:
      a) what are the botulism symptoms to look for?
      b) how much time will I have left, assuming it's contaminated?
      c) is botulism treatable?
4. Is this suicide and therefore invalidating my insurance?
5. Is this the beer to save for un-invited guests or the in-laws?

As I said before, I have used this California Ale yeast at least a
dozen times and all I do is warm it to room temperature and pitch it
in 5 gals. of wort.  It takes off in two hours or so for me every
time.  If you wanted to give it a fair test, you should have followed
the instructions as provided.  I have done this numerous times and I
can say that the yeast behaves exactly as Chris says it should.

The buyer does not need to beware with this product, it works well and
consistently.  As I said before, Chris expanded his market because he
was flooded with demand from local brewers who love using his product.
Yes, now that it has gone out of San Diego, the lack of a "born-on
date" is a concern, but Chris is correcting that.

Subject: Heat Source; Adventures Await in China


Hey, everyone.


I've read discussions about every kind of heating source in this forum,
except what fell into my lap last summer.  While setting up a nanobrewery
in the basement pantry, my father-in-law gave me a small apartment stove
which he had removed from a rental property.  It's an old Wellbilt gas
range with the four burners spaced in a square with about 12" between them.
With my pot placed in the center, the unit will bring 8 g of wort to a
_vigorous_ boil in less than 30 min.  I'd highly recommend that anyone
looking to get off the kitchen range, and who has space for another stove
somewhere in their living quarters, keep their eyes open for old, small
apartment stoves.  A lucky strike at a garage sale, junk store, or
used-appliance outlet will get you a heat source better than propane
cookers and immersion heaters, and possibly for less money.




Any of you adventuresome brewers interested in setting up shop in China?
Reading the _Southern Draft Brew News_ this weekend I came across an
article stating that the supply of beer in China is far outstripped by
demand.  Magebreweries from the U.S. and Europe are investing heavily in
the Asian beer markets with expectations that China will soon top the US as
the biggest consumer of beer. (This as U.S. megas are faced with increased
competition domestically and stagnant growth.)  Wouldn't it be wonderful to
ensure that the war for real beer expanded to China's growing market?  It's
seems to me that the place to open a brewpub is not on mainstreet America
(there's already four there!), but in China.  Think of all the cool beer
names and labeling one could concoct!  If anyone jumps on this, all I want
as the "idea man" is airline tickets for one trip and free beer when I tour
through the world's oldest civilized country!

Subject: Botulism/Iso-alpha acid solubility
In-Reply-To: The letter of Wednesday, 5 February 1997 0:52am ET
 
HBD-
 
I had a thought, OK more of a question, regarding the current thread on
botulism toxins developing in improperly "canned" wort.
What is the toxicity of a botulism toxin grown in a quart of wort, then
diluted to 5 gallons (assuming an acidic and alcoholic medium created in the
starter stops botulism activity) and enjoyed one, maybe five bottles at a
time?  Would the toxin be diluted to non-health threatening levels?
 
Another note-
Referencing Charlie P. in TNCJOHB on pgs 276-279, he recomends highly
hopping the bottled "sterile" wort to inhibit bacterial growth.  This is
what I do.  I would presume that the added hops drive the pH down to
acceptable (for us) or unacceptable (for botulinum) levels.  At any rate,
if the starter is started quickly - ie not set out for hours at room temp,
the yeast should far out pace the bacteria, not to mention the forementioned
dilution effect.  Not to sound too cavalier, but if it were really that
dangerous, it seems we would have some anecdotal evidence by now.
 
Dan Moshers musings on iso-alpha acids solubility in water:  What of its
solubility in the increasing alcohol in a fermenting wort?  Are iso-alpha
acids more or less soluble in alcohol?

Hello,


        I'm new to the brewing scene and had a question about when to take 
the Original Gravity.  I do partial boils and then add the wort to a primary 
filled with the remaining water.  When exactly should I take the OG.  My OG 
and predicted OG have been considerable off and I was hoping to fix the 
problem.

Sarah's Summer Soda - Spiced Apple Soda 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
~3/4 lb.         Fresh Ginger, Chopped
1 tsp.                 Whole Cloves
2 2" sticks        Cinnamon, Crushed
1 Peel                Fresh Lemon Cut into small pieces
1 Peel                Fresh Orange Cut into small pieces
6 cans                Apple Juice Concentrate (cheap)
1 can                Minute Made Limeade
2 Cups                 Honey


Directions: 
 - In a large brewpot, bring ~2 1/2 gallons of water to boil, and add
ginger, peels, cloves, cinnmon, and reduce heat to med-me hi, and cover,
for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.


 - Pour the resulting mixture through a strainer to get the bits out, and
dissolve the frozen juice, and honey. (this helps to cool it down too)


 - Strain the resulting mixture through a clean cloth to get rid of any
pulpy bits that might clog the keg outlets.


 - Pour into the 5 gallon keg, and add enough cold water to get around
4-5 gallons depending on your tastes.


 - Cool, and carbonate. I set it at 30 psi for 1 1/2 days, and it was
lightly carbonated, others have recommended much higher rates of
carbonation, but I was going for a light fizzy taste.


 - Cool in a bucket of ice before serving.


Notes: This was VERY well received, and I was informed that I WAS making
this again for the summer events. J

Yes, but you *can* use a 10 gallon pot on the stove, and you

I've used flaked wheat, too, but for real authenticity, you could use
easy-to-grind soft white wheat, as they do in Belgium (although in Texas,
Celis uses the local, more easily available hard red winter).  Or you could
use soft red winter.  The lower protein level of soft wheat is better for
beer, too.  Also, soft wheat's protein is a less elastic gluten than hard
wheat.  I don't know if that would make a difference in lautering or not.
I've had good luck with both in that regard.


Wheat starch doesn't have to be pre-gelatinized as it gelatinizes at mash
temperatures (sorry, don't have reference handy).


As far as taste goes, it's hard, of course, to tell which variable is
responsible, but the only thing I changed deliberately (in other words, the
rest is just batch to batch variation) between the 1995 ginger wit and the
1996 version was the wheat.  I used 45% raw soft white in '95. and 45%
flaked hard winter red for the '96.  I felt that the version using soft
white wheat had an easier drinkability.  It was, well, softer.  I don't
know if that was the wheat, and if it was, if it was the fact that it was
soft wheat or the fact that it was white, with the lower levels of bran
tannins and phenolic that white heat has compared to red.  It also scored a
few points higher in the two competitions I entered each in.  At any rate,
the '97 version will have soft, white, winter wheat.

Subject: house flavor or household microbe?


Dear Collective:


 I am posting this for an internet deprived homebrewer..


 In the last two years, all of my friend's beers have been experiencing
the same off flavor(s), and one or two batches were seriously infected. 
he's sure his sanitary procedures are good. This started happening after
his father started making about 3 loaves of sourdough bread per week in
the kitchen. This involves leaving a quart of sourdough starter open in
the kitchen overnight about once a week or so. Could this be causing his
beer to develop a "house flavor", or a household microbe that is getting
into his beer? Some sort of wild yeast riding through the air? To make
conditions even less desirable sourkraut is also made and fermented in the
same kitchen once a year. 


 Could these conditions also contribute to stuck ferments?  
 
(TIA)

As you've noted, I believe that where the yeast is in the maturation
vessel does matter.  Consider the case of a very flocculent yeast
like Wyeast #1968 and attenuation.  If you rouse this yeast it attenuates
quite a bit more (in a normal, reasonable fermentation time) than if you
simply allow it to sink to the bottom on its own and rack off of it in
a week.  I believe, therefore, that suspended yeast (and recall that you
can have thousands of yeast cells per ml and have the beer still appear
clear -- 50,000 comes to mind, but I would check this before reuse ;^)
will play a more active role in all the biochemical reactions that take
place during fermentation and maturation (diacetyl reabsorption,
acetaldehyde reabsorption, esterification, etc.).


And:

You're right -- I am unfairly villifying filtering.  Indeed, there is
a big difference between 5 micron polish filtering and 0.5 micron tight
filtering.  In addition to removing the yeast, very tight filtration
strips a lot of the protein out of the beer, leaving it without body,
mouthfeel, or head retention.  I do still contend that filtering and
fining before aging (unless you do kraeusen) will increase the time
it takes to mature.  Honestly, I have not done side-by-side batches,
so I can't say whether it's a small increase or a large one.

White table sugar (refined cane or beet sugar) is a fine
substitute for white (clear) candi sugar.  They are both
virtually all sucrose.  Honey adds a little of its own
character, but at a rate of 1#/5gal, it's unlikely anyone
would be able to tell.  Brown sugar contains molasses
and would add a flavour that is not quite right for a
Trappist/Abbey ale.


Russell Mast posted that a friend of his made his own
amber candi sugar by heating it.  The problem is that
if you let it cool in the pot, you may have trouble
separating the sugar from the pot.  If you try to pour
it into the wort while still hot (not recommended) you
can have some serious splattering going on.  If anyone
has successfully made dark candi sugar (without accident
or injury), please post more details.  Russell?

Subject: Tun design, revisited


Last week, I asked about using PVC (although I typed PVS) as the
"strainer" in my mash tun. I found out, as mentioned by Ken Schwartz,
that PVC has a service temperature of 140 F. I tested this by
assembling my tun, and added H20 at 170 F. After two hours time, the
temp was down to ~160 and the PVC was indeed warped. Not so bad that
it could not be used, but moving in that direction.


Some might also recall that I had attempted to clean the PVC with an
alcohol (I believe) based cleaner. The smell seemed to have dissipated
after a few days, but I was still concerned. The other interesting
fact I got from my test was that there were still traces of the
cleaning compound. As I opened the lid of the cooler, I got a rather
strong whiff of not only steam, but the smell associated with the
cleaner. As I result, I mashed in the cooler, but lautered with my
zappap (sp?).


I plan to construct a new "strainer", probably out of copper. I just
wanted to provided a data point for anyone considering PVC. Note that
I did use PVC and not CPVC. Thanks to Ken Schwartz, Gregory Guy, and
James Blue for their direct responses.


Couple of other questiions -


1) When I added my grain to the strike water, my temp ended up at
   ~145. I added an extra 1/2 gallon of water at 170 about ten minutes
   later to get the temp to 151, where it stayed for the next hour. I
   would appreciate any comments as to effects this might have on the
   finished product.


   Particulars: Mashed 9 lbs of grain using 2.5 gallons of H20 at
   170F.


2) I am a bit unclear as to making the determination of when to stop
   recirculating the sparged H20 at the beginning of the lauter
   process. I have read that one need to wait and get a "clear"
   runoff. I found very little difference in the clarity of the
   run-off from the beginning of the sparge and the end.


Thanks for the help --

My son bought me a birthday gift that consisted of 6.5 lbs of Belgian

supplied the recipe assured him that this would make a great "Blanche". 
I'm somewhat skeptical as I don't think that an all wheat malt has
enough potential enzymes and that some barley (perhaps 20% - 30%) should
be substituted.  The hops recommended was 1/2 oz. (2.6 AAU) Hallertau
for bittering and 1/2 oz for aroma.


Also, no specific yeast was recommended.  I brew with liquid yeasts

Anyone have any sources where the technique is thoroughly described? All I'm

Subject: Re: Botulism




There seems to be some more common questions regarding botulism.


First, the botulism toxin is odorless and tasteless so examining your
wort will do you no good (I told you this is nasty stuff).  


Second, the presence of swollen tops does not imply a botulism
problem.  If you have a swollen lid, or a bad smell, then some
bacteria has gotten into the preserve and caused a spoilage.  It's
very similar to a spoiled batch of beer.  This is the main reason I
would recommend using mason jars with a fresh lid.


Please, don't trust my word.  Take a couple hours and go to your local
library and check out a couple of books.  Convince yourself what you
need to do to safely store wort for months at a time.

Subject: Wyeast temp. ranges


Good morning all,


Thanks to  Jim Bentson  for posting the temperature ranges for Wyeast. 
Many of the Wyeast yeast will perform extremely well outside of the
listed range which I consider a  bit conservative .


I have had good luck with 1056 at 55F where the range starts at 60F. 
As strongly as the 1056 went at 55F perhaps it could even go lower. 
The high temp. for this yeast is 72F per the list and I think that you may
even get away with a few degrees higher.  My experience with this
yeast is that is quite stable and clean over a wide range of temperatures.


1214 provided excellent results while fermenting out a trippel at 80F. 
Contrary to public belief the esters formed at 80F where less then when
the same recipe and the same quantity of yeast were used at 65F.


Many of the lager yeasts will ferment very well at temperatures 5 or
more degrees below the low temp. of their range.  I have had good
results with 2124, 2206, 2308, 2278 and 2035 fermenting these yeast at
42F.  These were not single one time events, but were repeated at least
5 or 6 times.


Frequently the key to a successful fermentation is that the temperature
be maintained at a constant.  Yeast doesn't seem to take well to wide
swings in temperature.

     Brad asks if you can obtain wheat beer yeast (specifically 3068) from 
     bottled beer.
     
     Only if its homebrew.
     
     There is only one commercial Bavarian wheat beer available in the USA 
     that has its original fermentation yeast in the bottle.  That beer is 
     Schneider Weisse (yes, they do call it "Weisse").  This yeast, as you 
     can tell from tasting the beer, is NOT 3068.  It is in fact 4 (at 
     least) strains of yeast.  I've tried fermenting with all 4 strains 
     combined in the primary, with OK results, but not great.
     
     I don't know what Bavarian brewers actually use 3068.  Even 
     Weihenstephen's HefeWeizen doesn't taste like any of the beer I've 
     made with 3068.
     
     3068 makes a VERY bold beer.  Nothing subtle about the bananas and 
     phenolics.  I find the bananas can be subdued (somewhat) by high 
     pitching rates and a fermentation temp in the low 60's F (15.5-17.8C).
     ------------------------
     I have a question about hop oil extracts, used to add aroma to 
     fermented beer.
     
     Has anyone out there used them?  Did you like the results?  Did it 
     also affect hop flavor or bitterness?  Was the recommended 1/2 ounce 
     per 5 gallons enough?
     
     Have fun!

In HBD #2337 and #2342 Kit Anderson & Jim Busch comment on my Belgian Wit
Recipe-


5# Belgium 2-Row
4# Malted Wheat
 .5# Flaked Oats


KA < I'm sure this is a good beer but it will be truer to 
      < style substituting flaked wheat for the malted wheat.


JB  < Why stop there?  Use raw wheat for real authenticity.


Perhaps someone can explain the proper usage of raw, flaked, malted, Cream
of, or torrefied wheat grains. (I suppose this would also apply to oats).  I
chose malted wheat because the main grain in my bill is Belgian Pale 2-row
with a low diastatic power (60). Does flaked wheat have enough enzymes for
conversion? Do European brewers generally prefer flaked or raw wheat? 
- ----------------
Someone had asked about the proper amounts of orange & corriander in a Wit. I
have found that 1/2 oz. dried Belgian bitter orange peel & 2 tsp. corriander
seed (lightly crushed) provide just a hint of corriander & orange, more in
the aroma & finish than the flavor. Add half of each the last 10 min. of boil
& half in secondary (1 wk.).

Subject: More botulism


     Hi again,
     
     I'm actually still not convinced that botulism poses a threat to 
     canned wort, but I am concerned.  According to Bergey's, some strains 
     of Clostridium botulinum produce gasses (hydrogen, ammonia, hydrogen 
     sulfide).  This would be quite noticeable upon opening the supposedly 
     sterile wort.  Heck, the explosion from flaming the mouth of the 
     bottle would tip you off! ;)
     
     Does C. botulinum behave this way in food, or can its presence be 
     undetectable?
     
     Why is it that spontaneously fermented worts are not endangered by 
     Clostridium?  Is Clostridium strictly anaerobic (won't function at all 
     in presence of O2), or are conditions in the wort just not conducive 
     to its growth (pH, hop components)?  According to Scientific American, 
     bacteria start the fermentation process in Lambics.  It takes several 
     days before the yeasts get going and produce an environment not 
     conducive to most bacteria, yet nobody worries about botulism toxin in 
     Boon Gueuze.
     
     Interestingly, *basic* conditions (pH > 8.5) also inhibit growth.  An 
     atmosphere of 100% CO2 delays toxin production, and pressurized CO2 is 
     lethal to all strains.
     
     Have Fun!

Jeff, I wouldn't correct you if you weren't so believable....but here are
the correct and indisputable identifications.


NCYC1187 =YL A10=YCKC A51
Ringwood =YL A09=YCKC A15


Both seem to have rather high O2 needs and benefit from extended
pre-fermentation aeration and dropping.  In addition, since both are very
flocculant, resuspension on racking helps to finish the last few points of
fermenation.  These are very different yeasts mechanically.  1187 barely
top crops and Ringwood almost climbs out of the beer.

I'll go out on a limb and say that the sulfide aroma will vanish with time.
The beer is still rather young.  In most cases it is scrubbed out during
the fermentation.  You may want to try a different extract, but a clear
answer would require knowing your pitch rates and areation techniques.

Subject: Skunked Miller/Pathogens in beer/Comment overheard


Skunked Miller High Life-
        A couple years ago, our local club had guest speakers from Miller
brewing company speak at a meeting.  The claim was made that they can use
clear bottles because they use hops with low alpha acids, but have high
beta acid levels and that the beta acids do not skunk.


Pathogens in Beer and Wort-
        I've never felt comfortable with Papazian's claim that "no known
pathogen can survive in beer".  I also note that CP generally provide no
references other than his own books and Zymurgy, so I take most of his
"facts" with a ton of salt.  Granted, the acidity of beer makes this
statement probable, but for wort I'm a believer in pressure cooking.  I
vaguely recall from college Biology that a fatal dose of toxin is on the
order of 3 micrograms, but who knows if that number is accurate.


Interesting Comment From Non-Beer Person-
        My department hires a student to work part time in our office.  She
was telling us about the beer she had at a local brewpub that has been
opened in the campus area.  The quote:  "...this one beer was interesting -
I didn't know you could make a beer taste like butterscotch..."  I don't
want to mention names, but the name of the brewery that runs this place
rhymes with "Moldenberg"
