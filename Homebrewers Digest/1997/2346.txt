Subject: Heineken in Brown/Beer Yeast Bread


Brown Heineken
On a recent trip to Amsterdam, my local hosts ordered a round of 
Heinekens in the restaurant. When they arrived in green bottles, I 
remarked that I was expecting brown. Their reply? "Oh, that's the 
Export."  Go figure. The local grocery stores sold large returnable 
green Heineken bottles that appeared to be about 24 oz. Those bottles 
were delvered to the stores in plastic milk crates. Efficient packaging 
all-around.  For anyone going to Amsterdam, get to La Belgique, on an 
alley behind the Nieuwkerk (New Church). This bar has 8 Belgian beers 
on tap and another 50 in bottles. (No affiliation. Just a staggering 
customer.)


Beer Yeast Bread
Some literature (BT) has suggested that bread yeast is selected for CO2 
production and that brewing strains are less than ideal.  I suspect 
that any of the massive top cropping ale strains would work best. My 
single data point with Ringwood yeast supports that idea. I maintain a 
sponge/starter from Ringwood that I replenish/feed in the following 
proportions.


1 part water
1 part starter
1 1/2  parts flour.


I dissolve 1 tsp of DME in the water, which provides the yeast with the 
maltose it knows and loves. Let it sit at room temp for at least 12 
hours after feeding. 
For the bread, I use about 275 grams of starter, 750 grams of flour, 
and 2 1/4 cups of water, and 1 tablespoon of salt. Good stuff.

Subject: Stovetop Brewing Tips


Hi All,


Having just bought a new house (with all new appliances =:)
my wife was very concerned about not trashing our expensive
cooktop. I'd like to pass on a few tips I have discovered
over the last several years of stovetop brewing that will
definitely save you time, probably save your stove, and maybe
even save your marriage.


1) Start with an immaculate stove. Clean it BEFORE you brew. Any
food or grease splatters will be very difficult to remove after
having been cooked on during a 90 minute boil.


2) Cover as much of the stove with aluminum foil as possible (but not the
burners, duh...). Any boilovers or drips from the stirring spoon
become a non-issue since you just toss the foil when you are done.
Make sure the stove is clean underneath (see #1) because splatters
will still cook on underneath the foil due to the extreme heat.


3) Especially if your pot is small (I've got a polarware 10 gallon SS 
pot - Nyah, Nyah) use some kind of "boiling stone" to reduce boilovers. I use
a 3" diameter SS disk (from the expresso machine) but I've heard of
others using pennies or other copper items. The idea is to make the 
production of bubbles more uniform and reduce the really large
bubbles that splash wort all over the place.


These three things (especially #1 and #2) have shaved probably 30-40
minutes of arm-breaking cleanup time for me each brew session. 


I enjoy stovetop brewing because it allows me to still be part of the family 
while I'm brewing. I can bring the 7 gallons of sweet wort to a boil
in around 20 minutes with my pot straddling two burners (12K & 10K BTU).


Hope these hints help you out in your quest for better bear with less cleanup!

From: ajdel`at`mindspring.com (A. J. deLange)
Subject: Chalk


Steve Lefebvre asked about how to get calcium carbonate to dissolve in
water. The answer is acid:  CaCO3(s) + 2H+ --> 2HCO3-(aq) + Ca++. This can
be any acid but hydrochloric, sulfuric phosphoric and lactic seem to be the
most popular among brewers. I have, in the past, advocated the use of
carbonic acid (bubbling CO2 through the water until it clears) because you
can then readjust the pH to a desired value simply by aerating (letting
excess CO2 escape).


The question remains as to why you want to dissolve chalk in your brew
water. The usual reason is to hold mash pH up when using strongly acidic
(high color) malts. In these cases using acid to dissolve the chalk into
the liquor partially defeats the purpose of using chalk in the first place
i.e. you are adding acid in order to dissolve something you want to use to
absorb acid. By partially I mean that 2 equivalents of chalk can "absorb" 4
equivalents of acid. The reaction above shows 2 equivalents of chalk
absorbing 2 equivalents of acid. When put into the mash tun 2HCO3- + 2H+
- --> 2CO2 + 2H2O absorbs another 2 (the exact numbers depend on pH). Thus
you give up half the neutralizing capacity of chalk if you dissolve it with
acid first. Because of this many people put the chalk into the mash,
monitoring the pH, rather than into the water. On the other hand when using
acid to dissolve the chalk you wind up with twice as much calcium in the
water and if increasing calcium is your goal, using acid is fine.


One final caveat. If a mineral or organic acid is being used you must be
cognizant that the anion of that acid will also be present in the beer. For
example, if sufuric acid is used, the sulfate content of the water will go
up and the effects of increased sulfate on hops will be noted. This may, of
course, be exactly what you want but in some circumstances it may not. This
is the one big advantage to using CO2 as the acid (it is a bit of a PITA).
It does not increase any anion other than the carbonate species which you
have already accepted that you will tolerate when you made the decision to
use chalk.

Hello George  (nice name),


I have used the Hop Tech hop oils and late hop essences.
These were the Premium British Blend, Pure East Kent Goldings,
Late Hop Essence Floral, and Late Hop Essence Spicy.  I was not
at all happy with the results in all cases.  I used then singly and 
in combination with each other and with hop pellets.  I do not
think that they provided a good hop character the beers (which BTW were
all pale ales).  Just my experience. I am interested in hearing other
opinions as well.

Greetings,


I have noticed that a 1.040 SG is referenced regarding starters. What
is the importance of this? Will a higher gravity shock the liquid yeast?
I normally add an overflowing cup of LME (syrup) in a half gallon of
boiling water and haven't bothered to check the SG. My starters seem
OK and the final beer is fine. Would someone please expand on this?
Is the starter SG related to the style of beer it is for?

The more recent issues of Brewing Techniques and Zymurgy
have ads for a company that makes baby unitanks.  Stainless,
in sizes of 10 to 20 gallons, they're designed to fit in a standard
refridgerator.  They look cool, but are probably out of most

re: making bread.


There was a pretty good article in the Nov/Dec 96 Brewing
Techniques about making bread, which touched on using spent

Good question.  I thought that bread yeast can generally "ferment" flour, 
so you don't generally need to add sugar to bread (although you may 
want to).  I assume that ale yeast generally cannot ferment flour (starch).  


I don't see what the benefit of using beer yeast for baking would be; bread
yeast is the right tool for the job.

When mixing makeup water and a high gravity wort, it is very difficult
to get an accurate SG reading due to the density differences and resulting
stratification. After trying other people's equations with limited success,
I put together a wort dilution table from published numbers and several
of my own experiments. I have found this lookup table to be accurate
enough that all I have to do is take a gravity reading from my cooled
wort (after transferring to my carboy so I know my starting volume) and
then based on my desired starting gravity, the table tells me exactly
how much water to add. The table is at our club website (the url is in my 
 .sig below) under the Brewing Tips section. It is in html format which
you can print directly or, if you prefer, a Quattro Pro or Excel format
version is also available for download. If you don't have web access,
let me know, and I will try to email you a copy.

In HBD #2343,  Brad Anesi wrote
that he recently bought an 8 gallon
stainless steel pot with a "solid
aluminum sandwiched bottom" for
$135.  He also states that
"Boil-over problems have
effectively been eliminated due to
the solid bottom and increased
head-space".


>From my experience in brewing 5

 I have a 10 gallon stainless steel
Polar Ware pot which I picked up
for $129 from Williams Brewing that
seems to be about the right size. 
It does not have a "solid aluminum
sandwiched bottom", but I get a
very even heat across the bottom of
my heavy duty pot.  I'm not sure
that aluminum clad bottoms really
buy you that much if the pot is
made of a heavy gauge stainless
steel.


As far as boil-overs, I always get
a large head of foam early in the
boil (when the hot-break forms?).  
I can barely keep this foam in my
10 gallon pot, so I would hate to
have to keep to in an 8 gallon pot.


The bottom line is, I think
anything less than a 10 gallon pot
is too small for 5 gallon batches.

Well, in my 1/2 gallon, well-aerated, 1.040 OG starter at room temp, I
didn't see any appreciable activity until 12 hours after pitching.  I can't
imagine that this sample would have kicked in _quicker_ in the full five
gallons. And I was told this was a fresh vial, from that week's production.
It was shipped 2nd day air, and I picked it up the same day it arrived.
But other people I've talked to who've used this yeast say my experience
isn't atypical.


Part of the problem in this discussion is that Dion and I have different
defintions of "start of activity".  We've discussed this off-line and I
have a better understanding of what he meanns, but I think we're still
defining things differently.  Lack of a concrete defintion can lead to
confusion. I think we're still a few hours apart in our definitions.


His setup is different than mine.  He aerates with pure O2 for _much_
longer than I do (two hours at low pressure for him vs a couple of high
pressure 30-60 second blasts for me.  We use similar, if not, same
airstones, tho).

Well, it depends on your expectations. Mine are different and perhaps more
demanding than other folk. The new "born-on dating"  is welcomed and may
have something to do with the fact that I brought it up as a concern to a
local supplier when I first saw the product.  He relayed my concern to
White Labs. The literature the company supplies to the retailers says that
in 4 week old products, lag times may increase to as much as 20-24 hours.
Kinda tosses the "pitch right from the vial" instructions right out the
window, at least for me.  Not all of us live in the same city as the lab,
and get it within a few days of when it was packaged. And it may not "fly
off the shelf" everywhere. Viability can only go down over time, and
there's no easy way for the retail customer to tell how fast.


If y'all want to use White Labs, go ahead. Nobody's telling you not to.
But, as with any of the liquid yeasts on the market, you _really_ should
make a starter, IMHO.


Malt, water, hops and yeast.  We used to brew with generic hopped malt
extract and dry yeast of unknown origin. Specialty grains? what were those?
If we could get reasonably fresh hops we didn't know what the alpha acid
rating was.  We used whatever water came out of the tap.   We brew better
beer now because we've gotten access to information and become better
educated. We know more now about the first three than we do about the
fourth ingredient.  Don't take your yeast for granted.

The fact that the product works well and consistently is not the issue
for me.  The fact that White Labs has a brochure that states the product
contains at least 250 billion cells is FALSE ADVERTIZING.  I'm willing
to give them the benefit of the doubt for now.  But at this time further
testing is on going and a statistically significant sample # will be
analyzed.  White labs has the option to either change the brochure or
get raked through the mud here.

Top of the morning to ye all,


Add the crushed  malt to the water or add the water to the crushed 
malt that is the question.  


I now do the latter adding the water to the crushed malt and have 
found that far more controllable.  I do this with all method of 
mashing, infusion, step mash, mixed mash and decoction.  and have had 
good results this way.  




When I do an infusion mash I heat the water to around 180F and dough 
it into the mash slowly until I have about reached my strike point 
then all I have to do is to slow down the infusion of water so not to 
overshoot the temp. I want.


I also use a simple mash tun, actually a five gallon enamel pot, so if 
I miss it altogether all I have to do is put it on the fire and heat 
it up to where it should be.


All grain brewing is about as difficult as making biscuits from 
scratch.

in the wort without this, however, when you use the black malts which lower the

Greased aluminum foil will do in a pinch.  But don't set the foil

You could try doing without the grease, but then separating it from

drops of water and this is what I use normally.  If you are below 1/2% or so in
a normal test, adding 10 drops of beer will make the test more sensitive, but
you have to divide the readings by two.

you had better watch or the stuff will burn.  When the
sugar become a nice amber color pour the sugar into a

After it has cooled break it up and you now have "candi"

I have added the sugar while it was hot to the wort

I just wanted to point out that if you are trying to settle-out carbonates,
to maximize the amount you remove, you should force-chill your boiled
water and decant off the sediment.  As the water cools & sits around, it
will pick up CO2 from the air which will lower the pH and subsequently
some of the calcium carbonate will redissolve in the water.  The reason
that the CaCO3 drops out of solution in the first place is because you
are boiling off the dissolved CO2.

I believe that astringency is perhaps the wrong discritor to use for
the flavour imparted by the Brown Malt.  Sharpness, I would say, but
not astringency.  In fact, you are *less* likely to get astringency
from Brown Malt than pale malts because polyphenols are the usual source
of astringency and darker malts lower pH which, in turn, decreases
polyphenol extraction.

Unless your adjuncts are high in protein, they shouldn't increase your
need for a protein rest.  For example, corn grits, rice, corn starch,
potato starch... all of these are low in protein and are referred to
as "protein dilutants" -- they are used by the Megabrewers to dilute the
excess protein they get from using 6-row base malts.  Wheat is high in
protein and raw and flaked wheat are more likely to *require* a protein
rest than malted wheat, in which some of the protein has already been
broken down by the malting process.

Mark writes, regarding leaving your "rest mash" in the protein rest
temperature range for a longer than desirable time when decoction mashing:

I'm afraid not... the protein is where the mash is... some in the rest
mash and some in the decoction.  There are plenty of proteins in the
rest mash and a long rest in the proteolytic range will indeed break
them down.  The reason that decoction mashes made great beer was because
the malt they used was quite undermodified.  This means that some
proteolytic action was not only acceptable, but it was necessary!


At the first Spirit of Belgium conference (1994?) Eric Toft (sp?) from
a brewery somewhere between Munich and Salzburg (formerly brewing in
Belgium, wbich is why he was speaking at the SoB...) said that many
German breweries were frustrated by the German maltsters "overmodifying"
the malts and therefore many were cutting back from traditional
triple-decoction mashes, to double- or even single-decoction mashes
because the beer was coming out without mouthfeel.

You don't really need that much yeast to get carbonation.  I haven't done
what you suggest, but my *guess* would be that if you used 10% unfiltered
beer, the beer would still carbonate within a month.  However, if you want
to bottle condition your beer as Sierra Nevada does, what you want to do
is filter your beer, force-carbonate it to about 90% of the final level
you want, then add fresh yeast and only add 10% of the normal amount of
priming sugar.  That's what SN does.

Subject: Subject: Extract/partial Belgain Abbey


Brander Roullett asked about Belgain Abbey type ales and Belgain Candi
sugar.


I'm not sure if candi sugar is essential, however some type of sugar
seems important.  I have used honey as a substitute.  Brown sugar might
work as well.
 
Candi sugar is nothing more than highly refined cane sugar that has been 
cyrstalized on a string, the light version is the same as good ol' C & H. The 
dark candi sgar has been carmelised, (see the archives for ways to do it 
yourself)
 The reason for sugar in Belgian ales is to add fermentables, and to lighten 
body. By fermenting out completely a couple of pounds of sugar in a Tripple
will boost alcohol while leaving a lighter body than we expect from other 
high-gravity brews. (Barley-wine, Strong Scotch Ale etc.) Honey can contain as 
much as 25 % unfermentable material, and many types will contribute color as 
well. Brown sugar is regular white sugar with mollassas added. I don't think 
it is a traditional Belgian adjunct.

>From what I understand, certain undesirable conditions during

I was making really, really strong beer, when my calculations showed 
alcohol content less than Bud.  Now, if this is the case, my 
theoretical question is this:  Can these fusel alcohols be reduced in 
the same (or similar) manner as Jack S. (and others) have suggested 
for making non-alcoholic beers?  This process reheats beer after it 
has fermented to a point high enough to evaporate alcohol, but leave 
*most* everything else (most people who have tried this report that 
hop character is also lost in the process).  I don't know the boiling 
point of fusel alcohols, but if it is within the range of ethanol, 
wouldn't the fusels be eliminated as well?  I'm sure other by-products 
are involved, but if you could eliminate 75 - 80% of the problem, this 
may be a way to salvage a batch.  Also, is there any other off-flavor 
by-products that could possibly be reduced or minimized by this 
technique?  I have always assumed that off-flavors from bacterial 
infections or poor fermentation conditions were a permanent defect.  
Again, this is only a theoretical question; I'm not even sure I would 
go to the trouble to do this.  I'm also not suggesting this as an 
alternative to controlling fermentation conditions -- eliminating the 
cause of a problem is always easier than eliminating the problem 
itself.  However, if it is possible to salvage a NA beer rather than 
dumping 5 gallons down the drain, I may be tempted to try it.

You're right A.J., that phosphates are involved in modulating the
activity is clear, but the details of this are not (circa 1996).
HMGCoAreductase synthesis is the other part of the control as you
state.
- --


Back to the big picture so we don't lose everyone. Acyl-CoA in yeast
is involved in the primary chemical mechanism of ester production in
beer.  If your yeast are filled with Acyl-CoA, some of your alcohols
will be converted to esters.


Acyl-CoA is used in many of the biochemical pathways in yeast (and
most other organisms).  Two important syntheses requiring Acyl-CoA are
the creation of sterols and the creation of lipids.  Both sterols and
lipids are required to build yeast cell walls.  No sterols or lipids
means no new cell walls which means thinner cell walls and less/no
yeast growth.


To get from Acyl-CoA to sterols requires oxygen.  To get from AcylCoA
(or a variant - MalonylCoA) to at least some lipids (unsaturated fatty
acids) also requires oxygen.  This seems to cover the major
requirements for oxygen in yeast.  Aside from lipid and sterol
synthesis yeast seem to live happily anaerobically.


If we cut off the oxygen supply from yeast the ability of the yeast to
synthesize sterols and oleic acids is impared, so the AcylCoA builds
up in the yeast cells and is available to increase ester production.
This is why esters are a potential problem in hard to oxygenate high
gravity brews - like Rob Moline's recent note on barleywines.  This is
also why open fermentation, as pointed out by David Burley, can lead
to low ester levels.        


A.J.deLange continues ...
>[....] I would, thus, expect more esters in a beer
>where sterols had been supplied. There has been lengthy debate on whether
>cold trub should be removed or not with, if I recall correctly, the general

This depends. *IF* the feedback control mechanism for the lipid or
sterol synthesis reduces the amount of AcylCoA or its precursors - or
alternatively if the control occurs at or after the AcylCoA is
available.  As an anology, you can stop the flow of water down your
drain by either plugging the drain or turning by off the faucet.  Both
stop water from draining away, but the former method causes a
'pooling' of water, and eventually side effects.


I have several sources M&B Science, 'Biology of Microorganisms' Brock
1974, and several of the references in Andy Walsh's ester paper that
note that ergosterol and various unsaturated fatty acids (oleic,
linoleic and linolenic) added to wort separately improve yeast growth
AND reduce ester production !!!  (BTW - cold trub does contain
linoleic and linolenic acids).


This suggests that supplying yeast with the fatty acid and sterol
products they would normally synthesize prevents pooling of AcylCoA
and also permits anaerobic yeast growth.  Like turning off the faucet
instead of plugging the drain.


Practical implications ---


If this is correct then it might advantageous to eliminate all wort
aeration and oxygenation and instead add ergosterol and oleic acid as
a yeast nutrient/growth factor.  Decreasing the amount of additives
would increase the amount of esters formed, when desired.  The
non-aerated wort wouldn't suffer negative effects of oxygen uptake,
yet the yeast could grow normally and the esters can be reduced.  This
might be a big improvement for high gravity brewing.


Experiments are obviously needed here.

Tony,
        
        I always ferment ales at around 60 deg., with every strain. Doing 
so will not harm the beer at all, in my own opinion. In fact, you will 
probably have a "cleaner" beer, because at lower fermentation temperatures,
less off flavors, such as fruity, butterscotchlike(diacetyl), cidery, 
grassy(acetaldehyde), or even the aroma of rotten eggs, occur. Fermenting 
at lower temperatures will also lower the risk of bacterial contamination 
and propagation, which prefer warmer temperatures. But keep in mind, if the 
environment is too cold, activity will be much lower, or stop completely. 
Also, upon completion of fermentation, yeast will settle out better, leaving 
you with clearer beer. So around 60 deg won't hurt your beer, but going down 
to 50 deg and lower won't help, unless your lagering. 
In my opinion, keep it around 60 deg.


Good luck with your brewing,

All,


   I came across a patent application in a food sciences book that
describes adding 0.5 ppm to 5 ppm of zinc to wort (added as zinc
sulphate) to decrease hops skunking.  The claim is that the zinc
fortified wort would cause the yeast to expel a large amount of H2S
(rotten egg odor) which is scrubbed by the CO2 escaping.  This reduces
the amount of sulphur in the finished beer and the skunking reportedly
needs sulphur for one of the intermediate steps.

worth a try for that summer quaffing beer.
