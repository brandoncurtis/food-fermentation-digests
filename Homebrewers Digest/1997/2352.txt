Subject: Schnapps/Torani syrups for Priming


Dave Burly, Thanks for the reply. I have decided to use the Torani Kiwi syrup
(Pure Cane Sugar) . I pounded the books on Sunday and came up with the
following, Does it sound correct to Anyone? If Y'all could be so kind to let
me know I'd really appreciate it. 


Givens:
Degrees Plato, Brix, Balling all "Roughly" equal the percentage of sugar in a
given solution.
>From Papazians 2nd book I got the ratio of:
1 Tbls= .5 oz and 1 oz = 28.35 grams
130 ml Malt sugar = 70 ml Cane sugar (I'm planning to Keg.)
Therefor 5 Tbls malt should weight 70.625 g
I diluted the 50 ml syrup with 50 ml water and took the SG. =1.111 ! (Temp
Adjusted)  So im figuring on about 54 Degrees Plato for the syrup. So from
all of this I pull the following formula out my *^&*(%^%.


70.625g x (70ml/130ml) x (100g syrup/54g cane sugar)=70.423 g of syrup needed
to prime a 5 gal batch of beer that is to be Kegged.  So how did I do?


The Above mentioned beer was mashed and pitched last Sunday OG of 1.043 and
was racked on Saturday at a FG of 1.008! (First time I've got it below
1.010!) At that time I re hydrated some Inglass (Which I've never used
before-I usually remember to add the Irish moss while boiling :<{ ) in a cup
of water and added that to the still cloudy secondary. After further diluting
the original amount of syrup I quickly concluded that 70.4 g of syrup wasnt
going to give me much of a Kiwi flavor. So I glugged in 200 ml of syrup into
the secondary on Sunday hoping it would ferment the sugar and leave the
flavor. 
Question: what effect is the new sugar going to have on the 1 day old
Iningslass which had already started to amass white globby things floating in
the secondary. Is that normal behavior for iningslass?? The curious "green"
brewer at the Poison Frog Home Brewery would like to know...

Subject: Assistant Brewer Questions...


Hi all-


I was wondering if anybody could help me.


I've been recently thinking about a career change, and moving
over into the world of professional brewing, I assume that I
would need to start out as an assistant brewer (as everyone
has to put in their time), so if someone would be kind enough,
who is in the business, to answer a few questions, I would
really appreciate it.  The questions are below;






1) I'm sure that I'm not going to get rich brewing beer, but
what sort of salary/pay are we talking about here (for an 
assistant brewer).


2) What sort of professional training is necessary/recommended
to start a career as a brewer? Or is it just as easy to go in
on an apprenticeship type of role.


3) How easy is it to find a job in this field, and where would
on look? I know that microbreweries and brewpubs are popping up
left and right, but do they readily need brewers, or are the
brewers the ones starting the business.


Private email is fine...I'll summarize and post the results if
there is enough interest.


Thanks,
 - Chris

Subject: Skunking, light and temperature...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


As much as I hate to get between Dave and Al, I have an anectdote to 
share regarding this subject. 


One day during the summer of '94, Rich Byrnes came over in order to brew 
a recipe - an Orval clone for which Al refused to share the recipe a 
couple of years back. Anyway, Rich brought a six of Spam Adams Scoth Ale 
which had but recently burst upon the scene! During the mash, we popped 
inside for some glasses and poured ourselves each a glass. First sip was 
pretty good! I set mine down on the porch rail in direct sunlight whilst 
drawing a sample from the mash to check its pH. About 20 seconds later, I 
went for another sip. Skunk city. And I have a witness. Rich was 
incredulous, so he had to smell it for itself. A few moments in the 
shade, and the skukiness seemed to reduce, but this was likely from the 
aroma being scrubbed out by the CO2 evolving whilst little more was 
produced rather than by some mechanism having to do with cooling it down.


Now, in defense of Al's assertion or suggestion that chilling the beer to 
50'F and aging it will reverse the skunkiness - I have heard similar, 
though without a temperature quotation. I believe it was in one of 
Miller's books, but cannot be sure...


See ya!

I do.  I for one have spent many hours puzzling over and trying to get
verification on various points that are in doubt.  Having easy access
not only to outright errors, but to controvertable points and expanded
information on poorly stated points would save a lot of time and
trouble *AND* improve the state of HB knowledge.  Some of the books
contain unclear or incorrect information on water treatment,
temperature dependences of reactions, carbon bonding structure of some
of the molecular diagram.  If you plan on USING this information
instead of just absorbing it for background knowledge then it is
critically important for improving HB quality.

Why can't we praise these authors' efforts AND point out corrections
and doubts ?  This is the same treatment any HBD posting gets - isn't
it ?  Several HBD posters are HB article and book authors.  Why should
such books get any less scrutiny or critical review than an HBD
posting ?  There isn't much point in having a brain after all, if you
aren't going to question things.

Fix, Noonan, and Miller are great brewers and George is a very
highly-respected brewing consultant.  His book does, however, have a
few errors in it.  Just because they are great brewers doesn't mean
that their books are going to be error-free nor does it mean that
someone who has done quite a bit of reading of professional brewing
texts and technical journals can't disagree with them.  The fact is,
that Noonan's and Miller's and Papazian's books are littered with
errors that *must* *not* be ignored.  Not until the accessability of
the World Wide Web has identifying these errors become practical.
My intent is to *correct* the errors *with* references.  This most
certainly *will* improve homebrewing, far more than your childish,
narrow-minded, public flaming does.

I would advise against that.  The grease/butter/PAM/whatever, will
kill your head retention.  I was also skeptical of wax paper too, so
I did an experiment this weekend:  I took a beer-clean glass and
rubbed wax paper on *one* side of the inside.  Then I went over to
the corny and poured myself a pint.  The head on the non-waxed side
was tight and stiff like whipped cream whereas on the waxed side
the bubbles were big and the head was collapsing. When I finished
filling the glass, the head on the glass was crecent-shaped, with
the open end pointing to the waxed area.


So, I started thinking of how to cool molten sugar in a way that
would not require qrease and came up with one suggestion: a beer-
clean disposable aluminum pie pan.  My favorite cleaner for getting
things beer-clean is washing soda (sodium carbonate) -- no soaking,
just a little washing soda, hot water, and a paper towel (all our
kitchen sponges invariably have diswashing soap (the sudsy stuff)
on them).  I don't think foil is a good idea because it will
probably rip when you try to remove the sugar from the foil and
then you have to fight to remove the little scraps of foil off
the rock candy.  Speaking of which, you can probably use string, no?

I did initially write 0.5 micron filtering would strib the beer of mouthfeel
(not flavour -- I never would write that), but I changed it to "tight
filtering" because I wasn't sure offhand if 0.5 microns was small enough.
Earlier in my post I did compare 5 micron to 0.5 micron filtering (saying
there's a big difference), so I can see where you might think that I was
equating 0.5 micron filtering to "tight" filtering.  I'm not sure if 0.5
micron is tight enough.


I would like to point out several other factors that are important:


1. pressure -- if you use a high pressure, you will force more particles
through the filter than if you used a lower pressure,


2. capacity -- if you are using a filter close to it's capacity, you
will filter out more than if you use only a fraction of the filter's
capacity -- the filtered-out material sticks to the filter material
and becomes part of the filtration... i.e. the second 7 bbl will not
only have to pass through the filter media, but also through the mass
of collected yeast and protein from the first 7 bbl.


3. efficiency -- various filters are rated to various efficiencies...
a low efficiency filter will let through a lot of stuff that is smaller
than the rated pore size.


Just a few things to ponder.  Note that while I have quite a bit of
experience in other areas of brewing, but I must admit that my knowledge
about filtering is 95% from books and discussions with industry experts.
I have remedying this deficiency on my list of things to do: I've
purchased several different filters and plan to do a lot of experimentation
in the near future.

Subject: Oxygenation


I bought an oxygenation kit by Gulfstream Brewing from a local homebrew
shop and tried it this weekend.  The directions called for a 15 second burst
of oxygen in 5 gallons of wort followed by another after 20 minutes.  The
flow rate was to be at just the point that bubbles emanated from the SS stone.
If air is 20 percent O2 why would not 75 seconds from an aquarium pump be
equivalent to this 15 seconds of O2?  I seem to recall that considerably
more time than that was needed with an aquarium pump.  The SS aeration
stone with the kit appears to be considerably finer than I have used with
an aquarium pump so that could make a difference.  Also, I have not tried
using the SS stone with my aquarium pump.  Perhaps it would not even have the
pressure necessary to bubble through the SS stone.  However, given the same
stone, wouldn't 75 seconds of air be equivalent to 15 seconds of O2?


By the way, I decanted the liquid from a 48 oz. starter, added about 2 qts.
of chilled new wort, and oxygenated.  After I collected the rest of the chilled
wort to a carboy through an aeration tube, I added the starter and oxygenated
the 5 gallons as per instructions (2 15 second shots separated by 20 minutes).
Twelve hours later I saw no activity and oxygenated again.  This oxygenation
may have been for less than 15 seconds as I could not see any bubbles due to
the dark stout wort and opened the valve a bit too much, blowing the stone off
into my wort.  Activity became apparent 4 or 5 hours later and there was a
thick head about 20 hours after pitching.  This was a little longer lag than
I expected.  Was I expecting too much?

It need not be ultraviolet light to turn the isohumulone into prenyl
mercaptan.  I thought said you read the article in Zymurgy... I'm certain
that non-radiative energy transfer was at least mentioned in there, no?
Pierre Jelenc explained it to me years ago: light of green to blue passes
through the glass (note: *green* glass bottles) and its energy is transfered
to the isohumulone via the process of non-radiative energy transfer.  It
is believed that riboflavin is the primary sensitizer (the absorber of the
light) in beer.  I'm curious as to where you read that the hop variety
is a factor.  I have noticed no difference in my experience, so I'm
wondering where you got that info.  Since brown glass blocks light better
in the green-to-blue range than green or clear glass, it does a better
job of protecting the beer, but not a *perfect* job of protecting the
beer.

David, are you blind to the meaning of the word *seems*?  Al wasn't saying
that it is proven, it is written in stone, it happens all the time or it
even happens most of the time.  To me this reads as Al has experienced this
phenonmenon in the past and has seen it often enough to feel confident in
his statement.  An experience is worth relating without having to produce
documented information to make it worth considering.


If someone comes forward and says that a particular event occurs and will
always occur without exception then I would expect to see some documentation
in the form of an experiment, history or whatever.  But all we had here was
an observation.


It's an interesting observation and may not have any hard
documentation...and does not need it.


Al, correct me if I'm off base here.

Indeed, I believe that the most common cause of set mashes (stuck sparges)
is overcrushing the grain... not *flour*, but rather *pulverised husks*.
Flour will convert to sugars (unless it is balled...).

The way this works is that the tee allows the siphon to break if the
suction is too high.  This setup is used in some commercial breweries,
but I personally feel that with a good crush and patience, you should
not need a siphon-breaker to prevent grain bed compaction.  If the
siphon-breaker actually "kicks in" and breaks the flow, you suck a
bunch of air into your hot wort -- *not* a good idea.  I recommend
you try decreasing the fine-ness of the crush, slowing the runnings,
and see if that doesn't help.

Subject: beer yeast bread


Ive only done it once, but my bread came out well. I did not make a 
"sponge" or feed the yeast with malt or sugar. I just scraped out my primary
(after collecting most of it for washing) and added flour and water kneaded 
and let it rise.  I had what seemed like a fairly large volume of yeast for
a loaf of bread.  It took a typical length of time to rise.  It acted
a lot like normal baking yeast.  The only major difference was that the
bread had a distinct-but not unpleasant-bitterness to it.  I assumed it
was from hops, but then also seemed to remember that excessive amounts of 
yeast could cause betterness.  Well anyway it was easy and effective so
I'll probably do it again soon.

I read about it in HBD, perhaps 1987 or 1988, I think.  I tested it with
a sixpack of heavily skunked Newcastle Brown Ale (note, *clear* bottles).
I have posted this three or four times over the last 6 years on HBD, so
it has been at least *seen* by my peers if not *reviewed* by them.


All I did was take one bottle out of a sixpack immedately upon returning
from the store where this sixpack of NBA was sitting inches from a
fluorescent light.  It was *extremely* skunky.  I put the rest of this
sixpack in the beer fridge, which is at 50F (Hunter Airstat Thermostat).
A week later, I tried several more and there was virtually no skunky
aroma.


Try it yourself!


As for if the beer was actually refridgerated at 50F, would it prevent
skunking in the stores, the initial HBD post I read said that the beer
needed to be kept in the dark at 50F.  I don't know the chemistry of
prenyl mercaptan creation or breakdown, but would welcome an explanation
from our resident chemists.

I would recommend a thermocouple and digital thermometer combination.
This works well for lots of things. You get one digital thermometer and
as many thermocouples as you may need. For the fermenter, you get a 1/4"
dia cylindrical thermocouple and a compression/npt fitting. Drill & tap
the fermenter to match the npt fitting, and using teflon tape thread it
in and tighten it up. Then run the thermocouple through the compression
fitting and tighten it up. This will be very watertight.
        The thermocouple will have a plug on the end so the rest of the device
isn't dedicated. To get the temp just plug in the digital thermometer
and get a reading. I have other probes I use for mashing and assorted
other non-brewing things. Should you need more specific directions (like
who makes this stuff, where to get it and how much it cost me) please

My favorite is the LaBEERdor Retriever.  Heres why...


 When my black Lab was about a year old we were out on our nightly walk
down the creek behind my house when she stopped running around in the
water as labs *love* to do and started to sniff inside a gopher hole on
the sandy bank of the creek. She began to dig a little and then sniff
some more which was followed by a more rapid digging and yet a third
sniff of the gopher hole. Now my dog was at a fever pitch of digging and
I heard a metallic "clink" about every second or third stroke of her
paws and I thought...metal gopher?!?. After 30 sec. of this digging
frenzy she stuck her head in the hole she had dug, grabbed on to
something and pulled it out. Low and behold the "metal gopher" was a
full, intact, Mickey's big mouth beer. Now I haven't had a Mickeys since
my swill drinking days of high school but my pooch and I sat of the bank
of the creek and split her first kill as a LaBEERdor Retiever...

Here's a question I forgot to ask in my last post:


A lot of us can probably imagine ourselves as proprietors of micro-breweries or

of such an establishment, and what kind of legal standards are there (if any) 
with regard to the beer served?  I'm thinking of US Federal and state law.  
Some states regulate maximum alcohol content in beers.  Are there other 
regulations?

Subject: Cold Break separation using CF wort chiller


Nathan asks:


>Two things.  Does anyone out there that uses a counterflow chiller have a
>system for removing break material from the fermentor?  


Yes, but it may seem a bit unorthodox. 


1. Chill the cast out wort to ~45-50*F and transfer directly to a CO2-purged
carboy, careful not to admit any air.


2. Cover, and allow to sit overnight to settle trub and to reach pitching
temperature.


3. In morning, siphon wort off trub into primary fermenter, aerating well.


4. Pitch yeast prepared the previous night.


One advantage of doing it this way is it permits the addition of a huge
starter that is already acclimated to the particular wort you've just made.
Before you fill the CO2-purged carboy, reserve approxamately 0.5-0.75-gallon
of wort in a 1-gal jug. Into that, pour the contents of a 1-qt starter,
preferably in full kraeusen. By morning, the new starter will be crawling
out of the jug, and you will notice visible activity in the fermenter within
4-6 hours.


>Second, can anyone describe what sort of "off flavors" end up in the final
>product if the break is not adequately removed?


This I can't answer, but I'd like to ask the corollary: What are the
dangers, if any, to removing ALL the cold break? I don't have any hard data,
but with Wyeast 1968, I seem to be getting more active ferments WITH the
cold break.

Go to the Brewery, <http://alpha.rollanet.org/>, and check out the Hops FAQ

If you have problem connecting via WWW, I can mail you a copy.


Well, regarding how hop varities differ, I guess the answer is: it depends.
There are some that are very different and some which are pretty close.

I don't know if pH can affect colour or body. My guess would be that it's
the mash program that differs. Pilsner Urquell for example uses a very
extensive decoction program (>6 hours ?) with a long acid rest etc. If you
don't use a decoction mash I think that would be a good idea (but not as
extensive as PU's) to get a more golden colour and a fuller mouthfeel.


Since you get a fine head I don't think you have to few proteins, which
also are important for mouthfeel. Maybe you could try mashing at a slightly
higher temperature to get more dextrins.

what effect putting a couple hop pellets (they were some left-over
Northern brewer) into the bottle would have.  I tried this 
with three bottles but have to wait a few weeks until they're
ready.  If anyone has tried this can you answer the following:
Will it add to the hop aroma/flavor ?  Will the three bottles get a 
nasty infection ?  Will it have any effect other than to cause
me to have little green things floating in my glass ?

You're confusing a couple of effects. High pH and hight sparge water
temperature contribute to the leaching of tannins and silicates from the
husks of the grain in the lauter tun. While this additional stuff in the
beer will increase the SG it will only do so by a tiny bit. More important
is that the tannins will make the beer astringent.


pH does have a potential effect on body. The enzymes which degrade proteins
and sugars each perform at rates which depend on temperature and pH.
Operate outside the temperature/pH range for a given enzyme and it will do
its job slowly if at all. Mouthfeel/body is due to the presence of proteins
and unfermentable sugars within certain ranges of molecular weight. Some
say that not much protein digestion takes place in the mash tun but no one
would disagree that conversion of starch to sugar does. Generally speaking,
low conversion temperatures (below 65C) result in the production of small
sugars which ferement completely. The beer is alcoholic but thin as none of
the longer sugars (dextrines) are there to lend body. Conversely at higher
conversion temperatures more dextrines are formed at the expense of
maltose, the beer is less alcoholic but thicker. If the pH is too high
conversion takes a long time and/or does not complete before the enzymes
are deactivated by temperature with the result that some starch does not
convert. Under these conditions the wort is of low gravity and, unless it
is concentrated by boiling, will produce a weak and watery beer.

Graham Stone asked about the flavor effects of HSA. The theory is that HSA
leads to oxidation of melanoidins and that the oxidized melanoidins are
themselves oxidizing agents capable of oxidizing alcohols into aldehydes.
Thus the associated flavors are the traditional aldehyde staling ones of
wet cardboard, sherry etc. Bear in mind that many of these redox reactions
are quite slow so that the ale you are going to have drunk up in a month is
much less likely to suffer from HSA than the Bock you plan to lager for
over a year.

John Hessling wonders where he goofed in his first brew: an all-grain
recipe! Well, John, I'd say yoy didn't fare too badly. If you decided to
start learning the piano with the Goldberg Variations you shouldn't be too
surprised if that knock on your door is a representative of the homeowners
association rather than a guy from a record company. The vegetable taste
could indeed be due to DMS formation in the long cooling process or it
could be due to contamination. The cloudiness could be due to poor starch
conversion from a poor crush or incomplete doughing in or insufficient
lautering prior to sparge. There are about a million little details here
that you are just going to have to pick up as you learn. Get a good book,
like Brewing Lager Beer. You'll see that you had better luck than Greg
Noonan when he started out as you did. Read HBD and most of all brew as
often as you can. The usual advice would be to start with extract brewing
so that you have wort handling, hopping, sanitation, chilling, aeration,
fermentation and bottling under your belt before adding the complications
of mashing. As you are learning resist the temptation to brew a stout this
session and a wheat beer the next. Get a workable ale recipe and stick with
it, varying one parameter at a time, until you get a reasonable beer and
repeatable results.
When you are not brewing read, visit breweries and ask questions, join a
brewing club.


As to the result of your first effort not being that hot: one of the
biggest lies homebrewers tell themselves (and each other) is that all
homebrew is better than commercial beer. It ain't so. It will take some
time and experience before you can surpass the commercial guys but your
patience and dilligence will be rewarded. Nevertheless you will still
occasionally brew a beer that even Walt won't drink (nobody here knows Walt
so I can say that).
