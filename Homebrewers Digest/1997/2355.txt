Patent applications don't contain that sort of info.  This was
strictly a FWIW suggestion.  I can't recommend it as a sure cure for
skunkiness, just an interesing note for the experimentally inclined
brewer.  Might work - might not.

Prenyl mecaptans contain sulphur, humulones don't.  So where does the
mercaptan sulphur come from ?  Doesn't seem likely to come from the
X-methyl-sulfides in the hops oils to me.  Without knowing more about
the chemistry producing the mercaptans from isohululones I'd be
hesitant to state what is or isn't involved in this sequence of
reactions.

Actually ~0.5ppm zinc is a yeast growth requirement.  5ppm (5mg/L)
will keep you well below any harmful dose unless you're planning on
drinking more than 20 L/day regularly.  100mg/day is suggested as an
upper limit for human ingestion.  Note that a lot of zinc is lost in
the yeast layer too.


For a brief but referenced discussion of light-stuck beer see G.Fix's
PoBS, I believe he may sites the references you seek.  George says
400nm to 500nm light will skunk beer. 400-500 nm is well into the
visible range and soft glass will be transparent to these wavelengths.
Fix also stated that these reactions are well understood (tho not by
me).

Howdy:


        I have been subscribing to the Digest for over a year now and have
been just a quiet observer, but lately I have been having a problem some of
you old pros may be able to help with (hopefully) or at least find
interesting.
        My problem is, apparently, contamination.  There is a terrible
"winey" taste in my last two batches, and they are <WAY> over-carbonated,
sort-of like cola.  I have been brewing almost three years now and I have
never contaminated a batch since right as I was starting up brewing, and
that was a different contamination. (That one had the characteristic white
ring of bacteria in the bottle-necks at the surface, these do not.  Also
tasted different.)
        That said, I want to say that I am very cautious in my yeast
culturing technique and I have a slight advantage: I work in a boilogical
research laboratory.  My yeast cultures are glycerol-frozen and stored in
liquid nitrogen, and every time I thaw one to make a starter, I
streak-plate in a sterile culture hood to make sure it is pure.  I have
caught low-level contaminations this way in the past before they could do
any damage.  I am also able to autoclave my carboys and bottles.  (For
those who may not have heard of one, an autoclave is a special pressurized
oven used to sterilize instruments and heat liquids to boiling temperatures
without them actually boiling.)  At home I thoroughly soak in bleach
anything that cannot be autoclaved eg. tubing. I realize some of you
pooh-pooh bleach, but the problems with bleach are usually "over-doing" it,
arent they?
        The only two things that I can think of are #1:  I have just had
poor luck lately and my sterile technique at home could use even more work
(suggestions?), or #2: my yeast, specifically brewers yeasts that we all
know and love, were never meant to be treated like laboratory yeasts, and
they are somehow losing their "good" properties?  NOTE: I culture them both
in liquid culture (including my starter) and on solid agar plates here in
the lab using a yeast propigation medium called YPD.  It consists of 1%
yeast extract and 2% bacto-peptone (both common laboratory media
ingredients), and 2% glucose.  That is all; it's very bare-bones stuff.
Could the lovely brewers' yeasts be getting "sick" in this media, somehow
becoming no longer capable of making my wort taste like beer?  I have
discussed this with some of my brewmeister freinds, and we just don't know.
I HAVE made good beer in the past this way, but certainly not recently.
Please feel free to criticize me in any way you feel like, I certainly need
the help.  I am getting <GASP> turned off on the whole homebrew thing
lately because of this.
P.S.  Has anyone tried the yeast cultures from the Yeast Culure Kit Company
in MI? I used these for the aforementioned last two batches, but surely
that cant be the problem?

re: Stainless Steel Pots, William Rich noted he had large quantities of foam
when the boil started and noted:


>The bottom line is, I think anything less than a 10 gallon pot is too 
>small for 5 gallon batches.  Opinions?


I use a 33 qt. enamel pot with success for boiling 6 to 6.5 gal all grain
worts.  Over a propane burner, with a cover over the top and left
unattended, it would very readily boil over.  I remove the cover just prior
to the onset of boiling (it's 2/3 on during preboil) and gently stir the
foam back into the wort as it is formed during the first 5-10 mins. of the
boil.  After this initial crop of foam is taken care of, there's very little
subsequent foaming.  Others recommend skimming off the initial foam.
- -------------------------------------------------
re: the ongoing wort canning and botulsim debate:


I kinda started this juggernaut of a thread so, I feel like I own the
readership a followup.  I've have always canned starter worts via processing
30 minutes in a boiling water bath instead of the recommended pressure
canner.  Based on Scott's and others cautionary posts and some outside
reading, I popped the top on a recently canned bottle of starter and tested
it with pH paper.  ~5.0!  I've been lucky with this and the previous batches
(~7 gals. total) 'cause I've not been "botulized" even tho' I always sample
the starters before pitching and (usually) before stepping up.  


Henceforth, I'm continuing to use a boiling water bath for processing but
I'll adjust the wort pH to <= 4.5 with lactic acid.

Bill Griffin flamed Al K. for proposing a web page listing of the errors in
popular brewing texts and impugned Al's brewing expertise.  Oh yeah, there
was that alledged spelling error dig re: "compleat"  (it may not be in
Bill's spelling checker it is in the '79 Webster's New Collegiate
Dictionary).  Bill also said:
 >Instead of nitpicking you should praise the effort of those who are 
 >honestly trying to help improve homebrewing.  Or aren't you a big 
 >enough person to do that?
Finally, Bill wants any flames via private e-mail to "save bandwidth"!  
The brewing text authors in question are human as far as I know and hence
can and do make errors.  Other than buying a more expensive subsequent
edition (when and if available...), I know of no errata published for the
inevitable mistakes.  For this reason, I'm eagerly awaiting Al's listing
even tho' it too will probably have mistakes or items we disagree with.
Also, we can question Al about his ideas and get feedback.  Al posts
regularly herein and I've learned alot from him and the threads spun from
his posts.  Other than George Fix (THANKS George!), I've never seen any
Digest postings from the other authors defended by Mr. Griffin.  I'm
certianly not denigrating their HUGE contributions to homebrewing- it's just
that one learns alot from the dialectic thesis/antithesis type of forum this
Digest affords while books are largely a one-way exchange of ideas.  An
excellent example of this is the aforementioned botulism thread- the boiling
water bath canning method w/o pH adjustment is straight out of Miller's
book.  I've also learned a little something about Bill Griffin from his
unwarranted flaming of Al...  


Three cheers for Al's endeavor!

If this method is tried, consider the following:
- --Make sure the edges of the hole in the PET bottle are very smooth.  Jagged
edges will function as stress risers and hence greatly weaken the PET bottle.   
- --Hydrostatically pressure test the bottle before you use it.
- --At least until you've some experience with completed kegs, put the
completed keg into a larger, covered container in case the joint doesn't work.  
- --Roughen the surface of the penetration tubing to get a better bond with
the silicone.


I've had good luck with 3 liter PET soda bottles modified for use as short
term (1 month) beer kegs and longer term (3 months so far) soda storage;
however,  the CO2-in and beer-out lines are in the caps instead of in the
PET bottles themselves.  Details are accessable via the URL in the sig. line

Nathan asks:
| >
| >Two things.  Does anyone out there that uses a counterflow chiller have a
| >system for removing break material from the fermentor?  


Harlan adds:
| Yes, but it may seem a bit unorthodox. 
|  
| 1. Chill the cast out wort to ~45-50*F and transfer directly to a CO2-purged
| carboy, careful not to admit any air.
|  
| 2. Cover, and allow to sit overnight to settle trub and to reach pitching
| temperature.
|  
| 3. In morning, siphon wort off trub into primary fermenter, aerating well.


I do this also, with all my beers except I only cool it to 65-70 and only
wait a few hours for the trub to settle.  (Also, I don't think that CO2
purging is necessary, if you make sure the tip of the racking hose is
under the surface of the beer when you rack.)


How do I get the trub to fall out of suspension so fast?  Wheat.


I add a half-pound of malted wheat to every batch solely for this purpose.
I don't know the scientific explaination, but it works.  I have experimented
with different amounts of wheat (none, 4oz, 8oz) and adding the 8oz of
wheat in my 5 gallon batches *definitely* makes the trub fall out of
suspension much faster.


I've also noticed a big difference in cooling methods on the action of
trub percipitation.  When I replaced my immersion chiller with a
counter-flow chiller, I noticed that the trub fell *much* quicker, and
was more compact.


| >Second, can anyone describe what sort of "off flavors" end up in the final
| >product if the break is not adequately removed?
|  
| This I can't answer, but I'd like to ask the corollary: What are the
| dangers, if any, to removing ALL the cold break? I don't have any hard data,
| but with Wyeast 1968, I seem to be getting more active ferments WITH the
| cold break.


I noticed a marked improvement when I started removing the trub before
fermentation, but have since forgotton what the difference is--I've been
doing it this way for a few years now.  Next beer I make, I'm only going
to rack half of it off the trub.  I'll let you all know what differences
I find.


However, I don't try to remove every trace of trub, as I have been told
that that would be a bad idea.  I let a little of the lighter trub siphon
over toward the end of the racking.

Yep!  When I had fresh hops growing in my backyard, I bottle- hopped IPAs
on two different occasions.  I directly compared the hopped bottles with
the unhopped and there was a big difference in the nose (surprise).


> bottled a batch of American Brown Ale and got to wondering

I did it only with whole hop cones.  The only problem is that the hop
cone is a good nucleation site for the CO2 bubbles, and you get some
foaming when you open the beer (but not gushing).


> Will it add to the hop aroma/flavor?


Definitely.


> Will the three bottles get a nasty infection?


No, in my case.  I would say the risk of infection is *very* small.
(Do you sterilize your hops when you dry-hop?)


> Will it have any effect other than to cause

Probably some extra foaming like I mentioned earlier.

Subject: Composition of extract from steeped versus mashed grains


Looking for information or scientific info on the relative 
compositions of the extract gained from specialty grains and
malts (crystals, brown, chocolate, black barley, black patent,
roasted barley etc. etc.).  I want to compare the composition of
the extract gained by mashing the specialty grains and malts with
the base malt(s) to the extract gained by steeping them in
untreated water at 150-160 F.  I have some references already,
but am highly interested in verifying the results that I've read
and experienced.  Any experts out there?  Noonan?  You there?  How
about you, Dave Miller?  (I just ate at your pub about a week ago
on a business trip to Nashville...nice brews, nice food!  See you
next time!).  George Fix?  Meyers, Daniels, Richman???  Any other
experts out there hanging around that I wasn't good enough to name?


FYI, when I say 'composition' of the extract, I'm referring to color,
flavor, fermentable, nonfermentable, and any other solubles or
suspended solids that may end up in the extract.


If you want to get very particular, then the question to answer is,
can I get away with mashing only the base malts and then steeping
the specialty grains and malts?  The technique would be to calculate,
using your known extract efficiency, the expected contribution to
the SG in a mash.  Then, knowing your extract efficiency for
steeped grains, increase the amount of specialty grains and malts
to derive the same contribution to SG in the wort.  Or is it your
opinion that even though the SG contribution was the same for each
of the specialty grains and malts, that due to a different composition
of the extracts (balance of the various components), the wort
would not turn out to be the same after all?


TIA!

It's happenned to me, even on a cold Chicago winter day!  Last winter on
a bright, sunny, but cold (about 20 deg. F) winter day I poured a
home-brewed Munich Helles into a clear mug and took it outside with me
to go and split some firewood.  After about 5-10 minutes of chopping, I
went over to the beer and took a sip.  It had turned into a skunky
Beck's light in that short period of a time!  I thought it was pretty
cool, so I tried it again that same afternoon with an Oktoberfest and
the same thing happenned.  The beers were perfectly "un"skunky prior to
taking them outside.

Mine did fit, just barely, under the range hood.  I usually would pull
the stove about 1 1/2 feet away from the wall to give me more room.  And
yes! -I did have to stand on a stool to stir and to look into into the
kettle.  I forgot to add in my last post that I was able to maintain a
12-13 gallon boil on the stovetop.

Subject: Warming up a stout


OK, so maybe I've "relaxed and had a home-brew" a bit much tonight, but I
was wondering what would be the effect of warming a 35 degree Fahrenheit
beer (specifically a stout) in a microwave for oh say 10-20 seconds?


Tonight I decided that I wanted one more home-brew, but all my beer was
still quite cold.  Dilemma.  I'm sitting here with an empty glass, full
bottle, waiting for the beer to warm up, thus the above question comes to
mind.


On a related, but a bit more serious note, which warms up faster an opened
or an unopened bottle?  Or does it really matter?  I would think an opened
bottle, but I don't have a good reason why.


Well, my "Black-Lab Stout" is getting to a drinkable temperature, so I'll
leave it at that.  TIA

That's a very nice story, Charlie, but it doesn't answer 
the question. Is the AHA an *association*, or a *company*? 
If it's the latter, why don't you say so? I'm sure if it 
were called "The American Homebrewer's Corporation" nobody 
would be very upset that the fees they pay - which are now 
somewhat deceptively referred to as "dues" - subsidize your

If the AHA is to be a real association of members, the members 
are the ones who should run it, through elections of officials. 
If it's a corporation, it should not be masquerading as an 
association.

I have a very basic question that I believe will cut to the heart 
of the matter.  If the AOB is a business, who owns it?  There are 
no stockholders.  If the membership "owns" the AOB, they should 
have direct control over how it is structured and run through the
election of officers and board members.


Today, our involvement is limited to funding the business and none 
of the board members, officers or staff are in any way accountable 
to the membership.  So again I pose my question:  Who owns the AOB?


As to Charlie's epistle, I can't feel sorry for *anyone* who makes 
six figures drinking and writing about beer.  By the way Charlie, 
there are some of us working a lot more than 50 hours a week for 
much less money having much less fun.

Subject: AHA/AOB: the $100,000 Question (Part 2)


[more r.c.b. replies to Charlie]


Recall the the admonition I received last year from longtime AHA 
Board of Advisors Member Jeff Frane (posted in full an earlier 
message):


>The people running the AHA are not going to give up control or 
>money, period. If you think they might, you're deluding yourself.


After reading Charlie's recent posting, there should be no doubt in 
anyone's mind that Mr. Frane was 100% correct.  We can add that not 
only will the people running the AHA never give up control or money, 
they won't even discuss those issues.


>I can recall the days [snip]


As Yo-Yo inquired, what does this history have to do with the price 
of tea (or beer)?  The questions that I and others have been asking 
for months are essentially (1) why can't AHA (and IBS) "members" 
have any role whatsoever in selecting the officers or directors of 
the AOB/AHA, (2) why should this organization be paying Charlie 
in excess of $100,000 for a position that apparently involves little 
or no management, oversight, or apparently much else other than why 
globetrotting and promoting his Avon-published books, and 
(3) WHY WON'T THE AOB ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS?? 


(BTW, per Charlie's confessions of how much he has made in the past 
from non-AHA jobs, perhaps in the interest of completeness he would 
also tell us how much he makes from Avon and his other publishers -- 
and whether these for-profit publishers are ever asked to reimburse 
the AHA for all the free press the AHA gives gives TCNJOHB.)

This really sums up the problem at the AOB/AHA.  The head of the 
AOB won't even bother to *read* -- much less respond to -- 
complaints about that organization, and feels it is not necessary 
to explain to AHA members why they are getting their money's worth 
by paying his stratospheric salary and benefits.  


And the AHA wonders why its membership is declining!  


>There's really nothing in my life that I feel the need to defend.  I
>enjoy it immensely [snip]


No one doubts that you're having a good time, Charlie.  The question
is whether a nonprofit organization should be paying you that much 
money to do so.


>Finally, I'd like to tap out a few most important words of thanks to all

>Association of Brewers the support and continuing confidence that has

And, of course, pay Charlie in excess of $100,000 per annum, for which 
he will thank you but won't explain why he should be receiving it.




When this thread started last year, it was entitled "Boycott the AHA."  
A number of readers indicated that critics should try to work and fix 
what everyone (even the AOB) acknowledges are problems in that that 
organization, rather than simply grousing about it.  As Charlie's
posting makes crystal clear, that recommended course of action is 
illusory: as several Board of Advisors have told me repeatedly, Charlie 
and his minions simply won't do anything that they don't want to do -- 
even something as simply as answering questions.  And there's nothing 
AHA members can do about it.


So what do we do?  It is now apparent that trying to work with 
the AHA is a waste of time.  I suggest first putting your time 
and money into your local homebrew club, rather than the AHA.  
Second, I suggest reminding the AHA of their response (more 
accurately, their lack of a response) to this thread the next 
time they come looking for volunteers (and certified beer 
judges) for their various events (as Steve Moore noted, most 
of what they do could not be done without *lots* of volunteer 
labor).  Third, if you've not already do so, switch your 
reading from Zymurgy to BT or BYO.


And fourth, maybe invest in shirts, buttons, and bumperstickers 
that read:


             Relax, don't worry, just send money
             (and don't ask any questions)

Here's an anecdotal data point -- A friend of mine from Lancashire used
to mix draught bitters with bottled brown ale to make (naturally) a
"brown and bitters".  The bottled brown ale was low in alcohol -- I seem
to remember the label saying about 2.5%, though I'm reaching for some
very dusty neurons.  His rationale for the mixture was: 1) Lower alcohol
content meant a longer and more social evening at the pub (he was a very
slight man); 2) He liked the taste.

Subject: Homemade RIMS question






This is an open question to those out there who have constructed their own 
RIMS system.  I constructed mine pretty similar to the one outlined in the 
1995 All-Grain Zymurgy issue "Mash Systems & Components" by John Roberts.  I 
used the same Little Giant pump and Vulcan heating element.
My question/problem is this:  I initially mounted my heating element inside 
1 inch PVC which, in retrospect, was a pretty stupid idea. After 4 or 5 
brews, the heating element melted the PVC and split the pipe, luckily at the 
tail end of a sparging session.  Not only that, but after I disassembled the 
unit, I found that the very small volume of the 1 inch pipe caramelized the 
wort and left quite a bit of scorched residue on the element (I wouldn't 
doubt if I left the heater on once or twice while the pump was off).  I 
initially wanted a bigger housing for the element but had a hard time 
locating equipment.
In the article, John Roberts has the heating element is mounted inside a 1 
1/2 inch copper tubing but the Vulcan element has a 1 inch NPT(M) fitting. 
 Can anyone give a schematic of the materials they used for their heating 
element housing and suggestions as to where I could get them?
Thanks.

I use that method and the location of the web site is shown below.
It came about as a result of various leftovers in my equipment
developement.  The bucket I use is not really my hot liquor tank though
it started out as one.  It's nothing more than a 5 gal bucket with a
1500 watt water heater element installed in the side.  The web site has
links to Dion H's excellent document on how to build an elctric brewery.
I plug this puppy in when I start heating my mash water.  By the time I
need it, the bucket is at 200-212 degrees.  BE CAREFUL, do not allow
this device to run dry, potential fire and health risks aside, my wife
would kill me if I burned down the house.
I've installed a water heater thermostat as a saftey precaution.  I
bolted it to the mounting flange of the heater element.  Due to poor
heat coupling it's calibration is way off but it will shut down the
element if the bucket boils dry.


The copper coil is 25 feet of 1/4 inch line originally designed as an
immersion chiller.  It consists of two spirals with gradually increasing
diameter, about 6 inches high, tied together with 12 gauge solid copper
wire.  


I recirculate from the mash tun through a pump into the coil and back
into the MT.  A ball valve on the inlet side of the mash tun allows me
to control the flow rate.  A desired addition would be an inline
thermometer on the outlet side of the coil.  When mashout is reached, I
remove the coil from the bucket and continue to pump till the wort
clears.  Once this happens, I disconnect the coil from the mash tun
inlet and attach it to the boiling kettle inlet, continuing to pump as I
sparge.

Actually, Dave, there is a protocol.  Perhaps you've been following
it and just didn't know it. And it is precisely because of this
voluntarily followed protocol that the HBD has such a high
signal-to-noise ratio. After joining the HBD as my first email
discussion group I have become spoiled and can not tolerate other
discussion groups that don't follow these simple rules. Here is the
gist of this protocol as I understand it:


1) If you have a response to someone else's post, first ask yourself
if it is of general interest? If not, then private email is probably
most appropriate. This especially goes for flames and arguments!


2) If it is of general interest, then next ask yourself if you
anticipate that a lot of other people will also throw in their $0.02?
Nobody likes to see 20 posts to the HBD all containing the exact
same info because that wastes space that other information could
have been posted to.  If you expect that you have a unique answer,
then go ahead and post to the HBD directly.  But if you think your
answer is more mundane and others may offer the same advice, then
private email is more appropriate.


3) If you receive a lot of private email responses to your question,
and some of this information was not also posted to the HBD, then
perhaps a summary post to the HBD is appropriate.  Share the
knowledge that you have gained *in a digested format* with the rest
of us. To determine if this is appropriate or not, see steps 1&2
above.


4) And finally, if you are interested in the responses to someone 
else's question but don't have anything to offer, then send them 
private email asking them to either forward responses to you or 
better, to post a summary to the HBD.


These four simple rules are what keeps the quality of the HBD so 
high by keeping out redundant posts, "Me Too" posts, and posts that 
are not of general interest!
=================================


Now a question: Has anyone else out there experienced a loss of
taste/interest for beer related to chemotherapy?  If so, was is
temporary (God, please say yes!)?  Lately, I have not had much
interest in drinking beer especially the more bitter kinds like APA,
normally my favorite.  Porters and stouts, however, I still enjoy
for the most part. And I do still enjoy the brewing process (I'm in
the process of upgrading my RIMS to be more automated by adding a
PID temp controller!). I know that chemo can do weird things to your
taste buds, but beer is really the only thing I have noticed that I
have had a decreased interest in.  Luckily my treatments will only
last for another 6 or 7 months assuming things go as expected, so
I'm just hoping that this is just another *temporary* side effect of
the chemo!

Subject: partial mash/old hops




I plan on doing a very partial mash with the following 
grain bill:
        2# Pale Malt
        1# Munich Malt
        .75# Crystal Malt
        .75# Cara-Pils Malt
        .5# Chocolate Malt


In 1.25 gal. of water(1 quart per pound of malt?) I plan on 
mashing for 1 hour at 155 deg.(or as close to that as possible 
on my stove top with a hand-held thermometer).  I will then sparge 
with hot water through a standard kitchen strainer.  Nothing fancy 
here.  
My question- What kind of yield should I expect?  In other words, 
if I would like 7 pounds worth of liquid malt extract, how much LME 
should I add after I do this?  Also, need I worry about HSA during 
my not-so-sophisticated sparging technique?


I've also had some hops in my freezer for over six months in nothing 
more than plastic baggies.  Since they've probably lost some of their 
"hop power", what percentage more should I use to equal the same 
bitterness as fresh hops? (I will buy fresh hops for aroma).


TIA and a special salute to those who helped bring back HBD.

Subject: sierra nevada ale yeast


Out of curiosity, does anyone know the origins of this yeast (aka chico 
yeast, WY1056)? Is it an English ale yeast? Something cultured from the 
clean and slightly fruity Sierra Nevada air? On a related note, a local 
brewpub, reportedly using this yeast, has somehow created several ales 
reeking of diacetyl. In the many ales I tasted made with this yeast, I've 
never found this. Anyone ever experience this and have an idea what caused 
it?
Cheers,
Keith Houck
