Once you build and use a counterflow chiller you'll wonder why you ever
waited to do so. However, I think you're worrying a little too much
about the cold break. The most important thing about cold break is
"creating" it (which the counterflow chiller will do far more
effectively than the immersion), so that at some point it can be
separated from the rest of the beer. The importance of "when" to
separate it varies (see below). I think the option of recirculating
cooled wort back into your brewpot is probably a little too hazardous
from a bacteriologic (sp?) point of view and will also take so long that
the benefits of using a CF will be lost. I also think your option of
using a mason's jar to "filter" the cold break won't work very well
because you'll create more of this stuff than an ordinary mason's jar
can handle (even if a Choreboy, etc., was capable of filtering it). 


Most commerical breweries use a "holding tank" to help assist this
process, but the quantities of beer (and cold break) being produced are
vastly different than the homebrewer. For most ales, and for most
homebrewing purposes and quantities, given the relatively short duration
of primary fermentation, the effects of the cold break on the finished
beer are probably either minimal or unnoticeable. Some lagers, however,
such as an Oktoberfest, tend to clean up more nicely if you rack them
off the cold break immediately, though again it's a pretty subjective
thing. For those specific beers that might "potentially" really benefit
from it, you can always deal with the hassle of siphoning to the
primary. But I do think the most important thing is to "create" the cold
break so that "eventually" it can be removed. I've been using a CF for 3
years and have yet to rack off from the cold break before the primary
and have not had any identifiable problems with the finished product as
a result. 


Build and use the CF unit first to see what it's really buying you. Then
deal with the cold break as a separate issue, perhaps by doing two
batches to compare if you're still concerned.

There may be another, less sinister, but possibly more tragic explanation
for the nasty micro phenomena. The AB draft beers taste clean because the
have people who make certain that their draft lines are properly
maintained. Needless to say, they don't worry about how other people's

Bash AB all you want, but realize that their quality control is second to none.

Subject: Leffe recipe/ de-skunking/low-sparge


Hi.  
Leffe Blonde recipe wanted -- If anyone has made a brew that tastes like Leffe
Blonde, I'd greatly appreciate the recipe. I've searched Yahoo, Alta Vista,
Dogpile, etc., with no luck.  (An Affligem Tripel clone would be fine, too.)
All grain or extract.


De-skunking -- A while back, I bought a six pack of Ballentine IPA.  Didn't
notice the green bottles until I got home.  Noticed the skunkiness right away.
I keep my beer in the basement, and the temp is generally between 50 and 60 F.
I drank the first four within two or three weeks.  The other two got lost in the
crowd.  When I opened them a month or so later, there was no detectable
skunkiness.


Low-sparge brewing -- This is lazy and fun.  Nothing totally original, but
thought I'd share it, given the current discussion batch sparging.  The mashed
grains (generally 8-10 lbs.) go into a Zappap double bucket strainer.  I top off
with boiling water.  Magically, this seems to hit 170 F.  I stir, let sit for a
while, then drain.  Meanwhile, I heat more water to 170.  I put the wort on the
stove (this is my indoor, electric-stove, five-gallon-kettle, winter survivial
method), dump the hot water into the lauter tun, and draw off more as needed to
fill the kettle during the first part of the boil.  I get a decent 25 points,
and some tasty brews.  And I only tie up one burner.  Generally, I do this for
hi-grav small batches.

Subject: Skunkiness


Brewsters:


I sense a pattern developing.  Both Pat Babcock here and Jay Ward in a private
communication commented that they experience skunking of beer in their mugs on
the patio in a very short time and others have noted it in the past.  Also our
friend in Grapevine Tx agrees with Jay in that both brew on the patio in bright
light and never get skunking.  


Now the point of Jay's comments is that he mainly brews porters.  And Pat noted
that the skunkiness went away in the shade.


I have mainly been thinking in terms of skunking in the *body* of the beer and
concern that there is just not enough light intensity to skunk a beer in a few
minutes, especially in a mug or glass and particularly with a highly colored
beer.


I can explain all these results to my satisfaction if what is happening is a
surface photolysis on the surface of the beer in the glass or mug. There is no
glass in the way to absorb UV or other light. There is a high concentration of
photosylates directly under the drinker's nose ( even though the actual amount
may be small) and it can even work with dark beers like a porter, since
penetration into the body of the beer is not necessary.  Removal of the beer
from direct sunlight will allow the minunte amount of prenyl mercaptan to be
purged or just drift away on the wind.


The surface to volume ratio in a wort is small and likely any photolysis product
formed was purged during fermentation.


Now the test.  Take a highly hopped beer in two mugs 1 covered, the other
exposed to the light. Any difference in the aroma?  Switch which mug is covered.
Result?


Keep on brewin'

i've been planning to blend it with a new batch of lambic this spring.  should
i blend at pitching, some time during the primary, or during the secondary?
also, could the new vigorous yeast help my suspected oxidation problem, or

i had a kolschbier that turned out pretty good last year, and after it got 
about a year old, it had a skunky component to it.  it was in green glass, 
but also in the basement freezer the whole time.  no strong light ever
struck it.  not even medium strength light.  just another data point. pale
beer, noble hops, no significant light exposure.

Subject: Charlie's view from on high


Charlie P. finally comments on the AOB and AHA.  As one who has made
comments critical of both CP and the organizations, I thought I'd respond:


>...we set forth on the endeavor that has become the Association of Brewers...


There's no doubt that being able to work on a hobby as a full time job is a
great opportunity and to a point I think many of the biggest critics are
slightly jealous.  How many times have we heard people moan about having
worked as an underpaid, underappreciated technical reviewers for Zymurgy
and other brewing publications?


The attacks you call "personal" are directed at the PERCEIVED manner in
which the AOB/AHA is run.  There have been many requests for access to
financial information and cathy in HBD #2347 essentially told us that we
wouldn't understand because after all, there were 35 pages of information.
Attitudes like that tend to invite criticism.


>...I don't feel it necessary to defend
>my personal lifestyle, philosophy, reasons for being involved in the
>beer business, my salary, or my position at the Association of Brewers.


I'll agree with you on every item except the last.  You are president of a
non-profit organization that collects "dues" from "members".  The question
has been asked "what do you do?"  There's a PERCEPTION that the primary job
is an intercontinental pub crawl - but you've never said otherwise.


We are continuously told how well the AHA is run, but serious questions are
always ignored.  Here are a few examples.


#1.  Louis Bonham asked:
> > how much AOB president Charlie Papazian makes from this "nonprofit"
> > organization, in terms of salary and paid travel, ... concerns were
> > amplified by the AOB's rather bizarre refusal to release copies of
> > their IRS Form 990 upon request.


Cathy`at`aob.org answered:
> Let me stress again, that the AOB followed the law with respect to our
> 990's....


So we had a clear question about salary and paid travel (items that would
seem to be easily addressed) and were answered with we "followed the law".
I note that the salary question was answered eventually and the dollar
figure given is not unreasonable.  Travel cost and non-salary compensation
questions haven't been answered.


#2.  How are board members appointed/Should the board of advisors be voted on?
cathy`at`aob.org said:
> Please understand that we are a business with a
> board of directors made up of business and professional people in the
> Boulder/Denver area.  These people take their board positions very
> seriously.


I've always assumed they took their jobs seriously.  However, how are they
appointed?  Who appoints them?  Can they be fired?  By whom?


>(68% of the respondents did not want to vote for the board of advisors)


I would be interested in knowing what percent of members responded!  If the
general feeling is that the organization leadership is unresponsive to
members' opinions, then they might not bother.  If 68% of a 50% response
rate said this, then you would be looking at 34% actual number.  (I know,
people who don't vote don't deserve to have their opinions counted - but
I'm not the one that used the survey to make a point)


#3.  Pulling out of the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP)


The only reason ever given was that the AHA was going to start their own
competing program.  No specific problems with the BJCP were ever cited; no
discussion of any problems was ever presented in Zymurgy; no AHA program
has appeared.  Open speculation was that the AHA wanted a program it would
control.


Maybe hops make you overly susceptible to conspiracy theories, but any
outside person has to wonder what is going on.

Isn't that kind of a cheap shot?  I may be pecking away at my keyboard, but
I have fun brewing, I have fun helping out with our local club.  I DONATE
my time because I enjoy what I'm doing.


Question how the AOB operates and you are called "angry" - what next?  Are
we "nattering nabobs of negativism"?  There is nothing gained by getting
into name-calling when someone asks difficult questions.  Just answer them.

Subject: Porter


Hal posted a brilliant idea... mixing modern beers.


My *guess* (purely *speculation*) for getting a feel for
an 18-th century Porter, might be to mix a strong brown
beer (because back then, they brewed 'em much stronger),
with a sour beer (that's the stale (or "aged" in modern
terms) part), and a woody beer (for the long aging in
wood).


How about this:


60% Old Peculier or McEwan's Scotch Ale
10% Cantillon or Boon Gueuze/Geuze
30% Rodenbach Grand Cru


Yes, the Rodenbach is sour, but I suspect not sour enough and note
that the Cantillon or Boon would also add a horsey character which
would not be out-of-place in a Porter.


Comments?  Different proportions?  Different beers?

Subject: Re: portable co2 solutions for Cornelius Kegs


Greetings all!


First of all let me express my appreciation to all those individuals,
past and present, for their efforts toward the continuation of the HBD
tradition. And a special note of thanks to Observer Eccentric Online
for providing an Internet on-ramp for the system.


In #2352 Scott asked about a portable CO2 system for corny's.
I think the system you mentioned is sold by "Williams Brewing Supply",
their ads are  in all the major beer magazines, I have also seen the ad
but if I remember correctly the system was fairly pricey.


Here is another idea that I have been using for some time, I obtained a
low pressure air regulator (from an auto supply store or painters supply,
any place that sells air compressors) and plumbed it up to a spare corny
keg.  I fill the spare keg with about 60-80 psi of CO2 from my 20# tank
and using the low pressure regulator push the beer with 10-15 psi,
this setup allows the one CO2 corny to dispense several kegs of homebrew
and means my heavy tank and valve system stays put safely at home.
I use this setup on my beer fridge in the garage (if my system springs a
leak somewhere I only loose the CO2 in my low pressure tank), and it is light
weight and handy when I am purging a corny/carboy or starting a siphon.


On another subject, It was great to hear from Charlie P. in #2353 and I second
his comment:

This forum is an interesting beast, for the most part it brings out the best
of the "homebrew" psyche with only and occasional lapse into the "dark
side" (sorry I just saw Star Wars on the big screen) and has definitely
made a positive impact on my brewing experience.  So, lets all have some
fun!

Hmmm... I think you mean higher-temperature protein rest to encourage
*more* medium-weight proteins, don't you?  Large proteins == haze,
medium proteins == body + head, and amino acids == yeast nutrition (but
in excess can give elevated higher alcohol production and other problems).
Protein rests at the 113-122F end favour amino acid production from
large- and medium-sized proteins and protein rests at the 135-140F end
of the range favour more medium-sized proteins and less amino acids.


There have been posts recently that have said that protein breakdown
is just about non-existent in the mash, but my experience seems to
indicate otherwise.  Perhaps in darker malts, like Vienna and Munich?
I know that a protein rest does a LOT for DeWolf-Cosyns Pale Ale and
Pilsner malts.  You can see it in the quanitity of break produced!


I'm not sure of what mash temps and times are used to make PU... Darryl,
are you still out there?


If Darryl Richman doesn't respond, it may be in his article on Pilsner
Urquell in Zymurgy about 6 or 8 years ago.

I drain the mash tun completely and then refill with sparge water.
I generally recirc my sparge water for 30 mins at 168F while beginning
to boil tthe first runnings. When the first running get boiling, I allow
the mash tun to slowly drain to the kettle (slow enough to not stop the
boil). This has upped my efficency by about 3-4 points and cut 30+ mins

I don't see the disadvantage in too much space under the false bottom,
unless you plan on draining the mash tun completely. This being the 
case, your false bottom must be able to support the weight of the grains.

Subject: Cold Break:  immersion vs. counterflow


HBDers,
I'm switching from an immersion chiiler to a Hart's type super chiller
counterflow unit and have a question:  What happens to the cold break now? 
Instead of falling to the bottom of your boil tun while immersion chilling, will
the cold break now flow into my fermentors?  Is this a problem with CF units?  I
figure the CF unit won't give the break any time to settle like when using an
immersion unit.

Otherwise known as Starchy Strawberry Blonde. In private email, Al points 
out that the process described in Brew Your Own magazine was a surefire way 
to get starch haze. The toasting of malt at 350F for 15-20 minutes will 
destroy most (maybe all) of the enzymes. By the time it gets into the brew, 
by steeping, the only thing to come out will be starch. This is probably why 
it never cleared and may also have contributed to the low FG. Anyway, now 
that we have Victory malt to give the toasty flavor, I use that instead of 
toasting my own.

Hi all,
I posted a request for info on wheat beer and then had to be away for
about a week.  I was surprised by the number of people who responded and
would like to use the digest to thank all who resonded.  All the
responses were useful.  It is obvious that there is a large well
informed group out there.  Nice to have the digest back on line.


In one of the recent digests there was some talk about preventing
boilovers.  I recently acquired a small clip on fan (about 7" diameter)
and removed the front wire screen which acted as a diffuser and safety
screen.  The blades are plastic and not dangerous.  As I use a converted
keg I was able to clip the fan on to the top ring which I left intact
when I cut out the top of the keg.  It works beautifully and ther are no
more boilovers, even with the most vigorous boils.  (I use a cajun type
cooker -around 170,000 BTU).


Also, there was some talk recently about bleach and its effect on SS.  I
have been kegging for quite some time and have used bleach to sanitize
the kegs with no apparent damage.  The insides are mirrorlike and there
is no evidence of pitting (I own 3 coke soda kegs).  I have looked for
iodophor with little success.  Perhaps it's not yet available in Canada.

Subject: how to homebrew sake


Homebrew Sake is very easy to brew using your simple cooking tools
and then you  can enjoy your own Sake taste.


Homebrew Sake,we call 'doburoku', rather haze Sake, had been a culture
of Japan and even under the previously strict control of Liquor Tax law,
some Buddhist temples or Shinto Shrines have been brewing thier own
'doburoku' to serve their festival or ceremony.


Following is  one of the simple Homebrew Sake brewing procedures to
enjoy your own Sake taste.


[Materials]


Rice,1500g(3.3lb)
Kome-koji or rice-koji, 400g(0.9lb)
Citric acid, 5g(0.18oz);you cab eliminate this depending on your taste.
Water,4.2litter(1.1gal)
Dry bread yeast,5g (0.18oz) . Or equivalent amount of Beer Ale yeast,
                Wine yeast,or Wyeast Sake depending on you taste.


You will be able to get Kome-koji made from Koji or Koji-kin, a kind
of white fungi,together with steam cooked rice at your grocery stores
or homebrew stores.
My homebrew friend,Mr.T.Takesima,opened his Koji URL so that
you can get further information on Koji in the USA.


   Koji URL;   http://128.183.126.102/~takeshim/.sub_html/koji.html


   His beer page in Japanese;
         http://128.183.126.102/~takeshim/.sub_html/homebrew.html


If you only can get Koji or Koji-kin, you can easily make your fresh
Kome-koji together with steam cooked rice by yourself using your
picniccooling box. Later I will show you how to make Kome-koji.




[Equipment]


Electric rice cooker(steam cooker is better).
Basket to cut water.
Ten liters(2.6gal) enamel or stainless steel deep cooking pot with lid.
          (Equivalent plastic or glass container can be used.)
Big spoon(stainless is better) .


[Procedure]


1.Wash and soak the 1500g(3.3lb) rice for about five hours and then
      put the rice in a basket for at least 20 min. to cut water.


2.Cook the rice with 1800ml(0.48gal)water using the rice cooker.
      Steam cooking is recommendable for better taste. I used a pressure
      cooker to steam cook rice using stainless steel bastket suspended
      in it.


3.After cooking the rice,cool down the rice to 30deg C(86deg F).


4.Melt the citric acid with 2.4liter(0.5gal) water in the enamel cooking
      pot.
      Citric acid will prevent the contamination of bacteria and add
      slight sour taste to your Sake.
      Depending on your taste, you can reduce or eliminate the Citric acid.
      Also you can use Lactic acid or you can use a Lemon or Lime juice.


5.Add 400g kome-koji and well melt it by agitating with the big spoon.


6.In thirty minutes, add the cooled cooked rice and well mix by agitating
      with the big spoon.


7.Pitch the yeast and place the lid on the pot and keep it at room
      temperautre.
      Lower temperature will cause slower and longer fermentaion and
      will result in better taste.


8.Stir it at least once a day.
      In two or three days you can enjoy very nice Sake aroma.
      Be careful about bacteria contamination. I used 70% ethyl alcohol
      spay around the pot and to myself every time.


9.In two weeks fermentation will seem to end.


10.Filter the sludge using a sterilized basket or cheese cloth. I'm using
      a stainless steel 40mesh screen.


11.Enjoy the filtered Sake. Do not drink too much. Alcohol content is two
      to three times more than beer. Cooling the filtered Sake is the better
      way to taste. If you want crystal clear Sake,separate the further
      sludge by decanting. This will result in great reduction of your Sake
      yield.
      The filtered sake can be matured in your refrigerator at least six
      months for much improved taste.


12.Remaining sludge can be used to cook vegetable pickles in a
      refrigerator.
      A cucumber is the most suitable vegetable. (before use,keep the
      cucumber in a container under two times weight at least 2 days
      after sprinking slight salt (about 2weight% of the cucumber).
      In two or three months,you can get sake taste pickles.
      Of course you can put white fish meat and then grill them.
      If you put soy bean cake (tofu) wrapped with cheese cloths into
      the sludge,in a week you will be able to get cheese like tasty food.




How to make Kome-koji from Koji or Koji-kin


1.Wash and soak the 400g(0.9lb) rice for about five hours and then
     put the rice in a basket for at least 20 min. to cut water.


2.Steam cook the rice. Steam cooked rice looks slightly transparent,
     not white.


3.Cool down the cooked rice to 35deg C(95deg F). Put the rice into an
     enamel or stainless steel thin container and add 1 to 2g of Koji or
     Koji-kin and well mix them. Cover the container with water
     moistened  cheese cloth or cotton cloth to prevent drying.


4.Put the container in a picnic cooling box together with 40deg C(104
     deg F) warm water bottles to keep the inside at 35deg C(95deg F)
     for 40 hours.
     The amount of the warm water will preferably be at least 8 litters
     (2 gal).
     If necessary, change the warm water to keep the temperature constant.
     In 10 hours,mix again the mixture of the cooked rice and Koji using
     a cooking sparula. Already you can notice the whitened rice and get
     good aroma. I used a digital thermometer to measure the temperature
     inside. It is very useful and convenient to keep temperature constant
     without any expensive electrical temperature control device.


5.Further keep the mixture at 35deg C(95deg F) for 30 hours.


6.You can get white colored Kome-koji covered with white fungus.


Of course,you can homebrew your sake only from Kome-koji without
using steam cooked rice. If you can make Kome-koji by yourself,
you can save time and money.


If real "Amasake" is available (sake sludge mixed with suger is not real
amasake),directly pitch dry yeast in a bottle.
Then you can brew your own Sake.


Commercial Sake brewers use very expensive materials such as 50%
polished special kind of rice,which looks like very small crystal beads
because of the excessive polishing process. And the special rice kinds
grown only for Sake are called Yamadanishiki,Miyamanishiki,Reihou,
Gyokuei and so on.
We never eat such a rice, we usually eat slightly polished normal kinds
of rice grown only for eating. When I visited Sake brewer near my house,
the manager told me that he tried to eat that sake rice but that it was
not tasty.


Homebrew Sake is very simple to make and satisfactorily tasty if you do
not compare with commercial high class pure rice Sake. I heard that US
Sake brewers have to produce only pure rice Sake because of US tax law.
Pure Rice Sake means Sake only from rice.
In Japan, tax law allows mixture of so called industrial ethyl alcohol
or other things into Sake within a certain percentage.
Pure rice sake (Junmaishu) is very expensive.




Kampai!
I hope you enjoy homebrew your own Sake.

Hi!
Please if you could help an italian reader of HBD...
I have problems with some words that sometimes my Webster can not help to
solve. While I have been able after a while to understand at least
approximately the meaning, for example,  of "anal retentive",  I think I need a
deeper knowledge at least of the term "skunked" or "skunky" just to be able to
follow the recent thread. Can you describe this flavor/aroma/smell by relating
it to well-known food or chemical examples? Is the term related to a vegetable
or to an animal or whatever? (BTW I had a green-bottled Heineken yesterday, I
don't know if it was skunked but was not an outstanding beer nonetheless IMO.)


Besides, wouldn't be useful for not-so-experienced brewers/drinkers to have
some sort of table describing the most common off (or just particular)
flavours, like DMS, dyacetil etc., a brief description and/or a beer example,
and maybe their cause? Or does such an explanation exist already somewhere in
the WEB?

Was this beer decoction mashed or infusion mashed?  A while ago we were
speculating that the decoctions would cause a reduction in hot break
formation since a lot of the proteins are degraded and/or left behind in the
lauter tun.  The corresponding reduction in hot break would mitigate the
reduction in hop utilization.  I know that in Noonan's 'Brewing Lager Beers'
he recommends adding the bittering hops at the beginning of the boil.

I just recalled seeing this in a small brewery in Bamberg last summer. The
CO2 was piped from the conditioning tanks and allowed to bubble through a
small glass container (<1 liter), and I was of course curious about it. The
guide said that it was for capturing CO2 for force carbonation.
Unfortunately, the rest of the crowd was already tired of me asking
questions all the time and was waiting for the samples, so I didn't ask
what kind of liquid there was in the container. Acid of some sort?

If I'm not mistaken, the unit from Williams has a regulator.  This is not
present on the bike tire fillers (I use one of those on my bikes).
Shooting the entire contents of the Co2 cartridge directly into your keg
will probably not produce the desired results ;-{>

     Howdy,
     
     Soapiness is most often associated with high fermentation 
     temperatures.  I had a great lesson in this when a long-term house 
     guest fermented his beer in a room where the temperature was a very 
     constant 87F (30.5C) (he was more concerned with getting alcohol 
     quickly then with quality).
     
     The resulting brew could have been used to wash out some "poorly 
     spoken" kid's mouth!
     
     Some yeasts will be a bit more forgiving of high temperatures, but 87F 
     is really up there!  It doesn't have to be that warm for the beer to 
     turn soapy tasting.
     
     For what its worth, I sometimes perceive Kent Goldings as being a bit 
     soapy, especially when used for finishing or dry hopping.  Anybody 
     else out there ever sense this?
     
     Have fun!
