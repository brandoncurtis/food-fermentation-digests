Subject: Italian Beer Scene


Just returned from a 10-day tour of Italy & Greece with a high school group
(yikes!), during which I had only minimum opportunity to sample the beer
scene.  I did find that Heineken was invariably fresh and yummy -- the only
time I had ever tasted what it presumedly is "supposed to" taste like, not
skunky as we usually get it here in the US.  Ditto for Grolsch and other
EuroLagers.


My limited experience with the Italian beer availability was this.  Due to
time and mobility limitations I was restricted to beers sold in "bars"
(typically specializing in ice cream and coffee, with a cooler full of
bottled beers off to the side) and an occasional liquor store.  At first I
was drooling at the variety of labels indicating fine European offerings, but
after reading a couple labels, I found that practically every beer offerred
was in the 8 to 12 percent alcohol range!!  Now, mind you, I like a bock or
barleywine every now and then, but I rather had in mind to sit and sip a nice
obscure 4% ABV English ale and taste more beer than alcohol.  Budweiser
pulled up the rear (in more ways than one) with a wimpy 5% rating.  Many of
the beers' labels indicated that the alcohol level was the main attraction
(lotsa "demon" and "devil" themes, and words like "strong" tossed in).


What's up with this?  Aside from the conclusion that Italians drink beer to
get hammered (which I don't think is the case), why couldn't I find more than
a scant few "normal" beers?  Why so many PowerBrews?  Is there some legal or
tax issue here that favors stronger beers?  Just curious.  Kinda bolsters one
of my German friends' answer to my question, "what's the best beer to try
while we're in Italy" -- he said, "wine".


By the way, you Italians (and our Greek hosts as well) have stewardship of
some of mankind's most treasured artistic and cultural achievements -- take
good care of them so we can come back and see them again!!

        The most comprehensive list of laws affecting US brewers is in the "Modern
Brewery Age Blue Book." I have yet to see one,  for they cost around $ 300
US. The "Brewers Resource Directory," from the
 Institute for Brewing Studie" is quite good, with most of the essential
 info, for about $ 80 US, I think.  Federal details may be obtained from
the BATF, Washington, DC, 20226.
         FWIW, the best place for US brewers to start is the Institute for
Brewing Studies. They have been enormously helpful to me and the Little
Apple.  Currently, I am working on a legislative change concerning beer for
festivals, and they have greatly aided me. Members of the IBS can also post
on the IBS Forum, and get more direct info from brewers who are up and
running. (We also get to vote for Board Members.)

Subject: Dropping vs Secondary Fermentation


Second posting - Any takers?


Bruce DeBolt writes re. Dropping question, again


>Has anyone dropped half of their fermenting wort, left the rest behind
>and then compared the two after bottling?


Sorry, no I haven't.  But I would like to open this dropping thread a 
little.  My understanding is that the process of dropping involves 
transferring fermenting wort from the primary fermenter to a second vessel 
very shortly after it starts to krausen - a one or two days after start? 
 The reason for doing this is to leave behind trub etc. that gets floated 
up with the krausen and trub that sediments to the bottom of the fermenter. 
 Once in the second fermenter, the wort is very much cleaner and still 
contains very actively working yeast.


Now, there is another practice which sometimes accompanies this process. 
 Sometimes the wort is allowed to be aerated as it's transferred to the 
second fermenter.  The purpose of this is to encourage yeast growth in the 
second fermenter presumably to ensure that the wort develops another 
protective layer of yeast on the surface.


A similar end result to the practise of dropping is attempted by skimming 
the yeast head off the wort as soon as it appears.  However, I have never 
managed to removed all the nasty looking stuff from the yeast head and this 
still doesn't get over the removal of the wort from the sedimented trub. 
 It also doesn't address the option of aerating.  My local brewery skims 
the head as soon as it appears and at the same time "rouses" the yeast 
presumably in an attempt to encourage yeast activity and or growth.


I've deliberately not used the term secondary fermentation here.  My 
understanding is that when one adopts the practise of allowing fermentation 
activity to continue until the yeast head starts to subside before 
transferring to another vessel, this is what is referred to as primary and 
secondary fermentation (the secondary taking place in the second 
container).  The only other alternative (practised by AlK amongst others I 
believe) is to let the fermentation continue to a finish in the same single 
container.


Is it not true therefore, that the only difference between dropping and 
using secondary fermentation is when you do the transferring?  Or is it 
still permissible to use a third container for doing secondary fermentation 
with wort that has been dropped?  Or is this Tertiary fermentation?

Hear! Hear!  I am sick to death of those who always try to take the
moral high ground on the HBD and other lists.  Read or don't read.
It is your choice alone.  One good thing about flame wars is that 
you learn a little bit more about the posters themselves, the Als and 
the Daves.  Its nice to know when you post whether you are responding         
to a pompous ass, a vindictive spiteful weenie, a gentleman or

Subject: vigorous evaporation


This weekend I started my boil outside on a propane cooker with ~6.5
gallons of wort.  90 minutes later I ended up with significantly < 4
gallons.  This is an evaporation rate of a little less than 1 gallon per
half hour!  This seems awfully high compared to what I've read in homebrew
books and here on the digest.  I realize that a vigorous boil is good for
things like hop utilization and hot break formation, but is such a violent
boil really necessary or is a rolling boil that moves things around good
enough?  This may seem like a silly question, but I have my reasons for
not "wasting" water to evaporation if I don't have to.  For one, my tap
water is basically unfit for brewing (smells like chlorine half the time
and is extremely hard) so I have to get water from other sources. 
Secondly, concentrating my wort so much makes the wort left in the brewpot
(always a sad site to see wort who's potential will never be reached) all
the more precious, along with rasing the likelihood of unwanted
caramelization/darkening and the like.  So, all you propane spewing
homebrewers out there, do you boil like mad and get a high evaporation
rate, or do you "tone down" the boil and still get nice utilization/hot
break?  Is there a point of  "enough is enough" in the boil?  I know I
could experiment with a few brews and different boil vigorosities (take
that, Mr. Webster!), but as I only brew once a month I'd rather poll the
homebrew collective and see what bits of wisdom I can get first.  And
anway, its been a while since I asked a question. :)

Subject: Counterflow chiller and trub removal / warming beer


     Hi all,
     
     There have been a few people asking about cold break removal, 
     especially when using counterflow chillers.  I find that this is one 
     of the disadvantages of CF chillers; complete trub removal by 
     whirlpooling is more easily done when using an immersion chiller.
     
     I have had good results removing cold break by using a trub sack.  I 
     use small cotton bags (homemade).  I boil a bag, stuff it inside the 
     neck of the fermenter, and run the wort from the chiller through it.  
     I have to run the wort slowly (~12 gallons/hour) to avoid overflow, 
     but it will catch the cold break.
     
     I have tried using other materials, such as hop bags and cheesecloth, 
     but they were way too coarse.  Cotton T-shirts work well.  I never use 
     soap or detergents to clean trub sacks.
     ----------------------
     Tim wrote in asking about microwaving beer to warm it to serving 
     temperature.  A far easier, and probably faster method, is to place 
     the unopened bottle of beer into a small container of hot water.  
     Count to 10.  If you used really hot water, it will be at ~55F.
     
     It is very easy to over-warm the beer this way, but with a little 
     experience you will be serving all your of bottled nectar at 
     appropriate temperatures.
     
     Have fun!

I will go one further.  You had better make it easy enough so that you
can take it apart after EVERY brew and clean it.  While still hot, a
nylon kitchen brush and hot water will get this tan crud off very
easily.  Left to dry it will eventually turn to the black carbonized
crud.  And if it does not dry between brews, it can even rot on you.
This is how I discovered that the elements need to be cleaned after
every brew.  God, what a stench!!  Hope to save someone else the

OK, now to one of my pet peeves.  Sorry to Mike Szwaya, I am not
picking on you personally, but I just gotta say this.  


I cannot understand why some people take really critical parts of a
RIMS design and try to make them "on the cheap".  A plastic heater
chamber is an extreme example of this.  Combining a heat source with
plastic and water is a disaster waiting to happen.  A simple error
like running the chamber dry, or turning off the pump can result in a
meltdown and very likely dump liquid and now you have a liquid and
electricity danger.  And you have a high likelihood of electrocuting
yourself.  Did you possibly scrimp and not buy a GFCI to protect
yourself?  This is pennywise and poundfoolish thinking.

the kettle will give a cooling rate much faster than an immersion 
chiller (without the need for physical agitation and its associated 
danger of HSA) but not as fast as the straight cf chiller.


In terms of cold break formation, according to my current limited
understanding, you will get the same amount of break material 
recirculating back into the kettle or straight into the fermenter. 
As far as I know (and I am certainly willing to be re-educated), since 
I am not talking about reboiling the wort, we can treat the cold 
break as "BOOPs" (Break Only Once Proteins). The coagulated proteins 
which fall out of solution in the cf chiller will not significantly 
redissolve once returned to the warmer wort. Just as Hot Break doesn't 
redissolve after chilling. (chemists please excuse my mixed and
probably improper use of "dissolve" for proteins in solution).


I don't really understand your statement concerning the "bacteriologic 
hazard" unless perhaps your assuming that a slower cooling of the wort 
provides a greater chance for thermophilic bacteria to take up shop. In 
which case I would say that the chance is less than it would be with an 
immersion chiller. I really don't think that the rate of chilling would 
be that much less, maybe on the order of 5 minutes for a 5 gallon batch. 
And an added 5 minute chilling on brew day seems a much better AND safer 
option than syphoning wort to a temporary fermenter and then syphoning 
again to get it off the settled break material.


With leaf hops providing a filter bed, this would allow for the prevention 
of carry-over of MOST break material. Obviously some would be transferred 
to the fermenter and thats fine, I want some for yeast metabolism and 
nucleation points for CO2 release. I don't want too much because of the 
POTENTIAL (all caps because I recognize that this is an unsettled issue) 
of its adverse impact on clarity(?), stability(?), off-tastes(?) etc. Also 
by decreasing the amount of trub in the primary, I am decreasing the amount 
of beer I lose when syphoning.

As long as you make a starter, it will probably be ok. You might want to give
it an extra day to get going though.


Check the date stamped on the foil package. WYeast that is only a month or so
old can puff up in a day or two. If it is several months (3-4) old it can take
a while. I believe WYeast has a shelf life of at least 4 months if
refrigerated.

  I do have Wheeler and Protz recipe from "Brew Classic European Beers at

What yeast would one use?
Can you culture yeast from a bottle of "Tres Monts" and if so is it the yeast

Subject: re: brian deck: yeast culture...(February 22, 1997)


i'm not sure, but from my memory of microbiology courses, what may be
happening is that by starting your yeast in a non-simple sugar medium
you may be activating late-phase enzymes early, and de-activating
early-phase enzymes.  bear in mind that there is _no_ way to 100%
sterilize anything (spores, for instance, resist chlorine and temperatures
up to ~120 C (~240F)).  what this means is that instead of quickly getting
a high alcohol content (inhibiting nasty bacteria/fungi) and then slowly
breaking down other molecules (the mellowing process), you are instead
taking 24h to re-start the alcoholization, during which time spores can
"hatch" and start to skunk your beer.  meanwhile the yeast will begin to
produce alcohol, quickly inhibiting further growth of the nasties.  net
result is an off flavour, as opposed to a full skunk.  


the only problem with this explanation is it does not account for why your
earlier batches were OK.


this is just a thought, not a stone-set truth.  if no-one else has a
better explanation, try just using a simple sugar starter medium with your
next batch and seeing what happens.

I work in a lab also and have started culturing my own brewing yeast. 
I havn't had any problems yet, but I havn't been doing it for too long 
either.  I do have one suggestion though.  If the problem is, as you 
suggest it might be, a change in the yeasts ability to ferment 
"correctly", it may be due to the medium it is being propagated in.  
If it's being grown generation after generation on peptone and 
glucose, it might lose it's preference or it's ability to ferment 
maltose.  I suggest adding some malt extract to your propagation 
medium.  In my work I use YMDA (yeast malt dextrose agar) to propagate 
yeast (for work(not yeast you would want to brew with), as well as for my
own brewing).  The recipe is 3 g yeast extract, 3 g malt extract, 5 g peptone, 
5 g dextrose (corn sugar), and 18 g agar per liter.  You can make a broth with 
the same recipe, minus the agar.  


However, I think that selection should only be a problem if you are 
indeed growing generation after generation on non-malt medium.  If 
you're only propagating them once or twice before using them, and are 
recovering them from the fermenter to replenish your supply, it 
shouldn't be a problem (IMHO).  I think that they would need several
generations of exposure to other nutrients for selection to occur.


Anyways, writing this now made me think that maybe I'll start using 
only malt extract as a nutrient source for my brewing yeasts, to 
prevent any type of selection toward other nutrient preferences.


Hope this is helpful

I don't think I understand this AHA thing.


I work for a public agency (water/electric utility).  We are governed by a
Board of Directors (elected by customers/registered voters) and run by
a general manager appointed by, and accountable to, the board.


I own some stock in a private corporation.  That company is also

The professional association I belong to and hell, even my hombrew club,

The AHA on the other hand is run by a self-appointed president who
supposedly answers to a Board of Directors.  I do know that as a
member, I never had any say in the make-up of this board.  Since the
AHA doesn't see fit to disclose just how this board is made up, we'll
have to assume that they are invited to serve by Charlie or his staff. 
And that takes just about all of the wind out of the AHA's assertion that
the president serves only at the pleasure of the board.


I can't seem to think of any type of body that operates under this model. 
It seems that for all of the efforts of the AHA to convince us that they are
legit, all they ultimately understand is the almighty buck.  And that, after
all, is the only vote that we have.  Don't pay the "dues", don't buy the

I believe that in terms of "extract," i.e. SG points, it will be
pretty similar except for the very pale (colour < ~5L) crystal malts.
Regarding the fermentabilty, I believe that if you are mashing at
the cooler end of the range (i.e. 150-ish F), I believe that you get
a *slightly* more fermentable wort if you mash rather than steeping
because of the activity of beta amylase on the dextrins in the crystal
malts.  I say "slightly" above because in my experience, I have reason
that not all of the unfermentables in crystal malts are able to be
broken down by beta amylase.  This is pretty much speculation, on my
part, however, since I have not done side-by-side comparisons.


>If you want to get very particular, then the question to answer is,
>can I get away with mashing only the base malts and then steeping
>the specialty grains and malts?


Yes, except for the vary pale crystal malts and "specialty grains"
that contain starch (i.e. if you consider flaked barley a "specialty
grain") you can certainly do what you propose and many homebrewers
have done this (no comercial brewers that I know of, however).

As I said before, the fermentabilty would be slightly different if
you were mashing at the cool end of the amylase range, but it would
not make *radically* different beer, if that's what you are asking.


Back in 1988 or 1989, I asked Dr. George Fix about this exact point
(more specifically, I asked if mashing crystal would break down
a lot of the dextrins we typically seek from crystal malts)... his
response was that he uses the crystal malts for their flavour contribution
and that he controls fermentability (i.e dextrin content) of the resulting
wort by choosing appropriate mash temperatures, so he adds all the malts
together at the beginning of the mash.


In my own brewing, I too have always done this.

Subject: co2 pressure  in primary


Greetings all,


I often use a blow-off setup in beginning fermentation
and noticed something interesting last week.  After the
lag phase I could regulate how much bubbling, if any, 
occurred by raising or lowering the tube end inside the
blow-off container.  I assume this is due to the amount 
of water pressure in contrast to the co2 pressure coming
from the fermenter.  Of course, when fermentation really
got going, it didn't appear to make alot of difference.  (I never
got around to switching to an airlock.)  Then, a few days later 
I could control the bubbling again.  It seems  that the gas in 
the tubing pushes to point X in relation to the depth of the 
blowoff water. The question that I could not answer was this:


Is it better to raise the end of the tubing to allow gases to 
escape and minimize pressure in the fermenter, or is it
better to lower the tubing end and prevent bubbling to
keep the gases in the fermenter,  or does it matter at all ???


Yes, I know that switching to an airlock would prevent the
question from coming up at all.  I thought this might be an
interesting topic for discussion: maximum pressure inside
fermenter vs. minimum pressure inside fermenter.

I've found a reference that may explain why skunking may be less of a point
during brewing:


"Since malt, adjuncts, and hops all contain volatile mercaptans, it is not
suprising to find that brewers' wort also has measureable amounts of these
compounds.  The few samples of wort analyzed had mercaptan levels that were
rational on the basis of the brewing materials used.  The mercaptan level
decreased during fermentation, and increased during primary and secondary
storage."  -- "Determination of Volatile Sulfur Compounds  IV  Further
  Notes on Mercaptans" by M.W.Brenner, J.L.Owades, and T. Fazio, A.S.B.C.
  Proceedings, 1955.


Note that this is *not* an article on lightstruck beer, although it is
mentioned (and there is a reference to the 1954 Proceedings and says
that "'lightstruck' beer, whose odor was recently shown to be due to
mercaptans."), but rather an article on mercaptan formation and reduction
in "non-irradiated" beer (the authors' expression).


My point is, however, that perhaps yeast activity during fermentation
will reduce light-induced mercaptans (during the boil, runoff, etc) as
well, no?

This doesn't explain my experience with Newcastle Brown Ale or the other

Much easier: two bottles of PU (or Heineken... heck... BUD!), taken from a
sealed (and therefore dark) case.  One stored dark, the other put on on
sunny window ledge for a day (better do two for the Bud -- brown bottles).
Next, open, pour, sniff...  simple.


It probably doesn't take a day... I read in Brewing Science this weekend
that it only takes a few hours in sunlight and a few days under fluorescent
light, but I want to make *darned* sure you smell the difference.


Really, Dave, no offense meant, but... put away the photochemistry texts
and try this experiment.  I'm sure we'll agree then.  Perhaps try four
bottles (two dark, two sunny, two smelled after a day, two after a month
at 50F in the dark) and kill two birds with one sixpack.

Actually what you saw was an airlock for a professional brewery.  We use

<what kind of liquid there was in the container. Acid of some sort?


Nope, just water.  Recycling of CO2 does not become cost effective until
the production reaches about 60K BBLs/yr.  That is where the cost reduction
of the price of CO2 starts to recoup the investment in equipment.  Small
Bamberg braueries are too small to do this economically.  The device you
saw is used to spund the tank when the redidual sugars are low enough
to generate carbonation in the tank.  Standard lager/unitank technique.
This technique, BTW, does meet Reinheitsgebot, which merely mandates
that the CO2 be produced from the brewery itself.  Spunding meets this
as does using previously saved/recycled CO2 while bottled gas does not
meet this standard.

British ale malt will provide color enough to go with the UK Crystal.
Dont forget to dry hop at 1/4 oz per 5 gals.  Also to get the true

Now, this lounge owns this equipment, but mysteriously all the old crappy

system.
