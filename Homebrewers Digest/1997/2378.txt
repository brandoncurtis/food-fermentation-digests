Subject: Hop Rhizomes




I noticed the recent discussion on Hops.  I am interested in planting some      
Hops later this year when I return to the United States.  I am wondering a      
couple of things.                                                               
  1.  What types of Hops will grow well in the metropolitan Detroit area?       
  2.  What can you use these hops for?  Strictly flavor and aroma? since you    
      can not calculate AA %.                                                   
  3.  What time of year is the right time to plant the hops?  I need to know    
      if I should order them before returning to the states or not.             
If the second point is true, then I guess that I will have to decide what       
type of hop I prefer to use for this purpose and what will thrive in Michigan.  
I have done some brewing here in Germany.  Supplies are somewhat available.     
But, I look forward to getting back to America and getting a recharge on my     
brewing enthusiasm from the F.O.R.D. Club.                                      
TIA for your help in sorting out my problems.

I've completed my corny keg system and am trying to find an easy way to
serve cold beer away from the home.  I recall the "cold plate and igloo
cooler" dispensing systems from my college days and thought this might be
the way to go.  I assume they are still used and available.  Does anyone
know of a source for the cold plate, since it would be easy enough to make
up the cooler system once a plate is acquired?


I know I could probably work one up by using 25 feet of copper tubing, etc.
however the plate would be more convenient and possibly easier to clean.


Thanks in advance.

I am planning to brew an imperial stout, but I need some help and guidlines.
I understand that it needs to age for a long time(6-12 months). Is it best to
age in a glass fermenter, or is it best to bottle and let age in that? What
about the actual brewing, anything that I need to know or do different. I am

Subject: HSA question


HBD'ers,


I have a question that arises after completing my 3 vessel system and 
brewing with it for only one batch. I use gravity to drain the sparge 
liquid into the boiling kettle. Realizing that this liquid is above 
the desirable temperatures to avoid HSA, one would think it best not 
to add air whilst moving it around. 


I had a problem, not big one thank goodness, where during the sparge 
with a piece of flexible tubing connected to the outlet of the mash 
tun that eventually backed up to the top of the tube and slowed the 
sparge flow to nothing. There is probably several ways to avoid this 
but it brought a question to my feeble mind. Wouldn't boiling (which 
is the next step) remove the air from the wort thus negating the 
effects of introducing air to the fresh wort in the first place? 


I would be interested to hear some opinions or even scientific 
explanations. I have read with curiosity how some folks just do it, 
let it pour that is, and some go to great lengths to prevent it. I 
have done it both ways in the past with no seeming ill effects. Can 
this be explained? 


Thanks for all the help that I received while building  my system 
from all who responded to my questions. The system works like a dream 
and I couldn't have expected it to work any better. For those who 
might be interested, it is a 3 vessel converted keg system using a 
recirculating method. The recirc goes through a coil which is built 
into the sparge tank. I can get temp increases through the coil in 
excellent time. Singular data point, first batch, 104 - 140 in about 
15 minutes. The delta temp between mash inlet and outlet was never 
greater than 6 degrees. System provided 33 pts/lb/gal. Gotta like it!


Look forward to hearing some info on the HSA thing.






Cheers,


Bill

A *LOT* of people I know, including myself, sparge with boiling 
water.  'Tis true that sparge temps should be kept around 170dF, but 
after being sprinkled through the air out of my rotating sparge arm, 
the water is significantly cooled.  I have measured the temp of the 
grain bed during the sparge and it has never been significantly over 
170dF.

We have a used restaurant supply store here in Charlotte that has
corny kegs for $5 and 20# CO2 tanks for $25 (plus about $10 to
recertify them if necessary).  It is basically a junk yard that
specializes in restaurant equipment.  It can be a gold mine for

Subject: recipe request - lemon lager


While visiting Portland on vacation, I tasted a number of yummy beers, but
one rather unusual one piqued my fancy. I had a Saxer Lemon Lager and really
enjoyed it. Later (in Yakima, Washington) I tried to pick up a six of the
stuff, and couldn't find the same brand. They had something else, and
something called Lemon Jack. The Lemon Jack (featuring a yellow jacket with
an eyepatch) tasted like "Champale does hard lemonade" and it was thrown out. 


I just searched Cats Meow, and although it had a fairly high number of hits,
only one appeared to be a beer that used lemon as an ingredient. I am
baffled why a number of them were "hit" with "lemon" because I couldn't find
lemon in the recipe or description anywhere. The one hit was a tribute to
Pete's Summer Ale, with a "hint" of lemon. I'd like to duplicate the In Your
Face lemon I got from the lemon lager. 


Help, anyone?

Glad to hear you're happy with this great style.  I used corn meal in
January and it worked fine, although some of it ended up under the false
bottom, causing no problem.  It is finer by a good bit than brewing grits.
I'd suggest using the cereal cooker mash like the big boys do, and as I
did.  Add 10-25% crushed malt and rest it at saccharification temperatures
for a bit, then boost it and cook it for 45-60 minutes.  The malt helps
avoid a huge lump, as does using enough water.  Meanwhile, about 15-30
minutes before you're done boiling the cereal mash, mash in the balance of
the malt for a protein rest.  That way you don't overdo that step waiting
for the corn to cook.  Then add the cereal mash, which just might boost the
main mash temperature to where you want it.  Keep boiling and cold water on
hand to adjust, and proceed as usual.


You are getting great conversion if you got five gallons at 1.058 from 9
lbs. of grain.  I trust you know that your first recipe was 22% corn and
this second one is nearly 30% and that this is intentional.


I recently special ordered brewers grits and got "Briess Insta Grains (R)
IYCG Yellow Corn Grit (Instantized)."  This cost about half of what flaked
maize cost.  I called Briess to make sure that "Instantized" meant
pre-gelatinized, and that they could go straight into the mash without
cooking, and was told it did.  Our club split the bag and at least one
brewer had no trouble.  However, I want to cook anyway for possible flavor
changes, so I will.  It turns out that they came from Briess's food
division not the brewing.  I suppose they may just be grits like they eat
down where they say "you-all."


I hope you will enter this brew in some competitions.  It is recognized as
a style now in the category "Classic Pilsner" along with German and
Bohemian Pilsners, but we need to enter to keep it.

Jeff Renner wrote:


Addendum:  After posting the above and cc'ing John, he
replied wondering if
this meant that the mash time was more critical than he had
thought.  I
hadn't thought about this aspect.  I usually mash 1-2
hours, but used to do
overnight mashes in the oven with no apparent
overconversion.  Any thoughts
from the readership?  Is wort stabilization more
theoretical than real.  Is
a 1-2 hour mash effectively stabilzed?


I don't think that the mash length results in over
conversion.  My mash time is typically around 1.5 hours,
because I am boiling, cooling, and reheating my sparge
water at the same time.  I have found no particular
difference between 1, 1.5, and 3 hour mashes.  Converted is
converted, at least in my modest experience.


I have experimented a bit with lower temperature sparges
(i.e. no mashout), and found that the effect was lower
extraction efficiency without creating a particularly dry
beer.  I concluded that mashout was optional, as long as I
accounted for the slightly reduced efficiency.  


Conversely, I also have found that I can increase
efficiency by mashing out at 168F and sparging at 175F
without releasing excessive tannins, if I keep my ph real
low (<=5.0).  This has become my standard practice although
more by habit than anything.

Subject: Clogged EZ-Masher screen


I just caught up on reading some previous digests and came across two recent
posts:  one from Paul S. in #2371 and another from Craig Rode in #2373 --
both talking about problems with the screen on the EZ-Masher (TM) getting
clogged with grain and adjunct materials and slowing down the sparge 
process.  Well, I, too, am a happy customer of the EZ-Masher and have
been brewing all-grain batches with it since July '96, and noticed some
slowing of my sparges, particularly right after doing an Oatmeal Stout
around Christmas this past Dec.   I thought that I had been doing a fairly
thorough job of cleaning it each time, but when I finally got around
to disassembling the whole thing prior to a no-sparge demonstration for
our brew-club this weekend, I realized that the screen was VERY clogged.
My solution was to soak it in a washing soda (sodium carbonate) solution for
about a half hour, then scrubbed it with an OLD toothbrush that I use to
clean my grain mill rollers.  The best method seemed to be to push the 
bristles, rather than scrub, because the bristles would go through the screen

I too believe that mashout is pretty much to reduce viscosity and not to
do anything to the enzymes.  I believe that Malting and Brewing Science
says that beta-amylase denatures after 2 hours at 150F.  So, we have one
of three scenarios: 


1. we want a fermentable wort with few dextrins,
2. we want a dextrinous wort with low fermentability, or
3. we want something in between.


If 1, then we mash at, say, 150F for two hours.  If any enzymes are still
active after two hours, well, then we welcome them to keep munching because,
after all, we wanted a fermentatble wort, didn't we?


If 2, then we mash at, say, 158F for an hour or so.  I'm quite certain that
there will be virtually no beta-amylase still active after 20 min and if
the alpha-amylase is still active, it probably means that there is still
some starch left (well, it is possible for alpha amylase to cut some links
such that there a fermentable sugar is produced, but statistically this
is a far smaller effect on the fermentability than the action of beta-
amylase).  A mashout would only be denaturing alpha-amylase whose continued
action would affect fermentability very little if at all.


If 3, then, well, presumably, we have chosen the temperature such that
all the beta-amylase will poop-out sometime during the mash... that's why
this wort will *not* be "highly fermentable."  Therefore, only alpha-amylase
remains to be be denatured by the mashout (see "If 2" above).




So, that brings us back to: mashout is unlikely to have any "stabilizing"
effect on the fermentability.  I think that long ago, someone made a
presumption about this effect of mashout and never really thought it through.
I know that even professional texts say that mashout (even the boil)
deactivates enzymes, but consider the three scenarios and see if you can
suggest a case where mashout would really be important for determining
the fermentability of the wort.  I don't think such a case exists.

Subject: American classic pilsner


In HBD #2377 Russ Brodeur asks about corn grits


I made my first attempt at Jeff Renner's American Classic Pilsner three
weeks ago and I used corn grits, the coarsest I could find, which was a
polenta grind from the local health food co-op.  A good deal at $0.50
per pound verus $2.00/lb. for flaked maize at the brewstore.  I used a
4:1 water:grits to cook and thought it came out very thick, next time
I'll go 8:1.  It spooned out thickly like, well polenta, or mashed
potatoes but broke up and mixed in well enough when I stirred  it in at
mashin.


One trick I've heard of that I didn't do this time is to add about a
pound of your base malt to the grits when cooking and hold for a
mini-rest at about 150-158 to liquify the existing free starch.  The
bulk of your corn starch doesn't gelatinize until about 180+ degrees or
higher, where amalases will have long since denatured, but supposedly
this still helps.  I stuck the cereal pot in a pressure canner to cook
it all quickly and evenly, for about fifteen minutes at 15lbs.  If
cooking it on a stovetop I'd just bring it to boil and stirr
occassionally until it tasted nicely cooked.  Mailllard reaction?


The wort was very sweet with a light pleasant sweet corn note, not
objectionable.  I haven't tried the resulting beer yet but I think
already that I'll develop the recipe for a beer that my american-beer
drinking friends will also enjoy.  It's certainly the cheapest beer I've
ever made.  I'm also considering mashing with hominy grits at least once
to see where the flavor goes.  Might possibly be good in a rye beer if
used with a light touch.

Minor nit, but US whisky mfgrs don't even sparge till much later, but
pitch or add a 'holdback' right onto the hot thin mash, where it
ferments and continues to mash simultaneously.

In practice beta-amylase(BA) is significantly inactivated by the end
of conversion in a mash hotter than 150F.  Alpha-amylase(AA) is a bit
more heat stabile, but it will have a limited half-life in hotter
mashes.  Exactly how much and how fast is dependent on a wide array of
conditions for these two enzymes.  If you are doing an overnight mash
at say 154F, you can count on the BA dissappearing/diminishing on cue,
but the AA may continue to operate much of the night.


AA breaks 1-4 glucose bonds - but in some branched dextrins of the
sort remaining in wort, the AA molecule cannot geometrically arrange
to get it's 'working end' or functional site in place to break the 1-4
bond.  AA is also more likely to break the middle than the end bonds
of a long-chain polysaccharide.


In practice this means that AA will break more long chain
polysaccharides into small ones rather than breaking dextrins and di-
and tri-saccharides - tho' it measurably does both. AA will not be
able to decompose certain branched dextrins at all, but will certinaly
degrade others.  This last justifies mashout after conversion IMO.

Subject: Gravity change equations, HBD 2375




Seems like you're on the right track.
Mass transfer (in this case transfer of sugars into
a mobile water phase) is a first order process
and the integration of a first order
decay equation (rate proportional to 1/[concentration])
gives an exponential concentration decay curve.  Gravity is
of course a measure of sugar concentration.


But your analysis implies the assumption that 
the mash is continuously and perfectly mixed,
i.e. the sugar concentration throughout the mash is
constant.


In practice this is not the case with homebrew sized mashes.  The first
part of the run off will be at a constant high gravity until the sparge
water passes throught the mash bed and starts to reach the collection
manifold.  (We chemical engineers describe this type of fluid flow as
'plug flow' as each little packet of fluid passes through as a separate
'plug' with no 'back-mixing'.  Chanelling can mess this flow regime up). 


Once the sparge water front, now containing some sugar reaches the
bottom of the mash the gravity if collected wort will at first drop
rapidly to a level determined by how well this sparge water is rinsing
residual sugars from the mash.


A first order decay process such as that you describe will then occur.  (I
think!)  Unfortunately the actual rate of decay of the wort gravity will
depend on mass transfer coefficients, lauter tun geometry and global and
local flowrates so a definitive equation will be hard to derive. 


So, I envisage an initial plateau in the gravity
followed by a sudden drop then a gradual decay.


A model of this type should be around in chemical engineering
literature but the collection of data to produce an actual
predictive equation would require some experimentation.
Maybe we should all collect a data set (wort gravity vs. time,
imagine cooling all those samples for the hydrometer..)


Way to chemical engineer though!

Subject: Comments and questions...


Hi,


I'm new to HBD since Dec of 96 (I wonder how many of us ended up here as a
result of receiving the $69 plastic bucket and carboy beer kit for Xmas).
My wife thinks she has created a monster.  Hmmmmm...... I wonder why?  


I started out with a stainless stock pot on the electric stove in the
kitchen, fermented in the closet or garage, and bottled when the beer was
done.  Maybe I did get the fever.  In less than 3 months, I have converted a
couple of kegs (stainless ball-valves... also plumbed for a permenant
thermometer to be added later) in anticipation of going all grain 10 gal
batches soon.  Because I have a 1/2" NPT nipple welded in, will I need to
build my own EM screen or can I buy just that part somewhere?   


Five gallons doesn't last long enough to get really good.  Everytime someone
comes over, we end up sampling, and while it is not bad, it never has time
to condition and get really good until I'm down to my last 1 or 2 bottles
which taste great.  I guess I need to brew harder, longer, and more at a time!


Now I am garage brewing on a propane cooker, and have also recently finished
procuring everything necessary for kegging (two ball-lock corney kegs, and
the C02 bottle, but only have 1 set of hoses so far).  I hope to find a 3 or
4 valve manifold with individual shutoffs to mount inside the old fridge so
I run 2 or 3 kegs at a time with a single CO2 line into it from the outside.
Any ideas where I can find one reasonably priced?  I think I've made pretty
good progress in only 3 months....  I must admit I've learned a lot just
lurking here!


Here are a couple more questions:


1.  I have cleaned my kegs first by soaking overnight with a cup of vinegar
and hot water (disassembled dip tubes/connections soaked them separately).
Then I rinsed and soaked for sereral hours with baking soda.  I rinsed the
baking soda and checked them several hours later, to discover that the pop
smell was just as strong as before I started cleaning them.  I think one of
them previously contained Sprite, and the other had Dr.Pepper in it.  The
one with Dr.Pepper had kind of a carbonated odor in it that stung my nasal
passages when I smelled it.  I have since moved them outside with the tops
off for a couple of days, and they smell ok now, but I'm afraid as soon as I
close them up again the smell will come back.  What should I try next?  I
have a lager in the garage now that is ready to keg.


Oh.... Also I read somewhere that when I keg my beer I need to add spraymalt
or sugar... I use corn sugar in bottling, but if I am carbonating with C02
in the keg, do I still need to add sugar?


2.  My next question is about yeast.... one of the biggest problems I've had
so far is getting fermentation to start in a reasonable amount of time.
I've had problems 4 out of 7 times with very slow starts (I had to dump 5
gal. after a stuck fermentation that I tried repitching several times).  I
think maybe I've been doing something wrong, or shocking the yeast when I
pitch it.  I have only used dry yeast so far, but I imagine the same applies
to smack-packs.  I understand that the yeast can be shocked in the wort if
the temperature changes more than 8 degrees or so in a single day.  Is
pitching time any different in regard to shocking the yeast?  If I rehydrate
the yeast in a sterilized cup with boiled water cooled to 40 to 45
centigrade (104 to 115 degrees farenheit), wait 10 minutes or so then stir
before pitching, is it a shock to the yeast to pitch it into wort that is 65
to 70 degrees farenheit?  Should I wait until they are the same temperature?
There is even a greater difference going from 104 to 115 degrees rehydrating
the yeast to 50 degree farenheit lagering temperatures in the garage.  Any
advice?


3.  One last question.... I strain the cooled wort with a funnel and
strainer as I pour it into the carboy.  With someone else's help, I cover
the clean carboy top with a piece of plastic wrap, hold it in place with one
hand over the top, and shake it to try and aerate the wort.  Should I shake
it before I pitch the yeast, or does it matter? Also, would it be better to
shake the carboy a little before it is completely full (while there is more
air in the headspace), then fill it the rest of the way and shake again?
suggestions?


Any advice or answers to my questions would be greatly appreciated.

whole hop flowers and I think this helps in a beer like a pils.  Lots
of essential oils from all the hops.  All I can divulge is that the
beer is made with a rediculous quantity of hops added in several 
additions including FWH.  A hopback is used and the beer is not dry
hopped as this tends to impart different hop character than what most
look for in a German pils.  I really enjoy this beer when served in
the slow pour fashion as done in much of Germany, it takes about 12 minutes
to pour and decarbonates the beer a tad but the wispy creamy head that

Russ Brodeur asks about using corn meal instead of flaked maize in a 
American pilsner recipe.


I would advise against it, because of the oil content of the corn 
meal.  When American brewers first experimented with  corn they did 
use corn meal, but suffered from head retention and stability 
problems because of the oil in the corn meal.  Instead of corn meal, 
I'd use corn grits.  When you do the cereal mash, don't forget to add 
the 10% of the malt to the cereal mash.  This is essential for 
liquifying the starch: the one time I neglected this I burned the 
grits rather badly.  Smoked pre-prohibition pils, anybody?


Another idea would be to use corn starch.  This ought to be boiled to 
gelatinize it as well, but I've just added it to the mash, at the 
cost of lowered extraction and some chill haze.


Whatever you do, don't try using instant potatoes for that Oh Spud! 
Potato Pilsner.  Even with rice hulls, the mash sticks remarkably.
