You can get degerminated corn meal, which has no oil and works just fine.
Use the cereral cooker method.  Cook the corn with 20-25% crushed malt.


If you can't get degerminated corn meal then use rice in the same manner as
you would the corn.  Gets you to the same place with a cleaner crisper beer.

Subject: Cold plates and CO2 tank distribution


Eddie Kent asks about running multiple kegs from 1 CO2 tank for a wedding       
and Mark Snyder ask about cold plates.                                          


2 birds with one stone, oh happy day!  One of the greates resources for         
kegging homebrewers is a Restaraunt and Bar WHOLESALER that does mail           
order business and loves homebrewers.  I'm talking about a company called       
Rapids (1-800-4-rapid-1) with several locations throughout the U.S.  They       
advertise in one or two of the homebrew magazines and their prices can't        
be beat.  Call and ask for their BEER catalog, it is just 39 pages chock        
full of draught equipment.  They carry 2 sizes of cold plates with 2,3,         
or 4 lines each.  They carry a variety of CO2 Distribution Maniolds             
(i.e. splitters) inclusing a plastic modular unit that lets you add on          
as many lines as you need.  This is a homebrewers best friend for draught       
equipment.  That being said I would also get a catalog from Superior            
Products (800-328-9800) as their prices on SOME items can be better and         
the product line is a little different between the two catalogs (no             
affiliation with either blah blah blah)                                         


As far as beer for a wedding, brew up a nice Pale Ale and name it Bridal Veil   
Pale Ale and make a tap handle out of a bride and groom doll (caketop)!         


Good luck and brew on!

Subject: hop alpha acid content


Hello Homebrewers!  I had been looking for a way to figure out the alpha
acid content on some wild cluster hops from the family farm.  By way of the
good folks at Freshops, I have an address for a lab that does this.  It's -


        Bioanalytical Services/Hop Chemistry
        Agricultural Chemistry Department
        Oregon State University
        Corvallis, Oregon, 97331-6502
        Ph. 541-737-1887
Apparently the cost for this is about $30.  I don't know how much of a
sample they need, but at least this is one place to figure out the acid
content of unknown hops without ruining several batches of beer.




Beer is better than women because......when you walk into a bar you can
always pick up a beer.

Subject: Starter Question


I believe that one of the reasons to brew your own beer is to controll 
what boes into your brew. This becomes particularly true when you are 
dealing with allergies. One of my first experiments was to come up with a 
beer for my wife who is allergic to hops (spots and itching are so 
unromantic). My wife who never had an opportunity to aquire a taste for 
beer appreciated the effort but not the beer. My cranberry wit beer was a 
success enough to score 33 in competition.


        So I am now brewing an occasional mead (I know this is a beer 
forum). We also have a friend who is allergic to gluten (celiac sprue). I 
need to make a yeast starter without grain. My idea is to use 
preservative free apple concentrate and heat it enough to sterilize it 
but hopefully not set the pectin. Any ideas on temperatures, times, or 
alternatives ? Private e-mail is OK. TIA
        I am also curious about others who have to account for food 
sensitivities in their brewing.
        Dave

First batch using your hops: split the boil. Use some commericial hops

adjust for your preference.

Subject: kitchen gadgets


A couple of "exotic" kitchen gadgets came in  handy with my recent
brewing experiences.


I was doing a pre-prohibitation beer with rice and it (the cooked rice)
got really lumpy due to not enuf water.   I took our immersion blender
to the lumpy rice gruel and volla.....rice paste with no lumps.


Last night I made 11g dry stout recipe and I wanted to split it to make
a porter out of part  of the wort.  I ground and infused in water
chrystal, choclate and black malts to add to the porter portion and then
used my coffee making French Press to "sparge" the extract from the
residue.  Like a charm....


Now what gadget will help with a spouse that had other plans for the
kitchen and the brewer on brew day?   Cheers, jim booth, lansing,mi

Nathan Moore asks about finding cheap cornys....I got 10 of them for free and
 traded them around for the regulator et. all. I found mine at an old Factory
bar that had a flooding accident. Anything I could retrieve out of the dirt
basement was free! Going out of business sales are a real bargian--for lots
of stuff! I got a 10 ft banquet table for $15 bucks on the same trip!


John Mattson,
You've now spent severl hundred dollars amassing a garage system and you dont
use LIQUID YEAST!! Shame on you! The single biggest improvement in my
homebrewing experience occured when I moved to Liquid Yeast. The next biggest
improvement was when I stepped started pitching onto the yeast cake of a
former brew! You can overcome many an infection and high gravity problem by
pitching the right amount of live yeast! (yes its a PITA to learn to do it
right, but its worth it) Download and print out the volumous Yeast FAQ by
A.J. Delange at the Brewery. It contains everything you need to know and alot
more. Mine is a part of my 3-ring reference manual. Also, the Zmyurgy Kegging
issue has more info in one place than any other 2 sources combined. 


If you dont alreay build another EM into your kettle for straining cooled
wort through the hops, The pouring throuh a strainer released too much hop
crud and cold break into the wort.
- --------------------
Before christmas we made a spectacular american pils that I kept on draft for
the superbowl. This was an interesting batch. We, split the 12 gal batch, I
fermented closed, in my fridge and my partner ferments most everything open
in a 12 gal cut open keg in a (better temp controled) incubator. 


I bottled the day of the Feb Homebrew club meeting and at its first public
head to head tasting we found we had strikingly different beers. Much more so
than the Bock we did the same way. His tasted "oxygenated" and "less
aromatic" while mine was full bodied and screamed Saaz in the boquet, and
finished dry with a distict hop bitterness. I think the polite way of stating
the diference is to say my partner had a nice homebrew, while I had a darn
good beer! 


Maybe this is why I am so dismayed at its lack of "Shelf life" in the bottle.
 I gave a mixed 6-pack to a professional brewer for letting me brew with him.
 One of which we shared and enjoyed that day, the other of which he had this
last week.  Much to my dismay told me it died in the bottle. That there were
White things floating in it. This deeply depresses me. So last night I opened
one of the few I was saving for contests and, well, it tasted like miller
lite. ECH!!! While mine didnt have white floaties, It did have some yeast at
the bottom of the bottle. And It wasnt "Clearer than the 2 micron polish
filtration" that it was originally.  (it was never filtered to begin with) It
has lost all it nose, bitterness and body. I looked lighter, lost some of its
head, and tasted like water.  


What happened? 


Here are my symtoms of abuse: 


I clean my CPBF before and after use by siphoning Idophor through it. and
letting it soak at least 15 min submerged and filled before bottling. I don't
normally clean my pin lock connects between uses I try to put them on and
leave them on.


I soak my bottles in TSP and bleach to remove labels then wash in new
dishwasher with .3 cups or so of bleach and a heated rinse and dry cycle. I
tape the dish washer shut so nobody opens it till they're cool. Then I do a
cold water rinse from my tap with my carboy washer just before filling. 


I do boil my bottlecaps for 5 min.


Kegs, bottles and fermentation fridge stay on the non-heated/cooled back back
porch (Light protected) where temps sway with the weather.  -5 to 45F were
this years highs and lows. 


any advice or speculation is very appreciated. TIA

Subject: Re: Cold Plates




Mark Snyder asked about cold plates. As luck would have it I happened
to have my FOXX catalog with me at work today. A single circuit (one
tap) cold plate is listed as $76 and a double circuit (for two taps) is
$86. Fittings which have to be bought extra will run you another $5
maybe. 


They sell a complete cold plate cooler style jockey box set up
for $140 for single tap and $191 for dual taps. A SS coil style jockey box 
is $112 (single tap, 50' coil), $173 (single, 100' coil) and $342 (double, 
100' coils). 


All this opposed to maybe $60 to make your own complete setup with copper 
tubing. I don't really see a difference in terms of cleaning requirements 
in any of these different setups other than the fact that caustics can't 
be used on the cold plates (aluminum) and copper.


I would probably make my own first with copper coils, and if I wasn't 
satisfied, then maybe look around for a cold plate. Just my opinion, 
standard disclaimers, yada-yada-yada.

Subject:  Infections


During the heat of the battle on Sunday, I made some command decisions
regarding siphoning technique.  (My hop back was out of service, and I was
having difficulty straining the whole leaf hops in conjunction with siphoning
out of the kettle.)  After I pitched the yeast, and set the fermenter in the
corner of the kitchen, I began to think I may have made some grave mistakes
regarding the cleanliness of my process.  I pitched a healthy 700 ml starter,
and within 12 hours the high gravity (1.066) wort was bubbling at approximately
150 burps per minute.  Is it safe to assume that the wort is not infected,
given the excellent hold the yeast has on the fermentation process?  Or should
I still look for signs of infection?  Is infection a concern during the
fermentation process?  Or only before the yeast takes hold and after it
finishes its job?


The rest of my procedures are all well controlled, and I don't think I will
introduce new bacteria to the beer, but I am concerned about what I did on
Sunday.  Any thoughts?

This is true for whole corn meal, but not for degermed corn meal, which is
what you get at the grocery store's flour aisle. (In the health food aisle,
you may get whole meal).  Corn meal and grits are nearly identical in
composition and have under 1% fat. (Corn Chemistry and Technology, Chapter
11, Corn Dry Milling: Processes, Products, and Applications, R.J.
Alexander, p. 356 [no date since I have only a photocopy of the relevant 10
pages]).

Henius and Wahl (1902, p.716) recommend 30% malt in the cereal cooker and
cooking corn meal 45 minutes, corn grits 75 minutes.  Others recommend as
little as 10% malt.  I use 30% to get a little melanoidin color and flavor
in the beer.

And at the cost of some corn flavor, I would think.

Subject: Re: lemon lager


I talked to the head brewer at Saxer about the Lemon Lager.  He said
that it was basically a Radler, a German beverage that is half lager and
half lemonade.  My old German teacher told us that the Radler is something
a ten year old might get to drink, because his parents might not want him
to get blitzed on a half liter of beer.  It's also something one wouldn't
feel guilty about drinking at 10 am.


The brewer almost seemed embarrased that the Lemon Lager is their most
popular beer, and he also mentioned that most of the brewery's sales are
outside of Oregon.

1/2 glass lemonade

P.S. Bridgeport brewing in Portland was sold last fall, and they changed
their recipes in late December.  The ultra tasty XX Stout has been
replaced with something that tastes like Michelob Dark, really weak and
watery.  I used to gush about Brideport, but now all I can say is that
their beer sucks.

Subject: Exponentially Plateauing Gravity Runoff Etc


Hugh Graham replied to my post about approximating gravity of runoff during
sparging using a simple exponential:


"So, I envisage an initial plateau in the gravity followed by a sudden drop
then a gradual decay."


<Spencer Thomas also had replied with a practically identical comment.>


Thinking back to the data that I said I plotted once to track this, I think I
do remember something of a plateau.  This makes perfect sense as explained in
Hugh's post; the wort nearest the spigot at the start of the sparge would
remain at a constant gravity until lower gravity (sparge) water had a chance
to mix in.  But I'm real damn sure there was no "steep" dropoff in my plot,
rather a curving decay -- approximately an exponential, I surmised.


The plateau/steep-drop model makes sense if you think of the mash wort as a
solid "plug" of sugar-water, with a solid "piston" of plain water pushing it
through.  As long as it is wort running off, the gravity is constant, and
when the wort is gone, the gravity drops suddenly as the plain water now
appears at the spigot.


In reality, the answer is probably somewhere between our proposals.  If my
memory of the curve I plotted form the actual batch is at all accurate (a
stretch, really), then it implies that some diffusion of sparge water into
the lower reaches of the wort is occurring during the mash.  Is this the
result of channeling, or simply the relatively long contact time between the
plain and sugary waters?  During an hour sparge, I guess I can hang with the
idea of some mixing taking place, considering the amount of motion the liquid
is subjected to as it flows over grains and husks.  I can also believe that
especially at that early point in my all-grain experience, channeling may
have been a factor.


If anyone is planning to brew soon and feels like doing an experiment,
collecting runoff gravity data at fixed intervals during the sparge (either
time or volume intervals) would be most enlightening.  One reading at each
gallon sparged would be adequate to approximate the shape of the curve.

DAVID T. PETERS  asked a lot of questions about growing hops at home.


This will be my firm attempt at hop farming so I let the others comment on
the how and why, but I may be able to help with the when.


As I recall, rhizomes are usually only available at certain times of the
year (like now!), and supplies can be a bit shaky.  I called HopTech
yesterday, and they don't have theirs yet (Hopefully next week or so).
So if this is going to be your year too, you should probably start lining up
your source right now.


Good luck -- Randy in Modesto

  After a response to my recent posting on hops being poisonous to dogs I went
back to some previous HBD searches and it seems that the problem is most
common in greyhounds but has happened to a labrador retreiver.  Maybe
greyhounds are more attracted to the hop flavor and aroma.  Can anyone shed
more light on this issue.  I always dump my spent hops in the garbage disposal
just to be safe but I'd like to know how much hops is too much and whether its
only certain breeds that are attracted to hops.  Sorry if my previous post was
less than correct.

The recent discussion about deriving functions to describe SG changes
during sparging has lacked any data.  As such, discussion to date has,
by definition, been baseless.  Below are the results of SG measurements
during the sparge from 10 5 gallon batches.


All SG readings are corrected to 59F.  The batches have been numbered
1-10.  All mashes took place in a 10 gallon Gott cooler with pizza pan
false botton (about 1 pint of foundation space).  All sparges had at 
least 1 gallon recirculated before any readings were taken.  Most batches 
had 1.5-2.0 gallons of boiling sparge water dumped into the 10 gallon Gott 
as mashout raising the temp to >= 168F.


The readings represent the SG observed after X gallons had been collected.
TotVol is the total volume collected during the sparge, and TotSG is the
SG of the total volume collected. 


Blank entries have no data.


Details for each batch are available.

Subject: WeizenBock


John asks:


****
Jim Busch, can you give me some pointers on making my own Moonglow
Weizenbock?
My recipe thus far is 50% Belgian Wheat Malt, 30% Crisp 2-row, 20% Dark
Munich
brewed to 1065 SG with 15 IBUs Saaz for bittering. I plan on triple
decoction
mashing and using oat hulls to aid the sparge. Should I avoid boiling
the oat
hulls with the decoction and just add them at the start of the sparge?
Will I 
even need them? I am planning on using Wyeast 3068 and fermenting at
65F.


If I can't get dark munich malt what portions of Belgian Munich and
Chocolate
malt will get me close to the flavor profile of dark munich?


****


Probably the best source of info on Weiss and Weizenbocks is Warner's 
excellent book on Wheat beers.  One of the things I aim for in all
my weiss biers is using at least 60% wheat and as much as 70% in 
some recipes.   I just brewed a weiss on Sun that I made with 65%
DWC Wheat, 5% DWC Munich and 30% Weyermann pils.  Came out pretty 
dark with a 20 minute decoction.


As for the Weizenbock, how about trying some of the caraWheat malts
that Weyermann offers?  I would avoid chocolate malt completely.  
To emulate Moonglow Weizenbock you need to aim for an OG of 
1.080 or 20P, at least.  Double decoction should be adequate but
if you like triple decoctions go for it.  Lose the Crisp malt and
find some Pils malt, either German or Belgian.  I have no experience
with hulls but would think you dont want to boil these but line the
lauter tun with em.  I have never used hulls in a weiss bier but they
cant hurt.  The key to succesfully lautering weiss biers is the long
protein rests and decoctions.  Be sure to do a acid/ferullic acid rest
around 105-114F before you take it to protein rest stage.


Prost!

Beer and Mead Enthusiasts,


        The 1997 BJCP Style Guidelines are complete
and can be viewed at:
 http://www.execpc.com/~ddavison/bjcp.html
using the Adobe Acrobat 3.0 reader. Note that the last
revision date is 3/18/97.


Recent revisions to the mead guidelines have been
implemented. Note that there is an expanded set of mead
style guidelines available as a separate document. These
expanded mead guidelines may be used for competitions
with larger numbers of mead entries or they may be
useful as a reference to the most commonly made meads.
Special thanks to Michael Hall for providing the information
on which these guidelines are largely based. Thank Yous 
are also in order for Ken Schramm, Steve Dempsey, and
Dan McConnell. 


The beer categories have remained stable
since early February. In the future the guidelines will be
updated only once at the end of the year. 


        Since beer styles are always changing and 
evolving, the BJCP has decided to form a subcommittee 
of the Competition Committee to evaluate, research, and 
update our guidelines.


        We are looking for a variety of individuals to fill 
various roles in the committee. The level of commitment 
may vary greatly. One can volunteer as an outside 
consultant for a particular style or become a long term 
member of the committee. Qualifications may include but
are not limited to:


 -access to historical materials.
 -access to research materials.
 -in depth knowledge of all styles.
 -expertise in a particular style.
 -acquainted with known expert(s) on a style.
 -able to perform research/interviews with experts in
 a style's country of origin.
 -experience and knowledge chairing committees, keeping
 focus and bringing issues to closure.
 -commercial industry contacts.
 -commercial brewing experience


Interested parties should e-mail Tom Fitzpatrick 
(fitz`at`fnal.gov) with the following information:


1. Name
2. Preferred e-mail address
3. City, State, Country
4. Paragraph outlining your desired role and 
level of time commitment.


        The BJCP welcomes all opinions, comments, and 
suggestions regarding style guidelines. 


Cheers!

this is a big kudos to all the hbd'ers who sent me their recipes for
barleywine and answered my questions re:carbonation...  the consensus
seems to be that in order to carbonate, i use a low to medium amount of
priming sugar, and re-pitch the yeast at bottling time.


so, kudos to:

        m faraggi

i will brew this barleywine in the next two months or so, and my decision
re:which one to brew will be based primarily on what i can get my hands
on... so far, it looks like i can get just about any substance i need...
my homebrew supply shop is better than i ever suspected...


i'll post the results re:yumminess in a few months.


thanks again!

Hello..I've been eyeing the Spider's Tongue Rauchbier recipie in TNCJOHB

ferment at ale/room temps since spring is here and my basement will not be
at lager temps too much longer. I'd like to hear comments on what this
will effects this will have on the outcome of the beer. (I've also read
that dried lager yeasts don't ferment well at lager temps, so maybe this
is 'moot') Any comments would be great. Posting/or private e-mail is fine.

Subject: re: manifold, keg cleaning, yeast, straining


John Mattson asks in HBD 2378:


1.  I have cleaned my kegs first by soaking overnight with a cup of vinegar
and hot water (disassembled dip tubes/connections soaked them separately).


John, the acid in the vinegar may not be good for the stainless.


 ... the pop
smell was just as strong as before I started cleaning them.<snip>
  What should I try next? 


I clean mine with TSP, but I had the same problem until I pulled out the dip 
tubes, tore off a small piece of a cotton rag, attached it to a clothes 
hanger and pulled the rag through the dip tube several times, rinsing each 
time through. You won't believe the gunk I found in there (gag me please...).


<snip>... if I am carbonating with C02 in the keg, do I still need to add sugar?


No, you don't. It'll just cause the yeast to reactivate giving you more 
sediment to deal with.


2.  My next question is about yeast.... <snip>
 If I rehydrate
the yeast in a sterilized cup with boiled water cooled to 40 to 45
centigrade (104 to 115 degrees farenheit), wait 10 minutes or so then stir
before pitching, is it a shock to the yeast to pitch it into wort that is 65
to 70 degrees farenheit?  


Should I wait until they are the same temperature?
There is even a greater difference going from 104 to 115 degrees rehydrating
the yeast to 50 degree farenheit lagering temperatures in the garage.  Any
advice?


I've pitched like that and never had a problem. BUT, 115F is a bit warm. 
Definitely keep it below 110, preferably around 90-95.


3.  One last question.... I strain the cooled wort with a funnel and
strainer as I pour it into the carboy.  With someone else's help, I cover
the clean carboy top with a piece of plastic wrap, hold it in place with one
hand over the top, and shake it to try and aerate the wort.  Should I shake
it before I pitch the yeast, or does it matter? Also, would it be better to
shake the carboy a little before it is completely full (while there is more
air in the headspace), then fill it the rest of the way and shake again?
suggestions?


Get a larger carboy. The headspace is worth the extra few bucks. I use 6.5 
gal carboys for 5 gallon batches. Pitch, then aerate. I pitch and fix the 
airlock, then tilt the carboy up on edge and rotate the top of the bottle in 
quick, small circles. In about 1 minute of that I get 4-6" of bubbles on top 
of the wort. I think it works well.

     light ale with about 2 lbs. of pumpkin in the mash, one low 
     alcohol ale with 1 lb. of crystal 60L and Costmary instead 
     of hops and one IPA.  The two lower alcohol brews did really 
     well.  I didn't experience any noticable fermentation/floc. 
     problems.  The IPA on the other hand has a very noticable

     noticable fermentation/floc. problems.  I would use this
