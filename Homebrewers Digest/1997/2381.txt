I originally read a news item in an issue of Zymurgy about this. The report 
involved sighthounds. They all suffered from "malignant hyperthermia", 
which is an uncontrollable fever, followed by convulsions. The first 
symptom is heavy panting, followed by rapid heartbeat and rise in body 
temperature. The substance in hops that causes the disease has not been 
identified. I have a Golden Retriever, and understand your fears. All the 
reported cases involved dogs eating spent hops, or the hops after the boil 
was complete. No reference was made to fresh hops, which could indicate that
the chemical causing the death was formed in the boil. But, I too am nervous.
My dog is my brew buddy, but when it comes to straining the wort, or cleaning
the boil equipment, she stays away. I wouldn't be too worried about the other
animals though. Their diets consist of greens and such. But if you can put 
a fence around your hop plants to keep the dogs out, please do. I did.
I don't want to take any chances with my dog.

First off Chris, the roots on the bottom of the pots are nothing 
more than roots. Although a rhizome is considered a root, it varies 
from a typical root. What you are clipping at the bottom are the roots 
used to get water and nutrients, I don't know what you really call them, 
but you get the idea. If you clip them, they will die. Which brings us to 
the lack of production. I'm no expert, but it seems that clipping the 
roots might cause damage to the plants, or at least inhibit the retrieval 
of nutrients. Your hop plants are also trying to tell you something. The 
pots they are in are too small. It's too late now to do anything, but next
February, take the hops, cut off some rhizomes, and plant all of them into 
the ground. Fertilize the ground well with manure, some mulch, and water 
well. You will notice a difference. By the way, rhizomes are a thicker 
piece of root. When you pull the hop plant out, you will notice the size 
difference, and you'll notice "buds" on them. Try to get a couple of 
buds per cutoff.


Good luck in your brewing and growing adventures,

Subject: square cooler for 5 gal. recipes??


I've decided to move on to all-grain brewing (finally!!). Right now 
I'm considering building a square picnic cooler mashtun.


While I hope to eventually move on to larger sizes, I'm concentrating 
on 5 gallon batches right now.


Anyone wish to make any suggestions on size for this? The local 
Wal-mart has both 48 and 56 qt sizes on sale for under $20. Will the 
56 qt be too big? For that matter will the 48 be as well?


I've seen all the debate about round vs. square already. What I need 
are suggestions about the square one.


Thanks in advance.

To clarify this issue.  Germany has a great expanse of bicycle paths            
throughout the country.  This includes the wine region and many others.         
A bicycle is known as a FahrRAD.  As you well know beer is considered           
food here in Germany and is a staple in everyday life.  While bicycling the     
Germans desired a refreshing beer beverage to sustain them but did not          
want to later fall off of their bicycles.  There answer to this was to develop  
the RADler, a mixture of beer and lemonade.

Subject: Hormones


Rob Moline in HB 2380 talks about female hormones in beer. I hope this
fact does not surprise anybody. The hormones mentioned probably come from
the hops, which contain a certain amount of a hormone closely related to
female hormones. Actually, hops have in older days been used as a drug to
"cure" rapists and other sexually "overactive" cases. According to my
botanical books, hop pickers (in former days of course, now the machines
have taken over .. or?) are also known to develop female "breasts" etc.

Subject: HCl


Charley Burns asked about using hardware store muriatic acid for lowering
the pH of sparge water. Yes, it works just fine and you use so little of it
that the fact that it isn't food grade can, perhaps, be overlooked but as
you can buy food grade phosphoric acid and lactic acid why not use one of
those? Anyway I calculate the hardware store stuff to be 8.75 N which means
that each milliliter contains 8.75 milliequivalents (mEq) of hydrogen ions.
In order to calculate how much is needed you need to know the alkalinity of
your water (check the water report or see below). Alkalinity is almost
always given in ppm (mg/L) "as calcium carbonate". Divide the given value
by 50 to get the mEq per liter. For example, if the alkalinity is 100 ppm
as CaCO3, there are 2 milliequivalents per liter. Multiply the mEq/L by the
amount of water to be adjusted. Five gallons of sparge water is 19 liters
so the total alkalinity in this volume of the example water would  be 2*19
= 38 mEq and you would need 38/8.75 = 4.34 mL of the acid. This amount will
bring the pH to near 4 (because of the way alkalinity is defined). In
practice you should probably measure out a bit more acid than calculated
(say 5 mL in this example) and dilute it in a liter of water (add acid to
water), then stir, say, half of this into the sparge water. Now add the
rest bit by bit, monitoring pH as you go (test strips are plenty accurate
enough for this) until you reach the desired pH.


If you don't know the alkalinity of the water you could try putting 10 mL
of the acid into one liter of water and then add this a little at a time to
the 5 gal until pH 5 is reached. This will tell you how much to use in the
future. If you do the same experiment until pH 4.3 is reached you have just
done what the analyst does when he measures alakalinity (except that he
does it on a smaller scale and uses HCl whose strength is more accurately
known).


Alk = 50*(mL of diluted acid used/1000)*(8.75*10)  ppm as CaCO3

Subject: RE:   Decoction - concensus on Temp, not on Percent


In HBD #2380 Charley summarizes some of his off-line discussions
regarding decoction mashing.


""I've had recommendations that say pull from 1/3 to 1/2 for the
decoction on
one end to pull 90% (virtually all) the grain for the decoction. Now,
I've
been doing the 80-90% trick and not having very good luck. Lets have a
public discussion here on the relevant advantages of one over the
other.""


I was (a) proponent of the "virtually all" technique.  This needs to be
qualified, though.  I use a 40-60-70 decoction schedule to easily
control wort fermentability.  Both of the temp. steps in this schedule
require pulling "as much as possible" of the thickest mash.  I use a
strainer, which means I do not have very much liquid present in the
decoct, so the heat capacity (??)of my decoct is lower than that of the
rest mash. I know a lot of people add water to the decoct, thus
increasing its heat cap., so they wouldn't need to pull as much.


I find it is much much much easier to cool, using ice, a small amount of
boiling mash to the strike temp than it is to heat the entire mash if I
undershoot by not pulling a large enough decoction.


Using a double decoction I find that the 135-40 F rest yields both
increased fermentability (high BA activity) and decreased chill haze
(provided there is some "pale" malt in the grist).  I am a strong
advocate in favor of using the 40-60-70 temp profile with decoction
mashing, though not with infusion mashing.

I claim in no way to be a RIMS expert, but I'll be glad to share my 
experience as a data point.  I've been using my home made RIMS for about 4 
months and maybe 5 batchs (I've been too busy to brew as much as I would 
like).


I tend to let the mash settle for about 15 minutes after the initial 
infusion.  I use this to let the temperature stabilize, so I know where I'm 
starting.  Then, I begin recirculating and depending on the temperature 
program, I may or may not begin immediately to run the heating element. 
 I've used numerous temp programs, depending on grain bill and beer style. 
 I've not really settled on an "optimum" temperature program.  I'd be 
interested in hearing others' comments on that.  Typically, once the pump is 
running I let the pump run to recirculate during the entire mash.  Then, 
when I'm ready to transfer to the kettle, I just switch the chamber outlet 
from going back into the mash over to the kettle.  I throttle back on the 
flow into the kettle, since I recirculate faster than you would want to 
sparge.


Good questions, Jason.   We seem to spend a lot of time talking about RIMS 
construction, but not as much on the actual use.  I'd also like to hear 
about some other RIMS'ers actual routines.  Also, I'd appreciate any 
constructive criticism of my process.

     Hey Collective,
     
     There seems to be some questions about effective decoction schedule's.

     Here is a schedule I've used for a good tasting beer but with head 
     retention problems.  This is the base beer for a Strawberry beer so I 
     wanted a pretty light favor so don't kill me about using the rice.
     
     Grain bill:
     10 lb. pale 2 row
     4 lb. raw rice
     1 lb. raw wheat
     1 lb. crystal 20l
     2 lb. clover honey
     
     Take 5.5 gal of water raise to 104 F and add 5 lb. pale 2-row rest at 
     104 for 30 min. (acid rest)
     Raise temp to 140 F using decoction, add 1 lb wheat, 5 lb 2row and 1 
     lb crystal at 140 F, rest at 140 F for 30 min. (I'm thinking about 
     reducing this rest time to 15 min.)
     raise temp to 158 F using 3rd decoction, rest at 158 F for 30 min
     while 3rd decoction rests add rice to boil pot with water and raise to 
     a boil for 20 min.  Let cool to 170 F and drain boil pot into mash tun 
     to sparge.
     
     Like I said a pretty good schedule for me and I think reducing the 
     protein rest to 15 min. will improve it with this grain bill.  However 
     I've tasted decoction batches that were better than this so if you've

Subject: Starch in Steeped Grains


Hello HBD,


George De Piro writes about keeping starch out of your beer.
His argument that this provides a competition-free food source
for such bad boys as wild yeast and bacteria makes sense
to me.  In fact, reviewing the recipes of some of my early
extract brews, I was distressed to discover that I had
unwittingly steeped grains like Munich, wheat and even
2-row pale (these were borrowed recipes).  These beers
became unpleasant after a little while and definitely had
more than their share of gas (CO2).


In any event, this leads me to my question: What about
grains like chocolate and roasted barley?  When these
grains are steeped, don't they release starch?  The grain
extract tables that I've seen indicate that these highly
roasted grains will still yield 23 to 30 points/pound/gallon
when mashed in the presence of working enzymes.  So there
is starch in them, right?  Or, does the roasting make this
starch (somehow) unsuitable for the infectious bugs?
And, FWIW, Papazian's book says that these grains should be
crushed when steeped - seemingly a great way to release
that starch.


I've read that crystal has some unconverted starch, too.
If I could speculate for a moment (admittedly a dangerous
thing to do ;-), maybe steeping grains adds a small amount
of starch to the beer that permits a low-grade infection
that gives rise to that "homebrew twang".


Any thoughts?

BTW, "unconverted starch" seems like a rather redundant
term to me, but I see it used everywhere.  I mean, if
starch hasn't been converted, it's still "starch".  Maybe
"remaining starch" would be better.  Oh well.  ;-/

Obviously, if you're trying to go from 122 - 153 you need to pull a bigger
decoction than if you go from 140 -153.


>Now, I've

What was your bad luck? - overshooting temp, slow conversion? For
overshooting you can just add back the decoction in stages and stop when you
hit your strike.  Cool the remaining decoction and add in.


>Is this really the only factor that we need to consider? Or are we concerned

Really the reason to do a decoction (other than masochism) is to boil the
grains.  To make it  worth the trouble you probably want to boil at least
half the grains. Another thing you could do is a 105-130-155 sequence with
two decoctions.  Then most of the grain will get boiled at least once.

Subject: Input for decoction discussion


Charlie and other HBDers:


While I do not exclusively brew with the decoction method, I am quite a fan.  
However, I do not consider myself a "guru" as Charlie requested.  Being this 
is the HBD, I will offer my *uninformed* opinion anyway. :-)  Just for 
purposes of definition I would consider a "thick" mash to be about 1Q per 
pound of grain, and a "thin" mash to be about 1.5Q per pound of grain or 
greater.  


Charlie asks for what fractions/density mash he should be shooting for when he 
"pulls" the decoction.  I am in favor of (and this may be a repeat of previous 
emails):  mashing in at 1Q per #, pulling enough grains to constitute 1/3 of 
the total mash volume (this may in fact be 1/2 of the grains -- I've never 
been really exact about this part of the procedure), adding boiling water to 
the decoction mash (usually about 1/2Q per #) to get to 160F, resting, boiling 
for the prescribed decoction, and re-combining with the rest mash.


This makes a pretty thin decoction.  I think the thin mash provides the brewer 
with greater temperature control, helps prevent scorching, and reduces 
possible HSA from overstirring  a thick mash.  I do not see the big advantage 
in thick mashes.  I can produce a VERY dextrinous (sic) wort simply by mashing 
in the high temp range, get lots of color/carmelization with the thin mash 
boil, and seem to get quicker conversion with the thinner mashes than the 
thick ones.  The only reason I could see for trying to keep the mash thick 
would be if I were mash tun limited and wanted to make a high gravity beer.  
But I'd consider double mashing before I attempted an ultra-thick mash for a 
high gravity wort.


Maybe those of you who work with particularly thick mashes have some secrets 
to share?

Subject: decoction processing


In HBD #2380 Charley (perplexed in N. California) calls for a discussion
about decoction processing


Here's my two bits (place change in the courtesy cup) on my
non-tradional decoction:


First, regarding protein rests, I think of protein rests in a way very
similar to saccarification rests.  Depending on your rest temps you can
develop proteins that will remain in the finished beer or not, just as
you develop sugars that will ferment out or remain as flavor
contributors.  I give consideration to  the protein profile of my beer
as much as I do my sugar profile.


Resting at lower temps like 112-122F (45-50C) develops simpler proteins
(good for yeast growth but unlikely to be necessary) in a way similar to
beta-amylase and still leaves abundant large molecular weight proteins.
Too long at this temp however will degrade your medium weight proteins
costing you mouthfeel and body in your finished beer.  If you really
want to reduce those qualities this is the place to do it.  Personally I
rarely perform this rest although I did recently in a 6-row + corn
recipe.  This rest is called for though, if you should have a glucanate
problem in your finished beer -- never seen it.


Resting at temps around 125-140F (51-60C) will develop medium weight
proteins by degrading large molecular weight proteins.  Again, the
medium weight proteins are the ones you really want for your beer, the
largest proteins are otherwise a wasted protein source since they'll
largely coagulate in the boil and drop out as hot break and as cold
break.


I generally rest at 135F (57C) to keep away from my beta-amylase range
and degrade my largest proteins into medium weight proteins.  This also
helps develop beta-amylase for the sugar rests later.  I "park" my mash
here while cooking the decoc fraction.  In a non-decoc mash I would
still rest here about 25-40 minutes depending on the grain bill


Because I want to exploit as much starch as possible in a decoc, and
because my personal quest is lazy brewing,  I cook the biggest, thickest
fraction of the mash possible, including a mini-rest at 156F (69C)
before boil, and then cool it back to temp with an immersion chiller
before adding back to the remaining fraction.  When pulling a big
fraction consider that you still need enzymes for the mini-rest so be
sure to carry over a good portion of the liquid too.  In cooking a decoc
fraction of 3-gallons (12L) of grain I usually carry over about another
gallon or gallon and a half (4-6L) of liquid.


Since I heat directly, this method spares me from having to do thermal
mass calculations and still renders the bulk of starch available with
all the benefits of cooking (Maillard reactions) in one decoc step.
Double and triple decocs with small fractions double and triple-cook
some of the grain, which is tastier, with each cooking, there's no
reason not to do the same while resting in the upper proteolytic stage
either.


When added back, the enzyme system is ready to go, medium weight
proteins are developed and I go through my saccarification stop(s)
deliberately.  I think cooking smaller decocs while resting in
saccarification temps may sometimes force you to overdevelop sugars you
don't want for your profile. Infusion mashers can work out the thermal
mass equations for what temp the decoc has to be when added back, to
raise the whole mash to their next step.

This is a really interesting sounding idea. Take it straight from 140f to 
158-160F without the 15-20 minute step by step method. This would create a 
highly dextrinous wort though, and for an Oktoberfest type it might be more 
appropriate than for a Vienna which is what I'm shootin' for. It has the 
added benefit of shortening the decoction process by 20 minutes or so. 
Definite benefit.

I'll definitely keep this idea around for future 'fests or bocks.

I think we need to do some educating while we're at it. I entered a Cream 
Ale , which can be a high adjunct beer, at last years Saint Paul Brewing 
Competition. All the remarks came back saying that it had a little DMS.
It did not go on. A national judge thats runs a brew pub asked me to bring
my cream ale and a steam beer to the awards presentation to try. He said 
that the cream ale had DMS. Corn is DMS. If you taste it in a Chech Pils 
than there is a problem, but not in a Miller clone. This year I am using rice 
as an adjunct, we will see how it does.

Doug Otto was asking about experience with these.  I have used one for
several years and can honestly say I prefer it to bottling. There are lots
of advantaGES.  If you only depend on the co2 cartridges, then it would work
out expensive. I ussually prime the barrel and leave it for a few weeks
before consumption.  Then I find I need to top up with cartridges towards
the end. They still mature with time in the same way as bottled beers,
within reason. I have seriously considered buying another so that one is
ready for drinking, and on is maturing.


You can fill bottles (eg PTFE for a party) but they go flat quickly.


If I can set up cheaply enough with a soda tanks and CO2, then I would go
this way rather than a second Edme barrel. Spemding too much on the house
and garden at the moment though.

Jason Henning asked in #2380:


>Do you RIMSers let the pump run the whole time? Or just to do >temperature
raises and now and then to maintain a rest temperature? 


I run mine constantly, killing it only after mashout.  Helps keep the temp.
uniform in the RIMS tun methinks.  Although I haven't tried it, I reckon one
could kill the pump after the wort clears and just use it for temp boosts.  


If you do stop the pump, make real sure you kill the power to the heater!
Electrically interlocking the heater and the pump would be a *very* good
idea if you plan intermittant pumping.  A relay with coil wired in parallel
with the pump's power feed and a set of normally open contacts wired in
series with the heater's power is one way to interlock them.  


>Any other tips are welcome as well.


Don't start the pump initially at a high flow, start at a low or no flow and
work up to avoid a stuck mash.  


Arrange *all* of the piping between the pump's suction and the tun so that
there are no sections which would trap air or, alternatively, provide an air
vent at the top of all trapped sections.  Pockets of trapped air will reduce
the flow and may cause HSA.  Along this line, made sure the pump suction
piping is air-tight; just because the piping doesn't leak wort doesn't mean
it's air-tight.


- ---------------
How do you other RIMS users dough-in?  I typically fill my RIMS with water,
recirc and heat it, kill the pump and heater, stir in the grain well, let
settle for 5 mins. or so then start recirculating and heating. I know it's
recommended that water be added to the malt instead of the back-assward way
I do it.  Anyone see any problems with this?
