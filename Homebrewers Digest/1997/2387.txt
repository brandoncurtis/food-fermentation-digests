Well, Rich, that would depend on at least three variables that I can think

 in addition to that last hbd post, if the cell count is greater than
a "few hundred" on the grid the counting can be tedious....do a dilution or two
to get a reasonable number and take this into consideration when
you calculate.... i think the best range was less than 400/chamber....


in counting that i have done, the outcome can vary quite a bit, so insure your
sample is mixed well/or done by wt and the dilutions are done very accurately.


the other big ticket item is the slide and slip must be very clean and if you

Subject: Hydrometer correction formula


In HBD#2386, Jim Thomas asks about a formula for correcting hydrometer
readings.


Jim, I've got a nice equation that does a great job of predicting 60F
hydrometer readings from higher temperature observations, and have
encorporated it into an Excel spreadsheet as you are trying to do.


Unfortunately I don't have the formula handy as I write this.  What I can
give you is the way I GOT the formula, which you can use to generate your
own, custom tailored to your hydrometer.  (Is the temperature correction
hydrometer dependent, or just a density change of the wort itself?  My
intuition says that hydrometer expansion is part of the observed effect,
but I can't back this up rigorously.)


My hydrometer came with a little correction table.  I plotted the data from
the table, then did a least squares polynomial fit to generate an empirical
function to mimic the data.  The data was decidedly nonlinear, but a
quadratic (i.e. y = ax2 + bx + c) fit it very nicely over the range I had
data for.  I've checked the equation many times and it gives good
predictions of 60F SG readings within my observational error over the range
60-120F.


I did the fitting from within my graphing software (Kaleidagraph) but I'm
sure that if you dig around, Excel can do it too.

Good morning all,


Tom Pope said:
>Bill Giffin  has  again criticized the the AHA and their competition.
It's evident Bill doesn't like the AHA
<
I don't dislike the AHA I am extremely disapointed with them.  The
AHA often presents itself as something it isn't or promises to provide a
service which is beyond its competence. I believe that the AHA NHC is
one of the services that is beyond the competence of the AHA.  
                                
Tom again:
> I do believe, however, that his remarks concerning the
judging are unfair and untrue,  at least in my experience.
<


Anyone who has judged, organized a competition knows there are
excellent judges, good judges, and not so good judges.  There are too
sides to the judging question one is the judges, with whom I find no
fault being one, the other is the organization of the competition and
that can have a very serious effect on the judging.  A judge can only be
expected to judge adequeately a few beers within a given time This
number has been given as between 8-12.  Yet at the last NHC first
round I judged I judged 12 pale ales in the morning and 15 barleywines
in the afternoon.  How well do you think the barleywines were judged
no matter how hard my partner and I tried?


Tom  goes on to say that at least in his region the beers are well and
properly judged and a good many of them win first place.  If the folks
on the West coast are doing such a good job then why is it that so many of
the beers that win in that region have only a nodding aquantance with
the style guidelines?  


Numbers of beers that a judge has to judge, the temperature that the
beers are presented to the judges, the conditions of the area where the
judging takes place, these are items that have a great effect on the
outcome of a competition and many of them have been done incorrectly
by the AHA NHC.


Further more each year I entered the AHA NHC at least 10% of the
entered beers got lost, broken or the score sheets were not returned. 
When  you complain you get ho hum.

Subject: Wheat beer-rings around bottle necks


It seems whenever I brew a beer with a weizen or a belgian yeast, I get
rings around the necks of my bottles.  The beers taste fine, so I don't
think they're infected. If I had this problem with only my weizens or
witbiers, I would think they might be "protein rings", but I've noticed
this same phenomenon in my all-barley belgian ales as well.  I don't have
this problem with my other ales or lagers.  I either do step infusions, or
(usually with weizens)single decoctions.
It would be easy for me to assume from the above information that it has
something to do with the yeast, except for the fact that none of the other
brewers I know have had this problem.  Any idea's out there?  I sanitize my
bottles by soaking them in bleach solution (.5 oz. per gal), usually
overnight.  Could this eventually cause etching in the glass which could
attract weizen/belgian type yeast?  There is no visible etching in any of
my bottles and I've been using them for about four years.


By the way, I have a weizen in secondary right now and there is a film on
the surface of the beer. It sort of looks like an oil slick and where it
contacts the carboy sides, the smudge looks like the same stuff I get in my
bottles. Once again, the beer tastes fine.


Another thing that has been bugging me over the years (and it might be
related to the above problem) is that when I brew very pale beers (All
pilsener malt lagers, for instance) the yeast (or something)tends to cling
to the sides of the bottles.  This happens whether I do a decoction mash or
a step infusion, and with ales as well as lagers, but doesn't happen with
beers that are amber or darker in color.  The only way to avoid this is to
fine the beers in secondary with polyclar or bentonite, or I suppose a long
secondary without finings would do the job, but I'm usually not that
patient.  This problem also makes me wonder about invisible etching in my
bottles, or could a slight bleach residue act as some kind of magnet for
yeast?  Any input would be appreciated; private e-mail or otherwise.

Good question.  I'm surprised that this doesn't come up more often.  After 
all, those of us who are passionate about beer do tend to consume a large 
number of calories that needs to be accounted for somehow.  My beer 
consumption is about the same as yours.  I'm not a nutritionist, but I've 
always been kind of health conscious.  I encountered a similar problem with 
weight gain when I started drinking more homebrew/craft brew.  I still do 
struggle to keep the weight down.  I'm not a fan of " fad diets".  I don't 
think that they do any good.  My recommendation is to continue to try to eat 
a balanced diet.  We ALL tend to eat too much fat.  Cutting back on that 
always helps (9 calories per gram vs. 4 for protein and carbohydrates, if I 
recall correctly).  The bottom line for me is physical activity.  I find 
that I can maintain my weight much more easily, regardless of diet, if I 
stay active.


It's a simple equation.  To lose weight, calorie output must be greater than 
calorie input.  If you drink beer, you need to remember that beer becomes 
part of the input side of the equation.

HBD:
For many years I have been using the blow off tube to deal with the ferment
head.  In my five gallon carboy it seemed like the the thing to do.  I
recently went to a 6.5 gallon glass for primary.  I'm curious (the curse of
being a homebrewer, eh?)... what are the opinions of any who do either way
(to blow off or not to blow off) and especially those that have done both.
Comments could be couched regarding off flavors, etc., with mentions of

From: Steve Alexander <stevea`at`clv.mcd.mot.com>
Subject: Re: Decoction, tannin, corrections


Chris Cooper asks why there is no concern about tannins in decotion
boils, when a significant fraction of the mash grist is boiled for 10'
to 30' minutes.  There is. I've been collecting information on phenols
and tannins for some time in hopes of eventually posting a series of
phenol notes, but alas I'm still far from ready. 


The short answer is that the large phenol polymers in malts, like
tannins, are expected to complex with the proteins coagulated during the
decoction boil. This is like an early hot break. Also note that decocted
beers are traditionally subjected to long lager periods during which
protein tannin complexes may sediment.


A double decoction beer (50C/60C/66C) I made last year with a high
percentage of rye malt had several flavor problems including excess
phenolics.  The problem *might* be that the very undermodified rye
malt(and I got that directly from Maryann Gruber at Breiss) did not
release sufficient protein into solution to match the tannins released. 
It would be interesting to know more about the rye malt used by
Schreierling in their decoction 'Roggen' rye beer.


In any case the traditional decoction methods produce beers without
tannin problems, but Chris is correct to be aware of a potential problem
here.
- --


Dave Burley expresses concern about my practice of pulling virtually all
of the GRIST in a single decoction.  Greg Noonan's advice in 'Brewing
Lager Beers' is that the first decoction is the thickest 1/3rd of the
mash volume and the second decoction is the thickest 40% of the mash
volume.  A rudimentary calculation assuming 8# of grist, 1# of grist
displaces about 0.05 gallon, 1# of grist holds about 0.125gal of liquid
when sieved or lautered (and I think that is a high estimate), and that
thickest mash is no more than .1875 gal/# of liquid -  will show that
Noonans thickest 1/3rd of the mash will contain more than 50% of the
grist. Noonans second 40% volume thickest decoction will take over 60%
of the grist. My practice of pulling 100% of the very thickest portion
of the grist is about 45% of the mash volume and about 1/3rd of the mash
liquid.


In practice I've decocted high percentages of raw wheat adjunct with
this method and without unusual conversion times.


Dave's concern about the enzymes soluability and propensity to stick
with the grist portion has some validity.  I believe I've addressed the
soluability issue previously.  The enzymes are bond for relatively
longish periods of time in their active hydrolysis sites of their
substrates.  Note that the Kolbach index indicates that around 40% of
all of the nitrogen (a protein proxy) is immediately soluable in modern
malts.  Also a remarkable fraction of the carbs (~45%) are soluabilized
in 30 minutes.  These fractions of protein and carbos represents a very
large fraction of the *accessible* substrate sites for the free enzymes
[note that the amylases can't be bound in the starch granules which are
undegraded for example].  Because of this I must again recommend an
enzyme soluabilizing first rest of about 30' before pulling the first
decoction - regardless of the percentage pulled.  This first rest can be
a traditional dough-in or combined with saccharifying rest.
- --
In a previous post I referred to Kolbach index and 'STN', Scott Murman
points out that this is not a widely accepted acronym.  By 'STN' I meant
the Soluable to Total Nitrogen Ratio which is more commonly written as
SN/TN or SNR.  This figure is used as a measure of the degree of
modification of a malt.
- --
In HBD #2384 Charles Rich 'Decoc Redux'  there are several incorrect F/C
temperature numbers given.  I believe that the Fahrenheit numbers are
correct, but this is really for Charles to say.  Nice post otherwise.

This is a direction I'd really like to see the discussion turn,  I agree
with Steve Alexander, too, that the flavor difference doesn't hit you
over the head, it's more a difference in the way your malt flavor tastes
 - than a magnification of malt flavor.

served once in Holland with a very big, forward malt flavor.  I think
now that that will be developed more from the grain bill than the
mashing process.


By the way my next experiment with decocting is going to be to cook the
bejeezus out of my decoc fraction in a pressure canner after its
mash-rests.  Tonight I'm going to pressure cook about a half-pound
(250g) of Belgium Pils after a dextrinous rest at 156F (69C) and another
half-pound after a simple sugar rest at 148F (65C) (both will have a
rest at 135F, 57C, first) just to revisit some of questions that George
De Piro recently raised and to see how they cook.  I expect this to
brown way more than I get by hand-stirring, with no risk of scorching,
and take less time and trouble.  I can fit my old five gallon brew pot
in the canner, but I'll just cook these in mason jars.

Subject: AHA Membership Benefits/Decoction mashing-extract efficiency


     Hi all,
     
     I really wanted to avoid more AHA Bashing, but their latest mailing is 
     so amusing that I can't contain myself!
     
     I just received a letter asking me to renew my AHA membership.  Aside 
     from Zymurgy magazine, it says that there are many other membership 
     benefits, which are listed on the enclosed attachment.
     
     Well, quelle surprise!  There was NOTHING else in the envelope!  This 
     letter was signed by Karen Barella, AHA President.  I thought she 
     quit?
     -----------------------------------
     It is commonly said that decoction mashing increases mash efficiency 
     by helping to break up starch that is otherwise inaccessible to the 
     amylases.  This would definitely be true with undermodified malts, in 
     which much of the starch is trapped within the protein matrix of the 
     grain, but with today's malts I don't find this to be the case.
     
     In my experience (I stress that this is only my experience!), my 
     extract efficiencies are very similar whether infusion mashing or 
     decocting.  I decoct only to aid in protein removal and increase 
     melanoidin formation.  Any small differences I experience in 
     batch-to-batch efficiency are probably due to any of a hundred other 
     variables.
     
     I think some of the confusion arises because there is a 
     misunderstanding of what "well modified" malt means.  It does not mean 
     that the malt starch has been converted to sugar by the maltster.  It 
     means that the young plant was allowed to germinate to a point where 
     the degradation of the protein that gives the endosperm structure was 
     maximized.  Without these proteins, starches are more easily 
     solubilized.  Decocting is NOT necessary to release them from the 
     grain.
     
     This is why low temp protein rests are bad for well-modified malts.  
     The large proteins are already well degraded.  Resting between 113F 
     and 122F (45C-50C) will only serve to degrade the desirable 
     middle-molecular weight proteins that the maltster provided.
     
     Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could obtain malt analysis specs so 
     that we'd know for sure what we are working with?  Do you small pro 
     brewers get spec sheets?
     
     Have fun!

I'm no chemist, Dan (as recently attested) -- indeed, I'm currently

1/2 tsp. of ascorbic acid to my bottling bucket.  (Be sure to get
ascorbic acid and *not* Vitamin C tablets -- they have other stuff in
'em as well.)  No, it doesn't bother the yeasties in the least -- don't
forget that they're anaerobic at this point.


I learned about ascorbic acid on p. 106 of Pap's NCJOHB.  You may wish
to refer to it.

This is merely anecdotal evidence, and should not warrant any more
weight than any other questionable data, but it _is_ something to
consider.


My brewing partner and I always composted our spent grains and sweet
hops directly to his flower beds.  His Golden Retriever was often
interested in these yummy smells, and was seen on many occasions
sampling the goodies.


One day my partner came home from work and found his dog barely
conscious, panting like crazy.  He rushed the dog to the vet where he
was found to have a high fever and was put on some sort of dialysis? to
fight a suspected poisoning.  They were able to save the dog's life, but
he was never even close to his old self.  Kind of like Cujo.


This occurred two years before this thread first appeared on HBD so we
had no clue what had happened at the time.  Clearly, we'll never know
for sure, but I personally will hesitate to dismiss these claims as
unfounded.

Works great!  


Mine was in terrible shape (on the outside) so I carted it over to the
coin-op carwash and blew a roll of quarters on the pressure wash. 
Cleaned all the junk off real nice.


I would clean the inside like any other fermenter, i.e. carboy brush, tsp,
b-brite, bleach solution, etc.  If you use bleach, don't overdo the
concentration or the contact time, and rinse well.


BTW, that's a #11 stopper you'll need in case you were wondering.

Subject: Malty flavor / RIMS vs Decoction


     Hello again,
     
     Chas talks about caramelization of the wort during a decoction adding 
     to its maltiness.  To my palate, caramel does NOT taste malty.  Malt 
     flavors can even be masked by excessive caramel, although malt 
     perception might be increased by small amounts of caramel.
     
     Beers like Spaten Ur-Maerzen and Optimator are excellent examples of 
     malty beers with little or no caramel notes.  Paulaner Oktoberfest 
     tends to be more caramel-like.  Compare these beers to each other and 
     you'll see the difference.  It's a tough job, I know...
     ----------------------------
     The RIMS vs. Decoction experiment is very interesting. I would love to 
     see it done with a step infusion, too.
     
     Chas' suggestion that the RIMS beer may have been perceived as being 
     maltier because of wort caramelization is possible, but as I said 
     above, the two flavors really are quite different.  I was wondering if 
     the boiling/hopping parameters were identical, as that could effect 
     hop utilization and thus effect perceived maltiness.
     
     As for the RIMS beer being darker, could it be that there was some HSA 
     occurring?  That would darken the wort.  Or perhaps Chas is right, and 
     the wort was being caramelized a bit.
     
     By the way, Dr. Pivo is spelled PIVO, and my name is DE PIRO.  I don't 
     know who this "Dr. Piro" is.  Perhaps some sort of bizarre hybrid...
     
     Have fun!

Subject: Shorter brew day tip/question


I am always trying to find little improvements to make my beer better and 
my brew day shorter. This past weekend, I tried something new. I have a 
three tier converted sanke Newtonian (Gravity) system with propane burners. 
I crush the grain and pour the water the day before brewing.


This time I placed a table top, two ("calrod" type unit) portable electric 
stove on a timer under the mash tun and turned it on high. I set the timer 
for 5 AM and awoke at 7:30 to find the temperature of the mash water was 
140F. Not bad. Heating up to mash in temp was very quick with the help of 
the propane burner, once the electric unit was removed.


The two nice things are that the water is brought close to mash-in temp and 
there is no need to vent the room, since the electric burners produce no 
fumes. It shortened my brew day by at least a half.
hour.




Now a separate question: Is there any general reason we wouldn't fill our 
mash and sparge tanks from the Hot Water tap? Microbrewies take water from 
a hot water tank which keeps the water at a high temperature at all times. 
Am I the only person who has used cold tap water for my brewing water? Any 
pros/cons? My water heater is a gas unit.

Thanks Al, we (newbies) needed that.  Being on this list for four months,
I have seen beginners go from a pot, two buckets and some bottles to
spending big $ (kegs, fridge, etc.)  in an effort to "catch up" with the

priming sugar and bottle?  or add the yeast, let it rest for X amount of
time, prime then bottle, or what?  Private email okay.

Subject: RE: Vitamin C, Oxygen and Homebre / Corriander


        Dan Cole brought up the idea of adding Vitamin C to homebrew.
Although I havn't done this I have seen at least on recipe from the
Winners Circle in Zymurgy with vitamin C so I assume it works.  However, I
would prefer not to throw a vitamin tablet into my beer.  This question
got me thinking about a comment that I read by Charlie Papazian.  He
suggested adding 1 tsp of crushed corriander to the mash to fight
oxidation.  He suggests that corriander is a strong antioxidant (as well
as cinnamon) and this small amount would be below the taste threshhold. 
(Article in Zymurgy summer 1996)
        So, has anyone tried this.  I would like to do an experiment were
I add the corriander to half a batch, and nothing to the other half and
then splash the beer when bottling a few bottles.  My method would be
slightly different then Papazians method because I would be adding a hop
tea at bottiling instead of in the mash but it should work for a quick and
dirty experiment.  The problem is due to personal situations I will not be
brewing for about 4 months (no dont cry for me, I'll survive somehow)  so
if someone else wants to try this go for it, otherwise I'll report in the
fall.
