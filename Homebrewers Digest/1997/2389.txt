This is mostly right except for the pH effect from sulphates.  It's the
calcium in the Burton-upon-Trent water that causes the mash pH to go down
and not the sulphates.  It's true that Burton water is high in sulphates
but it's also high in calcium.  Gypsum is calcium sulphate and again,
the calcium is the ion that reacts with the mash to lower the pH.  Other
than that, yes, carbonate water requires the more acidic, darker grains
to get a more reasonable mash pH (Dublin is an even better example with
carbonate levels upwards of 700 and they are famous for their stout).

The risk with raising the temperature too fast is scorching.  Traditionally,
the rate among commercial brewers has been 1 degree C per minute (if I
remember correctly from one of George Fix's articles).

Across the street from Brains brewery there is a corner pub which serves
well over a dozen guest beers from all over Wales and England.  Very
upscale decor (Saloon bar) so you may feel a little odd in cutoffs and
a t-shirt.  Great food, too!

Isn't it the high-molecular-weight proteins that contribute to haze and
not the medium-weight?  Also, simply saying "Pale Ale" malt is incompleat
(yes, arcane, but I like it).  I find that DeWolf-Cosyns Pale Ale malt
is far less modified than many *Pilsner* malts.  When I use DWC Pale
Ale malt, if I don't do a protein rest (I do it at 135 to 140F), I get
a half-gallon of cold break in the fermenter!  This is far too much, in
my opinion and this is why I have taken to doing a protein rest with
this malt whenever I use it.

I believe (working under the assumption that HMW proteins are responsible
for cold break and haze) that it does not hurt to break down those HMW
proteins down to MMW proteins.  I have not noticed problems with chill haze
on any of these beers, in fact, I believe that protein rests will only
decrease chill haze.  Comments?

Just for the record, I think that the judging at the AHA Nationals tends
to be variable, I too have had the AHA lose scoresheets, but California
has had more than it's share of AHA 1st-place ribbons: except for last
year when the Chicago Beer Society won the HB Club of the Year Award,
the Sonoma Beerocrats were 9-time winners, if I'm not mistaken.

I tried blaming that kind of ring on proteins, but later found that it's
bacterial... it's some kind of aerobic bacteria, I think.  Try switching
to filtered air or oxygen for aerating/oxygenating and see if that doesn't
fix the problem.

I have an article on this very subject in the May/June 1996 issue of
Brewing Techniques.  You can read the article for the details, but the
bottom line is that even experienced judges found that bitterness was
the only difference.  Tests at the Siebel Institute backed up these
findings.  Protein, higher alcohol, and ester levels were not that
different.  Blowoff reduced IBUs by 13 to 18%.


Also, don't believe what Dave says about blowoff tubes being sources of
infection... I use 1" ID blowoff hoses and they may be stained but
all the crud comes off from a 1-day soak in bleach water.  Furthermore,
how could the infection crawl out of the tube and into the fermenter?


***
This reminds me that a few months ago, Dave asked what yeasts produce
spores... since I'm at home nursing a slipped disk (brewing related, but
not from heavy lifting), I can wobble over to the library and get
MBS.


>From page 529... Saccharomyces, Pichia, Hansenula, and Sporobolomycetes
are some of the genera that form spores.  Incidentally, this last genus
of yeast form ballistospores.  Could this be the way that infections get
from the blowoff tube to the wort?  ;^)


I also happen to know (thanks to Jim Liddil) that the difference between
Brettanomyces and Dekkera genera are that the former does not form spores
whereas the latter does.

Subject: decoction and wheat


the decoction thread has been excellent, the best thing we've had here in a 
while . . .


 a question: does decoction offer lautering benefits when using mashes 
containing a relatively high (50 - 70%) proportion of malted wheat?  given the 
discussion, if there's no lautering benefit, i may start experimenting with 
infusion mashed weizen . . .  it would be nice to be able to chop a bit of time 
off the process.

I should have written (and spelled) 'sub-aleurone' - mea culpa.
Beta-amylase is found in the endosperm. Protein and enzyme
concentration in malt both decrease at you go deeper into the starchy
endosperm.  Aleurone tissue is listed as a BA source in the Enzyme
Handbook, tho' it's concentration is not.  But BA is not, from my
reading available within in the starch granules per se. Is it part of
the starch granule surface?


The version of the 'neat story' that I have seen in the reviewed
literature is that it has been known since the 1940s that another
hydrolase, a papain-like protease is responsible for freeing BA from a
larger protein, and that virtually all of the BA present in malt is
also present in the raw grain endosperm. A large fraction, but not all
is in this bound form.  The activity of the freed BA increases
dramatically.  I have several recent papaers showing that there are
several isoenzymes of BA formed this way - different molecular
weights, possibly differentiated by proteolysis.


I'd be most interested in reading the reference source of Simons'
description for further information.  It's certain that my
understanding in this area is incomplete.  Is a limited hydrolysis
with enzymes supplied by the aleurone layer the first step making the
endosperms granule surface matter soluble when malting ?  Or can the
endosperm absorb water and enzymes without enzymatic degradation from
the aleuone tissue?


>>>Alpha-amylase is formed in the embryo and concentrated near the

 ...

>>that is the best amylase tissue for the embryo and it is the organ that

The scutellum is listed as part of the embryo in the source I've just
checked [do I need a new reference?].  It is the portion of the embryo
at the embryo/endosperm layer just as I've indicated.


Actually if I'd read my M&BS more closely I'd have realized that they
estimate that 85% OF AA is from the aleurone and 15% from the
scutellum. This surprises me.


>>www.bio.psu.edu/faculty/gilroy/lab.html
Some nice stuff here and on the links to Jones Lab at UC Berkeley.


Thanks for the correction, sincerely, and even more for the improved
understanding.

Re: the original HBD topic tho - the realization that the aleurone
layer is the most significant source of AA doesn't detract from the
argument that AA is largely soluble shortly after cracked malt hits
the mash water.

Subject: Electric Immersion Chiller


With the summer weather just around the corner, I 
will no longer have the luxury of tap water that is
<40F.  A discussion with a friend, who is well-versed
in air-conditioning technology, resulted in the idea
that we could construct an immersion chiller from


1) a recycled air-conditioner
2) a plate-sytle heat exchanger
3) a copper-coil immersion wort chiller
4) a circulator pump
5) propylene glycol (anti-freeze 50/50 might just do)


The idea would be to run the coolant from the air
conditioner through one side of the heat exchanger
and the glycol through the other.  The glycol would
be circulated through the wort chiller coil.


How many BTUs does it take to chill 10 gallons of 
wort from boiling to 70F, in a reasonable time?  
I'll only attempt this project if it can be done 
with a 110v unit.


Has anyone else done anything like this?


Am I nuts? 


Is my beer ruined? <g>


Should I build a counterflow chiller instead?

I've been contemplating proteases and peptidases and alpha and beta amylase,
how they work. My understanding is that the beta amylase and peptidase
(herafter referred to as "beta protease" per a related thread) "nibble" at
the ends of the starches and protiens, producing only single sugars and amino
acids, while the "alpha" proteases and amylases "chop" large strings into
smaller ones. Being of an analytical bent (and having entirely too much time
on my hands) I built a little computer model to compare and contrast beta and
alpha activity.


Starting with a population of molecule chains all of length 300 and letting
either the alpha or beta "enzymes" loose for a few hundred iterations, I
found that the beta enzymes left with you with a lot of single molecules, a
fair number of really big molecules, and NOTHING in between. In the protien
department, this translates to 
plenty of yeast nutrition, a good amount of break, but no mouth feel. In
contrast, the alpha run showed a fairly uniform distribution of molecule
lengths. The single molecule numbers were still 75% of the beta run (little
yeasties are far from starving) but break should be greatly reduced, and
mouth feel greatly increased.


Bottom line: I'm not going to worry about the beta range in protien rests any
more, although there's still a balance to be struck in starch conversion. I
have had some very tasty beers with very poor head retention lately, and I
think the 122 deg rest is the culprit. I rested my last brew at 135 deg, and
I'll bet I'll see a big improvement.


Thanks for indulging my long windedness. My little exercise helped my
understanding of brewing chemistry. I hope it didn't bore y'all too much :)

Subject: Alt recipe


Greeting collective homebrewing (sub/un)conscience:


I recently made an extract Alt. FWIW, here's the recipe:
6.6#        Northwestern Amber LME
1#        40L Crystal
1/3#        Chocolate
2 oz        8.8% N. Brewer pellets (60 mins)
2 pkg        Munton's dry yeast
Four days in primary (68 F), eleven in secondary (45-50 F)


It turned out rather nicely, but I would like to make it more
authentic. I don't have immediate access to Ireks extract, plus it is
almost twice as expensive as Northwestern. To improve this recipe, I'm
going to try a liquid yeast (Wyeast German Ale or European Ale). I
also thought of ditching the crystal malt and replacing it with a
pound or so of Munich malt and do a partial-mash. Would this give me
the flavor I'm looking for, or would I need more Munich? (And would I
need a protein rest, or can I do a single-step infusion with Munich?)


I'm trying to find Zum Uerige (sp?) or the like so I can get a better
idea of what I should be shooting at. I've tried August Schell
Schmaltz Alt and Summit's Duesseldorfer-Style Altbier. They were
entirely different, and I'm not sure which one is more "stylistically
correct." I'm not _overly_ anal about getting the style absolutely
perfect, OTOH I don't just want a glorified amber ale, either.


I've seen a lot of Alt recipes with hop additions for flavor and aroma
(some even with dry-hopping). Am I right in my understanding that an
Alt is to have very little or no hop flavor and aroma at all, just big
bitterness?


Thanks as always,
  Matt

Subject: March in Montreal / Planispiral chiller / Black and Tan / lost mail


Hi all, 
        I recieved some mail from someone about corporate sponsorship for 
the Canadian Amateur Brewers Association. I deleted it accidentally 
before getting the information back to the individual in question. I now 
have the answers if you're out there...


- ----------------------


Does anyone know how a Black and Tan works? Apparently pouring Guiness 
on top of Smithwicks creates a layered beer which is stable. I've never 
seen one myself, but viscocity alone won't explain it to my satisfaction. 
And if the SG of Guiness is higher (is it?) it should sink to the bottom. 
Any thoughts?


- ------------


Some of you may recall from a while back that I had some problems 
implementing Ed Hitchcock's planispiral wort chiller. This chiller is a 
copper tubing immersion chiller with all the coils in a plane circling 
towards the centre, suspended at the top of the wort. Cold wort on top 
creates a convective flow which obviates the need for stirring. 
        I believe the solution is as follows: Ed had all of his coils 
touching each other in a tight loop near the perimeter of his pot. My 
coils were fairly evenly spaced all the way to the centre of my bucket. 
In order for strong convection to form, it makes more sense to have a 
strong localised flux of heat, rather than a diffuse, weaker flux. Ed's 
works, mine didn't. I now have a counterflow chiller, so I don't intend 
to test this hypothesis, but anyone interested in building one is advised 
to keep their coils as closely spaced as possible. 
        Any experimental results from planispiral immersion chillers would be 
interesting to hear...

        Below are the results of the Canadian Amateur Brewer's 
Association's March in Montreal contest. Thanks to all who entered! 
Hopefully I'll be able to offer more warning in the future... In fact, 
here's some warning about our next event: The Great Canadian Homebrew

Subject: Incomplete conversion? Starch? - summary


Last week I reported that my first all-grain batch tasted disturbingly
starchy after the recirc-sparge.  If you recall, I did an iodine test which
was negative, so I proceeded to boil, cool, pitch and ferment.


Thanks to Nathan Kanous, John Mulholland, Tony Schmidt and Jim Thomas for
their advice, which was basically "Sounds like your beer is fine, perhaps
your were tasting 'grainy-ness' which is new to you at the moment; RDWHAHB."


This past weekend, I racked the beer into the secondary and diverted a sample
to take the SG and taste.  The SG read about 1.013 (from ~1.048-9) and the
taste was *delicious* - I was truly amazed at how good it was.  (If you are
hesitating about making the jump to all-grain, do it!  You'll be glad you did.)
Perhaps I just don't get fresh extract around here, but this AG batch is far
better than my best partial mash.


For the batch I made this weekend, I did a conversion test after 1.25 hrs 
(temp generally 152-149F).  The test was negative.  The wort, as the week 
before, has a grainy-ness to it.  This time I'm not worried.


BTW, I've only used a single-step infusion mash in these first two batches.  
I'm using Canadian Malting 2-row.  What would I gain from, say, a 15-30 min 
rest at around 135F.  Is it worth the effort?

Subject: Bittering Hops - what's the difference? / Hop Survey


I'm going to be making a bulk order for whole hops from a mail-order source
to build up a general selection of hops on hand in my freezer.  I understand 
the obvious reasons to have a selection of aroma and flavour hops, but I'm
not sure I'm aware of the reasons for choosing various bittering hops.


1.  Is the bitterness produced (for a set IBU level) by different hops
significantly different?  If so, in what way?  The spec sheets often mention
aroma... isn't the aroma contribution of the bittering hops pretty much boiled
off?


2.  For example, 2 pale ales made identically except one uses XX IBUs of
say, Galena, and one uses XX IBUs of Northern Brewer; both have 1 ounce of
EKG as finish.  How would the two beers compare?


Having said all that, it's time for an HBD survey.  If you were setting up a 
'pantry' of hops for the next several months' brewing of ales (all kinds: 
British Mild to American IPA to Scottish Wee Heavy to Belgian Wit and
Bavarian Weizen), what kinds of hops would *you* buy?  Try not to get overly 
specific and suggest the accepted standards for each ale style.  What 4-6 
hop varieties would you buy?  Concentrate on versatility and quality.  
I'll post the results.

Subject: Shorter brew day


In response to Randy Reed's quest for a shorter brew day, here's what I've
been up to.
I've brewed almost 100 batches since switching to all-grain, and since the
third batch I've split my brew day into two days.  I mash and sparge one
evening, cover the collected wort, and leave until the next day.  I then
boil, chill and pitch the following evening. By doing this I can brew
during the week and have two leisurely evenings of brewing related activity
rather than one long tiring day of brewing on a weekend.  Even when I do
brew on a weekend I would split the session in two: mash & sparge on Fri.
eve., for instance, then boil, etc. on Saturday morning.


By breaking the session up like this you can clean everything up after day
one, and then day two is almost like an extract brewing session.  I've
never noticed any problem with malt flavor, stability or anything from
leaving the wort overnight.  There's not enough time for bacteria to do
anything to the wort, and you'll soon be sterilizing it in the boil.  I
have barley wines over two years old made with this method and absolutely
no signs of hot side aeration or oxidation of any type.  Try it once and see!


The only thing is if you're into first wort hopping, I don't know how this
method would work.  I just started doing this and have done
straight-through brewing sessions because I wasn't yet comfortable with the
idea of hopping and then leaving the wort overnight.

Subject: 1997 National Homebrew Competition


First, I would like thank everyone for their input on this topic.  We were
only attempting to protect the individual homebrewers/entrants.  We realize
that this may not be possible to do.  Let me explain our motives for making
any change to the NHC rules.


The reason that we changed the NHC rules is that the AHA was contacted by
one of the NHC winners who informed us that his recipe was printed in
another publication without any attribution to him or the award that he
won.  He asked for our assistance.  While we encourage the printing of NHC
winners' recipes in other publications, we do want to ensure that the
homebrewer and the award that he or she won gets attributed correctly.  As
a standing policy and as a
courtesy to the brewer, we ask each potential publisher to contact the
brewer directly and get his or her permission to print.


If you look at Rule F from last year, you will see that we only required
that the entrants "agree to allow (at no cost) publication of their recipe
by the Association of Brewers or any of its divisions in any publication. 
Entrant will receive all due credit."  This is all that the AHA wants to do
with any of the recipes.  But the wording wasn't strong enough to prevent
the un-attributed publishing of recipes.


We apologize for the confusion and I have passed the posted comments on to
people here responsible for the wording of the rules.  Thanks, again, for
all your input.


Keep Brewin'!

I would strenuously disagree with Charles and Ken.  I have brewed 5 batches
varying from a porter, a stout  two milds and an IPA and ALL have had a very
pronounced grapefruit taste.  Obviously the stout and porter suffered the
least as I use a large percent of roast- chocolate malt but the taste was
there.  The milds and IPA were almost undrinkable by anyone but me and I
will drink just about everything I brew-- some have been pretty disgusting.
I fermented all of the above at between 50 and 65f  my freezer is in my shop
and is not really temperature controlled when the outside temperature is
below the setpoint of the freezer.  This is not on the high side of
fermentation temp for ales.  I will not use this yeast again.  I will go
back to the other British yeasts.

Subject: RE: Setup in New House


Don Mille(r?) <milledon`at`ix.netcom.com> is building a basement brewery...


After 8 brewing years of dragging stuff up from the basement and setting up
on the back patio, then tearing it down I did what you're planning.  I'll
offer a few thoughts.  I basically installed our old kitchen cabinets in a
14x13 room in the basement.  I reused the old dishwasher and sink.  Had an
old fridge already and I left room for another.  I bought a SABCO RIMS
($$$) fitted for natural gas but I also installed a 2-burner electric
cooktop for starter prep/decoctions, etc.


Think about how you are going to get the four ancient elements in and out
of the brewery; earth, air, fire and water (well, skip the earth unless you
count spent grain).  You need to get water into the kettle and a lot of
waste water will be dumped down the drain (tub sink?, floor drain?).  Your
heat source, if gas, sucks up a lot of air and will need an exhaust fan.
Don't forget a CO detector in this case.  If electric, make sure your
outlet is GFCI protected.


Think about  clean up.  Before I just had vessels to wash and I hosed down
the patio.  Now I've got to clean up a room with lots of surfaces.  I don't
know what the best cleaning regime is yet.  I mop the floor and counter
with Ammonia.  I sanitzize glass and hoses with bleach, stainless with
idophor.  Finally, I use stainless cleaner on the kettles.  Stainless
cleaner is kinda neat; it is basically water, silicone and mineral oil
aeresol.  Safe for widows and orphans.

Subject: glass grenades? & distilling questions


followed my usual ale procedure, had a great ferment, waited 13 days to
bottle and at the end of a 10g bottle finally remembered to take a SG. 
Shock!!!!   My 1.054 OG stout and porter had finished at 1.022, much
higher than the usual 1.015 or so. 


I finished with the last several bottles a bit perplexed and eventually
thot I'd better check my basement fermenting temperature.....the usual
66F or so was reading 60F at floor level.


With a large starter of Wyeast 1084 Irish, generous pure O2 aeration,
all grain process for plenty of FAN, a low brewing temperature seems the
only possibility for a 1.022 finish?  Am I missing something?


If the storage conditions warm up and the ferment drops 6 pts or so in
the bottle, do I have very fizzy stout, gushers, or glass grenades?


Second question,  a hbing friend is asking about distilling and whether
an early fraction of the distillation should be discarded to avoid being
blinded or worse.  I remember a distilling thread from HBD's past but if
someone has a good reference or summary of the topic, please share it

I too have become disgusted with the AHA.  Several posts on

I recieved my AHA membership expiration notice last night.  At the bottom
it says that the AHA is "a membership driven organization".  You'd have a
difficult time convincing me of that these days.  Nothing about the AHA is
membership driven with the exception of the contribution of monies to their

There is clearly only one effective course of action for us to take if we

aquaintance with the guidelines.  I know that you will find the original
gravities of many of the winning beers to be as much as twice the
highest guideline original gravity .  Calculate the bittering and compare
it to the guidelines and you will see that many of the beers appear to be
overhopped.  Many of the recipes have ingredients which are not
approptiate to syle.


Steve I guess based on the recipes that have been published in Zymurgy
that none of us know how to judge beer.  Maybe though, the beers
were presented so cold that they couldn't be judged properly and that is
the fault of the AHA!

Brethren,  


I've recently been given a gas grill and was wondering about the 
possibility of converting it to an outdoor cooker.  Ideally what I 
would like to do is convert it so that it has two burners.  Has 
anyone had any experience with a conversion like this?

Recently I have been asked, a couple times, what style of ales/lagers are
most commonly kegged at the homebrew level.  Bitters, Pale Ales and such
lighter English styles seem to be the most popular to keg, but I was
interested in what others on this forum like and don't like to keg in cornie
kegs.  Its fairly obvious that stronger beers would be candidates for the
bottle, because of their long term evolution, but has anybody out there
kegged those for the long run?


Also has any body used Isinglass in liquid form that hasn't been kept in
refridgeration?
Does it spoil?  Any feedback is appreciated.
TIA
