Subject: Pressure decoction - further thoughts


Seeing a new post from Charlie Scandrett (the hidden Imam of the HBD)
after so long, is one of the best things to come out this discussion.
Conversations with others of you have been stimulating and fruitful.
Here's some of the fallout.


In HBD #2390 Jeff Renner states:
> and Wahl mention that as being done with cereal mashes.  I'm a little
> concerned with getting too dark a beer for style, but I like the idea of
> not using Munich malt, which I have been using at ~10%.


Steve Alexander, privately, and Charlie both state that many desirable
maillard compounds are not formed at boiling temperatures, but require
higher temps to form.  This is consistent with the high kilning
temperatures of Munich malt at 238F (144C)  which also undergoes some
saccharification in process to encourage forming these.  Didn't someone
recently compare them to little grain sized decoction packages?  In
pressure cooking the decoc one is developing the same flavor compounds
that Munich malt lends.  The protein rest at 135F (57C) will also help
develop some of the body MM contributes.  So you could omit  the MM and
develop its contributions yourself.  The process will still lend color
but you could control that by fiddling with the heat/pressure it's
cooked at and by experimenting with time. Do-it-yourself Munich malt.
Biscuit too.


Steve Alexander also made a (potentially) brilliant suggestion regarding
pressure cooked decocs which I'll check out experimentally.  Since my
last femto-decoc was already canned, why not use it later? [Light Bulb
ON]  I'll prepare and pressure can another batch of decocs, going
through the same ritual as last time; protein rest, saccharification
rest, pressure cook, and see how they keep and taste after a few days, a
week, a month...  The idea being that made in advance, they might be
stored until I want to add a decoc to my mash. Then, just fish out a
couple jars of decoc, toss it in after the protein rest and go straight
to sugar conversion.  Instant decoc!  This in half-gallon or gallon
mason jars might be practical.


BTW, a datapoint I forgot to mention; the mash pH after pressure canning
fell from 5.2 to 4.9.  If tasting tells, I didn't notice tannin flavors.


Several people have asked about the canner I use.  First of all I was
mistaken about the size.  Mine is a 21 quart canner.  The pot I cook
with inside holds only three gallons. This forces me now to do multiple
decocs to get a good percentage of grain cooked (unless pre-canning
works).  But since the process is easy, I'll do it.  The canner is
machined aluminum with six screw-clamps to hold the lid down.  The lid
has a pressure guage, a release and a safety plug.  Once the release is
thrown closed after venting, pressure builds and is controlled by heat.
I maintain 250F (121C) with a small 1/8" (2.5mm) flame for the duration
of the cooking.  It's silent in use.  I recommend the product without
reservation.  It was about $100 new, six years ago.  They make larger
and smaller sizes.  Here's the details:

On a different topic, Randy Reed asks:
> Has anyone improved the heat transfer from propane fired converted sanke 
> kegs? 


Cut the bottom off of a 55-gallon, or smaller, drum and then cut a wide
circular opening out of the other end that just admits your keg.  This
can be dropped over your keg and heater to act as a jacket to contain
the heat you are losing out of the sides of your kettle and which is
also flowing up from underneath it.  A fellow Brews Brothers (tm)
reported big heat efficiency gains with this.  I'm still scrounging for
a good drum.

Subject: Tip for CP Bottling in PET Bottles


I have several 500 ml plastic PET soft-drink bottles that I like to use for
bringing counter-pressure bottled kegged homebrew to meetings and elsewhere.
 They're more convenient than glass bottles since the caps screw on, saving
capping time and effort as well as the caps themselves.  After sharing a
sample of the beer, the bottle can be recapped, preserving carbonation, or
even put back into the cooler without worrying about spills.  Problem I found
was that the openings of these bottles is larger than the #2 stopper
typically used on CP bottlers (including the one presented on my web page).
 What I did was to take the top of one of these PET bottles and drill a 5/8"
diameter hole in it.  This became my "bottling cap".  Now, when I fill a PET
bottle, I first place the "bottling cap" on the empty bottle, fill using the
CP bottler seated in the 5/8" hole, and then replace the "bottling cap" with
the original cap.  Incidentally, the same cap size can be used with bottles
up to 2 litres.

Subject: amimo acid/carbohydrate flavor compounds part 1


All,


This is about browning reactions. Amino acids play a big role in these
reactions so it's useful to review a few basics.  Twenty of the amino
acids are the fundamental units of all proteins.  These 20 are the
`at`alpha amino acids'.  Several other amino acids and related compounds
have important functions in plants including barley, but since I don't
have any quantified data on the concentration it's pretty pointless to
detail these other compounds at this time.  It's fair to say that many
of these other amino compounds are rather simple transformation of the
alpha-amino acids, may have the same breakdown products and similar
effects on browning.  Others are distinctly different.

]and Pierce 1963 Proc.Eur.Brewery Conv.Congr., Brussels, p101.
]
]The ppm column can be mulitplied by 0.118 for a crude comparison with
]the first mg/dL column - this presumes HB 8#/5g wort and a 6.25X from
]nitrogen to amino acid weight.
]
]The two columns labelled mg/dL are the free amino mass in wort in
]milligrams per decliter. The first column is for wort, the second for
]boiled hopped wort From M&BS v2, table 14.5, from Sandegren et al,
]1954, Proc.Ann.Meet.Am.Soc.Brewing Chem.,v63.  Note that the aspartic,
]threonine, valine increase, probably due to hops contribution.  In
]unhopped boiled wort, alpha-amino acid drop by about 8% during the
]boil.  Note also the loss of arginine, glutamic, histadine, lysine
================================================


The above table shouldn't be overemphasized - it's just a typical wort
example and of course the total free amino acid concentration will
vary with the wort and malt.  The relative amounts of the various
amino acids will remain roughly similar.


Proline is in many ways the odd amino acids.  really it's an imine,
not an amine as the amino-nitrogen has one of it's bonds linked back
into the radical portion of the molecule.  Proline has some properties
in common with the aliphatic amino acid group (see below) and others
in common with the aromatics.  The high proportion of proline in wort
is just another oddity - for which I have no explanation.


I guess the observation that's important is that all of the amino
acids are available, tho there is a wide range of concentrations.
Proline is clearly the most abundant, but for reasons that will appear
later, may not have a dominant effect on flavor.

All,


At this point, since Charlie Scandrett has been roused from his long
silence into providing a lot of the chemistry background we really
need concurrently on HBD, I'll proceed to cover some of the flavor
issues.  I'll come back to the chemistry issues for emphasis later.

=============================


I have information for a less complete list at 180C, but I don't
believe it's worthwhile to reproduce here.  I'll let it go at noting
that at 180C the aroma profiles shift toward chocolaty and burnt
 or burnt caramel descriptions and a few (cysteine, methionine - the
suphur side chained aminos) become more like roast meat.


In addition, Malting & Brewing Science, hereafter referred to as M&BS
notes descriptions of amino compounds and unspecified sugars, made
under unspecified conditions as:


Ammonia - bitter
Glycine - reminiscent of bread crust or beers
alanine - bread crust
valine  - fine malt
leucine - malty or fresh bread
phenylalanine - dead roses (the aroma of phenylacetaldehyde)

The Summit's is truer to style, I think that Schell only called theirs
an Alt because it rhymed with the guys name. Jackson says that Grolch
Amber is a good representation of the style, and it is fairly easy to get.
I bought a case when it was on sale mainly for the bottles, and was 
pleasantly surprised by the taste. The style guidelines say that it should 
have little or no hop flavor or aroma.

Both the S.G. and the F.G. are lower than the ale that they are floating the 
stout on. Guiness Extra Stout has a S.G. of 1.040, and finishes at 1.008
I think that the draft version Starts at 1.038, but could not verify before
sending this.

I keg everything, even the strong beers. I will let a Wee Heavy Scotch Ale 
or Imperial Stout condition in the keg for a couple of months, then when I 
know that the carbonation level is right will CPF it to 22 oz bottles for home
consumption, and a few 12's for competition. The only time I have ever 
primed and bottled a whole batch was a Trappist style Tripple made with
Rajotte's triple-fermentation method.

I stand corrected.  Lesson learned.  One of the biggest principles of
brewing is keeping a clean area.  My wife wouldn't let the "discards" sit
in the house for more than it takes to brew.  


If there is anyone here in Denver brewing all-grain soon, send me some

        Scott..
After my trip to Scotland last year I just had to try using Peated Malt....
to the tune of 1Lb in a 5 gallon batch (I think it was the lighter smoked).
The beer was a Wee Heavy OG73 and fermented out to ~20 a tad sweet but very
rich. It smelled great while boiling and when botteling the bucket smelled
like a glass of good scotch.  The smoke wound up a bit mild but it was
there. I will use more next time.
PS.. I like Laphroaig a lot

McNeill's Brewery


In the article McNeil is discussing the method he uses to pitch using a
process he calls darauflassen / continuous brewing.


"McNeill says that the second of the two 5-bbl worts "needs to arrive at
the fermentor between 7 and 24 (preferably 16) hours after the first. At
that point, the yeast has passed through its lag phase and doubled in
number without yet reaching full fermentation activity. This pitching
schedule also reduces the risk of autolysis because the pitching rate was
right for the first batch and grows to the right level for the second
batch."


When does autolysis set in? Is autolysis taking place with some yeast
colonies while other yeast colonies are still multiplying?

Lurkers and Posters,


        I often collect the sludge at the bottom of my fermenters into
sterilised peanut butter jars and then store them in my beer fridge. If I
use it within a couple of days, I just re-pitch it as is; if it's a couple
of months later, I pitch it to a starter. I've never had any problems.
        This time however, I've piched a year old jar of Wyeast 2278 (Czech
Pils) on Wednesday afternoon, and it has only started to show some activity
this morning (Saturday). It's sitting at room temperature, since I want to
give it a good chance of reviving.
        Do you think I'm pushing it? Are one year old dregs basically dead?
Is there a sure fire way to know if this is 2278 yeast activity I'm seeing
or somekind of bacterial infection?
        I was thinking of letting it ferment out and then tasting the
starter "beer". I figure if there are any off flavors, I can throw it out,
if it tastes OK, I can use it.

Subject: Too much pressure in primary fermenter


Hi everyone.  I am brewing an all-extract, 6 gallon batch.  My bucket is
only 7 gallons, which has led to some pretty high pressure in the bucket.  A
little wort has seeped out through the seal around the airlock and some has
actually backed up into the airlock itself.  I'm most worried about the wort
in the airlock.  It's not much--the airlock is still only half full of
liquid, but I'm worried about any problems that could arise from this.


Should I be worried?  If so, what should I do (besides get a bigger bucket
next time)?  Thanks for your help.

Subject: A different type of decoction


Greetings Beer Lovers;


 At the risk of being branded a heretic,  I would like to describe an
unusual 'decoction' procedure for ales that I learned from a professional
brewer friend who works out of state.  He makes ales and wheat beers
exclusively and uses a fully modified pale ale malt as the base malt. 


 He starts with a  thin mash (about 1.5 qts/lb).  After a protein rest, he
pulls the LIQUID from the tun till the level in the tun drops by 1/3 and
then brings it to a full boil. Once the liquid reaches boiling, he  pulls
the hot break and then returns the liquid back to the mash tun to get to the
saccharification temp. He uses this procedure again at the end of the mash
to get to mash-out as in standard decoction procedures


 Those who truly like to experiment and/or break the rules might want to try
it . Certainly,  the work is a lot easier (no stirring) and you don't have
scorching problems. The brewer I learned this from was a true experimenter
who has made hundreds of batches at home trying variations of this technique
to achieve a strong malty flavor typical of decoction without so much work.
The method described was arrived at based on lots of tasting of the final
product. It certainly has been successful at his brewery.


  I realize that the first step should theoretically destroy the enzymes
early in the mash but the enzymes apparently don't know  this (having not
read M&BS) since the beers  produced this way have great flavor. The blond
ale and the heffe-weisen made with this method are two of the best tasting
light beers I ever tasted.


 More to the point I believe the method works for two reasons. First,
pulling 1/3 of the liquid from a 1.5 qt/lb mash still leaves a mash with
adequate amounts of water and thus enzymes. Second, the highly modified pale
ale base malt is rich in enzymes compared to the lager malts usually used in
decoction brewing, thus there are still plenty of enzymes left in the mash
after pulling the liquid. 


One thing that is not clear to me is why this technique leads to a higher
malty taste in the finished product but my brewer friend ensures me that
there is a big difference based on test batches made with and without this
process. Comments and/or flames anyone??

Subject: Apparent stuck barleywine


Fellow brewers:I have what is apparently a stuck fermentation on a barleywine. 
 This is my first barleywine, hence the inexperience.  The O.G. 1.115. After 
about a week of healthy fermentation, it slowed and has been at 1.048 for the 
last three weeks.  I used Wyeast London Ale #1028 with a large starter(3/4 
gallon).  
Questions:  -Should I pitch another strain(champagne or such)?  Should I let 
it go?(I only want it to drop another 15 points or so, and am afraid if I 
added a champagne yeast it would go a little further than that.)
Input into this would be appreciated.

Subject: amino acid/carbohydrate flavor compounds part 3


All,


A quick scan of the flavor/aroma tables of part 2 reveals some
interesting information.  First, generally speaking, there is some
limited similarity of flavors reported regardless of the type of
carbonyl compound (sugar) used.  Particularly in that the sulfur
containing amino acids produce some characteristic flavors.  It's also
very interesting that several flavors seem related to specific
carbonyls.  The description maple or maple syrup always appears in
association with glucose.  The description 'custard' is always related
to ribose.  This last isn't too surprising since custards'
characteristic flavor is due to 'damp baked' (to steal a description
from James Beard) egg yolks, and that egg yolk are rich in protein and
amino acids, but poor in sugars aside from the ribose which makes up
the 'backbone' of the RNA and DNA of the yolk.


The flavor/aroma descriptions point out that all of the aliphatic
amino acids (valine, leucine, alanine, isoleucine, glycine) are prime
candidates as contributors to the malt flavor and aroma. The cyclic
amino acid proline is another likely candidate.  The 'acidic' amino
acids asparagine and aspartic acid as well as serine and ornithine
also may be possible contributors to maltiness tho more doubtful. The
sulfur containing amino acids, cysteine and methionine, as well as
threonine may potentially produce negative aroma effects in beer.  The
rest seem more or less neutral. The flavor descriptions from the
referenced studies are subjective and can be manipulated by things
like concentration of the smell or taste.  Still there is enough
regularity in these results to consider them significant.


As an uncontrolled experiment I purchased some amino acids from a
health food store.  I was able to find a combination of L-leucine,
L-isoleucine and L-valine (540mg, 360mg, 300mg respectively per
capsule) sold as 'branched chain amino acids' BCAA.  I mixed 5 grams
of this amino acid mixture with 5 grams of glucose rich 'corn sugar',
as used in beer priming, and about 30cc of tap water, then heated this
in an ehrlenmeyer flask.  As the mix heated to near the boiling point
a definite and very pleasant malt aroma was evident.  Continued
heating eventually achieved a mild chocolaty/tootsie roll aroma.  I
should note that the amino mix has no aroma and a mild neutral
bitterness as a taste.  The color darkened only very slightly.


So what happens as the amino sugar mixture heats ?  What is the
temperature dependence ?  Are different amino acids converted into
flavor and aroma compounds at different temperatures ?


In a study on model systems prepared from single amino acids, Rohan
and Stewart,[ J.Food Science,1967,32,p625 ] prepared single amino
acids and glucose in 2:1 molar ratios.  They report that amino acid
destruction from heating is temperature dependent and nearly ceased
after one hour.  Sugar destruction continued at a nearly constant and
temperature dependent rate till the end of the experiment.  Some amino
acids (leucine, arginine, methionine and lysine) showed little or no
reaction at 1 hour at 100C(212F), While others were reactive at this
temperature - see table below).  As temperatures increased the rate of
amino acid degradation was measurable and proportional to the
temperature.  The amount of aminos destroyed above 140C(284F) was
noticeably greater than below.  This may be due to the fact that
glucose melts around 150C(302F) and its mixture with amino acids may
melt at lower temperatures.


"Percent Destruction of Amino Acids after Heating with Glucose for One
Hour"
Temp:  Ala   Phe   Threo Glu   Meth  Leu   Val    Arg  Lys
 80C                            0.9         7.0
 90C         13.9   2.0  11.1   0.9        14.0   1.5

130C   33.4  32.0  59.4  39.0  44.3  27.2  30.2  33.8  30.2
135C               90.0              39.9  42.5  04.0  44.5
140C   44.8  59.8        50.9  51.9
150C   76.9              62.1              51.5


The following table, also from Rohan and Stewart indicates that the
amount of amino degradation after one hour is related to the amino
acid structure ...


Class               120C      135C       150C


Sulfur               41                   52
Hydroxy              42        90
Acidic               36                   51
Aliphatic&         20-28      40-42.5     45
   Proline
Basic              20-29      40-50
Aromatic             23                   60


Since the aminos which *could* be responsible for the most negative
flavors are the sulfur containing group and threonine from the
hydroxyl containing group - it would appear that there is a potential
problem at 120C and above.  And that it's fairly clear that the flavor
mix could change drastically with temperature.


Moisture content plays a big role in the rates of amino acid
degradation too.  From Rohan and Stewart, dry mix of glucose and amino
acids lose about 30% of the amino acids in 1 hour at 100C.  Very
lightly moistened, the degradation drops to 9%.  With an equal weight
of water, the loss drops to trace amounts.


In another experimental note, Charles Rich reports good browning
flavor results by pressure cooking a micromash for 40 minutes.
Typical canning pressure is about 15psi over atmospheric, which
develops a temperature of just slightly over 120C.  The fact the
Charles did not experience flavor problems at this temperature is a
very good indication that some of the fears I've expressed above about
excessive 'bad' browning flavors from specific amino acid groups are
perhaps not realized in fact.  I intend to repeat Charles experiment
soon myself.  In private email Charles and I have both realised that
this technique also permits the production of canned browned decoction
wort which could be stored safe from infection and added to a later
mash for flavor and aroma effects.

Mine climb strings attached to the gutters on my 2-story house 
(south-facing wall). After they reach the top and don't have anything to 
hang on to, they keep growing and just hang down from the top of the string.


Yours'll grow no matter what they have to climb on. But I'd guess the 
flowers would do better with more sun and air circulation than they 
would get on a six foot fence. Most of the length will end up on the ground.


But, on the other hand, why not experiment? You can always dig 'em up and 
replant next spring.


Good luck,


Tony

Subject: oak in bierre de garde


I am making a bierre de garde and want to mimic the flavor achieved by
aging in an oak barrel.  My homebrew supplier suggested boiling about 4
oz of white oak nuggets and then putting them in the secondary with my
5 gal of beer for a week or two. 


Are there any homebrewers out there who have used oak nuggets in a
bierre de garde or other style who could share some experience or
expertise?
