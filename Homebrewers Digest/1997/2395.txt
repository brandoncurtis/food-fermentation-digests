Subject: digital thermometers


Greetings all!  Someone asked about digital thermometers yesterday and          
I thought I would throw in my $.02.  If this is the Polder thermometer          
with timer, temp and temp alarm it is a GREAT unit, if you take the             
necessary precautions.  Although nowhere in the documentation does it           
warn against immersing your probe in boiling or HOT liquid, don't do it!        


I verified with their cust. service dept. yesterday that the braided            
portion of the probe is not heat proof and the wires inside (well, the          
insulation) could melt and short the probe.  The solution is quite simple       
and much better.  First, straighten the curved portion of the probe, use        
a vise to make it nice and straight.  Now, go to your friendly hardware         
store and buy 3 things, a 30" lavorotory pick up tube (in plumbing section),    
a compression fitting for that tube (3/8 if memory serves) and an end cap       
for that fitting.  attatch one end of the comp fitting to the pickup tube,      
slide your probe through the tube until the end sticks out about 3", drill      
a small hole in the center of the end cap (just big enough to push the probe    
through, don't remember what size) and apply Dow Dap silicone to the inside     
of the cap so that any gap between the hole you drilled and the actual probe    
won't leak into the tube.  Now throw some teflon tape on the compression        
fitting and screw the endcap on with your probe.  As a precaution take a        
hose clamp and clamp the dangling braid to the top of the tube so that it       
doesn't pull out.                                                               


Voila!  You now have a 30" long RIGID probe for measuring different heights     
in your mash,  I would order an additional probe ($10) just to keep around      
the brewery for measuring wort samples and other things that a 3' long probe    
would make difficult.  Polders 800 number is 431-2133, the thermometer is       
model 632  (or polderwire`at`aol.com)                                              


The total cost for this modification is under $10

Subject: Where to classify Strong Scoth Ale with Rye?


Hi folks,
Just bottled a Strong Scotch Ale last night.
Difference in the recipe is a pound of flaked rye.
Turned out great!  Dark brown, malty and clear with 
a backgrounded "rye" taste.  Yumm!


Just wondering where in the AHA style guidelines 
this might fall, in case I entered it in a competition. 
Is it still a "10b"?

Subject: Brown vs Green bottles.


Homebrewers:


This has probably been covered here in detail, but I'm new to 
homebrewing so I apologize for my ignorance.  I'm about to try 
homebrewing and I have been saving green bottles from a popular 
European beer.  Now I'm hearing that brown bottles are better.  


Here's the rub, the beer will be stored in a dark place, so 
perhaps this is a moot point.  Any advice?


Thanks

Subject: PID temperature control for RIMS


Hello HBD!


I've recently made some improvements to my RIMS system that I wanted
to share with everyone.  I have recently added automated temperature 
control to my RIMS as well as upgraded my heating chamber (the first 
one was undersized).  The automatic temperature control is achieved 
using a PID temperature controller from Omega Engineering 
(www.omega.com).  Dion Hollenbeck first mentioned the idea of using a 
PID to me a few months ago (thanks for the idea, Dion!) and since I 
have not heard of it mentioned before I thought I would share my 
experience.


This nifty little device is perfect for those who don't want to or 
can't build their own Rodney Morris style temperature controller.  In 
fact, I'd venture to say that it is a better device than any other 
RIMS controller on the market for two reasons:


First, it actually learns how your system reacts to heating and it
adjusts itself so that it reaches your set point as quickly as
possible without overshooting it.  Other RIMS controllers I've seen
on the market require constant observation during temperature boosts
so that you can cut the power back a few degrees prior to reaching
your target temp and then it just maintains the temperature.  The
PID, on the other hand, is completely automated both during the
boost ("ramps") and during temp maintenance ("soaks").  PID stands
for Proportional, Integral, Differential, so it is actually using
calculus to "know" when to begin backing off on the power so as not
to overshoot your target temp. Furthermore, it has an auto-tune mode
where it learns how your system reacts to heating (for example oil
would take longer to heat than water) and it fills in the P,I, and D
variables so that it can reach your setpoint as quickly as possible
without overshooting.  You just dial in your set point temp and walk
away while it "ramps and soaks". If you are doing a step mash then 
you just set a timer and after it goes off you dial in the next 
target temp and walk away.


Second, it has a digital LED temperature display.  This is just neat 
because you can visually keep an eye on your mash temperature without 
having to check a thermometer.  Plus you can watch the temp rise and 
then hold steady as the PID does its magic.  This same digital 
display is also used when you dial in your target mash temp.


Anyway, I just wanted to share this idea with everyone.  If you are
interested in more details, I have updated and improved my RIMS web
page (address below).  Information including photos, where I bought
the parts, prices, and specific part numbers are included.  I've
done a lot of updating of my RIMS web page so even if you've seen it
before I'd appreciate some feedback regarding the general look. 


Happy Brewing!

Subject: What makes a nut brown a "NUT" brown


- --I'm working up a recipe that hopefully comes close to DownTown Brown
from 
the Lost Coast Brewing Co in Eureka CA. They call it a "nut" brown, I
call 
it malty and chewy, lightly hopped and yummy. Any advice on giving it a 
"nutty" flavor (no I won't add pecans).--


Asks Charley.


I've found that adding small (1/4 pound per 5 gal) amounts of choc malt
or toasted malt (20 min or so at 300 or so) adds a nutty flavor.

Subject: gravity


A couple of days ago a friend and I were bottling our
first partial mash (English bitter). I figured it was
ready for bottling because of the minimal amount of
activity in the air lock. We did not take a hydrometer
reading until the priming sugar and beer were in the
bottling bucket (oops). Our first reading was 1.02 which
was a little high for our tastes. We decided to take 
another reading at the end of bottling thinking that
the first reading may have had an overdose of priming
sugar. To our surprise the second reading was almost
1.04. This really blew our minds. Does anyone have
any idea why this might have happened. Your comments
would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Hot water


Randy:


The "reasons" given to me for not using hot water from the tap are:


1): The hot water picks up more lead from the plumbing than cold water.
2): The water picks up more mineral content while being stored in the
"crusty" tank.    #2 does NOT make sense to me.


Anyway a $15 whole house water filter with a $4 carbon cartridge will
remove enough lead and chlorine from your water to make it safe more
usable and quite tasty.  It may remove some of the mineral content you
want in your beer, but if you are into treating your brew water
anyway...


AND If you "plumb the filter with tubing and use a female hose connector
on the "in" side you can use the filter 'bout anywhere, kitchen sink,
outide hose etc.

followed by rests at 60C (140F) and 70C (158F).  This is not

George confirmed the 50-60-70 scheudle in materials he presented 
in a seminar I produced a few years ago.


On the decoction thread, Dr. Fix recently sent me a copy
of an article with lots of very interesting data on a 
number of points that Dr. Pivo (sorry about that earlier
misspelling, BTW), Steve A., and other have raised.
Check it out:


G. Sommer, "Trials for the Optimisation of Mashing Procedure,"
Brauwelt International 1986 (1), p. 23.


This article details Henninger-Brau AG's evaluation of
infusion v. decoction mashing, both in laboratory and 
brewhouse conditions.  (It concludes that the qualitative 
differences in beers produced with decoction vs. infusion 
mashes were "extradinordinally small," and that, "based on a 
large number of tasting trials it could be confirmed that the 
taste was not changed" by converting from decoction to infusion
mashing.


This article contains lots of good info on other aspects of 
mashing, incluing the 50-60-70 schedule and data that 
contradicts the notion that thick mashes contribute 
anything *except* in the rare case where you need to do 
a protein rest.  Well worth reading.


Finally, I'm still searching for a source of the yeast used in
Adnam's Extra.  If anyone knows of a commercial source for this
or has a sample in their yeast bank, please drop me a line.

Subject: Re: Steeping versus Partial-Mash


John Sullivan <sullvan`at`anet-stl.com> writes that he feels steeping specialty
grains is "not a sound method for a brewer looking to advance his technique"
because "Steeping grains is:

I don't agree with this.  Understanding the benefits of moving to steeping as
a method requires that you keep in mind that the brewer is likely coming from
'kit-brewing'.  Steeping allows much greater control over the brewing process
than does kit brewing.  I think it's the natural step in improving brewing
technique and understanding.  True, you cannot steep all types of grains, but
crystal, chocolate, roasted barley and black patent offer the improving
brewer with a myriad of recipe possibilities.  As for the extraction crapshoot,
I hardly think this is going to cause any loss of sleep; the amount of 
additional points is minimal.  Unconverted starch is only a problem if 'mash-
only' malts are steeped.


>It is a simple move from steeping to partial mashing.  Partial mashing 


Perhaps this is true in retrospect to an all-grainer, but I beg to differ.
Steeping takes little more than 30 mins to accomplish.  You generally heat 
your brewing water to dissolve the extracts before boiling anyway, so the
added time is from crushing and steeping.  Partial mashing is far more time
consuming.  The mash itself takes more than 30 mins, then there is recirc.,
runoff and sparge to consider.  It also requires additional equipment and it
is much more involved technique-wise.  To a newbie who is already finding the 
tasks of cleaning and sanitizing arduous, I think the move to partial mashing 
is a big one.


John then states:


>somewhat in the same fashion as you would for an all grain batch.  Though

Despite lacking the obvious possibilities of improved body, head-retention and
maltiness (say by the addition of Munich malts), steeping is a great way to
achieve flavour enhancement.  While I do not in any way disagree that moving
to partial-mashing has it's advantages, I don't think it's necessarily a
better choice than moving to steeping.  I like the steeping method because it's
also a good way to introduce the use of hops rather than hopped extracts.


If you are a newbie that has his sights on becoming an all-grain brewer as
fast as possible, then by all means jump into partial-mashing right away.  But,
be aware that your brew day will increase in complexity considerably.  If you
are simply interested in improving your understanding of recipe formulation 
and what ingredients 'make a porter taste like a porter', I don't hesitate to 
recommend the steeping method.

Hi all,


A friend will be getting married in mid-May and just asked me if I could
brew some beer for the wedding.  Given the short notice (5 weeks), I'm
pretty limited on the types of beer I can brew.  I'm interested in some
feedback on 2 or 3 styles that will mature quickly enough to be ready for
the wedding.  I plan to brew some sort of ale this weekend, give it 7 days
in the primary, about 7 days in the secondary and 3 weeks to mature in
bottles (I don't have kegs).


My limited experience has been that some ales need much more than 3 weeks
to mature, at least that's been the case for my "darker" ales such as
porter and brown ale.  I'm guessing that a lightly hopped fruit ale using
fruit extract might work ok since the extract might cover up any of the
"harshness."  Any other suggestions on styles, or even general guidelines
for what I should/shouldn't do?

Subject: Cooler mash tun/Aluminum brew ware


Hi all,


First, thanks for all the great advice and discussion. I've learned a lot
in three or four short months.


In HBD #2393, John Sullivan <sullvan`at`anet-stl.com> gave a nice explanation
on how to use a "lemon ade" cooler to partial mash. This brought to mind
some questions I have about moving into partial- and all-grain brewing.


I've been thinking about converting a Gott cooler into a mash/lauter tun
and I've done a lot of searching through the HBD archives and the Brewery's
technical library. One of my questions is how much does tun size (i.e.,
volume) affect mashing. Specifically, is a five gallon cooler going to be
too big to effectively partial mash? I'm thinking in terms of the depth of
the grain bed. Is there a minimum amount of grain (and mash water) that
needs to be used? Economically, purchasing and modifying a five gallon
cooler makes a lot of sense (at least to me). When the time comes when I'm
ready to go all grain, I'll be equipped. This of course begs another
question: If I'm going to invest the time and do a partial mash, why not go
to a full mash?


In shopping around, the Gott coolers seem to be very elusive, at least in
NYC. The new Kmart near Madison Square Garden does carry Igloo coolers,
however. (We're very proud of our new Kmart.) Are these comparable to the
Gott?


TIA. Any and all comments, suggestions and advice will be greatly
appreciated. Private e-mail is fine. I'll post a summary.

In HBD #2391, Russ Brodeur <r-brodeur`at`ds.mc.ti.com> noted some apprehension
about using an aluminum pressure cooker for decoctions. Russ, I think the
rumours that link Al with Alzheimer's have been greatly exaggerated
(apologies to Mark Twain).


<soapbox>
I think this may turn out to be another case of junk science, right up
there with cold fusion.
</soapbox>


AFAIK, there has been no direct evidence pointing to a causal link between
the two. Although the cause is still unknown, most research into the
cause(s) of AD focuses on genetic factors--it is inherited in some
families--and the role of proteins in the brain that seem to contribute to
the formation of the tangles and plaques that are the hallmarks of the
disease.


I think you'll be OK. Personally, I think life's too short to worry about
getting AD from aluminum. In fact, one researcher plotted age of onset of
AD against population lifespan and figured that if people lived to be 130
or 140 years old, everybody would develop Alzheimer's! (Although, this I
also take with a grain of salt.)

yes, but would you agree that *if* you could avoid the balling problem, that 
extremely finely ground malt, not including the husks, would
saccharify quicker (like, before all the enzyme population is decimated) 
than very coarsely ground malt?  this is the ideal that al k was referring to.


this idea comes from different homebrewing books and articles, where the 
"ideal" crush is said to be crushing the non-husk portion of the malt
as finely as you can without destroying the husk too much.  six roller malt
mills are employed to get closer to this ideal crush.  otherwise why would 
the big guys use six roller mills?  what sort of tremendous "balling" problems
are the big guys using six roller mills having?  maybe they should all switch
to two roller mills.  maybe the problem is that they've never heard of two
roller mills.  we should really help anheuser out and reveal to them the
superiority of the two roller mill. jack, how many maltmills(tm) do you think 
anheuser would need? several thousand i would think.

let me first say that, yes, i totally agree that starch must be made available
to the enzymes before they can convert it.  we really don't much mention
gelatinization in this forum; it seems like it's implied most of the time.


but, are you arguing that i would *not* get better extraction if i were somehow 
able to grind those starch grits more finely?  to me it seems like there is
starch inside that starch grit that never got gelatinized and subsequently
saccharified.  i propose that a "more ideal" crush would lead to more
gelatinization, saccharification,  and thus extract. 


the starch grits i find in my lauter tun have been through a decoction mash
and usually a 2 hour saccharification rest between 151 and 156 F, typically.
how is it that gelatinization is my problem?  how can i better gelatinize
these starch grits without a better quality crush? (smaller grits/preserving
husks)  should i stand by the mash tun and stir for two hours?

okay, i admit that's probably an inaccurate analogy.  you wouldn't see a
jacques cousteau film in a microscope, but the basic point i was trying to 
make is that you can't get starch to saccharify (or, first,  gelatinize) if 
it's bound up in a big starch grit.  it needs to be physically broken out, 
either by gradual gelatinization from the outside (the sharks), or by 
physically crushing the grit into pieces to expose more surface area for 
gelatinization and subsequent saccharification.


i'm not mashing at 140 degrees, charlie.  i'm not sure why you believe my
problem is primarily with gelatinization.  my mashes don't gelatinize as much
as they should because i have big starch grits from a two roller mill. that's
a crush problem first.  the gelatinization problem comes after.


this whole discussion started with al k describing what the ideal (impossible)
crush would be like.  of course, practically you can't achieve it, but i 
still agree with him that the ideal we should shoot for is grinding the 
inner portion of the malt as finely as possible and leaving the husks intact.
we're never even going to get close to it with the equipment we have.  this 
ignores the balling problem because with a two roll mill you're 
probably going to have problems with finely ground husk before you run into
a lot of flour and balling difficulties.  this is my experience.

Subject: More pressure decoction


Greetings,


Just a follow up.   I pressure canned four jars of decoc this sunday to
watch their keeping qualities over a month or two.  Frankly, I'm so
confident of their keeping qualities that I kind of wonder why I'd
bothered.  But I planned to present it to other palates and get their
opinions, too.  Tuesday, several members of a local homebrew club tasted it
and the reaction was unanimous, a truly great tasting decoc.  Huge flavor,
no bitterness or tannins, and a big, complex malty profile.  Some thought I
had been joking until they tasted.


The idea of canning decoction may appeal to those using smaller pressure
cookers or canners, since a few jars could be put up at a time until enough
are laid by for The-Big-Decoc.  I found that nursing little quart jars of
mash through protein rest and saccharification before cooking was a pain
but manageable.  A half-pound (250g) of grain and a half-quart (500ml) of
water fills a quart (1L) jar about 2/3's after cooking. 1-1/2 pounds (700g)
at the same ratio should fill a half-gallon (2L) jar nicely.  Three pounds
should fill a gallon jar.


I reserved one jar after cooking them all for forty minutes at 250F (121C),
and I cooked it another twenty minutes to note the difference in browning. 
It wasn't much different.  The practical cooking time appears to be between
twenty (earlier post) and forty minutes at that temp.  It becomes very
brown.


When cooking grains and especially legumes (not in my beer) in a pressure
cooker you must keep them covered inside the cooker to prevent sputtering
bits from obstructing the pressure gauge and vent.  A big piece of foil
works fine.  A loosely lidded jar is safe.  Blocking the vent or guage can
result in a deadly accident, so read the instructions.


I've had email problems since friday, if I haven't responded to your recent
mail, please send again.


Take care,
Charles Rich (Seattle, USA)

Subject: all-grain extraction


In HBD#2394, Tim Watkins asks for advice on low all-grain extraction yields.


Tim, there are two fundemental things that can lead to poor yields:


   1. poor conversion of starch to sugar
   2. poor washing of sugar out of the grain bed


Your negative starch test suggests that (2) is the problem, although I
don't know how much I trust that test.  To check for poor washing, try
tasting little bits of the grain from different areas of your tun after
lautering.  It should taste grainy, but not sweet.  I caught a problem in
my tun design this way, finding a region of my grain bed that was very
sweet after lautering.  Turned out that was a dead flow spot that didn't
get properly extracted.  Correcting this boosted yield 10% from 27 to 30
pt*gal/lb.  


I wouldn't expect uneven flow in a zapap-style tun, but who knows?
Increasing the depth of water above the bed (while restricting outflow)
might help get into any dead spots you find.


Another thing to do is monitor the SG of your runnings over time.  If they
aren't falling off, that's a sign that the whole bed isn't being
effectively washed.  If the gravity of your final runnings is high mashout
will probably help, as would slower sparging.


Getting a better crush could help conversion if your crush is too coarse.

Brewers,


In HBD 2393, Mac asks about a digital thermometer he saw at a barbecue
shop.  I offer the following...


I have a feeling from the description he offers, that the thermometer
unit is the same one I have.  It's white plastic, with a large LCD
display, with timer and temperature readouts, with a shielded metal
probe.  Mine is made by Polder, and I purchased it from Kitchen Bazaar
for $30.  


I used mine several times before encountering some problems.  In fact,
the problems led to my return of the unit for another.  This is what
happened:  It would read accurate temperatures "ramping up," that is,
monitoring strike water temp, checking mash temp etc.  But, once the
probe was removed from the hot water/mash, the temperature reading would
ramp down partially.  So in other words, removing the probe from a 155
degree mash into a 72 degree environment, the temperature readout would
never go below, say 95 degrees.  It just seems to get stuck.  There is
nothing predictable about this at all.  I'm on my second unit and it's
doing the same thing.  Problem I have now, is that Kitchen Bazaar in
Dallas has gone out of business, so I don't have an easy way of returing
it.


When this thing worked, though  it was great.


My advice: If this unit is made by Polder, buyer beware.

Just like when I order a pint at a brewpub and I get 12 ounces in a 
drink-mixing glass....

Subject: Grain analysis


Hey folks,


        I was glad to see the grain analysis post Steve Alexander put on the list
as I have some questions about some of the information I was sent on the
grain I just bought.  I'm totally new to using grain as I have only done
extract brews so far and I would like to use the grain I have for partial
mash brews.  
        This grain is from Canada Malting Co., Sask. 2-row pale.
This is what I was sent;
        81.5% Extract DFG
        4.0% Moisture
        FAN 11.5% (What does FAN stand for?)
        % Protein Soluble 42 - 44% (What does this mean?)
        ASBC 1.5 - 1.7 (EBC 2.8 - 3.3) (What is color in Lovibond?)
        Dias. Power 120


        I plan on using this grain for partial mashes with oats, wheat, or by
itself for several types of grain.  I paid $12 Canadian for 11 pounds
(5Kg). ($8.60US).
        If someone has a way to convert EBC or ASBC to Lovibond I would love to
have the formula.
        There was no information on Alpha Amylase.  What does F/C and S/T refer to
as posted in Steve's analysis information?


TIA

        I wonder how many folks in the brewing hobby entered "Boat Race" drinking
contests back in College/High School?
