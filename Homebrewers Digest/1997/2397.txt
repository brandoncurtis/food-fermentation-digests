Please forgive this self-interested use of the digest, but I can think of no
better way to reach the many BrewingTechniques contributors who frequent
these pages.


One of BrewingTechniques' hard drives crashed and took editorial data with
it.  All of the past articles/issues are archived, but submissions that were
current in the past two to three months and some submissions that were in
longer term development were lost.  Our major articles are fine. I am mostly
concerned about Readers' Tech Notes, letters to the editor, and the new and
longer-term submissions that hadn't reached final acceptance.


If you submitted anything to BrewingTechniques in the past three months or
sent any e-mail, we'd love for you to recontact us and resend your earlier
material. Send any and all inquiries to my associate editor, Deb Jolda, at
BTassoc`at`aol.com.


I know, shame on us.  This is one lesson in backups management that we'll
have to learn only once.

Subject: RE:Cooler mash tun


Joseph Bonner asked if the Igloo cooler was comparable to the Gott.
I use an Igloo as I, too, could not find a Gott.  I am satisfied with the
Igloo and it seems to be functionally equivalent to the Gott.  I have a friend
with a Gott and there seems to be very little difference between the two.
On both the spigot can be removed and replaced with a Fass-Frisch rubber bung
from the homebrew store (or Williams Brewing in Ca.) with a 1/2" o.d. tube
through the hole in the bung to the false bottom or manifold for a leak free
connection.  I have brewed a lot of beer in mine with no problem, at least
no problem with the cooler.  I do recommend a rigid tube inside the cooler to
prevent its collapse under the weight of the grain at temp.  I use a 1/2" o.d.
vinyl siphon hose with a section of cut off racking cane inside to provide
rigidity.  I also clamp the hose to my false bottom fitting to prevent knocking
it loose when stirring.  I learned about this the hard way.


I also modified my cooler recently for an automatic stirring device.  I had
an old gas grill rotisserie motor and used it for a stirrer.  I bought some
1/2" square aluminum shaft and filed one end to 1/4" square to fit into the
drive socket of the motor.  I cut two blades from aluminum bar stock and
attached them toward the other end of the shaft with small bolts through
holes drilled through the shaft.  I cut slots in the blades at top and bottom
near the shaft and twisted the blades toward the horizontal. I drilled a hole
with a spade bit in the Igloo lid for the shaft.  I drilled a hole through the
shaft near the top end for a rod to keep the shaft from dropping to the bottom
of the cooler and hanging up on the false bottom tubing.  I use a large washer
between the rod and the top of the lid for a bearing surface.  I insert the
shaft into the mash after mash in, put the lid over the top with the shaft
through the hole, next the washer, then the rod, then the shaft through the
hole in the handle, and attach the motor to the top of the shaft.  I plug it
in and walk away for two hours or so and let it stir and mash.  Now for the
caveats.  The motor I used had been unused for about 15 years and howled like
mad.  After several batches the gears stripped.  I bought another at service
merchandise complete with spit for $20US.  This lasted only one batch.  I am
looking for a motor with sturdier gearing.  Maybe an ice cream freezer motor?
I like the idea, though, and am not ready to abandon it yet.


As for Joseph's question about whether it was better to go to a partial
mash before trying all grain, my advice is to go ahead with all grain.
I don't think it is much, if any, more trouble.

Subject: Mash Efficiency...


Many thanks to the folks who responded to my question on how to increase my 
mash efficiency.
        After reading all the replies, here's what I plan to try differently 
on my next batch.


        I will mash in a single vessel, rather than splitting the mash.


        I will heat the mash to a mashout temperature (170F) approx.


        I'm also going to slow down my sparge.  I'm also wondering about 
channeling in my sparge.  I'm curious to find out, so what I plan on doing, 
is after I've collected 3 gallons of wort, I plan on stirring the grainbed, 
and then recirculating again.  I've got a suspicious feeling that this will 
help alot.


        I'll be brewing an IPA on sunday..  Wish me luck

Subject: Re: fast maturing beers


Hi all,


Thanks to everyone who sent me their suggestions for fast maturing beers.
Since I got alot of great feedback, and I'm sure this question will crop
up again, I thought I'd post a summary of the comments I've gotten so far.
The overwhelming consensus is that 5 weeks is sufficient time to produce a
decent beer, although most seemed to agree that the beer might taste a
bit "green," and have a little more sediment than usual.


GENERAL BREWING GUIDLINES 
 - keep SG below about 1.050 - 1.054 
 - keep the bitterness down (one person suggested keeping it under 35 IBU)  
 - in general, my concerns about "darker" ales are unfounded.  Porters,
brown ales, etc are ok if hops rates and OG are low.  
 - corn sugar seems to prime faster 
 - shorten primary and secondary times to a few days, and increase time in
the bottle.  If you crash chill when fermentation is complete, you can
skip the secondary altogether.  
 - here's the excuse I was looking for to start kegging 
 - may want to use slightly higher ferment temps (about 70F)  
 - WYeast 1056 seems to be the consensus choice for yeast.  It can ferment
at higher temps and maintain a clean taste, and it seems to mature quickly.  
 - use a huge starter 
 - using fruit extract might be a good idea to hide some of the "green"
beer taste, but definitely don't use fresh fruit which needs more time. 


APPROPRIATE STYLES
3 styles were mentioned most often: American wheat, amber ale, and fruit
ale with extract.  The consensus seemed to be that not only can these
mature quickly, but most people enjoy these styles.


Other styles mentioned include: Kolsh, pale ale, English ordinary bitter,
cream ale.


Thanks again to all who responded.

Stop right there......


Hot, or even warm, water makes most substances more soluble (meaning that
they dissolve more easily in hot water than cold water).


Lead from plumbing and crud from your hot water heater all will have a better
chance of getting into your wort.

I do not profess to understand all of the above, just thought I'd pass

On a related note for Layne Rossi, FAN stands for Free Amino Nitrogen,
which is important for healthy yeast metabolism and fermentation.
If any one is interested in any additional malt analyses, please contact
me by private e-mail.

From: Jim Bentson <jbentson`at`htp.net>
Subject: Re: Pseudo-decoction


  Mark Bayer and Charley Peterson have commented on the post I made on a
pseudo-decoction technique for increasing maltiness in ales by pointing out
that lager malts actually should have higher enzyme potential than pale ale
malts.


I may have made an error in quoting the brewer. In reviewing my notes, I
realize that he had simply told me that there were plenty of enzymes left in
the mash with this technique. In typing I added the part about lager malts
having less enzymes, so any error is mine.  However, the method I described
is used after the protein rest so we are concerned with the potential
destruction of diastatic enzymes. It was these enzymes that I was comparing.


If you go to the table in Papzian's 'The Home Brewers Companion', you can
see that depending on the type of base malt used, the lager malts could have
more or less Diastatic Power than other base malts. Mark and Charlie are
correct for my example of a English Pale base malt. Here the DP of 45 is low
compared to 75 DP for English lager but a base of Klages two row is 120 DP
which is considerably higher than a lager or pils. Obviously it could go
either way depending on the base malt. My mistake was to use the term Pale
malt instead of base malt in my general description.


 The fact remains that there are sufficient enzymes in most base malts to
get full conversion in spite of the fact that part of the liquid is being
boiled before mash-out




I was asked about the type of base malt used in the beers I described. The
actual base malt that was used was Crisp Pale Malt which is  also found here
on the East Coast. 


  The comments from Charley raised a more interesting question that I hadn't
thought about. If lagers  have the enzyme power quoted, would this method
work with lagers? That is,  will it give an increased maltiness over step
infusion, with less time and work than the true decoction???  Mark Bayer
thought the method would work based on the fact that even pils malts
available today are modified further than old malts. I have never tried it
on lager malts but intend to. 


As a data point I can state that when tasting  wheat beers made this new
way( with a Pale Malt base) and comparing to Paulaner (spelling?)  bottled
hefe-weissen (not a completely fair comparison) I don't notice any lack of
flavor in the beers crafted by the method described.


 BTW I agree that this is not a true decoction as no grain is being boiled
but it is also not a  step infusion either. Maybe it should be called a
'defusion' since it has elements of both.

Subject: hot water questions


 I am very interested in the hot water-heater thread going on right now,
even though there seem to be more questions than answers. I too have 
always been told that water from the hot water heater (HWH) was not fit for 
consumption, that it has a lot of precipitated minerals caused by the 
heating element. I know that some people use HWH elements mounted in 
brew kettles for their sparging tanks, and some that have them in their boil 
kettles. What makes this any different than a HWH? 
 I filter my brew water with a large carbon canister filter, and then heat it.
Does anyone in the collective know if it is feasible, or possible to run the 
water from a HWH, then through a filter, and on to your tun. There by
removing your normal load of undesirables, and the calcified minerals?
I suppose that you would end up changing your filter more frequently.
If you only brew every 2 -4 weeks you could flush it out so that it is not 
sitting full of water, getting stale. Any homebrewing Plumbers out there?
(Sure, you know how Jackson refers to beers being a good digestif,
wait 'till you try my Roto-rooter Wee-wee Heavy)

Chill haze=protien=break, therefore you need to get some of that break out of
there.
Personally, I just stir the pot and let the trub settle, then siphon
carefully. I'm also
considering a hop-back to filter more of it out.


If you choose to do a protien rest to reduce the break, I recommend a high
temp
(130-135F). The low temp rest you mentioned wouldn't greatly degrade the
larger
protiens, and the high temp rest would greatly increase middle weight
protiens,
increasing mouth feel and possibly helping the body problems you mentioned.

HBDers,


A few weeks ago there was some discussion of the availability of the HBD 
subscriber list. This list WAS available to the general public at the 
beginning of this year. I am a computer newbie and brewer who just subscribed 
to the HBD in December. To see how many people were subscribers I found that I 
could download the subscriber list. Don't ask me how I found this out because 
I don't remember, I was a total newbie at the time ( only had a computer for 
one month and online for less). I haven't spoken up before because I could not

Actually I loved the shark analogy, Cousteau in my mash too! The point I was
making was that it is inaccurate for other reasons. Enzymes are dissolved
very quickly and water penetrates all starchy pieces of grain very quickly,
regardless of size (except balls). My point is that the thermomechanical
process (swelling)is the main method of gelatinisation. Flour only allows
the water in the finer starchy particles to heat more quickly and effectively.

Well, my response would be that: 
1/ area *is* important (i.e. flour over larger particles) for heat
penetration, 2/ starchy particles become wet faster than most brewers think
they do,
3/ the enzymes are *in* the particle, not just attacking from outside (i.e.
size is not relevant to rate of enzymic action, extraction yes),
4/ heat is the most important gelatinisation process
5/ the range of gelatinisation is greater than most brewers think and is
usually not complete in 1.5 hours at < 70C (158F), by enzymic action or heat.


An all-flour starch crush is hypothetical and the six roller professional
millers don't try it even though they can seperate the husk portion before
the final crush. For practical reasons, starch flour has more disadvantages
in mashing in and lautering than advantages in accelerating gelatinization.
That remains largely temperature/time dependent.

Greetings, Homebrewers. I have just finished bottling my second batch
using a partial mash procedure. The problem is that both batches are very
cloudy. The first is 1 week old and is not clearing at all. My second
batch is the same way. What did I do wrong? I used an infusion mash with
both batches. Ingredients were- 4.5 lbs. pale malt syrup and 4 lbs. 2-row
pale malted barley. It really dosen't taste that great. I have had better
tasting beers using straight extracts. I will not go all-grain (which I
really want to) until I get better results with this procedure. Thanking
anyone in advance for any help.

Does anyone out there cask condition their beer in real wooden casks?

I'm a confirmed bottler and have no plans nor room to get into kegging my brew. 
But I AM thinking of those few times in the year when I may have a party and
would like to make, say, 10 gallons and stick the whole batch in a cask only to
be consumed on that one day, either by gravity or hand pump.

It is sweet without being malty and has more diacetyl than anything Samuel

My local German restaurant has Schlosser (sp?) on tap. Friends that have

Subject: Two Questions


Hi Everyone!


   Just a few questions.  I just brewed a batch this weekend, and did a small
partial mash.  I put 4 lbs of crushed grains in a grain bag and added 2 gallons
of water, and kept at about 150 degrees F for about 1 hour, then removed grain
bag and added LME and more water for a 3 gallon volume boil.  I did not sparge
as in the traditional mash method.  Why is it necessary to sparge, why not just
add more initial water for the mash, and only drain, not sparge?  I know that a
big reason is the capacity of the mash container, but are there other reasons
such as pH, or astringency, or others?
   The other question is on the terminology of "top fermenting" ale yeast.? 
It's hard to really tell where the bubbles are coming from due to the
turbulence of the fermentation, but why do the bubbles of CO2 seem like they
are rising in the carboy from down near the bottom if the yeast is supposed to
be on the top?  Just curious :^)

HBD-
 
The last batch (all-grain) I brewed had dismal extraction.  I took full
responsibility, since I allowed a "questionable" crush sneak through:
It looked like each grain had been crushed, but the husk was fully intact-
I added 2 Tbs.. water to the grain, which in the past made for a much more
pliable husk during the grind.  This time, though, the kernels seemed to be
shattered inside the husks, which came apart fairly easily when rolled between
my fingers.  I said to myself "Self, this may be perfect]- After swelling with
water and being heated, the starches and sugars should burst forth from the
husks, leaving the husks nearly intact, and give a heavenly sparge."
Well, it did sparge very easily, but I only got about 16 pts.  The husks held
together too well, and interfered with conversion, extraction or both.
As I said, I took full responsibility, but now, after reading Mark Bayers
note;
 
as long as you don't have a lot more than, say, 5 or 10 per cent by weight
kernels that pass through *completely unscathed*, it's probably not

The same, it seems, applies to thermometers.  Recently, I purchased one of
those nifty dial thermometers that are ubiquitous in brewshops.  I was
attracted to the "instantaneous" measurement this would give me.  For the past
6 years, I've been using the standard floating dairy thermometer.  As I'm an
all grain brewer, accurate temperatures are important to me.  Well, guess
what?  They don't agree.  Worse, they disagree non-linearly.  Since the dial
thermometer is adjustable, I simply turned it until it matched the dairy at
room temp.  However, then they were off by 8 degrees in the 150-160F range. 
Horrors! When adjusted in this range...(Ow that's hot!) they disagreed by a
like amount in the 100-110F range.  


Ok, which thermometer is more likely to be right?  I'm assuming that SOME of
you have used both.  Does your experience match mine?  Is one of these devices

As has been pointed out, Guinness has a lower starting and finishing gravity
than most lagers used in B&T.  Also, Guinness has a very low carbonation,
and the point of the gas mix and the tap is to lower the carbonation even 
more and create the head.  I think it has all to do with density (i.e. gravity).


*****
Speaking of taps, does anyone know about the use of sparklers on beer
engines?  I've seen beer engines that pour bitters and the sparkler causes
the beer to shoot out in very small streams.  This mixes air in to the beer and,
along with the low carbonation, creates a dense white head.  Many
brewpubs these days serve "cask conditioned" beers, but most of those
pumps don't have sparklers.  They seem to have a fairly big opening that
the beer comes out of.


Is this just to make pouring easier?  Many pubs seem to want the hand pump
since it is pretty trendy now, but they don't want to take any more time
to pour a beer than they do with their other taps.  Do they remove the 
sparkler and then just pour and dump off the head as it forms to get a pint
out quickly?  Half the fun of Guinness and bitter is the anticipation while
you watch the head form and wait for the complete pour.

What I don't understand is why the enzyme rich fluid added back doesn't
have its enzymes denatured by the hot mash.  If the mash out raises the
mash temp to 165-170F as I thought the purpose to be, wouldn't the enzymes
of the added back fluid be denatured before they were able to convert the
starch released by the mash out?  I realize the enzymes are not denatured
instantly but I would think at 165-170F it wouldn't take long.  If the
mash was allowed to cool before adding back the enzyme rich liquid what
would be the point of mashing out?

Some maltsters list it as a ratio, which is how I initially learned it.
Jeff is right, however, I did slip up and write "ratio" when I should
have written "difference."


Note that, actually, it's not a "per cent difference" but rather the

my best beer yet!

Does anyone know what is the story on Special-B malt.  It was recommended
by a homebrew store that I don't normally like to frequent.  The guy who
recommended it left before I could ask questions.  It, presumably, can
replace
crystal malt in some applications.  Also, presumably, it imparts a red to
copper
color.  If anyone knows more, please let the rest of us know! Thanks!

On Steeping vs. Mashing specialty grains


What advantages are there, really, to mashing specialty grains such as 
Crystal, Cara-Pils, Choclate, Black Patent, etc.?  Havn't these grains
undergone
some conversion in the husk?  By mashing with your grist, are you not
doing additional conversion?  In particular, Cara-Pils is a dextrinous malt.
 
It gives your beer body by adding dextrins (large sugar molecules, 
somewhere between fermentable sugars and starchs), right?  Would
adding it to a mash allow enzyme activity to break down the dextrins into
fermentable sugars -- eliminating its desired purpose?  I know that in a
full mash, you can control the mash temp with your base malt to make the
wort more or less dextrinous; but with a partial mash temp. would be harder
to control.  So, If I am not interested in using any grains that require a
mash
(wheat, wheat malt, oats, Munich malt, etc), does a partial mash really
buy anything to the finished product?  Someone, please help to enlighten
this ignorant brewer.
