Harshness comes from primarily three sources:


1. astringency from polyphenols (especially oxidized polyphenols),
2. higher alcohols, and
3. some hop varieties.


You can brew and serve Bitter in 14 days.  You can brew and serve most
low-gravity ales in 14 days.  You have to avoid the three things listed
above.


To reduce astringency, first of all, minimize air/oxygen after 
fermentation has started... if you are getting lots of astringency,
you may want to have someone else who brews look at your bottling
procedures... maybe you are missing something obvious that's introducing
oxygen at bottling time.  Next, watch the pH of the steep/mash...
if it's above 5.5, add acid to get it down below 5.5 (a little at a
time -- it works very fast).  Don't boil grains, of course, which
will increase polyphenol extraction and watch the sparge pH and temp
especially!


To minimize higher alcohols, stay away from the Belgian yeasts and
keep your fermentation temp down below 68F... 65F would be even better.
Keep those OG's reasonable... the higher the OG, the more higher 
alcohols you will get.  To get beer in 14 days (kegged, mind you...
bottling you need 21 so it will naturally carbonate), you really
need to stay below 1.050 or so.


Some hop varieties can be harsh at higher rates.  If you stay below
30 IBUs for a 1.050 beer or say, below 25 IBUs for a 1.045 beer, you 
can use virtually any hop.  Note that high-alpha hops aren't the
worst offenders: I feel that Mount Hood is harsher than Nugget,
Galena, and Eroica (try it yourself... I did).  You can always be
safe with Cascade and Goldings... seems like you can't overhop with
these two!


Time mellows the harshness of all three of these sources of harsh
flavours.  Polyphenols are said to combine into longer molecules
with time (this is why red wines improve with age).  Higher alcohols
combine with organic acids to form esters (esterification).  I don't
know what compounds are responsible for harshness from some hops,
but time definitely smooths them out... whatever they are.


Finally, to get fermentation going quickly, as you will need, you
should use a big starter or an extra package of dry yeast.  I
needed some beer in a hurry recently: I used two packages of Danstar
Windsor and aerated well.  The beer fermented in two days at 65F
and cleared after two more.  If I would have kegged it, I could
have served it after five days (one needed to chill to serving
temp).

 I think that you are just assuming that the Stout has got to be the Bigger
beer because it's a STOUT. This is from Lewis' Stout book, " Guinness 
Extra Stout": OG 1.040, ABV 4.3% (page 143)
 That means that the Final Gravity would be 1.0076, (1008) a pretty
"light" beer. I think that the floating effect is more from differences in 
density, and not from gas. I too have made B&Ts from bottled Guinness
that contains no Nitrogen. I have also made them with a homebrewed 
Oatmeal Stout, on top of a big homebrewed UK Pale Ale, no nitrogen there.

This is true (higher temp and longer kilning will give you lower enzyme
levels), but I think that Jim was referring to the lager malts of 20 or
50 years ago relative to modern ale malts... at least that's how I read
it.  In general, American malts tend to be higher in protein and, therefore,
enzymes than British and Continental malts.

Nitrogen and beer...
Ken suggests and Scott swears by mixed-gas (Nitrogen/CO2) dispense of
stout for good black+tans.  Nitrogen is virtually insoluble in beer.
That's why it's used to dispense Guinness: so you can dispense at high
pressure without a lot of gas dissolving into the beer.  Now, I do not
doubt that using nitrogen-dispensed stout will make creating a b+t
easier. When the beer comes out of the tap at the high-pressure you use
with mixed-gas systems, the beer comes out as a sort of churning mass
of beer and bubbles, which is much lighter than a true liquid and easier to
lay down on top of a half pint of Bass or Harp or whatever.

They are different strains.  As far as I know, Wyeast doesn't have an
Australian yeast, but YCKC's Australian is the Sparkling Ale yeast
whereas the Cooper's dry is a completely different yeast.  I feel the
Cooper's dry is quite fruity.

The amount to use is ZERO grams per liter.  ZERO!  Metabisulphites are
not sterilants.  They are not even sanitisers.  They are inhibitors.
Their purpose is to inhibit the growth of wild yeasts and bacteria till
your cultured yeast can get a foothold.  They require a low pH to work
at all and I don't even recommend the practice of mixing metabisulphites
with acid in water for sanitising... as I said before, you really can't
count on them to kill the nasties (although they do kill some of them).
I recommend that you use either bleach (1 tablespoon per gallon) or iodophor
(1 ounce per 5 gallons) for sanitising your fermenter.

Nope... bit difference.  The Igloos are only made to keep things cold

I take it that I was summoned because I'm an ex-homebrew supply shop
owner and can now give all the dirty secrets of HB shop ownership, eh?
Well, Tom's right... there's very little profit in bulk malts.  You
have to give a big discount because your customers expect it, but then
your profit is extremely small.  After adding freight, the profit
on a 55# sack of malt is between $5 and $10.  Incidentally, extract
is not a big moneymaker... markup can't be very high and all you make
on a 3.3# can or bag of extract is $1 to $2.  2oz packages of hops,
1# bags of malt... that's where the profit comes in, but then they are
labour-intensive.  Equipment has a decent markup, but it is purchased
infrequently.  The bottom line is that nobody is buying Mercedes with
homebrew shop profits (even if you have another job like I did).

Definetly the way to go, use brewpub/micro yeast as long as the beers

then feed it before use (or go back for fresh!).

Subject: Keg connectors, inline filters, and yeast washing questions?


     Hey collective,
     
     I need to get in and out connectors for my soda kegs and my local do 
     it all utility store doesn't carry them.  Any idea's (local chains I 
     may have overlooked as well as mail order co.'s)
     
     Also since I am overhauling the kegging system I need a inline filter 
     and I remember some discussion about 2 months before the "Great HBD 
     Darkening" about a inline filter with the following specs
     
     - about 50 micron filtering (just trying to get rid of the big chunks 
     not worried about chill haze)
     
     - Backwash with bleach or idophor to clean
     
     - good for 20 + batches
     
     Can anyone remember the make and price of this filter?
     
     Lastly,  I've tried my hand at recycling yeast by washing with mixed 
     results.  I feel that slow starting ferments when using these yeasties 
     has lent itself to low grade infections of 2 or 3 batches.  Here's my 
     procedure, please tell me if anyone sees a flaw.
     
     1.  sterilize 3 mason jars of water
     2.  after racking off primary fermenter, I gently pour the first jar 
     of sterile water onto the trub, give a little swirl then pour out.
     3.  I take what is left in the fermenter and divide equally between 
     the last 2 mason jars of sterile water.  At about 50% water and 50% 
     yeast.
     4.  place in fridge till next brewday.
     5.  Before next brewday I make a starter with boiled water, dme and 
     one of the jars of yeast stuff.
     
     A friend of mine instructed me in using this technique and he has good 
     success so I'm wondering where's my mistake.

Subject: half brews


Rodroy,


I read your message regarding making half brews and thought I'd add my
two cents worth.


All my beer to date has been based on extracts so quantity was pretty
much set.


What I wanted to do was see if I could successfully make beer and also
to find at least one I liked. So I made up a full mix but only bottled
half - it seems like a waste but in reality it isn't a lot of money.
This way if the beer was really bad I only had to dump the remaining
half. This also made it easier to have enought bottles on hand to make
up six brews in as many weeks without taking up half my house. I used a
couple of variations on a recipe and decided which one I liked best. By
doing this I ended up with three variations of a Lager, (one straight
extract + dextrose and no hops etc, one with half dextrose, half pale
malt, and the last one half dextrose, half malt, plus some hops) I also
think it is interesting to compare the three and determine which part of
the mix is adding to what in the taste. Now I have a nice, drinkable
lager which I intend to play around with using different hops, and
combinations of hops.


The other half brews are a wheat beer which was really bad - although I
am not sure why and a wheet beer which is sitting and will be tested in
a couple of more weeks. The other brew is a stout which should be ok.


The point I am trying to make is I think it is probably easier to make
full mixes and use half than to attempt to cut recipes in half. Home
brewing at my level isn't that expensive in my opinion to make the
difference worthwhile.


Have fun and happy brewing

Hello all,


I brewed a batch of pale ale this past weekend and I had a small 
problem which I am hoping I can get an explanation for. I have fairly 
neutral water, runs about pH 7.3. It is city water but I don't have 
the analysis because I wouldn't know what I was looking at. I think 
it may be time to get it though, if I can.


I wanted to acidify my stike water just a bit because I wasn't using 
very many darker grains and didn't expect my mash bed pH to get low 
enough. I have done this before and it worked well. I used lactic 
acid this time which was different for me. Any comments related to 
it's use for this purpose are also welcome. 


Well, I added 1/4 *tsp*  of lactic acid to the stike water as it was 
heating. I stirred it for a few minutes and then rechecked expecting 
to see a pH somewhat lower than 7.3 but what I got was a totally 
unexpected 3.5! What the **** happened? Is this the cause of not 
having enough buffer capacity in the water? What can be done to 
prevent this? The litany of questions could go on of course but if 
anyone can comment on this I would appreciate it.


Thanks






Cheers,

Could be lots of things Chris.


Could be starch from sparging too hot.  How did you sparge?  Were the 
runnings clear from the sparge?  Did you recirculate?   How hot was your
sparge water?


Could be yeast.  What kind of yeast are you using?  What is your fermentation
temperature?  What is the OG and current SG?  Maybe it isn't done fermenting
yet; give it some time.  Maybe rack it again.


How did you chill your batch?  Many people chill in their boiling kettle
and then rack to a fermenter, thus separating the hot and cold break.  You
want to rack off of this stuff fairly early in fermentation.


Keep trying and you'll get better. Keep asking questions.

Subject: re: subscriber list


I don't think there was ever much debate on this point -- or at least
there shouldn't have been.  When the AOB took over the list they used
Majordomo mailing list software to manage the mailing list;  by
default Majordomo allows one to get a subscriber list for any managed
mailing list.  Latter versions of the software may let admins turn
this feature off -- it's been a while since I looked at it.  Majordomo
is pretty widely used,  despite its shortcomings.


When the HBD was switched back to Rob Gardener's original scripts  by
Pat Babcock et al (a good move most will agree), this feature was no
longer available.  Although I'll probably be letting my AOB
Membership/Zymurgy subscription lapse this year (the bottle opener
article was pretty much the last straw),  the AOB can hardly be
faulted for the idea of using Majordomo to manage a mailing list --
thousands of lists are managed in exactly the same way.  They can,
however,  be faulted for severely screwing it up when Shawn Steele
left,  and this has also figured heavily in my decision not to renew.


Note that regardless of whether a list server makes its subscriber
list available or not,  your address can easily be harvested if you
_ever_ post on any usenet newsgroup or on any mailing list.

Subject: hot water questions


Ray Estrella asks about using water from his hot water tank. I have
heard about the sediment issues, but nonetheless propose the following.
I live in a relatively new home, no lead in the pipes. Many  cartridge
filters indicate that they will operate ok up to water temps. of 120
degrees F.  Put a T joint in the outlet pipe of your water heater, plumb
to a ball valve, run the hot water through a cartridge filter. Check and
adjust salt levels. Make sure you've turned down water heater temp. to
below the filter's stated temp. limits. This filtered  hot water wil be
delivered to your hot liquor tank where salts, pH, etc. can be tested
and adjusted. Then you can heat the water to the desired temp. in the
hot liquor kettle before transferring to your mash tun, or if you heat
your mash tun, you can make the temp. adjustments there. I think at
least some enterprising homebrewers could try this and "test the
waters", pardon the pun. I would think it  might also be of some benefit
to flush the hot water heater by draining from the bottom periodically.

Subject: Pressure-Cooker Decoction Question


I've not yet given decoction a try, though I was quite fascinated by the
concept of pressure-cooking wort to achieve many of the effects.  For the
brewer not inclined to spend all day decocting (such as lazy me), this sounds
like a reasonable alternative.


That brought up a question in my mind (uh-oh).  Would pressure-cooking a
quantity of pale extract *syrup* give a reasonable approximation of Munich
extract?  And if not exactly Munich, then at least something that might add
some nice complexity to an all-extract brew?

Ray Estrella asks:


"I know that some people use HWH elements mounted in 
brew kettles for their sparging tanks, and some that have them in their boil 
kettles. What makes this any different than a HWH?"


Mostly the fact that the HWH will accumulate crud over time, whereas the
contents of an electric brew kettle are only used once before cleaning the
whole thing out.

Hal Davis asks:


"I've called every bottle distributor in the Dallas yellow pages to no avail:
I'm looking for 6 to 7 ounce bottles for bottling mead, regular crown cap
(no screwies), and preferably in brown glass. I only need about 300 bottles,
but I could go as high as 1000 if I needed to. Anybody know of a source for
fewer than 5 truckloads?"


I found that Perrier bottles work nicely for packaging small chunks of
beverage.  I've got several full of mead as I type.  Although they're green,
and a fairly clear green at that, remember that there are (probably) no hops
in your mead, so "skunking" won't be a problem, though I can't say for sure
that light won't have other effects.

Charley Burns asks about crystal malts:


"In all-grain brewing, does 4 lbs of 20 Lovibond Crystal = 1 pound of 80 
Lovibond crystal, assuming the balance (3 lbs) is made up of Pale Ale malt?"


"Equals" flavor-wise, no.  Color-wise, yes, at least using the linear color
model that most of us use.


I've found that you can noticibly vary the caramel quality of your brew
without altering the target color (if that's your goal) by mixing different
crystal malts.  For example, if your recipe calls for 40L, try using 50% 60L
and 50% 20L, or even 30% 90L and 60% 20L.  Same color; different flavor
(these mixes tend to have a bit sharper caramel quality).

Subject: Aluminum Pressure Cooker Questions


Back once again to the pressure cooker/decoction thread ...


OK, the aluminum-Alzheimer's myth has been disproven.  Aluminum is not
significantly soluble in wort either.


What would be wrong with pressure-cooking (in Al) the first 2-3 gallons
(5-gal batch) or so of runnings without using a separate container??  I
don't THINK the sugar concentration will be high enough to scorch,
especially when using an aluminum pot, since it spreads the heat more
evenly than a SS pot.  Also, there should be little-or-no grain
particulates present to potentially clog the vent.  


This seems like a super-easy way to get a great deal of the benefits of
a decoction mash (+ high-temp Maillard reactions), without most of the
trouble.


Is 250 F too high??


I would like to try this technique in my next altbier (100% Ireks
[Weyermanns] Munich).  I'll use a simple 2-step infusion (135/153 F),
pressure cook the first 2-3 gal of runnings `at` 250F/30 min., then
recirculate this decoction for mash-out, and sparge, boil etc as usual. 
Any comments??

I would advise against crash-chilling because it will shock the yeast.
This will lead to slower carbonation and less viable yeast to re-absorb
diacetyl and acetaldehyde.  Since these are primarily responsible for
that "green beer" taste (especially the latter) I would advise letting
the fermentation run it's course in about two weeks in the primary (as
long as it's glass -- plastic primaries rarely have good-enough seals on
the lids or where the stopper goes to keep beer in them for more than a
week or so) and then go to kegs or bottles.  


> - using fruit extract might be a good idea to hide some of the "green"

I have read in HBD where several people have had success with those
fruit extracts, but I've used several types (all claiming to be 100%
real fruit) and was disappointed in all of them.  Even in a very lightly-
hopped beer, when I got the fruit level up to where I liked it, the
resulting beer was too bitter and had a slight medicinal (like cough
medicine) flavour.

Subject: Thermometers


Craig Rode was commenting on thermometer inaccuracies and differences between
glass and bimetal types.
I have gone through some of the same agonizing.  In trying to calibrate my
long probe bimetal dial thermometer to match my glass thermometer I have
come to a few conclusions?


1) The bimetal type doesn't seem to be linear in its response.
2) It is important that the liquid used for calibration be at an even temp
   or to measure with both thermometers at the same depth.  Even temp is
   hard to achieve, especially in a mash.  It is also difficult to tell
   which part of the glass thermometer should be at the same depth as the
   bimetal's probe.  The bulb at the bottom at about the same depth as a
   point an inch or so up from the tip of the bimetal probe, I presume.
3) Considering 2 above makes 1 above questionable.


I have come to depend on a digital thermometer I bought from Williams Sonoma
for about $15US.  I checked it against ice water that had been in a thermos
for several minutes and it read within about a degree of 32F, against
boiling water which it showed at about 212F (about 600 ft. above sea level),
and against about 100F water checked with a fever thermometer (see 2 above).
It agreed pretty closely with what I expected so I trust it more than the
others.  Its biggest problems are a short probe and need for a battery.  I
still use the bimetal long probe dial thermometer to get an idea for temp
variation at different depths of the mash.
Just some thoughts.

If running your cold water through a hot water heater causes mineral
deposits to build up inside the hot water heater then does it not seem
reasonable that the hot water leaving the hot water heater no longer
contains those minerals?  Most pet stores sell inexpensive test kits
to measure the General Hardness and Carbonate Hardness of water

fine.  FWIW, my own tapwater is soft enough that I don't need to use

Subject: RE:Cooler Mash Tun Thread


John Wilkinson described how he used an Igloo cooler to make a mash
tun as he had trouble finding a Gott (Rubbermaid).  An easy place to
connect with a Gott cooler is through your local wholesale janitorial
supply store.  Most of them do business with Rubbermade for cleaning
equipment and can order the coolers even if they don't stock them.


I use a Phils false bottom in mine.  I handled the spigot a little differently
than John.  I used a regular drilled rubber stopper (can't remember the
size) inserted from the _inside_.  This ensures that it doesn't come
popping off at an inconvenient time.  I inserted a section of racking cane
through the drilled stopper sufficiently long to leave approximatley 1 inch
outside the cooler and terminating inside the cooler approximately 1/4
inch from the fitting that comes out of the center of the large size of false
bottom.  I use a piece of regular racking hose about two inches long over
both the fitting and the racking cane.  This serves to firmly connect up
the two, but it  does not require a clamp.  An added bonus is that when
you use a rigid racking tube, it stops the false bottom's annoying habit of
rising up off the bottom when you mash in.  I also use regular racking
hose on the outside, but I do use a clamp at that fitting.


Hope this helps-

Proud of your brew? Think you got what it takes to compete with 
the big boys in the microbrewery market? Well here's your chance
to find out. The First State Brewers and Rockford Brewing Company 
are proud to announce: 


                DELAWARE'S BEST ALES CHALLENGE


                         July 26, 1997

Enter this homebrew competition and you might win prizes and the
opportunity of having your beer brewed and sold under a special
"Delaware's Best" label by Rockford Brewing Company. A portion of 
the proceeds from the sale of this product will go to a local 
Delaware charity. 


Prizes and ribbons will be awarded in all of the judged categories.
You will also recieve detailed tasting notes and score sheets from
certified BJCP (Beer Judge Certification Program) judges. This is 
an opportunity to have your beer evaluated by the professionals and
show just how good homebrew can be. 


There will be a catered Awards Reception the evening of the 
competition at the brewery where we will announce the winners and
distribute prizes. This reception will be open to all brewers and 
their guests (check website or entry packet for ticket information).
 
NOTICE: This is an Ales only competition. Entry is limited to
"Delaware" brewers: you must live, work, OR brew (i.e. associated 
with a Delaware based homebrew club) in order to be eligible. This
is a BJCP/AHA sanctioned event.
