Subject: Mash pH / Iodine test / Preserving Wort


Lots of Questions:
1...pH of mash!... I have been trying to keep this in the range OF 5.2-5.5
to control the extraction of husk tannins. I thought I was doing just fine
until I relized I was cooling mash sample to 65F to measure the pH and have
just recently heard that my actual pH at 153F would be ~.35 higher making my
very acceptable reading of 5.3 actually becomes 5.65 putting it in the upper
part of this range.
 ...Should I be concerned and use phosphoric acid to acidify this mash?
 ...Is there agreement on this .35 pH increase at the higher temp range?


2...Starch Iodine test!... I have been checking for conversion before
mashout(after 60-90 min conversion rest) by testing the liquid part of my
mash with iodine. After my most recent mash I also pulled some grains in a
separate examination and pressed them with the back of my spoon. I found the
iodine tested positive for starch here.
 ...Will this starch be rinsed into the wort during lautering or is it still
pretty well bound up in the bits of grit?
 ...What happens to it as I raise the temp to 168F? Should I expect
unconverted starch to be rinsed into my wort?
 ...Considering that gelatinization is effective at 149F and I have been
holding this mash above this for at least 60 mins, why the unconverted
starch? Am I dealing with limited enzyme availability or activity here
(American Klages Malt used)?




3...Preserving Extra Wort for yeast starters... My last batch provided me
with some extra wort which I decide to bottle. I racked it into 22 oz
bootles ... placed into my kettle with boiling water up to the liquid level
of the wort... Placed caps loosly on tops ... boiled for 30-45 min... pulled
bottles out and capped .. let cool.
 ...Is this a sound procedure for preserving wort for yeast starters or wort
for conditioning beer? How do other people do this? Any comments would be
appreciated.

Subject: Low Extraction... need help!


 I have been brewing with all grain for the past year (8-10 batches) and
feel I am getting a much lower extraction than others out there.
My most recent batch:
(American Pale Ale)12.25 Lbs of grain (AmerKlages,Cryst,Munich)
MashIn `at` 131F_20min
Convert `at` 154F_90 Min (drops to 150 at end)
MashOut `at` 168F_10
Lauter lasted 1 hr and grain bed stayed at 166-168
I collect 8.25 Gallons of wort..
boil off 2 Gallons in 90 Min boil..
loose .75 Gal as Trub ..
finishing with a batch of 5.5 Gal and an OG of 1.052.
I figure my efficiency to be 75% but others expect 80-90% from their batches...


Any Ideas on improving my efficiency?

Take that score with a grain of salt and don't necessarily jump to the
conclusion that you brewed out of style from the results of one
competition.  Recently I had an English Special Bitter score in the mid and
upper 20's by two judges in the first round of the competition. In the
second round two new judges scored it 39 and 40! Remember not all judges in
all competitions are experts at the style they are judging. I have alot of
respect for people that take the time and effort to become certified beer
judges (I'm studying at the moment). My only point is that any beer can be
judged incorrectly if the person judging doesn't have much experience
tasting the real thing. As you point out, Kolsch is a difficult style to
find at the local Safeway.

Subject: Questioning accuracy of data on Saccharification Temperature Range


With the problems I've encountered with decoction mashing and protein
resting, I decided to try a new method last week. Making my first American
brown, I decided to mashin at 135f for a protein rest, pull a third or so of
the mash for a quick decoction and boost to 158f. I completed that, made a
good looking and tasting wort and will post more details when beer is finished.


However, the interesting part is that 2/3 of the mash stayed at exactly 135F
for about 30 minutes. I got my fingers in there somehow (could be on purpose
but I can't remember) and I ended up tasting the mash. Imagine my surprise
when it tasted sweet! Wait a minute, I said to myself, this is a rest to
break up large proteins to medium size proteins, not Saccharification. Hmmmm.


Some of you may have noticed my skepticism over some of the statistics and
temperatures mentioned over the last couple of months. I decided to do a
little experiment.


Yesterday, I mashed 1 pound of Great Western Pale ALE malt at 135F to 130F
for 1 hour in 1 quart of water (untreated). I did it on the stove top, not
my usual setup. The temperature stayed between 130F and 135F the entire
time. PH was a little high at 5.9 but I wasn't going for max conversion, I
just wanted to see if sugar would be created. I tested for starch every 15
minutes. The reaction got steadily less as time went on, but even after 1
hour I still had starch in the mash. I wanted to keep going but the wife had
other ideas yesterday. I shut down the mash at 1 hour.


I sparged very sloppily in a kitchen strainer with 2 quarts of water `at` 180F,
not worrying about mashout. The result was a really VERY cloudy 2.5 quarts.
I assume there was tons of starch left. I boiled it down to 2 quarts total
volume of wort. The OG was 1.036 (18 pts/gal/lb). This of course is a very
bad extraction rate.


BUT, the fact remains that more than 54% (assuming available = 33 pts) of
the starch DID get converted to sugar (I think that's all the OG is
measuring). My guess is that it's almost all (maybe 100%) maltose
(fermentable). It is now happily bubbling away in a 1 gallon jug after I
pitched a 7gm packet of Danstar dried ale yeast. I'll measure the final
gravity in a week and report it then.


My observation really is this - all the temperature's being talked about in
all these posts about decoctions and saccharifcation ranges are to be taken
with a grain of salt. Try stuff for yourself, do some experiments and you'll
discover what works best for you and the malt that you have.


I went back and compared Dave Millers Handbook to Noonan. They both
recommend protein rests between 122F and 131F. I think I'll try a 125F
protein rest next time I make a pale ale, boosting after 20 minutes to 155F.
And you can bet I'll taste the mash during protein rest to see if it is also
sweet at that low temp.

Subject: REAL ALE


My wife has told me she'll drink beer in Europe if we ever went again. 
I figured that 3 times a day tasting enabled her to condition her tongue
and it was a matter of overcomming her wine preference. 


When visiting NYC we wandered into "The Gingerman" pub on east 36th
street after failing to find where the NYC homebrew contest was, and
they had real ale on tap.  My wife actually enjoyed the cask conditional
ale pulled up on an engine and served English style.  Have others had
the experience with significant others who greet beer (anybodies-not
just mine) with the "do I have to?" look on their face.

Who is the vendor for the thermostat that is used to maintain lagering
temperatures in a adapted chest freezer?  I know there have been posts from
satisfied users.  Who can find them when you want them?  I have also checked
several issues of Zymurgy, BYO and Techniques without finding the ads that I

I recently had a hernia operation and was unable to brew at all for 3 months.
I know what it can be like.  I have made an excellent wheat beer from extract
I use a local supplier's (Steinbart's in Portland, OR) wheat extract which is
65/35 wheat to malt ratio.  This is also available as Northwestern wheat malt
I believe.  My recipe tends to be on the strong side as I buy it in 7# buckets
and usually end up with an OG of 1.055.  You can try to use 2 3.3# cans of a
good wheat extract just be sure it is in the 60/40 ratio range.  For hops I
use
approximately 15 IBUs of German noble hops, Hallertauer or Tetts.  I
personally
prefer the Weinstephan (sp) wheat yeast and it gives a great spicy/banana
aroma
and flavor which is appropriate.

To all those club members who helped found thier club,


I am in the early stages of founding a Homebrew club in my hometown of
Jackson Michigan. There are clubs in Kalamazoo, Lansing, Williamston and Ann
Arbor, but all are over 45 minutes away. The local Brew Pub has been itching
to start a club, so with thier help (as host) we have have a place to meet,
drink and discuss homebrewing. Dave Dahl from the FORD club is joining me on
this quest, he has a copy of the FORD clubs by-laws and general info. Would
any of you be willing to send me similar information for comparison? I have
contacted the AHA a couple of times, but their club program administrator,
Brian Rezac, Has yet to respond. (its been a week, maybe he's on vacation?
yea right;<) So I put out my quest for information to the most responsive and
knowledgeable resource I know--YOU!!!! (bless your hearts)

extract with specialty grains recipe would be best, but if you've got an 
all-grain recipe I'll take that too.  


Thanks in advance.

I'm brewing a California Common this weekend and was thinking about 
kraeusening the beer for conditioning. There seems to be a shortage 
of information on this other than how it is done. What I need to know 
is for a 1.050 gravity beer, how much wort do I need to cask 
condition (in a 5 gallon corny) the beer. I was planning on pullin 
off a quantity of the wort before hopping to store for the kraeuesen 
step. At kegging time, I was thinking about taking the reserved 
portion of wort and re-boiling it to sterilize it and priming the keg 
with it. Am I on the right track? If so, how much wort should I use? 
If not, what would be a better way?

HBD-
 
Just thought I'd chime in about thermometers:  One point I haven't seen made
about glass thermometer accuracy is the type of glass thermometer used:
There are two types- total immersion and partial immersion thermometers.
Partial immersion thermometers have an immersion line, usually a few inches
above the bulb.  If they are immersed deeper than that, they will give an
inaccurate reading.  Conversly, if a total immersion thermometer is not
properly immersed (all but 12mm into the fliud), it will not read properly.
 
There are Emergent Stem Correction formulas.  If anyone is interested, e-mail
me directly, I don't want to waste bandwidth yet (that is coming).
 
I made some interesting hop tea the other day- I took 1/2 ounce Cascade hops
that had spent 1 week dry hopping an APA, boiled it in 2 qts water, diluted to
one gallon and sweetened with 3/4 corn sugar.  Its good for beddybye time.  If
you try it, avoid dropping the hop bag in the trub.
 
Now for the wasted bandwidth:  Lets all learn to laugh at ourselves, then
then hold hands and sing Kum-by-ya.

1. What are all the possible rests one might use in beer making (arranged in
    order of temperature).


2.  What are the benefits of each?


3.  What are the implications of undershooting or overshooting on 
     temperature?  


4.  What are the implications of undershooting or overshooting on time?


5.  What is the importance of mash-out?

I disagree.  I could barely contain myself as our guide explained what
was done in the cooper's room at the Tadcaster Brewery (Samuel Smith's).
I could not wait to ask if the casks were lined or unlined.  The answer
is: they are unlined.  As far as I know, all brewers in the UK that
currently distribute beer in oak casks (there are only a handful)
do so in *unlined* casks.

Untrue as you have noted in your followup post.  The old Ballentine's IPA,
Rodenbach and Rodenbach Grand Cru, and Petrus are four beers that definitely
have an intentional oaky flavour/aroma.


>Maybe it was the pitch coating on the inside of the cask no longer lending
>that superior flavor to the Ballantines! Maybe it was nostalgia.


No, they were unlined, American Oak casks and it didn't take long for the
oakiness to be imparted.  Note that European Oak (and well-used European
oak at that: would you send your new casks to India or your beat-up ones?)
casks were used to send IPA to India.  European oak imparts far less oakiness
than American oak.  The makers of Ballentine's were trying to be authentic
but they accidentally created a new style.

Yes, I do... I rest for 15 to 30 minutes at 135-140F when I use malts
that create a lot of hot and cold break (like DWC Pale Ale and Pils).

You are making a very big assumption that all other casks are lined.  The
fact is that they are not.

I've had Samuel Smith's "from the wood" at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese in 
London and there was a slight woody character (mahogany (sp?) I wrote
in my notes) in *one* of the beers.  Note that I also tasted that same
character in the same beer from a bottle in the US (beer which had never
seen wood) so that suggests that the woodiness was *not* from the wood
cask.  Oh... just wanted to point out that London is pretty far from
Tadcaster and that the beer tasted the same in both London and Tadcaster.

I believe that the larger and larger tuns were simply to have bragging
rights (and perhaps for advertising reasons).

My point is that you don't want an oak flavour in your IPA.  The wood
was European oak and the casks were old and well-used.  The only beer
style you would want an oaky character is in a Flanders Red Ale (like
Rodenbach or Petrus).  Also, 4 ounces of American oak chips in 5 gallons
of beer is going to give you a *lot* of oak flavour.


As for trying to use an American oak cask for your Red Ale, the oakiness
subsides after each batch you use the cask for, but I suggest no more
than a week on the first batch.  I went two weeks and despite the fact
that I had filled the cask with water and soaked it for nearly 6 months,
changing the water eight or ten times, the beer was way overdone.
If you still don't believe me that American oak is different from European,
compare my "two weeks were too much" with the fact that Rodenbach
Grand Cru is kept in their oak tuns for up to two years and they
disassemble their tuns after every one or two batches (I don't recall)
and scrape a fine layer of wood off to expose fresh wood.


Finally, the purpose of using oak casks for making purecultureLambic (pLambic)
is not so much for the flavour (both J-P Van Roy and Henri Vandervelden (sp?)
were quite clear that you don't want any oakiness picked up from the wood...
Henri uses only chestnut casks at Oud Beersel and only half the casks at
Cantillon are oak!) but that it appears that some of the microbiota in Lambic
prefer a *small* amount of oxygen during fermentation.  On the Lambic Digest
it has been suggested that pLambics fermented in wood and plastic were
generally superior to those fermented in glass (but this is from a very
small sample and purely speculation at this point).

Subject: LACTIC ACID SOLUTION


I'm getting tired of e-mailing this to everyone.


LACTIC ACID SOLUTION


I use Miller's technique of mixing 2 tsp 88% lactic acid to 3 cups water
(Complete Handbook of Homebrewing,1st ed. p. 73).  Then I add this solution
to my  sparge water.  I generally need 1.25 -1.50 cups/27 litres of solution
to lower the pH from 8 to about 5.7. Mix it into all your sparge, mash out,
and hop sparge water at once if possible.  Don't mix up too much solution at
once as it doesn't keep (snowflakes ppt).  If you do so, throw it in the
fridge.  It'll keep 3 weeks - maybe longer.


Some guys use an eyedropper or small ear/eye drop dispenser but I feel the
"solution" is easier.  I also put 5 drops of 88% lactic acid (full strength)
in my airlocks.

Rob Kienle wants a recommendation for the best/easiest to use Counter
Pressure filler


Contact Braukunst 800(?) theirs was selected by Zymurgy or BT a few moths
ago as the best and easiest to use, I believe.  They have one which is
relatively easy to clean and has a small amount of metal to cool. The
exhaust port is an adjustable spring loaded ball valve. I made a very minor
modification which allows me to reach the bottom of short and tall bottles
just by sliding the stopper up and down on a  ( 3/4 inch?) longer piece of
tubing than supplied.  After I finished modifying it, I realized I could
have simply put a short  piece of plastic tubing on the beer tube and I
could have reached the bottom of all bottles.  Such is the life of the A/R
brewer.


(besides yet another trip to Home Depot to build my
Own!)?


Don't bother it will cost as much or more if you make it from brass, will
be bigger and have a lot more places to clean ( or infect your beer).  Been
there, done that.  It does make a nice bar ornament though.
- ---------------------------------------------
Sorry, I lost the inquirer's name:


Questions are 1.) has anybody tried the mini keg sytems? , and are they a
Good investment?


They are if you don't have a spare refrigerator or place to put a spare
refrigerator and you want beer on tap instead of the bottle.  They do give
an excellent head to beer because they have a very fine needle control
valve but decarbonate the beer in the process.  Be sure you buy the geman
brand which  is mostly stainless steel.  I have heard from my HB  guy that
the all plastic ones stink and he had to return them because they were not
reliable.  Others have given me the same story.  You can recycle the
plastic and rubber fittings by using a pair of needle nosed pliers to pull
the rubber stopper out of the keg after you finish the beer.  They can't
take too much carbonation sugar as you will get bulging of the ends and
crinkling of the metal.  Stay around 4 ounces of sugar or below per 5
gallons of beer.  Don't plan on carbonating with those little cartridges. 
I don't know of a fitting which will allow you to carbonate with a CO2
cylinder. Anybody?  The cans can't be moved too much since they are
naturally carbonated - sorta like the bottles. 


My preference would be a cornie keg system for a little more money.  You
can force carbonate or naturally carbonate as you wish. You can adjust the
carbonation level as you wish during the life of the beer  With the
appropriate attachments you can filter and counterpresssure fill bottles. 
Some 3 gallon kegs are making their way into the used market now so this
may be a solution for all.


Just a thought,  you can even fill the above minikegs with carbonated beer
and have beer on tap in your regular fridge. In the absence of a separate
dedicated beer fridge, to fill them, you would have to cool the cornie,
perhaps with ice for several hours, but it might work.


 2.) I am using bleach to sanitize....Okay or not.


Generally a good idea, just don't soak any stainless steel pressure vessels
( like a cornie) in a bleach solution for a long time as you will get
corrosion and cracks which can cause the cornie to leak or rupture.  There
are sanitizers which are not chloride containing and are recommended for
S.S. For most plastic and glass containers I use a small amount of bleach
full strength  ( the caustic helps lift organic compounds) , coat the
insides by rotation and then dilute it, then rinse with boiling water three
times. ALWAYS wear glasses and gloves when you are handling bleach. No beer
is worth an eye.  I also have a plastic apron ( with the Welsh language on
it) which I use to keep harmony with the chief clothes washer in the house.


 3.) What kind of beer or recipe can I make for guests and friends that
Do not share a passion for good beers....you all know the ones- That beer
is
Too dark, or that is too bitter, do you have coors light(egad). 


Buy them Coors Light. Or better, suggest to them to buy it themselves and
bring it to the party. Alternatively,  they might like a Kolsch style of a
blonde ale.  Not too bitter, not too dark,  juuust right.
