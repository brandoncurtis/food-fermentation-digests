Subject: RE: nitrogen/CO2




OK. I'm sure now, thanks to some tables published here earlier, that
nitrogen is soluble in beer, if only at 1/100th or so of the amount of CO2
under similar pressures.  I'll even lend that it might contribute to that
Guinness head, though evidence I've read suggests that the nitrogen
doesn't cause bubbles when it comes out of solution. 


Jeff Sturman asks about distributing beer using Nitrogen. The correct 
answer was given: if the beer is consumed quickly, sure: fine. If not, 
Henry's law will come into play and de-carbonate the beer by attempting 
to equalize the concentration of CO2 on each side of the beer/head 
boundary. That's it. 


The information recently published about "forcing nitrogen into the keg,
then dispensing with CO2" or "Must force carbonate with the mix or it
won't..." is somewhat misguided, in my opinion. Soluble gasses are soluble
independent (barring reactions) of other gasses present. Period.  If you
pressurize with nitrogen to saturation, you will then have to pressurize
with CO2 to saturation as well. Both will dissolve to the extent they are
capable of into the beer - independent of each other.  Henry's law. 


If you saturate with N2, then push with CO2, the N2 will come out of
solution in the keg as you dispense to equalize the apparent pressure on
each side of the beer/head boundary. Same as the converse. Henry's law. 


If you buy into the N2 contributing to the beer head, buy the mix. I use 
it to push 100% of my beers (though I've never noticed the difference in 
heading from the days I used only CO2...) through my draft system. The 
expense isn't prohibitive, and they can modify your existing CO2 
cylinder to accept it for about $11. Regulator's the same as for CO2.


See ya!

Subject: NA Beer


HBDers -


I recently was requested by a friend who cannot have alcohol to make a 
"no-alcohol" beer.   In reading the contributions to THE BREWERY on this 
subject, I was able to take a case of dissappointing IPA, heat it to 180 for 
15 minutes, and then force cool, rack to a keg, and force carbonate.  For what 
it is intended to be, it turned out quite well.  There are some definite 
off-flavors that were generated from the heating -- mostly a corn-like DMS 
taste, but nothing unobjectionalbe. And to my surprize, the hop character made 
it though, for the most part.   In fact, I find the beer quite enjoyable.  


But here's my question.  From Jack Schmedling's (sic) BREWERY article, he 
suggests that this method will make a beer of 1 to 1.5 percent alcohol. 
Commercial NA types go to about 0.5 percent.  Now I drank a pint of this stuff 
on a completely empty stomach yesterday, and didn't feel any significant 
effects of the residual alcohol.  Is there any relatively cheap/effective way 
to measure the alcohol content?  I am not adverse to sending off to a lab, so 
long as it isn't too expensive.  I'd like to get some assurance that this beer 
will be OK to serve to my friend.  The last thing I want to do is trigger some 
sort of relapse.

Subject: Thermometers


Hi,


I broke mine in the boil a couple of weeks ago.  I'm currently 
drinking the batch, and haven't noticed any unusual flavors or 
smells.  


After discovering the thermometer I took it out of the wort and 
boiled it in water briefly to determine if the plastic substance 
holding the lead beads would disovle.  It did not appear to.


I personally do not think you have anything to worry about, others 
may disagree.


I'm in the process of tracking down a mercury based laboratory 
thermometer.  If that breaks anywhere in the processes the whole 
batch will need to be flushed.


Out of curiosity, does anyone know if the red alchohol in some of 
these thermometers is toxic?

Subject: Carbonizer




Laura in N.C. wrote about some equipment her dad picked up,                     
specifically a unit called the "Carbonizer."                                    


While I've never seen on in action, I also came across one at a large           
auction.  I spied two brand-new looking towers connected to a double-1/2barrel  
keg cooler, much like you see in Rapids.  Along with the entire unit was        
a small electric motor and the words "Carbonizer".  The unit was in pretty      
bad condition, but I was intrigued about free Carbon Dioxide.                   


To make a long story short, I bought the entire freezer, taps, and misc.        
for $3.  But since I was 200 miles from home, I had to disassemble everything   
that would fit in my car, and leave the rest.  I got the two towers, some       
Sankey keg fittings, a S.S. drip tray, but left behind the actual freezer,      
carbonizer (Couldn't get the bolts off), and some other junk.                   
It was only later that I found out the whole thing costs $1500 new.  Dooh!      


Anyway, Laura, let us all know how it works.  It sounds interesting!

Hi Ellery,
I have a recipe for you, Actually two!  Boil the wort for both recipies a
long time (2 hours)


The first is a belgian wheat ale (my recipe).  It is not however a White
beer.
5 gallon recipe


5lbs wheat/barley dry malt extract
1 lb orange blossom honey
half pound crystal malt (60 lovibond)
1 1/2 oz Hallertauer hops (60 Min)  
1/2 oz Hallertauer (30 Min)
1/2 oz Hallertauer (15 Min)
Wyeast 3942 (in primary)
Wyeast Brettanomyces (in seconday) about 2-3 weeks
Prime the beer with 5/8 cup of honey.


use blow-by method for primary.  Use hop bags for hops leaves.
ferment at high temperature 75-80 degrees in primary only.


Age as long as posible in bottle so as to obtain a mature taste (3+ weeks)


- ----------------------


the 2nd recipe is for a Belgian Farmhouse Saison. (my recipe)
(it contains more grains than 1st recipe)


3 1/3 lbs extra light malt extract (liquid)
3/4 lb of light malt extract (dry)


:mash grains at approx 145-155 degrees for about 90 min (very crude mash
method)
if possible buy some amylase powder and add a small amount (1/4 teaspoon or
less) to mash.


1/4 lb Belgian Special -B malt if avail, or Crystal malt (120 lovibond)
1 lb Cara-pils malt
2 lbs 6-row American pilsener malt
1/2 lb unmalted oats
3/4 lb torrified wheat


2 oz Saaz hops (60 min)
1/4 oz Willamette hops (60 min)
1/2 oz Willamette hops (15 min)


1/3 oz coriander- freshly cracked (1 min, & steep till wort is cool)
Rind of 1 lime -dried (use the green part and make sure its dried well)
same as coriander
1/4 lb pitted prunes (chopped up) add at end of boil.


Wyeast 3942


Primary for a few days 3-4, then secondary till done


Good luck,
Chris Milmerstadt

Subject: Belgian White Beer


I recently made a batch of white beer using Wyeast Belgium White Beer
yeast. The O.G. was 1.052. The primary fermentation lasted about 5 days and
was
quite vigorous the first 3 days. It has been in the secondary for about a
month with the number of bubbles ranging between 1 per minute to 1 per two
minutes.
The beer smells great and there is no funny looking stuff floating around
in it.


Has anyone had a similar experience with this yeast?
Is it the yeast or something else?


Any Suggestions, comments, advice


Thanks,
Bob Tisdale

Subject: Clarification / Vitamin B


Matt Harper asked about clarifying his beer, after forgetting the Irish moss in
the boil.  Irish Moss works in the boil to coagulate large break.  It's effect
in the fermentor will be negligible.  My recommendations are Isinglass four
days prior to bottling, to settle suspended yeast, and either Polyclar or
Silica Gel two days prior to bottling (I'm partial to Polyclar) to settle
suspended chill-haze-forming tannins or proteins, respectively.  I've seen the
recent discussion on gelatin, and that works fine, as well.  Some people claim
it is not as effective as Isinglass, but I haven't seen any difference.  I just
have a stock pile of isinglass, so that's what I use.  Waiting for all of the
suspended stuff to settle out is also an option.  It all depends on when you
want your beer to be clear.


I'm also intrigued by the discussion on the potency of homebrew.  My girlfriend
has a noticably pleasant reaction after very little homebrew.  She's a
lightweight, anyway, but even my lower alcohol beers affect her rapidly.  I,
too, for that matter, have noticed the effects of my beer rather quickly.  My
theory, FWIW, is the abundance of Vitamin B in the beer.  Having bottle
conditioned the beer, there is a lot of live yeast in the bottle, and hence a
lot of Vitamin B.  People have often claimed that Vitamin B helps cure
hangovers because of it's ability in alcohol metabolisation.  If it metabolizes
alcohol that quickly OUT of your system, does it stand to reason that it will
metabolize alcohol INTO your system as quickly?

I got a flier in the mail from Yeas Tech Labs.  "Pitch5 provides homebrewers
with a pure, liquid yeast slurry that contains enough cells to pitch a 5 gallon
batch of homebrew".


Is this vague or what?  How many cells are in a container?  Or is this just like
White Labs and their pint sized starter euqivalent?  


"Pitch is stable at refrigeration temperature for more than 30 days. However,
we recommend purchasing your yeast as close to brew day as possible."


"Active fermentation should be observed within 24 hours of pithcing"


I really don't think I'm going to be storing yeast for 30 days or buying 2-4
week old yeast at a shop and expecting this to be enough cells to pitch 5
gallons.  I certainly hope this stuff is born-on dated.


Call me skeptical.

Subject: Small-scale filtering


I have a friend who has digestive problems with the yeast in homebrew, and I'd
like to filter kegged beer on a small scale (maybe an in-line filter on a keg
tapper line).  I don't want to filter entire batches, and small-scale
filtering with a large filter results in significant waste due to beer in the
filter.  Can someone remind me of how fine a filter I need (to achieve
commercial filtering results); and does anyone know of such a small, in-line
filter (medical, chemical, etc.)?

Subject: carbonation requires carbon


     Jeff innocently asked a question regarding dispensing with pure N2, 
     and has received a bunch of public replies, some of which are pretty 
     confounding.  Erik posts that you have to carbonate the keg first with 
     nitrogen???  Anybody else there see something wrong?
     
     I posted to Jeff privately about my experiences pushing beer through a 
     Murphy's tap, with pure N2, which I have been doing for nearly four 
     years.  Works like a charm.  Things to watch out for: properly 
     carbonate the keg to an appropriate level prior to dispense.  Most 
     beers I push out of my N-rig I purposefully carbonate to a low level, 
     estimated 1.5 - 2 atm.  Higher CO2 levels will create very foamy beer 
     when dispensed at high N2 top pressure.  I use a regulator setting of 
     about 45 psi to push the beer through the tap.  Usually (depending on 
     how fast the beer is consumed) I will add CO2 to the keg twice, by 
     bleeding off some top pressure add hooking the CO2 can back up with 
     its regulator set on 45.  I let that run in for 5-10 seconds, then 
     hookup the N again.  This is to retain an appropriate level of 
     carbonation throughout the life of the keg, because as George I 
     believe pointed out, as headspace increases, the partial pressure of 
     CO2 goes down, dissolved CO2 outgasses, and the kegged beer slowly 
     looses carbonation.  This method effectively mixes gasses using two 
     separate cans, albeit in a crude way.  
     
     With N having solubility constants roughly two orders of magnitude 
     less than carbonic, it is likely that there is a rather low level of 
     nitrogenation going on, but actual dissolved N levels in finished 
     products dispensed as such would be an interesting measurement.

My guess is no.  My hope is no, or I despair for the 20 year old ports and
brandies, and the 12 year old Scotch and Irish in my cellar.  I'm not sure
what "aged" ethanol would be, except that it would no longer be ethanol,
and I doubt any such effects over the time period of which we are
speaking. Instead I suspect one or more of the following:


1. your homebrew is generally stronger than the commercial beers you are
   comparing it against or 


2. the homebrew contains some other nutrient or substance that increases
   your alcohol uptake rate or


3. The situations under which you drink commercial versus home brews
   affects the way that alcohol affects you.  For example, homebrews are
   often drank alone without food.


4. You are drinking the wrong commercial brews.

Dalton's Law says: The total pressure exerted by a mix of ideal gasses
in a closed container is equal to the sum that each individual gas
exerts


                Total P = P1 + P2 + P3


In the case of CO2 and N2 blends, this means


        2 PSI CO2   + 8 PSI N2  = 10 PSI total in the head space.


Who cares? -- Well total P is the pressure that forces the beer out 
of the keg to the faucet, so it is critical in controlling the 
flow rate and foaming  at the faucet. (Aside: foaming is also a 
function of temperature, turbulence, and disolved CO2)


What's in the beer?  The amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is
proportional to the "partial pressure" exerted by the gas in the head
space. And, because for this temp/press range gases behave close to
ideally, this dissolution is INDEPENDENT of the total pressure. I.e.
using the above example, the amount of CO2 in solution is proportional
to 2 PSI (partial pressure of CO2) and not 10 PSI (the total gas
pressure).  


Who cares? We all do! 1) You have to apply enough total
pressure to the beer to get it to the faucet, 2) but the amount of CO2
in a beer has big contributions to the
taste/mouth-feel/pour-behavior(foaming) etc. 3) Nitrogen is relatively
insoluble in beer, so even at high pressure not much ends up in
solution. That is why Nitrogen is used:  for stouts, folks expect a low
amount of dissolved CO2 gas, which means use a low partial pressure
CO2, but folks also want the stout to come out of the faucet (can't
drink it if it doesn't come out :-) and to develop a head.  


A guiness faucet is restricted (narrower than other 
beer faucets); the extra pressure supplied by the N2 pushes it through 
the faucet at a good rate, the turbulence created by the restriction 
and increased flow rate helps add head where the lack of dissolved C02
(due to low partial pressure) wouldn't normally do it on its own.


So, if you carbonate, then charge with pure N2 and no CO2, over
time your carbonation level will fall (if the head space is pure N2
then the partial pressure of CO2 is zero and CO2 will come out of
solution until the partial pressure is in equilibrium with the solubile
portion). This also means that over time the total pressure in the head
will increase. So depending on how long you're going to serve out of
one keg, it may be critical to supply a mixed supply. Other gases 
could be used other than N2, but they have to meet some criteria:
relatively low solubility, non-reactive, relatively safe for humans, 
and cheap. Turns out that N2 is used because it best fits the criteria.

DeClerk (50 yr old info) says the proteolytic content of Pale Ale Malts (

Contintental (lager,pils) Pale malts. I am not sure how valid this is

however, they still don't get the higher temperature toast at the end of
the kilning typical of British Pale Ale malts and I guess still should have
the higher enzyme content.

I always use grits as you have less chance to plug up in the lautering step
since grits are larger than cornmeal in most cases.  Also Grits are white
corn and most corn meal is yellow ( although the white is available). I
cook the grits in water until they thicken, add cold water to bring the
temperature down to about 150F and add water and the grist to bring it down
to the strike temperature. Take it through all the holds 122F, 135F and
155-158F.  I  also make a goods mash on occasion in which 10-15% of the
malt is added after cooling and a quick mash is carried out on the adjunct
to reduce its viscosity. Which method you use is determined by the amount
and type of adjunct added.  I use this method with cream of wheat and rice
or pearl barley (chipped to a small size in my mill before cooking) also. 
I have never tried these, but assume the "instant" cereals are
pre-gelatinized by heat or treated chemically.

Subject: Homebrew Club Articles / Harpers' Cloudy Dubbel


Scott Bridges said that George de Piro's reply to Pat Babcock's article about
homebrew club meeting speakers was perhaps not appropriate for this forum.
 While the HBD does seem to gravitate heavily toward the mechanics of
brewing, the success or failure of a homebrew club can have a significant
effect on one's source of information and enthusiasm for brewing, and thus I
think it's a very relevent topic.


Here in El Paso, I know that there are a lot of homebrewers, yet
participation in our club is waning badly.  Now, we're not exactly in
microbrew heaven out here (I wonder if setting up a brewpub in the New
Republic of Texas will be any easier than it was in the Old State...), so
coming up with guest speakers may be a more difficult proposition for us than
George out in Brooklyn.  The head brewers of the two prominent area brewpubs
are both active members and they do contribute monthly, but "new blood" is
always welcome.  This kind of thing would probably help boost attendence and
therefore the exchange of good information.


It's easy to "brew in a vacuum" when your pool of personal brewing contacts
dwindles due to club membership problems, especially in an isolated area like
El Paso, and this *directly* affects your brewing.  When there's no one
smarter than yourself around, you tend to think your poor to average efforts
are as good as it gets.  This can be a major turn-off especially for new
brewers who simply don't have access to information that would correct
problems in their brewing.


At the risk of being publicly flamed (oh yeah, like that'll be a first), I'd
like to *encourage* the more successful clubs to offer their recipes for
success on this forum.  It weighs directly upon our brewing skill, and it'll
make better brewers of us all.

the lightest-colored beer I've ever made, was made IM-less (stoopid) and
looked like Rio Grande mud.  I let it sit for several weeks (fake lagering)
with only modest improvement.  Finally I tossed in some Sparkolloid and like

it's three grams boiled briefly in a bit of water per five gallons.  BTW the

     Hi all,
     
     Somebody (sorry, can't remember who) asked if their would be enough 
     yeast left in suspension to carbonate the beer after gelatin fining.
     
     In my case, the beer is a lager and has been at 33F (0.5C) for 2 
     months, and is remarkably clear.  If I wanted to bottle condition it, 
     I would add a fresh dose of yeast.  It may carbonate without the extra 
     yeast, but it would take a long time (and maybe not work at all).
     
     With ales, it may be unnecessary to add fresh yeast, but again, if the 
     beer is very clear, it would speed things up to add fresh yeast.  If 
     you are concerned about the yeast not flocculating again, just use a 
     different strain that is known to flocculate well.

Subject: PH and Total Alkalinity - meaningful info?


Not wanting to ask any stupid questions, I'll try this inane one.


Recently I've noticed that boiled water is showing more and more white stuff 
(Ken Schwartz tells me its chalk) precipitating to the bottom of my kettle. 
I really only notice it when I'm trying to create jars of sterile water for 
yeast harvesting. It looks ugly enough that I don't really want to get my 
yeast mixed up with it.


Anyhow, I decided its been a year since I tested for alkalinity and so I 
took the following readings:


>From my well in the Sierra Foothills:
                 PH          Total Alkalinity
Cold Tap Water   7.0           190
Hot Water Tap    6.8           180
Cold Water Tap
   Boiled/Cooled 9.3           180


I don't even know if the readings make sense. I calibrated my ph meter 
immediately prior to taking these readings. The alkalinity came from my Spa 
chemical test kit.


Its a huge jump in ph of the boiled water. Should I be boiling water before 
mashing and then treating with acid? Or should I NOT pre-boil the mash 
water? My mashes tend to hit PH 5.3 with no addition of anything. If I do 
add gypsum, then they tend to come in at 5.2, not much change for 1 tsp. Am 
I wasting time and money? Ken suggested using the boiled and cooled water 
(if I read his comments right) and then treating with acid as opposed to 
gypsum because the alkalinity was already so high.


I was surprised that alkalinity didn't drop after boiling (20 minute boil).


Note also that the PH of the boiled water was 9.0 when it was 210F and rose 
up to 9.3 when it cooled overnight. I guess that means my meter is not 
temperature corrected or something else happened to the water when it 
cooled. Comments?

Subject: Re: botulism redux


Steve Claussen (SClaus4688`at`aol.com) asked some very good questions about
botulism.  I can't answer them completely, but at least I can add a little
bit of data to the discussion.


Botulism is caused by a toxin produced by strains of Clostridium
botulinum.  C. botulinum is a spore-forming anaerobic bacterium.  Spores 
of C. botulinum are commonly found in soil, especially soil that has been
fertilized with manure.  The spores are essentially metabolically
inactive, but can germinate under the appropriate conditions.  Once
growing and dividing, the bacteria will produce a toxin.


The toxin, when injested, is absorbed into the body and causes muscle
paralysis (blocks the release of acetylcholine -- a muscle
neurotransmitter).  The toxin will not affect bacteria or yeast growth.  
The toxin is quite resistant to the enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract,
and presumably the high acidity of the stomach.  I am not sure about its
resistance to oxygen, or byproducts of yeast fermentation, but I would
guess that it is not affected much by these factors.  However, the toxin is
heat labile, and is completely destroyed by boiling at 100C (212F) for 10
minutes (those of you at high altitude will want to boil longer).


Supposedly, infection of food by C. botulinum causes no change in the
taste or odor of the food.  C. botulinum is anaerobic and generates
energy by fermentation, so CO2 is probably released.  Therefore, an
infected can of food or wort could bulge, but would not necessarily do so.


The best way to kill C. botulinum spores is by heating them (in a wet
environment) to 121C for at least 15 minutes.  This is accomplished by
pressure canning.  Consulting a good canning manual will allow one to
determine if prolonged boiling in a water bath (maybe 1-2 hours) can
substitute for pressure canning for 15-20 minutes at 15psi.  If anyone
checks this out, please post the answer.


As was discussed previously, a perfectly acceptable way to avoid pressure
canning starter wort, yet still be safe, is to pre-boil the wort before
each use.


Hope this helps.


Cheers!

Laura,


CO2 beverage products (soda pop) use plain water that passes through the
"carbonizer".  The carbonizer is comprised of a compressor that force
carbonates the water from a CO2 source.  The now carbonated water is then
mixed with the syrup to make whatever product (coke, rootbeer, etc) is
desired.


Used carbonizers usually go for around $120, new ones for $300.  Your dad

Hello All!!


As a mini keg owner and regular user, I too have been plagued with the
regular problem of those expensive damn CO2 cartridges prematurely emptying
due to the poor seal at the "face" of the cartridge.


Here is a solution I discovered that works:


I went to my local auto parts shop, and bought a "rubber tire patch",
basically thin rubber gasket material that had a sticky back.


I took apart the Fass-Frisch valve assembly (you need a great BIG allen
wrench to get it apart), and cut two circular pieces of rubber to fit both
behind and in front of the nylon disk where the cartridge seats, having cut
a small hole in the center of the front rubber piece for the little metal
piercing tip to come through.


Long term storage is unknown at this point, but I can tell you that I tapped
a mini-keg almost two weeks ago, and I STILL have gas in the ORIGINAL CO2
cartridge, AND the beer is still carbonated!


Isn't it wonderful when one of your projects turns out great??!!??

The Big and Huge is a competition for higher-gravity beers
(1.050-1.060 is "Big"; >1.060 is "Huge").  Entries will be accepted in all
BJCP style categories for which the original gravity range includes 1.050 or
higher.  The gravity restriction excludes relatively few sub-categories,
although 1.050 is the top of the range for some categories, and entries must
meet the minimum gravity requirement even if the range for the style dips
below the 1.050 mark.  (We had to disqualify an entry last year because it was
an entry in an eligible style but not an eligible original gravity.)


Awards will be made in all styles (or combined style groupings) for which
there are at least five entries.  Winners from the style categories can
advance to a "mini-BOS" Big and Huge round (Big Ales, Huge Ales, Big Lagers,
Huge Lagers) for additional ribbons and prizes, and the best of the Big and
Huge round advance to Best of Show.  Brewing ingredient prizes have been

Jeff Sturman asks:


>One of my customers is hell bent on using nitrogen to serve his
>homebrew. He wants to know if he can carbonate the beer with 
>straight co2 and then serve the beer with straight nitrogen.  


As Erik Vanthilt said, this will not give the "guiness head"
effect. I suspect it would also end up with flat beer.  Nitrogen 
is not very soluable in beer (that's actually the point) and I 
suspect that over a week or so you would end up scrubbing
the CO2 out of suspension in the beer  - hence, flat beer. You would
probably need to keep nitrogen top pressure higher than is
practical for dispense in order to keep it carbonated (unless you 
are using the gas pressure to pump the beer up 2 flights of stairs) .


With mixed beer gas this works much better.  sometimes I force
carbonate with CO2 and then dispense with CO2/N2 beer gas.
This lets me put enough top pressure on to get a good seal on the 
lid (they often do not seal properly at 5-8 lbs - at least mine 
don't)  and still dispense a lightly carbonated bitter.  The partial
pressure of CO2 is enough enough to maintain the 1.2-1.5 
atmospheres of CO2 in the beer that I want.   You can use the 
temp/CO2 tables that are all over the net (and in Fix's 
Vienna book) to get it set right - just remember to use only the
partial pressure of the CO2 in your calculations.

Subject: homebrew alcohol content


i, too have noticed this effect of homebrew having a powerful 'kick'.  my
buddies and i regularly have a pint, and compare it to about three normal
commercial bottles.  why is this? 


i suspect strongly that it has to do with the carbonation.  as anyone will
tell you, sparkling white wines kick harder than regular ones.  similarly,
mixing a shot of booze with a (small) amount of fizz (club soda, cola,
etc) will also seemingly get the kick out.  my mom explained the chemistry
/ physiology of this to me when i was but a lad, but i have since
forgotten it.  so what is the relevance?  well, naturally carbonated
drinks have different sizes of bubbles than artificially carbonated ones.
i read this in a beginner's brewing book, so i assume everyone knows this.
well, these different sizes of bubbles, coupled with the greatly increased
head retention of homebrewed beers, i believe, add up to more co2 ending
up in the stomach, where alcohol absorption _starts_ (unlike food
absorption, which doesn't start until the jejunum).  i believe that
therefore, the alcohol will hit you faster, and thus have an initial
higher b.a.c., the 'kick'.


here's an experiment to try: take a few bottles of un-primed beer.
artificially carbonate them.  take a few more.  put them aside.  then take
a few and do as you normally do.  then take a few and over-prime them (but
only a little).  get a few friends over and, over the course of a few
days, compare the kick.  ignoring the (very) minor contribution of etoh by
the priming sugars, i predict the kick will be as follows:
        over-primed > primed > artificially carbonated > flat




ps to whoever suggested the "young" alcohol theory.  unless there is more
to this theory than you have written, it is... flawed.  alcohol (at least
the kind you _want_ to drink) is etoh, or ethanol.  regardless of how long
it takes to make it, or how long it's been sitting, etoh is etoh.


of course, i could be wrong.
