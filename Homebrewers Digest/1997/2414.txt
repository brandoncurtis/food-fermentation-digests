 The problem is not the bacteria which are pretty easily killed as you
indicated, but the *spores* of the bacteria  which are stable to
non-pressure cooking temperatures for a long time. I recommend you always
boil any wort you have canned before you use it to be sure any potential
toxin is destroyed. I really suggest you just use dried or liquid malt
extract for your starters.

My hop plants are now about 1 1/2 feet high and I need to create a 
Trellis for them to grow upward. I am not sure what type of wire, 
String, etc to use that won't damage the vine but will also sustain 
The weight of the heavy vines. 
                                           
The most important thing is that once the hops get fully grown ( about 18
 -20 feet high) that they can withstand a strong wind. Imagine if you had a
sail the size of your hop garden what it would take to keep it stable in a
strong wind.  A set of strong supports - say telephone poles or such if you
planted a lot or a teepee of three smaller sized poles, with wire supports,
as the end supports will help keep the whole thing from falling over.  Also
at the top, use a very heavy braided wire to support the various twine
streamers up which the hop vines will climb.  I put mine up against my
three story house, despite the lack of full sunshine, to prevent this
possibility and to avoid the major construction effort. Besides it is
prettier.


Use heavy twine for the streamers as you will be cutting the vines down in
the fall by cutting the streamers at the top and pick the hops from the
vines while you are standing on the ground. Even if you multiple crop the
hops, by allowing more vines to develop after June and therefore pick  from
a ladder most of the season,  you will still cut the vines down in the
fall. . In the early part of the season cut back the vines to three or four
per streamer, so they can develop well without self competition and
producing a lot of vines with no product. Water well during the growth
period, mulch them and give them plenty of fertilizer and well rotted
manure. 


Some people pick off the lower six feet of leaves after the vine is grown
in the belief that this reduces mildew, by preventing it from spreading up
from the ground.  Use a Bordeaux mixture or the like early in the season,
but give it plenty of time to dissipate before you pick. Yeasts don't like
copper or other fungicides in your beer and neither will you. Water early
in the morning and never in the evening to reduce mildew possibility.      
                  
- ----------------------------------------------------
Kevin Kanes' textbook answer and other comments relating to the higher hop
and alcohol content in homebrew  do not answer the question first posed by
someone here about "fresh" beer having a quicker effect than that same beer
drunk some weeks later.


I too have noticed that a new keg often produces a quick wooziness in a
very short time on the order of 10 minutes, almost like a change in blood
pressure effect or that first puff on a pipe (tobacco!),  not really
connected with the alcohol content, but could be mistaken for it.  Since,
in most cases, I lager in the presence of yeast, the first beers are really
in a totally reduced state and may contain compounds that get oxidized over
time from the carbonation of the beer, by leaky hose fittings, etc. Or they
peak out and decline naturally with time. 


Another datapoint is that this occurs to nearly all drinkers at the same
session, yet in a few weeks the same drinkers do not experience this effect
with the same beer.  This could argue that it is food or atmosphere
related, but I really do not believe these can adequately explain all the
manifestations of the effect, especially the quick hit nature that has
drinkers saying "Wow, this is strong!"..


I don't know, but I can vouch that I and a number of others here have found
this time/age dependent effect of beer which obviously does not relate to
the alcohol or hops content, both of which are constant in any given beer
over time.

You forgot to turn off the burner?? {8^)


Actually it may have been superheated on the bottom because it was deep and
clean and new and you provided a surface for the steam bubbles to form onto
when you put the chiller into it. Probably after you use this a few times,
scratches in the kettle will prevent this from happening.  I suggest you 
remove it from the burner and carefully stir the wort before you add the
chiller in the future.

You should set up a couple poles and run wire between them at
least 12ft high. This wire is what really holds most of the weight.
Put a steak in the ground near the base of each bunch. If you
run Vs from the wire to each steak  with twine it will work great.
I let 2 or 3 vines run up each leg of the V and cut all others
to the ground.


The hops will wrap around the twine and climb as high as they can.
(They always outgrow my 12ft wires, 15ft is better). I have never had
the twine break. Cut the twine down each season and harvest your
buds.


good luck,
dean

Subject: Gambrinus Honey Malt


Members of our homebrew club have an offer to get some whole malts from one of
our local microbreweries.  He has been using a new Gambrinus brand malt 
called Honey Malt.  It is apparently a pale malt.  Have any of the collective
used this malt in any homebrewing recipes, and care to comment on how they
turned out?  The brewer didn't tell us specifically which beers and what
proportion of the malt bill he was using this malt in, but he really liked it.
Four of our club members visited the brewery last week and had a round of
samplers of his current beers, and although good beers, they were for the most
part very similar in flavor and malt profile, except for some slight variations
in color and hop varieties/amounts.  Private e-mail is fine, or a post here
for others who might be interested.

Subject: corn, corn, chicken and corn!


     Just to follow up on Jeff's excellent post on the use of corn:  I have 
     been using polenta in place of flaked corn or grits or meal for about 
     six years.  All polenta is is coarse corn meal, but the size of the 
     grits appear to be about 5 times that of the boxed corn meal.  Polenta 
     does come in a number of renditions: basic, quick, and prepared (that 
     stuff in the funky tube).  The quick stuff is similar to quick oats in 
     that it has been largely pregelatinized, presumably by steam.  I 
     always use the basic stuff, available in bulk from most coops and the 
     like.  It is cheap, and works well.  It does require a true cereal 
     cook, but hey, thats part of the fun.  Polenta is also quite good 
     outside of beer -- See the Greens cookbook for a keeper.
     
     In addition to the wonderful CAP style that Jeff almost single 
     handedly ressurected, corn is also most welcome in Cream Ales.  Wahl 
     Henius have ratios on the order of 20% - 25%, and that seems to work 
     well.  Another endemic style that has drifted toward lackluster 
     flavor, but it doesnt have to be so.

Subject: Nitrogen and Stout


Just to add a few particulars to the nitrogen thread-
Part of the reason that a dispense with nitrogen at high pressure (through an 
appropriate restrictor plate, such as on a Guinness tap) yields such a tight, 
heavenly head is precisely because it is not very soluble in beer. Those teeny 
little bubbles form, as we know, with a mixture of N2 and CO2 inside. Once 
formed, the bubbles tend to maintain their integrity because the N2 is 
reluctant to migrate out of its liquid shell and into other bubbles. This 
process of disproportionation consequently happens at a slow rate. Other 
factors obviously play a role, beta-glucans, etc. but this piece seems to be 
key.

Subject: na beer


someone wrote in about brewing no- alcohol beer.  can't help you in how 
to make it, but here's how to tell if you've done it right:
ok, this is simple, but requires precision.  
1. take the sg of the beer (with proper temperature conversions), call
that sg1
2. measure _exactly_ one pint of beer, flat.
3. in a glass or enamel pan, _boil_ to about 1/2 pint.  this will boil off
_all_ the etoh.
4. with distilled water, top it off to exactly one pine again.  do not
use tap water.
5. cool the sample.
6. read the sg, and convert for current temperature.  call that sg2
7. subtract sg2 from sg1.  this is the "spirit indication"
8. spirit indication                alcohol (% by volume)
        0                        0
        1.5                        1
        2                        1.3
        3                        2
        4                        2.7
        5                        3.4
etc.  sorry, but this was adapted from _the art of wine_ by anderson and
hull, 1971, so no data on how to get .5%


on a side note, re:relapse... from a medical perspective, and being from a
family of alcoholism... .5% is not acceptable.  abstinence is.  that
means
0%.  i'll get off my horse now.

Subject: flavoring with apples




I'm getting ready to brew a sour apple weisse beer, and I was looking
for some feedback on my method of extracting the apple flavor.  I was
figuring on using about 5 lbs. of baking apples, cored and sliced, and
freezing them to burst the cell walls.  At the end of the boil I was
going to add the now room temperature apple fragments to the hot wort.
This should be enough to drop the temperature of the whole shebang to
about 170F, which will eliminate the pectin problem.  While the apples
steep, I'll be chilling the wort with my immersion chiller.  This
usually takes about 30 minutes, so that's how long the apples will
steep.  After that I'll rack to the primary, and use the spent,
sugar-coated apples to make apple pies.


Does this seem like it will generate enough of an apple flavor?  The
beer will be pretty light (a 1.040 weisse beer), so too much flavor
would be overwhelming, but I'm concerned I'll go through all this
trouble and end up with no apple taste.


Would it make more sense to use a "100% pure apple juice" rather than
going through the whole steeping business?

Subject: Priming NA beer


  I am about to try making a small batch of NA beer, by the method of
heating to 180F, holding 15-30 mins, cooling, and bottling with fresh yeast
and priming sugar.
  My question has to do with how much priming sugar to use. I usually use
the well-known calculations attributed to Dave Draper and others to
calculate priming sugar by weight. For this NA beer, should I assume that
all CO2 has been driven off by the alcohol-reducing process, or would there
still be some CO2 in the beer?

Subject: RE:No- and Low-Alcohol Brewin


I was thinking about this NA beer stuff. Is it possible to put the beer in a
vacuum and evaporate the alcohol without heating it? I am guessing that the
vapor pressure of ETOH is less than H2O and that you could do a low
temperature ETOH reduction.


But I could be wrong. 


If you could actually do this, the taste would be off as alcohol adds a
warming feeling to the palate. I would think that a small amount of cayenne
pepper might replace this.

Subject: Alcohol Determination with Limited Equipment:


Dear all,


I knew who to ask on this one, My namesake. He was an amatur wine maker for
25+ years before he took a golden parachute from AMOCO to do it full time. So
please don't confuse Enologist-Phil with Zymurgist-Phil of the Poison Frog
Home Brewery.


Enologist-Phil Writes:


The following procedure was used by an advanced winemaker friend that did not
have distillation apparatus or specialized equipment.


In order to use this procedure, one needs an accurate thermometer, volumetric
flask,  hydrometer jar, and narrow range hydrometer calibrated in specific
gravity.  First adjust the temperature of the near beer to 60 degrees F.
 Next pour the sample into a hydrometer jar and measure the specific gravity.
 Then transfer enouth of the sample to fill a volumetric flask of adequate
size.  Then transfer contents tents of the volumetric flask to a pan, taking
care to rinse the with clear water so that all the beer solution  is in the
pan.  Next heat the solution to a slow boil and boil off enough volume so
that there is less than the initial volume remaining.  Next return the boiled
volume to the volumetric flask,  return to 60 degrees F, and make up the lost
volume so that now have the same volume as started with, all at 60 degrees F.
 Next transfer contents to a hydrometer jar and measure the specific gravity.
 Measure the change in specific gravity, as only alcohol is presumed to have
evaporated.  The following change in specific gravities relate to per cent
alcohol.  No change is 0%,  an increase of .0015 corresponds to an alcohol of
1%, an increase of .0030 is an alcohol of 2%, an increase of .0044
corresponds to 3%, etc.  You get the idea.  At this low concentration every
increase in specific gravity of about .0075 corresponds to 0.5% alcohol.
There are more accurate methods available, but they require quite a bit of
equipment.  The easiest method is with an eulliometer.  As a winery
consultant I could run this test as a modest fee, if desired.
Good luck with your work.  Commercially, the alcohol is eliminated with
reverse osmosis.  The temperature in not elevated and so there is not much
deterioration in beer character.  Another possibility might be to carbonate
the wort and bottle it directly.  In that case there would not be any
alcohol.  Or bottle the wort with only enough sugar to give say 1/2% alcohol.


Phil-The Enologist  Enologist`at`aol.com


Phil-The Zymurgist doesnt recommend the last sentence. Making a wort with
only enough sugar to make 1/2% alcohol is pretty thin beer. This might result
in making budmilloors look and taste quite good in comparison. and we wouldnt
want that to happen....;<)

Subject: Trub


I am curious what precautions all of you take to eliminate trub from your 
primary fermentors.  Dave Miller recommends racking your beer off of the 
trub a couple of hours after it has been in the carboy and the trub has 
settled.  He further comments that compounds found in trub can lead to 
fusel alcohols in your beer.  One article in Zymurgy on the subject said 
the presence of trub can also lead to long term instability in your beer.


My comments:


1)  I have found that it takes about 12 hrs for all of the trub to settle 
in my primary.  Try as I might, I have not been able to keep it from 
getting in there in the first place.  I filter my wort with a very fine 
nylon filter, but much of it passes through.


2)  Can I wait until the next morning to rack off of the trub?  What are 
the risks of reintroducing oxygen at this stage?  I believe the yeast 
would be in exponential phase at this stage and a small amount of oxygen 
should not be a problem.  Certainly not any more than normal racking to 
secondary fermentation.


3)  Does the benefit of removing trub outweigh the risk of increased 
contamination?


4)  Am I worrying too much about trub?


Just trying to improve my beers,

     I was in Indianapolis, IN last week and had a chance to try the Broad 
     Ripple Brewpub on the North side of Indianapolis.  It is a great local 
     brewpub with excellent beer.  Broad Ripple has a comfortable 
     neighborhood pub atmosphere.  They had 6 beers on tap (descriptions 
     below) and a number of guest beers. Like a good Homebrewer, I ordered 
     the sampler to get a taste of them all!  My favorites (in order) were 
     ESB, IPA, Porter, and Red Bird Mild.  The Lawnmower Pale Ale and White 
     River Wheat were average. 
     
     Lawnmower Pale Ale - Clean beer with little character, don't care for  
     light ales much
     Red Bird Mild - Good balance of malt and English hops; great session 
     beer
     ESB - Excellent beer, good English hop character, slight smoke flavor
     White River Wheat - Average wheat beer, could use more clove phenolics
     Monon Porter - Nice rich porter, slightly sweet
     Indiana Pale Ale (IPA) - Good malt flavor and body, nice wall of 
     bitterness, could use dry hopping

I believe that your efficiency was the same, but you used far
too low a pt/lb/gal value for the rye.  I believe that it is
close to 40, but I would have to work backwards using my
typical mash efficiency and run my rye beer recipe through it
(assuming the same efficiency).


Personally, I use my *real* expected pt/lb/gal for each grain
rather than a maximum (theoretical) value when I do my grain
calculations simply because it is one less multiplication
and I do all my recipes on paper rather than on a computer
(60 hours a week on a computer is enough!).

Subject: Adding "shit" to beer


     Hi all,
     
     Scott seems quite perturbed that some people add clarifiers to their 
     beer.  He claims to never have haze problems.
     
     Well, consider yourself very lucky, and please realize that not 
     everybody else is!  It is very rare for me to break the Reinheitsgebot 
     by adding clarifiers.  Occasionally, though, for no obvious reason, 
     I'll come across a batch that just won't clear, despite long, cold 
     lagering.
     
     In those instances a brewer has 3 choices:
     
     1.  Ignore the haze.  Not a good choice if the haze is yeast, as it 
     may adversely affect flavor.
     
     2.  Filter the beer.  Not a good choice if you a) don't own a filter 
     or b) are concerned about stripping desirable components from the 
     beer.
     
     3.  Try a fining agent.
     
     While I try to avoid it, there is nothing wrong with using fining 
     agents to clear a beer, in my opinion.  There are brewers that filter 
     beer prematurely, in an effort to get it to the customer more quickly, 
     but most homebrewers aren't going to be doing this.  Once the beer is 
     properly aged and tastes good, it is no sin to clarify it.
     
     Have fun!

Dear Friends,


After my long absence from the brew.net, my web pages have been 
updated and ensconced in their new home, thanks to Pat Babcock and 
Karl Lutzen.  I'm proud to have them housed on the HBD's own server 
at oeonline.com, where there should be few of the difficulties that 
plagued my online life while I was based in Australia.  


Since there are doubtless many who have joined HBD during the time I
have been away, allow me to give a brief rundown of what can be
found on my beer page:


FAQ files: links to the Yeast and Hops FAQs, a copy of Jim Busch's 
piece on malts and their characteristics, my compilation of water 
ionic compositions from many of the world's great brewing cities, and 
a link to AJ deLange's thorough discourse on modifying brewing waters 
to mimic many of those compositions.


Other items of interest:
Michael Taylor's SUDS recipe formulator, version 4.0a for Windows.  
This version fixes the bug that made for screwy mash-water 
calculations when using real (i.e. metric) units instead of those 
screwed-up british engineering units.


Pat Anderson's TinibuW for Windows, which allows calculation of IBUs 
using Glenn Tinseth's utilization data.


My summary of the _Brauwelt International_ article on First Wort 
Hopping, along with a table of results reported by homebrewers who 
have used the technique.


George Fix's original HBD posts on the 40-60-70 mashing procedure, 
and Kelly Jones's 1993 HBD post on calculating the temperatures and 
volumes of mash infusions.


List of links to other brewsites: many are very familiar already, 
some are not.


My own contributions: my essays on yeast culturing and slant use, 
and on priming bottled beer using weights of sugars rather than 
volumes (which was worked up into an article in the July/August '96 
issue of Brewing Techniques).

Subject: Old beer book value


I was hoping someone out there could help me assess the value of a 1965
edition of "The Curiosities of Ale & Beer"
by John Bickerdyke. It is a reprint of the original 1895 manuscript and
covers beer history, lore, origins of ale-houses, porter and stout origins,
laws and events concerning beer throughout the ages, and home-brewing. The
copy I am reviewing is in "very good" condition, as appraised by the local
antiquity book dealer, and he is asking $27.50 for it. Is this book one of
those classics that is referenced in most modern beer histories, or is it's
contents flawed historically (for instance, I know there are several takes
on the origins of porter)? Personally, I think it's a very interesting book
(I've only thumbed through it though), just wanted any background
available. I guess the bottom line is am I willing to pay $27.50 for it,
but I'd like to know if this is considered a rare find or not. Thanks!

Subject: two quick tips - floating thermometer and bottling


Just two quick tips that maybe everybody in the universe already knew but
really made an impression on me the first time I heard them. 


1. Floating thermometer: the mercury-in-a-tube kinds are too slow to respond
and are difficult to read without removing the thermometer from the stuff.
Try whacking off the bottom 1/2" of a styrofoam coffee cup and sticking your
dial-type thermometer through it. The styrofoam makes a nifty little boat,
and you can read the temp from directly above without touching the thermometer. 


2. When bottling, set the bucket from which you are siphoning on the
countertop, and set the clean bottles on the open door of the dishwasher.
Then, if you spill a bit, it gets cleaned up when you do your next load of
dirty dishes.

BALDERDASH!  I'm in year three for my Northern Brewer and Cascade 
and have used 16 or 18 gauge galvanized wire to support the vines.  
Last year the N. Brewer climbed to over 30 Ft (14m) high!  
However, I gave some extra support to the wire every 10 ft or so 
(tied it off to the chimney).  Since hops are a
bine (spelled correctly) they will spiral around the wire and will not
be cut by the wire.  I would NOT use string; it will rot and everything 
can then collapse.  They will also grow at an amazing rate; I've had up 
to 1 ft per day!  I've had several neighbors ask about the green vines 
climbing up my chimney - very impressive, and they will survive a northern 
winter.  


Other hop related items:
 - Hops can be like mint - invasive, taking over everything in sight.
 - I cut back lots of shoots this spring.  The N. Brewer shoots are pretty 
good sauteed like asperagus, but I don't like the Cascade. I left about 2 
shoots per wire; this will force the plant to grow upward (today 5' high).
 - A good hail storm will shred a hop plant pretty bad.
 - Grasshoppers like the leaves, but won't touch the cones.
 - A cheap food dehyrator is very useful to dry hops.  I stick my thermometer
into the middle, and when the temp starts rising I know most of the moisture 
has been driven off..
 - There are more cones higher up.  I get most of my hop cones above 15' on a
Southwest exposure (lots of sun). I can climb onto the roof to pick, realizing
this isn't an option for everyone.


>mmmm.. fresh Chinook cones!  


Not sure I'd plant Chinook.  Who knows the alpha acid for bittering?
Homegrown are best for arouma and flavoring.
