Subject: Plate Heat Exchanger


Gentlemen:


Some weeks ago I asked about ideas about a stainless steel plate heat
exchanger.  I was really looking for one that could be openned for easy
cleaning, but it looks like that for the quantities of fluids we normally
manage in homebrewing, no such unit exits(?).  The only lead I had came
from a reply to my request which indicated that someone had seen a unit
made by Alfa Laval.  Well, after about a month, I finally got their catalog
for small plate heat exchanger.  One major drawback, these units are brazed
and cannot be openned for cleaning.  Well, to make a long story short, they
have two versions, one brazed with a copper foil (model CB14) and the other
using nickel(model NB14). They are both made of stainless steel (AISI 316).
Which one would be the best for cooling wort?  How about cleaning and
sanitizing?


Also, they indicate that their main purpose is:"HVAC incl District Heating,
Heat Recovery, Ice Storage Systems, Solar Heating, Tap Water Heating".  Am
I going to have problems trying to cool wort?  


Thanks,
Lorenzo Barquin


PD.:  By the way, I regret to say that I have not received any reply on the
characteristics of water to brew a Wit Bier.  I appreciate your general
help.


Again, thanks.

A couple questions for the collective. I am a newbie with about 8 brews over
my belt!  : ^ (   !!!! What is bettter whole hop leaves or, pellets? My
experience has beeen mostly with pellets, but have recently read that whole
hops give a better aroma factor due to the breakdown of the lupin gland in
the pellets? Also, I have noticed what I consider a  yeasty bite to my
homebrews. The taste is hard to describe, maybe Banana like, or fruity. Is
this infection or normal? I have noticed that the taste seems to mellow with
age.( not disappear)? Help! Sorryt if  I ramble,  I was at a local Cafe?.,,,,
30 taps? I have enjoyed a few favorites... 1.) LEFFE 2.) FLYING FISH ---

collective using for a sanitizer? I have been using bleach, but want to use
the most effective. I ordered B-0Brite... any comments?.

Hello to all,
S. Murman says,

It's called simple impatience. Some people don't have room in the 
beer fridge to stick the secondary in for a week before bottling, or 
some do not have one at all. And when one is still brewing 5 gallon 
batches once a month it is hard to wait to try that latest brewing 
masterpiece. Or it is just a case of wanting to try all of the things that
one reads about in the many books and magazines that have chapters
and articles devoted to the subject. Yes you are right, these people 
have no limitations, but your post suggests that you do.

Subject: honey malt, PETs


  Hello to all,
Steve Johnson asks about Honey malt, I bought 10 lb of it this year and 
have used it in 3 brews so far and will again in a Barley Wine next week.
It seems to be a sweet crystal malt of sorts, although they claim that it
can be used at up to 50% of the grain bill. The highest I have used it at
was 10%. It is pretty sweet, and the color is 25 SRM. 


and Eamonn asks,
>Pretty soon I'll try "kegging" into a few 2L PET bottles for more 
>variety. Pale ale one week, porter the next. I know not to store in PETs 
>for months on end for oxidation reasons. But if I make 6 gal, and put ~ 
>3.5-4 gal in a 5 gal popkeg I can always bottle a few PETs for near term 
>use. Anyone tried this?


 Yes I did. I also make 6 gallon batches, and for a while put up a couple 
of 2 liter bottles, using carbonater caps. But I kept trying the beer to 
soon, (yes there is that impatience again Mr. Murman) and would be 
disappointed in the beer, only to be surprised when the keg had conditioned 
that it was great. (Well, at least pretty good) Now I sanitize three 22 oz 
glass
bottles, and fill them with the excess beer. Just enough to take to the next 
club 
meeting.


and finally Paul reports that,

>brewing may be contributing to yeast infections in women. One commercial

I thought that Candida Albicans (sp?) was responsible for women's yeast
infections. My wife is prone to them, and she will kill me if my beers are the
cause of them. (Of course, then she will have to buy all those tasty English,
Irish, and Belgian ales she loves.) If anyone can reply to his post, would you

Subject: GOTT spigot replacement plus a Mild Ale recipe




Hi,
In the last HBD I saw a query and answer about replacing the spigot in a 
GOTT with a rubber bung. I replaced mine with a bulkhead fitting that
HopTech sells made especially for this purpose. I took off the old spigot
and tossed it in a drawer (never know when you might need it!) and simply 
put in the bulkhead fitting, which has two halves that screw together, one
from the internal surface and one from the outside. I used the provided
short length of tubing (I trimmed it a tad shorter to suit me) and attached
it to the Phil's Phalse bottom.  This has worked really well.  
Good luck and good beer!
Sandy Cockerham

satisfied customer who LOVES the free shipping on orders of $40 or more.)

Subject: Posting Questions vs. Searching HBD Archives


Steve Johson replied to my call to search the archives before posting
questions:


"If, on the otherhand, I didn't care about what anyone else has to say about
brewing and getting it "live", I think just reading the archives would be
fine. It's nice to make contact with other brewers and hear what they have to
say
today, as well as in the past."


Yeah, Steve, you make a good point.  People join the HBD every day and to
them, everything is new.  One person's question is another's too.  But here's
a thought -- search the archives, summarize your research, and post the
results along with the question that brought on the search.  If everyone did
that, (1) new HBD'ers would get more information faster and (2) future
archive searches will be more fruitful and efficient, with single posts
summarizing older info.


Don't get me wrong -- I don't think asking questions is at all out of place
here (jeez, that's what it's *about*), and I'm glad to answer whenever I can,
but for certain topics especially, it seems we just discussed that "a month
ago" (usually longer but seems like yesterday).  Just a personal bug up my
butt I guess.

Subject: ageing ales


I have 2 questions regarding ageing ales.
(by ageing, I mean the time after the secondary when there is no yeast
activity)
        1. Should ales be aged at ale temp(65F) or at lager temp(32F)?
        2. What would be the optimum time ( in months) to age an ale?  I know
that the answer to this question is related to gravity. Is there a
simply rule of thumb to follow?


Note, I artifially carbonate so yeast for bottle conditioning is not an
issue.   Thanks,  Mike Rose  E-mail OK

Subject: inverted fermenting at home


    In regards to the post on making your own inverted carboy
    fermenting system:


    -     you still might want to look at one of the commercial valve
    unit thingies (I *am* a professional and I *do* use technical
    terms   :-) which clamp onto the neck of the carboy - clamping to
    the neck (ie: compression using the ridge of the neck) would work
    better than wiring your unit to the neck


    -     I have recently seen a 6 or so gallon inverted fermenting
    system made of plastic, which a removable top (ie: large access
    hole), small hole for standard air-lock, and a valve system for
    the bottom of the unit (stand too) - it would be more expensive
    than modifying an existing carboy - but it would give you the
    flexibility you are looking for and that the current inverted
    carboy methods lack

Subject: Big and Huge


The 11th Annual Big and Huge was (ironically?) the smallest in recent memory. 
Indeed, every competition I've judged this year (and I judge pretty regularly)
has been way down on entries.  Are people not brewing anymore, or are they
just burned out on competitions?  (I have to admit that it's been a long time
since I've entered a competition, so I suppose I'm guilty, too.)


Anyway, here are the results:


"Big" Beers (Ales and Lagers combined after first round judging): 1.050-1.060
      1st   Mike Lelivelt, Sun Prairie, WI      Rauch (BOS)
      2nd   Mike Lelivelt, Sun Prairie, WI      Dortmunder
      3rd   Bruce Garner, Madison, WI           Weizen


"Huge" Beers (Ales and Lagers combined after first round judging): over 1.060
      1st   Mike Ball, Cambridge, WI            Doppelbock
      2nd   Robb Harris, Madison, WI            Traditional Mead (FH)
      3rd   Mike Lelivelt, Sun Prairie, WI      Barleywine


Thanks to the entrants, judges, stewards, prize sponsors, and the Great Dane
for their participation in the event.  And special thanks to John Barbian, who
by taking on co-organiser/registrar duties, gave me the chance (finally) to
judge in a Big and Huge.

Subject: old bottles


I am very new to brewing so I have a lot to learn.  This weekend I was 
able to pick up at auction a case of old beer bottles for $1.00.  The 
state tax stamp was in the bottom of the box.  It was dated 8-13-42.  The 
bottles are very dirty but I found only one with a chip on the bottom.  
They are much heavier than new longnecks.  Would these be alright to 
bottle into, after a thorough cleaning, of course?  By the way, the state 
tax on a case in 1942 was $.09. 
Private e-mail or digest post is fine.  Thanks for any help.

Fellow Brewers,


I have been homebrewing for about four months now and am about to
endeavor upon a lemon wheat beer.  The recipe (from the Homebrewer's
Recipe Guide) calls for the *Zest* of 1 lemon.  I have seen other fruit
recipes in this book calling for the Zest of a fruit.  My question is,
what do they mean by the zest? Do I just use the juice of a lemon? Or,
do I use the juice and the pulp?  I hope someone can shed some light on
this for me.


Thanks,

On Friday Chas Peterson asks about alcohol content in NA beer.


If you know the OG, FG and therefore the alc. content of the original beer,
can't you measure the gravity of the heat-treated beer to see how much you
took out?  You'll have to maket the assumption (wrong, but maybe
immaterial) that nothing but ethanol was driven off.

Anybody use one of these - and how have you liked it?  They want $70 for
the carbonation part alone and $15 for each keg.  Is this reasonable or
does someone have a better deal?  I kind of like the idea of a mini keg,
but if these things are trama to deal with I don't want to be out of $85
either.  Private e-mail OK.  Thanks!


I by-passed that step and went to the 1/4 and 1/2 barrel kegs.
you can get setup with a Co2 tank, guages, hose and keg adapter for about
the same money. The keg, well...you can buy a reconditiond one or "rent" it
from your local liquor store (let the reader use discresion here). Natch ,
you will need a refridge to keep the keg in, I got one for nothing from a
work mate and have since aquired a cold plate with 6 passes in it! I can
have up to six kegs hooked up to this cold plate, that sits in the fridge
and the kegs sit outside....cold beer on demand...mmmmmmm.
Hope this helps.

More on (moron) vacuum distillation.


Eric Fouch suggested a Buchner flask for vacuum distillation. You have
stoppered mouth on the flask and a spout out the side. Why not just a hose
attached to a hole in the stopper of any glass vessel?


I say glass vessel so you can determine how much liquid is has been
evaporated. Otherwise, you would have to collect the distillate which will
bring Janet Reno and the BATF down on you.


I am sure that all the hop aroma will be gone and hop essence will need to
be added. A hop tea will cause the beer to be cloudy.


Questions:
Will hop flavor be lost as well?
How do you tell what percentage of the distillate is alcohol so that you
know you got it all?
Who is Lucy Lawless and why is she flashing Ducks?

  OFFICE MEMO          Priming Honey, IBUs, coffee            Date:5/12/97


   For my chocolate mocha stout, search previous HBD archive for recipe, I
added 1/4 cup of very coarse ground coffee to the wort just before cooling. 
In fact I had one of my last ones last night and it was very good IMHO.  As
that recent post mentioned, DON'T BOIL the coffee.  The coffee aroma was
wonderful during cooling but dissappated during fermentation.  I would suggest
using 1/4 - 1/2 cup of your favorite coffee (5 gallon batch) for some
additional coffee flavor.  I think a lot of stouts have a "coffee" like flavor
anyway because of all the roasted grains so don't worry too much about what
kind of coffee to add and experiment with the amounts.  
   Priming with honey--I made that mistake too!  1 cup of honey is about12 oz
by weight which is about twice what you should be using!   By weight, 1 oz of
priming sugar is approx. 1.3 oz of honey.  1oz of honey by volume is about 1.5
oz of honey by weight.   So 4 oz of priming sugar is about 5.2 oz of honey by
weight which is about 3.5 oz by volume (4 x 1.3 x 2/3 = 3.47)--ie. a lot less
than the 1 cup you used .  
   IBUs.  Personally I think consistency is more important than which formula
you use.  I usually take the HBUs--I find that term useful--in a recipe and
using the boil concentration (extract vs. full boil) I calculate the expected
IBUs using Rager's formula.  Then if I modify the boil concentration or batch
volume, I just adjust the HBUs in the boil to get the same bittering.  As long
as I use the same yardstick each time and use a consistent boil time I can
compare my recipes and get a feel for the amount of bittering I like.  Since
hops vary so much in AA ratings from year to year, I find recipes that give
the HBUs or AAUs of the bittering hops more useful than say 2 oz of hop "X"
with an unknown AA rating.
  Just my $0.02.

Just wanted to share a recipie that appears to be quite nice.  I am not
a major stout fan, (no flames please) but my roomate is, so i have been
tryign to come up with something we can both enjoy..  I think i have
found it.  the style was a sweet stout, and its pretty tasty at
bottling.  i can't wait for it to age, in face i'll bet i should make
more now, so i can let some age..... :)

Subject: Drain Sanitizing / Inverted Fermenters / Sparge Speed


Jeff McNally asks about sanitizing his kettle drain outlet:


Jeff, I use JSP's Easymasher in my converted keg cooker too, and use
the same drain setup you describe.  What I do is simply hit the outlet
valve with the flame from my barbeque lighter for a few seconds
immediately before attaching the hose.  A propane torch would work
better (hotter) but I haven't had any problems yet with my method.  I
would suspect that an alcohol wipe would work as well too.

Kim Lux asks about a homemade Brewcap with a drilled carboy:


The longer I work as an engineer, the more I realize that the key to being
a good one is knowing when not to reinvent the wheel.  


Kim, have you seen the Fermentap (TM)?  It's made out here in central
California and sounds a lot like what you describe.  It has a pretty
elaborate drain/valve setup, and I _think_ the dip tube runs all the way to
the (inverted) top of the carboy to vent the fermentation gasses out the
bottom (i.e. no airlock, no drilling).  The setup also comes with a
plastic-coated wire frame which supports the carboy safely.  I've only
seen a picture, but as I recall they're about 35 USD, you supply the
carboy.  If you can't find an add in a brewing mag, I can look up the
phone number.


Kim says he got the idea from a Unitank he saw on a micro tour a while
back.  In recent mags (BYO, BT, maybe the Z one) I've seen adds for a
plastic 5 gallon unitank for 30 USD.  It has a drain at the bottom, and a
cap fitted for an airlock at the top.  With valve and stand, the price goes
to about 60 USD.  Looks like a great system.


Kim also states that he has been ensured that concerns about
over-heating and cracking a carboy while washing it with hot tap water
was unfounded.  Perhaps so, unless you set the still-steaming carboy on
a cold concrete floor, or immediately rack cold beer into it (Voice of
experience here).
**********
Graham Stone wonders how to keep his sparge rate up as his hot water
tank loses head pressure.  Graham says that the initial flow rate is good,
but as it slows he has to throttle back on his run-off, causing particles
and a stuck sparge.


Think upstream!  I would suggest either raising the height of the hot
water tank (higher head) or increasing flow rate through a larger
diameter valve and hose.  You could use a clamp to restrict the inflow
_initially_ then open it up as the tank level drops.

Subject: Bleach residue, chest freezer temp.




     Any ideas on how to remove the white bleach residue from my glass 
     carboys and plastic buckets? I left bleach (1/2 cup in 5 gal) in these 
     containers for approx one week, now have this white and rather rough 
     surface.
     
     Also, I purchased a chest freezer last weekend and I am using a 
     Penn-Johnson Controls external thermostat set at 40 df. What setting 
     should I use on the original freezer thermostat? It's currently on 3 
     (on a scale of 9 = coldest), I would set it on the coldest setting 
     except that if the external thermostat fails and the freezer stays on 
     I would rather it not get down to the coldest freezer setting. Is this 
     a valid concern?
     
     Thanks - Randy in San Diego

Subject: First Time Priming Cornie Kegs


I've just recently bought a cornelius keg setup and have an all-grain
batch of pale ale dry-hopping in the secondary waiting to be kegged.  I
want to prime the keg to get natural carbonation rather than force
carbonate it.  I don't use corn sugar for priming any more - I like the
finer head that priming with a wort made from dry LME.  I normally use 1
1/4 cups of dry LME boiled in 1 qt of water when bottling. I'm guessing
that I should use somewhere around 3/4 of a cup of dry LME for kegging.


I'm not sure if I have a seal problem with my cornie keg.  When filled
with Iodopher solution and 40 Lbs pressure, it has very little pressure
on it when I check it the next morning- is this a result of carbonating
the iodopher solution? When I fill it with just CO2, it doesn't lose
pressure over night.  Stupid question maybe, but I just need some
feedback.  Also, what pressure should I put the keg under while allowing
it to condition (I'm guessing around 10 Lbs. of CO2 pressure)and what
pressure should it be stored at to retain the same level of carbonation
after tapping (assuming storing at room temperature 70 to 72 and 5
gallon cornelius keg- I'm chilling 2 liters at a time for drinking with
a carbonator to hold pressure).

Subject: Health impacts of drinking homebrew


G'day y'all,


In a recent discussion of why homebrew seems to produce more of a buzz
than commercial brew, one respondent said that homebrew contains more
"higher alcohols" which are "more toxic, therefore more intoxicating". I 
wonder
if there is cause for concern about ingesting these higher alcohols over long
periods of time.  Should this be a cause for concern?

Help!  Made a belgian ale on May 3rd.  7LBS belgian pils, 1LB biscuit, 1/2LB
malted wheat.  Mash 15 min 122F, 25 min 135F, 60 min 152F, 15 min 168F,
sparged with acidified water.  Boiled 75 minutes, chilled to 64F with
counterflow chiller.  Pitched with 1/2 gallon starter of Wyeast Belgian Wit.
Started very slow (12 hours).  Fermented O.K. for two days, then krausen
fell.  Racked to sencondary.  O.G. 1.048, gravity at racking 1.034.  Thought
that 64F may be too cool for this yeast.  Brought upstairs to 72F and added
"yeast energizer" in an attempt to help this.  Each time I go to the
fermenter, I shake it and get TONS of CO2 produced.  Been in secondary 6
days.  Current gravity 1.030.  What should I do.  I have heard of CO2
toxicity, does this exist?  Would aeration with O2 be too detrimental to try
to get this going?  HELP!

First off, $15 seems a bit high for one of these kegs. $8 to $10 is
probably at the higher end of what I'd accept. (Two years ago I could get
them for $7.


As to the "kegging": You probably can force carbonate using the CO2
capsules, but it will take a lot of them. This can be a bit expensive. If
you prime these kegs, use only about 2 tbsp of corn sugar per keg.
Overpriming will cause the kegs to buckle, making them useless.
DO NOT USE CHLORINE TO CLEAN THE MINI-KEGS! Chlorine will eat away at the
plastic coating inside (such as it is).
I used these for a little while, but they fell from my favor. Some proved
weaker than others as far as withstanding pressure, and after about 2 to 3
uses, the beer started tasting metallic. (Remember, they were initially
designed manufactured as one-use disposables.)
As an inexpensive draft system, or for those without the facilities for
acorny keg system, Mini Kegs can be a good substitute. But my overall
recomendation would be to go ahead and spring for a corny keg system if
feasable. The ROI is much better, and the O&M costs are lower.

Whoa! If you're using mini-kegs, you only need about 2 tbsp of sugar per
keg. If you have been routinely using this much sugar (1 cup), you're
lucky the kegs lasted this long.

When I use honey, I use about 1/2 to 3/4 of the amount of corn sugar that
I would normally use. I find that honey tends to ferment out  much easier
than corn sugar. (I have no science to back up that claim -- merely "gut
feel" and some sucessful/unsuccessful batch experience.)


For a 5 gallon batch, mixing mini's and bottles, I'd use 1/2 cup of honey.
Boil the honey in a cup or so of water for 15 - 20 minutes, cool, then
pitch.


As to the keg foaming: Obviously overpriming will cause some of that. Some
of it may be due to your tap. Some of the all-plastic versions shoot foam
all of the time. I'm not sure if the same problem occurs with the metal
tap, but I haven't heard too much negative said about it. Another possible
source of foaming could be if your CO2 pressure is set too high. Try
shutting it off, bleeding off the pressure, then just cracking it open
until the beer starts to flow.


TIP: If you're tired of using the CO2 cylinders, remove the cylinder
holder from your Mini-keg tap, and screw on a Carbonator (That device for
pressurizing 2L pop bottles.). The threads are a good fit (on most taps)
and you can regulate mini-keg pressure via your CO2 bottle regulator.
(Keep it low!)
