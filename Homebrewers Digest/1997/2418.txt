I find that for hoppy ales it's important to clear the beer with finings.
The hops profile changes over a month and by the time the beer has been in
the secondary for a month, its has lost the FRESH hop flavour- I like it
fresh and reasonable clear. Stouts, brown ales and lagers I do not always fine.

HBD-
Kit asks about using ordinary glass vessels for vacuum distillation per my
ASCII art attempt.  I would not recommend this, as a vessel not rated for
pressure could implode upon introduction of reduced pressure.  I've seen this
kind of thing happen in the lab when people incorrectly use things like
graduated cylinders for cold fingers or solvent traps.  After a few uses..
FOOMMP]]] and glass goes everywhere.
A vacuum gage and a pressure cooker should work.  After the alcohol is boiled
off, the pressure would start to drop again.  at this point the alcohol
content should be pretty low.  Then, to test the Reno-BATF theory, you could
put a smaller Buchner flask in line between the pressure cooker and the
aspirator, immersed in an ice bath, and collect the alcohol...you know, just
to measure its volume, and see if there's any hop aroma in it (hic).

 the phe that alpha laval has is relatively small, but the company
will supply a sheet that gives the thermal performance.


i doubt you will have any problems using it just insure you  are 
using as sanitary as possible fittings on cold wort out. i talked to the
rep at a beer show in boston about them, he said he had one at home for
such a purpose.  you will have to play with the flow rates some but it
is properly sized for 10 to 15 gallons in about 30 minutes (or less) 
ice cold water/glycol will help.  you may need two pumps tho.
if i were going to use the phe i would do two things.


some how valve the outlets (coolant and wort) and put a good thermo 
        on the wort outlet.  you can then control it better.


put a bag in tube type mesh filter on the wort inlet.  this will keep the
majority of the crap out of it. be especially carefull of whole hops, the 
leaves really get stuck in there.


for cleaning use very strong caustic. 2-3% should do it. you will want to get
 a good pump (high pressure - be carefull hard plumb it).  cleaning should
entail a reverse flush until the waste runs clear then atleast 10 minutes
of recirc both directions. if you can get the temp gauge to read 180F for 
this amount of time - nothing will live in it.  cool it down with a cold 
water flush. if your really worried take a aseptic sample of the rinse water 
and plate for beer/wort spoilers and wild yeast etc...


what i used to do with mine before use was use a clorinated tsp cleaner
sanitizer for 1 hr, rinse and 30 min with iodine.

Yes, the Carolina BrewMaster's recent 1997 U.S.Open competition was 
also smaller than years past.  It still was a good sized competition 
with 152 entries, but also noticeably smaller than the 200-250 entries 
of years past.


These are only guesses, but we attributed it to a few different 
factors.  First, the hobby has grown in popularity and thus so have 
competitions.  Thus the number of entries gets spread thinner.  
Secondly, timing with other local competitions.  Normally we receive 
a number of entries from one brewer, but this year the number of 
multiple entries was smaller.  Other local brewclubs had competitions 
about a month before ours so perhaps people who normally would have 
entered more beers only sent their winners. And finally, Steve 
Peeler, our clubs brewing machine who normally enters 25 to 30 
*different* beers did not enter a single beer this year because he 
was constructing a new RIMS and didn't have it up and running in time 
to brew anything for the competition.  Somehow I think this last 
reason probably doesn't effect most other competitions, though;)

Subject: vacuum distillation safety


I missed the start of this thread, but in HBD#2417, I noted a dangerous
suggestion in passing:


>Eric Fouch suggested a Buchner flask for vacuum distillation. You have
>stoppered mouth on the flask and a spout out the side. Why not just a hose
>attached to a hole in the stopper of any glass vessel?


Buchner flasks are optimized for vacuum filtration at room temperature, and
are NOT designed for heating.  The shape and wall thickness are all wrong,
and they tend to crack if heated on the bottom.  If bottom-heated under
vacuum, you are risking a dangerous implosion.  The thick walls and awkward
shape generate a lot of internal stress if you heat the bottom of the flask
while the walls are still cool.


If you must try this be sure to heat the flask uniformly over the entire
surface - immerse it in a hot water bath, or stick it in an oven.   A
better strategy would be to use a thinner walled spherical flask, with a
vacuum adapter.  We call the flasks "round bottoms".  These are much safer
to bottom heat.

Since IBU by definition is something that can only be determined by lab
analysis, there is no way to tell which formula for predicting IBUs is
"best" without a series of lab trials to compare to predicted IBU levels.
So far as I know, this has not been done, at least I haven't read about it.
Anything else ("I used his values and it was under-bittered") seems just too
subjective.  Comparing home brews with predicted levels to commercial beers
with known IBU levels might be better, but still, the only way to get it
accurately is in the lab.  Maybe one method is bettter in the range 20 - 30
iBUS, another from 30 - 40 IBUs and still another over 40, who knows?  I
just use my little Windoze program based on Dave's BASIC program and Glenn's
data, whether or not it accurately predicts IBUs is irrelevant, as has been
noted, it helps me achieve consistency and repeatability.  If I really
wanted to know if my "40 IBU beer" actually _has_ 40 IBUs, I guess I could
have it tested.

If I were you, I'd clean them up decently and then return them

The zest is where the good lemony flavour is.  Get a lemon grater or
(if you're not the frugal gourmet) grab a sharp fillet knife and shave
the skin of the lemon, getting only the yellow stuff off.  Try not to
get into the peel, that's not a desireable flavour.  Anyhow, the zest
is simply the yellow part of the lemon peel.

Hmm, shame on you, Dave, for not checking out the web site you reference.
Glenn Tinseth's utilization curve is not sigmoidal, but rises rapidly for
about 45 minutes, and then levels off to approach a maximum value of about
25-26%. The graph at http://realbeer.com/hops/research.html shows a
representative curve from the formula. I definitely agree with Dave that
Glenn's numbers seem to have the strongest empirical basis, and have
noticed that the bitterness in my beers has been much more predictable
after using them. Also note that Glenn's formula includes a constant which
can be adjusted to change the maximum utilization value, allowing us
brewers to customize the curve to fit to our own systems.

     My chest freezer (at it's highest setting) will still freeze beer. 
If my
     controller freaks on me, I'll have a nice mess.  (Knock on wood).
     The instructions say to set it as low as it will go, which is what
I did.
     I don't think it will really make much of a difference, unless

     My upright freezer has coils running through the shelves which
     makes it impossible for me to use for lagering.  (It freezes food
     pretty good.)  The thermostats would work with an upright.  I
     got the upright so that I could use our chest freezer for lagering.
     It holds four carboys perfectly.  Just don't stick your head in it
     during primary fermentation, the smell is quite unique (and

Many years ago I used a "cold water extraction" method for brewing
coffee extract.  It involved mixing one lb. of fresh ground coffee with
maybe two quarts of cold water, letting it sit overnight, and draining
through a reusable fiber filter.  The extract was stored in a carafe, and
used like instant -- actually I froze it in ice cube trays and used one cube
per cup of water in the microwave.  It made a wonderful strong,
aromatic coffee with very little bitterness.  I'd suggest the same principle,
i.e. make a strong cold extract and add it to the _secondary_ so that less
aroma is lost during the ferment.  You could also add it at bottling/kegging
time.

I'm not sure if I have a seal problem with my cornie keg.  When filled

the iodophor solution? When I fill it with just CO2, it doesn't lose

I used to get leaks when I first started too, usually from not getting a
good enough seal.  Using a high initial pressure (like 30 lbs) is a good

water -- softening the o-ring seems to help a lot.  I also lift up on the lid
and use the weight of the full keg to help make the seal before I ever flip
the bail into place.  If you have the CO2 hooked up while you do this, you
can tell if you have any leaks or not.  Once you're confident in the seal,
bleed off the gas and let the natural carbonization take place.

Also, what pressure should I put the keg under while allowing
it to condition (I'm guessing around 10 Lbs. of CO2 pressure)and what
pressure should it be stored at to retain the same level of carbonation
after tapping ?
<<<
Depends on the temperature and the desired carbonization level.  You
can find a temp vs pressure vs CO2 volume chart in the Stanford
archives and probably at the Brewery.  Actually if you are priming with
DME or sugar, you don't want to use _any_ external gas pressure while
conditioning -- it'll defeat your purpose.  For dispensing, start with the
lowest setting you need to get beer to flow, and adjust upward if you
find that you start to lose carbonation.  One I get a beer properly
carbonated, I usually dispense 2 or 3 glasses with no gas attached, and
only give it a 10 second "shot" when I notice that it takes significantly
longer to pour a glass.

I just kegged a 10 gallon batch of ESB this weekend.  I think I hit my mark
pretty well, but it was hot enough out here that I'm pretty sure it
fermented in the neighborhood of 80 degrees F.  (I used Wyeast 1968).  
It's a decent beer but it tastes a touch, well fusel.  Not solvent like or
super-objectionable, but with a harsh bitterness at the back of the
tongue.  I'm sure I'll be able to drink it, but I'd like to know what you all
think about the chances that what I'm assuming are fusel or higher
alcohols will mellow with age or cold-conditioning?

I usually drop hop my ales but am not sure how long to leave them on the hops.
I generally leave the beer in the primary fermenter 1-2 weeks and then rack to
carboys for settling and dry hopping.  I usually leave the beer on the hops
for a week but wondered if longer would be any better or if the maximum
benefit is reached after a week.  Is there a downside to leaving the beer
on the hops longer?

Subject: yeast infections


re the question of beer contributing to yeast infections.  the classic
vaginal, genital, breast, and epidermal (skin) yeast infections are caused
by candida albicans, a very specific strain of fungus unrelated to beer
yeast.  this is a fact.  unfortunately, what is also a fact is that the
consumption of bread, beer, wine, and other types of yeast has been
strongly correlated with an increase in the frequency and severity of
candida infections.  i have never read a good paper expaining why this is,
so i won't pass on possibly invalid information.  other dietary factors
that influence yeast infections are the amount of sugars consumed.  thus,
a heavy beer, with lots of unfermented dextrins, will also contribute to
yeast infections.  so, how does your wife continue to enjoy the fine
product of your love (beer that is, beer)?  like this:


dietary changes can also improve resistance to candida.  eating _lots_ of
live yogourt can make a huge difference.  the problem here is that the
labels of yogourts invariably say "active yogourt cultures".  this is not
the same as live yogourt.  the only brand available in canada with live
cultures is Astro (tm).  if you can't get this, take live lactoacilus
pills, available at any health food store.  another good thing to eat
(drink) is fresh, pure cranberry juice.  again, this is not the same as
cranberry juice from concentrate that you can buy at the grocery store.
most health food stores, and some grocery stores, will carry frozen pure
cranberry juice, or you can make your own with freshly frozen crnaberries
(the freeze/thaw cycle makes it easier to pulp).  one caveate is that you
should not drink cranberry juice if you are prone to kidney stones, unless
your doctor says it's ok--some stones are made of different substances,
and i don't want to be held libel for telling which these are.  finally,
always wear a condom during sex (use a dam for any oral stuff).  candida
is often transmitted asymptomatically from the partner of a woman who is
prone to the symptomatic infections.  my partner is quite prone to yeast
infections, and these changes have made a huge difference.

The zest is the colored part of the peel, the very thin outside layer (I can

Regarding Lemon Zest:
the zest of the lemon is the grated rind.  Use a "zester" if you have one,
which takes off little strips of rind.  Or just use a grater, with a fine
grate.  Don't grate too deep, or you get into the pulpy lecithin layer.  If
you can get un-waxed fruit, all the better-I'm not sure what it takes to get
the wax off.  Note that the zest contains primarily lemon oil, so you get a
concentrated lemon flavor, but not any sugar or sweetness as from juice.

In hbd#2416, Ronald LaBorde responds to Kim regarding construction of a

<snip>
Every time you drain from the bottom, air will be sucked into the top
through the airlock.
You may get oxygen into your wort here. You could run come CO2 over the
airlock, or better yet, have a smaller input tube inserted in the same
stopper as the airlock and run some CO2 slowly into the headspace (very low
pressure and rate!!) it will bubble out the airlock, and as you drain from
the bottom air will not enter. After draining, remove gas and cap the input
tube.


Charley (me): Why not fill a balloon with C02, slip it over the top of the
airlock's air intake tube just before opening the bottom valve? Just make
sure to get enough C02 into the balloon to balance the volume of trub and/or
yeast that will be poured out the bottom.

Did you use hot water? 4 oz. of bleach in 5 gal of water should not do that

That was my "field" in which the test was done and Steve Hamburg and I were
the experimenters.


The purpose of the experiment was to see what the *difference* between
systems was and so it was not important really how many gallons of runnings
were taken as long as it was somewhere in the range of what homebrewers
usually take.  As it happens, we took 7 gallons of runnings.  7 gallons
at 1.050 is *almost* the same as 5 gallons at 1.070... the only difference
would be spillage and loss to hops and trub, which we would hope to be
less than a few percent.  Frankly, the accuracy of any homebrewer's efficiency
measurements are probably limited to 5% mostly because of volume measurement
and hydrometer inaccuracies.

What your instructions would never fail to do is make foamy beer.
I don't even have to look at my CO2 solubility tables to know that
25-30 psi at 33F will give you well over 4 volumes of carbonation!
This is double what you want for most styles.  If you are getting
normal carbonation this way, either:

bad advice.  I force-carbonate ales at 68F at 30psi and then cool them

Since CO2 is much more soluble at cooler temperatures, your instructions

I'm afraid that beginner's book is wrong.  The source of the carbonation
is *absolutely* immaterial when it comes to the size of the bubbles.
This is a common misconception and it's a shame that this kind of information
has been published in books and magazines.


Also, another poster has said that B-vitamins increase alcohol metabolism.


This too is incorrect.  The tie-in between B-vitamins and alcohol is that
alcohol consumption leads to *losses* in B-vitamins.  Whether this is due
to the diuretic effect of alcohol or some other process I will not speculate.
Yeast is a great source of several of the B-vitamins and therefore drinking
beer with yeast in it helps replace some of the B-vitamins you lose due
to the alcohol.  I've read, however, that in general, the net result is
only a small increase in B-vitamins in the body (i.e. you lose most of
what you gain).
 
***
Randy and Brian speculate that it's higher alcohols that make
homebrew more "potent."  That was my thought too.  I don't know
for a fact if higher alcohols are indeed more intoxicating than
ethanol, but I do know for a fact that higher alcohols have more
of that "alcohol aroma" than ethanol.  In other words, a 6% ABV
beer with lots of higher alcohols will smell of alcohol, whereas
a beer that is 6% ABV, but all ethanol will not.

I believe that Scott meant "using dextrin malt in an extract batch."
There's no reason that you should get cloudy beer from dextrin malt
if you are mashing it, even at a single temperature.  The haze from
dextrin malt is from starch and only if you are extract brewing would
you not convert it to soluble sugars.

I believe that it may.  Remember that aging the beer on the yeast will
result in esterification (yeast will take acids and alcohols and make
esters out of them).  I find that fresh Bigfoot Barleywine is extremely
harsh and burns the throat, whereas after aging several months smooths
out into a nectar.  I have also found that these young, rough Barleywines
are more likely to give me a hangover (even from just one) than after
some aging.

Actually, this reminded me of something from my NA beer experiements...


I found that esters were completely driven-off during the de-EtOH-ization.
A very fruity Brown Ale tasted more like a Munich Dunkel (although there
were other odd "cooked" flavours which didn't quite fit) after processing.
As for the person who reported lots of DMS, did you make sure to vent
the pot?  High DMS sounds like the condensate was allowed to fall back
into the kettle (which, incidentally, would mean that most of the
alcohol fell back in too!).

This is inexcusable.  Associating astringency with roasted malts is
a crime.  Roasted malts don't lend *astringency*!  To taste astringency
you should chew on a grape skin or red apple peel.  Please don't confuse

Before I begin to chill, I put a 6" (30 cm) length of silicone hose
on the end of the valve outlet and run some boiling wort through it
(gently) into a Pyrex container.  This should sanitize the interior
of the valve.  I leave the short hose on till I'm done chilling and
then pull it off just before attaching the sanitized 4-foot (1.2 m)
silicone hose (just in case some bugs decided to visit).

sparge water.  My reply to him bounced, so here it is:


Tim--
The only real problems with acidifying too much would be:


1. poor break (both hot and cold),


2. sourness.

Subject: Beer mix gas screwup


I'm in minor trouble, and I need help. I have a cornelius kegging system,
and after hearing of the joys of beer mix gas (in this case 75% N, 25% CO2),
I refilled my cylinder with the stuff. I needed gas anyway, because I had a
leaky hose and an empty canister. I spent the evening putting hose clamps on
all my fittings, then hooked everything back up and turned on the gas. 


It appears my regulator doesn't know from nitrogen. The screw had been set
at about 7# of CO2 pressure, but the beer mix kept flowing, and flowing, and
was still going strong at 15#. I started backing off the pressure regulation
screw, and didn't have any effect until I heard gas flowing from the side of
the regulator. I came to the conclusion that the screw was too far out, so
screwed it back in until I didn't hear gas any more, I cut off the gas at
the bottle, and vented a bit from one of the kegs. 


So, what's the problem, and more important, what's the solution (cheap, I
hope)? My interim workaround is to wait until there's not enough pressure to
push beer out, then give the kegs another quick blast, and repeat. Do I
(gulp) need a new regulator?
