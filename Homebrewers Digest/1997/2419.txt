I have seen a plate heat exchanger used in a local brew pub.  The
application is a good one, however for the home brewer, they are "quite"
pricey.  I have installed large plate heat exchangers for HVAC applications.
They work quite well and are very efficient at heat transfer.


I saw an ad in a brewing mag some time back and they were listed at
$1300+/-.  I think this is somewhat overpriced, but I'm not sure where you
would have to go to get one cheaper if you weren't a contractor.  As far as
cleaning, I think you would have to use a CIP system.

Subject: botulinum toxin


Please excuse the relatively beer-unrelated content:


A question was asked here a while back about whether botulinum infection
of wort would harm yeast.  I work with botulinum toxins and I know that
their mechanism of action is that they cleave proteins involved in
neurotransmitter release.  I also know that yeast have homologues of
these proteins.  I didn't know if the homologues could be cleaved
however.  I just finished up a little presentation I will be making
to my lab on Friday and found out the answer--botulinum toxins don't
affect yeast.  If any of you feel in an especially geeky mood you
can check it out my "review", I put it on the web at:

Also, another poster has said that B-vitamins increase alcohol

This too is incorrect.  The tie-in between B-vitamins and alcohol is
that alcohol consumption leads to *losses* in B-vitamins.  Whether
this is due to the diuretic effect of alcohol or some other process I
will not speculate. Yeast is a great source of several of the
B-vitamins and therefore drinking beer with yeast in it helps replace
some of the B-vitamins you lose due to the alcohol.  I've read,
however, that in general, the net result is only a small increase in
B-vitamins in the body (i.e. you lose most of what you gain).
<<
As I understand it your body uses the Vitamin B to help break up the 
alcohols.  When your body has no Vit-B left it is more difficult for 
it to break up alcohols, thus it can probably take longer. If you 
keep on refilling your Vit-B by drinking homebrew you might 
metabolise the alcohol faster than if you drink alcoholic beverages 
with much less or no Vit-B. 
I doubt if Vit-B in itself increase alcohol metabolism but a shortage 
of Vit-B may DECREASE alcohol metabolism.
I am no medical doctor, I am just explaining it as I understand it. 
Maybe I am wrong, maybe not.

Subject: Partial mash, first time jitters


Dearest collective,
        I am basically a novice, having made about 15 batches of extract + 
steeped grain. Recently, I purchased an ingredient kit from HopTech for a 
Nut Brown ale. I thoroughly enjoyed the results. (After it took them 
several weeks to actually send me everything they said they would :-( ). 
The recipe called for a partial mash for the Munich malt, the 
instructions for which I will summarize:
- -->        Bring 1.25 qts/lb to 170 deg F in a thick saucepan. Remove from heat, 
add grains, and thoroughly stir. Cover and let sit for 30 minutes. Scoop 
the "mashed" grains into a steeping bag, along with the other specialty 
grains (Special B, crystal & chocolate malts). Put the grain bag into the 
brew kettle (along with any wort from saucepan) and bring to 180 deg F. 
Remove grain bag after dipping a few times to rinse the grains.        <--
        As I said above, I was able to follow these directions without any 
difficulty, and made a very tasty beer (too much of which I gave away). 
Now, I am going to make it again, this time with ingredients from my 
local homebrew shop. Here are the questions:
        
1) Is the procedure above a reasonable method for the beginner? (No, I am 
not going to purchase new equipment at this time--we are saving for our 
new 750 sq. ft. deck and will not have cash for a three-tier RIMS!)


2) Would it make sense to include the "specialty" grains in the partial 
mash?


Private email would probably make more sense for a response...


BTW, the suggestion in an earlier digest of using a s.s. trashcan with 
the bottom cut out, used to retain the heat from the cajun cooker, worked 
great! It took less time to bring ten gallons to a boil than it 
previously had for five! (Also, less interference from the wind--more 
consistent boil.)

Subject: Carboy residue/deposits


For Randy Ricchi and Randy Barnes in HBD 2418:


The glass in the carboy is likely not etched, it just has some white 
 mineral deposits on it - don't ask me why or how - I'm no chemist - 
 but I know how to clear it up.


Use some regular white vinegar and some water in the carboy and the 
 residue / deposits  will go away.  You don't need to fill the carboy, 
 just enough to swirl around - you can see where it cleans.  Then a 
 blast of water to rinse and you can sanitize again (for a shorter 
 period of time!)  LimeAway was also cited as a fix, but I haven't used 
 that myself.


The answer to the white residue/deposits in a carboy was the first 
 useful HBD tip I got when I started reading it and searching the 
 archives a couple of years ago.  I'm glad to be able to pass along the 
 info, but a couple of keyword searches of the archives would yield the 
 same info . . .


Last brew of the season coming up on Saturday - hope my 100 gallon 
 stockpile is enough to make it through the summer!  (Not to restart 
 the brewing season thread - I just lack the time during the summer to 
 brew - too much else going on, and the thought of hovering over 6 
 gallons of boiling wort on a hot summer afternoon pales in comparison 
 to the thought of sitting in the shade next to a keg of cold homebrew!!)

This is in reference to Kim Lux's plan  to invert a glass carboy after
drilling a hole in the bottom of it.  I'm no expert, but I love to tinker
with things.  One thing that I've realized is the importance of
prototypes (cutting a few corners along the way to save time and $ to
make sure the concept as a whole works sufficiently before taking the
final plunge.).  This may seem too easy, but why not use a plastic carboy
(water bottle) for your prototype?  You might find it's advantages
surprising.
   1)  Plastic is much easier to cut or drill.
   2)  The cost should be cheaper than glass, in case you run into
problems.  You                 may also be more apt to fiddle with more
'bells & whistles' in or on the                   carboy itself for ease
of operation.
   3)  Plastic is lighter, which will make your fine tuning easier and
less dangerous.
   4)  If the plastic slips and falls, cean-up is safer and easier. You
might even be
              able to save your batch.
   5)  The plastic carboy should also be able to take the heat of hot
water.


I hope this helps in your venture.  Best of luck.  I've also considered
making one of those gizmos after seeing it in a HB supply store.  A toast
to building building a better mouse (beer) trap!

Dear Friends,


Pat Anderson noted rightly that only analyses of actual beers to 
compare with the predicted IBU levels can verify or refute any 
particular scheme; I could not agree more.  I will point out that 
when I say "it was under-bittered" I did in fact sit down and try 
carefully to compare with commercial examples of known IBUs to reduce 
the subjectivity as best I could.  Not perfect, of course, but it was 
all I could do at the time.


Phil Hofstrand takes me to task for not examining Glenn's curve more
carefully before posting.  Guilty as charged; I was running on
memory, always a bad idea in my case, and in this case it was memory
of email I traded with Glenn a couple of years ago while the
research was still underway.  I retract my use of the term
"S-shaped" but stand by my claim that the non-linearity of the data
suggests a closer approach to The Truth than any linear model of
alpha acid utilization would.

Rae Christopher J wrote about beer and yeast infections.  Although my response

my $0.02 for clarification.


Rae is correct that yogurt can help prevent yeast infections, and that only
live cultures (not active cultures) will perform such a task.  In the US, such
yogurts will normally say "live and active cultures."  Even if they don't, you
can find several yogurts which contain acidophilus, a live yogurt culture. 
Dannon, Columbo, Breyers, all of the major retailers, sell yogurt which
contains acidophilus.

Over the years I have done an awful lot of hop experimentation and these two
posts bring up a very interesting bunch of thoughts from me.


I have been toying with using Hop Pellets as the bittering hops (anything
that is in the boil more than 50 minutes). Then using either plugs or whole
leaf Hops for the flavor and aroma hops.


I have found that in my experience the Hop Pellets tend to give me the
better boiling hop bitter than plugs or whole leaf and that the plugs and
whole leaf work far much better for flavor and aroma.


So come Al.... Tell me if I am on track or just plain nuts (well I know I am
already actually).


Has anybody else found this to be true?

In some cases this is actually true. Sometimes I will keg early in the

as long as about 12 hours have passed.

None of the above.

Thanks for the "no slam". However, I don't agree that its bad advice. It
works. Try it, then tell us if the beer comes out all foam. Mine doesn't or
obviously I wouldn't give the procedure.

How many kegs are you keeping pressurized simultaneously? I find that if I
have one keg in the frige (very seldom but it happens) vs 4 kegs (all on a
single manifold) I have to set the regulator up higher to maintain the same
serving pressure.

I use the cooler temperatures (33F) in order to hurry the process along and
get drinkable beer within 24-48 hours of beginning the process. I then
depressurize the keg and raise the temp up to 44F (warmest setting on my
thermostat).


I've had only one complaint of over carbonation since starting this process
last summer. Nobody else complained about the beer and it disappeared
rapidly down the gullets of many others.


Theory is one thing, practice is real and this process does work in my basement.


Hope you enjoyed your vacation Al.

Subject: Hop Growing Summary


Howdy All,


I have used the suggestion of others on the HBD to do some past issue
searches, then report the results to the masses.


Here goes on the subject of Hop Vine Growth and Maintenance:


Planting:
 - Plant the vines under a lattice of some sort that extends quite high (on
the order of 15-25 feet) such that the vines may grow straight upward.
Some people suggested using a double pole arrangement with a horizontal
wire across the top, and several pieces of wire or twine hanging down. to
facilitate vertical growth.  Others suggested a single pole with several
wires extending from the top to the ground in a star-shaped pattern (ala a
Maypole).
 - Plant the vines after the threat of frost is passed.
 - Plant the vines where they will receive lots of sunlight (southern
exposure in the northern hemisphere, northern exposure in the southern
hemisphere)


Soil Prep
 - If you have too much clay, add some sand to the soil(HBD 1373) to aid
drainage
 - till the soil to a depth of 6-8 inches
 - dress the soil with bone meal, favored over horse or cow manure for its
slow-release character(HBD 1768)
 - place rhizome above the dressed soil (see above) and cover it with peat
moss, and layer some fine tree bark over the whole mess to make a mound
(HBD 1373)




Hop Vine Maintenance
 - get rid of mites by using insect aversion (rub leaves to squish the
buggers and leave the corpses behind to scare away their buddies)
 - spray murphy's oil soap on the tops and undersides of the leaves
 - Both of these BEFORE flowering (HBD 1385)
 - Rooting hormones act on the growing ends of the roots, and should be kept
carefully away from the shoot end(HBD 1386)
 - Resist bunnies by fencing the vines
 - Dogs seem to bother SPENT hops due to a hypothesis that SPENT hops have
barley sugar all over them(HBD 2217)
 - Keep vines contained in their patch by sinking a four inch piece of metal
flashing into the ground, around the vine patch.


Harvest
 - harvest the vines non-destructively (don't cut off the tops of the plants
until after the cones have been harvested)  or harvest the cones off the
living plant.


Post-Growth Care
 - Remove all traces of the dead plant matter after the growing season is
over.  This reduces the chance of persisting insect infestation.


I hope this quick summary helps others.  Any comments, additions, deletions
should be directed to me by email.

Subject: Coffee Stout


I brewed a coffee stout from a recipe that a friend gave me last year.  I
had tried a bottle of his creation and it was extraordinary and I wanted
to reproduce it on my own.  After 2 months in the bottle, it tasted like
someone had poured old coffee into my stout!  It was horrible.  I quickly
called my buddy who said anything with coffee must be aged at least 6
months to mellow the acids in the coffee.  Tried one last week on the 6
month bottling anniversary and he was right.  It was great.  Smooth,
hoppy, and a bit of coffee flavor showing through in the after taste.  The
advice here is BE PATIENT IF YOU ARE BREWING WITH COFFEE....it pays!!
If anyone would like the recipe (it's and extract recipe) feel free to
conctact me via private e-mail.
Cheers!!

Subject: Yeast culturing


For the last few months, I have delved deep into the subject of yeast
culturing for one and only one purpose:  The culturing of yeast from St.
James Gate (Guinness).  I was successful, once an Irish friend smuggled a
bottle of Guinness from the emerald isle (Only the domestic (Ireland)
Guinness is bottle conditioned.)  Step by step I learned some things which
may help the rest out there:


1)  It's easy with the right equipment
There are so many ways to culture from bottle conditioned beer I wont try
to summarize them here.  Suffice to say each method works well, depending
on your need for cool looking glassware.  I went to a local university (Go
Cougars!) and acquired petri dishes and an inoculation loop.  This worked
well with my need for cool glassware and the equipment was easy to use.  


2)  Technique is everything
I was streaking my dishes poorly.  Part of the problem was the bulky glove
box I made to keep contaminants out.  A microbiologist friend of mine
(thanks Matt!) taught me proper technique and now my glove box is
unnecessary.  Just flame your loop often and streak quickly.  My advice: 
find someone with good culturing technique and bribe them to teach you.


3)  Clean? Yes.  "Outbreak" suits? No.
A clean work environment is helpful.  However, the complex techniques some
HBDers come up with do more harm than good, scaring people away from this
easy offshoot of brewing.  My advice is: start simple.  If you get
contamination, step up to the next level of environment (Clean Kitchen,
UltraClean Kitchen, Ultra Clean Living room, paper-septum or similar
technique, Glove-Box, etc.)


Conclusion:
If I can do this, anyone can.  My hand shakes pretty bad, and my girlfriend
will attest I'm not a neat person.  I'll let you know if I get the Guinness
taste right.


Sorry for the length:  Brew ON!

 Be careful!  Many uprights make the chiller coils integral with the

An exhaustive test has not been done (to the best of my knowledge) but
I do have three datapoints which I described in detail in my review of
"Using Hops" which was published in Zymurgy back in 1995.  To make a
long story short, I didn't test Garetz's formulas directly, but I did
test Rager's formulas by brewing two batches using the formulas (although
I added 10% to compensate for the hop bags I was using) and then sent
the beers to Siebel Institute for IBU testing.  In one batch (10 gallons),
Rager's formulas said 40 IBUs, Siebel tested 41.5 IBUs.  I don't recall
the second batches' numbers but the measured IBUs were within 5% of
those predicted with Rager's formulas (plus 10% for the hop bags).


When I compared the hop weights given in Rager's formulas (4.4 oz. for 60 min
and 2.4 oz. for 15 min) with what Garetz's formulas *would have* suggested
(8.87 oz. for 60 min, 3.0 oz. for 10 min), it's clear that the Garetz
formulas would have made a beer that was nowhere near 40 IBUs (probably well
over 60 IBUs!).  I did a few other, informal, comparisons and the Garetz hop
additions were roughly DOUBLE what was predicted by Rager's formulas and the
beers were clearly reasonably within the expected bitterness range.


Mind you: these are just datapoints for *MY* system and others may get
different results, but I can't see how anyone would get *half* of the
utilisation I get in my system (at that time, it was a 10-gallon Polar
SS kettle on a 12,000 btu kitchen stove, glass fermenters w/blowoff tubes).


Agreed, a series of tests are needed, testing many variables.  I (well,
Sheaf & Vine Brewing Supply did, but back then I was the owner) co-sponsored
such a project more than two years ago, but it seems to have gotten stalled.


Bottom line, for *my* system, Garetz's formulas recommend *twice* the 
correct amount of hops.

     Eric,
     
     I bought an upright - in fact, I bought two of them for $50.00 from a 
     church that was upgrading to a large commercial freezer.  The drawback to 
     an upright is that the shelves contain the cooling coils and are therefore 
     not adjustable nor removable.  That means that, while bottled beer and kegs
     
     (lying down) will fit, most fermentors will not.  I am getting around that 
     issue by building a cold box like Byron Burch outlined in an older Zymurgy 
     article.  It is basically an insulated, 2 x 4 and plywood box that attaches
     
     to the front of the freezer unit (the door is removed from the freezer and 
     attached to the wooden box) that greatly expands the capacity.  Inside the 
     cold box section I can fit multiple fermentors and kegs.  It also makes 
     adding taps a breeze by drilling through the wooden section instead of the 
     freezer itself.  While most people recommend chest freezers or 
     refrigerators, I like the upright freezer idea because you don't have to 
     lift heavy fermentors/kegs in and out over the lip (chest freezer) and, 
     with the cold box, you have more room than a refrigerator.  I can look up 
     the back issue of Zymurgy for the cold box article tonight.  The bonus is 
     that all the shelves can still be used to house large quantities of bottled
     
     beer in addition to the kegs and/or fermentors in the cold box section.  
     And, yes, the controllers work just as well for freezers (chest or upright)
     
     as they do for refrigerators.  I have the Johnson Controls unit and it 
     works very well.  Hope this helps.

Subject: Lager Yeast


My apologies if this topic has already been discussed, but I haven't had
the time to browse the archives.


My questions are on the use of liquid lager yeast (specifically, Wyeast
Bavarian):


1.  After popping the pouch, should the yeast be refrigerated within the
lager temp range until it swells, or should it be left at room temp?


2.  Is a 22 oz. bottle of starter enough for a 5 gallon batch?  Should
the starter also be refrigerated within the confines of the cool lager
temps?  


3.  Should the wort be cooled to the lager temp, and then the yeast
pitched, or should I pitch the yeast at < 78 degrees as in ales and then
refrigerate the wort?


As you can tell, I'm new to making a lager, so any help will be
appreciated.  Thanks in advance....Mark R.

Subject: Bleach residue, freezer controller, Wyeast Munich




     Thanks to all who replied regarding my recent query regarding bleach 
     residue and the temperature setting for my freezer controller. In 
     addition to responses posted here, I got private replies which 
     suggested that I remove the bleach residue with a dilute acid 
     solution. I purchased swimming pool acid (38% sulfuric acid), used 
     approx. 2 oz/gal, and this took the residue off within 15 minutes. 
     ALWAYS be sure to wear eye protection and gloves, pour the acid into 
     the water and not the water into the acid, and rinse thoroughly with 
     clean water after the acid treatment. I'm concerned that the glass may 
     be permanently etched by the bleach, I'll let you know how my next 
     batch turns out. Another suggested that I use vinegar to remove the 
     residue, this would also be a good idea.
     
     (I was actually looking for hydrochloric acid but the store didn't 
     have any. Did I screw up by using sulfuric acid?)
     
     Regarding the freezer setting when using an external controller, one 
     suggested setting the freezer at maximum cold, another suggested 
     setting it at the warmest setting. I'll probably set it at the coldest 
     setting since even the warmest setting will freeze everything anyway.
     
     With my new freezer, I'm going to make a Vienna-style lager this 
     weekend. I bought Wyeast Munich 2308, was this a good choice? Any 
     advice on fermenting with this yeast? 
     
     Thanks again to all - Randy in San Diego
