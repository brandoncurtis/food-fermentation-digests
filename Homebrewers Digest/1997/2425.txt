I have been doing exactly that on a fairly regular basis. I don't think
it is necessary to wash the yeast - that is more important if you plan
on storing it rather than reusing it at once. 


Aerate the second batch as well as you can. It absolutely assures a
great starter. Usually I brew a similar style for the second batch. This
is also a goodmeans for preparing the yeast to brew a high gravity beer
such as anImperial Stout or Barleywine. I have never done it for more
than two batches in a row, but I'm sure that this could be extended
safely for a larger number of batches - as long as you are careful with
sanitation. 


Eric Tepe asks about the yeast in the Rogue Shakespeare Stout being the
brewing yeast or a conditioning yeast. Sorry, I don't have an answer to
that but it brings to mind a couple of related yeast questions. First,
is there a commercial equivalent of Rogue's PacMan yeast? And second,
what commercial yeasts are good choices for conditioning yeasts? And
lastly, what general conditions or beer styles call for conditioning
yeasts?

In private email Glenn informed me that his curves are based on

I didn't figure).  (I hope that isn't a nettequitte violation!)


One point that came up was that he makes sure to stir in his hops.

Subject: Stuck Fermentation


Well, I have run into my first stuck fermentation.  I brewed a Smoked 
Porter with the Wyeast Swedish Porter Ale yeast (#?).  OG was 1.060.  
After a week and a half ferment at 60F the bubbling was down to about 
every two minutes so I racked to secondary.  I realize now that gas 
evolution is not a sure sign of the completion of fermentation, but it 
has worked fine for my previous 20 or so batches.  Anyway, I dropped the 
secondary temperature down to 46 for a week ( the beer actually got down 
to about 37F on the cooldown before I adjusted the refrigerator).  I was 
all prepared to bottle tonight when I took a specific gravity reading.  
1.030 is still way too high.  I expect it to finish in the 1.015 range.


After about one gallon was transferred to the bottling bucket I caught 
the gravity problem.  I promptly transferred back to the secondary.  A 
yeast sediment had formed on the bottom of the carboy.  I shook up the 
carboy as best I could and plan to finish the fermentation upstairs at 
around 68-70F.


Is this adequate to reinitiate fermentation?  Will I have to repitch 
yeast?  I guess I will have to wait a day or so to see if fermentation 
resumes.  Has anyone else had problems with this yeast?  Did I ferment it 
too cold.

As I read Dave's post I had some thoughts.  I agree that it doesn't
make sense that a partially filled bottle will create more CO2, but
that's the effect I saw, and that's what prompted me to post in the
first place; I couldn't square the result with the theory.  I have a
feeling what we're seeing is not a difference in CO2 saturation, but
rather a difference in pressure in the bottle.  The higher pressure
must equilibriate instantly with the atmospheric pressure.  As I
mentioned in my original post, this can in some cases even lead to
weak shock waves in the bottle neck.  This pressure equalization could
be causing the severe CO2 expulsion we're seeing.  Think of it as
similar to pouring a beer quietly and simply dumping a beer into a
glass.  Which beer would you observe to have more CO2?  The violently
poured beer would create more foam even though we know both beers are
primed at the same rate, and both would have the same amount of CO2 in
solution.

This is not really the case.  Yeast *much* prefer the fermentative
pathway, so if there is any sugar available they will ferment whether
or not there is oxygen present or not.  Since the primed bottle
contains sugar the yeast will not undergo any respiration.  The idea
that adding oxygen at pitching aids the yeast in their respiration
phase is an oft-repeated fallacy.  There was an article on this by
Tracy Aquila in one of the recent brewing rags.




I'm beginning to wish I hadn't been so quick to relieve the pressure
on my batch of bottle bombs so that I could do some experiments.

Subject: Headspace & carbonation


Dear Friends,


In all these posts discussing the apparent observation of
overcarbonation in underfilled bottles, I cannot help but wonder:
are people *sure* that it is the *beer* that has a perceived excess
of CO2 in it, or are they mistaking the much greater "hiss" when the
cap is pried off a low-fill bottle for carbonation?  Do these
underfilled bottles show greater "fizz" of exsolving CO2 from the
beer?  In my experience, which I will admit right out was not gained
through any systematic exploration of this question, the answer is
No.  Beers appear to me to have very similar CO2 contents, but the
hiss is much louder when the bottle is, say, half filled compared to
the normal level (like many, I package every drop I can get out of
the batch, regardless of how low the fill is in my last bottle). 
Perhaps there is something more complicated going on, but Occam's
Razor compels me to ask this anyway.


In other news, I have received exactly one response to my earlier 
call for data on fill levels in kegs, and one suggested explanation 
without any data, so nothing to report on that yet.


Cheers,

     I have a Carbonator Cap and it has always worked flawlessly.  I have
     used it to carbonate thousands (well O.K., maybe hundreds) of bottles 
     of beer, water, Kool Aid, flat soda, home made soda, etc. and it has
     never failed me yet.  It sounds like you may have a couple of 
     defective units (I seem to recall hearing some rumblings of a
     defective run of these things a while back).  I'd recommend returning
     them to the store you purchased them from for replacement (they should 
     be glad to replace them) or directly to Liquid Bread if the store
     won't do it.

Chas,
I'm posting this instead of emailing it, since others may have this same 
problem.  I encountered this exact same problem last summer.  After fuming 
about it for a while, and trying to figger out how to fix it, I just decided 
to contact the supplier who sold it to me and return it.  He put me in touch 
with Liquid Bread, the manufacturer.  Apparently, they had some quality 
control problem with a particular batch of these.  It is defective, and I 
don't believe that it's fixable.  They gave me a return address to send it 
back.  They replaced it free of charge, and also threw in a second one for 
my trouble.  I consider that to be a good response to the problem.

     This is ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE!  Yes, water is basically incompressable.
     However, compressability only deals with the change in volume versus
     the change in pressure.  By pressing on the syringe's plunger, you
     are changeing the pressure of the water in the syringe, but not the
     volume -- hence the incompressablity of water.  
     
     Ask anyone who has ever been diving about water pressure.  Your ears
     start to feel the pressure in as little as a couple of feet.  Divers
     get the bends from the solubility of nitrogen at increased pressures.
     Yeast under pressure will surely feel something -- and I guarantee
     that it won't be atmospheric pressure.

Lou Heavner asks about the "bock" from that lil' ol' brewery in Shiner.


St Patrick's of Texas (512-832-9045, no affiliation, blah blah blah) sells a
partial-mash kit for "Texas Bock" which is described this way in their
catalog:


1.5 lb crushed munich 10L
1 lb maize
1/8 lb crushed black patent
4 lb pale syrup extract
1 oz Cluster (bittering)
1/2 oz Hallertau (finishing)
2178 Lager Blend yeast


I have not made this recipe so I can't comment on its accuracy, but it
certainly looks reasonable.


One would of course mash the first three ingredients before adding the
extract.  Substitute 5 lb American 2-row malt for the extract if
all-graining.


This recipe yields about a 1.041 SG (assuming 75% efficiency; typical
kitchen-kludge partial-mashing might yield lower results).

Agreed.

Maybe so. I don't know.


>The yeast will only "feel" atmospheric pressure no matter what the

This is not correct. Yeast in a sealed bottle of beer will "feel" a 
pressure equal to the headspace pressure plus a hydraulic pressure
which is proportional to the depth at which any particular yeast cell
happens to be at. Atmospheric pressure has no effect, it is on the outside
of the bottle. Ever swim to the bottom of a 12 ft deep pool? Zero 
compressibility does not mean zero pressure gradient.


Just for fun I calculated the pressure at a depth of 7 inches in a 
carbonated bottle of beer. I assumed a temperature of 40F, a 
carbonation level of 2.5 volumes, and an SG of 1.010. 


>From a chart on force carbonating kegged beer, 2.5 volumes at 40F 
will mean there is about 12.3 psi pressure in the headspace of the 
beer. 


Using an equation which relates fluid pressure to specific gravity 
and depth I calculated an additional pressure of 0.255 psi. 


Therefore, a yeast cell near the bottom of a 12 oz longneck bottle full 
of beer will see approximatly 12.3 + 0.3 = 12.6 psi (gauge pressure). 
OK, so what? I don't know, I just can't help myself sometimes. I figure 
that while we are following these advanced academic topics we should 
challenge posts containing wrong or misleading information. No flame 
intended. I found the oxidative reduction vs. fermentation question very 
interesting. Thanks Aaron, I look forward to reading responses to this 
theory.

Subject: Force Carbonating at Room Temp/ S=Eric Fouch?


Badger Roullett asks about force carbonating at different temperatures:
>>>
my questions are...
1) if you carbonate at room temp, what shoudl the co2 settings be?
2) if you carbonate at lower temps (ie. sticking my 3 gallon kegs in the
frig) and then take it out. what happens? will i lose the carbonation?
3) if i carbonate at room temp, and then chill to serve what happens? do
i lose the carb?
<<<


For starters, get a hold of the CO2 carbonation table at the Brewery:
http://alpha.rollanet.org:80/library/CO2charts.html


Basically the pressure you need to apply is a function (second order?,
quadratic?) of the temperature and the desired carbonation level,
expressed in volumes of CO2.


So for a typical carbonation level of 2.5 Volumes of CO2, you would
apply 10 psi at 36 degrees F, but you would need 30 psi at 72 degrees
for the same degree of carbonation.


You don't _lose_ carbonation at any temperature, unless you have a leak
in your system.  Much more CO2 will dissolve in your beer at a lower
temperature so I guess there is some economy (of gas) involved in
carbonating at lower temperatures.  (Never mind the cost of
refrigeration, those of us who rely on the revenues of power companies
for our livelihood thank you, trust me).


Recall that there are two commonly used definitions of "force
carbonation" used in the HBD as well.  One camp considers anything
other than natural priming to be force carbonation, while the other uses
the term to reflect the process of hooking up the CO2 and forcing it to
carbonate by shaking the keg until  no more gas will dissolve.  The "hook
it up and leave it alone" process takes days, the "shake like hell" method
takes minutes.  When I'm not it a great hurry, I favor the leave it alone
method.  Just be sure to consult the chart to make sure you're in the right
pressure range for the temperature the beer is at.

What the hell is your e-mail address?  That junk in your header is
undecipherable, at least to me.  I found some info on the Lucy event if
you're still looking.

Subject: AHA NHC 1st Round Chicago - RESULTS


We have (finally) tabulated the results of judging 824 entries last
weekend here in Chicago. Congratulations to the winners, listed below.


A big thank-you to the legions of judges who came to Chicago, despite the
total lack of hotel rooms, to help us out. Also, special thanks to our
capable corps of stewards, without whose skills, confusion would have
reigned with so many entries. And it couldn't have been done without
Assistant Organizers Tom Fitzpatrick and Brad Reeg, or the tireless
efforts of numerous other Chicago Beer Society members who stepped
forward for unpacking, data entry, and housing out-of-town judges in
their homes. This event was the largest single homebrew competition ever
held in the Midwest, and perhaps anywhere in the world outside of the
State of Texas. (Judges: Your points have already been sent to the BJCP.)


We've also got to recognize our gracious host site - Goose Island Beer
Company's microbrewery. (not the brewpub). The brightly-lit bottling room
turned out to be perfect for judging, and the machinery was a good
backdrop for some unusual photos. Thank them by going out and buying more
Goose Island beer!


Good luck to these winners in the Second Round in Cleveland!

        With a wooden 'bong' in the side, these must have been made in the 1960's!
 (Sorry, couldn't help myself!)             ;-)


        This sounds similar to the 4 Draft Systemns kegs given to me by a Miller
distributor, except that the valve in the top of my kegs did have a dual
probe capability, just like a Hoff Stevens. The problem with this type is
that instead of a spring loaded valve for the CO2 side, as in an H-S valve,
there was what is called a "Gator Bag", made of a brown rubber material
that is similar to some types of back flow prevention devices. These perish
with age, and to my knowledge are no longer produced. I called Sabco and
ordered 4 new H-S valves and replaced them, so now I am able to use them
with the rest of my H-S kegs.  2 of them were particularly difficult to get
apart and I had to resort to the trusty Dremel Moto-Tool to cut the
retaining rings off.
        My suggestion, minimally, is to do the same with yours, that is to convert
to H-S valves. Optimally, send them to Sabco or Tosca for conversion to a
Sankey valve. More expensive, yes, but Sankeys are much easier to work
with.         They can also restore any damage to the kegs internally, like dents,
rust, or leaks.
        For your bungs, I would approach your nearby friendly brewer at a brewery
that uses them. I'm sure they would sell you some, as I'm sure you won't
want to buy them in 500 bung packages, nor do you want to pay the prices
charged for small orders. Note that there are several sizes of bung, ask if
you can borrow one to size it. These cost under 25 cents, depending on the
quantity ordered, and the seller. 


Grolsch Hops. New Homebrewing Books
        I just yesterday acquired fellow HBD contributor Graham Wheeler and Roger
Protz's books, "Brew Classic European Beers At Home," "Brew Your Own Real
Ale At Home,"  and Graham's book "The Camra Guide to Home Brewing." In
"BCEBAH," the recipe for Grolsch Premium Lager lists for a 5 US gallon
batch 7.45 lbs pilsen malt, 1.3 lb Flaked maize .9 oz Saaz and .6 oz
Hallertau at commencement of boil for 90 minutes. Step Infuse or
double-decoct . Step at 122 for 20 minute, 144 for 45 minutes and 158 for
45 minutes. OG 1048, FG 1011.  5 % ABV, 4 % ABW, 27 IBU. Irish Moss in
kettle for last 15 minutes of boil. No mention of finishing hops.
        I have not had time to read them yet, but they appear to be probably the
most comprehensive books on homebrewing I have yet seen! Nice work, Graham!

        Thank you Fred, you are very kind. I hope to see some more HBD'ers as the
'travel to GABF season' approaches. I will give a free sampler tray to
anyone who identifies themselves, to me, as HBD'ers, and give you a tour of
the brewery. This offer, of course, can only be honored if I am in the
brewery at the time you arrive. Should any of you wish to avail yourselves
of this, and call in advance to let me know when you plan to drop in, I
will arrange my schedule to accommodate you. Maybe we could talk about
beer!  Or maybe brewing? Or Beer?

Subject: HBD Moderation Guidelines


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


As alluded to in a previous post, these are the guidelines to which the
Janitors shall adhere in administering the moderation feature recently
added to the digest. 


This set of guidelines was painstakingly discussed and honed to the 
document you see here. The Steering Committee is to be commended for 
deciding this policy in order to protect the free nature of the Digest, 
while protecting its bandwidth from undesirable abuses.


See ya!
 -p 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


A policy statement of the Home Brew Digest
Deliberated upon by the Home Brew Digest Steering Committee
Unanimously agreed upon and concurred by the Janitors
Effective 21 May 1997 as follows:


In response to increased efforts by spam merchants to post chain
letters, X-rated web site advertisements, and similar items to
the HBD, the HBD Steering Committee has recently reviewed and
discussed the Digest policies.


We remain committed to an open forum for the discussion of brewing
and beer related matters; however, to keep the HBD from being
misused, we have adopted the following Guidelines for the HBD:


1.      Our guiding principle is that the HBD should not censor or
        delete *any* message that deals with beer or brewing.  The
        only exception is where the message *itself* is *clearly*
        against the law; for example, a post containing an illegal
        solicitation of investors for a microbrewery would be
        deleted, but posts discussing marijuana beer or home
        distilling -- while not encouraged -- would not.


2.      The Digest Janitor will try to delete messages that are
        obvious, indisputable detrius (misplaced unsubscribe
        requests, chain letters, etc.) and commercial spam with
        no arguable connection to beer or brewing.


3.      Posting blatant commercials to the HBD is *strongly*
        discouraged.  While such messages will not be deleted if they
        have *any* connection with beer and brewing, the HBD Steering
        Committee will encourage the HBD readership not to patronize
        businesses who clearly are abusing the HBD.


4.      Brief product or sale announcements, comments about or reviews
        of products or publications, and query responses that suggest
        a particular product or merchant (e.g., "In response to XXX's
        inquiry, my shop has a supply of corny kegs for $15 each")
        are appropriate HBD messages and *are* encouraged.


5.      HBD readers *are* the HBD.  They and the marketplace of
        ideas -- not any person or committee -- are the ultimate
        arbitrators of what beer and brewing related posts are
        worthwhile and appropriate for the HBD.


        However, the Steering Committee requests that HBD
        contributors remember that this Digest, unlike a
        USENET newsgroup, has limited bandwidth; i.e., the
        digest is limited to a certain size each day.  For
        this reason, the Steering Committee gently asks
        contributors to think carefully before posting
        messages that most readers consider inappropriate
        or of marginal utility, such as:


        A.      Personal diatribes or insults;
        B.      Complaints about a message being inappropriate
                for the HBD (if it really bothers you, send the
                "offending" party e-mail);
        C.      Complete results of a local competition (preferred:
                put them on a web site and post a short message
                identifying and pointing to its URL);
        D.      Lengthy competition announcements (you don't need

This does not seem right to me. True, water is essentially incompressible
but it can still transfer force. Pressure = force per unit area (if I
remember my freshman ME class correctly). Hence anything in the water and
the container will be subjected to the same pressure present in the
headspace above the liquid. If this were not true, hydrostatic testing of
compressed gas bottles would not work and SCUBA divers would not need
pressurized air to breath.
- -----------------------
I think I need to rephrase my previous statement.  Greg is correct that 
water can transfer pressure.  However, yeast are also filled with water.  
If a balloon filled with air is suspended in water and pressure is 
applied to the water the balloon will srink.  However, if a balloon 
filled with water is subjected to the same treatment it will not srink, 
because the water within the balloon is incompressible.


The cell membrane of a yeast cell is not like a balloon, because water 
can flow essentially freely through the membrane.  However, an increase 
in pressure above the liquid does not increase the driving force for 
water diffusion into the cell and the yeast are fine.

Steve Waite writes,


What was earlier theorized on the HBD (although so far unverified as far
as I remember), is that as HCO3- builds up in solution it changes the
osmotic pressure differential across the cell wall and prevents waste
products from escaping the cell.  It is this pressure difference which
kills the yeast.  I don't understand the details myself but, that's my
take on what's been posted to date.


- -------------------------
I don't believe this theory.  With all of the protein and other 
components dissolved in the cytoplasm of the yeast ( the liquid inside 
the yeast cell) the osmotic pressure is always going to be higher inside 
the yeast.  The other problem with this hypothesis is that osmotic 
pressure favors the exact opposite reaction.  Osmotic pressure forces 
water toward an area of higher salt concentration.  If anything, 
disolving HCO3 in the beer would cause water to flow toward it, not 
prevent it from flowing.


However, all of this is nil if you believe my first arguement that the 
higher concentration of dissolved chemicals will always be within the 
yeast cell.  Cells are able to control their osmotic pressure 
differential. 
- ------------------------------------------


This problem of differing carbonation is certainly an interesting one.  
Hopefully with all of the wisdom of the HBD we can come up with a 
satisfactory one.  As for now I still support the increased availability 
of oxygen in the underfilled bottle.

Subject: Re:Inverted Carboy Fermenter


Kim Lux described his work to create an inverted carboy fermenter by
drilling a hole in the bottom, and affixing a valve to the top (which
now becomes the bottom).  Sounds like a great setup, but I would like to
offer a warning:


The work you have done in drilling the hole has created a great many
'microcracks'.  These are small cracks in the glass, perhaps invisible
to the naked eye, which will serve as initiation sites for stress
fractures.  Have you ever cut a sheet of glass by scratching a line into
it, then stressing it at the line?  The same effect at work.


Normally, when glass is machined in such a way, the microcracks are
healed by 'firepolishing', that is, heating up the edges of the hole
with a gas flame, to the point that the glass melts slightly and the
cracks flow shut.  (If you wanted to do this, you would have to be
EXTREMELY careful not to thermally stress the glass to the point of
breakage!).  Alternately, the glass can be strengthened by etching in HF
(a very dangerous acid) which increases the radius of the cracks, thus
reducing the stress-rising effect.


I would suggest that you be aware of the weakened state of your carboy,
and treat it with extreme care:  Never set it down on its bottom without
some sort of foam cushion for protection, never fill it with hot
liquids, and be careful inserting any type of bung.


And let us know how it works out for you!
