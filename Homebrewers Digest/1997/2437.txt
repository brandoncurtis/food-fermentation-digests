HBDers -


I have been catching up on my HBD issues so forgive any tardiness in these 
topics.


HONEY and FRUIT
Several (well informed) opinions on fruit beer seemed to warn against using 
honey in a fruit style beer.  From my experience, I would disagree with them.  
First, honey does tend to dry a beer out a bit, but if you stick to orange 
blossom or wildflower honey, I find there is a residual sweetness and "honey 
flavor" that is an excellent complement to a fruit.  Also, the drying effect 
of the honey supports a stronger fruit flavor in the beer vis a vis malt, 
which would tend to mask the fruit.  For similar reasons, I advocate the use 
of flaked corn or rice in a fruit beer, as it will give a brilliant white 
long-lasting head to your fruity-colored beer.   The visual effect of a 
strawberry colored or raspberry colored beer against a brilliant white head is 
most pleasing (OK, lets keep the comments clear here guys!).


Again, I would also follow the advice given to mash high, try a little 
lactose/dextrine, etc.  Also, my advice to use honey and flakes would be 
appropriate for a tart, summer like brew, but may not be good advice for a 
raspberry stout or fruit flavored butt-kicker such as a barley-wine.


NEW MASH TUN?
I was at a conference last week during which they served coffee to the masses 
out of large rectangular "coolers" specially made for coffee.  Undoubtedly 
many of you have seen these things -- they look pretty rugged, have molded 
"feet", and latchable tops.  I was wondering if anyone out there in the 
collective either used one of these things for a mash tun or sparge tank, or 
at least had looked into using one.  They look to be a bit more durable than a 
round Gott, and might be easier to fit a slotted manifold into that the round 
Gott.  


KOLSCH
For whomever kicked off the Kolsch question, I agree that 45IBUs is way too 
much bitterness for such a beer.  But you also may want to consider using a 
bit of wheat 7-10% or so in the mash.  I should mention that I have only tried 
to make a Kolsch (up to 8 versions now.....) but have never actually tasted 
one from the source (only depended on well-informed opinions and brewpub 
versions).  Does anyone know of a commercial version, preferably imported from 
Germany, available in the US?  As far as yeast goes, I would advocate the 
Kolsch or (parish the thought!) American Ale Wyeast.  Both give the crispness 
desired, and the Kolsch version ends up with a little wine flavor added in.  
And hey, here's a thought, given the honey discussion above, why not throw in 
a little clover honey to lighten it up?


Have fun!

Been brewing for years, all grain for a while, but had a new experience
yesterday.  Just as I was getting ready to sparge a ten gallon batch I
noticed that the yeast starter had not started...through in a tablespoon
of dregs from a batch of stout & put the entire mash tun on ice...took a
while to drop the temp. but 24 hours later its nice and cool, of course,
the starter is ready, but work calls.  Anyone ever tried mashing one day
and finishing up days later?  Should I anticipate any problems when I
complete the brew Tues. night 60 hours after starting?


Anyone got suggestions on the best place to start (no pun intended) my
education on culturing yeast?  The H.Brewer's Companion?  One of
Miller's books?  Source for the yeast?  materials?  wd

CO2 TOXICITY
Nathan talked about CO2 toxicity (HB2436), and asks what to do about it. I
must admit that I find this CO2 toxicity thing a bit strange, or at least
new to me, but it does make a certain amount of theoretical sense. The
American HB preference of fermenting in smooth glass fermentors would mean
that there are no (or few) sharp points to act nucleation zones for CO2
bubbles to form, and the beer could end up supersaturated with CO2. I
suspect that the British HB preference of fermenting in open polypropylene
buckets would have the same effect, although perhaps not to the same degree
as glass. Unless you are prepared to shove some insoluble crystaline
substance into your fermentor, the best idea that I have seen was in these
pages not very long ago; shove a couple of stainless-steel pan-scourers
into your fermenter. They can be easily sterilised by boiling. The bloke
that thought that one up deserves some sort of innovation award.

Greetings:


In HBD 2436, AlK writes "I wonder if there might be a way to correct
past goofups in our Cat's Meow recipies?"


I love the Cat's Meow, it is the best collection of recipies I have every
seen.  However, some of the information contained in the Cat's Meow
can be downright scarry.  It seems there are a lot of posts in the HBD
and the Brewery BBS that offer a reply of "check the Cat's Meow" to the
question of "how do I make a ...........?"  The problem is, a person
searching for guidelines or recipes on making a particular style can
quickly be overloaded with some good information and a lot of dubious 
information.


I'm not posting this just to rant.  I truely enjoy the Cat's Meow.  I was just
wondering if there was any screening process that could be instituted. 
Or better yet, how about a "Best of the Cats Meow"?

Subject: growing hops in  hot climates


I have been growing hops in  Fresno, Ca. for several years. Fresno
summers are much  like those in West Texas, hot days without much
cooling in the evening.  I have tries many varieties, but the only  ones
I've found to flourish here are clusters and cascades. Other varieties,
including chinook, fuggles, tettnang, saaz, and  hallertau have all
experienced severe vine wilt  as soon as the  hot summer days arrive.
Some  of my fellow  homebrewers have had better  luck with these
varieties by planting them  in a location where they are  shaded all
afternoon. I do know that  Sacramento, which has similar weather to
Fresno, once had extensive hopyards, and the  main  variety grown was
clusters. The  hopyards were removed when the demand for European
varieties increased  and of course  grapes mostly replaced  the hops in
those areas.  I  have read of some  experiments wherein  the soil
temperature in this region has been  artificially cooled in the evening
and this  has resulted in the successful  growth  of  horticultural
products  which could previously  be grown successfully  in  more
northern  LATITUDES,  An  implication of this experiment  is that  the
northern  latitudes  have more cooling of the soil in the  nights than
do these southern latitudes and that  this  factor   may significantly
affect  the ability to grow  particular  plant varieties    in various
climates, latitudes or growing conditions.......Cheers,  Tom Pope

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Well, as some now know, I've been teaching a "class" on homebrewing in 
Plainsboro, NJ. Unfortunately, I appear to be a little more serious about 
buying homebrew supplies than Princeton (or Small Change?) Homebrew is 
about selling them! I can understand scheduling a day closed, but the 
last two times I went to this shop - during published hours - Joe has 
either been out watching fires or otherwise AWOL. Out here on launch for 
Ford Motor Company, my time is very limited. I don't have the half-hour 
or so I need to skeedaddle into Princeton to play "Hours of Business" 
roulette with this guy.


Sooooo... Anyone know of a decent, PROFESSIONALLY RUN homebrew shop in 
Plainsboro or environs? I need grains, extracts, dry and liquid yeasts, 
hop bags, - you know: stuff! 'Twould be great to find a shop that has it 
all. Thought I had, but...

Subject: Whither My Hops


Strange things happening in El Paso these days...


A few weeks ago I planted three Fuggles rhizomes in my backyard.  These are
fed daily from a drip irrigation system which does a good job of keeping the
soil moist but not soaked.  I  eagerly checked the mounds each day during the
first couple of weeks for signs of growth, but alas, no little green things
were ever seen.  I decided to let them grow in their own time, so I stopped
checking on them as often.


Yesterday I decided to visit my bittering buddies only to find still-bare
mounds.  Something's gotta be wrong, I figured.  Five weeks oughta be long
enough for the little bastards to at least put up shoots.  As I crouched down
and looked at one mound, I saw a neatly-bored hole diving directly into the
center of the dirt.  I probed the hole with a stick, and sure enough,
something moved...


At first I thought it was a box-turtle baby, judging from the color and
texture of the object I saw.  I shined a flashlight down the hole, which
revelaed a glistening, undulating surface, and I jumped back when I saw the
huge, cold black eye staring back at me.  Too big for a turtle (unless a
gigantic turtle had somehow burrowed here without disturbing the ground).
 Yikes!! A rattlesnake?  No, at least I didn't think so.  Certainly not
mammilian.


I began to carefully dig using a garden trowel (rhizome be damned at this
point).    The dirt fell back onto my nemesis, obscuring any partial view of
it that I once might have had.  Finally, I scooped up a large lump of moving
soil.


A friggin' bullfrog.  A bullfrog!!


"Did YOU eat my hops?",  I asked, half expecting an answer.  Disappointed by
its silence, I tossed it over the rock wall into the desert behind the house.
 Now that my mound was trashed, I figured I'd look for the rotted vestige of
my Fuggle.


Nothing.  A couple of pebbles, a leaf maybe, but no rhizome.  Frustrated, I
dug up the other two mounds.  Nada.  Zippo.  Zilch.


We don't have typical garden animal pests in the city at least; no rabbits or
gophers.  Lotsa bugs, I suppose, but can anyone guess what might have
happenned to my hops?  How long should I expect a rhizome to take to sprout?
 Is my beer ruined?

Subject: Check Valves in CO2 Manifold?


I'm designing/fabricating a modular CO2 distribution manifold for my keg
system.  Anyone who's done something similar could provide some input on this
design.  The description of my design follows:


Coming out of the low pressure side of the regulator I plan to connect to a
series of Parker or Weatherhead brass Tees, one tee for each "node" on the
manifold.  On the "branch" of each tee (the outlet that intersects the "run")
I am looking to connect a 1/4" brass ball valve and then a check valve to
shut off the gas supply and prevent back-flow of beer into the gas line.


The Parker Valve catalog lists a series of Standard Check Valves and a series
of O-ring Poppet Check Valves.  Both series are somewhat similar but the
O-ring style uses a pair of O-rings (naturally) to seal, whereas the standard
valve uses a custom molded seal.  Both are available in "cracking pressures"
of 0.33, 1, 5, 10 psi.  I'm assuming that I would want the lowest cracking
pressure available.  Comments on which series or cracking pressures?


There is a check valve on the low pressure side of the regulator that came
with the regulator assembly.  Does this make the check valves I plan to
install at each node unnecessary, or does it only provide a level of
insuarance against filling my manifold with liquid?


Comments, concerns, ideas?

>(O.G.- 1.070, F.G.- 1.016)


I believe that what you mean is that you brewed a Celis Grand Cru clone,
not a "Grand Cru."  Grand Cru is not a style... it is a name that a
brewer may give one of their beers that is "special" in some way.  "Grand
Cru" means something like "Special Vintage" or "Special Bottling" or
"Deluxe."


In the case of Celis (and Hoegaarden, which Pierre used to own), the
Grand Cru is a stronger, all-barley version of Celis White (or Hoegaarden
Wit).  In the case of Rodenbach, the Grand Cru is 100% higher-OG recipe
beer, aged in huge oak tuns, whereas the "standard" beer is a blend of
the aged beer and a much younger, lower-OG beer.


So, back to your question.  According to the AHA guidelines, there is
no mention of spices being acceptable in Belgian Strong (which is where
this beer should really be), so it may or may not get clobbered for
having spices (depends on the judges).  You could enter it in Herb
and Spice under Classic-style and specify Belgian Strong as the classic
style.  If you do enter it under Belgian Strong, you had better make
sure that the organiser promises to give the judges special instructions
to allow spices in the Belgian Strong Ales.

Subject: Polyclar/Wort canning (NOT)!


Regarding the Polyclar, I checked this weekend and the Polyclar SB100
is the "standard" Polyclar, also known as "Polyclar AT."  The Polyclar 10
is the finer and slower-settling stuff.

Incidentally, regarding that poster who described his wort canning
technique, I'd like to add my name to the (undoubtedly long) list of
people who will warn you about botulism.  You really need to either
pressure-cook the wort (INCLUDING THE LIDS!) to make sure you have
killed any botulism spores OR boil and chill the canned wort just
before use.  Using wort that has been canned simply using boiling
water will work fine 999 times out of 1000, but that 1000th time
it will kill you.  It may actually be safer than that, but you are
certainly more likely of killing yourself using boiling-water-canned
wort than you are winning the lottery.  Frankly, I don't like the
odds.

Firstly, let me admit that I may be using the term "CO2
toxidity" incorrectly, so please don't start using this
term unless someone with considerably more knowledge of
biochemistry than I confirms that the expression is indeed
valid.  Biochemists?  Anyone?


As for what you can do, well, there are two things. One
is the temperature of the ferment.  Recall that CO2 solubility
is strongly dependent on temperature.  The cooler the beer,
the more CO2 will dissolve in it.  You may simply have
to warm up the beer to get it to hold less CO2 in solution
and therefore finish fermenting without doing the polka
with your carboy every day.


Another thing you can do (on a subsequent batch) is to not
remove all the cold break.  According to Malting and Brewing
Science (or was it The Practical Brewer?), there are researchers
that believe that cold break may provide nucleation sites for
CO2 and prevent the fermenting beer from getting supersaturated
with CO2 (i.e. if there are no nucleation sites, you can actually
dissolve more than the normal level of CO2 in the beer for
a given temperature -- that's supersaturation).


There have been a couple of Technical Communications on this
topic in Brewing Techniques in 1996, I believe.  Look for
"The Trouble with Trub-less Fermentations" or something like
that.

Greetings brewers,


I have a couple quick questions.


1. About CO2(carbon dioxide) tanks.  I have a 20 lb tank but would like =
to get a 10 or 5 lb. tank.  Anyone know of a relatively inexpensive =
source?  I would prefer not to buy new (slightly cost prohibitive!). =20
I live in the AnnArbor, MI area.




2. Anyone have experience with using DeWolf-Cosyns Belgian Pilsen malt?  =
I recently brewed a ginger wit with 50% belgian pilsen/50% raw soft =
wheat.  I have brewed the same recipe several times, but had used Klages =
malt instead of the Pilsen. With the Pilsen malt there was a =
bunch(result of iodine test) of unconverted starch.  That caused lots of =
problems and I think I will be writing it up to experience.  I presume =
that the pilsen malt had a much lower diastatic power level than I =
suspected.  Thoughts?  Comments?


I express my appreciation in advance for any replies.


Thanks,

This doesn't sound quite right.  While I agree that hops transplanted from
one place to another tend to develop different characteristics.  I have
first hand experience with hops that were genetically Hallertauer Mittelfrueh,
Tettnang Tettnanger, Saaz, and East Kent Goldings, but grown in the Pacific
Northwest of the US and indeed they had different characteristics than the
same hops from the original country.  I'm quite sure that many homebrewers
have tried those Northern Brewer plugs that are grown in Hallertau and would
agree with me that they are much more "German" in character than
American-grown Northern Brewer.  A most striking example is Styrian Goldings
which are actually genetically Fuggles, but smell and taste like East Kent
Goldings!


One concern of mine is that there are so many different varieties that are
*called* "Goldings."  These have all been grouped together into what we
call "Goldings" these days ["A Question of Pedigree - The Role of Genealogy
in Hop Substitutions" by Don Van Valkenburg, Brewing Techniques, Vol.3, No.5].


The other concern is that it seems hard to believe that 200 miles could
change daylight length enough to affect hops.  Sure, in Kenya, where the
days are 5 hours and 50 minutes shorter than they are in Yakima, Washington
on June 21st, but 200 miles?  I just checked the sunrise and sunset times
for Seattle, WA and Portland, OR which are about 170 miles apart and virtually
along the same line of longitude and Seattle will have 17 minutes more daylight
than Portland on June 21st 1997.  You can check for yourself at:


http://www.blackwalk.com/suntimes.htm


Furthermore, this is on June 21st.  By July 20th, the difference is only
10 minutes!


What about soil chemistry, wind, rainfall, daytime temperature, nighttime
temperature?  Surely these factors combined would influence the
characteristics of the hops more than 17 minutes of daylight, don't you think?

Just used my Gott^H^H^H^H Rubbermaid 10 gal mash/lauter tun for the 
first time, it replaced a rectangular Coleman system that recently 
migrated to California.  


Both tuns have slotted copper tube false bottoms but the new
Rubbermaid model performed superbly.  I recycle the first runnings to 
clarity, as is typical, but the recirculation time for my new system
was maybe a fifth of that for the old rectangular model (10mins vs 45-50 
mins).  This is to be expected - less filter bed area to set up - but I 
urge those of you considering these two options to bear in mind this 
advantage of the cylindrical lauter tun geometry.


(The brew was a 50% wheat malt, single infusion American Wheat Ale, 
Corona type mill, Estrella brand, cf. MaltMill with previous mash 
system; temp. loss was 1 deg C over 60 mins).

Subject: IPA etc


Greetings All,


Dave Riedel asked for advice on a planned IPA.  Great beer for summer (or
anytime).


For this style you can get an appropriate maltiness with a 100% HB Pale Ale
grist, but you will want a healthy OG to give the necessary backbone to
support the high hopping rates of the style.  A minor amount of crystal
malt is OK, but not essential. You might target a gravity of 1.060 and 60
IBU's. You want a yeast that attenuates well, and the Wyeast #1056 will do
just fine. Having a neutral flavour profile, this yeast will let the malt
and hop flavours shine through.


When you ask about suggestions for the hops in your freezer (good selection
there) you will likely get a number of responses from the HBD crowd.  My
two bits worth would be to go with the GR Northern Brewer for bittering and
Goldings for flavour and aroma.  You might also blend some Fuggle in there
as well.


My last IPA went something like this...


12.5 lbs HB Pale Ale Malt
2oz HB Crystal Malt
*2.25oz First Gold hops `at` 8% a/a - 60 min                *denotes my hop scale broke on
brew day !
*0.5oz US Goldings `at` 5.2% a/a - 30 min                        These measures are therefore
approximate !!
*1.5oz US Goldings `at` 5.2% a/a - steep 5 min
 1187 Ale Yeast


OG 1.068 (!)  FG 1.012


As you can guess this is a big malty beer, but it is still hoppy and
approximates the style. Next time I will drop the Crystal and go all HB
Pale Ale, or I may add some HB Vienna.  And I will lower the gravity, as
this version is a bit boozy, though delicious from start to finish.


Good luck Dave in your next IPA.


Any other IPA suggestions/recent brews from the collective ?


Regards,


Mark Bridges

Hi!

Would you believe me if I said that it is standard practice on
commercial 4/6 roll malt mills to have anti-explosive devices fitted?
These take the form of ledges directly underneath the rollers. The
ledges ensure the roller gap is full of grain, not air and malt dust,
that can be explosive if a bit of metal or stone goes through the
rollers, creating sparks.
I kid you not!
(the FEDS may have been interested by these anti explosive devices!)

Feeling lucky Jethro? Just remove those anti explosive devices from your
mill...
