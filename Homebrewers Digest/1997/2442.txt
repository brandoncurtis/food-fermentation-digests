"At about $70 less than the Malt Mill, and lacking any 
*quantitative*evidence to imply that its performance is equally
discounted, the Valley Mill appears to be a great deal."


I won't quibble about your enthusiasm for the mill of your choice but
the last time I looked at their web page,  the delivered price was
$130.50.


The last time I looked at our price list, the delivered price of a
standard MALTMILL was $120 and the last time I looked at Zymurgy I
saw dealers selling them for $99.


Not sure what quantative evidence you are looking for but I would
think hollow rollers and plastic bearings would be a place to start
the search and then I would wonder why so many people prefer a mill
that does not have to be adjusted and then I would take a look at
all the options that are available on the MM, the lifetime warranty
and then, well I guess that's enough for now.

S Murman writes of his friend's experience at a brew it yerself joint. As
far as I know there are none anywhere near Dallas, Texas, but I made it a
point to visit one in March when I visited Portland, OR. 




I don't know if it's common practice, but this place had "mixers" once a
month or so. They had 8 kettles, and I think each batch made about 6
cases of beer, so they'd have parties of 8 or 16 sign up (sign up with a
friend or meet friends there). They'd make 8
<bold><italic>different</italic></bold> batches of beer, and everybody
would come back to bottle. At the end, each person would take home a case
or so of each of 8 different kinds of beer. Great way to make friends,
learn about brewing, and hone your tastes on what kind of beer you wanted
to brew.

Ah, now that's what we needed! Thanx Ian for setting us/me 
straight on the differences. I knew I was only lukewarm with my
assessment. I hope you didn't get the impression that I was 
sniping or flaming, that was NOT the intent. It's just that poor

I agree with everything you said regarding the HBD, particularly
FUN and the interjection of humour. So, even though I'm half

I was sick of taking an hour or more to crush malt , so i shortened the
handle, drilled and tapped (#7 drill , 1/4 20 tap) put a piece of

Subject: flaked maize


Hello felow brewers, a quick question:


What's the flavor contribution, if any, of flaked maize?  I've read in
some places that flaked maize imparts a subtle sweetness; I've read in
other places that it contributes no flavor, and is useful primarily to
lighten the body of a beer.  Apparently Fuller's in London uses flaked
maize in their ESB.  Is the maize one of the contributing sources of the
sweetness of Fuller's ESB?  Any clarification of this would be most
appreciated.

Subject: Batch Sparging


A few HBD's ago someone posted about "batch sparging".  I think the topic was
more about the rate of sparging & not having to monitor it, but it got me
thinking about how much wort is or isn't lost with this "compromise" between
no-sparge and full-sparge techniques.  The results, at least on paper, were
interesting (see way below).  Perhaps a confirmed batch-sparger among us
could verify the results?


First, some background.  In all-grain brewing, the "usual" way to remove the
wort from the grain is to drain slowly while adding more clear water to the
top of the grain bed, rinsing the sugar from the grain as completely as
possible into the kettle.  In the "no-sparge" variation (see HBD's from late
December of 1996), wort is only drained and not rinsed.  This "wastes" some
wort, that which is absorbed by the grain, but that amount is often small
enough that simply adding more grain to compensate is not a problem.  "Batch"
sparging involves draining without rinsing, then adding hot water and again
draining without rinsing.  Much of the sugar left behind in no-sparging is
thereby recovered.


The advantage of batch-sparging for many would seem to be that no means for
trickling sparge water onto the mash is necessary, and not having to balance
sparge water input rate versus wort output rate.  This simplifies both
equipment and process issues.  The key to getting good extraction in both
no-sparge and batch-sparge brewing is in allowing the grain to drain as fully
as pratical; this could add more time to brewing but again that's perhaps
offset by the other advantages above.


This can be a big plus for a kitchen-boud brewer, since no fancy pumps or
gravity-feed sparging system needs to be rigged.  Partial-mashers not
interested in creating full-blown brewing rigs can use this technique too.
 Set the brewpot on a chair, drain the mash tun into the pot, dump more hot
water into the mash tun, recirculate, then drain again.  Once the drain rate
is established you can go watch TV or change baby's diapers for the next
half-hour or so; the sparge becomes semi-automatic..


We've seen from no-sparge reports in the past that "efficiencies" of as poor
as 60% and worse are possible, menaing that quite a bit of extra grain is
required to achieve a given gravity.  "Efficiency" in this case referes to
the percentage of wort collected versus what would have been collected with
full-sparging; actual conversion efficiency is assumed to have been taken
into account during recipe formulation.  Since there *is* sort of a rinse
process involved in batch-sparging, we would expect the "efficiency" to be
higher.  According to my back-of-the-envelope doodlings, I figure a good
batch-sparge can be almost as efficient as a full-sparge.  If you mash
relatively thin and allow enough time for full drainage, you could be as good
as 95% as efficient as full-sparging.  Even with thicker mashes and poor
draining, efficiencies of 85%+ should be obtainable, still quite an
improvement over even the best no-sparge figures.


The "formula" I derived for efficiency is as follows:


Eff = 1 - B^2 / (A + B)^2     (times 100%)


(e-mail me if you want to see my derivation)


where A is the gallons per pound drained in both the initial and the
batch-sparge runoffs.  B is the gallons per pound absorbed by the grain.  The
assumption was that one strikes in with (A + B) gallons per pound, drains off
A gallons per pound, then adds A gallons per pound for the "rinse" and drains
that fully.  Total brewpot volumes is then 2*A.  Also assumed is that all the
wort held back in the first runoff will blend with the "rinse" water for the
second runoff.  In real life, the efficency will probably be a bit lower than
predicted by the equation.


Note that the formula is valid for any units of A & B as long as the same
units are used throughout (i.e., liters per kg can be used).


Typical values for A and B:


A can be anything from 0.25 to 0.5, with 0.33 being a common figure (1.33
qt/lb).  My experiments show B to be about 0.13 (0.52 qt/lb) but I've seen
figures as low as 0.08 (0.32 qt/lb).  With typical values of A = 0.33 and B =
0.13, efficiency is a decent 92% of a fully-sparged wort.


For the metrically-inclined, 1 gal per pound = 8.35 litres per kg.


Batch-sparge efficiency is improved by long, complete drainage of both
runoffs (minimizes the value of B) as well as thinner mashes (higher values
of A).

Graham, for what it's worth, the main hop growing region is around Nelson

I know that in my fermentations, when there are big

Either there is a vast difference between Scottish Ales from northern
and southern Scotland or you have been away from home far too long.


I tasted perhaps two dozen ales brewed in Scotland (primarily in the
southern half) when I visited there in the summer of 1995, and I really
didn't notice them to be that different from English Bitters.  According
to the AHA guidelines they aren't supposed to have hop aromas, but *most*
did... they aren't supposed to be as bitter as English Bitters, but
*most* were... they aren't supposed to be balanced more towards bitterness
rather than maltiness, but *most* were...  and the hops used were all
English varieties, not Continental ones.  Overall, there really wasn't
that much difference between them and English Bitters.  In fact, one
or two beers brewed by McEwan's and sold in Scotland with shilling
designations (i.e. 60/-, 70/-, etc.) are also sold in northern England
simply relabeled "Younger's" beers with English beer names (IPA, Bitter,
etc.).


The next time I visit, I will definitely make a strong effort to seek out
Scottish Ales brewed in the northern half.  If indeed the southern
Scottish Ales have been "Anglified" then, that's a real shame.

Most commercial hops grown in New Zealand are grown in the Nelson area
at the top of the South Island (latitude 41 degrees South approx).

Dear friends,
I ask form information about preparing different kind of malts using pale 
or pilsner malt. I received a couple of answer indicating that I can 
prepare these malts by roasting my pilsner or pale malt. I was also 
informed that I can prepare crystals by kilning my malt after soaking it 
and using aluminum foil ( kind of a mashing in the oven ). However, I 
still have a question. When I prepare munich or amber as an example, 
using my pilsner or pale malt, should I soak it first or just roast it 
in the oven directly? I am a little confused about it.
Thanks for your replies.

Eric: I would not use Idophor on plastic. I ruined two batches of brown
ale in a row from it. I believe it gets into the plastic. The smell
persisted until I soaked the plastic with oxygen bleach (Purex) for a
couple of days. Now I use chlorine bleach (1 tbl per gallon of water)
and rinse thoroughly. No problems with infection from the tap water. I
believe this problem is vastly overrated. I suspect many "contaminated
beers" are merely beers that haven't been aged enough, and get tossed
down the drain for no good reason. In my 25 years of brewing I have
NEVER had a batch ruined by infection. I am careful with sanitation, but
not a fanatic about it. On the up side, I was still able to drink the
"iodine beer" and actually developed a taste for it... Kinda like shrimp
flavor... I do use idophor for glass and stainless steel, but never for
plastic.
