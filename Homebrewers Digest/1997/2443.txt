Well, I thought the ears cooked by first resting 30 min `at` 150 F tasted
noticeably sweeter than those brought quickly to boiling.  My wife
thought so as well.  My kids were not convinced, however.  So, I guess
I'll need to run a few more experiments to prove/disprove my hypothesis.


Who knows; once baseball is over, maybe I'll actually have time to brew
again!  Gotta keep thinking about those mash reactions in the meantime,

I've drilled 2 enamel pots to install easy mashers.  I did get a little
chipping, but it was minor enough that I could cover it with the rubber
washer that makes the seal with the pot.


I recommend sandwiching the inside and outside of the pot with blocks of
wood held together with big clamps, then drill through the wood.  A carbide
bit will help you get through the glass enamel coating.  1"x1" strips are
narrow enough that they fit the curve of the pot fairly well.

I've been thinking of brewing a rosemary pale lately.  I'm planning
something along the lines of a single infusion mash, OG 1.050-1.060,
probably whole Cascade at 60 min and 30 min, with a large dose of fresh
rosemary at knockout to replace the aroma hops or possibly dry-herbing with
rosemary in the secondary.  I'm looking to create an ale along the lines of
a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale or Anchor Liberty Ale with a rosemary rather than
a Cascade aroma


Has anyone out there in HBD-land ever brewed such a concoction?  If so, how
much rosemary did you use (and when), and how successful was the result?

Subject: RE: Iodophor / Rye beer / shipping beer


     Hi all,
     
     Occasionally people write in talking about iodophor flavors in their 
     beer.  They always mention that it is billed as a "no rinse" 
     sanitizer.  Yes, it is no rinse, but if you read the instructions 
     carefully, it says to allow it to air dry before using the vessel!
     
     Your beer may very well taste like iodine if you put it in a container 
     that is wet with iodophor!  Either rinse it out or let it dry (which 
     allows the volatile iodine to evaporate).
     ----------------------------------
     Audra asks about rye beer.  She mentions that her brewer is an extract 
     brewer, yet gives us an all-grain recipe.  The grain bill seems fine, 
     except that I would use more rye (at least 50%).  Of more concern is 
     the fact that this might be a first all-grain attempt.
     
     I have never been one to discourage mashing, but if you do a rye beer 
     as your first all-grain batch, you may never do another!  It is not 
     easy to work with.  It will gum up the lauter tun fiercely.
     
     If this is your first all-grain beer, you may want to try starting 
     with an all-barley malt recipe, just to work out the kinks in your 
     technique and system before doing a rye beer.  Even wheat beers are 
     easier to lauter!
     ----------------------------------
     Dan Ritter writes in about his UPS woes.  I had a similar experience 
     yesterday.  I went in to UPS and noticed some new signs.  One read, 
     "All glass must be inspected."  "Hmmm," I thought.  "I'd better think 
     fast."
     
     The guy looked at the address on the package.  It read, "Beer 
     Unlimited."
     
     "Is this beer?" he asked.
     
     Remembering Dan's post, I replied, "It's root beer in plastic bottles, 
     and I only wrote "fragile" because I'm paranoid."
     
     The guy believed my BS, and then went on to tell me that it was 
     illegal to ship beer, and that they also are not allowed to ship 
     pressurized, glass bottles (ie, beer or soda) by air because "it will 
     explode."
     
     I wanted to explain to the guy that I doubted they were going to ship 
     my bottles into space, where the pressure difference might cause the 
     caps to blow off, but I decided it was best to just nod and smile.
     
     In summary, lie through your teeth to ship beer UPS.  Call the AHA and 
     UPS and demand clarification of the law.  For the time being, don't 
     organize contests with shipping addresses that say "beer" or "brew" or 
     other obviously alcoholic words!  It makes the counter person VERY 
     suspicious!
     
     Have fun!

I have used Idophor with glass, stainless and plastic for several years
and never have off flavor in beers...not a chemist but surely blasting
the plastic container with 150 degree F got water for a few minutes
eliminates any Idophor remaining in the plastic...actually I store the
stuff in the plastic for reuse, and yes, it stains, but hot, hot water
takes care of the stain and the taste from my experience.  I do think
switching to bleach from time to time is wise just to keep the critters

I certainly got the hop growing region in NZ wrong (thanks Murray and
Bruce). Perhaps I'd better stick to not making wild guesses about things I
don't know about. My natural curiosity now wonders why the north of South
Island rather than the south; presumably demographics, hospitality of the
land etc. At least I now know where the hops are grown in NZ. This Internet
lark certainly speeds up the learning process.

I've always mashed in at 1.33 qt/lb, which (if I'm reading the formula
correctly) would be A + B.  A would then be 1.33-B or 0.81 qt/lb.  Am I
reading this correctly?


I usually do a semi-batch sparge -- I don't drain the bed completely,
but instead add a quart of 170F sparge water periodically to top-up the
liquid level.  I've had good efficiencies and bad efficiencies. 
However, I believe that the most significant variable for me is crush
quality.

The Brewing Techniques web site (as you might expect,
http:\\www.brewingtechniques.com ) has a nice section on beer styles. 
In this section is a very good article on Wit beers by Martin Lodahl in
which Martin opines on your two questions:


1) 2-row or 6-row -- Martin suggests 2-row pils malt, Belgian if you can
get/afford it.


2) Decoction -- Given the use of unmalted wheat, some sort of
temperature program is recommended.  Martin implies that a decoction
would be nice, but not necessary.


I highly recommend the article, as well as the others in the section.

I do batch sparging in my RIMS system and get a normal efficiency of
about 78% of the theoretical yield of 35 pts. for 2 row.  I let the
outflow go as fast as a 1/2" valve will let it go out until it goes to
a trickle, then pump in another shot of water to cover the grain and
do it again.  A couple of times I did the trickle-in/trickle-out
method and my sparge times went up 3-fold and I got maybe 1/2 to 1
percent better extraction.  My time is lots more valuable than the few
cents more of grain I have to buy to hit the correct OG, and I don't
have any ego problems about having low extraction rates.  What counts
to me is that I can formualate a recipe I have never made before and
hit it within 1-2 pts. OG and that my brew day is as short as possible
(and that is already up to 6 hours).

Just as a follow-up, my friend is still waiting for his beer and it's
now been two months since they brewed the first time.  The last time
he checked, the operations folks said the beer was still green, which
I can understand, but then I'm a brewer.  My friend was less than
pleased however, perhaps because he sees me sitting on my deck
enjoying my brews.  Then again, perhaps it's because they're charging
US $100 for the privledge of watching someone brew two cases of beer.
The place here (South Bay S.F., CA) is part of a chain, and I've seen
these folks selling their bottled brews in the local groceries.  This
makes sense to me; get the people to taste the beers, and if they like
them maybe they'll come in and brew some.

George de Piro (brew club honcho extraordinairre) commented on my
plans to sour mash becuase I was concerned about removing the lacto
critters from my fermentation set-up.  I agree that autoclaving should
remove any problems from tubes, airlocks, etc., but not everyone has a
pressure cooker.  I'm going only on second-hand information here but I
figured I'd rather play it safe than find out that lacto guys are
ruining my pale ales later on.  I've been told that iodopher and
bleach have *not* completely removed lacto cultures from fermenters,
and I think I've even heard that autoclaving has not worked.  Again, I
don't have first-hand info on this, so if anyone can clear this up,
please do.

     Hi all,
     
     Chuck asks about the contribution of flaked maize.  I have been 
     thinking about this myself.  It adds a definite corn flavor to the 
     beer.
     
     It does, however, dilute malt flavor (because it replaces some of the 
     malt).  I made a Pre-Pro Pils a while back with estimated IBU's of 
     30-40 (depending on which formula you use).  It tasted MUCH more 
     bitter than that!  I have a theory, which is mine, that the perception 
     of bitterness was increased greatly because of the lack of malt to 
     provide balance.  Next time I will reduce my hop rates appropriately.
     
     This is pure speculation, mind you, but I think there's something to 
     it.  A while back I made an Altbier with slightly less hops than the 
     Pre-Pro pils.  The bitterness was MUCH lower, however.  Could it be 
     because the Alt was 100% malt, and single decocted?  The malt flavor 
     balanced the bitterness, thus reducing perception of hops.  I don't 
     know, just something to ponder...
     ----------------------------
     Ken talks about batch sparging, and mentions running the grain bed dry 
     between spargings.  In my experience, a lot of draff comes out of the 
     lauter tun when you run the bed dry .  This would be a bad thing.
     
     It may be best to not run the bed dry.  Also, what's the problem with 
     adding water to the tun every 10 minutes?  I add a few gallons of 
     sparge water, do other things for ~10 minutes, then add another few 
     gallons of water on top of the grain bed before it goes dry.  Doesn't 
     seem like too much trouble.  There is no need to "match" in flow with 
     out flow.
     
     Have fun!

I have been batch sparging for about 6 months, but my method is a little
different than what you described.  I recirculate the first running and
than slowly drain off into the boiler, i than add half my sparge water
and stir the mash for a about 30 seconds, let it sit for 15 minutes, and
drain off for 15 minutes. I then add the remaining water and let it sit
unstirred for 15 minutes and drain off slowly.  My extract efficiency
went from 50% with a traditional type sparge to 65% with the batch
sparge, i blame the poor efficiency on my mash tun design, a rectangular
picnic cooler with a poorly made false bottem, which i plan on chaning
in the near future.

Dear HBD,


Since things are a little slow I thought I'd submit a few accumulated
questions...


Q1:At what PSI do you begin to risk Bottle bombs. Specifically for 20oz Bass
and Red Hook Starbucks coffee stout bottles? I just bottled some raspberry
Cider, and I had it cranked up to 20psi for a sparkling effect. In order to
bottle it I released all the head pressure and bottled at 8psi as per usual.
But there was alot of foaming around. I packed them in a box and bagged the
box and put it in my beer closet in the basement. What do you think, did I
make a mess?


Q2: I just keged my Summer Weizen, How many ATM's should a proper German
Wheat be carbonated at? 2.7-3??


Q3: I found a bottle of LLBean Raspberry Syrup in my pantry. Im considering
drawing off a 2 liter of wheat and making some Raspberry Wheat.  How do I
best accomplish this? Should I use it for Priming? If so how points would I

O.K. so what are the big clumps?  Every once in a while I have a
fermentation that is so active, that I have considered trying to harness
the power to heat my house in the winter.  Anyway, when I am blessed
with one of these really big ferments, I have observed the mystery
clumps floating about.  I have seen clumps as big as 3/8 of an inch or so
and sometimes is looks like a tornado in my carboy.  The appearance of
the clumps are definitely a function of the activity of the ferment (at least
in my home brewery).  Therefore I don?t think it is too much of a stretch to
say they are yeast related.  I have observed cold break coagulating in
the carboy after a really good counterflow chill session (hot break left in
kettle).  But the cold break falls apart with the lightest disturbance.  If the
clumps are cold break, how does it stay together in the vigors of a
tornadic fermentation?  I tend to go with Dave on this one.  The yeast floc
together to form huge colonies when you have a super ferment going on.

>  1) Which is better to use 2-Row or 6-Row, and why?


6-row has more enzymes, and since you'll presumably be using 50% unmalted
wheat (maybe with some oats), it can't hurt to have all you can get.  It
has slightly lower yield and slightly higher tannins and polyphenols than
2-row, but with low-tannin wheat (because it's huskless), there should be
no problem.  I've found that since it is slightly less plump than 2-row,
double or even triple passes through a Malt Mill results in really top
quality crush.


2-row would be nearly as good, but be sure not to get Briess's new *pale
ale* 2-row (Harrington), which is malted and kilned in the British
tradition and is higher in color (3.5) and lower in enzymes than their
regular 2-row.  Some distributors may have changed without telling
everybody because it seems that's what everyone prefers for ales.  It would
be a poor choice for a wit.


>  2) Is it better to do a decoction mash ?


I wouldn't bother.  I've just mashed in at 140 for 30 minutes, then boosted
with heat to 158F.  You could just mash in at 153 as well.  I've done a
step mash with a 30 minute protein rest at 122F and got disappointing head
retention.  Musta chewed up the proteins too much.


>  Any, other tips or info. would be great.


If you can get raw, soft white winter wheat, that's the best and what they
use in Belgium.  Soft wheat is typically lower in protein than hard, and is
easier to mill as well.  White wheat is lower in tannins and phenols than
red.  It lends a nice softness to the beer than you can detect as early as
the mash.

The process of adding sparge water continuously while draining the
laeuter tun is called "fly sparging."


I just wanted to throw a small spanner (wrench) into the works...
Saying that batch sparging "can be almost as efficient" as 
fly sparging, assumes that the fly sparging is 100% efficient.
In most cases, it is not.  The factor you have forgotten Ken,
is *channeling*.  Channels are like little 3-D rivers running
through the grain bed.  Depending on your crush, runoff rate,
laeuter tun design, and probably whether your are more than
50 degrees from the equator, you will have either more or less
channeling.  If you have more channeling than most, there's a
good chance that batch sparging may be more efficient than
fly sparging.


As for whether batch sparging may be an option for no-sparge
brewers, I think it depends on what the reasons are for the
brewer not sparging.  If it's because of kettle size limitations,
time constraints, or some (as yet unproven) additional malt
character, then I don't think that batch sparging would be that
attractive.  Personally, now that I've built this 15-gallon
system, I usually do parti-gyle brewing (one strong, one
medium, one weak beer, or some combination of three worts)
so batch sparging lends itself very easily to this.  Although,
of the 20-odd batches I've brewed, all but two or three of them
were fly sparged (even the parti-gyle-like batches).

Subject: Water Chemistry problem


I've got some questions for any water chemists out there in the collective


I got a water analysis from my local municipality (Newberry, Florida) taken
at the well head.  My well is located about 1 mile from the municipal well
field and is within 50' of the same depth.  we are both drawing from the
upper Floridan aquifer which flows through a limestone bedrock system.
water quality is consistent throughout this area, so I am confident that
their analysis will closely  reflect the ion content of my water.  The ion
concentrations  for the major ions are as follows:


Calcium, dissolved                                52 mg/L
Sulfate, dissolved                        4.9 mg/L
Magnesium, dissolved                3.5 mg/L
Sodium,  dissolved                                2.4 mg/L
Chloride, dissolved                                5.1 mg/L
Carbonate, dissolved                ??? the report  doesn't say
Hardness                                        171 mg/L
Alkalinity (dissolved as CaCo3)              130 mg/L


Here are my questions:


1) Can the concentration of carbonate be determined from the above data
since it was not given in the report?
2) How much will boiling the water reduce the ionic concentrations of
Calcium and Carbonate?  When I boil 15 gallons of brewing water for 10
minutes to reduce alkalinity I get about 3/4 teaspoon of precipitate,
presumably Calcium carbonate.  
3) Does boiling  reduce the Calcium enough that I need to add some back?  My
pale / pilsner mash pH has been in the 5.0 to 5.5 range after boiling the
water but without adding gypsym. Have I just answered my own question? 
4) If I add gypsum will it make the mash *too* acid?        


It looks to me like this water is pretty easy to adjust for almost any style
of beer.  If I can get the answers to the above questions, I think that I
can figure the rest out with the Brew Water calculator.  Any help will be
greatly appreciated.  Private E-mail ok.


TIA

It is a misconception that small employers are exempt from OSHA regs.  All

YOU are an employee.  Granted, an establishment employing 10 or fewer persons

Subject: Batch Sparging


A few other points to consider with batch sparging versus conventional
sparging:


1.  In conventional sparging, the top grain layer gets increasingly more
rinsed the higher you get from the false bottom.  That is, the sugar
concentration is a function of  the distance from the screen.  It seems to me
that there is a much higher risk of leaching out tannins and other
undesirable flavors this way.  In batch sparging, I would think that the
sugar concentration would be more homogenous, and would not change when you
drain the wort out.  The drawback is the filtering of sugars by the grain as
the wort is drained out


2.   I noticed much less channeling of the flow through the grain bed when I
switched from conventional to batch sparging.  Try as I might, it did not
seem that I could sprinkle the water gently enough to avoid stirring up the
grain bed, and getting the flow right was impossible with all of the steam
and all.  And when the sparge was done, I could see channels in the grain.
 So know I just drain as much as I can at first, pour in my sparge water,
stir well, and recirculate for 20 minutes.


3.   It's so easy!  No more bending over steam to see where the level is.  No
more trying to keep the sparge water at the right temperature for 45 minutes.
 No more wondering what the actual temp of the water was when it hit the
grain bed, after losing all that heat to steam.  Now I can start boiling my
first runnings while the sparge is going, and save another 20 minutes there
too.  I estimate that I have cut my brew time by an hour, and if that's not a
definition of efficiency I don't know what is.

You don't want the flavor of decoction in a wit. Step mash 125-132-141-156-168. 
Use flaked wheat not wheat malt. You can buy it in health food stores.  
Use the right yeast. BrewTek and Yeast Culture Kit Co have the best wit yeasts.

<snip>


Not to drag this debate on for too long, but I just returned from a trip
to the UK, and beg to differ.  Obviously, we might not have tasted the
same beers and our taste in beer may differ (perceptions etc).  But my
conclusion, the Scottish ales (80/~ etc) did taste *different* than many
of the English ales (Bitters etc).  I did taste some weak Scottish ales
that tasted like weak English ales.  I don't think this can be
attributed to a blending of styles.  Rather, to inferior products (on
both sides).


Most importantly, the yeast(s) used contribute a completely different
taste profile.  Many of the ales in Scotland did retain more "malty"
characteristics.  In addition to the multiple layers of residual malt,
many of the Scottish ales had slight hints of wine or a vinous taste. 
Again, most likely a direct result of the yeast strains used (or
bacteria?).  These strains also left a very distinct aroma.  It is
difficult for me to fully describe this aroma (I'm not as poetic as MJ),
but I would say that the predominate profile was one of complex
toasted/roasted caramel. Slight citrus hops on the nose; but they played
a back-row seat to the malt.  This aroma was NOT out of style. 


I found these ales to have *balancing* bitterness, and at times,
slightly assertive bitterness.  BUT, the perceived bitterness was
completely different from those of the English beers.  Maybe softer and
less prickly.  I don't know, but I assume that the actual hops used
differ (not to mention the hop schedule and longer boiling times), but
they were definitely not the same.  The Scottish ales did not have the
classic English characteristics (Fuggle, Golding, etc).  Two beers may
have the same IBU's but the attenuation of the yeast, and the taste
compounds, completely alter the perception of the bitterness; not to
mention the difference in hop varieties and grain bill.  Bottom line,
these ales were in no way alike.


To say that the Scottish ales have possibly been "Anglified" is, in my
opinion, dead wrong. I found both styles of beer to be equally enjoyable
and equally different.




Troy 


Again, I'm not an expert (no one is), but I do know my craft well enough
to say that these beers differed in many ways.

As I understand it (and practice it), extract is generally added as the wort
comes to a boil. Wouldn't the very hot temperatures denature the enzymes
immediately and prevent any conversion of starches to sugars.  Would such
extracts have to be added while the temperatures are below 160F and rested
there (if so, how long)?

I asked this some months back and the concensus was that the yeast at the
bottom of the bottle is merely dormant and stays that way for a long time
(many monhts).  It can be restarted even a year after bottling.

I suggest the following (for small number of bottles) based on personal
experience: pack the bottles in a small cardboard box tightly with styrofoam
and bubble wrap.  Tape this box shut and seal it into a large plastic bag
(in case of rupture).  Shake the box; if you hear glass clinking then repack
it.  Pack this small box in a much larger box with lots of styrofoam pellets
all around each side of the smaller box.  The bigger box and styrofoam
doesn't add that much to the cost as long as you stay within the limits set
by shipper.  If you do it right, then you should hear no glass clinking or
fluid sloshing. Don't write anything on the outside that is not obviously
required to get the package to it's destination.

There have been several posts on hops and photoperiodism.  I work in
ornamental horticulture and manipulation of photoperiodism is a tool that we
use extensively. 


I'm not familiar with photoperiodism in hops.  With the plants that I deal
with, you can manipulate the photoperiod with incandescent lamps (60W light
bulbs) turned on for some time (4 hours?) during the middle of the night.
This tricks the plants into getting the needed stimulus.  Perhaps the same
can work with hops; but how many lights, how far from the plant, how much of
the night? - I don't know.
