I wish CO2 supersaturation was as transitory as you believe.  My beers
suffered from this problem for a number of years, 85 batches to be exact.
Please refer to my letter in BT, Sept/Oct 1996, pg. 14, Trouble With
Trubless Fermentations. My remedy was to leave the trub in all my worts,
including lagers, but I could not understand why other home brewers were
able to successfully ferment trubless worts while I couldn't. But the fact
was that all my ferments became stuck due to CO2 saturation which then
inhibited the normal operation of the yeast. Prior to leaving the trub in, I
had been using a specific brand of yeast nutrient to provide nucleation
sites so the CO2 could come out of solution. I didn't realize this at first,
I just knew it worked and I supposed that the yeast needed nutrients. But,
now I know that all-grain wort is not nutrient deficient. Neither would
nutrient cause the stuck-ferment wort to instantly foam over. No, it was the
multitude of nucleation sites suddenly provided by only that specific brand
of nutrient that afforded the CO2 the opportunity to finally come out of the
supersaturated wort in a most explosively dramatic way. I added small
amounts of the nutrient every couple days so the foaming would not be TOO
explosive. This problem plagued me from my first all-grain batch so I didn't
know how the fermentation should proceed normally; working in relative
isolation at the time, I supposed it was just an ornery quirk of all-grain
brewing. It wasn't until my 85th batch that I gently swirled the carboy and
had it blow the air lock off and foam all over for several minutes that I
realized it was CO2 saturation.
Leaving the trub in the wort has helped but has not been the complete
solution. Others have suggested DE or SS scrubs in the beer; I believe from
some of my experiments that these remedies will work but I'm looking in a
different direction.  I am still in the midst of a number of experiments to
find a definitive answer and I'm starting to get a handle on it, finally.
As Dave wrote, it may turn out to be a very local condition, but who knows
how many others with stuck ferments caused by CO2 saturation have
unwittingly developed this local condition in their brewery.  Sorry, I don't
want to say more than that until I'm sure about it; I already claimed
leaving trub in the wort to be the answer and had to back away from that claim.


CO2 Saturation is Alive and Well, for now. . .

Lee,
  I've heard of two ways and have tried one.  Either will work only if
you're doing "intermediate brewing", using some specialty grains in along
w/ the malt extract.
  WYeast makes a "Scottish Ale" yeast that helps to impart the taste you're
looking for.  I used that with 5lb. DME, 1lb. crystal malt, and 1/4lb.
toasted (350 degrees F, 10 minutes before crushing) malt.  It turned out
nicely.
  I've also been told you can achieve the same effect by using peat-smoked
malt.  Someone else is going to have to help as to where you can find it.
  Good Luck!

i use a Whitbread dry yeast and had a similar experience to Tim, i.e. 
rapid fermentation of a 1050 brew down to 1020 and no further action, 
even though I waited another week. I bottled it and it was a fine , if a 
bit sweet, ale. Subsequent to this I acid washed the yeast and now it 
ferments down to 1008 with out any problems. The only other change was 
that I switched to aerating the wort with pure oxygen. Maybe we're back 
to insufficient wort aeration. Regards to all and please note my new

Subject: Insulation for 15 gallon sanke kegs


A local homebrew supply owner mentioned to me that it would be nice 
to come up with some way of insulating the Sabco sparge/mash/boil 
kettles.  I just remembered about some stuff, called FIBERFRAX, which 
might do the job.  It is available through an aviation supply catalog 
and would not cost very much. 


The catalog description is as follows:  "Fiberfrax is a new material 
made from washed ceramic fibers with binders added to form a 
lightweight, flexible asbestos-free insulation.  Withstands 
temperatures to 2300 degrees F (two thousand three hundred).  
Avaiable in 24 inch wide rolls in 1/16 and 1/8 inch thicknesses."  (I 
have used Fiberfrax to protect brake lines from the heat of brake 
linnings and rotors and have had very good success).


Fiberfrax is white and is kind of like a stiff sheet of felt.  It can 
be easily shaped or folded.  A 24 inch width of material will reach 
from the bottom of a keg up to the handles.  A length of 
approximately 4 and one half feet would be required to wrap the 
circumference of the keg.  It could be held in place by wrapping with 
stainless steel safety wire or maybe even chicken wire.  


If the fiberfrax does not insulate as much as you would like, it 
would at least allow you to use other insulating methods over top of 
it, which wouldn't otherwise work against the bare kettle (ie: water 
heater jacket).


Materials avaiable from: 
Aircraft Spruce and Specialty Co.

Greetings


While preparing to brew this morning I let my mind wander and it seems =
to have paid off.  I was standing there with the rolling pin in my hand =
wondering why I hadn't had the roasted barley for my impending milk =
stout crushed at the homebrew store.  An idea popped into my head and =
off I went to scale the shelves in my garage in search of my prize.  =
Finally on the top shelf, I found it - my old Atlas pasta machine.  I =
blew the dust off of it and went to work.=20


The unit has two steel rollers designed to roll pasta dough smooth and =
flat.  It's made entirely of chromed steel and has a detachable motor.  =
First step was roughing up the rollers so they would grip the grain and =
full it through.  I dug out a small file and had accomplished my task in =
about 5 minutes.  Time for a test run.


I put a piece of foil on the counter to catch anything I crushed and =
fired it up.  I grabbed a handfull of roasted barley and dropped on the =
rollers.  One flick of the switch and Bingo! It was coming out the other =
side with the husk intact and the kernel split.  I was definitely on to =
something.


I removed the base plate, cut a whole in the top of an old bucket and =
bolted the roller assembly in place.  The only thing left was a hopper =
for the top of the unit - an old coffee can cut down the center and a =
slit in the middle and I'm now the proud owner of a roller mill.  Total =
time invested was about 45 minutes.


I took my half pound of roasted barley dumped it in the hopper, flicked =
the switch and 30 seconds later, it was all very nicely crushed.  In the =
immortal words of beer advocate Homer J. Simpson, "Woo Hoo."


May your lapses into lucidity go as well for you as this one did for me. =
 Now, back to my pint of alt.

Subject: Affordable Conical Fermenter


To the distinguished collective:
        I recently purchased  the "Affordable Conical Fermenter",
advertised in Zymurgy and probably other places, and attempted my first
batch therein. The batch was an extract ale, using 1 oz of hop pellets
for the boil, 1/2 oz pellets for flavor, 1 oz whole hops for aroma and a
teaspoon Irish moss. I cooled the wort to about 75 degrees with an
immersion cooler and then transferred  to the conical fermenter using a
'deep fryer' basket as a hop back and sieve type strainer in the funnel,
which removed a lot of solid stuff. I immediately pitched the yeast. 
After several hours, I had the expected fairly deep layer of trub in the
bottom of the cone, and was able to remove some of it by barely opening
the valve. I then opened the valve fully and got an additional small
amount, followed by thin wort, as if the wort had 'punched'  through the
layer of trub. Several more attempts with the valve only partially open
helped, but I was never able to remove a satisfactory amount of trub.
After the primary fermentation slowed I racked to a glass carboy and
reverted to my old method. The conical concept is obviously a good one,
but my first batch was not what I had hoped for, i.e. quick clean trub
removal and no racking.


My Question:  Has anyone had experience with the Affordable Conical
Fermenter, and if so do you have any advice on how to get the best
results, especially with regard to trub removal. Any information would be
greatly appreciated. Response by private e-mail or Digest posting will be
fine.

A few weeks ago, my wife went to our local liquor store to pick up a coup=

there, she also picked up a six of Two Dogs Lemon Brew.
"Hey!" she says, "I like this!, Can you brew something like this?"  I tak=

"Hmmm....Let me see what I can throw together" I answer.  So I did just
that, I threw something together and it came out damned good...It's not
beer, but hey!, it's quick and easy to make.  Here's the reciepe:


2lbs Lite DME
1lb Corn Sugar
3lbs Honey
6 cans Frozen Lemonade Concentrate


Boil 1.5 gallons of water. Add the DME and sugar. Boil for 10 minutes. Ad=
d
honey, boil for 1 minute.  Chill wort and dilute to 5 gallons. Pitch yeas=
t
(I used my crappy, emergency dry yeast, I'm sure it doesn't matter)
Ferment for 7 to 10 days in primary.
Add Frozen Lemonade Concentrate to secondary and rack from primary.  Let
sit another 5 days.
I kegged this batch and forced carbonated it.
My wife really  loves it, and I must admit,  it's really refreshing on a
hot summer day!  Try it and let me know what you think.

Subject: Bottle pasteurisation


The commercial breweries that I have toured out here (In South Africa &
Namibia) all use bottle pasteurisation of the finished product.  The
bottled of gassed beer is passed through showers of water at differing
temps.  The conveyer takes the beer through a warming shower and then
through a pasteurising heat shower and finaly a cooling shower, all moving
reasonably slowly.  They don,t seem to have many damaged bottles from this
process and I think that it is because nothing happens suddenly.  I
wouldn't personally drop a primed bottle of beer into boilling water for
fear of an explosion, besides, I think that pasteurising takes place at
about 72 C for 20 minutes or so.

Phail.

Bottle pastuerization is a common industrial brewing practice in which beer
is held in its package at 60C for about 20 minutes (it takes much longer to
get to 20C and cool again). According to Boyle-Charles' Law pV/T = constant
where T is measured in degrees absolute (K) where 0K is -273C.  So the
increase in CO2 pressure at 60C is only 1.22 times the pressure at 0C. So,
put the bottles in 20C water and raise temp to 60C over 10 minutes and the
beer wil reach 60C in about 20 minutes, hold 15-20 minutes, cool in 40C
water for 5-10 minutes, 20C water for5-10 minutes, then tap water. This will
accumulate about 8 PU. (Pasteurization Units-Yes, they metricated the poor
bugger!) The bottle will take it, but will your beer?


This has flavour disadvantages over "flash" pastuerization in which a stream
of beer is held at 72-75C for a few seconds in a heat exchanger (=10PU).
Luckily, with pastuerization, killing power doesn't equal cooking power(temp
X time), so this flavour effect is minimal. However flash pastuerisation
doesn't sterilise the bottle and cap and bottling machine, neither does
sterile filtering (at nominal filter opening = 0.2 um), which can also strip
some flavour. It is a toss up which is flavour preferable, filtering is
cheaper! (though sometimes a dirty word-CAMRA!)
The modern approach to the problem of package sterility is to purge air from
the bottle with steam for about 1.5 seconds just before sealing at the
filter head for counterpressure filling. This doesn't heat the bottle
significantly (even noticibly) and kills all microbes and removes O2. This
is applied to caps as well. This is a cheap modification to old
counterpressure bottling equipment for lower O2 levels in the
bottle.(cheaper than double pre-evacuation)
In a cool climate, I would just "polish filter" at 5um and keep the beer
cool, if you watch your sanitation and keep the pH down, bacteria take years
to get a hold. Belgian commercial breweries have little problem with bottle
conditioned beer coming all the way to Australia (remember India Pale Ale
went to India in a sailboat in wooden kegs). In fact these beers arrive in
much better shape here in Australia than sterile beers because yeast is a
powerful metabolic reducer and fair oxygen scavenger. If this can be done,
why not a small residue of invisible yeast in a non-bottle conditioned beer?
("non-conditioned" because no significant fermentation takes place). Sierra
Nevada Brewing do this a bit more to create a slight layer of yeast that
doesn't cause haze problems, but gives the impression of a natural, bottle
conditioned beer, and preserves it. In Australia, Coopers put bottle
conditioned beer on the back of a truck and send it across 2000k of desert
to Darwin! Probably pasteurized on the way? 


A microbrewer can control the treatment of their beer by self-distributing.
If the market is local, the costs are about the same as using a commercial
distributor with some marketing advantages. Redhook Brewing does this, using
refrigerated trucks, but it is illegal in some US states to self distribute,
France?


My advice Arnaud?
1/ Filter to 5um after cold conditioning ales for a week (or use finings).
Some yeast will remain.
2/ Steam sterilise bottles and caps for 1.5 seconds.
3/ Buy a couple of old refrigerated milk delivery trucks and self
distribute. Get to know your retailers and stress that this is a "live"
fresh beer, something special to be treated with care.(insert appropriate
French ambience here)
4/ Shelf life should be several months if all other stability processes are
carried out. (FAN/polyphenol/lipid/pH control, & O2 exclusion from mash,
whirlpool and packaging)(BTW steam blanketing works for O2 exclusion in mash
and whirlpool prosesses too)

HBDers,
Since Roy R. Rimmele is interetsed in home beer engines, I'll add some new info.
I just heard.


My local HB store, informs me that galley pumps used in motorboats are perfect
to adapt as a beer engine.  I guess they have the same design of pulling liquid

Subject:  Mashout-


In Domenick Venezia's post on Mashout he mentioned a three step sparge
process that I use.  A few years back I visited a couple of small
breweries and several of the highland Scotch distilleries.  In each they
produced their beer (distillers just forget the hops), in a large lauter
tun which had folding arms to stir the mash and a couple of very large
water heaters on an upper level (all looked very similar so I assumed were
produced by the same outfit).  Following the mash schedule they would run
in 170F water for the first sparge run, then pump this off through a
chiller to the fermentation tanks, the second sparge was at a slightly
higher temperature of 180F, and the gravity was dropping rapidly (like
about 1.010 as I remember), then they did a very rapid final sparge at
about 190 to get every last bit of sugar out of the mash.  This was about
1.005 or so and was retained by pumping up to the holding tank, and while
the next batch was mashed the water in the bulk tank cooled to about 170F
where the process started again. 


I adopted the same three step system for my homebrewing setup, and I mash
out by adding a small amount of simmering water to the mash to raise the
temperature to 170F or so, then blend more of the simmering water with
cold to make a 180F batch, which I sparge through, followed by another
shot of the simmering water. 


I use a very short mash schedule (50-60 min.), and recirculate the first
gallon or so of mash water, until the mash sets and the wort runs clear.
Then I let the water level reach the grain bed, and begin adding the 180F
water at that point.  When the flow reduces and the bed begins to settle I
add the 190F water and often I find that the gravity of the run off will
take a jump.  Tannins and silicates so far haven't been a problem with
this technique, and I get excellent extraction rates. 


I am not sure if it is a Scottish thing to get every last gram of sugar
from the mash, I was told that it aided in extracting all of the sugars
from the mash and increasing the final gravity without over dillution of
the wort.  The owner and distiller at Glengoyne used this method and spent
a long time covering his methods with me, he convinced me, and I have
stuck with it.  The microbrewery I visited was run by a couple of former
distillery employees who may simply have used the same equipment and
techniques by habit.  But who is to argue with good booze and beer.  As a
final note, on that same trip at a brewery somewhere in the UK one bit of
advice I remembered was that the pH and mash temps were critical to
maintaining the malt character and mouth feel of the finished beer. Seems
that they used higher temps (like about 155-158F) for short periods of
time, at a pH of about 5.8.  This they explained was to enhance the
activity of the enzymes good at eating smaller sugars while leaving the
longer chain sugars for your beer.

Just wanted to follow-up on the lacto infestation problems I was 
worried about.  A few people wrote to me stating that they had
done lacto ferments many times and they had not experienced 
problems removing the lacto cultures from their equipment using
iodophor or bleach.  A couple of people noted that they wouldn't
trust this to be the case with plastic or rubber though, and
one person mentioned that he had experienced trouble with the
pediococcus (sp?) bacteria being a resilient beastie.  I think
what initially caused my concern was some second-hand information
I was given, and also a note in a recent article in Zymurgy about
weisse beers where they mentioned it was desirable to maintain
a second fermentation set-up for lacto ferments.  As usual, it's
best to be informed and make your own decisions, but I trust the
folks here on the HBD more than I do Zymurgy.  Then again, I'm
still going to sour mash rather than try to initiate a mixed
lacto-yeast fermentation.

Subject: Bavarian Weizen and temp. rests


HBDers,
I seem to recall a few months back some controversy over the 122F temp. rest vs.
the 135F rest.  Something about the 122F rest ruining the head or something?


Anyway, if I'm making a weizen with the standard 60/40 split of readily availabl
e U.S. pale and Weyermann german wheat malt,  what would be the LEAST
troublesome mash schedule to use, but still get a decent product?  I believe the
wheat needs some sort of protein rest, but am confused as to what's optimal.  I
don't wanna decoct and I only wanna do the temp. rests that are NEEDED for this
type of malt.


Are all these 40/50/60/etc./etc. programs overkill when using the  highly modifi
ed malts we can all get?

Subject: Re: Decoction Theories Put To Test 




Rob Kienle discussed an alternative method of decoction mashing.  I
agree with Rob about decoctions as a way to manage temp. rests, but I
don't think our technology gives us much of an advantage.  As
homebrewers, our main advantage comes because we're not mashing such
large volumes and masses of grist.  A lot of the traditional methods
had to overcome the logistics of dealing with large volumes of
thermally challenged grain and water.


Anyway, I just wanted to comment that there is another way of playing
this decoction game if you're not bound to tradition.  The idea is to
perform a single decoction, but to do it as a mini-mash which you
start before your main mash.  This would pseudo-technically be called
an un-decoction I suppose.  Start with say 1/2 or 2/3 of your grain
bill and create a very thick mash, about 0.5 qt/lb.  Bring this
through your protein rests and sacc. rests, but *do not* start the
rest of your mash yet.  Before you're ready to boil your decoction,
dough in the rest of your mash to whatever temperature you like, and
use a very thin mash (the water from you mini un-decoction is mostly
going to get boiled off so you'll be adding pure grain back to the
mash tun).  Then you boil your un-decoction for however long you want
to park you "main mash" at whatever temperature you chose.
Afterwards, add the un-decoction to the "main mash" to hit your next
temp. rest, and proceed from there.


This method has two main advantages.  First, you have more control
over how much grain you are boiling, and hence have better control
over how much of a temperature increase you'll get when adding it to
the main mash.  The second benefit is that your main mash doesn't have
to sit at a single temperature for an extreme amount of time.  These
seem to be the two main complaints about decoction mashing.  The other
complaint is that decoctions take a long time.  Just think about those
big, buxom, blonde German women sweating over a wooden paddle,
stirring the hot mash in days of yore.  That might help pass the time.
Those who don't find sweaty buxom women attractive will have to find
their own motivation.  Sorry.

No, no, no. "Fly sparging" is not in reference to insects. It's a '70s 
throwback, meaning to sparge while wearing bell-bottomed polyester pants, 
platform shoes, and at least three large gold medallions. This is related

Greetings


I am ending a long lurk mode with this query for all the mechanical 
types out there. I own a Schmidling MaltMill, which I would like to 
motorize. Towards this end, I have acquired a Dayton model 4Z613 
motor. The specifications are as follows:


1/25 input motor hp
F/L torque: 12 in/lbs
full load rpm: 154


The motor requires an external capacitor, which I am tracking down 
now. 


Does this motor have the guts to power a MM? I am planning a belt
