Hello friends,


I've seen a couple of post to Hardpipes (what kind of a handle is
Hardpipes?!) about using soappy water to detect co2 leaks around the
regulator. Well if your not excited about soapping your co2 rig down,
don't. Use about a foot of 3/8" tubing as a stethoscope. Stick it in
your ear and listen around the connections. Be sure to go all the way
around, a very small leak has a very small 'voice'. Works great.
 
Cheers,

Subject: effect of CO2 on yeast


from Dave,


>I would like to hear more facts from that article in BT or Zymurgy. Anyone
care to comment
on examples of fermentation under CO2 pressure? 


OK. I'll bite. Except I'll reference


(1) GJ. Arcay-Ledezma and JC Slaughter.
"The response of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae to fermentation under carbon
dioxide pressure"
Journal of the Institute of Brewing. V90. pp81-84. 1984.
(2) RS. Renger et al.
The formation of esters and higher alcohols during brewery fermentation;
the effect of carbon dioxide pressure". JIB. V98. pp509-513. 1992.
 
At pressures up to 0.2 ATM, CO2 stimulates yeast growth, generally thought
to be because of its use as a substrate in carboxylation reactions.
0.3 - 0.5 ATM, CO2 acts as an inhibitor, especially in the tricarboxylic
cycle (part of respiration), not that this is generally relevant in real
wort fermentations.
Alcohol production is unaffected up to 4 ATM.
2.5 - 3.0 ATM CO2 is said to prevent cell division completely.
Brewery fermentations depend upon a certain amount of cell growth so are
unlikely to function above 2 ATM, depending upon the exact temperature.
Within the zone 0-2ATM there is little effect of CO2 on fermentation rate
*per cell*, although at the upper end a reduction in growth rate occurs,
leading to an extension in the time required to reach a given level of
attenuation.


"The influence of the size and geometry of brewery fermentation vessels on
beer flavour and aroma is generally attributed to carbon dioxide pressure."
(2)


Fermentations with CO2 pressure maintained at 2 ATM show prolonged
fermentation times, with reduced final ester and higher alcohols. Reduced
yeast biomass is another feature, as is higher final pH. VDKs and
precursors are in general reduced with lager yeast and increased with ale
yeast (variable results). Commercially, it is common to ferment at higher
temperatures to accelerate fermentation, and with applied CO2 pressure, to
reduce fermentation byproducts.


Application of 2ATM CO2 at 16C decreases the fermentation rate by
approximately 40%. Under the same conditions, daily agitation increases
fermentation rate by 10%. "The total yeast crop was unaffected by the
resuspension treatment so it seems that the faster fermentation under this
condition must be due to improved mixing of yeast and fermentation
medium".(1).


Under static conditions, the CO2 pressure in a homebrewery fermenter is 1
ATM. This is significantly less than the 2 ATM said to retard yeast growth.
There *must* be a higher CO2 pressure than 1 ATM during the fermentation to
cause bubble formation - the more nucleation sites there are, the lower
this difference will be. In commercial situations (big), the fermenter
height will be a significant factor in contribution to CO2 pressure (as
already posted).


My money goes on more CO2 bubbles causing better mixing, rather than CO2
"toxicity" as such, at least on homebrew scales.


Andy.

Subject: fill & carbonation (again) ...


re fill level vs carbonation ...


David Burleys analysis a few weeks back makes a lot of sense - and I
suspect that some residual priming sugar in the overfilled bottles is
not fermented (at least not as quickly) as in underfilled bottles.  Just
a guess right now tho'.


Aaron Kelleys' comments were quickly, and correctly ripped to shreds
here. But in case it was missed - the notion that water freely migrates
across yeast cell walls is nonsense.  The tough part about being a
single celled creature is keeping the high concentrations of 'good'
soluables in, and the water out.  A classic experiment is to drop a bit
of lysozyme enzyme to a cell slide and watch the cells absorb water and
burst as the enzymes breaks down the polysaccharides in the cell wall. 
Did I mention that biologists are cruel people ?


AlK asks about the CO2 production in the aerobic vs anaerobic metabolism
of glucose ....  Jeff's math is indeed correct.  In anaerobic (normal)
fermentation you get 2 mols of CO2 per mol of glucose.  In aerobic
fermentation you get 6 mols of CO2 per mol of glucose, *but* you use 6
mols of O2 to accomplish this and so end up with the same amount of
gas.  In any case even a 2/3rds bottle fill with air vs an inert gas
will not add enough oxygen to make more than about a 6% difference in
the amount of CO2 produced.  The included oxygen, if used for yeast
respiration, is not the answer to this puzzle.


Yeast do react to hydrostatic pressure, tho a good lit search would be
necessary to find the critical data -(I'm still studying phenols at the
moment).


I don't understand Dave Whitmans comment on yeast suspension as a
colloid nor the concept of the "zeta potential".  Can you explain Dave ?


Dave Burley wrote ...
>I can explain all of the observations, so far,
>simply by postulating premature flocculation of the yeast - which is a
>well-recognized phenomenon among ale yeasts, especially.


Flocculation doesn't necessarily mean the fermentation ceases.  Also my
underfill=overcarbonation experiment was performed with lager yeast,
Wy2308 I believe.  In any case you'll need to explain the reason for the
(seemingly consistant) differential flocculation with respect to bottle
fill level to make this one fly - tho' there are a lot of good potential
reasons to choose from IMO.  Oxygen might allow for some cell membrane
growth (sterol+ergosterol production) which could prevent flocculation. 
The hydrostatic pressure increase might impact cell membrane properties,
that in turn might effect flocculation.  Simple sugars (like a priming
addition) are known to disperse flocs, but perhaps oxygen is needed. 
Many possibilities.

Subject: Malts and  Re: Decoction Theories Put To Test


Rob Kienle writes about his recent decoctions and uses a 122F=50C rest
temperature for break and haze reduction in his altbeir.  I find that a
40C/58C/70C schedule with Durst malts produce beers of great clarity -
no haze - YMMV.


The "1997 Brewers' Market Guide" from the publishers of Brewing
Techniques is out.  The section on malt technical specifications however
shows that no specs or very vague ranges are given for many parameters
in this table.  I realize that there is no point in listing diastatic
power of crystal malt, but wouldn't you think that every pils and pale
(ale) malt would list diastatic power ?  Wouldn't you think that
screening(size assortment) information would also be available for most
pale/pils malts ?  SNR ?


I don't know whether to blame BT/New Wine Press or the maltsters for the
omissions, but this table would be much more useful if there were more
comparable numbers for the various malts.

I have been keging about 40-50 % of my beer for about a year or so now.  I
keep my kegs warm for the same reasons you do, cash flow.  


Have you ever heard of a jocky-box?  They work pretty good.  This is what I
use to cool my kegged beer.  I have not had a problem with excessive
foaming, but you can adjust keg pressure for both tapping and dissolving to
stop foaming.


First I dissolve CO2 at about 25 lbs., Adjust this to your desired
carbonation level.
I have a beer line going into a cooler which attaches to 30 feet of copper
coil, Stainless would be better.  I mounted a Tap Spicket on the cooler. 
Then I fill the cooler with ice and water.  There you have it cooled beer
from a warm keg.  


A couple of things to keep in mind.
         
        1)        The tap hose and copper coil must be the same Inside diameter,
or get         smaller as you progress to the spicket.  If you get larger you
create a beer         engine, i.e. major foam.  Also make sure the way you attach
the coil to the         hose does not change diameter for even the shortest
distance.


         2) With 30 feet of coil you will have to keep about 25-30 lbs of
presure to get a         good flow.  This is no big deal because you need this
much pressure to get         enough dissolved CO2 at room temp.


Hope I was able to help, with all these ramblings.

And he is right, I did my calculations at 1 volume of CO2 in which case the
increased solubility of CO2 at higher pressures exactly matches the decrease
in solubility at higher temperatures that produce the higher presssure. In
this case Boyle's is a very good approximation. I failed to think it through
to other cases. Apologies to Spencer Thomas whom I refuted on this point
offline.


I still don't think pasteurization is an explosion problem as pressure
vessel regulations require a large margin of safety and this is common
practice commercially, and bottles are made for "them", not "us".

HBD-
A newly converted neighbor (to home brewing) has entered the fold.  As his
shepherd/guide/beer myth debunker, my first task is to procure for him a Bells
Amber Ale clone extract recipe.  Anybody got one?  I do know a guy who was the
college roommate of the present assistant brewer at Kalamazoo Brewing CO.
I guess this guy wandered into the brewery carrying a case of his own
home-brew, and when questioned by a secretary said "Uh..delivery for Mr.
Bell.."  The secretary let him into Bells office, he dropped off his beer with
a resume, and was hired the next week.  Cool, huh?
 
Concerning the motorize your own malt mill thread, I bought an Italian grain
mill intended for gelatinizing wheat grains and whatnot (the users manual
contends that the heat generated by rolling the grains gelatinizes the grain
on the fly).  It has three rollers (about four inches across) two above the
one, and is somewhat adjustable. I set it in-between markings for a first pass
then set in at one of it's fixed settings for a second pass, and it takes
about an hour to grind 12 pounds of grain to a good crush. I motorized it with
a 12 volt motor through a step down gear box that turns the mill about as fast
as you could turn it (unloaded) by hand. I don't know other particulars about
the motor, as an electrical engineer buddy whom I also converted to
home brewing "procured" the motor for me at no charge (to me). The mill, a
"Marga" I believe, cost $50 at a local HB shop. If the third roller was
independently adjustable (working on it) it could be a three roller single
pass malt mill.
 
Keith Roysters' experiment for fill level vs. carbonation sounds like trying.
I'll try it on the barley wine I have in the secondary right now. I'll let you
know in a few years.
 
As an aside, a month after transferring the barley wine to the secondary (on
top of Champagne yeast) I siphoned off one gallon onto 12 ounces of
raspberries to test a previous theory submitted here (don't remember who)
regarding fruits working better in thicker, darker brews.  Once again, let you
know in a few years.

Dear Friends,


John Schnupp wrote about using soap solutions for leak detection, and
mentioned both a product called Snoop and child's soap bubbles. For
what it's worth, I've used both in my labwork over the years (we
often run various mixes of hydrogen, argon, CO2, O2, and CO in our
experiments) and ordinary soap bubbles from the toy aisle at your
favorite grocery work just as well as Snoop.  Cheaper too, and a lot
easier to get, I'd imagine?  Anyway, just confirming John's surmise
that they work great.


Dave Thomson asked about replacing the push-valve in his Igloo. 
When I got going again here after my recent relocation, I had an
Igloo to work with as well.  Mine just has a drain hole at one end,
not a valve.  It turns out that the ID of that hole is a perfect
friction-fit with the OD of the tubing I have on hand, so what I did
was just slide the tubing through the hole (had to work at it for
about 10 min-- *very* snug fit), attach the end inside the cooler to
my copper manifold (another good press-fit), and put a plastic
hose-clip on the outside end to regulate the outflow.  Bingo,
instant mash/lauter tun.  So, it may be that you need not have to
replace the valve with anything else at all. 


Cheers,

Badger asks about expanded SUDS databases fro malts & hops:


"Has anyone expanded the malt and extracts databases?  could i get pointers

Check out my web page (URL in sig line below).  I added all the malts from
the Zymurgy Great Grain Issue (1995) and all the hops data I could find from
a number of sources.  Simply download and replace your SIDSHOP.DBF and
SUDSMALT.DBF files.  **WARNING**:  The way SUDS deals with the database, if
an existing recipe calls for something that isn't in the database anymore
(whihc will happen after replacing the old databases), the recipe will end up
with screwy numbers for color & gravity.  You will have to convert all of
your old recipes' malt & hops bills if you use the new database.  Another
option would be to manually edit the new database to include all of the old
offerings.  This will result in some duplication of items, with slightly
different names, but will make the databases backward compatible with your
old recipes.

Subject: Strawberries


Beers to All,


Being new to homebrewing (two years) and especially new to the Digest 
(third issue) my question may have gone before and I was just not around 
for it.  If so, please forgive . . . if, not please help . . . 
even so, please help, any road!


I am considering a batch of brew with strawberries (my all-time favorite 
fruit).  I have read recipes with just about every other kind of fruit 
(and nut) but, alias, no strawberries.  


Do I just brew a batch as usual and add the berries? . . .  or, is there 
something special I need to do? . . . or, should I just forget the whole 
thing and buy a (ugh) Bud?  I am thinking along the lines of a wheat 
beer, or maybe a honey wheat beer . . . or is there something else that 
may go better with strawberries?


Any input would be greatly appreciated.  Private replies are welcome 
(will save me the humiliation of being publicly flogged for repeating 
questions).  Thanks in advance.

Martin,


I have a used GE gear motor to drive my MaltMill.  It has 30 in lb torque, 
and turns at 154 RPM.  It does just fine with the MaltMill.  I've been using 
it for a good while with no problems at all.  You could get a beefier motor, 
but I don't think you need it.  Not sure why JS did not have success with a 
motor with 2X the torque of mine.

I called it a Gueuze because of the Lactic /Sauerkraut aroma that was
obvious in the bottle I tasted.  I assumed it was a Gueuze style imitator=


with lots of young beer blended in.  Remember, however,  it had been give=

All declare that it is a strong Belgian ale type ( like a double or tripp=

Subject: Miller and botulism


Steve Claussen posts David Miller's comment on the botulism thread:


Well, I was willing to give Miller a break for the little slip on
that odd concept he has of bottle conditioning, but I feel he has
made a number of potentially dangerous errors in his comments here:

What if botulinum is not included in "most?"  And inhibited doesn't mean
absolutely prevented from growing/producing toxin.

If the botulinum growth is slow and hasn't progressed very far (maybe
due to inhibition by hops?) one wouldn't expect any of these to be
noticed.  Anyway, not everything clouds the growth medium, causes
bubbles, or strange odors.


It doesn't take much botulinum growth to cause a problem.  I have here a
reference for producing one of the botulinum toxins (C1--the one I use).
The reference is FEMS Microbiology Letters 30:47.  They produce at least
25mg of purified toxin from a 600mL culture.  That's the size of a starter.
And don't forget that there must have been losses during purification.
25mg is on the order of 100,000-1,000,000 lethal doses of toxin.  In other
words, if they have grown only 0.01-0.1% of what these authors get in your
starter, you are dead (assuming dilution in the beer of 1/100 or less).
This also ignores the risk that growth might continue in the beer.

I think he misses the point of Tyndallization as well.  The steps must be
carried out according to the timing he first presents since you don't want
to allow any re-sporulation to occur (although I am not sure if that would
happen in anaerobic wort or not).

  OFFICE MEMO          hop balance                            Date:6/25/97


First some answers and then a question.
>About that iron in your well water--You might look into one of those Brita
Filters, or something equivalent, and use that for your brewing water.  There
was a post about those in a previous digest and I've tasted the water from a
Brita and think they are pretty good.


>Peat Taste--I used a 1/2# of peated malt in a scottish ale and it was much
different than a previous scottish ale (Alex's Scottish Ale from the Cats
Meow) which used Wyeast 1728 Scottish Ale yeast.  If you want a peaty or smoky
flavor in your scottish ale use the peated malt.  Alex's scottish ale was
quite good using 1728  but I wouldn't call it peaty/smoky if thats the flavor
you want.


>Update--My stout which I had posted some questions about previously seems to
be doing well after a month.  I had aerated it when I transfered it to the
secondary in an attempt to wake up the yeast and get away from the seemingly
stuck 1.040 SG.  It ended up at 1.035 from a starting 1.085 and is thick and
would have been sweet except for the 60 IBUs of hops which about balances it. 
So I guess I didn't ruin it but next time I will rely on pitching plenty of
yeast to start and if I get a high FG I'll just leave it alone.


Now for the question--Hop Balance?  Somewhere I saw a reference which gave a
ballpark figure for "hop balance".  It was a linear scale which made me wonder
because I thought bitterness was a non-linear function.  This one gave about 8
IBUs / 1.010 of starting gravity.  Why isn't final gravity factored in.  This
would give 36IBUs for a 1.040 OG beer but if that 1.040 OG beer attenuated 75%
in one case and 50% in another case, I would think that the 1.010 FG beer
would taste more bitter.  It would seem to me that a ballpark hop balance
figure would be non-linear, would take into account Final Gravity as well as
Initial gravity.  Any ideas or leads on a ballpark "hop balance" equation or
table.  Thanks,
   John Penn

Ideally, you should finish the keg quickly.  A way to cheat, that no
respectable CAMRA member would ever do (;^), is to:


1. vent the keg and leave the vent open,
2. connect the handpump,
3. serve the beer,
4. disconnect the hanpump,
5. purge the headspace with CO2,
6. close the vent, and
7. store the beer at 55F till the next drinking session.


Beer will keep quite long this way, but is time-consuming, non-traditional,
and wastes a lot of CO2.  <snip>


***
I wonder:


For a small capital investment and an hour or so of playing "plumber"; 
it should be possible to fit a secondary (low-pressure) regulator to 
your CO2 delivery line so that it delivers CO2 direct to your "corny 
keg" at atmospheric pressure (or only slightly higher than 
atmospheric).  Not enough pressure to force beer through your beer 
engine or force-carbonate your beer, but enough that you can draw off a 
beer and have the "airspace" filled immediately with CO2 rather than 
air (I guess that makes it CO2space).


LPG regulators are cheap from camping suppliers and deliver LPG at low 
pressure (I forget how much exactly - in the order of a couple of psi). 
 Try plumbing one of these into the CO2 line AFTER the main regulator 
(these LPG regulators are generally rated to 250 psi).  The better regs 
have a cap on top which can be removed to expose an adjustment screw.  
By unscrewing this slightly you can reduce the delivery pressure.


**How to adjust the delivery pressure**
Connect the inlet of your LPG reg to the outlet of your high-pressure 
CO2 reg, leaving the outlet of the LPG reg open to the air.  Turn your 
CO2 bottle on and CO2 will come out the LPG reg outlet. Unscrew the 
adjustment screw slowly until it **only just** stops delivering CO2 to 
atmosphere.  Now connect the outlet of the LPG reg to the "corny keg" 
via the appropriate delivery tube etc.


As soon as there is vacuum in the "corny keg", generated by your 
pouring off a creamy pint, CO2 will be delivered to replenish pressure.


**Warning**
If you adjust one of these regulators, it should not then be used for 
LPG until it has been profesionally re-adjusted to deliver the correct 
working pressure.


**Another warning***
This is not a traditional technique.  Nor is it endorsed by CAMRA, I 
suspect.  It should however save you time and CO2 once you have set it 
up, and seems to be a fair compromise for home use.


**Disclaimer**
I have not done this yet, so I can't step forward and guarantee the 
technique.  Actually, I haven't even started kegging yet.  I'm still 
saving my pennies to buy a kegging set-up.  But I plan to try this 
myself someday.


Can anyone pick holes in this plan ??

Subject: bottle baking




Those of you who have been on the HBD for a while may remember the
discussion of bottle baking we had last year.  The idea is to slowly
heat and cool the bottles in an oven at about 250F or so in order to
sanitize them before bottling.  I've been doing this since last
summer, and I've bottled over a dozen batches this way.  It is very
simple and convenient to do, and I'm not going to do it any longer.
The repeated heating and cooling fatigues the bottles too much in my
opinion.  The thicker bottles bear up better, but I'm even starting to
see fatigue damage in these.  This is leading to fractures while
baking, and also fatigue fractures when the bottles become carbonated
to high levels such as with wheat beer or Belgian ales (my favorites
natch.).  I know some of you will chime in and say you've been doing
it that way since 1906 and never had a problem, but I'm just reporting
what I've experienced.  I don't feel the risk of giving my friend or
relative a bottle that may later crack or worse is worth the
convenience, and I'm tired of worrying about it.  This is especially
the case since I don't think it's even a necessary step, because of
the pH and alcohol level of finished beer.

Subject: A simple approach to decoction mashing


Reviewing recent posts on decoction, we feel that some authors and 
homebrewers have discovered and developed advanced philosophies on 
decoction. -That's fine, one more fact that shows the infinite world 
of brewing. ON THE OTHER HAND HOWEVER, ONE MUST KEEP AN EYE ON 
TRADITIONAL ROOTS, OTHERWISE THINGS GET VERRY INVOLVED AND PREVENT 
HOMEBREWERS FROM USING DECOCTION TECHNIQUES.


In particular, people seem to worry about:
1) Low control over extended protein rests (head retention problems)
2) Force of starch conversion during decoction, leading to long 
schedules.
3) Fear of transition from 65C to 75C with a decoction that contains 
unconverted starch.


- --- ad 1) ---
No matter if using double or single decoction, our PR temp. is tuned 
to the degree of malt modification:


low (sometime back in the past) 50C
medium (now and then) 54C
high (as usual now -even here in central Europe) 57C


If using high modified malts and a double decoction schedule (triple 
makes not much sense for such malts), try PR at 55-57C *AND 
immediately* -without delay- take the first decoction. But although 
commercial brewers do it, I don't feel it makes much sense to 
step from 57C to 62-65C, using a decoction. -Having no possibility to 
independently heat the mashtun, I get more control over the proteins, 
if I mash in thick and step up with hot water into the 60-65C range. 
Later, taking a decoction to go from 62-65C to 75C, I could increase 
boil time to some extent to get almost the same flavor profile as 
with double decoction.


- --- ad 2) ---
Just bring the decoction to a boil at a rate of 1C/min instead of 
wasting time by resting and testing with jodine. You needn't force 
starch conversion in a decoction (expect some comments here)! 
Decoction will physically aid yield and starch conversion in an 
indirect way -by bringing starch into solution, so the enzymes in the 
remaining base mash can easily break it down.


Decoction varieties without conversion rests are well documented 
in both old and new literature. It should be noted however, that 
rests at 70C are not touched by the base mash either and the value of 
such a rest is far beyond converting starch only. But our quality 
control (competition results) shows, that this may not be necessary 
for every beerstyle.


- --- ad 3) ---
Keeping ---2)--- in mind, going to 75C with a normal-mash decoction 
(homogeneous, neither thin nor thick) will cause unconverted starch 
to be added to converted mash. But you needn't worry, due to 
a-Amylases there is much of enzymatic activity left at 75C. Although 
Amylases are degraded at their optimum working temperatures (70-75C 
for the alphas), enzymes are working fast in the range of 75C and 
complete kill of a-Amylase occurs at 80C. Problems may arise, if 
mashing in too high and the rate of enzyme degradation exceeds the 
rate of releasing them.


REFERENCES:


All German brewing scientists from Philipp Heiss in 1855, Emil 
Leyser in 1900 to  Dr. Narziss in 1995 have described and documented 
single and double decoction schedules involving normal or even 
thick-mash decoctions to go to 75C. Even the thin 3rd mash 
used in triple decoction is usually not free of grain (e.g. water / 
malt mass ratio = 5 / 1).


ADVANTAGES:


All we need is classical, traditional brewer's equipment:
1) A simple kettle without stirring engine, even direct heating with 
low control (e.g. wooden fire) could be used.
2) A well designed, insulated mash- / lautertun that can be built in 
many ways.


3) If you thrust physics and have some routine, the whole method 
consists of resting and heating. -Much time to read the HBD. 
Sometimes my wife doesn't even recognize that I'm brewing.

I would not be surprised if other states had a similar setup.  You might try

Subject: Ale yeast for Beck's clone 


Mark Johnson asked about what type of yeast to use to brew an ale that
tastes somewhat like a lager (Beck's) and mentioned that someone
recommended California Common.  If he meant California lager yeast
("steam") I would advise against it.  I tried the same thing using that
yeast (Wyeast, I believe) and fermented at 55 - 60 degrees, and the esters
were quite powerful.


I did the same thing using Wyeast 1338 European, and got really nice
results; clean and malty.


Another choice, although IMO second to the 1338, is Wyeast 1007.  This
gives a nice maltiness and a real "beery" nose, but has a slight ale like
complexity that I wasn't crazy about, which diminished with cold storage
for 3-4 weeks.


Come to think of it, cold storage (38 - 40 degrees F, in my case) really
smoothed out the 1338 beer also, and made it more lager-like.  I don't have
the refrigeration for large scale cold storage, so I just put a bunch of
bottles in the fridge for a few weeks and drink english style ales stored
at cellar temp. in the meantime.
