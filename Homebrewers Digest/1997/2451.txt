Subject: Re: colloids and zeta potential


Dave Whitman kindly and quickly responded to my query - tho' I think the
answer or perhaps my question missed the target.


> >I don't understand Dave Whitmans comment on yeast suspension as a

I think it comes from not defining terms unfamiliar to a general
technical audience, such as 'zeta potential'.  Imagine that you are
writing for Scientific American, not Annals of Physical Chemistry. My
other question is really why do you treat yeast in wort as a colloid - I
don't believe that yeast in wort share many properties with classic
colloidal suspensions. 
 ...
Definition Colloid (from the CRC): 
   "A phase dispersed to such a degree that surface forces become an
important factor in determining its properties.
   In general particles of colloidal dimensions are approximately 10
angstrom to 1 micron in size.  ..."


OK, I don't find this definition terribly useful either - but yeast
cells individually run about an order of magnitude above the upper size
limit stated (5 to 15 micron diameter for brewing yeast).  Further, many
yeast varieties will form cell aggregates with even larger dimensions. 
Some other reasons why yeast don't act like a classic colloidal
suspension are:


2/ Yeast, for reasons unknown, do not follow Stoke's Law in their
sedimentation.  Until such a basic discrepancy is adequately explained
any theory is suspect.
3/ Yeast become less flocculant in the presence of mannose and other
sugars.  Some become more flocculant when alcohol levels hit 3% w/v.
Some lager yeasts flocculate in the presence of glutamic and aspartic
amino acids. All require calcium ions to flocculate. All of these
factors are influx during fermentation.
4/ Increase in effective size might seem a likely source of
sedimentation, but according to M&BS, sedimentation of small (5 micron)
yeast cells readily occurs at a depth of 2 meters in 2-4 days. Most
bottom fermenting lager yeasts do not form multicell flocs or chains yet
sediment readily too.
6/ The Burns test for yeast sedimentation (M&BS references JIB #43,
1937) measures cell count near the wort surface over time.  Cell
concentration falls steadily over time, then at a time and concentration
characteristic of the particular yeast, the rate slows.
7/ Growing vs mature yeast cells have different cell surface properties
and so their ability to flocculate may vary widely with growth
conditions.


Obviously there are some great similarities between wort+yeast and
colloidal suspensions, but yeast in wort represents a dynamically
changing system where the wort environment and the yeast cell surface
properties are known to change and interact over time.

This all makes good sense, and corresponds with the charges on and
isoelectric point definitions for macro-ions such as proteins; however
I've still never seen this referred to as 'zeta potential'. No matter,
now I understand what you are saying.  One aspect that you didn't
mention is that small ions, salts in solution for example, have a
shielding effect on the attraction of charged macromolecules and yeast,
thus improving their colloidal stability and reducing sedimentation.
(Except that calcium ions are required for yeast flocculation - grrr). 
Debye-Huckel theory accounts for this E field distortion at least for
the simple spherically symmetric charge case.

There's really a bit more to it than net charge and zeta potential tho'.
The common milk protein beta-lactoglobulin has a pK=5.3 (isoelectric
point) so the zeta potential reaches zero at pH=5.3.  The net charge on
the protein may be zero, but that doesn't mean that the molecule doesn't
have regions of relatively higher and lower charge.  These charge
differences make for oddly polar molecule which accumulate and other
intermolecular forces such as Van der Waals force create the clumping
and precipitation of milk protein.

Well partly - actually positive particle A and negative particle B come
together forming a more-or-less neutral two particle system - and here
is where the 'blobbing' would stop.  Forming big blobs requires a
further explanation of charge distribution within the macromolecule and
other intermolecular forces for stability.

Very minor nit - but actually cold break is believed to be mostly a
flocculation of two protein fractions - one with an isoelectric point
around pK=6 and another with pK=3.9. At pH values between 3.9 and 6.0 
the two will attract and flocculate.  Phenols are more involved in the
hot break and especially in haze and cold storage (lager) sedimentation.

Check.  But do you have a figure for yeast isoelectric point ??  My
guess is that it must be well below pH=4 - No ??

>From some graphs in M&BS pH may drop from 5.7 to 4.4 for lagers and 5.2
to 4.0 for ales in the course of fermentation.  Might be enough.  Who
knows - the isoelectric point of yeast may well vary with growth and
wort conditions too.  I personally doubt that any wort which hasn't
passed thru a ~micron filter has so few nucleation sites as to build up
such a hugely excessive supersaturation of CO2. Surely the yeast must
act as nucleation sites eventually.  As someone recently pointed out, we
do use yeast to bottle carbonate and even overcarbonate beer.  How many
atmospheres of CO2 in a bottle fermented champagne, 6  or more ?  OTOH I
haven't any better explanation of Gary Knull's experience except to say
I'd love to see a detailed analysis of his water and wort - especially
the metal ions.

And in an offline discussion Jeremy Bergsman pointed out that I am not
distinguishing cell walls and cell membranes.  Cell walls are permeable
we agree.  Jeremy argues that cell membranes are water (and not salt)
permeable if I understand his POV correctly.  I don't understand why
cells have problems hydrating when placed in a medium which has lower
water activity that distiled water, but still high enough to maintain a
positive osmotic pressure from inside the cell to out.


In other words, placing cells in somewhat concentrated salt or sugar or
other non-toxic solution decreases (but not to zero) the pressure
forcing water into the intracellular space.  If water flows freely why
should this cause hydration problems for cells ? Their growth rates
decline.

Have keg will travel:  Frustrated by dry Southern counties that forced him
to forgo his favorite beverage, 1996 Appalachian Trail thru-hiker Mike
"Brew Hiker" Harper called upon his years of home-brewing experience.  By
the time he reached Virginia, Harper had procured a water bag, airlock,

Whisperlite <stoves> of his fellow hikers, he boiled dry malt extract, add
priming sugar, and strapped the key-encased concoction atop his pack, where
it fermented for several days at a time.  Altogether it weighed 16 pounds. 
"I did have to get rid of some things in order to carry it," Harper said. 
As for the taste, "Everyone seemed to like it, but you know how it is with

Sorry so long on the summary... I have been up in MI visiting the 'rents and
drinking Bell's. Thanks to all for the help.


Carbonator pumps are a positive diplacement rotary vane pump. They do not
require suction head, so are primerless. Temperature limit is ~150 F because
the vane is plastic. Suggestions for use: chiller recirc, drawing hot wort
thru chiller, or any transfer operation. Was told if pump works - no rebuild
required. Considered a heavy duty little pump with ability to draw liquids
long distances. Motors and couplings alone well worth the $20. Excellant
tinkering value for rest system too.


The dented kegs will make nice fermenters and a supply of spare parts.
Twisted bungs first rate poodle bombs for the 5 mutts next door. Oh well....


Dirty disconnects can be dismantled and cleaned. There is a slot on the top
that will accept a screwdriver to take them apart. Replacement gaskets can be
found. If too crudded up - more poodle bombs.

i have used belgian malts almost exclusively over the past 3 years or so, and
all the comments rob makes above strike a chord with my experiences.  i used to
wonder if i was the only one getting large quantities of trub in the primary,
particularly when infusion mashing.  i normally will get in excess of a gallon
of trub for a 5 gallon batch that doesn't use some sort of protein rest in 
the 120's or low 130's fahrenheit, even with dwc's "pale ale" malt, which 
has more in common with their pils malt in this respect (trub production)
than it does with british pale ale malts.


my rest mash starts at 131 and drops to 122 deg f while i'm decocting.  normally
this process takes nearly 2 hours before the decoction is ready to add back
to the rest mash, but none of my beers using this method 
have suffered from lack of head formation or retention.  i do not let the 
pulled decoction linger in the protein rest range after i get it to the 
stovetop.  it goes straight to 151 - 158, depending on style.   maybe when i
change to different malts my results will be different, but i'm willing to 
use what has succeeded in the past until it fails me.


speaking of changing malts, i would like to use some imported malts other than
dwc this year, but i've moved to southern maryland.  who's got a good source
for bulk malt (i'll probably need ~150 pounds of bulk - 3 sacks) near to 
southern maryland? i'm thinking mostly of durst and/or weyermann, and a good
british pale ale malt.


i have noticed also that decoction mashing will decrease the trub,
particularly if an effort is made to prevent the "protein sludge" at the top 
of the lauter tun from washing into the runoff to the kettle. because of this,
i doubt i will ever try "batch sparging" when decocting, although "Superfly" 
sparging does seem appropriate for malt liquor. 


regarding rob's comment about "fluffy" trub, i have had this also, and i 
always document the "fluffiness" or "fineness" of the trub i observe.  the only
correlation i've drawn is that it seems like the darker the beer and the 
lower the ph of the mash (and thus, wort), the "finer" the trub is.  
i get really fluffy, coarse trub in pale lagers where i'm mashing in .2 to .5 
ph units higher than the darker beers.  it also seems that the finer the trub,
the more problems i have with head retention.  my very dark porters and
stouts have, in the past, poured like coca-cola.  review of my notes always
turns up the phrase "very fine trub in bottom of primary".

From: Luke.L.Morris`at`woodside.com.au
Subject: I was wrong ! : LPG & CO2 regs


I accept Jason Henning's criticism of my suggestion to use an LPG 
regulator to deliver CO2 (at about atmospheric pressure to a "corny 
keg", allowing a beer engine to be used without needing to draw air 
into the keg's airspace).


You are quite right that I should not be advocating this.  A 
low-pressure CO2 reg is the correct solution.  The difference in price 
will no doubt be only a few dollars.


I maintain that my proposal for a low-pressure regulator delivering 
low-pressure CO2 to the headspace of the "corny keg" would allow the 
beer engine to be used without drawing air into the keg (*see below) 
and without artificially carbonating the beer.


To *accurately* control delivery pressure from the cylinder down to 
almost atmospheric, you will need to use a two-stage regulator  
(dedicated 2-stage regs = $$$ from my experience), or put a 
low-pressure regulator after your existing CO2 reg (as I described, but 
use a reg recommended for CO2, not LPG !).  Generally speaking, the 
single-stage high-pressure reg affixed to your cylinder will not be 
sensitive enough to control pressure down from 1000+ psi to atmospheric 
reliably.  Generally speaking, regs with a bigger circumference are 
more sensitive due to their larger diaphragm area.


>The only saving grace about this
>set-up was the lp regulator was after the co2 regulator.


I did point out that these LPG regs are rated to 250 psi; whereas your 
CO2 cylinder is supplied with over a thousand psi inside it.  To use it 
as a first-stage or single-stage reg would be suicidal.  If you buy a 
low-pressure CO2 reg, check the pressure rating, and ensure you do not 
exceed it.

Granted.

And that's the problem I was trying to resolve.  If pubs have trouble 
emptying a keg before the contents spoil, what hope does the average 
homebrewer have ?  Although not traditional or CAMRA-endorsed, 
delivering atmospheric pressure CO2 to the headspace of your "corny 
keg" will allow the average homebrewer to draw "real ale"-style beers 
through a beer-engine without the beer spoiling before the keg is finished.

Cheers fellow beer lovers!


Here in Canada, shipping beer to competitions presents same kinds of
problems as it does in the USA. Most couriers will not knowingly ship
alcohol! I am fortunate that the office next to mine is a courier company
and that I have had a long standing business & personal relationship with
them. Their policy is not to ship alcohol.....however....they always
knowingly ship my beer for me. They know why I am shipping it and how
carefully it is packed.....and this is okay with them. I asked them about
their "no alcohol" policy and  it is mainly aimed to prevent bootlegging and
the shipment of improperly packed bottles.  When bottles break, it has the
potential to damage many other pieces of freight as well.  This courier
company regularly ships alcohol for a number of different businesses......so
the policy is really that they will ship alcohol for businesses but not for
personal reasons! I expect that this is the same for most courier companies!


For the past 2 years, I have had the honor of shipping some of my beers to
the finals in the NHC. Shipping beer across the border leads to another
problem....Customs! Because customs had the authority to open and search any
parcel they want, I felt it was most advantageous to be honest with the
Courier and the customs paperwork! Due to the fact that it is a personal
shipment, I use the Couriers' Customs Broker to handle my shipment.
Unfortunately, my courier neighbors do not ship to the USA. This led me to
search for a courier that would knowingly ship alcohol. I contacted most of
the big companies and got the same response over and over - NO! I did
however, find 2 companies that have no problem shipping properly packed
alcohol for personal reasons. These companies are Swift Sure Courier and DHL
World Wide Express.  Swift Sure offers 3 levels of service (ground,
expedited ground, and air) and DHL only offers air. (I do not work for
either of these companies and have no affiliation with either of them, I
just like their attitude!)  I would suggest that anyone who needs to ship
beer and is tired of wondering "are they going to find out its beer" look in
their local phone book or yellow pages to see if there is an agent for these
companies in your area. I think that their prices may be a little higher
than UPS, but at least you don't have to lie and worry!


Cheers!

Stir Doctors,


I downloaded a Belgian Wheat recipe from somewhere, and now I can't
relocate it. My problem is that the recipe calls for putting Wyeast 3278 in
the secondary for 2-3 weeks(Brettanomyces bruxellensis). I've never used a
secondary yeast before and am not in possession of the recipe's
instructions. Should I just rack it and pitch like it was the primary?
Thanks in advance.

I haven't been following the thread on UPS shipping, but I recently read
(or watched) and article on how the the Beer of the Month Club does
business.  Not that this is the answer to why they can ship via UPS, but
maybe it's a clue.


Apparently, all Beer of the Month cases are shipped from a distributor
in the state of the address they are being shipped to (Intra-state v.
Inter-state shipping?).  In other words, they have agreements with local
distributors to ship the beer.  The beer never crosses state lines (once
it leaves the distributors paws).  I hope this helps!

Subject: Roggenbier summary


I posted a question about an all-grain roggenbier recipe that my husband
was working out (btw we finally cracked our first batch, a weizenbier, =
and
it's BEER! Cool! Better with lemon though...) and here is a summary of =
the
help we received.


>>I believe you are correct about too much rye in that recipe.  I would
try maybe one pound or so.  Rye can be overpowering.  You'll probably
get better input from experts (I'm not one) but I think most will agree
to cut back on the rye. <<


(The original idea was 4 lbs of reg malt, 3 each of wheat and rye, and
2 oz of Hallertauer hops, 1 oz added at the start and 1 oz after 45 min.)


>>I would also recommend that you increase the amount of hops.  An ounce
of Tettnanger hops for bittering will probably leave the beer too sweet.
I'd shoot for roughly 8-10 HBUs of bittering hops, which for Tettnangers
will be 2 ounces if the Alpha Acid % is about 4.5; 3 ounces if 3.0 or
below, and split the difference if between 3.0 and 4.5.<<


>>Don't know if you checked Michael Jackson's Beer Companion for data, =
but there
is some good information - Schierlinger Roggen, the most commonly availab=
le
Roggenbier in the US, is about 60% rye malt, with about 20% each of pale =
and
crystal malts.  He does briefly describe the special lautering system req=
uired
due to the problems associatied with rye, i.e stuck mashes.  I think it =
is more
common to use around 10 to 15 percent rye in a homebrewing environment. =
 I think
the recipe you mention sounds delicious, but you'll want to lauter slowly=
 and
carefully.  Might not be your best choice for a first all grain batch - =
when I
had a stuck mash on my first (not all that long ago), it nearly put me =
off the
whole process.  Luckily the beer was good.<<


>>Hi,
Anecdotally, I can tell you that a customer of mine recently brewed with
2-3# of rye malt and said that the rye taste was a bit too strong.


Charlie Papazian in his "Companion" book has a recipe for rye beer that
cals for 2# of rye. He claims it is smooth and crisp. I have not tried =
it.


It seems that the amount of wheat and rye in proportion to the pilsner =
malt
in your recipe would certainly slow down the lautering process because =
of
the high level of gums (beta glucans) and lowered amount of filtering med=
ia
(grain husks are only available from the pils malt, not from wheat or rye=
).


I don't know how the Germans do it, but I would guess they use 50%
rye/wheat combined, and you could throw in some brewer's cut "Oat Hulls" =
to
aid in the lautering. They provide a husk material for runoff. Personally=
,
I wouldn't exceed 2# rye in 5 gallons of beer. 3068 is a good choice for =
an
authentic wheat beer. Has some bubbegum and clove to it, though. Hope you
like that. If you want more neutral yeast, use #3333 or #3056.<<


You guys are great!

 Hello to all,

  I don't know why anyone would slam you for not wanting to go through the
drudgery of bottling, unless they are hard-core S&M fans. (No, not Saisons
and Maibocks)
  Miller's Homebrewing Guide has a good section on kegging, and Zymurgy
had a very good article a couple of years ago, check the back issues.
(At least a year before the " I'm-a-3-batch-a-year-extract-brewing-rock-
star-look-I-have-my-own-special Issue.)
  Check out your local welding supply stores. You can usually get a 5 pound
CO2 bottle for around $60 (US) and they will refund it back to you if you
turn it back in, or will credit it for a jump up to a larger size. (Believe 
me, it 
will happen. I have 2, 20 pounders and a 20 cu. ft. Oxygen and think about 
more.) You can some times find rebuilt regulators also, but I would recommend
getting a new one. They can be found pretty cheap mail order. Get a dual 
gauge model.
  There are a lot of used kegs on the market. Check with your local homebrew 
shop first, then look at the ads in the brew rags.
  As far as freshness goes, it is relative to the storage conditions. I have 
never
had a problem with kegged beer getting old. When it is sitting there, cold and 


available, tap beckoning, I find that it does not make it to it's 
Best-when-used-by
date. It is more like my wife saying, "I thought you were going to save some 
of that
for the next homebrew club meeting/competition" It is my opinion that kegged 
beer
tastes better than bottled. I only wish that I could pull a fresh one for the 
judges at 
competition time.
  Before I get slammed, I will say that I do CPF big beers (Strong Scotch 
Ales,
Imperial Stouts, Barleywines) after conditioning in kegs, for long term 
storage.
And use old fashioned bottling techniques (with yeast added) for Belgian 
Trippels.

 Hello to all,
Well after 21 years in the trades I finally have sustained a work lossage
injury. I messed up my neck pretty good. The problem I have (brewing
related) is that I dropped a Barleywine down to 35f in anticipation of 
kegging it for conditioning/ageing and can not lift it now. As it crash 
cooled it picked up oxygen into the headspace of the carboy, reversing 
through the airlock. Can I let it sit in my brew 'fridge for a couple of weeks
without worrying, (who me worry......right) or should I pop the airlock off
and give it a shot of CO2, and let it sit until I can manage to keg it?
Thanks in advance,

Three of us locals share a beer of the month membership.  I took my old
shipping cartons to the homebrew store for them to sell or give to
homebrewers wishing to ship beer.


The first time I shipped beer in my own carton 5 of 6 bottles were
crushed and the AHA outpost rejected the shipment.

Here's something from the Canadian Amateur Brewer's Association's 
competitions people...
        Cheers,
        Eamonn McKernan 
        CABA Secretary
        
This year's competition was the second landmark for CABA in consecutive 
years. Although that is poor English - what I mean is that the first 
landmark was last year, when we had our first out-of-Ontario GCHComp, in 
Edmonton, which was a big success. This year, we had our first drop-offs 
in Calgary and Halifax, and were helped by local sponsors (Wine Mine in 
Calgary, and The Brew Guys in Halifax-Dartmouth), who shipped entries to 
our central sponsor, Upper Canada, who also received Ontario drop-offs 
and were very helpful in providing the judging site. This worked well, 
and next year we intend to negotiate this sort of deal with some other 
provinces. We're always looking for more regional sponsors.


Now, this year wasn't all success, as we had our lowest entry numbers 
(99) since I have been involved in competitions. Why?? Who knows? We are 
seeing a steady decline in entries from Ontario which seems proportional 
to the number of homebrewrs going commercial. All I can say is that it 
was the most 'National' competition ever, in terms of the wide range of 
entries from across this fair land of ours.

I agree with Jeremy that Dave Miller's response shows he doesn't

Fine, Dave doesn't know the answer and neither does an expert in the
field.  However, instead of leaving it at that, Dave decides to waffle
on...

Every account I've read states that botulism is colorless, odorless,
and tasteless.  It is also doubtful that botulism sporolation could
produce enough CO2 to raise a steel canning lid.  The effects Dave is
describing are associated with bacteria spoilage; a much different
beast from botulism.

This is exactly the kind of anecdotal advice we don't need.  The
literature is full of little old ladies who had no problems for 50
years, and then one day became a statistic after tasting their canned
beets.  What about the brewer in Colorado whose water boils at 190F?


Hopefully the editors at BT will realize that Dave's response does
nothing to answer the concerns, and coming from a "big name" could
cause more harm than good, and take the appropriate action.  Dave
Miller and Charlie Papazian have done a lot of good for the
homebrewing hobby, and beer in general, but this is something that
needs to be addressed by experts in a lab.

Subject: Oh where, Oh where can my hops continue to grow?


        I have two fairly healthy hop plants growing up some twine 
        strung from the peak of my garage roof.  I have the twine run up 
        and over small pulleys and then back down to the small flower 
        garden where the hop vines (and my roses) are - the idea being 
        that when the hops are ready to be harvested I can lower the 
        string down gently through the pulley and lower the vine to the 
        ground.  Well - the height of these pulleys is about 15 feet 
        from the ground, and both my hop vines have reached the pulleys 
        and show no sign of stopping!!!  I guess I should have expected 
        that - but what to do?  Where can they continue to grow?  I 
        don't have the luxury of being able to construct any kind of 
        frame/poles with more suspended string - the homeowner rules in 
        my area will definitely not allow it.
        
        The roof of the garage is a possibility maybe, but it is made up 
        of black shingles and I bet that would cook the vines....
