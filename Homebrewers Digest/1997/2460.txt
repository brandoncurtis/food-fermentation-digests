I second that warning.  Last November I made an alcoholic lemonade, with
basically lemon juice, zest and sugar.  I used a double quantity of Coopers
dry yeast and fermented at 25 C.  In a normal beer, the fermentation would
have been over in 2-3 days using that temperature and yeast combination.
The fermentation never really took off explosively and three weeks later it
was still slowly chugging away with a very thick crust of yeast on the
bottom of the carboy, despite mixing the yeast into suspension every few days.


Part of the problem may have been lack of nutrients, as there is no malt in
either my recipe or the one posted recently.


Next attempt at that recipe I will measure pH and add nutrients and post
the results.

The abstract I posted suggests that if the pH of your beer/lemonade
approaches 4.5, the yeast could prematurely settle out, leaving you with
too high a SG.  If you bottled, you might find that the beer slowly becomes
more and more carbonated.  Since lemon juice is acidic, I was concerned
that lemon flavored beers might be closer to pH 4.5 than normal beers, and
more prone to premature flocculation of the yeast.


My suggestion is just to make sure and check the SG before bottling and
make sure it's in a reasonable range.  If it seems too high, rouse the
yeast to try and get it going again.  I can't suggest a specific time to
rouse; it might not be necessary at all.  Rouse if it looks like
fermentation has stopped, but SG is higher than you expected, that's all.

I get a lot of spam, and HBD is one of the only "public" venues where I
expose my unmunged email address. It's with a sinking feeling in the pit of
my stomach that I'd like to alert HBD members to a security breach that I
suspect spammers are using to harvest our email addresses.


The HBD archives and HTMLized digest contain the full text of years of HBD,
and each issue is chock full of email addresses.  I strongly suspect that
these are being used by spammers to build their mailing lists. They could
do this by specifically downloading back issues and grepping them, but I
suspect a more passive route: web crawlers randomly ending up on the
HTMLized digest pages and hitting paydirt.


I'm not sure what to do about this.  Having the searchable, online archives
is clearly valuble, as is easy off-digest communication between HBD
contributors facilitated by including email addresses.  


For now, I'm going to mung my address when posting, although the damage may
already be done.  I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to
members or the digest janitors.  Anyone have ideas on how to close this
breach without destroying the archives?

Subject: Gap Adjustment


Brewsters:


Mike Spinelli asks how to mill wheat and other
 malts with mills with adjustable nips.  =




Here's how I do it.  Close the nip to zero gap ,
start the mill and open the gap until it just begins
 to mill a substantial quantity of grain.   With =


barley malt this will be about 0.070-0.080 inches
 for various British and American and continental
 malts, for wheat malts this will be a little narrower =


and with rye, even smaller still.  The first pass of
 the grain should be crushed into about 6-8 pieces,
 and in the case of barley malt, still mostly in the
 husk and the husks whole.  Wheat and rye, of
 course, have no husks, so this is not a problem.
  Then close the nip to about 0.060-0.065 in. and =


mill again.  One more pass to 0.055 in. will give
 you a "professional" milling equivalent to a
 six-roll mill.  I don't think this fine of a milling is =


desirable with either wheat or rye as they have a =


tendency to stick during lautering. I only do two
 millings even with barley malt as it gives me high
 efficiencies and easy lautering.

Subject: Re:  Yeast from secondary / lagering in keg or secondary


     Hi all,
     
     Marc has used yeast from his secondary, which goes against the advice 
     of Charlie P. and some others.  He wonders if this is bad.
     
     I often harvest yeast from the secondary for several reasons (such as 
     I forgot to harvest from the primary, or I want yeast without trub, or 
     I decide at the last minute to brew with that yeast, etc.).  As long 
     as the beer tastes clean, the yeast should be fine for at least a 
     couple of generations.
     
     The only things I can envision being bad about this practice are the 
     increased risk of contamination and the selecting of yeasts that 
     flocculated more poorly than the ones that were in the primary cake.  
     I don't know how much of a real concern this second point is, but I 
     believe that if you did this to a yeast for several generations you 
     could end up with a strain that floccs poorly.  Just a guess.  Any 
     opinions?
     ------------------------------
     Robert ponders whether or not he can lager his Vienna in a keg, 
     instead of a carboy.  It depends on how the beer smells/tastes now.  
     Many German lager yeasts produce a lot of sulphur.  Most people prefer 
     to leave the beer in a carboy for several weeks until the sulphur 
     dissipates.  If you keg the beer prematurely, the sulphur will be 
     trapped.
     
     On the other hand, some German beers, like Spaten Ur-Maerzen, and even 
     their Pils, have a touch of sulphur in the nose that I find pleasant.  
     It seems to accentuate the maltiness of their beers.  If you wanted to 
     emulate this, you could keg when the nose is to your liking.  It may 
     not do well at contests, though.
     
     If you rack to the keg too soon you will also end up with a fair 
     amount of stuff at the bottom, which will make moving the keg and 
     serving clear beer difficult.  I would let it fall clear in a carboy, 
     then rack to a keg, carbonate, and lager.
     
     Have fun!

Subject: Phil's philler cleaning


Does anyone know how to take apart a Phil's Philler for a real thorough
cleaning?  I always rinse mine (the philler) with hot water after using and
sanitize before using, but something (hop particles, trub?) must be stuck
in it because the two parts don't freely slide like they should.  I hang it
up to air dry, so I don't think I have a corrosion build up that's causing
the binding.

what i have done successfully is lager the beer in the primary or secondary,
and transfer to the keg when ready to drink.  force carbonation is used, so
yeast viability is not an issue for the final racking.  
                                           
this method is good if you're wanting to get  yeast and other things
(tannins, chill haze, etc.) to drop out and not be present in the keg, as 
long as you're careful when you rack.  


tip:  if you rack to secondary and lager in the secondary, you may want to 
purge the headspace with co2, particularly if there's not a lot of fermentation
going on at that point. this helps to flush out most of the free oxygen in the
headspace. 


tip: you can sanitize (or boil) a piece of aluminum foil and cover the mouth
of the carboy during lagering with the foil kept in place with rubber bands.
this prevents the dreaded "airlock suck" from happening as the headspace cools
and contracts.  if active fermentation is still pushing gas through the lock,
and you *gradually*  (~3-5 deg. f per day) lower the temperature down to 
lagering, you may not need to worry about the reverse sucking.   but watch it.

Subject: Re: Sanitation Simplicity Pt 2: Bottles


Rob,
        I am concerned with the conditions of my fridge environment as
well.  the thought of putting clean bottles in the fridge fully knowing
that there is a fan in there and that month-old, moldy bowl
of grapes (hey, it was hiding behind the array of condiments that never
move) gives me the willies.  Here's the solution: Get a 5 gal bucket with
a lid, fill with sanitizer sol'n and chill overnight in the fridge.  Cold
bottle are important for cpbf and soaking them in this chilled bath does
the trick.  I tried a couple variations on a whim.  First, I was in a
hurry so I threw ice into the sanitizer sol'n.  Then that worked so well
the last time I bottled, I threw in a couple 2-liter jugs of frozen water.
Didn't like the latter method because the jugs kept tipping over my
bottles in the bucket and I couldn't fit as many bottles in.  The only
warning I have for you the water gets cold.  With refridgeraton and ice,
it gets in the low 30's.  My girlfriend who used to hand me the bottles
refuses to stick her hand in the cold water and moved up the bottling line
to become the capper.  No matter, I take help where I can get since
bottling is clearly a process desinged for a 6-armed organism.

This happened to me last Christmas.  I was hooking up my Christmas Ale
on Christmas eve.  I left the tap open on the other side of the wall.
After connecting the lines to the keg I started some laundry.  It wasn't
until I noticed the beer seeping under the wall that I realised that
something was wrong.  3 gallons into my new finished basement (read carpet,
walls).  Said a few words, well a lotta, that the SO didn't approve of.
BTW, this is not the first time I've ever had a beer/brewing related
disaster on Christmas eve.  Now I'll only consume (on C.eve) and then I'll
only do that in the comfort of my own home.


The moral of the story is ALWAYS make sure the tap is closed, vent the
pressure in the keg and make sure the CO2 is turned off and the line
vented.
Connect all the lines and make sure the tap is closed.  Turn on the CO2
and check for leaks, make sure the tap is closed.  Oh, did I mention, make
sure the tap is closed when servicing/changing kegs.


Whiskey's too rough, champagne costs too much,

Well, I've actually got the fixed gap MM, not the adjustable one.
However, I've never had a problem crushing wheat malt in it. The crush
looks pretty good, and extraction has been reasonable. FWIW, I use 
Belgian or German wheat malt, which seems to have slightly larger
kernels than the US domestic stuff...


The only grain I've ever had a problem with in the fixed MM was unmalted
pearled barley. Had to run it through about 3 times...

        Ok, what did I do RIGHT???  I have never gotten such a good 
conversion/boil ever.  My best was 1.030 until this batch.
New things I did: Munich malt, and higher second starch temp.

Thanks to Randy Erickson for posting his report on testing our cleaning
products in HBD#2457.


I also want to thank all the HBD'ers who answered my post for volunteers.
Thanks to all the great feedback we received we are going to offer a cleaning
and sanitation kit designed just for homebrewers. 


We will introduce this kit at the homebrewers' conference next week and it
will be available for shipping in early August. We will be hanging around at
the conference, so if any of you are planning to attend please stop by and
say hi. We will also have samples of PBW to give out. 


We are talking to different distributers now to sell this kit to Homebrew
shops. For a short while we will sell it direct. Please check out our web
site at www. FivestarAF.com/homebrew for more information or E-mail to
FivestarAE`at`AOL.com.

Subject: secondary or lager vessle, barbecue


Robert DeNeefe asked about using a secondary or going directly to the lagering
vessel.  I am hardly an expert on lagers but I have made a few.  Last weekend I
kegged one that had been lagering in the secondary for 4+ months at about 33F.
There was considerable sediment in the bottom of the carboy but the beer was
clear from the tap.  I lagered mine in carboys with airlocks as I thought it
would allow any unwanted gasses to escape.  I don't know if this is necessary
but I think the beer was better than one I lagered in a keg and relieved the
pressure on occasionally.  There are any number of things that could account
for the differences so I don't know that airlock lagering is necessarily better.
I do know that I got a lot of sediment in the bottom of the lagering
vessel/secondary, though, if that is a concern.


Rick Gontarek gave a recipe for barbecue.  The ribs prepared that way may be
good but they wont be barbecue.  Barbecue is prepared in a barbecue pit with a
separate firebox and cooked slowly for hours at about 275F.  Proper barbecue
should have a red ring on the outer edge called a smoke ring.  I may be picking
nits but I see a lot of reference to food cooked on a grill as barbecue and
that is not what it is.

Fellow H'Brewers:


I don't know why I didn't think of this before, musta been the beer...


When I'm not homebrewing I manage a program for the State of California
called CALMAX -- The California Materials Exchange -- aimed at finding
outlets for business waste materials. To provide this free service we
produce a quarterly catalog and maintain a website
(http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/mrt/calmax/calmax) that lists materials both
wanted and available throughout California. We also maintain a listing
of and links to material exchange programs throughout North America. 


Like that pointy haired boss in Dilbert, I'm sometimes not aware of all
the inner workings of my programs (a curse of management), but today I
was thumbing through the catalog and found TONS of listings for
available plastic buckets and drums. There was another listing for 400
SS Golden Gate 15.5 gal kegs ($10 each) from Eureka, CA, and even a
listing for a bottler washing machine -- free to non-profit -- from a
microbrewery (Mad River I believe).


While it would not be in the spirit of the CALMAX program to accept
"wanted" listings from individual homebrewers (since the service is
meant for businesses), I invite anyone looking for free or low-cost
equipment to visit the CALMAX website, search the materials "available"
section (the above mentioned items were under "Containers" and Durable
Goods") and see what they might find. For those in other parts of the
world, I'm sure the material exchanges we link to in other states and
provinces would be great resources as well.


This is NOT a commercial posting, but simply info about a free service
offered by the State of CA that anyone with imagination could benefit
from.  Once again, CALMAX is at
http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/mrt/calmax/calmax 


Good luck and happy brewing.

One word of caution: if the foil has made an airtight seal, it will implode
when the air in the bottle cools and contracts, so you'll have a hole in your
foil.


There are those that may say: "Well, if you don't seal the bottle airtight,
the cooling air will suck nasties into the bottle!"


Practically speaking, however, the amount of dust and debris that gets
sucked into your priming vessel during bottling is hundreds of times
greater than that which would be sucked into these bottles during
cooling.

I'd like to discourage everyone from using the expression "Black and Tan"
and in stead use the term "Half and Half."  Although I'm a devout anglophile,
I'm very much against what the "Black and Tans" did in Ireland.  Rent
the movie "Michael Collins" if you're unfamiliar.  Enough politics...
back to beer...

If the yeast is truly all settled, then it would not hurt to pour-off the
the spent wort and add more.  The rule of thumb on stepping-up depends
on who you listen to.  German commercial brewers will tell you a 5-fold
step-up is ideal (10ml -> 50ml -> 250ml -> 1250ml...).  I've read where
American commercial brewers say 10-fold is fine.  Most homebrewers often
do 20-fold step-ups and make great beer, so you can take you pick.


If the yeast is not fully settled and you pour off the partially-spent
wort, you are selecting for more-flocculent yeast (i.e. throwing away the
less-flocculent yeast, which is generally more attenuative).  Doing this
once or twice will probably not show a measurable or noticeable difference
in the finished beer, but when reusing yeast and doing this over and over,
you will select for more-flocculent (quite probably less-attenuative) yeast.


>Question #2; I read somewhere that you should treat the starter culture

Well, I've read this and also I've read where you are making yeast and
not beer, so you want to give the most ideal conditions for reproduction
rather than the most ideal conditions for good beer flavour.  Personally,
I build up my lager starters at around 55 to 60F, which is warmer than
I ferment the main wort, but cooler than I keep my ale starters.

If you want to keep the *strain* alive, you are best off making a slant
or stab and creating a new one (or five!) every six months.  If you
want to keep the whole yeast starter viable, you should keep it cold
and feed it periodically.  I would feed it once a week, but this is
what has worked for me, not something I have read in any books.  If you
need more info on stabs and slants, Brewer's Resource, The Yeast Culture
Kit Company (Dan McConnell), and Advanced Brewers Scientific have
supplies and instructions.  I know the first two have websites.


>Question #2; Is it truly better to gather used yeast slurry from the
>primary as opposed to the secondary and why?


It goes back to the issue of selection.  Personally, I use the yeast
from the primary when I'm going to make a Barleywine or Doppelbock.
The yeast from the secondary will have less break material mixed-in.
If you are doing it only one or two generations, it's not going to
make a difference regarding selection.  However, if you repeatedly
reuse the yeast for 5 or 10 batches, yeast from the primary will *tend*
to be more flocculent, whereas yeast from the secondary will *tend* to
be less flocculent.

Stir Doctors,


Well, the beetles have become board with my hop leaves and have started
eating my smaller, immature flowers. I should be able to pick my first wave
in a couple of days. They seem to be ignoring the biggest cones (thank
God). I just threw beetle bags numbers 5 & 6 into the trash. Already more
than all of last year. 
Next year, NEXT YEAR, my mission in life is to defeat the beetles!!
Hopefully, with the help I've received from the brewing clan, I'll be able
to give it a go.


P.S.- When I saw the beetles eating my flowers I went to the garage and
kicked my wife's Honda. That'll show 'em!!
