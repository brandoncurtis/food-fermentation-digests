(Dave Burley had also commented on this part...he'd lost the reference so
I dug it up.)  Yes, the gaskets will dry out eventually.  It's not quick...
I've got some 14-year-old mead in swing-tops, and it has survived.  The
gaskets die when you open the bottles--you have to scrape rubber very
carefully off the lip, but they've held.  However, these bottles are not a
good idea for long-term storage (hey, what did I know? it was a long time
ago when I did that!) and you're talking about 50% longer than my luck has
held.  If you had the neoprene replacement gaskets you might have a better
chance, but I'd still re-bottle.


>...Is there any help? I figure that layed on 
> there sides the inner portions will stay moist...


I'd say this is a bad idea, for two reasons:  Bringing the mead into
contact with the gasket will tend to pull the flavor of the gasket into the
mead, and the acid+alcohol in the mead will accelerate the deterioration of
the gasket from the inside.  Why not rebottle now, instead of worrying for
the next 21 years?  If you're going to rebottle, it's best to do it as soon
as possible...the older the mead gets, the harder it will be hit by the
shock of rebottling.


Dave suggested rebottling in corked wine bottles.  That's OK, assuming you
are comfortable with corking or can get somebody who is to help you.  It's
not hard but there are a few things that can trip you up, and since you're
making this for posterity you don't get any second-chances.  Corked
bottles are more elegant, but if it were me I'd just use good crown caps
(and store the bottles upright).  Crown caps are cheap (which doesn't
matter), reliable (which does matter) and are proof against fermentation
in the bottle that might give some carbonation over the years and push
corks out.


If you're careful, you can get all your new bottles ready, then open the
old ones and simply pour gently into the new bottles and close them (cork
or cap) immediately.  Leave the bare minimum of headspace and you shouldn't
need to sulfite or worry about excess oxidation.  If you cork, the bottles
go on their sides to keep the corks moist; if you cap, the bottles go
upright to keep the liquid off the seals.  Store in a dark place, cool and
with even temperature.


> ...Also, I thought that I 
> could seal the outside of the gasket with wax...


That's not a bad idea, if you can get a sealing wax that will hold OK for
the long-term and won't fight with whatever the gasket is made of (which is
probably not really rubber any more...don't know).  I'm assuming the mead
is still, since if the gasket fails, sealing wax won't hold carbonation.
Sealing would keep the atmosphere off the outside of the gasket, which
will do a lot to prevent ozone attack.  Still, there are several "if"s in
this approach, and again, you don't get a chance to debug the process.

Subject: zinc


David Whitwell asks:


>I also noticed that zinc was not detected at a detection limit of 0.050.  I
>seem to recall that trace amounts of zinc are necessary for yeast health. 
>Do I need to worry?


I've been wondering about Zinc recently. An opportune question.
At least 0.1 - 0.15mg/l Zn++ is required in the fermenter for yeast
health, and is very stimulatory for yeast growth (and autolysis at the
end of fermentation). It is toxic at high concentrations, as it is
inhibitory to certain enzymes.
A lack of zinc can cause fermentation problems. Zinc also aids foam
stability.
Apparently galvanised water pipes and the use of copper vessels prevents
zinc deficiency (copper always contains zinc impurities). 
Presumably David's water supply does not use galvanised pipes from his
water analysis (<0.05 mg/l (??) present).


So how much zinc is needed and how is it added?
About 1/2 of the zinc from the water is bound in the trub, and
unavailable to yeast. For 20l (5 gal), about 0.1mg/l x 2 (lost to trub)
x 20 = 4mg is required, if it is added to the boil, to give 0.1mg/l.
Zinc chloride is used commercially as a method of addition. This might
be difficult to get hold of for many, and dosage difficult to measure.
Zinc chloride is about 50% by weight of zinc, so about 8mg ZnCl2 would
be needed in the boil per 5 gal. A small amount!


Another idea is to add multivitamin tablets! The ones I have contain
1.5mg Zn per tablet. Therefore about 2-3 tablets (added to boil, or 1 if
added to fermenter directly - I would guess they are pretty sanitary)
would be needed. The other things in a multivitamin tablet are pretty
harmless and may even be beneficial.
Some yeast nutrients also contain zinc, and can be bought in homebrew
shops.


Then again, you probably need not worry, but this may be worth
considering if you run into fermentation problems.


Andy.

You can finish the beer in your keg using any techniques that work
in a bottle (i.e. , kegging before fermentation complete, priming or
krausening), but you have the additional option of force carbonation. If
you prime or krausen, slightly less fermentable  material is necessary due
to the bulk and (for lack of a more scientific explanation) proportionately
less head space than the combined space in two and a half cases of
bottles. After priming, the keg should be stored at whatever temperatures
are required for finishing that style of beer, just as you would with
bottles.


Force carbonation is preferred by some who object to the residual taste
of priming sugar, and don't have any leftover wort for priming. Chill the
beer in the keg as cold as you can get it. The solubility of CO2 is much
higher in cold beer. Once cold, hook up the CO2 and adjust pressure
to about 30 PSI. Now you have two optoins; either lay the keg on its side
and gently rock back and forth, or leave it overnight (must be kept cold). If
you do the manual method, you'll hear the CO2 bubble into solution, and
the whole job will be finished in about 5 minutes. When you stop the
rocking, the liguid immediately surrounding the inlet becomes saturated
with CO2 and the bubbling will stop, hence the requirement for agitation.
The overnight method relies on slow but reliable diffusion to carbonate
the beer. 


BTW, once carbonated, use the pressure relief valve on the lid to vent
headspace and replace it with incoming CO2. This eliminates oxygen 
introduced when the beer was kegged.

The reason some of us can wort is because (a) we use it as Speise in
weizenbier or to krausen our lagers, or (b) we can't stand to waste
those extra quarts of perfectly good wort pouring out of our kettle after
the carboys are full. 


I have canned wort for years and never had any problems. I place four
quarts in a large stainess pot filled with water up to the jar rings, with
the rings loosened so expanding steam can escape. Then I put the lid
on and boil hard for 30 minutes. As soon as I turn off the heat, I
tighten the rings and remove the jars. Within ten minutes the lids pop
down. 


Does this qualify as sufficient sterilization? or have I been lucky?

Subject: More on Chile Beer


Hi All,


For the most drinkable chile beer it is important to get more chile flavor
than chile heat into the beer.  Here in New Mexico, the aroma of chiles
roasting at farmers markets and roadside stands fills the air in late
summer and in the fall.  This aroma is an important component of a good
green chile beer, much as the aroma of hops is imperative in a good ale.
To achieve a good roast flavor and aroma, put whole (intact, with stems,
and with no holes in the chile) roasted and unpeeled green chiles into the
secondary of a lightly hopped blonde or pale ale (light bittering, no
finishing hops).


The type of chile used, the length of time in the secondary, and the
alcohol percentage of the beer will determine the heat level.  Using Big
Jim chiles will yield a mild beer with good chile flavor, and using Sandia
or other medium-hot types of chile will give you more heat.  Use a
combination of chile types to tailor the flavor to your liking.  Poblano
chiles can be used for flavor without heat and Anaheims are medium.  A half
dozen six inch chiles for five days in the secondary fermenter is about
right.  A common mistake in chile beers is to go with too much heat.  I
have seen a lot of half-finished glasses of chile beer when the heat gets
to be too much for most drinkers.


To roast chiles at home, place fresh chiles on a hot barbeque grill or
under an oven broiler until the skin on the side toward the heat blisters.
Before the blisters turn from brown to black, turn the chiles over and
blister the other side.  The roadside vendors use a mesh tumbler over a
very hot propane flame.  This blistered skin is left on the chiles when put
into the fermenter, and its' effect is akin to the aroma hops in a good
pale ale.


Also, heed the advice of Dave Whitman and Samuel Mize.  Wash your hands and
fingernails after working with hot chiles and don't rub your eyes.


Good Luck,

Subject: The Wheat Beer Question is Still Open


Hi, y'all,


I got some private e-mails concerning my answer to David's wheat beer
question.


Summarizing these, I find two bigger parties:


The one likes lemon slices in the Wheat, especially in that kind of
Wheat, we call in Germany Kristall-Weizen (that's Wheat without any
yeast in the bottle, crystal clear). As I said: It gives a fresh and
fruity taste, in particular on hot summer days.


The other party, strict adherents to the German purity law
(Reinheitsgebot) I think, denies the legitimacy to put anything other
into the glass than the beer itself. BTW: What do these guys think of
the custom to mix beer with lemonade???


But both parties see consensus in the fact, that dry rice shouldn't be
put into the Wheat anyway.


But I'll stop here - this is a mailing list on homebrewing, and not a
list on beer philosophy, isn't it?

Subject: Kegging


In reply to First Time Kegger, Paul Buettner asking about carbonating a 
keg:


I have been kegging my beer for some time now and can only give you my 
insight, you have to make your own decisions.


The first question you have to answer is if you want to drink the beer 
quickly or not.  If speed is your choice, then the best (or only) thing 
you can do is to force carbonation.


Another question is if it is a bitter beer or if you would like its 
bitterness increased.  CO2 from forced carbonation will increase the 
bitternes slightly (CO2 is bitter).


Lastly, you have to decide wheather you want to have some yeast sediment 
in the bottom of the keg (which means you will waste a little beer 
getting rid of it).


That all said, both options work well.  I have carbonated both ways and 
the real question I ask myself is if I want the beer ready tomorrow or 
next week.  I prefer the head of the naturally carbonated beer as it 
seems to be finer and longer-lasting than the forced carbonated.


If you force carbonate, allow the beer to cool down in the refrigerator 
for some time as cold beer will accept the CO2 better than beer that is 
at room temp.  The best way is to take the cool beer and attach the CO2 
to the liquid out side, as this allows the CO2 to go through the beer.  
Then put 30lbs (or more, depends on how carbonated you want it) of 
pressure on the keg.  Place the keg on its side and keep rolling and 
shaking it until you don't hear anymore CO2 being released.  Take the 
CO2 off the keg and allow the keg to sit for several hours (or overnight 
preferably).  As the beer warms up, the CO2 disolves into the beer.  The 
next morning, release the pressure from the keg, and replace the 
pressure to about 5-7 lbs.  Now place the beer back into the 
refrigerator and allow it the come to drinking temp.  You are now ready 
to have your beer from the keg.

Beer me Hop, Scotty!


Help!  I've recently gotten on a brewing binge and have three batches
currently in the fermenters.  Two in the secondary and one in the primary.
I'll be bottling these beers over three successive weekends and was
wondering whether I could prepare my iodophor solution for my bottles, etc.
and use it over the two week period without losing sanitization
effectiveness.  I plan to cover the container to prevent
oxidation/evaporation although I don't know if this is even a factor.


It seem such a waste to prepare three iodophor solutions when one will work
(if it will).  And this doesn't sound much different from information I've
gleaned from the Digest related to long term storage of Corny kegs.


Any suggestions or advice?


Oh, and in regard to chile beer and the relative strength of jalepeno
versus habenero peppers:  pepper heat is measured in Scoville Units.
Jalapenos rank between 2,500 and 5,000 S.U. whereas habeneros (and I LOVE
them!) rank between 250,000 and 300,000+ S.U.  Use them SPARINGLY!

Subject: Low Mash Efficiency


This was discussed on rcb but I think it is worth repeating here.


I was recently bummed out by a dial thermometer that decided to
jump up about 10 degrees.  That's enough to destroy the enzymes
and I ended up with a kettle of starchy water.


Half that error could put you somewhere in the marginal range and
result in poor efficiency.  So before blaming the mill or malt,
check that thermometer.  I now do it before ever batch.

Just a quick editorial comment: Dick Dunn's rant in #2468 was a 
bit outside the bounds of intellectual discourse. Ad hominem's 
are a bit unnecessary. Remember, it's a hobby! Besides, lots of 
folks had already written to disagree w/ the original assertion

For 12 pounds of grain in 5 gallons your OG `at` 60F should have been easily=

Typically even the most poorly ground malt ( milling is normally the
problem with efficiency) gives numbers in the 70%s.  Nevertheless, you ma=

to hold mashing temperature at 155F for an hour and a half without doing

Subject: Sour Malt


The brewer at a local micro is a graduate of Weihenstephan. He's a
strict traditionalist and will not adjust his pH with salts or acids (he
says it has a negative effect on flavor!). He uses a special malt he has
imported from Germany, called "sour malt" to adjust mash pH. When he
gave a presentation (read:sells promotion) to our homebrewers club, we
asked if it were possible for the club to buy a quantity of this malt
and some of the hard to obtain Hallertau Mittlefruh hop through him. He
declined saying that if someone used these raw materials and made bad
beer it would reflect negatively on his reputation.(Perhaps someone
would make better beer! Sounds like a cop out to me.) Anyway, I would
like to get some of this sour malt for the flavor character it
contributes, not for pH adjustment (not being bound to some silly 400
year old law!) The sour, lactic flavor is quite addictive and I see many
posibilities for this quantitative (as opposed to a sour mash) source of
lactic flavor. Does anyone in the collective know of a supplier who can
get this malt? Our local suppliers have been unresponsive and I have
been unable to find it elsewhere. Respond to me directly or post for
everyone enlightenment! Thanks!

Subject: Re: rectangular cooler mash tun


MCer1235`at`aol.com asked about using a rectangular cooler as a mash tun....


I built one and am very happy with it, considering how little time and $'s
went into it. I used 1/2" CPVC for all of the piping, mainly because it was
cheap and easy. Also, I couldn't find a good argument for using copper. I
used a bandsaw for all of the cutting, slotting etc. One big plus of CPVC was
the availability of CPVC to brass compression fitting to garden hose to 3/8"
hose barb adapters. I could attach anything I wanted without hurting myself. 


Some lessons I learned:


Heat loss is a big PITA. Design it to operate with the lid closed and add
extra insulation (I throw a towel over it) to the lid.


Glue as much of the outlet piping (outside the cooler) as possible to keep it
from drawing in air through the cracks.


Make certain you get CPVC glue and not PVC glue. There is a difference. Also,
remember to get cleaner.


Don't glue the slotted manifold. Mine comes apart so I can clean it. The
dishwasher does a lovely job.


Any joints you don't glue - keg lube. It helps seal, makes it easier to
assemble and disassemble.


A piece of racking cane plastic will fit in a 3/8" brass compression fitting
with some persuasion. Some ingenuity and the correct fittings will make it a
fine sight glass. If you install before the outlet valve it can be used to
underlet your grain bed.


Valves on the inlet and outlet make sparging a breeze. Those hose pinchie
things are a hassle.


I use a 3/8" hose to get to my brew pot. To keep it from sagging (and so I
don't burn my hands) I run it inside whatever you call those plastic tubes
you attach to the vacuum hose.


AND.... it is so easy, even a girl could build one.


I will admit a SS mash tun would be preferable. Mainly so I could add heat
while mashing without melting the whole apparatus. I have been getting
efficiencies of 75 to 80%. I could probably do better if I cared to watch the
pH or to watch at all. I am a hugely impatient (read lazy) person and can't
bear to babysit the thing. If anyone would like design specifics I would be
happy to put them in some sort of computer type picture.

Well, either method will work. For me, the convenience of kegging and force
carbonating is WHY I keg. I don't want to wait another week or so for
natural carbonation in the keg. CO2 is CO2, though, and both methods can
produce similar results. I've found it's best to give the beer some time to
absorb the CO2 if you force carbonate. Don't expect to shake it "till
you're dizzy" and serve immediately. You'll get alot of foam and little
carbonation. I use the carbonation chart published in "Brewing Quality
Beers" and "The Homebrewers Companion." You can also find a similar chart
at Dion Hollenbeck's web page. (www.vigra.com/~hollen/brewdocs/index.html)
I leave mine in the fridge to chill for 12 to 24 hours, then serve with
7-10 psi. If the beer is young going into the keg, a few days of maturation
often improves the flavor. And expect some yeast sediment on the first pint
or so, unless you are patient with your secondary and/or use fining agents
or filtering. Have fun, you may never bottle again! Check past issues of
the HBD for more info on kegging, too. It's a wealth of info. I'm only
posting since the HBD is a bit slower over the summer. See ya,

Jeff,


I think they are referring to Yakima Kent Goldings. Especially if its an
aroma hop. Not that Yakima Kent are a substitute for EKGs (nothing is), but
it IS from the same rootstock. I could be wrong, but none of my hop
catalogs list a hop just called "Yakima" I don't think they are referring
to Magnum, since this is bred for its alpha (14% typically) more than its
aroma. The Ultra hop is a triploid of the Hallertauer, supposedly similar
in aroma to the mittelfrueh, but with a lower typical alpha acid level.
This info is cited from the Hopunion web page (www.hopunion.com) I haven't
tried Ultra yet, but I can recommend Mt. Hood as a nice substitute for
imported Hallertauer. I hope this helps. You may want to call Fred Czuba at
Steinbart Wholesale for more info. on purchasing these hops for your store.
He's pretty knowledgable about their properties.

Ok, the "Don't" in my opening line was a bit extreme. (Don't use homegrown 
hops for brewing)   I will take the flames for that, but I do think adhominem

If you can't just discuss the issues and not turn it into a personal attack,  
then don't post.


Perhaps I should explain that as a proprietor of a brew supply store, I get 
the question about using homegrown hops all the time.  My goal is to help my 
customers make the best beer possible with the best ingredients available.  
Homegrown hops are fun to experiment with, but very unpredictable.  And I 
might add I do not think they are the best possible ingrediant available, 
given the choice between a comercially grown and the homegrown hop, I would 
have to chose the comercial.  I can not, with any conscience, tell any brewer 
I sell a rhizome to that he is going to get good cones for making good beer.  
There are just too many variables and the chances are that he will get poor 
quality cones.   I say go ahead and experiment and let me know if you get good 
results from your hops. (I have yet to here from anyone who used successfully 
their homegrown)    If I sell a brewer a Hallertauer rhizome (Hallertauer are 
perhaps the biggest selling hop and the most difficult to grow -the most 
disease prone) and tell him he will get good hops and be able to brew good 
beer with those hops, I would be both dishonest and doing a disservice to my 
customer.


As for growing hops in England,  I am well aware of the problems that English 
hop growers have with disease and mildew.   It is not that is impossible to 
grow hops outside the 30 and 50th latitude,  they just do best within this 
range.   Less than ideal conditions; the greater the chance for; Mosaic 
disease,  Downy mildew, Verticillium wilt just to name a few things that hop 
plants get.   


And, Dick;  As for knowing what I am talking about, you might want to check 
out my article in Brewing Techniques  --  cover story for Sept/Oct 95. -- I've

Hey all,


        I'm slowly but surely getting my kegging act together.  I started by 
getting a free (i.e. old) refridgerator.  I then collected a CO2 tank, 
regulator, etc, etc, etc.  I'm currently using a Sankey 1/4 barrel to keg 
with.  It works great, but I can only get one keg in the fridge.  I've been 
contemplating switching over to corny kegs, since I'm told they are easier 
to deal with (but to be honest, I'm not thoroughly convinced).  
        Anyway, the 1/4 barrel (7.75 gallon) keg works well, and allows me to 
keep the top shelf in the fridge for other beers, and brewing supplies, and 
the like.  The five gallon corny keg is about 29 inches high, which would 
force me to remove the top shelf (I really don't want to do this).  I know 
they make three gallon corny's, but I'm not sure of the dimensions.  Can 
anyone out there who uses the three gallon corny's get me the dimensions 
for them?  My local brew shops (there are two I go two, and neither one of 
them really satisfy me) only have the five gallon ones.  
        On another note, if anybody knows where I can get some (I live in 
Lowell, Mass or by mail order), let me know so I can get more that one beer 
on tap at a time!


thanks much,
