Subject: Re: Legal brewing of Eisbocks




Kudos to Jeff who in hbd #2475 posted the url of a wonderful resource 
for looking into some of the legal issues of alcohol.  However, I 
looked through the codes and found what I think are some important 
ommissions in his excerpts which seem to support my interpretation
of this particular issue.


Jeff cited 27 CFR 252.11 (Meaning of Terms):


"(a) Conditions on concentration.  A brewer may not employ any
process of concentration which separates alcohol spirits from any
fermented substance."


However, the rest of the section describes the reconstitution of
"Beer Concentrate" such as "reconstitution of beer will consist of the
 addition to the concentrate of carbon dioxide and water only."


This would seem to indicate that a brewer can concentrate beer.
This is verified in 27 CFR 25.263 [Subpart R] (Production 
of concentrate and reconstitution of beer):


"(a) Operations at brewery.  A brewer may concentrate beer or
reconstitute beer only at a brewery."


The rest of the provisions regards labelling, transfer, and
reconstitution.  


Also in 27 CFR 252.11 (Meaning of Terms) we find the definition
of Concentrate:


"Concentrate. Concentrate produced from beer by the removal of
water under the provisions of Subpart R of this part.  The
processes of concentration of beer and reconstitution of beer are
considered authorized processes in the production of beer."


So what this definition and the condition statement earlier say is 
that a brewer can concentrate beer through the removal of water but
not through distillation (removal of alcohol). It also recognizes
this procedure as a beer brewing process.


I suspect that these provisions are meant to cover the activities of 
such brewers as Coors who ship concentrate to be reconsituted at various 
nationwide bottling plants. However, it seems to me these provisions 
provide for the distinction between freezing and distilling with the 
former permitted.


The catch is that there is no provision for selling "beer concentrate" 
in a retail market. Not to mention some strict records and reporting
requirements. Also, it only provides for the transfer to another 
brewery of the same ownership. Since the definition of concentrate does 
not list any quantitative measurements, it likely includes Eisbock style 
beers and this would affect commercial production of this style (e.g. not 
allowed to sell it).  However, it doesn't say you can't give it away like 
HOTD Eve.


I can find no other areas that seem to relate to freezing/concentrating
beer. There is also no mention of this type of procedure under the 
definition of distillation (19.316). So concentrating beer through
the removal of water is a recognized process in brewing and is defined
and treated separately from distilling. 


It is also important to note that homebrewers are not considered
brewers under these regulations:


"Brewer. Any person who brews beer (except a person who produces
only beer exempt from tax under 26 U.S.C. 5053(e)) and any person
who produces beer for sale."


So, again I argue that the Code of Federal Regulations distinguishes
concentrating beer from distilling and therefor I am not distilling
when I make an Eisbock or Eve knockoff.


Disclaimer: This is only submitted for discussion's sake and as an
explaination of my stand on this issue. I am not giving legal advice.

Rob, what you might be smelling is either Yeast Nitrogen Base which is used
as one of the nutrients in the media or the plastic tube as a result of
heating. These tubes contain very low gravity enriched wort. At his low
gravity little, if any krausen forms.  Depending on the temprature (is it
summer where you live?), these tubes can ferment out overnight.  The media
is designed to grow yeast rapidly.  It is definately not something that
will make a drinkable (or wonderful smelling) beverage.

But the alcohol isn't separated from the fermented substance in

Thanks to all who responded to my question of how to classify "Negra"
Modelo.  Not only did I learn how to correctly spell the beer but
everyone who responded indicated that it is a Vienna style lager and
everyone recommended George and Laurie Fix's book on lagers as a good
place to start.  I have always been an ale brewer but I will pick up
this book and try my hand at the recommended "Graf-style" lager.  


Thanks also to Charlie Marino who offered the following historical
background on Vienna style beers/brewers "Most of the Viennese brewers
migrated to Mexico after the collapse of the Ottoman empire."  Certainly
an the most interesting beer in a squat brown bottle!


Thanks

Subject: fermentables vs. dextrins


     Reading the HBD the last few days has got me thinking about
     the sugars present in wort.  First, John Carsten has had 
     a bit of trouble with the body in his porter.  Consensus
     seems to be that he let it mash at too low of a temperature,
     creating too many fermentable sugars.  Second, Ken Schwartz
     created his own specialty malts at home.  He states that, 
     according to Randy Mosher, the process favors the creation
     of dextrins over ferementables.  Also, I have read that 
     crystal malt and cara-pils malt contain a high proportion of
     dextrins.  Some brewers use these malts, especially cara-
     pils, to add body to their beer (obviously, crystal adds
     color and flavor components as well due to the fact that it 
     has been caramelized to an extent).
     
     All of this leads me to a question.  What keeps the 
     beta-amalysases from breaking down the dextrins provided by
     speciality malts?  Or, maybe the question should be, why add
     cara-pils when you can just raise your mash temperature to
     contribute to a more dextrinous wort?
     
     Please help to enlighten this brewer.
     
     Cheers!

Subject: plambic at the GABF


Here's a thought that just occurred to me.  At last year's GABF John Fahrer
(sp?) (1996 hboy) of Nebraska was on hand with a keg of his award winning
beer, offering samples to anyone who wished to savor a good home brew.
Several hundred people tasted that beer and exchanged a few words with
John.  Good publicity for home brewing.


This year Charlie Gottenkjeny (sp?) may be at the GABF offering samples of
his plambic to the public.  Probably not good for home brewing.  I think
offering non-home brewers plambic is going to do more harm than good.  They
might get the impression that all home brew tastes like that.  The fact is
most people haven't tried lambic, and most people cringe the first time
they do.  I think maybe Charlie should offer something a little more subtle
at the GABF.


And don't tell me that offering the plambic would be very beneficial and
educational.  That's crap.  Every amateur beer lover at the festival will
go home thinking home brew sucks.  At the very least there should be two
beers to choose from;  the plambic and a pale ale, or a pilsner, or maybe a
wheat beer.


I have nothing against lambic, I even enjoy one from time to time.  And I'm
sure Charlie's is an excellent example of the style.  But giving it to
unsuspecting, potential home brewers would not be wise.

Salutations -


Since we're talking about botulism, anybody see 48 Hours last night?
They did a story on a doctor that is using live botulism to remove
wrinkles from peoples faces. He injects the live bacteria into their
faces where wrinkles are present. The toxin produced paralizyes the
muscles, removing the wrinkles. So what are you guys worried about? If
you have botulism in your beer, it will be impossible for you or your
friends to get "Bitter Beer Face"!!!

Regarding Eisbock:

> "(a) Conditions on concentration.  A brewer may not employ any

The Brewer is not removing any alcohol spirits from the fermented
substance. The Brewer is removing water and proteins that freeze, right?
The alcohol stays in the fermented beer. If any of you feel guilty about
taking advantage of this free legal advice, you may clear your
conscience by sending me a case of the first Eisbock that you brew.

Subject: Eisbock - The BATF Speaks.....


With all due respects to all the posters, and there have been many - some
good ones, too:


Spouting of statistics is a relative subject! For example, one can
determine the odds of being the winner of the California Lottery by
dividing the number of tickets one buys by the total number of tickets
sold. However, the person who manages to win is a one-hundred percent
winner!


Statistics work well when predicting the behavior of a function over a
large population.  For example: if 1 in 10 million people poke their eye
with a sharp stick, today, some 27 people will do so in this country. The
chances of me doing it are indeed slim, but if I am one of the unlucky
ones, it bloody hurts.


This letter was sent to me by Mr. Charles N. Bacon, of the Bureau of
Alchohol, Tabacoo and Fire Arms in reposne to my request for an opinion:


The story of eisboch is obviously lost to time although a few German
brewers continue to produce the style.  More recently, American Brewers
"discovered" the style in Canada; Labatt claims to have invented it
although the Niagara Falls Brewery apparently produced it before anyone
else in recent times in North America.  I have seen evidence that this
type of beer was produced by local brewers in the 1930's and 1940's.
Hard cider has been produced throughout the east by this method since
colonial times.


Because of the uncanny resemblance to a concentrate made from beer, the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has written a formal ruling on
"ice beer."  Essentially, it states that if a brewer superchills beer
and removes ice or water, the product will be considered to be ordinary
"beer" if the volume of material removed is not more than 1/2 of 1% of
the original volume, and if the resultant product resembles "beer."
This ruling was issued to prevent brewers from producing an "ice beer"
which is seriously concentrated by the removal of water or ice.  Classic
beer concentrates often are 15% alc/vol or more and may have only 1/4 of
their original volume.  These products are taxed as distilled spirits if
they are removed from a brewery or imported without being reconstituted
with water.


The eisbock or ice beer method of production would be considered as
ordinary home beer making and home brewers could use the method if they
wished.  ATF's primary interest would be, as usual, to ensure home
brewers were not selling the beer they make.




Mr. Bacon goes on to list the actual ruling, which would be too long to
post here. I will make if available for those of you who want a private
e-mail of the document.


Carry on brewing, gentlepersons!  Go to the source when in doubt!

First on the Botulism thread.  As has ben pointed out life is a risk.  But one
thing that everybody has been ignoring is that Clostidium botulinum is a strict
anaerobe.  It won't grow nor will it sporulate when air is present.  So for all
of you who use the simple hot water immersion method to "can" your wort just
loosen the lids after the jars have had cooled to allow air into the jar.  Then
tighten the lid and put it into the refrigerator.

So can you outline what some of the "hows" will be?  Gee I go on vacation and

using the table of beer style guidelines.  IOW no specific recipe, just the
"generic" ingredients.  So far, so good.  Pitched a half-gallon Wyeast 1028
starter and was cookin' in 3 hours.  I racked it to secondary not quite 72
hours later, even though I was getting 8-10 bubbles a minute.  It had
dropped from 1.060 to 1.010 in that period of time!!!  Left it in secondary
a week. Primed and bottled it and tried it today, 12 days later.  FLAT.
Did I rack it too soon and leave too much yeast in the primary trub?
If I choose to prime each(thankfully flip-top) bottle, would I be better
served to just sprinkle some dry yeast into each bottle(how much???), or,
would it be better to use a starter because of the level of alcohol(+5%) in
the bottles now, and if so how much?  A teaspoon.  A tablespoon.
This stuff is GOOD and, by God I'm'a'gonna drink it, flat or not, but if I
could just get a little head, I could share it with some of my less astute
buddies.


Thanx

Subject: US Tettnang really Fuggle! 


This one is bound to ruffle a few feathers...


Colin Green of the reknowned Hop Research Unit, Wye College, Kent, claims
that most, if not all of the US (and Australian) Tettnang crop appears to
be Fuggle, in the July/Aug 1997 issue of the Journal of the Institute of
Brewing. Gas chromatograms of 16 "Tettnang" samples from around the US show
the characteristic chromatograms of UK Fuggle, rather than German
Tettnanger.


In addition, single samples of USA Tettnanger and USA Hallertauer
Mittelfruher clones grown in Australia also appeared to be Fuggle.


Samples of (European) Saaz and Tettnanger were also of the same variety.
The USA Saaz sample was indistinguishable from that grown at Wye. 
(ie. UK Saaz = US Saaz = German Tettnanger)!


GLC analysis of essential oils is a well established method for determining
the variety of a hop sample. The most likely explanation of the results is
that mistakes were made many years ago during the propagation and selection
of the varieties.

If you think 20 minutes is fast- add a powered stirrer to the boiler. It's
one of the best additions I've made to my brewery and I'll never go back to
using a counterflow chiller.  Moving the hot wort over the immersion chiller
coils *greatly* speeds cooling- e.g. 6 gallons of boiling wort to 68 degF
with 64 degF tap water (vs. Migel's ~ 58 degF water) in 15 minutes.  If you
want a lower final wort temp. or a faster chill, use tap water 'til the wort
temp drops to ~ tap water temp. + 10 degF then run the tap water through a
prechiller (a coil in a ice water bath) or use a cheap bilge pump to recirc.
ice water through the immersion chiller.  If your HLT has a pump and is
insulated, fill it with ice/water and it'll likely make a good source of
cooling water. 


Used during the boil, the stirrer also increases bitterness derived from the
hops, eliminates any concern with wort carmelization or burning. If it's
important to ya, it also allows more of the cold break  to remain in the
boiler since the cooling is quicker and you can cool the wort way down and
then raise the temp. back up to pitching temp. by circulating warm water in
the chiller.  Stirrer details are at:

Joe Stone described his very nice (but tall) cylindriconical fermenter he
made from a 10 gal. SS keg and said:

Just a brain fart:  rack to a 5 or 10 liter keg (maybe tilted to reduce the
effective height) and use compressed air to push the brew up to the
fermenter. By using a long dip tube/air stone attached to the CO2-in fitting
to deliver the air to the keg, you can oxygenate the wort as you rack.
FWIW, it takes ~0.46 psig to raise sg-1.060 wort one foot.  I was going to
suggest using O2 to rack, but I don't know how the gaskets in the keg would
react to it.  Also, it'd be expensive unless you've a welding rig already.  


I wouldn't trust a pump for pumping wort unless it's sanitized by
recirculating  boiling wort through it for awhile.  I wouldn't depend on
sanitizing solutions to get in all of the nooks and crannies (and possibily
scratches) in the pump.  YM (or degree of anal-retentiveness) MV...


Per Occam's Razor, simply raising the boiler is probably the best solution.  
- ---------------------
On a racking related note, Layne Rossi described about a gizmo that racks
brew by pressurizing a carboy with compressed air from am aquarium pump.


Sounds like a way to perhaps rupture a carboy to me- particuliarly a
scratched one.  Scratches act as stress risers and weaken the glass.  Also,
if you've ever broken a carboy, you'll have noted how surprising thin the
side walls are.  I'd at least want a pressure relief valve in the system...
Maybe a secondary racking tube with it's  open, outboard end attached to
tubing raised to a height slightly above the highest point of the "real"
racking hose.  (The extra height is needed to account for friction loss in
the racking hose.)  Overpressure from a clogged or crimped racking hose
would force wort out of this tube and indicate that you need to shut off the
pump.

Subject: Notso silly,


Brewsters:


I still remember my first drink of my homebrew and the courage it took to=


believe that I wasn't poisoning myself in some manner. Those were in the
days ( 1969)  when almost nothing was known about beer making except rumo=
rs
by homebrewer wannabees.  The fact that I have survived and prospered ( I=
'm
a much better chemist)) from brewing is a testament to homebrewing.
Nevertheless, lately  we have been asking ourselves about the safety of o=
ur
method of brewing, which I believe is overall a good thing, as long as we=


pursue it to the end and not shy away from brewing before we know the who=
le
story.


Michael Baum asks  a question I asked myself long ago.  "If botulism is a=


problem with wort stored under vacuum, then beer which is anaerobic, bein=
g
under CO2 , could also be a problem , nichtr wahr??" =




Well, thankfully, I answered the question with a negative response. Its t=
he
pH.  As wort ferments, the pH drops into the safe range which prevents th=
e
Clostridium spores from growing into bacteria and forming the toxin. The
alcohol may help.  As far as I know, the hops which are effective some of=


the time on some of the lactobacilli are not reputed to be effective
against Clostridium.  Perhaps because it doesn't appear to be a problem.
The high sugar content of CONCENTRATED extract likewise inhibits
clostridium growth in the anaerobic environment of the tin can, oxygen
prevents it when diluted and when the yeast consume the oxygen and begin
fermentation the pH drops.  So as the Ozzies in the outback near 'Alice'
say "No weirries".


As far as not hearing about people involved with homebrew and death goes,=
 I
recall that I was saddened at the early deaths of H.E. Bravery ( British
Pioneer of homebrewing in the 1960's) and Dave Line (British  author of a=


number of HB books). I recall wondering at the time if homebrew poisoning=


was the problem.  I managed to convince myself that it was more likely
other problems. Perhaps over consumption of homebrew and other alcoholic
beverages or other things such as heart attacks or automobile accidents
which bring on early death are more likely to blame.


As far as the comment that C. Papazian made that beer contains no known
pathogens goes, Malting and Brewing Science made the same statement long
before Charlie ever stirred a mash.


My conclusion?  As long as beer is brewed along normal lines of
concentrations, known yeasts, temperatures, etc. it is not only a safe
beverage but can improve your lifestyle both intellectually and
hedonistically, taken in moderation.

Subject: Home-pelletized hops


I discovered a way to get the flavor of leaf hops and the conveninence of
pellet hops by total accident!  Home Pelletization!  Here's how.


Attempt to put 1 oz. leaf hops (any variety) into a secondary carboy through
the neck.  Get a bright idea!  Use a funnel!...Sanitize the funnel, but don't
dry. Dump hops into funnel.  Attempt to force the hops through the funnel
using, progressively, a old siphon hose, a old racking cane, a long pencil,
and finally a fiberglass muzzleloader ramrod.  After entire ounce of hops
jammed hopelessly in funnel, cut open neck of funnel lenghtwise with
appropriate device.  My funnel was plastic, so I used a utility knife.  You
may need a cold chisel if your funnel is metal.  Viola!  a perfectly shaped
hop pellet that drops in your fermenter effortlessly!!  And you now have
total control on how your leaf hops have been pelletized...no more guesswork.


Obviously, kids should do this under adult supervision.


Cheers!

Subject: questions on 5l mini-kegs (checked HBD archives...)


After looking through the HBD archives (back to 1995 so far), I have a
few questions on the 5l mini-kegs.  If you believe that your reply might
not be of general interest to the group, feel free to respond via e-mail.


I've also got some questions (last) about a beer that's recently appeared
in town, Diebels Alt....


First, some background.  I live in a small apartment, and it's going to
be a few years before I'm in a position to buy a house (that, of course,
assumes that one can still get insurance in Florida, but that's another
issue).  I do *NOT* have room for a fridge large enough for a real keg,
but my dorm-sized beer fridge holds 5l mini-kegs nicely.  Unfortunately,
I also don't have much time to spend bottling....  In fact, this has
become a big enough problem lately that I haven't brewed a batch in
quite some time.  ;-(


Solution (I hope):  5l mini-kegs for most of the batch.  I also very much
prefer beer on tap (who doesn't?).  I just ordered a tap, bungs, and CO2
cartridges (16 gram) from one of the mail-order places I found on the
net.  The tap is a Beer King tap ($47 from Bacchus & Barleycorn, Ltd.).
I'd already planned on probably buying a second tap eventually (e.g., for
parties, etc., when I might want two kegs tapped at once), and based on
comments I found in the archives (about plastic taps), I will probably
buy their other tap, the Party Star Deluxe ($75), or something similar,
and use it as my primary tap.


And now for the questions that I haven't found answers to....


1) Is there a FAQ or good set of instructions out there on using
   5l mini-kegs?  If so, that's probably enough to cover the rest
   of this....


2) Is there any difference in how I need to handle store-bought
   mini-kegs that already have beer in them (the Diebels Alt comes to
   mind---I'll probably use that as a good, cheap, and tasty way to buy
   kegs).  What I'm mainly concerned about is the fact that it's already
   carbonated, and probably more than homebrew would be.  Then again,
   I've never kegged anything, so I could be way off-base here....


3) I've read a lot of comments about the Carbonator.  Where would
   I find such a beast?  From the comments I've read, it sounds like
   something worth having.  The same place I bought the tap from has
   the following listed (just now saw it):
         CARBONATOR, VALVE COUPLIN $ 15.00
   Does this sound like it's the whole setup?  Or is it likely to just
   be an adapter?


4) I've read and heard a *LOT* of different suggestions for the
   amount of priming sugar to use.  Ideally, I'd like to keg most of a
   batch, and leave about 12 bottles.  I've gotten numbers for priming
   each keg individually (nothing much on what to do with for priming
   the remaining bit for bottles, though), and for priming the whole
   batch.  If I've understood correctly, the general consensus seems to
   be to use 1/2 cup of corn sugar for the entire batch (I'm assuming
   that's for either a 5 or 6 gallon batch), and then kegging part of
   it and bottling the rest.  Is that about right?


5) I've heard that the kegged beer doesn't take as long to clear as
   bottled beer (6--10 days, as opposed to 2--3 weeks).  Is this
   true?  Do I get the added bonus of a (slightly) smaller requirement
   for patience when waiting to sample a new batch?  :-)


6) Do the taps come with instructions?  I hope so, because I need
   them....  Again, I've helped empty some kegs before, but I've
   never filled one!


Well, I think that about wraps it up for now.  Any other comments and
suggestions for someone who is about to start using 5l mini-kegs, and
has never kegged anything in his life, would also be more than welcome!


Finally, I mentioned the Diebels Alt that's just come into the area.
This beer, in fact, was what finally pushed me into getting started
with the 5l mini-kegs.  IMHO, it's a very nice beer, particularly when
on tap, but I just don't want that much at one time...I'd like to buy
a 5l keg of the Diebels Alt, and have it to enjoy over a week or so.


I would also like to clone this beer, and that's where my final question
comes into the picture.  Does anyone have any suggestions for an extract
brew that gets close to this beer?


Thanks,
   --jim

A while back I read somewhere on the net about using milk to attach labels.
After trying it with several cases I can tell you that it works great.
Whoever had the idea it is very good. The labels stay on until you want to
peal them off and the bottles clean easily.


As easy as that was, I seldom put labels on anymore. Putting labels on
several cases got old fast so I now write a number on the cap to identify
the batch. It isn't fancy but it is quick and a lot less work.

Subject: A Somewhat Sleazy Idea For Color Correction


Yesterday I brewed an altbier I had been planning for several months and
for which I had run three other test batches to refine the recipe and
procedure.  In ordering the ingredients, however, I decided to go with
German grains instead of the Belgium ones I had used in my most
successful test (deciding that the decoction sequence used in that batch
was the biggest difference between it and the others).


Everything went fine except that the color of the final batch appears to
have come out about a shade or two lighter than I had intended. Normally
I wouldn't care, but this beer is for a big wedding party in late
September, hence I desire to make it as perfect as possible. So now I'm
thinking about whether I can still do something to modify the color. 


My choices thus far: take an ounce of Black Patent malt (which does not
require mashing and adds no unnecessary fermentables) and steep it in a
couple cups of hot water, strain and boil the water, cool and add it to
the carboys (there are two of them for this 10 gallon batch). Or, boil
the water beforehand, add the malt to it as it cools, strain and add to
the carboys. 


Has anyone tried anything like this before to provide color corrections
to a batch that's come out a little too light? Seems to me that it
should be safe (if the water has been boiled) and effective (if I use
enough malt).

A couple of years ago, the BATF issued a ruling that the "ice beer"

Actually, it doesn't sound as if you're doing anything wrong.
I have always followed the instructions on the back of the WYeast package
to make a starter.  However, I double the amount of water and DME, brings
it to 2/3 cup DME and 2 qt. water.
I use Clorox to sanitize everything and use hot tap water to rinse.  I
don't
force cool the wort, I just let is sit, covered, for a few hours in the pan
I boiled it in.
It takes anywhere from 18-48 hours to get the starter solution going,
depending on how old the WYeast was to begin with.
I also pitch the entire starter solution, not just the yeast slurry.
This has always worked for me :)
