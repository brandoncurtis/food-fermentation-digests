Subject: CP Bottle Filler Alternative?


Hello All,


This past April I was fortunate enough to run across a fellow homebrewer who
was looking to sell his kegging setup.  Six 5 gallon pin-lock kegs, a 20 lb
CO2 tank and a heavy duty regulator that was scrounged from a liquid oxygen
welding setup, and adapted for CO2.  The cost?  $140  Am I lucky or what?  ;-)


Anyway, the setup also includes an air chuck (like the kind used for filling
your tires with air at the gas station).  I finally got around to making a
couple of "carbonator"-type caps on the weekend out of two old plastic pop
bottle screw tops, a couple of valve stems, and a little food-grade
caulking.  Now I'm set to take some of my brew with me without having to
haul around a keg. BTW, total cost of the two caps I made:  $3.99 + tax (the
cost of the two valve stems).


This got me thinking about doing the same thing to a metal twist-off beer
cap.  Before I started kegging, I bottled all of my beer in the twist-off
bottles, and I still have them all.  Most competitions require that your
brew is contained in the standard brown glass bottles, and it is for that
reason that I was contemplating a CP bottle filler.  A carbonator-type cap
for twist-off bottles would certainly be easier and cheaper than a CP bottle
filler.  To bottle, I would simply fill the bottles from the keg, screw on
the adapted bottle cap, carbonate, remove the adapted cap, and cap the bottles.


Anyway, on to the questions:


Has anyone out there done this before?


Does anyone know how much pressure a standard (Canadian) twist-off brown
glass beer bottle can withstand?


To the CP bottle filler owners:  How much more do you have to carbonate a
beer when filling it?  i.e. the beer will lose some carbonation in the time
it takes to extract the CP bottle filler and cap the bottle.  How much
higher do you have to carbonate the beer to hit your target carbonation
level?  For instance, if I was bottling an IPA, and was shooting for 1.6
volumes of CO2 in the bottle, would I have to carbonate to, say, 1.8
volumes, then remove the cap with the valve stem, and quickly cap the bottle?


Any and all responses appreciated.  If there's sufficient feedback I will
post a summary of the responses.

Subject: Electric Brewing / Ice CF Chillers


Thor asks:


"Does anybody know what the relative efficiency of heating your brewery 
with propane, natural gas or electricity?"


Just a datapoint:  my 5-gallon electric boiler runs on 2250W; I've calculated
the heat loss at about 200W through the uninsulated sides, for roughly 90%
efficiency.  If I wrapped a layer of fiberglass around it (as well as the
lid), I bet I could get real close to 100% efficient.  My electric vessels
are on for about 3 hours total; at 14 cents per kW-hr (yep) this costs me
about $1 per brewday.


How this compares with gas setups, I don't know.


Note:  using electricity for volumes over 5 gallons gets tricky, since the
already-high power requirements increase for increasing volume.  To get
reasonable heating times, you'll need lots of electric elements as well as
lots of amps.  See the article on my web page, "Five-Gallon Plastic Electric
Brewery", for details.


*****


The topic of ice-bucket CF chillers has arisen.  I don't use one (though I do
circulate ice water through my immersion chiller with a pump) but I can offer
a couple thoughts.


After you fill the bucket with ice, add enough water to cover at least part
of the coil.  While this robs the ice of some of its cooling power as the
warmer water melts it, it puts the entire coil surface in contact with cold
WATER (as opposed to the AIR between ice chunks) for greatly improved
cooling.  Without the water, the ice will eventually melt and form water, but
you'll get much faster cooling up front if you add water.


Also, try tossing a small submersible fountain pump into the bucket.  They
can be had at home & garden stores for around $20 - $25.  No need to atttach
any hoses; just get the water circulating inside the bucket.  You'll again
get drastically improved chilling.  Thought:  mount the pump to the bucket
such that the discharge goes around the coil opposite of the wort flow.  True
counter-flow operation.


After saying all this, I remember a friend who used one of these (with a
circulating pump) and had to cut back on the ice since his wort was exiting
at 40F!

Subject: Batch Sparging / Newbie All-Grain Questions


Jon Bovard writes about a "New contraversial sparging method":


"I know of many German breweries and a local micro which uses a method of
sparging similar to that of some English breweries, but with a twist.
Once recirculation has completed. The bed is 90% drained and filled with
water at around 80C. Once this covers the grain bed the mash is then
stirred like mad . This supposedly encourages sugars into solution and
increases efficiency.The mash is left to settle for 15 minutes and then
re-circulated once again. The process is repeated until enough wort is
colected or pH>6 etc ect.
My question is ( I plan to try this) will mixing the mash bed so
violently cause irreversible damage. ie Leaving it almost undisturbed
for 1.5 hours beforehand creates a preety decent bed.??"


Nothing "new" or "contraversial" (sic) here.  This is what we've been calling
"batch sparging" here.  That is to say, the sparge water is added in batches
rather than trickled in during runoff.  There are several positive
implications:


(1) Channeling is a non-issue, since for each runoff, assuming the batch has
been rested and stirred well, the runoff is always of the same gravity since
no "clear" water is added durring runoff.  


(2) Back-of-envelope calculations as well as anecdotal evidence suggest this
method, even with only one sprage batch after initial runoff, can be AS or
even MORE efficient than traditional trickle or "fly" sparging.  Think of the
sparge batch as a mash-out, thinning and collecting the wort trapped in the
grain.


(3) The method lends itself well to brewers who don't have space/money for a
three-tier system, since the sparge water is dumped in all at once.  No need
to place a sparge vessel above the mash tun for sparging.  Recirculate and
slowly drain your first runoff, then put your mash tun on the kitchen floor,
pour in some 175F water and away you go (after a brief rest & recirculation).


(4)  If properly planned, the technique can be used to efficiently produce a
lower volume of higher-gravity wort, which suits stovetop brewers well.
 Vessels smaller than 5 gallons are much cheaper and the typical kitchen
stove will have a much easier time heating & boiling.  Brewing with
concentrated wort is just like brewing with extract.  Top off to volume in
the fermenter with sanitized (boiled/cooled) clear water.


(5)  For a two-runoff process, the gravity of both runoffs is well above
1.010; this coupled with the presence of wort at low pH prevents tannin /
phenol extraction associated with low-gravity / high-pH sparging.  George Fix
reported some time ago that a single-runoff brew had "yummy malt flavor",
quite possibly because far less objectionable material was extracted than
when using traditional low-gravity / high-pH sparge water.


One downside I can think of is that since you're draining off the liquid in
the grain bed, it can collapse upon itself and cause a stuck runoff.  This is
probably only a problem with heavy, gummy mashes like those with lots of
wheat or corn.


As for the 1.5 hour old bed being disturbed, it's not of course an issue for
the first runoff, since only a recirculation is performed and the bed is not
disturbed.  As for the second runoff, the rest period (you mentioned 15
minutes) plus judicious recirculation will ensure a clear runoff after
stirring.


I have a batch-sparging spreadsheet & accompanying text on my web page, for
anyone interested in the details.


*****


Doug Moyer wants to all-grain (all right Doug!) and has a few good questions:


"(1) At what rate should I expect the liquid to run off? Yes, I know that
mileage varies, but what range am I shooting for? I want to make sure
that my manifold isn't designed completely wrong. Is 6 minutes/gallon
reasonable? (I haven't put any grain in it yet--I'm just running water
through it.) "


6 min/gal sounds pretty good; puts you in the 30 - 45 minute range for 6 - 7
gallons of sparged wort.  Some will say longer is even better, which probably
has some truth, but it depends on how much extraction your time is worth.
 Note that your water-only rate is likely to be higher than your mash-runoff
rate, though this depends on the manifold design.  Thus, your actual mash
runoff may be much slower than 6 min/gal.


"(2) What is the normal method to recirculate the first runnings to build
up the filter bed? How do you prevent HSA? How do you keep the
temperature constant? Do you care at that point? (FWIW, I will NOT be
buying a pump yet. Of course, who knows about next week... %-) )"


Use a 2-cup measuring cup to collect the recirc, then pour this *gently* back
onto the grainbed -- no splashing or excessive churning.  I place a
cut-to-fit sheet of 8-hole-per-inch nylon needlepoint mesh over the grainbed
(it actually floats) and pour the recirc slowly onto that -- it breaks up the
force of the pouring liquid to avoid mucking up the grain bed, and
distributes the recirc fairly evenly across the top of the bed.  Because of
the size of the measuring cup, it's difficult to pour in the middle of the
tun; pouring with too much force down the side of the grain bed can encourage
channeling and reduce efficieny.  HSA?  Maybe a bit; you can't totally avoid
it.  But if you're careful, it won't show up in your beer.  Your temperature
will drop somewhat during this process, as the recirc'd wort is exposed to
room temp, so a mash-out at 165+ is helpful (though often not practical in a
five-gallon cooler; see #3 below).


(3) How much grain can you mash in a 5 gallon Igloo?


Here's a rule of thumb:  grain occupies 0.08 gallons per pound when combined
with water (that is, no air between grits).  At a typical mash thickness of
1.33 qt/lb, you can squeeze about 12 lb of grain and water into a five-gallon
cooler, but don't expect to do temperature boosts or mashout with boiling
water infusions -- there ain't no room.


Though you said that you already bought your 5-gallon Gott, for anyone else
planning on going all-grain, I suggest the new (?) 7-gallon Gott.   At Home
Depot here in El Paso it's the same price as the 5-gallon ($20).  It appears
to be the same diameter as the 10-gallon (the lids are interchangable, and
yes I put them back where they were after I checked), so a 10-gallon Phil's
Phloating Phalse Bottom would work if you wanted to go that route.  This will
hold enough grain to make moderately-high gravity brews and still allow
multiple boiling water infusions for step mashing & mashouts.  I'm a-gonna
get me one.


"(4) Several people have mentioned mashing in the range of 1.25 qt/gal.
If you are doing several step infusions, do you start with a thicker
mash to make up for the boiling water added later?"


Yeah, that's the idea.  You probably won't be able to work with a thickness
much below 0.9 to 1 qt per pound, so figure on starting there for your
dough-in.  Also, try to avoid mash rests above 2 qt/lb; the thin mash
reportedly can reduce enzyme efficiency.  Dilute mash thickness is OK for the
mashout step since enzyme action is not relevent.


And if you're still trying to figure out how to set up a three-tier system,
consider batch-sparging as described above.

I want to filter uncarbonated beer at room temp though a 1 micron

(What I plan on doing is draining from my conical fermenter though the

Subject: Re: First Faltering Steps / More IPA Worship (from Matt)


Since doug didn't leave an email address, I will venture some answers to
his questions regarding 5-gal picnic cooler mash tuns.


1. - Runoff - generally, adjust the flow down to the slowest you can
stand, the theory being the slower the runoff, the more extraction you
receive - Check out the batch sparging vs. Fly sparging threads of a few
weeks ago for more info...


2. - IMHO, it dosen't matter much how you recirculate the first runnings
 - Although I try to minimize splashing when I recirculate about
1-2quarts of first runnings with a pyrex bowl from my system (A 5 gal.
coleman cooler with a rubber stopper, and a cheesy straight piece of
copper tubing with some hacksawed slots in the bottom)  It works OK,
about 26 points / lb, but I am thinking about upgrading for better
extraction, and more capacity (see 3 below)


3. I can get about 13-15 lbs of grain in the tun, assuming <1.25q/lb
initial mash thickness.  When I do this, I use a batch sparge technique
(Flush most of the first runnings, and refill with HOT water to bring
mash up to mash-out (168), leave for 15 mins, recirc, and sparge
remainder...


4.  Step mashing with a picnic cooler is tough - I usually use a 5 gal
pot for initial steps (I can add boiling water, and heat), then transfer
to cooler for final rest.


You should like your setup, although once you get your pump, you will be
looking for another pot that can heat your mash while recirculating, for
decoctions, just better overall temp control.  Just Brew it!

You mean for the sparge?  You want to collect 6.5 or 7 gallons
in about an hour.  You should have a valve of some sort to
control the run off.  
Which leads to your second question--recirculation.
I have a ball valve coming out of my sankey keg, which I use for
mash/lauter tun.  I pull the first runnings out of the valve (well,
the hose barb attached to the valve) directly with a qt. measuring
cup and pour them (gently) into the top.  When it turns clear,
I attach a hose which then lets the run off get to the bottom of
the kettle gently.

I have searched the HBD archives and cats meow for a clone recipe for Celis
White.
Each recipe starts with,"it doesn't taste like Celis but..."
Well anyone have any ideas? Celis claims the bill is 50/50 unmalted Texas 
wheat and malt.
Nothing specific on malt.
They say they use Williamette and Cascades. They publish gravities; 
IG 1048 FG 1009
Brooklyn uses alot of unmalted wheat in their BrooklynerWeisse. [sp]
Garrett Oliver from Brooklyn Brewing says he gets his Weisse bill to convert
with a high enzyme American malt mixed well with the unmalted barley, no
alpha amylase added. In fact, I offended Mr Oliver by asking if he uses added
enzymes. Anyone who has tasted Mr Olivers beers knows I didn't want to offend
him.
Ok I am ready for any help on this one. My previous attempts have been less
than glorious. 
According to Dilbert, the best way to get an engineer to work hard on a
problem is to tell him [her] it can't be done.  So maybe you can't make Celis
at home...

Isn't this the whole point of recirculating again after stirring -- i.e.
to re-establish the filter bed?  I don't see how anything could be
"irreversibly damaged" by stirring up the mash.


I guess the big question on my mind is, "why bother"?  Unless there's
some advantage in terms of *flavor*, doing all that extra work just to
get a couple extra points of extraction hardly seems worth it.  At a
commercial scale -- where you're dealing with tons of grain -- the cost
savings add up; but at the homebrew level, an extra $1 worth of malt to
make up for less-than-perfect efficiency is no big deal.

Consumption of too many bottles from a previous batch the day it was
brewed/racked?


I've encountered this syndrome personally on a couple of occasions.  I'm
pretty sure it's how I managed to turn what was supposed to be a batch

Congrats... all-grain is a blast.  There's no way I'd go back to extract
now.

OK, I'm a dedicated "Phil's Phalse Bottom" guy myself, so I don't have a
lot of experience with manifolds... but:


This seems slow to me.  Once you've got the grain in there, it will
likely slow down a lot, resulting in some pretty long sparges.  I think
you want to cut more (or larger) holes in the manifold, and regulate the
flow with some sort of valve on the outflow hose.

I lay a perforated pie tin on top of my mash, and pour the first
runnings into it using a Pyrex measuring cup.  Any method that avoids
cutting a "channel" into the grain bed with the wort you're
recirculating should work.


> How do you prevent HSA? 


Pour gently.


> How do you keep the temperature constant? 


Heat your sparge water hotter than the temperature you want to maintain
in the grain bed.  Exactly how *much* hotter you'll probably need to
determine by experiment.


> Do you care at that point? 


Not as much as during the mash.  During sparging, I generally try to
keep my grain bed between approximately 145 and 165F -- a pretty broad
range.

12 pounds should be manageable.  For really high gravity brews, you may
need to scale back to 4 (or even 3) gallon batches, especially if you
want to do multiple rests.

Yup.  Proteolytic enzymes supposedly work better in a thicker mash
anyway...


and another all-grainer-to-be, "David L. Thomson" <dlt`at`ici.net> asks:

Two smaller pots, with the hop additions split more or less equally
between them should work OK.  If (like me) you're brewing on the kitchen
stove, being able to use two burners is also a plus in that it cuts
heating times in half.


Another possibility would be to sparge only enough to collect about 4
gallons of runnings, and do a partial boil, just as you would with an
extract batch.  If you decide to try this, keep in mind that you'll need
to increase the grain bill by around 20%, to compensate for the lower
extraction efficiency...

In HBD #2487 Dave Burley says:

Actually I criticise the suggestion that it's a worthwhile rest at all. I'd
recommend you obliterate it from your library before children or other
innocents see it.

Nope, not at 122F, it'll hardly dent your hotbreak protein yet decimate
your heading and body pool.  Why reduce the pool of medium weight proteins
for no practical benefit?  You will not find amino starved malt unless you
make it yourself.  Frankly, I'm earnestly looking for good malt that's so
undermodified that a rest like this would be indicated.  The closest I'm
coming is to have a micro-maltings produce it (not likely soon).  Please
tell me if you find any.

This is a really wild conjecture.  Beating the 122F-Rest drum is bad enough
but this could upset novice brewers and start a panic.  There are other,
scarier hazards to brewing with even more substance: like wearing plaid! 
The biggest danger of a long hold at 122F is sorry beer.

That sounds like back-pedalling Dave, why the past tense?  Are such malts
no longer encountered?  Highly modified malts need no lower temperature
rests unless around 95-100F or 132-135F, if even.  You're lucky to conserve
the protein you're left with.

"Definitely necessary" - not.  Starch in flaked barley (flaked anything) is
gelatinized in the flaking process and freely available afterward. One
might hope to develop more medium molecular weight proteins by a rest at
132-135F from the protein left, but if I remember, you simply recommend a
flat rest at 122F, which is what I take issue with.

No, that's silly.  You're suggesting a worthless rest at 122F so you can
breeze through a really useful range, and expect benefit?  What if you
infuse to your next step?  Why not simply spend that rest time at the right
temperature?


Also, peptidase don't chop, they nibble from the ends, yielding amino acids
and tiny peptides.  The rest at 122F wouldn't "chew up" the matrix.  the
rest at 132-135F would have a chance, if it were even needed.

That's putting it over-positively, I wish I had occasion to use it, I
believe I'd know what I was doing.  It might have been put forward once as
a means to reduce chill haze from the heaviest medium MW proteins, by
obliterating the MMWP spectrum altogether, but that's so heavyhanded the
current literature is way beyond that.  You might want to reacquaint
yourself with the literature.


I don't know who popularized the rest at 122-125F (I suspect it was another
of my namesakes) but it's been repeated so many times without reflection
that it's recklessly taken as gospel.  I'm saying that it's not.

Subject: Predicting SG of First Runnings


Here's a grain bill for a barley wine I'm thinking about for this coming
weekend:


  1.00        lb.        Cara-Pils Dextrine       
  2.00        lb.        Cara-Vienne              
  1.00        lb.        Light Dry Malt Extract   
  2.00        lb.        Munich Light             
  0.50        lb.        Oats                     
  8.00        lb.        Pale Ale                 
  0.25        lb.        Roast Barley             
  0.75        lb.        Wheat                    


My plan is to take only the first runnings and make only 2.5 to 3 gallons of
finished beer. Question is, how do I predict the gravity of first runnings?
I use a rectangular ice-chest with slotted copper tubing manifold. I get
about 70% efficiency according to potential yield of each malt. This is
consistent over many batches in the last couple of years. Anyway if I load
it with 1.25 quarts of water per pound (just under 5 gallons) and I lose 1
pint per pound of grain (absorbed by grain), how do I figure gravity of
first runnings? I'll end up with about 3 gallons of first runnings by just
draining the mash tun. Any idea what the SG will be? I'll add 2 gallons of
water which'll boil off in 90 minutes to leave me with about 3 gallons. But
what will the SG be? SUDS predicts 1.124 but that's with a 3 gallon sparge.

     I hate to admit it, but this happens to me fairly often with both this 
     and (more often) with 2308 (Munich Lager).  I find that swirling the 
     carboy twice per day (or more) will allow the beer to finish.  I don't 
     know if it is because this releases CO2 (the toxicity demon) or simply 
     resuspends the yeast, but it works.
     
     Louis noted that the yeast was still viable (I guess you checked with 
     methylene blue?), so this should do the trick.  I have tried 
     repitching fresh yeast and found that it does not work as well as 
     swirling the carboy regularly (and is more work).

Having worked for an industrial gas producer for 11 years, and having

CO2 isn't used much in semiconductor manufacturing, but his comments
on CO2 are on the mark.  CO2 use in food is primarily in the
cryogenic - liquid - form, for use in food freezing.


For the other gases, there are often additional purification steps
done for the semiconductor ultrapure grades of gas, in addition to
vapor withdrawal from a storage tank's headspace.  There are also
special packaging, storage, and transportation procedures to keep
impurities to the parts per billion or parts per trillion level.


For many industrial applications, there are new membrane separation
techniques used in bulk supply settings for instances when purity
requirements can be relaxed.  However, I don't know of any cylinder
filling plants using membrane separated feedstock.


For medical grade O2, as well as breathing air, the main impurity to
watch out for is CO - carbon monoxide.  A few lungsful of CO can mess
up one's day.

     I have one of "The Stone" stones that I have occasionally used in my

     easy as not using it) but, as for being "worth the money", I don't

     many times, carbonation is carbonation regardless of the source 
     (forced vs. "natural", corn sugar vs. malt extract vs. kraeusening, 
     etc.)  The bubbles formed by the stone are certainly fine and perhaps 
     "creamy" but, since you don't (usually) just tilt the keg up and drink 
     from it like a glass, they wind up dissolving into the beer line any 
     other CO2 bubble.  I don't notice a difference once it hits the glass. 
     I'm thinking of getting an O2 setup and using the stone for aeration 
     of the wort prior to pitching where I *know* it will make a 
     difference.

     Hi all,
     
     John posted about the lack of aroma and flavor in a widget can of 
     Guinness.  This got me thinking about Nitro dispensing in general.
     
     I've noticed that some of my area brewpubs are now serving several of 
     their beers in the manner of Guinness:  Nitro mix with a restrictor on 
     the faucet.  This knocks the CO2 out of the beer and creates fine 
     bubbles, giving the beer a dense head and creamy mouthfeel.
     
     To my senses, it also deadens the aroma (and therefore flavor) of the 
     beer.  My theory (which is mine) is that with much of the CO2 knocked 
     out of the beer, the volatiles either go with it or are not carried to 
     your nose by the CO2, making it difficult to perceive the beer's 
     character.  Kind of a neat way to serve all-malt, dark brews with 
     little character to offend the masses.
     
     Has anybody else noticed this problem with beers served in this 
     manner?  Is anybody slightly offended by the unnatural character that 
     this serving technique creates?  I guess that all CAMRA members would 
     be, but what about the rest of the homebrewing world?

Well, before you go dissing the pub draught cans, you need to be aware
that there's actually more than one kind of Guinness Stout.  Draught
Guinness is designed to be a "session beer", and is actually fairly
light (in body, not in color).  Even in Ireland.  (I just returned from
a trip to Ireland less than 2 weeks ago.)  The stuff you get in the
bottles -- Guinness Extra Stout -- is a different animal.


Ever noticed that when a bartender makes up a "Black and Tan", the
draught Guinness goes *on the top*?  That's because its final gravity is
*lower* than the stuff in the bottom half of the glass (Bass Ale,
typically).


Though I've never done an actual side-by-side comparison, I'd venture
that the stuff in the widget cans is not too far off the mark, relative
to draught Guinness...

the ferment is almost completed 24 hours after that.  


This stuff goes like a bat out of hell!

I need a mail order firm with lots of good features.  I like Hoptech

things, but other things they do seem stupid.


I'm looking for a mail order firm that does/has the following:


1) reasonable prices - wyeast < $4.00/pack, used 5 gal kegs < $25


2) free shipping over $40-$50

4) sells malt extract in custom quantities (i.e. if I want to by 7.5#,
that's what they charge me for.  I don't like William's prepackaged 6#
bags).  LME should be about $1.80/#.

Texas, but they don't check their email and they suck over the phone.


Got any suggestions?  I'd rather not split orders between two places
(how else am I gonna get free shipping? :-)), but I may have to.


Thanks in advance!

What would be the best way to drill a 1.25" hole in the side of a stainless
steel 1/4 keg?  This in order to convert keg to an electric boiler w/
submerged heating elements a la Ken Schwartz's "plastic electric brewery"
(sans plastic).


Private email is fine.


TIA,
