I have done sour mashes and it usually takes at least 10 hours to get any
noticable souring (don't taste it before boiling or you could get ebola ;)
Sour mashing requires that you also bring down the temp and add more grain
in odrer to provide a environment for bacterial growth.  Overnight mashes
are fine, but I'm not sure how it will affect the size of the poly
saccharides in the beer.

I'd advise trying steam injection.  I used a design in Brewing Techniques
(don't have the issue off hand) which basically involved drilling a hole in
the top of a pressure cooker and threading it with pipe thread, then
screwing in a pipe thread to compression fitting and attaching some copper
tubing.  Then pinch the end of the copper off and drilled some small holes
in the last few inches.  I put a valve inline on the copper tubing, to turn
the steam on and off.


Once the pressure cooker is heated up I just inject the steam directly into
the mash. My roommate and I tend to get about .5 - 1 degree per minute
tempurature rise in a 5 gallon batch.


We then use a five gallon insulated soda-keg for a hot liquor tank--when
the mash temp has been reached and the steam isn't needed for the mash, we
remove the steam line and inject the steam into a full soda-keg, raising it
to sparge water temp.  This way we don't need to use the kettle for a hot
liquor tank.  When its time to sparge, I just close the keg up and hook it
up to a CO2 line, which gives me an easy way to control the sparge flow
rate using the pressure regulator. Plus the kettle is empty so it all has a
place to go.


(The soda keg is insulated with a jacket made of wet suit material made by
a company called Below Forty.  It was a little pricey ($25) but we've been
happy with it.  It's obviously equally good at keeping a soda keg cold.)

Hi All,


  I was recently looking through the ads in the back of the latest Brewing
Techniques and noticed a book from the American Brewers Guild titled
"How to open a brewpub or microbrewery".


 Has anyone seen or read this book?  Could you provide me with a brief
review?  Is this 260 page book worth the $159 (plus $7 S&H) price?
Anyone have a used copy for sale?

Subject: Mash temp at sparge


There has been some discussion lately of the importance of keeping the
mash temperature high throughout the sparge in order to achieve good
extraction.  This makes some sense to me but this past weekend I
inadvertently violated this practice.  I use a cylindrical 10 gallon
Igloo for a mash/lauter tun with a Phil's Phalse Bottom.  Last weekend
I forgot to replace the protective copper pipe I usually put around the
vinyl tube from the Phalse bottom to the bung.  As a result, the
tube got kinked, stopping the runoff.  After screwing around for a long
time I finally figured something was wrong in my tun and siphoned off the
liquid and dipped out the grain.  After fixing the problem I replaced the
grain and liquid.  By this time the grain bed temp had fallen to 120-130F.
My sparge water was still hot but the runoff was not.  In spite of all this
I got my usual 75-80 percent extraction rate.  Any comments?

Jonathan Bovard asked about sparge water temps necessary to raise the grain
bed temp. in today's HBD.


I usually drain some of the first runnings, bring them to a boil and add
them back to the cooler for mashout.  I've found that with 10 lbs of grain,
pulling 2 gallons to boil will raise the mash temperature to right about
168F from a 150F saccharification rest.  I usually get about 75%
efficiency, fwiw.


This weekend I tried a batch sparge, which among other things, seems to
obviate the need for mash out.  Draining the first runnings and then adding
near boiling sparge water (I brought it to a boil and then turned off the
heat.  I think it was around 180-190F) for a 15-min rest raised the grain
bed temp, which seems like all that is needed for a mash out, even if it
didn't benefit the first runnings.  All in all, it seemed much easier than
slowly pouring sparge water quart by quart into the top of the tun for 45
min to an hour, and efficiency was pretty comparable to my usual system,
with 1.058 actual vs 1.060 expected (which is probably less of a difference
than the margin of error of my hydrometer anyway).


I also tried the starter-in-a-carboy method someone (sorry I forgot your
name) asked about last week.  I did a 1 quart starter in the bottom of the
carboy  I planned to ferment in, shaking vigorously at first and from time
to time as I passed by for the first 12 hrs or so.  I pitched 7.5 mL of
Wyeast 1056 slurry saved from the secondary of my last batch.  It sure
seemed to produce a much larger volume of yeast sediment than the same size
starter in the 1.5L wine bottle I usually use.  I may have misunderstood
the directions, but even after tilting the carboy to let the yeast collect
on one side of the bottom, I seemed to lose a lot when decanting before
siphoning in the wort.  Nonetheless, fermentation began fairly quickly,
from pitching at 10pm to kraeusen at 6:30 the next morning when I got up.
Next time I think I'll put the carboy on its side and tilt it so that the
yeast is collected at the shoulder of the carboy rather than the bottom, in
hopes of having more of the yeast end up in my wort.

Subject: Hoppy Micro Beers?


Chas Writes in part...
Now, I do not object to a hoppy, assertive brew,
but I guess I'm just getting a little bored with brewpub/micro that offer only
this characteristic in their brews.  The brewpubs and micros I enjoy the most
are the ones that offer not just the hoppy IPA, Amber, whatever, but use
unique malts/processes/yeasts/adjuncts to offer variety too.  I mean, how many
times have you seen the Blonde, Pale, Amber, Porter, Stout taster line-up in
front of you, all screaming hops?...


Yes, I have seen this line up too many times as well; however, it is a rare 
occation to drink a micro's pale ale or even their IPA and have enough hop 
profile. They have the malt profile, just not enough hops to balance it 
properly. I believe they brew this as to apeal to the mass customer base of  
beer drinkers afraid of the "bitter beer face". 
To all the micro brewers out there... Don't be afraid, it's ok to use hops!

Brewsters:

>Actually I criticise the suggestion that it's a worthwhile rest at all.
I'd

Well, Charley, I would like to see the evidence
 from which you formed your opinion, since most
 of the commercial brewing world, as far as I know,
  and all of the authors I know of say that a 122F(50C)
  rest is suggested and is practiced.


I know that there have been some comments here
 to the effect that malting has changed drastically
 recently, I doubt it sincerely and would like to see
 some real evidence to that effect.


  How about some molecular weight distribution on
 protein levels in the various malts to prove your point?

 =


>The biggest danger of a long hold at 122F is sorry beer.


Maybe you should try reading some
 professional literature instead of =


characterizing my comments as "wild conjecture".


I quote from Malting and Brewing Science


1st ed. p216:


"Mashing for *long* periods at low temperatures
 favours proteolysis and produces worts with
 levels of  formol nitrogen in excess of those
 required for adequate yeast growth. << Consequently
 either an overgrowth of yeast may occur or a
 tendency to contamination by other organisms
 in the beer may result.  Also beer flavour may be altered.">>


My  comment which you characterized
in such a demeaning way almost sounds like a quote from this.


I also direct your attention to  M&BS table 8.11 which compares
 undermodified (u) malts with well modified (m) malts
 and various hold schedules:


=46rom this table 8.11, taking the *difference* in the
% total soluble nitrogen and the % amino nitrogen
in worts( which I believe is an imperfect indication
of the mid-molecular weight protein
  since it includes the hot break) yields this table:


Mash process:


T profile                u                 m
122F,152.5 F   .586           .596
96,122F,149    .614           .604
154.5                 .675           .575
95,122,152.5   .653           .588 =




All were mashed out at 169F


Interestingly the one mash profile which fits your
 recommendation of "no 122F hold" has the *least* amount
 of mid-molecular weight protein with highly modified malt.         =




=46rom Table 8.11, looking at the kg of sludge on boiling (hot break):


T profile                u                  m
122F,152.5        11.5             13.6
95,122,149        13.6               9.9
154.5                  26.7             17.5
95,122,152.5    26.9             22.8


The first three processes were decoctions and the last a =


"modified Infusion Process" in which the holds
 were achieved with steam coils


In case you weren't clearly
 reading it the first time or two I wrote it.  A *short*
 hold ( 15-20 minutes) at 122F is my recommendation,
 followed by a 2 degree rise/min to 135F and a hold
 at 135F for 15 minutes ( longer if you wish)
 followed by going to saccharification temperature.


 I suggest you go back and re-read my earlier comments =


about the fact that most of the protein modification
 takes place at the maltsters and most of the
 carbohydrate reduction at the brewers.


Looking at the Graph 8.2 in M&BS in which malts
 were held At 120F and 150F for a total of three hours.
 Permanently Soluble nitrogen as
 a % of total nitrogen in the malt shows that
 at around zero time the % is 20%, indicating
 a well modified malt. As expected,
 the %PSN increases over time as more
 low molecular weight nitrogen compounds
 are formed. About an hour at 150F the curve
 flattens out and continues to climb at 120F BUT:


<<Most importantly, up to about  one hour =


 the 150F hold wort has *more* % p.s.n.
( that is low molecular weight protein and amino acids)
 than the 120F hold!>>


Also important is that the  amount of total nitrogen
 at the 150F hold always *leads* the 120F hold
 in total nitrogen based on Figure 8.3.


As I interpret this,  the actual low molecular weight
 protein content in the wort at any time up to 1 hour hold
 will be less at 120F than at 150F.


More to our Home Brew literature - Dr. Terry Foster
 suggests a 122F hold in both his books on
 Porter and Pale Ale. ( using highly modified British malts)
Having known Terry personally for a couple of decades, I
 know he does not make these suggestions lightly.
 I believe I have read here that George Fix
 recommends a 50C (122F) hold as part of his
 recommended temperature profile for mashing.  =




Charley Rich says:


>current literature is way beyond that.  You might want to reacquaint
>yourself with the literature.


Charley, please provide some current *professional* references.


>I don't know who popularized the rest at 122-125F (I suspect it was
another
>of my namesakes)


Hardly.  This mashing profile with a 122F hold =


has been around long before you were born
and has been and still is used by professionals,
as far as I know.


 Prove it otherwise.


> but it's been repeated so many times without reflection
>that it's recklessly taken as gospel. =




Charley, I only ask you to prove your point using
 real established data and professional literature,
 established molecular weight data in the malts, etc.
  with which you claim to be familiar. Let us all in on it.
 Provide some current references that prove your point
 and please do not continue to give us
 your unsubstantiated opinion.  =




One of your other namesakes, Charley Peterson puts
 in some data that says he doesn't even get a head
 with 100% wheat.  I found this incredible but
 then read his description of what he did and I understand.
 His decoction, followed by an overnight hold at 122F =


falling to 95F will totally destroy the mid-molecular weight
 protein and will not provide any lactic acid as
 the phosphatase will be destroyed by the decoction
 and 122F. These results do *not* support his contention
 that 122F is bad, rather they make the point that
 an abnormally long time at 122F is bad,
 with which I totally agree. =




For comparison, my 10% wheat beer using my short holds
 at 122F and 135F procedure has a thick compact head =


and leaves rings down the glass which stay to the end
(until I wash the glass) as do  my pure barley malt beers. =




BTW. Please direct your comments to the facts
 and avoid any personal stuff - OK?


I really only want to know the truth not prove
I'm right or wrong and I hope you
are of the same mind.




Keep on brewin'

Subject: Cold break separation




Dear homebrewers:


I prepared my first all grain batch and used an immersion chiller for the
first time too. As soon as boiling was over, I started to cool the boiling
liquid down. I went to 28C in no longer than 7 minutes. I noticed a big
cold break. I thought that I had succeded in my attempt to separate the
cold break from the liquid, thinking that the trub would precipitate
immediately. However, it did not separate and I decided to siphon the
whole liquid (including the cold break) to the fermenter. I pitched it
immediately and fermentation started about an hour later. It fermented
during two days and stopped. I think I would follow the usual procedure;
rack it to the secondary, priming and bottling in about two weeks


I have a question at this point. Next batch, how can I separate the cold
break from the liquid so as to siphon just clear liquid to the fermenter
and pitch immediately? Should I separate it in the boiling kettle or
should I use some kind of filtration? Would there be any problem with my
wort considering that cold break was included in the fermenting liquid?

Subject: Re: Overnight mash - summary 


Thanks to Ian Smith and Jacques Bourdouxhe who replied to my earlier
inquiry about the advisability of overnight or extended mashes. Here is a
summary for those interested.  The information is from the above and
searches of the hbd annals, particularly notes from David R. Buckley, Todd
Gierman, Russ Gelinas, William Kitch.


Possible advantages: Convenience - could divide your brewing up into 2
spells, which might make it possible to brew on a working day without being
a wreck in the morning. Also there are reports of successfully mashing and
sparging on one day and completing the other steps on the next day.


Possible disadvantages: Grain bed temperature - this will drop (unless it
is maintained by a heat source), so extraction may suffer (unless heat is
applied before sparging). Infection - this is the biggest concern, and
lactobacillus is the main suspect.  This bacteria is present in the air and
on grain hulls.  In fact, some beers are made by sour mashing (the intended
introduction of a slight sour taste from lactic acid produced by
lactobacillus), and this has been achieved by steeping the grain for about
24 hours at about 100F.


Despite the potential danger of infection, overnight mashes generally seem
to work just fine. This is probably because the times and temperatures
usually used are not sufficient to get a significant infection going.  Of
course, once the wort is boiled the organism is dead. Brewers of sour
mashes typically innoculate their beers with a lactobacillus starter in
order to get the desired taste, as a slightly extended mash does not do the
job. While the danger of an infection increases with the duration of mash,
other factors that probably favor infection are brewing in the summer and
using simple infusion mashes that rapidly cool down.  The least danger
occurs in winter or with mashing techniques that maintain the mash
temperature near its original value.

I'm about to try a Raspberry Bavarian Wheat, what we did is collect the fruit 
and then juice them using a steam juicer. I'm a little concerned about losing 
some aroma because of the steam, but having sampled some of this concentrate 
I'm hopeful for a good brew. I've got a good 3 litres of concentrate, I think 
that may be too much . . . (from about 3 ice-cream pails of berries, 12 
litres).


We'll see.

Yes, I've done it. I never noticed any problem with the beer, but it was a 
heavy beer, not a Weizen. I got it out with a little bit of trouble, i hefted 
the carboy upside down until the stopper had the hole accessible with a coat 
hanger. Put coathanger (hooked end) into  hole and pull. Takes a bit of time 
but it works.

David J. Vanness asks about the 40/60/70 mash schedule. A collection of the
original posts by George Fix can be found at Dave Draper's homepage at
<http://hbd.org/~ddraper/beer/fixmash.txt>.


I use a version of this schedule with rests at 40/63/71C. The advantages
are higher extraction because of the 40C rest (or so it seems, I have not
done a side-by-side test or anything) and better control of fermentability
by adjusting the times at 60/70C. I use pale ale malt mostly, and a typical
schedule would be:
    thick mash in at 40C, rest 20 min
    infuse with boiling water to 63C, rest 30 min
    heat to 71C (I mash in a kettle on the stove), rest 45 min
    heat to 77-78C, mash out for 10-20 min (while preparing the lauter tun).


If I want a drier/sweeter finish I increase/decrease the time spent at 63C.
I think its important to minimize the time spent between 40 and 60/63C, to
avoid too much breakdown of proteins.

In HBD#2493, Ian Smith asks:


>Should I invest in a PH meter or just use the ColorPhast papers ? Does 
>anyone have any advise/experience ?


I'm a chemist.  At work I use a $500 pH meter, but brewing at home I use
ColorpHast strips.  Unless you have an urgent need for a new gadget, I'd
encourage you to stick with good quality multi-indicator strips like
ColorpHast.  


While you can find cheap ($50-100) pH meters for sale, my experience is
that they will break after about 6 months, and aren't all that accurate.  A
decent meter will cost $200 minimum.  To get accurate readings out of it,
you need to calibrate against 2 standard buffers each day you want to use
it, scrupulously clean the electrode after each use, store the electrode
immersed in saturated KCl between uses, and expect to replace the electrode
every year or so. For most people, it just isn't worth the bother and expense.


ColorpHast strips are cheap, and once you're used to using them, accurate
to +/- 0.5 pH units.  The multiple indicator zones make them easy to read.
Avoid cheaper strips or papers that use a single indicator; these are much
less accurate and much harder to read.

     Steve Scott asked wether or not he should use a lid during the boil.
     
     Dave in Dallas replied that he does not, but stated that using a
     lid would result in less heat loss.
     
     The reason to leave the lid off, as I understand it, is to allow
     various unwanted volatile compounds to vent to the atmosphere.  The
     compound that comes to mind is DMS -- which supposedly tastes like
     cooked corn.  If you leave the lid on, this stuff can't escape and 
     you end up with cooked-corn beer.  
     
     OK, being a liberal-conservative, I'm going to take middle ground.
     I boil with the lid partially on.  The reason I use a lid at all is,
     as Dave stated, less heat loss.  The electric stove in my apartment
     can barely boil 5 gallons of wort; by keeping the lid partially on,
     I can give it a little break.

Brewers,


I brewed 10 gal of 70%British Malt 30%Malted Wheat 
Saturday Aug 23rd.  I pitched 1 had a starter in a 
22oz bottle of Wyeast 1056 and another of Wyeast 
3056 which I pitched into separate carboys.  Both 
carboys were active within 6 hours and very active 
within 12 hours.  After 24 hours the 1056 continued 
as usual but the bubbling from the 3056 had stopped.  


Both are at the same temp, about 68F.


There was a tremendous, and dense krausen covering 
the 3056 batch. I gently swirled the carboy for 2
days, without any visible signs of activity.  Last
night I swirled the carboy more roughly, breaking 
the krausen free of the carboy wall, collapsing 
some of it back into the beer. Rapid bubbling 
resumed immediately and has continued for over 12 
hours.  


A few questions:
1. Was swirling the 3056 batch a good idea? 


2. Before swirling the carboy, was the 3056 batch 
   in good shape (even though I saw no bubbling)?


3. I refuse to worry about introducing nasties into
   the brew by collapsing the krausen, but is it 
   a valid concern?


4. What happened?

After reading the accolades of Unibroue products, and begging several
coworkers who happened through Canadian Provinces to procure me a case or so,
I have come up empty.
Can ANYBODY tell me where I might find this stuff short of driving to Montreal
myself?  I live in Kentwood, a subsidiary of Grand Rapids, MI, and I even sent
an e-mail to the Unibroue brewery asking where the closest distributor might
be.  I got no response.  I suspect nobody there speaks English, and I myself,
am monolingual.
If any Montrealean home brewers would like to set up an exchange, I'll send
you some quality American brews (Bud, Millers, you name it ;) ) in exchange]
Seriously, we could make a deal] Speaking of making a deal, if Jethro is
looking for work, he can let me know, and I'll pound the pavement here in the
GR area. We have a few reasonably good brew pubs, but we'd love to bring a
world class Brewmiester in] Rob- what line of work is your wife in?  We'll
find a career advancement for her too, if it gets you brewing in town.  I'm
not really a head hunter, but I play one...
 
Not to make light of Randy's unfortunate accident, but two years ago I read
either here or in RCB about a woman who dropped a carboy and lacerated her
leg. However, she made sure she got the chilled wort properly stored away
before she drove to the hospital for some stitches.  Such dedication to The
Craft is admirable and I believe she got several marriage proposals from the
forum.  Glad to here you weren't permanently harmed Randy, but did you save
the beer?
 
Ian asks about when to add specialty malts.  I'm sure you'll get lots of
responses, but since I'm already here- *Never* do you want to let starches get
into the fermenter]  I'm taking a chance using the "N" word, and maybe
somebody will find an example to the contrary, but 'till then, I'll
reiterate, NEVER let starch get into the fermenter.  OK, some might get in due
to insufficient mash techniques, but the only thing starch in the fermenter
does is provide growth media for bacteria.  I think it's a lot easier and
better toss crystal, chocolate, etc. in the mash with the rest of the
grains, and of course, Munich has to be mashed along with the Pale Ale and
Pilsner malts, rye, oats, pumpkin flesh, and what not.  The flavor components
will carry over into the sweet wort.
 
By the way, I just bottled my Punkin Head Ale last night, and the SG sample
(OG 1.055, FG 1.010) tasted like liquid pumpkin pie]  Recipe was posted
recently to the HBD.

     Hi all,
     
     Tom asks about Chambord, a chocolate/raspberry liqueur that was used 
     by Paul Sullivan in his NHC Gold medal-winning chocolate raspberry 
     beer.
     
     I know Paul, and have had that beer.  It is good to the extreme.  
     Using Chambord is a bit tricky, however.  The sugar in the liqueur 
     will ferment out if you don't take measures to prevent it from doing 
     so (and you don't want the sugar to ferment out).  This could range 
     from kegging the beer, adding the Chambord, force carbonating and 
     keeping it at freezing, or actually CP filling from a fresh keg and 
     pasteurizing the bottles.  You could just mix it at serving time, too, 
     I suppose.
     -----------------------------------
     Frank writes in complaining that his Weizen is too clear because the 
     lager yeast flocculates too well.  I will answer his query with 
     another:  why do add lager yeast to your Weizen?
     
     Most (not all) German breweries do this because the lager yeast is 
     (supposedly) more stable and will also floc better, forming a tight 
     cake at the bottom of the bottle.  These are important factors if you 
     are shipping your beer and want it to have a long shelf life.
     
     At home, I can't really think of a reason to do this.  Schneider 
     Weisse, arguably one of the best HefeWeizens in the world, bottles 
     with the original fermentation yeast.  Why shouldn't homebrewers?  
     (Yes, Schneider's yeast can be cultured; it is also multi-strain).
     
     I think the AHA's "mixed style" classification creates some 
     unnecessary confusion with this style.
     ------------------------------------
     Ian asks about ColorpHast pH strips and pH meters.  I have both.  I 
     use the strips.  They are almost always faster, easier, and neater 
     than the meter.  They need no calibration, are accurate enough, and 
     aren't too expensive ($15 US per 100, but that lasts a while), and 
     don't break when you drop them.
     
     pH meters are fragile, need to be calibrated EVERY day that you use 
     them, are expensive, and the porous glass junction can become gunked 
     up if you are not careful about taking pretty clean samples.  You also 
     need to buy calibrator solutions, electrode filler solution, etc.
     
     There are solid state pH probes now, but they are very expensive.  I 
     suspect that I would like one of them better than the strips, though 
     (you can measure the pH of semisolids with them!  What fun!).
     
     While on the topic of pH measurement, remember to take a small sample 
     of the liquid to be measured and discard it after the measurement.  
     Don't just stick the meter/test strip in the mash.  Why would you want 
     to drink the chemicals that are in/on these tools?  Sure, there isn't 
     much, but it's still kind of gross.
     
     Also, pH meter electrodes are fragile.  To break it in the mash/wort 
     would really be a drag!
     
     Have fun!

Dave in Dallas replied to Steve Scott's query as to whether
to have the lid on or off and why.


One that Dave left out:


Di-Methyl Sulfide (DMS) reduction.


S-Methyl Methionine is formed during the malting
process, which is then converted to DMS during
the boil.  DMS is volatile, which means it can
be carried off with the steam during the boil.


If the lid is left on, the DMS can't go anywhere
and you'll likely end up with a cream-corn or
cooked vegi taste.


So boil with that lid off (unless you like that
kind of taste).  If you can't achieve a good
roiling boil with the lid off, I guess
partially off is the next best thing.

As I told Hans in Email, this was my sticking problem, but I found
that if I stopped the recirc after dough-in, stirred thoroughly, and
then turned the pump back on at low, the problem was solved.


I run my 1/8hp pump at about 5GPM when doughing in and dump the grain
into the water stream.  During dough in, I do not use a return
manifold, but a "J" shaped copper pipe that allows a single high force
liquid stream to be used to wet the grain.  I put all my foundation
water in, raise it to temp and then add the grain slowly.  I use 1.1
qts. per lb. plus a single fixed gallon quantity to account for
equipment volume.


And the only time I ever got the holes in the false bottom plugged
with grain was when I ground it too fine.

Subject: CaraMalt vs Crystal


What if there were no rhetorical questions?  ;-)


Can anyone explain the difference (if any) between the Belgian caramel malts
(CaraVienne, CaraMunich, etc) and say British crystal malt of similar color?
 I assume that different base malts are used, but are different processes
used, or are they pretty much the same animal?  For example, if I made two
ales using identical base malt, but in one I used 60L crystal and in the
other I used CaraMunich, what differences between the finished beers might I
expect?

Jonathon, et al...


Not to worry about the Sulfur from the Yeastlab Bavarian.  The
Bavarian Lager yeasts are notorious fro throwing a whopping sulfur
blowoff during the early and most active stages of its fermentation.
It sounds like you probably grew up a pretty healthy culture, and
things got off to a bang-up start.  If you are cranking along in the
45-50F range, you should notice the sulfur backing off and eventually
departing altogether.


This is not so much a factor of the producer (Yeastlab) as the
strain.  YeastLab's strain is very active, and therefore the sulfur
note is more obvious than with other strains available.
Give it a respectable cold lagering, and you should be very pleased.

Subject: peristaltic pumps (botulism, ATF, 122 or 135, also!)


Hey There,


I have obtained a peristaltic pump to use in a RIMS-type setup--using a 
the hot liquor tank to adjust the wort temp.  It has variable speed 
control and will move about 500-1000 ml/min at top speed.  The main 
advantage I see is that the beer will never 'see' the pump head, as the 
beer is pushed through the clear flexible tubing (Tygon) by the rotating 
stainless steel rollers on the pump head.  Does anyone out there have 
any experience or advice about using this type of pump in a RIMS system?

P.S. Re: title, I heard that either '122 or 135' 'ATF' agents contracted 
'botulism' at a picnic.  Any conformation?
