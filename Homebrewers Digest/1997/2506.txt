Subject: A 122F Surprise Indeed - No Head


In all the merriment I don't think anyone touched on the principal reason
for doing the 122F rest. The 122F rest is mainly to prevent amino-starved
worts in mashes high in adjuncts, which, because they are unmalted, don't
contribute a share of dietary amino acids needed for healthy yeast. 


Unmalted adjuncts dilute the free amino nutrient (listed as free amino
nitrogen or FAN) provided by the base malt. They yield a lot of sugar for
the yeast but they don't provide enough FAN to sustain reproduction. Even
european pils malts by themselves provide adequate FAN for a no-adjunct
mash.  But cut the grainbill with a lot of corn or unmalted wheat and you
reduce the percent of nitrogen in the wort directly.  A grainbill with 20%+
unmalted wheat, or corn (maize), pumpkins etc. can thin the nutrient pool
to a risky degree.
  
Note that North American 2 and 6-row malt is loaded with FAN and so can
take
heavy dilution, see Jeff Renner's Classic American Pilsner, but low-FAN
malt doesn't take it as well. So, the 122F rest can come to the rescue by
developing more amino acids and peptides - but at the expense of heading,
body and mouthfeel. 


If one is mashing a no-adjunct bill or a very low-adjunct bill (5%), even
euro-pils malts can safely skip the 122F rest - and should - where even a
twenty-minute rest there will appreciably ding your heading.  If more
heading, body and mouthfeel are wanted, and who doesn't - a protein rest
above 131F will develop it further.  If you don't like losing some of your
MMWP because a 122F rest is needed, you can recover some of your losses by
another rest above 131F. Say 132F-138F.


When mashing with adjuncts, because they are unmalted you can also
introduce raw gums (glucans) to the mash, increasing its viscosity and
hampering easy
runoff.  In the recent Brewing Techniques, May-August 1997, 'Advancement:
Step Mash for Customized Worts',  Jim Busch lists 99F-113F as the optimum
glucan rest temperature.  Note that although this temp is also sometimes
used for an acid rest it does not appreciably change pH after dough-in
until after several hours, even in distilled water.  See for yourself.


========================================
Follow up on kitchen protein experiments: Procedure change - Resting the
decanted liquid instead of keeping it in the grain skews the results,
although it  demonstrates the hit that 122F takes, it doesn't show all the
gains from a rest at 132F or higher.  More MMWP (heading proteins) develop
as more protein comes into solution at the higher temperatures. Doh!


========================================
Burner efficiency tip:  I used aluminum roofing flashing for a cheap,
simple thermal jacket around the bottom half of my kettle and it cut my
time to reach boling almost in half.  To keep it evenly spaced, I snipped
1-inch diagonal cuts along the top, every five or six inches, then bent the
triangular tabs inward, pointing toward the kettle.  The tips just touch
the sides of the kettle holding the jacket about an inch away all around.
I held it together with pop-rivets but paperclips would probably do.


========================================
Ken Schwartz (thanks for the Son of Fermentation Chiller, too) re: resting
at higher proteolytic ranges skewing saccharification. You can tune the pH
for the conversion you want, say pH 4.8 for proteins in a thick mash (0.8:1
to 1:1), then later, infuse with water to raise the pH and thin the mash
for a saccharification favoring mash.


Re: SoF Chiller, A wood rasp dresses foam board nicely, a bandsaw even
better.  I can keep 45F in my 75F garage.  Clorox bottles are tougher than
milk jugs.
========================================
Bucket-of-stuff dehumifiers happen to use Calcium Chloride.  Bags of refill
are $1-2.00 ea.
========================================
Re:LBarrowman's nice summary in #2503,  
"4) pH Adjust after mashing" - if you plan a protein rest you might wish to
raise pH after the rest instead of before.  Proteolytic enzymes like low
pH.
"7) Calculate" - Malt spec sheets report numbers on a "dry basis" (0%
moisture) which is theoretical and makes the numbers look impossibly good.
========================================
Mike Spinelli and 4# of oats in a 20 gallon batch.  I use a glucan rest at
105F with oats, but oats can give a slippery mouthfeel if overused.  I
might keep it down to 2-3# .

Andy,

Ian Smith asks:


>Does anyone know when the Great American Beer Festival starts this year ?


Yes, it starts on Thursday Oct. 2, and runs through Sat. Oct. 4. You can
get more info on the AOB web site at www.aob.org/gabfframeset.htm


This is going to be my first year at the GABF. I'm really looking forward
to tasting a lot of great beers that I have only read about. (Florida has
some really restrictive bottle laws that severely limit the brands sold
here - this law was put through for the benefit of the big brewers, that's
one of my biggest complaints about the budmilloors crowd).


I know that probably a lot of you are also going. Any interest in having an
HBD get-together at a nearby pub after one of the sessions? Maybe after the
Thursday members-only session. They are going to announce the winners early
this year. It would be great to meet you guys, put faces with the names
we've come to know, you all seem like friends that I'd love to hoist a pint
with and discuss the winners. 


If any of you are interested, and especially if you've been to the fest
before and can suggest a good, close location with interesting beer - I'd
love to hear from you.

However, no clear definition has come to light in regards to the "Butt"
portion of the equation! Pardon my French, I just don't seem to get the
connection in relationship to the use of the word "Butt" in this context.
Where's the Oxford English Dictionary when you need it? TTYAL, ILBCNU!


well, I just went to Websters dictionary web site and found the following:


Function: noun
Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French botte, from Old Proven=E7al
bota, from Late Latin buttis
Date: 14th century
1 : a large cask especially for wine, beer, or water
2 : any of various units of liquid capacity; especially : a measure equal
to 108 imperial gallons (491 liters)


Some sources report that the phrase Entire Butt was popularized by
Harwood's younger brother Billy (Bubba) Harwood who was overheard to say:


               "I can't believe I drank the entire butt."


Michel, I hope that clears up your confusion.

How well would my "Bottle Bomb Berry Barleywine" be recieved?  After 5 mos. in
the bottle, three of the 10 bottles of raspberry barleywine were found (sob])
broken.  I chilled the rest, and opened one (over the sink).  I think it's
drinkable, but you gotta be fast.  I guess it should really be called:
"Bottle Bong Berry Barleywine".  Talk about old faithfull]  The shotglassfull
I was able to salvage tasted pretty darn good.  Not bad for my first gusher.
I've got one in the freezer for tonight- I hope that 12% and an SG of 1.025
(Before the infection) should keep it from freezing, and the temp should keep
it from gushing.  If not, my plans for the other bottles is to drill a 1/32"
hole in the cap and use the resulting beer laser to cut some rust off the ol'

Al, although I agree with and admire your philosophy, I think a more   
cynical, profit-motive viewpoint can safely be attributed to Total   
Beverage. Total Beverage is owned by Herbert Haft who used to run his   
retail empire with his son Robert. In the 80's, the Hafts were big   
players in the "hostile takeover" business. Herbert disowned Robert in a   
money/power struggle, then put another son, Ronald, in charge. Ronald   
wasn't enough of a yes-man, so he got disowned after a while. Herbert's   
wife Gloria then took the sons' side and ended up in a messy divorce. I   
think at one point the Hafts were on the cover of Kiplinger's and Soap   
Digest in the same week <g>.


Seriously though, I don't think the employees of Total Beverage are   
donating any of their time to the contest -- they probably expect to paid   
their usual hourly wage. The Total Beverage contest then, naturally has a   
higher operating cost than a contest run by a homebrew club, which is   
staffed by volunteers.

I have the same worries about thermometers. I think you have to calibrate
them every time you use them. In theory humidity and barometric pressure will
both have an effect on how dial themometers work. The guys at the brewery
calibrate with ice, EVERY time they brew. While a 5 degree won't have THAT
much effect on total gravity it will have a BIG effect on the body and
fermentability of the beer. My last stout had little body and a thin
mouthfeel, hence I called it a porter and people liked it better. This was
because I didnt calibrate my thermometer and thus mashed at 150 rather than
155 where I should have been. 


Calibration:
Get out a small adjustable wrench a tall glass of boiling water, and a tall &
wide glass full of crushed icecubes and cold water.  On the back of the dial
there is a nut. The nut is attached to the probe and the red indicator inside
the dial. Place the thermometer in a glass allow it to settle in then Hold
onto the nut and rotate the dial accordingly. I use 32F for the cold and 211F
for just previously boiling.


Siphoning:
Basically its the pits. I recommend you quit siphoning an break down and buy
an easy masher (tm) and install it in your kettle. You can try to build one,
if you live in a big city. In Jackson (pop. 60,000) my town, I cant find the
correct spigot for the keg sized one i'm trying to put together (HELP?). This
method is great, but you need to use at least a half oz of whole hops
somewhere other than dry hopping. If you dont the pellet hops will clog the
EM and make draining off a PITA.  Good luck,
***
Dave in Dallas,
 
Sounds like a good explanation to me. If you want to test the theory you
could always take it down to 32F dunk it in the neighbors pool, fish it out
and plug it in ;)
***
Iodine testing
Its been interesting reading other techniques for Iodine testing. I'd like a
formal discussion of these, If you send me a well written up "method" Ill
collect a few and publish them all at once for discussion. Here is what I was
taught at a club meeting.
Take a white porcelain dish. ( I use an upside down coffee mug Kept in the
fridge) and place into it a small sample of mash. Separate out a few bits of
grain that have no husk on them and after the sample has cooled to room temp.
Place a drop of iodine right on the grain bit. Observe the color change. If
it slowly turns brown black, keep going, your not done. If it only stains
Iodine color you might be done. Next find a bit that is embedded in a husk
and test it. Dont watch the husk just the grain bit. Iodine color=done,
black/blue=relax dont worry have another homebrew, rinse the plate really
well (iodine is a poison) and do it again 10 or so minutes later... Anybody
see anything wrong with this? BTW, I've been told there is no difference (in
as far as this testing procedure is concerned) in between the iodine you by
in the drugstore and the idophor we use for sanitizing. They can be used
inter changeably. Yes?
***
Irradiation. I'm really asking for it on this one...but...don't we irradiate
our food every day when we place it in the microwave? Couldnt you irradiate
your wort or even dry hops in the microwave and kill most of the beasties?
***
I have a friend who acquired a co2 tank from a defunct paintball shop. He
says the tank is quite full and that the dip tube goes all the way to the
bottom the tank so it uses the liquid portion of the co2 to refill paint
balls.  Since I don't think this is a desirable effect in homebrewing. I told
him to build box with a doughnut built in so he could safely mount the co2
tank upside down. Thus the dip tube would be in the gas mix not the liquid
mix. Anyone see any problems with this?
***
I went to the flagship store for Borders/Walden books last night and was not
only impressed by the homebrew selection, but also by the number of names I
recognized on the book spines! It seems I've read them all before...I wonder
where...Way to go people!!!!!

Subject: "Dumbing Down" of Craft Brewing


The assertion has been made here that the "dumbing-down" of craft beer is a
phenomenon with some very basic causes (e.g., $).  Mark Silva did an
excellent job in #2504 of showing that that is perhaps an oversimplification.
 I tend to agree.


To illustrate, I can point to our local beer economy.  El Paso is a Bud Lite
on Ice town.  Tecate is routinely served with an entire lime's juice dumped
into the can.  Miller Genuine Draft is considered "dark beer" by some
(seriously).  Some folks drink Shiner Bock smugly thinking they have in their
hands a fine example of traditional German brewing.


Our city's brewpub serves a standard lineup of straight-down-the-middle
styles:  Light Ale, an occasional Raspberry Ale, Amber Ale, Pale Ale, Brown
Ale, and the Stout and Porter take turns rounding out the selection.  The
Light Ale is the biggest seller.  All of these beers are nicely done, but
certainly are not extreme examples of the respective styles.   They have been
a successful restaurant since the 1970's and would probably continue to do
well with or without the brewpub.  But given the local palate, it would make
no sense to produce their beers in the envelope-pushing style of certain
craft brews from more beer-savvy regions such as the Pacific Northwest.


Their brewer has taken a somewhat different tack by presenting beer dinners
and microbrew tastings, bringing in micro and craft beer from around the
region.  While this might at first seem odd, to offer a competitor's beer in
such a manner, the goal is to challenge the patron to be more demanding in
his.her selection of beers, whether at this brewpub or elsewhere, and
hopefully to bring that new taste back to their restaurant for one of their
offerings.  As the head brewer says, "You wouldn't go to a restaurant and
order 'meat' or 'fish', so why order 'beer'?"  In the last two years the
local demand for better beers has resulted in an explosion of brand presence
in local bars, though availability is sometimes variable, as distributorships
have often been less than fair in their dealings with the publicans.


This is evident by driving a short clip up I-10 into New Mexico, where
suddenly even the smallest liquor stores have surprisingly-varied offerings
from the Southwest and the Northwest.  Tastes up the Rio are apparently more
demanding, and I know for a fact that New Mexico liquor distribution laws are
much more friendly than those here in Texas.  Forty miles north, in Las
Cruces, NM, a city of around 50,000, there are three brewpubs, compared to El
Paso's one in a city of 600,000.  Local tastes can apparently vary
drastically over short distances.


There is some conjecture that the homebrewing "fad" is on the wane because
the healthy supply of local brewpubs makes brewing your own a waste of time.
 I disagree with this, at least in my case, because I want more than just the
local pub's lineup of styles, and also because, well, I just like to brew.
 But there may be an element of truth here; the person tempted to try
homebrewing that lives down the street from a world-class pub is likely to be
disappointed in his first hopped-extract kit batch fermented with old Red
Star yeast at 80F in the middle of July.  I'd venture to say that homebrewing
as well as craft and import brews very likely fall into the "fad" category in
a demographic like El Paso.  I can see this in our club membership as well as
in the "beer-friendly" bars.


Is "dumbing-down" an evil or a necessity?  Both, and neither.  It's simply a
reaction to local markets.  Does America need thousands of microbrew labels
distributed nationwide, or does it make more sense to locally provide
according to local tastes?  We as serious homebrewers have a third option,
and so perhaps we can afford to be more critical of the marketplace.

How about plastic soda bottles.  My roommate and I just save all our
tonic-water bottles for the purpose of taking beer out to parks where no
glass is allowed.


There is also a product called the Carbonator, which is basically a cap for
a 2 liter soda bottle with a ball lock valve on the top.  You can use it to
force carbonate the beer after you fill the bottle. The cost $10-12, plus
you need a ball lock quick-connect for your CO2.


I don't have a Carbonator and my beer stays fresh in the plastic bottle for
a day or two, its just not quite as carbonated.

Subject: Hop plants / Post harvest questions


Well I recently harvested my first hop crop. I made a few mistakes and   
learned
quite a bit about growing your own hops. But now I have a couple of   
questions
and comments.


First a comment to any one interested in growing their own. I planted my   
varieties
too close together. This caused two problems. Once the hop plants really
started to grow, they intertwined themselves around one another. This   
hindered
the growth and made it difficult to separate once I harvested them. Be   
sure to
plant them at least six feet apart to avoid the above problems.


On to my questions. When I harvested, I cut the vines about 4 feet up   
from the
ground and left it laying. My thought is that photosynthesis will   
continue and
provide energy to the roots/rhizomes. Is this necessary or can I cut the   
vines off
at the ground after harvest? Since I planted my varieties too close, I   
want to move
them for next year. Is it better to dig up the rhizomes in the fall or   
spring to
replant them?


TIA for any suggestions or comments. Private e-mail is welcomed.

Regardless of the container you use to hold your beer, I highly recommend
that you invest in a system that utilizes a large CO2 cylinder & regulator
to supply the pressure (i.e. no party pig smack packs).  You  will find so
many other uses for the CO2 setup once you have it: purging kegs & bottles,
restarting siphons using one of those orange carboy caps, purging bags for
long term storage of hops/grain, couterpressure bottling, and last but not
least, serving keg beer at a party, even if you don't have the refrigerator
space to keep a full tap system around all the time.


This said, you might try attaching some sort of fitting to the party pig or
a mini-keg system.  They do make 3-gal cornelius kegs that can fit in your
regular regrigerator (while possibly sacrificing only a single shelf) -
I beleive St.  Patrick's has them.  As for cost, you should be able to
get set up for $150.  You'll easily go through that amount in pig smack
packs or little 1 oz CO2 cylinders in a couple of years.

Sure.  It's a weak pre-hopped malt extract.  Some extract kits say to
not boil, just dilute -- most on HBD say to boil anyway, but someone
who doesn't has still brewed at home.


You are selecting components, managing the fermentation process

Pride?  Shock perhaps...


I seriously doubt that you would win an award with a prehopped extract,
weak or normal, but if you do you should be glad and proud.  Not as
proud as a full-extract brewer, perhaps, but it would reflect well on
your materiel selections and your control of the process.

My apologies if this subject has been beaten to death already . . . I've
had problems accessing the server (hbd.org ...) that contain the
archives. Al K's post citing "driving off chlorine" as one of the
virtues of pre-boiling water caused me a little concern.


Even in backward and remote Lima, Ohio, the water treatment plant is
using chloramines instead of elemental chlorine. It is preferred by
water treatment chemists for its greater stability (Wotring, Zymurgy '95
grain issue). Evidently it's so stable that not even boiling will remove
it. Activated carbon or carbon-block (see Francis Dunn letter, Zymurgy
97 summer issue) filtration is recommended. While I like plumbing (fire,
molten metals) I do not sell filters. "Omni" universal housings go on
sale for about $12 US around here. A carbon element (good for 500
gallons) is about $8. While I haven't tried it, the "Omni" housing looks
as though it would accomodate any "standard" size element (like the
Ametek variety).


I heard an estimate that 90 to 95% of municipal water treatment plants
are using the chloramine in lieu of elemental chlorine.

 Jeremy,
 
 Funny you had this problem about the same time I was conducting a
 thermometer comparison test of my own. I took 5 thermometers, 2
floating
 glass, 2 solid glass, and a metal probe type which screws into my
 Polarware 10 gallon brewpot/mash/lautertun. The glass ones all have red
 fluid inner elements (which I assume to be alcohol). Placed in a pot of
 water on my stove, I observed the comparative temperatures and the rate
 at which they were reached. As far as accuracy it seems that all 5
 thermometers were within 1 degree of each other thoughout a range
 between 90-200 degrees F. I did note however, that the Polarware model,
 as well as the 2 glass floaters, were about 4-5 degrees behind as far
as
 reaching a stabilized temperature. The lag time seemed to be around 2
 minutes before they caught up to the solid glass models. This finding
 helped me understand why my mash temperatures were so hard to get
 adjusted correctly without over shooting during a recent mashing. From
 now on, I will use my solid glass model (it looks just like a oversized
 oral thermometer that we humans use) in order to prevent overshooting a
 rest temperature because it seemed to react the fastest during my test.
 That way I will know what my Polarware model (and more importantly my
 grist!) will eventually settle out at. I usually don't have this
problem
 when using my Igloo cooler infusion masher because it is alot better at
 holding temps and I don't try to step-mash with it.
 Anyway, maybe this will help your efficiency a little, as I know it did
 for me. I know thru experience that temperature control is "paramount"
 in developing good mash extraction efficiencies.
 As far as calibrating your thermometer, I guess you could buy a second
 one to have a comparison. That would be the most economical way. They
 are only a few dollars.
 
 Good Luck,

Subject: A Style Question


Hi all:


I recently brewed a highly hopped porter that turned out excellent, IMHO. I
want to enter it in a competition to see what kind of response it gets. In
looking at the AHA Style guide, I find the following:


>Robust Porter -
>Hop bitterness is medium to high, with hop aroma and flavor ranging from
>negligible to medium. 


>Brown Porter -
>Low to medium malt sweetness is acceptable along with medium hop
bitterness. >This is a light- to medium-bodied beer.  Hop flavor and aroma
may vary from >being negligible to medium in character. 


Basically, I feel my beer is more of a robust porter as far as malt and
body qualities. The hop bitternes is high - which is fine. The problem is
that the style guide calls for hop aroma and flavor to be negligible to
medium - while mine is delightfully high. Since there isn't an 'American
Porter' catagory, what do style should I enter this under? Someone
suggested the Specialty catagory. I'd appreciate any input.

Can you say hops on the ceiling?  Ok, so there are no revelations about
acids, alphas, or other technical stuff here but maybe someone will get
a laugh.  I made my first batch using a 5gal carboy as a primary this
week.  I have previously used a 6gal bucket or 6gal carboy that belonged
to a friend.  Since I had heard so much about blow-off tubes, I thought
it sould be no problem. I used my long plastic siphon tube and some
clear hose run into a gallon jug full of bleach water.  I came home on
the second day to find my batch of brew bubbling slowly away in the back
bathroom bathtub.  I wondered why it had hop and foam residue around the
top of the carboy like it had really taken off but was now going at such
a slow rate.  As I was changing clothes in the next room I found out
why.  I heard a POP and went to see what it was.  The stopper had blown
out of the carboy and foam was shooting out the carboy about 2 inches
high and running all over the place.  I panicked.  I put the stopper
back in and noticed the tube looked clogged.  As I reached over to
inspect the tube, the stopper blew back out with considerable force. 
Hops and foam on the ceiling, on the walls, in my hair, up my nose, and
worst of all, all over the clothes my wife had cleaned and pressed that
were waiting to go to the consignment shop!  I guess I should strain the
hops out before using a 5gal carboy as a primary.

I'll chime in, in agreement with Jethro, that Lallemand dry yeasts are a fine

Ian WIlson asks about sparge water:


  In designing a recipe, I determine the following:


  Grain bill weight                16lbs
  Final Volume                 9 gallons
  Total volume of water based on Ray Daniels work sheet from
  "Designing Great Beers"
                          16 gallons


  Mash in at 1.33 gal/lb        5.3 gal


  Of the remaining 10.7 gallons of water to put 9 gallons in 
  the fermenter, how much of this should be assigned to 
  sparge volume?  Obviously, sparging with  10.7 gallons is 
  rediculous.


An oft-quoted rule of thumb is to sparge with the same amount of water as was
used to mash.  This seems to work out for me in practice; for a 10-lb grain
bill I'd mash with 3.3 gal water and I end up with 6-1/2 gal in the boiler.
 What isn't obvious perhaps is the water left in the mashtun.  If the goal is
to keep the liquid level in the mashtun above the grain, then obviously there
is a lot of water left over.  This third fraction of water is still "needed",
but ends up as "waste" and doesn't make it to your brew.


So if you mash in with X gallons, which as a rule of thumb is half the total
sparged volume (another X), and after sparging you leave the mashtun as full
as when you mashed (a third X), you have a total volume water requirement of
about three times your mash volume.  At 1.33 qt/lb this translates to 1.33 qt
x 3 = 4 qt = 1 gal / lb total need.  In your case, you mashed in with 5.3
gal; 5.3 x 3 is pretty darn close to 16.
