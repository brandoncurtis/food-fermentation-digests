Subject: Wine Yeasts in Beer


Has anyone out there is HBD land ever used wine yeasts with a traditional
beer recipe?  Because of a problem with airation, I had a stuck fermentation
with a brown ale I was brewing.  I had a SG of 1.061 and after about 2 weeks
I racked to my secondary with a SG of 1.033.  I'm pretty sure the problem
was bad airation, but I have had this happen before and a long secondary has
finished the beer nicely.  Well after another 4 weeks I went to bottle.  I
racked to my bottling bucket and added primining sugar.  Then I took a
gravity (I know that I should have taken a gravity before I racked, but I
didn't).  The gravity was at 1.031.  I didn't have any yeast ready to
repitch, none of my brew friends were home and the next 3 days I was going
to be away from home (no quick trip to the brew store the next day to get
yeast).  I thought 'what the hell', racked into a carboy, and pitched 2
packets of dry wine yeast (premier curue and montrachet).  It took off
nicely and was bubbling within hours.  My original yeast was 1028.  I have
kept the ferment temp at 62 deg.  What types of flavors should I expect from
this batch? 
10# Pale 2 row
1# gambrinust Honey 25L
1# special roast
infusion mash at 152 deg
1 oz chinook 11.3AA  bittering only
1028 from slants


I know this is not within the style guidelines for a brown ale, but I do
like the recipe normally.


Also, would the second pitching of yeast eat up any oxygen that was
introduced by the rackings into the bottling bucket and back into the carboy?

After Friday's edition on the HBD, I felt the need to e-mail Mr. Bret
Kimbrough, resident brewer of the Little Apple Brewing Co.  In short, I
asked him what the purpose of his posting of Rob's recipe could be, did he
realize how big of a no-no this was, and did he realize how many brewers
this might get to.  These all seemed to be relevent questions.  His
response follows:

Hello-


I'm thinking of buying a cartridge injector set-up for traveling kegs.
It's the one made by Williams Brewing. They're the 12 gram co2
cartridges and hook-up to a corny. I'd be interested in what the
owners of these little devices have to say about them.


I brewed my FORD beer yesterday. I had only about 2 1/2 ounces of hops
so I bittered with Northern Brewers and did later kettle additions
with the FORDs. I saved about 2/3 of an ounce for dry hopping. I can
hardly wait till it hits the keg.


 I only mention this to rub Rich Byrnes the wrong way! BTW, I
terrorized my humble community with a Grand Terino station wagon at
age 16. Yhea, I was super cool.

In HBD #2505 Miguel de Salas wrote:
"some European hops, especially Moravian Saaz from the Czech Republik and
some German and Polish hops have had the crop completely wiped out by the
massive flooding during summer"


Hops are grown mainly in the south-eastern part of Poland nearby town of
Lublin which wasn't affected by July flood at all. Actually, due to very
sunny and warm weather in August this year crops are of excellent quality
with an alfa-acids contents above average both in super aromatic (Lubelski)
and bittering (eg Marynka) varietes.
Contrary to what Miguel assumes, the main problem with Polish hops is it's
overproduction, especially of aromatic ones. You know, modern megabreweries
don't mind aroma and count alfa-acids as a bittering input only...
So may be suppliers for home- and craftbrewing will come here to the rescue ?
As I know they are welcome.

Subject: BT article on PU


Some HBDer's have commented on apparent typos in my recent "Brewing
Techniques" article on Pilsner Urquell.  Those of you who do not have
access to the magazine may wish to look at the on-line version of the
article at:


"http://realbeer.com/brewingtechniques/library/backissues/issue5.3/urquell.html"


First, the mash temperature rests given in the article (95, 127, 143,
163 deg. F) are correct.  These were supplied by Jaroslav Rous and Pavel
Prucha of the brewery.


Second, the water:malt ratio given in the article (1.85 liters water:1 
kilogram malt) is correct.  This information was also supplied by Rous
and Prucha. 


Prucha has pointed out that the basic procedures for mashing at PU have
not changed in 75 years.  


However, there are a few typos which the editors and I noticed after
publication.  I believe these will also be acknowledged in the next
issue of BT.


First, the table heading on page 54 should read "Dortmunder", not
"Dortmunder Pils".  


Second, the second column on page 55 should cite reference #18, not #19,
when discussing Pilsen water.


Third, the first column on page 58 should say that the lagering tunnels
at PU are 2250 square meters in area, not 2250 square miles (!!).


Nastrovi!

True. An easier method would be to use a hop bag- you can pull your hops 
out at the end of the boil and throw them in the trash. (Please don't bring 
up the dogs and hops thread again!!!) This has the added benefit of 
reducing trub in your primary. If you can't get your hands on a hop bag, 
try using an unwanted pair of (clean! `at`;-0 ) pantyhose or nylon stockings - 
they work great!


Checking your fermenting beer often is good advice regardless of what 
method you're using.

Subject: Mash water / Q: Fermentation temps


Dear Friends,


In #2506, Ken Schwartz, discussing various things relating to mash
water volumes, writes:


"What isn't obvious perhaps is the water left in the mashtun.  If the
goal is to keep the liquid level in the mashtun above the grain,
then obviously there is a lot of water left over.  This third
fraction of water is still "needed", but ends up as "waste" and
doesn't make it to your brew."


Subsequent wording in Ken's post implies that the tun still has
enough water to be above the grainbed level at the end of wort
collection.  Either I have been doing something wrong for years or
have simply not been paying attention while reading the digest (or
both!), because I have always let my lauter drain all the way out
after adding the last of my sparge water.  That is, once I have made
my final addition of sparge water (I typically use spatch barging as
has been discussed recently in these pages a fair bit), I go away and
prep the next steps in the process and give the tun time to drain out
as much as it's going to without drastically tipping the tun (my tun
is a cooler that I prop up on one end a bit to get some gravity
working for me).  As far as I can tell I have had few problems
commonly attributed to oversparging, so I'd like to hear what others
do in this regard-- let it drain or leave water above the level of
the grain bed when wort collection is over? 


*******


I have a question about the relative effects of fermentation
temperature during primary and secondary fermentation of ales.  My
motivation is that, although I now have a (working!) brew fridge
that allows me complete control, only one fermentor will fit in there
at a time, and I would like to be able to brew more often than the
time it takes for a batch to go all the way through primary and
secondary fermentation while sitting in the fridge (at least until my
stocks recover from my long hiatus).  If an ale has its primary
fermentation temp controlled by the fridge, say at 68F/20C, until
gravity is only a couple of points above terminal, and I then rack
to a second fermentor that goes to a warmer place (indoors, max
80F/27C), will I lose the advantages I gained by primary-fermenting
at 68/20? Will there be enough yeast activity occurring in the second
fermentor to throw esters and other high-temp fermentation byproducts
that were the reason I got a fridge in the first place?  Many thanks
for any input.


Cheers,

Fellow HBDers, I have received several replies to my search for quality
dried yeast stock, and I hope that I have replied to each person that
emailed me their suggestions.  If I have forgotten, please forgive my
oversight.


The big three are :
1.  Lallemand/Danstar (nottingham, london, etc.)
2.  Edme
3.  Yeast Lab Dry Lager


These are ranked according to the number of referrals only, not necessarily
according to quality, blah, blah, blah. I am also not affiliated with any
particular company, etc, etc.


Again, I am amazed at the number of messages I received regarding this.
Thanks to all of those that replied to my query.


- -------------------------------------------


My comment centers around the plight of Rob Moline, and the effect of this
on the HBD, and other brewing fora available on the internet.  I have met
with Rob at his new home in Ames, and I can sense that he is ready to begin
again in Ames.  The news that the current brewer has upset the apple cart
regarding the LABCO Barleywine (GABF Gold 1996) recipe is extremely
upsetting to me.  In my naive second/third party conception, I feel that
the revelation was an act of extreme desparation.


It seems that LABCO wants to try to destroy Rob by revealing his recipe,
despite the fact that Rob left LABCO for reasons unrelated to his
relationship with his bosses.  Perhaps LABCO thinks that the recipe was
Rob's SWAN SONG, that this recipe was the best that Rob could do. Perhaps
even that the BW was the only EXCELLENT product he made while employed at
LABCO.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In fact, this act may
encourage Rob to do even better in the future.  I know he can do it, and
given the chance, he will.  His optimism is contagious, his hospitality
unmatched, his sanitation procedures are beyond criticism, and his beers
are DAMN GOOD. These are all things that can't be taken away. Let's
remember that LABCO often produced infected, spoiled beers before Rob was
hired as head brewer and tracked down the cause and made changes to the
brewing setup.


Chin up, Rob.  You have more friends across the Internet than you will ever
know. Your witty and factual insight has helped to bring more than one
smile to my face, as well as passing along reliable information to the
masses regarding brewing and beer.


I am unsure if emailing Rob's ersatz substitute is going to undo the
problem, however.  Just know that somewhere, someone is keeping track of
this guy's monumental ethical breech, and his brewing reputation will be
permanently damaged as a result. Eventually.


Thanks for the moment of relief, and the bandwidth.

Mark Tumarkin suggested an HBD gathering at the GABF this year.  Let's do it!


This will be my first GABF, and I was hoping to meet as many GABF-bound
HBD'ers as possible too, but Mark's idea on a semi-organized meeting is a
great one.  My only concern is that, I would assume, the local brewpubs are
SRO that weekend, which could screw up the logistics of a semi-large group
trying to meet up, especially when we don't know each other by sight!!


I will be helping out some friends at the booth of Las Cruces, New Mexico's
"High Desert Brewing Co", so stop by and say "hey".  Try the IPA and the dark
bock while you're there.  Of course, I hope to be wandering off to other
booths myself occasionally, so some sort of organized meeting would be great
so I can meet as many of you as I can.

Subject: Dry Post-Sparge Mash? / Cold Primary, Warm Secondary


Dave in Dallas asks about my comments on sparge water volume in response to
Ian Wilson's questions of Ray Daniels' brewing water volume calculations:


  "Subsequent wording in Ken's post implies that the tun still has
  enough water to be above the grainbed level at the end of wort
  collection.  Either I have been doing something wrong for years or
  have simply not been paying attention while reading the digest (or
  both!), because I have always let my lauter drain all the way out
  after adding the last of my sparge water."


Without looking at Daniels's calculation methods to come up with the figures,
 I wrote my response based on "floating" the mash for the full sparging
period.  I seem to recall Daniels using this assumption, but I could be
wrong.  Most homebrewing literature alludes to keeping the mash underwater to
avoid compaction, so a mashtun full of spent grain and clear water would be
the post-sparge result.  As a sanity check, Dave, I too usually end up with
at least part of the mash run dry at the end of the sparge.  I was just
trying to explain Daniels' method.


If you're barge spatching, as Dave is, then of course you would run the grain
dry on both runoffs.  This is not however what Ian was doing (as far as I can
tell).

Dave goes on to ask:


  "If an ale has its primary
  fermentation temp controlled by the fridge, say at 68F/20C, until
  gravity is only a couple of points above terminal, and I then rack
  to a second fermentor that goes to a warmer place (indoors, max
  80F/27C), will I lose the advantages I gained by primary-fermenting
  at 68/20? Will there be enough yeast activity occurring in the second
  fermentor to throw esters and other high-temp fermentation byproducts
  that were the reason I got a fridge in the first place?"


A good question I've wondered about too.  Actually I've done this several
times, when I needed to brew more than one batch within a few weeks and
didn't have Fermentation Chiller capacity.  I've noticed no ill effect, **as
long as the initial "active" part of the fermentation is overwith**.  It's
during that portion of the fermentation that off-flavors would be produced en
masse, I assume.  My limited experience in this matter supports that claim.

Hi all, 


I thought the list might enjoy this:


After the Great Britain Beer Festival, in London, all the brewery 
presidents decided to go out for a beer.  The guy from Corona sits down  
and says "Hey Senor, I would like the world's best beer, a Corona."
The bartender dusts off a bottle from the shelf and gives it to him. 
The guy from Budweiser says "I'd like the best beer in the world, give   
me 'The King Of Beers', a Budweiser."
The bartender gives him one.
The guy from Coors says "I'd like the only beer made with Rocky   
Mountain spring water, give me a Coors."
He gets it.
The guy from Guiness sits down and says "Give me a Coke."
The bartender is a little taken aback, but gives him what he ordered.   
The other brewery presidents look over at him and ask "Why aren't you   
drinking a Guiness?" and the Guiness president replies
"Well, if you guys aren't drinking beer, neither will I."

Actually, the microwaves are not radiation as in atomic radication. They
are radiation as in radio waves, etc. The small size of the wavelength
allows the wave energy to penetrate the food and excite the small water
molecules within the fodd. This excitation or vibration is what causes the
heat rise because of friction.


Iradiating food to sterilize it uses radioactive soucres to bombard the
food with atomic radiation. The radiation kills the "wee nasties" in much
the same way as the victims of the atomic bomb. 


Yes, you could use the microwave to sterlize your home brew, but you would
need to "boil" all of the items.


Incodentally, I have seen an apple which was wrapped and sealed in a poly
bag before irradiating. Athough the apple was a year old, it was still as
fresh as the day it was sealed and just as juicy. 


The irradiating sources used currently for food prezervation are typically
"low power" ones which can punch through plastic, but not significant
enough to punch through cans. I don't remeber ever hearing or even thinking
about bottles. Point being that it might not be a great sterilizer for
production beer.

Subject: Converting Kegs, Bulkhead Fittings


Bierfolk,


        I have recently been undertaking a project to convert 
three Sankey kegs for a three-tiered system, and I wanted 
to share my results with cutting out the openings in the 
top of the kegs.  
        For first keg, I used my jigsaw to cut an opening 
in the top of the keg.  I quickly learned that if you want 
to proceed faster than a snails pace, you must stop every 
minute to change blades.  I started with 22 TPI (Teeth per 
Inch) blades, which melted down really quickly, so I 
switched to 14 TPI blades.  I think that if you were to 
start with 14 TPI blades, you could probably do it with 
about 5-7 blades.  Also, I found it very difficult with my 
jigsaw to cut in a circle, so instead I made a hex opening 
by drilling six holes and playing "Connect the Dots".  
Afterwards I ground the edges with a grinding stone in my 
drill.  Total time: four hours.  Cost: About $10.00 for the 
blades.  Another 4 or 5 bucks for the drill bits.
        As I was wandering around the hardware store looking 
for more blades for the next two kegs, I saw a grinding 
wheel for a circular saw.  As people have mentioned using 
one of these before, I decided to try one.  I installed it 
in my circular saw, but when I tried to fit my circular saw 
in the keg to cut, it became apparent that it was not going 
to fit because of the flat "guide" on the bottom of the 
circular saw.  I removed it, and the saw fit on the keg.  
As I started to cut, it became apparent that this is the 
way to do it.  Unlike using the jigsaw, the keg did not 
vibrate to the point of interference (both kegs were half 
full).  Also, it only took approximately 10 minutes to cut 
out a circular opening in each keg and another 10-20 
minutes work with the grinding stone.  I cut freehand, but 
afterwards I realized that I should have traced the hole 
for a lid.  Luckily, a lid from my stock pot fits just 
fine!  Total cost for two kegs: $2.50.  Total time for two 
kegs: ~1 hour.
        The motto when using the grinding wheel is "Safety 
First".  Be sure to wear eye and hearing protection, and I 
recommend jeans, because white hot pieces of metal go 
flying everywhere.  Personally, I deserve the small burn 
marks on my legs, because I was committing a fashion faux-
paux by wearing army boots with shorts.  Unfortunately, the 
little metal shavings went down in my boots!
        My next task is installing some bulkhead fittings.  
Does anyone know where I can find brass bulkhead fittings?  
The plumbing supply stores don't seem to carry them here.

Subject: Cartridge (Omni) filters


I know there has been some discussion about cartridge type (i.e. Omni)
water filters here in the past - both for water 'conditioning' and
(if I remember correctly) filtering beer.  My question is related to
using these filters for wine.  I propose to use this filter by racking
from the fermenter to a garden type pump sprayer, pressurizing the
sprayer and pumping through the filter directly to the bottling wand.
Does anyone have experience with this kind of set-up?  Will it work?


BTW, I would store the filter in a case constructed of PVC pipe,
filled with metabisulfite (sp?).  I would think there should be no
problem filtering 30+ gallons US using a single filter since they
are designed to filter tens of thousands of gallons of water.  Would
a casual rinse with water be sufficient before each use?


TIA. Private email OK.

Since you, presumably, want to enter a competition to win an award,
you need to figure out what fault in your beer will count for the least
amount of points deducted.  Looking at a standard score sheet will
help you here.
Aroma is only give 2 out of 50 points, so extra hop aroma won't
hurt you much.  The flavor and "overall impression" sections are
where a judge can take off points if he or she doesn't like some
aspects of the beer.  


Bigger beers tend to do better in competitions than smaller beers,
so, unless your hop flavor and bitterness are completely dominant,
the beer should do fine.  If there are no real flaws in the flavor,
send it in under robust porter.  It will get lost in Specialty.

Mark,


I also would suggest entering your beer in AHA Category #23, Specialty and
Experimental Beer.  More specifically, I would enter it under 23a)
Classic-Style Specialty Beer.  Be sure to list the classic style (Robust
Porter) and the special ingredients (Flavor and Aroma Hops) in the
appropriate line on the entry form.  That way the judges will see that
information when they judge.  You may want to include a note to the
organizer/registrar so they know to include it under "Special Ingredients".


If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.  It
sounds like a great beer!


Good Luck & Good Beer!

        I have used this yeast to brew several excellent Kolsch clones. In earlier
attempts I have used other yeast strains, but the final product was missing
something. They were good beers, they just were not Kolsch. So far, the
Wyeast Kolsch strain has given me the best results.  I believe there are
three points to follow for reproducing a Kolsch beer.=20


        1) The YEAST! Anyone who claims that a lager yeast can be a substitute is
(IMHO) wrong. This style of beer originated before true bottom fermenting
strains were even isolated. True Kolsch yeasts are top fermenting  S.
cerevisiae that are also somewhat active lower temperatures. Without the
correct yeast, you just don't get that Kolsch "snap." If you have ever had
a real one, you will know what I mean.=20
=20
        2) Ferment at a low ale temp, then be sure to cold condition for at least
a month at 10=BAC. The extended cold conditioning cleans up the esters, and
allows the flavors to mellow. This cold conditioning step is probably why
Kolsch is sometimes confused with lagers.=20
=09
        3) Use good German Malted barley & toss in a pinch (less than 1/2 lb in 5
gal) of wheat. This adds a subtle touch of friutiness, as well as inproved
head retention.=20


Traditionally noble hops are used especially Spalt or Hallertau. (Saaz can
be used in place of Spalt) (don't over do the flavoring hops)=20

Subject: AHA "Guidelines"




Dave Draper brings up the issue of the AHA Kolsh "guidelines" and their
apparent inaccuracy based upon George Fix's attempts at duplicating real
examples of this style.  I would like to second the motion and highlight
similar discrepancies between the AHA guidelines for Alt beer and the
analysis of commercially available Alt beers in Germany.  Ray Daniels, in
his fine book "Designing Great Beers" provides tables analyzing specific
examples of Alt beers from Germany.  When you compare those to the AHA
guidelines, they look like different beers.  The only "Alt" beer that I
have tasted commercially is Schmaltz's which, I think and I think I have
heard others mention, is out of style.  I have tasted other brewers
interpretation of the Alt style, based upon on particular persons
interpretation of the style, and they remind me of a brown ale fermented
with WYeast 1007.


I'd like to hear more about these styles and why the AHA guidelines don't
fit what is being produced in Germany.

Subject: Full volume boil and hop utilization


Hi,
  I recently obtained a 40 qt Volrath pot and was finally able to do
my first full volume boil (5 gal). One thing I noticed was much more 
bitterness than the same recipe done with a partial boil.  The recipe 
is a Pale Ale as follows:


6# M&F light DME
8 oz 60 deg crystal
2 oz Cascade pellets 5.5% (bittering)
 .5 oz Cascade pellets (flavoring)
1.5 tsp irish moss
1.5 oz Cascade pellets (aroma)


I actually used a little less than 2 oz for bittering since the recipe
called for 10 AAU.  For my partial boils I would typically boil about 3 
gal and then top up to 5 gal in the fermenter.  This time I boiled 6 gal,
which yielded somewhere between 5.0 and 5.5 gal after a 60 min boil.  Now
I've heard that hop utilization increases with the volume of the boil so 
my question is this: Is there a general rule of thumb for decreasing the 
amount of hops used in a full volume boil to achieve the same bitterness 
that I was getting in a partial boil ?  Does it depend on the hop variety, 
AA%, malt, other ?  How bout the hardness of the water ?  Also, is there 
a difference in utilization among pellets, plugs and leaf ?


Any suggestions/information would be greatly appreciated. TIA.

Spencer said,
"This is pretty close.  You'll lose a little bit of gravity to
precipitated protein, and you've got to count in the wort that's left

While you will lose some wort that is left behind in the hops, you'll be
losing wort at the same gravity so the gravity isn't affected by the
wort left behind.  You'll have less wort but it's all at the same
gravity, maybe 4.75 gallons at 1.048.

Subject: Wyeast 1968




To kick-off my brewing season, I thought that I would brew a British
best/special bitter in honor of my visit to the CAMRA Real Ale
festival in August (yum!).  I also decided to finally get away from
using 1028 for all my British bitter/pale ale/IPA creations and picked
Wyeast 1968 "Special London/London ESB" pretty much at random.


When the smack-pack arrived, I was a bit suprised to see that this
fell under Wyeast's "Advanced Yeast" designation, so I went and looked
it up on the Wyeast cross-reference 
"http://www.magma.ca/~bodnsatz/brew/tips/yeast/wyeast.html" (thanks
Alan!) where it describes 1968 as:


  Highly flocculant top-fermenting strain with rich, malty character and
  balanced fruitiness. This strain is so flocculant that additional
  aeration is needed. An excellent strain for cask-conditioned ales.
      Flocculation - high; apparent attenuation - 67-71%.


It is easy to see that the yeast is highly flocculant from my first
starter.  I'm uncertain how to handle this during fermentation.  Do I
gently stir the yeast back into suspension with an appropriately
sanitized device?  I do my primaries in a 6.5g carboy.  Is this a
candidate for dropping?  


I'm brewing on Wednesday, so comments about pitching techniques will
be welcome but a little too late.  I always do at least a one pint ->
one quart starter and aerate like mad, so hopefully that will carry me
through that stage.

Greetings all...I have been contemplating brewing up a tasty dark mild

recipes for mild ales, and also some interesting mash conditions.  Most
of the mild ale recipes have an associated mash temp of 63 C (145 F),
and estimated terminal gravities in the 1.005 to 1.007 range.  I have
never used such low saccharification temperatures for a mash before, and
I'm curious as to why this would be suggested for this particular style
of beer.  Any comments would be appreciated,
