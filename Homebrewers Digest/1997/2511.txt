Subject: Career long mistakes, fridges, and loose talk


Dave Draper, geologist and thus of good taste and cheer, sez in HBD 2508:


"Either I have been doing something wrong for years or
have simply not been paying attention while reading the digest (or
both!), because I have always let my lauter drain all the way out
after adding the last of my sparge water."


Well, Dave, me too.  I worked off of gravity and pH for a while, but now just
go by taste, and I haven't shown any problems with oversparging.  There
should be no hydraulic reason to leave sparge water above grain at the end; I
can't think of a chemical reason.  We haven't been doing something wrong for
years.


" although I now have a (working!) brew fridge
that allows me complete control, only one fermentor will fit in there
at a time, and I would like to be able to brew more often than the
time it takes for a batch to go all the way through primary and
secondary fermentation while sitting in the fridge (at least until my
stocks recover from my long hiatus).  If an ale has its primary
fermentation temp controlled by the fridge, say at 68F/20C, until
gravity is only a couple of points above terminal, and I then rack
to a second fermentor that goes to a warmer place (indoors, max
80F/27C), will I lose the advantages I gained by primary-fermenting
at 68/20? Will there be enough yeast activity occurring in the second
fermentor to throw esters and other high-temp fermentation byproducts
that were the reason I got a fridge in the first place? "


Yeast aren't particularily active reproducing in the secondary, so I would
think that byproducts would be of significant concentration. My fridge holds
one carboy and one cornelius if you push on the door.  I ferment lagers in
there, cause here in the north we don't have 80 degree temps in our
basements.  I secondary in the corny, and it seems to work well. You might
try the towel and tub trick for your secondary, also, if you're worried.


Also, in HBD 2508, someone published a letter from Little Apple....I submit
to the collective that interference in this issue is 1) certainly not our
business, and 2) most importantly, can potentially damage Mr. Moline, whose
post on the issue was brief and honorable.  Please, ladies and gentlemen,
back off and let this thing go it's course without unsolicited "help".  If
you're angry at someone, don't patronize the respective establishment.  This
is more critical to individuals than many threads,  and the uninformed (like
me) need to watch their typing.  Or face subpoenas, perhaps?

Subject: Filtered beer started fermenting


Dear HBD


I bought an old bottle of pasteurized, filtered Kolsch, it was past the 
best before date by 6 months, and didnt taste good. The same day I 
brewed a batch of beer and I scooped out a little wort and poured some 
of the beer into the chilled wort and sealed with an airlock.
To my surprise It started fermenting 5 days later, and after 10 days a 
clearly visible yeast layer had formed on the bottom of the bottle.
I figure the yeast must have survived the filtration and pasteurization. 
Has anyone else had these experiences. Does the age of the beer have 
anything to do with this?
Can I use the yeast to brew my own Kolsch?

>Has anyone out there is HBD land ever used wine yeasts with a traditional

I have used champagne yeasts in my barleywine on occasion. Once because I
apparently killed my starter, the second time just for fun.


I have been really impressed with the cleanness of the fermentation with
champagne yeasts (particularly in big beers and in beers where a little
sweetness (from some higher alcohols) is expected (barleywines in particular).


Plus champagne yeasts' ability to ferment high gravity worts/musts is well
known in the mead/wine community. Just be aware that in a normal gravity
wort, it may turn out drier and more alcoholic that you might expect.


Good luck with your Brown. YMMV.

Randy described the Beamish stout mash temp of 143F. 
 Do you have any idea how
 to replicate the nutty taste of Beamish?
 It is my favorite stout although very 
hard to come by in my parts.


Have you made classic dry stouts and entered in competitions?
  I make a dry stout that many people enjoy,
 OG 1.043, FG 1.014, 45 IBU (estimate), roast barley etc. 
 It always gets slammed in competitions as "not big enough,"
 even though it has same body, bitterness (roast malt and hops)
 of a draft guinness (obviously without
 the tang).   Have you or others had a similar experience
 with your dry stouts?

Subject: Steinbier? / Draining the lauter tun dry


     Hi all,
     
     First, a question:
     
     For some reason, I can't get the idea of making a Steinbier out of my 
     head.  Does anybody out there have any ideas about what types of rocks 
     to use, how hot to heat them, how to heat them, how to clean them, 
     etc.?
     
     Also, are there special safety concerns?  I would guess that dropping 
     a few 500F rocks into the kettle might cause a bit of an eruption, no?
     
     Also, any ideas on how to move the hot rocks?  I guess if they are 
     small enough, I could just use kitchen tongs, but would using many 
     small rocks present too much surface area for caramelization?
     
     I don't know why I get these things in my head...
     
     -------------------------------------
     
     Somebody (sorry, can't even remember which issue!) recently wrote that 
     they completely drain their lauter tun at the end of sparging, and 
     they wondered if this could be a problem.
     
     In my system, if I drain the lauter tun completely, I get a lot of 
     draff in the run-off.  I believe that this should be avoided.  Perhaps 
     other systems don't work this way, but it is something to be aware of.
     
     Have fun!

Subject: More muckraking


Dear Friends,


I had several very thoughtful replies to my rabble-rousing post about
the AHA guidelines, and we've seen some posts here in the digest too.
First off, I'd like to say that I was not really trying to start a
revolt or anything, but was mainly expressing the strong dismay that
Dr. George's post gave me.  The input I've seen since, however,
suggests that, first, the BJCP is already on the job as far as working
to provide a self-consistent and realistic set of style guidelines,
and by all accounts that is the best place to start in replacing the
AHA's deficient system.  I intend to get involved with this, to the
extent I can, and will sit the next BJCP exam that comes my way as a
first step.  A second thing that becomes apparent is that there are
lots of others who have similar dissatisfactions but who, like me,
have not really done much about them (but this is hardly news to many
readers).  My gut feeling is that the groundswell is building, and
with time a grass-roots change will come about-- and those are the
best kind of changes, for my money, and worth a little wait if need
be. 


Cheers,


Dave in Dallas

Brewsters:


It would help all people in our society ( if they really wanted help) to
distinguish between radiation and *ionizing* radiation.  It is the latter=


which is used as a sterilant, genetic modifier and potential cancer cause=
r
(and curer) and is a subset of the former.  Radiation, of course, include=
s
radio waves, light, microwaves, etc in addition to gamma rays, x-rays, =


etc.. This is not a complaint about the HBDer's beer sterilization
question, I am just reminded how many silly experiments, fear generation,=


etc. are done in the name of "radiation protection". Witness the recent
(extortion?) attempt to include high voltage lines, cellular telephones,
radio waves as a causative agent for cancer and other BS.  This is an
off-shoot to the much larger issue which has frustrated me about the ener=
gy
policy in this country and our succumbing to big energy ( oil, coal, gas
and labor interests) propaganda in eliminating the safest and cheapest
source of energy for our future. Sorry for providing the thought for the
day that is not brewing related.  No affiliation , etc. - thanks for
listening.
- ------------------------------------------
Paul Henning wants to know of a way to stir his flocculant British ale
yeast mid-fermentation.  Just rack it after about a day (if you have a
large starter) and agitate it towards the end of the racking to pick up t=
he
yeast.  This is easy and equivalent to the "dropping" method employed in
days of old before fermenters had agitators.
- ------------------------------------------
Thanks for interpreting AlK's comment, I did understand his point, as he
did my suggestion to cure the problem of iodine tests giving a premature
endpoint.  AlK doesn't have this problem, since he uses his intuition (an=
d
not the iodine test). He holds his mashes in the saccharification range f=
or
45 minutes or longer as he has indicated in the past.  If he were to
exclusively use the iodine test he would find that he could, perhaps, sto=
p
his saccharification step in about 15 minutes ( as Charlie P does).
Unfortunately. he might also find that his efficiency would drop and his
beers become starchy because he had not fully saccharified his grains. Th=
is
will vary with the type of malts employed, sacch temperature, milling etc=
=2E =


If you get a negative iodine test after boiling the wort sample then your=


KNOW you are complete. Try it, then give me your feedback.
- ------------------------------------------
Like AlK and others, I believe the market for malt types has changed with=


the advance of technology.  I just don't seem to get the proof I desire t=
o
understand the changes. None of the commonly available tests in malt
specifications are unequivocal.  I appeal again for someone to provide
modern tests and methods.  The ones available to us are the same ones use=
d
for many years before  DeCLerk and M&BS were printed.  I would therefore
presume that the comments by these authors on the inadequacy of these tes=
ts
to describe malts still apply today as they did 50 years ago.

This is something that I've been thinking about quite a bit in the last
few weeks and I'd like to open this topic for discussion.  I *believe*
that the hot water would have *fewer* metals/gunk/*minerals* than cold
water.  Sure, we've all seen the insides of hot water heaters and hot
water pipes... they're all coated with a thick crust of mineral deposits.
Why?  Well, it's because the hot water could not keep these minerals in
solution... *that's* why they were deposited.  For example: hot water
holds less CO2 in solution than cold and therefore is of *higher* pH.
Higher pH water will support *less* calcium bicarbonate than low pH water
and therefore the excess carbonate will precipitate out as calcium
carbonate.   Therefore, I believe that hot water will have *lower* TDS!
Chemists... am I right?


Furthermore, since the pipes are coated with calcium carbonate, this
effectively protects the water from the iron or lead in the plumbing.
Of this I'm pretty certain.

I've used a "drinking water" hose for brewing on ten batches or so and
the resulting beer is just as tasty as beer made from kitchen tapwater.

Hmmm... it depends.  I've never worried about boiling my strike or sparge
water and we have pretty high levels of chlorine in our water.  Yes,
the calcium carbonate will re-dissolve when you add acid.

I try to not splash.  I don't use a sparge arm.  Many commercial breweries,
however, do allow their sparge water to splash.  I believe the difference
may be that their mash tuns are usually enclosed with only a small opening
at the top.  It would not take much time for most of the air in the tun
to be displaced with water vapour.  I run my sparge water through a 5/16"
ID hose which I position "under water" in the tun.  I keep about 1 to 2"
of water over the grain bed.  If you keep your lid on, I think that splashing
may be moot.

No.  *Theoretically* you want to draw runnings from as large an area as
possible, but *practically* I've found that if you make sure to take 1 hour
to take 6 or 7 gallons worth of runnings, the EasyMasher(tm) yield is so
close to the other designs (Zapap, Pico, Slotted Copper, etc.), that it
is within measurement error for most of us.

I've read where an 18" grain bed is ideal.  Mine is about 12" to 18",
depending on how big a beer I'm making.  You already have a 60qt cooler,
so why not get a 5gal Gott?  Use the 5gal for smaller beers and the 60qt
for bigger batches and bigger beers (i.e. Barleywines, Doppelbocks, etc.).


>3) Would a small volume pump (not RIMS throughput) be of use recirculating

I've never had to recirculate more than 1 quart using my EasyMasher(TM).
My new system is EasyMasher-like (photos coming soon!) but has several
screens so I have ro recirc about 1/2 gallon.  Personally, I
would rather spend the money elsewhere in my system.

The existing BJCP guidelines have their own problems.  For
example, the IPA IBU range goes down to 30 (far too low)
and under Duesseldorfer Altbier, it says "They also tend to
have a grainy, even harsh or astringent malt flavor." (GADS, NO!!!)
These are but two of many problems.


There is a committee working on new BJCP guidelines, but alas,
it has been stalled for the last two weeks as the moderator/leader
is loaded-down with day-job work.

Subject: Wanted: Water profile from YOUR area




I'm doing some research on my own and studying water chemistry for beer
brewing, and tossing together some software to do water synthesis with
(for brewers of course!).  As a result, I'm trying to expand the
database of water profiles that I have, and to try to fill in some of
the gaps in the published water profiles (namely, pH).  Do you live in a
major city (USA or anywhere in the world) where beer brewing is common? 
Common means: professional breweries of any type exist and/or a
reasonably large number of homebrewers exist.  Here's the info I'm
looking for:


Calcium, mg/L of Ca++
Sulphate, mg/L of SO4--
Magnesium, mg/L of Mg++
Sodium, mg/L of Na+
Chloride, mg/L of Cl-
Hardness (please express what this means in your profile, ex. Mg and Ca
"as mg/L  CaCO3" or whatever)
Alkalinity (specify if "as mg/L CaCO3" or otherwise)
CO3-- (specify if "mg/L of CO3--" or "CO3-- and HCO3- as mg/L of CO3--"
or whatever "as mg/L CaCO3", other or unknown?)
HCO3- (if known, specify if "as mg/L of CaCO3" or "CO3-- and HCO3- as
mg/L HCO3-", or "as mg/L CaCO3" etc.)
pH (this is very important and the most commonly lacking piece of
information)
Any other ion concentrations that you have available for the water
profile(s) you are submitting




Note that a lot of this is available in the literature and via various
software programs (and I've collected most of this info), BUT they
nearly always lack a pH measure.  If YOU have the appropriate pH for a
particular water profile, please include it!


Note also that I'm very interested in new information that is normally
not found in the literature such as the water profile for YOUR city
(nobody's city is unimportant!).  AND this means around the world.  This
means not only the usual US, European, and UK brewing capitols of the
world, but also the smaller towns in those areas, and wherever else in
the world that brewing takes place (including YOUR house if you water is
fairly representative of the town you live in or near).


Once gathered, all data will be posted to HBD as a gesture of thanks to
the openness and generally awesome neighborly attitude seen around
here...by far the best listserve in the world!  (And to be useful to
anyone else researching this stuff, developing software, or whatever).


Thanks in advance!
Brian Dixon

I know others have responded with very good answers, so I'll keep this
brief.  I just wanted to add 2 more minor things: a carefully calibrated
a dip-stick is a good way to measure the hot volumes of wort, and (shame
on me) Papazian's books have an estimate of the number of quarts or
gallons of sparge water per pound of grain.  On the dip-stick idea, I
use an aluminum rod which has a small 1" square foot aluminum welded to
the end (purely optional on the foot thing) that helps keep the rod
vertical when I make measurements.  I took a small file and made 1/2
gallon nicks in the rod from 1 gallon up to 10 gallons, and labeled the
rod with a permanent pen.  Nothing so fantastic is needed though.  A
wood dowel with pen lines on it is fine too.  When trying to get the
measurement critically correct, I place the dip-stick into the wort and
slide a tongue-depressor (otherwise known as a stick) down the dip-stick
until the depressor just touches the top of the wort, then I read that
point from my dip-stick.  As far as Papazian's rule of thumb for sparge
water goes, I can't remember what it was because I'm at work and my
books are at home, but I think it was about 1/2 gallon per pound of
grain.  For 10 pounds of grain, that'd produce about 5 gallons of wort
plus the initial liquid present in the mash for a total of around 7.5 to
8 gallon of wort (pre-boil)...I think that's what his estimate is.
Personally, I just heat up about 10 gallons of sparge water and sparge
until a) correct SG drops below 1.010, b) pH rises above 6.0, or c) boil
pot is full.  Now that I have my new PolarWare 10-gallon pot, I usually
stop at or before rule a) says too, and I've never had a problem with
rising pH's.

Louis,


Are we talking about the same George J. Fix, Ph.D.?  If so, Brewers
Publications, a division of the AOB, just published his latest book, An
Analysis of Brewing Techniques.  (I have it sitting on my desk.  It's looks
like a great book.  I haven't read it yet, but I know where you can get a
copy.)  Dr. Fix will not only be a Judge on the Professional Panel Blind
Tasting (PPBT) for the GABF, but will also lead one of the Beer Tours for
the AHA at the Members Only Tasting.  Dr. Fix has also graciously offered
his time and expertise to be a Guest Speaker on AHA's TechTalk.  Dr. Fix,
as I pointed out in my previous posting, was instrumental in changing the
Koelsch category in the AOB Style Guidelines for 1998.  We consult with him
fairly regularly.  As a matter of fact, I talked to him before posting my
comments in reference to the Koelsch category question.  (I did that to
verify my facts and to not speak for a man that I hold in such high
regard.)


Admittedly, I don't know all of the AHA history of all of the personalities
in the brewing community.  And when I started working at the AHA, I did
attempt to look into past goings on.  However, it's very unproductive.  Jim
Parker and I agree that if the AHA is to move forward, we need to look in
that direction.  Not backwards.  I hope that George Fix, you and others
sense this and work with us towards uniting the brewing community not
dividing it.


The entire AHA staff is now made up of new people and we're willing to work
towards the future and the betterment of homebrewing.  It gets a little
frustrating when you're still commenting on incidences that happened when
our predecessors were here.  We know there were problems in the past.  We
are here to make changes and improve the AHA in the future.




You also brought up the BJCP as an "alternative to the AHA".  In know the
split between the AHA and the BJCP in 1995 was ugly and many are still
upset.  But, again that's history.  I think it is good to have two separate
organizations.  It keeps things in check.  But I don't see the BJCP as an
alternative, rather I see both organizations complimenting each other.  At
least that's the direction that I am working in.


For the record, the AHA currently works closely with the BJCP.  The money
received from every competition that is sanctioned with the AHA is split
with the BJCP for them to supply a judges list.  


The AHA's mission (and we take it to heart) is to promote homebrewing.  As
other groups, businesses and organizations pop up, our attitude is if it
will help homebrewing we'll do our best to help them.


PS - Louis, thanks for agreeing to lead one of the MOT tours.  You and I
can arm wrestle over your kevlar vest!  See you there!


Keep Brewin'

Subject: Brewer frustrations


I'm an extract brewer who has had what I consider a few successful batches
consumed.  I stopped by the friendly local brew shop yesterday, to stock up
for the next brews.  Wanting to make a pale ale and a stout, I ordered a
pound of crystal and a pound of roasted barley.  They asked if I wanted it
crushed, which I did.  I looked around while the process was going on,
picking up some other items and not finding several others.  When I paid
the bill, I noticed the grain sack had 1# crystal, 1# roasted.  Not putting
1+1 together, I put it in the car and went on my way.  When I started
putting things away, I opened the grain sack to remove the 2 sacks of
grain--I thought.  To my dismay, the roasted and crystal was combined!


My question is-what to do with the grain.  I looked at the few books I
have, none have the 2 grains combined.  If I make a stout, can I add some
more roasted, or just throw it away?


I take some blame for not being painfully specific, but the guy never asked
if I wanted them separate or together.  I have avoided mail order to
support the local guy, this was the final straw.  No wonder his business
has fallen off, as evidenced by the dwindling stock.  grumble, grumble.  I
even had the brief flash of opening my own shop, but sanity prevailed.  


On a happier note, I used liquid yeast for the first time-Wyeast #1098 for
a pale ale.  Following the package instructions for starter, it said to
pitch when reaching high kraeusen-about 12 hours.  After 36 hours, not much
was going on yet, so I made my beer and pitched it any way, thinking that I
could use a package of dry yeast if nothing happened.  Boy, was I wrong.
It took off like a rocket.  OG was 1046, and 3 days later 1010.  Made a
believer out of me so far.  I'll rack to secondary tomorrow, and am looking
forward to the final product.


Thanks for any ideas on the grain.


Tom

About 6 months ago, I purchased 4 (10 gallon) oak barrels from a small
company out of Calistoga, CA.  The name of the company is Micro-Barrel
(707) 942-1521.  They make to-order barrels of any size and from any type of
oak.  What's really neat is that he can use previously used oak from the
wine industry.  This saves on the breaking in time (white or red wine
barrels).  I'm using mine for lambics and sour browns.  They are priced
about what others cost, if not a little less.  Plus, the quality is
outstanding, and like the others, they are guaranteed.  Hope this helps.

        Hate to, but have to disagree... Al is right, but.....
        I have used them for quite some time, not only for homebrewing, but also
in some other setting...as a 'filter' for an inadequate mash tun design,
but also for dry-hopping.....nylon is a great material, you can boil it to
death....and quite cheap too, in this application.....
        Recognized the dye issue, and called the manufacturer....spoke to one
person after the other and so on.... the manufacturers also sell what the
call 'greige' (pronounced 'grey') goods, which are the hose, undyed, to
other companies, which then dye and package them for other markets, and
price ranges....
        I think they lost interest in me, when they learned that I would only want
100 pairs per year of the undyed stuff....they are used to selling a
hundred thousand pairs....
        So, back to square one......buy them in 3-packs at the grocery store, five
or six boxes at a time...the lightest shade available, for lowest dye
content...take them home, and add to boiling water,  all at once in a 3
gallon pot for 5 min.....pull them out, allow to cool...wring, rinse,
re-boil ( that is, add them to another batch of boiling water) for 5
min....cool....then wash them in the home washer, no soap, then into the
dryer......untangle the bloody mess that they were, and take them back to
the brewery for use as a filtration aid and for dry-hopping......YMMV...

I have tried my best to keep from posting on this subject, hoping it would
stop and we all could get back to REAL brewing issues.  This in not a
question of anything but ownership, if the recipe was developed as a part
of the job the employer owns it.  In this case it would be immoral for the
brewmaster who is no longer employed to call it his, it is owned by his
former employer.  If it was developed before his employment or on his own
time and expense it is owned by the brewmaster.  I have to believe, from
what I have seen here,  that in this case ownership is in the hands of the
brewpub(LABC) and they had every right to do with it what they pleased, if
not why were brewing notes at the pub in the first place.  I beg of all of
you, make your own decision on this matter, if you think boycotting is a
good idea then by all means never go there again, but if they serve a good
product and you like then go back again and again.  I wish the Little Apple
Brewing Company was closer to my home I would go and give it a try, if they
serve good beer, I'd go back.
