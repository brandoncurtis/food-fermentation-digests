Subject: Thanks again!


Thanks to everyone who gave me their preferences for phalse bottoms /
easymashers with a seven gallon Gott. Personally, I'm going to go with a phalse
bottom, and some of the accessories for same from HopTech (no affiliation,
blah, blah, blah). While that may be the more expensive way to go, I am not in
the LEAST mechanically inclined so this will make things as easy as possible
(also makes it easy for Santa to get the stuff for me ;) )


Until I can scrape enough money together for a ten gallon SS pot, I'm going to
be trying no-sparge brewing for the time being. At which point, I will probably
try batch sparging and see how I like it. Basically, I'm so keyed about the
possibility of doing all-grain brewing I can hardly contain myself!


Thanks again, oh mighty collective!
  Matt

Subject: Bells Amber Ale Zealot


Ok, I've searched the HBD archives and surfed the net for an hour on this
one, so I'm certain it's "Postworthy" (aka Spongeworthy from Seinfeld...).


Bells Amber Ale from Kalamazoo Michigan.  


I'm thinking' its the ultimate American/homebrewlike/micro ale.  I drink
SNPA, Sprecher, Goose Island, etc.. But nothing like a fresh Bells from
neighboring Michigan ( I swear whenever I'm in MI I'm not a F.I.P...)


Anyone know what yeast they use?  I thought it was Wyeast 1056, or Wyeast
1272 until I drank a bunch tonight and then had a homebrew that I made with
Wyeast 1335 British Ale II and it tastes the same.  I'm sure I could steal
the yeast from one of their bottles, but I prefer fresh cultures to the stuff
that's in the secondary...  Besides it's fun to know for sure (Who hasn't
made a SNPA clone from fresh Wyeast and has enjoyed the hell out of it? 
Giggling about how close it tastes to the real thing...)


Anyone know if they use Lager malt?  I'm sure they use domestic malts.  Larry
Bell has made too much money to be buying the 'xpensive imported stuff.  What
maltsters  I'm sure its something nearby. Anyone in Kzoo notice what trucks
stop by the brewery?


Hops don't really taste like Cascade, so I would believe domestic Goldings. 
Anyone know what hops?


Anyway, I make what I think is a close second to the Bronze Michigan
nectar...


British Lager malt, Some wheat, some crystal, dash of Special B.  Wyeast 1335
Yeast.  Willamette and EKG hops.


ANYONEKNOWFERSURE?

I guess there's pretty much nothing people won't think of to try.  Why
not? - go for it!  And you can call it "Rock Bottom Ale"?


This article seemed to make the most sense:

I don't think you have any graywacke down there, (Southern CA) but
sounds like what you want is just a good hard, dense rock.  
Sandstone like from Lake Powell or probably around where you live 
is not the right stuff - much too friable
and crumbly compared to graywacke, which can be almost like basalt.

THAT sounds like BS!  I doubt that graywacke is going to expand any more
or
less than any other kind of rock, in any case, it's pretty negligible
anyway.  If you want more surface area, add another rock!

Right.  As one of the other posts mentioned, avoid things like shale or
slate, or pretty much anything foliated (having a planar fabric). 
They'll
actually start to spall when you HEAT them!


I think a great place to look would be a good-sized stream or river that
carries rocks of the right size - like about fist-size, and look for a
nice, well-rounded piece of granite, basalt, quartzite, or whatever. 
The river will do the work of breaking up the rocks that might otherwise
shatter on you because of small fractures or whatever, and it's the 
sharp corners that might start to break off when super hot, so if you 
use a well-rounded stone to start with you'll probably be in good shape. 
Don't know if you can find anything suitable around Costa Mesa, but 
there'd be plenty of good rocks coming out of the San Bernardino Mts.,
or to the south on the coast.  Try Trestles!

Seems about right - like 3 or 4 fist-size stones per 5 gallons?  I think
you want to maximize surface area by using several smaller stones rather
than one large one.

I think you definitely want to do it this way, not just heat them with
propane like one guy did.  Here's a temperature guide (in Celsius):


about 500 - dullest red glow you can see in the dark.
about 550-575 - dull red glow visible in the light.


Doubt you can get it much hotter than that.  Whatever you do, don't drop

I posted a question a few days ago asking about the discussion of
homebrew books authored by members of the HBD. I got a large resonse so
I thought I would summarize the results.


        1) All of the replys felt that discussion of the books is proper
in this forum.


        2) Most of the people replying are waiting for either Alk's book
or Dr. Fix's new book to be published. Al's book is out, I know this
after having contact with him. I was told via a 3rd party that Dr. Fix's
new book is also avialable. I just recieved a another email saying that
the Fix book will be out Nov 1.(?) Thought the forum might want to know.

Subject: Dropping Homebrew


George De Piro wonders:


     I have a question about "dropping" beer into the secondary to increase
     diacetyl (this also rouses highly flocculent yeast . . . Could it be that
     breweries that aerate the ferment to rouse the yeast are also severely
     shortening the shelf life of their products?


     Anybody out there have any ideas about how this effects the shelf-life
     of homebrew?   Must beer fermented in this way be drunk relatively
     young (lending itself to cask conditioning and serving, perhaps?).


Around last St. Patty's Day I bottled my Imperial Stout, Dreadlocks and
Shamrocks.  The OG was 1.112 and the FG was around 1.022.  I think that I
used ESB Wyeast 1968 (notes are home).  But I know that I dropped the beer
to the secondary after the initial 2 days of vigorous fermentation.  At
that point the gravity had dropped to the mid 40s.  The aeration definately
kicked the yeast into another fermentation cycle, and I continued to rouse
the yeast for a couple of weeks as the fermentation subsided.


I've been slowly nipping at this batch for a few months (but the bulk of if
will be quaffed next March 17!), and have only noticed improvement in the
flavor.  There are no cardboardy elements to the beer's taste that could
have been caused by oxidation.  Granted, this is the biggest of big beers
that I've ever made, so the flavor could be hiding some slight flaws.  But,
bottom line, it's storing well and improving.

From: Jeff Renner <nerenner`at`umich.edu>
Subject: Lagering Procedure


In Homebrew Digest #2526 (October 09, 1997), "Jeff Johnson"
<jdj`at`mindspring.com> asked some questions about his first lager, an
Oktoberfest.  In the interest of saving space, I've not quoted his
original,  You remember what he said, doncha?


Oats are a little weird in a German style, but you knew that when you
decided to use them, didn't you?


Sounds good.  A mashout at 170F is a good idea, too, if you can do it
without too much trouble.  It's Hallertauer, BTW.  I hope you kept the
bittering and hop character low.  This is a style that should shout
"MALT!"and whisper "(and a little hops to balance)".


There is the argument that it is best to grow your yeast at as close to the
actual fermentation conditions as possible, so doing the starter at 50F is
probably better than warmer temps, but most people, including yeast
producers, do it at warmer temps for speed of reproduction.  The reasons
for fermenting lagers at cold temps is flavor (and inhibition of spoilage
critters), but you won't be drinking the starter, so that shouldn't matter.


You were right not to pitch at the higher temps as many often do for a
quicker start.  It's a temptation.  The off flavor (esters, etc) production
comes during the reproductive stage, so the practice of warm start is poor
practice.  Good for you.  With a really big pitch (yours is big, but an
ounce of thick paste per gallon is best for lagers), I usually get low
kraeusen at 24-30 hrs, and high kraeusen 12 hours later.  With your
technically underpitch, you should still see things going by 72 hours,
especially since your 54F start is a little on the warm side.  German
technique, with a bigger pitch, is to start in the low 40sF and let the
heat of fermentation take it to the upper 40sF.. With 5 gallons, of course,
you'll lose heat so fast that there won't be much of a temp. rise.  I
generally ferment at 48-50F.  Iodophor in the airlock is overkill, and can
ruin beer in the unlikely case of suckback so vigorous that it pulls some
of the solution into the beer.  Water works fine, and vodka is good if you
want to make sure nothing grows in it.


A more typical pattern is to start lowering the temp when fermentation
slows down pretty much, but there is still some kraeusen and gas
production, so that the contraction of volume of beer and gas in headspace
is exceeded by gas production, so you don't pull any air in.  This is
usually at about 10 days for me.  You should be within a couple of points
of FG at this point.  A degree F drop per day is too slow, IMO.  I go for
3F/day, and take it right down to 33 in 5 or 6 days.  One exception is if
the yeast you use throws diacetyl, in which case, you may need a diacetyl
rest of a day at 60F+.  I never have needed this.  I'd skip the two weeks
at 44F.  It it isn't done at 50F, give it some more time at that temp.  44
is neither ideal ferm. or lagering temp.  As soon as fermentation is over,
you might as well start lagering, which will drop out protein and reduce
those sulfurous and other green beer aromas and flavors.


Sounds like you've made a good start.  Let me know how it turns out.  Hope
everyone appreciates it at Thanksgiving.

Subject: Survey


Preliminary results in the HBD survey are in.  The number of responses
has tailed off in the last few days, so maybe it's time to report some
results.  I give no "confidence limits", no "plus-or-minus" on this.
See below for disclaimer.  As you may recall, in a message in HBD
2520, Jeff Sturman claimed that "95% of the digest's content is
totally useless to 95% of home brewers." The question then is whether
the digest's readership is typical of the home brewers that Jeff
knows.  I think the numbers here indicate that this is most likely not
the case.


The survey is still open at http://hubris.engin.umich.edu:8080/hbdsurvey.html.

Just a nit: guanosine and adenosine are _not_ products of protein degradation.
They are 2 of the constituents of RNA and DNA. But malt has a lot of DNA and
RNA because during the malting process the plant embryo is encouraged to grow.
This process involves a lot of cell divisions and associated DNA replications.
So a barley seed has much less RNA and DNA than a kernel of malted barley 
because the seed hasn't undergone the huge number of cell divisions that took
place during the malting process.

This is not a guess: I made a Maple Brown Ale (called Waffale) where I used 
1 (one) quart of maple syrup in a lightly hopped standard brown ale batch. 
When the beer had warmed up a bit after being poured into the glass, I could
convince myself that the maple taste was perceptible. I would recommend, based
on this datum, that you use at least a half gallon of syrup. I detected no
off flavors from the sugar (fructose most likely) contributed by the syrup.

Subject: Holy Hop Mistake, Batman!


Howdy all,


I had a heck of a brew night last night. On top of 
several minor errors, I really screwed up my hopping.


I forgot to add them. OOPS!


Anyway, I remembered (that I forgot to add) the hops
just as I was turning on the water to my chiller.
So back on the stove it goes, I add 1/2 gal of water,
and add the hops. I then boiled for about another 30
minutes. To make up for the lower utilization, I used
about 30% extra hops. Anyone know of problems I may have
because my only hop addition was late? How about
a 130 minute boil instead of a 90 minute boil?
This was a SNPA clone. The bitter wort tasted fine
by the time I was done, but at 1:30 AM, I think my 
tastebuds might have already gone to bed. I know
my brain was absent the whole night.....


Thanks!

Subject: Fast Fermentation


I've brewed a couple of batches so far, and they seem to be getting better 
with time.  My last couple of batches, though, seem to have fermented awful 
fast.  I used 7lbs extract and one packet of Edme dry yeast (started 
according to How to Brew your First Batch).


Vigorour activity occured after 12 hours, and throughout the first day.  On 
the second day, it had slowed down to about 3-5 bubbles per minute and the 
krausen fell.  By the third day, it was less than 1 bubble per minute!  I 
plan on waiting until a week has passed, but is this okay?  I know...don't 
worry!


QUESTION 2:  All of my batches thus far have had a peculiar "tangy" taste.  
It is the type of taste that makes your saliva glands "swell" after it hits 
them.  Not really bitter, or puckery, but just "mediciney" I guess.  Is 
there something I may be doing that causes this taste?  All of my brews are 
malt extract, which some people say causes this taste.  Would shifting to 
DME help?  The other thing people have pointed out is the dry yeast.  Would 
shifting to liquid yeast help?


Thanks to everyone for your time and help!

Subject: Pasteurising a keg of beer (INFECTION!)




Well, let me start this post off with a little bit of a lesson
to people who become lazy, complacent, or whatever with their
brewing.  


Over the summer I did just this.  It was a standing joke between
me and my brewing friends.  I'd be doing something with my beer
(brewing, kegging, bottling, whatever), and I'd say "Well, I used
to do XXX, but I've been lazy lately".  As the summer progressed
I became lazier and lazier.  My 15 minute soak in bleach went
down to 10 minutes, then 5, then 2.  All sorts of things I normally
never thought I'd do, I was now doing.


Then I decided enough was enough.  I knew that I'd end up with
an infection, so I changed my ways and started doing things the
right way again.  A week later I noticed an infection in my 
cherry ale.  No big deal -- it is normal when you don't pasteurize
the fruit, as I didn't.  Now I've got an infection in my beer
brewed with corn meal.


In any case, I don't anticipate any more infections because I'm
not lazy anymore.  But I do want to rescue the beer that was 
infected from the times when I was lazy.  What I was thinking of
first was racking it into my pot, bring it up to 150F or 160F,
hold for 5 minutes, then chill it and bottle.  But then I thought
maybe I'd rack it into a keg, put the keg in my pot, fill the
pot with water, fire up the burner and pasteurize the thing right
in the keg.


Anyone see a problem with this 2nd option?  The only potential 
problem I see is if my keg were pressurized.  But the beer will
be right out of the 2ndary, so that shouldn't be a problem.

I will keep this short as I know it applies only to a rather small 
percentage of HBDers. The worst decision I ever made in my
life was to not start taking allopurinol soon enough. I suffer 
permanent damage to the joints in my ankles for that bit of 
idiotic stubbornness.


Allopurinol is about as cheap as aspirin, and while I know 
there can be side effects, I have none that are consequential. 
(My urine smells funny.) I've been taking it for over 5 years 
now-after putting it off for 7 years. Before, I had to ration 
myself one beer per day (and still suffered gout attacks). 
Now I am not limited (by gout - just moderation). I have not 
had the slightest gout since the first month or so after 
starting to take allopurinol.


If like me, your physician suggests it and you decide to turn 
it down because you just don't like medicine-doctors-hospitals,
think again.

PLEASE DON'T.  Or post a summary once you come to general agreement.
I say this as someone who currently doesn't give a rat's ash about
beer color calculations.


This is going to sound really pompous, but I believe it's true:
  HBD isn't just a place for us to get together and work out our own
  little brewing problems.  It's a record of how those problems got
  solved, and a repository of shared and discovered knowledge.


I recently used the HBD search engine to verify some data from my
local store, and got a big dose of useful info besides.


In the current case we have knowledgeable people discussing how the
color scales are related and how pigments affect beer color, referring
both to standard references and recent research.  This discussion and
these references will reside in the HBD archives for years to come,
easing the research of dozens (if not hundreds) of other brewers who
care about predicting the color of their beer from the grain.


On a future day, I might mature my brewing to where I care about all
that.  I want to see the information exchanged, the references used
and the answers found.  Please don't hide it from that future me.


I'd have to track you down and interrogate you.

Tim.Watkins`at`analog.com asked about using expandable foam to boost the
insulation value of his fridge. I just used some called 'Great Stuff' to
patch the holes in my old serving fridge. It's very messy but works well. I
believe it is a type of expanding urethane foam. The fridge I used it on was
already insulated with urethane so material compatability was not an issue. I
don't know if squirting this stuff in the wall cavities of a fridge insulated
with fiberglass is a good idea. It would probably compact the fiberglass in
to the corners reducing the insulation value where the foam does not
penetrate. How you thought about putting styrofoam sheets on the outside? Me
thinks it might be less of a buttache.

I understand. I went in the gararge but for other reasons...

I bought just the burner from "King Cooker" and built the stand to hold
a half barrel keg that I had the top plasma cut off. It is around 175k
BTU. I got the hose and regulator/shutoff valve that attaches to your
propane tank. If you are handy you can weld or bolt some angle iron
together to hold your burner and pot.
 I do not have the address or phone number as it was a few years ago but
there are two companies if I remember right, King Cooker and Cajen
cooker, or somethign like that, if you go to Wallmart or K-Mart, they
sell the whole thing. I think I got the phone number off the box and
just ordered parts, cost me less than 50 bucks with the angle iron.


>(And I will make sure my brewing area is properly ventilated, so you
don't

I open the gararge door, when done I hose the floor off and have a few
brews!


Hope this helps.

Subject: Rests and modified malts


        First of all, let me say that I've been hooked on HBD for about 2 weeks now.
 I think the interaction between "experienced" and "beginner", "science" and
"art", etc. is just the most amazing thing going, and can only advance the
state of homebrewing.
        I've been brewing for about 2 years, and have advanced to all-grain
exclusively.  The recent thread on rests and well modified malts has got me
thinking (and questioning).  Since I went to all-grain almost a year ago, I
have, as standard procedure, been employing 3 rests in my mashing: 30 min. at
122 F.,  15 min. at 149 F., and 20 min. at 158 F., with a 5 min. mash out at
168 F.  My question is this:  In using well modified malts, what will be the
difference in the wort (and hence my beer) between the schedule above, and a
single step mash at, say, 149 F or 156 F ?
        Appreciate any and all help,

Speaking Of Science And Home Brewing....


Decloaking and raising shields!


Greetings Beerlings! [ I love that salutation and just HAD to say it just once!]


I am new to home brewing,  having only about 25 (maybe 30? Just started
keeping detailed records...)  extract batches under my belt since last
November...and soon plan to move on to full grain. 


I don't claim to know much about science,  and do claim to know less about
art...But I do know I really like Grandma's home made apple pie....But
what's that got to do with BEER?


I have noticed that I enjoy the clear transparency of the beer coming out of
my kegs at the end of their life.  Usually the last glasses are noticeably
clearer than the first, so much so that I can tell when a keg is about to
run out.


The "Art vs. Science" observation recently posted in the HBD is something
that has struck me as well,  over my almost-first-year of brewing.  But I
think in a totally positive way.  I had been thinking thoughts along these
lines,  and actually wrote the body of this message about a month ago,  for
possible posting to the HBD,  as my way of trying to express something that
I could not really put into meaningful words (not to imply that anything
stated here is meaningful...).


If I have a choice,  I ALWAYS choose home-made apple pie,  with its
irregular texture but superior taste, over what they sell in the stores.
And no one EVER lets out the slightest mummer of complaint,  even though
Grandma's pies are quite different from the mass produced ones...


When I visit the farm I look forward to nothing better than a glass of that
cloudy,  brown cider.  So apple-like! No way can that processed
crystal-clear apple juice they sell at the supermarket compare the farm-made
stuff.  The farmer does not try to emulate the processed stuff,  and I am
grateful that he does not.


As homebrewers,  many of us strive for clear beer.  We use clarifying agents
or filters.  Or various other techniques. Why?  I think this goal ranks
second only to perfect sanitation.  As a newbie I could be wrong though...


On one hand we scorn the beer of the Big Boys make:  Keg wash,  that is what
it is!  Yet we worry about clarity.  I do too.  I like the look of the beer
as it drops clear as my kegs are running out. I make excuses for cloudy beer
as I serve it to guests:  "It's a little cloudy (chill haze) but it tastes
good..."  I can't imagine Grandma saying "It not as smooth as super market
pie,  but it tastes good..."  Why do I make excuses and apologize for a good
tasting brew?  Must be my scientific side speaking,  rather than whatever
amount of artist I have in me...


So,  I wonder,  have I been brainwashed over the years by the processed
beers of the big producers?  Does my technical background and employment
tend to push me to want technical perfection? 


An appreciation of the hand-crafted qualities of homebrew is evolving as I
continue to brew... I am beginning to consider chill haze a positive
quality!  It is a trait you will never find in most mega-mass-produced
brews, for sure.


I am beginning to serve my hazy beer with pride.  I probably will now
apologize as it clears towards the end of the keg!  I will emphasize to my
guests that they can't get a REAL beer like this just anywhere.  It is not
filtered at all.  100% natural goodness.  No preservatives or additives.
And it tastes GOOD, GOOD, GOOD!  Remember how much you like home-made apple
pie and farm-made cider?  Get ready to enjoy a REAL BEER.  But be  careful,
you may get hooked!  There is so much goodness in that glass that you can
hardly see through it!  AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO MAKE IT!


Boy am I glad I got that off my chest....and yes,  we do own a pressure
cooker :-)  And no,  I wrote this one afternoon at work, nothing was in the
pipeline, and all my kegs were dry...boy I wish I could be more
technical...but that is why I read the  HBD, hoping some of that stuff will
rub off...unsolicited samples of hazy homebrew welcomed if sent
prepaid...naturally:-)  


Repeat after me:  THE HBD IS GOOD!  THE HBD is GREAT!  The HBD is G....


I have learned a lot from lurking here.  You are a great bunch of guys...I
truly feel this forum has greatly accelerated my brewing experience.  Keep
that technical stuff coming!


Turning lurker mode back on now...


Cloaking again,  and keeping shields raised....


Hey Homer!  Grab me another homebrew and get your butt over here!  Jethro,
you wanna come?


Beam us up,  Scottie!


Bill


PS - In case my sig file comes across...no better way to make room for
homebrew than by commuting 32 miles per day by bicycle:-)


When climbing slowly, with 90 LB of bike and gear
Or flying down the other side, sailing through the air
There is no question; in MY mind it's clear
I am both the turtle, AND the hare!

The secret to getting the pumpkin flavor into your pumpkin beer is in the
preparation of the pumpkins themselves.  Use small bowling ball sized "Neck"
or "Pie" pumpkins.  With a medium sized knife carefully remove the stem. With
a larger knife split the pumpkin in half top to bottom. With your large metal
brewing spoon remove all the seeds and attached spindules. Now the scientific
part. Measure the diameter of the cross section. Measuring around the fattest
part of the pumpkin (equator) determine the distance around the hemisphere.
Double this to obtain the circumference. The secret of the pumpkin flavor is
to divide the circumference by its diameter....  ;<)

I just couldn't resist commenting after reading Jethro's post regarding 
the Belgian Red. Living right down the highway from New Glarus has its 
advantages. One of these being that our brew club was able to have a tour 
of the brewery with Dan Carey. He was most graciuos and interesting to 
talk to. He also appeared to enjoy talking to a group that at least had a 
basic understanding of his work. At one point he went out and got a 
pitcher of the Belgian Red before it was to be transferred to the 
secondary and onto the cherries. I tell you that beneath all that fruit 
that blew Jethro away was an amazing beer that just blew ME away. It is 
apparently based on a Belgian Brown. It was sweet and sour and had a 
slight taste of black tea. Really hard to describe. He talked about 
bringing it out as a seasonal without the cherries. But I haven't seen it 
yet. I plan on buying a case when it comes out. If any of you run into 
Dan or Deb you may mention you heard about this amazing beer that 
they're not selling. It goes to show you that if you want to make a great 
fruit beer, first make a great beer, (choose a style that is not heavily 
bitter) and then use great fruit.
        All this enthusiasm makes me thirsty!

Umm, I guess that would be the last competition I judged at, the Spirit
of Free Beer in June. A dark mild won out of 401 entries.  Second BOS
went to a weizen, and 3rd to a barleywine. I used to think that the big
guy always wins, and entered overstrength porters and IPAs, until I
started to get comments on judging sheets like "Great beer, but too big
for style." Or "Try this at a lower gravity."  I've tried to mend my
ways.
