Splitting the boil works reasonably well.  I have a double-oven stove,
which doesn't have room for a pot larger than 5 gallons.  (Yeah, I
know... time to get a propane cooker...)  I do a split boil, on the two
front burners.


But, to answer Matt's original question, yes partial all-grain boils
*are* possible.  I've done a few 5 gallon batches this way, in a single
5 gallon pot.  The basic drill is to use more grain, to compensate for
the low extraction efficiency you'll get with this approach; collect
about 4 gallons of runoff (which will boil down to about 3); and top up
to 5 gallons in the fermenter.  This approach is somewhat wasteful of
grain, but hey grain is (relatively) cheap.


You'll need to tweak things once you figure out your overall extraction
efficiency with this approach.  To start with, try using 25% more grain
than you'd use if you were doing things the "normal" way.  You'll also
need to bump up the bittering hops a bit, to compensate for the lower
hop utilization (due to the higher gravity boil).


Andy Ager asks about doing his first all-grain batch:
> Questions: 1) Mash water should be about 17-20 degrees hotter than

It depends somewhat on what temp the grain is at to start with, and how
much heat the walls of your mash tun abosorb.  IMO, it's better to
undershoot than overshoot.  I'd actually suggest having the strike water
a little cooler than this, then bringing the temp up with small amounts
of additional boiling water as necessary.  Once you've done it a couple
of times, you'll have a better feel for how your system behaves, and
will be able to get away with cutting things a lot closer.


> 2)  At 1.25 qts/lb., mash would be a touch over 10 qts of water.  Sparge

Probably closer to 5-1/2 or 6.  Quite a bit of water will remain trapped
in the grain... crushed malt soaks up water like a sponge.

I've done something like 50 all-grain batches, and I *still* don't
bother checking mash pH.  I usually add a little lactic acid (1/4 tsp)
to my sparge water, but that's about it.  If (like me) you're using
Chicago water, you really shouldn't have too much to worry about in the
pH area...

Subject: Philosophy of Brewing: Art vs. Engineering


Joe Yoder made the interesting observation that homebrewing relies most on
the engineering thought process.  Nice point, but too myopic, I feel.


Consider a statement on the seemingly unrelated topic of digital culture
that I just read in "The New Breed of Cyberpundits (_Upside_, November
1997, p. 192):  Steven Johnson writes, "Any professional trend-spotter will
tell you that the worlds of technology and culture are colliding. . . . But
it's not the collision itself that surprises--it's that the collision is
considered news. You'd think the life of da Vinci or Edison would be enough
to convince us that the creative mind and the technical mind have long
cohabitated."


And clearly, homebrewing employs both the creative and the technical
talents of the brewer's mind.  And in fact, they are the same talent.

Subject: RE: Gout & Beer


Andy Walsh gives a nice summary of Gout and Beer, but the subject is not


as clear cut as he makes it out.  I have had severe gout attacks, read
experts who say the exact opposite from each other, and I now rely on by


my own experiences:


1. Standing on my feet at a trade show and walking around a golf course
tend to set off gout attacks.  I try to avoid the former.  I have never
found a correlation between beer or food with my attacks and some
authors say "some people can be helped by low purine diet" but that diet


has little impact on most suffers.  Others experts say to maintain a low


purine diet.


2. You do not have to take allopurinol for the "rest of your life".  My
father stopped having attacks altogether at about 60 (over 15 years ago)


and no longer takes the medicine.


Best I can say is that gout is not the same in all individuals.  If I
found out beer caused attacks, I would drink mead, wine, cider or
whatever didn't (and I wouldn't mind experimenting).  Not being able to
walk for a month is a serious problem.

if you're really peeved at the hb store, you might want to print a copy 
of the archive stuff you found and this note and give it to the owner.  


I wonder about what I'm doing right in serving from a keg.  I've seen
the data on pressure drop per foot of tubing and how that depends
on the i.d. of the tubing.  I believe the data.


But I never have a problem and don't worry about pressures.  I have
three feet of 3/16" tubing with cobra taps.  I usually carbonate by
cranking the PSIs up to 30 or so and shaking.  after a few days near
33F (and some extra shaking) I'm getting fairly carbonated beer.  I
don't like too much carbonation, so I'm pretty happy at this point.


I don't have the CO2 in the fridge; I top up the carbonation when I
serve.  I usually top up to 20 psi, maybe 17 or 18 or so.  I get a rush
of beer into the glass, but the beer quickly settles into a glass of
beer with a nice head.  I get a little of the settling effect as that
seen in guinness, but of course it settles much faster.  


I'm not planning to change my procedures, but is there a difference
between a door mounted tap and a cobra tap?  Is the door tap
more picky about the pressure at the tap?

Subject: Pre-Gelatinized Grains


I spoke with the good folks at Briess Malting Co., and got the scoop on
this "Pre-Gelatinized" thing.  All of you who told me that no boiling
was necessary were absolutely right, but no one seemed to know why, or
what it meant.


So,  here's the story:  Pre-Gelatinized grains have the moisture content
brought way up, then they are roasted, not enough to brown them, but
they are basically Torrefied.  Then, they get flaked (rolled).  This
makes all of the starch available for the mash.  Simply relying on the
heat of the rolling process (like rolled oats, etc.) to do the
gelatinization does not necessarily completely gelatinize the grain, and
you may have problems.

I don't see why he would lose 1/2 gallon twice.  The losses in the kettle
are due to wort trapped in the break and hops.  Granted, there might be
less break in the unhopped kettle (because hop tannins contribute to
break formation), but losses to hops will be half as much in each kettle
if you split the hops, no?


As for utilization, while there are no formulas that currently account
for utilization losses due to the amount of hops added, I'm sure that
this is a factor.  That there is nothing in the professional literature
is not surprising... what professional brewer with the assets to do
this kind of research would be interested in 50, 60, or 70+ IBU beers?


There is a solubility limit given virtually any solute and solvent and
I'm sure that alpha acids in wort are no exception.  Also, as I've posted
before, I'm pretty sure that solubility is not a step function -- it's
an asymptote (chemists, help?) so that as we increase the hop rate, I
would be very surprised if there is not a gradual decrease in utilization.


Back to break formation for a second... I know that it has been posted
in the HBD, that break formation is helped along by hops.  I don't
recall at the moment whether the pro texts confirm this.  In Brewing
Science, Vol. 3, Moll noted, however, that there was less haze made from
beer that was made from wort that was boiled without hops relative to both
"lightly" and "moderately" hopped worts.  Mind you, our high-protein
boils may *require* more polyphenols than commercial brewers' worts,
so this may not be true for us (clearly, more research is needed).


However, this is really a moot point in our case, because the hops will
be in the wort one way or another... whether they are all in one kettle
or split between two kettles.  I would split the hops between the two
kettles.

Not necessary, and IMHO not recommended.  Maybe the author used an
extremely flocculent top-fermenting yeast and had to rouse it back into
solution a lot or something ... or maybe someone told *them* to do that
and it seemed to work, so why not?  But you're right.  Even though cider
isn't as bad as beer wort at taking on new infections, it is not
self-preserving until the alcohol by volume (abv) gets at or above 6%.
I'm not saying to make a cider that strong if you don't want to, but be
aware of this fact.  It won't hurt to leave it alone and not open it, as
you mentioned.

Not necessary, but won't hurt.  I make fine ciders with no racking at
all.  Also, the cider will likely take a minimum of a month to finish
fermenting.  I just let it sit in a 60-61 F (average temp) for 2 months
and then bottle it.  I do like a sparkling cider, but find that using
3/4 c. corn sugar like most beers would use is too much.  I use 1/2 c.
corn sugar, boiled and added in the same way that I do for beer, then I
bottle.

I made a mistake!  I forgot that when expressing the carbonate ion
concentration "as CO3", that because nearly all the carbonate exists (at
reasonable pH's) as HCO3 (1 Eq/M) and that CO3 is 2 Eq/M, that the total
ionic carbonate concentration should be reported as exactly twice what I
said in my original post!  My apologies ... something was bugging me
about the post and I looked into my water reports, did some
calculations, looked at A.J. deLange's work, and realized what I did.


Anyway, I want to restate the "Easy Method" as "Multiply your alkalinity
as mg/L CaCO3 by 1.2" instead.  I also correct another minor mistake in
step 5) below that tunes things in a bit.  So, there's a couple of
corrections if you are interested and they are all in step 5).  And I
corrected the terminology in steps 4) and 5).


Brian


- -------------------------------
Example:


Assuming you have the pH and "Alkalinity as mg/L CaCO3", here's an
example showing the calculations, and what you should enter into
Brewer's Workshop:


    Given) pH is 7.8, Alkalinity as mg/L CaCO3 is 128


Problem) Find HCO3 as mg/L HCO3


Solution) 


1) Calculate the following three magic numbers:


   r1 = 10^(pH-6.37)  = 10^(7.8 - 6.37) = 26.9153
   r2 = 10^(pH-10.25) = 10^(7.8-10.25) = 0.003548
   d  = 1 + r1 + r1r2  = 1 + 26.9153 + (26.9153)(0.003548) = 28.0108


2) Calculate the mole-fractions (more magic numbers):


   %H2CO3 = 1/d = 0.0357, or 3.57% of the carbonates is H2CO3 in
solution
   %HCO3   = r1/d = 26.9153/28.0108 = 0.9609, or 96.09%  " " HCO3 in
solution
   %CO3     = r1r2/d = (26.9153)(0.003548)/28.0108 = 0.003409, or
0.3401% " " CO3 in sol'n


   Note that only 0.3% of the available carbonates exists as CO3 at pH
7.8, and that as the pH is dropped, even less will be in solution ... it
all turns into HCO3!


3) Find the concentrations of HCO3 and CO3 in mg/L of CaCO3.  For this
you need the alkalinity equation (world standard nowadays):


   Alkn = <<HCO3>> + 2<<CO3>> + <<OH->> - <<H+>>, where <<species>>
means "Species as mg/L CaCO3".


3a) Find the concentration of OH-, e.g. <<OH->>:


   [H+]  = 10^-pH = 10^-7.8 = 1.5849 x 10^-8, We'll ignore this later
because it is so small


Then because [H+][OH-] = 10^-14,


   [OH-] = 10^-14/[H+] = 10^14 / 1.5849x10^-8 = 6.3095 x 10^-7 M or
6.3095 x 10^-4 mM


To express the [OH-] in "mg/L CaCO3", multiply by the gram molecular
weight of CaCO3:


   <<OH->> = 6.3095 x 10^-4 mM x 100.0892 mg/mM = 0.06315 mg/L as CaCO3


4) Find the total carbonates as mg/L CaCO3, ignoring the contribution of
H+ as previously mentioned:


   Total ionic carbonates =  Alkn - <<OH->> = <<HCO3>> + 2<<CO3>>, or


   Total ionic carbonates = 128 - 0.06315 =  127.9368 mg/L as CaCO3


5) Find the total carbonates "as mg/L CO3" instead of "mg/L CaCO3".  Do
this by finding the total carbonates, then by finding the HCO3 and CO3
individual concentrations, then by converting them to <CO3> as shown:


   Total ionic carbonates = 127.9368 mg/L as CaCO3

As I read the JIB paper cited below, this may not be so uncommon.  DNA
sequences capable of being hydridized to the POF1 gene are 'highly
conserved' in brewing yeast which did not express the decarboxylase
enzyme property.  The genetic hardware is present waiting for a mutation
or hydrization.  The point is that a significant number of ales yeast  -
*non-mutant* - according to limited studies *DO* decarboxylize ferulic
acid to 4VG in moderate amounts - same as wheat beer yeasts. Just how
are you certain that this was a mutation?


>The key point here is that since the phenolic

This is NOT the case presented in the paper McMurrough et al of Guinness
Research, JIB 102:327-332, 1996.  They state that mashing can be used to
control the final levels of 4VG and cite an examples using a
non-wheat-beer ale yeast ...


Two otherwise similar worts are prepared using differing mash schedules,
(Wort 'A' includes rests at 45C and 52C):
EOB = end of boil, EOF = end of fermentation


The flavor threshold for 4VG is about 0.3mg/L.


        ferulic`at`EOB    4VG`at`EOB         4VG`at`EOF
Wort A     6.6          0.28            0.70
Wort B     1.4          0.05            0.14


The mash schedule caused a tremendous difference in ferulic levels
(4X+). The boil caused a thermal degradation of some ferulic to 4VG;
0.28mg/L of 4VG in wort A, and the 0.05mg/L in B.  During fermentation
wort A increased by 0.42mg/L 4VG, while wort B increased by 0.09mg/L.
This increase precisely matches the ratio of free ferulic acid in the
wort [0.09/0.42 ~= 1.4/6.6].  In other words, because of the differing
mash schedule, beer A is at 2X the flavor threshold for 4VG while beer B
is at one half the flavor threshold.  Mash schedule can control 4VG
flavor.


This paper notes that intermediate 4VG producers (like wheat beer yeasts
and 4 of 19 ale yeasts) may have their 4VG proclivity controlled
effectively by mash schedule.  Of the wild yeasts and infectious
organisms, some, like S.bayanus are very strong 4VG producers, while
many others are moderate level producers similar to wheat and these ale
yeasts.

I'm not sure I understand this.  Taking 4VG from half the flavor
threshold to twice the flavor threshold doesn't sound like a "remote
point that is not going to make a real difference in flavor" to me.  I
think that this is pretty close to what I have tasted in some ales and I
don't care for it.


I went too far here in one sense. Decrease in  ferulic acid isn't a cure
for substantial infections and the (hopefully) miniscule levels of
infection that haunt most brewpots should not have threshold level
effects on 4VG either (otherwise there are other serious consequences to
contend with).  4VG appears to be an admitted product of some otherwise
normal (not mutant) ale yeasts and appears controllable by mash
techniques.  


Ferulic acid has also been shown to have several negative effects in
beer flavor aside from decarboxylation to 4VG (see M.Dadic, "Phenolic
and Beer Staling", MBAA Tech.Qtrly. 11:140). They claim that ferulic
will actively form carbonyls (diacetyl, X-nonenols, very low flavor
thresholds) with or without oxygen.  Other papers show ferulic will
decarboxylize to 4VG in acid beer at ambient temperatures.


Ferulic is one of the few phenolics over which we can exert some
specific control, and it's effects are mostly negative as I read the
literature.  It's major plus is that it is a mediocre anti-oxidant, but
there are much better ones in a typical beer.


To recap:  Ferulic acid has no particularly desirable quality impact in
normal ales and lagers (wheat beers and lambics excepted).  It's levels
can be significantly reduced by avoiding 43C-45C rests.  Ferulic acid
itself, even at quite high levels, does not have a damaging effect on
flavor - but it can lead to negative flavors indirectly.  Ferulic acid
*may* enhance some staling reactions.  Most seriously, excess ferulic
will, in all probability, cause above threshold levels of 4VG
(clove-like spicy flavor) when fermentation is accomplished with certain
ale yeast strains which are not normally identified with wheat beer
fermentation.  High wort levels of ferulic acid can also thermally
degrade into flavor threshold levels of 4VG due to the boil and also
degrade into 4VG due to acid beer storage conditions.


I am not making a blanket condemnation of 40C-45C rests, but brewers
should be aware of the possible consequences of these rests on ferulic
acid levels and thus beer flavor when designing a mash schedule and
selecting yeast.

Threshold has been reported as 660 mg/L as compared with a normal range
of 1 - 10 mg/L in typical wort.  So ferulic acid is essentially

Several potential antioxidants have been screened for antioxidant
activity using five assays. Based on these assay results (+)-catechin
and ferulic acid were shown to have useful antioxidant properties.
Various concentrations of (+)-catechin and ferulic acid were added to
beer using a full-factorial experimental design. The beers were then
forced-aged by heating to 60C for 24 hr. Markers for flavor stability
were monitored by measuring carbonyl formation and by measuring
UV-active compounds separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid
chromatography (RP-HPLC). Significant relationships between the chemical
markers and (+)-catechin and ferulic acid concentrations were determined
by backward stepwise multiple linear regression. (+)-Catechin suppressed
the rate of formation of some carbonyl compounds, whereas ferulic acid
increased the rate of formation of others. Both (+)-catechin and ferulic
acid influenced the rate of formation and loss of some UV-active
compounds separated by RP-HPLC. (+)-Catechin and ferulic acid appeared
to be acting independently. Keywords: Antioxidants, Carbonyl compounds,
(+)-Catechin, Ferulic acid, Flavor stability.

Please note the quote ... "(+)-Catechin suppressed the rate of formation
of some carbonyl compounds, whereas ferulic acid increased the rate of
formation of others.".  As I mentioned in my previous post (hopefully
accepted) there is an older reference [Dadic et al, "Phenolic and Beer
Staling", MBAA Tech Qrt 11:140, 1974] to ferulic increasing carbonyl
formation including diacetyl.  Typically carbonyls have very low flavor
thresholds and negative flavors as well.  Also it's hard to estimate how
relevent the result above is since the temperature (60C/140F) is
atypical.  Still it is an antioxidant.


>From Pratt & Hudson, "Natural Antioxidant not Exploited Commercially",
Elsevier, pp171, 1990, ferulic acid is only a mediocre antioxidant
compared to other phenolic acids like caffeic and chlorogenic, also to
Aglycones like quercetin, and to catechin.  Ferulic is on par with
coumaric which is the other major monophenol in beer - but well below
some of the minor cinnamic acids and flavanoids.

And from the Guinness JIB article some ale yeast may produce perceptible
amounts as well.  Also the 4VG levels produced by such an ale yeast can
be  controlled by controlling the ferulic level via the mash.  Actually
with a 45C and 52C rest added, the *BOIL* produced near perceptable
levels from the excessive (4.5X) amount of ferulic extracted from the
malt.  Acidity levels in beer will also increase the spontaneous
(thermal) decarboxylation of ferulic to 4VG.

I think this ignores the fact that wheat contains an extremely high
percentage of its phenolic acids as ferulic acid - about 90% is ferulic!
This compares with 18-40% figures for barley.  The ferulic is primarily
bound to arabinoxylans in the aleurone cell walls of wheat and barley. 
Ferulic is also subject to extraction from the aleurone just as other
phenol-glucosides are - particularly in the exposed aleurone of the
huskless wheat.  The enzymic release is just particularly effective and
controllable.  Also total phenolic acids (not total phenols) in wheat
(from 2 sample assays I have) is as high as the highest barley figures
and several times higher than some brewing barleys.


>From what I read -


1/ 4VG flavors *should* to be controllable by controlling ferulic levels
when using wheat-beer yeasts and ale yeasts which decarboxylate! 
Demonstrated in one case.


2/ It would be hard to control these levels when using wheat or wheat
malt since it appears from a couple examples to have from 2.5X to 9.5X
the amount of ferulic acid content as barley, and the aleurone layer
where it is bound is more accessible.


3/ High ferulic acid level do not in themselves impart a flavor, and do
act as anti-oxidants, but may have deleterious flavor effects re
carbonyls. "It has been found that ferulic acid markedly increases the
formation of carbonyls under both high and low air conditions.  Moreover
ferulic acid and quercetin were found to be active promoters of diacetyl
formation in aging beer." [Shaidi&Naczk, "Food Phenolics", Tecnomic
Press 1995].


Tell me again why I should load my beers with ferulic acid ???

1.  Elevations within Boulder range over something > 800 ft., so you can't
    state it to +/- 10 ft.
2.  For accuracy, you would have to take barometric pressure into account.
    This can cause a variation equivalent to several hundred feet of alti-
    tude.  In other words, if you calibrate an altimeter today, then wait
    until the weather changes, it may be off by several hundred feet.
3.  Ambient temperature also affects boiling point...and as a second-order
    effect, so does humidity!


The net here is that you can't get anywhere near the accuracy you want
unless you're trying to make a long-term study of it.  And, while I respect
your curiosity, this is rather disconnected from brewing.


As a rule of thumb, boiling point drops about 2 deg F for every thousand
feet.  You might as well figure 202 F for Boulder and be done with it.
This is rough enough that you can say 1 deg C per thousand feet, call it 95
C for Boulder.

I thank Rob for reporting on this, but I have to say that I'm disappointed

zealous ATF enforcement that he wouldn't want to encourage more bizarre
laws.  The exemption for cider has been a tiny window of sanity in an

It is true that this can be a problem for unpasteurized fresh juice.
However, the criticism is off-base for normal fermented cider:
  1 Fermentation will kill off E coli.  The problem is fresh juice, not
    fermented cider.
  2 You have to be below drooling-stupid to take windfalls from a dual-use
    orchard.
  3 Wisdom and size of production are unrelated.  Recall that last year,
    Odwalla had a serious E coli problem.  They are not small roadside
    farmers!  They're well-respected, relatively careful health-food
    producers.  It just happens that they got screwed by their supply
    process...in their case, it was exactly because they are large (too
    large to oversee all aspects) that they ran into trouble.  If you think
    the problem comes from small farmers, or that large producers are
    immune to problems, you probably also believe that McDonalds makes the
    best hamburgers in the world, Microsoft makes the best software, E&J
    Gallo make the best wine, and Budweiser is the best beer.  Think about
    it.
  4 BATF regulation can't touch the sources.  A bruised/cut rotting apple
    on an orchard sward is outside their purview.

If you want a "jip" then go to Whitelabs! I have personally experimented
with their yeast and in every single case, the Whitelabs "starter" is in
need of a starter! I have talked with other brewers in my area which concur
that you *MUST* culture a starter with Whitelabs so-called "pitchable
yeast." In dialogue with other brewers, and from personal experience, if you
pitch the Whitelabs "pitchable" slurry you WILL have a 12 hour to 18 hour
lag phase in fermentation! You might as well pitch Wyeast straight from the
packet! I think Whitelabs has a long way to go in producing a pitchable
slurry. Until then, do your self a favor and culture up the Whitelabs yeast.

most want a siebel or better training level.  most places will not allow 
you the chance of "playing" with a recipe. in better designed breweries
an idiot could run it, you need only to be able to tell time, write/read, and

i went from owner/brewer to more of money chaser, i hired a brewer, this guy
was probably the best i could have found anywhere.  i trusted this guy with 
my life.  i did give the chance to "play" with recipes, and the chance to
pick a style and brew it.  it worked out good for us - we were very small.
i wish i could have paided him double the amount i could afford. this is 
not the normal case in most larger breweries.


in the long run the name of the game is the same - business is business,

Recent talk about the phils phalse bottom prompted me to share a use for 
it that I came up with in an emergency.


I chill using an immersion chiller and was siphoning using a phils psiphon 
starter.  I had problems with the break material and hops clogging the 
siphon one day.  Just couldn't get the siphon going, so I poured the whole 
thing through my lauter tun with the phils phalse bottom.   Worked pretty 
well for 3 brews and I considered buying an extra bucket and phalse bottom 
just for this, but thought the sanitation might not be what it should be, 
plus its awkward.  When sanitizing after using for lautering I had to use 
a pin to get the grain out of the teeny tiny holes.   It was a PITA, but 
it worked.   Also the plastic false bottom floats so I used my racking 
cane to hold it down while I poured the wort in.  Hops clogging is another 
PITA if you can't hold it down just right.  I woke my wife at 3am one solo 
brew session to hold the false bottom down while I poured the wort (told 
you she's a saint!).  One nice thing about using this setup is you really 
get a lot of wort out of the hops. Another nice thing is it drains fast!  
I put one of those plastic spray thingies on the end of the tube and got 
pretty decent aeration too.  I'm still not sure why I wouldn't recommend 
it every time, it just seems like too many chances for infection.


BTW, I tried using an easy masher for straining, but it clogged too 
easily.  I now use a copper tube ring with holes drilled in it.  Works 
pretty good.

all downhill! I don't think any of my previous batches have lasted more =
than 40-50 days after bottling. They have all been consumed before fatal =
gushers could express themselves!!=20


And my current inventory is weighing heavily upon my mind since I've =
been trying (with moderate success) to keep away from it and allow a =
more lengthy conditioning period.  However, since a fellow brewer stated =
that I might get gushers later as the honey ferments longer, I now find =
myself in the sad state of afairs whereby I must consume my entire =
inventory before impending disaster strikes! Whoa is me...


On the bight side, I'm saving all responses and posting them near my =

HBD,


 Would like to try saving some beer in 2L soda bottles but after rinsing
they still seem to have a strong "soda pop" odor. Any suggestions on how to
remove this odor?


TIA,
Dana Edgell
