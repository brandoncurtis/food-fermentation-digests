Brian S. (older half of the Yeasty Boys), Bad Thermometer and Bowl Weevils. 
What more could you ask for on Brew Day. Brian saved the day. I'd been 
planning this brew day for months. Ever since I began to think about 
building that fermentation chiller so I could make lagers in the summertime. 
Well, I built it, it works (pilsner is finally out of there) and Saturday 
was the day for Deer Valley Doppelbock.


I opened the trunk of the car and pulled out a brand new 50lb sack of DWC 
Belgian Munich. Yummy stuff. Then I took a little closer look - 
UUGGGGHHHH!!!!! Teeny little bugs crawling out of the top of the bag between 
the threads. Oh yuck! The dopplebock called for 7 lbs of munich malt and now 
all I've got is bugs! Called Brian and told him "looks like we're not 
brewing today". Brian had offered to help me with the decoction (after some 
polite begging on my part). He said, "No problem, I'll pick some up at the 
Wine Smith and be right over". Fantastic, we're back in business, just a 
little behind schedule.


I've been suspicious of my thermometer's accuracy lately especially after 
the last brew, a porter that was supposed to be fairly robust that actually 
came out light bodied. Hmmm says I, wonder if I'm really mashing at the 
temps I think I am. So, boiled some water stuck in the thermometer. 
According to calculations based on altitude (elevation?) my water should 
boil at 210F. Thermometer was reading between 214 and 215F! Bummer. So to 
test the other end of the scale, I plunk the thermometer in a cold coffee 
cup full of water and stuff it in the freezer. An hour or so later, its 
reading between 39 and 40F. This is not good. I left it in the freezer 
another hour. Big Mistake (Busted Mug). My favorite coffee mug (custom made 
with my son's family picture on it) cracked in two pieces. Ice does nasty 
things sometimes. Thermometer still reads 39F.


So now I know that I have to do arithmetic every time I take a reading with 
that thermometer (yes I'm going to buy a new one as this one has no 
calibration screw/nut). At least now I can understand a few things that have 
been going on with the brews lately. I'm subtracting 5 degrees every time I 
read the thermometer from now on.


So maybe you're wondering what the "D.D." was for in the title. Double 
Decoction! I only planned on doing a single, but Brian says, if you want 
malty flavors, you gotta boil the grains. So we did it. Protein rest at 
138F, first decoction up to 158F and decoction 2 up to 170F. Sounds easy, 
its a lot of work. We did get some burgers between 1 and 2 while the mash 
took care of itself.


The target OG was 1.086 and we hit 1.091. And what a fantastic aroma! This 
is going to be one hell of a Dopplebock. Its in the fermentation chiller now 
and it should be ready for the holiday party. Mmmmmmmm, can't wait.


Thanks Brian.

Subject: First Mash, First Judging


Thanks to all for the responses to my Mild recipe and mashing questions.


It seems I'll be able to consolidate the info and try again in November, as
this first run didn't work out quite the way I had wished.  Actually, it
bombed.  My Phalse Bottom came loose at dough-in, and grain got in the
spigot, in the tubing, under the PB.  Of course, I hadn't noticed this yet.


After 90 minutes, I was going to set up the recirculation, and realized the
problem.  pulled the mash out, siphoned some hot water through the spigot,
put the mash back in, and realized I had forgotten to clear out the
underside of the PB.  Cursing ensued.  Pulled the mash again, cleared junk
out of the way (or so I thought), and returned mash to the cooler.  Still
clogged.  At this point, I've spent almost an hour screwing around with
this thing.  Argh!  Decided to write it off, learn from the experience, and
make some small equipment improvements (as suggested by AlK the next day --
thanks again!), i.e., a copper tube rather than a plastic from the barb
fitting to the spigot.  I might also pick up a ball valve spigot rather
than the  barrel tap that's currently on there -- this might not be as
important.




Sunday was much better -- I judged for the first time in a small
competition.   It was very interesting, and very worthwhile.  Harder than I
expected.


And finally, as I was waiting about for the other judges to finish their
flights, Al distributed copies of his new book.  I paged about, then got
excited, and wound up buying it.  It's a primarily extract book, as far as
technique goes, but the real key is the wealth of reference info in there.
The Hops appendix has ~100 hop descriptions, and the yeast appendix goes
through (what appears to be) every damn yeast on the market, wet and dry.
Added to this is a series of recommendations based on style and attenuation
(want an Ordinary Bitter?  Here's the best yeasts.  Want a well-attenuated
beer?  Here's the yeasts.)  Plus, detailed tasting techniques and some
recipes.  And more.  I'm impressed.  Highly recommended.

Subject: pressure cooking wort


I had two replies to my question about pressure cooking large amounts of
wort (15qts) and impacting (lowering) the fermentable sugars and raising
the final gravity.


One thought I had removed fermentable sugars and one thought not.


The beer tastes pretty good (is not too sweet) and appears to be a low
alcohol version consistent with the model of removing fermentable
sugars.  With more alcohol, the final gravity would have been lower
given a fixed amount of unfermentable sugars.  Incidentally, the yeast
bottle conditioned in 5 days so it was able to eat fermentable sugars
when provided.


My conclusion,  don't P-cook large amounts of rich wort.  Just because
you have a large canning type P-cooker that can hold a ton of wort, 
don't.  Unless of course, you want a flavorful low alcohol sessions
beer.   


FWIW, YMMV, etc.      Cheers,,  jim booth, lansing, mi

Subject: Re:  Loose, dark sediment / How to win a homebrew contest


     Hi all,
     
     Nathan observes a dark, loose sediment in his bottle-conditioned 
     homebrew.  It formed at 58F (14C) after 3 weeks in the bottle.
     
     At first, I thought that this sediment was chill haze that had settled 
     to the bottom of the bottle, but I wouldn't expect that to occur at 
     58F.
     
     Next I thought that it may be a wild yeast.  They often do not 
     flocculate well and, if they settle at all, may form only a loose 
     sediment.  Nathan goes on to say that the beer is not infected, but 
     then describes a pleasant "all spice" flavor in the brew.
     
     That could very well be added to the beer by a wild yeast!  The spicy 
     flavor of HefeWeizen is attributed to phenolic compounds made by the 
     "domesticated" wild yeasts favored for their flavor contributions.  
     Not all wild yeast will make beer taste awful; some contribute quite a 
     pleasant spiciness!
     
     It would be one explanation for your loose sediment.  Perhaps there is 
     a better answer out there...
     ------------------------------
     Don V. talks about his theory for winning homebrew contests.  He 
     claims that bigger beers do better, and thus you should always brew 
     out-of-style on the high side.  He even says, "Judges are after all 
     only human and respond to alcohol and hops."  He also says that big 
     beers usually win Best Of Show (BOS).
     
     My experience does not validate those statements.
     
     Firstly, I've judged plenty of contests where in-style, normal gravity 
     beers have won BOS.  I won a BOS a few months back with a very 
     "within-style" Bavarian HefeWeizen; hardly a big beer!
     
     As a judge, I have tasted beers that seem to be too big for style, 
     especially in the American Pale Ale (APA) category.  When this 
     happens, I will comment on the sheet that the beer seems too big for 
     style, but if it is cleanly made, it may still score decently.  If 
     that score places it amongst the top three beers, it will win a prize.
     
     You must pay attention to the judges comments, not just your placing!  
     Winning a contest does not mean you made a great beer.  Not winning at 
     a contest doesn't mean that you're beer isn't great.  The competition 
     may have simply been better, or the judges may have had an "off" day.
     
     Pay attention to the comments.  If the judge was good, they will 
     hopefully be informative enough to really tell you how your beer was.
     
     There is some truth in Don's statement about hops impressing judges 
     (if the style should be hoppy).  There is a phenomenon called "palate 
     fatigue."  It refers to a deadening of the palate after repeated 
     stimulation by similar sensations.  Hops very quickly cause palate 
     fatigue.
     
     If a judge isn't careful to keep their palate fresh (by drinking lots 
     of water and taking time between beers), then a beer that is hopped to 
     style may BE PERCEIVED as under-hopped if it is the 8th beer 
     evaluated.
     
     In this situation, an over-hopped beer may score better.  Of course, 
     if the judges are doing a really good job, it may be described as 
     being too hoppy for style...it's a crap-shoot!
     
     Have fun!

Steve Scott asked about forced carbonation:


40 lbs. of pressure for three days at 70 degrees F.  


I advise against shaking the CO2 into solution.  You're better off letting
the CO2 gradually absorb into the beer.  Makes for smaller bubbles.

By utilizing a 122'F rest, you produce more food for growing yeasts at the
expense of head retaining colloids (albuminous proteinaceous compounds),
especially for 30 minutes. Another rest at 149'F will saccharify your wort,
making more fermentables, while a 158'F rest will dextrinize your wort,
leaving less fermentables, but more residual maltodextrins for "mouthfeel".
Combining these two would result in a fairly balanced beer IMHO, but a
single step-up mash to 154'F from 122'F would accomplish the same thing
from my personal experience. I once made the same beer 12 weeks in a row,
simply changing the second infusion temperature by one degree. I discovered
it took *two* degrees to make a tastable difference in that particular
recipe (an americanized EPA). The real question remains: what do you want?
A balanced beer, or one that is highly dermentable, or one that is really
full bodied? For the first try 153~154'F second mash rest, for the second
149~150'F, and for the last 156~158'F. These values assume that you are
making a typical pale ale with a BU:GU ratio of 0.7~0.8:1, and an OG of
1.045~1.055. Good luck, God Bless!

Subject: Insulating Sankey Kegs/Dial Thermometers


Collective: (Resistance is Futile)


Does anyone have any great ideas for insulating Sankey kegs?  
I mashed for the first time in my converted, uninsulated Sankey,
and the temperature drop was significant.  I really don't want 
to have to apply heat every fifteen minutes to maintain 
temperature.  I have lots of R19 fiberglass house insulation 
that I could wrap around the keg and duct tape down, but I am 
unsure of how well this will tolerate temperature.  I also 
wonder how it would respond to getting wet from cleaning after
the mash?  Any comments?


I guess my ideal insulation would be:


1) Resistant to high temps


2) Water resistant/proof


3) Possibly in the form of a removable "jacket"


- -------------------------------------------------------------


As my keg conversion process continues, I am looking for two 
accurate dial thermometers that can be screwed in to a pipe
thread fitting.  The ones that I have seen at one of the local 
homebrew stores do not appear to be of very high quality.

DON'T DO IT!  I know from experience that the rock is saturated with
water and *will* (not 'probably' or 'might', but *will*) explode on you
when heated.


When I was a Boy Scout, some chucklehead, even though we were repeatedly
told not to, put a river rock or two in the fire ring.  Sure enough, a
very sharp flake about 3" in diameter came flying off one of the rocks
as we were getting ready to throw our banana boats in.  The flake went
clean through both sides of a tent (and not no weight-conscious backpacking
tent, neither, but one of them heavy canvas one-of-the-dads-drove-it-in
tents).

HBD-
In response to Mikes questions about Bells Amber Ale, their proprietary yeast,
which is specially farmed by a company under contract to supply only K'zoo
Brewing Co. with it, is readily available from the bottle.  I have used it in
many brews with very good results.
As far as what kind of malt and hops they use, I'm sure nobody at the brewery
knows.  At least that was the response I got to my innocous questions on a
brewery tour back in June (see the June 31 HBD for my brewery tour report).
 
In response to the pumpkin ale thread- where'd the flavor go?- I tried
sweetening the beer in the glass with sugar, honey and molasses (one at a
time) and didn't get the pumkin aroma back.  People who tried my current brew,
made with 2#'s canned pumpkin stuff claim that my pumpkin brew from last year
(Which I mashed inside a cleaned pumpkin) had more pumkin flavor.  My memory
isn't that good, I guess.  I for one would be interested in seeing Mr.
Bentsons' baked neck pumpkin recipe.  I'm assuming he steeps baked pumpkin
flesh in an extract based recipe in the secondary?  Any starch problems?

Your primary ferment is taking only twice as long as mine do with 7# of
extract and Edme dry yeast.  You probably have a better (cooler) temp than
mine.  I do leave it a few days to finish up and fall clear.  I haven't
noticed any off flavors, but I brew dark and flavorful beers, which may
hide any slight twinges.

Sounds like the typical description of a phenolic off taste.  Papazian
(HB Companion) and the net say that phenols can be produced by
infections, too-hot steeping/mashing of grains, or chlorine (from
sanitizer or chlorinated water).


With a fast-n-furious ferment, I doubt you're getting infections, and
you don't say you're using grains at all.  That leaves chlorine.


If you sanitize with chlorine bleach, the proportions I've seen are:
 - 2 TEAspoons per 5 gallons, soak 30 minutes, air dry
 - 2 TABLEspoons per 5 gallons, soak 30 seconds, rinse with hot water


If you're sanitizing properly, it may be chlorinated water.  Try a
batch with bottled (NOT distilled) water and see if that helps.  If
so, call your water department and find out if they treat the water
with chloramines or just plain chlorine.  If chlorine, boil your water
BEFORE adding any grains or extract.  If chloramines, you'll need a
charcoal filter to remove them.

Pasteurizing will cause flavor changes (you're cooking it, after all).


A biology teacher noted on rec.crafts.brewing that pasteurization is
NOT just heating: the second part is RAPID CHILLING, so the remaining
bacteria don't get a chance to reproduce.  (Found via Deja News).


 ...  What I was thinking of
> first was racking it into my pot, bring it up to 150F or 160F,

If you pasteurize in an open pot you'll lose volatile flavor compounds,
and alcohol (not nearly all, at this temp/time).


If you're bottling with natural carbonation, you'll have to
re-pitch some yeast -- you just killed the existing colony.

I assume this is so it's a closed container (save those volatiles!).  Note
that you WILL get pressure building up, since any airspace will expand,
and part of the beer will vaporize.  Use a pressure-sensitive relief
valve, or use a pressure gauge and manually open a relief valve if the
pressure gets above normal kegging levels.  I have no idea if this is a
realistic concern -- best to find out by monitoring it, not by losing keg
and beer and getting a 150-degree beer shower (it's better about 80-85).


Consider an ice-bath or something to chill it rapidly after heating (per
biology comment above).  OTOH, I don't know how big a temperature
differential a keg can stand.


Raise the keg UP OFF THE FLOOR of the pot, so there's water under it.
Otherwise you'll be applying heat directly to the keg, and the lowest
layer of beer will get hotter than your target temperature.


Same caution about natural carbonation, but no problem if you're
force-carbonating.


Hey, maybe you'll invent a new style of beer!  Oops, can't have that...


Best,

Despite New Glarus being only a few hours from Chicago, only
recently (like yesterday) have I seen it sold locally.   I had the
opportunity (thanks to Bob Paolino) to try the very first and
second batches of this beer.  Its recipe, I'm told, has been adjusted
over the course of the last four years.


The reason I begin with all that history is to point out that
the New Glarus Belgian Red I tasted yesterday may not have been
from the same recipe as that at the GABF (which I could not attend
this year).


The Belgian Red I tasted yesterday was an outstanding beverage,
but I, personally, would not call it a great fruit beer.  Its aroma
and flavour were both 100% cherry, meaning that it tasted like
a cherry wine rather than a cherry *beer*.  In my opinion, fruit
and spice beers must have some beer aroma and/or flavour.   As
much as I like the Belgian Red, I don't think it's a good example
of a fruit beer (but that's just my opinion, of course).

I agree with Jeff that a cold start is the preferred way of making a lager
as opposed to the shortcut (start warm, then cool), but I'm still not
convinced that ester production occurs *only* or even *primarily* during 
reproduction.  It's not that I have references to the contrary, it's
just that I *don't* have any supporting references other than HBD posts
(from Tracy, primarily).  I've tried to get copies of some of the articles
mentioned previously, but have been unsuccessful to date.


Can we discuss this topic again in more detail?


When and how do the esters really get produced?

My head is about to explode from information overload, so I can't remember

and mentioned risk of E. coli from "windfall" apples.  Maybe it was on
TV?  Maybe some other digest?


Anyway, I'd like to ask the biologists out there if indeed we need to
be concerned about E. coli if we *ferment* the juice in to hard cider
(just "cider" for our International readers).  My suspicion is that
we need not worry about it at all.  Why?  Because according to Guinard's
excellent book "Lambic," E. coli is part of the early stages of Lambic
fermentation.  Presumably either the acidity or alcohol of the finished
product kills the E. coli, right?


So, is it possible to look up susceptibility of E. coli to alcohol and pH?


Where?

I recently obtained the following data from my maltster on the malt I use.
One qualified source informs me that this malt is highly suitable for
straight infusions and that a protein rest will degrade head retention and
overall quality.
Another reliable informant tells that any malt benefits from a protein rest.


When I have done straight infusions and done them well, the resultant beer
still throws a chill haze at v-low temperatures.
The malt is commercial malt, Castlemaine-Perkins (XXXX) use it as a straight
infusion malt, although why should they care about chill haze when they run
it at a .25 micron filter?

Subject: Stuck or Done Fermentation?


Hello Hbd'ers (and more specifically Jeff Renner if you read this cuz' I
don't know your private e-mail address)


Recently brewed a Pre-Prohibition Lager and am having an apparent stuck
fermentation (my first and hopefully last!) and was wondering if anyone
had experienced this same problem and could give me some ideas. The
batch specifics:
10 lbs. Klages 2 row & 2 lbs. flaked maize, mashed at 115F/35 min, then
145F/15 min, then 158/60 min, then mashout at 168F. Sparged, cooled and
racked as I normally do. Pitched a good healthy, twice propagated, one
liter starter of Yeastlab L34 St. Louis lager yeast. The OG was 1.063.
Fermented in the primary for 9 days at 46-48F till SG was 1.040, racked
to secondary and fermented for 16 days at 38F, checked SG at 1.027, then
racked to a five gallon Corny keg for lagering. Here's where the mystery
comes in. Naturally added polyclar as I always do at bottling or kegging
time. This time I added about a half gallon of boiled, distilled water
to bring the volume up to 5 gallon. I figured since the SG was still
fairly high for what I wanted as a final, I placed a blowoff/airlock
tube on the keg in hopes of having the remaining yeast ferment out and
settle and lower the SG a little. After 14 days of lagering at 35F, I
did a gravity check and it was 1.030???
I know this was long winded, but my question to the collective is,
should I re-innoculate the batch with fresh yeast and try to ferment it
out for a third time? The beer tastes extra sweet for what I expected
and is certainly alot more full bodied too. I assume that the polyclar
has already settled out what yeast remained and it will no longer do
it's job. I have a few ounces of slurry that I pulled from the primary
that I could revive and re-pitch. I spent alot of time and effort on
this batch and hate to not get the best possible brew I can (of course!)


Any help or comments will be appreciated.


Thanks!

From: Jeremy Bergsman <jeremybb`at`stanford.edu>
Subject: RIMS questions


Thanks mainly to Dion Hollenbeck I've decided to "upgrade" my 
3 tier system to RIMS.  I have some questions.  Email to me
is fine, I'll summarize, or mail to the digest.


1) Is there such a thing as a too strong pump (magnetically
coupled, centrifugal)?  There has been a little discussion on
this, but people seem happy to throttle them back with a downstream
ball valve.  My existing pump will do (actual, not rated) at least 8
gallons/min with similar head and friction when wide open (not
sucking through a grain bed).


2) I know many people use 220V heaters at 110V.  Since I already
have 220V going to my brewery for my pump, I was thinking that
I could wire a 3-way switch to the unswitched side of the heater
and select between neutral and "negative" 110V to allow 220V
for faster boosts.  Obviously this would be useful for heating
up water prior to dough-in, but has anyone ever done this with
wort?  Is it sure to scorch or cause denaturation (I'm thinking
in particular of the 40-->60C boost)?  I calculate that 4500W
(the 220V power output of the heater I'm looking at) with a
flow rate of 3 gal/min will add 17 degrees C (assuming no
losses along the way).  Can someone check my math and then advise
whether this is too small of a safety factor?  Is 3 gal/min
appropriate?  Or should I shut up and do the experiment?


3) As a 1 pump solution that minimizes reconstruction of what I
have, and tries to keep overall height down, I propose the 
following layout: Bottom level=mash/lauter tun, just high enough
to feed downhill to the pump.  Next level=gravity feed HLT and 
kettle.  Kettle can gravity feed to fermenters (I use an immersion
chiller) or to mash tun to add boiling water for big boosts (see
question 2) or for turbid mashes.  Any obvious problems with
this?


4) Any tricks on orientation of the heater chamber?  One I thought
of was that the element might be better on top with a vertical
chamber orientation so that any particulates that settle out in the
chamber (decreased velocity in the larger diameter tube?)
won't settle on the element.  Likewise, any pump tricks?

Subject: Fast Fermentation Followup


Well, lost of people suggested that I may have a problem with fermentation
temperatures.  Living in Phoenix, Arizona, I don't find this too hard to
believe. My house stays at 75 degrees (any lower and I'd be broke), which
most say is too high for my ale to ferment properly, possibly contributing
to the "tangy, salivary gland swelling" flavor I described. People gave
some wonderful suggestions, and if I have enough successes, I will
eventually get a fridge or other "cooler" for my beer.


But right now, just starting out, I can't justify the expense. The fermenter
in a tub of water with a towel and fan for evaporation idea sounds good, but
I don't really want a fan running 24-hours a day.


Another idea some suggested was to put my carboy in a large plastic
garbage can and fill it with water. That way, I can control the
temperature of the surrounding water with ice if need be, maintaining a
constant 65 degrees.  This sounds really appealing, because it is 
economical, and a large volume of water shouldn't change temperature too 
quickly.


Does anyone have any experience with this method or any thoughts on its
viability? Thanks for keeping me brewing, and hopefully I'll meet with
success after success soon!

HBDers and fellow revelers
        A few months ago I posted some questions I had about brewing beer
for a wedding.  Well, the wedding was Sunday and I thought a report was in
order.  
        First, the beers.  I brewed 4, oatmeal stout, pilsener, strawberry
wheat and a VERY potent version of a California Common Beer (Steam).  The
all went very well, but the Steam beer.......which I called Steam
Roller.....was the biggest hit.
        I did not keg the beers, but bottled them and that worked out ok.
I had to teach the bartenders how to pour a homebrew without getting
sediment.  If you're planning on doing this, I would suggest you be
careful.  Talking before the reception with the head bartender, he made it
sound like he knew all about homebrew.  Then I saw him pouring them in a
fashion I wouldn't use even on a megabrew.  
        My other suggestion, make sure the beer glasses are big enough for
a whole beer if you're using bottles.  These must have been been 9 or 10
oz glasses and the bartenders ended up pouring the tail end of one bottle
and the beginning of another.....making for quite a lot of sediment in a
glass. 
        My last comment comes about using bulk extract.  I had good
results from buying a 15kg vat of english light malt extract.  I think it
was Munton and Fison's.  I've found that if you're unable to weigh your
malt to get the right amount for a recipe, using 2/3rds of a cup of
extract to equal 1 pound works well......at least for light malt extract.  
        Thanks to all who answered my questions about these brews.  I hope
this post will help someone else who's thinking of brewing for a similar
event.

"Alan found he had a bigger difference between an easymasher and
slotted copper manifold than I did in my experiment.


I'd like to suggest that the difference may be in the rate of
taking the runnings. "


Alan responds with :


No, I always run off for about 70 minutes.  As I recall, all factors
were equal at that
time.  The only other thing I can think of off-hand is that I made the
switch from 
EC-Masher to my manifold at roughly the same time as I started getting
used to
mashing in general.  Perhaps I switched at exactly the same time that I
would have
made the leap in extraction, anyway.


As I mentioned, I've been meaning to run some experiments of my own to
test
the systems.  Maybe some day soon I'll get the time.


cheers,

Subject: Iodine


Hello All,
        Is it possible for iodophore to go bad?  Can high temperature be 
harmful to the stuff?  I have been combating a sanitization problem.  My 
last 3 batches have gone bad when I bottle them.  After the first batch, 
I thought I had only been a little lax at bottling time.  So on the 
second batch I used iodophore to sanitize everything.  I make some 
solution (12.5 pp) min the bottling bucket and filled enough bottles with 
the solution and let them sit for 10 minutes.  Afterwords, I let them dry 
on a bottle tree.  Weeks later I had the same ring around the collar and 
over-ripe banana smell (the porter tasted like crap as well).  So when I 
bottled the pale ale, I used bleach to sanitize the bottles and iodophore 
to clean the bottling bucket.  I am 99.9999999999% sure the bottles were 
good.  So that leaves the bottling bucket (done with iopdophore).  Now 
the pale ale has the ring of scum in the bottle.  Stop me before I ruin 
another batch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
