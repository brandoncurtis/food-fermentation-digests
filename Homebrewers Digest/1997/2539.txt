Hello,


  Is TSP (Tri-Sodium Phosphate) ok to use for cleaning stainless, i.e.
corny kegs? I've used it (1-2 tbs per gallon of H2O) to clean out my
counter flow wort chiller with good results.  If not, what is the best
cleaner to use?

Subject: "Nickel Plated" Brass


As part of my continuing Keg Coversion project, I was at the hardware
store 
looking for ball valves.  I happened to see some that appeared nickel
plated.
On the tag it said that they were usable for water.  Well, I thought
that 
this was a great way to avoid the whole lead in brass issue, so I bought
them.
When I got them home and read the tag more carefully, I see that it also
says
on the tag, "This product contains a material known to the State of
California
to cause reproductive toxicity."  This sort of scares me!  Is this there
because
the brass contains lead, or is there something in the nickel plating
that is 
also toxic?  Should I go back to the store and just buy the regular
brass valves?


TIA,

Subject: Really nasty refrigerator stains


I have an inherited fridge with some TRULY nasty stains.  I have no
idea what they are from,  but they're several years old,  yellow,
organic,  rock hard  (almost like a part of the interior plastic) and
_probably_ of terrestrial origin.  Any ideas how to get rid of these?


I have tried straight clorox and elbow grease with only limited
success.


I considered trying Easy-Off oven cleaner,  which appears to be
basically just spray-on lye,  but don't know whether this will melt
the plastic as well as the stain.  Any comments?


Any other comments on effective cleaners for plastics would be
appreciated.  I intend to use this fridge for lagering and
fermentation and would like it as clean as possible.

Subject: RE: Brewing in kegs


Shreefal Mehta asked about brewing in kegs.


I have found that brewing in 5 gallon kegs requires even more attention to
wort aeration than usual.  I believe this to be due to the geometry of
the keg which presents a much smaller surface area of the wort to the
atmosphere than a carboy or bucket.


For air locks I have used a hose slipped over the threads of the removed gas
in fitting with the other end in a jar of water and also, for keg lids with
a removable pressure relief valve, a normal airlock in a #2 stopper in the
hole for the valve.


If the plan is to transfer the beer out of the liquid out side, the dip tube
would have to be cut off to clear the sediment left after fermentation.  I
just siphon off as predicting the depth of sediment is difficult and I hate
to cut up an expensive to replace dip tube.

What you should use is "Porcelain touch-up," available at the hardware
store.  It comes in a small bottle (1 oz) for about $3.  This stuff is
labeled lead free, and withstands temperatures to 400F.  


On a related matter, I saw 33 Qt pots (8 gallon+), blue enamel on steel, at
"The 1/2 Price Store" (a chain in the midwest) for $14.99 this weekend.

Subject: Keg Burners


Hi everyone


I wanted to get your opion on which type of cooker or burner works best
with a Sanke keg.  I currently have a king kooker jet burner which works
well, but I am planning on taking my brewing inside.  No need to warn
me about CO, I am making plans to vent the CO outside.


I dont want to bring in the king kooker inside and am trying to find
a burner which will work adaquately.  I brew all grain 5.5 gallon
batches, so I typically boil about 7 gallons.


I have looked at the camp chefs and the burners sold at Precision
Brewing, but they seem to be too small to safely seat the keg.  Does
anyone have any suggestions?


Thanks
Chris Dodge

Subject: Beer History


Hello All,


        I'm compiling a list of words that relate to brewing throughout 
history and was wondering if any of you could give me a hand.  Any thing you 
could think of would be most appreciated.  How did wort get the name wort?  
How did some beers get their names?


An example is below.  (Take this with a grain of salt.  I got it from a 
source that I'm not to sure of.)


Connor - A Connor was an inspector of sorts in medieval England.  His job was 
to walk around to all the local pubs, breweries, etc. and inspect the 
"wares".  How he did this was to wear a pair of leather pants and carry a 
stool with him.  When he reached "Ye Olde Pub" he would put the stool down 
and request two mugs of Ale.  The first mug he would pour on the seat and sit 
down in.  The second mug he would slowly drink while talking to the locals.  
At the end of his Ale, when he stood up, he would check to see if he stuck to 
the stool.  If he did, then the brewer at this establishment was not making a 
satisfactory Ale and was reprimanded.  If he didn't stick, everything was 
good and he moved on.


That an example of stuff I'm looking for.  If any of you got anything I would 
be forever grateful.


TIA

Subject: Chlorine and RO


Keith Christian asked about chlorine and RO units. I believe it is true
that chlorine will poison the RO membrane but nearly all units sold run the
water through particulate and activated carbon filters before it gets to
the RO cylinder. One of the major function of the activated carbon is, in
my understanding, protection of the membrane by removing chlorine. It is
also rumored that changing the activated carbon filter frequently can
extend the life of the RO cartridge beyond its normal expected life. You
would have to check on the health of the membrane by monitoring the
conductivity of the outlet water. Note that some units have a conductivity
monitor built in. This reminds me that it's about time to replave the
particulate and carbon filters and check conductivity!

From: "Thor" <thor`at`dnai.com>
Subject: 240v heater elements and brewery automation


Since there seems to be a mini thread about setting up an electric
element for one homebrewery, I thought I throw in my two cents. I'm
currently in the midst of adding a heating element to my Hot liquor
tank. The heater I have is a  240 volts 4800 watt water heater element
and bolts a square stainless tank. I hope to use this element to heat
up and maintain my initial mash strike water and sparge water for
brewing. This is how I'm setting it up. If your not into the details,
tap the old Page down button.


Originally I thought it might be nice to control the heating element,
sort of like a dimmer controls the brightness of a lamp. After
examining Ken Schwartz 5 gallon electric brewery I had some ideas of
what I wanted to do. One prerequisites I had was that I wanted to
design the circuit so it could be controlled with a low voltage on my
control panel and be able to automate the heating with a computer and
D/A interface. In block diagram, I wanted something like this (excuse 
my  ascii drawing)


         !----------!                !--------!
Heating  ! Control  !      5 volt    ! control!
Element--! Circuit  !----------------!  Panel !
         !----------!                !--------!
              !                           !
             GFCI                    !----------!
              !                      ! computer !
             240V                                 ! interface!
                                     !----------!


After doing some research, I found a simple solution based partially
on an article written by Ron LaBorde in the HBD archive. His solution
used a normal lamp dimmer attached to a special solid state relay
(SSR). This relay cost about $20 bucks and can control a large load of
30 or so Amps with only a small control voltage (3-32 volts dc). The
circuit basically took the low load dimmer (600 watt rated) and
attached it to the high load SSR (25 Amp rated) to thereby increase
its rating.


My circuit differs in several ways from LaBorde.  Without getting into
too much detail (this is  not sci.electronics for heaven sakes) I 
plan on controlling the element by alternately switching it on and off
for various amounts of time. For example, if I wanted to reduce the
power to the element, I could turn it on for 3 seconds and off for 2
instead of continuously on. The switching can be done by a simple
circuit or by a computer and software. The control voltage is still
only 5 volts but can control 240V at 25A by the use of the SSR.


Using this method solves another problem as well, the problem of
heating more than one vessel at a time. I also plan on adding elements
to my boil kettle and my mash tun.  If you have a 30 amp 240 v circuit
in your house (like a typical dryer circuit) and 4800 watt elements
(20 amp `at` 240V) then you have a problem if you turn on more than one.
If you alternately turn the different elements on and off, then you
shouldn't have a problem as long as you don't turn on more than one at
a time. You wont get as much heat as turning the element on all the
time of course but I don't see this as a problem. The reason I would
foresee heating more than one container at a time is to keep one at a
steady temperature while I heat the other (like keeping the Sparge
water constant while your starting to heat up what you have so far in
the boil kettle).

Subject: re:munich Malt


Dan Thaler asks about using Munich malt as a base malt in HBD#2537.


Dan, 
Munich makes a great base malt for Bock, Dopple Bock, Altbier, Vienna,
Dunkle, Oktoberfest, just to name a few. It has a very slight carmelly
flavor (not as much as light crystal malts, but still evident) toasty,
malty flavor.


The only gotcha (other than cost) that you need to watch out for is if
you use any adjuncts (malts or grains without enzymes). You can count on
munich to convert its own starch but its not necessarily enzymatic
enough to always convert adjunct starches. So if you're using a high
percentage of munich (or vienna for that matter) as a base malt and you
are also including some non-enzymatic adjuncts (rice, corn, etc), make
sure to include some plain old 2-row or 6-row for more enzymes.


Munich is a lager (pale) malt which is higher kilned (around 220F vs
175F).


Dave Millers Handbook of Homebrewing has an excellent description of
most base and specialty malts. Highly recommended reading, as is the
Great Grain Issue from 1995 Zymurgy.

Subject: primary aeration


OK, in an effort to get a better finishing gravity by prolonging the
active fermentation, I have been considering reaerating the primary
after about 1 week.  Just did a Xmas ale, which had a LOT of fermentable
sugars, and it went pretty strong for 3 days.  In the past, the starting
gravities have been normal, but I tend to not get the final gravity as
low as it should be, and I think that perhaps the yeasties just go dormant
too fast because they run out of O2 too early.  I used to do the shake 
and roll method with the carboy to oxygenate.  So, now I tried the air
pump with the stone, and that seemed to do the trick, as it went for
a good 3 days, versus the normal 1.5 to 2 days.  My question is whether
it will harm the beer to reaerate with the stone for a few minutes now
that the really active fermentation is done, such that the yeast can
kick back into gear, and continue to ferment?  I've heard stories about
how reoxygenating might be bad, something about tasting like wet
cardboard?  However, whenever I siphon to secondary, it starts to 
ferment again, as there is some Oxygen that gets back into the beer
during the transfer.  This is what gave me the idea to reoxygenate
prior to the transfer to really let it go again?  FYI, this is for
an all-grain batch...  To re-aerate, or not to re-aerate?


Thanks,

Subject: Munich as a base malt




Well, by it's truest definition, "Munich" malt is nothing more than the
base malt
used by breweries in that city.  Of course, these days different malters
are
producing very different products called by that name.


Myself, I've used Canada Malting's "Munich" as a base malt in a recipe
that I brew a lot, and found it to make a very excellent beer.


Normally I brew this :


6 lb  Canada Malting 2 Row
1 lb CM Wheat
1 lb CM Munich


But a few brews ago I changed it to


6 lb CM Munich
1 lb CM Wheat
1 lb CM 2 Row


Everything went completely normally with the brew.  The resulting colour
was roughly that of a Pale Ale, and the brew was most excellent!  I'm
going
to make the same thing but lager it this time.


The only thing to watch out for is using adjuncts.  I don't think Munich
has
as much extra enzymes as say 2 Row.

The Department of Water & Power website has a water quality section

have a number of competent water chemists that can help you get this

I can't comment on RO, but my cheap undersink charcoal canister filter

Most Valley water is typically treated at Sylmar -- they don't use the
method that can be removed by boiling, you have to filter.

Rock Bottom has never claimed to make "English ales" or "German lagers" 
but "American ales and lagers" using the finest domestic and imported 
ingredients to create beers "we like and we hope you do too."  We have 
over 300 recipes and no two brewerys are brewing the same beers.  I 
consider style categories to be too confining and look to classic "style" 
beers only for inspiration in creating something of my own.  Thank God 
Ken Grossman didn't have his head buried in the "beer styles" handbook 
when he created Sierra Pale. (a bit too hoppy for a typical English pale 
isn't it?)  What about Paul Shipman's RedHook or Widmer's "Hefeweizen". 
Confining and categorizing appeals most to those who aren't interested in 
the "art" part of brewing so much as their rows and columns and boxes.  I 
don't brew beers that fit into boxes, I brew beers to fit into pints.  I 
cant' summarize any better than Sam Piper did just a few days ago in this 
forum.

I'm afraid it's hopeless. If she'll drink cheap vodka when Cuervo is
available things will never 'work right'. OTOH your beer is safe as long
as the worm doesn't clog the airlock.


>second, I also think the cooling air or something Sucked Some of the

It is unlikely that enough tequila got into your beer to impact flavor.
It is possible for cooling to pull sanitizer from some types of airlock
into the brew.  This practically can't happen with an 'S' type airlock
when properly filled - I highly recommend these.  BTW - Where was your
girlfriend at the time the airlock tequila went missing ?


>Will this hurt brewing process any?


An SO that doesn't appreciate fine beverages will always hurt the
brewing process.  The textbook solution to finding an organism living on
your airlock sanitizer is to switch to a stronger sanitizer, one capable
of handling the offending organism. Thus the 'my SO drinks all the
airlock sanitizer' problem would logically be handled with iodine or
chlorine - then the drinking of sanitizer problem cannot persist for
long.


- --


There is a bigger and more interesting and - need I say it - more
pointy-headed scientific question regarding airlocks here.


An airlock supposedly has several purposes.  It keeps spores and
airborne bacteria out.  It keeps CO2 in and air(oxygen) out, which helps
prevent oxidation of the reactive flavor components of beer.  Normal
airlocks do not perform either of these functions particularly well.


In an air inrush of the sort described above, airborne spores and
bacteria can and do get through the sanitizer solution and into the beer
headspace.  It's doubtful that the sanitizer in the airlock is of much
actual value in the case of air inrush.  Fortunately this inrush
condition doesn't happen very often. Sanitizer solution does prevent the
growth of bacteria and fungi in the airlock and this is probably its
greatest value.


During active fermentation and later through secondary fermentation the
evolving CO2 constantly forces gas out, but also air O2 mixes with the
airlock liquid and may get into the fermentor.  Later a beer may sit
with an airlock and no bubbling, but still gas concentration gradients
for a long period of time. I haven't sought out numbers, but I suspect
that quite a bit of O2 can transfer through a water based fermentation
lock liquid.  This recalls some of the gas gradient discussions on HBD
regarding PET bottles.  Also many HBers use other potential oxidizers
such as bleach solution, in airlocks, where the gasses emitted might act
to oxidize beer.


An ideal airlock would allow no potentially contaminated air into the
fermentor, nor would it allow any atmospheric O2 into the fermentor.  A
HEPA filter helps with the first problem, but is hopeless regarding the
second.  It would seen that only an impermeable cover or membrane would 
keep O2 out.  Just how permeable to oxygen are oils, other liquids ?

Subject: lack of hot break ??


Seeking feedback from more learned brewers:
Brew day was yesterday for a robust porter... all seemed as normal until the
boil. When I checked for the break after the first 30min of a 90 min boil, I
found very tiny break particles where I usually find good sized pieces. 
I did not use any Irish Moss to drop the break because I usually find it not
neccesary with dark brews. After I did a chill and racked the wort it was
not very clear (I usually rack very crystal clear wort to fermenter then add
a little bit of trub). 
My normal 5 G batch usually yields 1.5-2 quarts of trub. This batch was only
about 8 ozs but it is currently dropping out in primary. 
I also noticed that my pH dropped to 4.9-5.1 for my preboil wort which
seemed a little lower than usual.  I also had much greater yield from this
batch (shooting for 1.056 and wound up w/ 1.066). 


This was a robust porter using 1.25 lbs dark grain. Mash was 135`at`15min
154`at`60min and mashout. 


Any comments or ideas on why the break was so weak??

Dan asks what beers use Munich as the base malt.


Well, Munchner Dunkel is an obvious example, same with Dunkelweizen.
Also, Duesseldorfer Altbier is typically made with 90 to 99% Munich
malt.  Light Munich (Weyermann makes one) would be my choice as the
base malt for an Oktoberfest.  There is no problem with using 100%
Munich malt except that you should be a *little* more careful with
your rest temperatures (don't overshoot) because Munich malt has lost
more enzymes during kilning and you wouldn't want (for example) to
accidentally overshoot 158F and keep the mash at 165F for too long.

Careful -- you don't want to take a sour fruit beer and call it a
lambic.  First, that would be mislabelling, which is immoral.
Second, you might get sued for trademark infringement!  (Maybe
instead of a p-Lambic it's a K-Lambic -- a Koch lambic?)


Is John familiar with fruit beers?  With the natural sugars fermented
out, I'd expect blueberries to be quite tart.  It may not be infected.


If it IS an infection, I would guess the bottle-grenade potential is
fairly high, so take care.


Monitor it and see if infection problems develop -- bad taste, excess
carbonation, texture changes, rings of gunk on the bottle necks.  I'm
afraid this means you'll have to keep drinking it on a regular basis,
but you expected to make some sacrifices, right?  :-)


If it doesn't have active infection problems, you might age some
bottles and see how the beer does in six months or a year.  With 7%
alcohol to preserve it and a taste in need of mellowing, this could
be a great next-year beer.

It may give you new, good and interesting beers.  Do you need a

I haven't heard about anyone culturing wild infections, so you're a
pathfinder.  If it sounds like a fun thing to try, see what happens.
(As long as this isn't your sustenance beer.)  After all, somebody
had to try soaking barley for the first time.


If you're familiar with microbiological culturing methods, you may be
able to isolate this yeast or bacteria.  If you're not, you can try
anyway, but you should expect to kill or contaminate a few cultures
during the learning process.  You may yet succeed.


Or take the Belgian approach: if it works, don't screw with it.  Some
of those guys still open the attic windows to "pitch" the local wild
yeasts, just like their ancestors did.


I'd try making a fairly plain non-fruit beer, lightly hopped, and
pour a bottle or two of the blueberry into the fermenter.  (If you
pitch yeast in addition, I supposed you'd better use the same yeast
too, so you don't get dueling colonies.)  See if it significantly
sours that batch.


If possible, save the yeast sediment from the fermenter for later use
- -- you can pitch it later if it didn't work.  See previous HBDs for
methods to save yeast, but I don't think you'd want to "wash" it,
since you're trying to SAVE a wild infection.


You might use a blowoff tube, and save BOTH the blowoff and the
sediment, and see if they give different results.


Maybe use 1-gallon test batches.  Cheaper, less work, quicker
results, and you'd use up less of the blueberry ale.  I'd guess 1/2
bottle is plenty for a gallon, if it's going to work at all.

Subject: sulfites


A quick comment on using sulfites in cider. I will say that most my
knowledge is book learning and not from experience. Also, my cider books are
on loan and this is from memory. My understanding is that sulfites are more
effective at lower pH. That is, it takes less SO2 to do the job in an acidic
environment. If I recall correctly, the range of pH in apple juice ranges
from about 3.3-3.8. There is a chart  from Ashton Station that says how many
tablets to use based on pH. My problem was it was written in tabs per gallon
but I used US gallons. which also contributed to my over-sulfiting (see my
previous post). Dave

You bet.


1) It's hard to regulate your evaporation rate. It's nearly impossible to
boil too vigorously, and 1-and-20 is certainly not too long.  How about
just keeping a small amount of water boiling on a side burner to use for
a volume correction near the end of your boil?  Works for me.


2) 3 1/2 oz of hops can hold a lot of wort. How are you getting your wort
from kettle to fermenter? I use an immersion coil chiller in the kettle,
and then rack to the carboy through a slotted copper  racking tube that
lays on the kettle bottom (similar to the popular lauter manifold design
but much shorter). As the wort level in the kettle drops low  enough to
expose the hops, it is necessary to choke down the flow to a trickle to
drain the last 1/2-1 gallon of goodies. The more hops, the sooner you
gotta choke it. More patience=more wort.

        For all those who read Jeff's rants about the GABF and have never
been there.  Ignore him, if you ever get a chance go.  It is fun,
educational, and social.  If you think it is too crowded to try all
the good beer you can drink (and pour the bad stuff away) and have several
conversations with other brewers and beer lovers, both pro and amature,
than you are probably standing around whinning too much.
        Not trying to be mean, it's just that I would hate to see anyone
miss out on a great time next year because of one angry man.  And the
price is still about what I would spend if I drank that much good beer at
a bar, but the bar is far less fun. 
        Now back to brewing, it is much more interesting than politics.
