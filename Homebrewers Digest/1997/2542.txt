see what they might have. The malt was in pretty bad shape. It had been
sitting around since last January. I did manage to buy seven cases of new
beer bottles for $2 a case. Anyway, here's the rest of the equipment listed
for sale.

Subject: new contest categories


Not being the most creative guy in the world, I've decided to get help from
you all.
I am now planning the Second Annual Homebrew Contest to be held next March.
Our first contest was very sucessful but ordinary. For the next contest I
would like to offer alternative categories for the really good beer that
doesn't really fit well into the AHA style guidelines. I expect 125 entries.


Please don't spam me for encourging 'punk' brewing. I love a hoppy IPA just
like the next HBDer, I just think brewers make some funky stuff worth
judging. And the beginers are discouraged from entering by the guideline's
fine print.


Current alternative category ideas include;


1.Beers brewed with at least 25 ingredients.
2. Don't know what it's called, but it tastes good.
3. At least 50 HBU's [or 60] 
4. No hops at all. [How many spruce beers can YOU judge?]
5. My first beer.


Well, as you can see I need help with interesting categories. I would like to
encourage newbies to enter and I think the AHA styles are too rigid for some
casual brewers. My experience last year was that many newbies had good beer
that they entered in the wrong category because they didn't have the
understanding of the guidelines they needed. Any help? private email ok.


Thanks,
Alan Talman

Subject: Stuck Fermentation?


I'm brewing up a Brewer's Resource Brewtek American Brown Ale, using the
Wyeast that came with the kit- an American 1056 (I think).


Primary fermentation was for 6 days at 68F.  Racked to secondary, stored in
a dark 64-66F closet.  So far, I have yet to see one "blurp" from the
airlock (from my casual observations in the last week).  Me thinks the
secondary is stuck.


My question is, what do I do now?  Do I add priming sugar and bottle?  Do I
try to get the yeast working again?  If so, how?

No - the gases diffuse thru the airlock during active fermentation too,
tho perhaps more slowly.  The extra turbulent mixing during active
fermentation increases the diffusion - doesn't eliminate it.  However my
main concern with O2 is after fermentation has slowed since presumably
oxygen introduced during the ferment will be quickly used by the yeast
anyway.


> That said, the diffusion rate will be proportional to the

The diffusion also is proportional to the concentration gradient from
outside to in, so a rather long tube should help too. Surface tension
tends to keep the bubbles large, so a considerable amount of liquid must
move in a long thin airlock  in order to pass a bubble.

My CRC says that the order is cyclohexane>CCl4>ethanol, not your order
(see below).
Here I've included the dipole moments, also from the CRC.
                                                
                         Dipole moment  O2 diffusion

Tho' dipole moment may be part of the story, I'd really like to see a
more physical explanation than a trend drawn from 3 data points. 
Incidentally H2 has it's lowest listed diffusion constant for
ethylene-glycol (dipole moment = 2.28) which has a much higher dipole
moment than other more H2 diffusive solvents.


>Other advantages of water include low toxicity, low volatility, no adverse
>effect on heading, ...


True, but there are many solvents that are non-toxic and non-volatile.
Mineral and vegeable oils and gylcerine come immediately to mind. A
properly designed airlock shouldn't allow for suck-in of the airlock
fluid anyway. 


>CO2 makes a great blanket gas for protecting O2-sensitive materials, since
>it's heavier than air.  Cl2 is even heavier, and would easily sink through
>a CO2 blanket.  I wouldn't add bleach to airlock water.


Nice myth - protective CO2 blanket, but this isn't how gas diffusion
works.  The CO2 and O2 (and N2) don't remain separate for long, but thru
brownian motion mix in spite of the CO2 being heavier. I agree with the
bleach comment - Cl has other negatives too, but the O2 does diffuse
into the CO2 blanket a fermentor, and that the CO2 blanket diffuses
out.  Take a bucket and fill it with CO2 from a tank.  Dropping a match
in immediately after filling - the match will go out at it hits the CO2
'blanket'.  Try it again after waiting a few tens of minutes - then the
match doesn't go out.  Putting a layer of water in your airlock slows
but doesn't stop the diffusion process.  If would be nice to find a
better choice than water if possible.


My real concern is the amount of non-enzymatic browning, and resultant
staling that can place in a fermenter left for days/weeks after
fermenation ceases with an airlock.  The amount of browning that occurs
is quite obvious - I've spoken with several other brewers who are also
familiar with this effect.  Since I travel quite a bit a fermenter may
sit for several weeks to several months after fermentation slows. First
clearing occurs as the yeast drops, then, a variable length of time from
several weeks to several months the beer darkens remarkably.  This
doesn't have an immediate flavor impact, but isn't a good sign.

The major problem with converting a cooker such as this or finding a
methane cooker is that they're both designed to be used outdoors.
Neither has any means of shutting down the gas flow if the main burner
goes out.  This is especially scary when considering the amount of gas
this could dump into your house in just a few minutes.  1 cubic foot of
methane has slightly more than 1000 btu.  So your 100,000 btuh burner
would dump 100 cubic feet per minute.  Find a burner that will shut down
the gas valve if the flame goes out if you're planning on brewing
indoors.

        A friend in an industrial hose shop banged me out some hose

I've been brewing with extracts for about a year now and have been quite
satisfied (with one notable exception, which was a result of a procedural
error, not extract itself) with the results. How is brewing with extracts not
"doing it yourself?" I choose what extracts and in what amount, I choose the
type of yeast (and I have used both liquid and dry), amount of specialty
grains, amount and timing of hop additions. My beer is very much done myself.


>Extract is a lazy way to make a batch of beer.  If you really enjoy the

I'm sorry, but this is utter bunk. It is a cheap shot to call extract brewers
lazy. Many have neither the time nor the money to invest in an all-grain
system. Plus, if you're making good beer that you enjoy, why in the world would
you want to make your brew day twice as long? Yet it is still possible, with
quality ingredients and good procedure to make beer with extracts that rivals
the best craft brews and, yes, even all-grain produced brews.


Of course, this is coming from the same guy who said in HBD #2288 about those
who might consider no-sparge brewing:

Yes, that comment has been stuck in my craw for quite some time.


Sorry about the tirade but this really annoys me. And, yes, I am going to try
my hand at all-grain brewing as my previous posts have shown. Not because I
feel I _must_, but because it is something I've always _wanted_ to try. I can
very easily see myself brewing with extracts again, especially the recipes I've
particularly enjoyed.

Chris White, president of White Labs, wrote in part to HBD:

Right. And if people search the HBD archives, they'll find that Dr. White 
used to claim his vials of yeast had many times that amount until Jim 
Liddil and I proved him wrong.  Now as to whether the amount of yeast in 
the tube is sufficent for pitching into five gallons of beer, I guess it 
depends on what you call "sufficent". Certainly White Labs is selling you 
more yeast than Wyeast, but neither is sufficient in my mind for pitching 
directly. But a 12 hour lag time is just not aceeptable in my brewery.  
Better than the 24-36 hours from a swelled pack of Wyeast, but not 
acceptable.


Accepted pitching rates are from 0.75 to 2 x 10^6 cells per ml per Deg 
Plato of the wort (low end for ales, high end for lagers).  So for  5 
gallons (19 liters) of a 1.052 OG wort (about 13 deg Plato), I come up 
with 19000 ml times 13 times 0.75 x10^6 or 185 billion cells on the low 
end and about 500 billion cells on the high end.  That's anywhere from 6 
to 10 times the amount of yeast you're getting in the tube.  High gravity 
beers need even more.


Bottom line, make a large enough starter to get the quantity of yeast you 
need, oxygenate it well, and oxygenate your wort well, too. You'll be 
glad you did. 


If you can't or won't make a starter, just rehydrate a couple or three 
packs of Nottingham dry yeast. Just as all-grain beers aren't necessarily 
better than extract beers, liquid yeast, improperly handled or used, is 
not necessarily better than dry.

make crystal malt with it to go with some of my ale recipes.  I am also
willing to experiment in using it as a base malt for some trial and error
brews since it's there and it's paid for.   I need some ideas on malting,
drying, and step mashing.  I have done single infusion mashes before in
partial mash pilsners.  The first time I tried to mash this I screwed up
and it went bad.  I saw rootlets but the "acrospire" never seemed to
grow.  Now I think someone said that the acrospire grows inside the husk,
so it may have been fully modified and I didn't know it.  After a couple
of weeks the whole thing just smelled sour.  I will add that this crop
was accepted as brewing barley, a good colored six row american, not feed
barley.  I would like to find out what I can do with equipment I have on
hand to use this grain over the winter.  it is in cool and dry storeage
now in the garage.  Private E Mail fine.  Any worthwhile results will be
forwarded to the masses.  TIA

Subject: Dry Hoppping Question


I just did my first batch of beer involving dry hopping and now need to
bottle or keg it and am not sure about what to do.


I added the hops when I racked to a secondary.  So now that I am about
to bottle or keg I need to know the best way to get rid of all the
hops.  I am thinking about a metal wire strainer or a cheesecloth. 
Anyone want to tell me what has worked for them?


I looked through the FAQ's at realbeer.com and went back through the
archives at HBD but everthing I found just talks about adding the hops.

Brew Masters,


With all of the talk about brewing water and my curiosity for knowledge I
could use some help as I am water chemistry challanged. I have a copy of
the treated water quality report (WQR) from my local water quality lab but
this thing is forty pages long. I have narrowed it down to one page that
looks like it pertains to the information I need. By looking at Brewers
Workshop (BW) I see the following water chemistry fields for Tap Water
Ions: Ca, Na, Mg, Cl, SO4, CO3, HDNS and TDS. I have all the numbers I need
except for CO3. Now in the WQR under "General" Ca is expressed as CaCO3 (82
mg/L) and under Metals there is Ca (31.2 mg/L) by it self but no CO3
anywhere else that I could find. BW has two fields one for Ca and one for
CO3. How do I figure the CO3 from the CaCO3. Do I just subtract the Ca
amount from the CaCO3 or is it more complicated than that. Is there more
information required to figure this out.

    Dennis Putnam asked about spicing up an ale for the

    While you can add whatever spices in whatever way you
want (almost all ways work),
a best bet is to brew a tea you can add at bottling time.
You can control the effect that
way and add just to suit your tastes and no more.
    Adding to the primary or secondary, while it makes for a
wonderful smell in the house,
probably drives off most of the aromatics you would want to
preserve. The same can
be said for adding pre-boil or during the boil. You lose
more than you gain I would
think.
    If you are REALLY worried about sanitation, what you
could do is to place the spices
in a canning jar with the water and pressure can them long
enough to sterilize the tea.
You do it just as if you were canning vegetables.The spices
stay in until you are ready to
add the tea at bottling time. Most of the aromatics will
still be there and the tea should be
about as sterile as you can make it. Can't say I've tried
it, but its worth thinking about if
you have access to the pressure canner and nothing better to
experiment with at the time.

i.e. non-alcoholic root beer.  Made some from extract this summer.  Was
nervous about putting yeast in that much sugar water and capping it up. 
Only used 1/2 tsp. of dry ale yeast and mixed it up and bottled.  Waited
for a few days for explosions and then waited a few weeks to try it after
nothing blew up.  When we sampled there was NO carbonation at all.  Never
developed any over 4 months the stuff was arround.  Still made fairly
good root beer floats.
Now I want to try this again WITH carbonation.  So will someone tell me
how to bottle condition this without blowing up the basement?  How much
yeast can I / should I use?  What kind?  Why doesn't it blow up?  I will
be storing at about 65 degrees F. and don't have room to refrigerate it.

Subject: Hydrometer vs. Refractometer


After reading "How to Get the Most out of Your Measuring Instruments" in the
most recent issue of Brewing Techniques, I decided to check the accuracy of
my "trusty" hydrometer. It was a real eye-opener! First, I checked it in
distilled water, something I had done before: 1.000, just like it should be.
Then, following the instructions in the article, I measured 50-g NaCl into
my 1000-mL volumetric flask (Class A). The gravity should have read 1.050,
but instead read at 1.035. Not even close.


So, my question is, do I go out and buy a new hydrometer (actually, I'd get
two, one specifically for measuring F.G.), or do I spend the extra money and
get a refractometer? It seems to me that the biggest advantage of getting a
refractometer is its smaller sample size--I could take readings at any stage
in the brewing process without having to remove a 250-mL sample each time. 


What are your opinions on this matter? Recomendations?

Subject: Extract Good?


>>Bill Said
I agree with Al that you can make good beer with extract, but with the
available base malts I honestly believe that better beer is made all
grain.   Plus look at the amount of satisfaction you get from doing it
youself.  Extract is a lazy way to make a batch of beer.  If you really
enjoy the hobby then go for it make the best beer you can the same way
the "Big Guys" do.
- -----
To say that extract brewers are using the lazy way, is to say that
bakers are lazy because they don't grind their own flour.  Extract and
partial mash brews can be very good; I'm sure I've seen Gold Medal NHC
winners that are extract, and I know personally they are among the other
medals.  I can say that all-grain beers are among my best beers, and
they also have been among my worst beers, though my (by brew-partner and
I actually) best award was for an accidental partial mash  (I thought I
was steeping but later learn the grains I used had starch to convert. 
Since I don't think I was a starch beer, something converted.)


When an extract brewer uses the lightest malts, and darkens and flavors
the beer with specialty grains steeped or partial mashed, uses unhopped
extract, liquid yeasts with starters, proper aeration, water
preparation, keeps the fermentation temp constant and low, uses
finings,  and more, I would not call that person lazy.  One can get
plenty of satisfaction from the work.  Does one call an all-grain brewer
who filters and force-carbonates lazy because they take the 'easy' way
out?


The last pair of beers my brew-partner and I made were extract/specialty
(two in a day); the beer before was all grain (a triple decotion), it
depends on the time one has and the amount of hassle one can put up
with, and whether to try and convert a former good recipe to all-grain. 
Good beer can be the result either way.

Well, Mike, as you know from beer brewing, yeasts can produce a variety o=

wort.  If you used Montrachet as the strain of wine yeast, the sulfur sme=

is a typical result of this yeast. In winemaking, I avoid it by racking
early and often as I believe it is subject to autolysis and produces
hydrogen sulfide. In winemaking, for extreme cases,  I sometimes resort t=

a copper sulfate treatment , but often it disappears over time as the win=

Subject: A fine working glass airlock design


Hello everyone! I really think I shouldn't expand a thread so =
unsolicitedly "colorful" as Steve Alexander's (HBD #2539) posting =
about airlocks, but with the questioner (Joshua Penney) in mind I =
will carry on.  Being forced by geographical isolation (I live and =
brew in Venezuela -not a single homebrew supplies retailer around =
here yet-), I had to explore all possible alternatives to a costly =
overseas cargo and customs deal before buying any accessories =
States-side for my recently found hobby.  By a lucky chance I =
happened to get in touch with a laboratory glass artisan in the =
capital (Caracas, pop. +10 MM), who hand makes and repairs all type =
of lab glassware.  Put to the question of reproducing my broken "S" =
type glass airlock, the man told me he could make me a much better =
and smaller airlock.  Next day, Gabriel (his name is Gabriel Bukor), =
had made this incredibly simple device that he says is lab tested to =
withstand a lot more intake pressure than what my 4,75 gal. glass =
carboy setup could generate by cooling after initial fermentation, =
without sucking any barrier liquid (he insists I use only tap water), =
which the device uses in only minute quantities (3 or 4 drops).  =
Without any fancy equipment I once put my lips to the stopper side of =
it and sucked to see if he was right, and indeed the device didn't =
allow any of the water into my mouth.  On the other side of it's =
performance, the excess CO2 escape part, It works very well.  I now =
substitute the bubble counting present in some fermentation vigor =
sounding instructions to airlock clicks.  You see, the airlock works =
this way (please bear with my rough ascii sketch):

There is a small unitank shaped cylinder (1,25" dia. x 2,5" tall) =
that is intersected by a small diameter tube (0,30"dia x 3,5" long), =
then there's the "movable part" (and only draw-back I see in this =
design because If you're unmindful it can get lost), the inverted =
midget test tube with a little more diameter than the intersecting =
tube, that you insert in it and whose "lips" should always be in =
contact with the barrier liquid (represented with tilde marks in the =
sketch), and which acts by going up to let the gas bubble escape, =
then down through simple gravity to close the airlock as soon as =
pressure diminishes, emitting a distinctive clicking sound.
The reason I represent this airlock here is that though I sincerely =
doubt it comes originally from Gabriel's fervent mind, I have never =
seen anything like this device in any homebrew supplies catalog (and =
I've studied a few).  I always see this look-alike plastic airlocks =
that I have never purchased because I prefer glass over plastic =
anytime for this application (try to wash a plastic airlock by simply =
boiling it 15 minutes then to sanitize it by a 2 hour 250=AA regular =
oven bake), then, compared to your regular "S" shape airlock, even as =
it is a little more complicated to manufacture (Gabriel charged me =
the same for making one or the other from scratch, a little less than =
$6), it's almost half the height of the latter, thus saving you some =
storage space.

Subject: Electric Brewing / Fermentation Chiller


Chas asks about electrically heating water.  He wants 5 gal to go to 190F in
20 minutes.


A formula for figuring the power required to raise a certain amount of water
to a certain temerpature is


P = 150 * gal * (temp-rise) / minutes


The 150 is actually a little higher than the "ideal" coefficient but this way
it accounts for some inevitable heat loss (and is easier for me to
remember!).


Plugging in Chas' specs (assuming 70F starting) we get 4500W.  On a 240V
circuit this is around 19 amps.  So a standard 240V 4500W element ought to
work nicely  (**WITH A GFCI BREAKER!!!**).  This would require almost 40A on
a 120V circuit, which is practically out of the question, unless two separate
dedicated 20A circuits were used.  This is the nice thing about splitting the
240V dryer circuit into two 120V circuits -- you get the 30A capacity, plus
you can use $6 120V GFCI's installed in 50-cent boxes nailed to your brewery
framework instead of having to install a $100 240V GFCI in your breaker panel
(and pay an electrician on top of that).


Note that when heating water, scorching due to high power density isn't an
issue, as it would be in a mash tun or boiler.  For those applications, one
would want to spread the heat out over multiple elements; aim for less than
25W/sq-in as a no-scorch target.  In my boiler, for example, I use two 240V /
4500W elements, each running off one 120V phase of the 240V line, which gives
me 1125W on each element, but at a low enough PD to prevent scorching.  Seems
I remember that my PD is somewhere around 20 - 25 W/sq-in, and I have no
trouble with scorching or caramelization.  This arrangement, however, is not
adequate for such rapid heating as Chas requests, but again, you can get away
with high PD when heating plain water.

Matt asked whether I have any experience with / information on adding
electromechanical refrigeration to my Fermentation Chiller design.


Nope, not personally, but there are many possible approcahes to this.  One
way is to simply add a small "room" onto the front of a fridge.  Remove the
door and build an insulated box that can attach to the fridge.  Basically an
extension of the original fridge.  Either the whole fridge can be
temperature-controlled, or the box can have a thermostatically-controlled fan
rationing the cold air, much like the Chiller.


One could use a little cube fridge (~$100) as a cold source.  Remove the door
and you have a relatively compact source of enough cold air to keep one or
two fermenters happy.  I read here once where a guy was making "wine cellars"
by actually carving away the plastic & metal shell of such a fridge, then
building the remaining fridge "guts" into a cabinet and adding a thermostat.
 Great idea, and you don't have to mess with disconnecting and reconnecting
the refrigeration circuit.


You can duct the Chiller to a fridge or freezer; run one duct from the
freezer to the Chiller and another from the Chiller back to the fridge to
"conserve" cold air by recirculating it.  The thermostat in the Chiller will
take care of pulling cold air when needed.  The Chiller can be reduced to a
simple box, with the "IN" duct feeding the fan, while the open exhaust notch
would feed the return duct.  Such an arrangement can be added to a chest
freezer in a similar way to adding taps -- build a wooden "collar" for the
freezer between the box and the lid, and add holes to the collar for the
ductwork.

Subject: stainless steel welds - question


Hi all,


I've been lurking for a while, and hope a metallurgist among us can give =
me an answer  (Mr. Palmer? ? ?).  I just had several SS couplings TIG wel=
ded onto a converted keg, and noticed that inside the keg around each of =
the welds is a dark grey slag.  It's only a small area around the couplin=
g, but I'm wondering if there is anything I can or should do to get rid =
of it.  Should I grind it out? Leave it alone? Buff it? What... What... =
What!!!


Sorry, but I want to make beer in this kettle, and I would rather do it =
right.


Thanks for any and all answers.


If there is interest I'll post a summary.
