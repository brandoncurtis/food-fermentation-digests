GUINNESS (Draught)
==================


"Massive hop presence with pronounced roast barley notes. Ripe bittersweet
balance with tart fruit and great length of hops, fruit, coffee, and
chocolate notes. A world classic, jet black beer with enormous complexity
and character." [1]
Smooth and full, aftertaste with a hoppy acidity. [2]




Ref.            [1]              [2]
=========================================

Colour (EBC)    125              130


WATER: The St.  James's Gate brewery uses Dublin water, but the Park Royal
brewery outside London uses water from the Thames Valley Water Authority,
and claim that they use no water treatment. [1]


GRAINS: Pale malt, roasted barley (9%) and flaked barley. [1]
Pale malt, roasted barley (10%) and flaked barley (25%). [2]




MASH: Old procedure: Mash in with 2.1 l/kg at 64.5 C (148 F), rest 70 min.
New procedure: Mash in at 62 C (144 F) with added beta-glucanase, raised
slowly to 64.5C (148 F) for conversion. [1]


HOPS: The old procedure was to add the hops when the kettle was 2/3 full. [1]
Several varities are used among whose Goldings may be the most dominant.
[2]


FERMENTATION: The wort was cooled to 17-18 C, then rises to 23-27 C. This
took about 36-48 hours. It was then centrifuged, cooled to 8-9 C, fined
with isinglass and lagered at 7 C for at least 5 days. Then gyle is added
and the beer heated to 20 C and conditioned for 72 hours. [1] (Lewis also
mentions the Guinness Flavor Essence (GFE), but he doesn't say which of
the many versions of Guinness this is added to.)
The fermentation temperature is 25C. [2]




MURPHY'S
========


"Distinctively toasty tasting, malty, and very dry." [1]
Not as offensive as Guinness but drier than Beamish with a hint of
well-toasted bread. A firm but light and smooth body. [2]
"A distinctively toasty-tasting, malty, interpretation of the style." [3]

GRAINS: Ale malt and roasted barley mashed at 62 C (143 F), mash thickness
3.5 l/kg. [1]
Chocolate malt dominates instead of roasted barley. Once raw wheat was used
to give a firm head, but this has been replaced by wheat malt to increase
attenuation. [2]


HOPS: Bittering: Target, Challenger, Perle, Aroma: Challenger, Goldings,
all pellets. [1]
The hopping schedule includes Challenger, Goldings and German Hersbruck. [2]

Subject: RIMS questions


Beerlings,


I'm getting my RIMS together and have a few questions before
I make a mistake that will cost me $$$.


1. Can you get HSA by the splashing of the sparge water?  I
want to heat my sparge water in my brewpot and pump it to the
HLT.  I would be using a non magnetically coupled pump (read
not my RIMS pump).
2. Will my RIMS pump overheat or suffer other damage if the
output flow is restricted too much?  I'd like to use the pump
during sparging but am concerned that the low flows required
for sparging may overheat the pump.  I don't want to have to
buy a new pump after a couple of batches.


TIA,

Subject: Airlocks


HBDers,


An airlock thread seems to be developing, so I thought I'd
resubmit my rather unorthodox approach to airlocks for
comments/criticisms.


Scaling up from 10 to 25+ gallon batches has forced me to 
reexamine my brewing procedures to help lighten the workload.
Having to prepare 4 or 5 conventional 3 piece airlocks at the
end of 9 hour brewday seemed a real PITA.


What I now do is simply place a double folded piece of 
aluminum foil right over the carboy mouth.  Form it snugly
over the edges and forget about.  Obviously, the C02 can 
escape since I've yet to have a problem with the foil blowing
off.  


Not being a science man, I'd like comments on my procedure
in terms of comparing to the conventional airlock.  If the job of
an airlock is to keep out nasties, it seems to me that the foil can
do this nicely.  Having used the foil on the last 20 or so carboys
w/o a problem tells me that the foil does the job.

Dear Friends, 


Michel Brown wrote, referring to the temperature of the rocks used in
making steinbier:


|>Nine, mein freund! Actually it is made by heating Graywacke rocks to 1200'C

This temperature cannot be correct.  Graywackes will be more than 50%
*molten* at 1200 C and atmospheric pressure. Either it is actually 1200 F
(about 650C, much more reasonable)  or the number 1200 is a transcription
error.  Even granite or a high-grade metamorphic rock will be at least 30%
melt, and probably a lot more, at 1200C, depending on the minerals present
in the rock; 1200 C is where much more "primitive"  compositions, such as
basaltic lavas (e.g. the stuff that's been coming out of Kilauea in Hawaii
for the past several years), *begin* to crystallize at atmospheric
pressure. Melting rocks is what I do for a living, so I am for once
speaking with some authority. Please folks, don't try to heat your rocks
to 1200 C unless you want to make magma!

Subject: 4 hour mash - off tastes?


I usually end up doing a 4 hour 153 F mash out of convenience/schedule 
etc. Does anyone know if this can cause any off flavors or tastes in the 
resulting beer (usually English ales)? I have heard that overnight mashes 
might give you a sour mash but this shouldn't be the case in 4 hours. Do 
the enzymes keep on "muching" at the sugars even when all the starch has 
been converted at the 60-90 minute mark? Is this a bad thing?

Subject: Rusty Nail Porter


Dear HBD Hive,


Recently produced a partial mash porter (I'm really an all grain kind of
guy, but I wanted to use up the extract).  I've made some pretty bad
beers in my time, but this is the worst.  The first sip tasted like I
just sucked on a rusty nail.  I've never encountered such a metallic off
taste and am at loss to explain it.  My best guesses are:


1.  Old extract
2.  Too high SG without conditioning starter (some bad math on my part)
3.  Lousy central TX tapwater
4.  chips in enamel pot
5.  just wait a few months and it will go away (AKA wishful thinking)


any help is much appreciated, private e-mail fine.

Subject: re BT hydrometer calibration method


Harlan Bauer in HBD 2542 had trouble calibrating his hydrometer to a
procedure given in the September issue of Brewing Techniques. My guess is
that 1.035 is dead on.


The procedure given in Brewing Techniques is not accurate.The author seems
to have forgotten to take account of the specific volume of the salt (if
that's the proper term). Salt has volume, even when dissolved. By
dissolving 50 grams of salt and making that up to one litre, you do not end
up with one litre of water plus 50 grams of salt. The weight of water in
that solution less than 1 kilogram (1 litre) by whatever is the weight of
water the salt has displaced. Simlarly, if you take one litre of water and
add 50 grams of salt to that, the volume will increase, so, although it
will weigh 1,050 grams in total, it will not weigh 1,050 grams per litre.
The true sg could be calculated if we had an accurate figure for the
specific volume(?) of salt, but I don't have access to that sort of
information.


You could perform the calibration just by using the indicated weight on the
scales, which might be what the author of the article intended, but there
are not many scales that will weigh 50 grams of salt to sufficient
accuracy, and also weigh 1 kilo of water plus the weight of the flask plus
the salt to a similar accuracy.


The way I would tackle it would be to get a precision measuring cylinder,
put 1 litre of distilled water in it, then add 50 grams of salt to THAT.
Make sure the the salt is dissolved fully, then measure the new volume. The
sg can then be calculated by dividing the total weight (1,050 grams) by the
new volume. Any convenient volume and weight of salt can be used.


Also, I would prefer to use sugar solutions rather than salt solutions.
Hydrometers are, theoretically at least, affected by surface tension. I
suspect that the surface tension of a sugar solution is closer than salt to
what we would expect in beer (although that may not necessarily be true).
Dave Whitman has shown by experimentation (private correspondence) that the
effect of surface tension on sg is negligible as far as beer is concerned,
particularly at lowish gravities that we commonly employ, but it may be a
wise precaution to get S.T. as close to beer as possible.

Chris,
I just did my first Dry-Hop about a two months ago and (an amber ale with =
cascade hops for bittering, finishing and dry) it was the absolute best =
beer I=27ve ever brewed.  I had the same question as you and I asked my =
friendly local homebrew shop about using a nylon mesh strainer that I use =
when transfering the wort to the primary.  He didn=27t seem to think it =
was a good idea due to loss of yeast that may be needed for carbonation.


What I did do was after the secondary fermant died down, I lowered the =
temprature of the secondary in a water bath with a t-shirt draped over it =
and let it lager for a good ten days so all the big stuff would drop out =
of suspension, then was careful to rack off the top and leave a good inch =
at the bottom.  This atually turned into a very clear and wonderfully =
hoppy brew.


I just did an IPA using fuggle hops for the dry, but the overall hoppiness =
is not a prevelant as it was with the amber using the cascade.  (In fact, =
I liked it so much, I=27m doing another amber this weekend=21)

I too read that article last night and =


was appalled at what a poor job
the authors did in a magazine I
normally respect very highly.
Shame on them!


It is obvious that the authors never
tried the calibration with the sodium chloride,
never showed how to calibrate for
pressure differences, etc., etc.


In my handy dandy Chemical Rubber Handbook
56th ed., p D-253, the density of the solution
of sodium chloride at 20 degrees C for
50.6 grams per liter is 1.033.
Corrected to 60 deg F
this would be almost exactly 1.035.  =


Your hydrometer sounds perfect
 - the article is screwed up!


Some more numbers:


 g/l NaCl       density at 20C
    10.1        1.007
    20.2        1.014
    30.6        1.021
    40.0        1.028
    50.6        1.033
    60.3        1.042
    71.2        1.049
    80.0        1.055
    91.2        1.062
  100.2 1.068                           =




These number are based on anhydrous solute,
so if you want to be extra R/A you should =


dry the salt at 110C for a while,
although sodium chloride does not
pick up a lot of moisture from the air.


While we're at it, here's sucrose probably
a better candidate for this use due to its
similarity, better solubility and high purity:

A refractomer is pretty useless for
this kind of use, but it can be useful as
a quick test for standardized cases.  =


Personally, I wouldn't bother with it.


I certainly wouldn't use a hydrometer
for determining endpoint of a fermentation
( see Clinitest), although it can be useful
for determining the estimated alcohol content
( +/- 0.5%) along with the OG. =




The normal hydrometers are OK for this use,
since the estimated error in the calculation is
so high, take less sample and are much cheaper.

Probably not stuck, just finished. =


 Racking it probably removed most of the
 yeast and kicked off a lot of the CO2.  =


If you moved it to a colder spot that can
 sometimes shut down an ale fermentation like 1056.


If you want to know if it is finished =


or not get the Clinitest KIT with tablets
 *not* test sticks ( may need to special
 order at your pharmacy). and =


check it for residual sugar.
  If is is less than 1/2% sugar,
 put it somewhere cool and allow it
 to clear for a few more days and
 then prime and bottle as usual. =


 You may wish to add a fermenting
 Kraeusen starter made from the
 secondary yeast to be assured
 it will properly carbonate.
  If it's not finished, then make up a starter
 from the secondary yeast, =


move it to a warmer place and finish it out.

If you used whole leaf hops, then use =


a Choreboy scrubber attached to the

  If you have rabbit pelleted hops,

 Try fastening a piece of boiled nylon

 Above all do not "filter" these off by
 allowing the beer to pass through the air.
 Having a few bits of hops isn't all that bad
 and I have had some small bits in the
 early days of  "real Ales" drinking in Britain.
 Next time use whole hops, if you didn't.
 Think about using the hops in a cheesecloth bag.

I just bottled a porter a few weeks ago, and to the last 1 or 2 gallons I
added a strong tea of spices. I Just boiled the water for about ten
minutes, threw in the spices ( I used ginger root and licorice root), and
boiled for maybe another minute or two. Then dumped the tea into the
bottling bucket. The spiced porter came out great with no sign of

I tried ducting the cooling tube thru a "dorm" fridge. There wasn't enough

shunt the tap water thru the pre-chiller and in to the wort chiller. The
cooling time went down to 20 minutes. Even simpler is to wait the 30

Anheuser-Busch is test marketing an agave-beer with additional flavor of
tequila/lime added in post fermentation.   They can't use the trade name
tequila, because that is protected by NAFTA -- only tequela made in
Mexico can be so named.  So they came up with a variation on the
spelling;  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think they spell it Tequeza.  
 Has anyone tried this stuff?   What do you think? 


I have done a couple test batches with a 40/60 ratio of agave to malt. 
Came out prety good, but I still have some tweaking of the recipe to do. 
I had been thinking about doing a contract brew with agave, but the
person who was going to finance the venture got cold feet.  I think the
basic concept has great marketing potential --kind of would fit into the
Mexican restaurant/Corona crowd.

One possibility is categorizing according to their starting gravity

points for creativity.   Just one idea. 
 
The Nineteenth Annual California State Homebrew Competition organized by
the San Andreas Malts had a good solution for this: They had all the
major categories and in addition to a  few subcategories they had "other"
;  i.e. if you had a wheat that didn't fit into any subcategory, it would
be wheat/other,  or pale ale/other, or porter/other.

Subject: Re. Welding Question


Joe asked what he should do with some apparent slag on the backside of
his TIG welds on fittings in his stainless steel kettle.


My first thought is that TIG welds should not have slag.  Usually only
stick-arc welds (SMAW) or flux cored MIG welds have slag.  So, a) it was
not TIG or b) it is not slag per se.  Nevertheless you have something
gray and nonmetallic on the backside of your welds.


If (a) then it IS slag and you need to grind it off.  I suggest using a
Dremel tool.
If (b) then it could be heavily oxidized filler metal caused by not
having a shielding gas on the inside. Here again, it would be good to
grind it off and expose fresh metal that can be cleaned and
repassivated.


After grinding it out, take some stainless steel cookware cleaner (ex.
Revereware cleanser) and scour the area to remove any free iron from
grinding plus any local discoloration due to oxidation from the weld.
Rinse it with fresh water and dry it.  Then let it sit indoors for a
week to let the chromium oxides reform (repassivate).  Then it should be
fine.

Matthew Arnold is a bit upset. He asks:


>How is brewing with extracts not "doing it yourself?"


This must be somewhat emotive and rhetorical, because the answer is clear.
If you are using a syrup as your chief ingredient in making beer, you are
not doing the following: Picking the grain(s); milling the grains;
converting the soluble starches to sugars; extracting the sugars.


The steps above are significant and do entail some attention and achieved
skill.


Matthew continues:


>I choose what extracts and in what amount, I choose the
>type of yeast (and I have used both liquid and dry), amount of specialty
>grains, amount and timing of hop additions. My beer is very much done
myself.


Quite a bit much, yes. But not nearly as much as going from all grain.


>>Extract is a lazy way to make a batch of beer.  If you really enjoy the

Guys"
>>do.


>I'm sorry, but this is utter bunk. It is a cheap shot to call extract
brewers
>lazy.


To be picky, the above quote does not call extract brewers lazy. It says
"Extract is a lazy way to make a batch of beer." For many who regularly
make all-grain beer, to consider making an extract beer with its savings in
time and effort would seem like something of a luxury - a self-indulgence.
I'd be being lazy if I decided at this point to make an extract beer. Whip
it up and be done in 3-4 hours! That's making beer? <g>


And what does make it laziness, _for me_, is this: Though I've made and
tasted many fine extract beers, I just don't agree with those who
maintain that extract beers are as good as all grain beers. Sorry. It may
not be the "politically correct" thing to say at this juncture, but it's my
belief.


Certainly I've tasted *some* extract beers that were better than *some* all
gain beers. But we're talking a bell curve here. Fresh grain beers are, in
my experience, better than commercially extracted and condensed and
rehydrated syrup beers. On the whole. Other things being equal.


>Sorry about the tirade but this really annoys me. And, yes, I am going to

Write back in a couple years and tell us how many of those wonderful
rehydrated beer recipes you went back to after coming up with all grain
versions of the recipes and enjoying the difference. I liked my beers made
from commercially extracted and condensed syrups, too, and felt similarly
about them. But I haven't felt that buying syrup and replicating them would
be a good use of either my brewing time nor my drinking pleasure since
moving to all grain.


As in anything, YMMV.


Enjoy the brew!

Alan,


It sounds like you're describing a category that is already popular with
many competitions.  It's known by several names around here; The Just Beer,
Strange Brew, Big Beer or Weird Beer Category.  I've seen it described
several ways.  Sometimes the category is described by the minimum HBU's or
Starting Gravity.  Sometimes it's described by, "A beer that doesn't fit
into any style guideline".


Personally, I love these type of categories for competitions, but I think
they work best as an additional category rather than the category for the
entire competition.  Even though it may seem like there are many beers
entered in the "wrong" category, many times most beers are entered
correctly.  If a brewer does brew a beer that nails a particular category,
he or she will usually want it judged against like beers. 


I, also, think these categories encourage newbies and casual brewers to
enter competitions.  And I'm all for that!  However, you also want to
encourage experienced brewers to enter.


Good Luck & Good Beer!

Harlan asks about his hydrometer being off considerably.


I skimmed that article, noticed that salt was mentioned and put it

I don't know how much salt you need to make a 1.050 SG solution
(maybe 50gm in 1000ml is right, but just the use of salt raised
a red flag in my head).  What I *can* tell you that both the Plato
and Balling scales are based on *sugar* (sucrose (table sugar),
to be exact) and here's how you check the accuracy of your hydrometer
using regular table sugar:


Get a very accurate scale.  Weigh out 12 grams of table sugar.
Add 60F water (or whatever temperature your hydrometer is calibrated
at... it will say on it... some newer ones are calibrated at 68F
or 20C) to that sugar until the solution weighs 100 grams (i.e.
add 88 grams of water).  Mix well.  This, by definition, is a
12 Plato solution (very close to 1.048 OG).  Had you used 10
grams of sucrose and 90 grams of water it would have been 10 Plato...
15 grams == 15 Plato... etc.

Brewers:


Ah, the art versus science debate lives on.  It was written in HBD
2542:                


>>Accepted pitching rates are from 0.75 to 2 x 10^6 cells per ml per Deg 
>>Plato of the wort (low end for ales, high end for lagers).  So for  5 
>>gallons (19 liters) of a 1.052 OG wort (about 13 deg Plato), I come

>>low end and about 500 billion cells on the high end.  That's
>>anywhere from 6  to 10 times the amount of yeast you're getting in

Accepted by whom?  Are these the optimum pitching rates that are
accepted by Mega Swilleries?  If 0.75 to 2 x 10^6 cells is truely the low
end, what if I only had 0.74 x 10^6, should I then not pitch my starter?  A
range is a range, the limits are arbitrary.   Aside from optimal
performance of my yeast culture (whatever that is), do these optimum
pitching levels really apply to my home brewery? 


>>Now as to whether the amount of yeast in  the tube is sufficient for
>>pitching into five gallons of >>beer, I guess it  depends on what you
>>call "sufficient". Certainly White Labs is selling you  more yeast than
>>Wyeast, but neither is sufficient in my mind for pitching  directly. But a
>>12 hour lag time is just not aceeptable in my brewery.   Better than
>>the 24-36 hours from a swelled pack of Wyeast, but not  acceptable.


Come on now 12 hours isn?t that bad is it?  That means that if I pitch my
starter by midnight on a late brewing evening, I can expect my wort to be
actively brewing by lunch time the next day.  Sounds pretty acceptable
to me.


>>Bottom line, make a large enough starter to get the quantity of yeast
>>you  need, oxygenate it well, and oxygenate your wort well, too. You'll
>>be  glad you did. 




I agree in making a large starter, oxygenating it well, and oxygenating
wort too.  But, actually the bottom line is whatever you find it takes to
make good on a consistent basis in your home brewery.  If someone
consistently pitches a White Labs ?pitchable? starter (or a swollen smack
pack -  sans starter for that matter) and consistently comes up with good
results (no matter what the lag time), then this is acceptable and the
amount of starter used was indeed ?pitchable?.  You could pitch a gallon
of yeast starter, oxygenate with pure O2,  have a 1 hour lag time, and
still end up with crud.


>>If you can't or won't make a starter, just rehydrate a couple or three 
>>packs of Nottingham dry yeast. Just as all-grain beers aren't
>>necessarily  better than extract beers, liquid yeast, improperly handled

Conversely, just as extract beers aren?t necessarily any worse than all
grain beers,  pitching a less than optimum cell count in your starter isn?t
necessarily any worse than pitching the optimum amount - If it works for
you.

Subject: The Perfect Airlock


     Hi all,
     
     The simplest, most effective airlock I can imagine for homebrewing 
     fermenters would be of a design similar to the pressure relief valves 
     on cheap(er) pressure cookers.
     
     A small weight perched on a vent.  When the pressure is high enough to 
     lift the weight, it is vented.  Otherwise the weight remains on the 
     vent, sealing it from outsiders (O2 and bugs alike).  The mass of the 
     weight determines the maximum pressure.  Heck, it could even be set so 
     that your beer would carbonate.
     
     I should patent this thing and market it, shouldn't I?  Nah, I doubt 
     that it would differ enough from the version on pressure cookers to be 
     patentable...

No they are not!  "LP" is an abreviation for "liquified *propane*"
gas. Propane is C3H8.


Natural gas is exactly that, it is hydrocarbon gas from underground.  
It's chemical makeup varies somewhat, but it is primarily methane
(CH4), some ethane (C2H6), and very small percentage of propane 
and higher molecular weight gasses.

Converting a gas burner from one fuel to another requires re-porting.
This is because different gasses burn best at different fuel/air mixtures.


In basic principle, a gas burner consists of five parts.


1. Gas Source
2. Pressure regulator
3. Gas port
4. Air Intake
5. Burner

               2         3  4


The ratio between the size of the gas port and the air 
intake/burner construction is what determines the air/fuel mixture.
For a given burner setup, the bigger the gas port (represented as "}" 
in my lousy diagram, the richer the fuel/air mixture. I believe that 
methane (natural gas) requires a larger port than propane. Your local 
heating supply place (or someone else on this list) may be able to 
tell you how much larger. For some commercial burners (e.g., stoves
and hot water heaters) you can buy propane or natural gas ports. 
For Cajun Kookers and other cheap burners, I have heard of people
re-porting them with a power drill and properly sized drill bit.


:>Also -- does the
:>cost of converting a (paid for) LP cooker end up being more than buying
:>a natural gas cooker?  Where does one find natural gas cookers of this
:>type.
:
:The major problem with converting a cooker such as this or finding a

:Neither has any means of shutting down the gas flow if the main burner

:would dump 100 cubic feet per minute.  Find a burner that will shut down
:the gas valve if the flame goes out if you're planning on brewing
:indoors.


At the risk of revisiting the "propane indoors" tirades,
This is true. The fire/explosion hazard of natural gas is less than 
that of propane, because propane is heavier than air (wants to head 
for your basement) while methane is lighter than air (wants to head 
for your attic and out). However, either one can pose a significant 
hazard if you do not know what you are doing or if you do not pay 
attention. Also, gas burners designed for outdoor use may generate 
substantial amounts of CO2 and or carbon monoxide, neither of which 
you want building up in your house.


If you do go ahead and install such a device indoors, either study up 
on it *a lot* or get help from someone who you are confident knows 
what he/she is doing. Make sure you consider potential leaks and 
provide adequate ventilation for combustion gasses.  My suggestion is, 
if this sounds like too much work, stick with slower cooking or work 
outside.

     Steve Alexander asks about reducing O2 diffusion through an airlock 
     when beer is kept for long periods under an airlock after visible 
     fermentation is complete.  Maybe Dave Whitman's suggestion of a 
     barrier bladder is the best alternative.  I'm not sure how permeable 
     ballons (rubber or mylar) are to O2.  But since there will be little 
     or no CO2 production, a small balloon would work.  Leakage around the 
     fittings should be no more than would occur with a conventional 
     airlock.  Any CO2 that is actually produced will simply expand the 
     balloon.  The balloon could even be purged with a shot of CO2 
     immediately prior to placement.  Replace your airlock with a stopper 
     fitted with a piece of tubing.  Before inserting the tubing, poke a 
     balloon through it so that the lip of the ballon can be folded up 
     around the outside of the tubing.  I'm not promising you won't tear a 
     ballon or two trying to put it together with a tight seal.  Let's see 
     how good my ascii art is...
