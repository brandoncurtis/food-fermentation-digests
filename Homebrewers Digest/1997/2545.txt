I posed a similar question to the collective about a year ago, so if you
have the time, check the HBD archives.  I created a Coffee Porter based on
my "research," and it turned out real well (I'd be happy to share the
recipe if anyone is interested).  Basically though, I added coffee grains
(in a steeping bag) to the wort after the boil (at 200F), and allowed it to
steep for about 15 minutes, keeping the temperature above 180F.  I'm not
sure how well adding coffee to the beer AFTER fermentation will work,
although I did get one suggestion to actually pour some in your glass
before adding your beer.  I would say if you add the brewed coffee before
bottling, just be sure it has had adequate pasteurization, and be careful
it hasn't had any chance for infection.  Cool the brewed coffee as you
would wort.  Good luck!

Subject: Wort caramelization?




Greetings all,  I have been reading the HB Digest for a few years on and off,
and I'm usually in lurker mode, but after all the inspiration this forum
provides,
I've decided to change from 20 years of extract brewing to "all grain".


Now the reason for breaking the silence:  The only thing holding me back from 
going all grain is having to boil the wort.  This has been a problem for me in
the past.  Any time I have boiled a wort from extract I always end up with a 
bitter/sweet taste which I attribute to caramelization. It is not overpowering
but it is strong enough to cause me to throw a few batches out.  I have been 
boiling 4 pounds of extract in 2.5 gallons of water, then topping up to 5
gallons.
I tried everything from changing; fermentation temps., changing yeast types,
different hops, eliminating dextrose, and using different kits, always with the 
same result.  When I eliminate the boil & dry hop, I eliminate the
bitter/sweet taste. 
 I currently use an old enamel canning pot in good shape on my electric stove. 
 Here are my questions:


1.Could I be scorching the wort because of the heat or because the pot is to
thin.?


2. Should I use a heavier pot?  


3. Could it be because the wort is to concentrated?


4. should I go for a gentle boil?


5.Should I use a propane burner?


6. Do any of you have caramelization problems?


I don't think it is my proceedures as  I have read alot of the books. 
If it's not caramelization what could it be?


Any help or experience would be greatly appreciated.

I've done this and used any regular beer or wine yeast (didn't matter).
You've got to add plenty of yeast though. I used some soda extracts (check
your homebrew store) and they had guidelines for how much yeast to add per
gallon of soda. Basically, I think that since their is no nutrients in the
mixture, only sucrose, the medium doesn't really support significant yeast
growth, only enough to get a good carbonation. Bottling in 2L bottles helps
because you can monitor the firmness of the bottle and vent a little if
you're inclined to worry. I've done it just as the recipes (on the extract
bottles) suggested and bottled in glass and had no problems.


Dennis asked about sparging:


>With the exception of getting more of the sugars present in the mash,

Well, none that I can think. Course you'll have to dilute those first
runnings to get your gravity down. More of a matter of thrift. Brewers have
always tended to be frugal and sparging was a way to maximize sugar
extraction without deleterious effects (such as oversparging will cause).
>
>Or if spending a few extra dollars for a few extra pounds of grain is

Yeah, and many brewers do just this when making high gravity beers. Using
extra grain to get the  S.G. of the first runnings up and blowing off
sparging altogether. Course the thrifty folks like myself are thinking
"hmmm, bet I could make a great mild with the second runnings...."

Both natural gas and the fart are methane.  Not at all clear though.

Methane requires a larger orifice.  It has a delivery pressure of about
7" WC while propane is about 11" WC.  You're right about the stove but
there is a heck of a difference in magnitude.  A range burner is about
7,000 btu while your King Kooker type may be up around 170,000 btu.  So
one minute of a no flame situation with the King Kooker is equal to
about 25 minutes of the range.  Now let's say you're away for maybe 2 or
3 minutes.  If letting your kitchen stove spew unburnt gas for an hour
or so doesn't bother then go right ahead.  :)

Sorry, this is simply wrong.  Natural Gas (NG) is methane and/or 
ethane.  LP gas (LPG) is propane and/or butane.  NG is lighter than 
air, LPG is heavier than air.  NG cannot be compressed into a liquid in 
an LPG tank at ambient temparature (as LPG can).  Burning 
characteristics (upper and lower limits of flammability; energy of 
combustion) are totally different for these gases.  Don not confuse the 
two.  They are not interchangeable, let alone the same.

What about a NG (or even LPG) stovetop ?  Not all of these have 
flame-failure devices.  It is generally accepted that LPG should not be 
used in places where it can "pool" (being heavier than air), and then 
ignite when an ignition source becomes available.  eg.  basements and 
confined spaces with poor ventilation.


<snip>

Not that important, really.  If you're brewing you will be standing 
next to your brewpot most of the time.  Therefore the brewer acts as 
flame-failure device.


Sorry for wasting HBD-space with info that most people probably know - 
but there may be someone out there who would have taken this as truth !

Distilled water should indeed measure 1.000 if it's at the correct
temperature (in my hydrometer 20 C, in most others 16)
The problem with your reasoning is that you are assuming that a 1 litre
solution of 50g of salt on water should have a gravity of 1.050, and that is
wrong. If you added 50g of salt to 1 litre of water, and the VOLUME didn't
change, ie. it was still 1 litre, then you would have a solution of gravity
1.050. However the problem lies in the fact that on adding the 50g of salt,
some of the water is displaced. This is the reason why you add the solute
first, then the solvent up to the mark. This volume of displaced water, in
your case, I would bet would weigh close to 15g, which would make up for the
missing gravity.
You see, a solution of gravity 1.050 is one that weighs 1.050 grams per
litre. As the salt added takes up volume, your 1 litre of solution will not
in fact weigh 1.050 grams, because it does not include BOTH 1 litre of water
AND 50 grams of salt. 
Hence the difference. I'd tend to trust hydrometers more than that. I think
small variations within hydrometers are unavoidable, but your big difference
is explainable in other terms.
Hope it helps/

        This has not been my experience, though it was my intent when I made the
4th batch of Big 12 Barleywine. (No, it didn't go down the drain!)
        Being not quite the bright spark that I thought I was, my attempt to
improve the B-W, or at least engage in experimentation, proved
disappointing.
        This  was the one I hit with the champagne yeast first, then the ale
yeast.....turned out to be a respectable Strong Ale , but I had to do a lot
of tweaking to get the gravity down, it stopped at 14 Plato. To get the ale
yeast going and finish it off required a new pitch of ale yeast, with a
dose of O2, and that never really got going strong, just trickled
along....Then I hit it with 2 batches of ale yeast, that had been going
through lag phase for 8 or 9 hours in 5 gallons of wort, a new dose of O2,
and then it took off again like a champ. I called it "If It Ain't Broke,
Don't Fix It" Ale, which was changed later to "Flint Hills Strong Ale.'
Almost Belgian Strong Ale in characteristics, I had it entered for this
year GABF for Strong Ales.
        I spoke with Gordon Specht and Clayton Cone of Lallemand about this
situation, and Mr. Cone was the one who informed me that the champagne
yeast, EC-1118, was not able to eat all the various sugars that the ale
yeast could, and while it was able to eat a few of the sugars that the ale
yeast couldn't, at the end of ale yeast fermentation, and thus 'polish' (my
un-scientific terminology) the B-W off, it was unsuitable for my intended
purpose.
        I have heard of brewers, anecdotally, that have used wine yeasts to
ferment out B-W's, but have never met one personally, and while I can't
state that it won't work, I know it didn't for me.

I didn't mean that propane and natural gas were the same although it

Subject: filter size


A couple days ago, Ian Smith asked about the best micron size for filtering.
 This question has come up in the past here and on RCB, but I have refrained
from responding, even though I've been using filters for several years (and
even though I often didn't agree with others' responses to the question).
 The simple reason is that I was busy muddling through just about every
mistake you can make with a filter and didn't feel I had enough data to give
a satisfactory answer.  


However, my years of muddling have finally paid off.  After using every type
and micron size of cartridge filter readily available to homebrewers, in my
opinion the unit to use is the 5 micron absolute rated pleated polypropelene
10" cartridge filter.  It offers the best compromise between clarity,
longevity and body/flavor/color retention.  


The 1 micron and 0.5 micron absolute rated pleated filters will get your beer
brilliantly clear but will strip an unacceptable amount of body and flavor
from all but the lightest beers.  Also, because they take more out of your
beer than the 5 micron, they will wear out faster (i.e., clog and become
generally useless even after backflushing), which is an important
consideration given that they cost about 35 bucks.


The spun polypropelene and spun cotton filters that are commonly available at
hardware stores are, at  best, about 70 percent efficient at their stated
micron rating (compared to 95 plus percent for the pleated filters).  For
that reason, they are really not that useful for filtering anything but
stouts (where you won't be able to tell that the beer is still cloudy!).
 They are also less cleanable than the pleated filters.


In my opinion, the only worthwhile use for a filter in homebrewing is to
speed the removal of yeast from finished beer.  The 5 micron absolute rated
pleated polypro does that.  If you still have haze problems after using the 5
micron, you will be better served to look to other parts of your beer making
process (e.g., mash schedule, malt selection, sanitation ....) than to move
to a finer filter.


Two final quick notes:  1) ALWAYS flush all O2 from the filter housing before
filtering; and 2) NEVER soak a polypro filter in bleach, because the polypro
will permanently swell and leave you with 35 bucks worth of useless junk
(e-mail me if you need detailed info on use and cleaning of a cartridge
filter - this is another area where I've muddled through every possible
mistake).

In HBD#2543, Alan McKay worries about freezing his propane tank if stored
outdoors at temperatures as low as -35C.


According to CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, you don't need to worry
about freezing the propane, although you're coming very close to liquifying
it.  The melting point is -190C, boiling point is -41C.


The pressure in the tank will go down dramatically as you cool it, which
might make it hard to get a good flame on your burner.

While my recent batch of "Thames River Bitter" was fermenting,
the Irish moss did a very good job of clarifying the beer
and creating a thick trub. So good, in fact, that I yielded to
the temptation to rack my 5-gallon batch not once, but
twice, before bottling.  I was careful while siphoning to
avoid splashes and bubbles. Still, just a few days after 
bottling, each bottle has a healthy sediment.
Is it necessary to rack more than once?

     Hi all,
     
     Greg is confused about HSA (hot side aeration).  He cries out for help 
     from Obi-Wan (but will accept it from Al or George).
     
     Did you mean me, or George Fix?  You must be specific...
     
     The reason you need not worry about aerating hot sparge water is that 
     oxygen will not stay in solution for long in 170F (77C) water.
     
     "But wait!" you may say.  "Then why must I worry about it during the 
     boil?  Surely the oxygen isn't going to stay in boiling wort."
     
     You need to avoid aerating hot wort because the oxygen will oxidize 
     wort material very quickly.  It need not stay in solution long to do 
     its damage.
     
     Sparge water, on the other hand, has nothing of consequence in it to 
     oxidize, so you need not be as careful.  By the time the water makes 
     its way to the oxidizable wort, it will have lost its gaseous 
     components.
     
     Have fun!

I want to brew an E.S.B. using wyeast 1968(London ESB)


Most of the info I've seen on this yeast states that it needs aeration
and agitation during fermentation in order to perform well. Does the
following sound correct?
        1) I O2 for ten minutes at low pressure before pitching, and then O2
for 1 minute every hour until airlock activity peaks? I hoping that
remaining CO2 scrubs out remaining O2.
        2)As far as agitation goes, can I just swirl fermenting bucket around
or do I need to pop lid and stir it with a spoon every hour(sanatation
headach)


P.S. As far as this Stein beir thread is concerned, I thought JOKINGLY
to myself; why not dump extract and let it carmelize on the bottom of
the boiling kettle, then ferment in the same kettle? This would save
building the wooden vessel, collecting tons of exploding rocks,
removeing the roof so that the crane can get into the kitchen, etc.

Thanks to all who sent me their opinions a while back concerning
my siphoning problems.  I've just finished brewing a Honey Wheat and I
must say for the first time in a long time I didn't have any problems
getting all of the wort from the brewpot to the carboy.


By far the most suggested answer was to drill more holes in my copper loop.
Someone also suggested using the SS braid from a reinforced washing
machine hose.  I did both.  I used to have to start my boil with about 7
gallons and that would usually give be not much more that 4.5 gallons in
the carboy, not today.  I got 5.5 gallons.  Looks like I'll need to adjust
the volume of wort at the beginning of the boil.  I was left with just a
big pile of hops at the bottom of the brew pot (not even one little hop
leaf made it to the fermentor, as far as I can tell).  A substantial amount
of break material was also left behind in the brew pot.

Seems to me that the two most difficult things to achieve
with extract beers are
1) very pale beers and
2) malty beers or beers with a lot of body.


The challenge for extract brewers is knowing their malts.
With experience, I'm sure you can pick and choose the
right malts to get the beer you want.  That's what sets
an advanced brewer apart from a beginning brewer.


And that's essentially what Pat Babcock wrote.

got the book from Brewer's Resource (800) 827-3983.  It is also available

The book has several interesting recipes I plan to try and is well written,

I haven't tried the Murphy's recipe yet but tried their recipe for Guinness
from Brew Your Own Real Ale At Home and like it a lot.  It is not really
like Guinness but an excellent stout nonetheless.  They say in the book that
exact duplication of any commercial beer is unlikely.  I have certainly
found that to be the case with all the attempts I have made with various beers.
I have never managed to duplicate a commercial beer but have brewed a lot of
beers I like, some better than the originals (in my opinion).

Subject: HSA


Greg asks about aeration in the mash.


I believe that HSA *is* a real concern regarding the mash.  Check those
archives for HSA and Scandrett or "Scandrett and mash and aeration."
Charlie posted in 1996 or 1997 that aeration during the mash could
very well be *much worse* than aeration of even hot wort.


Older breweries indeed introduce quite a bit of HSA and their beer
suffers for it.  Modern German breweres are designed to be virtually
oxygen-free until the wort is cooled.  This comes from George Fix's
posts.  I believe that some breweries even go so far as to deaerate
the strike and sparge water!


I do believe that sprinkling hot sparge water is not nearly as bad as
it may look in a commercial brewery... recall that the mash is
steaming quite a bit and the sparge water is too.  If you keep
the doors closed on the laeuter tun, much of the oxygen will be
purged from the tun by the steam.  This is the same reason that vigorous
boils don't result in aeration.


So, the bottom line is that you should indeed try to minimize aeration
of the mash.

Bob posted a Belgian White recipe that worked for him.  It included
1# of wheat malt, 1# of carapils and the orange peel was identified as
"Navel Orange."


His procedures:
>Put the grains in 3 qts water, bring to a boil, and steep for one hour.


The beer was cloudy, right?  The "real thing" is cloudy too, but it's
from proteins. What we have here is starch haze and it can lead to bigger
problems.  Since the grains were boiled, the enzymes in the wheat were
denatured and the starch extracted could not be convered to sugars.

This is a recipe for hot-side aeration.  It will result in premature  
staling and a sherrylike aroma.  At first, before I had a wort chiller,
I used to put sanitary ice cubes (froze some pre-boiled water) directly
into my boiling wort in the kettle.  The improvement in my beer (over
pouring hot wort into cold water) was amazing.  I built a wort chiller
the very next week.


>Bring volume to 5 gals.  Corriander and orange peel are left in the wort
>during primary fermentation.  Pitched yeast `at` 70 F.


Speaking of which, the oranges used in real Wits are "Belgian Sweet
Orange" and "Curacao Orange."  Neither of these are anything like
"Navel Oranges," which, as a matter of fact, will give your beer a
"hamlike" aroma.


Finally, although this would not be possible without at least a partial
mash, Wits are actually brewed with *unmalted* barley, which is said
to give a "different flavour" (Pierre Celis' words, not mine) than
malted wheat.  It's also partly why Witbiers are cloudy -- it's all the
proteins from the unmalted wheat.


Bob's beer may have been delicious, but I just wanted to point out that
it was different from traditional Witbier recipes in more than just
the brown sugar and original gravity.

Alan,
I doubt it.  I keep mine on my BBQ grill out all winter and use it often.
Remote homes use big tanks of propane for heating and cooking with little
problems.  OK, occassionally the valve might freeze up from condensation
but the freezing point of propane gas itself is -189.7C (-309.4F) that is
just above that of liquid nitrogen at -196C (CRC Handbook of Chemistry and
Physics).

    I wouldn't worry about it. The tanks will not freeze and
burst on you. But I definately wouldn't store them inside
under any conditions. If the tank leaked, you may not notice
it before your home (or garage) became matchwood.
    While it normally doesn't get that cold here (lowest
maybe -35 at WORST), we have actually used the BBQ during
some rather terrible weather to smoke a turkey for
Thanksgiving or ham for Xmas. The cold weather doesn't seem
to bother the propane to any extent we can notice.
    If you want to keep them out of the weather, anything to
keep the snow and junk off will do just fine outside. Pop
them in a garbage bag and tie it shut well. They'll be just
fine.

Subject: Re: Instructional videotapes


Paul A. Baker asked about instructional videotapes on
brewing. I found one in the Lake Superior Brewing Co.
catalog. Order # CV100 at $49.95. Phone 1-800-345-CORK. The
VERY brief reference states "Video guide on home brewing"
and thats it. I do not have the video, so have no idea how
helpful it would be.
    Though I have no connection with this company beyond
being a customer, I've had good service from them and will
not hesitate to order from them again.
    They also have a CYBEER CD-ROM which boasts a video
presentation of home brewing and recipes. 486/33, WIN95, 8
meg ram, 2x or faster CD-ROM drive and 10 meg hard drive
space required. Order # CV-200 at $29.95.
    Might check with the local library to see if they have
anything, not to mention the local brew club. Perhaps they
shot an instructional video for new members (not a bad idea
folks). Actually a brew club shooting such a video might be
a real boon to new brewers and if you can provide even
minimal editing, you may have a marketable product! At the
very least it can be a loaner for newbies in the group.

    Personally, I suspect the "beer snobs" label probably
spread from a drunken party where someone actually had the
guts to ask if they had any imports available instead of
just laying down under the pony keg to catch the overflow
before it hit the floor.
