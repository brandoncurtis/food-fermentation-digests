Subject: Pumps for moving wort - Summary


Greetings!
        Last week I asked about pumps for wort transfer and got several
replies;  here's the bottom line.  No affiliation, I'm not responsible for
anything you do, etc., etc., etc.


Sources for pumps include:
        Almost any lab supply company (i.e. Cole Parmer, VWR, etc.)
        United States Plastic (1-800-537-9724)
        Grainger (www.grainger.com)
        "Moving brews"  (www.ays.net/movingbrews/)


Small March pumps are advertised in US Plastics for around $100 with all
stainless steel parts; anything in the world is available from Grainger.
One precaution is that you have to know materials to make sure what you
want is acceptable for food usage.


Lab supply companies are generally more expensive than other sources,
people off the street sometimes are not able to make purchases from them.
Their pumps are often more specialized, so there are fewer of the type you
would actually be interested in.


A few members of the collective spoke very highly of Moving Brews, run by
Bill Stewart.  His prices are quite competitive and he also carries many
fittings to go from the pump to tubing or any other material.  This might
save you a trip somewhere.


ONE ISSUE WHERE THERE IS DISAGREEMENT (sorry to shout, but you might have
dozed off) is whether the pump should be attached straight out of the
kettle or after the chiller.  Advantage of before the chiller is ease of
sanitization (oops, almost said sterilization and I would have been berated
for that).  The other school of thought is that drawing a vacuum on the hot
wort could cause it to vaporize.  Any strong opinions here?


That's the rap.


Dave
P.S.  How about keeping the discussion civil, even if you disagree, ok?  At
the very least, try some decaf!  We're not impressed by degrees in science,
the arts, or anything else, even if we have them ourselves.

Hi Paul,


In HBD#2554 you posted:


 ...
>Now I've heard of beers having a vegetative presence, but doesn't 
>that usually refer to the cooked corn or cabbage aromas of

 ....


In my experience, some hops can also produce a definate vegetative 
prescence, especially when lots of whole hops are used.  My most 
memorable example was an IPA that I used 10 ounces of Styrian 
Goldings in for a five gallon batch.  Not only was that batch 
*very* bitter (big surprise) it also had a very distinct vegetative 
aroma.  It is my opinion that this came from the hops.  


While I don't have my copy here at work, Ray Daniels talks about this 
in his new book Designing Great Beers (awesome book BTW, no 
affiliation etc) in his chapters on hops.  Sorry I can't provide a 
more specific reference.....

Subject: rescusitating beer (Not flushing)


Greetings All,


I find myself with a somewhat flat almost Lemon Wheat ale.  Sigh.
Not wanting to just dump it (My Scottish heritage, not just Eric F's post), I 
was thinking of dumping it back in the carboy, adding a couple of gallons of 
fresh wort/yeast, and rebottling it a week or so.


Questions
1) Should I mix it all together, or let the fresh wort and yeast make friendly 
first?
2) Should I go with a high gravity wort, or something close to what I had 
before?


TIA

Subject: simple sparging tip


There are various methods of pouring the hot water onto the grain during
the sparge process.


My rule it to keep all of my brewing processes it as simple as possible,
unless the simplification makes my beer bad.  (It's the KISS rule--"Keep
It Simple, Stupid") So, instead of some intricate rotating sprinkling
mechanism, I've been just holding a soup ladle level with the top of the
liquid in the lauter tun and pouring the water into the ladle.


Last time I brewed, an interested friend was helping out, and suggested
just floating a tupperware lid on the grain!  I just poured the water
onto the lid and it kept the grain from being disturbed.  It worked like a
champ, and freed up a hand!

Subject: Meat Ale II, Son of Meat


The other day I posted concerning some wierd aroma/flavor notes I had
picked up in a couple of batches.  Of primary concern was a meaty
aroma in a batch I recently brewed.  


Raymond Estrella and George De Piro (thanks guys) both mentioned 
methional as the probable culprit.  Raymond called it a methional 
infection while George referred to it as methional production from a 
possible too cool ferment.  Since this batch also apparently killed my 
yeast (or at least scared them into hiding), I'd say that the temperature may
be a real factor (it does get a little chilly here in Vermont at this
time of year).  At least I can assume my new wort chiller is up to
snuff.  Raymond stated he wouldn't drink the beer, I'm not
sure I'm willing to go that far, I can get used to just about
anything.  The question is, how sick will it make me?


The strange thing is that I pitched a second batch of the same recipe
on the yeast cake in the primary (before I knew about the beefed up
beer profile).  I tried the first bottle of this second batch last
night,...and it was perfect, no off taste at all.


Looks like we have a new foe to fight - methional!

Subject: Wyeast Lager strains and higher fermentation temps


It looks like my cellar temperature will drop to about 56-58F over the
winter.  Wyeast lists the following fermentation ranges:


2124 Bohemian                46-54 F
2206 Bavarian                48-58 F
2278 Czech Pils                48-68 F
2308 Munich                48-56 F


Note: the *optimum* temperatures are listed as 48-50 F.


In light of the recent post by Jeff Renner citing some examples of
lager ferments of 58 and 60 F, I've been contemplating doing a
series of lagers (by repitching one initial package of Wyeast).


First off, Jeff, any new info to share on this topic?  


Secondly,  I'll probably make a Czech Pils, a Vienna or Marzen 
and a Dunkel (maybe a Helles Bock instead).  Which of the above
yeasts would be recommended for this list of brews?  Any hope of
one strain being a good choice for all of these.  BTW, I've used the 
California strain (2112) - I'd like to go with a more traditional type 
yeast this time.


cheers,

Absolutely! However, these are the *solvents* in the enamel. They
evaporate.  That's what makes the paint smell bad.  Certainly, these
would not survive a few boils.  What could be of concern are the 
*pigments* and *fixing agents*.

I am the newest of newbies - in fact I'm a brewing virgin, so to speak.
However - I've been lurking for some months now trying to absorb as much
info as possible before I take the next step. Most of you scientists are
way out of my league, but I'd rather learn from experts than poison
myself!


Al brings up a point of interest for me re: the yeast in bottles,
particularly Hefe-Weizen. I can not get a definitive answer whether the
yeast in the bottle is simply for conditioning, or whether it can be
used to make a *terrific* wheat beer using authentic German yeast. That
would be my ideal first brew - a medium bodied, cloudy and estery
(phenolic?) banana- and clove-tasting wheat beer!


Any advice is appreciated!

Subject: Airlock - deadend.


As I previously posted, I poured a light colored lager from a keg and
left it on my kitchen counter for ~15 hours and found that it had
darkened somewhat. After an additional 24 hours the difference was
substantially greater. Slightly moreso at 2.5 days.




Abridged version
Several readers suggest that light may be a culprit here.


Someone suggested that the beer became more dense, and so darker as the
carbonation was removed.  Sorry - the density change is microscopic, and
actually the beer should become less dense.


My personal pet theory was that there is an oxidation reaction and
polymerization of phenolics occurred.


I guess I am satisfied that the standard airlock is not at fault, but I
am no closer to identifying the actual cause or mechanism of this
particular darkening.


thanks to the many respondents on this topic,
Steve Alexander


*********************
As i recall you said that the the beer was poured into two glasses  one of
which was left out for a few days. couldn't it have gotten infected and
thereby changed color? A way you could test both this and the light theory is
to go by a 6 - pack of IBC cream soda which comes in clear bottles and has
pop top lids




I also have 2 questions of my own why does buttwiper (budweiser) only last
for 110 days? and what is a cornelius keg

 Hello to all, Charles discusses the pros/cons of the Oxy-nator,
>They want you to be able to get 15-20 batches out of that little 
bottle so you don't feel ripped off........
>A 50# tank for our brewery costs $25.  You may be able to get 
a 5# tank for a lot cheaper than that little oxygenator that they sell.
<snip> The only thing I like is the stainless steel diffuser that you 
get with them.


  I will add to his comments. The disposable oxygen cylinder that
comes with the kits contains one cu ft of oxygen.  They cost about 
$12 to replace from your favorite HB shop, and around $8 at a
discount building supply store.  As Charles says he gets his 50 lb
tank filled for $25, I get my 20 lb tank filled for $12.  Quite a price 
difference.  But......
  To use a bulk tank like we have you must also have an oxygen
regulator.  They will run you around $120-140 new, or you can
sometimes find one rebuilt in the $60-75 range. You can find 
sintered steel diffusion stones at home-brew shops also. I use a 
2 micron stone called the Carbonator, and there are other brands 
as well. I gave a talk about aeration and Oxygen use for our club,
and my recommendation was to go with the Oxy-nator if you brew
5-10 batches a year, but if you are brewing 10+ a year, or are 
making 20 gallons at a time, you may want to look into a refillable
set-up.
  Hope that this helps,

  I am not sure that I agree with this.  My understanding, and current
practice is to streak a plate so as to isolate a single cell of yeast.  then
to take a well formed (round) and well separated colony and use it to 
streak a slant.  After growing up the slant I work from it, not the plate.
(In fact at this point I discard the plate.)  It is a lot easier to avoid
contamination working from a slant as there is less area exposed each
time that you open it.  Have I been going about this wrong for the past
few years?

I am preparing to brew my first Belgian triple, and I would like some
advice on what yeast to use. I have cultured yeast from both a bottle of La
Trappe (Holland) and from a bottle of La fin du mond (Canadian) Both of
these triples have the friuty, estery flavor profile I am looking for.
Has anyone brewed with  these yeasts? I am aware that the yeast used for
bottle conditioning may not be the yeast used in the primary fermentation. 
        Also, I have been considering just breaking down and using one of the
belgian strains from wyeast (Either Belgian ale (1214) or Belgian Abby II
(1762)) Can anyone give me an idea as to which strain gives a better flavor
profile.

To this I disagree strongly. My beer quality got much better after I 
started chilling with a counterflow chiller. One of the reasons is 
that chilling helps forming more cold break which helps the yeasties 
grow. 
Also, why would the commercial guys and the micro-breweries 
force chill their wort ?  
The answer is simple, it makes better beer.

Cascade has a more "piney" flavor/aroma. The "grapefruit" flavor that you
are getting is from the Chinook hops. They are well known for having this
particular flavor.

Most likely, that is yeast, not additional break material. Even shortly
after pitching, yeast will drop to the bottom  of the fermentor (especially
lager yeast, hence the term "bottom fermenting"). RDWHAHB.  ;-)

>At this point I decided to just let the ferment proceed as is.


I first tried racking off the cold trub in a Bohemian Pilsener I had been
trying to brew to my personal standard of quality (very high). It never
tasted quite right (good not great) until a batch where I racked off the
cold trub. Here's how I now brew all my lagers: I pitch my yeast, keep the
cooled the wort at 50F for ~8 hours, then very gently rack off the trub
into another carboy. I always get another layer of something on the bottom
of the carboy after 12 hours which is usually when fermentation activity is
starting. Another layer of cold break? I don't know, but I'm going to stick
with the process because it seems to make a difference in the final beer.


The trick as far as I can tell is to rack off the trub before the yeast
kicks in (past the respiration phase). 8-10 hours is about right for me. If
one waits to pitch the yeast until *after* racking off the trub then timing
is not as big an issue. I pitch my yeast first because I'm nervous about
infection and want that yeast working ASAP.

I don't think stirring has anything to do with it.  I think you added 
more O2 than perhaps you should have.

Less O2. :)  One 30 second blast is probably quite sufficient.  In 
Ray Daniels' book Designing Great Beers he points out that despite 
yeasts known requirement for O2, many homebrews make fabulous beer 
with minimal aeration....Based on my own experience it is possible to 
over oxygenate the wort, perhaps not technically, but from a 
practical point of view.  If your lag time is 24 hours and your yeast 
were in good shape, cut back on the O2 until you get what you 
consider to be acceptable lag times.

Subject: Re:  Neoclassical styles


     Hi all,
     
     Dave talks about expanding the current competition styles to include 
     all sorts of interesting historical beers.  The subject of expanding 
     competition styles has been brought up several times recently, so I'll 
     add my .02.
     
     In my opinion, the style categories are pretty representative of what 
     is out there.  Odd beers, like a "historical porter" can be entered as 
     a specialty beer.  You would call it "Classic-style specialty, robust 
     porter with Brettanomyces, etc."
     
     The key is to write down as much info as you can about the things that 
     make your beer "special," and make sure that they are noticeable in 
     the brew.  The specialty category is a fair "catch all."  You have to 
     be lucky enough to get judges that know what they are doing in order 
     to get a decent evaluation, but that is no different from any other 
     category!  
     
     A big problem with expanding the style categories excessively is that 
     a competition will be broken into so many little parts that there will 
     be too few entries to fill a category (with the exception of stouts 
     and porters).  The categories would then be collapsed and your 
     historical porter would be competing against a spiced Christmas ale, 
     just as if it had been entered as a specialty beer!  The new category 
     would thus become meaningless.  The odds of getting a knowledgeable 
     judge would remain unchanged, too.
     
     Also, Pre-Pro Pils (a.k.a., Classic American Pils) and American Amber 
     Ale are already style sub-categories.  Enough people brew/enter them 
     to justify them as sub-categories; they still compete against similar 
     beers, though, in their main category.  If a "unique" style is entered 
     into enough contests, then the "powers that be" will consider making a 
     new category/subcategory.  Otherwise, it's a specialty beer.
     
     As far as judges being able to be prepared for "intellectually 
     stimulating" entries, again I'll say it's a crap shoot.  If you get a 
     good judge, you'll get good feedback.  It is always useful to know 
     what style you will be judging in advance, but that isn't always 
     possible.  Some competitions are better organized than others, and a 
     large number of "no show" judges will alter even the best judge 
     coordinator's plans.
     
     Have fun!

Brewsters:


Thanks to Jason Henning for providing
stock numbers for the Clinitest Kit and Tablets.


I recommend that you get the kit first time
so your drop size will be calibrated to the test.
Also, buy additional tablets in the foil packets
as the tablets stored in bottles can absorb =


water from the air and go inoperative.


Thirdly, just in case you misread Jason's
comments and think this is a substitute
for a hydrometer for OG's (i.e at the beginning
of the fermentation) it isn't quite.


This test is the classic
Fehling's Solution test and it only works
on reducible sugars.  Sucrose (table sugar)
is not a reducible sugar, but all the other sugars
in which we are interested are.  So any sucrose
in a wort will not be detected.  In fact, this
makes a good way for you to see if those
malt extract manufacturers like John Bull
are adding sucrose.   =




After the fermentation when the yeast invertase
has converted the sucrose to reducible sugars =


and they have been fermented and are no problem
this test will be responsive to some dextrins
and non-fermentable sugars like lactose -
which is why you can get a response of =


about 1/4% in a beer that is completely =


fermented out.  This 1/4% BTW represents
about 0.32 ounces of sugar per gallon or =


much better than you can read with an
hydrometer. Especially one covered with
CO2 bubbles buoying it up!


Use the hydrometer before the fermentation
and the Clinitest afterwards, although I do
suggest you try Clinitest before =


to compare the tests with your various worts
just to get an estimate of the sucrose content
of the wort by comparison with your hydrometer.  =




Why use the Clinitest Kit at all? To avoid the
errors from CO2 bubbles in getting an FG.
So you will know whether or not you have =


a stuck fermentation and what the sugar content
is in the beer when you prime it for bottling.
- --------------------------------------------------------
Chris's FWH ( first wort hopping) comments
and question reminded me of a thought
I had some time ago, but didn't get a chance
 to explore it here.


I think that FWH works because the
boiling point of the concentrated wort is
higher than what the hops normally see
in a full wort boil and the resins are softer
at this temperature and come out of the
hops sooner in rolling boil. =




Counter argument is the efficiency of hop
extraction with extract at less than
full volume boil is lower.


However, what if you started with an extract =


at high concentration, added hops, =


boiled it for, say, 30 minutes and then
diluted with boiling water and boiled some more?


Any thoughts on that?

Well, I always thought that an SG of 1.020
for a starter was to minimize the petite body
formation possibility.  Maybe it is both.
Any rationale/evidence for this, at least to me,
new information? I always thought that
CO2 /ethanol was *always* a by-product
with S. Cerevisiae which are anti-Pasteur =


in their behavior towards sugar content
down to very low sugar levels.
S. Cerevisiae is not your common =


garden yeast and what you learned at pointy-head
school about most yeasts may not always
apply here. OTOH, I do seem to recall that
in the growing of yeasts for bread making
(also a S.Cerevisiae) they do keep the =


Sg low and continuously oxygenate the slurry,
so I could be convinced..


> feeding them 1 pint per day
>until the day before brew day when they

So an Sg of about 1.020 in your feeder
solution and less than 1.010 in your starter
and it will get more and more dilute
as you go through the process. Seems
very low to me and not providing much =


sugar and nutrients to the yeast


> I hate dumping off the liquid before

If it is an Ale yeast and most lager yeasts,
just put the starter in the refrigerator overnight
and you can pour off most of the liquid =


before you pitch. Especially if your last sugar
addition is 24 hours before you pitch


> I think the lazy (or dead) ones are

Not true, especially for lager yeasts
and in your case of low Sg. Depending
on the yeast strain they begin to flocculate
as the Sg goes down. Thus, for example,
some Scottish Ale yeasts need constant
rousing to finish because they flocculate
at an abnormally high Sg and the beer =


would finish sweet otherwise. Lager yeasts
are flocculated at nearly all SGs

I think this is a good idea.
Add increasing amounts of wort to keep
the Sg around 1.020.  So if you start off
with a feeder wort of Sg of 1.1 and assume
that the yeast can consume about an
amount of wort of Sg of 1.020 in 12 hours,
then bumping the SG to about 1.020
every 12 hours is a reasonable approach. =

This is understandable, perhaps, since
the yeast deplete the small amount of sugar
you have been adding in your present
procedure before the water gets saturated
with CO2 and it happens so quickly you
may not be around.


Does anyone have any thoughts about
adding nutrients?  If the beer above =


the yeast can be discarded before pitching
it seems to me this could be a good idea
to use nutrients.

My Power Drill does an admirable job with
my two roll mill.  I use it as a direct drive, since
I built a key from a 3/8" bolt to fit the slot where
 the handle used to be.
This key goes into the chuck.
I also have a safety device.  If the drill hits
a piece of some non-malt substance =


( happened once in lots of batches) the
drill motor rolls over and pulls the plug.
When you hook up your motor do it through
some kind of shear pin or clutch device.

The taste testing you mention is really not adequate.  You'd have to do
side by side tests, e.g. two identical batches of each beer, brewed
together, pitched in the same way, fermented in the same way etc., but
with the only difference between the two being the lack of a chiller.
In addition, you seem to draw strong conclusions about the use of a
chiller, but ignore the fact that you radically changed your method of
pitching in a way that is known to work very well, and may be helping to
confound your results.  My conclusion is that you may be right about the
chiller, but you may also be wrong, and that your so-called test
procedure above confounds the results dramatically enough that it is not
possible to draw anything conclusive.  Maybe you could design a batch of
beer that is on the light side, so you could taste something like DMS in
it, then brew two identical batches side by side and only change the
method of chilling?  Then do a taste test and send your brews in for DMS
testing?
