  "Reverse engineering", that is.  I'd like to do an after-the-fact 
calculation of what my beer's vital stats might be and am looking for a 
program or spreadsheet that would help.  The beer's been in the secondary for 
about a week.  I've got good records of everything about it with the exception 
of SG readings.  I'm mostly interested in calculating % ETOH and a ballpark 
estimate of bitterness.


  I've owned a hydrometer for at least 10 years, but for some reason I never 
get around to using it.  Likewise, I've read volumes of "fascinating" hop 
utilization/calculation data on the HBD, but it unerringly ricochets off of 
my long-term memory.  I plan to inflict this brew on friends and family 
during the holidays and I'd like to be more specific than my standard: 
"it's got plenty of alcohol".  A direct reply is probably in order.
TIA, Steve

Subject: SG:Volume relationship


Hello, I am looking through some notes I have acquired regarding recipe
formulation.  I have one question:


Is there a straight line (1:1) correspondence between change in volume due
to boil and change in SG due to boiling?


For example,  a recipe began with 7 gallons of 1.041 wort, boiled down to
4.75 gallons (SG 1.055), then added 0.75 gallons make-up water to give 5.5
gallons with a final SG of 1.048. I will simplify the SG by using the
numbers to the right of the decimal point as integers, and abandon the
numerals to the left of the decimal point for the sake of discussion.


I can see that, in this case, the difference between 7 x 41 and 5.5 x 48 is
very close (-0.004 SG; 7 x 41 is 287; 287 / 5.5= 52.2 or 1.052 as opposed
to 1.048)


Is this a negligible difference? Does this relationship hold up across all
ranges of specific gravity?


I will summarize private emails and report back.

Lemme guess how the overly anal brew nazis will respond to this one
(tongue firmly in cheek mode):


MY GOD!  What have you done?  Don?t you know that every beer
reference I have read says that not cooling you wort will absolutely
make rotten beer every single time. Don't you know what DMS is (insert
long dissertation on DMS formation theory)?   It has been scientifically
proven beyond a doubt in every study (all two of them - Uh, my
references are around here somewhere. Yeah, that?s it, I don?t have
them with me right now but I am an expert in scientific research - so take
my word for it).  You should pour it all down the drain, immediately.  As
for you and your wife not noticing anything unusual, well obviously you
don?t know how to taste beer correctly.  I have degrees in chemistry,
engineering, law, philosophy, and I am a grade school art teacher.  I have
been brewing  for x years, I have been a certified beer judge to x years, 
I have a trained palette, and I always brew the best beer possible.  This
makes me the only person qualified to judge your beer (even though I
have never tasted it) and I can tell you from 1000 miles away - your beer
stinks.  Quit dispensing bad information to people on the HBD.  For we
cannot think for ourselves and you may cause somebody to brew a beer
that isn?t up to my personal standards. 


Score one for artful cooling rates!  


Brew on,

I  just motorized my Valley Mill last week.  I used  a 177 RPM GE gearmotor
ordered from the Surplus Center (800-488-3407) part # 5-1098 for about $26
+ shipping.  I believe it has 40 in.-lb. torque which is more than enough. 
I can mill 5 lbs. of grain in about 70 seconds and get a perfect crush. 
I'm thrilled!

From: "Rob Miller" <robm`at`alaska.net>
Subject: various questions


I have a few questions for the collective...


1.  Bottlecaps.  I typically sanitize mine with a 10 minute boil.  I have
never had problems with the seals coming loose.  My question is, if I use
"oxycaps", will boiling denature the oxygen-absorbing capability of these
caps?  Also, since yeast is an oxygen scavanger, are these caps worth the
extra money?


2.  Will someone please explain to me how I can put several pounds of cane
sugar in a soda pop recipe, pitch chamgane yeast in it, and not have
automatic bottle-bombs?  My dad used to make "homebrew" back in the 60s
with cane sugar, blue-ribbon malt, and Fleischman's baking yeast.  The
yeast definitely munched the sugar, and in more than priming quantities. 
Why don't soda bottles blow?  I have made lots of batches of beer and never
blown a bottle (knock on wood), nor had flat beer so I have reasonable
control of the process.  But I have made 4 batches of pop for my kids, used
the same amount of yeast in each, and had flat, normally carbonated,
gushers, and even a couple of bombs.  I am at a loss as to how to control
the process.  I don't have kegging equipment at present, so that's not an
option right now.


3.  I have a batch of all-grain barleywine in the fermenter (OG = 1.104)
which I pitched with Wyeast 1028 (London Ale yeast) in about a 1 quart
starter.  I have heard that this yeast is up to the job, but I am concerned
that it might crap out short of carbonating my bottles.  I can see three
ways to go:


a)  bottle as usual and don't worry--hope it carbonates (hate leaving this
to chance, though....


b)  add more yeast starter (perhaps of a more tolerant yeast such as Wyeast
Scotch Ale yeast) at priming time and hope that it is merely more
alcohol-tolerant and not able to ferment stuff the 1028 can't,


c)  add champagne yeast late in the secondary fermentation, let it feast
for a while until it is nearly done, then prime and bottle.


The obvious risk of a) is flat beer.  b) seems safer, but perhaps would
yield more sediment in the bottles.  My concern with c) would be
potentially changing the flavor-profile of the beer.  I used 1028 because
that's the flavor profile I wanted.  Or perhaps do c), only with the Scotch
Ale yeast?  Comments and suggestions?


Thank you for your help.

Subject: Brewing Flax?


Recently, I have been thinking about brewing with flax.  For those of you
that don't know what flax is, it's a small, dark, shiny grain.  Kind-of
looks like a bug if you ask me.  I have acquired a spec sheet from a company
that sells it and it says that the seed contains 43% oils (dry basis), 40%
protein and about 11% moisture.  It doesn't tell me about the amount of
starch, does anyone know?  Is there anything to convert?  Has anyone tried
brewing with flax as an adjunct?  Does it contribute anything?  Would the
oils destroy my head retention?  I can't seem to find any article about it
and believe me I've looked.  Thanks in advance to anyone who can answer
these questions.

Subject: Starters and Lactic Acid


Hello all.


Just having one of the members of my *excellent* first batch--an IPA that
will never see the four weeks in the bottle that is supposed to perfect it.
I have an observation and a couple of questions.


Concerning the starter thread, I brewed my second batch this past weekend
and decided to attempt to shorten the 24hr. lag I had in my first batch. I
popped the wyeast irish ale yeast pack at ~1pm the day before brewing. By
around 10pm, the pack was as swollen as could be and I pitched it to 2cps
of 1.020 wort. The next morning I added another 2cps of wort of the same SG
and by 6pm that eve had one heck of an active starter. I pitched this to a
pretty heavy stout (1.070) and had steady bubbling in the airlock within
5hrs.


My questions:


What are the problems associated with over-pitching, and does this sound
like a case of such?


How would I go about adding sweetness to the stout at bottling time
(presumably with lactic acid)? I am looking for some suggestion as to how
much sweetener I should add to achieve my desired result (something like
Sheaf's ).

Hi,


 I'm trying to find information about temperature controllers for a chest 
freezer.  I'm looking for a controller that will control a cooling source and a 
heating source at the same time.  I have searched previous digests and it seems 
that the commercially available controllers will control either cooling or 
heating (or just cooling), but not both.  I have also found plans for building 
a suitable controller, but if there is a controller available pre-built, I 
would rather go that route.  Thanks in advance for any help.

Subject: Resuscitating Ale,Mill Rolls,Slow Wort Chilling


Brewsters:


John Watts writes about a Lemon Wheat Ale
which is undercarbonated. Well you could
move to Denver or make up a Starter with
1 tlb of malt extract and yeast allow it to
reach kraeusen in 12 hours.  Add more
priming sugar as syrup
( I'd guess half the normal amount??)
to your beer still in the bottle, then a little
of the active starter and seal it back up.
Store it at 70F off the floor for a week or so
and it should be OK.
- ----------------------------------------
Ralph Link asks about building a mill
as outlined in Brew Ware.  I once converted
a noodle maker to a grain mill unsatisfactorily.
The reason it didn't work well was that
the surface of the rollers was very smooth
( naturally) and it would not pick up the grain
and pull it through the nip without my pushing
it through. (a PITA to say the least)
Large rollers - say 10 -12 inch don't have
this problem because the nip angle is
much smaller and the grain is carried into
the nip slowly.  For the small rolls an inch
or two in diameter, like we might build, =


it is important to have *knurled* surfaces
on the rolls to grab the grain and pull it
into the nip to get an efficient milling.
I also suggest that any mill you buy or
build have an adjustable nip, so you can mill
different size grains and mill them twice
to get the best crush (equivalent to a
four roll mill) for a stick-free sparge.
There is a reason the big boys use a
six roll mill in preparing their grain.
- ----------------------------------------
Jack Schmidling takes the position that
rapid wort chilling is not necessary to =


produce good beer.  As long as you
don't pour wort through the air while it is hot
I'd have to say you may be able to make =


good beer this way. =




As I recall, You didn't describe clearly enough
to say how you handled the wort after boiling.
If you just put the lid on the kettle and =


allowed it to cool down overnight then
you clearly won't have as big of a problem =


as if you tried to strain off the hops while
the wort was hot.  The large shot of yeast
may also have helped since the wort was
likely fermenting in a few hours after you
pitched it onto the previous batch dregs.
In addition to HSA slow cooling of wort
provides a good temperature and time
for bacteria to operate at warm temperatures
in a nearly perfect medium.


I'd also have to say your comparison is
faulty and your results inconclusive,
since you didn't compare it directly to a wort
which had been cooled quickly. You were
also comparing last year's beer which had =


apparently been under-pitched to beer which
had been properly or, perhaps, over-pitched. =




Sorry, Jack, I can't agree with you based on
your poor experimental conditions and
lots of my batches made both ways. =




Cooling the wort quickly and pitching =


properly  high quantities of yeast =


is the secret to great beer.
I wouldn't encourage anyone to do otherwise.

Subject: Wyeast NW ESB Test Yeast?


Greetings all,


My local homebrew supply shop here in Austin was recently test marketing 2
new Wyeast strains.  One of these strains was labeled as "NW ESB".  The
name led me to beleive that maybe it was Redhook yeast or something
similar.  Anyway,  I put together a basic ESB recipe (10 gallons):

Subject: re: pump summary


My $0.02 as a consulting engineer who deals with pumps:


It's better to put the pump between the boiler (or whatever 
source) and the chiller.  As the wort/water/whatever goes 
through the chiller it loses head to friction. Between that and 
any frictional losses due to valves, fittings, etc. you could 
run into problems.


Here's why:  Every pump has a characteristic operating curve of 
head (as in feet of water, which can be converted to psi) versus 
flow. There's also a curve for that pump of the Net Positive 
Suction Head (NPSH) that's required for the pump to operate at a 
given flow. Based on the height of liquid in the boiler in 
relation to the pump, the frictional losses between it and the 
pump from valves, etc., and other factors (vapor pressure, 
atmospheric pressure, etc.), the pump and piping setup has a 
certain amount of available NPSH.  If the available NPSH is less 
than the required NPSH for the pump (and we always use a safety 
factor of NPSHa has to be 2X NPSHr), the head/pressure on the 
upstream side of the pump impeller could be low enough to cause 
vaporization and cavitation of the pump. My offhand guess is 
that a high temperature liquid has a higher vapor pressure and 
would be more likely to do this (but that's part of the 
available NPSH calculation)


When a pump cavitates, microscopic vapor bubbles are formed on 
the low pressure side of the impeller and then rapidly collapse 
on themselves. The stress at the point is large and the impeller 
can actually erode (i.e. be eaten away).


So, to be safe it's a good idea to keep the intake side of your 
pump free of twists, curves, valves, and chillers. If you need 
to control flow, it's better to do it on the discharge side with 
a valve. Simply put, it's better to push something with a pump 
than to pull it.


Granted, it's much more important when your pump costs $50K than 
when it's only $100, but it's your money. Better safe than 
sorry, I say. Unless you'd like to do the calculations. It's 
hard to find NPSH curves for such small pumps and it's a pain to 
calculate the frictional losses through all of your intake 
piping for small diameter piping.


Good Luck!

What I believe this proves is that you can have a good party with 10
batches of homemade beer even if the beer has minor defects.  I recall an
IPA that I took to a departmental picnic; it too received rave reviews
despite significant fruitiness and easily perceived diacetyl.


I won't argue the effect of yeast pitching, especially since "pitch more
yeast" is almost always good advice.


However, if you really want to prove your point on chilling, make a 10
gallon batch of American Light Lager or Bohemian Pilsner (or any other very
light style), chill only half and then enter the resulting brews in several
(i.e., 10 or 20) large competitions.  If at that point, there is no
statistical difference in the scoring, then you'll have some good results
worthy of publication in places other than HBD.


Until good data arrives, I'll have to agree that there are a lot of
mommilies out there...

HBDers -


I have read with great interest some of the discussions regarding yeast 
starters.  The discussions seem to indicate that using 1.020 started  is 
acceptable.  I always thought that you should try to make the starter the same 
temperature and composition as the wort it was to be pitched in.  Is this 
true?  Or maybe its only true for the last step of the yeast growth cycle?  
[Eg, start with a 1.020 starter, and then pitch that slurry into a starter 
similar to the beer it is to be used with say 1.050.]


In this vain, I am planning to start my lager smack-pacs of Wyeast in the 
frige, even if it initially takes a week or more to swell.  Does anyone out 
there have experience with this?  How long (generally) will it take a smack 
pack of Bavarian/Bohemian lager yeast to swell in a 45 deg F environment?


In the past I have resorted to using warm starters and warm initial ferments 
on my lagers to get the yeasties rolling.  This year I'm tring my best to be a 
*good boy* and treat my yeast with the respect it deserves......hell, I may 
even rack off the trub that gets carried over into the primary!

Subject: Schmidling & wort chilling


To Jack Schmidling and HBDers,


Regarding Jack's recent post on wort chillers in home brewing ...


I agree that it is unnecessary for a home brewer who makes 5 gal batches
to make or buy a fancy wort chiller.  However, I use a procedure to
chill my 5-6 gal of wort that is faster and not much more work than his
"no chill" method. 


I boil my wort (initial volume 6-7 gal) on an electric stove in a 5 gal
pot and a 4 gal pot.  I cover and cool the 4 gal pot (which has 2-3 gal
of wort) by immersing it in my kitchen sink which I filled with cold
water; I treat the 5 gal pot the same way, using my basement sink.
(When I lived solo in an apartment, I used my bathtub for cooling.)  My
method isn't much more work than letting the brew kettle sit on the
stove top overnight, but it chills the wort to about 70 deg in about an
hour.  This is faster than brewpubs or microbreweries and is much faster
than megabreweries.


I have seen theoretical ('hand waving') arguments as to why a home
brewer's 5 gal of wort must be chilled in 15-20 minutes with some sort
of snazzy counter-flow wort chiller, but I have not seen blind taste
tests nor chemical tests which support this claim.  Has anyone?

If you want the maple flavor to come through, you will need to add more
than 1 pint, especially if the flavor must contend with spices for
attention.


I just brewed a 6.7 gallon batch of Maple Ale (total SG: 1.058) with
1.5 quarts of maple syrup ("pasteurized" at 150 degrees for 10 minutes
and added to the already fermenting wort).  Nothing else was special
about it except that I tried to keep the total IBUs lower than usual
and didn't add any late-boil hops that would contend with the maple
flavor and aroma.  (If you are interested: 9# 2-row and 2# crystal.)


The maple flavor turned out pretty subtle.  If you tasted it, I'd bet you
wouldn't be able to tell what the "guest" flavor was, until I told you.




If I were brewing a 5 gallon batch of spiced ale and wanted maple flavor,
I'd probably consider adding 2-3 quarts.  The problem is that you are adding
a significant amount of fermentables (sucrose), and must lessen the malt
to arrive at a target SG--or just go for the big beer and wing it ;-).
(I calculated the gravity of the maple syrup that I bought to be 1.347.)

Subject: Fehling's solution nit


It is the cupric ion in Fehling's (or Benedict's) reagent which is reduced.
An aldehyde (or keto) group in the sugar is oxidized thus it is the
reducing agent. Thus sugars with available aldehyde (or keto) groups are
referred to as "reducing sugars". Sucrose is one of very few (and I can't
come up with another) disaccharide in which the anomeric (keto or aldo)
carbon takes part in the glycoside bond and is thus not available to reduce
copper. If a monosaccharide is represented E-A with E representing an
enantiomeric carbon and A the anomeric carbon, a typical dissachcaride
(such as maltose or lactose) would be represented as E-AgE-A with "g"
representing the glycoside (1-4 in this case) bond  between the anomeric
carbon (1) on one monosachharide molecule and a enantiomeric (4) carbon on
the other. The anomeric carbon is, in this case, still avalilable to reduce
cupric ion and thus react with Fehling's (or Benedict's) reagent. In
sucrose the arrangement is E-AgA-E (1-2) bond i.e. the anomeric carbons are
tied up in linking the fructose and glucose molecules and are thus not
available to reduce Fehling's reagent and sucrose is not a reducing sugar.
Glucose and fructose individuall have the E-A structure


Unfermentable sugars have the structure E-AgE-AgE-Ag...E-AgE-A i.e. they
have an available anomeric carbon which can reduce Fehling's reagent and
will be detected. The end of the chain with this carbon is often called the
"reducing end" of the chain. Thus dextrinous beers will give indications
that reducing sugars are present even though fermentation is complete and
brewers using Fehlings or Benedicts solution to detect the end of
fermentation need to be aware of this fact. Just as one detects the end of
fermentation with a hydrometer by noting that the readings have stopped
decreasing so one should see that reducing sugar readings stop decreasing
(Noonan says they should be at less than 2% - 2% of what I don't know) when
fermentation is complete.

This is true, and indicates that a little knowledge combined with the
lag time should help you decide what the problem is.  Also of concern is
the 'healthiness' of the yeast's growth environment, e.g. the wort.  If
it's an all-grain or partial mash brew and your pH's were correct, then
you're fine.  If it's extract, then it's probably ok unless the extract
is older than 4 to 6 months (from manufacturing date).  Other than that,
considering the health of the starter and the aeration/oxygenation and
the respiration issue should answer the question about how long a
particular lag time turned out to be.  (Longer not necessarily being
worse as you mention).

"More O2 than perhaps you should have" is not an issue IF you give the
wort 5 to 7 minutes to "rest", e.g. reach equilibrium, after
oxygenating.  In the BT article that you mention above, I believe they
point out that it is possible to put too much oxygen in the wort, but
that it comes back out of solution within 5 to 7 minutes.  The
recommendation was to use two 20-30 second blasts, assuming a
Oxygenator/Liquid Bread type system, separated by a few minutes, and
then waiting a couple of minutes before pitching.

This would be an interesting experiment for a homebrewer to do (or a
club).  You may want to make it a 2-variable experiment and correlate
oxygenation with the amount of yeast pitched, because the yeast count
will make a difference, e.g. the size of the starter or amount of
slurry.

I used to do this but after reading much about how rapid temperature changes 
can affect yeasts, I stopped doing it. I don't believe the problem is the 
rapid cooling, the yeast should just go dormant. Its the rapid increase in 
temperature later on (the next day?) when you pitch it. If you really want 
to do this, I suggest that early on brew day the first thing to do is to 
remove the starter from the fridge and let it warm up to room temp on its 
own, well in advance of pitching. What I've tried to do for the last few 
months is to have the yeast starter going well in advance of brew day such 
that I can decant the beer (most of it anyway) and then pitch, with the beer 
being pretty clear. But it does take some longer range planning to do this.

"Requirement?" The fact is that respiring yeast do not require O2,
according to Tracy Aquilla.


I believe that the perceived need to oxygenate yeast among homebrewers is
largely associated with the fact that we tend to underpitch, and use O2 to
compensate.


When yeast is pitched in sufficient quantities, as I understand it, minimal
oxygenation is needed.


This point has been offered to the homebrew community many times over from
various sources, but has not achieved the popularity of relatively
indiscriminate oxygenating.


Personally, I have had excellent results with large starters and very
little aeration. Lag times haven't been a problem.


The desirability of oxygenating may also vary from one strain of yeast to
another. In some cases it may be not good practice to aerate at all.


It seems that we tend to take a "one size fits all" approach in general to
this issue. I'd like to learn more about it. Does anyone know a good
source?


Thanks,

Subject: Sweetening Brown Ale


I just made a delicious "Nut Brown Ale" from a partial mash,
pre-packaged kit that I changed the hopping schedule on and added some
dry LME to the wort.  The aroma of molasses was fantastic and it had a
really nice flavor.  I was hoping to duplicate a brown ale I had
previously had at a brew pub, and it was "just a touch - SWEETER"  I'm
not looking for candy, but I felt that was a perfect brown ale.


I'd like to add a touch of sweetness, but my question is, do I add a cup
of dark brown sugar, or some amount of dexetrin, because it's a
sweetener that doesn't ferment?


Any help would be appreciated, private email OK, too.
