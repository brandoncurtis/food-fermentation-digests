Subject: How to use Hop Pellets?


Okay, I had my holiday ale brewing all planned out. I had new procedures in
place after the input from everyone here. I was sure my boil would happen
well, my fermentation temperatures would be under control, and I was going
to move to unhopped extract!


And I bought pellet hops. Was this a problem? Well, let me quickly describe
my dilemma. As a computer seminar speaker, I always dread the person who
knows just enough to ask me those questions that should have easy answers.
Hopefully, you can all bear with me, because right now, I'm that person who
knows just enough to be dangerous.


I boiled the wort with the pellet hops, and cooled the wort over about 30-40
minutes to 68F in an ice bath. Once that was done, I stirred the wort in a
circle to get all the "gunk" into the center of the pot, wrapped my siphon
uptake tube in my fine mesh bag, and started the siphon in the bottom corner
of the pot. Well, the hop "slime" soon coated the entire bag, stopping any
further flow through it and my siphon died.


I then tried pouring the cooled wort through my funnel, straining out the
hop slime. It was soon coated, and I resorted to a method of pour, clean the
strainer, pour, clean the strainer...


Everything seems to be okay now (fermenting nicely), but this leads to a few
questions:


1. Did I need to worry about separating the pellet hops from the wort for
fermentation? Should I have done a trub removal by putting the wort in my
carboy for 12-hours, and then immediately racking into my primary fermenter
instead?


2. Should I use the whole hops instead? Are they easier to work with?


3. Is it better to siphon out of the boiler? I like the idea of using the
"inline aerator" so siphoning seems attractive. I thought the "whirlpool"
and siphoning through a bag would work, but...


4. Non-related question--what about sanitizing a frozen 2-liter bottle of
ice and plopping it into hot wort to cool? This is suggested in Lee Janson's
book "Brew Chem 101".


Thanks for keeping me going and educating me! Soon I can help answer
questions instead of just ask!

Subject: Re: reusing yeast in carboy


- -------Mark Tumarkin <tumarkin`at`mindspring.com>---------------
Anyway, my question concerns the use of dry hopping when using this
technique. I dry hop with leaf hops (as seems to be the most common
practice), but even with pellets you end up with a lot of hops in the yeast
cake at the bottom of the fermenter. Is this a problem? And if so, what
would be the best way to deal with it? 
- -------------------------------------------------------


Try using several washes with sterile water... pour the yeast into a
sanitized jar add 8-16 ozs sterile water and stir well ...wait for the
heavier particles (hop bits and trub) to settle and pour the top portion off
into another sanitized jar leaving behind the debris ...repeat this another
time or two if needed ...then repitch with this clean yeast

Subject: Re:Traquair House Ale - Grain Bill Question


- ------From: cburns`at`egusd.k12.ca.us (Charles Burns)--------------------
My next project - the perfect Strong Scotch Ale and Traquair House Ale is my 
target. Reading in Ray Daniels' _Designing Great Beers_ (page 290), he lists 
the grain bill as Pale Ale malt and Black malt only. Reading Michael 
Jackson's Beer Companion (page 110), he lists Pale Ale malt and Roasted 
Barley only.


Does anyone have a third reference that could clear this up? Is it Black or 
is it Roasted Barley?
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to offer some input. I just returned from Scotland yesterday
and had an opportunity last week to talk with Frank Smith who brews with Ian
at Traquair. The house was closed and no one else around so I had the opp to
ask a lot of questions while I was there. 


        I did ask the about ingredients and Frank did say there were only 3
ingredients... Pale Malt and EKent Goldings but when I asked about the dark
malt he chose to be a little vague but after a bit more discussion I was
left with the impression it was roast rather than black even though he would
not come right out and say so. Also after having a few pints of the bear ale
and later some of the Jacobite Ale it sure seemed like roast to me. I also
talked with a local enthusiast at the Traquair Arms down the road and he
remembered the Bear Ale being a lot darker in the past, which might indicate
black malt being used in the past.  


        You also have to consider that these beers are fermented in Russian
oak (the oldest dating back to mid 1700s) with lots of character built in.
Frank mentioned that they have been approached several times by
microbiologists that would like to take a core sample to see what kind of
critters are at work here (NoWay). 


        The other interesting point was that the yeast is not maintained.
They get it fresh from various breweries but primarily Belhaven. They have
tried Broughton but that did not work too well. Also of interest was that
they do not beat the yeast back into the beer nor do they skim it unless it
gets too active. The temp seemed to be much warmer than I have been lead to
believe scottish brewers used (it seemed to be in the high 60s-low 70s) and
Frank did say that if the ferment sticks they will give it a good stir and
crank the heat up. This is a real grass roots brewery where small batches (4
barrels) are done in a rather basic environment. Rough cobbelstone floors...
mold/mildew on the walls... these people brew from the heart more than the
book but as Frank mentioned to me The real art of it all is knowing what to
do when things go strange. 


        I hope this helps a bit...

>From Brigitte in Hong Kong...




A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo, and
when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the
back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the
herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole
keeps improving by the regular culling of the weakest members.


In much the same way, the human brain can operate only as fast as the
slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills off =
brain cells, but naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain =
cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the =
weaker cells, constantly making the brain a faster
and more efficient machine.


Drink more beer!

Subject: Tried overnight cooling of boil kettle


Hi


I tried an overnight cooling of the boil kettle last night as suggested by
Jack Schmidling.  The kettle was left around 14 hours.  After this time the
kettle was still quite warm to the touch.  I figured if it was that warm I
wouldn't bother taking the temperature, let alone pitching yeast into it.  So
I had fire up the counter flow chiller anyway.


I was disappointed by the result, but perhaps the overnight temps where Jack
brews are a lot lower than here: last night it got to 12 deg C (53F).  I also
brew 10 gallon batches.


I might try it again in Winter (which is of course over 6 months away in
Australia).




Bye

Subject: RIMS sparging methods??


        


I mash using a RIMS system,  I was talking to a guy at the local HB meeting
and he mentioned the following.


Instead of starting a sparge right after mash out he reccomended filling
the mash back up and starting another 5 minute RIMS cycle, then starting
the sparge.  I have used this method two times now and seem to get a better
result in terms of extraction.  


But, what are the drawbacks?  Are there any?  I have not drank the beer yet
so I dont know the full story?


Any comments?

Subject: Justification, blowoff, and an equipment question


On the recent thread re: cost-justification of homebrewing


I tried justifying homebrew by cost.  It worked for a while, after decent
beer went over 6 bucks per 6 pack, but it just doesn't support for long. It
took my SO longer to figure it out than the regrettable fishing boat episode,
but she figured it out anyway.  She's also figured out that welfare is too
expensive, weapons are too expensive, etc.  Fortunately, her hobby is
quilting, where she buys perfectly good fabric at several bucks per yard,
cuts it up into little bits, sews it back together, and then 2 or three years
later, it keeps someone else warm in the winter.  So, remember, relationships
are give and take.  Find a weakness, and exploit it!  Keep brewing!


Al K. says he cannot trace a single infection to a bad blowoff tube.


Well, I fought an infection a couple of years ago.  I couldn't find the
source anywhere. I sanitized everything twice, changed siphons, etc. Those of
you who have had this problem know what a cast iron sonova--- well, I finally
bought a glass blowoff tube. It's made by JT's or somebody, it's 1/2 inch
inside diameter, and works great.  I can sanitize it by boiling if I want.
 Don't use pellet hops without sieve-ing them out, cause the tube may plug,
generating horrible stuff, but I don't worry about my blowoff anymore.


A question on equipment:  I've a yen to stop siphoning from my boiling kettle
into the carboy, and would like to upgrade to a counterflow chiller.  I'd
like to attach the chiller  to a valve, installed on my big enamel on steel
canner. Has anyone else done this?  Can the steel in such a kettle hold
threads, or should I go for a bulkhead fitting with a drain on the inside and
a valve on the outside?  Yes, I am scrounging, looking for a keg, but I am
concerned about the heat transfer properties of SS, so I'm designing for the
stuff I've got.  Any advice would be appreciated.

Subject: Mash Efficiency / Stout


Rob Kienle asked about efficiencies for a stout recipe where he looked for
a gravity o 1.072 using 30 lbs of grain for a 12 gal batch


Rob, you got a total extraction rate of 25.5 pts per lb per gal. using a
total of 30 lbs of grain & adjuncts for a 12 gal batch and you were looking
for a 1.072 OG 


>From pale ale malt (since you use a similar system to me) you should get 31
to 34, depending on brand and lot. I'd expect about 10 - 15 pts per lb for
the dark grains


pale ale 20 X 32 = 640
dark           7 X 12 =  84
flaked           3 X 25? = 75
Total                  = 814/12 gal = OG of 66.5


You didn't say how low your OG was. but the above is about what I would
expect approximating your recipe

Subject: Tank connections


welding a coupling into the side of a tank works ok for industrial
things, but if I did that, our inspectors would have a bird. Threads are
seriously hard to clean.


The old sanitary couplers where the bevel seat kind. They have threaded
*outsides* and the seating surface is a conical bevel. Even these
threads prove to be very difficult to clean (and the bevel can be
problematic). The preferred sanitary connection (at least in the States)
is the TriClover clamp design (otherwise known as tri-clamp). This is a
very easy clamp design. Fast on and off. Parts are readily available
(even in scrap if you're in Dairy Country).


As long as you're welding, I'd put on this sort of clamp system rather
then mess around with threads.

And others as well.  Notice a nice pattern here?  We know where these
brewers are from.  It might help us understand their problems or results,
it helps foster a sense of community, and you might even discover a fellow

but the majority still don't.  So, this is it, my semi-annual request that

some can be from the hops used..old/mildewed from improper storage


i have never had HSA problems that i could directly relate back to

most often it has been the result of a defective fermentation, slow start

To amplify a bit on this:


What I was told on a visit to & private tour of the Orval brewery in 1995 
is that the 1 week primary fermentation (in open fermeters in a closed 
"clean room" with video monitors) is done with a single strain of a 
saccharomyces yeast.  A blended culture of several strains (3 or 4)of 
unnamed types is added for the three week secondary fermentation (in 
closed, horzontal SS tanks w/ blow-off hoses).


Then at bottling, a dose of "liquid candi" is added along with some of 
the primary yeast.  The bottled beer is conditioned for 6 weeks at 59 deg 
F before releasing. Yeast recovered from the brewery is sent to a convent 
where it is pressed into "Trappiste Tablets", which are sold by the nuns 
to support their Order.


Although my host/guide (Director of Marketing, M. Francois Harenne, a 
very gracious and hospitable man, BTW) didn't say specifically say that 
Brettaanomyces was one of the bugs added for secondary, he did say that 
one of the yeast strains added at that time had something like a 98 
percent attenuation characteristic, which would lead me to believe, along 
with Orval's unique taste, that it is indeed a Brett yeast.  Given the 
ptiching schedule and use of multiple strains, I think we'd be 
hard-pressed to clone this beer very closely.  I've used the bottle dregs 
from stuff I brought home. I made a decent beer, but it wasn't that close 
to the real deal.


Now, the highlight of this visit wasn't the brewery tour (which was 
incredible, to be sure), but drinking a properly cared for and aged (at 
59 deg F continuously since the beer's "birth") two-year-old bottle of 
Orval from a pre-war, hand-blown Orval crystal chalice. It just doesn't 
get any better!

Subject: Cabbages and HSA / bubblegum & Brettanomyces


     Hi all,
     
     Alan writes in that he experienced a strong cabbage smell while 
     pasteurizing an infected batch, and therefore attributed the aroma to 
     hot side aeration (HSA).  I think that there is a flaw in this 
     conclusion.
     
     HSA causes oxidation of the wort, which will impart cardboard (and 
     sometimes sherry) aromas and flavors to the beer.  It can also 
     diminish the malt flavor of a beer (because malty tasting melanoidins 
     are oxidized).
     
     The cabbage smell you experienced was most likely caused by the 
     invading bacteria.  When you heated the beer, you drove off volatile 
     compounds, thus intensifying the aroma.
     ----------------------------------
     Al K. writes about bubblegum being caused by the yeast Brettanomyces.  
     This is not in line with my experience.  While I totally agree that 
     bubblegum is caused by yeast, I have fermented with Brett., and the 
     resulting beer was not at all bubblegummy.
     
     Many subspecies of Saccharomyces yeast can produce bubblegum aromas 
     (many Weizen strains and wild strains).  Yeasts that do not normally 
     produce bubblegum aromas can make it if they are abused 
     (under-pitched, unaerated, high fermentation temp...).
     
     To my nose, Brett. contributes an earthy kind of character that some 
     describe as "horsy."  I am friends with a person that spends time with 
     horses and also brews, and she doesn't think Brett character is at all 
     "horsy."  Perhaps that term was used by someone who had never been in 
     a barn, and imagined that's what it was like, and now others use it, 
     too.  Just a theory.

Subject: Extract Kits


     Hi all,
     
     While reading through a homebrew catalogue the other day, I noticed 
     something that disturbed me.  The catalogue was from a company that I 
     consider to be good, and I'm sure that many novices trust the info 
     that they get from these folks.
     
     Several of their *extract* kits contained unmalted adjuncts, like 
     flaked barley and oats.  I would have thought this quite appropriate 
     in a pLambic (pseudo-Lambic) kit, but these kits were for stouts!
     
     Every now and then somebody writes into this digest with a recipe that 
     will put starch into the final beer.  Perhaps this practice is so 
     widespread because respected distributors encourage it!
     
     If any homebrew shop operators are reading this, I ask you to review 
     your kits and ensure that the ingredients are all appropriate.  
     Starchy beer is seldom good.  Haze and infection are all but 
     guaranteed.
     
     Have fun!

Subject: Blowoff hoses


There has been some discussion lately of blowoff hoses, whether or not they can
be a source of infection, and, if they are, how to clean the hose.


I have to doubt, along with Al K., that they are a significant risk of causing
infection but must concede to Dave Burley that foam receding from the blowoff
hose could fall back into the fermenter and carry bugs with it.  However, if
it does this it would only be from the first few inches if the tube, since, as
Al points out, the bugs don't move on their own.  This being the case, it would
seem that only the easily reachable first few inches of the blowoff hose need
be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized.  There would seem to be no need for
scrubbing the entire length of the hose.


I am not going to worry about it.

Subject: Upward facing manifold


HBDers -


A few weeks back someone posted success with facing the slots of their 
manifold upward instead of downward (toward the bottom of the mash tun).  
While I don't doubt the truthfullness regarding the poster's results, I can 
say that it did not work well for me.  I found the upward facing slots 
entrained air, did not clear despite significant recirc (it did eventually 
clear after several gallons were run into the kettle), and had lower 
efficiency (about 29ppg vs my normal 30ppg).    I should say that I use a 10 
gallon Gott, with a square shaped 1/2" copper manifold, with about 3 slots per 
inch.


This results of this little experiment (if you can call it that) were 
certainly not disasterous, but IMHO not as good as downward facing slots.

Subject: re: Boiling Specialty Grains


Mike asks for clarification regarding the boiling of specialty grains in 
hbd#2562.


Mike, Virtually every text on home brewing recommends against boiling 
specialty grains due to the potential for extracting unwanted tannins from 
the grain husks. I would quote the books/pages but I'm at work now (shhhhsh) 
and don't have the books with me. The common recommendation is to bring a 
few (2-3) gallons of water to 170F, place the cracked grains in a muslim bag 
into the pot and let them steep for about 30 minutes. Gently squeeze the bag 
to drain out the color and flavored water in the grains and then remove it 
completely from the kettle. 


Bring to water to a boil, turn off the heat, add extract and stir until all 
dissolved, THEN turn the heat back on. Bring to boil, add bittering hops and 
proceed with rest of boil according to recipe.


I highly recommend that you read a good beginners text. I personally started 
with Dave Miller's "Brewing the Worlds Great Beers" and then went on to his 
"Handbook of Homebrewing". I recently picked up a copy of Al K's book, 
Homebrewing Volume I and am very impressed with how its organized. It 
actually gets the reader through a first batch in the first 20 or so pages, 
then adds several hundred pages of much more indepth explanations of the 
process and materials. I highly recommend it to any extract brewer, 
beginning or experienced as it contains a nicely organized reference to lots 
of questions.

Subject: O2 Safety


A couple of HBD's ago, someone asked about safety considerations regarding
oxygen use.  Oxygen (O2), decreases the ignition temperature of anything
that will burn. (things catch on fire easier).  O2 also can cause things
which no not normally catch fire, catch fire.
So, if oxygen leaks, it can be a fire hazard.  O2, itself, will not burn.
So it is not a flammable gas.  The precautions you take to keep from
wasting O2, ie, checking connections with soapy water, will help prevent
problems.  Also, if you oxygenate your wort at a high rate for a long time,
you could get an O2 inriched atmosphere at the area within a couple feet of
the vessel.  What can happen?  After a few minutes of wort oxygenation
while you stand beside the vessel, your cotton shirt adsorbs some O2 and
there is an O2 inriched atmosphere at your chest area.  You are smoking a
cig and the ash falls on your chest.  Your shirt could catch
fire..(conditions would have to be "just right",  but with my luck..)
So, don't get an ignition source near O2 and something which will burn in
an O2 inriched atmosphere, and you should be OK.  Of course, all the other
precautions re the use of compressed gasses apply (securing the cylinder,
cracking the valve before attaching the regulator, turning on the regulator
slowly, facing the regulator dials away from your face when you turn on the
gas,.. etc).  Any questions, feel free to email.
Cheers, Mike 8*)

I've long been concerned about not being able to easily flush the
secondary with CO2 prior to racking into it, and wished to heck that
Williams or someone sold a simple trigger-type device for spraying CO2
into carboys, bottling buckets etc.  Any ideas on that one anyone?


Anyway, piping the CO2 from the primary into the secondary to pre-flush
it with CO2 sounds like a good idea, and I wouldn't be too concerned
about the "undesirable odors" and such.  I mean, where did they come
from in the first place?  Also consider the fact that new CO2 from the
freshly racked beer will flush it anyway.  The purpose of the primary's
CO2 being in the secondary is just so that accidental aeration won't
take place during the racking.  The racking process itself mechanically
causes CO2 to be released from the beer anyway, so the above mentioned
procedure is just insurance anyway.  BTW, one thing I have been doing is
racking to a secondary at that magic moment that occurs after the yeast
begins settling out and the airlock perks are slowing down (maybe 5 to
10 seconds between perks) and before the primary fermentation has
_really_ finished (perks 30+ seconds apart).  This procedure not only
causes the usual release of CO2 during the racking, but also assures me
that the fermentation is active enough during the beginning part of the
secondary fermentation to produce CO2 for flushing out the head space in
the secondary.  Waiting too long before racking may accidentally leave
plain ol' air on top of the beer for longer than you like, especially if
your goal is that of conditioning the beer in the secondary ... now if
we just had that darn CO2 sprayer like I mentioned in the first place,
it'd be super easy to just flush with CO2 at all critical stages or
transfers (primary to secondary racking, secondary to bottling bucket
racking, quick squirt across the tops of all those bottles you just
filled etc.).

In #2562 Al wrote
>AJ pretty much proved that you can't overoxygenate wort.  He posted
>this about a year and a half ago.


I think that statement in isolation is bound to stir controversy. If I
recall correctly there were a few things at issue. One was that I was
unable to kill yeast by holding them at high levels of dissolved oxygen
(200-400% of saturation) - they just kept multiplying. Note that this was
one experiment with one strain (Wyeast London, I think). In a second
experiment, yeast (I think it was Wyeast Czech Pils this time) were
observed to consume oxygen at an amazing clip once their densities got high
enough. Again, relying on memory, cell counts above about 10E6/ml resulted
in reduction of the DO of wort from saturation (8 mg/L) to less than 1 mg/L
in about half an hour. Third is that if wort is oxygenated to hundreds of
percent of saturation oxygen will escape to the air at a rate proportional
to the difference between wort DO partial pressure and atmospheric O2
partial pressure which means that DO levels will drop most rapidly at first
and then approach 100% DO more slowly. The yeast are, of course, consuming
oxygen at the same time.


Taken together these things together I reason that you probably cannot ruin
your beer by running pure O2 into the wort to the point where the DO level
gets up to several hundred percent if you leave it alone thereafter. If, on
the other hand, you maintain a high oxygen level for a prolonged period of
time you will hold the yeast in growth phase, your beer will be full of
growth phase metabolites and it will not be very pleasant to drink. This is
exactly what you do when you make a starter i.e. keep the O2 level high so
as to maximize cell mass production. I recommend that anyone interested
grow his next starter by keeping the O2 level high for a period of a day or
so. Give it a hit every half hour throughout the day. Then decant the some
of the broth and taste it.

with the intent of force carbonating it and then CP_bottle filling 
some bottles for XMas gifts.  What is the typical carbonation level, 
in volumes of CO2, for a sparkling mead?  TIA!
