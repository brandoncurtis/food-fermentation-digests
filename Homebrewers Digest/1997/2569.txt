Actually, it would take a brain far better than his to correctly identify a
particular strain with out any other information. Misquoted or
misunderstood?  I don't know, but I read it. In any case, it's an amusing
comment and I should expect a bit of flack from this group.  If AJ only
knew the state of that particular brain lately.......


Having said that, one *can* see characteristic *differences* between the
strains.  American ale tends to be rounder, W306 and W68 tend to be more
elongated ovals, Brett. tends to be elongated and less oval.  But to look
at a slide of yeast, not knowing the growth conditions or having a clue
what strain it might be, no way.  I would never bet on whether a strain is
a lager or an ale.  Well, I would bet on Brettanomyces, but only with a
gram stain and 1000 x oil imersion.  It still is not 100% sure.

My experience with cows is that they are easy to tell apart unless you are
really far away and then some have been mistaken as deer.

Right.  Even Wallerstein Nutirient Agar (one of the simplier methods) which
will show very distinct differences between strains with respect to the
uptake of dye is not specific enough to identify a strain by eye.   It is
useful if you are a brewery and plate the same strain day after day and one
day you see a different looking colony appear.

Sounds like a good deal to me.  You might be better off if they could

Subject: Malting


G'day
A question for the maltsters


Is the drying phase of malting barley absolutely necessary?  Would it be
possible to germinate the barley to the required stage and then go
straight to  the brewery for mashing. 
It seems to me that the drying is only required for the storage of the
barley or does some other process happen?
The reason I am asking this is I've only just started partial grain
brews and have malted the barley myself. The tricky bit is drying the
grain. If I could short circuit the system by deleting the drying bit it
would make it so much easier.

Subject: Mashing in a cooler?


I'm a partial-mash brewer who has been mashing on the stove and sparging in a
bottling bucket.  I need to improve this system and was thinking of using
either a Gott/Igloo type cooler, an ez masher, or a combination Phil's
sprger/lauter tun.  Anyone have any feelings as to which is the best way to
go. Not having any of these available to look at/ test etc. I rely on the
homerbrew collective to help me out.  If I go the way of the cooler do I then
have to build a manifold with copper tubing and insert a false bottom to hold
the grains? Is this difficult to do?  Are there any references out there for
me to check out ie. magaizines, web sites etc...? If possible private e-mail
your response as I do not have much of a chance to check out this site on a
regular basis.

Yes, but the only real advantage to this is to average
out the drop size a little better, so stick with the instructions.
One thing you can do is use this technique to get a better
feeling for in-between results by doubling the sample size
and reading chart at twice the level. Say if you got 3/4%. =


Repeating the test at double the amount should give you
a reading at about 1.5%. Sometimes this may be useful. =

Make sure you used the chart for 5 drops and not for 2 drops.

This is common problem this time of year when fermentation
temperatures with ale yeasts fall below the mid-sixties,
particularly near the end of the fermentation - but Florida??


Get the temperature of the beer to 70F, off the floor at least =


a few inches.  Prepare a re-starter from about a cup of beer
and yeast siphoned from the bottom  of the fermenter and
from about a tablespoon of malt extract which  has been =


dissolved in a minimal amount of water, boiled and cooled.
Add fermenting starter with the acclimated yeast back to your beer.


> Also you had mentioned the

Depending on where you live, altitude wise and the kind of beer,
typically most priming sugar is about 1%. You can use this test to
modify the amount of sugar you add by reducing the priming sugar
in accordance with what is in there already as detected by Clinitest.
However, I only do this with bottling when I have a real time constraint
as I like to get a major amount of the yeast out of the beer in the
secondary. OTOH when I am lagering in Cornies under pressure,
I do this all the time and  the fermenting beer is racked  into the Corni=
e
at around 1% sugar. Since I am going to filter with at least a 5u filter
and properly adjust the carbonation before serving, this is the =


best way to avoid oxidation of the beer during the transfer from the
primary. =




>There has been some talk in the digest recently concerning bottling vers=
us
>fermenting strains of yeast, especially  in some of the Belgian ales. Is=


>this usually done when the beer is filtered?


I'll let AlK respond to Belgian ale techniques, but the most obvious =


one few suspect are the wheat beers of Germany. =


In their export versions, I have read they often filter all the beer =


to make Kristal and then add back lager yeast in the
case of bottle conditioned beer and in case of artificial
carbonation they may just add back  trub to give it that
cloudy appearance.  I don't think this is the case for
non-export, but I don't know and I am sure it depends
on the brewer.  I am sure that hefeweiss contains yeast,
but it may be dead due to pasteurization on export varieties
and that cloudiness may be mostly trub. ( Which to the
average German means cloudiness - but we know what it means)


> In my case, I am thinking of
>doing this because my yeast seem to be partied out.


It is also possible that your yeast is partyed out because =


the stout was too low in FANs due to an excessive amount
of sugar put in there by the extract manufacturer
( if you are using extract).  I had this happen to me once
when I made a John Bull Stout for a brewing class I was teaching.
If you can't re-start your fermentation easily, I suspect you will
have to add some yeast nutrients which can provide the
necessary materials for the yeast to function and finish out. =




Scott Rohlf also wonders if his Barleywine is finished at 1.026.
I suggest you try the Clinitest Tablet Test Kit and then
you will know for sure.


With Clinitest you can tell if you have finished
the fermentation or not and then find out what kind of problem
you may have, if any.  You could not do this with just a hydrometer.

I'm not a mycologist, but I play one in my basement.


These are all good questions as is evidenced by the level of 
controversy generated whenever a fellow brewer makes assertions 
as to what is 'really taking place'.  I have a cartoon view of yeast 
growth that comes from my ancient education, current reading, and 
hours spent watching starters grow from slant scrapings.  
I am one who comes down on the side of yeast using O2 for the 
purpose of cell division.  A case in point is the observation that a 
well aerated starter will generate little CO2 yet there looks to be 
very high reproductive rates in the starter.  The O2 levels seem to 
crash rather quickly and the broth becomes foamy, and laden with 
CO2.  Addition of more O2 seems to suppress fermentation, and 
effort presumably returns to cell division.  Other limiting factors 
will likely influence the indefinite continuation of this relation.  
Eventually some critical lipid, or other required cellular building 
block, will be in short supply and the results are indeterminate.  It 
may be that this is where weak cells start to result.  Many of the 
anecdotal records made by brewers, try to fit undesirable yeast 
behavior into a simple box.  One thing I am confident of, "there is 
nothing simple about yeast."  As for looking to science to answer the 
question, I wouldn't be too optimistic.  I believe the answer is to 
find what works for you and strive to incrementally improve results.  
I try to keep my cartoon views flexible.  I will presently be flexing 
into the use of nutrients in my starters to see if I can keep cell 
division going for a longer time, while producing viable yeast 
volumes.  The problem is that even estimating quantities of yeast 
produced is not easy.  Just how thick is that gob of yeast on the 
bottom of my quart canning jar?  How many are in suspension? If I can
come up with an 
experiment that has a hope of even suggesting a useful quantitative 
result, I will run it.  Otherwise we are left to act in a manner not 
unlike those who have been successful before us.  This is what is 
known as a craft.
Good brewing, and keep those cartoons coming.

Hmm. I thought the hot break was the crud that collects on the bottom of
the kettle (and that collects moreso with the addition of Irish Moss)
just *after* the boil (during that time that we, or I anyway, spend
waiting for everything to settle down before starting the transfer). Are
you talking about the foam that forms on the top of the wort at the
start of the boil? Same stuff? I've always wondered if I oughta skim
that off. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in assuming you're
suggesting to do so.

&nbsp;
<BR>Hmm. I thought the hot break was the crud that collects on the bottom
of the kettle (and that collects moreso with the addition of Irish Moss)
just *after* the boil (during that time that we, or I anyway, spend waiting
for everything to settle down before starting the transfer). Are you talking
about the foam that forms on the top of the wort at the start of the boil?
Same stuff? I've always wondered if I oughta skim that off. Feel free to
correct me if I'm wrong in assuming you're suggesting to do so.&nbsp;

Subject: Slick Alarm Thermometer for the Gadgeteers (like me)


I'm guessing that three posts within a month pretty much destroys my
lurker status, but I've just gotta share this ....


I recently ordered and received one of the new Polder thermometers --
it's a combination digital timer/thermometer (separate functions) with a
user-setable (?) temperature alarm.  You simply set the target
temperature and it will begin beeping when it reaches that temperature. 
The REALLY nice feature is that the probe is attached to a 42" cord. 
You can use it for brewing, deep-frying or as a meat-probe inside the
oven.  Another nice feature is its magnetic mount.  I put mine on my
range vent and use a clothespin to hold the probe in my brewkettle or
deepfry pot positioned so that the probe doesn't touch metal.  The range
is ?-390F.  Sure beats the hell out of dipping a standard thermometer
every coupla minutes.  The timer operates independently of the
thermometer.  It uses one AAA battery.


This gadget runs $30 (give or take) and I've seen it advertised in two
different places:  The Chef's Catalog and the Williams-Sonoma catalog. 
I'd guess that it's also available elsewhere.  FWIW, it is also featured
in the latest Consumer Reports.


STANDARD DISCLAIMER: no affiliation, blah, blah, blah ....  this is just
one of the handiest gizmos I've ever come across (and yes, I'm a gadget
freak), and it won't wind up in the closet fer sure ....

Yeast Lovers!
The recent debate about pitching rates raises some questions for me. I know
that you  should pitch more yeast for a lager.  I think I can get some yeast
at the local brewery. It makes a variety of decent lagers so it's yeast must
be fairly versatile. It uses a yeast from a brewery from PA that I believe
is no more (Walters?).  I plan to use it for a Dunkel and a Pre-Prohibition
Pils. Would this yeast be appropriate? Would a quart of slurry be too much?
What bad effects can result?

        Learned a simple tip from John Anshutz, the original brewer `at` the Blind

caps, that came individually sealed in a cello type wrapper. He would take
2 or 3 samples, I believe all of his came from the fermenter, pre-pitching,
and sit them on a shelf for a few days to test his bacterial influences. 
        I'm not aware of the cost, but he felt that it was cheaper (per unit and
labor) to buy these and throw them away after use, than to buy an
auto-clave or spend the time with other methods. YMMV.

        In my commercial practice, whirlpool was for 20/60, and then followed a
20/60 rest to allow the 'gunk' (trub) to settle. Then the wort was allowed
out of the kettle through a valve at the circumference, 'ideally' above and
away from the trub that had settled to the center of the kettle. Factors
that influence success in this are size and design of kettle, inclusive of
'hop-gates,' if any, and the amount of hop pellets used.
        Try it again, and allow a rest for settling, and you might want to start
the siphon tube just below the surface of the wort and lower it, as
required.

        There's nothing wrong with siphoning out of the kettle, but just make sure
your 'in-line aerator' is used post chilling. I can't tell how you plan to
aerate by your text.

        I use a plain old 'cobra-head' beer valve, like the kind you get on the
end of a 'pony-pump' when you rent a keg. Attach to the hose coming off a
CO2 regulator, and adjust your pressure to suit. You could even shove a
piece of suitable diameter copper tubing up the spout, and extend it down
to the bottom of the carboy, and 'fill'er up.' The valve action is nice, as
you can open it at will, or open it all the way and leave it for a
continuous gas flow. It's cheap, too.

Well, traditional water softeners exchange the Ca and Mg ions with Na ions
which eliminates the hard water deposits which would otherwise form in your
water heater, plumbing and leave that white film on your shower door. You
probably don't want to brew with this high sodium water. Many doctors
suggest not drinking it either especially if you are on a sodium restricted

Yes, oats are gelatinized which means that the starches are now soluble in
warm (read mash temp) water instead of needing to be boiled. This is not
the issue though. The oats will contribute starch, not sugar to the
finished beer. Starch won't ferment by the yeast but some wild yeasts and
certainly bacteria will find this food source very appealing. The presence
of starch in your finished beer will cause some stability probs. If you
plan on drinking it quickly, it may not be a problem; certainly in a stout,
haze will not be a problem like it would be in a paler beer.

Nah, I make my oatmeal stouts with a full mash so there aren't any starches
in them. Most of the mouthfeel is from the proteins and dextrines which the
oats contribute.


Kevin asks about kegging carbonation probs:

Well, I'll bet that the carbonation is ok for a while and then things get
kinda flat? This is the problem with using a low dispense pressure. The CO2
will equilibrate in the head space at the lower pressure once you start
dispensing and the effective carbonation will be as if you only carbonated
it with 4-5 psi.


There are several solutions:


1) Turn up the dispense pressure. 10-12 psi will keep the beer closer to
the original carbonation level. If you have foaming probs you can do
several things. Remember to open the tap *all the way* when you pour. The
tendency is to just crack it open which increases foaming through
turbulence. You can also try using a longer run of tap hose. The pressure
drop in 3/16" hose is on the order of several psi per foot (I can give you
exact numbers if you like, I just don't have my Foxx catalog handy) so if
you use a five foot line, you will have the effective pressure at the tap
of about 4-5 psi.


2) Learn to like cask style beer!! I love my beers (mostly well hopped
ales) with light carbonation. When the carbonation drops off, I can drink
more faster ;)

Be patient. Proper conditioning of force carbonation beers takes time. The
shake and dispense method works OK if you are in a hurry but I have found
that the fine bubbles and creamy head happen only after the beer has been
hooked up to the CO2 tank for at least two weeks. Unless you are in a
hurry, try hooking up the keg to the CO2 at the proper psi and waiting two
weeks before tapping.

  OFFICE MEMO          Mint Chocolate Stout Update            Date:11/26/97


    An update on that mint chocolate stout recipe posted this past summer. 
Initially the chocolate flavor was predominant but seems to be mellowing. 
There is a flavor that I associate with the mint but can't describe well,
maybe sharp or refreshing is close.  At any rate, I think I would modify my
previous comments on the mint used based on its current mellowing taste.  I
think I am getting some mint flavor so I might increase the mint in the boil
say 50% next time instead of 100%.  For aroma I will still double the amount
of mint--there was almost no mint aroma.  I had used 1.5oz of mint in the boil
and in the secondary for aroma.  My leaves were slightly wet--rained on brew
day--so my weight measurements might be off.   I think I'll try maybe 2oz in
the boil and 3-4oz in the secondary (vodka soak as before) the next time I
brew.  See previous HBD for recipe if you are interested.

It may be a matter of semantics here but, I was under the impression that 
*cane sugar*, ie. sucrose, was the sugar that was responsible for the 
development of cidery flavors.  Corn sugar is glucose, ie. dextrose, 
sucrose is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose.


Isn't dextrose added to some British ales?  These don't seem to have the
"cidery" flavor attributed to the addition of sugar.  I have never added 
more than a half pound of glucose to any of my homebrews so I may have 
never encounted cidery flavors using it.




Then again, I throw this out to the group from Bob Devine's summary of 
sugars at http://realbeer.com/brewery/library/SugarSumm.html


- ----


Sucrose / table sugar / cane sugar :


  Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of one molecule of glucose and one of
fructose.  More precisely, it is dextrose plus dextrorotary fructose. It 
must be broken apart before the yeasts can use it. When heated in an acidic 
solution (such as wort) the sugar is inverted to make D-(+)-glucose and 
D-(-)-fructose.  Yeasts will invert the sucrose if it is not already in 
that form before using by using invertase. 


<snip>


  A complaint in the early days of modern homebrewing was that using table 
sugar in beer-making resulted in a "cidery" beer. The symptoms were that a 
beer made with table sugar that was added to the boil produced a cidery 
flavor that faded after several weeks in the bottle. Therefore the rule of 
thumb became 'avoid all table sugar'. While this is still a good idea when 
using malt extract, this old-(ale)wives tale is misleading. That defect 
most likely came from poor yeast due to a too low pitch, insufficient 
free-available-nitrogen, or a lack of other necessary yeast building 
materials in the wort. Table sugar can be used in small amounts with no 
harm and it is certainly cheaper to use for priming. 


  This simple colorless sugar will lighten the body of a beer since it can 
be completely fermented. It also lightens the beer color (hmm, negative 
lovibond rating? :-)

Low pitch rate?!  Insufficient nutrients?!




Uh oh, I may have started something..  ;-)

"I just don't seem to get the mouth feel carbonation [from

Kevin,
Although I know a LOT of people who are happy with the results from
forced carbonation, (sticking my neck out here, so no flames!) I don't
like the results myself and always do final conditioning in the keg.


I prime the keg with corn sugar, just use less - about 1/3 cup for a
5-gallon keg (you can play with this amount to achieve specific
carbonation rates).  One thing is important to remember - purge the
headspace of air, and put about 30 psi pressure on the keg when you seal
it.  This will insure that your keg is sealed properly while the yeast
produce the CO2.  The keg seems to condition faster than bottled beer
does, so it is usually ready to drink in 7-10 days.  I don't mind the
wait, since I really prefer the results from keg-conditioned brews.  I
get maybe a half-glass of yeasty ale, then the rest is clear (I always
make sure the beer has dropped clear in the secondary before racking to
the keg).


FWIW, I think the "extra" time involved in keg conditioning also helps
produce a better carbonation.  That is, force-carbonating the keg then
leaving it sit for a week or two would help.


Hope this helps,

Bob,
I brew in Aluminum too, and from what I've learned, you MUST leave that
grungy-looking stain alone - it is apparently some sort of oxide-layer
that develops in all Aluminum cooking vessels, and will contribute no
problems to the brew.  Of course, I am talking about the brownish-gray
looking stains IN the aluminum, not any sort of organic gunk ON the
aluminum... 


I soak my kettle in TSP for 30 - 60 minutes, then wipe it clean with a
plain old sponge.  The TSP (B-brite or any other detergent would work
too) does all the hard work, I just make sure all the organics are wiped
off.


I have never had any off-flavors from this pot (It's made plenty of
batches, and I have earned a few ribbons from those batches), so my
results have been great by doing this.  Anyone have other input?

I've heard recently here and on the HBD that a 122F rest is detrimental to

Also, I have heard from others to use malted wheat and not flaked wheat to

Subject: yeast propagation


does anyone have any suggestions on collecting the yeast from a carboy(used
as a primary fermenter)?  I would like to save/culture the yeast from the
carboy but i'm affraid that it won't pour out easily and i can't find a
utensil long and thin enough to reach down in there to collect ittt. any
suggestionns would be greatly appreciated!
