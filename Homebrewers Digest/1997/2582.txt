I don't see how mouth feel can be added by the head or by the *release*
of carbonation... I would say just the opposite is true.  Also, as others
have posted, the sparkler does indeed cause much of the aromatics in the
beer (especially hop aromatics) to come out suddenly and all at the
beginning of the pint.  By the time the pint is half-consumed, most of
the hop aroma can be long gone.


I've had literally hundreds of beers from both the north and south
and certainly would not characterise either as being generally "watery."
There are individual examples of watery beers from every corner of the
England/Scotland/Wales, but most are not.


The low carbonation levels and cellar temperatures are traditional.
Low OG is a result of the tax laws.  I drink for flavour and not the
alcohol, so in a way, I'm happy, because the brewers there have learned
to make flavourful beers from such low gravities.

I agree that the Noche Buena from the last few year's is not nearly the
product of the early and mid 1980's.  I used to drink this beer religuously
every Christmas season and would comb the city looking for the last
available cases and six packs for the remainder of the year.


Noche Buena used to be my favorite beer but no more.  The newer version is
watery and lacking the rich malt characters.  I also find a phenolic/metalic
flavor in this season's offering as have others which makes the beer even
worse than the last year's versions.


On a scale of 1-5 I would rate this Maerzen/Vienna-style beer as 1.5.  It
no longer is within the style parameters and has very noticable flaws.  I
do not believe that the brewers at Cerveceria Cuautemoc are interested in
making Noche Buena their finest offering of the year and are purely
market driven.


On the six pack it states: 'Noche Buena ("Christmas Eve" in Spanish).'
Not true, Noche Buena translates into "Good Night." Maybe that says it all.


BTW:  Scott--the beer is Noche Buena (not Buena Noche)

Lorne P. Franklin Asks:
Will lagering after bottling mellow and smooth the beer as well as
secondary bulk lagering? Or does it do no good since the beer can not
vent gasses and such?


It depends - is the freezer located in "her kitchen" or "your garage"?
If the freezer is located in her kitchen, I doubt it will lager as
well since it will become confused by you spending more time in the
kitchen than your wife (cross-cooking?). If it's located in your
garage, you will probably have problems as well, because the beer will
not have a male role-model to relate to. (you're in the kitchen
cooking all the time) Beer lagered in this environment has been known
to take on the characteristics of completly opposite styles. Of
course, in your "modern world" of political correctness, this may not
be an issue, but think of the beer. What kind of life will it have, 
growing up in such a restricted, confused world that is always worried
about saying the wrong thing?

Subject: Sparklers or not.


Sparklers or not. Sparklers are the devices on the end of the serving
spout that creates tiny gas bubbles that form the creamy head on a pint
in served in the North of England and increasingly in the South of
England. There are two main types. The old ones which had two half moon
shaped holed which had a gap that could be varied and the Angram design
which is a spray nozzle with between 12 and 14 graded holes. The first
sort was used on the autovac type handpump (now quite rare) the second
is used on swan neck fonts because the sparkler end must be placed
against the bottom of the glass to give just the right amount of head
rather than a glass full of foam. 
All beers change when served through a sparkler. Firstly they loose some
dissolved CO2 - the pressure drop across the sparkler causes this. As a
taste consequence the beer is softer because the CO2 has an acidifying
effect and the sweet/ acid balance of the beer is changed in favour of
the sweet. Some beers (Northern) are brewed more bitter to take account
of this (Bitterness is accented by dissolved CO2) when the final beer is
before the customer the beer should be in balance. One final point is
that the removal of dissolved CO2 means that being not so gassy, the
beer is easier to drink. It was common for people to drink 12 pints a
night. Today beer drinkers are more moderate.


The second thing that happens is that the beers aroma is sort of
smudged. You loose some of the finer flavour points but gain more
impact. I must admit I dont know why this is but it is the main
reason people love or hate sparklers.


I have enjoyed great pints of beer served either way. Our own beers are
made for drinking through a sparkler but also taste great, but
different, without. What matters above all is what the customer wants.
The drinking customers preference should be left unchallenged whatever
the preference of the publican.


Nitrogenated beers (smoothflow) are in vogue at the present. This system
'smudges' the beer flavour more than the 'sparkler'. Its main aim is to
make the customer wait (like the Guinness marketing ploy) while the pint
settles after service.

Subject: Predicting FG Using a 60/70 Mash Schedule


HBD Collective,


In HBD 2579 Al K. explains the difficulty in predicting FG:


>You simply cannot predict the FG accurately enough in most systems and 
>most homebrewers rarely make the same recipe enough times.  Heck, FG can 
>vary with starter size, aeration/oxygnation levels, and fermentation 
>temperature! Even the RIMS brewers may not have enough control over 
>these variables. The pros can do it, but most (all?) of them still use 
>special valves that restrict the CO2 pressure in the conditioning tanks.


I agree with Al that this is very difficult, and I have been collecting 
some date over the last year to try and make predicting FG possible.  
Consider the following all grain brews:


140 F                  PERCENT        
REST          PERCENT STEWED  APPARENT
(MINUTES) SUGAR          MALT          ATTENUATION
38          0.0%          0.0%          77.6%
41          0.0%          3.5%          78.7%
31          7.5%          10.0%          72.9%
21          0.0%          8.0%          70.6%
30          0.0%          7.0%          72.9%
20          0.0%          0.0%          70.4%
60          10.0%          1.1%          79.7%
 0         0.0%   0.0%    62.1% 


 -all percentages are based on total extract
 -sugar is sucrose, glucose, etc. added to the kettle
 -stewed malt is cyrstal, caramel etc.
 -apparent attenuation = (OG-FG)/OG


If a multiple linear regression is peformed using the time spent at 140 F 
as the dependent variable the R squared for the MLR model is 0.97.  This 
means that the 3 variables listed above are very good predictors for 
determining the FG.  In particular, the amount of time the mash is rested 
at 140 F (for the pointy-headed math types the t-stat was 11.5 for this 
variable) can be used to *estimate* the apparent attenuation and thus 
predict the FG.  The above analysis could also be easily done for single 
infusion mashing, but since I use the 60/70 mashing schedule I don't have 
this data available.  Here is the equation to determine the amount of 
time at 140 F to achieve a particular apparent attenuation:


Time `at` 140 F = -162.3 + (259.8*AA) + (115.5*SU) + (0*ST)


AA = desired apparent attenuation
SU = percent of extract as sugar
ST = percent of extract as stewed malt


The variable for stewed malt was omited from the MLR equation because it 
was determined insignificant (t-stat was < 1.0) and eliminating it 
diminished curve-fitting effects.  Example: I am brewing a Tripel and 
desire an AA of 77%, and am adding candi sugar at the rate of 10% of the 
total extract, how long do I rest at 140 F?


Time at 140 F = -162.3 + (259.8 * 0.77) + (115.5 * 0.10) = 50 minutes


Here are the particulars for my brewing:
 -I use RIMS
 -mash thickness is 0.9 qts/lb
 -10 to 15 minutes is needed to raise the temp from 140 to 158
 -the time at 158 F is determined by subtracting 90 from the amount of  
 time spent at 140F
 -500 ml liquid yeast starters
 -yeast is araeted from the boiler to the fermentor via a venturi tube
 -fermentation is deemed complete when the yeast begins to drop (usually  
 after 2 or 3 weeks)
 -lagers fermented at 48-55 F, ales fermented at 62-68 F


This anlaysis needs much more data before it is reliable, but it has been 
useful to me thus far.  The MLR equation could be used by a brewer who 
wants to obtain a particular alcohol content for the finished beer (which 
is a function of the OG and the apparent attenuation) in order to be 
within standardized style guidelines.  


Of course, the standard disclaimer applies, YMMV.

Al K, in a fit of lucent thinking (get the pun?) in HBD #2577 writes:
- ------quote-----------
What you are missing (although I posted it in my second or third
post on the Clinitest, over a year ago) is the fact that yeast eat
the sugars in order of complexity.  I'm not sure if they release
the invertase before or after eating the maltotriose, but they
will certainly have eaten all the glucose, fructose, and maltose
long before you should be even considering to determine whether or
not the fermentation is complete.  If, however, yeast eats maltotriose
*before* it releases the invertase, then we could have sucrose
in the wort at a time when the yeast is slowing down (an eager
brewers might be thinking about calling it done and therefore starting
to measure the sugar content with the Clinitest), *BUT* still have
sucrose in the wort which is very fermentable *AND* does *NOT*
react with the Clinitest.
- ------end quote------------


I think you answered your own question , Al.  If order of complexity is the rule
for fermentation (i.e. simple sugars then disaccharides then trisaccharides)
then sucrose, a disaccharide, is getting fermented before[or with a preference
over] maltotriose.  By inference, that answers the question of when the
invertase is being released...it sure isn't waiting until all the simple sugars
are exhausted.  The evolutionary advantage of beginning to release invertase as
early as possible is also quite clear...the yeast ensure that they are receiving
a continuous supply of simple sugars.


(FWIW, maltose is a disaccharide also.)


Look at it another way...
simple sugars need no bonds to be broken so they get eaten;
disaccharides have one bond to be broken to become simple sugars and get eaten;
trisaccharides have two bonds to be broken to become simple sugars and get
eaten.
When fermentation is tailing off, it is because all the simple sugars are
nearing
depletion, which means the available di- and tri- saccharides have been depleted
also.

I'd sure like it to be a discussion.  (Oh, the irony of *me* saying _that_!)

Subject: Low pH Beer


I recently attempted my first all grain brew, a pale ale. I got 40
litres of extract with no problem but had to put this into two 25 litre
fermenters because I do not have a suitable size container as yet. I
cleaned and sanitised both fermenters identically and pitched the yeast
(obtained from a micro brewery and producing good beer) at the same time
and temperature. This was on the high side at 21=B0C due to the high
ambient temperature. I think one difference came in here in that one
fermenter got slightly more yeast than the other. Fermentation was
evident in about 10 hours in both fermenters but one (the one with more
yeast) produced CO2 more rapidly - I'd guess at 25% faster. After 48
hours the slower one had almost stopped producing CO2 but the other was
still as rapid as when it started. The gravity of both was down from
1045 to 1015.=20
I left both for the full week and racked to secondary fermenters and
after another week bottled. Gravity of both at this stage was 1011.
After 2 weeks in the bottles the slower, shorter fermenting beer tasted
quite good but the other is slightly acidic. pH as measured on indicator
strips are 5 and 3. These are not precise but reflect the difference in
taste. Can anyone offer an explanation? Could this be due to more rapid
fermentaio and if so how? I don't think I got an infection in the beer
as I was very careful and can see no visible signs of bacteria.
Thanks in advance,

Actually, it was. I examined the labels, and lo and behold, in teeny tiny
print, at the bottom of the label,
on the side of the label, practically off the label, it says 'potassium sorbate
added for freshness'.
Ptui! So, I racked it back into the jugs, cleaned my pail, and went out and
bought *non* sorbated
cider.  The sorbated stuff got used up. Some went for hot spiced cider at work,
some for basting the
Thanksgiving turkey, and some is still in the fridge (about a gallon). I'll
prolly spice and heat it this weekend.....


BTW, here's the recipe. It turned out great, and it's quick, too! Only about 6
weeks from pitch to drink!


Yule Cyser


     5 gal pasteurized unsorbated cider
     2 lbs Tupelo honey
     1 lb brown sugar
     1/2 c bottling sugar
     10 cinnamon sticks, broken, palmful allspice, palmful cardamom, crushed
     3 tsp ea orange and lemon peel
     2 pkg Pasteur champagne yeast


     Heat 1 gallon cider to 160 F. Added honey, brown sugar, 5 cinnamon sticks
and rest of
     spices. Stir and simmer for 15 minutes at 160, covering often. Put 3
gallons cider in
     fermenter, cold. Pitched must into this. Pitch yeast with 3.5 tsp nutrient
at 80 F.
     Ferment in primary for 2 weeks. Add remaining gallon to secondary and rack
primary
     onto this. Ferment another 2 weeks. Boil 2 c water with 5 cinnamon sticks
and more of
     other spices (same proportions). Cool and add corn sugar. Mix this into
must and
     bottle. Let condition for at least 2 weeks to carbonate.


     O.G. 1.080 F.G. 1.00


     Note: When I bottled, I bottled half as above, and to the rest I sorbated
it to stop the ferment,
     then added 2 c water boiled for 15 min with cider spices above to which
was added about
     1 lb honey. I added this to the rest of the must and bottled it. First
taste: the first is dry and tart,
      the second a little sweet and spicier, and not carbonated.


     Other Note:  Took a bottle of the carbonated dry down to American
Brewmasters, and with great ceremony
(cracking the bottle, it went *whhoooshh* very nicely) we opened and drank it.
It was quite good,
a little young, but with good legs, and a nice cinnamon aroma and finish. It
packed a pretty good
kick, too!  All in all, a success, I think!

I've noticed a metallic taste (my wife calls it "tinny") in several 
imported beers, most notably some Bocks/Dopplebocks from Germany.  My 
suspicion is that a distributor, exporter or importer may have cleared 
out old, inadequately stored stocks in advance of release of current-year 
product. 


Anyway, I believe it was BJCP guru Scott Bichkam who pointed out to me a 
while back back that he, too, thinks that oxidative effects are one 
source of the metallic taste problem.

Ah, That's the rub.  Many of us consider a 10-18 hour lag time to 
unacceptable, just as we would never consider the typical 24-36 hour lag 
time from  the 50 ml Wyeast packaging to be acceptable, either.  Working 
with a local HB shop to instruct customers on the value of pitching 
suitable quantities of yeast, and provding info on the easy process of 
making starters, I've found that most of the liquid yeast cutomers _are_ 
making starters around here. Why? We've educated them on the benefits of 
doing so.  At least then if they choose not to, they know what to expect.


An what of viability?  I have no way of knowing whether the slurry in the 
"tube yeasts" is even still good unless I make a starter to "proof" it, 
so I might as well work it up to the 3-4 qt starter necessary to get the 
amount of yeast I find gives an acceptable pitching rate and acceptable 
(to me) lag time of 2-4 hours.  The smack packs give me at least a gross 
indication that the yeast inside is still viable.


Granted, using tubes of slurry may save me one step-up (from 50 to 500 
ml) over the 50 ml smack-packs, but at what cost?  I may save a day, 
assuming I've gotten fresh, well-cared-for product, but I'll spend 50 
percent more for the privilege, too. 


BTW, Wyeast has new 175 ml "XL" smack packs, ready to go in 6-12 hours 
after smacking, and are only a little more expensive than the 50 ml guys, 
but cheaper than what tubes of slurry go for.  The XL packs  will save me 
one step as well.  I don't believe the XL packs are directly pitchable, 
as Wyeast claims.  I am planning on trying it out this weekend with the 
1056 by splitting a 10 gallon batch of Amer. Pale Ale - pitching one XL 
pack directly and working one up in a 3-qt starter.  We'll see.

Subject: Extra Large Grain Hopper


Capt Mark is shopping for a grain mill and wants a large hopper. An easy
solution to this is to get a 5 gallon plastic carboy, cut out the bottom,
and use it as a funnel to feed to your mill. I hang one off a hook just
above the grain mill, load it up, and let it rip. It will hold almost 25 lbs
of grain and will feed the mill as it crushes. BTW, the Malt Mill does not
require an adapter to run from a 3/4" drill. The crank comes off and you
tighten the chuck on the shaft.

You were talking about a jump in the refractive index not a change
in density ( although they are related for non-colored substances
and visible light).


I did not say the change in refractive index you observed  was due
to the beta-glucans themselves dissolving, so your point about their
concentration in the wort being below 1% is not relevant.


I said I believed this was due to the action of beta-glucancase on
the beta glucans to produce glucose and was most definitely *not*
due to your assertion that the gelatinization temperature of the
starch had been changed by highly modifying the malt.
Since my post, Andy Walsh provided some great information
which confirms that modification does not change the
gelatinization temperature.


To remake my point and re-interpret your observation in
conventional terms, at 40C these beta-glucanases are active
and  beta-glucanolysis at 40C will produce glucose.  This change
in refractive index at this temperature is due to the released =


glucose from the beta glucans and is what you observed at this
temperature. Because they are less modified,  Pilsner malts have
a higher beta-glucan content than pale ale malts and this may
explain what appears to you to be an unexpected result if you
normally do this experiment with pale ale malts.


I even suggested that you may have backed into a good way to
quantitatively determine the degree of modification as those
lesser modified malts ( e.g. Pilsner) would exhibit a larger
change in the refractive index  when held at this temperature than
the more highly modified malts (e.g. British Pale Ale) .

First question is did you re-energize the yeast by re-starting it in
an oxygenated starter before pitching it? You should do this.


Secondly, if you want to store yeast for a long period do it in
sterile water and not a fermented out beer. This will minimize the
possibilities of infection and the dormant yeast will last longer.


I suggest in the future you collect the yeast from a fermentation,
wash it and store this large quantity under sterile water in a capped
beer bottle in the fridge.  =




Also, always be sure to oxygenate well, as not oxygenating the wort
will cause yeast to lose their ability to attenuate the the wort on
repeated pitching. =

AlK and Spencer Thomas say:


Spencer writes:

I think this statement of Noonan's is open for mis-interpretation,
if not incorrect. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, I assume he
means it is time to transfer it to a secondary fermenter. Fermentation =


continues to 1/4% or less as I read it by Clinitest.


AlK says about Noonan:


>.  One fine example is his
>statement that oxygen dissolves more easily in hot wort than cold!


I say ( with my tongue partially in my cheek):


Another classic example of how Noonan can be misinterpreted.
Maybe he means the *rate* at which it dissolves. This Perhaps
is faster than at low temperatures, but oxygen is definitely not more
soluble ( an equilibrium and not a rate thing) at a higher temperature.
I agree it is at best confusing ( as are many of his statements)
and may be wrong.


AlK says:


>Presuming that Dave is right about Clinitest reading 1/4% sugar
>in most of his beers when they are finished, then 1% as Noonan
>suggests is very likely to cause gushers.


Only if he adds sugar or kraeusens with green beer.  If he put it
into a secondary under pressure at around 1%  it would come to
about the right carbonation.

Subject: Mills, Dry Yeast/Spousal Participation/Kegging vs Bottling


The Cap'n asks about mills.  Just a datapoint from personal experience:


I've been thrilled to death with my new MaltMill (non-adjustable), and seen my
efficiency go from 73% (HB shop adjustable MaltMill) to 83%.  I've since
helped the HB store adjust the mill to a better crush.  In any case, I built a
hopper (which I've named Dennis) out of a plastic 5-gal carboy and a small
piece of plywood.  Cut the bottom out of the carboy (cut a circle smaller than
the actual bottom diameter; the leftover edge will lend mechanical strength).
Drill a hole (use a holesaw) in the plywood to accept the carboy's mouth.  Put
the carboy bottoms-up into the plywood and set on top of the mill and
 -voila'!- instant hopper.  Will hold at least 20 to 25 lb grain, but I'd mill
this much in separate batches to prevent it from tipping.


*****


Here's an anecdote that covers the dry yeast, spousal approval/disapproval, as
well as bottling versus kegging threads:


My wife suggested a few weeks ago that I brew a "gift beer" for the holidays.
I thought that sounded swell (we did it last year, to all our friends' joy) so
I whipped up a batch of an amber ale I've made before that I really liked.
This time, figuring I had a bit more latitude to experiment, I used Danstar
Nottingham dry yeast instead of the Wyeast ESB liquid in the original (I've
used it before in spiced and pumpkin brews, but never in a "normal" beer).  I
found it to provide a nice transparency that really allowed the malt and hops
to shine separately but equally; the contribution from the ESB yeast was
apparently muddying up the flavor profile.  Very clean, excellent performance.
I suspect something like a 1056 would do the same, but the point is that this
particular brand of dry yeast is every bit as good IMHO as liquid yeast, and
much easier to use.


Continuing...last weekend was bottling day, but what I did differently this
year was to keg/force-carbonate and counterpressure-bottle the whole batch
(see my web page or the Spring '97 Zymurgy for plans for a cheap-ass home-made
bottler that really works nicely).  Last year's beer was bottle conditioned.
Most of our target audience likes "premium" beer, but sediment in the bottles
is still a turnoff for the general public.  This was the first time I ever
considered CP'ing the whole batch.  I found that with my wife's help (I fill,
she caps), I knocked out the bottling in *LESS* time than I normally used to
spend on priming/bottling!


My wife has always been "skeptical" about kegging; she prefers the portability
and give-ability of bottles, while I think grabbing a 6-ounce pour after work
is a nice alternative to having to open a 12-ounce bottle (never mind being
sure that there are bottles in the fridge in the first place!), especially as
I try to limit my alcohol intake.  Now I think I'll consider doing this more
often, especially with "specialty beers", while leaving my "house beers" on
tap.  Best of both worlds?  All y'all wanting to brew for parties or weddings,
but unsure about wither sediment in bottles or lugging kegs and tanks, should
consider this option.


Tuesday I racked at 65F to the keg, hit it with about 40 psi, did the shake,
rattle, and roll thing for about five minutes, then put it in the fridge (at
about 40F).  Next morning it had settled at about 18 psi, putting me in the
high-two's of CO2 volumes.  My experience has been that CP-bottled beer will
lose a bit of CO2 in the process, so I aimed high for that reason.  The day of
the show (Saturday) I bled the pressure, then put normal serving pressure on
it and bottled away.  A sample bottle opened a couple days later was a tad
fizzy for a "traditional" draft ale but right on target for typical commercial
bottled stuff.


Nothing new here but thought I'd share for the benefit of those still not sure
about going to liquid yeast, and for those wondering "which is better --
bottles or kegs?".  And also to brag on my wonderful wife Delia, without whose
support and encouragement (as well as tasting feedback) I wouldn't be enjoying
this hobby nearly as well.

Subject: Re:  Iodine test sample pretreatment


     Hi all,
     
     Dave Burley once again says that you should boil your mash sample 
     before conducting an iodine test.  He claims:
     
     >2) in an infusion mash not all of the starch may be available 
     >immediately to the solution since it may be physically trapped >and 
     why I boil to release it.
     
     That is exactly why you should NOT boil the sample!!!
     
     You said it yourself, Dave:  "NOT ALL OF THE STARCH MAY BE AVAILABLE"
     
     If all of the starch isn't available to enzymatic conversion at mash 
     conditions, then you will ALWAYS get a POSITIVE iodine test (black = 
     starch is present) when you boil the sample because you will release 
     the trapped starch.
     
     No chemical reaction is 100% efficient.  There will ALWAYS be some 
     starch left in the mash.  Most of this unconverted (heathen) starch 
     will be found within the confines of poorly crushed grain pieces.  In 
     less modified malts some may be found bound up in the protein matrix 
     of the malt.
     
     These trapped starch particles will only be made available to the 
     solution upon heating above normal mash temperatures.  That used to be 
     the whole point of decoction mashing (increased conversion 
     efficiency), and one reason it is bad to use overly hot water for 
     sparging (release of heathen starch into the wort).
     
     If you follow Dave's advice, you will NEVER get a negative iodine 
     test, no matter how long you mash.  I would really hate to read about 
     somebody getting turned off of all-grain brewing because they mashed 
     for 10 hours trying to achieve 100% conversion efficiency using Dave's 
     iodine test method.
     
     Have fun!

Subject: RE: Return of the RollerMill Thread!


Marc Battreal asked for opinions on the Valley Mill vs. the Schmidling
MaltMill...


Marc,
I recently went through the same dilemma.  For what its worth, I had
decided on the Valley Mill, due to its easy adjustability (pre-set gap
spacings on a hand-turned dial), large hopper, and lower cost for an
adjustable mill (important for me, since I like to use raw wheat).


However, I was lucky enough to find a local HB Club member that was
selling his old JS MaltMill ("old" being the operative term here) for
$30.  It is one of the original models, and has the adjustable spacing.
I have used it for several all-grain batches, and my only complaints are
pretty minor:
1)        The second roller is not gear driven, but driven by friction
generated by a rubber ring (kind of like a smooth rubber gear, if you
will).  Unless the adjustable model is spaced "just right", the second
roller won't turn at all.  I do not know offhand how the Valley Mill
turns its second roller, but it might be a consideration for you.
        NOTE:  Anyone in the HBD collective have any advice on providing
better traction on the second roller when milling hard, small grains?
(eg, raw wheat)


2)        The MaltMill's tiny hopper.  I don't have a permanent brew
setup, so I can't really mount the mill anywhere or have a big hopper,
so it really almost becomes a two person job (one to crank, the other to
pour the malt into the hopper).


Overall, the MaltMill churns through malt so fast (10 lbs. In 2-3
minutes) I haven't bothered to use my electric drill on it.  I probably
won't unless I am doing a 10 gallon batch.  I usually run the grain
through twice, and it provides a really nice crush.


If I had to buy a new mill again, I would probably still go with the
Valley Mill for the same reasons above, but I am very satisfied with the
JS MaltMill.


Hope this helps!

Questions: How do I adjust the recipe to 3 Gal. size. May I assume, and I hate

there will be considerable head space in my fermenting carboy, does this
