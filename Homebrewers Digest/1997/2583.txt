Subject: Denature temperature of Pectin Enzyme


What is the optimal temperature of Pectin Enzyme and when is it denatured?
I recently made a fruit mead which I held at 145 deg for 15 min to
pasteurize it.  I do not like using Camden and I didn't want to boil the
honey.  I added the peptic enzyme at 145 deg and I'm not sure if the
temperature was too hot for it to work.  The only references that I have
found deal with using it with a Camden process that doesn't include heat.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

George De Piro expresses his concerns about the new AHA
Vienna/Oktoberfest 
guidelines.


I can't agree more with you, George.  I'm afraid that what we're slowing
seeing
is the americanisation of beer styles.  This, of course, being driving
by the AHA.
I'm not saying that brewers abroad are changing their recipes to suit
Americans.
What's actually happening is that brewers on this continent by-and-large
really
don't have a clue what a real Vienna, Oktoberfest, Alt, Kolsch (the list
goes on)
tastes like.  Slowly what we're seeing is that the competitions are
being 
overwhelmed by beers that aren't at all brewed to style.  So instead of
rejecting these beers out-right, the AHA slowly migrates the styles
guidelines
to suit the submissions.


Within 5 years I predict that the only beers we'll see in AHA
competitions
are "American-XXX".  i.e. Americanised versions of all our favorite beer
styles.


Completely unforgivable, IMO.

Alan recently posted a question on whether an opening  
in a SS fermenter should be large or small.  I say go  
for a large opening!  I use a  10" opening in my  
converted keg primary fermenter.  During fermentation,  
I just put a stock pot lid on top.  This system has  
worked very well for 7 batches with no infections.   
After moving to open primary ferments, I am never  
going back!  The large opening makes cleaning a snap and 
easy sanitation and large volume make converted keg 
primary fermenters great.  To top it off, I got this 
keg for $5 at a garage sale!

I've done an experiment on this and published my results in Brewing
Techniques.  The bottom line is: the only significant difference between
blowing off (or skimming) the dirty head and letting it fall back into
the beer is the bitterness.  You lose about 15% of the bitterness if
you remove the dirty head in some way (dropping is another way).

Bad choice of words... "adjuncts" are non-enzymatic sources of starch
(e.g. potatoes, unmalted grains, etc.).  Dave Line has used saccarine
to sweeten beers, but the snag is that it's also bitter, so you have to
back-off on the bitterness a little.

No.  You must boil uncovered (at least part of the boil and ideally,
during the whole boil) or you will have excessive DMS in your finished
beer.  It will smell like cooked corn.

Some lager yeasts make excessively sulphury beer.  Other ones (like
Wyeast #2035) make very nice, delicious ales.

Absolutely, but more accurately, the pH of the *mash* is what is important.

This implies that we can use hardware store hydrochloric (Muriatic)
acid for brewing.  While it may be perfectly okay, I feel it is much
safer to use only FDA-approved, or "food grade" acids.


On a related note, I wonder how many homebrew supply stores are selling
sidewalk salt as calcium chloride... this stuff is definitely not
food grade and can contain all kinds of impurities.  I've heard some
can be poisonous, but don't know for sure.

Are you sure about this?  I thought that phytase is what acts upon the
phytin.   I suspect that because phytin works around 90F, that boiling
would certainly denature it.  Is this simply *another* way for the H+
to be released?

I'd like to hear more... could you post more details of this experiment?
When you write "full-sparge" I presume you mean "fly sparge" or
"continuous sparge," as opposed to the "fill, drain, fill, drain..."
of batch sparging, right?  If I don't have this right, could you also
give details on this?

You can buy toasted flaked barley from the UK.  When I was a retailer,
I believe I got it from L.D.Carlson (a homebrew wholesaler).  It wasn't
roasted... it had a nice "breakfast cereal" character.

Subject: Aqua yeast ranching & botulism


Hey Neighbors,


I've had good luck freezing yeast so last week I thought I would try
storing yeast under distilled water. I could not find much literature on the
subject so I made most of the procedure up as I went. 


Poured yeast from bottom of fermenter into gallon jug, let settle, poured
off beer, froze half and put the other half into sanitized mason jars and
poured distilled water right from the jug on top of the yeast, put on lid and
placed on shelf in a dark cool room. I thought I should have boiled the
distilled water but I figured distilled water was pure and by this point I
just couldn't do one more step.


Then I started to thinking.... this seems too easy, what keeps this from
spoiling or yes.....BOTULISM. 


Yes I am paranoid. You guys saved my life. I used to be very careless
with my canning and wort storing procedures before the "botulism"
thread. Now I just make up fresh wort each time but this yeast under
water has me a little nervous. By the way the Ph of my beer was 4.5 at
racking time so I guess the yeast is at Ph 4.5, this should help. Can any
one with more experience help me or lead me to some literature for this
intriguing process.

Subject: Conical Fermenter Idea




Hello All,


I just had an idea for a cheap easy way to build a conical fermenter with
bottom drain spigot.


How about using 6 inch PVC pipe, fitted with reducers and a valve at one
end, and capped at the other, attached to a verticle stand?  I calculate
that 24.5 liters (approx 6.5 gallons) would require a 4.5 foot length of
pipe that would be easily manageable.


Would there be a problem using PVC to ferment in? and then using as a
secondary for a couple of weeks? Any comments? or are some ideas better left
to die a natural death?  Private or public response, your choice.


Thanks,

Marc,


I'll put my vote in for the Valley Mill, although you won't go wrong
with either.  I'll also strongly vote for going with an adjustable mill,
regardless of who's mill you buy.  EVEN THOUGH Jack Schmidling will
respond and say he gets fine results with smaller kernels such as wheat
with the fixed-gap MaltMill, I much prefer being able to tighten the
mill one click and get a perfect crush with the smaller grains.  Plus if
you decide to experiment with any other grains such as sorghum
(downright tiny), you'll appreciate the adjustability.  You'll have the
mill for many years, so you may as well get the best.


Anyway, back to the Valley Mill.  Yes, the factory built hopper is much
larger and carries about 8 or 9 lbs of grain.  The latest version of the
mill has steel bearings.  I think Jack uses solid rollers on his mill,
and I don't know if the Valley Mill has solid or hollow, but believe me,
it makes less difference to your mill than how much running over a fly
affects the ride in your car.  The drill adapter is easy to use.  I use
a DeWalt cordless drill to run mine and the grain just whips right
through the mill and comes out perfect.  I've got maybe a couple hundred
pounds of grain through it.  Before I bought it, I spoke to a guy at a
brew-on-premises (BOP) in Nashville where I was visiting on business
about his usage of the mill.  He had one installed for his clientele,
and had it motorized with a pulley, belt, and some kind of an old
electric motor.  He'd had it installed and used daily for 2 years and it
still worked like new.  Mine is still like new too, I just blow the
grain stuff out after each use and put it away.  It quickly disassembles
and stores in a small flat area in one of my boxes of homebrew stuff.  I
really think that you could buy one of Jack Schmidling's MaltMills, or
go with the Valley Mill and do just fine.  I see them as being fairly
equivalent, both are beyond anyone's requirements for quality and
durability.  The adjustability and larger hopper for a smaller price
than Jack's smaller-hopper and nonadjustable mill was what helped me
decide, and I've never regretted it.  Jack's caught a lot of flack for
his small hopper and for the nearly unavailability of the adjustable
mill ... I don't know why he doesn't add a larger hopper and work harder
at selling the adjustable mill.  Stuck in his ways I guess.  Causes
business to go to other outfits though.


Good luck, and feel confident about any of the choices you've listed.
They're all fine machines.

Subject: Cylindriconical Fermenter


I think Frank Kalcic started the fermenter thread.  I've been
exchanging E-mail with Frank offline.  Since there seems to be extended
interest, I thought that I'd pass this along...


  I had a cylindriconical fermenter made from a 10 gallon Cornelius
keg.  The bottom of the keg was cut off and a 60o cone was welded in its
place.  The cone was fashioned from two "half-cone" pieces of stainless
steel.  The tip of the cone was welded to a 1" standard male pipe thread
fitting.  I use a 1" brass ball valve.  The capacity of the fermenter is
approximately 12 gallons.


  I understand the issue of threaded versus sanitary fittings and
valves.  But I paid $45 for the used Cornelius keg.  The cone and
fitting were welded for free.  I couldn't justify putting a $150 valve
on a $50 fermenter.  If I have problems with infection, I will consider
replacing the fitting and the valve.


  This is the information that I have on the welding and
electro-polishing techniques that were used to assemble the fermenter. 
The information is somewhat second-hand and I can't say if it is
completely accurate.  The outfit that did the work makes food processing
equipment for the Kellogg's company.  If I get more information, I will
pass it along.

  I have only been using the fermenter for about a month.  I'm currently
fermenting my fifth batch of beer in it with no signs of infection
(knock on wood).


 I've been using the bottom drain to purge the trub and yeast which has
settled into the tip of the cone.  This seems to be very effective.
Currently, I have been siphoning the beer into a five gallon glass
secondarying using a racking cane.  Ultimately, I plan to leave the
wort/beer in the fermenter for two weeks, purging the trub and yeast
after a week and using an extended beer-out dip tube and CO2 pressure to
transfer the beer to a keg (beer-out to beer-out).


  I can't recommend this approach, yet, only because I don't have enough
experience to say that the design and the use of a threaded fitting
aren't prone to infection.  I think that the existing keg fittings, dip
tube and port work beautifully in the fermenter application.  Of course,
it would be nice if the port were a little larger for cleaning, but this
is true of any Cornelius keg.

My objections to this method are based upon more than 10 years of
brewing and reading brewing texts and journals, and were explained in
the past...  perhaps not with enough detail.  I'll try again...


If you simply take a sample of the liquid part of the mash and
test it with iodine, any colour is a reaction with the starch
that remains in solution in the mash.  This is what we *really*
want to test.  We want to stop mashing when the starch in solution
is converted.


If you boil a sample which contains some grain, you are releasing 
starch that is *inaccessable* to the enzymes.  It is an *unrepresentative*
sample of the mash.  What do we care if there is some starch still left
that is *stuck* in the steely tips of the malt?  Our enzymes
*can't* reach it.


That said, I don't do the iodine test at all... I adjust my pH (usually
unnecessary), use a MaltMill(tm) for milling my malts/grains and mash
a specific length of time (at least 1 hour at or above 155F and at least
1.5 hours below 155F).

George,


No.  You haven't.  What you have read is the "almost final version" of the
1998 AOB Style Guidelines.  I know, I sent them to you.  We do use the
AOB's final version as a starting point for the AHA's guidelines, but the
two don't necessarily have to match exactly.  These two sets of guidelines
have different publishing deadlines.


We offered the "almost final version" of the 1998 AOB Style Guidelines to
IBS and AHA members, BJCP judges and other groups and individuals to
solicit their input on suggested changes.  I did explain in the
accompanying note that all suggested changes would be considered.  I also
said that if the suggested change was a major one, it would have to be
table to next year's guideline revisions.

You are not being ignored.  Your suggestions have been grouped with all the
suggested revisions (and we've received quite a few) and are now going
through the evaluation process.  The Association of Brewers will, again,
consider all suggestions and solicit input from various industry experts as
well as take historical aspects and scientific profiles of the styles into
account.


I want to also mention that this is a continuing process from year to year.
 We are always open to suggested revisions of the AOB or AHA Beer Style
Guidelines.  This year we made a more concerted effort to make the "almost
final version" of the guidelines available to a larger group, directly
soliciting and encouraging input.  


It was my idea to post the offer on the BJCP's JudgeNet, and it is
important to have a dialogue about your concerns.  Everyone that has
requested the guidelines for review will be receiving an email explaining
which suggested changes were accepted and which were not and why.  We just
aren't that far yet.

Actually, the 1998 AHA Style Guidelines for Vienna and Marzen/Oktoberfest
are the same as they were in 1996.


The change that you are referring to in the 1998 AOB Style Guidelines is:


1997 version, "Fruity esters are minimal, if perceived at all."  was
changed to:
1998 version, "Fruity esters may be minimally perceived." 


This isn't a big change.

One note on strengthening your argument is to provide examples of the
traditional Oktoberfests with the higher gravities.  I don't mean the
actual beers. (Although I would be happy to receive them!)  What I mean is
the statistics (O.G., F.G., alc/vol, etc..).  I want to reiterate that the
AOB and AHA are listening, but your suggestions have a better chance of
being approved if you prove your case with facts, such as specific beers,
history, published reports, references, etc.  This is the criteria that we
use to make revisions.

Someone posted a note about starting a siphon with a rubber bulb to fill
the siphon.  


Another idea:  Use what we use everyday here at the toxicology lab- squirt
bottles (the kind of bottles they use to squirt Rocky Balboa as they
scream "Get in their and pulverize that guy!").  It has a thin tip so it
easily fits into your siphon tube.  I don't know where you'ld buy one.
Maybe at your local Don King boxing outlet.

Subject: American Porters


George De Piro says:
|John asks what kind of beer he made by fermenting a porter wort with a
|lager yeast.
|
|The answer is very simple:  a porter!


In the Mar/Apr 97 issue of Brewing Techniques, Ben Jankowski's article
on American Porters proposes a couple of porter sub-styles (pre-flame
disclaimer - I am not, nor have I ever been accused of brewing to
style!) using bottom-fermented yeast:
    "Pennsylvania porter...is a bottom-fermented, ester-free beer with
     fair-to-medium mouthfeel.
    "Prosperity porter can be bottom or top fermented and has a chewy
     dextrin mouthfeel..."


The article also provides three "Classic American Porter Recipes".  The
Pennsylvania Porter suggests Wyeast New Ulm or St Louis American Lager
yeasts.  The Happy Valley recipe suggests Wyeast California Common lager


yeast.


George's example of Yuengling Porter as a bottom-fermented porter is
right on point.  I used to consume and enjoy Yuengling Porter by the
case when I lived in Philadelphia's Art Museum district some years ago
(because you could only buy beer by the case back then).  The Brewing
Techniques article has a table showing the strengths/gravities of
American porters such as Yuengling, Sierra Nevada and Anchor.


All in all, a very informative article.

Fellow beer connoisseurs,


At last nights planning committee meeting of our brewclub, the Kenwood
Fermenters, I volunteered to host the March meeting on Octoberfest 
beers.  I would like suggestions of where to find some reference
materials so 
I can give a good class on that style of beers, including the why's and
where fores of the beer.  


I have limited  access  to the WWW so book type printed references will
be greatly appreciated.


In closing, I have one last thing to say:


Eat you heart out Bill!!!!


Thank you.

Subject: Dispense Pressure


Mike McKay posted an article describing his draught system in a chest freezer.
He keeps his dispense pressure set at 8 lbs and claimed to keep a Kolsch
carbonated at 3.3 vols at 48 degrees for 6 months.  Sorry Mike, if your chest
freezer is at 48 Degrees and your pressure is set at 8 lbs, your carbonation
will be about 1.8 vols or less.  I have no doubt that your Kolsch stayed
carbonated for 6 months, that means your kegs dont leak!  If you actually
carbonated your kolsch at 26 lbs, you would have about 3.3. Vols, but unless
you keep your dispens pressure set that high, every glass you pour increases
the headspace in your keg and nibbles away at that carbonation level.  The
trick to a properly designed draught system is to decide ahead of time what
temp you want to serve at and what level of Carbonation you want (most ales
are around 2.5 vols, most lages are at 3 or higher)  Now use the following
chart to set your pressure, and it will be the same for carbonating and
dispensing, this is called a balanced system, one setting, no dinking around.


Volume  2   2.2   2.4   2.6   2.8   3
40F    6.8   9    11.2 13.4  15.5 17.7
42F    7.7   10   12.2 14.4  16.7 18.9
44F    8.6  10.9  13.2 15.5  17.8 20.1
46F    9.5  11.8  14.2 16.6  19   21.3
48F   10.4  12.8  15.3 17.7  20.1 22.6
50F   11.3  13.8  16.3 18.8  21.3 23.8
52F   12.2  14.8  17.3 19.9  22.5 25.1
54F   13.1  15.7  18.4 21.1  23.7 26.3
56F   14    16.7  19.5 22.2  24.9 27.6
58F   15    17.8  20.6 23.3  26.1 28.9
60F   15.9  18.8  21.6 24.5  27.4 30.2




Now, the way you balance a system is by adjusting the length of your hose, a
3/16th id flexible beverage hose give 3 lbs of pressure drop per foot, so if
you want 3.3 vols at 48degrees, you would need to carbonate at about 25 lbs,
now if you served at 25 lbs with a short hose, it would be like shooting beer
out of a fire hose at full blast.  start with 9 feet of hose between the keg
and tap, you should have a gentle flow, about an ounce a second if memory
serves correctly, with a nice head, not too much foam.  If the beer is coming
out too slow, start lopping off hose about 6" at a time.  Make sure your hose
has no kinks, this will cause turbulence in the lines and a lot of foam.


Good Luck!

Not just any old anonymous Zymurgy tip, but one by yours truly, first
posted here and then in Z.  I called it a "30 Cent Beer Engine," but
someone else suggested the name "Pocket Beer Engine."  Wish I'd thought of
that.  I think there's a product with a ready name there for someone.


Anyhow, try it.  It really is neat.  But be careful.  After I posted here,
I got lots of positive feedback, but one brewer chipped a tooth using it!
It seems that he didn't allow enough head room on a well carbonated beer,
and to prevent the foam overflowing, he lunged forward to sip it off and
hit his tooth on the glass.  I suppose the manufacturer of such a product
would have been liable.  Good Lord, maybe I'll get sued.  Will you defend
me, Louis?


Ah, the hazards of beer.

In HBD #2580, Tom Clark asks about topping off his boiling wort with
boiling water.


I do something similar.  I too use a 6-gallon brewpot, which isn't quite
big enough to hold all the wort after sparging an all-grain batch.  So I
add as much to the brewpot as will fit comfortably without danger of
boilover, and then I start a smaller 5-quart "staging" pot boiling with
some of the remaining wort.  Once the the wort in the brewpot starts
boiling and the foaming subsides, I add boiling wort from the smaller
pot to top it off.  Then I add more to the smaller pot and get it
boiling again (much faster than the large pot) and top off when enough
evaporates from the brewpot.  This way I end up with a full five gallons
at the end of the boil.


Works for me.

In HBD #2579, Charles Hudak was looking for a recipe for Courage
DIRECTOR'S BITTER. I found this one in "Brew Your Own REAL ALE at Home"
by Graham Wheeler and Roger Protz (Published by CAMRA):

In the mash tun
Pale malt:               4150g (82%)
Crystal malt:             380g (7.5%)
Black malt:                25g (0.5%)


In the copper

Mash temperature:        66 degrees C.
Mash time:                90 minutes
Boil time:                2 hours

Bitterness:                34 EBU
Final volume:                23 litre.


NOTES
Courage Directors is parti-gyled with Courage Best Bitter, and therefore
shares the same grist. In fact, the Bristol brewery pactises high
gravity brewing, whereby they brew only on ehigh gravity beer (about OG
1053). This standard beer is then diluted at the casking stage with
de-oxygenated and UV sterilised water. The only difference between the
range beers is the amount of water and caramel added when they cask it.
They also use a whirlpool and therefore use hop pellets.

IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUERY


RECIPES


        This is in response to your inquiry regarding the copyright
registration of recipes. Mere listings of ingredients as in recipes,
formulas, compounds or prescriptions are not subject LIBRARY to
copyright protection.  However, where a recipe or formula is
accompanied by substantial literary expression in the form of an
explanation or directions, or when there CONGRESS is a combination
of recipes as in a cookbook, there may be a basis for copyright
protection.


Protection under the copyright law (Title 17 of the United States
Code, Section 102)
extends only to "original works of authorship" that are fixed in a
tangible form (a copy).
"Original" means merely that the author produced the work by his
own intellectual effort,
as distinguished from copying a preexisting work. Copyright
protection may extend to
a description, explanation, or illustration, assuming that the
requirements of the copyright law are met.


To register the directions or instructions of a recipe or cookbook,
send the following three elements in the same envelope or package
to the Register of Copyrights, Copyright Office, Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C. 20559.


1. A completed application Form TX;
2. A nonrefundable filing fee of $20.00;
3. A nonreturnable deposit of the work. The deposit requirements
depend on whether
the work has been published at the time of registration:
 If the work is unpublished, one complete copy.
 If the work was first published in the United States on or after
January 1, 1978,
two complete copies of the best edition.
 If the work was first published in the United States before
January 1,1978, two
complete copies as first published.
 If the work was first published outside of the United States, one
complete copy
of the work as first published.
 If the work is a contribution to a collective work, and published
after January
1, 1978, one complete copy of the best edition of the collective
work.


Copyright protects only the particular manner of an author's

How Long Does Copyright Registration Take?


        A copyright registration is effective on the date of receipt in
the Copyright Office of all
the required elements in acceptable form, regardless of the length
of time it takes to
process the application and mail the certificate of registration. The
length of time required
by the Copyright Office to process an application varies from time
to time, depending on
the amount of material received and the personnel available to
handle it. It must also be
kept in mind that it may take a number of days for mailed material
to reach the Copyright
Office and for the certificate of registration to reach the recipient
after being mailed to the
Copyright Office.
        You will not receive an acknowledgement that your application
for copyright registra-
tion has been received (the Office receives more than 500,000
applications annually), but
you may expect:
 A letter or telephone call from a copyright examiner if further
information is needed;
and
 A certificate of registration to indicate the work has been
registered, or if the
application cannot be accepted, a letter explaining why it has been
rejected.
You might not receive either of these until at least 120 days have
passed.
        If you want to know when the Copyright Office receives your
material, you should
send it via registered or certified mail and request a return receipt.

Subject: Beer Bugs


Tad in Athens (Georgia) asks about freezing bugs.  At last something
I know about,...being cold.


Tad doesn't describe his bugs, but they are probably what we call
grain weevils around here, a little beetley thing that refuses to
become extinct.


Sorry Tad, but I don't think your winter's going to get rid of them.
I know you're having a 'helluva' winter this year and may have to put
on a sweater soon, but I doubt your having a cold enough spell to do
much harm to these demons.  They seem able to go dormant for a while,
then once you warm them up, they start walking all over your grain
again.  The center of your grain bucket may not even get much below
freezing what with all that grain insulating it.  Even if all the
bugs did freeze, they probably have a scazillion egs in the grain
husks just waiting to hatch when conditions permit.


I really don't think you'll get rid of the pests, so learn to live in
harmony with them.  Freezing them prior to crushing your grain will
help the beetles crack into several uniform size pieces (textbook), and 
their exoskeletons will aid in sparging.


Use this grain up and thoroughly clean yor grain bin before
re-use.  I don't know how small a weevil egg is, but I'm quite
certain you don't want to leave any in your bin for the next batch of
grain.


Now, let me tell you about the winters when I was a boy,......




Paul in Vermont, where it's 20 degrees colder than Jeff Renner.

You know, I kind of liked Ebeneezer Scrooge before
all those ghosts scared the good sense out of him.
