From: Joe Stone <joestone`at`cisco.com>
Subject: Fermentation Pressure


Bret Schuhmacher referred to Dion Hollenbeck's use of an adjustable
pressure relief valve to vent a Cornelius keg.  Dion's technique
involves replacing the stainless steel spring of a 25-50 PSI Norgren
pressure relief valve with a Cornelius poppet spring to form a 15-40 PSI
pressure relief valve.


  Is there a general "rule of thumb" in terms of fermentation pressure? 
I assume that there is a reason why Dion felt the need to drop the
Norgren pressure relief valve down into the 15-25 PSI range.  At what
point does pressure begin to affect fermentation?

I would certainly not advocate (or even admit to) the use of hardware
store HCl in brewing in this forum. The intent was only to illustrate
that there is quite a bit of acid in a couple of pounds of black malt.


And then...

>Are you sure about this?


No!  I think what happens is something like the following.  Malt
contains the mixed calcium/magnesium salt of phytic acid and the enzyme
phytase catalyzes hydrolysis of this salt to phytic acid. The phytic
acid is then further hydrolyzed to myo-inositol and inorganic phosphate
and the inorganic phosphate reacts with any calcium present to form the
phosphate which precipitates causing, respectively, monohydrogen and
dihydrogen phosphate to release H+ ions and convert to, respectively,
phosphate and monohydrogen phosphate. Thus, while both pilsner and ale
malts are kilned to an extent which allows phytase to survive and
presumably therefore roughly equal amounts of phytic acid are produced
at dough-in the boil of a decoction hydrolyzes more of this phytic acid
than would be hydrolyzed without it so that more phosphate is released
which, providing calcium is present, releases more H+ into the mash.

Are you sure you don't mean "New Brewer"? I haven't seen the Dec/Jan  BT
so perhaps you don't but NB did have an article on whirlpools in the
last issue.

Subject: re: Carboy Spigots


Mark:


I recently called the local wholesaler who was listed on one of those ads
for the "Siphonless Carboy" to see if they were indeed selling them. I
thought it would be a good thing to sell in my shop providing it worked as
indicated and was well designed. It turns out that the wholesaler did not
stock them, was not aware of the ad, and had to return the sample sent to
him because it had cracks in it from the hole drilled. It was also
difficult, if not impossible, to consistently assemble/remove the
coffee/urn-type spigot with the long handled plastic wrench included. The
manufacturer told him that due to the drilling process involved, there was
always going to be a certain percentage of carboys that would have cracks.
The wholesaler, at that point, has refused to carry this product until
those problems have been corrected. It is our combined opinion that these
problems cannot be corected for a reasonable price, if at all. The glass is
thin through the middle of a carboy, and this makes drilling difficult. I
know some of you have done it successfully, but for a manufacturer to claim
they can do it with consistency is very unlikely.


So, at least we have conscientous people in the industry looking out for
us. I was approached by the manufacturer about a year ago to buy this
product directly and I had the same reservations, compounded by the fact
that it would retail for at least twice the price of a regular carboy (and
who wants to pay $35 or more for a carboy with a $3 spigot attached?). With
the information gotten from the wholesaler, I do not plan on carrying this
item. Caveat Emptor!

Neal Parker asked about simple "in line" sterile filters for aquarium air
pumps.  I've found a suitable 0.2um pore size sterile filter unit housing
with small hose barb fittings on each end.  I will be ordering a box of
them to use with my aquarium pump.  If you or anyone else is interested I
can send you one filter for $12US each which includes shipping.

Subject: marris otter defense


The suggestion that Marris-Otter can cause stuck sparges is once again popping
up in HBD posts.  I thought I'd provide a data point in defense of this
excellent malt.  A couple years ago, through very happy coincidence, I
acquired about 300 pounds of Marris-Otter from Beeston Malting Company for
next to nothing.  I used it exclusively for about a year in both single and
multiple temperature infusion mashes.  My mash/lauter tun has a perforated SS
false bottom and I usually do a 167f mash out.  I NEVER had a stuck sparge
with it or even a slow sparge.


(BTW, there's nothing like having 300 pounds of grain in the basement to give
you that nice warm fuzzy feeling that all is right with the world!)

jot down some of my advice on how to get ready for the test while this stuff
is fresh in my mind.


I know there are lots of others that subscribe to this digest that can
clarify, correct, enhance what I=92ve come up with and I hope they do.


First, if you have access to the WWW, make sure to check out the BJCP home
page at WWW.BJCP.ORG. You=92ll find test schedules, locations, study guides,
style guidelines and email addresses for further information there. Its a
great place to start.


The test places a large emphasis on understanding and differentiating beer
styles. Style definitions are an attempt to set up an objective set of
criteria to measure creative recipes and processes (and the results thereof)
to some kind of common, agreed upon, standard. Its a difficult process to 1)
set those guidelines and 2) defend them, as can be witnessed by several
recent discussion threads on this subject. But its all we have and until
someone comes up with something better, that=92s what we have to strive to
become good at, understanding and interpreting what the guidelines mean and
how to evaluate a beer against those guidelines.


That said, there=92s always the classical science and the process of brewing
that=92s well covered in the exam also. Its just that the science part of it
is fairly easy due to all the text available to read, reread and memorize. I
can=92t tell you how many times I went back and re-read Dave Miller=92s
discussion of malts in his Handbook of Homebrewing. Its a very good
reference (imho).


Our group consisted of me and 3 others. I was the neophyte, having only
about 18 months of brewing under my belt before starting, and only about a
year of that doing all grain brews. The others had been brewing for many
years and had all been judging beers albeit without certification. They knew
styles inside and out and the science/process was pretty much old hat to
them. I used and abused them as much as possible, asking as many stupid
questions as I could think of every time we met.


We followed the outline from Brewing Techniques (Scott Bickam, May-August
97). We did 9 sessions, once a week for 9 weeks and skipped the DR Beer
session (although I wanted to do it, nobody else was interested). A lot of
what happened in those sessions was a little frustrating for me. My palate
has never been trained to enjoy or understand complex flavors. I knew the
difference between sweet and sour, but how about bitter and astringent? It
takes a lot (lot!) of practice. I feel like my palate is beginning to become
trained, but it will take lots more beer drinking before I=92m really
comfortable about discerning aromas and flavors accurately. Good reason to
practice!


The outline in BT included a technical discussion for each tasting session.
This was pretty much ignored by everyone in the group except me. I continued
to bug my study partners with questions relating to the evening=92s=
 technical
topic and thereby building up my knowledge base. Don=92t let the tech topic
discussions get away from you. They are important. Its good healthy
discussion, just like here on the digest.


Here=92s some suggestions on how to run a study group.


1.  Assign one person the responsibility for getting the samples (each
meeting different person). Don=92t do it like we did. We tried a minimum of=
 8
and up to 14 different samples each meeting. All you need is 2 to 4 maximum.
It costs wayyy to much to do a lot of them, and all you do is get buzzed and
lose interest in serious discussions.


2.  Assign one person to the technical topic of the day. That person should
do some research, provide some written materials to the others and come up
with 2 to 4 sample test questions dealing with that topic. The questions and
appropriate answers should be discussed during the session. Apply the
discussion to the style of the evening if possible.


3.  Do the technical discussion first, prior to any sampling. This is self
explanatory.


4.  Prior to doing any sampling, following the technical discussion, discuss
the style. Assign 1 person to do some research on the history of the style
being discussed. Origins, history and development of the style is good
information to have when writing essay answers to beer style questions. It
also helps to understand sometimes why the beers taste and look the way they
do (or the way they should). Like the differences between Porter and Stout
(part of one of our questions was to differentiate between Robust Porter and
Imperial Stout).




5.  Get some judging forms and judge each sample of the style you are
working on that evening. If at all possible, especially for the first few
sessions, get an experienced (good) beer judge to help you. There are very
bad ways to fill out judging forms and there are really good ways to do it.
I=92m sure you=92ve all experienced both. I can=92t tell you how much=
 difference
it made to have Dave Sapsis and Dave Brattstrom help us develop our
techniques for communicating back to the brewer what we were seeing,
tasting, smelling. Constructive criticism is not easy, especially when that
beer you just had is really really bad. Like some of those Belgians=85


There=92s probably a million other little things I=92m forgetting. The Gold
Country Brewers Association (GCBA) (on the web somewhere) put together a
really complete set of reference materials and their own study guide. Dave B
was kind enough to share his with us. Listed below are the pieces which I
feel were really the meat of the package:


a.  Excerpts from Beer and Brewing volume 6, 20 talks from the National
Homebrewers Conference; Michael Jackson on Styles, Ted Konis on the Origins
of Normal and Abnormal Flavor.


b.  A Homebrewers Guide to Beer Flavor Descriptors, Special Issue of Zymurgy
1987.


c.  A Spectrum of colors and Flavors - The Great Grain Special Issue of
Zymurgy, 1995.


d.  The Essential Oil of Hops: Hop Aroma nd Flavor in Hops and Beer, Glenn
Tinseth 1993 (not sure where this was published). Are you there Glen?


e.  Why Water Matters, Zymurgy Special issue 1995


f.  Yeast Cycles: Ethanol, C02, and Byproducts, George Fix, Zymurgy Special
Issue 1985.


g.  Stepping up to Advanced Techniques, Mashing Basics, Jim Busch, Brewing
Techniques March/April 1995 (and he does it again only better in 1997).


For my own studying, I went out and bought the latest revision of Michael
Jackson=92s Beer Companion. Its recently revised, like 1997 I think (Brian
borrowed it last week). Its got a ton of wonderful history, recipies,
anectdotes and commercial examples of every style imaginable. Enjoyable
reading, makes a great coffee table book.


The best, most complete reference I used was Dave Miller=92s Handbook of
Homebrewing. It just has so much information organized so well, its like my
encyclopeadia and where I go first. I gave up with NCJOHB long ago. I have
Gregg Noonan=92s New Brewing Lager Beer and read it cover to cover, but=
 found
it not as well organized as Miller=92s book.


For chemistry, George Fix=92s Principles of Brewing Science is great. It=
 even
has a primer on basic chemistry in the appendix for those of us that need=
 it.


For Hops, I personally enjoyed Mark Garetz book "using hops". I continue to
use it every time I formulate a new recipe and have any question on hops.


All in all, nearly everything you need to know to pass the test is in the
BJCP studyguide on the net.

Use 1 tsp of sulfite for 5 gals of must.  Let sit at least 24 hours
before pitching.  If you are using an exotic yeast, pitch a sample
in a small amount of must to make sure it is ready.


If you let the wine ferment out fully before bottling, there is no

   "  While you can get acceptable results using his method, plastic 
pails are actually quite a bit more difficult to keep in sanitary 
condition than glass carboys.  Plastic scratches easily, and once it is
     scratched, it is no longer useful as a sanitary vessel.
     
I think we have here another classic MOMILY.  This has been
repeated so often it has become dogma but doesn't seem to stand
the test of reality.


First of all, how could sloshing some bleach around in a bucket
be more "difficult" than wrestling with a large glass carboy?


It needs to be proven that bleach sloshed around in a scratched
plastic fermenter is any less sanitary the a carboy sanitized any
way you wish.


One further note on bleach.... it has been years since I followed
the advice of tsps per gallon.  Bleach is dirt cheap and pinching
pennies with it may be the key to the notion that scratched
plastic is deadly.


I use bleach almost full strength in kegs, fermenters or anything
else that I can not sanitize with steam.  If you don't like the smell
or what it does to your hands, cut it in half or ten to one but
the teaspoon is a joke.  Obviously, when used this way careful
rinsing is a must and you end up with a vessle no more sanitary that
the rinse water but that is usually more than adequate.


Back when I used a plastic fermenter, I would put a cup or so of
bleach in it before putting it away.  When I wanted to use it again
I simply rinsed it out and used it.


Bottom line is that there is no more convenient fermenter than
the traditional plastic one with the lid that homebrew retailers
have been selling for years.

I recently did 3 batches with the Hugh Baird Maris Otter malt, and I

Yikes... I thought it was my sloppy mashing technique... 
I have made 10-15 batches using Brit Pale malt in the last year or so. My

sure enought that batch stuck near the end and I had to restir and recirc
to finish. 
This was my FIRST STUCK SPARGE. I didn't pay it much mind but on reading
above item I remembered the thread from a while back. This is looking like
a bit more than coincidence to me..  
perhaps the Marris Otter is overmodified and crushes too fine under
conventional mill gaps.

Subject: Compost, Blowoff, and east vs. west.


Dan Asks:
>I'm curious if anybody out there has experience with composting their
brewing waste?


Yeah. Grain plus grass clippings goes fast, works good.  Grain has lots of
Carbon relative to grass..it seems to help things along nicely. Follow
traditional composting techniques, eschew expensive composters...call your
local extension agent for help on low cost, effective composting, become a
master composter, and help other folks. Smell, yes, but I've no oversensitive
olfactory.  Don't put it on your patio.  I don't compost spent hops....dogs
love trucks, but my golden retriever really loves compost. Especially if there
might be a pheasant in it...which he must of course investigate.


In HBD 2584, George DePiro (one of my favorite brewers...I'm a big fan, how's
your steinbier?) notes:
"Dave Burley writes (again) about the evils of blow off tubes and closed 
fermenters (i.e., carboys).  He encourages the use of a plastic pail 
covered with plastic wrap. While you can get acceptable results using his
method, plastic pails are actually quite a bit more difficult to keep in
sanitary condition 
than glass carboys.  Plastic scratches easily, and once it is  scratched, it
is no longer useful as a sanitary vessel.  While I agree with Dave that a
dirty blow off tube can cause infection of the batch, there are some VERY easy
ways to avoid problems"


Yes, it's seems to be time for  Dave's semi-regular notation that closed
fermentation with a blowoff tube is horrible.  George, as usual, outlines
sensible and practical methods to avoid the heinous threat to our beer from
Dave's lurking bacteria.  I would like to add to George's list the use of the
glass (yes, glass!) blowoff tube. Buy one at your local homebrew supply or
make one out of 5/8 inch (say 1.5 cm) inside diameter laboratory glass tubing
bent over a propane torch, and never sweat this argument again!! Drill your
stopper to accept the OD of the glass and you're in business. You can also
make one out of copper tubing if you want.  You may invest several dollars in
one, or you can make one for bloody near free.


Open fermentation for those of us who must live in homes with dogs, children,
cats, etc. doesn't work very well.  Too much dust and hair. Ferment in carboys
with a blowoff, either as George suggests, or use a glass or copper or other
tube, and you won't be sorry. Then, you too can lurk through Dave's next post
on this subject, and you can continue to have fun.


A question: Jeff promotes classic American Pilsener...I've made it several
times, and drunk it a lot...real good beer.  But as Jeff notes, it is an
"eastern" beer.  What was the difference between "eastern" beer and "western"
beer, if there's anyone out there old enough to remember when there was a
distinction?

Since efficiency is measured in point-pound/gallon, you need to measure
grain weight, specific gravity, *and* gallons correctly. All three need =

I bought a 10 gallon kettle about two years ago. For my first batch, I =

in a pinch and I needed to be able to measure the volume. So I measured =
the
kettle's height, 16", and divided by 10. I plugged the number in to a
spreadsheet to convert to 1/16ths of an inch. I marked off a stick and =
have
used it for about 50 more batches.=20


The other day, I decided to mark a dowel off and retire the stick. I
discovered that I was a little more than a half gallon off at the 5 =
gallon
mark. I thought I had  5g when it was really 5.5g. I increased my
efficiency 10% just by correctly measuring the volume!

The only drawback is the lack of boil time for some of the added wort.
Here I am thinking about a residue of nonbreaked proteins.
Should be a minor problem though.
Myself I add some boiling water, but to get the right amount of wort,
I later add boiled and cooled water to the fermenting wessel.
It's a easy way to reach the target OG.

Subject: Undercarbonated batch


Greetings All -


Venturing out once again from my lurker status . . .


I recently brewed an I.P.A. which was pitched directly on the yeast cake
of a previous batch of I.P.A. which had just been bottled.  The yeast
was Wyeast 1968 ESB, and the initial batch came out fine.  Some of your
regular readers may remember my earlier post regarding reusing the yeast
cake (thank you all for your responses, the unanimous opinion was "pitch
away").  The first batch came out wonderfully, very hoppy with a some
nice complimentary caramel notes in the nose.  The problem, however, and
the reason for the post, is batch #2.  Fermentation was fast and
furious, and the yeast cake after the second batch came out of primary
was HUGE.  However, the batch never carbonated, even after doing exactly
the same procedures as batch #1 (boiling 2 c water, dissolving 3/4 c
corn sugar, cooling, adding to fermented beer, mixing and bottling.)
Was there not enough yeast in suspension when I siphoned the beer off of
the cake?  I know 1968 is flocculent, but geez!  How can I remedy this
situation?  The batch has only been in the bottles for 2 weeks.  Should
I just let it sit and hope for the best, or uncap, add a pinch of sugar
to each bottle and recap, or what?  Please help!!  I would love this
batch to be carbonated, as the taste is wonderful.  BTW, there is no
sugary taste in the beer, so the yeasties apparently ate what food I fed
them at bottling (which makes the lack of CO2 even more puzzling . . . )
 Posts can be made to   jams`at`mlis.state.md.us or to the collective as a
whole if you feel that the information would be helpful to the masses (I
feel that it would, as undercarbonatd beer is one of homebrewing's most
frustrating situations.)

There will probably be lots of responses, but...


First, 40F is too cold to serve a stout.
Second, Guinness is CARBONATED with CO2 and DISPENSED with CO2/N2.


So, force carbonate with CO2 at 30 psi and serve with your stout gas.
That should solve your problem.

the head off, thread it into the hole and attach the drill. Thanks to all
who responded.  I also talked with the brewers at a local Micro, Lakefront
Brewery in Milwaukee WI (no affiliation..yada yada) and he had the same
idea, he even went so far as to say that when they started out they used a
Corona at the brewery.


Another idea I've had was to convert a keg to use as a primary fermenter,
has anyone out there in the collective done this?  How can it be done and
what are the results (good and bad). Any input will be greatly appreciated.


Thanks.

HBDers,
I'll take a stab at what causes beer to taste like metal.


We all know that SS needs to passivated, meaning to allow
the protective oxide layer to form BEFORE you brew with it.
What IF the tanks/tuns where improperly cleaned thus removing
the oxide layer and exposing the wort/beer to the raw SS.
Wouldn't the brew then take on the metallic taste?

Raymond Estrella wrote a defense of A-B's most recent tactics in trying to
drive out competition in the craft beer industry.  He wrote:

Right, but I think you're missing the point of the case.  A-B is pushing
this thing because they won't have to change ANY of their labels.  A-B has
won a ruling in the past (I guess from the BATF or a judge somewhere) that
says its allright for them to put "St. Louis, Missouri" as the source of
their beer regardless of where its made.  And as we all know, A-B has many
breweries all over the country manufacturing their filth.  So what does
this labeling law cost them?  Nothing.  However it would require Sam Adams,
et alia, to change many of their labels, at much expense.


He continues:

So this justifies their ad campaign that they're really concerned about
freshness and "truth"?  I don't think so.  I doubt their is any difference
between a skunked Bud and a fresh Bud (at least to my taste "buds".  The
local craft brewers and brewpubs are the ones really concerned about
quality and freshness.

Right, but are those adjuncts designed to cheapen the beer in both quality,
flavor, and cost?  No, they generally improve the product or make it
unique.  What does rice or corn add to the beer to make it better, in other
than financial terms?


Please don't interpret this as a flame or personal attack, but I'm really
dismayed that there are craft beer drinkers/home brewers out there that
will go to such lengths to defend A-B and  their anti-competitive,
anti-craft brew tactics.

Life is too short to drink cheap beer.


Beer. If you can't taste it, why bother!


Friends don't let friends drink Light Beer.


If nothing beats a Bud, given the choice, I'd take the nothing...
