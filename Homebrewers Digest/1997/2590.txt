"While I'm posting to HBD, I may as well ask this question:
Why is oxygenation not an issue w/ wine yeasts, at least not in the home
wine making literature that I've read?


I hate to seem so cynical but the homebrewing industry is orders
of magnitudes larger than the home winemaking industry ever was.


This presents two possible answers:


There are greater opportunities in a larger market for people who 
say clever things about it.  The more complicated it seems and
the more dogmatic it gets, the easier it becomes to fill pages
and pages with words of wisdom for hire or for free.


The other possibility is that most homemade wine still tastes like
homebrew did before we learned how to make it right.


The reality is probably somewhere in between.  I make my wine
just like I make my beer and as I have said ad nausiam, simply
letting the wort/must drop and splash into the fermenter seems
to provide enough oxygen to make good stuff, at least in home
brew sized batches.


There is also the possibility that as wine must usually is not
boiled, there will be more disolved oxygen in it.


Although tangentially connected, there is an Applicaton Note
on another aspect of aeration on our web page.

I don't think blowoff tubes are that likely a source of infection and
cleaning should be no problem.  If there is going to be an infection
carried from the blowoff tube into the fermenter I think it could only
be from the first few inches of the tube nearest the fermenter.  The
only possible way I can see for infection to be carried in is by receding
foam from the ferment.  This will only be in the first few inches of the
tube.  This much of the tube is easily reached with the fingers to clean.
Filth in the rest of the tube shouldn't matter.

I find that an hour or two soak with warm water and TSP cleans off the worst

Subject: Improved Hydrometer Readings


Hello hello,


Here's a simple trick that doubles your hydrometer sensitivity, uses a
smaller sample size, and makes it easier to cope with high temperature
samples.  


Steps :
    1) take sample 
    2) dilute it with equal volume of water
    3) take reading and double the fraction (i.e. 1.008 --> 1.016)


I said it was simple.


To make it easier I pre-marked a line on my sample well for the
volume of liquid required to float the hydrometer for a reading, and
a line at half of that volume.  To use it, I fill the well with my
sample to the halfway line then top off with water to the full volume
line then plop in my hydrometer.


You can get those lines by filling your sample well with water
until it floats the hydrometer (with a little extra for those
sub-1.000 gravities), remove the hydrometer and measure the volume of
water.  I rounded that up to a little more convenient number, in my
case 150 ml, your mileage may vary.  Pour that back into your well
and mark a line at that liquid level.  Next, empty the well and pour
in 1/2 that volume and then mark that line.


Because my hydrometer reads 1.000 in 60F water I trust it more toward
the lower end of the scale.  This technique pulls your readings
closer to those ranges.  If yours doesn't read 1.000 with water, just
note the difference and add it to your measurements to compensate for
instrument error.


When taking high temperature samples the dilution brings the
temperature down so it's easier to cool it the rest of the way to
60F, or if you use temperature correction tables, the lower
temperature is less squirrely so the corrections are a little more
reliable.  You can use ice water to dilute, or warm water depending on
whether your sample is warmer or colder than 60F.

Charles Rich (Seattle, USA)

Subject: A-B Bashing, Dopplebock?


It must be the hectic holidays getting to me, but I just have to get in on the
current A-B thread.


First, A-B is being hypocritical on the "Truth-in-Labeling" issue. They want
Sam Adams and Pete's to have exactly where they were brewed on the bottle, but
A-B is not willing to do the same. They brew beer all over the US, (granted,
they own all the breweries) but they won't make different cans and labels for
all the different locations. It is a big cost issue, but they want everyone
else to spend the money for all the labels, but they don't want to do it
themselves. This whole issue was effectively shot down on a national level (or
bogged down in the ATF, where it will either get lost or burned), so now A-B
is trying bring it up state by state. Just trying to tighten the screws more
on the little guys. Its bad enough that A-B has brainwashed the general public
into drinking their hopless, half-rice swill, but now that there are a lot of
brewers turning out good beer, they want to crush them any way they can so the
A-B market share can be back to 99% or whatever the hell it was 5 years ago.
To me, the issue is whether the beer is good or not. Can't they just let
brewers making good beer alone, and quit the senseless attacks? (can you tell
I'm raving yet?)


Now for a craft-beer related topic. If you make a "dopplebock" style beer with
an ale yeast, wouldn't it be an Old Ale?

In HBD 2585 Terry White wrote:
<snip>  It would be very interesting to see a listing of all the
adjuncts and chemicals in some of the commercial beers out there.


Sure, why not?  Then we could see exactly what those 'Select Cereal
Grains' are that make up Bud, Bud Light, etc.  It would likely be mostly
rice.  And, we could see what the deal is why their beer in clear glass
doesn't skunk - treated hop extract vs. hop flowers or pellets.


In reply to Raymond Esterella:


I don't have a problem with the idea of 'Truth In Labeling'.  What gets
me is that A-B is pushing it only in Missouri at this time, which will
force everyone but them to do special labeling just to sell their beer
in Missouri.  I know Sam Adams makes his beer in Oregon; I've walked on
the street where the brewery is, and I believe that they are coming
clean on their labels now.  But because A-B decides to take this 'Holier
than Thou' attitude towards contract brewing, that's what gets me riled.
What the hell are small brewers with limited capital supposed to do?  If
contract brewing wasn't done, it's likely many breweries would never get
beyond their local area.  


As for the 'Skunky' beer thing, I'm a homebrewer and I do know what
causes 'skunky' beer.  The whole point there is that they ride this HUGE
bandwagon about 'skunky' beer, and yet they package 2 of their beers in
bottles that are the major factor in skunking.  To me, that's being
hypocritical.  When they point out about 'skunky' beer (the 2 that
immediately come to my mind are Corona - clear glass! and Heineken) in
their ads, and yet produce a product in a container that is KNOWN to aid
in skunking beer, that's being hypocritical.  It's not misleading; they
are in no way saying that their packaging won't skunk a beer.  I also
think that they take a cheap shot when they use treated hop oil instead
of whole hops or pellets in making their beer just so they can get away
with clear glass.  If you use whole hops or pellets, even the most
delicate of beers will skunk if you give it the opportunity.  


Once again, I re-iterate that there are some A-B products out that I do
like.  Even Bud Ice isn't bad; I just think that A-B needs to lighten up
on the little guy.


Finally, I retract my final statement about adjuncts.  It wasn't well
stated.

Anyone know how to get tri-sodium phosphate deposits off my homebrew
equipment?  Bleach, vinegar, very hot water?  How strong a solution, and
how long a soak?  What happened was that I had filled the kitchen sink
with a solution of 3 tablespoon TSP anmd 3 gallons very hot water to
soak a few items for several hours.  When I came back to rinse, the
water level had dropped, and the TSP dried on everything that became
exposed to the air.  Soaking in hot water (140 degrees F) didn't do a
thing.  It took a good scrub with a copper scouring pad just to get the
stuff off bottles; how do I get it off plastic items such as tubing,
"Wine/Beer Thief", etc.?  Thanks for your help...think I'll stick to

I emailed Valley Brewing regarding this and they indicated that the gap 
settings do vary from mill to mill, and that is why they don't provide 
measurements. I resorted to using electrical wire to measure the gaps.  
The Ingersoll-Rand "Cameron Hydraulic Book" provides the following 
diameter size in inches for AWG copper wire:


AWG Size    Diameter (inches)

Maybe some electrical types can verify this data, Kenny Schwartz?  You

Subject: Sodium Hypochlorite "Bleach"


Fellow Homebrewers,


This is in response to a discussion between George De Piro and Dave Burley
on the use (or depending on your viewpoint maybe misuse) of household
bleach or sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for cleaning and disinfection.  I do
not want to question or critisize either of these knowledgeable fellow
brewers on whether bleach should or should not be used for homebrew
disinfection.  However, as a chemist that works in a chlor-alkali
production facility I just wanted to clarify some technical points that
were made in the discussion.


1) Sodium Hypochlorite is produced by reacting Caustic or NaOH with
chlorine or Cl2 to produce NaOCl and NaCl.  In order for this chemical to
be 'stable' it is best to have a little excess NaOH, usually 0.5 g NaOH per
liter.  Seldom does it have more than that for two reasons. the first being
it would cost more to produce it (unreacted chemical) and second there
would be a dramatic impact on pH of the solution it was being added to.
So, although a more concentrated solution would have a higher pH than a
dilute one, it would be slight.


2) There are some places that do use NaOCl for water sterilization but they
are in the minority because the strongest you can make this solution is
about 17.5% (wt. %) and therefore it is about 82.5% water (if we ignore the
salt that is formed in the reaction and the small excess NaOH).  It can not
be produced as a dry powder even as a dihydrate.  That is most likely
Ca(OCL)2 or bleach powder.  The main advantages to Bleach is it is easy to
meter, can be stored in a plasitic tank at ambient conditions as opposed to
a high pressure cylinder that needs special handling, and the environmental
regulations are somewhat less cumbersome.  Adding Cl2 gas causes a lowering
of the pH (since it is an acid gas) which could cause problems in some places.


3) The improved performance, if heated, is because the OCl ion is
particularly reactive and increased heat accelerates that reaction.  But it
is not particularly selective and will react with whatever is available,
whether that be microbes, plastic tubing, or skin.  Repeated use often
oxidizes the plasticizers in tubing which can make them brittle and could
turn them opaque.


I did not intend this to be a bleach lecture and some may consider it
wasted bandwidth but the chemist in me wanted to clarify some of the
discussion.


I actually do homebrew and I use bleach as a disinfectant for my carboys.
In fact, I keep a dilute bleach solution in them during storage.  Since my
nose no longer adequately smells chlorine I use my youngest daughter as my
sniffer.  I rinse with hot water, usually 3 times, and  when she does not
smell chlorine any more I figure it is ready.  I have done 17 5-gallon
batches without an infected one yet so it has been working for me.

Subject: sparklers / nitrogen


I've noted quite a discussion over the last week about the sparkler for
dispensing beers, so I'll toss in my bit as well.


I have been using ( or tinkering with ) old Guiness flow control faucets for
several years. About a year ago, while cleaning the sparkler portion of the
nozzle, I lost the little diffusor plate. The faucet will pour like a normal
faucet without this peice. The diffusor plate is a thin disk with small
perforations ( holes ) that the beer must be forced throught in order to get
to your glass.


Since I needed a new diffusor and couldn't find one to buy, I made up several.
I had not previously noted the diameter of the perferations in the diffuser.
So I made up several differing units. The hole sizes range from .010 - .030
inch  the disks are in .005 inch increments. In playing with the differing
size diffusers, I noticed that widing differing pour could be got from the
same beer ( pressure / temperature being equal ) I use the very fine hole
diffuser disks for stouts, porters and ales. And work up in hole sizes for
more robust beers. 


I have not noted any variation in the longevity of hop nose from any faucet
combo. I have encountered difficult in getting a reasonable pour with highly
hopped beers and the finer perf diffusers. But unlike AK, I don't set around
for hours just smelling my beer either.

Well, the real difference is where it is from. "Pilsner" is an
appellation
meaning it comes from Plzen. So, Pilsner Urquell and Gambrinus are the
only
beers that can be called "Pilsner". Czechs, don't really know the word:
Pilsner.
They term beers either light "svetle", or dark "tmave" or "cerny
(black)".
If you mentioned Pilsner they understand you as meaning Urquell.


So, the Germans term their Pilsner-like beer, Pils. I don't remember
seeing any
German beers being called Pilsner when I was there a few months back,
but I
wasn't looking. I can think of a few examples where they call it Pils.


So, for the semi-technical bit. German pils have a little more
bitterness
than their Czech counterparts. Not just due to more hops, but because of
harder water. Generally, the further north you go the more bitter it
becomes. Hops, well as you might guess, Zatec(Saaz) hops are replaced
by German varieties, such as Tettanger and Hallertau. The German
brewers use decocotion mashes, contributing to the rocky head. They also
use a small nozzle on their tap system which also helps with the head.


So your friends' differences are not correct. Pils are available in
bottles
and on tap. I have plenty of labels of different Pils to back that up!
Simply, Pils is from Germany and Pilsner is from the Czech Republic.
Note: sometimes some Germans (probably not beer drinkers) understand
the difference being that Pils are diet beers and Pilsners are not.
This is also wrong, but based on some old German advertising campaigns.

effective method to increase hop flavor.  HSA in a hop back is not a 
very big issue for homebrewers, you have a lot of water vapor 
steaming off the hot wort and with a well designed hop back you will 
not get HSA to the point of problems, expecially with well cared for 
homebrew.  Victory, as a whole hop brewery only, uses a hop back and 
I have yet to detect HSA issues in HopDevil IPA or other more 
delicate, malty,  beers.

Probably overkill.  Nice thing about stones is you can use em for

brewing practices including good yeast management and cell counts.

Germans usually call slow poured beers of this type Pils, which is

methods while the classic Pilsner Urquell is the archetype which all 
other Bohemians are measured by.

"Bret A. Schuhmacher" <bas`at`healthcare.com> wrote about the advantages of
fermenting in a 10 gallon corney with a pressure relief valve.  If you were
to affix an adjustable relief valve with a gauge, you would have the
capability of fermenting a lager at 68F/30psi with a new German lager yeast
that Dan McConnell at Yeast Culture Kit Co. has.  It apparently produces
true lager cleanness under these conditions, and allows shortened lagering
at 50F/30psi.  Reportedly this is becoming very common in Germany, allowing
quick fermentation and lagering.  I'd rather do it the traditional way, but
for those without refrigeration capabilities, this is a good alternative.

Subject: On Blowoff Tubes


I just wanted to quickly add my thoughts:


I use a blowoff all the time on a 6 gallon glass carboy.  Sometimes
I get a blowoff, sometimes I don't.


I don't worry about my tube getting dirty because it is made of
glass. I bought them at my local homebrew shop and I sanitize
it the same way I sanitize the rest of my equipment.  It always
gets sparkling clean no matter how thick the crud is that gets
stuck on it during blowoff.


I know that it is more expensive than plastic tubing, but the extra
expense is worth it if you want to use a blowoff and are truly
concerned about picking up an infection from plastic tubing.

Dave admonishes George:


>George, you ( and other people) are a little confused on this issue:


>1)Municipal water treatment uses chlorine gas not sodium
>hypochlorite, except in rare circumstances where pH adjustment
>may be needed and this is the cheaper alterative.


Sorry Dave, but *millions* of Northern Californians get their municipal
water supply treated with sodium hypochlorite.  Both the San Francisco
Water Dept. (which provides water to lots of places other than just SF)
and the East Bay Municipal Utility District (which serves the entire
East Bay Area and some others)  went away from Chlorine gas about 6
years ago. Both of these are surface water supplies derived from largely
granitic watersheds that are naturally soft and pH neutral. The change
was (purportedly) for safety reasons, as the gaseous form is one
dangerous material -- especially given the area's tendency to get up and
boogie (to say nothing of  all us freaky-radical Berkeley leftists
around).  This change was  met with dismay on the part of brewers, as
the dose rate for the gas was around .3 ppm as compared to 1-1.5 ppm for
bleach treatment.  The difference was readily apparent to a trained
nose.  Bleach will readily dispate over time or with heat.  


Other water companies are using Chloramines, which are an even  more
stable form, and provide even greater concern for brewers.  I strongly
suggest that everyone try to get reliable information on *their* water,
and make corrections as appropriate.


Dave also suggests that low concentrations of bleach is inadequate for
basic sanitation:


>However, just like you wouldn't use chlorinated tap water as a
>sanitizer, you shouldn't use low concentrations of bleach to do this.




While some prefer it hot (or strong) while others like it cold (or
weak), I fail to see how anyone who uses tapwater as a final rinse step
can fail to see something illogical here.


For many years, prior to using either Iodophor or peroxyacetic acid, I
used bleach at concentrations that Dave would disapprove of (1:1000
yielding 55 ppm or thereabouts), with drip-dry, no rinse, without
problems.  There are thousands of unique ways to go about successful
brewing  -- many defy common wisdom.  Just one of the things I like
about it.


One point that I am in total agreement with Dave on:  The CRC handbook
(mine is the 38th edition and I am the 5th owner) aint getting any
better, just bigger!


Cheers, and a great holiday to everyone.

As George De Piro well knows, a pet peeve of mine is the use of
the term "horsey/horse blanket" to describe that interesting
aroma found in Belgian beers.  Personally, I find the aroma 
to be similar to that of a well-tended compost pile, but
certainly not like a horse blanket.  As a rider and a brewer,
I've never noticed even the remotest resemblance between
Brettanomyces and horses & their blankets.  I've even
ridden horses in Belgium, and Belgian blankets don't 
smell like Brett. either.  However, I've never ridden
a horse with a blanket (in Belgium or elsewhere) while
drinking a Belgian beer, so maybe that's why my perceptions
are off.

Subject: Beta Glucans rest


Being an experimenter...
I'm inclined to try using a small amount of flaked oats in a batch of pale
ale, say 1/2 lb. oats, 9 lbs Maris Otter in a five gallon batch, maybe with
1/2 lb. crystal.  The literature I've seen advises a beta glucans rest with
pale lager malt to avoid problems with wort viscosity and stuck sparges, but
I'd like to try it with a single infusion with Maris Otter straight to 154
degrees.  I've never had a stuck sparge in about 30 all-grain batches, and
have used flaked oats, rye, and barley before with no problems.  So, the
questions are: 


Is there any other reason to do the beta glucanase rest other than to avoid
wort viscosity problems?
What good qualities do flaked oats really add?
Can these good qualities be had by skipping the low-temp rest, assuming no
stuck sparge?

From: jwilkins`at`wss.dsccc.com (John Wilkinson)
Subject: RE: Return of the RollerMill Thread!


" The knurling on the rollers has to grip the
grain and the driven roller forces the grain through the gap, thereby 
turning the second roller.  If it doesn't grip, the second roller won't 
turn.  That is not as bad as it sounds....


Actually, it could be worse.  As the knurls wear, like old men,
they lose their bite.  This is typically not a problem for
homebrewers who rarely come close to wearing out rollers but
it is a real consideration for the serious brewer.


That is the reason we offer a gear drive option to actively
drive the second roller for the heavy user.  Roller wear is
subtle and long before total failure, the efficency and
throughput slowly drop off.


We have always supplied mills with a "poor man's gear", (the
Oring) even though it is probably not necessary.  It just
feels good to have both rollers turn all the time.  


This is also one of the reasons we only allow adjustment from
one end.  The Oring would not stay put or last very long if
it was between rollers where the spacing was changed regularly.
It is also difficult to make gears work properly when the
spacing is changed.  Remember Glatt?  Not only changing the
gear spacing but the gears were plastic and unreliable, to
put it politely. What was worse, it would not work without
gears because of the smaller roller.


It is less of a problem with large diameter rollers but I have
never seen a commercial mill without gears.

I haven't followed the whole thread but came upon Graham Barron's 
response to the A-B thread.


There will always be backlash to A-B's competitive tactics.  Now you can 
take it personally or you can see it as strictly business.  A-B has a  
responsibility to their stockholders to maintain this competitive 
advanatage.  If the courts say that what A-B is doing is legal or if A-B 
wins a case against a bunch of little guys then those people running A-B 
are doing their jobs.  If I were an A-B stockholder, I would be rooting 
them on.  If you take it personally or if you think that these tactics 
threaten micros and brewpubs, then you need to organize a CAMRA like 
organization which will develop tactics to hurt A-B in the marketplace. 
That is a daunting task since there are more of them (Bud drinkers) than 
us.


> Right, but I think you're missing the point of the case.  A-B is

>Missouri" as the source of their beer regardless of where its made.  


If I were an executive at A-B, I would recommend that the champion of 
this idea get a huge bonus.  It will save them millions.  Great idea for 
A-B.


>And as we all know, A-B has many breweries all over the country 
>manufacturing their filth.  


This is where we get off the track and you start wearing your emotions on 
your sleeve.   A-B does not manufacture filth.  A-B manufactures mass 
market beers that appeal to the largest cross-section of population 
possible.  Now they have gotten into some "fuller flavored" beers 
recently that seem to miss the mark, but remember who they are marketing 
to.  Certainly, it is not to you or I.  Also, for the style that they 
are, Michelob and Budweiser are arguably two of the best beers (of that 
style) made in the world.  A-B's quality control is the best in the 
WORLD, make no mistake about it.  A-B knows what it is doing.

> freshness and "truth"?  I don't think so.  I doubt their is any 
>difference between a skunked Bud and a fresh Bud (at least to my taste

I suspect then that you have no taste buds for their is a great 
difference between an old Bud and a fresh Bud.  Bud actually has little 
opportunity to get "skunked".  Take a Bud and put it on an unrefrigerated 
shelf.  Wait 6 months, buy a fresh one and taste them side by side.  If 
you can't tell a difference, then you have no taste buds.  


> The local craft brewers and brewpubs are the ones really concerned 
>about quality and freshness.
> Actually the local guys are really only concerned about selling their 
product.  As to A-B's not being concerned, that is true but then again it 
isn't.  They are not overly concerned primarily because their beers NEVER 
sit on a shelf for very long.  Consumption and production are very much 
in line with each other which means it moves off of the shelves quickly. 
It has been like this for many years.  I work for Union Pacific and we a 
have a shipment monitoring contract with A-B.  I can guarantee you that 
when a rail shipment is delayed (not only of raw materials but of product 
going to the marketplace), A-B is notified and proactive intervention is 
initiated to get that shipment where it needs to be ON TIME.  A-B knows 
that they are under scrutiny in this whole freshness thing.  Go to your 
local liquor store and try to find an old (more than a couple of 
months) A-B product on the shelves.


> You don't hear ads from Pete's, Rogue, whatever saying A-B beer isn't 
>any good because they use lots of adjuncts.  They have too much class to

I don't know how this indicates that Pete's, Rogue, et. al. have class.  
I would suspect that they do not want to take on the A-B legal 
juggernaut.  This is more likely the case than them having class.

> >adjuncts.  Belgian, Scotch and English Ales come to mind.


Or it may have to do with the idea that these companies would like to 
reserve the right in the future to use adjuncts themselves without being 
called into question.

Rice and corn are cheaper, but they are quite essential to making 
the American Lager substyles.  The drinking public on the whole does not 
want full flavored malty beers.

products is when I am in a place that has no other beer such as wedding 
receptions and certain restaurants.  I could choose to drink nothing, but 
I would rather have a Bud than nothing.  Everyone is exercising their 
right to purchase or not purchase.  I have had many people try my beer.  
Many love it, but a lot more would really rather have a Bud.  Are they 
wrong or are they just expressing what their preferences are?  Everyone 
is entitled to an opinion.  My opinion is that A-B does a great job for 
its stockholders and makes the finest American Lagers in America.  
Competitive market practices are constantly under scrutiny and subject to 
judgement under our legal system.  Conspiracy theories anyone?  The real 
problem here is that we just prefer not to drink their beer.

I too find that the second coarsest setting on my Valley Mill gives the best
crush.  The third coarsest setting causes too much damage to the grain husk, 
IMO.  I have only made three batches so far using my VM but I have noticed no
drop in efficiency using only a single pass at the second coarsest setting.
Previously I'd been having my local shop crush the grain with their JSP
Malt Mill.
