>Subject: Re: Exploding bottles


        Gotta say, there's too much speculation on this one. The facts are...the
standard head space works. Bottles USUALLY become explosive as a result of
excess fermentables in the closed vessel. It seems to me that the amount of
'air', read O2, is insignificant to bomb production, as we are dealing with
yeast that we really are not asking to reproduce, merely do a bit more
'chewing.'  Of course, as an untrained brewer, wot the hell do I know?
        Wot I know is what has worked for me, and the major's, and the micro's,
whether bottle conditioned or not. Pro concerns with O2 relate to spoilage,
and fill level is a regulatory, and consumer protective issue, not to
mention economy.
        The experience that guides me on the headspace issue, in regards to
EXPANSION, and in complete agreement with Pat Babcock on this one, is the
filling of growlers `at` LABCO. Some well meaning bartenders would, against
advice, fill growlers to the top and cap. Yeah, the customer gets an extra
few ounces of beer. But, if it's hot outside, and the beer in the bottle
served from a 35 F tank, and then placed in a hot car, while the customer
goes to the next shop, etc.....the damn thing lets loose, with a gentle
'crack' of glass, ....I know 'cos I've been in a vehicle and heard
it.....and there's a 1/2 gallon of beer in a carpet.
        But, if there had been a normal airspace in the bottle, the expanding
brew, (expanding secondary to heat,) would be able to compress the
airspace, and not explode the vessel.
        I am also one of those stupid enough to fill kegs with compressed gas, and
I am thankful that the regulators had 'pressure relief devices' on them.
Gee, imagine that, a 'redundant' safety device! If the gas delivery tank,
pressurized at say 800 - 3000 lbs/sq.in. delivered gas to a closed vessel
and the regulator failed, the relief would have blown before the tank did.
Notwithstanding the ratings of the tanks, which as Pat reports, are
substantial. 
        Allusions of  disaster, IMHO, are overstated, unless your Christian name
is Beavis or Butthead.
        Enough banch!

        It is my firm belief that all other factors being considered, the major
etiology of off flavors and infection in micro beers, especially brewpubs,
is exactly what Jeff relates to in his own pump. 
        If one will agree that the majority of BP's have a turnkey system, one
must also agree that they have a single pump, (some have more) invariably
located under the brewer's platform, that does all the work.
        Yet the majority of these operators only open their pumps once every six
months or so, if that. Reliance on chemical CIP standards doesn't always
cut it.

        You can get away with anything, but what you want is a regulator at the
tank that then goes to a manifold that has a regulator for each beer
vessel. You should also get a check valve to place after each 'vessels'
regulator, to prevent any back flow of brew to regulators, should you have
a deficit in pressure in any area. This is cheaper than buying new bits for
 regulators, or even just cleaning those that have filled with brew. Or
even having brew from one vessel flow to another.
        The best check valves, IMHO, are those that have a simple rubber 'flap
valve,' that allows gas to flow one way, but not the other, rather than
then ubiquitous 'ball on a spring.'  These rust.

Random Ravings...
        Soon to be a "Professionally Trained" brewer, as my scholarship `at` Siebel

        It is my great pleasure to announce that I will soon be enjoying the
company of George de Piro, who will also be schooled `at` Siebel, in the same
course as I.        
        I would like to ask that we be allowed to meet with Chicago area brewers,
of a homebrew nature, perhaps on the first Friday of the course, the 9th of
January. I know both he and I will be broke, but assume that there are
places in Chicago where one or two beers won't cost 30 bucks, and are good
brews. So any of you local hb'ers that can suggest a meeting point, e-mail
me. I will be bringing along my dinosaur 386 and posting to the HBD on the
Siebel experience, on a mostly daily basis, as I expect will George. I do

NA Brew.....
        Pro operations that produce NA beer rely on very expensive techniques
involving vacuum centrifuges, etc. Techniques for homebrewers are unable to
approach these, but like anything in our craft, are worthy of exploration.
        Recent posts indicate a low tolerance for other's opinions. Personal
experiences are valid to that individual, and seem to be offered as such.
Short of a 12 step Web digest, I don't think that there is any group of
individuals more aware of, or interested in learning about abuse, than the
subscribers to the HBD. 
        What I do find objectionable is derision of other's stated personal
experiences and opinions. I'll go to bat on this forum for anyone's right
to disagree, but terms like "BS," etc are not intended to state opposition
to a view. They are intended to invalidate views not in concurrence with
the writer's, and humiliate the originator.
        I find it a little 'over the top."

The beer was at about 42F and I was dispensing with ~11 lbs pressure. My


liquid-out line is four feet of 3/16" tubing with a picnic tap.
Theoretically,
the diameter and length of tubing _should_ have taken care of that
amount of
pressure. Unfortunately, the beer came firing out of the tap like a
rocket. Any
ideas why this might be? It knocks an awful lot of carbonation out. The
regulator could be way off, but I have reasons to doubt that. The new
regulator
should answer that one . . .


Matt. I have been kegging for a couple of years now and found there are
many things that can affect how the beer comes out of the tap. I see you
have already done the length of hose, temp, and pressure thing. Good,
however the other things that come into play is how much rolling the keg
on the floor with the pressure reg. set at 25-30 lbs? To much of this
can cause your problem as well as a beer that is still fermenting on you
in the keg. You will get lots of foam but very little Co2 in the beer
itself.


Also, what effect, if any, will the length and diameter of the gas-in
line have
on the pressure reaching the keg?


None.


I realize that I may be pondering the imponderable here, but I am
planning on
getting a 10# tank (the only place I can get them refilled is 30 minutes
away,
and I would prefer not to have to go all that much). If I a) force
carbonate
every batch after it has been cooled to about 40F, b) dispense at same
pressure
(about 10-12 lbs), and c) assuming there are no leaks in this system,
_approximately_ how many batches should I be able to carbonate and
dispense
with this tank?


You will loose count. Last year on my #5 I forced carbonated and
despenced six half barrels and three one quarter barrels........  YUM!

Irish Moss has to be added during the boil. Gelatine finings
will clear the beer up enough, if indeed it is needed.
Add 24-48 hours before bottling.

I have heard they can caramelise the wort slightly, making them

Perhaps if you stir the wort properly through out the boil..

Depends on how you use it.  There is NOTHING to say you have to do an
upward step infusion mash with a RIMS system.  Some people may think
that a protein rest is a lot of bull and wasted time and just do a
single step infusion with their RIMS.  In fact, it is my belief that
to have a RIMS, you do not need any heater at all.  Merely constant
recirculation during mashing.  With super insulation, the heat loss
could be small and within tolerance of the body you are seeking and
you would still reap several of the benefits of the RIMS concept.

You imply elsewhere in your post that you have acquired some expertise in the
area of alcoholism from your experience as a jailer.  Why don't you ask some
of the alcoholic inmates if they ever fell off the wagon by deluding
themselves into thinking that they could have "just one" drink?  One of the
hallmarks of the disease as it develops is the attempt by the drinker to
control their alcohol intake.  Most, if not all, true alcoholics have tried
to control their drinking at some point in the evolution of their disease  
with predictably disastrous results.


I'd be willing to bet that there is a problem drinker out there in cyberspace
reading your's and Jack's posts and thinking "maybe, just maybe, I can start
drinking again in moderation".  If I can save just one alcoholic from trying
to rationalize another attempt at "moderate" drinking then this use of 
HBD bandwith is worth it.

Subject: Chlorine/bleach part 2


Brewsters:


Part 2. =




As far as organic load is concerned, in general, the higher the load,
the more organic stuff, the more active chlorine is needed to get
disinfection.  In the case of proteins as organic load,  chloramines =


are formed which have some residual disinfection power, especially
at higher temperatures.


More to the point for us is the use of hypochlorites in sanitizing food
handling and processing equipment.  In addition to a number of
other references, the article refers to the US Public Health Service
which recommends a sanitizing rinse of at least 50 ppm of available
chlorine at a minimum of 75F( 24C) for a time sufficient to provide a =


fast kill of organisms. (in  other references this is 10 seconds =


to 1 minute).  This reference is for a sanitizing rinse and assumes
a clean container.


In his HBD submission, Jim Liddil reminds us that a surface that
has an organic coating cannot be disinfected. As he so graphically
put it: " First WRT ("with regard to" - DRB) glass anyone who has
worked in a lab with proteins knows how tenaciously they bind to
glass......  I have to constantly remind our students that things have =


to be clean before autoclaving. The(y) are not the same.  After all I
can autoclave feces and then it is sterile......


All the discussion of sanitation has failed to address the issue
of making sure the surface is really clean before any sanitation is
to occur.  And with the high organic load of brewing you really have
to use some strong cleaners to get the grunge off.  We also have to
deal with things like calcium deposits of one sort or another that can
also trap dirt or provide hiding places for microorganisms.....
remember that a dirty surface can never be a sanitized one."


In support of this, I always rinse my carboys with a bleach solution =


and allow them to be stored wet.  Sometimes on doing this, the rinse
solution has a cloudy appearance which I assume is organic =


material lifted from the glass surface. Jim comments that he
ferments in plastic and I presume it is to prevent the association of =


organic material on the glass as well as the ease in handling
and physical cleaning.


Jim says:


>"  I favor using strong cleaning agents like 10% bleach (the =


>current CDC recommended conc. for blood disinfection),
 or any number of =


>other cleaners (PBW, autodishwasher detergent, alconox etc.)
  I also =


>usually acid rinse all the equipment. "


Jim says: =


> I am doing a little test of plastic and how well it can be disinfected =


>etc.  =




SUMMARY


I conclude from this and a bunch of other private communications:


1) Alkaline Bleach operates with a different mechanism =


( chlorate intermediate) from acid chlorine solutions ( hypochlorous
 acid intermediate), but may also incorporate HOCl. As a result of
 the high efficiency of HOCl, pH is a factor in disinfection rate. =


The higher pH is slower on a concentration basis, however,  pH of 5
 is the most efficaceous for chlorine disinfectants when stability,
 availabliity of HOCl is taken into consideration. =




2) At alkaline pH a higher temperature is better, providing an =


approximate doubling of the rate of disinfection with each 10C rise.


3) Disinfection can only be assured if the surface is clean.


4) Organic load is important in controlling the amount of
disinfectant used.  In the high organic loads we encounter in
brewing, more is better. Reaction products with proteins
( chloramines) can behave as disinfectants also, if less effectively.
Higher temperatures make these products more effective.


Hopefully, this has been a useful discussion and I would like to
thank all those who provided input.

Subject: Chlorine/bleach Part 1


Brewsters:


You may want to skip to the summary at the end of Part 2 if you
don't want the details.


In response to my appeal last week or two for some information
on mechanisms of chlorine disinfection methods, Jim Liddil was
kind enough to fax me a chapter on this subject called "Chlorine and
Chlorine Compounds". Jim promised you I would write more on the
subject and this is in keeping with his promise. I think his fine
correspondence and sharing of his personal experiences and
the excellent set of chemical information from =


AJ  DeLange just about settled the issue in my mind.  I will
summarize here what I think is a reasonable interpretation of all =


this information and  some new data from the article Jim provided
I hope I don't leave anything out or misinterpret it.
If I do,  well then you know what you can do -
expose my mistakes right here. {8^)


As you may know, I was curious about the suggested mechanisms
of dis-infection with bleach, the effect of temperature on disinfection
rate and the effect of bleach concentration on disinfection rate, as
what I have been doing for years is high concentrations of bleach =


at high temperatures.  This is opposite to a lot of hobby books I =


have read which suggest a teaspoon or so of bleach in a gallon of
water used cold for many minutes or hours or days.


The proposed mechanism of hypochlorous as the active
intermediate in disinfection didn't seem to me to apply to alkaline
solution. The use of low temperatures to minimize loss and
maximize the HOCl concentratinon didn't either, so using
guidelines for acidic chlorine didn't seem to necessarily apply
to bleach , which we use. These guidelines apply rather to acidic =


solution made up by dissolving chlorine in water upon which the
chlorine reacts with the water ( think of it as each chlorine atom
getting a piece of the water molecule if you wish) producing
HCl and HOCl.   Dissolving chlorine in sodium hydroxide or
adding NaOH to chlorine water produces the same result -
sodium hypochlorite plus residual hydroxide which we call
household bleach. Reacting chlorine with calcium hydroxide
produces bleaching powder used in disinfection as well as
industrial bleaching.  =




Part of the problem I have found is the penchant for authors to
use the word "chlorine" as a pseudonym for chlorine/water,
other "active" chlorine compounds and hypochlorite solutions.
This lumping of the various forms of active chlorine under one
umbrella disguises the mechanisms and distinctions of the
various forms.  While it makes sense from a chlorine producers =


and maybe a chemist's point of view, from a mechanism and user
point of view it leaves some deficiencies, since alkaline and =


acidic chlorine solutions have different properties.


Brien Kirby reminded me in a private correspondence that there
is an equilibrium in acidic media which explains why bleach is =


kept alkaline to ensure its long-term stability.  In the acidic state,
HOCl is in equilibrium with molecular chlorine dissolved in the
water. The molecular chlorine in the water is in equilibrium with
any chlorine in the gas above the water.  If no chlorine is in the gas
phase, the chlorine/water mixture eventually degasses and becomes
inactive even without oxidizing anything.  Anyone who has a
chlorinated water supply knows this every time s/he takes a drink.


In the alkaline state, the concentration of HOCl, is very low as
my previous calculations showed and the above mechanism is
inoperative, so the chlorine stays dissolved in the alkaline media
of bleach in the hypochlorite form. This stabiity is a sort of inverse =


proof that not much HOCl is in bleach. The lack of HOCl  implies =


that temperature will not play the same role in loss of chlorine or
in the dissociation of HOCl which has been the major reason, =


apparently, for the rule that chlorine/water ( and implied incorrectly
about bleach) should be used cold. AJ DeLange also points out =


that hypochlorous acid disproportionates at higher temperatures to
chloride and molecular oxygen, further implying that acidic chlorine
solutions should be kept cold. Such a mechanism doesn't apply
to hypochlorite.


There is another factor which never seems to be discussed and
 that is that even with chlorine/water the higher temperature should
speed up any reaction, at a constant chlorine content.  While limits
on the temperature apparently exist for acid media, no such
limit exists for alkaline media containing chlorine.  This fact gives
us the opportunity to take advantage of the faster  rate of disinfection
at a higher temperature when using bleach.


Along this same line, I thought the new ( to me)  information by Aj
on the mechanism of hypochlorite reaction which  implicated an =


unstable chlorate intermediate which  reacted better at higher
temperatures was important to our understanding on how to use
bleach.  This does not rule out multiple pathways, such as a
hypochlorous acid intermediate, but as I pointed out previously,
the concentration is so low at the high pH of bleach that other
mechanisms must (also) be working. In alkaline media =


hypochlorite disproportionates into chloride and chlorate which
is a strong oxidant/disinfectant particularly at high temperature. =


This mechanism may explain how bleach works independently
of the hypochlorous acid mechanism and suggests to me that =


high temperature bleach is better than colder. The disproportion
mechanism implies to me that higher concentrations of hypochorite
will produce more chlorate, and may even be proportional to the
cube of the concentration at a constant pH .


=46rom the article JimL sent, p 136 ".....using 50ppm available =

kill ( of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis) in =

35             38.7
50             9.3      =




These authors observed a 60 to 65% reduction in killing time
with a 10 C rise in temperature.[ This is essentially a doubling =


of the rate with a 10C rise as in other normal chemical reactions
 -DRB].


After providing several more examples, the authors close with this
summary of the work in alkaline hypochlorite solutions:


 "From all this work, it is evident that an increase in
temperature produces an increase in bactericidal activity."

Subject: Re: Mash Efficiency


Steve Alexander, writing about mash efficiency:


"My opinion is that the published tables are quite erratic and
inconsistent.  I'd use my figures, figures derived from DBCG%&MC%, or
Noonan's figures from New BLB. Noonan uses a slightly different, but
justifiable calculation.  Dave Miller's numbers and the  Zymurgy tables
hard to justify and seem erratic."


I had this concern the other day . . . so why use the coarse grind
number? Wouldn't the fine grind number be a better representation of the
"best" one can do with small batches at home?


Using the fine grind numbers and percent extract quoted by my supplier,
I get numbers that are reasonably consistent with published data. Using
these numbers, my efficiencies are in the mid to high 80's for step /
infusion mashes, and low 90's for decoctions. Using the numbers derived
from the equation you propose, my efficiencies get rather high for my
relatively rudimentary setup (no RIMS or anything). Geez not a single
base malt over 1035 . . . can it really be so?


I like your proposal (from HBD #2594) though. Can we assume you'll
continue to post numbers here?


Looks like you need some data for unmalted adjuncts. I'll contact my
supplier to see if he can help.

When phosphate is added to water containing calcium in even modest amounts
calcium phosphate precipitates. This is probably what was found at the
botom of the pot. At pH 7 water containing phosphate at 0.1 millimole per
liter will be saturated with respect to calcium phosphate at a calcium
level of a couple of mg/L. This is one of the mechanisms by which pH is
reduced when malt is mashed in with water containig calcium.


The water in question was said to have carbonates at 60 ppm and pH 9.7.
This amounts to alkalinity of only about 80 which isn't too bad and
probably doesn't require reduction except for very pale beers. If
alkalinity reduction is contemplated lactic is probably a better choice
than phosphoric because of the phosphate precipitation discussed above.
Removal of  calcium with the phosphate leaves little of it to react with
grist phosphates and mash pH may be higher than desired.

Has anyone ever stumbled across information regarding an ancient beer made
by the Celtics called "korma, courmi or coirm"?


I just stumbled across a reference to it (cited below) in "Guinness
Drinking Companion" by Dunkling.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"The beer of the ancient Celts is various referred to as korma, courmi or
coirm. The second-century Greek physician and writer on medicine,
Dioscorides, said that 'Coirm, being drunk by the Irish instead of wine,
produces headaches, is a compound of bad juices, and does harm to the
muscles.'


>From time to time, in the Irish epic tale Tain Bo Cuailnge, King Conchubar
is said to spend a third of each day feasting, a third watching young
warriors wrestle, a third drinking coirm until he falls asleep."
