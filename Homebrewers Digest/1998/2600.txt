RE:
Slow starting ferment.


Assuming the Nottingham was fresh and viable, sounds like the wort was
someplace too cold for a fast start. Powdered yeasts start fast at 67-68 deg F
or higher, but lag times increase dramaticaly at lower than 65-66. Did you
have this carboy in a cool basement?


Some observations:


I stock and sell Nottingham and Edme in my store. Edme is one of the best
starters and very tolerant of pitching temp for the most part. The Danstar
line, including Nottingham, have very clean flavor profiles and are used by a
lot of very experienced brewers because of their quality. [As has been seen on
the HBD]


I often recommend Edme, in the blue and gold pouch, to novice brewers because
it seems to produce 'good enough' results and no one has ever complained that
it would not start. It also has twice as much yeast in each package. 


Make sure you buy your yeast from someplace that keeps it refrigerated, even
dry yeast. Dry yeast does have a long shelf life, but in the fridge it is at a
constant temp, and stays better.

Subject: Curmi


In HBD 2599 Dan Cole said:


> Has anyone ever stumbled across information regarding an ancient beer
> made by the Celtics called "korma, courmi or coirm"?


>"The beer of the ancient Celts is various referred to as korma, courmi
> or coirm. The second-century Greek physician and writer on medicine,
> Dioscorides, said that 'Coirm, being drunk by the Irish instead of wine,

The account Dan quotes is from Pytheus, a Greek navigator who visted
Britain in the 4th century BC. I think Guinness are pushing their
historical luck a bit to suggest that Pytheus actually visited Ireland, but
you never know.


The following is a snip from one of my (unpblished) books, researched from
various sources, which gives the little that I know about Pytheus and
curmi.


******


It is said that ale was first introduced into Britain by the Celts as early
as 500 bc, but it is fair to assume that ale has been around for as long as
barley has been cultivated, and that predates 500 bc by a few thousand
years. The first solid evidence of beer being made in Britain comes from a
Greek navigator and explorer, Pytheus of Marseilles, who visited Britain in
304 bc. He said of Britain: "The island is thickly populated and has an
extremely chilly climate. The people of Brittania are simple in their
habits and far removed from the cunning and knavishness of modern man. They
are unusually hospitible and gentle in manner. Their diet is inexpensive...
They do not drink wine, but a fermented liquor made from barley, which they
call curmi... It is a compound of bad juices which gives headaches and does
harm to the muscles. It [Britain] has many kings and potentates who live
for the most part in a state of mutual peace."


Pytheus described the method by which the Britons harvested their grain
while it was still green and then dried it so that it would keep. He
described how the drying was performed using fires; the grain being parched
over specially-constructed hearths, the design of which varied from place
to place. He also remarked that grain was one of Britian's chief exports,
as was "clever hunting dogs". 


Unfortunately, Pytheus's original account has been lost and we rely on
other Greek historians, writing much later, to relate his story.
Unfortunately, Pytheus was laughed at because his people did not believe
his fanciful stories of the congealed sea (pack-ice), chunks of solid sea
bigger than his ship (icebergs), or that the sun never set in the far
north, among many other discoveries that his Mediterranean contempories
found laughable. Later writers, such as Strabo (born 63bc), writing some
200 years later, still treated Pytheas's accounts of his travels with
scorn, as if he were a fraud, and much interesting historical information
about Celtic Britain, and probably the production of curmi, has undoubtably
been lost or suppressed.
 
*****


Anyway, botton line is that it seems that the ancient Britons had grain
drying kilns and thus had the technology to make malted barley long before
the Romans popped over for a pint!

Rob Moline asserts:

Interesting. I've not found anything in the literature about how this is
done large scale, but I  have found reference to the fact that during
prohibition, brewers brewed regular beer as the first step towards NA
(which explains how easy it was to slip a live one out now and again).
Now in the late 20's I can figure that they didn't have vacuumm
centrifuges or anything like that level of technology. Anyone with a
loooong memory of how the big boys did it at that time?

Subject: BS


Brewsters:


Although he didn't mention me by name, Rob Moline's comment
about my emotional outburst to Jack S's "lazy brain" , beer-a-day
method of dealing with alcoholism was out of line with the way I
expect myself to deal with  topics here.  But I did it unashamedly =


and I would do it again because the risk of non-experts ( being a
recovering alcoholic like JackS claims does not make him an expert
on treatment)  harming someone else's life by providing such
"information" to others who may be desperately searching for help
is too great.  If someone gives you bad advice on how to brew a
beer, you only lose a batch and learn something in the process. =


That's what this forum is all about. If someone gives you bad advice
on how to deal with alcoholism, we're talking about a serious thing
that can affect someone's, and those around him, whole life from
which they may never recover. I wanted to sound an alarm as loud
as I could and chose this method.


If we want to have a discussion on alcoholism, its identification
and treatment, I think we should use professional papers ( just
like we do beer)  and experts ( treatment professionals)  on the
subject to make short presentations and then discuss those
presentations in light of their applicability.  Definitely not present
a theory without professional support, especially by an admitted
alcoholic in denial like JackS.  You may have read Dr. Dean Fikar's
comments that it *still* is the recent medical opinion that alcoholics
have NO tolerance for alcohol and that there is NO established
lower limit on the amount of alcohol such an afflicted person can
consume.  That was my point and I believe JackS is treading on
dangerous ground and perhaps leading others onto it if he
continues in his present vein.


I quote Dr. Fikar's comments from the January 2, 1998 HBD
because they so perfectly reflect my feelings:


>I'd be willing to bet that there is a problem drinker out there
 in cyberspace
>reading your's and Jack's posts and thinking "maybe, just maybe,

>drinking again in moderation".  If I can save just one alcoholic
 from trying
>to rationalize another attempt at "moderate" drinking then this
 use of =


>HBD bandwith is worth it. =




Thanks, Rob, for giving me the chance to explain myself on this matter.

I never claimed to have read it.  What did I miss in your post that justifies
your dangerous claim that alcoholics can have a drink per day and not be at

Sounds like that's what you're doing by implying that alcoholics can drink one
drink per day and be OK.  Maybe you can but most can't.

>
My point is that many/most alcoholics are OK as long they stay completely
away from the stuff.  The ones that get into trouble once they dry out
are the ones that try what you advocate.  Why gamble on further serious
health risk for the sake of one drink per day.

So do I. ;-)


I truly think it's great that you've got such great control over your drinking
now. I just don't want any recovering alcoholic out there who might read this
digest to think it's OK to go against the advice that they have undoubtedly
been given by professionals and go back to drinking alcohol in any amount. 
Many have died by believing that they could start drinking in moderation
again.

From: KennyEddy <KennyEddy`at`aol.com>
Subject: Electric Brewing


A couple of people have posted about mashing/brewing with electric elements &
plastic buckets.  I'd like to chime in since I have a bit of experience with
this topic.


*Done properly*, electric elements will not caramelize wort to any noticible
degree.  I have brewed both a Witbier and a Classic American Pilsner, two very
light and delicate beers, with no darkening or caramelization, certainly no
more than one would get with any other means.


The key is how much power passes to the wort through how much surface area.
Concentrating all the heat in one square inch will give much different results
with respect to caramelization & scorching than passing the same power through
100 square inches.  Using the right elements will prevent any problems.  My
system runs at about 25 watts/square inch; I've estimated in the past that a
typical cajun-cooker & keg setup may see as much as 50 W/sq-in or more.  If
these brewers can routinely make light-colored beers, than certainly I can at
half the power density.


As for operation from US 120V mains, that question is a bit trickier.  Warm-up
times are directly proportional to the power used (which in turn is volts
times amps) as well as to the volume of liquid in question.  Since your 120V
source is fused at 15 or 20 amps, you're limited to 120 x 15 or 120 x 20 =
1800 to 2400 watts.  1800W will bring 5 gallons of water from room temp to
strike or sparge temp in about 40 minutes, or 10 gallons in 1 hour 20 minutes.
2400W would do these jobs in 30 minutes and 1 hour, respectively.  This
assumes you have the full current capacity of that circuit branch available
exclusively for your brewing (usually not the case).  A friend of mine built
an electric brew bucket that tripped the breaker even though his draw was
about 15A and he used a 20A kitchen outlet; he later discovered the cirucit
was shared by the fridge.


My solution was to use the 240V dryer outlet, and split the 240V into two
separate 120V lines.  The dryer outlet is fused for 30A, though the 120V
components I used (GFI's and other standard electrical fixtures) are rated at
20A.  But since I don't do laundry when I brew, I can count on the full power
available from these two 2400W supplies.


My vessels use two 240V/4800W elements each, with each one operating at 120V
for 1125W.  My boiler is not insulated, and I believe adding a wrap of
insulation would allow a decent boil of five gallons of wort using just one
such element on 120V (about 10 amps).  While heating times for striking &
sparging and heating to boiling would be extended, it's still in the practical
range.  For an extract brew, where only the main batch heatup is relevent,
it's fine.


I have a detailed description of my electric brewery on my web page at


http://members.aol.com/kennyeddy


Please note that the information in this post and the information on my web
page is not by any means intended to be a complete and foolproof instruction
on building an electric brewery.  Electricity is potentially deadly and
working with it requires skill and care.  This is not a stock disclaimer but a
serious call for caution.  Should you wish to undertake such a project,
*please* seek the advice and help of a qualified electrician or engineer.  A
trade of a few homebrews is often bribe enough.

Subject: Re: Newbie kegger 


I did the "how many batches" calculation a while back.  I'll try to
reconstruct it.


1 liter of CO2 at standard temperature and pressure (STP = 0C / 1 atm)
weighs just about 2 grams.  This is "1 volume" of CO2 for carbonating
1 liter of beer.  5 gallons is 19 liters (call it 20 for simplicity.)


Suppose you carbonate your beers to 2.5 "volumes", and dispense at 14
lbs (1 atm gauge = 2 atm absolute).  Assuming the beer has 1 volume of
CO2 dissolved in it out of the fermenter (not a bad assumption),
you'll use 30 liters to carbonate, and 40 liters to push it out of the
keg.  Assume that you use another 40 liters pushing liquid between
kegs when sanitizing.  That's a total of 110 liters per batch = 220
grams.


10 lbs is about 4500 grams, which is about 20 x 220.  So, under these
assumptions, you should get at least 20 batches from one 10 lb keg.
If you carbonate less, push at a lower pressure, or use less CO2
moving sanitizer around, then you'll get more batches.

Subject:  Corma


Dan Cole asks in HBD 2599:
'Has anyone ever stumbled across information regarding an ancient beer made by
the Celtics called "korma, courmi or coirm"?'


>From Lt. Colonel Robert Gayre's *Wassail! In Mazers of Mead*, 1986, Brewer's
Publications, Chapter IV, Mead Among Celt, Slav and Finn:


"Pliny, speaking of the British Celts, tells us that 'these islanders consume
great quantities of honey-brew' (mead).  We also learn that it was drunk by the
Gauls, in nearby France, where we learn they had a rich mead called zythus and a
less generous one known as corma."


I would guess this corma to have been dry mead, as fully fermented lower honey
meads must be.  There are lots of sources for information on making dry mead in
the beer to barleywine gravity range, including the referenced work, Papazian's
books, FAQ's available on the Brewery website and links.  


If the Irish were drinking their corma before fermentation was complete, it
would have been powerful, harsh, possibly with harshness obscured by the
sweetness of unfermented sugar.  Phenols and higher alcohols from spontaneous,
high temperature fermentation could certainly produce headaches.  A nice nap
does help rejuvenate those muscles ;-)


I know from my own experience, if you make mead, be prepared to wait for it to
become the Nectar of Gods and Heroes.  My first batch is just now becoming

As a satisfied customer of Jack's products, I sure would like to see
his instructions for the MIXMASTER(R).  I find that Jack has an uncanny
ability to reduce brewing complexity by providing quality, KIS (Keep It
Simple)
products.


So Jack, if you don't plan to market this product, please let your satisfied
customers benefit from your insight.


BTW, oil or not, plain old corn makes for a fine adjunct.

In Charlie P's book he discusses assembling a "zapap" lauter tun from
two "food grade" five gallon buckets.  How does one tell if one of these
ubiquitous white pails is actually "food grade" as they all seem to be
made of HDPE with various markings molded into their bottoms.


Thank You Curt Sutliff

What the duvel is a mixmasher?  It would be interesting to see what you
have developed, I am sure the HBD gadgeteers would love to read about
it. I would toss my RSMS in a second and built your new thingy if I
thought it would give me better mash process control and make brew day
easier.  Although, I think C.D. Pritchard has already beat you to it.
He has developed a mechanical mash stirring device that is detailed on
his web site, look in the Brewery for the URL.


Please don't post if your message will include condescending quips,
private email would be better.
