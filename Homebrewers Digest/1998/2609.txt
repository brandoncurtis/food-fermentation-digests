This idea is not my own, but I used it with some success...


One problem with the bucket-in-bucket or piece-of-a-bucket-in-bucket 
lautering setup is heat loss during sparging.  Many large hardware 
chains (Lowes, Home Depot, etc.) now sell insulation that is best 
described as aluminized bubble wrap.  By wrapping this material 
around your bucket, you can stabilize the heat of the grain bed 
during sparging.
I used this setup for over a year with good results.  I just recently 
converted to the perforated pizza pan inside a 7 gallon Rubbermaid 
water cooler and love the new setup.  It allows me to mash a good bit 
more grain and to maintain mash/lautering temps much better...and the 
whole thing cost me less than $30.
Hoppy New Year!

Subject: MIXMASHER vs RIMS


Scott Murman challenged Jack Schmidling's assertion that an insulated cooler
mash tun limited the complexity of a step mash program saying that adding
heated water would handle that problem.
In my experience mashing with a10 gallon insulated cooler mash tun, the number
of steps is definitely limited.  It gets difficult to raise the mash temp even
with boiling water without running out of room.  I like the cooler mash tun
but I don't do more than two steps.  Even with one step I cannot always
bring the mash temp to 170 for mash out.  I don't find that much of an
impediment, however, but limited number of steps might be a problem with less
modified malts.


Which reminds me, does anyone have opinions about Weyerman pils malt?  I just
bought a bag and am wondering if I need protein rests.

Does anyone know what the grain bill and/or hop schedule is for
Duvel? Michael Jackson implies that the grain bill is 80% locally
malted barley (from France?), something like a pilsner malt, with
20% dextrose. He claims they do an infusion mash, and they do 3
hop additions of Styrian and Saaz.


I am wondering how Moorgat (sp?) gets such a nice, sweet finishing
creamy flavor/feel out of Jackson's description? Any ideas?

     >so bad, but... opinions?
     
     Don't know, but I doubt the corn sugar versus malt is the culprite.  
     If you think about all the sugars in the world, some of which are 
     simple and fermentable and don't leave sweetness as a result, others 
     of which are moderately simple and don't ferment but are nearly 
     flavorless and hence are not sweet, and others that are more complex 
     and not fermentable, and also flavorless and wouldn't provide 
     sweetness, then you start to see why I state my opinion.  Corn sugar 
     should be 100% fermentable, and the only way it could contribute 
     perceived sweetness would be by increasing the alcohol content a bit, 
     but priming contributes _very little_, percentage wise, to the alcohol 
     and shouldn't be the source of any sweetness.  Malt extract contains a 
     variety of sugars in varying proportions.  Same thing applies as for 
     the corn sugar for the 100% fermentable sugars.  The nonfermentables 
     are known for not having any (or very little) flavor and should not be 
     contributing to the residual sweetness either.  Sweetness is a hard 
     thing to pin down as to what causes it, BUT maltier beers and higher 
     alcohol (to a point) beers are both perceived by most tasters as being 
     more sweet.  I'd start with that in your analysis, then take a look at 
     alcohol percentages and final gravities for a key to why some of your 
     beers have more residual sweetness.  Oh yeah, it's possible that some 
     of the sweet tasting fermentable sugars did not get fermented, e.g. a 
     stuck ferment.  Your final gravities ought to tell you more about 
     this, e.g. check the typical attenuations for your yeast selection 
     against the reality of your brewing.

     >to control temps, and what temps to use?
     
     Easiest way I have found to maintain the correct temperature for a 
     steep is to first heat the water to about 5 degrees warmer than you 
     need, say 165 F or so, then drop the grains in it, and heating if 
     necessary to get the temperature between 155 F and 160 F.  Now for the 
     secret: prior to doing this, preheat your oven on it's lowest setting 
     and dink around with it to get a temperature of around 150-160F.  This 
     takes less work than you think, and is nothing more than a casual 
     endeavor you undertake while getting your other brewing stuff in 
     order.  Once your steep (water and grist) is at the right temp, just 
     turn off the oven and put your pot in it for the duration of the 
     steep.  The warm environment will hold the temperature to within about 
     2 degrees of what it was going in.  Works like a champ.  I also 
     perform my mashes in this way, using a 33-qt canner to hold the mash 
     so it'll fit in the oven (lowest rack).

     I don't think of it as a bad thing, because I like the caramelization 
     flavor in the type of beers that I brew.  It's a bad thing if it's 
     inappropriate to the style, e.g. light lagers, pale ales etc.  Easiest 
     fix is to put a trivet or zig-zag bend coat hanger wire on the burners 
     to separate the pot from the electric burners a bit.  Also try lining 
     the top of your stove with foil, shiny side up, for shorter heating 
     times and more consistent heating (and easy boilover cleanup).

     >gentle boil, what?
     
     Start timing after you reach a full rolling boil.  In fact, I believe 
     in boiling for 20-30 minutes to get a solid hot break prior to adding 
     the hops, and only start timing at the point where the first hops went 
     in.  The only exception to this is if you are trying to make a very 
     lightly colored brew.  In that case, start timing as soon as it 
     reaches a rolling boil, but don't hesitate to add the hops right away, 
     and you can shorten the boil to 30 minutes (total) if you need to, 
     making sure your hop charge is adjusted up to make up for the lower 
     extraction rate, e.g. 30 minute boil versus 60 or 90 minutes.

     Aging (conditioning) may help.  Hop choice may help.  Hop amount (use 
     less) may help.  Extra long (2 to 3 hours) boils may help (protein 
     that came out of solution at the hot break redissolves during long 
     boils).  Buy the AOB Classic Series book on Scotch and Scottish Ales 
     and read it for hints on Scottish brewing techniques and recipes.

     I have heard of at least one other case where HSA problems were traced 
     to non-delicate handling of hot mash, e.g. 'plopping' it into a lauter 
     tun.  But others have had no problems.  Could be that the people who 
     did, were also pushing the limits on the hot aeration (or aeration at 
     an improper time) in other ways too.  Darker beers should be more 
     bullet proof as the melanoidins help to prevent staling and oxidation. 
      Lighter beers will require more delicate handling.
     
     How to tell?  Classic symptoms include wine or sherry-like flavors in 
     the beer, or wet cardboard 'staleness' in the beer.  The flavors may 
     be absent at first and develop over time.  But by the time you had to 
     transfer your mash, you were pretty well invested in the brew and may 
     as well continue.  If it happens again, transfer the mash gently and 
     without plopping, into the other vessel and you shouldn't have any 
     problems.  I've never taken the risk of 'plopping' my mash around, so 
     I can't tell you how much is too much.  If the beer has a hint of off 
     flavor to it, throw a big party and use it up quickly before it stales 
     further!

Greetings HBD
        I'm going to start studing for the BJCP ex. . Are there any judges 
in the Lancaster PA area that can give me a hand starting? I'll be in that 
area working for the next 6 month staying in a motel and I can't thing of a 
better thing to do with my spare time than studing beer since I can't brew. 
I've started getting the study material around and have downloaded the guide 
from the BJCP web page. 
        I'll also need a place to study at can any one help me out with the 
names of some good beer bars in the Lancaster PA area? Is there still an 
active homebrew club in Lancaster? The phone at the AHA club page is old and 
he did not know if the club was still working.

Subject: Mash Aeration


In HBD#2605 John Wilkinson reported on problems he had with his mash
stirrer:


> ...Anyway, I was having a lot of problems with stuck runoffs and
> had a thick layer of teig (sp?) on top of the grain.  I fought

I often suspect mash aeration to cause stuck runoffs but in this 
case it's obvious! Among other things, mash aeration can cause 
excessive formation of teig (doughy precipitate) depending on barley 
strain and deg. of modification.


Cysteine, Cystine and gel-proteids can form polypeptides of higher MW
under the conditions of oxygenation. The resulting precipitate adsorbs
glutelines and lipids. Small granules of starch as well as b-glucans
and pentosans participate in complex formation and increase "teig"
even further. This in turn will hinder amylases and thus starch
conversion, lower yield and / or attenuation. [1]


But these are only the visible effects in the early stage of brewing.
Far more complex are the effects of oxygenation on polyphenols. Simply
said: their composition is altered in a negative way.


 - Due to activity of peroxidase (T opt.=3D45C, destroyed at about 65C)
and polyphenoloxidase (T opt.=3D65C, destroyed at about 85C!!!)
polyphenols are oxidized and polymerized. Thus the ratio of unwanted,
oxidized HMW polyphenols to desirable, intact Anthocyanogenes and
Tannoides is increased. The resulting beers are darker [4], show off
flavors and have low flavor stability (shelf live). [1] [2]


IMHO intact Tannoids are very desirable in craft brewed beers. - K.F.
Kretschmer underlines the reductive potential of Tannoids and their
importance on both flavor and flavor stability. He even goes so far to
positively correlate Tannoid content and success of various premium
beers. [3]


*****


I had years of experience to study the effects of mash aeration! I
provide primitive brewing methods for wheat beer, intended to support
beginners in regions, where homebrewing supplies are not established
yet and the usual schedule: extract brewing -> all grain doesn't work.
Keeping the equipment as simple as possible lead to some HSA-prone
techniques. But what worked and still works very well for wheat and
some ales doesn't so for lagers! I had a hard way to find this out.


The safest way for me to avoid mash aeration and provide reductive
wort composition is:


* Mashing in an insulated mash- lautertun.
* Adding infusion water and decoctions at once or - better yet - by 
  underletting it through a valve at the bottom of the mashtun.
* Stirr gently until temp is evenly.
* During rests only stirr every 10 mins to raise the grain.
* Keeping the pre-boil wort in the kettle under a layer of finest   
  Tettnanger hops - a.k.a. First wort hopping ;-)


To conclude - mash aeration can lead to *very serious* problems, 
maybe even bigger problems than with post boil hot wort aeration! We 
had to sample many aged lagers and I strongly appeal to everyone in 
this collective: When designing mash mixers use all your creative 
potential to avoid creating a mash aerator. Mash aerators would be a 
big step in the wrong direction!

From: ajdel`at`mindspring.com (AJ)
Subject: RO/Phosphoric-Lactic/pH


John Bovoard asks whether a reduction in TDS from 260-360 ppm to less than
50 ppm by his RO unit is effective. I'm not sure whether John wants to know
if water at 50 ppm has been effectively deionized in terms of suitability
for brewing or whether I think the RO unit is working properly. Assuming
the former is meant, the answer would be "Yes" in general. Water with a
mineral content of less than 50 ppm is definitely "soft". Pilsen, known for
its very soft water, has a TDS level of about 35 ppm and the water from
this RO unit, at less than 50 ppm, should be soft enough for the brewing of
Pilsner beer. For many other styles augmentation of the mineral content
will be required.


As for whether the unit is performing effectively: RO units of the type
usually installed in homes should reduce ion content by at least 90% for
all common species and by more than that for most species. Thus I'd expect
to see TDS levels at less than 26 - 36 ppm from a properly functioning
unit. The manufacturer should be able to supply you with performance data
showing how much each of several species is reduced. There is, of course,
the issue of maintenance of the equipment. Particulate and activated carbon
pre-filters must be changed fairly frequently or contamination/poisoning of
the RO membrane will result with reduced performance.


As RO units remove a percentage of the dissolved ions, pre-treatment, as
by, for example, boiling to reduce calcium, bicarbonate and magnesium ion
concentrations, would result in lower levels of those ions at the output of
the RO unit if it were fed with pre-treated water rather than water from
the mains. This may not be practical as the unit requires line pressure for
operation and this pressure would have to be supplied by a pump.


Finally, be aware that TDS values are usually approximations based upon
conductivity measurements. It would be best to have individual tests done
for sulfates, hardness, chlorides, alkalinity, etc on both the
pre-treatement and post-treatment water. Values for post treatment ion

There has been some discussion of the relative merits of lactic vs
phosphoric acid for sparge water pH adjustment. I'd vote for lactic based
on its availability in small quantities at most of the better stocked
homebrew shops and on its being somewhat safer to handle. You might find
phosphoric more flavor-neutral but flavor shouldn't be an issue since we
would hope that people would not be sparging with water alkaline enough to
require enough acid to have a flavor effect. If the water is that alkaine
it should be treated to reduce the alkalinity (boiling or lime addition
should do the job in the majority of cases).


Phosphoric does pull calcium - this is not a rumor - and I suppose you
could argue that this is a reason to prefer lactic but not very
convincingly. We need calcium mostly so that phosphates from malt can pull
it and thus lower mash pH. This takes place at the pH of the strike water
and, as much less precipitation will occur at the lower pH of kettle wort
and fermenting beer, there should be plently left for other duties provided
that the mash-in precipitation didn't drop it all out. At pH 5, for
example, 10 mg/L calcium is in equilibrium with approximately 70 mMol/L
total phosphate.


The question I always ask is "Do you really need to acidify the sparge
water?". If the sparge water is of low alkalinity (regardless of its pH) it
will have a hard time competing with the buffering capacity of the
mash/wort and pH will rise slowly. If you've decoction mashed you've
already extracted tannins (yes, yes, I know the pH is lower but tannins
still get extracted - getting them to complex and drop out is one of the
reasons for lagering in traditional brewing) and you're not as sensitive to
additional extraction at sparge.


Check runoff pH and gravity as you sparge. If pH stays below 5.5 or 6 to
the point where runoff gravity is, say, 4 P, ask yourself if you really
need the 40 grams of extract that comes with the next liter of runoff. Have
you had score sheets come back with comments about astringecy on them?  The
bottom line is that you must experiment, take notes, solicit the opinions
of your "customers" and figure out what works best for you.


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


Adam Rich asked about when to measure pH. Opinions vary. There are those
who say you never need to measure it (just as there are those who say you
don't need to measure gravity) and there are those who say it should be
measured throughout the brewing process. That said, the most critical
measurement is the one at dough-in. If the pH doesn't fall into that 5.2 -
5.6 range at dough-in it very probably isn't going to be at the desired
levels at other stages unless some remedial action is taken. Some brewers
(especially pro's) take pH readings on the strike water, the mash, each
decoction (if any), the main mash after each decoction is returned, the
sparge water, the runoff at various times towards the end of collection,
the collected wort before and after the boil, the beer at various times
during the fermentation and the finished beer. There are definite expected
behaviors and deviations from them are indications that something is amiss.




Assuming that only one measurement is to be done, do it at dough-in after
the grain is thoroughly hydrated and has had the opportunity to sit for a
few minutes. If a temperature compensated (ATC) meter with a modern (glass
or epoxy which will withstand the mash temperature - no calomel!) electode
with KCl electrolyte is being used, stick the electrode and ATC probe into
the mash and note the reading when the meter is stabilized. The meter must
have been calibrated with standard buffers first. For other meters (won't
withstand mash temperature, no ATC, unknown electrolyte...) or test strips,
calibrate (meters only) at room temperature, cool sample to room
temperature and read. Now subtract 0.1 - 0.2 units from the reading whether
a meter or test strip was used. This is necessary because in brewing pH
values are properly specified at the temperature of the reaction and pH
changes as a function of temperature. Note that this is NOT the same as the
change in reading of a pH meter in response to a change in temperature but
an entirely separate phenomenon.

The practice of filtering homebrew and force-carbonating in a keg has
become pretty common. My homebrew shop sells maybe a couple set-ups
(pretty much variations on wine filters); probably yours does too. One
of last year's Zymurgy's did an evaluation of filters, and they were far
from equal. I think they were getting down close to sub-micron levels of
filtration. The beer has to be forced through; typically either a
garden-sprayer type mechanisim is used, or a corny keg using CO2 to push
the beer through (and into another corny).

Subject: step mashing


Last weekend I brewed my first lager, a Czech pilsener. The recipe
called for a protein rest for 15 minutes between 130-134 degrees and
then a 45 minute rest between 158-160. Reading Fred Eckhardt's account =


of his steam beer in Zymurgy's great grain issue convinced me to give it =


a try. Up until this point I had been doing single infusion mashes using =
an insulated bucket with false bottom that I received as a gift (ordered =
from William's Brewing Company).


My 9 lbs. of grain barely fit into my 19 qt. enamel canning pot. Things =


seemed to go pretty well but there was quite a bit of temperature
variance at different depths and areas of the pot. Note I took the
temperature at 5 minute intervals to chart my progress. At times there =


was as much as a 12 degree difference in different spots of the pot. How =


should I control such temperature variance? Should I pretty much be
constantly stirring in a round and upward motion? Does stirring cause
hot side aeration?


Also, given that I was mashing in an enamel canning pot I had to
transfer the mash into my lauter tun (which doubles as my mash tun for =


single infusion mashes). For the most part, I ladled the mash with a
quart pyrex measuring cup and then near the end a soup ladel. What
effect would pouring the mash from the canning pot to the lauter tun
(insulated bucket with false bottom) have. Would pouring it cause more =


hot side aeration than ladling?


As you can see, I have quite a few questions regarding step mashing.
Overall, I enjoyed the process but the verdict is still out on my
pilsener. I am even thinking about trying a decoction sometime this
winter.

RIMS Temp Control Options


This is nothing new but another option for RIMS temp control besides an
on/off switch or an automated electronic controller is using a dimmer
switch.  I have been using the dial type where you turn the knob, not
the slider type.  It is not automated, but I can stabilize the temp and
the heat setting in about 5 minutes after I reach my rest temp.  It
usually does not vary by more than plus/minus one degree after it has
been adjusted.  While not automated, it was a compromise for me between
cost and complexity.  Being electronically spastic, I could have never
built the Morris RIMS control circuit, and I could not afford $200 for a
PID.  The dimmer switch costs about $20, and the 1000 Watt type *may*
work when using the 4500W/240V element with 120 V.  I am not advocating
the use of an undersized dimmer switch, as has been stated before, 
working with electricity can be dangerous.  I am just telling you what
has worked for me.  Would I love to add the PID someday?  You betcha!


I hope the RIMS and mix mashing thread has not given the impression that
this is the best or only way to make beer at home.  I and many other
HBDers have made great beers mashing with a pot on the stove and
stirring like crazy with a wooden spoon.  IMO it is interesting to read
about the creative mashing systems other brewers have built.


************************************************************************
E-Communication


All the comments regarding the Jack S threads have made me realize just
how careful you have to be when you are communicating electronically in
a public forum such as the HBD.  If comments are not worded carefully
their intentions can very easily be misunderstood by the recipient and
the audience.  As one HBDer implied, you must go out of your way and be
extremely polite and courteous with your comments so that others do not
misconstrue your intentions and become offended.  Maybe thats how those
little smiley face thingys came about :)!


************************************************************************
Tin Followup


I received some good responses regarding my tin questions, and was able
to find out some additional info searching the web.  Tin is non-toxic in
general, and in safe amounts appears to be required by the body.  I
could not find the maximum safe daily limits for tim, maybe one of the
health professionals in the HBD has access to a reference that lists
this.  Tin will leach into an acidic solution.  Those using tin elements
reported no scorching problems or cleanup problems.  The only question I
have now is if tin causes haze in the finished beer.  In Miller's first
book he indicates that tin will cause haze.  I realize this is probably
page down material but it is good for the archives.


I was not able to purchase a stainless alloy sheath heating element in
my area and was considering using the element that is copper plated with
tin.  One of the HBDers read my original tin post and was gracious
enough to offer to purchase a Chromalox stainless sheath element and
mail it to me, with my reimbursement to follow in the mail.  Thanks very
much to Mr. R. K. for helping me out!

his writings take on the auora of dogma that always applies

I doubt that I have (or could have) ever disagreed with anything
George has ever written.  However, I keep in mind that he is speaking
to and for a much larger audience than the small batch, homebrew
community.


Even where the theory applies to small batches, there is no reason
to assume that the actual effect could be tasted, seen, smelled or
in any way even detected in the small batch.


"Here is a reference which relates to temperature gradients in the mash

"In some mashing systems, precise temperature control is problematic,
which creates a situation where two or more temperature regimes may
coexist in the mash at a given rest. 


"This may relate to mash mixing, but does it relate to RIMS?  Does the
liquid part of the mash that is recirculated create the same shearing
problems as with mixing? 


Frankly, I do not see how pumping liquid through a fixed  grain
bed can even come close to the near zero temperature gradient of
a continuous mix.  There has got to be a measureable difference
between the liquid at the bottom and that coming out of the heater.
If not, there would be no need for a heater.  When my mixer is 
running I can NOT measure any difference between the wort near the
top and that on the bottom.

""Like so many other buzzwords, HSA makes great raw material for

""relatively slow movement and temperatures we deal with during mash.


"I was able to find one reference on HSA:


"We also can control the amount of oxygen uptake and the amount of
hot-side abuse that takes place during mashing.  The evidence
documenting the negative effects of hot-side aeration is extensive."
(Fix, same, p 25)


"This can lead to the following problems:


But you failed to point out what "this" is.  He is simply telling
us to "control" it, i.e., don't use the business end of an P51 
for a mixer.


"As Jack S pointed out, RIMS is subjected to HSA just as is mix 
mashing.  With RIMS, the key is to ensure no air is entrained on the 
suction side of the pump, and to design the wort return manifold
so that the exit velocity is slow enough to avoid wort foaming.


That is not the end of the story.  Contrary to popular opinion an 
aquarium aerator does not oxygenate the aquarium by absorbtion
from all those cute little bubbles. Their surface area is 
insignificant compared to the top of the water.  What the bubbles 
or pump do/does is to keep the surface water moving so there is 
always new surface for oxygen to be absorbed from the air.


The quietest RIMS in the world simply acts like an aquarium water
pump (not to be confused with the air pump type).  It very quitely
and invisibly keeps the surface water moving to absorb as much
oxygen as possible.


Can this cause the notorious HSA?  I seriously doubt it.


Could a P51?  Probably but that would be the least of the problems.


Then we have to ask, how bout a small submarine?  Nuke powered,
of course.  A snorkle would cause too much foam.

Brewsters:


Over the Christmas holidays in preparation for a party, I accidentally
over-carbonated a naturally carbonated Cornie of lager
 ( doing several other beers in a row, after a 5u filtration,
I hit it with 50psi and shook it. OOOPS)  I should have
measured it first with my keg pressure gauge, but didn't. At a
keg pressure of 22 psig, can you say foam? You could walk
on this stuff. Can you say Marx Brothers if you try to release the
pressure from the "IN" side, since it foams up and out the
connection?


Any ideas on how to deal with this?  I thought about putting an
extra long hose from the keg to my CP bottler to minimize the flow
rate, but that will mean I will have to pressure the bottle to 22psig
to keep it from foaming. And then when I go to cap it???? Once I get
the keg volume part of the way down then it shouldn't be a problem. =


I could also do this with a keg to keg transfer and this may be easier.
I would have dealt with it sooner, but the outdoor temperature went
up from 20F to 60F over the whole season so it was tough to get it =


to near freezing to reduce the pressure. But who's complaining about
Spring in January? Any ideas? Comments? Experience?

and I'm going to try that by sampling into a cold metal spoon.
This should be a big step over the brown pH paper which changes
to a different shade of brown, as is now available in HB stores.
