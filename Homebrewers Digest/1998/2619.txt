Michael Dingas asked about how to re-use/extend the life of a smackpack of
liquid yeast.


Personally I haven't tried this one, but I like the idea.  Check Alan and
Melissa's brew page (specifically link to
http://www.magma.ca/~bodnsatz/brew/tips/yeast/culture.html  Then See
"Culturing for the Rest of Us" near the bottom of the page.


In short the idea is to brew a mini-batch of unhopped beer, then bottle it
with all the yeast in suspension.  In other words swirl the carboy to get
all the yeast suspended, then bottle and cap as normal.  Each bottle becomes
the equivalent of a smackpack (or better) and can be used in a starter for
an upcoming batch, or probably to pitch directly into an upcoming batch.
There's more detail to the procedure on their page.

Subject: Step vs. Infusion




Hey, since I posted my non-scientific support of step mashing, something
came to mind that I didn't mention.


I infuse my first step with a water:malt ratio of 1 qt water to 1 pound of
malt.  Sorry to those that use "real" units of measure, I've just not made
that transition yet.


Anyhow, I start with 1 qt/pound for an initial temp rest of 135 deg F.
After my protease rest (20 to 30 minutes), I then infuse 0.25 quarts /
pound of boiling water.  Then, I add heat (converted kegs) to get to my
saccharification temp.


This turns out to be kind of a combination of step mashing (40-60-70, ala
Fix) and infusion mashing.  I hold my saccharification rest at 150 to 158,
depending on what I wanted in a final product.


I use the "infusion" temp for saccharification, because I could more easily
predict final gravities and dextrin content than I could by using the 60
and 70 deg C rests for various intervals.  I didn't have the time to do
multiple trials with various times at 60 and 70 deg C to learn what degree
of fermentability I could achieve with various times.  It just was easier
at the time, and works well for me.


Unfortunately, a lot of things get done for the wrong reasons (read that as
a guilty plea) but accomplish the right outcome.  They become a means to an
end.


Anyhow, could the ratio of water to grain in the various steps influence
whether a brewer favors or disfavors step mashing?  Hmm....

Subject: Yeast Aeration,


Brewsters:


Sam Mize puzzles over when to oxygenate a fermentation and
suggests considering repeated oxygenation during the early
stages of fermentation.


I suppose as long as the yeast were in a growth phase, =


oxygenation wouldn't hurt, but the risk is of course oxidation
of the wort.  As I and others have already commented, the main
reason for oxygenation is to have a yeast colony which
can be re-used and finish out a fermentation reliably with =


no unwanted aldehydes. Although the Brits successfully do
this by oxygenation of the wort in the main fermentation
( aldehydes are not a major problem for most British style beers,
but can be a problem for most lagers) and others have reported
success with growing starters in the constant presence of air by
stirring, the risk of aldehydes and beer staling is present.


Other than AJ DeLAnge's comment that some British brewers
oxygenate the yeast just before pitching, to my knowledge, no one
here has reported the oxygenation of a full pitching size of  yeast,
ale or especially lager.  Without the presence of wort, I don't know =


how successful this oxygenation would be, but this may be a partial
solution to preventing oxidation of the wort while giving a healthy
yeast colony.


If a small quantity of wort or malt extract were fermented using =


the entire pitching quantity of yeast with continuous stirring in
air or oxygen before pitching, followed by settling or centrifuging
and pouring off the spent starter beer to get rid of the aldehydes =


in the solution, this would seem to be ideal and practical. =




Anyone tried this?

First, a hearty thank you for the in-depth discussions and posts here on

more I value the hbd.  I'll turn into a

QUESTION: Do competitions accept entries in PET bottles?


I've been bottling in PET for about 5 years.  I'm getting kegs soon, but
I'd like to enter some brew into competitions.  I suppose after I start
kegging I'll have to get gadgety and build a counter pressure filler, but I
don't want to have to get bottling equipment after getting kegs.


Any advice would be appreciated! Email also welcome.

I bought an ice cream freezer for this very thing.  I found it a little more
difficult to adapt than I expected.  The drive is an octagonal recess (female)
which I managed to fit by finding a square nut large enough, drilling through
it, and pinning it to my mixer shaft.  Before I actually tried it on a mas I
made ice cream using the motor and noticed it ran pretty fast.  I decided
it was too fast and abandoned that tack.  I ended up using a gear motor I
bought.  As I mentioned in a post last week, I have decided that that stirrer
was causing stuck sparges for me, and that motor turns at only 28 rpm.
perhaps the problem is not the speed but my crude mixer blades.
Whatever the reason, I have abandoned my auto mixer.  I would be afraid
that even with better mixer blades an ice cream freezer motor would be too
fast, though.  I now use mine just to make ice cream.  That is not bad, though.

Apocalypse, world famine and loss of rainforest habitat.  However, your
beer will still be good.  It just won't be Great Beer.


Some of the unwanted proteins will redissolve out of the hot break, and
you'll get some kind of flavors from steeping the cooked hops.

Whirlpool, THEN strain.  So why whirlpool?  To settle the trub to the
bottom, so you can leave it in the pot.


I did this Monday.  I dipped out the top 2/3 of the wort and ran it all
through the strainer without it clogging.  I wound up with almost-dry trub
in the trash, and ALL my wort in the fermenter.


Siphoning, you'll get more trub in the fermenter, and leave a pint of wort
in the pot (with a partial boil, that pint is concentrated money).


I did a full boil.  However, I've whirlpooled partial boils, which
experience suggests that you, too, can leave a LOT of trub in the pot if
you pour gently (without stirring up the trub layer).  You may find it
easier to dip out the top half with a tumbler, to lighten the pot before
pouring out the rest.  (I dipped from my full boil with a gallon pitcher.)

Been there, done that, re-pasteurized a batch after mucking it through
with my hand (heavy wort, pellet hops and chocolate -- two ounces clogged
the strainer).


> Any tips?


Chill below 100F, whirlpool and settle.  (I don't know if the whirlpool
really matters with this method, but I suspect it helps compact the trub.)


Use a kitchen strainer as a pre-strainer, so your funnel will clog less.
Or just use the kitchen strainer.  It's got a big filtering surface, and
it's easy to dump.  You only need to get most of the hops and hot break,
not every last solid particle.  In fact, a little cold break may provide
yeast nutrition.


When the strainer or filter clogs, don't wait for it to drain, or try to
shake through "just a little more."  Pour out the liquid so you can dump
the trub.


But don't pour the liquid back into the brew pot.  The strainer is full of
suspended trub.  You'll just re-strain the same trub several times.


Pour the liquid from the strainer into a sanitized bowl.  Knock the trub
out of the strainer, then pour the bowl of trub-heavy wort back into the
strainer.  Repeat if it re-clogs.  Dump the strainer again and you're
ready for more from the pot.  Since you're not re-straining the same trub,
you'll only do this three or four times (unless you use 7 pounds of
extract, 4 oz of hops, 8 oz of molasses and an 8 oz chocolate bar).


 - - - - -


By the way, I chill by floating a foil roasting pan on my wort and putting
ice in it.  Heat-sanitize for a minute with the hot trub (AFTER the boil),
dump out the water as the ice melts.  I cool five gallons in less than an
hour, it takes one 88-cent bag of ice, no siphon or other equipment.


I heat the pan AFTER the boil for fear that a big flat pan will catch and
combine several boil bubbles, making one big uberbubble that could spray
hot wort all over the kitchen (and me).


Best,
Sam Mize

I take exception with both statements.


You cannot have a meaningful discussion regarding mashing regimens (single, 
multi, decoct, whatever) without including the grain bill. Step mashing 
fully modified Pale Ale malt cannot be compared with step mashing 
undermodified pale malts such as pils or lager malts. Please include what 
types of malts you are using when conversing about mashing processes.

Clearly I messed up when I said that if your laeuter tun is between
1.5 and 3 square feet you should run off at a rate of 7 gallons per
hour.  We had better wait for the formulas to be posted.


In my system, my tun is about 14 or 15" in diameter and I have had

>>      There have been some comments recently about oxygen passing thru
the walls of plastic fermenters with resulting off-taste.  I am using an
S-type air lock, which is a form of manometer. While fermenting, the
pressure in the vessel supports a 2-inch approx column of water so the
pressure inside is greater than atmospheric.
        =3D


It seems to me that this may prevent oxygen (or any other gas) from
entering the container. I have a vague recollection of partial pressures =

in
a vessel, which suggests that the oxygen partial pressure could be very l=

The partial pressure issue is real. The differential pressure for a
specific gas would be the difference in partial pressure across the
boundary. This doesn't mean that Air will push a water lock in thw wrong
direction, but it is possible for air to enter a fermenter across the
fermenter boundary.


However, this is just a guess here, I expect the permeability of 1/8 inch=

of PVC with differential oxygen partial pressure of about 3 psid would be=

almost nil. For a PET Soda bottle, based on the thin walled nature, you
could expect more diffusion, but I expect it again is almost nil. Maybe,
long term storage could allow some oxygen to enter, and I don't know how
little is needed for oxidation which is noticable.


If someone wants to run an experiment, fill a PET bottle with air and pla=

Hey there fellow homebrewers! 


I have a problem that I can not solve, I need your expertise. Actually I =
have two problems. My last three batches were good beers, but there was =
something off about each batch.  


The main problem was the beer was flat each time. My question is why? I =
followed the directions very closely. Could the yeast be dying in my =
primary? 


The other problem has to do with the taste...  The finished product =
seems to have a "funny" taste to it. I'm thinking that it could have =
something to do with either my bittering hops or the water. In two of =
the batches, I had to substitute the bittering hops. I was unable to =
find the hops in my local homebrew shop. Now if I switched the hops, =
would there be a funny taste to the end product( the substituted hops =
were close in Alpha Acids).


If anybody out has any to say on this topic, I would greatly appreciate =
it.

Subject: Propane and propane accesories


Randy in Modesto is (rightfully so) concerned about the new propane regulations
that take effect this year. He is right, a new valve costs more than a new
tank, but the new tanks (in consumer sizes) should all have the new style
valve. New valves are downward compatible with old regulators (left hand female
threaded regulators - wrench tightened ) but new regulators (male threaded that
are hand tightened) will not work on old tanks. One of the big reasons for the
change is the fact that the new valves won't let propane out unless a regulator
(or hose, etc) has been connected. There's a valve inside (like a bike tube)
that must be depresed first.
        A co-worker sucesfully exchanged his (empty) old type for a (full) new
type at the local grocery store. The exchange price is $14, a few dollars more
than a refill, but you're guaranteed an in-spec tank each time and they're open
24/7 so that panic run at 9:30 on a Sunday night is possible.

Subject: Bass O2 patent


What a productive lunchtime!
I nipped down to the patent office and printed UK patent 2 197 341
(1988), which details the Bass technique for yeast oxygenation. It only
cost a couple of dollars and is quite detailed. I urge anybody
interested in this topic to do the same. Alternatively ring your local
patent office and they will send it to you for a small fee.


The idea is pretty much as I suggested earlier. Traditional wort
oxygenation techniques do not take into account a particular sample's
oxygen requirement, so there is generally either too little or too much
oxygen supplied. (Fortunately for us it is not overly critical!) The
authors claim their technique supplies the correct amount of oxygen to
yeast
allowing predictable fermentations, controlled just by the pitching rate
and temperature. Test comparisons show their technique to give faster,
more predictable fermentations than with traditional wort aeration.


Unfortunately the exact method is difficult for homebrewers to reproduce
exactly..


"an aqueous suspension of brewers' yeast is oxygenated at a rate which
is progressively increased in such a manner that the concentration of
oxygen in the suspension remains substantially constant. Oxygenation is
preferably continued only until no further increase in the rate of
oxygenation is required to maintain the concentration substantially
constant".


ie. ideally some type of computer controlled oxygen monitor/dispenser is
required - generally out of our league. However, I think we can still
try and simulate it...


One of the experiments uses yeast quantities just about right for
homebrew pitching! Read on..


"In one experiment a 200g (wet weight) sample of an ale yeast derived
from a previous brewery fermentation was suspended in 2l of distilled
water in a stirred glass vessel. Air was the delivered into the
suspension by means of a sterile filter and glass sinter at a rate of 1
l/min for a period of 6 h. During this time the temperature was
maintained at 20C. At intervals the air supply was discontinued and the
rate at which dissolved oxygen was consumed by the yeast (DOT) measured
by means of a polarographic dissolved oxygen meter connected to a chart
recorder."


The results are illustrated in the following table:
(I read this by eye off a graph)
glycogen in % dry weight
DOT in %satn./min
sterol in ug/ml


time    DOT     sterol  glycogen
0       12      50      22
1       16      110     12
2       21      140     8
3       18      155     5
4       11      155     5
5       9       155     5
6       8       155     5


ie. maximum sterol levels occur between 2 and 3 hours after aeration
starts. This corresponds approximately with minimum glycogen and maximum
rate at which the suspension absorbs dissolved O2.


It appears that it is difficult to oversupply the suspension with O2, as
the yeast stops using it as it runs out of glycogen, it's ATP (energy)
source. This is why water should be used. Both wort and beer provide
food sources for yeast (yeast will respire ethanol etc. in beer under
such oxygenation). So for us, as long as we run with about 1l air per
min with the given starter volume say 3-4 hours we should be OK (err on
the side of too high since it shouldn't matter that much).


Elsewhere in the patent they pitch such oxygenated yeast at the rate of
3.75g/l wet weight into an ale of OG 1.060. Thus the starter in this
example is sufficient for a 50l batch of beer. Scaling down to 20l, use
about 100g of yeast in 1 litre of water with 500 ml/min of air for 3-4
hours. The air flow rate required is questionable. I calibrated my O2
cylinder/diffusion stone last night by placing an inverted water filled
measuring jug over the bubble stream inside a larger, water filled pot.
1l/min is a very high aeration rate! I think that as long as
*sufficient* air is supplied to maintain a constant partial pressure
(0.2 ATM for air), that the air flow rate is irrelevant. I originally
thought that 1l/min of air was equivalent to 200ml/min O2, but now think
this is flawed logic. Pure O2 is also covered by the patent, but there
are no examples given on how long such oxygenation would take.


Ideally a DO meter is required. I looked around and it seems Hanna make
one of the cheapest at ~A$1000. Other brands around the same price
(probably ~US$500) were TPS and Corning, although Hach seemed to have
the best reputation (and 60% pricier!). Can anybody recommend one?
Another option is to use DO chemical test kits (much cheaper!). These
are colour based, changing from yellow to clear. If we were measuring
wort DO these would be unacceptable (yellow -> amber ??), but for yeast
suspended in water they might be OK. Comments please?


The inventors also say you can store the yeast with no problems
(preferably cool) without further addition of oxygen, although they do
not say for how long. This means you do not need to prepare the yeast on
brew day. In
the other paper I referenced in my previous post, they discover that
treatment similar to this increases trehalose levels. Trehalose is
regarded as a general stress protectant, and oxygenated yeast actually
keeps *better* than non-oxygenated yeast! I would hazard you could keep
it (refrigerated) for *at least* a week, then pitch on brew day straight
into unoxygenated wort and achieve quick lag times, although obviously
the shorter the storage time the better.


So go get the patent or other references by all means, but I think I
have reproduced enough here for anyone to use the technique if they
wished to. I have never tried it, but the authors (highly respected
brewing scientists) recommend it, and Bass cared enough about it to
patent it, so that's good enough for me to at least give it a shot.

Subject: Brass Beer Engine




     Brew Your Own magazine had an article about a "$50 Beer 
     Engine" last year. I went to the local boat store today to 
     buy the pump they specified (Fynspray plastic galley pump), 
     and found that Fynspray also sells an all-brass version of 
     the same pump. If you saw the plastic and brass pumps 
     side-by-side you'd know why I HAD to buy the brass pump! 
     (Cost=$54). 
     
     Since the pump tube (and virtually everything else on the 
     pump) is brass, will this be detrimental to beer? Should I 
     treat the brass with a mixture of vinegar and hydrogen 
     peroxide to minimize the possibility of lead contamination? 
     Or does this process cause pitting of the brass surface that 
     would cause the pump to malfunction? I can return it and buy 
     the plastic pump if necessary.
     
     Also, does anyone have a source for sparkler heads for beer 
     engines? I could probably adapt one to the spout on the pump.

Perhaps someone in the collective can answer one of these questions for 
me:
1)I am going to rack over a lager to secondary today.  I used wyeast 
Danish II (2247?) and would like to know how long, and at what temp 
should this be stored in the secondary?  The colder the better or is the 
low 40's better?  Is 4 weeks long enough? What is a diacetyl rest and 
when/how do you do one? Should the rest be done with this yeast?


2) I just bought a king cooker outdoor propane burner and a 5 gallom 
propane tank.  If I am doing 3.5-4 gallon boils for 60-70 minutes, how 
long can I expect the gas in the tank to last before I need to refill 
it, I would hate to be half way through a boil and have the burner 
sputter out on me.

Recently I asked about a Porter I made with Bavarian lager yeast and
wondered what I should call it. Most responses said Porter, with the rest
calling it a Swartzbier.


Well, I've done it again. This time I made a beer with a Maerzen grain bill
and an IPA hop bill. I fermented it with an ale yeast and Bavarian lager
yeast. Well, the ale yeast turned out a great tasting IPA. The lager yeast
is still fermenting (`at` 42F) and is too yeasty to get a good profile of the
final flavor.


So, what would you call this beer? IPL? Specialty? Tasty?


BTW, the Porter done with the lager yeast took second place in a recent
contest as a Brown Porter. I didn't enter it as a Swartzbier, so no clue
how it would have fared.

Subject: Further clarification Jim Liddlil's post on sanitizing plastic


Hello, my name is Jim O'Shea, from Five Star Products and Services. I would
like to thank you for this opportunity to post a reply to the past two
postings by Jim Liddil. 


We take seriously every comment a customer or potential customer has to say
about our products. Customer input is very important to us in servicing this
new market. In Mr. Liddil's case we were even more concerned as he is a
professional making a public statement on the Internet, which is highly read
by homebrewers. Our biggest concern is that he stated, "I am not trying to
promote there (sic) stuff and some of my results might make you think about
using them anyway."(emphasis added)


Mr. Liddil was a beta tester for us. We sent him some of the products we were
looking at to sell to homebrewers. We had asked him to respond to us
privately, in the spring of 1997, so we could offer the best products to
homebrewers. Those who have seen our ads or contacted us know we released Star
San, not Saniclean. The information we gathered from our beta testers, showed
us that Saniclean was not the best sanitizer for this market. 


Some points I had hoped Mr. Liddil would have made in his postings is that any
product that has only been sanitized will grow bacteria as sanitizing only
kills 99.999% of bacteria. Brewers sanitize; they do not sterilize.
Sterilizing is a 100% kill of all bacteria. I had also hoped he would have
pointed out that long rod bacteria usually takes about two days to grow and is
not a beer spoiler. This additional information shows that Mr. Liddel's test
is a strong indicator that plastic, even old scratched plastic, can be
sanitized and used with confidence when brewing beer.


This is the information I would have liked to have provided to Mr. Liddil
before he went public, on the Internet, with his information. By
collaborating, Mr. Liddil could have presented all of his research on
sanitizing plastic in a manner that would have been more beneficial to
homebrewers.


We welcome any independent test results others may have obtained. We ask to
review the data before publication so we may contribute additional information
that could be important in educating homebrewers in their art.

Subject: "Killian's" Recipe, Secondary question


Mike Cukrow asks about a "Killian's" Recipe


Making a duplicate of Killian's Red would be hard to do without an all-grain
batch. You would have to mash adjuncts such as corn and rice. I have been
making a Griffin Irish Red for St. Patrick's Day over the last couple of years
which I refer to as a "pumped up" Killian's. Here is my all-grain recipe (I'll
try to convert it for you as well). Recipe for 5 gallons.


4 oz flaked barley
2 oz roasted barley
2 oz chocolate
6 oz crystal 40
9 lbs 2 row
2 oz Fuggles - 60 min
1 tsp Irish moss - 20 min
1 oz Cascade - at k.o.
Lager yeast (I've had good success w/ Wyeast #2007 Pilsen lager, this year I
used #2112 California lager) It is important to use a lager yeast and ferment
at the proper temps to get the clean flavor profile.
Expected O.G. - 1.052
Expected F.G - 1.012


Do a single step infusion (or whatever you want) for a rest at 154 F for 60
minutes. Raise to 165 F for 10 minutes. Then sparge as normal. Boil for 75
minutes, adding hops and moss as described. Cool and pitch yeast at 70 F. Cool
to ferment temps for yeast within 12 hours.


For an extract recipe leave out the flaked barley, subsitute 5 lbs light DME
for the 9 lbs of 2-row and steep the other grains. If you brew now you might
still make it by St Patrick's Day!


Secondary Fermentation Question


I've noticed that a lot of you like to transfer to the secondary while there
is still some active fermentation in the primary. I understand your reasons
for doing this but I have noticed a problem for me. I usually get no further
drop in gravity after I transfer. For instance, if I expect the gravity to
drop to 1.010 (from previous batches of the same recipe) and rack at 1.015
(with bubbles still coming out of the airlock) it will stay there, or
sometimes drop to 1.014, but will not get to where it should be. What is the
reason for this? I would expect that the active yeast cells are still in
solution, not down in the yeast/trub cake that does not get transfered. And,
if anything, I would expect the transfer to "rouse" some of the inactive cells
and get them fermenting again. But this does not happen. I have noticed this
with both ale and lager yeasts. What gives?

Has anyone done the experiment?  


We've had months of back and forth speculation...


"Well, it seems to me that ..."
"I don't know, why not ...."
"This authority sez ..."
"But I can't see why ..."


SHEESH!  SHUT UP OR PUT UP!


Make a batch of beer.  Split it into two (or more) fermenters.  Aerate
one during fermentation and don't aerate the other.


Take notes.


Taste blind after bottling.


Are there differences?


Wait a month.  Taste.  Repeat until bored or out of beer.


Does one "last" longer than the other?  How do the flavors change as
they age?


After you've done that, THEN report back.  Otherwise it's like
Monday-morning quarterbacking.  Fun for the participants and totally
boring for everyone else.  Not to mention repetitive and redundant and
repetitive.

So if I take my strip and dip it in the hot wort, wait a couple 
seconds, and then compare the color with the container, will
I be reading the correct wort pH?  I mean, will the number
I read by the pH of the hot wort (since I dipped the strip

The color comparison is harder than it looks.

I don't see any problem with dry hopping the beer now, but I'm
not sure it will help you much.  dry hopping doesn't impart
much in the way of flavor, and gives almost no bitterness.


Sounds like your best bet is to blend the batch with another
batch that is very flavorful.  You could quickly brew an IPA
or something and blend the two.


I think blending offers a great opportunity to incrase the 
varieties of beers we have that many of us don't take
advantage of.  I've got four kegs in the fridge and 
have been mixing the beers in the glass.  I'm thinking of
mixing two beers in my three gallon keg to have an
additional beer in the fridge.

I agree that "1" doesn't need a protein rest and that "2" and "3" would
benefit from one (I've never used Durst, but the DeWolf-Cosyns Pils
needs one, in my opinion).  As for doing a protein rest on "4" just because
you associate Pilsners woth protein rests, I don't agree.  That's
not a good reason.  While it shouldn't hurt to do a rest at 135F, it would
be pretty much a waste of time better spend elsewhere.  Modification
determines whether you need a protein rest, not the style.


Going back to "3" for a second, why would you do the rest at 122F and
not 131F (or 135F or 140F)?  Because it is *even less modified*?  Again,
I think you are somehow associating modification and rest temperature.
All modern malts will have more than enough amino acids in all-malt
worts.  A rest at 122F simply increases wort amino acid levels at the
expense of body and head retention.  With our modern malts, I contend
that NO recipe needs a 122F rest!  If you are using an undermodified
malt and need a protein rest, then do it at around 135F and break those
big (haze- and break-forming) proteins into medium-sized (body- and
head-forming) proteins.


I've posted about this before and I'll say it again.  Here's how I
determine whether I need to use a protein rest for a particular malt:


1. brew a batch using this malt and *don't* use a protein rest,


2. if more than 1/5 of the carboy is filled with break material
the next morning, then next time I use this malt, add 15 minutes at
135F, and


3. if there's only a small amount of break material in the carboy
the next morning, then *don't* add a protein rest next time.


Simple, no?
