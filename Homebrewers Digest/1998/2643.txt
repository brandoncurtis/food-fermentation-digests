Subject: Isoelectric Points


George dePiro asked about pH effects in the boil. It is well known that
kettle pH does have an effect on protein coagulation. I'm working from
admitidly shaky memory but as I recall from M&BS coagulation improves as
pH decreases to around 5.0 and then gets worse as pH decreases further
thus 5.0 (or maybe 5.1?) is optimum from the protein coagulation point
of view. The job of trying to determine pI's for various proteins could,
I assume, only be easily determined by experiment since the pI depends
on the actual amino acids in the prtotein, or at least in the amounts of
aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, lysine and arginine as the
first two of these tend to be negatively charged at kettle pH's and the
latter  to be positively charged. An amino acid looks like:


R(CH)(NH3+)(COO-)


at wort pH with the R determining which amino acid it is. There are two
centers of acidity: The NH3+ group can give up a proton to become NH2
and the COO- group can take on a proton to become COOH. Given a number
of amino acid molecules half of them are in the COO- state and half in
the COOH state at  pH's  about 2.2 depending on which acid it is.
Similarly, at pH's around 9.6 half the molecules are in the NH3+ state
and half NH2. In a protein these groups form the peptide bond and do not
contribuite to the charge (except for the terminal ones). A protein
looks like:


(NH3+)(CH)R1(CONH)(CH)R2(CONH)(CH)R3.....(CONH)(CH)Ri(COO-)


 ^N
terminal
^C Terminal


R1, R2, R3...Ri are the sidegroups which depend on which amino acids are
linked to form the protein. In the five acids mentioned earlier the R
groups can release protons and contribute to the charge of the protein
at wort pH. Half of a particular group which can release a proton does
so when the pH is equal to the pK for the group. For aspartic and
glutamic acids the R groups contain COO-/COOH and the pK's are,
respectively 3.86 and 4.25.  For lysine, arginine and histidine the
proton supplying groups are, respectively, NH3+/NH2, NH2+/NH and NH+/N
groups which supply protons. The pK's are, respectively, 10.53,12.48 and
6.0.


If the wort pH is less than the pK for a particular R, fewer than half
of the R's of that type release protons. If the wort pH is greater, more
than half do. At pH around 5 pH is greater than pK for Asp and Glu so
the majority of R's are ionized and there is a preponderance of negative
charge on these R groups. For Lys, Arg and His pH is less than pK, most
of the groups have not released their protons and thus these groups are
predominantly positively charged. If we define r = 10^(pH - pK) the
fraction of groups of a particular type ionized is f = r/(1+r). Thus for
Asp and Glu we could say that the charge from a single group is -r/(1+r)
because the ionized COO- is negatively charged. There can't, of course,
really be a fractional charge. The actual charge is n*f where n is a
very large number of R groups but the device of using fractions makes it
easier to see what's going on.


For Lys, Arg and His the fraction of groups which release a proton is
also r/(1+r) but now the charge is  +(1 - r/(1+r)) because when a group
releases a proton it looses its charge and the charge is  thus plus the
fraction of groups which  _don't_  give up a proton.


The net fractional charge on a protein is thus:


(Fractional charge on C terminal) + (fractional charge on N terminal) +
(number of R1 side groups)(fractional charge on R1 group) + (number of
R2 side groups)(fractional charge on R2 group) + ...


The isoelectric point (pI) of a protein is the pH at which the net
charge is 0. The pI depends, in a large protein, mostly on the R groups
and not on the terminal groups. The pI is the pH which zeroes the net
charge. A couple of examples:


Ala-Asp-Glu-Lys-Arg-His-Leu would have a pI of about 7.75.


Ala-Asp-Glu-Ser-His-Glu-His-Leu  would have a pI of about 4.4.


A change of 0.1 pH in the latter case changes the cahrge by about 0.15
unit.


A low pI implies a preponderance of Asp and Glu relative to Lys, Arg and
His. The converse is also true. Thus we conclude that wort proteins,
which apparently have pI's near 5 have lots of Asp and Glu.


If anyone wants to play around with this here are some pK's for a few
amino acids. These are from Lehninger's "Biochemistry" (I do have that
handy - no way this stuff is from memory!)

Subject: 5L Party Kegs


Seeing as how there has been interest in the party keg system and 
wanting to know more about it myself, here are some questions of my own. 
First, almost all who've used them or sell them say that they cannot be 
force carbonated using the "carbonator" and a cylinder. I suspect so 
too. However, I've noticed that St.Patrick's of Texas advertises the 
party keg with suggestions that they may either be carbonated using 
priming sugar(less of course) or a co2 cylinder. Do they know something 
we don't? Secondly, I was wondering if the taps can be removed mid-keg, 
without finishing so that you can tap a different keg and return later.


Another question I have is about pH. The figures that are recommended 
for mashing and later for sparging and runoff, what temperature is this 
at? Wouldn't it be a little difficult to get an accurate value at the 
temperatures we are employing? It would seem the best way would be to 
use something that has automatic temperature compensation. Or are the 
chemicals that indicate the colour in our pH paper in a reversible 
reaction so that they will display the right pH when the test sample is 
cooled?


Thanks,
Greg

In the list of ingredients for my Hormel Chili, the third from the last

I know this is not directly related to brewing but it was the first time I

Subject: Homebrew and Flatulence


Has anybody else noticed the correlation between drinking homebrew and
flatulence, or is this something that only affects me.  I notice that after
drinking two or three homebrews some very noxious gasses start vacating my
body causing my wife to threaten to not allow me to drink my own homebrew.
Do other people have this problem?>>


Wayne,
  I'd be willing to bet the vast majority of us experience an above average
level of noxious gas production, to one extent or another.  I've had some
homebrews that were benign, and others that produced some pretty malevolent
vapors.
  Commercial beers will do it also.   Way back, before I even knew about
homebrewing, I developed a taste for Rolling Rock.  I bought one case, and
that was it.  My wife wouldn't let me buy it again.  That was years ago and
almost forgotten.  Just a couple days ago, my neighbor's wife was
complaining that her husband had bought some Rolling Rock.  "He's just
terrible in the morning after drinking that stuff!"  Maybe it's the DMS?
  What you eat also makes a difference (duh!!)  Pizza and beer affects many.
However, separate the two and there may not be anything.
  No doubt we have one or two doctors out there who can explain how this all
happens.

Running a load on half the voltage QUARTERS the power since power relates to

Carl Shipman talks about recipe colr.  I was recently researching the
divergence of SRM vs "homebrew color units" (grain color x weight / gallon)
and present the following table.


Mosher ("Brewer's Comapnaion") and Daniels ("Designing Great Beers") have
presented rough guides to determine the HCU color required to approximate a
given SRM value.  Their data do not match exactly, but I would lean towards
Daniels' figures since he is much more specific about the contribution of
process variation.  Daniels supplies a graph of the data used to develop the
table, and that graph shows a widely-scatterred pattern which makes and exact
comparison impossible.  However, a rough conversion table is given here to
figure approximately what your HCU should be to hit a target SRM figure.  I've
also included some commercial beers and their SRM colors for reference.  The
Mosher data is given in "HCU" units while Daniels uses the term "MCU" (malt
color units).  Both units are calculated using malt weights, color, and batch
volume as described above.

Convective flow is concentration/thermal gradient driven.I

I think of it as a plug flow model driven by gravity with a

You can't get away with nothin' around here.  The ex-history teacher here
(as well as English, biology, etc.) will call you on details.  The metric
system was a revolutionary adoption, not Napoleonic one.  In 1790, the
National Assembly of France requested the National Academy of Sciences to
develop a standard system of weights and measures.  In 1795, France adopted
the metric system, but allowed other units to be used (they were outlawed
in 1840).  Napoleon seized power of France in 1799 (he had been military
leader up until then).


In 1790, Thomas Jefferson recommended to Congress that the US adopt a
decimal system of measurement; Congress rejected it.  In 1821 John Quincy
Adams, then Secretary of State, proposed US conversion to metric.  Congress
again rejected the proposal.  In 1866, the metric system was made legal in
the US, but was not required.  There were several failed attempts in
Congress during the 1890's to change the US to metrics.  We're stubborn,
ain't we?  In 1971, a *three year* congressional study recommended that the
US make a planned conversion.  In 1975, Congress boldly passed the Metric
Conversion Act, which calls for a voluntary changeover, resulting in the
blinding changes we've all witnessed.

Subject: Estimating Beer Color


Brew Dudes:


Using the color palette from a spreadsheet is a clever way to estimate
beer color and catalog the final beer color for each brew.  Good work
Carl Shipman.


Another method to estimate beer color is the use of an equation I found
in the Brewery that determines final beer color based on the number of
malt color units (MCU):


Final Beer Color (degrees L) = 1.49 * (MCU)^0.69


The little carrot top thingy (^) is an exponent, just so the
mathematically challenged folks like myself understand.  Any $5
scientific calculator can handle this beast of an equation, very simple
to use.  I have found it to be fairly accurate when using the Davison
Color guide as a baseline.  Usually can hit the design color within +/-
2 degrees Lovibond.  Here's an example using the upcoming Palexperiment:


5 Gallons
US Pale Ale Malt 3 L:   (8.2 lbs X 3 L) / 5   = 4.9 MCU
Crystal 40 L:           (1.0 lb  X 40 L) / 5  = 8.0 MCU
DWC Munich 8 L:         (0.8 lbs X 8 L) / 5   = 1.3 MCU
- ------------                                   --------
total Malt Color Units                         14.2 MCU


Beer Color (deg L) = 1.49 x (14.2)^0.69 = 9.3 L


(Palexperimenters:  This is why I wanted to keep the chocolate malt in
the experiment, if 1/2% chocolate is used the final beer color is about
14, not to mention the yummy flavor addition).  Now, before I get
lectured by the HBD xpurtz I need to point out that there are many
variables that contribute to the final beer color, particularly in the
range from 1 L to 10 L.  However, using the above equation has provided
me with very good estimates.  Another fine point to the above equation
is that it seems to be more accurate when the MCUs are greater than 5,
i.e. the final beer color will equal the MCUs for any beer with a total
MCU of 5 or less.


Noonan lists some MCU and beer color data in his revised book, New
Brewing Lager Beer.  I did an exponential curve fit for this data and
found it to be much different than the Brewery's equation.  Decide for
yourself, perhaps his numbers will work better with your system.


Of course, the standard disclaimer applies, YMMV.


Sure am enjoying George DPs short courses on brewing topics.  Keep
reading that German brewing text George, and keep the posts coming!

days became one day.  Eventually, it became a few minutes.


At the same time, I started noticing that my beers were starting to come

around the bung (no visible damage to the keg---it just leaked)."


Jim, it sounds like you have a broken dip tube.  Sometimes it is not very
obvious when looking at the tube, but if you flex it you will probably see a
hairline crack near the collar that is located just below the threads.  I have
been able to get replacement tubes for around 5 bucks at the local brew shops.


I'm not trying to talk you out of going to cornie kegs.  I will probably move
to that system soon, too.  Many of your complaints about the mini-keg system
are valid, but I think that if you replace the diptube you will have better
luck.


Hope this helps,

Carl has a good idea, but unfortunately there are many more variables than

different ways. Each monitor type, from each year, or even month available
on the market has different drivers, dot pitch, etc... that affect how it

I suspect a lot of your heat is conducting through the aluminum sides
of your pot and radiating off.  You might hang foil around the sides
of the pot to reflect it back, or otherwise insulate it.  Check the
archives, I think this has been discussed pretty thoroughly before.
BE CAREFUL -- foil can burn, and I think those hot-plate burners could
ignite it.


Also, it's probably boiling out the top.  Cover partially to reduce
heat loss, don't cover completely so DMS can escape.

Are the drip pans in contact with the boxes all around their perimeters?
You'd reduce conduction by mounting them on three or four bolts with
metal spacers, to reduce the contact.

I have read (here, I think) that electric burner elements are designed
to cool themselves by convection.  If you keep them in a dead air space,
you'll reduce their useful life.

No, the Reinheitsgebot predated the metric system.  You would have to

The shop is in error.  You should be getting about as much carbonation as
if you had bottled with 1/3 cup corn sugar.


I don't suggest you increase the sugar.  From what I've seen on the net,
if you try to carbonate these mini-kegs to more typical pressures, they
start leaking.


These kegs seem to be good for lower-carbonation styles.  if you like such
styles ("real ale", for instance) they work OK.  They appear to work OK
for commercial distribution of higher-pressure styles, but in this usage
they are filled using commercial equipment and used only once.

Many people use these buckets for years with no problem.  If you clean

may have problems, no matter what equipment you use.


Food aromas don't seem to transfer readily.  If you bleach it and/or
hit it with strong ultraviolet (sunlight) for a couple of days, you won't
get pickle beer.  You might start with a weak/light test batch just to
see if any taste transfers.

It's caused by the complex sugars and carbohydrates being fermented in

Pour your beer carefully and gently into a glass, to reduce yeast
uptake.  Also try beano (from the drugstore).  You'll probably adapt
in a few months.


It occurs to me:


Yeast and similar microflora seem to be pretty picky about pH and other
chemical balances.  Perhaps acidifying your gut contents -- eating more
pickles and acidic foods -- would help.  Perhaps also hot-pepper foods
would help.  I don't have this problem (thank you Jesus) so I can't
do the experiment.  If anyone has first-hand experience, perhaps they'll

Sorry to contribute to the revival of the "aluminum vs. stainless" debate,

These comments got me thinking: if Aluminum is so much cheaper, lighter,
easier to work, more conductive, etc., then why isn't it used more in
commercial brewing?  It seems to me like a potentially huge reduction in
overhead (and variable cost, if energy costs are reduced) to make an
aluminum brewery.  Are there technical reasons (e.g., scale factors that
make aluminum unusable; too scratchable for commercial use, etc.), or
simply anti-aluminum bias, or something else?

Subject: A little more protein


A little more  on a recent post on the effects of kettle pH on proteins.
I remembered the bit from M&BS reasonably, but not completely,
accurately. From p 458 (Vol II) "Above pH 5 the amount of protein
coagulated is constant, but at lower pHs it is substantially
reduced..."  There are tables for both infusion and decoction mashes and
interested readers should look at them because the data don't quite
match the words depending on how you define "constant".


Although I implied it I didn't clearly state that large molecules like
proteins tend to be least soluble at their isoelectric points. It should
be clear that at pH's well below pI where the molecules have a large
positive charge and at  pH well above pI where they have a large
negative charge they will repell one another and stay in suspension.
Converesely at or near pI where the net charge is small or 0 there is no
net repulsion but the individual positive and negative charges
distributed over the molecule can attract if the molecules are arranged
properly.
The following contrived one-dimensional sketch should convey the idea


        +n+n+nnn+nn-nn-nn-nn-   Protein at isoelectric pH
        -nn-nn-nn-nn+nnn+n+n+   Same protein but physically reversed


In the sketch n represents an uncharged amino acid residue, + represents
a positively charged one and - a negatively charged one. The two
molecules are the same, have 0 net charge and are attracted to one
another because there is a relative physical position which puts the
negative charges of one in physical proximity to the positive charges of
the other and conversely.


To see all this at work try adding a few drops of vinegar to milk. The
pI of milk protein is around 5.2 and as enough vinegar is added to
approach that pH the milk will curdle.

OK, I have now (on rec.crafts.brewing) seen my first-ever first-hand
account from someone who got pickle taste after using bleach and

dill pickles are worse.

Subject: Why aluminum isn't used commercially


Greetings,


Aluminum is seldom used in commercial brewing because:


 - It reacts poorly to clean-in-place (CIP) chemicals.


 - It needs a layer of oxidization to neutralize it, otherwise it puts
  a taste into the beer.  This is easy to maintain at home-brewing
  scale, more of a pain on a commercial scale.


 - It's softer, so more prone to damage.


 - It conducts heat better, so it loses heat to the environment faster,
  so you need to add more heat to maintain a boil (energy costs money).

Actually, 240V is no more dangerous than 120V since the voltage to ground is
120V either way.  The 240V is only between the two 240V leads.  If you get
that going through you I am not sure the GFCI would do any good anyway.
It only protects you from grounding the circuit.  Although you would probably
be grounded so that would trip it.  The 120V should be enough to kill you
anyway if you are well grounded.  The point is, 120V is just as dangerous
as 240V around water.

I had the same problem. From what I've seen so far, no formula 
or software takes the thermal capacity of the mashtun into account.
I mean we also rise the temp of the mashtun, so we shouldn't only 
calculate with masses and thermal capacities of grain and mashwater, 
but also include this *system dependent constant*! A rule of thumb 
for estimating this value is the mass of the mashtun -without 
insulation and cold parts (eg. outer casing).


Furthermore, we have to take into account the heat loss of the 
mashtun.


That all seems logical so far but why do you hit mashing in temp but 
not further infusions? In my experience/setup I got the same problems 
(temps too low after a few minutes) already at mashing in, when I 
choosed slurry consistencies like 2.2 l/kg. With thicker, pasty 
mashes of 1.6 l/kg like in Lars's example, heat transfer simply takes 
much longer and therefore everything seems to be ok - IMHO.


Anyway, this all adds some complexity to the maths but I've tried to 
make a simplified approach with my Excel brewplanner:


brew_rec.xls in
http://www.netbeer.co.at/beer/bin/brewtabs.zip


The "factors" register allows a system calibration like this:


record temp of empty mashtun/environment
add full mash volume of hot water, eg. 70C/158F
record temp after 5 minutes
record temp after 65 minutes


The initial drop in temperature is caused mainly by thermal capacity 
of the mashtun whereas the 60 minutes drop allows to calculate the 
heat loss of the mashtun.


Permission is granted to use the spreadsheet or parts of it as long 
as the (c) is kept intact and no part of it is included in commercial 
applications.


We've tested it on various systems and hit target temperatures well 
within 1C (+-0.5C). The register with the international metric units 
has been debugged so far, the register with the standard units has to 
be tested yet - any volunteers?

George asks about just how short lagering time can be in professional

gentleman loves good beer, Duvel was his regular beer.  He proudly

beer was around 40 days.  Now he has it down to 10-13 days!  The

actually of higher quality now then before.  Im not certain if this

Hi,


No, your beer is just fine.  If you use a magnifying glass to get a
good look at the white dots, you will find that they are just small
bubbles.  They seem to have some kind of attraction for each other
and end up in small clumps.  It's just the dissolved CO2 coming out
of suspension in the wort.  When you were in full blown ferment, the
bubbles were probably huge in comparison.  The wort is partially 
saturated with the CO2 from fermentation, and it is coming out very
slowly, thus the tiny bubbles.  At least that is my take on it.


Since you've had it in secondary for so long, you might want to add
a sachet of dry yeast at bottling, in case most of your yeast has
settled out.  Even if you don't need it, it wouldn't hurt.  Why 
take chances on having a flat batch?

Subject: metric and party pigs


I just thought I would chip in my support for Party Pigs also.  They are
a great alternative to bottling and kegging.  I have three that are in
constant use and do not seem to be showing any signs of wear or
retaining any flavours or aromas in the plastic.


Secondly, I think the last English Unit of measure that home brewers and
beer drinkers the world over will be the most reluctant to relinquish is
the pint.  Inviting a friend over for a few 400 milliliters of ale does
not have quite the same ring to it.
Cheers

Subject: FW: Beer Primary 


William Warren asked about Pickle buckets for the Beer Primary.


I was given a bucket from a Mexican resteurant (sp?) that contained 
taco sauce. Not only was it badly stained but the odor persisted 
no matter how hard I cleaned! I use it to store my 
supplies that could attract critters, instead.


If you want a free bucket which avoids odor/stain problems, go visit 
a bakery. The buckets that iciing comes in will clean up well and, 
unless you get a dark chocolate one, will be free of stains.  I picked 
up two: one for fermenting, the other for bottling. For the latter I drilled 
a small hole and used my Dremel with a sanding drum to round out 
the hole to the correct size for a spigot.


Man, I can only imagine what kind of flavor your first batch will have! 
Want some ice cream with that?
