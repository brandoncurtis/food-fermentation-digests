Subject: HB Shops


A few days ago, Michael Dingas wrote about mail order trouble. It can really
suck when mail order is your only option and you realize on brew day you
forgot a key ingredient!


Michael - I'm surprised Warner Robbins doesn't have a dozen HB shops. (Just
kidding!) There are not many places deeper in the Great American Beer
Wasteland (Bible Belt + small town + intense brand loyalty to Bud) Next time
you are up in Atlanta, stop by Amber Waves (LaVista Rd) or BYOB (downtown) and
grab a 50 Lb. bag of pale base malt and then mail order just the specialty
malts etc. Buy bulk hops and invest some of your freezer space. If you are an
extract guy, buy bulk extract shipped in plastic bags or buckets vs. cans.
Start a yeast ranch. Macon doesn't have a shop?


As a former mailorder guy, I never had any problems with retailers. Your post
struck a chord and I felt the need to un-lurk , steal a little bandwidth, and
do the soapbox thing vs. private e-mail. I want to publicly thank all the
various shops (no affiliation) that gave me GREAT service over the years.
Happily sending a replacement hydrometer when it broke in shipment etc. 


I mail ordered from as far away as Spokane (Jim's Homebrew) to Minneapolis
(James Page) to Atlanta (BYOB). I was often willing to pay extra postage to do
business with some of these Great Americans because of the service and
assistance they provided. Service IS everything. Unfortunately, I can see how
the HB market has gotten alot more competative in the last few years and many
HB shops have closed down. :-( 


Whenever I travel, I try to find the time to stop in at a local shop to browse
and BS with the shop owner or clerk. Hey! Who has ever walked into a shop not
needing something! - Picture the airport security guy pulling a baggie full of
whole hops out of the suitcase :-)


My hat is off to all the folks out there (too many to list) providing the
ingredients, knowledge, and enthusiasm that make this hobby so rewarding.
Thanks guys (and gals)!


Prost!

There can be considerable variation in the intensity and actual
color of the RGB guns between monitors of the same brand and model
(when new, let alone after being used for awhile).  Unless you
have the wherewithall (i.e. cash) to afford one of those
superduperdeluxeohwowgolly high end graphic art monitors getting
an accurate color rendition on the average consumer monitor is a
bit of a crap shoot.  One possible way around this is to obtain a
set of pantone color strips and try to balance your monitor's
colors accordingly.  Most of the graphic arts-types I know
consider these to be fairly standardized.


On the other hand, Hoptech offers a "Homebrew Color Guide" for
about $10 that provides a fair measure of color in degrees
Lovibond.  FWIW, the tech sheet that came with mine says that
accuracy is from 3 to 19 degrees L.


Anyway, a thought ...

Well, if it is not there to give a meaty flavor, it is likely a
Vitamin B supplement. Brits and Ozzies have been
eating this stuff on toast since before the Great War.  It is called
"Marmite" and like ski jumping must be learned to be enjoyed
at an early age. On the other hand we all know that his stuff is
also a yeast and bacterial nutrient and it may also add additional
POWer to the Chili by encouraging fermentation in the intestine. {8^)
- ----------------------------------
In that same vein, I would think beers with a lot of dextrins in
them would be prone to cause flatulence, simply  because these
complex carbohydrates are broken down more slowly.
Just a WAG, any comments?

     Fellow Brewers,
     
     I am fairly new to the list and a first time poster. I enjoy the list 
     and am learning lots.  I have brewed a few batches of extract pale 
     ales and wheat beers which turned out well but was recently 
     transferred to Yokosuka, Japan.  I am presently underway on the USS 
     Independence in the Persian Gulf and want to brew some more when I 
     return to Japan. My question is can someone supply me with a list of 
     email addresses for mail order sources on the west coast of the U.S. 
     and/or any source of supplies in the Tokyo/Yokohama area of Japan.
     
     Thanks,
     
     Paul

A couple of observations that may be helpful to can fans:
        The rim around the top is tall enough that you can pour in water to
submerge the bung. If it is leaking CO2 pressure, you may see bubbles. Mine
haven't leaked yet.
        The rubber bung holds pressure the same way as a tubeless tire valve.
William's Brewing sells a food-grade viscous (like Vaseline) sticky
lubricant and recommends putting it on sealing surfaces. In order to
escape, internal pressure has to move a very thin layer of sticky stuff
between two surfaces, the dimensions favoring the sticky stuff (intuitive).
For cleanup, sticky can be removed with kitchen degreasers such as 409.
Hop to it.

Subject: Carbon Filters


Happened into a new Home Depot today and in wondering about found a very
reasonable water filter kit with carbon filters.  My intention was to use
that to filter water that comes from my outside water hoses (plastic flavor)
to my RV hose I use in the brewery (garage).  Price was right and I was
getting the fittings when the plumbing manager warned that the carbon
filters are prone to the growth of bacteria especially with well water (I
have) which isn't chlorinated to begin with.  Never having heard this I
postponed the purchase until someone on the digest with experience with
filtering water through carbon filters could shed some light on the use of
these filters with well water.  Anyone got any advice?

Greetings!  I just stopped at the local coffee roaster to talk about
roasting some barley.  He said a simple way to do it at home was to use a
hot air popcorn popper.  As he told me about it, I looked at his coffee
roaster.  Forced heat!  Same idea!  Anybody tried this?  Any idea how long
to roast?  Raw vs malted barley?  Raw vs malted wheat?  Any preferences?
Thanks.


WRT lager ferment times.  Many recipes and books refer to fermenting lagers
for a couple of weeks followed by a "diacetyl rest" for a day or so and
then cool to lagering temps over a few days.  I've only made two lagers.
Both of them, with 2 liter starters took at least 4 weeks to ferment.  One
was held at 50 degrees.  The other was initially cooled to 38 degrees (don'
t ask) and allowed to slowly warm to 59 degrees.  How long do most of you
have to let your lagers ferment?  TIA.

Subject: 5L Party Kegs aka Minikegs


Gregg Soh asks in HBD 2643:
>Seeing as how there has been interest in the party keg system and 
>wanting to know more about it myself, here are some questions of my >own. 
 First, almost all who've used them or sell them say that they >cannot be 
force carbonated using the "carbonator" and a cylinder. I >suspect so too. 
However, I've noticed that St.Patrick's of Texas >advertises the party keg 
with suggestions that they may either be >carbonated using priming 
sugar(less of course) or a co2 cylinder. Do >they know something we 
don't? 


5L minikegs were designed as a beer sales container, similar to a standard 
beer can from the 50s.  They are coated steel.  They were not designed to 
accommodate over pressure.   If one primes at the same rate as normal for 
homebrewing (3/4 cup corn sugar for 5 gallons), cans bulge, coating cracks 
and beer is ruined by contact with iron.  I suspect the same thing could 
happen if force carbonated unless pressures were kept very low, at low 
temperatures, for a relatively long time.  


The original carbonater cap can be screwed on to a Minikeg CO2 tapper in 
place of the CO2 cartridge holder, and a standard CO2 cylinder attached.  
Newer carbonater caps have a lip inside which preclude this, the lip can 
be removed by routing it away, and the cap used.  This is not the way the 
cap or tapper were intended to be used by either manufacturer, so it is 
done at your own risk.  I would only use it to dispense beer from the keg, 
saving the roughly $1 per minikeg cartridge cost.  Another alternative is 
to use the available hand pump, which allows air in to replace beer 
dispensed.  This means the minikeg must be emptied soon, in one sitting at 
best.


I have heard of people force carbonating in minikegs using standard 
cartridges, but never first hand.  It would be costly, and priming is 
simple and inexpensive.  If St. Pats is advocating using a standard CO2 
cylinder for force carbonating, I hope they have a good lawyer due to 
going so far outside manufacturer's intended use.   I suspect they are 
referring to use of the standard cartridges. 


>Secondly, I was wondering if the taps can be removed mid-keg, 
>without finishing so that you can tap a different keg and return later.


No, the tapper is installed by pushing the center section of the bung into 
the keg with the tapper.  It can be removed and reused along with the 
tapper and bung after the keg is emptied.  This is yet another way cornie 
kegs are more versatile than minikegs.  I like my minikegs, but look 
forward to retiring them, soon.

I agree with the sentiment about not using the bucket until you've got all
the pickle taste/odor out of it.  Perhaps the residual pickle flavor will
disappear if you use it to soak bottles in bleach water a couple of times?


I don't agree with plastic fermenter needing retirement after 5-10 batches.
If you treat them right they will last much much longer.  I'm still on my
first bucket (~30 batches). Personally if find it much easier to treat a
plastic bucket right, than to treat a glass carboy right.  I would say:
never use a scrub pad on a plastic fermenter (If you have some crud stuck to
the plastic, then use warm water and a sponge). I don't like to use any
brushes on the plastic either.

Subject: nylons / hop bags


In HBD#2641 David Hill sez:
>I posted a while ago that I was using nylon ankle stockings to hold hops
>for dry hopping because I could not find a catering sized tea ball.
>
>Stockings work but are messy to clean and I in fact usually decide that

I use hop bags made from a one "pair" of panty hose that my wife deem
unsuitable for further use.  I cut off each leg and then cut each into two,
making 4 bags. Tying knots secures any open ends.


When I first set out to use these, the thought of where they had been, and
where the fluid they were about to soak in was heading, made me decide to
boil the h*$$ out of them first. That was a real good decision because it
turns out that there was a lot of dye in these.  In fact I ended up boiling
and rinsing 3 times before the true color of the nylon (a greyish tan/white)
emerged.


So if you are using new ankle stockings without any pre-treatment, then I
would guess that the color of your beer is likely to be just a bit darker
than it would otherwise be. (yuck!) And throwing them away after first use
means you're tossing them at a point where they are actually just reaching
their prime.  


I have found it very easy to dump the content out and rinse the hop bags.
It's a lot easier than prepping a new bag (boiling, etc..). 


There are a few things to watch out for with these bags: see to it that your
stirring spoon doesn't have any burrs which catch the bag and cause holes. I
had a hole (1/4") appear during my last boil (but the bag stayed intact).
Don't cram all your hops into one bag; I use no more than about 1 oz of hops
per bag. Also, I understand that hop extraction efficiency goes down but I
can't attest to that because I don't have anything to compare with. I
generally squeeze the hop bag out in the wort several times while boiling.

Subject: The Olympics and Hazy Beer


The queue lately seems short enough to allow this. If you are pretty busy
today, you might should just skip to the next posting.
        I was reading Al Korzonas' good book "Homebrewing Vol. 1". The Olympics
were on TV and I was sipping a glass of my current tasty brew, widely known
in my house as Old Opacity.
        On the TV, I noticed an ice skater suddenly leap into the air and spin
around three or four times. What is the usefulness of that, I wondered.
        The public loved it. The judges gave him high marks according to the rule
book. I tend to rank things according to general utility, so I gave the
dervish a negative ten and returned to my book.
        Soon, our friend Al was carefully explaining how to get haze out of beer.
What is the usefulness of that, I wondered. I think haze is usually protein
and vitamin-laden yeast. Ain't that good for you? 
        The public expects clear beer because they never saw any other kind. Beer
judges demand it for most styles, I assume because of the rule book.
Mentally I gave Al K a 5.9 for thoroughness.
        Next time I serve a glass of Old Opacity to a guest, I intend to point out
with quiet pride that it has an ample portion of nutritious haze -- a
health benefit withheld from the public by the big brewing companies.
        If a few of you influential brewers will help a little, I believe we can
turn this thing around and get it back on the right track.


Support nutritious haze!

Subject: Bucket odors




Several people have been posting both Pro and Con answers to
William Warren's question about using a pickle bucket for fermenting.


I don't have any direct experience with pickles, but thought I
would pass on my experience so others could avoid it.  I was trying to
get some of those dreaded Sam Adams foil labels off (they really are
bulletproof.)  I tried a two hour soak in 120F or so Spic-n-Span TM.
It only did a moderate job on the labels, but the pine scent did a
horrible job on my 7 gallon primary bucket.  I tried everything
to get it out.  Reading in HBD about using sunshine to deodorize pickle
buckets, I tried it for two weeks.  Scentless! I thought I had it beat.


I made an Octoberfest, and spent weeks swapping frozen 2 liter pop
bottles in a cooler.  When I opened the primary to siphon it to a
carboy, I got the first hint of disaster.  The aroma of pine cleaner
was faint but unmistakable.  Even after weeks in secondary and months
in the bottle all I tasted/smelled was pine.  That is the only 
whole batch (of beer) that I have tossed.


 DON'T PUT ANY SCENTED CLEANERS IN A FERMENTING BUCKET (even for an hour)
 ----------===----------------------------------------


In fact even delabeling bottles with bleach leaves tiny bits stuck
to a bucket that I can't get off without seriously scratching the
plastic.  Seems like a better career for that pickle bucket.


If you think a pickle bucket is ready for a fermenter, try
"brewing" a batch of plain water with LID ON for a week or so.
The delay may be a pain, but throwing out five gallons of
'dill' water is less painful than five gallons of beer.

I'm sure you meant to say "no software that wasn't written in Perl by
an old UNIX curmudgeon".  Check out
http://www.best.com/~smurman/zymurgy/scripts.html
Hopefully it would be totally useless for anyone who insists on using
Windows, but you should be able to dig out the equations for your
spreadsheets.  I use it, and it does work pretty well.


You do indeed need to account for the thermal inertia of the mash tun.
You can easily determine this by heating some water, measuring the
temperature, pouring it into your mashtun, waiting 5 minutes, and then
checking the new temperature.  You'll have to run through some
equations, but it should get you a value close enough for government
work.  Check the HBD archives for the equations to use (enthalpy
remains constant), or Ken Schwartz's web page.


Using a thicker mash (~1.0 qt/lb) and a good lab-grade thermometer
also seem to help.

 ..........No such luck here..... I have a strong scotch ale in secondary
now 3+weeks since brewday.. I used the 1728 stepped up to 2 Liters..no
aeration.. and cool ferment 56-58F... it started at 1.081 but is only down
to 1.036 now... it is still active 10 Bub/min and cloudy indicates yeast in
suspension. 
This was designed to be a Traquair style and I pulled the second runnings
off for a small beer 'Bear Ale'.. starting `at` 1.045 and after 7 days 1.014
(CliniTest says its done) as intended
Both beers were mashed for high dextrin content... single infusion `at`158F I
was expecting an attenuation of 66%
The only diff between the 2 worts was that I pulled 1 Gal of thick first
runnings (1.115) and boiled down to ~1pint (thicker than any extract I've
used) and added this back to the big beer.  Also, I did pull it off the
primary yeast bed after the kreusen fell.. it had only dropped to 1.045 by
then... was I too early?? .. could that have upset the fermentation
program?? .. were my yeast not happy??
I have never had a strong beer take this long before.. is it stuck?? ..
there seems to be a lot of activity but the gravity is really dropping
slowly (clinitest now reads 1.5-2%+ fermenrtable sugar left).. I had a
chance to talk with Frank Smith (Ian's associate) at Traquair House last
fall and he says he quite often has a problem with slow fermentations and
just rouses it and turns up the heat some... 
I am trying to avoid this.. 
Is this slow ferm normal at cool temps?? 
 ...any comments are welcome

Food chemists have been toying with specific proteins and their related
Maillard
products for some time, creating specific flavor analogs.  One of the early
commercial applications from the 1960s or 70s was the discovery that
proteins
in (autolysed) yeast can be used to create Maillard products that have
a good artificial meat flavor or broth flavor.  This shouldn't be much of a
surprise since a well seared steak gains much of it's flavor from the
Maillard
reactions between the meat proteins and the (relatively small amount of)
carbo-
hydrates.  I guess that yeast aren't the only ones to eat autolysed yeast.

Brewsters:


After commenting on the enzyme mortality in a recent HBD,
I came across a tangentially related article in Chem and
Engineering News, 1/16/98 p29.


"Active Enzyme Found in 4,000 year old Mummy"


Check out the full article in Nature 391,343 (1998).


The article in part comments that the preservation methods
were so good that the mummy's bones contain an enzyme
that is still active.  Alkaline phosphatase isolated contained
20% of the activity of a modern sample.


How were dem dry bones preserved?  Sodium carbonate
( natron) and wood tar ( which is loaded with phenolics and
is antiseptic).

Also in the Feb 2,1998 C&EN p25 is the article


"Yeast Engineered to Synthesize Steroids"


Full Article is in  Nat. Biotechnol.,16,186 ( 1998)


French workers have engineered S. Cerevisiae yeast to
generate pregnenolone, the precursor to all steroid
hormones and convert it to progesterone.


Is the ability to ferment beer which is also
a birth control pill far behind? Would this be the

After Ken Sullivan contemplated cutting the voltage in half on his
4500W/240VAC and 1500W/240VAC heaters to get 2250/120 and 750/120, Ken
Schwartz said that "Running a load on half the voltage QUARTERS the
power." and offered Power = Voltage-Squared/Resistance as the proof.


This goes back a few years, but I always thought that


Watts = Volts x Amps


Which leads me to think that if you cut voltage in half, and feed the
same amperage, you'll cut the wattage in half.  Am I missing something
here?  I hereby disclaim any knowledge of the workings of electricity;
the stuff causes me shocking experiences.  I'm just hoping that
everything I know isn't wrong.

The major difference/advantage between using 240V over 120V is the amount
of amps.  A 120V motor drawing 30 amps will only pull 15 amps on a 240V
circut.  I would rather get zapped by 15 amps than 30 amps any day...  If
you want to run a 240V GFI circut, you can pick up a GFI circut breaker
at a spa shop for about 100 bucks.....

Morey is the equation found in the Brewery, Noonan is his beer color

data from Designing Great Beers p. 61.  The AVG is just the average
color for any data that is provide at each MCU.  You can use the tabular
form above or the equations below:


EQUATION          A     B      C
Morey           1.49   0.69    0
Noonan         15.03   0.27  -15.53
Daniels         1.73   0.64   -0.267
AVG             1.47   0.68    0.73


The form of the equation for final beer color is:


Final Beer Color = [A * (MCU^B)] + C


Just pick an equation and look up the constants in the table.  Remember
that MCU for each malt is the weight multiplied by the degrees Lovibond,
divided by the beer volume.  The MCUs for all the components of the
grist are then summed and used in the equation.


Nothing original here, I just regurgitated the work of others, and added
a few mathematical tweeks (Ya OK, I admit to being a beer engineering
geek, but this is part of the fun of it for me :>}).  I am sure this
will capture the interest of somebody out there in HBD land.

I hope someone will tell me that I don't have to ask "Is my beer ruined?"


I reversed normal practice for some absentminded reason today. Racked off
the starter beer from a large yeast cake, pitched the yeast, then tasted
the beer.


It was like strong, acidic rose-hip tea, very tart. Nothing like beer at
all.


The yeast had behaved well - It was step up 3 in about a gallon of
well-aerated 1.060 wort (DME). Quiet for a few days, then a normal krausen
for a few days, then cloudy beer, then clear beer. Cool temps (55F).


I worked hard on a Scotch Ale, and had some incredibly tasty 1.082 wort. It
was a disappointing shock to taste the acidic starter beer.


I expect I just infected that lovely wort.


Someone say it ain't so!

Subject: Water Chemistry


Hi. I've been reading up on my water chemistry lately and from the 
references we have that reside in the Brewery pages, as well as from 
some homebrewing texts(TNCJOHB comes to mind), there is always a mention 
of "ppm". We all know that this means "parts per millon", but are these 
parts based on weight or by atoms?


There is alot of difference and one should not confuse them. Many 
references state that, for example, 1 gram of Gypsum(CaSO4) dissolved in 
1 gallon of water will yield theoretically/ideally ~61ppm of Ca and  
~147ppm of SO4. When you add 1 gram of CaSO4, you are adding a measured 
number of "moles" of this substance. In this mole, there would an equal 
amount of Ca atoms and SO4 atoms, meaning that you are adding:


One gram    Molecular    Avogadro's    No.of molecules
 of      /   weight    x            /  of water in    x 1 million
salt used    of Caso4    Constant      one gallon


= 0.35ppm of both Ca and SO4 to 1 gallon of deionized water.


On the other hand, if ppm were a unit of weight, then everything would  
make more sense.....for Gypsum at least.


If we look at Epsom salts(MgSO4), the addition of 1 gram to a gallon of 
water will yield(according to texts) ~26ppm of Mg and ~101ppm of SO4. If 
you divide the 1 gram of salt used by the relative molecular mass of 
MgSO4 will give you the number of moles used. This, multiplied by the 
atomic mass of Mg will give you the weight of Mg used. In one million 
grams of water, this would mean 52.8"ppm" of Mg, twice that stated in 
texts, as would follow the SO4 portion of Epsom.


To those who are familiar with the chemistry, please point out if I am 
going wrong at any point. To those who know it, merely adding a stated 
amount of any salt will not always yield the ion concentrations that are 
theoretical. They are all there, but may precipitate out with other ions 
to form other compounds and might not contribute to the mash chemistry 
as you might want it to, especially when the temperature fluctuates. 
Anyway, my two cents worth. Can anyone help me understand the basis of 
the water profiles published in all the popular references?


Thanks,
Greg

Subject: Long Secondaries


I don't get it. A LOT of recipies call for an initial 5-10 primary
fermentation and then for a lengthier fermentation in a secondary.
Following this, the recipes usually call for packaging and priming with
corn sugar. What I don't understand, and have NEVER been able to
achieve, is successful natural carbonation of a beer after it has been
in a primary and/or secondary for longer than about two weeks. Usually
the yeast has completely autolysed by this point and can no longer
reproduce due to the alcohol content. Has anyone been successful at
bottle conditioning their beers after a long (14-20 day) fermentation
without use of additional yeast? Why do recipes call for such a lengthy
secondary fermentation when corn sugar is being used as a primer? I can
see the benefits of conditioning a beer in the secondary for a long
time, but that's only if you have a CO2 tank to force carbonate it with.


Cheers,
Paul
