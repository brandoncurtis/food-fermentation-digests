Subject: RE:  Salt additions / hazy beer


     Hi all,
     
     Kyle asks some good questions about salt additions.  He wonders if
     they are used primarily for flavor effects or pH control of the mash.
     He also wonders when to add them, and how much.
     
     Salt additions can be used for both pH control and flavor effects.
     The problems with using them for pH control are:
     
     1.  You will also get the flavor effects, which may be undesirable.
     
     2.  It's not Reinheitsgebot (not a problem for some).
     
     3.  By adding salts, you will increase the concentrations of some ions
     that you need, but you will also increase the concentration of ions
     you may not want.
     
     For example, if you add gypsum (calcium sulphate, CaSO4) to the mash
     to increase Ca+2 (to lower mash pH), you will also be increasing the
     SO4-2 ion.  SO4 has a pretty large effect on the flavor of the beer
     (increases and alters the perception of hop bitterness).  If you are
     brewing a Muenchner Helles this is not desirable!
     
     If you are using salts to control mash pH, obviously they must be
     added to the mash.  It is easiest to add them to the water before
     mash in (to ensure even distribution).  Of course, some salts are not 
     very soluble in plain water (like calcium carbonate), but most people
     don't have a need to add this.  If you must add this, it will dissolve
     in the mash (weakly acidic solution).
     
     You *absolutely* must know your water's natural chemistry before you
     start throwing all sorts of salts into your brewing water!  I cannot
     stress this enough!  Recipes that blindly call for salt additions
     should ignored!!!
     
     Think about it this way:  you decide to use calcium chloride (CaCl2)
     to lower your mash pH.  Your brewing water may already be near the
     upper limit for desirable chloride content.  By adding more, you just
     pushed it way over the top.  The same is true for all the ions you
     might add.
     
     If you are adding salts simply for their flavor contribution, you can
     add them to the boil rather than the mash.  You should have a decent
     gram scale for weighing out salts.  Volume measurements really don't
     cut it.  The amounts you add are dependent on your water's natural
     chemistry.
     ----------------------------
     There has been some talk about hazy beer.  I used to think, "What the
     heck, a little haze is natural."  This is true for some styles.  Haze
     can signify other problems, though.
     
     Haze can simply be "chill haze," a protein-phenol complex that becomes
     insoluble at cold temperatures and thus clouds your cool brew.  Haze
     can also be caused by excessive starch.  Starch in beer is bad.  It
     shows that there are fundamental problems with your techniques, and
     leads to beer stability and flavor problems.
     
     Haze can also be caused by yeast that have not flocculated.  Most
     brewing yeasts usually flocculate, so lack of flocculation can be the
     sign of some problems.  Wild yeasts tend to not flocculate.  You don't
     want them in your beer (for several reasons)!  Suspended yeast can
     make the beer taste yeasty, too.  As Jim Busch pointed out, this is
     not often desirable.
     
     Haze can also be caused by an extreme bacterial infection.  If your
     beer is turbid from bacteria you will probably be put off by its
     aroma before the appearance can ever bother you, though.
     
     So, as you can see, haze is not always the innocuous creature that
     many believe it to be.  It is relatively easy to produce clear beer
     without filtration in a homebrewery.  If you don't like haze, there is
     no reason to tolerate it!
     
     Have fun!

Hop polyphenols have a significantly higher degree of condensation 
[coagulation, perhaps?] and  a higher reactivity than malt
polyphenols. The latter [malt polyphenols]  count for 80%  of the
polyphenols in wort. If hops are added at beginning, the hop polyphenols
react quickly, whereas a higher part of the slow reacting malt polyphenols
remain in the wort and in the final beer, where they -because of low
reactivity- cause haze in a later stage. That's the main reason for point
11.

Sehr geehrter Herr Hanghofer,


Ihr interessantes e-mail wurde mir von Herrn Hendel von unserer VLB
uebermittelt, erreichte mich aber wegen eines Urlaubs erst jetzt. Ich
freue mich, dass die die Haus- und Microbrewer so intensiv und
kompetent ueber eine elektronische mailingliste miteinander
kommunizieren und sich auch wirklich ernsthaft mit den vielen Fragen
und Problemen bei der Bierherstellung auseinanderzusetzen. Leider ist
mein Englisch etwas mangelhaft, so dass ich mich lieber in der
deutschen Sprache an Sie wende. Ich bitte Sie aber, den so
Interessierten Haus- und Mikrobrauern auf diesem Wege meine Freude
darueber zum Ausdruck zu bringen. Wenn ich nun die Diskussion richtig
verstehe, geht es um die Frage, wie der Punkt 11 auf S.396 deutsch =
242 englisch:
 - Hopfengabe nicht zu frueh - Malzgerbstoffe sollen reagieren
zu bewerten sei. 
Diese alte Erkenntnis beruht darauf, dass die Polyphenole des Hopfens
in einem wesentlich hheren Kondensationsgrad vorliegen und auch
wesentlich reaktionsfreudiger sind als die Polyphenole aus dem Malz,
die aber wiederum etwa 80% der gesamten Polyphenole in der Wrze
ausmachen. Wird der Hopfen am Anfang zugesetzt, reagieren seine
Gerbstoffe sehr rasch, whrend die langsam reagierenden aus dem Malz
zu einem hheren Anteil in der Wuerze und im Bier verbleiben und bei
ihrer Reaktionstrgheit erst viel spaeter zu einer Truebung im Bier
Anlass geben. Das ist die Hauptursache dieser Aussage, die natuerlich
bei Verwendung von PVPP oder anderen Adsorbentien nicht mehr so zum
Tragen kommt. Ich weiss allerdings nicht, ob die Microbrewer
Adsorbentien oder Faellungsmittel zur Stabilisierung verwenden. Ich 
hoffe, dass Ihnen diese Aussage genuegt und bin gern bereit, bei
weiteren Fragen Rede und Antwort zu stehen (aber moeglichst in
deutsch).

Subject: More Water-Treatment Questions


Kyle Druey writes:


  I have a few questins while we are on the topic of water chemistry and
  salt addition.
  
  1)  When do you add salt additions: to the gross brewing water volume
  (this is the final beer volume plus extra water to account for any
  losses in the brewing process),  to the mash tun, to the boil kettle?
  
I add everything to the "gross brewing water" volume, though I don't think my
brewing water is all *that* gross ;-).  I buy my RO water in two 5-gallon
plastic carboys (with handles), measure in the salts, and pick the bastards up
and shake them (it's actually pretty easy with the handles).  That said, there
are special cases where adding to the mash is appropriate; see below.


  2)  If you add salts to the gross brewing water volume some salts will
  not readily dissolve until lactic acid is added.  Is this normal, or am
  I doing something wrong?  


"Some slats" is probably chalk.  This will only dissolve at a rate of about
1/4 gram per 5 gallons!  This amount of chalk is not enough to significantly
affect the ion composition, so chalk additions to plain unacidified water is
useless.  The other salts that I use -- epsom salts, baking soda, non-iodized
table salt, calcium chloride, and gypsum -- dissolve quite readily in water.
The addition of acid will improve the dissolution of chalk.  AJ deLange has
proposed bubbling CO2 though the water to lower its pH (by creation of
carbonic acid, BTW this mimics natural processes) and facilitate chalk
dissolution.
  
  3)  Are the salts added primarily to pre-adjust the mash pH, or for
  flavor effects in the finished beer?  Seems as if the types/amounts of
  salts needed would then be a function of what your objectives are.  If
  you just want to alter mash pH, then the famous brewing water profiles
  commonly found in homebrewing texts may not be very useful.


This post was made before my response to Scott Murman in a recent HBD.  Go
back a couple issues and look for it if you didn't catch it.  Bottom line --
you're right, but as always, It Depends.
  
  4)  I have been calculating my salt additions based on the gross water
  volume, and adding them there.  Like I mentioned above, some salts do
  not readily dissolve, but I add this water to the mash tun anyway.  The
  remainder of the water is used for sparging, which is acidified with
  lactic acid, after which the mineral salts dissolve. What happens to the
  undissolved salts that are added to dough in the grist?  Do they
  dissolve once the mash pH is adjusted, or do they somehow get 'trapped'
  in the grain bed?
  
You can work with undissolved chalk if you can keep it suspended (by vigorous
stirring) during strike-in.  This will ensure it's evenly distributed and it
will dissolve once it reacts with the malt.  Adding to the mash after mash-in
will work too since the acidity of the mash will dissolve the chalk readily.
Note that chalk is calcium carbonate.  The calcium wants to react with the
mash to lower pH (by creating acid); but the carbonate wants to add alkalinity
and raise pH.  In this race, the carbonate wins after a certain amount of
chalk.  So watch your mash pH if you add chalk.


  5)  Once you add the salts, and you then have to add more salts to
  adjust the mash pH, what happens then?  Do you run the risk of adding
  too much of the wrong kinds of minerals?


Gypsum (calcium sulphate) is a common mash acidifier, and adding more gypsum
adds more sulphate which can be detrimental to some styles.  For these kinds
of beers, adding acid may be a better choice to avoid sulphate.
  
  6)  Are calculating salt additions worth the time and effort?  Or is it
  just easier, and produces the same outcome, to ignore salt
  additions/calculations and adjust the mash pH with lactic acid to lower
  the pH, and use calcium carbonate to increase the pH?
  
Mash pH should always be the last word in your salt additions, but creating
"profiles" for specific flavor effects is also one of the goals.  In my recent
post I suggested a few simple recipes that should cover most of your brewing
situations, if you don't want to do the work yourself (or if you just want a
"good-enough" water).  I doubt that subtle "errors" versus published "classic"
water profiles will have any discernable effect on your beer.


  I am sure most of us have read that the Bavarians originally could not
  brew Pilsners because when they mashed with lightly kilned malts and
  added their hard water (hard when compared to Pilzen) to the grist the
  resulting mash pH was not enzyme friendly.  Perhaps designing mineral
  salt recipes based on the composition of the grist is more appropiate? 
  i.e. darker malts generally lower the mash pH, design water recipes the
  account for this...  Doesn't Daniels in his book DGB suggest that the
  mash pH will be lowered by 0.2 for every 10% of dark malts that comprise
  the grist?


I have seen a couple of sources on figuring mash pH vs composition but in my
ignorance I'm guessing it's much more complicated than simply plugging in a
grain bill and water chemistry and getting an accurate pH (but who knows).
I've read (Daniels?  Pappazian?) that adding distilled water to pale malt will
establish a pH around 5.9 (or thereabouts), too high for proper efficient
enzyme action.  Adding calcium facilitates creation of pH-reducing acid.
Adding acid lowers pH.  Letting the grist "go lactic" biologically will lower
the pH.  Adding dark malts will lower pH.

Subject: Salts addition,


Brewsters:


Kyle Druey asks about when and how much minerals to add
to produce beer.


The Ca ion content in pale ale malt mashes should be around
50 ppm in the mash to provide the correct pH and avoid interfering
with enzyme activity. In the case of Pilsners and RO water, I
don't add any minerals at any time and it all works fine.  If you
choose to do the real Burton style waters add half of the salts
in the mash tun and the other half in the sparge and avoid adding
lactic acid if you are searching for real ale authenticity. 




To get the calcium carbonate to dissolve you may have to treat
a sample of water and salts with CO2 using a carbonater and
a liter soda bottle.


Your idea of using the grist composition to determine the
mineralization of the brewing liquor is, of course, just the
opposite of the early brewers who varied the grist to match
the local water.  This resulted in beers which were distinctive
by geography.

Greetings, Michael (et al...) -




Remember that you had a slow fermentation rate of "0.3 glub/min"
and that racking drives A LOT of CO2 out of solution. I suspect
that your fermentation IS active, but the CO2 is just going
directly into solution rather than escaping.  It seems reasonable
to suppose that no gas will come out until the dissolved CO2
concentration reaches saturation.  That could take a while given
the CO2 production rate you gave.  


Your batch sounds just like the plain 3# mead that I started back
in Spring '93.  I had the same experience when I racked the
stuff.  It had a comparable fermentation rate as yours at the
time.  The airlock did start bubbling again after "a few" days (I
can't remember exactly how long it took).


As for the rest - Yes, the must wouldn't taste terrific at this
point.  Mine took 2 years after bottling to even start to mellow,
and about 15 months to ferment out completely (FG = 0.997 IIRC).
This was also with champagne yeast and a "cautious" dose of 
nutrient.  Take heart, though - the final product should be 
fantastic.  Mine has finally taken of the characteristic of a
good white wine.  Mostly like a chardonnay, but with a completely
different aftertaste.


Unfortunately, much patience is required of the meadmaker...

pint serving glass availability from restaurant suppliers. They sell a
pint glass made by Libby's, I believe, that is actually a mixing glass
for bartending. The kind where you slip a metal glass on the open end
and shake, not stir.


So a publican pours into a pint glass, creates a head, and you usually
end up with about 14 oz of beer, depending on head size. I have the same
glasses at home that I use for pouring homebrews. My 12 oz. fits with
room to spare if my pours are patient. BTW, some brewpubs use true 0.5 L
steins.

Subject: Spalt rhizomes


Spring is nearly upon us in the U.S. Midwest (actually, thanks to El Nino, it's
felt like spring for quite some time). My wife and I want to try our hand at
growing our own hops. We plan on growing some Cascade, as it is supposedly easy
to grow and we like it!


Another one I would love to grow is Spalt. Does anyone know of anyone anyplace
who sells Spalt rhizomes? I realize I'm asking for almost the impossible, but
if anyone knows a homebrew shop that carries them or knows of a farm that grows
Spalt that would be willing to sell my some rhizomes, I would be in be
eternally in your debt.


Hoping to be Spalting,
  Matt

Subject: Steinbier


     Hi all,
     
     A while back I asked some practical questions about the production of
     Steinbier.  I just thought I'd let you all know that I brewed it this
     weekend.  There were no injuries or loss of property.  Very dull.
     
     I brewed up 15 gallons of 1.062 Oktoberfest wort and took 4.5 gallons
     of it for the Steinbier (it was later diluted down to 1.049).  My
     friend Bob and I built a fire with seasoned oak and a few pieces of
     scrap maple I had laying around.  When we ran out of wood we tore
     apart a dead Japanese maple that was standing a few feet away and
     burned it.
     
     We used all sorts of rocks, mostly from the woods north of New York
     City (they don't call the land "Rockland county" for nothing).  I
     didn't test any of the rocks before brew day.  Every one of them fell
     apart in the fire.  Only one exploded with any kind of force, and it
     wasn't that tremendous.  It only sent a flake about 2 feet in the air.
     
     The rocks never did glow red, although they were hot enough to ignite
     wood on contact.  What fun!  Upon dropping them in the wort we were
     somewhat surprised by the lack of violence.  The stones hissed, some 
     bubbles rose, and that was it.  We did achieve boiling from a 
     temperature of about 140F (60C), though.  None of the rocks exploded 
     upon cooling in the wort.
     
     The wort only boiled a few minutes after dropping the rocks in, so I
     finished the boil on the stove.  The wort really didn't taste all that
     different from the Oktoberfest wort (it wasn't diluted to 1.049 until
     the end of the boil), despite the ashes that were floating in it
     (a few bits of burnt wood made it to the kettle...)
     
     I saved some of the rocks in a corny keg that I sanitized with 
     iodophor
     and boiling water (I boiled all the fittings, too).  The rock-filled
     keg was purged with CO2 and refrigerated.  I must say that the rocks
     didn't seem to have much character.  I tasted one that wasn't for the
     keg and found it to be, um, rock-like.  Not too sweet.
     
     Some of the rocks did have a lot of proteinaceous gunk on them.  That
     plus the fact that I am reluctant to put beer into a keg that was 
     sanitized weeks in advanced (for the "lagering on the rocks" phase) 
     makes me wonder if it is worth reintroducing the beer to the rocks.
     
     Any opinions?
     
     Overall, it was a fun day.  The wort smells really nice in the
     fermenter, and the lag time was really short.  I'll probably rack it
     off the yeast this weekend, and in another week put it "on the rocks,"
     if I decide to do that.  I'll report back on how it turns out.
     
     Have fun!

mra`at`skyfry.com (Matthew Arnold) proposed the following recipe:


>Lion Fan in Packerland Extremely Bitter IPA


>11#     English Pale Ale malt
>.5#    60L Crystal malt
>.5#    Victory malt
>.5#    Wheat malt
>2.5  oz Centennial pellets (75 mins)
> .5  oz Centennial (10 mins)
>1    oz Cascade (10 mins)
>1    oz Cascade (at knockout / dry hop)
>#1098 British Ale yeast


Assuming this recipe is intended for 5.5 gallons in the fermenter, I 
would
be more concerned with overdoing the bitterness on this than the citrus
flavor.  The flavor and aroma will fade with aging much faster than the
bitterness.  I calculated over 100 IBUs.  Even for an IPA that is off the


map.  You can sometimes get away with it on a very malty Barley Wine, but


I'm afraid I wouldn't enjoy it on a beer w/ an OG of 1.060-1.070 (1.064 `at`


75% efficiency).  




I too am of the hop appreciative kind, but what truly differenciates a
hoppy beer IMO is the flavor and aroma from late additions and dry 
hopping.
 You might want to cut back to ~50 IBUs and stay with the generous late 
hop
additions maybe even going for some dry hops in secondary and see how 
that
suits your taste buds.

So a publican pours into a pint glass, creates a head, and you usually
end up with about 14 oz of beer, depending on head size. I have the same
glasses at home that I use for pouring homebrews. My 12 oz. fits with

I wish I had my copy of Dr. Fix's new book here... I'm pretty sure this
would be in there, but he was good enough to send me a copy of a paper
he had written a few years ago which described some experiments he ran
with Irish Moss.  Several different varieties of IM were tried at several
different concentrations.  Rehydration of the IM was done and it was
stressed that this was very important.  There were tradeoffs between
head retention and clarity and a few other factors, but my reading of
the data indicated to me that 1/8 gram per liter of *refined flakes* was
the best choice.  After determining this, I immediately called L.D.Carlson
(my primary wholesaler at the time, when I owned a HB shop) and asked
what kind of IM they were shipping me.  It turns out it was "refined
Irish Moss flakes."


Note also that in one of the Beer and Brewing books (the transcripts of
the AHA National Conference) there is a talk by Terry Foster on finings.
He explained why "too much" of a fining is worse than "not enough."  My
own experiments have shown this to be true.


I weighed out 2.4 grams of those L.D.Carlson refined flakes and found that
it was pretty close to a level TEAspoon.


Now, let's think about how extract is made for a second.  It is concentrated
from a normal wort, right?  I had a suspicion that the amount of IM you
need is dependent on the amount of protein in the wort and if some of
the protein was removed as break from the extract during production, extract
batches would require less IM, right?  My experiments indeed confirmed
this suspicion.


To make a short story long, my tests indicated that, for a 1.050 OG
extract wort, 1/4 TEAspoon of rehydrated, refined Irish Moss flakes was
the proper amount.  This happens to be exactly the amount that Charlie
Papazian recommends in his book, but I don't recall if he distinguishes
between extract and all-grain amounts.  Note that this should scale
linearly... for a 1.100 extract wort, 1/2 teaspoon should be correct.


It could be that higher amounts of IM are needed when rehydration is
not done or in high-protein worts or on worts whose pH is radically
different than the norm... that might explain why some people find they
need a lot more than these recommended amounts


I had better shut up now... you've heard the story about free milk and
a cow right?

sacred cows:


% (parts per hundred), ppt, ppm, ppb, etc. etc. are all
based on Mass, unless otherwise specified.  If one wants to
talk moles (or molecules) then one says "mole percent" or
"mole fraction", or something similar.


Also, when expressing mg/L or mg/kg, the amount in the
denominator is always the total amount of SOLUTION, again
unless otherwise specified.


One should always be careful, as different fields may make up
their own definitions, but these have never steered me wrong.


Happy brewing...

Subject: 1 BBL RIMS Design


Brewsters:  Brad asks about large batch RIMSing.
 
>My specific question is in response to Dion Hollenbeck's BT article on
>RIMS (I am cc'ing this to him). He refers to the practical limits of
>in-line heating elements as being 10 gal batch/20 lb grain bill. He

The physical limit for RIMSing is controlled by the maximum flow rate
you can achieve without generating a stuck mash condition, and the
minimum flow rate without scorching the wort.  If your flow rate is high
enough, using a 6000W high density element run on 240V will not scorch
your wort, and the higher voltage is necessary for a 1 bbl design.  The
critical factors to consider are the false bottom open area, the crush,
and the grain bed thickness.  If you can minimize the grain bed
thickness (large diameter mash tun), use a coarse crush (something like
0.065" nip, compared to the usual the 0.04"-0.05"), and maximize the
percent open area of the false bottom (70% seems to be the practical max
and still prevent husks from passing thru) then large batch RIMSing
*may* be possible. What I and many other RIMSers have found is that
there is a limit on the maximum flow rate one can achieve without
sticking the mash, which is a function of the pump characteristics and
the grain bed depth.  I have found that a maximum grain bed depth of 4"
is advisable to prevent a stuck mash with my Teel #1P677A magnetically
coupled pump on full flow.  If you are doing a 30 gal batch, a 1.060
gravity beer, and your extraction is 30 pts, then your grist will be
(30*60)/30 = 60 lbs grain. Using a rough guide that 1 lb of crushed malt
occupies about 1 qt, the grain volume is 60*0.25 = 15 gallons. 60# of
grain occupying 15 gallons in the mash tun at a grain bed thickness of
4" requires a mash tun diameter of (assuming a circular mash tun):
 
D = { [(15 gal)*(0.134 ft3/gal)] / [(pi/4)*(4"/12)] }^0.5 * 12 =  34" 
 
Wow, just about the size of the SS housing for my pool's DE filter! 
Your next problem will be to estimate the heat input needed to raise the
temperature of a 60# mash at a decent rate.  I have read that commercial
temp boost rates are 1 deg C per min, or 1.8 F/min.  Using this rate,
and a mash thickness of 1.25 qts/lb, you would need the following
wattage:
 
thermal mass of mash = (60*1.25*0.25) + (60*0.4) =  42.75 gal water
(the factor 0.4 is a way to convert the heat capacity of grain in pounds
to gallons of water)


Heat Input Required = 1.8 * 42.75 * 147 = 11,300 W  (KennyEddy Equation)


11,300 Watts is incredible!  I only use 1125W with my RIMS for my 3.875
gal batches.  Assuming you can use two 6000W inline heaters run on 240V,
what flow rate do you need to prevent scorching?  I have observed that
scorching of the wort occurs when the heater delta T is greater than 8 F
(I realize many of you RIMSer think this is high, but this is *my*
experience).  This is using a low watt density heating element of about
16 W/sqin.  If you have a 6000W element run on 240V, then the heat
density is about 72 W/sqin.  I am going to make a WAG of an assumption
here, and assume the delta T of scorching in relation to the heater
element wattage is linear, and guestimate that the critical delta T to
prevent wort scorching with the 6000W element is about 8 * (16/72) = 1.8
deg F.  You need the following flow rate across the 6000W element to
obtain a 1.8 deg F delta T:
 
Critical Flow Rate = (6000W/1000)/(0.062*4.18*1.8*1.8) = 7.2 gpm  
 
You need a pump that can generate a flow rate of at least 7.2 gpm during
the temp boosts to use the 6000W elements on 240V, with the above 1 bbl
parameters.  This seems pretty fast, you may even need to decrease the
grain bed depth to say 2".  Also realize that you will have to double
that delta T since you will probably only have a temp reading on each
end of your heat chamber (a thermometer on each end between two 6000W
elements).  Some folks have used steam to add heat to the system, I
think one HBDer reported a temp rise rate of 4 F/m with steam.  This
might be a better option to investigate.  Brad, if you build this
monster let us all know how it turns out!  Realize I have not built this
thing, and I am assuming 100% efficiencies and I did not use any
temperature corrections.


You can't get away with nuttin on this forum, too many engineering
nerds, P.iled h.igh & D.eepers, and plant doctors.  I am sure I have few
math errors in there, but I believe the thermal models are correct. 
Feel free to chime in with corrections, but if you have a nit or two to
pick offer improvements also instead of just flames.

RE my post on molal vs. molar in #2647:


Of course the molal scale is not measured in mg/kg. It is measured in
moles/kg. Similarly the molar scale measures in moles/liter, not mg/L.
Yes, one measures out the milligrams to add to a kilogram (ppm ) in
preparing a molal solution but then must divide by the molecular weight
to obtain the molality. In preparing a  molar solution, one measures mg
to add to a liter and again must divide by the molecular weight. In the
former case the result is millimoles/kg - this is the molal value. In
the latter the result is millimoles/L - this is the molar value. The
whole point is that per weight vs. per volume isn't important in brewing
calculations because the solutions are dilute. Funny how this error
glares from the page today but was hidden when I wrote it.

Subject: Colour units


There has been some recent discussion of colour units and predicting
beer colour from the grain bill.


I take an extremely simple view of beer colour: if you use the right
grains/malts for the recipe, you will have the right colour.


Here are a few examples:


Munchener Dunkels are traditionally made from dark Munich malt and a
decoction mash.  I make my from around 90 to 95% dark Munich and 5
to 10% Aromatic or Melanoidin malt (these are like "super Munich" malts).
I infusion mash, which is why I add these malts (to increase melanoidin
content).  The resulting beer comes out smack dab in the middle of the
guidelines.


Bitter?  5 to 7% crystal malt (say, 30 to 60 L) and the rest is Pale
Ale malt.  Result.  A beer within the (very wide) colour range for
Bitters.  Actually, Timothy Taylor Landlord (one of my favourites) is
on the pale side and is made from 100% Pale Ale malt.  I tried emulating
this beer using DeWolf-Cosysns, Crisp Maris Otter and Munton's Pale Ale
malts.  The Crisp and Munton's batches were quite good, but the DWC
made a too-pale beer which also was short on Bitter-like flavour.
Recall that DWC is Belgian and the other two are English.


To me the bottom line is: use the proper malts for the style and the
colour will take care of itself.


Ahh, but what about the extract Munchner Dunkel or Oktoberfest or
Doppelbock?  I contend that you can sort of approximate the flavours
of these (and a few other) styles, but you won't be able to hit them
spot on because crystal and dark (chocolate, black, etc.) malts lend
the wrong flavours to these styles.  I'm sure George Di Piro will back
me up on this... too many O'fests are made with too much crystal and the
resulting beer doesn't taste authentic.


Am I looking at colour too simplistically?

Subject: re:1 bbl RIMS


I should clarify that my aims are a bit more modest; 1/2 bbl. is what I 
have in mind due to other limitations in system. My MT shape is 
essentially a round-bottomed pot in cross-section. The diameter is 23 
max; the diameter at the level I would probably place the false bottom 
is 16". The available depth up to the top of the jacketed portion 
(important for insulation /  heat maintenance reasons) is 9". My maximum 
anticipated grain bill is about 40 lbs. It has occurred to me that a low 
pressure steam system using the steam jacket could be useful in temp 
boosts - but that opens an entire new can of worms re: safety issues, 
need for pressure testing of the jacket (why do you suppose I found it 
in a scrapyard?) etc.  I expect Kyle's reference to steam was injected 
steam? Which is certainly a possiblity
