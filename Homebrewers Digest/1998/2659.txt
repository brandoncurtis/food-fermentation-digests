From: "Keith Royster" <keith`at`ays.net>
Subject: PID problem summary / Quick wort chilling via pump


>>PID problem summary<<


Thanks to all who responded to my recent questions regarding the 
problems with my Omega PID giving me temperature reading about 15dF 
too high.  I now believe the problem may actually be with my 
thermocouple, and not the PID. I also received a lot of responses 
from people that regularly use Omega products in their work 
environment who echoed my sentiment that they are a good company to 
deal with and that their products are of generally good quality.


A lot of people suggested that I may have tried to lengthen my t/c 
wire with some other non-t/c wire, which could cause an incorrect 
temp reading.  Others suggested that I may have my PID set to use the 
wrong type of t/c (type-T, type-J, etc.).  Both great suggestions, 
but they were not the cause of my problems. One responder suggested 
that any source of electronic interference might create such an 
effect, but I seriously doubt that was the source of my problem.


I think I may have discovered the real problem this weekend during a
brew session.  I have another temp probe that I bought from Superior
Products for about $35 that also uses a t/c connected to a digital
temp display unit.  I noticed that it was working well at the
beginning of the brew session when I was using it to monitor the temp
of my sparge water, but after the probe became completely submersed
it began to conistantly read about 20dF too high.  Later that day I
place the probe, still connected to the display, in my oven on low
heat to dry it out and was able to watch the temp reading slowly
return to normal.  Therefore I think my other t/c connected to my PID
has also gotten moisture inside that is causing the same problem. (My
theory is that the moisture is shorting a connection which gives an
incorrect voltage reading, thus the incorrect temp reading.)  On 
my PID t/c, there is a black rubber stopper thingy at the junction 
of the t/c probe and its wiring, but some of the rubber has come off 
exposing what appears to be a woody (cork?) material underneath.  I 
am betting that moisture has entered here and is causing the same 
problem.


My choices now are (1) reseal the rubber stopper and continue to use
the same probe while adjusting for the temp difference; (2) try to
drive out the moisture using the oven again, then reseal and use; or
(3) just buy a new t/c.  I may opt for #3 since they aren't that
expensive ($20) and this would eleminate most of the temp errors.


=================================================


>>Quick wort chilling via pump<<


Steven Jones <stjones1`at`worldnet.att.net> mentions his method of wort 
aeration where he loosens a connection in his tubing while he pumps 
the wort from his kettle to his carboy allowing air to get sucked in 
(Please, let's not revive the Venturi VS Bornoulli thread =). 


This reminded me of a new wort chilling method I did this past
weekend.  I have a love-hate relationship with my counterflow chiller
because I love it's effeciency over my immersion chiller, but the
immersion chiller is so much easier to sanitize since I just have to
drop it in the kettle during the last few minutes of the boil.  I
also have had problems pumping my wort through my CF-chiller because
of the extra head created by the friction losses through the
chiller. So this past brew session I placed the immersion chiller in
the kettle and then used the pump to recirculate the wort from the
bottom back to the top of the kettle, being careful not to cause
HSA.  This constant motion in the kettle improved the efficiency of
the immersion chiller to that of my CF-chiller, thus giving me the
best of both worlds.  It also allowed me to run my aeration stone
and aquarium pump in the kettle (once cooled below HSA temps) before
pumping into my carboy.


My question is, does anyone see any potential problems with this
method?  I know HSA is a potential problem, but I was careful to
eliminate all air within my pump and tubing, and to gently return
the wort to the top of the kettle.  I did notice that my wort was
very cloudy in the carboy, which I imagine is from the break
material being churned up during the recirculation, but I don't see
how that should be a problem. Assuming I decide to continue using
this method, I might have a CF-chiller for sale in the near future
(50' 3/8"copper inside garden hose with Phil's Phittings) =)

Subject: RE:Weyermann Malt


Eric Schoville asks about Weyermann Pilsner Malt in HDB2649:


Does anyone have experience with this malt?  I am thinking
about picking up a bag because it is relatively inexpensive
compared to other German Pilsener Malts.  Any feedback will
be greatly appreciated.




Eric (et al),


I have used this malt alot making German & American style lagers with
excellent results. According to The 1997 Brewers' Market Guide lot
analysis on that particular malt it has 4%-5% moisture content, an SRM
of 1-2L, and a DBFG of 80%-82%. I have found these stats to be pretty
accurate. I personally do not use it alot because I generally get my
malt mail order in small lots of 10-20 lbs. and the best price I have
found is around $1.10 per pound. But, when I make a "special" pilsner or
lager, it's well worth it. I can get Klages and other domestics for
about $.65 a pound so I buy those in bulk of 50# lots. 
Go for it, you won't be disappointed.


Cheers,

Subject: Re: chloramine heresies


AJ had some interesting data on getting rid of chlorine and
chloramine from water.  You're not the only one who thought
that aeration and boiling would not work with chloramine.


The question is, why did we all think that?  My water co.
just switched last month, and all the literature included
with my bill the last few months talked about how this
switch would improve the taste (I didn't taste chlorine
before) but you could no longer boil away the chlorine
for an aquarium as you could in the past.  Same story
we had heard here in the digest.


So if this information is wrong and letting water sit
overnight or boiling it will drive off chloramine, then
I wasted $25 on a water filter for my sink.

Thanks very much for your HBD response. I should have been a little more
specific on what I meant by "crisp/clean" taste. I was not talking about
budmilloors mega swill, to the contrary I was actually trying to emulate a
60+ IBU IPA brewed by a local Brewery here in Boulder, Colorado. The beer
has a great refreshing hop finish (it is heavily dry hopped) and just
tastes "crisp" and "clean".  I followed the commercial brewers recipe
exactly (same water, grain, hop additions, water treatment etc.) and my
beer tastes less hoppy (bland) and does not have a crisp finish. The
commercial brewer told me to filter my beer - this would remove many of
the bigger molecules and hops that tend to "clog" your palette so that the
hop flavor doesn't get through to your taste buds. I have not confirmed
this yet and wondered if anyone out there had noticed a difference when
filtering. I plan on using a 2 micron filter so as not to produce a "zima"
type beer. I would welcome any advice on filter size, sanitation
techniques and especially on where I could purchase a suitable filter.

I think mead fermentation shares some characteristics of high-alcohol
beer fermentation.  Could you elaborate a bit Dick on some of your points?  


For example, what kinds of yeast are appropriate?  Wyeast has three (I 
think) mead yeasts available.  How are they better than beer yeasts?


what do excessive amounts of nutrients do to the yeast?  Cause too
much growth?  too much fermentation byproducts?


High fermentation temps lead to higher alcohol production, right?
Same as in barleywines fermented too warm.  I think these will somewhat
mellow out with extended aging.  What is the mechanism?  Are they
reduced somehow?


And regarding melomels, I think the distinction needs to be made
between "mellowing" and "blending".  Mellowing refers to the degree
of the flavoring, while blending refers to the balance or mix of the
different flavors present.

I bought a NEW type of expaning foam the other day that, IMHO, beats the

DAP (no affil.) and it's WATER BASED and easy to clean up.  Also, it's
doesn't expand as much, so it's not likely to burst your lid (or whatever).
I am planning to use it on my new Gott.


DAP tex is about a dollar more, but unlike the other stuff, it's a breeze
to clean up and you can reuse it because the nozzle doesn't get hoplessly

Subject: Re:Cleaning Sanke Kegs


Hello HBD Folks:


I have been using Sanke kegs for fermentation now
for over 1 1/2 years. No cutting or holes were
made. Just the top spear was removed. I use a
#10.5 stopper and either a blowoff tube or a 3
piece airlock. At first I used a lot of caustic
and elbow grease. But during the last year I've
developed a technique which involves PBW, Acid
wash, IODOPHOR, and 5 carboy brushes (standard
ones from HB shop) that are shaped differently. My
procedure of cleaning/sanitizing :


1) cold water/hi pressure rinse with a carboy wand
(avail in HB shops)
2) stopper keg. shake and roll all around. drain.
3) hot water/hi pressure rinse
4) repeat step 2
5) repeat 3 and 4
6) add PBW, 2 tablespoons, and hottest water, 1/2
gallon
7) stopper keg, shake and roll
8) use brushes 1-5 (see below). Immerse brush in
liguid in keg and swirl in appropriate place.
9) drain
10) repeat steps 3 and 4
11) add dariy acid rinse. 1 tablespoon and 1/2
gallon hot water.
12) repeat steps 7 thru 10
13) add iodophore and luke warm water for 5
gallons
14) repeat step 7
15) allow at least 1/ 2 hour standing on each
side. repeating step 7 a couple more times.
16) when ready to use, drain well and let dry; or
drain and rinse well w/ hottest water.


Now to the brushes. Each is shaped differently.
Terrible ASCII art follows :


1st brush gets bottom middle (unchanged from HB
shop):
                                //
                                //
oo----------------//


2nd brush gets bottom sides :


                            //
                            //
                            //
oo----------------//


3rd brush gets top corner and used vertically get
most of side wall :


                       //////////
                       //
                       |
oo-------------|


4th brush gets bottom side wall. Brush is totally
straightened, then bent slightly (25deg)


                              /////
oo--------------/////




5th brush gets bottom corners.


oo------------
                     |
                     |       //
                     ---////




I've had good success w/ this method, although it
is time consuming and slightly complicated. But w/
a 15 gallon batch though, it save time over
cleaning three carboys or buckets each brew.


Maybe someone out there in HBD land has a better
idea or method. Please speak up.


Good Brewing!

There have been several posts lately regarding mash tun insulation.
While several of the responses would appear to have very good insulating
characteristics, because of flamability problems and the permanency with
which the insulation is affixed, they just don't appear as a flexible
enough approach for the homebrewer.


I have found a way to insulate my half-barrel SS mash tun that is
inexpensive, flexible, easily available, and quickly removable for heat
application or cleaning. I use a type of alum. coated plastic
bubble-wrap found in almost all home improvement or hardware stores. I
originally went in to buy a water heater jacket but right next to those
was this roll of open stock insulation. Buy the width that is slightly
wider than your mash tun is tall, and get enough in length so that it
wraps 1 1/2 times around the tun.


Next, purchase approx. 7-8 feet of tape backed velcro. Wrap the
insulation around your tun and cut out the appropriate openings for your
plumbing, thermal wells, RIMS, and whatever else you have on your tun,
and you have a mash tun that woll hold it's  temp. to within 1 degree
over a 120 min. mash. The velcro is of course affixed to the end of the
insulation forming a type of [ pattern. The reason for the insulation
going all the way past the top is that if you buy large alum. pizza pan
it will fit perfectly over the top of the tun with the insulation
holding it fairly tightly in place. Also, the hand holds on the top of
the keg are covered with the insulation so the tun is sealed when in
use. Without the top I have found appreciable heat loss to occur.
Finally, the heat loss appears to be constant from an outside temp. from
40 to 95 degrees.


The other question that has come up is the use of Nottingham dry yeast,
whichI would never use for any of my ales, let alone even consider it
for a quasi-lager. I've used Nottingham, especally when I first sterted
brewing because I thought "wow, isn't this great my beer finished 5
points below expected in 2 days". Then I tasted it. Even when fermenting
it a 65-68 degrees, Nottingham makes beer, but IMHO not a very tasty
one. The body was gone, the ester profile was wrong and it had the taste
of many of those brew pub's beers that have been taken over by suits
that really don't care about quality, just the turn around times on
their house product. If you can't use slants or a starter from liquid
yeast, at least try some hydrated Whitbread or Windsor ale yeasts.
Further, I have found some great flavor profiles from using Kolsch yeast
to ferment quasi-lagers at 65 degrees.
Happy Brewing

Subject: cpvc cooler manifold and propane burner wind shield


Hello everyone,


I'm preparing for my first all grain batch and am in the process of building
a manifold for a 5 gal. gott cooler.  This manifold will be an octagon with a
pipe across the center, similar to Ken Schwartz's rectangular copper manifold
pictured on his web site.  My first questions: What are the advantages/
disadvantages of drilling the manifold vs. cutting it with a hacksaw?  Total
area of opening vs opening diameter?


Next: I've seen references for single step infusion mashes with dough-in at 140
degrees farenheit.  Why would this be done instead of just hitting the starch
conversion temperature range of 150-158 degrees?


Third: I have an outdoor propane burner which I plan to use.  I have seen
mention of cutting the bottom off a metal trash can to use as a wind shield/
heat loss preventor around the burner and the kettle.  Does this need to be
propped off the ground to allow air in for combustion?  Should I cut holes in
the sides of the can?  Should the can be flush with the sides of the kettle?
Anyone have experience with this?


These are the questions which I haven't been able to answer through the
archives.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  TIA.

Subject: Bottled Water Analysis


Hi Group,
FYI, I contacted the makers of Sparklett's bottled water here in
Pasadena.  They also market bottled water under the names Alhambra and
Crystal out west here.


The typical mineral analysis of these bottled waters is:
Bicarbonate (HCO3)   5.8 ppm
Calcium                         0.7 ppm
Magnesium                  0.8 ppm
Sulfate (SO4)                3.4 ppm
Total Hardness            5.1 ppm
Alkalinity                      4.0 ppm
pH =               6.8 - 7.2


For the sake of comparison, the mineral numbers from Pilsen are
HCO3                             3 ppm
Calcium                         10 ppm
Mg                                 3 ppm
Sulfate                           4 ppm


 Perhaps AJ or Kenny can take a stab at salt additions to make the two
equate.  If you merely added CaCl2 to increase the calcium to 10 ppm
would that be enough, or would you have to double it to 20 ppm to
account for the bicarbonate (bottled) being nearly double of that for
Pilsen?


Grist for the mill,
John

Hi all
     
     Kevin TenBrink asked about using a garden hose as water supply line for
outdoor brewing. I don't know what a regular garden hose will do to the taste
of your beer. There is an option if you don't want to take chances. Go to an
RV dealer and buy a hose. They sell garden hoses rated for drinking water.
It's been several years since I owned an RV so I can't guesstimate prices but
I remember them being more expensive than regular garden hoses.

Subject: Too much molasses




        With regard to adding too much molasses to a batch of beer, I had
the exact same thing happen to me once.  I also accidently used a FULL cup
of it in a 5 gallon partial mash Oatmeal Stout.  It didn't quite turn out
as I had hoped.  (That's putting it mildly)  I brewed it in September of
95 and every month I'd open a bottle and hope it would mellow out.  I wish
I could describe what it tasted like but the best I can do is call it a
bit of a cidery molasses taste with oatmeal stout undertones.  I think it
would have been quite good had I not dumped in the molasses.  Anyway...I
moved out of that apartment in August of 96 and there was a slight
mellowing by that time but still not up to standards.  I was going to just
dump it when a roommate that was not moving out said, "Just leave it here
and I'll give it more time."  Okay, less for me to move.


        Not more than a week ago I ran into that old roommate and he said
that there was still some of that beer sitting there.  I had completely
forgotten about it.  He said that it had improved quite a bit and another
friend said so as well!!  I was intrigued.  I'm sorry to say that I have
yet to go back to claim any of it but in the interest of brewing science,
I owe it to you to go back and investigate.  I don't know whether you are
willing to let something sit for 2 and a half years but I'll let you know
whether it was worth it.

I am curious about the recent postings concernign mead, and the time it
takes for them to mature. looking back through my records, it has taken
up to 16 months for my meads to finish fermenting and to drop bright and
clear; most take around a year, some dry meads take only up to 6
months.  All of them improve greatly with aging and maturation, up to 12
months in the bottle. I really wonder at recipes that call for a 1 to 3
month fermentation; are my fermentation and maturation times out of line
or unusual? I have had made several good to great batches of mead, but
with only 4 years experience making mead, I have to confess to being a

Subject: Sanke Cleaning


The Sanke dip tube retaining ring can be replaced by a SS Snap Ring.
All you have to have is a snap ring pliers (no more than $5).
The only other issue is finding the SS snap rings.
Several years ago I found a vendor that sold them.
I will check my notes and see if he can be found.
I clean mine by removing the dip tube then inverting the keg over a
piece of 1/2" copper
capped with a 1/4' hole in the top and horizontal slots cut in the sides
of the pipe just below
the cap.. The fluid moving device is an inexpensive submersible pump
(Flow Tech).
At first all the screws either rusted or turned black. I replaced them
all with SS
screws. I use either of the following to clean the kegs.
Caustic Soda, Chlorinated Caustic Soda or PBW. An occasional Phosphoric
Acid wash is also used.
The Chlorinated works best. Its tough to get if your not affiliated with
a Brewery or
Chemical distributor. Final sanitation is also accomplished with the
pump using either
an Iodine based sanitizer or Parasitic Acid. All the while the dip tube
is soaking  first in the Caustic and then the sanitizer. Final assembly
and then the fill.
I also use some other tricks but it takes about 1/2 hour for each, with
my labor about 10 min.

I need some advice from lurking physicists, mech. engineers,

for insulation.  My theory is:  If I build a super-insulated (say 4-6
inches of polystyrene for the walls and ceiling) and sealed box that sit
directly on my concrete basement floor, the interior temperature of the
box will reach equilibrium with the temperature of the concrete floor
(ranges between 55 - 60 oF).   Essentially I will use the concrete floor
as the cooling unit.   Does this sound realistic?  Do I need to
recirculate the air inside the box?  What are your thoughts?

Subject: A rolling stone gathers no wort


In HBD #2658, Dana Edgell asks about anyone having a summary regarding the
past thread on steinbeers.  I don't have a summary, but can tell you that
Chuck Skypeck, the brewmaster at Boscos in Nashville, TN, goes all the way to
Colorado to get red granite to brew his Flaming Stone.  He usually uses the
rocks in the bottom of his kettle as he is bringing the first runnings in.
These rocks have been in the wood fired pizza ovens for most of the evening
the day before he brews, are left in the oven, then the ovens are fired up
again first thing in the early AM when Chuck arrives.  The rocks are then
transferred into the wort in a large stainless basket that Chuck has to lower
with a long climbing rope and harness through the opening of the kettle.  No
small feat, as all of the rocks and stuff probably weigh over 100 pounds.
Most of the rocks are chunks that weigh 10 to 15 pounds each, and do crack
on occasion, but they hold together pretty well from one batch to the next.
I think he brews this beer about once a month, but don't quote me on that, and
replenishes his rock supply each fall when he goes out to GABF in Denver.
Around here, most of our rock is either sandstone or other sedimentary rock
that can't hold up to those kinds of temperatures.

Dear Friends,


In #2658, Mark Swenson asks whether it's true that malt extracts are 
protein deficient.  The big problem with many extracts is their low 
contents of free amino nitrogen (FAN), due in many cases to their 
being produced with substantial non-malt-derived sugars.  For the 
full story on this, one should read Martin Lodahl's summary of some 
Canadian brewing research that was in Brewing Techniques a couple of 
years ago.  Fortunately this article is archived at the BT site, and 
can be accessed at:

Things might have changed some since this was written; anyone know
of any updates?


Hope this helps,

Actually she was incorrect as "mass" refers to an inertial

a kilogram mass in a gravity field equivalent to that at the

*weight*", since a kilogram mass in a zero gravity situation
would not bend the record unless it was being accelerated.I
 have noticed several such transgression on this subject of

Don't argue with me - check your physics books. Besides
if she had really been speaking English she would have
incorrectly said "0.06854 slugs"  {8^)

Subject: Fwd: Sparge Control


Dana Edgell asks about using a swamp cooler float valve for sparge
control.  I don't know about the valves in swamp coolers, but there
are commonly available float valves for watering troughs, etc, that
work just fine.
A plumbing supply shop should have a supply of bronze float valves
in various sizes for about ten bucks.  Another six or seven dollars
will get you a brass threaded rod and a copper float ball.  I have
used this setup to control sparge water addition for several 
batches now.  I used the copper ball because I was concerned that
the standard polyethylene one might melt or soften at mash-out 
temperature.
I attached some tubing to the outlet of the valve, and coil the 
tubing on top of the grain bed.  It wraps about 3/4 of the way 
around the mash tun (converted keg), so the sparge water flows 
inward in a spiral pattern.
This gives much less heat loss than with the former sparge sprinkler
device I was previously using, and the water level maintains itself
within about 3/8 of an inch without any valve fussing.  I love it!
The only drawback is that you can't put a lid over the mash tun to
keep in the heat.  I'm working on a coupling to allow me to use a
truly vertical float, so I can use a lid with a single small hole 
in it.  The ideal approach would probably be a low voltage 
electrical contact (eg two wires) at the liquid level and a 
low-voltage solenoid valve to control the water, but I havn't found
a cheap solenoid valve that can handle up to boiling water....

I am home for break, and last night I finally made it out to the Victory
brewery, for all those who can drive there I strongly recommend it. One of
the coolest pub/restaurants I have ever been to, great atmosphere, great
music, friendly staff, and great prices also. Tuesday nights turned out to
be Pint Night, lucky me. So for 3.00 you got a pint of Dopplebock and you
got to keep the pint glass (which is really cool looking BTW) and after
that refills were only 2.00. Definetly a great deal. As for the Dopplebock
itself. This is a beer that will sneak up on you and knock you on your ass.
I think it was about 8% ABV. They did a great job of making sure the
alcohol content didn't overwhelm the taste of the beer. You can also get
their 6packs and cases at the brewery. 6packs are around 7.00 and cases
were around 24.00. For those who don't know Victory is not just a brewpub,
it is a working micro-brewery with a restaurant attached.

Subject: Iodine/Iodophor??


Collective,
I have purchased a farm product called "Gentle Iodine" hoping to save a few
bucks on sanitizer.  I am not sure if I should be using this or not.  The MSDS
sheet lists the principle hazardous component as iodine at a concentration of
1%.  There is no indication of what the solvent is.  There is no mention of
Lanolin.  The reason I am not sure about using it is that it has a very strong
odor.  Much like rubbing alcohol.  If it had methyl alcohol in it wouldn't
this be listed on the MSDS sheet?  Is the odor just very strong ethyl alcohol?
I would sure like to use this product, but obviously do not want to risk
spoiling beer.  What do you say, wise, experienced ones?  Should I use it as a
sanitizer or should I just save it for future pig and sheep castrations??


Thanks In Advance,

Subject: simple aeration


Hi all,
        Lots of talk lately about wort aeration and sanitizing airstones.  
        I use the holes-in-the-hose method and it works great.  I have
simply drilled small (5/64) holes right through my siphon hose.  You can
watch the air being drawn in in tiny streams of bubbles that mix well with
the wort.  I get a great head on the wort during the transfer.  This is
simple, inexpensive, and easy to sanitize.
        I know that this is not new and has been mentioned before, but it
works so well that I can't believe the amount of work that some people go to
to achieve aeration.
        Keeping it simple but tasty in Almonte, Ontario, Canada,


                                                Bruce Taber
