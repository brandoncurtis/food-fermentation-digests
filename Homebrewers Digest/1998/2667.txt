Subject: Home Brewer's Beer Walk-In Cooler Ideas  -  approx 5' by 6' area


Dear Amateur Brewers,


Can anyone out there shed light on building and cooling a small walk-in 
area in a basement? I live in the Northeast United States and my basement 
does not stay cold enough in the summer to keep my beer "happy."


Here are my initial thoughts:


Instead of buying another refrigerator and temperature controller for my 
cases of homebrew, kegs and commercial beers obtained from near and far, I 
would like to build a small area in my basement about the size of a walk in 
closet. The temperature would be maintained at about 50 to 55 degrees F.


Having this space would keep my homebrew away from warm summer basement 
temperatures, would protect my special imported beers from the heat, and 
allow me to serve kegs of ale using a shank and tap installed through the 
wall, and over a sink. Lagers would still be served from my serving fridge 
at 45 degrees.


Question: If I build a well insulated space of about 5 feet by 6 feet 
(floor to ceiling height), what are the considerations regarding cooling it 
to 50 --55 degrees year-round? For example, can I just use a "window unit" 
air conditioner for this? Do they go down that low? Can I easily modify the 
thermostat or should I use my temperature controller that I use on my 
fermentation fridge? Can I vent it in the basement or does it need to be 
vented outside? Should I try to vent to the basement in winter (to help 
heat the house) and vent to outside in summer (to contribute to the global 
warming situation :^)


I have heard of the wine cellar cooling units that control air temperature 
and humidity, but they are quite expensive. If I rarely open the door to 
this area, could I use one of my existing refrigerators to cool the entire 
area or is this asking too much?


Anyone have any experience building and using a home beer walk-in cooler? 
Thanks in advance for the help!


Randy

  I don't know how far your club wants to go for malt but Westcan Malting
in Alix, Alberta, Canada sells to home brewers, micros, and large breweries
in Canada, USA, South America, and Japan.  Locally we can buy a 50Kg bag.
Export may be a minimum of a container.  Check http://www.westcanmalt.com
They have a single product, a pale malt (1.7) Harrington 2-row, protein 10.5%

  Valley Brewing Equipment, in a brochure, write about using the mill at

seen use a GE gear moter (170RPM) direct connected via a rubber coupling
to the shaft.  I got the gear motor from SURPLUS CENTER `at`800-488-3407.
The part number is 5-1098 and it was $25US+shipping.

     Hi all,
     
     Kirk asked why his all-grain beers have been suffering from chill haze 
     while his extract ones did not.  He mentions that his thermometer was 
     reading 10F too low.  He also wonders why he achieved starch 
     conversion if he was mashing so much hotter than recommended.
     
     First, he achieved conversion because alpha-amylase is good up to 168F 
     (75C) or so.  Mash out doesn't denature it, contrary to what most 
     (all?) homebrew texts state.  Of course, because beta-amylase only has 
     a 10 min. life span at 158F (70C), worts made at this temp will be 
     highly unfermentable.  A good mash schedule for a lactose-free sweet 
     stout!
     
     Why are the beers hazy?  Well, my guess is that it isn't chill haze, 
     but starch haze.  Since Kirk's thermometer was off by 10F, he was 
     mashing out at 178-180F (81C) instead of 168-170 (75C).  That could 
     cause unconverted starch trapped in the steely tips to be released, 
     with not enough amylase around to convert it.  Beer with a permanent 
     starch haze would be the result.  As a test you could do an iodine 
     test to the mash after a 180F mash out (or you could just not do a 
     180F mash out...).
     
     Are you sure the haze is only present in cold beer, or is it just 
     worse when it is cold?
     --------------------------------
     Sam Mize talks about all sorts of stuff.  He asks about my post in 
     which I mention that, according to Kunze, it is protein degradation 
     products that cause chill haze.  Sam postulates that these would also 
     be broken up by a protein rest, and therefore help reduce haze.
     
     If a protein rest is done at a low enough temperature, and for enough 
     time, than yes, you can achieve a significant amount of large and 
     small protein degradation.  You will also end up with thin, headless 
     beer!
     
     That is one danger of doing a protein rest at all with modern malts; 
     they are already well-modified enough to not need a rest between 
     113-135F (45-57C).  Of course, if you use Munton's malt, like I did, 
     you'll want to ADD protein to the wort...perhaps a good time to try 
     that old "cock ale" recipe...
     
     Sam also asks about the taste of chlorophenols.  Within the past month 
     AJ and I posted a discussion about the flavors of different phenolic 
     compounds.  Search the archives for details.
     
     In summary, everybody has the potential to taste chemicals in a 
     different way from the person next to them.  At Siebel we were doing a 
     fair amount of "spiked beer" tastings.  The chlorophenol I tasted 
     (ortho-chloro-phenol) smelled like a swimming pool at 8 ppb.  AJ has 
     smelled other chlorinated phenols that are medicinal (to him). 
     -------------------------------
     Norm responds to my post about Munton's Marris Otter malt.  I think 
     some people may be a bit confused, so I'll clarify myself:
     
     Marris Otter is a strain of barley.  My post in NO way meant that all 
     Marris Otter malt is bad.  It is, in fact, a fine barley that can 
     produce exceptional malt.  I have used Crisp malting's Marris Otter 
     with nothing but wonderful results.
     
     Malt modification is much more a function of how the maltster treated 
     it.  Different varieties need to be treated differently, but many 
     barleys are capable of becoming fine malt when handled correctly.
     
     My complaint is with the maltster, MUNTON.  They are the one's who are 
     at fault here for producing crap and sending it here rather than 
     feeding it to some mad cow off in an English field somewhere...
     
     By the way, I called the Northeast sales rep for Munton, and he said 
     that Marris Otter will soon disappear from English farms.  That is 
     quite sad...
     
     Have fun!

Subject: RIMS Construction/Mash Stirrer




        Good Morning, HBD!
     
        I've brewed a few all-grain, and many partial mash batches, and 
     I've been happy with the results.  However, I still have problems with 
     mashing:  Mashing-in & reaching the correct initial temp; Maintaining 
     & changing the mash temp.
        For partial mashes, I follow the suggestions of the boys at the 
     Seven Barrel Brewery, and use my oven to maintain the desired mash 
     temp.  This works out pretty well, but your ordinary, run-of-the-mill 
     oven isn't designed or intended to maintain such low temps (100-170 
     deg F).  So, I'm looking for new & exciting ways to brew all-grain 
     batches!
        The Jan/Feb '98 issue of Brewing Techniques Magazine explores the 
     debate between infusion & decoction mashing.  They go on to give 
     detailed explanations of each technique.  The idea of constructing my 
     own RIMS intrigues me immensely!  
        The article lists a bunch of RIMS related web sites and possible 
     sources for RIMS related hardware/components.  To say the least, I've 
     been doing a lot of surfing and research the past few weeks!  
     Fascinating!!  And I'd like to thank all of those individuals who were 
     kind enough to provide info about their own RIMS on the web.
        So, my first question is, about how much cash are we talking about 
     for setting up just the one vessel, converted to the actual RIMS?  The 
     rest of the system can be added on piece by piece, correct?
        Secondly, are there any discernible advantages to incorporating a 
     mash stirring paddle into the RIMS?  I can remember encountering only 
     one such system, and it was offered for sale by a professional outfit. 
      I don't remember seeing a paddle on any homegrown RIMS.
        Well, any tips/tricks/advice/info would be greatly appreciated!

While it's true that oxidation of polyphenols can lead to
phenolic/plastic taste, a much more likely culprit is
a mild wild yeast infection.  Many wild yeasts are producers
of plastic/clovey aromas and flavours.


As for this priming method, it is far less precise than
bulk priming.  The old method of priming was to put
granular sugar (undissolved) into each bottle.  This
technique is pretty much no longer used among mainstream
US homebrewers (although I've seen some ads for granular
sugar-measurers in Australia).  Gentle racking is not
much more likely to cause oxidation than pouring primings
into the bottles.  And since I really can't recall the last
time I had any oxidation comments from judges on any of my
beers (even year-old normal-gravity beers and multi-year
Barleywines), I tend to believe that my methodology (see
two or three HBDs ago) is sound.

How quickly we forget.  Please see Andy Walsh's magnificent
post in HBD #2584 for the methodology and other background
information, but here's the bottom line on Clinitest:


   Clinitest reads low for the major sugars left after fermentation.
   Maltotriose typically forms 10% of wort gravity in an all malt wort. eg.
   1.050 wort has ~5 SG points of maltotriose.The lowest measure on Clinitest
   is 0.25%, corresponding to about 4SG points of maltotriose as being the
   minimum resolution for this sugar. One of the most common fermentation
   disorders is an inability to ferment this sugar. Clinitest will not
   normally detect this. In addition, as one does not know the final sugar
   composition, a reading on Clinitest of 0.25% could mean very different
   things since it does not measure the different sugars to the same degree of
   accuracy.
 
   Conclusion - Clinitest does not give an accurate portrayal of final sugar
   concentrations. It may be useful as a general fermentation indicator, but I
   won't rush out to buy one. However, if you want a glucose monitor, Diastix
   are great! Anybody know how to measure maltotriose?

I believe that the benefit of a continuous sparge (aka fly sparging) over
a batch sparge (where the grain bed is drained, then refilled, then drained,
etc.) is that there will always be some trapped wort in the grain bed.  If
you batch sparge, the gravity of the wort trapped will be equal to the
gravity of the last draining.  In a fly sparge, you (theoretically) have
lower gravity runnings remaining trapped in the grain bed when you stop.
Frankly, it's all theoretical and if you have a system in which there is a
lot of chaneling, batch sparging will be *more* efficient than fly sparging.

I once made a batch from *two* Brewferm Kriek kits.  I followed the
directions except that I used two cans of extract rather than the one
plus corn sugar recommended in the instructions.  The resulting beer
was faintly a cherry beer with nothing near the sourness of a true
Kriek Lambic.  To make these kits taste more authentic... I recommend
that you buy much less expensive domestic wheat extract (yes, I know
that true Lambics are made with raw wheat, but we're talking extract
here) get some Brettanomyces yeast and Lactobacillus bacteria from
either Yeast Lab, The Yeast Culture Kit Company, Head Start Brewing
Cultures or (as a last resort) Wyeast and add your own cherries after
a year in the primary.  It will also help join the Lambic Digest and
to read its back issues.

Not exactly.  Once the alcohol level begins to get substantial, oxygen
will oxidise the alcohols to aldehydes, but early in the fermentation,
oxygen will primarily increase the diacetyl in the finished beer.  See
the photo tour of The Old Brewery - Tadcaster on my website for a
pretty graphic example of fermenting wort oxidation!

My gut feeling is that it is *theoretically* detrimental (because
the products of saccharification actually impede the action of the
enzymes and crystal malts will simply add more of these products),
HOWEVER, in practice, I don't think that the difference would be
tasteable.  Note also, that if you have very high-bicarbonate (i.e.
high alkalinity) water and you are making a dark beer, the dark
grains will lower the pH into a more reasonable range (one that
favours the enzymes and also reduces polyphenol extraction).  On the
other hand, if you have very low alkalinity water, adding dark
grains could lower the pH too much and interfere with the action
of the enzymes.  In other words... it depends on your water and
your recipe.

Another interesting point regarding cancer and alcohol:


Now, this does not pertain to beer but:


A recent 30 year study of 35,000 French men who drank
three glasses of wine a day, had no cancer what-so-ever,
even if they smoked... Anything over three glasses and they
had problems with their livers, anything under three glasses
and the effects were greatly diminished.


Prost!

*** Scientists Say Hops May Help Prevent Cancer ***


Corvallis, OR - According to Oregon State University researchers,
*xanthohumol,* a compound commonly found in hop plants, is toxic to
cancer
cells and may actually help protect humans from the deadly disease. The
University*s studies indicate that the compound, known as a *flavonoid,*
inhibits an enzyme called *cytochrome P450,* which is known to activate
the
cancer process in cells. Researchers also reported that some flavonoids
enhance the effectiveness of enzymes called *quinone reductase,* that can
block active cancer-causing substances already at work in the body. Lead
researcher Donald Buhler, an agricultural chemist, cautioned reporters at
the
press conference where his team*s research was announced, that these
findings
should not be used to endorse more beer consumption. He said if the
results of
the study pan out, scientists may be able to make the compound available
in
pills or other concentrated forms. Make mine a Sierra Nevada Bigfoot and

Lots of good info including what you're after. BTW, I just have to get in a

in several different styles, from pales to porters, and it works great. Not to

gravity. If a higher TG is needed, I steep dextrinous (is that a word?)
specialty
malts or do a 155-158 degree partial mash.

A couple of things to look into. How clean are your faucets? Beer faucets
need to be cleaned regularly. It is amazing at how much crap accumulates in
your faucets in a short amount of time.  If your faucets are clean, look at
every inch of your draft system for burrs or other edges that could be
providing nucleation sites and causing foaming. Specifically, I'd look at
your dip tube (especially the top, near the poppet), the poppet, the tank
plug, and all of your tubing to fitting connections. Assuming that
overcarbonated beer is not the problem, it is usually dirty draft equipment
or damaged draft equipment which causes foaming problems.


You might consult the back of the rapids catalog (assuming that you haven't
already) for tubing specifics to set up your system. I think that you are
supposed to shoot for a pressure at the tap of only 2-3 psi. Based on the
fact that the length and diameter of the tubing cause the pressure to drop
from the keg to tap (longer and narrower tubing cause more drag on the
liquid flow and cause more of a pressure drop; some types of plastics cause
more drag than others) you should calculate your tubing length based on
your normal keg pressure in order to get down to the required pressure at
the tap. Most draft systems use 5/8" lines until the last couple of feet
and then drop down to 3/16" to the tap shank.


Good luck; been there done that ;(

As I see it, not stirring would would lead to statification in the
priming bucket, and
therefore different levels of priming sugar in bottled beer.
Although I've only been
brewing for a little over 3 years now,  the technique I use has
never given me
any problems.


I start to transfer beer to my priming bucket (gently to prevent
aeration)
with the tubing at an angle to impart a swirling current
(whirlpool?).  About the time
1/2 to 1 gal of beer is in the bucket, I  add my priming solution
(plus any finings) by gently
pouring down/along my brewing paddle (it may be the only thing I
remember from
high school chemistry).  After the rest of the beer has been
transfered I give a gentle stir
or 2, wait a couple of minutes, then start bottling.  Works every
time.

Subject: Wyeast XL and Starters


John (& the collective);


I read with interest your post to HBD about the Palexperiment.


Kudo's to Dave Logsdon for providing the yeast.  However, I would caution
you that the XL packs, while containing significantly more yeast than the
50 ml smack packs, do not seem to contain sufficient yeast to meet the 
1x10^6 cells per ml per deg plato pitching rate many of us try to acheive.


When the XL packs first appeared in a our local HB shop, a few of us tried
side-by-side comparisions of XL pitched directly versus using a starter.
In all cases the XL packs pitched directly had 12-16 hour lags versus 2-6
hour lags using 2 to 3 liter starters. (When using the starters, we
decanted the spent wort first and only pitched the slurry). Certainly
12-16 hours is better than 24-36 hours, but I feel 2-6 hours is even
better and easily acheivable.  All yeast was about 1 month old, based on
the embossed date on the smack pack.


Now, the XL packs do offer the advantage that one may skip the 50 ml to
500 ml step-up (10:1 increase) and pitch the XL pack directly into a
larger volume of starter wort. That to me makes the XL worth the extra
buck.  Not all  Wyeast varieties are available in the XL size.


My friend Jim Liddil may disagree with me about Wyeast, but I still prefer
their products over others on the market.  I don't have the time, space or
inclination to to be much of a yeast rancher, starting at the slant level.
With Wyeast when the pack swells, I know I'm good to go.  With the "vial
yeasts", I don't have any idea.


Just my $.02 worth.  Good luck with the Palexperiment.  I'm looking
forward to reading the results.

I would have thought with all that Arcadian (Cajun) influence
it would be pronounced as "crayfish" in Louisiana and
surrounds. In SE Ohio where I grew up we said both. Then
we also said "snake feeder" and "dragonfly" for the same bug.

Actually, this is exactly how porter was developed. In the days before
its creation, many pub patrons would order an "entire." This was a
beer comprised of a mix of the house beers, typically something
lighter (relatively speaking -- pale malts and therefore pale beers
hadn't been developed yet) and somthing darker, and often with the
addition of some old or stock ale. Needless to say, publicans found it
a bit of a hassle to mix up pint after pint of entire.


That is why a London brewer whose name escapes me (my references are
at home and I'm not) at the moment set out to create a beer that would
replicate the appearance and flavor of porter, allowing publicans to
serve from one cask instead of several. This beer came to be known as
porter, possibly due to the fondness among men of that occupation for
the beer.


Porter was made at varying strengths, the strongest of which was
sometimes called "stout porter." As time went by, the strong version
of porter came to be more popular and, as Wayne mentioned, the
"porter" part of the name was dropped. Eventually, porter was pretty
much dropped as well (Guiness, which started out as a porter brewery,
kept making one until the 1970s). The style was revived by the
microbrewery movement and has since become a very popular style again.


For more information on this wonderful style, you can check out
Michael Jackson's Beer Companion, Ray Daniels' "Designing Great Beers"
or the Classic Styles Series book on porter.

Subject: Repositionable labels/Jim's filtering comments


HBDers -


I wanted to thank Jim for seeking out what appears to be a decent
alternative to labeling beer.  I've always found it a PIA to put a coded
sticker on the top of each bottle.  I know what it means, but my guests
don't.  "Say Chas, whats a SZB? Or a APA, or..." you know what I mean.  One
question though, how did the ink-jet perform.  I attempted to make labels
with this kind of printer before, but found them to bleed ALOT.  Is the
label made for injets, like the toothed tranparancies?


Also, just one comment on Jim's filtering observation.  I too found that
filtering will *clean* up the flavor of lighter beers quickly, but I also
found that this effect is temporary.  Given sufficient time (talking many
weeks here), I found my unfiltered beers to be as clear as the filtered
ones.  The only difference was a slight reduction in bitterness in the
filtered product.  I do admit to using polyclar for unfiltered homebrew.
I might be interesting if AJ had keep a bottle or two unfiltered and
compared the filtered/unfiltered beers for clarity and flavor.  I just want
to warn those those embarking on the filtering journey -- its relatively
expensive for both your pocketbook and more importantly time.


Of course this kind of thinking does not apply well in the commercial
environment where speed is of the essence.

The base part of these are probably the same thing (the major plastic
piece). The party pigs come in two flavors: ones set up for refill and
the other not.


the ones set up for refill have a bolted down head piece whereas the
ones not mean for refill have a head piece that is held together with a
crimped part. Much cheaper. Without the right equipment, you can't get
these to work at home.


I'm sure that if these things were not meant to come back to the brewery
for refill that they would be putting them out in the crimp style since
the cost differential is significant.

I had wondered where one could find Ringwood yeast for homebrewing, as
