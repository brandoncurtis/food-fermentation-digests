Subject: Bottling tanks & primings/decoction efficiency/protein rests


     Hi all,
     


     The annual "poor mix in the bottling tank" question has bloomed 


     recently, so I'll post something that I wrote a while back.
     


     My friend Bill Coleman gave me this idea:  Corny kegs are the 
perfect 


     bottling tanks!  Although I keg and counter-pressure bottle most of 
my 


     beers, there are a few styles that I believe taste much better when 


     bottle conditioned (HefeWeizen being one of them).
     


     The best method I have found to bottle beer in a sanitary and 


     oxygen-free manner is to use a corny keg as the bottling tank.
     


     Sanitize your keg (I take mine apart EVERY time, and boil all the 


     small parts.  I then scrub the keg, rinse it, iodophor it, then 
rinse 


     it with boiled water).  Reassemble the keg and purge it with CO2 
(this 


     is best done by filling the tank with sterile water and pushing it 
out 


     with CO2 pressure, but pressurizing/depressurizing/repeat works a 
bit, 


     too).
     


     Sterilize all your keg fittings (I have found that the plastic 
liquid 


     and gas fittings CAN be boiled!) and tubing (which can also be 


     boiled).
     


     Open the keg, put in your priming syrup (wort, sugar-syrup, Kr
usen, 


     whatever) and seal the keg.  Attach the liquid-out fitting and the 
CO2 


     fitting.  Run a hose from your fermenter to the liquid-out fitting 


     (secure with a clamp to avoid air pickup).  Transfer the young beer 
to 


     the keg.  DON'T START A SIPHON BY ATTACHING A HOSE TO THE GAS 
FITTING 


     ON THE KEG AND SUCKING:  you will end up with a lungful of CO2.  It 
is 


     painful and dangerous to inhale!
     


     I push beer out of fermenters by using CO2 pressure.  Fit a two-hole
 


     orange carboy cap to the fermenter.  Put the racking cane in one 
hole, 


     and GENTLY blow CO2 into the other hole.  Once beer starts to flow I
 


     let gravity take over.  1-5 psi is all you need.  Don't clamp the 


     carboy cap to the carboy; if the pressure gets too high it will act 
as 


     a safety valve and pop off.
     


     Once the keg is full, remove the liquid fitting, purge the head 
space 


     with CO2 (just in case), apply enough pressure to seal the keg and 


     shake the heck out of it.  You have now thoroughly mixed your Speise
 


     (primings) into the beer in a most sanitary and anaerobic manner!
     


     Now just reconnect the liquid-out fitting and attach the hose to 
your 


     bottle-filling device.  Fill the bottles, pushing the beer with 1-5 


     psi of CO2.
     


     The real beauty of this system is if you want to bottle part of a 


     large batch and keg the other part.  Simply fill your bottles, then 


     refill the keg, and either fill more bottles or seal the keg!  You 


     only have to sanitize all the equipment once to both bottle and keg!


     


     I hope all that was clear...
     


     Priming the entire batch at one time (like most people do) is FAR 


     superior to adding primings to each individual bottle.  Adding 


     primings to each bottle is a sure way to spend a *lot* of time 


     screwing up your beer!  It is likely that you will have noticeable 


     variation in the carbonation from bottle to bottle (because of 
errors 


     adding primings), and sanitation is much more difficult to maintain.


     -----------------------------
     Capt. Mark mentions that his mash efficiency increased tremendously 


     after switching mills and decoction mashing.  He was wondering if 
the 


     decoction could be responsible for the increase.
     


     I have, on a number of occasions, measured the wort gravity before 
and 


     after a decoction.  It never is all that different (max. ~3% 
higher).  


     That is a testament to the fact that today's malts are 
well-modified.  


     I have done this using all kinds of malts (pale ale, Pilsner, 


     Munich...).
     


     The new mill is much more likely to be responsible for such a large 


     increase in efficiency.
     ----------------------------
     Kyle is still confused about protein rests.  He had believed that a 


     consensus was reached.
     


     No it wasn't!  I don't think it will be, either.  There are so many 


     homebrewing books and older texts that talk about under-modified 
malts 


     needing a p-rest that this will never go away.  My _opinion_, at the
 


     moment, is that they are unnecessary; modern malts all seem to be 


     quite well-modified.  Others are free to think differently, and I 


     reserve the right to change my opinion when presented with new info!


     


     If you are still confused about the need for a protein rest, join 
the 


     club!  I like Al K's attitude toward stuff like this:  try brewing 
the 


     same recipe twice; once with a p-rest, once without.  See which you 


     like better.  Simple!
     


     Have fun!

The little bit I know about PH meters is what I information I have
gathered by reading everything I can find about them.  I also have
purchased a couple and am using my second one now.


What I can discern is that you need to think about the PH probe as a
battery - that is,  it wears out,  gets used up,  does not last forever,
ages, etc..  This is also the reason you should calibrate it before use.
  
It's apparently a fact of PH probe karma that they just are not
permanent.  Now,  the useful life can be affected by how you treat the
probe,  rinse it in distilled water,  keep the glass membrane wetted as
much as possible and other obfuscated rules.


I tried the papers and decided they were a joke.  (Besides, I am
partially colorblind)


The way you decide if your probe is any good is to use a calibrating
solution, one at PH 7.0, and the other at the higher or lower end of the
range (4.0 or 10.0) that you will be reading.   The solutions have
buffers in them (this means they are reluctant to change PH and can be
used as calibrating solutions)  I have purchased the newest meter from
Omega for $35 dollars, but they charged me for shipping & handling $7.xx
or so, can't remember.  Seems high,  wonder if they fondled it or what.
I haven't used it long enough to find out how long it will last, but it
seems well made and has calibration adjustments,  so I would not pay
this much for a meter that could not be calibrated,  however the
accuracy once calibrated should be good enough to use for homebrewing.


All the probe life comments I have read say you can reasonable expect 6
months to a year,  more if you are lucky.

Subject: Maximizing Hop Aroma


Making a standard American Pale Ale, given an ounce of Cascade hops (whole 
cones), which of the following 3 methods should result in the most hop 
aroma? I've been experiencing loss of aroma characteristics also (great at 2 
weeks old, weak at 6 weeks old - in the keg). Is this due to the method used 
to produce the aroma in the first place?


1. Late addition, last 10 minutes of boil.
2. Knockout, then steep in hot wort for 10 minutes
3. Dry Hop for 10 days in secondary.


Or is there another secret? Which method both maximizes aroma and also 
produces a stable aroma that wont disappear after a few weeks in the keg?

Don - there are a few reasons extract beer come out dark - and yes,
carmalizing the sugars is one.  This is partly due to the fact that you
are only boiling a small portion of wort.  Try getting a larger pot and
boiling as much water with the extract that you can. This will help
lighten the color

George - im trying to remember this from the top of my head. I think you
way overcarbonated your beer.  At 40 degrees, you need only about 6 lb
pressure to produce 1.9 or so volumes.  This is even a little high for
English bitter.  Unhook the keg ans -slowley- bleed off the presure to
flatten the beer a little.  This takes time so patience..

Hi all,
Amazing all the replies I got over my post about mudbugs. If your ever
in Shreveport La. give me a call and we'll wip up a pot of them critters
and I usually have at least a couple varieties of Dilla Brew on tap.
Like most I could talk about brewing for hours. A question: I made a
Scottish Ale the other day and stepped up the yeast to a half-gallon to
be split among two carboys. Well I only came up with about 8.5-9.0
gallons and instead of decanting off most of the liquid from my starter
dumped most of it into the short carboy. Needless to say it went nuts.
It had activety in less than an hour and proceeded to turn a muddy
lookin mess. It appeared to ferment out in about 36 hours. After four
days its beginning to clear up somewhat but was wondering what effects
this could have on the finished product.

Subject: Jake & other on pH and temp


Jake and others mentioned pH meters, ATC, temperature and refractormeters.
The life of an electrode at ambient temp is 1 to 3 years, at 90c (194f) it
is less than 4 months, at 120c (248f) the electrode will only last one
month.   This is why when buying a pH meter a detachable electrode along
with quality is important.  Hanna's, Checker 2 and 3 will withstand temp of
80c (176f).  The Checker 1 is rated at 50c (122f).  Jake replace the
electrode with HI1207 or 1208 priced at $28.00.  The Checker 1 is a good
meter.  These meters (2 and 3) sell for $54.90. The Piccolo Plus has ATC and
is rated at 70c+. This meter sells for $155 and the electrode is amplified.
The imported refractometer we have available needs a drop of liquid to test
SG and by the time the drop is placed on the window it is usually at ambient
temperatures and is not an issue. The price is $90 bucks and the meter is
imported from China. US models sell for $300 plus.

DonaldS107 <DonaldS107`at`aol.com> asks:


> Why is my beer so dark?


Canned extract is notorious for yielding copper or darker
colors, especially if it's old (and you can bet the imports
are).  Unfortunately, dry extract can also give you darker
brews, even though it keeps better.


I have always had great luck with Alexanders Pale (syrup)
malt extract which is sold around here in barrier bags or BYO Bucket.
I would avoid the cans, but that's a luxury I have being less
than a hour's drive from the factory.


I have also found that I can get a much lighter brew since
I switched to full wort volume boils.  For reasons that perhaps
the chemists among us know (I'm an EE, 'nuff said) boiling
your extract in only a gallon or two of water darkens the mixture
more than if you can use 6 gallons or so.  I have brewed some
beautiful pale lagers (and ales) using only Alexanders and
plenty of water.
***********************************************************
SPICY MUDBUGS
Despite Don's clarification, I always thought these were
CRAWDADS.  By any other name, they still sound good,
and I wish I knew where to get a mess of 'em out here
on the left coast.
***********************************************************


I'm relatively new to all-grain (just bought my MM and a sack
of UK pale malt (hope it wasn't one of the crappy ones))
and having lots of fun getting my extraction and yields
within 25% of predicted.  Im sure I just need practice and
good record-keeping.


My question though, is about batch-sparging and no-sparging.
With these methods, is it necessary to throttle the sparge
flows down to ~1 hour for 6.5 gallons, or can I let it run
full speed?  It seems intuitive, but I'm in no hurry to replicate
my first batch where I screwed up and got 1.032 out of 10
pounds of grain.


Thanks all,
Randy in Modesto

There has been a lot of good commentary on the use of lactic acid in
Berliners, what about the use of lactic acid (what a lot of us use to
acidify our sparge water) in stouts for the Guinness "tang" ?


Anyone tried this and have a good feel for the amount needed in a 5 gallon
batch to add just the right taste?


I know, I know, Guinness gets their tang from lactic-soured and then
pasteurized beer, but what if we want to keep it simple?

Not to sound like a jerk, why not just keg? This is one of the minor
reasons why I(and I think some brewers) switch over to kegging.
What I used to do was to use some Elmer's water based, pliable,
water-soluble, washable glue. It was in a clear plastic bottle,
but the glue was blue (NOT THE WHITE STUFF!!!). It is water soluble,
so soaking in plain water removed the label easily. I printed out
the label on my printer, whacked it up with an x-acto or scissors,
applied a few drops of this glue in the corners, spread it around
a little bit and voila, instant label! Takes a little longer, but
then you can have a custom label shape, a neck ring etc.......

With the Checker 1, and other meters that do not have a temperature probe,
the pH of the sample is read at room temperature.  I think you need to do
the same with pH papers.  For better instructions than printed on the box
of the checker 1 visit http://www.hannainst.com/products/electro.elecguid.htm
(electrode maintenance and use).  I used a checker 1 for a year, did not
brew for 1.5 years and then had lots of problems with the meter.  I too 
probably needed a new probe but decided to buy a Hanna 8424 with temperature
compensation, instead.

A dunkel should be made with mostly munich malt, which in fact IS a pale ale 
malt for all intents. Its kilned at a higher temperature (andl longer) 
giving it more melanoidin content and a bit darker color. Try to get what's

Subject: bleach & metals


Sodium Hypochlorite (liquid bleach) is a basically unstable ompound. 
Its kinda like salt water with a chlorine atom temporarily crammed into
it.  This instability is why its such a good cleaner (along with the
fact the chlorine will react more readily with more stuff than just
about anything on the planet; right up there with oxygen).  The chlorine
is somewhat stabilized in the solution by a high pH.


Sodium hypochlorite will break down all on its own into salt water, and
chlorine gas.  Normally this happens so slowly you never notice.  Heat
will speed it up.  Metals (especially nickel, iron, and copper) are
really big catalyst for degradation too.  Like all catalysts, they don't
really take part in the reaction.  They merely "inspire" if you will. 
Therefore, bleach solutions will not directly harm your stainless steel
or your copper cooler.


I did say directly, didn't I?   If you leave them soaking for long
periods, you will really be soaking in the leftover degradation
products;  salt water.  So go ahead and wash;  hypochlorite kills most
micro' organisms very rapidly.   Just don't soak.

I have an ale yeast of unknown source that is not fermenting 1.050
starters made with it below 1.022.  The only culture I have is at the
bottom of a bottle of barleywine, which is the cause of the fermenting
problem.  Pale ales I have made with this yeast in the past fermented
nicely down to around 1.010, and I don't recall the yeast wimping out
even with dredge re-pitching occasionally.


The barleywine on top of this yeast is quite nice and I would like to
brew it again, but I would need to get the yeast back into shape before
doing this.  What are the procedures available (if any) to do this?

Subject: More converting kegs info




I just got to the Tuesday HBD and read Dave Draper's post.


"In #2662, Steve Rockey asks for some tips on converting kegs to
boilers.  I'll shamelessly plug my friend Eric Schoville's page on
his 3-tier system, which gives very full descriptions of what he did
and has a host of links to other folks' web pages on similar
conversions.  Taken together, they ought to cover nearly all the
bases.  Eric's URL is:


http://home1.gte.net/rschovil/beer/3tier.html"


Dave you are right, Eric covers almost everything and his is a great
source. The method I use has been mentioned only in passing by one site. I
don't want to take anything away from Eric or the others he cites but my
preferred method is to use an angle grinder to cut the top out of a keg.
The advantages that I see are: it is faster than other methods (15
minutes), safer (no broken blades), easier to clean up the inside of the
keg, quieter, and I don't have to pay someone else to do the work. I have
found that the local Home Depot has thin metal cutting blades for circular
saws, 7" metal abrasive blade by DeWalt, that work great on the angle
grinder after I remove the safety guard (OOPS, there goes my safety
argument!). 


Because I like to tinker and tweak the system, I also like to have
removable drains and valves rather than welded on parts so I drill holes
for these and attach them with gaskets and bulkhead like fittings.


Thanks for all your posts in the HBD and those of the many other experts
out there. Because of all the generously shared wisdom, people like me are
able to move from kit brewing to all grain brewing with less than a year's
experience. Some day I too will be making consistently good beer with a
little help from my friends.

125 RPM). I also came up a little light on my starting gravity. I'm

Bairds or Muntons which I'm used to, they suggested I use Chariot
instead. Going against their recommendation I figured the extra $2.00 a
sack should get me a higher quality product. Now I'm wondering if I

Another way to look at this is that Clinitest will detect fermentation
of the other 90% of your wort sugars.  If your yeast will not ferment
the remaining 10% then what can you do about it?  Seems that knowing
something about that 90% is much better than knowing nothing at all,
which is what the hydrometer tells you.  If Clinistest measures out at <
1/4%, and you still have remaining maltotriose, then you are probably
done anyway!  What am I missing here?  Still waiting for one of our
pointy headed HBDers to come of with that maltotriose test...

Lindemans, etc., but do not particularly like them.  Guess my beer
tastes are just not sophistocated enough to to really enjoy the smell
of  barnyard in my beer.  I realize the Belgians go at great lengths to
make these beers, but I'll take a German Lager over 'em any day!  Anyone

For those of you looking for a label that can easily be removed, you might

Although they are designed for a laser printer, they run great in an ink

Subject: Williams Mashing System


Steve Krause asked about others experiences with the Williams Mashing
System. I've had this system for a year and a half and love it. It moved me
from extract to all-grain brewing for a modest expense and has improved the
quality of my ales tremendously. It's the best single purchase I've made
for brewing. 


Just a couple of tips for using the system:
Keep it clean! Even though you'll boil everything that comes out of the
system, it takes just a few minutes to rinse everything with water right
after you finish sparging. The false bottom tends to get cracked barley
caught in it, which can get kinda mildewy looking if you store it for a few
weeks. I use a long bamboo skewer stick to poke out the crud an hour or so
after brewing. 


Keep those little parts! The little plastic thumbscrew that holds the false
bottom in place is easily lost and not so easily replaced. Williams puts an
extra one with the kit, but lose both and you're screwed. I always put the
little buggers back on the base after removing the false bottom. There are
also small rubbery inserts to the metal sparger-sprayer that don't seem to
stay put. If one of them falls out in your mash, you'll have a heck of a
time finding it and your sparger won't function properly. Really jam those
babies in the metal ends and keep your careful eye on them when you
assemble and disassemble your system on brewing day.  


Steve, I think you'll really like your gift. It's a very good system and
should make your beers better.

Subject: Marris Otter; Malt quality


Greetings, 


Regarding the recent discussion on Marris Otter malt ...


First, it should be noted that Marris Otter is a variety of barley that
is malted by various firms.  Apparently, one malting firm has dumped
some inferior product on the U.S. market.  However, some malts made from
Marris Otter barley have good reputations and are currently used by
Adnams, Brakspear's, Cain's, and Young's -- all reputable English
brewers.  Marris Otter malt is also used by the Scotch Whisky industry,
in particular by Glengoyne and Macallan.  (M. Jackson, 1995 "A Trend
that goes against the grain", Malt Advocate, Summer 1995;
http://realbeer.com/maltadvocate/ ).


Regarding the recent discussion on malt quality available to homebrewers
 ...


My experience here in Syracuse is very different from that described by
many.  In fact, the very same malts that are used by the local
microbrewery (M&F Pale Ale Malt; Middle Ages) and the local brewpub
(various Briess malts; Empire Brewpub) are available in my local
homebrew shop.  Moreover, the shopkeeper tells me that he now has more
malt varieties available than ever before.  He attributes this to the
increase in numbers of brewpubs and microbreweries, which increases
demand for different varieties of malt. 


I look forward to hearing about the situation in other parts of the
country (or world).


Cheerio!

Well, growing up in Kansas, we called them "crawdads" or
"crawdaddys". Couldn't find the word in my Webster's
American Heritage dictionary, but the MS Word spelling 
checker recognizes "crawdad"!

>Suck the head ... squeeze the tip!


And we never dreamed of eating them. 
We used them as bait to catch big ol' bullheads (catfish). 
Even for that, we didn't try to feed the fish the guts, 
we ripped the tail off of the live crawdad,  
pulled the meat out (not with our teeth)
and stuck that on the hook! 
Even a bottom-of-the-muddy-crick, 
scum-sucking bullhead has his culinary limits!
(No offense against Loosianans intended.)
Of course, given a good'nuf beer

I've found that I can eat purt near anything.

  I used a Checker for two years, and while it does not have all the bells

One thing to remember is to buy a couple bottles of standard buffer
solution and calibrate your meter every time that you use it.  As far as
temperature compensation, I used to subtract .15 from a reading at
152f .
  I would also recommend getting the 11/12 1996 issue of Brewing Techniques

area? Has anyone successfully installed a drain valve with compression 
fittings into one of these pots? Thanks."


Welding's not my deal, so I'll leave that to others who are more
knowledgeable, but I have installed compression fittings in both aluminum
and stainless steel pots.  What you want is known as a bulkhead fitting. 
Both Swagelock and Parker make a variety of these guys with various
combinations of compression fittings and NPT threads on one or both ends. 
Pick one that's going to be compatible with your valve.


Aluminum is relatively easy to drill, but the best policy is still to start
with a small diameter drill, make a pilot hole and then work your way up,
with larger and larger diameter drills, until you get the appropriate
diameter (2-3 steps is generally about right).  Sluicing up you drills with
cutting fluid helps a bunch here and if you don't have any around, I use
WD-40 for an emergency back-up.


With the hole made, the trick to installing the bulkhead fitting is to do
this such that it is going to be leak-free.  This is especially difficult
as you're doing the installation on a curved surface and the nuts on the
bulkhead fitting are not designed to provide a hermetic seal.  So what
you'll need to do is make a gasket.  I have cut gaskets (washers really)
out of sheets of Teflon or polyethylene and have a preference for Teflon as
it is more durable and temperature-resistant.  Place the gasket on the
inside of the pot, back it up with a stainless steel washer, and tighten
the nut on the bulkhead fitting down on it.  Be careful not to overtighten
or the Teflon gasket will start deforming and you may lose your seal.


If you have questions on sources of any of this stuff, email me.

Since my page was one of those listed, I'll say you're welcome.

You are correct.  In most cases the actual RIMS portion of the brewery is the
mash tun.  You will need 2 more vessels though (as I'm sure you've figured out
by now), a hot liquor tank to heat your sparge water and a boil kettle.  It's
hard to say how much it would cost to build a RIMS mash tun.  If you want to
build it from all stainless steel components with lots of super-whamodyne
electronic controls, it could cost several hundred dollars EASILY.  If you're
willing to scrounge around in surplus shops and settle for plastic, brass and
copper components, I'm guessing you could easily come in under $100.  Since
you've investigated the RIMS pages listed in BT you must have seen CD
Pritchard's page.  His system is remarkably  *ahem* "thrifty."

Since I don't have a mixer on my RIMS I can't say whether it is a valuable
addition to one's system.  Rumor has it that CD is working on such a device.
>From my experience I can say that I probably haven't missed out by not having a
mixer.  I get good extraction rates and the temperature boosts take place in a
reasonable amount of time.  My gut feeling is that I'd rather not go mucking
about in my grain bed once it has established a good "set" for filtration.


(I'm heavily medicated with antibiotics and narcotics right now as I'm having my
wisdom teeth pulled on Monday AM.  So bear with me on this.)


Near as I can tell, the biggest advantage of using a mash mixer (apologies to
anyone with trademarks or patents) is the mixing in of the heat applied to the
mash.  Since a RIMS system uses the recirulation of heated liquid, flowing
through the mash, the heat is evenly distributed throughout the mash and needs
no stirring.  If you were mashing in a kettle on a stove burner, you would want
to stir the mash to mix the heat in.


Good Brewing!
