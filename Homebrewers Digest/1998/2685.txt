Subject: yeast for BIG BREW


Dan asks about dry yeast for the Big Brew Barleywine.


I have had very good experiences with the Danstar Nottingham and
Windsor yeasts.  The Nottingham is slightly more attenuative.
The Windsor slightly more sulphury during fermentation and is
a little more "tart."  If I do go with dry yeast, I'll probably
go with the Nottingham.


However, what I will probably do is brew a 5-gallon batch of
Special Bitter from liquid yeast the week before the BIG BREW.
I will bring unpitched wort back home from the event and then,
after racking the Bitter off to a keg, split the dregs between
the Barleywine wort carboys.


The Mayor of the town in which we are planing to brew is a little
worried about the legality of this event.  I'm going to calm
his fears by telling him we will all pitch yeast when we go
home.  Therefore, from the Mayor's perspective, we're just
making an awful lot of very weird barley soup.

Subject: Ronco hop drier


Eric asks about using a Ronco Food Dehydrator for drying hops.


I've done this and you have to be very careful... I did not use an
extension like you fabricated, so maybe your mileage may vary.
I dried the hops overnight and that was FAR too dry.  They all
shattered into piles of petals upon the slightest touch.  If you
have a very accurate scale, search the HBD archives for "hop drying"
and see what the %moisture is for picked and dried hops.  You can
then weigh one of the trays periodically and stop when the weight
has dropped the correct amount.  I simply guessed... and guessed
wrong.


I've read where hops are slightly overdried and then allowed to
reabosorb some moisture, but I suspect that this is because commercially
they are working with much larger quantities and it would be impossible
to have the entire batch be at the perfect dryness at exactly the
same time.

Subject: Loose hops and Firkins


Greetings all:


George de Piro wondered in HBD #2682 about an English brewer adding loose
hops to his firkin - and the possibility of those hops ending up in
someone's pint.


The secret is not in the firkin, but in the tap used to dispense the beer.
Firkins have two bungs - one on the side (called a shive) for filling,
hopping, etc. and a small one (called a tut) on the end.  This small wooden
tut is where you drive the tap through when preparing the cask for service.


The tap has one blunt end which is struck with the mallet in order to drive
the tap through the tut.  The other end is tapered to allow penetration of
the tut, and when driven far enough in will seat itself and prevent any
leakage.  This tapered portion has a closed end, and along the taper are a
series of small holes - these allow the ale to flow while restraining the
hops.  Since my ASCII art skills are woefully inadequate, see Terry Foster's
Pale Ale issue (pg 77) of the Classic Beer Style Series.


It is possible to get some hop flotsam in the pint - it helps a great deal
if your hops are not prone to shattering.  And a little practice helps when
it comes to tapping the cask - if the ale is in high condition it can make
for a dramatic moment !  I once saw a cask tapped at a festival which shot a
stream of bitter about a dozen feet to soak the shoes of a fellow standing
"within range"!


So George (and all HBD'ers) - consider yourself invited to Victoria, BC
where every Friday we gather at Spinnakers Brewpub for some real ale - drawn
directly from the firkin sitting atop the bar. Marvellous stuff !


Cheers,


Mark Bridges

Subject: Gott vs. Igloo Coolers


Actually, the Gott/Rubbermaid *IS* recommended for hot liquids whereas
the Igloo is NOT.  I have seen quite a few permanently deformed cooler
interiors and know that it does indeed make a big difference.  The
deformations are more than cosmetic, incidentally... when the floor
deforms the slotted tubing can rise off the bottom, leaving good wort
behind.  If you are using a false bottom, it can unseat letting grain
underneath to clog your plumbing.

My circa 28 cubit foot fridge will hold any of :

 - 5 tall skinny kegs
 - 2 short fat and one carboy
 - 3 tall skinny and one carboy


That's good enough for me.


Only disadvantage is obviously that I have only
one temp control

Subject: Gott vs Igloo : Igloo wins hands down


Just posted this to rec.crafts.brewing, and noticed a similar
thread here in the HBD :


While on the topic, a few weeks ago I was at a hardware store in
the Italian quarter where a good friend lives.  There are several good
brew shops there, and even the hardware stores have more brewing
hardware than most brew shops.  So my buddy (who is just beginning
in the hobby) looks way up to the ceiling on a shelf there,
points, and asks me :


"Would that be any good to you in brewing?"


I look up and my heart nearly stops.  There on the top shelf, glowing
like angels from Above, were standing proudly two very large SS
coffee urns.  I paused, completely in awe.  Staring.  The
Angels^H^H^H^H^H^HUrns were staring back from Above, mocking
me.  I couldn't get a very close look because they were up so high,
but the front read "Igloo", and the sign read 50litre (12.5gallon) on
one, and 75litre on the other.  I didn't have to get a closer look,
though,
since I'd seen them in use recently at a celebration at work.  They're
just like a Gott, only SS inside and out.  And built to last a loooonnng


time.


[sigh]


The cheap one was $175CDN.  The other was just over $200.
One day, they will be mine!


cheers,
 -Alan

Dan Cole <dcole`at`roanoke.infi.net> asked:
>What are your recommendations for a dry yeast for the barley wine recipes?


I'm sure that Rob Moline will respond also, but here is a little "insider
information".  The yeast that Rob used for his award-winning recipe was
Nottingham dry yeast.  Since that is the one that he won with, and since I
have had the privilege of tasting the result of Rob's efforts, I would
recommend using that strain/product.


One note on the Big "10/20" Barley Wine recipe, with Rob's permission we
"genericized" the recipe to ensure that homebrewers everywhere could
participate with the ingredients from their local homebrew shop.  We wanted
to have Rob available on the day of the event to answer specific questions
about his recipe and give brewers the details.   I'm now thinking that we
should look into having some information available ahead of time.....Stay
tuned....


Good Luck & Good Beer!

Subject: Fruit beer


Here in the Northeast a fortnight past, we experienced a heat wave of
sorts. Thinking my calendar was wrongand it was not March but May I
decided to brew a fruit beer. Only after brewing did I realize fresh
fruit hasn't become available (unless I wanted to pay and pay for
imported mediocre South American fruit). So I resorted to a fruit
extract. The "all-natural" ingredients are vegetable oil, natural
flavors and alpha tocopherol. Upon racking to the 2ndary, I added the
extract. Now I have an oil slick atop my beer.


Have I ruined this batch? Should I re-rack all but the top inch or so to
remove the oil? Or is this OK and normal? Also, if not, what kind of
extract should I use next year around this time when I rush Springtime
again. Needless to say, I'm planning a "real" fruit beer for sometime
later this Spring...

Subject: Brewing in a dungeon??




Hey there everybody.


I've been an on-again/off-again lurker and infrequent poster
on the HBD since 1990.  It's given me a lot to think about, 
and has helped to make my beer pretty darn good.


OK, now to the question.  I have since moved from a pretty 
new house in Georgia to a 115 year-old house in upstate, NY.
I used to brew in my driveway, and ferment in my garage.  I
made a couple of Ken Schwartz' Fermentation Chillers, which
worked impressively well.  


Here's my current problem.  The basement of my house has been
designated as my brewery.  My basement is not your pool table 
and stereo lounge - it's a full-fledged dungeon.  Cobwebs, 
rough stone walls, and a little bit of water leakage.  It 
doesn't smell particularly bad, but it does get a little musty
at times down there.  


I've got a few questions.  Some of them have an obvious easy 
answer:  I don't know - get the data yourself, you lazy bastard!
Cut me some slack - I've answered my share of similar questions.


1.  Does that musty smell indicate a nasty infection source?


2.  My basement is about 7 feet tall, about 5 of which are 
        underground.  What kind of temperature variations 
          (hour to hour, day to day, and season to season) can
        I expect.  I've never lived in a house with a base-
        ment.


3.  Anyone ever rig up a cheap vent hood in a basement?


4.  Is there a stellar homebrew supplier in the finger
        lakes area?  I'm in Corning NY.


5.  The water here (especially compared to Georgia) sucks.
        Furthermore, I can't get the water department to tell
        me Ca++ concentration.  Starting with distilled water,
            can I just add salts to get to the right mineral profile?
        I'd just take the more 'common' ions into account:  Ca,
        Mg, Na, Cl, CO3, SO4.  Is there any important trace ion
        that's gonna screw me?  If so, can i just try to do a 
        similar thing with 'drinking' water, which i figure would
        be pretty soft?


Thanks for any or all input you could provide.  I think I'll go 
have another beer.  And I promise to stop lurking.

Subject: .08 and Gun Rights


Vacom complains about guns!  Those hunters and sportsmen are fighting
the battle of various gun control efforts for the very reason we should
argue against .08.  When one's rights are slowly chiseled away at we
ultimately will have no rights at all.  Prohibition was a noble attempt
at protecting us from ourselves, what it did was only create more crime
and corruption; poison people with bad booze and make criminals out of
everyday citizens who enjoyed a glass of wine or bottle of beer.
 
You may want to consider taking up gun sports to familiarize your self
with real gun fire and not firecrackers that are generally used to ring
in the New Year.


And anyone who believes that the Electoral College represents all of the

    As much as the popular press rides on lawyers, I am thankful for the
likes of a few I have known, including Sully, newly introduced to, and Mr.
Bonham.......and Debra Biilingsley, Assistant Attorney General for ABC,
Kansas....
    When one engages in the highly regulated field of commercial brewing, or
even that of homebrewing, knowing what is out there is always useful....


    Big Brew "98......
    It hardly need be said that I have been honoured by the AHA, (of which I
am a member) by their use of my Barleywine Recipe for the inaugural attempt
to make the most simultaneous brew....
    I know that long time participants and lurkers will understand that this
recipe has been the subject of just a wee bit of controversy in the
past.....


    I had always stated that I would not reveal the recipe, even when asked
by the likes of my esteemed colleague,  Fal Allen, when he asked for it,
prior to the brew winning `at` GABF '96....


    But times have changed...the recipe was released by others who really
had no right to do so, IMHO....and then other more scurillous parties
entered the fray....much to the dismay of the HBD, and the entire electronic
community....


    If not for the actions of folks like Tomme Arthur, who felt outrage `at`
the whole deal....and stood up for a fellow brewer, even `at` a time when that
fellow brewer was completely unknown to him....and who knew that I had no
access to the insult being laid out for me..........
    Why, I would never have known what was going on...
    If not for assistance by members of the HBD, including certain attorneys
and web folk....I would have been seriously behind the curve......


BUT, here and now, we go into BIG BREW '98....and I truly hope that all that
wish to...get involved.....this being the inaugural year, I only wish that
this years effort makes a splash, to be followed by bigger tsunami's in
subsequent years efforts.....


 But here is the recipe for Big 12 Barleywine.......and soon I will lay out
all the recipes for ALL beers ever brewed by myself in a commercial
setting....I hope that they work as well for you as they have for me...


    KEEP IN MIND......the inefficiencies of the system I worked on...and the
fact that I have never been a "technical brewer," just a seat of the pants
guy who made beer, and adjusted the next batch in terms of "I need 15 % more
aroma next time,"


    So, for all that wish to make the brew....these are original notes for a
7 bbl batch.....


 Big 12 Barleywine

Subject: Long ferment with Wyeast #3068


Two weeks and one day ago I pitched a 1 qt. starter
of Weihenstephen-3068 into a gravity 1.056 weizen wort
and it is still actively fermenting.  This after racking into a
secondary fermenter at 10 days to get the wort off settled trub
and yeast.  Initial krausen was massive and this yeast just won't
quit.  Gravity at racking was 1.020, I am expecting terminal gravity
to be 1.016.  Within an hour after racking, a "new" krausen had formed
and still hasn't dropped.  Has anyone else had this experience?  What are
the possible negative consequences of this seemingly extended primary
fermentation?  I can't find anything related in the HBD archives and I have
contacted Wyeast but have received no response.  Ferment temperatures
have been a constant 68 F. This long ferment , if typical, is something I
was
unaware of.  Any info would be appreciated.

Subject: C02 Cylinders


A similar thread about CO2 cylinders came up on
r.c.b.  I did some unit conversions and was surprised
that 1 lb. of CO2 will only occupy about 8 cu. ft.
under standard conditions (assuming I didn't make a
mistake in the math).  The contents of a 5 lb.
cylinder in a smallish room (1000 cu. ft.) would
then represent about 4% of the volume.  Of course,
it's not all going to mix up right away as the
CO2 exiting the cylinder is going to be cool and
dense and pool on the floor.


A question came up, which went unanswered I think,
and that was at what concentrations and exposure
times does CO2 become hazardous?

Top of the morning to yea all,


Al K said:
"I put *all* the hops into the kettle (Saaz pellets in a hop bag) while
running off. "


Perhaps Al's problem with the hop aroma was that the hops were contained in
a hop bag.  I have used Saaz hops, 25g, as a first wort hopping, both
pellet and leaf,  and the hop aroma was just wonderful with just the right
amount of hop flavor.  Did not use a hop bag, never have never will.  


A hop bag is not needed or recommended in my opinion.  I doesn't allow the
hops to be properly ustilized in the boil.


The moral of the story.  Do it correctly and you will get good results.

Subject: Phils new Philler/Ammonia


I got one of them and immediately modified it. As designed, it works on
a siphon system. Therefore, the bottle that you are filling must be
lower than the beer level in our keg. This gives pretty quiet fills, but
with the diameter of the fill tube, it is seriously slow.


We also found that, as designed, it would probably work better if there
were two CO2 sources rather than one. For some reason, the pressure in
the bottle is always higher than the keg. I suspect this is somehow due
to the pressure drop across the filling line or some such thing. Anyway
it has a tendency to back siphon a little. Not a real big deal tho.


We modified it by taking the CO2 return loop off and venting that with a
needle valve. There is a trick to getting the thing to work quickly
without extra foam: before inserting the filler into the bottle, purge
the fill tube with a quick blast of CO2 (turn the knob to the CO2
position). You might want floor drains for this operation ;-) For some
reason this allows for a black fill at pretty high rates. Without this,
there is a considerable amount of foam generated and you have to fill
very slowly to counter the problem.


Other than that the thing works pretty well. I like the single valve.

Subject: False bottom problems...


Hello,


        I recently started doing all grain brews.  I use a converted Gott cooler
to mash my grains.  In the bottom, I have a 9 inch false bottom.  Each time
(3) I have brewed my sparge gets terribly stuck.  Yesterday when I brewed I
checked carefully when I was cleaning out the cooler to try and get the
sparge going, and it appears that the false bottom is floating up when I
put the hot water in the Gott.  The grain then gets under the false bottom
and plugs the hole.  The directions I have say that I should add water to
the bottom of the Gott before putting any grain in.  Can I put the grain in
first?  I believe I read that putting the grain in first can cause stuck
sparges.  The one time I got the flow to work, all was great, but other
than that I am stumped.  Replies are appreciated.

     Back in HBD #2678, I posed the following question about wort aeration:
     
     >Instead of the aeration stone, how about adapting John's flask 
     >stirrer to work with a carboy, or, with a plastic bucket, for that 
     >matter?
     
     I've received a few responses regarding this idea, all very helpful - 
     thanks to those who offered ideas/opinions/facts.  8>)
     
     In HBD #2679, George De Piro offered this advice:
     
     >Yes, this can be done in the fermenter, but you most definitely don't
     >want to!  Constant agitation of the fermenting wort will promote
     >greater yeast growth and faster fermentation.  A big brewer tried

     >the fermentation cellar.  It was either Schaefer of Schlitz...Rob, do 
     >you remember?
     
     I now know NOT to constantly agitate the wort (after pitching the 
     yeast), for fear of the production of undesirable fermentation 
     byproducts.
     
     So, the idea of stirring the wort as a method of aeration is a big 
     NO-NO!!
     
     However, in my original post, I also stated the following:
     
     >I've recently read something somewhere (Brewery B-Board?) that says 
     >you should aerate the wort with oxygen via an aeration stone for 
     >specific lengths of time, at specific intervals, after the yeast is 
     >pitched, in order to promote healthy yeast.
     
     I've finally managed to locate the original source I was referring to. 
      
     Dave Miller writes, in the May/June '93 issue of Brewing Techniques:
     
     >Aerate the pitched wort until foam reaches the top of the fermenter.  
     >Then, let the foam subside for a few hours and repeat. A few hours 
     >later, repeat again. The idea is to bubble air through the wort for 
     >at least 15 min during the first 6-8 h after cooling and pitching.
     
     >It is hard to overestimate the importance of thorough aeration for 
     >yeast growth. At our brewery, I use a stainless steel version of the 
     >rig in Figure 1, and our worts start to ferment in 3-8 h.
     
     OK.  So it looks like it's a good idea to aerate the wort during the 
     first 6-8 hours after pitching the yeast.  Does anyone out there use 
     this technique?  (Besides Mr. Miller.)  ;>)
     
     Also, instead of using pure oxygen, how about using an aquarium air 
     pump?  What kind of filter do you need to use with an air pump?  
     
     In the July/August '93 issue of BT, Roy Paris offers a refinement of 
     the aerator setup previously presented by Dave Miller (BT, May/June 
     '93).  If anyone decides to take a look at these articles, can you 
     offer any advice or critiques?

In my view it is.  IF you follow good cleaning and sanitation procedures

sure you do a good job and use proper sanitizer concentrations and exposure

Greg Young asks about infecting his normal brewing equipment and beers

which includes sour mashes, lambic brewing and just about all other
styles of ales and lagers, is that with care in keeping brewing
equipment clean and sanitary, one can do all of this without cross
contamination.  So far, knock on wood, I've not had infections where
they weren't desired.  My only problems have been where I've used yeast
acquired from questionable sources.   Thoroughly clean then sanitize
prior to and after use and you can participate in all aspects of brewing

Subject: Sour mash, lambics


Brewsters:


Greg Young asks if a sour mash can provide bacteria which
will be difficult to remove from your equipment.  The answer
is "yes" if you don't sterilize or at least pasteurize the added
sour mash before you add it to your fermentation.  Remember
the whole point of AlK insisting that we do not use the word
"sterilize" for our normal cleaning activity is that there are still
some bugs hanging around, George De Piro's comment that
normal cleaning activity ( sanitizing)  will dispense with these
unwanted creatures, to the contrary.


In his book "Lambic" Guinard says on page 113:


"*A word of caution for Microbrewers*


If you cannot afford a separate fermentation and conditioning
set-up to brew lambic style beers, it is best to give up the idea.
Introducing a host of microorganisms other than your own
Saccharomyces brewing strain into the brewery is very risky
business.  These "wild" organisms spread very easily into
pumps, hoses, tanks where they do not belong. This point
cannot be stressed enough, especially at times when
contamination is the main concern of microbrewers."


Although he was focussing on microbreweries where the
problem is multiplied by the variety of contact surfaces and the
potential economic damage a contaminated brewery will have,
the same basic principles apply to homebrewers.
 If you are going to ferment lambics, Berliner Weisse and
other beers with microorganisms other than the Saccharomyces
you desire in most beers, it is better to have a separate set
of equipment for this fun activity.


However, all is not lost as you can prepare the acid separately
by a sour mash for Dry Stouts and Berliner Weisse and then
sterilize ( pressure cooker) or pasteurize it to just under a boil
or at least 160F for 10 minutes, covered, to reduce the
bacterial population before you add it to your beer. Alternatively
( although you give up desirable and undesirable cogener
flavors) adjust the acidity with lactic acid, at least at first, to
get an idea of how much acid you want in your beers.
Classical Lambics, of course, cannot be made in this way
since they require two years of sequential fermentation by
various yeasts and bacteria. 




Should you choose to ignore the above warnings and
comments, I do believe that *strong* bleach and attention
to details will obviously clean up the simple equipment most
of us use. Depending on how careful you are and your ability to
disassemble your equipment will in a large part determine
your ability to produce unsoured beer in future batches.


My point is, why risk it? Sterilizing or pasteurizing the sour
mash or using lactic acid will prevent such contamination.

I ordered a 3" dual scale thermometer with a 4" probe. I also bought a

and shipping (from PA to WA) was $7. They have a similar 3" thermometer
without a calibration screw for $21. 5" models with and without cal
screw are $38 and $35. There are lots of options for the dials and stems
too.


I ordered mine on April 1st and was promised it would ship no later than
the 9th. I received it on the 9th!


Anyway they have a web page at http://www.trendinst.com. You can request

   I have just anecdotal evidence.  After reading Dennis Davison's
_Zymurgy_ article on Berliner Weisse about 16 months ago, I did a
sour mash light wheat beer, using my standard equipment and
fermentation location.  None of my subsequent beers have soured,
even after 5 months in the bottle (which is about as long as I
manage to keep homebrew around).


   I have a related question.  If you wanted to enter a sour
mash wheat beer that approximates the stylistic characteristics
of a Berliner Weisse in a homebrew competition, would you enter is
as a specialty (special technique being use of a sour mash) or
as a Berliner Weiss?

more?) of flour.

Thanks for the support, Louis. I do wish that more people would take their
comments and complaints to us directly before venting publicly. Oh well.
Can't please everyone, eh?


So what else have you heard about the Kolsch article? I only saw one note
in the HBD about it. I'd like to respond publicly to that guy, but it would
help to know what else, if anything, has been said. The author turned that
article out very quickly for us as a favor, and it passed review just fine.
Yes, there was more to be said. Yes, the focus was more on straight
pragmatism than many of our past styles articles (i.e., suggesting the use
of different malts, etc.). Optimally, I like to provide as much information
as possible so that brewers can decide for themselves which shortcuts
they're willing to take. But as Stephen (continually) admonishes me, it's
not necessary, or should I say, it's not realistic to try to make every
article into a compleat treatise on a given topic.


Later,
Deb
