cuz it showed up on a Saturday digest.

        I recall a little while ago someone suggesting the use of a
syringe for blasting air into their stout to create a head similar to that
of Guinness.  That got me thinking....what about using a big syringe for
"injecting" wort to aerate it before pitching?  The only problem I can
think of would be a risk of introducing ambient "nasties" into the wort.
Anyone care to weigh in on this one?


        Also, anyone looking to obtain a nice sized brewing pot might be
well served by checking the papers for going-out-of-business restaurant
auctions.  I picked up an 8 gallon stainless steel pot for $25 at an
auction last week and can't wait to put it to use.  These auctions are
usually during weekdays but I just went over to the auction site, checked
out the kettle, and decided how much I would pay for it.  Then I put in an
absentee bid on it and went back to work.  The auctioneer was authorized
to bid for me up to the amount I was willing to pay.  I wound up getting
it for alot less than I bid too.  I'll bet you could get some other useful
brewing equipment too.

Subject: Weird haze phenomenon, wots dat taste?


I've got a couple of questions for anyone who cares to comment:


1)  I've had a Calif.. Common in my fridge in a corny (naturally
carbonated) for 5 months now.  STILL CLOUDY!!  But the weird thing is 
that
the 2 ft. length of hose between the corny and the picnic tap (also in 
the
fridge) does clear with time.  I know, you'll say it only looks clear
because I'm looking through only 3/8 inch of beer, but not so.  Fill a
glass with beer and the "new" beer now in the hose is cloudy. The overall


keg might be getting clearer, but oh so slowly.  This beer was extract
brewed  ( with steeped crystal malt).  I got  decent cold break with my
immersion chiller,  and I dry hopped for two weeks with pellets in a bag 
in
the secondary.
Does this sound like good old protein haze?  Could the pelleted 
dry-hopping
cause cloudiness in the beer?  Why does the line clear, but not the keg?


2) Could inadequate oxygenation of wort lead to a nasty flavor in your 
beer
that fades with lagering?    All of my beers (including the batch 
mentioned
above) have a distinct harsh taste to them (some more than others) that
fades with time in the fridge.  My beers always seem to improve with lots


of time.  Even after a year in the fridge, they are still improving. I
can't describe the taste, other than by saying it's harsh.  I extract 
brew,
and have done partial batch boils, full batch boils, liquid yeast, dry
yeast, no starter, three stage  (half gallon) starters.  The only
consistent "fault"  I  see in my method is that I  do not aerate my beer
after pitching nearly as much as most preach (and practice).  I  just 
shake
the carboy for a while until it's good and foamy. I generally get active
fermentation within hours and am near final gravity in a few days.  


Believe me, this is not a one batch thing, so I cannot blame it on a
specific set of ingredients or conditions.  I does however, have me
stumped.
Any clues? TIA

Subject: Burnt Spots and more


I have a questions for my fellow homebrewers:


(1) I have some burnt spots in my brew kettle and I would like to know; 
how can I remove the burnt matter from my pot?


(2) If I'm doing a three gallon all-grain Hefe-Weizen with six lbs. of 
grain, how much water should I use when mixing the grains. According to 
this article I found, the amount was 1 gallon. Does anybody out there 
know the answer?


(3) I wanted to make a Barley Wine, has anybody made one before and how 
did it taste? I was thinking about going the all-grain route. So if you 
have some some info for me I really could use it.


Cheers!

Subject: Lactation & beer (Hefeweizen)


Greeting,


Responding to Thor's comments re: "Hefeweizen helps nursing mom express 
milk."  History is full of stories of beer, esp. English stouts (see 
Dave Line for recipes), being used for 'letting down' milk.  The general 
thought in the medical community is that it is due to the 
alcohol-induced relaxation, not anything with regards to the yeast.  In 
point, my Italian wife's family suggests a nice, yeast-free red wine to 
do the job.  One point of concern is that alcohol will pass into the 
breast milk and therefore into the baby.  Having said that, my wife 
(Associate Clinical Professor, Yale School of Nursing; Clincal 
Coordinator of Pharmacy Yale-New Haven Hospital) has had a small glass 
of wine once in a while to help "let down the milk."  So I wouldn't 
worry about doing it once or twice.  Well, I'll drink toast to any woman 
giving birth--its a tough job I couldn't do ;-)

with the talk a while back about MIXMASHING and what not, I
thought y'all might be interested in this page:


http://aleworks.com/tour.htm


It is from a microbrewery in Napa, CA that has a unique (as far
as I know) mash tun.  They are able to rotate the whole thing like
a cement mixer before and after dough in.  The benefits they claim
sound like marketing BS (more creamy?), but the picture looks neat.
doesn't look too adaptable to homebrewer's though.


BTW, any comments on Napa Ale Works beer?

I just wanted to warn you about fermenting at too high a temp with 1007. I
fermented a batch split into 3 carboys at 55F, 60F & 70F. The 55F batch was
the best for this yeast, the 60F batch was good and the 70F batch was dumped.


I like to use 1056 in the spring/summer and 1007 in the fall/winter for my
ales.

Subject: Will this pump work for a RIMS system?


Hi all:


I have a question.  I got luck and got a brand new liquid transfer pump from my
work and was wondering if I can use this for a RIMs system.  


It is a made by Teel and model # 1P799.  I looked it up in the Grainger catalog
and found out that it is a 1/2 Hp chemical-resistant pump.  In the catalog they
have specs regarding Gal per Min `at` Total Head in Feet.  The GPM I understand but
what is meant by Total Head in Feet?  Also for 5 ft and 10 ft total head in feet
it shows 23 and 21 GPM.  This seems like way too much, any way to reduce that?


Thanks in advance,
Ed

In response to Paul Ward in HBD 2688:


>A couple of questions:


>1)  Just how stupid was it to steep some black patent to acidify my
>    sparge?  Was there enough grain to really make a PH difference?


4 oz BP in 6# total grain bill is a pretty good percentage, you likely 
 affected the color and the PH by a good margin.  I estimate the color 
 addition of the BP to be around 10 deg Lovibond - taking it from about 
 3 to 13, very pale to above amberish.  I'm no expert on PH though (not 
 that I'm an expert on _any_ of this!), so I'll let someone else chime 
 in here . . .


>2)  Why is 170F better for sparging than lower temperatures (say 160F
>    or 150F)?  I understand about higher temperatures & starch.


Hotter sparge water, within limits, will increase the solubility of the 
 sugars in the wort - making it easier to draw them out - too hot 
 though, and you can draw out tannins and such that you do not want.  


>3)  Not that it matters at this stage in my learning curve, but how
>    would I figure extraction rates from the given date (6 lbs. assorted
>    grains yielding 12 quarts at 1.042 S.G.)?


Everything matters at every stage of the learning curve - that's how 
 you keep learning!


5.0# pale ale malt at roughly 35 pts = 175 pts
0.5# crystal at roughly 30 pts = 15 pts 
0.25# BP at roughly 20 pts = 5 pts
total grain bill = 195 pts


you got 3 gallons at 1.042, 3*42 = 126 pts


efficiency is 126/195 = about 65% - not bad
point pounds per gallon of 42*5.75/3 = 22 - again, not bad for a first effort


Note that all the numbers above are rough and depend on the grains you 
 use.  What you want to do is to keep good records of your all grain or 
 partial mash experiences and figure out what kind of efficiencies you 
 can reliably repeat with your system.  I found Ray Daniels Brewing 
 Great Beers book a valuable resource.


Brew on!

Subject: Beer and Mothers/CO2


A couple of comments:


Beer and Mothers:  It's accepted lore that beer helps new mothers bring
in their milk.  My wife's midwife said so, and within a couple hours of
having an Anchor Liberty Ale my wife had the milk a-flowin.  I kept
drinking them in hopes of having MY milk come in, but to no avail.


CO2 detectors:  I have seen a bunch of nonsense about CO2 detectors-you
have them in your bodies. As I learned in SCUBA class, the body reacts
to a buildup of CO2 by gasping for breath.  The body does not sense O2
(what it wants), it senses CO2 (which it doesn't want). That's why you
can walk into a room full of N2 and breathe it until you die-your body
doesn't know that it's O2 deprived.

From: David Sherfey <sherf`at`warwick.net>
Subject: Hop bag alternative


Al sez;


**** I *do* recommend the use of hop bags for both pellets and whole
hops
when you don't have a drain on your kettle.  It makes it much easier to
remove the hops prior to running the wort into your fermenter and is
an order of magnitude better than using a sieve to remove the hops
when pouring the cooled (or *GASP!* hot) wort into the fermenter.


Another alternative would be to allow the hops into the fermenter, but
that would increase the risk of a clogged airlock/blowoff and would
complicate the racking of the finished beer.****


Here's another alternative;
For the past twelve years I have successfully racked out of the kettle
(3 to 15 gallon resataurant w/no drain) using a copper tube racking cane
(with an
oversize copper cap soldered onto the end) lodged against the
side/bottom of the kettle.  I whirlpool with the oar/paddle (creating a
cone or mound of trub in the center of the bottom) and allow to settle
for ten or fifteen minutes, and then drop in the racking cane and start
the siphon into the chiller.  When I use leaf hops, I tie a copper
choreboy around the cap using
copper wire. With pellet hops only, no choreboy.  I have also used this
procedure on a converted keg kettle, but with the round bottom, the cane


needs to be tied in place to the handle of the keg so that the cane is
fastened against the side/bottom and not in the center of  the rounded
bottom.


All bets are off if you let the cane move into the trub pile.....


I have used this procedure with beer OG 1.032 to 1.110.  I wind up with
about two quarts or so of glop after racking 10 or 12 gallons of wort
(OG 1.040 to 1.070).  I don't get hops in my fermenter.


To rate the order of effectiveness;
1)whirlpool
2)cane does not move into the pile
3)cap
4)choreboy


Cheers!

a starch adjunct? How did you prep them, what would you have 
done differently, 2-row or 6-row malt, preferred hops and

Subject: Frustrated Brewer


Carm Salvatore Has been having problems with all grain brewing. (HBD
#2689)


Here are my thoughts


1) Nothing wrong with the recipe, pretty much a best bitter / ESB


2) Mineral content of water, Nothing really glaring here. I travel 75
miles to collect water like this (from a private well), and have no
problems with undue harshness.


3) Initial pH of 9.2/9.6 - Wow seems a bit high for the mineral content,
but with a mash pH of 5.2 there is nothing to be concerned about.


4) NO break during the boil! I think this is the source of the
harshness. What we need to do is to identify why this is happening.
(obviously). How long are you boiling for? (90 mins normally secures me
a good hot break). Have you tried using Irish moss Rehydrated and added
halfway during the boil? Something is preventing the precipitation of
the break proteins, Irish moss may help to overcome this.


If you think it is the water contributing this harshness, why not brew a
batch using distilled water adding 2 tsp. of Gypsum, and 1 tsp. of Epsom
Salts.


You may want to consider dropping the Chinook and replacing it with say
2oz of Goldings or Fuggles, If you are boiling for a short period of
time you may still have residual taste compounds from the chinook which
does lend a harshness. The lower alpha acid hops have a much better
flavour profile.


Don't despair and give up somebody will come up with the answer.

Subject: Cold Plates




The recent posts about the reaction between aluminum and other metals has
me wondering.....  I bought a two line cold plate in February.  The cold
plate consists of stainless steel tubes encased in an aluminum block.  I
hooked up the first line and everything was great.  About 3 days later, all
of the beer coming out of the tap had a terrible metallic flavor.  I
bypassed the cold plate and proved that it was the cold plate causing this
problem.


I called the company I bought it from, and after 2 hours of fighting with
them on the phone, they agreed to exchange the cold plate for a new one.


Last night I finally hooked up the new cold plate.  Line 1 had a heavily
hopped amber ale.  Line 2 had a wheat ale.  Within minutes, the wheat ale
took on a metallic taste coming out of the tap.  The amber does not have
this flavor, but I really cannot taste much other than hops.  Once again,
bypassing the cold plate the problem goes away on the wheat line.


I am assuming that my problems stem from the construction of the cold plate
using aluminum and stainless steel.  The thing I don't understand is that I
have seen tons of these things in action before and have never tasted this
off flavor.  I thought maybe I didn't have the little barb connections in
far enough, but they are as tight as aluminum threads will tolerate.


Does anyone out there use a cold plate that knows how to get around these
flavors??????  After the battle to send the old one back, I can't imagine
trying to send a second one back, especially since I lost the receipt.

Subject: Carms Harshness


HBDers -


Carm writes with a vexing problem on harshness in beers brewed with spring
water.  I too ran into similar trouble a few years ago and have recently
been disappointed with a Festbier showing a similar harsh character.  Gotta
be vigilant on this stuff, eh?  Here's some suggestions, which I'm sure
many others will repeat:


 - reduce your PH even further.  I like to keep mine at about 5.0 measured
while hot.  Especially check the sparge runnings as you get close to
cutting it off.
 - make sure your PH measurements are accurate.  DO NOT use those cheapie PH
strips.  Get the expensive ones ($15 per 100 at Brewer's Resource).  The
biege ones you used in High School simply aren't good enough.  I
benchmarked mine cheapie strips and they were a full point off -- a huge
difference in a logrithmic measurement!
 - Cut that sparge off early.  Its tempting to run the sparge down as low as
recommended (1.012 adjusted for temp, I recall) to eak out every last bit
of sugar, but I try to cut off a little earlier than that -- anything lower
that 1.010 unadjusted is fair game in my book.  If you're worried about
undershooting your OG, throw in an extra 1/2# of malt and go with it baby.
 - Fortify your spring water with 1/2 distilled.  An expensive option to be
sure, but this is the only one that smooths out my beers.
 - Don't boil your main bittering addition longer than 60 minues (a Noonan
recommendation).  I ususally FWH, so a little hop addition early helps keep
the boil over danger down, then add the main addition with 50 minutes to go.
 - Treat you water with CaCl instead of gypsum (a Daniels recommendation).
A little Cl is supposed to smooth out hop bitterness, and reducing SO will
also reduce harshness. 
 - Just cut back on your bittering.  I've found that somewhere in my
configuration, scales, and process that my beers turn out best when I aim
for the lower end of the IBU range.  


Aside from locating CaCl (I found it in the wine section of my homebrew
shop) and shelling out dough for distilled water, all these things can be
done without changing your current system much.  


Hope this helps,

Subject: Harshness/RTD


Carm Salvatore asks about harshness in his all grain efforts and cites
water as his main suspect. His water is actually very soft (Ca   6.4
MG/L, Mg  0.73   MG/L,  Na  4.2  MG/L),  and has a low alkalinity of 25
mg/L. Yet he reports "a very significant amount of residue when I
accidentally boiled a quart dry..." This is not consistent with the
reported water mineral content. The amount of residue left after boiling
should be quite small. He also reports using a carbon filter. Note that
a carbon filter is beneficial for its ability to remove chlorine,
chloramines and other odor producting organics but that it has no effect
on dissolved mineral content. He reports 9.5 mg/L for sulfate. Assuming
this to be correct (and we are suspicious because of the comment about
heavy deposits) hops would not be the source of the harshness nor,
indeed, do the hopping levels reported lead to bitterness considered
harsh by most drinkers when the sulfate levels are much higher.


Other sources of harshness that come to mind are phenolic or fusel
harshness which focuses our attention on fermentation temperature, yeast
strain choice and possible contamination by wild yeast or bacteria. The
original post says nothing about these.


Perception of harshness is, of course, somewhat subjective. I don't like
most microbrewed Pils because I find the bittering hops used (Nugget,
for example) harsh. I prefer to use Saaz exclusively in my own shots at
this style. Obviously this is a peculiarity of my palate as some of
these beers are deemed quite good by other drinkers. Carm's comments
about his wheat, hopped at quite low levels and with noble or near noble
varieties, suggest that perhaps he shares this trait. I would suggest,
therefore, that Carm run some of these beers through other experienced
home brewers and solicit their opinions. Another option is to enter them
in a contest but the problem there is that you can't discuss process
with the judges.

Ian Smith had a problem with an RTD in a 4-20 loop hookup to a PC. My
first question is "Why bother with the 4-20 converter?" Unless you are
running from one end of an electrically noisy brewery to another you
should be able to hook the RTD directly to the PC card assuming that it
has the required bridge circuitry for 3 wire RTD connection and many,
many of the cards that are sold do because temperature monitoring with
RTDs is probably the most common function which these boards perform. If
the card is not configured for RTD input I'd swap it for one which is
and save the trouble of trying to build a converter which would only
lead to the kind of problems already being encountered.


I suppose one could glypt the pots to render them imobile, install the
current to voltage converting resistor across a volts-only input and
then develop a calibration table to convert voltage readings to
temperature.

Subject: Re: Getting VERY frustrated . . . Please help!


Carm <salvator`at`future.dreamscape.com> has a problem with harshness except
in his lower hopped wheat beers.


I'll leave the water chemistry to someone else who may know more about it,
except to say that in general, mash water ought to be >50ppm Ca++.  Your
water is as soft as Pilsner water.  I'd be inclined to add CaSO4 or CaCl2
depending on style, just to get the Ca++ up.  Having said that, you
obviously haven't had too high pH as a result, judging by your mash pH.
It's low, if anything, and the lack of break confirms this.  I doubt that
you'd need the lactic acid, but I doubt it hurt anything.  But you may be
oversparging.


But here is a big clue:


>  1 oz Chinook (12.5%) 60 min


assuming 23% utilization, = 69 IBU


>  1/4 oz Tettenang 20min


assuming 5% alpha acid and 13% utilization, = 5 IBU


>  1/4 oz Fuggles 10 min


assuming 5% aa, 9% utilization = 2 IBU


>  1/2 oz Cascade knock out


So ignoring any contribution from the Cascades at knockout, you have 76 IBU
bitterness!  No wonder it's harsh!  And I was using utilization figures for
whole hops; if you are using pellets, the Chinook utilization would be 28%
and would would contribute 81 IBU, and the total would be around 89 IBU.
I'm using hops utilization figures from the Hop-Go-Round, a circular
sliderule.  They are the same as in the Zymurgy wall chart and other
sources.  Tinseth's online hops calculator
http://realbeer.com/hops/IBU.html gives 65 IBU for the Chinook.  My
experience is that this is about right for whole hops and low for pellets.


So my strong suggestion to you is to cut the hops way down.  Any hops would
be very bitter at this level, and Chinook can be harsh at those levels.  If
you use one ounce, I'd say it would be plenty.  It would still be a very
bitter beer.


My other advice is to join a local club and compare beers and notes.  Don't
give up or lose heart.  It isn't tocket science.

Subject: re: "Frustrated..."


In response to Carm Salvatore's problem with harshness in all grain
batches:


What you're describing may be what several sources term "husk
astringency." If so, you're problem may lie in you're mashing/sparging
procedures. Unfortunately, brewing is obviously a fairly complicated
process, that is, there are a decent number of variables involved all
of which can potentially lead to "off flavors." So, how to solve your
harshness problem, hmmmmm...


Well, first I'd suggest finding someone * knowledgeable and experienced * 
and get them to sample your beers, see if they can suggest likely causes.
Unfortunately, you may not have access to such an expert or you may run
into what we did at one point where we tried having our local brew club
members identify a troublesome off-flavor, the range of suggested causes
ran the gamut from reasonable to ridiculous. 


So, if you are totally frustrated and fed up with making beer after beer
that sucks I'm afraid you're going to have to be systematic and try to
identify the cause(s) yourself. You should try limiting as many variables
as possible. Experiment. KEEP IT SIMPLE! For instance, there are loads of
variables that go hand-in-hand with all grain brewing, ELIMINATE THEM.
Start with a SIMPLE * extract* recipe, something like a simple pale. Brew
this and see how it comes out. If you lose the harshness then you've
likely narrowed the problem down to your mashing/sparging processes, it
can't be simply the water or yeast or bacterial contamination from some
scratches in your bottling bucket, etc... Then, you can start adding
things back into the recipe, one at a time, for instance, swap in a
partial mash or whole mash but don't sparge - does the harshness reappear?  
Add in sparging, extra hop additions, etc... 


This will all take some time and you'll be brewing some pretty simple
boring beers in the beginning but believe me it'll be worth it in the end.
Besides, the time involved for these few batches (which you could scale
down in volume if you want to) pale in significance to your two years of
bad brewing experiences. 


DON'T GIVE UP! GOOD LUCK.

Subject: CO2 Monitor Source


This just fell out of my head.  


One of the questions originally asked in this thread had to do with CO2
monitoring devices to assist in assuring that no harm would come to
Canaries in the course of making this beer.  Brought to you by the ASPCA
Brewing Co.


Check out  http://www.greenair.com/cdmc.htm


They have a CO2 Monitor/Controller and a CO2 Digital Sequencer.  The
monitor reads from 0-2000 ppm (which is what, .2%?), and provides input
to the controller.  The controller can be used to operate exhaust
systems for venting excess CO2 accumulation in a number of applications,
although the basement brewery is not specifically listed. <Insert
standard disclaimer of warranty for particular purpose here.>  It does
talk about hospitals, classrooms, offices, auditoriums, laboratories and
mushroom culture facilities though, and in a sense the brewery is all of
these, no?


The equipment would be invaluable if the brewer had a lapse of
consciousness following a rigorous sampling session, for example, and
during the lapse, an earthquake struck, causing all of the CO2 tanks to
fall and shear the valves.  I'm thinking about a 50 lb., two 20s and a
5.  Now the basement has 6 or 8 inch reinforced concrete walls and floor
with dirt on the other side, so there's only a one in six chance for the
tank to escape the enclosure.  Chances are good that the tanks are
staying in the brewery and there's your recipe for disaster, the first
documented homebrewing fatality, and the attorneys will be knocking on
the widow's door.  I think the wife will let you buy the stuff now.

Subject: Drink-driving, Harsh brew, plum delicious


Brewsters:


Following my comments is the latest on what is happening
in Britain on (as they call it) drink-driving.  Some interesting
statistics. on the percentage of accidents caused by alcohol
influenced drivers.  I wonder what the numbers are here in the
 US?  This outline and website may be useful in constructing
a case in the US.


I  also think that while MADD is, perhaps, made up of a lot of
mothers whose children have killed themselves or been
killed by drivers under the influence and we understand
their source of anguish, do not let this distract you from the
real source of influence in changing these laws
 - the insurance companies. ( Remember the 55 mph
speed limit?).  MADD is, perhaps unknowingly, a front for
this movement.  Insurance companies have very powerful
lobbies worldwide whose job is to constantly reduce their
risk exposure. It is no coincidence that this same movement
is going on in Britain and here. Ask yourself why it is not
DADD (Dads Against Drunk Driving) or PADD (Parents against
Drunk Driving).  Just doesn't have the gut wrenching
emotional impact does it? MADD is well thought out.


German brewers are now under pressure to limit their
advertising to reduce drinking, supposedly.  Sound familiar
to Joe Camel fans?


I have to agree that those who exceed this blood alcohol
limit by several times are the ones who likely cause most
of the accidents, but where do you draw the line? Being
against this lowering of the alcohol blood level is like being
against - well - Motherhood.


OTOH I still think too many people are killed because they
went out to have a good time and died.  I believe it should
be the legal obligation of a bar to have available and the
legal support to enforce it,  a taxi in the city or a set of
drivers on call in the country to ferry people home, at the
drinker's expense, who aren't responsible enough in their
drinking to care about killing themselves or you or me.
This enforced "designated driver" law would be a boon to
all sides in this argument. There are practical aspects to this,
but a cash register could be designed to keep track of the
time and the number of drinks a patron had consumed.
This could be  be used as a signal to the bar to warn when
the patron had exceeded his time/drink limit and this would
prevent him being given another drink. Problems? - of course
 - but better than what we have now in which a bar has no
recourse to the legal responsibility if it serves a patron a
drink and he goes out and kills himself or worse - your kid.


Here is an extract from Breworld:


* Drink Driving
The brewing industry's campaigning to head off the proposed reduction in
the blood alcohol limit is gathering momentum. 




A report the BLRA has published Think Before You Cut the Limit points out


that: 




*The number of alcohol-related road deaths has fallen from 1,650 in 1979 
to
around 500 


*Drink-related deaths are one-seventh of the total road fatalities in the


UK 


* The vast majority of drink/drive deaths involve people not just above 
the
present limit, but double or treble it. 


*Speeding kills many more road users than drink, yet penalties are much
less severe 


*The additional risk of a driver at 50mg being involved in an accident is


very small - the equivalent risk of driving at 43mph in a 40 mph limit 


*Since the breathalyser was introduced in 1967, car ownership has more 
than
doubled but drink/drive deaths have fallen by 61%. 


The BLRA goes on to point out that, "cutting the limit is simply not
addressing the problem of the hard core of drink drivers. They will not 
be
deterred by a lower limit, only by tougher penalties and better 
enforcement
of the present law. 




"There is no reliable evidence to say that a lower BAC limit would 
actually
save lives. What it certainly would do is criminalise a large number of
sensible, careful motorists."


The BLRA have put the essence of their case on the internet.

Carm Salvatore complains about harshness in his beer
except for the two batches of wheat beer he has brewed.
With your water pH in the 9's you likely are extracting phenols
from the barley husks.  Wheat having no husks doesn't have
this problem, so that's why the wheat batches were OK.
You can easily isolate the problem by using distilled water
in your brewing of one batch of malted barley and see if this
problem goes away.  Also reduce all sparge water to a pH
of less than 6 to reduce the extraction of phenols/tannins
from the husk.


I'm no expert, but the pHs of 9.2 to 9.6 and the source of water
as a spring coupled with the apparently low levels of calcium
leads me to suspect that you have some kind of contaminant
like ammonia in your water supply. Perhaps sewage or manure
if you are on a farm is the source of this ammonia. If you boil
the water does the pH drop  to near 7.0?  Has this water
been tested biologically?

and make clarification easier. Adjust the specific gravity to
1.09 to 1.1 with boiled sugar syrup to get a stable wine.

What about nutrients, I've got this package of nutrient, but I'm not sure
whether to add it when adding the human to the primary or transferring to
secondary.  Is there at least any flat beer or yeast sediment to get you by
for a while.  


And finings.  People are big particles.  Probably need something bigger than
the common .5 to 5 micron filter.  Even straining him through a green
scrubbie pad would be tough.  


How long do you typically lager your human?  What's the correct serving
temp?  (I know, ask JeffDahmer, but that's a different digest)  


A good trick for getting a stopper out is to stick a coat hanger through it,
that would lead to an excessively messy carboy, and probably more spam.  


You think that getting stuck again would be enough to get him to switch to
plastic. (Oh no)
