Dear Brewers,


Last evening our homebrewclub had a meeting at my house and we sampled
eight English Bitters and Strong Ales which were taken home from a trip
to England a few weeks ago. On the labels the best before date was July
/ December 1998.
Four of the Bitters / Strong Ales had a little to strong taste of
chocolate! and some  port(-wine) notes.
Pedigree bitter from Marston  4.5 %
Bombardier premium bitter from Charles Wells  4.3 %
Black Sheep Ale from Paul Teakston's Black Sheep Brewery  4.4 %
Tangle foot strong ale from  Badger brewery 5 %


The others tasted fruity, hoppy, slightly malty.
King Billy Bitter from Cropton Brewery  3.6 %
6x from Wadworth Brewery  4.3 %
Golden Promise organic Ale from Caledonian Brewery  5 %
Old Speckled Hen strong ale from Morland Brewery  5 %


I thought portwine taste is a sign of aging. But the beers weren't old.
And what could caused the chocolate taste?  None of the beers had (even
a slight) taste of diacetyl.
I couldn't find "chocolate or port(wine) in Pale Ale (ClassicBeer
StyleSeries) nor in Evaluating Beer (Brewers Publications).


Please comment (what do the (home)brewers from the UK think?).


I don't have access to Internet (just E-mail).
TIA,  Greetings from Holland, Hans Aikema

Just to add my $0.02, the greater San Francisco Bay Area, and probably
most of the West Coast of California has water that is above pH 9 for
the majority of the year.  I think it's safe to say that folks are
still able to brew good beer with this type of soft municipal water.


BTW, don't those brewers at Red Hook know that protein rests are
detrimental with todays highly modified malts?  You would think that
professional brewers would be aware of basic information like this.
They're almost as bad as those stubborn German brewers that still use
decoction brewing even after the invention of the thermometer.  Don't
they know they're wasting their time?

Subject: Help with Eric's Raspberry Wheat.


In HBD #  2693,  Eric Bonney was worrying about his first raspberry wheat,
I have never posted to HBD before and saw this as a rare opportunity for me
to say something relevant and moderately interesting (and hopefully helpful
to Eric).  He had a ton of questions, I addresed some of them:


>        2.  I think the 8 oz of raspberry extract might have been  a bit
much,
>  but we will have to see.


With the Extracts from L.D. Carlson, you would use 1 bottle (4oz.) for a
hint of flavor and 2 bottles for a full flavor.  For a raspberry wheat, 8
oz. should be perfect.  Another note on those extracts, they contain no
fermentables and can and should be added at bottling (kegging) time.
Fermentation will diminish the delicate fruit aromas (CO2 scrubbing).

If your wort has been cooled you can pull out your trusty racking cane and
siphon off of the trub.  I do this with the addition of an aerating gizmo
attached to the other end of the siphon tubing (no hot break, instant
aeration).
A reason for leaving the hot break behind is the protein will end up as
chill haze in your finished beer, no big deal in a cloudy weizen.

Your hops will eventually settle.  Sometimes I use a hop bag , sometimes
not, I've never noticed a real difference other than the "hop sock" reduced
my utilization.

Starter, starter, starter, you would need to pour in 10 smack packs to get
the minimum recommended yeast count for a 5 gallon batch (or find a ready
to pitch liquid yeast like those from White Labs).


Hope it helps, and guys, please correct me if I'm wrong.

Subject: Husky Tannins


Brewsters:


AlK implies that barley husks do not contain tannin and that
I should be reading the modern version of Malting & Brewing
Science.  Well, I have both versions of M&BS. Personally,  I
think it is a plus that I began reading the first edition of M&BS  in
1971 when it was first published.


But AlK aparently didn't read far enough on p 96 Para 2
of M&BS 2nd ed or at least didn't put it in his comments.


The next sentence says:


"However, phenols also occur in the 'true' (barley) husk
and may be partly removed, together with other
components of 'testinic acid' mixture using alkaline steeps,
giving rise to less astringent beers."


My point was the alkaline water `at` pH = 9.2-9.6 would dissolve
these phenols, but they would remain in the beer and could be
the cause of the astringency. Wheat would contain the
other phenols from the aleurone and pericarp like barley,
but since wheat doesn't have a true husk unlike barley,
phenols from this source would not be present in the
wheat beers. And would explain the reason his wheat beers
were not uncommonly astringent.

   "Paradise seeds" *may* be what are known as Grains of Paradise,
Guinea Pepper, or Melegueta pepper.  The Boston Beer Company uses
them in their Summer Ale, and they were mentioned before that in
one of the _Zymurgy_ special issues (1994, I think) . I tasted one
once, and it seemed not entirely unlike Szechuan peppercorns to me--
spicy, peppery, and herb/floral aromatic.
   A quickie web search yielded a bunch of hits, including:

You will find that that the quantity of cold break in the slow cool 
method will be much lower than if a CF or Immersion chiller were 
employed.  I also would avoid the oxygen idea with very hot wort.  
You also could not get enought O2 into solution to satisfy the yeast 
requirements.  Stick with the CF chiller.

Boiling from 7 gals down to 5 gals is an evaporation rate of 29%!!  
Usual targets are 7-15% per hour, so the max I would aim for with a 
90 min boil is 20% evap.  I bet this could have an impact on final 
IBU numbers.


Prost!

This is a spice more commonly called "grains of paradise."  I've also seen
it called black cardamom and Guinea grains.  It originated in Africa, is
related to cardamom (of Asian origin), and both are in the ginger family,
_Zingiberaceae_. The scientific name is _Aframomom melagueta_.  It has an
aromatic, peppery aroma.  I have used it sparingly (3 grams in 7-1/2
gallons) in my ginger wit http://hbd.org/brewery/cm3/recs/09_85.html and
felt it gave a bit of additional complexity that was lacking when I left it
out, but it wasn't at all essential.


By the way, with warm weather approaching, let me encourage brewers to
consider brewing ginger wit, a great, refreshing summer beer.  This is a
traditional witbier recipe with the substitution of fresh ginger for orange
peel and lactic acid.  It gives a bit of the bite that the lactic acid
might, and the ginger is very refreshing.  It is popular with beer drinkers
and those who prefer a cooler-type drink.  The spice bill for *7.5 gallons*
is:
        3.2 oz peeled fresh ginger, pureed
               1 oz. freshly ground coriander
               5 g. freshly ground cardamom
               3 g. freshly ground grain of paradise


Check the web page for the full recipe.  If you can't get soft, white
winter wheat, soft red will do.  This beer evolves amazingly over months
and years.  At some points, the ginger predominates, at others the
cardomom.  Not too long ago here, someone claimed that wits don't age well,
and should be consumed in a few months.  Let me tell you, it ain't true, at
least with this one.  I just had a two year old one that was wonderfully
dry and complex.

     I believe Tinseth's IBU calculations come out correctly if you use the 
     actual 'best estimation' gravity of the boil.  In your example above, 
     I'd recommend starting with the average boil gravity.  For example, 
     try using 1.056, which is the average of the gravities for the pre- 
     and post-boil volumes.  This is the most commonly used technique.  If 
     Tinseth's web app or the program you are testing disagrees with the 
     results of finding the IBUs with this average gravity, then it's 
     probably worth talking to the appropriate author about it to get more 
     info on his/her assumptions.  You can also use Glenn's web page info 
     to calculate the IBU's by hand, and would probably find most of your 
     answers right there.
     
     Good luck and keep brewin'!

I have been using the Briess Pale Ale Malt for about a year now and I have
been incredibly pleased with all of the beers I have made with it. 


I am a big Marris Otter lover but have found over the last two years Marris
Otter has been really sending some poorly malted barley to us in the states.
I need consistancy with a malt and they can't seem to do that as of late. I
also like DeWolf Cousins but feel that their prices are way too high and it
is very eratic as to its malting quality and extraction rates. 


The Briess Pale Ale 2 Row is very consistant in my eyes. I have averaged 84%
extraction with it and have had no problems getting a good extraction with
the few single step mashes I have done (I mostly step mash). The color and
flavor of the malt are both excellent in my eyes. 


I have switched to this the Briess Pale Ale for all my ales and will
continue to use it as a primary base malt until they screw it up  or there
is a better more consistant malt out there. I feel that finally American
Maltsters have achieved the quality they were lacking before. I am sold!

     Hans asks about rinsing an Idophor sanitized fermenter, and wonders 
     about how much Idophor is necessary for sanitizing the _water_.  I 
     assume he is intending to rinse the fermenter with sanitized water.
     
     Anyway, I wanted to make a comment about Idophor first, then I'll 
     answer (TTBOMK) Hans' question about the water.  First, if nobody 
     warned you about the "Idophor Film" issue, then I will.  You'll notice 
     that when filling something like a carboy with an Idophor solution, 
     that a layer of bubbles forms in the neck of the carboy.  And the 
     bubbles tend to turn into some kind of a film that floats.  It doesn't 
     seem to hurt anything, but some people would prefer a clean, no film, 
     solution so they don't have to wonder about it.  Also, if you use 
     Idophor solution to sanitize bottles, then let them drip dry, you'll 
     see this 'film stuff' float to the top of the beer while you are 
     bottling.  The film tends to stick to the side of your filler and then 
     slides off.  I use a big pot to catch the drips, so after awhile I see 
     quite a few chunks of this 'film stuff' (whatever it really is) 
     floating around the bottom of the pot.  Again, it doesn't seem to hurt 
     anything, e.g. no infections, fermentations and carbonation all works 
     just fine.
     
     Now about the water.  It doesn't matter what you are sanitizing, the 
     required concentration is the same.  Using a weaker solution because 
     you are using 'clean' city water is probably no better than just using 
     plain city water.  Which by the way, is not a bad idea (got my flame 
     retardent clothing on today).  Here's what I do: sanitize everything 
     (well) with an Idophor solution.  I like it because I can _see_ it and 
     it doesn't bleach my jeans when I spill.  Then I rinse fermenters or 
     bottles with hot city water right before using them.  The reasoning is 
     that the various tubes and utensils that get sanitized don't seem to 
     add the 'film' to anything, so I leave them alone.  For the fermenter, 
     I figure the sanitizing is going to kill any infections residing in 
     the thing.  City water should have little to no infections in it.  I 
     use a good sized starter (minimum 1 quart) and depend on the ability 
     of the yeast to overwhelm any infections that may have come from the 
     city water.  This I believe, is a very fair assumption.  For the 
     bottles, I assume that the beer itself can do the same thing.  That 
     is, the Idophor solution leaves the bottles as sanitary as we can 
     expect at home, and the city water rinse (followed by a drip dry on a 
     bottle tree) is very unlikely to add any significant infection.  Given 
     that nothing serious can grow in beer, it follows that putting beer 
     into the just rinsed bottles is fine too.  
     
     Brian
     
     PS: Some people will argue that rinsing with city water is not a good 
     idea.  If you still have concerns, either just let the Idophor drip 
     dry (as recommended by the manufacturer), or do a rinse with a weak 
     chlorine solution and let your stuff drip dry.  I figure the city 
     water _is_ a weak chlorine solution and provides enough protection!

Subject: Pizza pan false bottom


Greetings brewers,


I asked this question on RCB and got a mixed response.  I also searched 
the HBD archives to no avail.  I recently purchased an Ecko pizza pan to 
use as a false bottom in a keg.  This particular pizza pan has dozens of 
holes already drilled in it.  I'm planning to drill several dozen more.  
The existing holes are just under 1/8", which when I compare it to my 
phil's phalse bottom, seem a bit large.  The phil's seems to have holes 
in the 1/16" range.  


Is 1/8" too large?  Will I have trouble clearing my runoff?  Has anyone 
out there used this type of pizza pan successfully?


Many thanks in advance,


Andrew Avis


PS - Although I have never brewed with cat puke, I have inadvertently 
included clumps of cat fur in my mash with no ill effect (more of it 
might actually work like rice hulls).  My dog has licked the inside of 
the mashtun while I wasn't looking.  My best beer had a spaghetti squash 
drop into the kettle.  Cheers to interesting ingredients!

Before you try your condom oxygen balloon for wort oxygenation, you better

Either use non-lubricated condoms, or


Make sure of the composition of the lubricant.


You don't want to introduce pure oxygen to oils.  A most disturbing explosion

Subject: What are "green flavors"?


Greetings from a novice (who is sampling bottles of his first batch every few
days in order to keeps tabs on developing flavors),


I've heard the term "green" beer and "green flavors," and was wondering
whether those refer to anything more than the "newness" of a brew.  In tasting
my beer after only two days in the bottle, I detected a strong hops flavor
strongly reminiscent of putting a hops pellet in my mouth.  To me, it was a
"fresh," "raw," "green" taste.  Is this what "green flavors" refers to?  Will
this mellow out or blend over time?  ( I used half an oz. Columbus hops in a
50 minute boil)  Also, can anyone direct me to some reading material
explaining what flavor developments occur during bottle conditioning?


Thanks,

Yakima Goldings refers to where they are grown, Yakima valley.  I am sure
that the broker that sold them was the Yakima chief.  They are not Kent
Goldings, they are US Goldings.  There is a difference.  Many "hop
experts" will tell you.  The biggest difference I have noticed, (with the
US varieties from the Yakima chief) is that their noble strains tend to
run high in alpha.  This disrupts the flavor profile of many styles of
beer, for one our pilsner.  It tends to have a more clinging bitterness,
and you can't derive as much hop character because of the alpha
adjustment.


Hope this sheds some light on the subject.

Andrew Henckler asks about experience w/ Briess 2 row pale malt. I have 
been using this malt as my base malt extensively this winter in American 
style pale ales. (I get a 50# sack for $25, courtesy of a friend who 
drives past a supplier on his work commute - thanks James!) I find it 
well suited to single-temp infusion. I get about a 75% yield, and that 
is without a satisfactory mash-out, which I am still working on. I use 
it for about 80% of the grain bill in an IPA that has been very well 
received in competition; in a maltier amber I made it gave a very nice 
full malty flavor, again w/ a single-temp infusion. I expect to continue 
to use it in these styles.

I've had this experience when using an extract kit from a supplier who adds
Irish Moss to the boil hops. This break stuff is so fine that it won't drop
at all. I've even taken the 3/4 gallon of slurry (for want of a better
expression) and let it sit in a one gallon extract bucket for two days
without it clearing more than 1/4 inch from the surface. Based on previous
posts, I'm going to try using a stainless steel mesh (scavenged from a
reinforced hot water hose) over a perforated copper tube. Previous attempts
with the ChoreBoy over the  end of the racking tube and pouring the dregs
into a filtered funnel have been unsuccessful.


I think that when I go to all grain, that leaving wort in the kettle won't
bother me as much as with these (relatively) expensive extract kits.

Subject: re:yakima goldings


These hops are in fact east kent golding rootstock transplanted to the
Yakima valley. There is a significant difference between the two (EKG vs.
Yakima Golding). Yakima, in my opinion, is more citrusy. East Kent has much
more resiny, candy-like qualities (EKG is great for dryhopping a british
ale!). I would say that Yakima Goldings is somewhere between an EKG and a
Cascade. It seems that alot of the hops from the yakima region share the
citrusy quality. Don't know why. Perhaps it's just a figment of my
imagination.


Yakima Golding is a decent hop in its own right. If you want a substitute
for EKGs, though, Styrian Golding would be closer. Some nice writing on
hops and their sensory evaluation can be found in the following books:
Homebrewing Vol.1, Al Korzonas; Using Hops, Mark Garetz; Zymurgy Special

Rich,


Yes, I have had both problems. I have a 7 gallon Rubbermaid (Gott) and mine
has warped a bit in the inside. I too used to use a stopper and tube set up
until one day I was fiddling around with it during the mash and pushed the
stopper into the hot mash! Hot wort and grain gushed out and of course made
its way in between the walls of the cooler and spoiled inside and smelled
absolutely horrible.


I was very upset and drilled a small hole in the bottom and poured straight
bleach in and let it sit for a few days and then rinsed with hot water. It
was a pain trying to get all the water in and out  but at least in doesn't
smell rotten any more!


My solution was to hook up a brass ball valve with a 1/2" nipple (fits
perfectly), into a tee and then into my slotted copper manifold. I sealed
the inside by getting some thick rubber gasket-making material from the
hardware/plumbing store and made a gasket to seal around the tee inside.
For the outside I fashioned a thick plastic washer out of PVC for the ball
valve to rest against and it works like a charm!


I suggests doing something like this because someday you are going to push
that stopper in like I did and burn your hand as well as infect the inside
of your cooler.

This isn't the first time I've disagreed with Lewis and I'm
sure it won't be the last.  If sweet stout is not made with
unfermentable sugar, then it must be pasteurised or sterile
filtered and then sweetened with simpler sugars.  Certainly
this is not a traditional way of making beer and most of us
homebrewers shudder when someone suggests pasteurisation or
sterile filtration as a step in making a beer.


>The connection between milk and health was used by

Whatever, but the source of the "milk" association with the
beer is that milk sugar was used to sweeten the beer.  That
is well-established.  Reading directly from a 1910 label
of Mackeson's Milk Stout: "Each pint contains the energising
carbohydrates of ten ounces of pure dairy milk."


That's "lactose" to you and me, Dave...

>peptonized (partially hydrolysed) milk."


If you taste Mackeson's XXX today, I assure you that a bottled
beer like this cannot be homebrewed without at least 1 pound
of lactose per 5 gallon batch (and it could be 2 pounds)...
I used but 8 ounces and it was only about 1/4 to 1/2 as sweet
as Mackeson's (luckily... I don't really like overly sweet stout).


 ...regardless of what the marketing suits or patents say.

Ahh... therein is the problem.  It wasn't in Britain... it was
on a ship in the Caribbean.  I did not get to keep the bottle
so I don't know if it was brewed under contract in the Caribbean
or whether it was brewed in England and labeled this way for
export only.  Jackson and Protz confirm that the use of "Milk"
on the label was made illegal in Britain in the 1960's.  Sounds
about as stupid as the gov't officials here in Illinois that allow
half-filled gasoline tanker cars to drive 70 miles an hour on
Chicago highways, yet won't allow a train carrying napalm through.
Or those senators that think they can justify a 10-round limit
on rifle clips because the kids used a 15-round clip.  I'm sure
they would not have shot those kids and teacher if they only had
10-round clips...  we sure have the stupidest, most gutless government
money can buy.


So, Dave is right about the "milk" law.  However, if you believe Lewis,
only a small amount of lactose is used in sweet stouts.  I tend to
believe my tastebuds, Jackson (New World Guide p.171, where he says that
lactose is used in the kettle and at bottling and the beer is NOT
pasteurised or filtered) and Protz (Ale Trail p.247-248, where he says
that Mackeson's contains about 9% lactose -- he also notes here and on
page 112 of Classic Stout and Porter, that although the beer has an OG
of 1.042, it ferments down to only 3% abv... a testament to the amount
of gravity imparted by the unfermentable lactose).

Either Narziss has been reading Fix or great minds think alike.  Fix
has posted on this topic several times over the last 8+ years and I
believe the very first post to HBD which featured Dr. Fix's comments
was when I quoted (with permission) a private correspondence with

I'm not convinced that Duesseldorfer Altbiers are indeed very well
attenuated... my tastebuds indicate otherwise, especially with Zum
Uerige.  Yes, I've seen Piendl's data, but remember that his lab was
at Weihenstephan and Zum Uerige is:


1. pretty far away in Duesseldorf,
2. unpasteurised,
3. served from casks by gravity, like cask-conditioned real ale, and
4. the bottling line is not 100% sanitary (half-liter swing-top bottles
closed *by hand*).


I contend that the most traditional Altbiers from Duesseldorf may have
attenuated further on the way to Munich to be tested.  (Just my little
theory.)

I told you it wouldn't be the last time...  I'm with you Jim (although
I'm not even a rocket scientist).  I feel that Dr. Lewis may be a
brilliant researcher and know an awful lot about brewing, but I suspect
his views tend to get clouded by his megabrewer-centric biases.
