Actually, I have read this here, but have never seen it in scientific
literature.  Doesn't mean it is wrong, just that it is difficult to 
explain
unless the oxidised melandoins were oxidised during the boil ( for 
example)
and then these react with alcohol after it is formed in fermentation at a


much later time.  I would like to hear a good discussion of the kinetics 
of
this reaction. Other pathways are also theoretically possible in which 
the
oxidised melandoins break down to aldehydes - a prospect I find more
likely.


>No, wait... I'm *sure* ethanol doesn't have the highest affinity for
>the oxygen... the aldehyde of ethanol is acetaldehyde, right? 




Yes and acetaldehyde is the "sherry" taste. Oxidation of ethanol produces


acetaldehyde and sherry tastes.  Oxidation of acetaldehyde produces 
acetic
acid. This can form the ester with ethyl alcohol to give ethyl acetate or


nail polish remover.

Well I don't entirely agree with your logic.  Suppose all the alcohols 
were
the same potential  then you would still get these aldehydes of fusel 
oils
and other sources. It is also likely that many of these do not come
directly from alcohols, so that further disturbs the logic.  Also, we 
have
differing sensitivities to all kinds of chemicals, so what we detect with


our noses is not a representative example of the concentration in the
liquid..


I know that esters form during storage.  I recently had a sorgenkindern
(problem child) Merlot that had a funky taste that I presumed had come 
from
oxidation but the components of the aroma were not clear.  A year in the
bottle and it smells like nail polish remover, so there isn't much doubt
that esterification occurred in the bottle.

Alan T quotes Dr. J.R. Harrison's discussion of stout and Harrison says:


>There is no doubt about the origin of stouts. When high gravity porters
began
>to be produced in the early nineteenth century they were called 'stout
>porters'. The adjective 'stout' was carrying its old English meaning of
>'strong' [1]. Some brewers then began to drop the word porter as
unnecessary,
>leaving just stout. 




Of course, he is dead wrong on this, as one of my quotes ala Lewis
indicated that the adjective "Stout" was often applied to beers and ale 
in
the 17 century and likely before that. He is also wrong about the grist 
for
Irish Stouts.

Someone mentioned using Solarflo burners.  I use one too, a 24 jet 
slotted cap burner I bought in '91.  At the time they sold direct to 
individuals, since then I have had friends denied service from them.  
I think its for liabilty reasons.  That said, for large systems I 
would advise looking at Wok burners, much cheaper than Solarflo and 
evey bit as good compared with impinged jet burners.  You can get em 
for around $50 new from restaurant supply houses.  Best for 20 gal+ 
systems.


For smaller units I also would go with the Superb.


Been interesting to read about the Big 12 brew.  I think it will be 
fun to hear what the physical data, post fermentation reveals.  
Final gravities in particular Id like to know, as O2, mashing and 
yeast variations will have large effects on the final beer.  I wonder 
if ever in the history of North America have so many gallons of 
barleywine ever been frementing at once!

greeting fellow beerlings,


i brewed the big 10/20 barly wine on saturday. i split it between 2 carboys
because of the explosive blow off i had heard about. it was a good thing
too, each carboy was 1/2 filled with foam and it was (emphasis on was)
bubbling like crazy.


it now appears that the initial ferment is over, time to add the champagne
yeast. how do i do a starter for the champagne yeast or is it better to
just pitch a pack into each carboy?

Subject: Confusion over delta T


I'm in the planning process for RIMS construction.  Many
thanks to the replies I received two weeks ago regarding
various questions I posted then.


My current question may be simple, but isn't just a RIMS
issue.


Most RIMS target a rate of Temperature increase of 1-1.5
Degrees a minute.  Many non-RIMS all-grain brewers who do
stepped infusion mashes do so by either heating the mashtun
or by adding a measure amount of water at a specific 
temperature to reach the target goal.  (my former method.)


I've seen conflicting information lately regarding the 
good/bad of quick temperature changes.  Basically, anything
over 1 degree or so a minute being *bad* and causing undesired
early sacharification of the mash.


This would imply that the 'add so many quarts of X temp water'
method is a *bad* thing, but it *does* work and *has* proven
to be a usable process for making good & great beer.


ObRIMS


I've been contemplating a non-standard heating chamber using an
external mounted (wrapped) heat source (tape or ceramic) that
gets wrapped around the pipe.  However, some of these beasties
have pretty high temps.  A good flow rate would help reduce the
(proposed) risk, but I dunno.  Has anyone tried this method?




Can someone *please* clear up my confusion on this?  Is a quick
immediate jump to the target temperature (by overshooting and letting
it average out..) as bad as some would say?


Why or why not?




Many thanks in advance!  This issue is holding up my brewing
and my reserves are running out... :-(

Subject: repitching from the same batch?


Has anyone ever repitched a batch from the primary to the secondary?


I have a lager which is just putting along very very slowly.  Most likely
due to low pitching rate.  
I decided to rack it to the secondary, wash the yeast left behind in the
primary, and add it back to the secondary.


The secondary fermenter is now bubbling along again, hopefully faster
than before.  I tried not to aerate it while racking.

Firstly, I take pride in being one of those "BJCP types" and
to the best of my knowledge, no official BJCP statement has
been issued regarding any beer being or not being representative
of a style.


Secondly, if a beer is a classic from the native country where
the style was born, you will not have any argument from us
"BJCP types" that the beer is representative of the style.
However, when British brewers create 1.035 beers and call them
"IPAs" then the brewer needs a little perspective adjustment.


You may have had a problem with one person who happened to be
in the BJCP, but besides Dennis Davision, who is the current
BJCP President, no one person speaks for the BJCP.  I've judged
with some very high-ranking BJCP judges who were jerks and
had little interest in much beyond their own ego, but a few
bad apples don't spoil the whole bunch.


As far as I can tell, all of the people in the BJCP Beer Style
Committe are level-headed and genuinely interested in making
the style guidelines as accurate and representative as possible.
I'm probably the most impulsive of the whole group, but we all
keep each other in check and I'm sure the guidelines (the first
pass of which has just gotten up to category 17, incidentally)
will be very good if not excellent.  If we goof up (and we probably
will make a few mistakes), we'll accept suggestions from anyone
(really!) who wants to make improvements to the guidelines.  I'm
afraid I'll have to vote against lowering the OG of IPAs to
1.035 if any of you have that suggestion in mind...

Perhaps he meant that as you boil off more water, the gravity *and* bitterness
would go up.  Then again, most brewers would add water back to reach 5
gallons, so that's probably not it... no, it sounds like another misguided
homebrew supply shop owner.  You're right... the hop extract they add is

Subject: Re: stout/porter and another opinion 


I do find it interesting, however, that the Oxford English Dictionary
includes the following quotes in support of its definitions for stout
and porter (as types of beer).  In each case, the first is the
earliest known (to the editors of the OED) quote containing the word
in that meaning.


For stout:


    1677 R. Hawtrey Let., Egerton MS. 2716 We will drink your healths
        both in stoutt and best wine.  


    A. 1700 B. E. Dict. Cant. Crew, Stout, very strong, Malt-Drink. 


For porter:


    1727 Swift Further Acc. E. Curll Wks. 1755 III. i. 161 Nursed up
    on grey peas, bullocks liver, and porters ale.


Note that the earliest usage of "stout" to refer to a beer precedes
the earliest usage of "porter" by more than 25 (and maybe 50) years.
That's not to say that the "stout" of 1677 was in any way similar to
the "stout" of today.  In fact, the 1700 quote from a dictionary,
defining "Stout" as a "very strong malt drink", implies that it was
used as we might use "barley wine" today.


I think I'll sit firmly on the fence, and say:


* "Stout" preceded "Porter" as a name for a kind of ale.
* "Stout Porter" became the beer we now know as "Stout".

From: Troy Hager <thager`at`bsd.k12.ca.us>
Subject: Boil Roll and Evaporation Rate


HBDers,


With all this talk about burners, I have been contemplating the boil
evaporation rate that I have seen using my Cajun Cooker and a 1/2 barrel
keg as my kettle. In all of the literature I have read, the recommended
rate of evaporation is 10% of your starting volume - if you start with
10gal you should end with 9 at the end of the boil and have boiled off one.
Evaporation reduces volume, increases gravity, and reduces DMS.


Another issue is getting a "rolling" boil to facilitate hop extraction and
protein coagulation.


Fix says in Analysis of BT, "The key to successful wort boiling is to avoid
excess and to find a balance. Extracting hop constituents and removing DMS
require at least some thermal loading. We found that percent of volume
evaporation during the boil is a very useful control parameter." They state
as guidelines that "The best general recommendation is an evaporation rate
of 9-11%. In all cases, avoid evaporation rates in excess of 15%" and that
"also striking is the number of times the negative effects from (excess
evaporation) are incorrectly identified as problems in fermentation."


Well, with my setup, a moderately rolling boil will evaporate about 1 gal
per hour. I brew 5 gal batches and usually start with about 7 gal in the
kettle and at the end of the 90 min boil I am left with 5.5 gal.  1.5/7 =
21.4% evaporation rate - way over the recommended 10%


I have cut it down to a very low boil (*barely* rolling) and come up with a
rate at about 15%.


I'm sure most of you brewing 5 gal batches in converted kegs have this same
dileama. Those who brew 10 gal batches probably can come closer to the
magic 10% number because of the greater initial volume.


So, what am I to do?


1. Cut my boil to almost no roll and try to get close to 10% evaporation at
the expense of hop extraction and protein cagulation.


2. Bump the boil up to a medium roll and live with evaporation that is way
over the recommended rate.


3. Cover the kettle partially to allow a more rolling boil and to lower the
evaporation rate to 10%. BTW, isn't this essetially what the pros do? Their
kettles are partially covered with a vent tube to carry off the
evaporations, aren't they? To simmulate this design, how about something
like a wok top with a hole cut in it to allow a limited evaporation? I have
heard so much about "NEVER cover the boil!"  I personally don't see
anything wrong if you partially cover your boil and hit about 10%
evaporation rates. This would be enough to drive off the DMS - correct?


4. Or, say "screw it" and stop being so anal (although this is the home of
the anal brewer, myself included of course!).


Personal email encouraged! Thanks!!!

at Wal-Mart w/a fish frying kit.  I can live w/o the fish kit, so maybe
Menards is the way to go.  Rick, where are you located at?

Subject: Cheap Burners


My home has an electric stove which is barely acceptable for brewing.
Last summer I spotted a propane burner w/stand in ElRosario, Baja California
for 180 pesos.  Burner is cast iron and has the name Murillos on it.  With
a high pressure regulator it kicks out alot of heat, perhaps 100K BTUs.
180 pesos is about $25 US, add another $20 US for the regulator and I'm
cookin' for less than fifty bucks.  I use my BBQ propane tank for fuel.
