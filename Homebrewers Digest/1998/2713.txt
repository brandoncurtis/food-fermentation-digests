I replied to Chris' original question off-line, but others may also be
interested.  I have a listing of the ingredients of the most common
"nutrients" and "energizers" on my web pages,
http://www.best.com/~smurman/zymurgy.  These are posted with the
permission of the manufacturers (unlike some of the other data on my
pages;).  The most common ingredient by far is diammonium phosphate
(DAP).  I'll leave it to someone who actually remembers chem class to
explain how that can be beneficial to yeast, but I did find it
interesting that DAP will actually lower pH, although with the amounts
used it's probably negligible in practice.

This is a commonly seen phenomenon.  I do Dr. Beer (TM--Jay Hersh) tastings for
my club, judges-in-training, and occaisionally other groups, and I see this 
quite often.  IMneverHO there is no shame in not being able to detect compound
X, it seems to be something you are stuck with.  I, for example, have never 
tasted a beer that tasted like cloves (4-vinyl guaiacol).  I can say from doing
this that I know exactly what DMS tastes/smells like both by itself and in beer,
and at various concentrations (many compounds, and DMS in particular, have very
different smells at different concentrations).  I can also say that I have at 
least average sensitivity to it.

Subject: Homemade CaraPils / DMS


     Hi all,
     
     Jon down under asks about making cara-pils malt.  Cara-pils is really 
     just a light form of crystal malt, so the instructions I posted the 
     other day apply (soak pilsner malt to ~45% moisture, bake the covered, 
     wet malt at 145-160F (63-71C) for an hour or more, then uncover while 
     still heating to dry it.)
     
     The hotter and longer the drying heat is applied, the darker the malt 
     becomes (Maillard reactions).  If you want to make the lightest 
     possible crystal malt, check it often during the saccharification 
     rest; it will darken then, too, so don't over do it.
     
     To get the lightest possible malt you could then dry the malt at the 
     same temperature you saccharified at, or experiment with different 
     temperatures.  I can say from experience that drying at 87F (30.5C) 
     did make a very light crystal malt, but it didn't taste quite right.  
     It also took a few days to dry, even with a fan blowing air over it.
     -------------------------------------
     DMS has been discussed a bit here lately, so I'll throw my .02 into 
     the ring.
     
     A great way to learn about how much DMS is formed during the boil is 
     to can some starter wort.  Boil the wort in a Mason jar, allow it to 
     cool, then open it up and smell/taste it.  To my nose, it goes beyond 
     the somewhat pleasant cooked corn smell and enters the realm of 
     overcooked vegetables.
     
     That is what could happen to your beer if you boil it without allowing 
     evaporation.
     
     Of course, none of us do that.  DMS boils at 100F (38C), so as long as 
     the lid is open a bit, it should blow off fine.
     
     Slow cooling in a covered pot will definitely allow a lot of DMS to 
     remain in the wort, though.  On rare occasions I have split the brew 
     day into two sessions, day one ending with the kettle filled with hot 
     wort at ~200F (93C).  The next morning the wort reeks of DMS (it also 
     has a ton of break material; a vigorous boil is not necessary if you 
     give it enough time to form.)
     
     Of course, I boil the wort on day two, so all of that DMS does get 
     blown out.  Just another data point.
     
     Have fun!

Jim,You didn't tell us some pertinent info. Grist  (or extract)
formulation and OG are relevant, but in any case 1.010 doesn't sound too
high. Have you made this particular beer before? Same beer, different
yeast? (some other yeasts may attenuate further) At 38-40F, 2308 is still
going to (slowly) keep fermenting. I've got a 1.047 Pils, 6% Munich,
balance 2row, with a TG of 1.010, fermented by 2308, going right now.So
you're probably OK to go as is, but regarding Q#1, those 'aley' things
get formed during vigorous fermentation in nutrient-rich wort. There
isn't going to be much for those yeasties to get in an uproar about in
your beer now, even if you _are_ .004 above TG.As to Q#2, there's
probably going to be enough yeast to do the job, but you could have a
wait on your hands. Adding krausen beer (active starter, Q#3,) requires a
SWAG on your part to determine how much fermentable extract you're
adding. I'd recommend adding a)a bit of dried yeast, or b)some slurry
from the bottom of a starter, along with your primingsOh yeah, and BB98

Well, we're here to have fun talking about it.  Oddly enough, that's what
those guys are doing.  If thinking about Mallard reactions (quack) and
organo-bio-magnetohydrodynamic-whatsis gets them excited and interested,
and helps them feel like brewing, let's just page down and let them go
at it.

Greetings,
        Newbie brewer, middl'ing lurker here. My first batch is to be an American
Brown extract. I am not going with a kit as my prodigious lurking has, I
believe, prepared me for a great start. Thanks to all.
        My question is: I am starting with a 10 gallon batch. Do I simply double
the amount of Wyeast American Chico called for in the 5 gallon recipe (1 pkg
for 5 gallon) or is there some law of physics and / or  biochem of which I
am, perchance, unaware (this would not be a shock on this end). <Recipe is
from Meow Ch. 01, pg. 19>

Tim-
Don't get discouraged by the HBD muckity-mucks.  I too, have had tons of
chemistry in college.  I worked in a pharmaceuticals research lab, yadda,
yadda, yadda.  I graduated with a double major in biology and chemistry, but
am an engineer by trade.  I'm not trying to give you my resume, just set the
stage:  I rarely read the posts on water chemistry, and feel guilty
about paging down through all the ene-ol, al vs yde, hot potato(e) passing
parties and other techno-babble.  I like George.  All these guys have got it
going on, and I'm sure they enjoy brewing as much as I do.  But by being a
chemist by training, and an engineer by trade, I don't even know for sure what
my brewhouse efficiency is.  I should be able to calculate and hit an OG, and
adjust my hops bitterness according to my % utilization, but I DON'T.
The HBD has a few rotating threads that get beaten to death periodically:
Boiling ferocity, propane vs natural gas, hops toxicity, etc.- which reminds
me- the botulism thread is about due.  Anyway, along with these cycles is a
periodic sniping session.  People get fat and happy, and start lipping off,
while other people just wait for their opportunity to try to prove somebody
else is wrong.  I myself recently considered blasting a couple of idiots ;)
for misspelling potato, and missidentifying a good band (*Third* Eye Blind,
not *One* Eye Blind)!  Who cares!?  Make and drink good beer!?


What I'm trying to say is this:  Go all grain.  Do full wort boils.  Have fun.
Don't worry whether your beer matches a style.  Throw in some Kellogs Corn
Flakes.  Use Tapioca granules.  Make an Oktoberfest with ale yeast.  Ask the
simplest all grain questions to the HBD.  Brew by the seat of your pants.


If, one day, you decide to go techno, calculate water ions, hit bitterness
units, calculate % volume loss from the kettle, and/or strictly abide by style
guidelines, it'll probably improve your beer.  But you don't have to.

Greeting Brewers!


I took a hydrometer reading Tuesday night before the club meeting and the
adjusted figure was 1.027. Gee, I guess that oxygen and 2 cups of brewpub
slurry really did its thing! 69 points in 10 days. not bad. Tonight I'll
rack and start a champagne yeast starter. If I can get a few more points
out of the Nottingham should I skip the champagne? BTW, I think that was
the best hydrometer sample I've ever drank! Full bodied (Too Full?) Thick
even. Hop bitterness was there, Alcohol and smooth....This is going to be
good!!


So, between the two all grainers at Big Brew we collected and combined 5
gals of 2nd runnings in a water jug with the intent to boil later. We
didn't. I stuffed a couple of cheesecloths in the neck and took it home to
reboil Sunday and can for starters. I didn't. Monday, I didn't. Tuesday, I
didn't. Wednesday night it had a head on it. No surprise there. So now I
have this unbioled wort of unknown gravity spontaneously fermenting in the
garage (Not my Fermentation room, but directly under my 2-tier). So after
reading my new Michael Jackson book for the last week, I'm thinking of
dropping in a pound or two of liquid wheat malt extract and calling it a
p-lambic. Any thoughts from the great collective? Am I pouring money down a
batch of Dumperbrau? What is the effect of not boiling at all?

Subject: Re: Cooler mash/lauter tun; Big Brew Small Beer


Tim and Rich bring up questions of mashing and lautering in the same 
vessel.  I mash and lauter in an Igloo 5-gal cylindrical cooler with 
a Phil's false bottom.  I rarely have trouble with stuck sparges, and
when I do, it occurs with decoction mashes, which tend to be denser 
from being boiled.  As I see it, the great advantage of a cooler
mashtun is the simplicity of mashing and lautering in the same vessel.


As I understand it, one stirs the mash to ensure an even temperature
and even distribution of enzymes.  I stir well at mash in and once or
twice over the course of the mash.  I've occasionally had grain find its
way under the false bottom, but since I've taken a piece of siphon hose
the legnth of the circumference of the false bottom and slit it 
lengthwise to wrap around the edge of the false bottom as a seal between 
the cooler wall and the false bottom, I haven't had much grain underneath.




Doug Geiss asks if anyone else did a small beer in cinjunction with the 
big brew.  I did.  From 12 lbs of grain, I wound up with 2.5 gals of
1.100 Big 10/20 Barleywine and 2.5 gals of 1.040 "Little 5/10" Bitter.

Subject: HomeMade Crystal & Cara-Pils


Jon Bovard asks about homemade cara-pils:


"        Noonan mentions the process briefly in the brewing bible "Lager
beer", but does anyone have a process for making cara-pils malt in a home
environment. I for one, want to try :)....."


For Jon's information, Cara-Pils as most of us know it is simply a very light
crystal malt.  It is slightly sweet and lends body, mouthfeel, and foam.  It
may look like amber malt, but if you chew a few grains and don't break your
teeth, it's not Cara-Pils.


I posted my procedure a while back, and George de Piro echoed with his similar
approach, but it's short & easy and I'll summarize here:


1)  Soak pale malt overnight in the fridge to prevent spoiling.  Use at least
2 cups *dechlorinated* water per pound of grain (one liter per kilogram).


2)  Preheat oven to 150F - 170F (65C - 75C).  Some ovens don't go this low but
use your lowest setting and try to keep in this range.


3)  Spread the malt out in a thin layer on a cookie sheet & cover tightly with
foil to retain the moisture.


4)  Bake for 3 hours.  It takes a while for the malt to heat up and then to
"mash" in the husk.  Don't let the malt go over 170F.  Perhaps you could stick
a thermometer in the grain to help guide you if your oven won't maintain this
low temperature; you might have to turn your oven on and off to keep the malt
temperature in the right range.


5)  Uncover the malt.  If you taste the grains, they should be noticibly
sweet.  Now you will want to bake the wet crystal malt dry.  The baking or
"curing" temperature and duration will determine the color and depth of
flavor.  For Cara-Pils, keep the temperature where it is (and cure longer).
For darker crystal malts, raise the temperature anywhere up to 350F.


6)  Sample the malt occasionally while curing.  Take a few grains out and let
them cool for a minute or so before tasting (besides the grains being hot, the
sugars can be soft and give the illusion that the grain is still wet).  When
the grains are hard and crunchy, no longer damp, and have the desired color,
you're done.  This process can take another hour to several hours depending on
the temperature used and the color desired.

HBD,


What should be the pH range of a finished, unprimed beer?  I'm afraid I
over acidified my sparge (first time using phos. acid).  Tasting the wort
gave that same "puckering" taste/reaction that straight lemon juice does.
It's around 4.8 - 5.0, I think.  Ignore it?  Late CaCO3 addition?

I think you'll agree that this sort of thing is unusual on the HBD. The
majority of the time everyone is quite civil to one another. I'm sure Dr. Fix
learned a long time ago what I am just beginning to learn: when you are in the
public eye, you need to have thick skin. Don't let this debate in anyway
discourage you from trying all-grain brewing.

I am a man of some education (a B.A. and M.Div.), but I realized long ago (in
high school) that chemistry was definitely NOT for me. It was by far my worst
class. It just never clicked with me for whatever reason. My hat is off to
those who have made it their life's work.


>If that is what I have to look forward to if I switch to all-grain brewing,
>I want no part of it.


If I had to understand all the chemistry stuff that gets tossed about on the
HBD to brew all-grain, I would have long since burned all my brewing equipment.
I've learned a lot from the HBD and I'm eager to learn more. Having said that,
I neither care nor need to know all the chemistry behind brewing (especially
seeing as so much of it is not well understood!), just as I don't need to know
how to reassemble my Oldsmobile's 3.1 V6 on the molecular level to drive, nor
do I need to know how the complete Pentium instruction set to run my computer.


One of the wonderful things about homebrewing is that there is ample room for
those who brew only occasionally with extract-based kits, all the way to those
who have a deep, burning need to know every last chemical reaction that goes on
in any stage of brewing. Hallelujah! The homebrewing community is better and
richer for having both groups and everyone in between.


The key is brewing beer you like and enjoying the process. You can say what you
will about Charlie's much-maligned NCJoHB (and a lot of people have!), but his
easy-going attitude toward homebrewing is what made it so inviting in the first
place. It's very easy for the life and fun to get sucked out of homebrewing
until I start having flashbacks of junior-year Chemistry and begin to twitch
uncontrollably.


Brew it, man! It may not come out perfectly, you may not be able to absolutely
perfectly reproduce every recipe, but I'll bet the farm that you'll like--even
love--the beer and learn to enjoy all-grain brewing as much as I have.


Sorry about the bandwidth, but I felt it needed to be said.

Subject: cooler mashing


In response to the folks who are worried that they need to use separate
mash and lauter tuns even if they are using coolers...


Well, I can't imagine mashing in one cooler and transferring to a
separate one for the lauter.  The whole reason I switched to a Gott-type
cooler was to do everything in one insulated vessel.  I have not had a
single set mash, even when working with rye malt, high proportions of
wheat malt and rice.  You will need to stir the mash.  This ensures an
even temperature and allows you to get accurate temp readings.  It also
allows you to adequately hydrate the grain at mash in.  If you are
really concerned about stuck mashes, just pour some hot water into your
drain tube and back-flush the manifold, but I would try just lautering
first.  Usually a set mash is due to an improper grain crush or using
ingredients that are difficult to work with, not from your lauter tun.

Subject: HSA, Miller and Boiling


Hey I finally disagree with Al, on a minor point.


Al K. Wrote in HBD2712:
"I read all of Miller's books and don't recall him mentioning oxidation
of hot wort at all. "


I posted the following in Compuserve's Beer/Wine forum Feb 13th, 1998,
in a discussion with Mark Garetz, who also doesn't believe HSA can
produce the Wet Card Board flavor. My Edition of Miller's book is
1988(?).


Start Re-post**************************


>From Miller's "The Complete Handbook of Home Brewing", Chapter 27, pages
181-182,


"One of the commonest symptoms of oxidation is a cardboard flavor caused
by 2-trans-noneal, a long-chain unsaturated aldehydes with low sensory
threshold...Besides yeast, all beers contain other substances which tend
to counteract oxidation. Technically, they are known as reductones; the
melanoidins and some of the phenolic compounds in beer fall into this
class. They work by tying up oxygen that might otherwise cause harmful
changes...One reason hot wort should not be aerated is that oxidizing
reductones at this stage renders them unavailable for later service.
Furthermore, oxidized melanoidins and polyphenols can later reverse
themselves and act as 'Oxygen carriers' which actually bring about
oxidation...Beer can be oxidized in the bottle by these compounds, even
if you are careful to avoid dissolving air during racking and bottling."


He goes on to say dark beers have more melanoidins than pales and are
more likely to be oxidized. Also, that Polyclar was originally developed
to remove oxidative browning from white wines.


So what I read into the above is that HSA is bad not because it will
oxidize your beer directly, but because it ties up the compounds which
can prevent oxidation. Also, if they are saturated, they might actually
be a source for the later oxidation and staling.

On boils, evaporation, etc. 


OK, I admit it, I had to pull the Heat Transfer book out on this one.
The Free convection pool boiling we are all familiar with come in
basically 3 varieties of which we are interested in only 1:


Nucleate: Standard Boiling, Liquid is slightly above saturation temp
(Due to hydrostatic considerations), temperature of the liquid is lowest
near the _bottom_ of the pot. Localized transition of liquid to vapor
phase occurs on nucleation (Rough spots) sites. The Vapor, once created,
is bouyant and heads straight for the surface, and since the liquid
surrounding it is actually above the Saturation temp, it will not reduce
the size of the bubble. 


To get a good rolling boil, with minimal heatloading (Delta T between
the pot bottom and the Wort) one should maximize the surface roughness,
or add nucleation sites, say boiling chips. This will also help make a
good transistion between heating and boiling. I have to admit that I
haven't worried about this in the past, since I have always tried to
reduce my volume from 6.5-7 gallons down to 5-5.5, due to my collection
volume.


Truely excessive heat loading leads to transition boiling and film
boiling. Film boiling is real bad, since a layer of saturated vapor
clings to the boiling surface, increasing the temperature of the solid
surface, while reducing the actual heat transfer rate. Liquid to vapor
transition occurs along the transition between the vapor liquid line in
the bottom of the pot. Transition boiling is a combo of film and
nucleate. I believe this would occur most often with a low conductance
metal (Stainless Steel) and a non uniform heating system (Electric coil
and, emphatically, electric immersion heaters). Where film boil occurs,
I expect that it will leave behind preciptates, which will then over
heat and carmelize.


I Promise I'll add extra nucleation sites (Most likely marbles or SS
nuts) in my next wort (Saturday) and see if I can't keep a good "Rolling
boil" while reducing the actual bubble size and delta T from brew pot to
wort.

Subject: Champagne yeast for BIG BREW


Doug asks about Champagne yeast for the BIG BREW.


Wyeast sells a Champagne yeast in a slap pack.  It may be their
dry mead yeast.  Not all retailers carry it, but all can order it
for you.


Now, on the other hand, I don't recommend adding the Champagne yeast...
it will dry out the Barleywine too much.  I would just keep adding
more of the original pitching yeast every time the fermenter starts
to slow down (within reason).  I did use dry yeast (Nottingham in
three carboys and Windsor in three) and mine are almost finished
with the primary...  If you had enough oxygen in the wort and pitched
enough yeast (like a gallon starter per 5 gallons!!!), then you
probably won't need the Champagne yeast.


I couldn't make a small beer because I had to clean out my mashtuns
to use as kettles.  As it was, I already had used up every empty
carboy in the house (21.6 gallons of 1.099 Barleywine)!

  I've started mashing last fall and have since brewed about 12 batches,
so I guess I'm still quite new to the all-grain thing. To answer your
first question, yes, you can use the 5 gallon Igloo for both mashing and
lautering. That's what I've been doing and it works like a charm. The only
problem I found with the 5 gallon Igloo cooler as a mash tun is that it is
a bit small. I live at 5,500 ft elevation and water boils at 200F, so I
have to infuse a lot of boiling water to raise the mash to mash-out
temparature. Unless I ommit this step, I have to limit the amount of grain
I use (about 10 lbs is the limit, which means the stongest beer I can brew
has an og of < 1.058). There are two solutions: 1) start buy the 10
gallon Igloo, or 2) do decoction mashing, then you can use up to 13.5 lbs
of malt in your 5 gallon cooler and rest at a number of different
temperatures (the strongest beer with this technique would be somewhere
around 1.075). Of course, decoction really only makes sense for certain
styles of beer, but since I love Altbier, that's what I do. 
  A few lessons learned are, avoid splashing the wort as you lauter, if
you're not, the beer will likely have wet cardboard flavor (my first two
all-grain beers had), lauter very slowly, I usually run off 6.5 gallons of
wort in about 90 minutes, this ensures good extraction and the also keeps
the wort pretty clear, recirculate the wort before you start collecting
it, that makes sure that you have a good filter bed, and the collected
wort will be clear (I recirculate the wort for about 5 to 10 minutes and
while I do that I reduce the flow rate to what gives me a 90 minute lauter
session), while you lauter, keep the lid on your lauter tun losely,
that'll keep the temperature from dropping during lautering, cut the grain
with a long bread knife in a criss-cross pattern about 4 inches deep every
5 minutes or so, it avoids channeling, helps to avoid stuck mashes and
improves extraction a bit. And finally, always keep a gallon or so of
water boiling while you mash, so you can infuse some water to raise the
temperature of the mash (during a 90 minute saccrification rest the
temperature in the 5 gallon Igloo will drop a few degrees, so periodically
check the temperature of the mash).
  I found that a *very* good reference for beginning mashers is the
article 'A cooler way to ease into all-grain mashing' by John Palmer in
Brewing Techniques Vol. 5, No. 4., I always use the formulas given in that
article to compute the water temperatures for mash-in and infusions. 
Another great reference, is Greg Noonan's 'New Brewing Lager Beer', I
contains a great deal of information, that is applicable to both lager and
ale brewing.
  It took me two batches to get the hang of mashing. The first had a wet
cardboard taste and pretty low extraction (splashing the wort, and
lautering too fast), and the second still had a faint oxidized off-flavor
(still splashed the hot wort). After these two batches my beers came out
better than my extract beers ever did. I'd suggest you start out brewing
some less bitter beers, so you can taste possible off flavors in your beer
that are caused by your mashing procedure more easily. 
  Have fun mashing, it takes a lot of time to produce a 5 gallon batch of
beer starting with mashing until you pitch the yeast (between 5 and 8
hours), but it's a lot of fun and well worth it.

Subject: yeast energiser/nutrient


Brian summed up the use and content of yeast energiser and nutrient
pretty well, but I'd like to add one more point.  Different suppliers
use various names for their products.  The most basic yeast nutrient
is diammonium phosphate (DAP).  Some suppiliers call their DAP "yeast
nutrient" and call the blend of various nutrients (vitamins, yeast
hulls, peptides, amino acids, DAP, etc.) "yeast energiser."  Others
simply call their blend "yeast nutrient."  It's all very random.


DON'T use DAP.  It is for winemaking and I've heard that it will
give beer an off-flavour.  The nutrient blend may be useful, but
your wort has to be nutrient-deficient for it to help at all.


If your supplier doesn't know what's in their "nutrient" or "energiser"
then (besides starting to look for a better-educated supplier) you
can tell DAP from the blend by simply looking at it.  DAP looks like
an all white powder or tiny round pellets.  The blend is tan and
is clearly a mixture of sevearl different chemicals.  The blend
will smell a little like yeast too (because it's an ingredient).


The original poster never did say why they needed the nutrients...
Was it because you are making something that is primarily adjuncts
and simple sugars?  Yes, then nutrients will help.  Are you making
mead or braggot/bracket (honey and malt)?  Yes, then nutrients will
help.  Are you making a very strong all-malt beer?  No, then the
wort will have more than enough nutrients and OXYGEN at *PITCHING*
time and your pitching rate will be your limiting factors and 
adding nutrients will most likely just increase the production of
higher alcohols and esters.

That's a good point, but the beauty of brewing is that you can either
approach it purely as an art, purely as a science or a blend of the two.
I choose to approach it as a blend of the two.  You may want to skip
the science and simply view is as an art.


I think the fact that you can approach brewing in so many ways and
because you can change your view as your mood suits you (some very
science-minded brewers just brew a "clean-out-the-pantry" batch once
per year) is why it is so popular.


The science is important if you have a problem with a particular batch
or if you have a recurring problem or if you are trying to design a whole
new way of doing something.  The rest of the time, if you are happy with
your gut feeling when deciding how many pounds of grain to use or how many
ounces of hops to add, you can formulate recipes strictly by "feel."


At it's simplest, all-grain is nothing more than mix crushed grains with
hot water, stir, soak, drain, rinse and then you're basically doing the same
as a full-boil (as opposed to concentrated boil) extract batch.


I understand that sometimes all this technical mumbo jumbo we babble can
be confusing, but just as the technologists have to be tolerant of the
artists' questions and the subsequent answers, the artists need to be
tolerant of the technologists' questions and the subsequent answers.

Subject: going all-grain..../lessening the sparge


Tim and Rich are debating/wondering what use to mash and lauter.


I mash and lauter in the same 50L keg with the top cut out.  I have
a single ring, slotted, copper manifold  in the bottom.  It's great.  I
can apply direct heat for easy step mashing and I can effectively
stir the mash as the small central ring doesn't impede things too
much.


Specifically though, Tim and Rich want to know about transfer etc.
I really don't see why you'd want to.  It's more expensive (extra
vessels needed), it's more time-consuming, you'll lose heat and it
will certainly introduce *some* oxygen into the mash (this may be
harmful to the beer down the road).  Rich feels that grains may get
below the false-bottom and lead to a stuck sparge.  1) A few grains
should easily get strained out during recirc (I always get a few husk
bits in the first couple cups) and 2) I believe stuck-sparges are a
relatively rare occurrence (aside from 75% wheat experiences). I
suggest that you both try the single mash/lauter tun approach first.
Many, many brewers use that method.
- ------------------------------------------------
On the lessening the sparge debate:


I made an ordinary bitter last week.  Instead of my usual sparge
to get the needed pre-boil volume, I added boiling water to reach
mashout (~1.5 gallons), sparged with 4 gallons (just over the 
mash-in volume) and topped up with a little brew water.  This 
didn't seem to affect my yield and the resulting beer seems to
be smoother and generally richer than other batches which were
sparged to 'completion'.  Just a datapoint...

Just to put in a vote for my favourite hop supplier: Freshops.
They only sell hops, hop oils/extracts, rhysomes and t-shirts with

I know they have a web page, but my stupid browser is hosed at the
