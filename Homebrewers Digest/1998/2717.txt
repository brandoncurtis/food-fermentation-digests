I first have to say that I had a wonderful time there.  Many great
breweries with many great beers.  I went to the Saturday evening session. 
So much beer to drink and so little time!  :^)  Well, the main reason why I
am posting is that I left a bag there.  It contained a shirt, a glass, and
a bunch of AHA information, including the latest issue of Zymergy.  If
someone on the list knows anything about this, or who I might contact about
retreving this bag.

My previous post was missing it's first line, which tells you what I am
looking for. I've reconfigured my Outlook Express email clientsee if this is any better... Does anyone have a recent source
(preferably online) for a 10 gal Rubbermaid/Gott cooler that is less
than $65?  I searched the archives, and the main recommendation
(Wal-Mart) only has the 5 gal size (searched online and called them). I
live within an hour of the factory, but they want $65ish for one.

Hello all-


Is there a formula for converting the amount of extract necessary to
replace a measurement of grain? For instance, if a recipe calls for 2
pounds of Laaglander malt, can I replace that w/1 pound of Laaglander
malt extract?

Subject: Mini-kegs using a Beer Engine


I had read on the Internet that people have not had good success with 
mini-kegs.  They said the beer always came out flat.  If you could get 
it out 
at all.  If this is really typical I think I've found a solution by using
 a 
Beer Engine instead of the tap that comes with the keg.  I took the tap 
which 
came with the keg and tapped it.  I then removed the tap and stuck my 
siphon 
tube into the hole.  The other end attached to the Beer Engine.  Well 
my 
friends I had absolutely no problem with carbonation.  I had the mother 
of all 
heads.  The real test would be if the beer would be carbonated several 
days 
later.  After having one or six brews I retapped with the tap the keg 
came 
with.  I also blasted some CO2 into the keg in order to rid the keg of 
Oxygen.  
A few days later I reinstalled the Beer Engine and the carbonation was 
still 
there.  According to my readings, the Beer Engine carbonates the beer 
with the 
Nitrogen in the air.  Regular kegs use CO2 for carbonation which 
dissolves in 
the beer and makes it taste 
more bitter.  With the Beer Engine you can make the same beer and get a 
whole 
different taste.


The Beer Engine was easy to build.  It's basically the pump housed inside
 a 
box.  The end where the liquid comes out has a brass cap with a bunch of 
tiny 
holes drilled thru it attached using some siphon hose and a clamp to attach
 to 
it.  The other end has another piece of hose which goes to the keg.   
The May 
1997 issue of Brew Your Own has an article on making your own beer engine.
  I 
purchased all the parts listed in the article from What's Brewing in New 
Jersey.


Cheers!

Subject: Soaking Pale malt to Make Crystal Malt


Hans E. Hansen asks:


"The recent posts about making crystal malt mentioned soaking
the grain until there is a moisture content of 45%.  How do
you tell the moisture content?"


Good question, and one I (think) I answered in my post.  As you suspected, by-
weight is the key.  If malt were to be soaked to 50% moisture content, then
you would want an equal amount of water and grain.  To nail 45% right on the
money would thus require less water, and you would need to know the moisture
content of the malt (probably around 5% or less).  The 45% figure comes from
(I guess) the fact that "green malt" is typically prepared to a moisture
content inthe 40's-percent range.  When soaking pale malt to make crystal at
home, I doubt it matters much if it's 40% or 50%.


Based on that speculation, let's just use equal water and malt.  Add one pound
of water per pound of grain.  Since water weighs 8.4 lb/gal, this would be
0.119 gal, or damn near one pint.  For you metriphiles out there, it's even
simpler -- 1 kg water per kg grain; a kg of water is 1 liter.  In either case,
if you want to be closer to 45%, use about 10% less water.  Maybe a tad less
to account for moisture already in the grain.

Subject:  PET Bottles and Oxidation


Beerlings:


I seem to recall posts in this forum which claim that PET bottles, being
permeable to air, are not appropriate for long-term (lets say, +6 week)
storage of beer.


I had about four liters of barleywine left in a corney, and wanting to put
the vessel to another use, I transfered the barleywine to two CO2
purged PET soda bottles, and capped them with Carbonators(TM).


Consider the following. hypothesis:


  "Given that the beer in the PET bottles is under significant pressure and
    that the bottles were carefully purged before filling with CO2, the beer 
   will not oxidize before the pressure differential between the inside and
   outside the container drops -- since only then will O2 not be
   inhibited from permeating the bottle by a positive pressure gradient.
   So long as I keep up the pressure with the Carbonators, the beer will
   not oxidize."


Comments or empirical evidence to refute the above are most welcome.

Let's see:
    Recirculation, well, at most mashout 170f, not boiling.
    Sparge, about same, 170, or so.
    Whirlpool, hmm, maybe, if you hose down the boiling kettle just
after knockout, you can quickly drop 10 degrees off in seconds.


I have heard others mention boiling temps, but I can not find a need,
maybe there is some reason, but I can not reason why.


It seems that most of us have standardized on the magnetic drive,
plastic impeller and housing pumps made by Teel and March.  These pumps
are rated at various temps, I have seen some as high as 200f.

I'm having a bit of a problem with my construction of my GOTT Cooler

am using a 10 gal.  cylindrical cooler with Phil's Phalse Bottom, I was
hoping to use a compression fitting, coupling, ball valve assembly to drain
the wort from the cooler.  This past weekend I got the final parts and
proceded to put it together, I filled it with water and what do you know it
leaks.  The leak isn't too fast, but I still don't like the idea of it
leaking for 60-90 minutes while I mash.  Has anybody else done something
similar, or should I just go with the method in the phalse bottom
documentation.

Yes, copper for the short, gold if you are the Donald, (and err, now
also Bill Gates).


Stainless would be ideal for the coil, because it is less reactive to
wort, and we are reaching for elegance here.  Stainless is not as good a
conductor of heat, but we are not conducting heat, it is there
throughout  the metal, (ignoring skin effect at 60 Hz - all you picky
chemists!).

A low value series resistor in the primary circuit will limit the

When a transformer is feeding a resistive load, much of the spikes and
transients are reduced or eliminated, and the coil is a resistive load
at 60 Hz.


A small transformer can be used as boost - buck in the primary, with
these controlled by electronics (say, a 24 volt buck transformer would
allow primary voltage to vary enough to control the power), remember the
power is the square of the voltage.  You can buck or boost the primary
voltage, depending upon the phase of the small transformer in series
with the primary.  Reverse the phase and you have buck, reverse again
and you have boost.  This is an old trick that can also be used at the
end of long power lines.

Not to worry, ground the secondary coil, worst case, a blown circuit

No, the secondary will be an extremely low impedance, the primary
impedance will be transformed to a higher impedance (hence the name,
transformer).

Subject: Deer and Hops - Yeast Nutrient


In answer to a couple questions recently posted:  I live in NE WA
(lotsa deer) I've not grown hops, but here is my experience. I usually
put my spent grain out for our neighborhood deer - they love it, but I
once put spent grain out that had hops in it as well, the deer would
come up, smell it, turn up their noses and walk away. The deer might
have a different opinion of hops in its alive and growing state, but
they sure don't like hops that have been cooked in wort. Also, I have
traveled through the hops growing area of WA, and even though there
are deer there, I've not seen and "deer fences" around the hops fields

Concerning yeast nutrients: I recently started using Wyeast (standard
disclaimer) (I'm just a small time homebrewer). I'm impressed with
what their yeast nutrient does: Speeds up primary and secondary
fermentation (by my experience) 30% to 40%. It also seems to speed up
bottle conditioning time as well, but I haven't used it long enough to
know that for sure. It's cheep, probably less than 10 cents per 5
gallon batch. I have never used any other brands of yeast nutrients,
but I'm very impressed with the Wyeast product. I use 1/8 tsp in a 1
pint starter plus 1/2 tsp in a five gallon batch. (directions are on
the lable). I will definitely continue using it.
Keep on brewin'.

I was warned that I would get a great deal of reponses from all the RIMS
folks about my inquiry about pumps and I did, thanks everyone for your
help, It looks like I've found exactly what I want from Movingbrews.


Now for the next question, I desperately want to set up my system so it is
as portable as possible.  Also I want to be able to operate indoors, even
in a basement.  So ..... I'm looking for an electric heating element that
I can thread into the side of a sankey keg that will sufficiently boil 15
gallons of wort, can be cleaned etc.  Also a single phase unit (110-120v)
would be best.


I know it's an expensive alternative to propane, but has anyone tried this
or done any research on the subject?  McMaster Carr has a few
possibilities but they are pricey.


Thanks again to the mutual wisdom out there . . . . .

   I've got a bit of a problem with a big beer I brewed.  Through profound 
lazyness I let it sit in the secondary too long and it's developed some sort 
of *very slow* infection.  It's a whitish slick that's covered about half of 
the top surface over the course of a month or so.


  It's imparting some sourness to the beer that is still in the realm of 
"interesting" rather than "unpleasant".  I'm wondering if I go ahead and keg 
it, removing "most" available oxygen, if the wee beasties might stop in their 
tracks?  Are there other measures available, short of just drinking 5 gallons 
of huge beer ASAP? (I can do that if I must).  Any help appreciated!


  As an aside, I saw on (I believe) The Discovery Channel that some people are 
having dilute botulism toxin injected into their faces at strategic locations 
as a non-surgical facelift.  It seems that it paralyzes the muscles responsible 
for forehead wrinkles and such for up to 6 months... See?  If you look hard 
enough there's some good in almost anything :-D

     Hi all,
     
     I recently read the protein rest article by Ray Daniels in Zymurgy.  
     It is in need of a pretty major correction.
     
     A protein rest at 131F (55C) does not favor the breakdown of peptides 
     into free amino acids.  A rest at that temp will break down foam 
     positive large proteins into haze-causing (but still somewhat foam 
     positive) mid-weight proteins.  That is why Kunze urges no rest at 
     55C:  you will increase haze potential and possibly hurt heading.
     
     If you want to remove large proteins, a good, vigorous boil will do 
     the trick without forming haze precursors.
     
     The Zymurgy article got it precisely backwards.
     
     Thanks to Pete Garofalo for pointing it out to me, or I may not have 
     read it for a another few days.
     
     Have fun!

Subject: Foam, blow-off and head retention/Dangers of under pitching


     Hi all,
     
     There has been some talk (er, writing) about "foam only once proteins" 
     or whatever they're being called.  The basic idea is that every time 
     the wort/beer foams, it is losing some of its heading ability.
     
     Al K. says that his blow-off experiment disproved this (because beer 
     fermented with and without blowing off the Kraeusen had similar 
     heading ability.
     
     Actually, his experiment didn't disprove this phenomenon.  What we 
     were taught at Siebel is that every time the beer foams, some of the 
     bubble's surface (which is made primarily from protein) remains 
     insoluble.  These now useless particles can be seen as "skins" 
     floating through the beer (they are microscopic, but they exist just 
     as surely as any of us).  Because they are existing as suspended 
     solids they do not help in bubble formation/retention.
     
     Al's experiment allowed the Kraeusen to blow out of one carboy but not 
     the other.  My *guess* would be that heading was similar because in 
     one beer the proteins were removed in the blow off, while in the other 
     they simply sank back into the beer as skins that did not aid head 
     retention.
     
     Of course, there is usually plenty of protein in an all-malt, properly 
     mashed beer to aid with head retention, so you can do things like lose 
     some to the Kraeusen and still get head retention.
     
     Kunze doesn't talk about this phenomena, though.  He talks something 
     that I never considered:  the serving procedure.
     
     He points out that when the beer is poured, and the partially filled 
     glass is allowed to settle a minute or so, the surface of the foam 
     will become the skins I mentioned earlier, and thus help trap more gas 
     than the liquid bubbles beneath.  The glass can then be topped off, 
     and a more stable head of partially solidified foam will result.  He 
     then talks a bit about the solid bubbles forming lace on the sides of 
     the glass.
     
     This could just be another conspiracy, though:  he is protecting slow 
     bartenders the world over!
     ---------------------------------
     Don V. recently asked about under-pitching and under-aerating.  He 
     wrote something that disturbed me a bit.  He said that if you want to 
     make an estery beer, you might want to under pitch.
     
     I'd say that's a bad idea.  Reasons:
     
     Under-pitching invites many other problems, including stuck 
     fermentations, less healthy yeast for harvesting, problems with 
     unwanted microbes, increased higher (fusel) alcohol production, etc.
     
     As I have recently said here, there are very few times you can say 
     "always" or "never" in this field, but this is one of them:  the more 
     yeast growth you get, the more higher alcohol production you get.  
     Under-pitching can result will increased yeast growth.  Higher 
     alcohols are generally unwelcome in very noticeable quantities.  They 
     hurt your head (both yours and the beer's!)  They taste harsh. 
     
     There are better ways of controlling ester levels in beers.  One way 
     is to simply choose the right yeast strain for the job.  Sure, Wyeast 
     1028 will be more banana-like than 3068 if you under-pitch and 
     under-aerate it (I know from sad experience in my early days), but the 
     resulting beer is not good because of the reasons I cited above.
     
     In general, pitching the right amount of yeast is always a good thing. 
     Aerating it is good, too, although there are a few brewers who 
     manipulate oxygen levels to control yeast growth and thus the 
     resulting beer's flavor/aroma profile.  This is not a good trick to 
     try at home, in my opinion.  Feel free to differ.
     
     For more info than you could ever want, search the archives.  I posted 
     a bunch o'stuff earlier this year, and this gets discussed fairly 
     often.
     
     As a really quick note, the easiest way to guess at your pitching rate 
     is to follow this rule:  never step up the volume that the yeast get 
     pitched into more than 10 fold when making ales, and closer to 5 fold 
     for lagers.  In other words, if you are making 5 gallons (19L) of ale, 
     pitch at least 1/10 that volume yeast starter (0.5 gallon (1.9 L)).  
     Aerate well.  You will experience short lags, fast fermentations that 
     don't stick, and you'll have happy yeast to harvest.
     
     Have fun!

Subject: inductive heating and RIMS


Hi Folks,
        Regarding the recent discussion about using magnteic induction as 
a source of heat for a RIMS system I'd like to submit the following 
comments.
        Transformers are generally engineered to maximize the mutual 
inductance of the primary and secondary coils. This is accomplished by 
closely interwinding the primary and secondary coils around a laminated 
soft iron core to minimize losses due to eddy currents and hysteresis.  
Any attempt to rewind the coil of the secondary around a pipe will 
dramatically weaken the coupling between the primary and secondary coils 
dramatically reducing the efficiency of the transformer.
        If anyone really wants to try this you might find it 
significantly more effective to use a variac (Variable transformer) to 
step the voltage down.  The output of the Variac can then be connected to 
the an induction coil wound around the pipe.  You will want to maximize 
the magnetic field inside the pipe to induce the largest possible eddy 
currents in the wort, so the more turns, and the higher the current the 
better.  Keep in mind that if you are doing this in a metal pipe the 
metal is a much better conductor than wort so you may wind up 
transferring more power to the pipe than the wort.  I rather suspect that 
you will find that the losses due to resistive heating in the induction 
coil and in the variac (Which is not nearly as efficent as a regular 
transformer) will make this a very inefficient process overall. You would 
be well advised to make a reasonably good estimate of the impedance of 
the pipe and wort. You should then be able to work backwards to figure 
out the load the induction coil presents to the variac and then to the 
primary.
        Has anyone here ever heard of the KISS principle? :) 
                                        Regards
                                        simon.

Subject: Beer cooler repair question


Greetings all!   


  While driving down a country road on Saturday I chanced by a house with a 
  two keg beer cooler (industrial bar type) with a two tap tower and (this
  is my favorite part) a giant FREE sign.  My heart went pitty-pat and I 
  almost put my wife's head through the windshield as I applied the brakes
  in the appropriate fashion (I mean a free beer cooler, wouldn't you lock
  up all four wheels?).  As we were in the pickup I thought that it must 
  be fate so we loaded it into the back and off to the brewery, er garage,
  we went (I thought that my wife showed great spirit in actually helping
  me load the heavy beast in the back while still maligning my panic braking
  skills!).


  Back at the brewery, er garage, I power washed the unit, it really needed
  it, polished up the stainless top and drain pan and cleaned out the  
  condenser and evaporator coils.  The only non-functional part is the fan
  that moves air inside the cabinet across the cooling coils (the compressor
  runs smoothly and quietly !). Now my question, the original fan is a simple
  exposed frame type that was completely frozen up (it looked like a previous
  keg explosion inside had totally gummed up the works and had never been
  cleaned up). I have several muffin fans that would fit the cabinet and I 
  think would provide an equivalent air flow (judging by the current rating
  on the original fan and the size of the blade), would a muffin fan work
  in the cooling cabinet or would the environment be too much for it?


  Private responses would be fine. TIA 8^)

I tend to agree with George if we were to over generalize here for a bit.
However, after reading a few articles in BT and Zymurgy, which I cited in my
post, I have changed my thinking and now believe that pitching rates might
be one of those things that one size may not fit all.
I think this is one of those areas that we might say "well it kind of
depends".


George De Piro:
>     In general, pitching the right amount of yeast is always a good thing.


What is the"right amount".
There seems to be a lot of differing opinions as to how much is "the right
amount"
George Fix says we should use we should use 400 ml of yeast solids per
Hectoliter (1 hectoliter = 26.42 gal.) which is about (correct me if my math
is wrong) 80 ml per 5 gal. and George De Piro says about 1/2 gal per 5
al.  --that's A LOT yeast.    I know lots of brewers who pitch only one
swelled wyeast packet or a single White Lab vile and make great beer.   I
tend to do a starter, and populate the colony a little more than that.
  George went on to say:

Although, he generally recomends areation, Tracy Aquila (BT Vol. 5 #2) makes
a good case for not areating in a few situations.


I have had great success and have read antidotal evidence (J. Schmidling -
HBD) of other brewers pitching large amounts of yeast and doing little to no
areation.


So,  how much is the right amount???  ---of yeast and O2?
I think it kinda depends on what you're brewin  and is somewhere between one
Wyeast pack and 1/2 gallon.

The proof is in the puding -- if it works for you, do it.
