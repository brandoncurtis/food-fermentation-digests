Someone asked a couple of days ago about high temperature pumps. Talk to
Bill Stewart at MOVING BREWS <estewart`at`idt.net>. He sells quite a few
configurations including at least one that can handle boiling liquids made
of polysulphone. All mag-drive. I've used mine to do a CIP with PBW and hot
acid at around 170-180*F, as well as transfer boiling liquor from my HL
tank, and to push boiling wort thru my CF-HE. I have no financial interest,
but I have thoroughly enjoyed doing business with Bill. BTW, he also has all
kinds of really neat SS stuff...


Hope this helps,

Subject: Wort Pump & boiling temps


In response to rlabor`at`lsumc.edu (LaBorde, Ronald), when he asks the 
question; "...why you need to handle temps up to boiling."


Why not boiling temps?  Why not plan for all the possibilities?  I have a 
March pump, and it's rated to handle boiling temps.  My pump needs  to be 
able to handle boiling wort because I use a counter-flow chiller.  I boil 
12 gallon batches, and I'm not about to carry the kettle outside and hose 
it down--I'd blow a nut!


By using the pump to send boiling hot wort through the CF chiller(before 
starting the water), the coils can be sanitized, and the wort returned to 
the kettle before starting the whirlpool.  Anyone who has plans to 
purchase a pump, should do themselves a favor and get one that handles 
boiling temps.  For the difference in price, it ain't worth the pain of 
regret should the need arise for a pump that can.


Just friendly advice from a guy who's been there--cheers.

Subject: competition cheating? / MovingBrews / pumps rated for boiling te


Hello fellow brewers! I have a question about brewing that I don't 
think I've ever seen posted here in the digest. I recently made a 
simple mead which turned out nicely, but a bit plain for my tastes.  
So I decided to spruce it up a bit by adding a 12oz bottle of 
grenadine and a few cups of some fruit flavored liqueurs, which 
turned out nicely I think.  My question is, what if I decided to 
enter this mead (or similarly doctored brew) in a competition?  Does 
that fact that I added a *pre-fermented* beverage to my mead/brew 
preclude it from being entered in a competition?  Or would it not be 
considered cheating as long as I kept it below a certain level?


- ----------------


Bradd Wheeler asks about RIMS pumps and gets a lot of replies 
suggesting he try MovingBrews, then asks about where to find electric 
heating elements.  I know from talking with Bill Stewart (owner of 
MovingBrews) that he is working on adding a RIMS heating chamber to 
his catalog.  I don't remember if he will be including the element or 
not, but I think he may so ask him.  He sells a lot of things not 
listed in his catalog, and can get just about anything else you ask 
for. http://www.ays.net/movingbrews/ (I wrote his web page but 
otherwise have no financial interests.)


- ----------------


Ronald La Borde respondes to Bradd and can't understand why anyone 
would want a pump rated for boiling temps.  Perhaps Bradd is 
interested in pumping his hot wort straight from the kettle through a 
CF-chiller, or maybe he plans on recirculating the wort in his kettle 
across an immersion chiller.  I've tried both with some success but 
always have to prechill my kettle first since my pump is only rated 
for 180dF.  It would be nice to have one rated for boiling temps.

Subject: Re: Dangers of under pitching / aeration


     Hi all,
     
     I seemed to confuse Don with my last post.  I recommend pitching a 
     yeast *starter* of volume about equal to 10% of the batch size.  Don 
     then compared that to the 80 mL of yeast *solids* that he says Fix 
     recommends.  0.5 gallon (1.8L) of yeast slurry (or solids) would 
     certainly be a lot for a 5 gal. (19L) batch!!!  You would have a 
     really quick fermentation, though...
     
     Pitching a Wyeast pack (even their new larger ones) into a 19 L (5 
     gal.) batch is entirely inadequate.  Yes, you can make beer that way 
     (I'd bet we all have at some point), but the odds of it being truly 
     great are somewhat slimmer than if you pitch a healthy starter 
     culture.
     
     John Varady's pale ale experimenters all pitched a single, swelled, 
     large-size Wyeast pack and they all experienced pretty damn long lag 
     times (on the order of days).  That's never a good thing.  Several of 
     them ended up with finishing gravities quite a bit higher than they 
     expected, too.  Perhaps John would care to comment on the details?
     
     Manipulating pitching rates to control beer character is a tricky 
     process.  At home, without a microscope and hemacytometer, this would 
     most likely produce highly inconsistent results.  Nobody at Siebel 
     recommended manipulating pitching rates as a means of controlling beer 
     character.  The results would just be too inconsistent.
     
     On aeration:
     
     Tracy A.'s BT article stresses that if you underpitch, you have got to 
     aerate.  Almost all homebrewers are underpitching, and should 
     therefore aerate.
     
     I mentioned earlier that some brewers claim to manipulate aeration 
     parameters as a means of controlling yeast growth (and thus beer 
     character).  South African Breweries is one such brewer.  This method 
     is not without consequences:  they don't harvest and repitch the yeast 
     thus treated.  Why not?  Read on:
     
     Yeast use oxygen to build sterols, which are important to the cell 
     membrane.  Yeast can only contain ~1% sterol, and they need a minimum 
     of 0.1% to remain viable and healthy.  What does this mean to you?
     
     When you provide the yeast oxygen at pitching time, they build up 
     their sterol levels to 1%.  The yeast then start to divide.  With each 
     division, their sterol level drops by about half.  Since you 
     (hopefully) are not aerating the wort continuously during 
     fermentation, the yeast cannot make any more sterol.  After 3 
     divisions the yeast cells will be at ~0.125% sterol.  Since they need 
     at least 0.1%, they will not be able to divide further.
     
     That is why you get about 3 times as much yeast out of a fermenter as 
     you put in it.  They can only divide 3 times before they have to stop 
     because of sterol limitations (unless you provide them with more 
     oxygen, like you might do when building large starters).
     
     Perhaps now it is becoming clear why under-pitching, especially when 
     under-aerating, is so bad.  You end up with fewer yeast cells in the 
     end, and they aren't the healthiest, most viable cells, either.  This 
     is why you get a long or stuck fermentation when under-pitching.
     
     Why mess with this kind of stuff in the relatively uncontrolled 
     environment of the small brewery?  It is so easy to make a 0.5 gallon 
     yeast starter that it is almost inexcusable not to.  Aeration of the 
     wort is another really easy trick.  You can improve the quality of 
     your beer very dramatically with these simple techniques.  I dare say 
     that these two variables are the *most important factors* in improving 
     your beer.
     
     Have fun!

Brewers,
        I have acquired a slight problem. I typically store fruit and vegetables
in an area in my basement which is adjacent to the area I brew in. It also
happens to be the area where I cellar my beer and wine. This winter, the
onions, carrots and potatoes have become infested with fruit flies.  I have
gotten rid of the fruit and vegetables but the flies have not figured out
where they want to go. I don't really want to brew until I have  gotten rid
of them. Any suggestions? I have gotten the potential food sources and
breeding sites cleared up but they are just hanging around.  I have
considered the "no-pest-strips" but they are not to be used around food
storage. The only thing left in that room are capped beer and corked wine.
Can the insecticide permeate the corks?
        The flies seem to enjoy the computer screen ......SWAT!

Subject: Starting the starter


All -


I recently acquired a 2000ml Erlenmyer flask to use in preparing yeast
starters, and although the convenience is nice (boil and pitch in the
same vessel), I am having a hell of a time trying to figure out the
correct ratio of DME to water.  I would like to start out with between
800 and 1000 ml of water.  How much light DME should I add to this to
make the appropriate (~1.035) starter wort?  I have been using about 3/4
cup of DME to 1000 ml, and my starters never seem to be active until I
add almost another whole cup of DME.  This just doesn't seem right.
Also, when doing a second step-up, should I decant the liquid on top and
add new wort, or just dump the new wort on top of the existing starter
solution?  Lastly, should the second step-up be higher gravity, or the
same?  TIA . . .

Each gas responds to its own partial pressure.  If there's no O2 in
the bottle, there's no O2 pressure, no matter how much CO2 pressure
there is.  O2 will diffuse into the bottle.  PET bottles are good for
about six months of storage (the rough consensus on rec.crafts.brewing,
which tallies with my own experience).

You could pasteurize it, especially since you keg (and so could
force-carbonate it).  Take it up to 170F, then cool it rapidly.


Rapid cooling to below 80F is an important part of pasteurization --
it keeps any remaining bacteria from multiplying back to problem levels.


And, if you "must," you'll get mead.  :-)

I sent a couple of beers to the national AHA competition this
year (first time). I thought it was strange that they request only one
beer for the first round, but three for the finals. This seems backwards
to me since so few beers make it to the final round. Is one beer enough?
How many judges actually evaluate each entry in the first round? Any
other info appreciated.

Christopher,


The main reason we only allow one bottle for the first round is to
maintain the sanity of the few souls brave enough to volunteer their
time and effort at the first round sites; Roger Deschner and his crew in
Chicago, for example, just finished sorting the 531 entries they
received, and they only had three states.  That sort of volume would be
exceedingly difficult with three or even two bottles.


Generally, first round sites conduct their judging with 40-60 judges,
then at the second round, 100 or so judges attack about 580 second-round
qualifying entries.  At this point, the numbers are manageable enough to
accept three bottles so that judges may do a "mini" best of show and
then a best of show round.


Good luck with your entries,

Subject: Electric Brewing / Gott Coolers


Bradd Wheeler asks about using electricity to brew his 15-gal batches.


Looks like it's time to fire up the semi-annual electric brewing thread
again...


An approximation of power required to heat a volume of water is


Watts = 150 * gallons * (degrees per minutes)


Bradd would like to use a single-phase 120V line; let's say he can dedicate a
20 amp line so with a small margin of safety let's say 18 amps, so that's 120
x 18 = 2160W max.


2160 = 150 * 15 * degrees/minute


So your 15 gallons would warm at a bit less than 1 degree per minute.  Much
slower if you don't insulate the vessel.  Your room temperature strike water
would take close to 2 hours to warm up, and sparged wort would take well over
an hour to reach boiling.


Next you can do what I did, which is to split the 240V dryer (or range)
circuit into two dedicated 120V circuits and slap a $5 20A GFI on each branch.
Hang a similar heater on each side and now you're closer to reality with a
1-hour heat-up time.


Or you could go straight 240V but this would require a panel-installed GFI
which is neither cheap to buy nor to have installed.


Another issue to consider is the "power density" of the elements.  This is
simply the power divided by the surface area of the element.  My elements run
at about 25 watts per square inch without any apparent ill effects.  Off the
top of my head I would guess you could get away with up to 50 without serious
damage to your wort but above that I'd be careful.


Finally, you have to deal with controlling the elements.  Simple on-off
control is great if you're lucky enough to get the right level of boiling
action without a boilover.  Chances are though that you'll need to throttle
one element as a "fine adjust" of the boiling vigor.  Hi-power dimmer switches
can be found but are somewhat expensive.  Simple switched-diode controllers
can be used with some success but only offer off/half/full power control.


In any case, the answer is "anything is possible" but you really need to look
at the details.  See my web page http://members.aol.com/kennyeddy for
information on my Electric Brewery if you want to see how it was done at my
house.

I suppose the Gotts are hard to come by locally right now since the summer
picnic season is just getting underway.  By Memorial Day the stores should be
filled with them.  But before you spring for the 10-gallon unit for 5-gallon
batches, see if they still plan to offer the 7-gallon cooler.  It's the same
diameter as the 10-gallon so all the Phittings will still Phit, yet it will
probably hold the temperature better than the 10-gallon cooler when the
typical 10 - 12 pounds of grain is used.  Plus, when I Gott mine last summer,
it was only $20 (compared to $40 for the 10-gallon).

I too am looking for a pump that supports higher temperatures, preferably
up to boiling, for at least two (2)  reasons:


1. Lets me use hotter water & fluids for cleaning the pump & brew-time
   distribution lines


2. It's always been my practice to work with the best range of any tool
   possible.  A higher temp handling capability leaves me with one less
   thing to worry about should I need to push it beyond the normal 170
   degrees or so for any other reason.


Where to get it from:


'Moving Brews' (no affiliation, blah blah blah) has two pumps in the range,
slightly < $100 and slightly > $100.  The price difference for NOT getting
that range capability is, in my book, chump change at around $20.  Their
stuff looks pretty good, though I have had a little bit of trouble getting
them on the phone.


Get the best tool you can afford.  Motto hasn't failed me yet!
(At least, not since college when I couldn't afford much... :-)

Subject: Moisture content of malt / Pilsner malt kilning schedule


     Hi all,
     
     Figuring out the moisture content of malt (or any solid) is really 
     quite easy.  Take the malt.  Weigh it.  Put it in a toaster oven at 
     about 250F (121C).  Wait 30 minutes or so.  Weigh it.  Repeat until 
     the weight doesn't change.
     
     You may safely assume the weight the malt lost was water (unless you 
     cranked the heat too high and scorched it).  If you want to speed up 
     the process, grind the malt, then perform the above procedure.  Be 
     careful not to burn the malt!
     
     Note that it helps to have a balance with at least 0.1 g resolution.
     ------------------------------
     I don't have the analytical stats on my malt yet, so if you follow any 
     of my kilning schedules, you do so at your own risk.  Also, my notes 
     aren't here, so this is just an approximation (a good one, though).  
     The whole detailed mess will have to wait for the BT article.
     
     Making pils malt was very easy.  I simply dried the malt down to <5% 
     moisture in a 87F (30.6C) room with a fan blowing the warm, dry air 
     over the malt (which was spread out in quite a shallow layer).  I then 
     put it in my oven which was set for 220F or so, but the malt never got 
     hotter than 168F (75.5C).  I left the malt in there for a couple of 
     hours.  My criteria for determining when it was done was to taste and 
     smell it.
     
     I turned it often.  It was spread out in layers about 2 inches (5 cm) 
     deep in aluminum catering pans.
     
     The malt ended up looking pretty light in color.  The endosperm is 
     bright white and chalky.  It is fairly soft to the tooth.  It tastes 
     and smells a lot like pils malt!
     
     If one were really adventurous, you could forego the oven kilning step 
     and use the malt after the low-temperature (87F, 30.5C) drying step.  
     This would then be called "wind malt," and would be the absolute 
     lightest color malt you could find.  It could be interesting in a 
     light lager; an all malt, full-flavored beer that's as light in color 
     as a MegaSwill 50% rice brew...hmmm...
     
     The reason I didn't do this is that the low-temp malt had quite a 
     "green" aroma to it.  It smelled like acetaldehyde and mown grass; not 
     unpleasant, but I don't think I'm ready to brew with that much courage 
     yet.
     
     The pilsner malt schedule I just told you is quite a bit different 
     from commercial maltings.  It took several days for the malt to get to 
     5% moisture at 87F (30.5C), which isn't great if you're trying to make 
     money.  I am also wondering how much beta-glucanase and 
     peptidase/protease activity I got at that low a temperature.  The 
     analysis will tell for sure, but the malt is so soft that I'd bet it's 
     really well modified.
     
     I am reluctant to post the Munich malt schedule I used, simply because 
     the malt tastes overdone.  If the analysis and subsequent brewing work 
     out decently, I'll report back.  Otherwise, you'll have to wait for my 
     second attempt.
     
     Have fun!

Subject: Defective pump impeller housing??


Fellow RIMSers,


I ordered a March magnetic pump from a C&H Sales.  There was a
label which said to get maximum life out of the pump I should
keep the impeller housing filled with water.  Since I'm still
building my RIMS, I haven't put it to use yet nor found a way to
keep the pump filled with water.  After a month, I noticed a
gap in the seal between the two screws spaced wider apart than
the others.  It doesn't look like it will hold water now!
Is this a defect? Can it be fixed by soaking the impeller housing?
Has anyone seen this before?  This is the second pump I ordered
from them, the first one arrived with a gap and I sent it back.
Can I get replacement parts from March?  Tightening the screws
down won't eliminate the gap.  Maybe a gasket or O-ring?

Although not invited, I will hop on this one.....


Consider that the cell count of a normal starter (no agitation, incremental
addition of sugars, O2 input, pH titration, stirring or other heroic
measures) is about 50^6 cells/mL.  This is strain dependent among a host of
other caveats, so please don't chain me to that number.  GDP's
recommendation for a 1/10 dilution (1.9L in 19L) will provide approx. 5^6
cells/mL.  In a 10P beer this is approx. 0.5^6 cells/mL/P which is the
absolute lower limit of GF's recommendations for ales.  George^2 are in
agreement on this issue.  GF's references to "yeast solids" describe a
solution which is very different from a much lower cell density starter
culture.


That's right.  You should pitch the equivalent of 0.5 gallon starters (for
ales) as a lower limit to see proper yeast performance, attenuation, lag
etc.  In a 19L batch this lower limit is 1900 ml * 50^6 cells/mL = 95^9
cells.  95 Billion cells.


In reality, the best way to achieve this is to repitch "yeast solids" just
like the professional brewers do.  There is simply no better way to get the
cell counts that high, no other practical way to pitch a strong beer.  Over
the years there have been many posts about using and harvesting top
cropping yeasts in reference to many similar questions.


Repitching is an easy and economical way to get the best performance out of
your yeast. With better beer as a byproduct, why would anyone not practice
this procedure?

        Al K comments on the ongoing debate on cutting the grain bed.  He 
indicates he's never had a problem, however, I have with Wheat beers and on 
one occasion when sparging 38 lbs of double decoction, doppelbock.


        I agree with Al about cutting the grain bed.  I found with stuck sparges 
it doesn't help and may be of questionable value when the sparge isn't 
stuck.  Now, I use a modified sparge, where after the 1st runnings, I stir 
up the top 3/4's of the grain bed, while adding sparge water.  I do this 
twice early in the sparge.  Yields have improved by about 2-3 points (from 
29/lb/gal to 32) and clarity of the wort remains good.  One other important 
point: while you can let off the first runnings rather quickly for 
conventional beers, doing this for double decotion and other highly viscous 
runnings (wheat beers) will lead to a stuck sparge because it jams the 
grain bed down too much.  You'll note that Darryl Richman and Eric Warner 
emphasize this in their respective books.  Once a grain bed is stuck, you 
should stir the WHLOLE thing back up, and slowly reset and clarify, rather 
than attempt to fight through the sparge from hell.

Brad you asked about pumps.


Look at the Little Giant 2MD HC.  The HC stands for highly corrosive.   It
pumps 8.3 gpm to 14 feet, will tolerate 200 degree F and the head is made
with Ryton.  It is designed so caustic will not touch it.  The March 809
series brass pump is great except for the brass.  I understand caustic will
do a number on brass.  The good news - March pumps will tolerate 250 degree
F.  Both of these pumps are seal-less magnetic. I have used the Little Giant
for 6 or 7 years and turn off the flame (obviously the boiling stops) then
go straight to the pump and never had a problem.  Works great.

Subject: Pin Lock Keg Woes


Several months ago I neglected the wisdom of caveat emptor (let the buyer
beware) when I purchased a kegging system.  Included with the system were
two used pin lock kegs, both in excellent physical condition.  
Problem:  one of the kegs had bad poppets.  
Bigger Problem:  they were Coca Cola kegs.
I have been unsuccessful in locating replacement poppets for these kegs.  
One source told me that these were proprietary parts, and that there was a
legal problem here.


Can anybody in HBD-land shed any light on this subject???  Should I dump
these kegs and start over?


Thanks!
