Some are, some aren't.  Many transformers are made with entirely
separate winding coils, the typical transformer will have the primary
coil wound first nearest the core, then the secondary winding on top of
the primary.  On a step down transformer, the primary wire diameter is
smaller than the secondary, and it calculates out such that less wire is
needed with this arrangement.  The esoteric designs you mentioned are
generally for high frequencies, not 60 Hz.

The coil of the secondary is not wound around the pipe, the pipe IS the
secondary.  As long as you stay within the core, all is well, if the
windings are loose, electrically it still doesn't matter.  It will
mechanically chatter and vibrate like crazy though.

If I understand your design, the variac would replace the transformer,
allowing a low voltage - high current feed to the RIMS coil.  Can you
imagine the size of a high amperage variac?  You would need an airplane
hanger to house it.

Yeah, what he said.  Only I'd consider those *minimum* guidelines.
(see, George and I do agree on some things).


Since I've been reading the HBD, I've always been struck by what I
term an inverse attention disorder.  Folks seem to spend 90% of their
attention worrying about 10% of the process.  I'm not saying everyone
is guilty of this, but many will worry about predicting their IBUs to
4 significant digits, or keeping their mash temperature within 0.1F of
target, or whether they should add another 1% of Munich to their
grist, but then they'll pitch a one pint starter that they worked up
the night before, and stick it in a closet to ferment at
goodness-knows-what temperature.


The yeast is responsible for almost everything good (and often
everything bad) that comes out of beer, and IMO, it should be the
absolute number one priority in brewing.  No matter whether you're
using kits, partial mashing, or on a 30 bbl. system, you can get the
best improvement in your brewing by paying more attention to your
yeast.  They deserve it.  Build them their own little room.  Spend $$
buying them neat toys.  Make pagan offerings to them.  Then when your
S.O. and party guests comment on how much they like your latest brew,
you can bask in the glow and take all the credit (and then you better
get back to brewing, because the ungrateful bastards will drink all of
your best beer).  Once you've got your yeast consistently happy and
healthy, then you can really start to experiment with different parts
of your process.


I know this sermon is old hat for many, but I don't think it can be
repeated enough.

The more I think about this, the more I believe you are right AJ.  Upon
first hearing about using the chamber itself as the secondary, well, I
was charmed.


The problem I think, and as you may have already understood is that to
get enough heat transfer surface, one would need several turns inside
the core, and this would dictate the turns ratio.  The ratio would be
too small causing enormous power draw from the transformer - much too
much for any reasonable size unit.


No, I will stick to my original design, to use a single or several turn
secondary, connected by large conductors (welding cable) to the RIMS
chamber that can be as long as needed for heat transfer to the wort.
The chamber need not be a coil at all.  It may be simply a length of
straight stainless pipe.  This way, the transformer design will not be
constrained by chamber geometry.


I am growing weary thinking about all this, so I will probably go on to
the next RIMS design - let's see, hmm, microwave oven, 750 watts, seems
good, high temp plastic tubing RIMS chamber, seems good, stuff into
oven, seems good, now for those pesky radiation leaks...

     >Mike Beatty
     
     If what you are really trying to do is to convert an all-grain recipe 
     to an extract-based recipe, then I highly recommend (I'm the author) 
     the article on recipe conversion in the latest issue of 
     BrewingTechniques magazine.  It'll provide a lot more info than just 
     how to convert the base malt, including converting specialty grain and 
     adjunct amounts, hop amounts, the expectations you should have for 
     such a conversion, and the challenges involved in doing a good job of 
     it.
     
     But if you are just looking for a simple conversion of the base malt 
     (grain) to an equivalent amount of extract, then the answer is "Of 
     course!"  But you'll need a little more information first:
     
     1. The maximum theoretical yield of the grain you will be using.  
     Sometimes available via the distributor or manufacturer.  Typical for 
     2-row would be 37 points per pound.
     
     2. Your extraction efficiency for your mashing system, e.g. most home 
     brewers have efficiencies from around 65% up to around 93% or so.  It 
     varies a lot from brewer to brewer so you really need to know what 
     _yours_ is.
     
     3. The yield of the extract that you are replacing.  Also sometimes 
     available from the manufacturer.  Also may be available from the 
     BrewingTechniques Market Guide (see 
     http://www.probrewer.com/marketguide.html).  Typical for dry malt 
     extract is about 44 pts/lb, and for liquid, 36-37 pts/lb.
     
     
     Now for the formulae (it takes a couple of steps):
     
     Step 1) Points provided by malt
     
     Pts from malt = (lbs malt)*(max. theor. yld)*(your efficiency)
     
     
     Example: Given 6 lbs American 2-row at 37 pts/lb (max. theoretical 
     yield) and an extraction efficiency of 70%, here's how many points are 
     produced by the malt:
     
     Pts from malt = 6 lbs * 37 pts/lb * 0.70 = 155.4 pts
     
     
     Now you need to provide this many points with _extract_ so the 
     contribution will be the same.  The formula is simple:
     
     
     Step 2) Pounds of extract required
     
     Lbs Extract Req'd = (Pts from malt) / (extract pts per lb)
     
     
     Continuing the example, and assuming dry extract at 44 pts/lb:
     
     
     Lbs Extract Req'd = 155.4 pts / 44 pts per lb = 3.5 lbs of extract
     
     
     
     Good luck!

Subject: Yeast pitching rates


If the correct pitching rate for a lager is 400 ml per hectoliter (26.42 gal.)
for a 1.048 wort and for an ale is half that, then, by my calculations, the
correct rate for 9 gallons of 1.053 wort would be about 150 ml for lager and
75 ml for ale or about 2 1/2 US ounces.  I recently brewed 9 gallons of
1.053 OG ale and pitched a yeast slurry that was almost 1 inch thick at the
bottom of a 1 gallon jug.  The jug was about 6 inches in diameter.  By my
calculations that should have been about 15 ounces of yeast solids.  Even
allowing for error of estimation of the thickness of the yeast, walls of the
jug, non-flat bottom of the jug, and trub in the yeast, I would think I
would have had at least 7 ounces of yeast.  I pitched this yeast in an
essentially unaerated wort as I had read Tracy Aquilla's article in BT.  The
only aeration the wort received was in running it from the CF chiller to the
fermenter.  I fermented at about 63-64F for two weeks and had a final SG
of 1.020.  The yeast was Wyeast 1968, by the way.  I have come to expect at
least 75% apparent attenuation with 1968 when the wort is well aerated and
with fermentation temps in the low 60's.  I would have expected a final SG
of about 1.013.  I would seem that with 2-3 times the recommended pitching rate
I would have had better results.  I have had similar results with unaerated
worts poured to the yeast cake of previous batches which I am sure exceeded
the recommended 2 1/2 ounces of solids.  Are my calculations wrong?  I realize
there can be other things involved but I have not had good luck getting good
attenuation without wort aeration no matter how much yeast I have used.
I know I have made no controlled experiments and don't intend to claim I
have disproved G. Fix's assertions about pitching rates but am curious as to
what is going on in my case.  Any good ideas?
Perhaps I have made some stupid calculation errors (it wouldn't be the first
time).  If so, I would appreciate having that pointed out to me.

Subject: Rhubarb


Brewers,
        Has anyone here used rhubarb in beer? I have seen recipes for rhubarb mead
and wine. It seems that it might be a way to make a pseudo form of one of
the sour beer styles. I made a cranberry pwit beer a couple of years ago
and it turned out rather well with a good level of sourness but not a lot
of cranberry flavor. There was enough orangeness that it couldn't pass as a
straight wit beer, But most people who were told it was a cranberry beer
said it didn't taste like cranberries. So the redness created expectations
that were not met. (people drink with their eyes). Rhubarb is not as red,
and has a flavor that blends well with almost anything. So I figure it is
worth a try.  I propose making my previous pwit recipe except I would use  
 2 lbs. of rhubarb (Stems Only) Cut the stems in half inch size, freeze,
and steam them just before adding them. I would add them shortly after high
krausen with some pectic enzyme. What do you think? I was thinking this
could also work in other psour styles.

I have recently read several posts about home malting and crystal malt

procedures suggested by Ken Schwartz, KennyEddy and Dave Burley, and it
worked pretty good. It works just as they say.
I have a question though now. I am a little mixed up because sometimes
certain malts receive several names. I believe caramel malt is the same as
crystal. Am I right? If not, I believe it would be helpful that somebody
sends a post indicating the names of different kind of malt (those which
have several names).
I need to prepare carapils. Is it the same as dextrine? I need the
procedure to prepare carapils. Any suggestions?

Well this is because it is easier to screw up your beer with someone elses
and get it into another category in the first round. 


You see if you send only one bottle of your best stout that you worked your
ass off to make wonderful and let's just say it won all the local
competitions that you entered it in and even the local Brew Pub  Brew Master
said it was one of the finest examples of dry stout he has ever tasted. That
right there makes it easier for the AHA weazles to take that one bottle of
your finest dry stout and say enter it into... Hmmm let's say the American
Dark lager Flight of the First Round. 






>This seems backwards to me since so
>few beers make it to the final round. Is one beer enough? How many judges
>actually evaluate each entry in the first round? Any other info appreciated. 


How many Judges evaluate the beer? Well the AHA nationals uses the terms
evaluate and judge very loosely. Of all the times I have enterd the
nationals (3 times to be exact) they have somehow screwed up my entry in
every one in some way er another.  


When the beer was put into the category it was meant to (and yes I filled
out all the labels and entry form right... I even have xeroxs to prove it)
it then got to the great judges.


These judges are nothing like the judges that I get in regular comps... I
don't get Al  K. (who is an excellent Judge) or Ed Bronson (Another truly
excellent judge), I get a bunch of novices... That don't fill out the score
sheet and have no freaking idea of what a style is really to be. 


Guys that take off points on a weiss beer for have no noticable hop
bitterness and hop aroma. Guys that tell me that the clove taste in the same
weiss beer is an obvious infection... 


Why should any of us spend $9 plus on an entry for beer to be judged poorly? 


As for why they want 3 bottles in the 2nd round... They need the bottles!


I haven't vented  like this in a while and I now feel great! I need a beer.. 


C'ya!

I use the pump for whirlpool and knockout as well. However, I sanitize it
and the hoses by recirculating boiling wort through it for the last 10 to
15 minutes of the boil. By inserting the end of the hose beneath the
surface, there is no splashing. (Yes, the pump and hoses are clean prior
to this recirc.) 
I could also see someone pumping wort through a counterflow chiller,
depending upon their equipment design.

name I have ever seen was merely a scouring powder similar to Comet or
Ajax. I do remember though, that it rinses alot clearer and I think it
doesn't leave a chalky film despite the fact that it is similar in
compostion to the above named products. It may not be designed
specifically for stainles, but it will work.


Maybe there is someone in the collective that knows for sure.

Subject: March Pump


Kenneth Sullivan asks about a March pump:


I also bought a March pump from C+H.  When people say to keep these
filled with water, they mean while it's in use.  In other words,
it must be downhill from its source (these will not self prime),
and the inlet and outlet must be opened to allow water to fill the
housing before it is turned on.


I got 3 years of use out of mine before the (used) gasket needed
replacing, but this is obviously chance from pump to pump.  I found
that when there is no gap between the two parts of the housing
is when it would start to leak--the gasket was no longer thick
enough that the halves were compressing it when they were brought
together.  I found a new gasket for ~$1.


Have you actually found that it leaks?  From what you wrote it
sounds OK.  If it does leak I think it's the part where there is
no gap rather than the part where there isn't.


When mine first started to leak I was able to get a couple more
brews out of it by wrapping the gasket with teflon tape before
assembly.


BTW, I would suggest removing the pump head after every brew--
there's no orientation where all the water will drain out and
I found algae growing in there after a long brewing hiatus.

I can't imagine it would.


You could also go by a feed store and get some of the yellow fly strips
they use in stables.  I don't think these have an insecticide on them,
they're just paper with a sticky sweet-smelling goo on them.  They come
rolled up in a little tube.  There are several brands.  I don't know the
proper name for the product, but I never even get a weird look asking
for "those yellow fly strips you hang up."

Much depends on the manufacturer of your kegs.  I have pin-lock (Coke) kegs
made by both Firestone (black rubber) and Cornelius (red rubber).  Look at
the engraving on the side of  your kegs to see whether they are Cornelius or 
Firestone.  The Cornelius poppet  valves are the same for their ball-lock and 
pin-lock kegs, so I've been able to  get parts for those from my local
homebrew 
shop.  For the Firestone kegs, I was referred by the local shop to Williams 
Brewing (http://www.williamsbrewing.com),  and from looking at their web
page, 
they seem to have the right poppet vavles for either keg. I've no affiliation 
with Williams and have never ordered from them, but I've seen them
recommended 
in this forum from time to time.

While I don't have total recall like some other posters to the HBD, one
place I saw comments about bottle conditioning was in "The Analysis of
Brewing Techniques" by Fix and Fix.  I think it is in the later part of
the book and as I recall they do give some references.  Eric Warner in
his book on Wheat beer also comments on bottle conditioning of that
style yielding a smoother product.  In the case of Warner, I just read
it last night while preparing for an BJCP Exam Prep class I am
leading.


I have left barley wines in the keg for a very long time (I think I
still have a 1995 version in a keg).  My kegs are in the basement at
55F to 65F.  When (if) I bottle I try to prime at a low level with corn
sugar - it will take a while but they do carbonate.

just one word of caution while using any pumps in a

if you do choose to soft plumb insure you have a quick exit

Subject: Dangers of contamination: dry vs. liquid yeast


Many people say that dry yeast is inherently (or, more likely to be)
contaminated than liquid yeast. I wonder if this statement can still be made or
if tests have been run on products from Lallemand, et al.


My concern with liquid yeast has been that even though I know the smack-pack I
buy has a pure culture inside, once I open it, all bets are off. I try to keep
everything as clean and sanitized as possible, but my kitchen is hardly a
laboratory.


My question is: where is the greater danger? Using dry yeast which may be
contaminated, but doesn't need a starter due to the large amount of viable
yeast, or, using liquid yeast which will need to be stepped up a couple of
times (with the chances of contamination that come in with every step)?


My main concern would be with the first step-up from smack-pack to starter.
Obviously, that's the smallest number of cells and thus the greatest chance for
an infection to overrun the starter. It would seem to be that the primary
benefit of "pitchable" yeast (whether Wyeast XL or White Labs) would be helping
to eliminate the possibility of an infection taking hold in that first starter.


Any thoughts?

Well, I had the same problem but the flies didn't show until I started the
fermentation.  The air lock made a great fly trap. I had to empty it many
times a day.  After a while, they stopped getting trapped.  Either I caught
them all or they left for greener pastures.   I'm not sure which but I
suspect the former.  I don't have a really good solution for you but I will
say the batch came out OK; no contamination.

Can't one adapt an electric range surface burner control?  As I recall, I
took one apart quite a few years ago.  In those days (which, given the way
manufactures stick with success means these days also) the burner was
cycled on and off based on the temperature of a little heating coil under
the knob of the control (not the temperature of the surface burner). 
Upping the temperature setting put more pressure on the bimetallic strip
next to the coil thus requiring the coil to be energized for a longer time.
 The surface burner was energized whenever the coil was energized.  Thus,
the surface burner is running open loop.  If you will, the loop is closed
by the human.  If the pot is heating too slow, the human turns up the knob.
 Then the coil duty cycle increases.  As I recall, the cycle times were on
the order of a minute depending on knob setting.  


You can observe (hear) this by listening carefully to the surface burner
control  You'll hear it click on and off.  Or, turn on the stove and
observe your house power watt-hour meter.  You'll see the rate of rotation
vary as the control cycles on and off.

Ammonia.  I have been saving the labels for years.  Have over 150. Here is
my system.  I saved a large plastic pretzel "jar" with a wide mouth and
enough depth (~15") to hold a bottle. Saved the jar lid also.  Filled the
jar about 3/4 full (need room for the bottle to fit without overflow) with
an ammonia solution (don't remember the concentration-- maybe 2 parts H2O
to one part ammonia) and replaced the lid.  When ever I have a beer I
haven't had before, bring home the bottle.  I put it in the jar and replace
the lid. (The lid pushes the bottle down so the label is submerged.) Maybe
in an hour, maybe in four hours, the label is loose.  (It is very
temperature dependent.  I keep it in the garage so in the summer it is
fast, in the winter very slow.)


I have noticed that the European bottles are very fast (straight H2O would
work fine) but the American bottles are as you say "hermetically sealed". 
I have had a problem with some metallic coated labels such as the Yuengling
Black & Tan.  The metal comes off the label before the label comes off the
bottle.


If you keep the lid on tight all the time, the solution will last for
months however it gets pretty cruddy.

Subject: More yeast pitching


     Hi all,
     
     Dan M. writes:
     
     "Repitching is an easy and economical way to get the best performance 
     out of your yeast. With better beer as a byproduct, why would anyone 
     not practice this procedure?"
     
     There is one very simple reason:  I don't always brew with the same 
     strain over and over again!
     
     Of course, what Dan says is correct, if you want to brew with the same 
     yeast several times and your technique is very sanitary, and you're 
     timely about harvesting, etc.  Whenever I make a strong beer I make a 
     normal gravity beer a week in advance using the same yeast (sort of a 
     giant, consumable yeast starter).  Pitching a huge amount of yeast 
     really is the only way to make a strong beer well.
     
     There are many times that I don't reuse the yeast though.  Bavarian 
     Weizen yeasts are so distinctive that they are tough to use on other 
     styles.  An ESB just isn't quite right when fermented with a nice 
     Weizen yeast.
     
     For those times, you are obligated to make up a large starter.  It 
     really isn't hard, and you can get more cells than Dan's #'s simply by 
     providing some extra oxygen to the starter.  Agitation is good to.
     
     Have fun!

because I care enough about whatever job I have (or had) to do it well.
Now you see why I don't tend to explain myself.
There.  That oughta keep the guy who *could* cut it flippin' burgers from

Subject: Delta-T revisited


The idea of pumping heavy low-voltage current through a conductive
portion of a RIMS's recirc path may not be unrealistic, especially for
those who seek kinder, gentler heating.  To boost 30 pounds (10#
grain, 13 qt water) at around a degree a minute requires 1800 BTU per
hour, or about 600 watts.  A ten-foot length of 3/8-in copper tubing
has an interior area of around 120 square inches (using Arkansas
Metric pi = 3.0);  a soothing 5 watts per square inch.  Such tubing
has roughly the same weight per foot (0.2#) as AWG1 wire and so
presumably the same resistance, about 0.15 milliohms per foot.  That
ten-foot length, around 1-1/2 milliohms, would dissipate 600 watts at
just under a volt applied. 
So, how to push 600 amperes down the length?  The reasonable paradigm
would seem to be the despised soldering gun.  Our tubing is
represented by the (relatively) high-resistance tip and current is
provided by a transformer with a single-turn secondary consisting of a
length of heavy-wall brass tubing flattened in the middle and bent
into a narrow U.  The flattening is important not just for ease of
forming but also because a hollow tube makes a poor secondary winding:
too many flux lines fail to impinge on a conductor.  Note that there
is no ferromagnetic core;  just a plastic bobbin on the flattened tube
and a few hundred turns of magnet wire on it.  
A fair approximation of this would be to flatten an 8-in length of 3/4
or 1-in OD copper tubing, perhaps even doubling it over, and winding
the primary - 150 turns - on it over a suitably insulated bobbin.
This would then be attached near the ends of the liquid tube, making
the straight bar on a D-shape; the tube could be coiled and given
insulating sleeving or spacers so the turns don't short out.
The weak part is the attachment between the tube and the "bar"
secondary.  The connection must be very low-resistance to avoid
localized overheating.
Stainless steel tubing, while harder to work and connect - you'd want
to gas-weld lugs to it - would have the advantage of higher
resistance.

I apologize if this topic has been covered before, but I haven't seen it

boiling water in my 10 gal cooler.  I resorted to drawing off about 1 gal 
of runnings, bringing it to ~190F, and then adding it back to the mash to 
hit my temps & mashout. (First rest was `at` 145 - I was aiming for 152, but 
miscalculated heat loss during transfer of the hot water.  Next rest was 
154F.  Mashout was 165F.)


I have never seen a discussion of this technique before - everything I've 
read suggests boiling water additions to raise mash temps (or decocting a 
thick portion of mash).  Does this method present a problem, especially 
when going from a low temp rest?  I don't know much about mash chemistry, 
but I'm guessing that there is a lot of starch in solution, as well as 
enzymes and tiny bits of grain - which is why I didn't boil the runnings 
(plus the fact I did not want excessive carmel flavour).


So I'm wondering if this technique has any drawbacks with regards to 1) 
killing enzymes 2) doing something to the starch and 3) creating off 
flavours.  If not, does anyone have a simple formula for calculating how 
much runnings should be drawn off, raised to a specific temp, and then 
added back to hit a target temp?


Thanks for any advice.
