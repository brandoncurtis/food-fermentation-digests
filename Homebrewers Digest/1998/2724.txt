Hi to all (just back from vacation in Canada),


I also had (once) small vermin or Weavils or *$&#(`at`*'s or thingies or
little buggers in the malt. At work I tried to kill them by exposure to
vacuum (for at least 30 minutes). The only effect was to see them
growing. But they didn't explode.
In the same desiccator I put some dry ice (CO2). That killed the beasts.
I don't know if it was the CO2 or the temperature (dry ice = - 80
degr.C).
But after all I throwed the malt away, because I was afraid that the
Weavils had converted part of the malt in unwanted raw material for my
beer!
Heat will also kill, but I'm afraid that the caracter of the malt will
change.

Subject: Wort souring for p-Lambic


Hi all,


I'm going to try my hand at a p-Lambic next weekend. The recipe
I have says to cool the wort collected from the mash (before the boil)
to 125F, rack to a clean 6 gal fermenter, add a pound of pale malt, 
and cover for 24 hours. Then skim the surface, strain into the boiling 
pot, and continue as for a normal boil.


My question pertains to the pound of pale malt. Should it be whole
or crushed?


Happy Brewing,

Subject: Overnight boiling


Mash and sparge on Friday night.
Boil the wort for 10 minutes.
Switch the power off, insulate the boiler with blanket and 
leave it until Saturday morning.
On Saturday morning I start the boil again, add the hops and 
finish the brew process.


I was wondering if you can think of problems which can occur.
Will it depend on how far the wort cool down?
Will I have DMS problems or will it boil off in any case?
Will the copper boiler be a problem because of the acidity of the wort?
Can I add the hops and leave it overnight in the wort?

Subject: RIMS Ideas


Hiya:


I've been following the recent "induction RIMS" thread with passing interest,
and to those of you who are currently thinking about designing or improving your
RIMS I'd like to suggest some alternate design ideas for the heating chamber.


Micah Milspaw reports to me that for his RIMS heater, he uses a coil of copper
tubing that runs through a sealed container filled with oil (Micah sez the stuff
the uses is like "liquid vasoline when warm," but in response to my questions he
indicated that a water / glycol mixture would probably also work). The imersion
heater(s) -- which can be the cheapo high density sort -- is also installed in
this container, which I envision as being about one or two gallons in size and
could be made of mild steel, aluminium, or just about any sort of metal.  The
control sensor is in the outlet side of the tubing, and controls (via a simple
thermostat and relay) the heating element.  It's thus like the "coils in the
HLT" design that's been mentioned before, but uses a shorter coil that's in a
fluid that gives better heat transfer than water.


A variant on this theme would be to use a short counterflow chiller that's
constructed entirely of metal (a-la the Super Chiller mktd by Hearts Home Brew
[BTW, really sweet chiller, this]), with the "coolant" lines plumbed to a small
water + glycol reservoir and a small pump (which, of course, would need to be
able to handle hot liquid, but would not need to be food grade or magnetic
drive).  The immersion heater would be in the glycol reservoir. You could keep
the glycol at a constant temp (e.g., 175F) with a simple thermoswitch and
control the temp of the mash by controlling the glycol pump, or of course you
could get really exotic with some PID circuitry that controls the mash temp by
adjusting the wort pump speed, the glycol temp, and the glycol pump speed.


These designs appear to have several advantages.  First, they avoid the need to
keep the flow rate relatively high (as in traditional immersion heater RIMS) to
avoid scorching the wort -- the wort cannot get hotter than the bath fluid.
Second, they can be CIP'd very easily.  Third, they *might* provide enough
heating "umph" to handle temp boosts of 1C/min without overheating the wort.
Fourth, unlike the HLT design, you'd get a much quicker temp response, owing to
the smaller volume of the bath and the higher thermal conductance of the fluid.


And, of course, you don't need a degree in EE to try them out without risking
electrocution (though you'd need to take the same reasonable precautions as you
would with a conventional immersion heater RIMS).


Worth considering.

Pat Babcock posted to HBD#2723:
- --------quote-------------
Some may remember this exchange back in February, the forwarded being
the last installment. Immediately afterwards, having a good supply of
replacement o-rings purchased via a gift certificate to my local Brew
& Grow (thanks, Mom!), I ran downstairs, grabbed three of my least
favorite and most empty kegs, replaced the bung seals, lubricated
them  with Vaseline [tm], sealed and pressurized them. Just over
three months later, they are chewing gum, folks. I went down to open
the kegs, and large gobs of o-ring stuck to the keg, and to the bung.
The ring came off in pieces.


Based on this, I have to reiterate my original "don't
do it". It just takes longer than the other types of seals seem
to, but it breaks the black rubber seals down just as well. And,
- ----end quote-----------


Sorry to hear that, Pat!  I will not attempt to deny you your experience
but my experience with Vaseline(tm) remains free of the problems you have
encountered.  Further investigation is needed to explain this discrepancy:


Application:  How was your Vaseline(tm) applied?  I apply the thinnest of
layers in two areas - on the keg lid where the o-ring contacts it and on
the topside of the o-ring where it contacts the keg.  Upon application the
ring and the lid surface looks wet but no excess of Vaseline(tm) is to be
found.  If I were to wipe a dry finger on those areas with Vaseline(tm) I
would find my finger only slightly shiny, not unlike if one were to touch
their nose (on the outside, that is!).


Time of contact:  Nearly all my beers are consumed well before three months
in the keg, as you describe.  However, I have had some (barleywines, oily
oatmeal stouts, way overhopped IPAs, nasty fruit beers, nuclear
doppelbocks) which weren't as quickly consumed and spent greater than 9
months out in the cooler.  These showed no trace of the deterioration you
describe.


Storage temperature:  You made no mention of the storage temp for your
kegs, but mine spend all their time at about 45F.  Everything in this hobby
is time and temperature related and I cannot believe this would be exempt
from that dependence.


Storage location:  I do not know if you placed your test kegs in the same
location you store your "regular" kegs, but were they close to a motor?
Ozone given off from open contact motors does a wonderful job on rubber.
This is grasping at straws but it is a possibility, tho remote.


Again, I do not wish to discount your experience but only wish to determine
why it happened to you and not me.  I feel your admonition, "don't do it",
is valid.  It's like playing in the street or on railroad tracks...I did it
and lived but I agree it isn't a good idea for you.  However, carrying the
metaphor further, I will continue to play in the street while you're on the
curb telling others to stay out.  I'm comfortable with that arrangement.


Now, sing along with me - "Happy trails to you, until we meet again..."

Subject: Another BigBrew 98 question (long)


Dearest digest,        
        Is my beer ruined? Two significant parts: 


(1) I used my usual wort aeration method of siphoning with a
Bernoulli-effect tube and a spray widget, combined with agressive
rolling-back-and-forth. I pitched three packets ( 5 g. each) of
Nottingham dry yeast. Although fermentation was aggressive (foamy mess
through my airlock, despite having 4.75 gal. in a 6.5 gal carboy), it
had a longer lag time than I expected (>24 hours before it really became
aggressive). Therefore, I figured that there wasn't enough oxygen for
the wee beasties in a big beer, and I figured the fermantation would
stick, which has happened to me a few times lately. All of this figuring
meant that I didn't bother to check the S.G. before I transfered to the
secondary this past Sunday--I went ahead and transferred it onto a
champagne yeast starter. Now to the ugly part....


(2) After the subject brewing session, as I was cleaning up my
equipment, I couldn't help but squeeze out all the wort left in the
hops. I had a lot of break trapped by the Irish moss. I tried boiling
the mess, but didn't get enough separation when I cooled it. I stuck it
in the fridge to let it settle. Three weeks later, it is about equally
split into break and clear wort. Saturday night I siphoned off the clear
wort (~25 oz.), tasted (yum!) and reboiled it. I cooled it and pitched a
(rehydrated) 5 g. packet of dry Red Star champagne yeast. When I had a
big crusty krausen, I poured it into the bottom of a 6.5 gal carboy, and
transferred (gently) the beer from the primary on top of the champagne
yeast starter. As I was transferring, I took a hydrometer reading and
saw that my S.G. = 1.012 (O.G. = 1.090), so I doubt I'll see much
reduction in gravity. 


I am currently seeing very little activity (starter finishing up?). My
concern is that I have all of that air sitting on top of the beer (4.5
gal. in a 6.5 gal. carboy) without sufficient CO2 production to displace
it. I have a long aging process ahead, and I am worried about developing
a wet-cardboard flavor. So, IMBR? Should I go ahead and transfer it to a
keg and try to purge with CO2? How about into a 5 gal. carboy? Any other
advice? Should I drink it all immediately to avoid oxidation? (Obviously
this is my first barleywine, and my first intentional aging.)


TIA and chiao,
Doug Moyer
Salem, VA


p.s. It tastes great so far, although aging would definitely be
beneficial to mellow the alcohol's aggressiveness.


p.p.s. I am sure that some caring souls are concerned that methods like
mine will lead (eventually) to death by botulism poisoning. Therefore,
kiddies, do NOT try this at home.

Subject: poly clar


Hi all,


Polyclar is a brandname for PVPP (polyvinylpolypyrrolidon) from ISP
(International Specialty Products). IMO it is a kind of plastic.
In contrast with (silica)gels it adsorbs polyphenols, mainly from the
hops.
As you (could) know is the cold trub the combination of  protein and
polyphenols
which can convert in permanent trub.
So it is possible to choose for removing protein or polyphenols or
possible combinations.
Typical dosing 20-50 g/hl
Polyclar is on the market in different grades: more than 1 usable
(Polyclar Super R)
and for single use (Polyclar 10, fine grade; Polyclar SB 100, coarse
grade; Polyclar QM).
Polyclar 10 Polyclar Super R


color white white to off-white
solubility insol. in water, acids, alkali, solvents insol. in water,

Polyclar QM (Quick mix) (almost equivalent for Polyclar 10) is a wet
filtercakewith 27% solids. The advantage is that is ready for using, so
it doesn't need preparing with water.

This weekend I had the fortune to sample  a bottle of D. Carnegie & 
Co. Stark Porter brewed by AB Pripps Bryggerrier,  Sundsvall, Sweden. 
 I found that it had a rich, smoky taste unlike any other porter I've 
tried.  


Is there a whole range of these porters that I've never known of?  It 
doesn't seem to fit either of the BJCP porter categories; are there 
sufficient other examples of this style to warrant a separate Swedish 
of Strong Porter category?

it?

Subject: Spent grain baking, _Handbook of Brewing_


I found another source of information about spent grain baking this 
weekend in _The Handbook of Brewing_ (William A. Hardwick, ed. New 
York: Marcel Dekker, 1995).  Pages 520-521 discuss preparing the 
spent grain for baking and provide a table listing different baked 
products and appropriate percentages of spent grain to add.


Speaking of _The Handbook of Brewing_, I haven't seen a mention of it 
here.  It is aimed toward a mega- and microbrewery audience, but it 
looks interesting.  I only had a few minutes to glance over it while 
at the library, but it seemed to have some potentially useful 
information, including a chapter of brewing formulae.  The chapter 
authors were mostly mega-brewery affiliated, but Bert Grant wrote 
the chapter on hops, and one of the Siebel faculty wrote another 
chapter, though I don't remember which.  


I did notice that in reference to boil evaporation rates, the only 
comment was that a minimum of 8% was necessary, with no mention of 
maximum.

Subject: Airborne nasties; weevils; hop around the clock; apartment kegging


In HBD 2721, Hans Hansen asks how we aerate without risking infection:
> What about all of that airborne
> stuff that you are trying to keep out with airlocks?


For many of us, that's mostly dust, cat hair, and bugs, not airborne
individual bacteria.  My house air is clean enough that I don't get
infections.  The key is to pitch plenty of yeast, and aerate so they
can grow more.  They will rapidly change the wort so it's a bad
environment for bacterial growth.


I'd only worry about sanitizing your aeration air if, like Al K, you
have found that you are getting infections.


If you need to, and you "don't want to spend the $ for" an O2 bottle
set-up, you could check into an aquarium air-pump and filter.  Check
back issues of HBD for details.  Don't trust the "bubble air through
sanitizer" types of set-up, as most of the groaties in the air will
just ride safely through in the middle of the bubble.


Relatedly, Dr. Pivo posts in 2722:
> I've been fiddling with airlocks.  The results are pretty preliminary,
> but it's starting to look like you don't need them.


Airlocks keep particulates and bugs out, and help keep the CO2 layer
intact once primary fermentation has slowed down.  They aren't an O2
barrier.  There was some discussion on HBD a few months ago about
designing a truly osmosis-resistant airlock.


Domenick Venezia posts in 2723:
> This is not surprizing as open fermentation is/was widely used to great
> success.


This is usually the primary fermentation.  I haven't heard of anyone who
stays with true open fermentation once the krausen has fallen.


Domenick also writes:
> I know a brewer who brews great beer and never uses an airlock
> on his carboys.  He just uses plastic wrap and a rubber band.


Just to be fussy about it, that's not really an open fermentation.  Open
fermentation lets O2 get at the fermentation.  That's just an informal
airlock.  It depends on a continuous outflow of CO2 to maintain an O2-free
environment -- but really, so does a regular airlock.

beer.  You might need to add a protein rest...

In HBD 2723, Alan Keith Meeker asks about training hops clockwise.  This
is because they will follow the sun as they grow, so you should train
them in that direction.  In the USA, the sun goes east-to-west in the
southern part of the sky.  Your vines follow it, from east through south
to west, then they hurry back around through north to face east again.


This is clockwise as seen from above.  In the southern hemisphere, the
sun goes across the northern part of the sky, so you would train them
clockwise as seen from below.


In Ecuador, hop vines grow in vertical loops.

 topped it off with preboiled water.   My inlaws & I killed it over

I think the original intent that Tracy had was that if you grow the yeast
under constant aeration and provide no gowth limiting amounts of FAN then
you can pitch wiht no aeration.  This is hardly his "theory"  Research has
shown this to be the case.  For starters (grin) read CRC Critical Reviews
in mIcrobiology "Ethanol tolerance in Yeasts" Vol 13, Issue 3 as well as
Applied and Environ. Micro vol 48, no 3 p. 639 as a start.  These guy were
able to ferment 28 P wort and repitch the yeast five times with no loss in
viability.  They even fermented 32 P with no problems.  I'm not saying that
this how you should make beer though.


Researchers who have studied fermentation under anaerobic conditions have
to go to major extremes to eliminate any and all oxygen.  If even a trace
is present the yeast suck it up and it effects the results.  So I feel that
if you make your starter with proper amounts of FAN and use constant
aeration you should not have to worry about aeration too much.  I typically
chill my wort to 4 C to drop as much cold break as possible and then filter
into my fermenter and have had no stcuk ferments.  I don't brew lagers at
all though.  


Also between the recent bigbrew discussion and the "high gravity article in
BT I was remind that "alcohol tolerance" is really and ill defined term and
that champagne yeast is really no more alcohol tolerant than is ale yeast.
There is much more to getting complete fermentation than just throwing more
yeast at it.  The BT author is largely incorrect in stating that there is a
12% alcohol limit.  This is largely a momily. See above and the literature,
particularly wrt to Sake'.

for the BJCP to boycott the AHA nationals.  This would send a clear message

another laternative can be formed.  Also george gripes about the AHA not

better jobs.  I still subscribe to Zymurgy and am concerned that it is

Subject: Copper Tub


Whilst out flea-marketing, I came across an old copper washing machine
(patent date 1911 from the Laun-DRY-ette company). It is approximately 30
inches in diameter and 24 inches in height with a drain on the bottom edge.
It came on a sturdy (albeit rusty) metal frame with castors. It has a 3
inch square patch in the center of the bottom that is welded in place. It
has a tight fitting lid that appears to be aluminum. The gauge of the
copper is not very high and is probably less than a mil. The cost was $25
(without even haggling).


Some questions:


Can this contact wort or is there some alloy that might have been used to
weld the seams that would prevent it?


Can I apply heat to the vessel directly without concerns (ie is it thick
enough)?


Are there any concerns with the patch welded in the bottom?


How much volume will this hold (read: I'm too lazy to find the formula and
do the math)?


What should I do to make this brew-worthy?


I would like to use this as a kettle rather than mash tun, as I don't plan
on making 30+ gallon batches any time soon...


If I can't use it, the wife is going to put plants in it (cringe!).

YeastLab A09  "English"  is Ringwood, according to a Dec. 14, 1994 post to
HBD by Dan McConnell, who produces YeastLab's liquid yeasts (not the dry).
Dan's Yeast Culture Kit Co. also has it at
http://oeonline.com/~pbabcock/yckcotbl.html (no affiliation except that Dan
is a friend who gives me yeast, but, as Dave Draper is fond of quoting me
as having said, "I can't be bought for a mere $3.50").  There are at least
two distinctly different strains that are called Ringwood.  The real McCoy
is a strong top cropper and has high O2 needs.  A local brewpub (Pugsley
design, so the yeast is authentic as Pugsley is affiliated with Ringwood
founder Peter Austin) using it actually pumps over a fountain of fermenting
wort partway through the ferment to aerate it.  They just throw in a
submersible pump and pump up a frothy fountain.  Not surprisingly, their
ales have a distinctive diacetyl house character.


NCYC 1187, which forms no yeast head at all, is also often referred to as
Ringwood on HBD.  I don't know why as it's a much different yeast, selected
for quick sedimentation in cylindro-conical fermenters.  It produces no
diacetyl in my experience.  This yeast is used by Ann Arbor's other brewpub
(Arbor Brewing Co., the better one in my not so humble opinion, and not
because of the yeast).

Yes, I read the write up. Maybe you don't need them. But,then again,
using a plastic airlock is about the easiest thing to do in brewing,
IMHO. And it gives you a pretty good indication of your fermentation

HBD-
After finishing up my first batch of beer made in my new 10 gal Gott, I got a
bittersweet surprise:
My efficiency went up from 75% to 85%!  (over a slotted copper 5 gal boil pot,
now no longer doing double duty)


On the down side, I now have to figure out what to do with 7 gallons of OG
1.075 beer, when I was expecting 7 gallons of 1.050 beer.  Typically with this
recipe, I add 12 oz of orange juice concentrate to the secondary for my OJ
Amber Ale.  Then I saw (finally) in the late issue of BT, an article on
brewing more homebrew by diluting high gravity homebrew:  Brew it to high
gravity, then diluting with water at packaging.  Based on this article, I was
thinking of diluting the OJ concentrate to one gallon with water, then adding
it to the secondary.
Other than the intuitively repulsive idea of diluting home brewed beer, does
this sound kosher?  I mean orthodox?  No wait, I mean zymurgilogically sound?

Your local auto mechanic has the answer to this.  In cars, rubber

products.  In the case of O-rings and seals for kegs, I suppose
some brands are neoprene and others aren't.  Virtually all O-rings

Use silicon lube on rubber instead of Vaseline.  It won't eat it.
You can find 'food grade' silicon, but personally I just use the
hardware store variety.  Just make sure it doesn't have various
additives commonly used in lubricants.  Some brands of silicon
lube actually add petroleum products, which kills the advantage
of using silicon.  One key is to check the label to see if it

Subject: Esters and phenols / lager malt for ale / Weissheimer malts


     Hi all,
     
     This is a peeve of mine, so please forgive the analness of it:  the 
     clove character found in German wheat beers is NOT from an ester!  It 
     is a phenolic compound (4-vinyl guiaucol) that we perceive as 
     clove-like spiciness.
     
     The banana character is indeed from an ester, iso-amylacetate.
     
     I don't know if Wyeast 3068 is multi-strain, but "delbruekii" is not 
     lager yeast (which is S. uvarum, formerly S. carlsbergensis).  Lager 
     yeast wouldn't be too prone to producing the funky flavors of 
     Bavarian Weizen, anyway.
     ----------------------------------
     Michael K. asks about using "lager" malts for ales, and tells us that 
     he was told that doing so may produce too much diacetyl.
     
     It won't effect diacetyl levels.  The major difference between malt 
     labeled as "Pils" (or "Pilsner") and "pale ale" is the kilning 
     schedule.  Pale ale malts are kilned at a higher temperature, making 
     them a bit darker than Pilsner malt.  This also effects the flavor of 
     the malt.  Pilsner malt will have more SMM in it, which can cause 
     increased levels of DMS in your beer (yes Bill G., I know DMS is 
     necessary to a point...).  That may or may not be welcome in your ESB.
     
     For what it's worth, I brew ales with Pilsner malt quite often.  In 
     fact, I just courageously brewed a South English Brown ale using 
     something like 50% Munich malt and 30% pilsner malt (both from 
     Germany).  The wort smelled great!
     -----------------------------------
     Somebody (sorry, don't remember who) asked if Weissheimer malt is well 
     modified.  They may even have asked specifically about Munich malt (I 
     didn't sleep enough last night, which is why I'm so vague, sorry).
     
     Somewhere I do have Weissheimer specs.  While I can't post the exact 
     numbers now, they are well modified (as the original poster's "chew 
     test" indicated).  In fact, German maltsters aim for well modified 
     malt when producing Munich malt.  The reason given is so that they 
     have higher concentrations of amino acids available to react with 
     sugars to form melanoidins during the kilning of the malt.
     
     Have fun!

Just for the record, Budweiser in the UK is brewed under contract

Oh, and regarding Budweiser and oxidation, I believe it was Dr. Fix
who once talked about a problem with oxidation of Bud at a contract
plant in Japan.  It seems that in the interest of efficiency, some
piping was altered from the A-B-approved plans.  This resulted in
the splashing of hot wort and a subsequent darkening of the beer.
I cannot say for sure that I recall any flavour/aroma problems were
reported, so I won't guess.  If anyone knows more details of this story,

>>>>>At the GABF I had an ale made with Ringwood yeast - it had a very
interesting taste profile! Has anyone here had any experience with this
yeast? Is it a single strain? Any widespread commercial examples of its
use? Reliable sources of cultures?<<<<<<<<<<<


White Labs of San Diego cultures and supplies the Ringwood strain to both
commercial breweries
and homebrew supply retailers.  They call it British Ale yeast and it's
description is as follows:
>
WLP005- British Ale Yeast:Our most award winning yeast strain, this yeast is
a little more attenuative then our English Ale WLP002. Like most English
strains, this yeast produces malty beers. Excellent for all English style
ales including bitter, pale ale, porter, and brown ale. Attenuation is
67-74%. Flocculation is High. Optimum fermentation temperature is 65-70
degrees. 
<
You're right.  Its taste profile is a complex fruitiness that becomes more
distinctive the more you experience its taste. It produces excellent stouts
and porters.
The yeast was used in a couple of AHA NHC Gold Medal winners last year.

Affiliated as a retailer that outsells White Labs 4 to 1 over Wyeast.
