Subject: Trebernbrot / Treberweizen


Hello all,


I've two hints for usage of spent grains:


TREBERNBROT
   (bread with spent grains):


In 1996 we visited the beer garden of Brewery Aying - a rather small 
brewery but IMHO one of the best ones in Bavaria ...if not Germany! 
It's located on the countryside near Munich.
Needless to say - food and beer were delicious, but the "Trebernbrot" 
attracted all the rest of our attention! The Austrian ;-) chef even 
gave us a loaf of the bread for free but he made a big secret about the 
composition.
Luckily the waitress was more communicative and told us, that it would 
be very essential to dry the spent grains prior to doughing in ...and I 
think that's not only because of inhibiting spoiling of the wet grains 
during storage.


Since then we baked "some batches" of Trebernbrot at home with big 
success. On brewday we dry some of the spent grains `at`160C on a baking 
sheet (shallow layer, only max.1/2" thick). Then we pack it into 
portions of 250 grams each (batch size) and store them in the freezer.


Helen's Trebernbrot recipe:


200-250g dried Trebern (spent grains)


250g per kg of flour is the highest level that has proven to give good 
bread.


300g rye flour
700g wheat flour
30g dry extract of sour dough
20g dry baker's yeast
tsp honey
tsp salt


Season according to your palate with crushed coriander, aniseed, 
caraway and fennel.


Mash in ...er, dough in with approx. 850 mL water and let rest 
overnight. Wake up early and bake your "Trebernbrot".
 
~~~~~


TREBERWEIZEN


Recently I brewed a wheat without any barley malt but just mashed it 
onto the spent grains cake of the previous batch. The resulting beer is 
so good (IMHO) that I dare to post my records to this forum.


I removed approx. the top 1/3-1/2 of the spent grains cake after I 
lautered the first batch - an ale from 12kg grain bill (10% wheat, rest 
barley and special malts - I use an insulated mash-/lautertun).


I added 6kg of wheat malt and 1kg of rye malt. I was not able to do 
exact calculations - so I was happy to reach 44C after doughing in with 
12L water of 53C. The consistency was very pastry. My goal was to get 
some ferulic acid (precursor for 4VG ... the clovey one) with this 20 
minutes rest. I don't worry about the glucans (rye malt) since I know 
from own experience, that it's probably impossible to get stuck mashes 
with a  lautersystem made of slotted pipes (but warning! - I do now 
that friends using false bottoms get stuck mashes when using even small 
amounts of rye). I didn't neutralize the carbonates in my hard brewing 
water until sacc. temps. Ferulic acid is best formed at 40-45C and a pH 
above 5.7 (according to Narziss).


Adding 11L of boiling water yielded in a sacc. temp. of 67C. I then 
neutralized the negative effects of residual alkalinity (11dH in my 
case) by adding 200g of acid (lactic) malt. Within one hour (...had to 
finish the other batch in the meantime) temp. dropped to 65C.


After adding another 6L boiling water I ...er - my mash... finally 
reached 71C ...no more room in the mashtun to add further water and no 
more time to make a decoction - so I started lautering right after 
finishing the previous batch (approx. 20 mins) at given temp. of 70C 
(no mashout).


FWH with 40g Yakima Cascade Pellets, 5.5%a (...I like that hop and 
luckily I've got a good friend over there in Washington).


Open fermentation with Weihenstephan E38, a local, rather clovey wheat 
strain - but W#3068 should give similar results.


That was a hard brewday - one of those days to remember ...proud (why 
not!) of the work that has been done. I got 36L Treberweizen `at`12.8P, 
25L Coriander Ale and (I did a split boil on the first batch) 31L 
Copper Ale. -Total 92L ...think that should last for a month or so ;-)


The Treberweizen brew turned out very viscous, with a creamy head, very 
clovey and ...now that I think of it... maybe a little hint on spent 
(oxidized?) grains aroma that blends well with the overall clovey 
character.


Sorry for being so long winded but thought there's some room for us in 
the queue now.

sehr zum Wohle!

Howdy folks. I saw a couple of ads in recent HBDs, which means that summer
is here, and the janitors are spending their time doing something
worthwhile (not shackled to the server). I appreciate very much what those
guys are doing (for free, I might add), and I won't complain about the ads.
Here is what I do to deal with unwanted ads in messages. I hit the page
down key, and remember that I enjoyed being outside in my garden, or
washing my car, or mowing the lawn. Why should I deprive the hardworkingest
digest janitors of the same simple pleasures, or expect them to deprive
themselves?


Keep up the good work, I love the result every day.


The beer-related posts tend to be of such high quality that I don't care
about the occasional solicitation. Sometimes the ads can be funny to read
in and of themselves.

Is there a good resource out there for sensory evaluation that includes
commercial beers that I don't need to spike? I know about rolling rock and
DMS, and bud and acetaldehyde. Others? Webpages that satiate this need?

Thanks for the heads-up regarding the classic beer style series at the
Ames, IA Waldenbooks. 1-8 except #3 and #7. The price was so unbelievable
(sub $5 each), I had to snap them up. Are there others out there who have
seen this offer at a bookstore that include the other four books (# 3, 7,

Subject: Mashing Equipment


Hello all,


I am about to make the jump into all-grain brewing. Anyway, after much
research (only because money is involved,) I have decided to buy a 54 
quart
kettle with a spigot, Cache 125K burner, Gott cooler, Phalse bottom, and a
immersion chiller. My questions:


I brew 5 gallons batches now. I assume a 54qt boiler will not be big 
enough
for 10 gallon batches. Should I go for the cheaper 40qt kettle? Should I
hang-on the the 10 gallon batch dream?


Can I find a modified keg at a comparable price? 


What type of hop screen will work best for the boiler. Keep in mind, that 
I
own about 3 screwdrivers, a hammer and have *never* been called 'handy'.


The Phalse bottom is ends with a hose and clamp, correct? Is it difficult 
to
build a spigot for the cooler, instead?


Any general Comments about this proposed set-up?


TIA,

All,


        Another data point on the 3068 thread.  This winter, I 
made a dunkelweizen after which I racked a weizen onto the 
yeast cake.  The dunkelweizen has the wonderful banana flavors; 
the weizen does not.  The two beers were fermented at similar
primary temperatures, but the secondary on the dunkelweizen
was a bit cooler and fluctuating.

Subject: YEast growth, aeration, etc.


George De Piro brings up the issue of ester formation in relation to
several factors, including aeration, lipid synthesis, and fermentation
temperature. This is a very complex issue and I do not pretend to be
an expert on this subject, but as my thesis topic touches on these
issues, I feel inclined to offer a few remarks:


First of all, I just want to mention that despite decades of research
on ester production in beer, there seems to be very little that
researchers absolutely agree upon. Over 80 different esters have been
identified in beer and there is definitely more than one mechanism
involved. One thing that is agreed upon is that ester formation in
beer is too fast not to be enzymatically assisted. Some esters seem to
be dependent on a single enzyme, while others can be formed from
multiple enzymes. Throw in the fact that all the precursors (and some
of the enzymes) are shared by other biochemical pathways and you have
a terribly complex situation. Most research focuses on just a few
esters (notably the acetate esters) but it should be remembered that
process parameters that affect one ester in a certain way may not
affect other esters in the same way at all. On top of all that, ester
formation is very much strain-dependent. That being said . . .

Yes, it is generally agreed upon that ester synthesis competes with
yeast growth for the pool of acetyl CoA (or higher homologues) and so
anything that promotes growth (such as the availability of O2 to
synthesize unsaturated fatty acids) will inherently suppress ester
formation (and vice versa). There are definitely some faults in this
theory (esp. regarding temperature), but it holds true in many
circumstances. For instance, elevated ester levels in high gravity
brewing are usually attributed to the fact that lower relative
oxygenation rates, increased osmotic pressure, and higher ethanol
levels all work to suppress yeast growth. However, work published by
folks at the Brewing Research Foundation in 1994 (JASBC, v52, pp84-90)
shows that oxygenation levels have the opposite effect on isoamyl
acetate formation over the range of 0.75 to 5.4 ppm of O2 in their
pilot-scale fermentations using both lager and ale strains of yeast.
They pretty much discount the whole yeast growth vs. ester formation
model and attribute ester formation solely to the availability of
higher alcohols (although they were primarily looking at just isoamyl
acetate).


> Another point that both Kunze and the folks at Siebel make is that
> decreased fermentation temperature increases overall ester
production.
> This is the opposite of what most homebrewers believe.  Any
comments?


I read the same thing in Kunze, but I don't believe it for a second.
I'm looking at a stack of about 10 articles right now that all show
that increased fermentation temperature increases overall ester
concentration in the final beer, and they all have data to back it up.
One reason given for this phenomenon is that increased temperature
increases the fluidity of the cell membrane and allows esters to pass
more easily into the medium. But there is little hard evidence to
support this theory--it may just be that the increased levels of
higher alcohols provides more substrate for ester formation. Kunze may
think otherwise but I would ask him to ponder his statement that ester
production is decreased by higher fermentation temperature (page 331)
while sipping a Trappist ale that was fermented at 26C.

Hmm, I don't know about this. It is true that perception of one
compound is influenced by the level of other compounds present, but I
think in this case Kunze was just wrong about the whole temperature
thing. Trust your nose.


I've really only touched the surface of this issue but I hope I
answered your question.

re Jim Liddil's post...


I have been in private correspondence with Jim about some of this
before...


I have no problems with yeast grown *aerobically* and pitched without
aeration of the wort. The oxygen demand of such yeast has been met
already (ie. the yeast membrane already has high ~1% sterol content).
The Bass patent is along these lines too (but not exactly the same):
aerate the yeast to convert glycogen into sterol, then pitch such yeast
into unaerated wort. Pitching rate is critical with such methods,
however.


Just pitching large amounts of yeast that still has a large oxygen
demand (ie. low ~0.1% sterol content), without aerating the wort is
definitely not the way to go, IMHO, especially in reasonably clear
worts. Yeast at the end of primary fermentation typically has low sterol
levels, and has a high oxygen demand. ie. it requires oxygen (or
fat/sterol supplementation) before it can have sufficient sterol levels
to start reproducing (which is desirable if you want a healthy
fermentation).


It was not clear to me that Tracy was recommending the former over the
latter in BT, and clearly some others were confused too. A pity he no
longer contributes to HBD as it would be good for him to clarify this
point.


I have read the papers Jim refers to. These fermentations were with wort
supplemented with very large amounts of unsaturated fatty acids and
ergosterol, in place of oxygenation. Each subsequent fermentation was
also supplemented. This is along the lines of feremnting with large
amounts of trub (which supplies these naturally). Note I stressed my
worts are roughly filtered and contain low trub levels, which is
desirable for other reasons. Although the authors of the papers indeed
maintain yeast viability over 5 such fermentations, at no stage do they
taste any of the "beer" so produced. Yeast produced over successive
generations (with TWEEN 80/ergosterol supplementation) without oxygen,
maintain viability, but lack mitochondrial development. Yeast
mitochondria may have certain other desirable functions in fermentation
of beer.


I have also experimented with TWEEN80/ergosterol supplemented starters
that Jim mentions. These were interesting, although I've stopped now.
The ales were OK (one was outstanding), but the lagers were terrible! A
typical fermentation lasted about a day or 2, and was very attenuated. I
prefer less radical techniques these days.


*******
re George de Piro and high temps causing less esters???!!!


I think George just likes to stir the HBD brewpot!


Kunze makes the comment but doesn't back it up with any comment or
reference. (yes I have Kunze). I'd be tempted to regard this as a
throwaway line that can be disregarded (even a translation error). I
can't comment on the Siebel folk - surely you asked them why, George,
when they make such controversial claims? Without an explanation the
comment should also be disregarded. There is a wealth of information in
the (non homebrewing) literature that supports the opposite view. Most
things that increase higher alcohols (oxygen excepted) increase the
substrate for ester formation, and correspond highly with increased
ester levels. Our resident HBD ester expert, Mort O'Sullivan should be
able to throw more light on this, if he can drag himself away from his
studies.

Subject: too long in carboy = no conditioning yeast??


I recently bottled a high-gravity amber ale that (due to scheduling
conflicts) sat in the primary for nearly 2 weeks, and then in the secondary
for another two weeks.  This is the first time in my brewing career that
I've let a beer sit around that long, and I was worried that there might
not be enough yeast left to properly carbonate my brew. Well...


Tonight I did my usual one-week taste test and cracked open a bottle.  Not
flat, but practically.  There's a hint of carbonation, but not enough.
(Very little sediment, too.)


Will it eventually carbonate, but just take more time?  Will I have to open
all the bottles and add dry yeast?  How much should I add if I do this?  Am
I worrying needlessly?


Can this beer be saved?


Sorry if this question has been answered here recently.  This is my first
time reading (and posting to) HBD in a couple of years.  (I stopped reading
it when AOB screwed things up.)


Thanks in advance for your advice.

Subject: Hop Side shoots


Hi all,


This is the second year for my cascade hop plant and it is already growing
much more vigorously than last year. I pruned it back to 3 shoots on each
side of my rope support. Near the bottom of the plant the side branches are
already about 2-3 feet long and starting to sag to the ground! I am curious
what other people do with the side branches? Do you try and train them up
the rope? or just let them hang out? I would like to hear some ideas. 


Thanks

    Agreed, if only on the part about that there is more to completion than
throwing more yeast `at` it. I have also learned through trial & error that ale
yeasts preferences for sugar types are quite different from the preferences
of champagne yeasts. I would concur that the difference in a barleywine
fermented with ale yeast only, and those hit with another yeast, including
champagne yeast, may be minimal. But is there is a difference? Yup.......if
only in what I tasted between the 2.....wort after ale ferm, and then after
EC-1118 finish.....
    Even a brewer from the wrong side of the stump, that hits on a good
combination will report that combination.

    Which leads me to.....distiller's yeast........having never considered
the matter much....just assumed that the makers of Scotch used an ale yeast,
no hops, then distilled and aged the stuff in some manner of wonderful
wood....I have recently been introduced to the 'term'.....distiller's
yeast.....
    Anybody know anything about it.......is it significantly different?
Different `at` all? Characteristics?

Subject: Water Problems




HBDers:
About 3 years ago I moved into a new condo complex.  Ever since then I 
have
encountered some things which have perplexed me.  Recently I posted a 
quick
note about a very husky/astringent flavor in my all grain brews.  
Somebody
sent me a note which mentioned that it might be my brewing water.  This
 had
been bouncing around in my head for quite a while, and now that someone


else mentions it, I would like someone to possibly provide more 
guidance.


The first thing that I should mention is that our condo complex is fed 
from
a well.  It is a well known fact that our water content varies with the


season and the amount of rainfall.


Weird things which have occurred:
1.   Incredible amounts of hop bitterness.  For ESB recipes I use half 
of
the hops found in recipes.
2.   All of my all-grain batches have resulted in a beer which tastes 
like
a nasty husky terrible taste.  All of them have been thrown out.  I 
have
tried using 1/3 of the suggested sparge water and it has not helped.  I


have payed strict attention to mashing and sparging temps.  Mash ~153F
Sparge water 165-168F.  Still no good.
3.   About one of every ten batches of extract with steeped grains 
yields
the same nasty husky terrible taste.  These grains were steeped at 
150-155F
for 15 minutes.  The grains were then removed and the liquid was 
strained
through a funnel/plastic strainer to remove all of the husks and other
debris.  Every batch done in the same manner.  This nasty flavor can be


achieved by steeping as little as 8 oz of crystal malt.


I am confident that it is not a matter of sanitation.  It is a grainy
flavor and not a spoiled flavor.  The flavor has shown up with dry 
yeast,
and liquid yeast of various strains - so it is not a yeast problem.


About a year ago, I took a sample of my water to have it tested.  The 
tests
performed were pretty poor, but these were the results:
Hardness:  53.4 ppm
pH:  6.8
Manganese:  0.2 ppm
Fe:  Trace amounts


To me, this water analysis did not raise any flags.  So, I took to 
annoying
our condo administration which is required to perform various water 
tests
throughout the year.  Below is some of the results they have:
Lead 0.015 ppm
Copper   1.3 ppm
Sulfate  14 ppm
Chloride 68 ppm
Sodium 5 ppm


Again, I didn?t see anything that really concerned me.  One more 
additional
fact:  Our dishwasher and toilets are quite often stained brown.  This 
is
easily removed with citric acid.


The person who sent me a message a week or two ago said that I have a
temporary hardness problem.  As he suggested, I boiled a pot of water. 
 On
the bottom were a bunch of white deposits which looked like fish 
scales.  I
was not sure if this was salt plating out or bicarbonates.  This person


suggested boiling my water and racking off to another container.  He 
also
suggested mixing my water with R/O water.  I would really rather not 
buy
water if I could avoid it.


So, I am now putting this out to the collective.  WHAT IS GOING 
ON?!?!?!?!


I apologize for the ridiculous length and vagueness of this post, but I
 am
pretty much tired of throwing out entire batches of beer.  I want to 
move
on to all grain batches, but since quite a few batches are being thrown


out, I cannot even attempt such a move.


Before you respond to my post, please keep in mind that I know
little/nothing about chemistry and really do not want to have to learn 
it
now.  I really just want to know what to do to make the problem go 
away.
Is boiling and racking my water enough?  Do I have to mix with R/O 
water?
Do I need to add gypsum to the mash?  Do I need to acidify?  HELP!!!!!


As usual, private emails are fine and in this case encouraged.

Subject: Help with unmalted wheat


I have a simple mashing question about unmalted wheat.


I did an all grain wheat beer this weekend. I used 10 lbs of pilsen malt,  10
lbs of Belgin wheat and 1 lbs of Cara Pils.  This is for a ten gallon batch.
I mashed at 153 F for three hours.  I keep doing the Iodine test and the
samples keep testing positive for a lot of starch.


  Is this normal when mashing unmalted wheat?
  Should I cook the wheat before I mashed it?
  Will I have to drink this batch fast to avoid probems with starchy beer? 


The sparge was also very slow.  I think that was because the Pilsen malt was
two row and not six row.  That gave me less hask matrial in the grain bed.  My
extraction efficiency was 75% which is good for my system.


Well just want to know some other people's experances with mashing unmalted
wheat.

Subject: Gravity adjustment at bottling/hop isomerization


Greetings,


A coworker who brews and who is not on the list has made a beer that
fermented out more than expected.  It started around 1.070 and now is down
to 1.01x and still going.  He says that it is too alcoholic for the season
and is thinking of cutting it at bottling.  It's a 5 gallon batch and he's
thinking of adding a gallon of boiled and cooled water.  I gave him the
recent BT article on brewing high gravity beers and suggested that his
biggest problem is going to be adjusting for the right hop bitterness
level.  I was wondering if he were to boil some additional hops in his
added water, if sufficient isomerization would be realized in a water-only
boil to make the addition useful.  Alternatively, he could add a small
amount of hop extract, but even there I'm not sure if the extract is
highly soluble in water.  Any ideas?


Thanks in advance.

Nor would I expect you to. As I stated, I cannot explain why some have 
absolutely no problems, while others seem to go right to sh*t. I found no 
weird scents - not that that indicates whether an off-flavor could have 
resulted had there been beer in there, nor anything else other than the 
ruined seal. I'm at a loss...

Subject: Wet, Soft and Warm, thats how I like em


Hmmmmm, got your attention did I? Read on to find out more about wet, soft 
and warm.  Last Sunday morning Gary Sandler and I headed on up to C&C 
Distributing off of Missouri Flat Road to collect 38 korny kegs for the 
club. Matt from C&C first showed us around his warehouse (about 7 or 8 
trailers with no wheels) and then how to evaluate the kegs for structural 
integrity (bottom not falling off and handles secured) and pressure. Per the 
club's preference we stayed with the standard Pepsi ball-lock style.


We picked through the stacks setting aside those that had no pressure in 
them. Matt stores them pressurized after he cleans and repairs them so when 
its time to pick through them, we can tell if they'll hold pressure 
instantly by just squeaking the pressure relief valve. After a few minutes 
Gary suggested that he was also depressing the poppets inside each of the 
valve stanchions to make sure those were also operational. Sounded like a 
good idea, so I tried it too. Ended up with a face full of water that 
smelled a bit like rootbeer. Gary thought it was pretty funny and suggested 
that I might turn my head a bit to the side on the next one. I did that for 
about 10 more kegs, then forgot and blasted myself again. Just gotta stay on 
your toes when doing this important work.


It took us about an hour to go through the stacks and pull out 38 pretty 
good looking kegs. We eliminated the really ugly and badly dented ones, even 
though they were structurally okay. After stacking them outside in the 
sunlight (can you believe it didn't rain during this work) we re-inspected 
them as we loaded them into Gary's van. We pulled a few more out when we saw 
how rough they looked in the better light. All in all I'd say we ended up 
with the 38 best looking kegs that Matt had on hand.


Matt's a really nice fellow by the way. He's got a small refrigerated 
trailer with license plate "ALETRLR" that holds 12 half barrel kegs and 4 
taps. He'd brought it along hooked up to his Jeep for us to take a look at 
just in case the club might need something like it. Might be interesting to 
consider for the October Homebrewer's Festival in Napa. He's also got Sanke 
kegs for about $65 and some that are ready to make kettles out of for $40 
(with top cut out) which seems like a pretty reasonable price. I'll be 
getting a couple myself soon.


After all that inspection, you'd think we got perfect kegs. Well I brought 4 
of 'em home and unloaded them. A couple hours later I was getting ready to 
soak them in TSP and I noticed one keg had no pressure in it. I figured we 
must have let it all out but just to be sure I repressurized it. Within 
minutes it had no pressure. Whatta bummer! I tried resealing the lid and 
tested it again. Didn't work. I couldn't believe it. Disappointed, I left 
the keg in the basement overnight and told Gary about it. It looked like 
there was a very small dent in the lip of the keg right where the oring was 
supposed to seat.


After thinking about it for a bit, I decided that maybe the thing had just 
dried out a bit. I also remembered that rubber gets softer when its warm. So 
last night I gave the lid with oring a 5 minute soak in very hot tap water. 
Reinserted the now wet, warm and soft oring and lid and repressurized the 
tank. This morning it still had pressure! So, from now on my kegging 
procedure will always include a hot water soak for the oring and lid just 
before pressurizing. Disappointed? Not me. I like my keg lids wet, warm and 
soft.

I thought the repulsive idea was adding the OJ???


Adding water is an easy way to dilute your beer.  If you have 7 gallons at
1.075, you can easily calculate the new OG.
7 (gallons) * 75 (from the gravity) gives you 525 "points".  Adding one 
gallon of water (which has zero "points") gives you 8 gallons.


divide the 525 points by 8 gallons gives you 1.066.  Adding 2 gallons of 
water would give you 1.058.  


That, of course, doesn't include the contribution from the OJ concentrate.
