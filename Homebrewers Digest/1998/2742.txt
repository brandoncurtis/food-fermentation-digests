It can't be.  People get in trouble by thinking of the beer that won as
the "best" beer, as if this were some concrete characteristic that could
be detected and recognized.  No, the winning beer for a given judging is
just that: the winning beer, not the "best" beer.  The top beers in a
contest are generally like closely-matched teams in a playoff: the winner
of one game isn't necessarily the "best."


I'm basically agreeing with what Dave said -- and suggesting we try to
alter our language to more clearly match the truth of the situation.


Best,

Ed Basgall makes some suggestions to Eric in HBD#2739:


Hi Eric,
In HBD 2737 you asked about converting a keg to a brewpot.........
<snip>
You'll need to get a tool called a Sawzall 
<snip>
Once you have the hole cut out get a short fat (1"x1") grinding wheel
<snip>
If you have access to a person or shop that does SS welding you  can have a
hole drilled in the side, near the bottom and have them weld in a SS 1/4"
nipple.  (I used SS SWAGELOK parts)
You can order a 1/4" SS ball valve from a number of mailorder places (I
used McMaster Carr)
<snip>


Just three comments:


1. Sawzall is a tough one. You will need to find a stainless welder anyway. 
When you do, ask them if they have a Plasma Cutter. The guy that sold me my 
kegs does a lot of stainless scrapping and has one of these cutters. It took 
him 3 minutes to cut the tops out of the kegs and left nothing but some 
stainless dust behind. And he did it for a six pack of homebrew.


2. The one inch grinder is called a die grinder.


3. A quarter inch ball valve is probably less expensive than half inch, but 
will take forever to drain. I put half inch in mine, got all the parts at 
McMaster Carr also (www.mcmaster.com).

Subject: Fermentation chiller idea


     Hi all,
     
     I have an idea for a fermentation chiller, but am unsure how well it 
     will work.  I welcome input from all of you that know a thing or two 
     about heat transfer.
     
     I built a cold box that I keep at ~37F (2.8C).  My idea is to keep a 
     reservoir of cold water in the box, with a copper coil running through 
     it.  This coil will be hooked up to another coil outside of the cold 
     box.  This second coil will be immersed in water in an insulated 
     container of some sort (this will be called the "fermentation 
     reservoir").  The fermenters will sit in the water with the second 
     coil.  A pump will circulate the liquid between the two coils.
     
     My hope is to keep the "fermentation reservoir" at about 62F (16C).  
     This is about 15-20F lower than the highest expected ambient 
     temperature.  I guess i could use a thermostat to control the pumping 
     of the liquid to maintain the temperature.
     
     Before I go ahead and build this thing, I figured that I would tap 
     into the collective's knowledge.  My guess is that this will be fairly 
     inefficient, but will it be able to maintain the desired temperature 
     gradient?  How large of a cold reservoir do I need?  How big of a 
     "fermentation reservoir" can I get away with?  Are there any formulas, 
     or do I just have to be courageous and do it?
     
     What refrigerant would be best to use?  Water is safe and easy to 
     clean up, but it does tend to get gross with time.  Should I use a 
     little antifreeze?  My dog will not have access to the area!
     
     Thanks for any info, have fun!

Subject: re: Rye Pale Ale


In HBD 2738 Charley Burns brought up some questions about a Rye beer he has
brewed. I brew a Rye that is generally very well received so I thought I'd
throw in my $.02 worth.


I usually go for a little less bitterness (low to mid 30's IBU) but for the
warmer months 40 is reasonable for a more refreshing brew. I have been
using only malted Rye, no flaked, at about 15% of the grist. It's more than
a lot of people use but it produces a beer in which the rye is right up
front in the flavor profile.


I typically mash at a slightly lower temp (151 - 154F), especially at this
time or year. This results in a more fermentable wort and the beer
typically finishes about 1.010 (OG 1.055 - 1.060). I get a nice, crisp
finish which makes it a great summer beer. (I know a lot of you probably
think it is too late to be brewing summer beers but out here in the great
Pacific Northwest, we are just beginning to think spring has arrived!) At
other times of the year, I will sometimes shoot for a slightly higher FG
which gives me a beer that goes well with cooler weather.


Your cold break definately comes from the rye. I get 2 - 3x the break (hot
and cold) when I brew rye vs. a similar beer without rye. As I understand
it, rye is similar to wheat in the amount of protein it contributes to the
wort. Because of the increased protein contribution, this beer can have a
slight chill haze problem. I have tried a protein rest (20 min at 135F) to
deal with it but I was not happy with the results - the head and head
retention on this beer are usually outstanding but when I used the protein
rest they were not as good as I thought they should be. I have gone back to
no protein rest and fine and filter if I want a really clear beer.


Since I often do not know when I'll be able to brew more than a day or two
in advance, I frequently don't have time to make a starter. I usually use
Nottingham dry yeast in this beer and ferment at about 65F. This is a very
clean, neutral fermenter which works well in this beer.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Big ol' food warmer conversion


Hey all,


I recently came into possesion of a large "food warmer" that was previously 
used by a catering company.  It is essentially a huge square gott cooler 
(about 20 gall liquid capacity) without a drain plug.  I'm taking suggestions 
for the best way to use this monster.  A mashtun makes the most sense to me 
but I'd have to install a drain plug and I don't know how difficult that would 
be, if even possible.  Any light that could be shed on this would be 
appreciated.  Any other suggestions for clever ways to use this bad boy would 
also be appreciated.


Thanks, private emails are fine.

This is a good question, and although I knew the reason on Saturday when
I read it, I had to wait til Monday morning when I could call my chemist
friend who had initially worked with me on the procedure.
The short answer is solubility limits and chemical activity loss of the
solution (which is redundant). Here is how the solution works:
1. The Hydrogen Peroxide forms Lead Oxide which is soluble in the weakly
acidic solution.
2. Copper Oxide is also soluble in weak acid solutions, while Copper is
not, thus the brass brightens as it cleans.
3. The solution does not have a lot of H2O2 in it, and H2O2 is unstable.
As PbO2 is formed the H2O2 turns to water.
4. Meanwhile, the Cupric Acetate starts forming, which has the blue
green color. The formula for this is Cu(C2H3O2)2*CuO*6H2O, it's a
complex.  I'm sorry, I don't know the conditions for its formation.
5. However, with the formation of Cupric Acetate, the solution is no
longer weakly acidic, so that the PbO2 is no longer dissolved and any
leftover OH causes the formation of CuO and Pb2O which are black and not
soluble in water.


To the best of my knowledge, this is how the de-leading solution works.
Solution chemistry is not my strong suit. Perhaps Dave Burley with his
P-Chem background could fill in any gaps.

John,
I used the paste. I'm concerned about the effects of gasoline or acetone
on the plastic (?) seals in the ball valves. They are soldered in place.
Do you think a diluted acetone solution would work ok. Say half acetone
and half h2O and a 5 minute soak followed by a quick rinse. Also, I'm
curious what the significance is of using high octane gasoline. How
about TSP? Acetone scares me a little (though I use it occasionly for
thining epoxy) and gasoline, well, wouldn't have been my first choice
though I used to use gasoline as a solvent religiously back in my dirt
bike days. ;)
Thanks,
Dave L.

Subject: Blueberries vs. Raspberries


Tom asks about blueberries versus raspberries in beer.


I've used both and quite a few more.  Blueberries have a very faint
aroma and thus you need to use a lot of them to get a recognisable
character.  At that, blueberry aroma is sort of non-descript so you
may have some trouble identifying the aroma.  I have used as much as
2 pounds per gallon (about 250g per liter) and still the aroma was
just faintly "berry."  Note that this was in a very neutral, pale,
low-bitterness beer.   A blueberry Porter would probably require
5 pounds per gallon!


Raspberries are very powerful.  Here, 1 pound per gallon (about 125g
per liter) in a pale, neutral beer will give a solid aroma and colour.


As for the blend of "woods berries" I have not tried it, but again,
strawberries have a very mild aroma and you would need about 2 pounds
per gallon (about 250g per liter) to get a noticeable aroma.  Blackberries
are weaker than raspberries, but stronger than blueberries.

Thanks for the pointer.  I'll look it up tonight.  I do believe you
are mistaken regarding the relationship between sugar and head retention
in Belgian ales.  The sugars typically used by Belgian brewers are
"candi sucre" which is really virtually 100% sucrose.  Since sucrose
is 100% fermentable, there would be nothing left to contribute to head
retention and, in fact, sucrose (as well as other simple sugars) are
foam negative and *reduce* body and mouthfeel.  Finally, an "adjunct"
is defined as a non-enzymatic starch source (like flaked wheat, pearled
barley, potatoes or steel-cut oats).  The long-lasting heads on Belgian
ales (not to be confused with "Belgian Ales" like DeKonnick) are partly
due to the fact that they typically are pretty high in OG (so they have
more of everything) and partly due to the fact that they are carbonated
much higher than most other countries' beer styles.


BTW, the person who said Jazz in 6 was half right!

I made a porter this past November.  It has been stored in the basement.  I 
liked it best when it was about a month old.  When it was young it had a 
harshness.  This harshness had mellowed by one month.  It gradually changed, not
better or worse just different.  So, give it a try, it will be interesting.  If 
it has problems (HSA, infection, starch, etc.) it will probably deteriorate, 
otherwise it should continue to be enjoyable.

Subject: Large Double-boiler Mash Vessels


Hi all,


While leafing through The Walter T. Kelley Co, Inc's recent beekeeping
supply catalog (pg 41), I found some great looking 16, 40 and 80 gallon
welded stainless steel *double* boilers for use in honey packaging.
These look to be some of the most interesting off-the-shelf mash-tun
candidate vessels I've run into in a while.  They're made to hold honey
(or mash!) at sub-boiling temps, and can be heated electrically, by
steam or over any hot plate.  A belt+pulley driven 3-blade SS mixing
paddle ala the "Mix-Masher" is also available for the 40 or 80-gal unit
and attaches through the lid.


The boiler part is a conical reservoir covering the bottom and
extending, pointy side up, to about 1/3 of the height.  The boiler has a
1/2" water drain and an external 1" flange for an immersion heater
element.  The tanks come with a 2" drain flange for the main vessel
(glorp valve! [1]).  It might be tricky to put false bottoms in them but
doable, an Easy-Masher(R) style filter, or slotted ring might be better
or else one could simply drain to a separate lauter tun.


Prices:
Cat. No. 202-S KELLEY'S 40-Gal DOUBLE BOILER - 22 ga. Stainless steel,
21" diam. by 29" high, with thermometer.  $215.50.
Cat. No. 202-M Mixing paddle attachment.  $130.00.
Cat. No. 202-C Flat Stainless steel cover.  $18.50.


Cat. No. 203-S KELLEY'S 80-Gal DOUBLE BOILER - 22 ga. Stainless steel,
29" diam. by 35" high, with thermometer.  $255.50.
Cat. No. 203-M Mixing paddle attachment.  $140.00.
Cat. No. 203-C Flat Stainless steel cover.  $23.50.


These are also available as fully jacketed tanks (40-gal $315, 80-gal
$355). 


The 15-gallon tanks don't offer paddles but come with a cover, an
electric 115 volt immersion heater, water reservoir and an adjustable
thermostat (50F to 250F) and comes with a 1" flange or optional 2"
flange ($6).  Price $177.00.


I'd love to hear from anyone who is used one of these for mashing.

Sorry, I don't know.  I use 0.1 grams/liter of Fermax... oh, alright,

Theoretically, although I never use hops in my starters and have had no
problems.  The fact is that only a very small percentage of all the
microbiota out there are actually sensitive to hops and, frankly, those
that are sensitive to hops won't survive in your *beer*.

I beg to differ with that assertion.  A glucose solution with yeast
nutrient will result in a large (larger, I've read) yeast mass, but
the resulting yeast may have trouble fermenting other sugars.  Each
class of sugars (I'm not sure if glucose or fructose do, however)
requires its respective enzymes to be utilised by the yeast.  If you
only feed the yeast glucose, they will "forget" how to make the other
enzymes and you will have slow fermentation at least and can have
a stuck fermentation.

they don't get shocked when they hit the cooled wort.

The best way will vary from SO to SO.  Presumably you know what your SO
really appreciates and this is where you should start.  One thing that
works well is to *PASS UP* a beer event to do something with your SO.
This pays double dividends.

Definately a bit high, but La Chouffe has an OG of 1.076, so it should be

I've found that many Belgian ale yeasts also need a cold conditioning for
the yeast to flocculate (such as Wyeast 1388 - Duvel).  MJ's The Great Beers
of Belgium (pg 277) says that La Chouffe beers "have a period of cold
maturation in the tank before being filled into Champagne bottles."
Patience is a required virtue of Belgian style brewers.

Use a drilled stopper and some tubing.  Jam the stopper into the spigot
(on the inside of the bucket).  Cut the tubing so that is just long enough
to reach the opposite side of the bucket.


When you bottle, make sure the bucket is above the bottles.  For the most
part, the beer in the bucket will drain into the bottles, but and this is
the neat part, when the level of the beer drops below the level of the
spigot, you will be siphoning the last few bottles of beer.


Works for me, and there is rarely ever more that 1/2 cup or less of beer
left in the bucket.

It can be a bit confusing. People will say that Guiness is the style
example for Dry Stout. Do they mean the brewery or the beer? Actually
Guiness makes more than just a stout so it would be incorrect to say
"Guiness=Dry Stout." I think this is where the confusion lies. Nothing is
taken for granted on the exam. If you want to use a commercial example of a
common beer style you should usually recite 'beer, brewery' unless the beer
is named after the brewery in which case you should *still* identify it
more succinctly e.g. "Bass Ale" or "Bass Pale Ale" not simply "Bass".

You should only refer to a beer which specifically typifies a style. For
region specific apellations like Lambic, Alt, Rauchbier, Trappist etc. you
should only use as examples, beers which come from that region and thus
conform to style. FWIW Shiner Bock is not an example of a bock (take it
from my experience %0 )


Good luck on the exam. It is no walk in the park but it is a hell of a

I used them on my HBD Pale Ale Experiment. I added 4 tablets to each

to a 12 oz. bottle and found that my beer should have come in at 2.4
volumes. Since the beer is going to be lab tested for co2, I'll be able
to report back how well it worked.


As far as actually using them, the instructions say "1. Wash hands
thoroughly. Dry with fresh paper towel. Touch only bottles and tablets."
Uhm, yhea, right. I used a 6"x6" piece of heavy weight paper folder into
a 'V' as a chute. I dumped some tabs on a plate, raked four on the chute
with a knife and dump 'em in the bottle. One of those pharmacy trays
might be really handy.


I racked the beer from the carboy to a bucket. Then I filled the bottles
and capped. If I had a second set of hands to handle the racking cane, I
could have eliminated the bottling bucket step and direct filled the
bottles. These tabs'll be handy for the kegger that wants 12 in bottles
and keg the rest.


The hb shop owner said that the tabs would make the beer foam up and to
cap immediately. No foaming problems. I filled about 45 bottles and
capped them as normal.

        In Tuesday's HBD, Larry Smith stated that he used a late mash
addition of dark grains to his stout and it seems to have resulted in a
smoother, less bitter beer.
        I too have tried this with my Oatmeal Stout.  Back when I was
doing partial mashes I did late additions of the dark malts and the
result was great.  I now make the same recipe all grain but I haven't
used the late additions.  I mash the total grain bill together.
        It seems that the bitterness associated with the dark grains
acts similar to the bitterness of hops.  In other words, a short mash
will give you the flavor and colour but not the bitterness.  Of course
you will miss some of the starch conversion of the dark grains but you
can simply add a bit more pale malt to compensate.  
        Any opinions on this?

Subject: RE:  Old yeast and long lag times


     Hi all,
     
     The recent rants of certain people have made this disclaimer 
     necessary:  the following post involves talking about off flavors and 
     aromas which some readers may find controversial.  If you believe that 
     nothing you do can hurt your beer, *page down now*:
     
     David describes his experiences growing up some really old yeast.  The 
     lag time was quite lengthy in his starter.  He wonders about the cause 
     of this, and tells us that he has read about surviving spores.
     
     I don't know much about the conditions that will cause Saccharomyces 
     to sporulate (is there a microbiologist in the house?), but the 
     explanation is similar, with or without spores.
     
     Almost all of the yeast in the sample was dead.  You pitched it into 
     some wort, and it eventually grew.  Why did it take so long?  Because 
     you were severely underpitching.  Only a few cells were viable.  These 
     had to reproduce for a while before they reached a population large 
     enough to cause noticeable activity.  The few surviving cells were 
     probably in really poor shape, too.  Maybe even mutated from their 
     original form.
     
     A long lag in your starter is not inconsequential.  In fact, that is 
     probably the most important stage of yeast culturing with regards to 
     keeping things clean and "by the book."  Unless you were working in a 
     nearly sterile (yes, sterile) environment, other bugs are in there 
     competing with a very small and weak yeast population.  Even a small 
     wild yeast or bacterial presence at that stage will get multiplied by 
     the time you are ready to pitch your production wort.  Pitching it can 
     be disastrous.
     
     If you have an old sample of a precious yeast that you want to save, 
     plating it out or growing it in a very small amount (5 mL) of 
     autoclaved wort is the best way to go.
     
     If you want to try using the yeast that you have, taste the starter 
     first!  If it tastes fine, then you may want to be courageous and give 
     it a shot.  Just be aware of the potential problems.  If the starter 
     is in the least bit off (phenolic, high diacetyl, vegetable-like, 
     etc.), I would not be so bold as to use it (actually, I have been so 
     bold in the past, and have learned that such wrecklessness yields 
     flushable results).  Slight off characters in the starter are usually 
     multiplied significantly in the production wort.
     
     Have fun!

I have some questions for you all,
        I'm brewing my first belgian dubbel. I have read the classic book on
belgian beers and have decided to base my recipe off one in the book. The
recipe calls for:


9.5 lbs pale
4 oz crystal malt
4 oz brown malt
0.75 lb candi sugar


The recipe says the color should be 14oL. My understanding from reading the
book is that dark candi sugar is used in brewing dubbels.


Here are my questions: He doesnt state what color crystal in this recipe,
or whether the candi sugar is dark or light. It seems to me that if one
used dark crystal, brown malt and dark candi sugar, that this would be
darker than 14oL. Given your expertise, what kind of crystal and candi
sugar does this recipe refer to?

David Lamotte asked about brewing yeast spores. Brewers yeast is an
ascospore but I have always been given the impression that it is rather
difficult to get it to sporulate - i.e. that this never happens in the
brewery but rather only in the laboratory where special media are used
to induce it. It is pretty well known in HBD land that yeast stored
under water or beer for  a year or longer are still viable though the
number of viable cells is a tiny fraction of the number originally
stored. Thus I'm guessing that the starter in question grew from live
cells which, as they were very few in number and starved, took a long
time to grow to a density where the action was visible. I have never
seen an ascus or a spore but then I've never really gone looking for
them.

<<<<<


I'm just now starting to drink an IPA I primed using a sample of
PrimeTabs given to me by my local brewshop proprietor. I was pleased.
The tabs did their job: the beer is carbonated.


For me, the nicest thing about the Prime Tabs is that I didn't have to
mess around with preparing a priming solution and racking my beer to
another container so the priming solution could be mixed in. As much
as I love brewing, I absolutely hate bottling (and my apartment
doesn't afford me room for kegging). Granted, preparing the bottles is
the bigger hassle than preparing/mixing priming solution, but anything
to shorten the process is fine by me.


Using the tabs was very easy: After the bottles were sanitized and
emptied, I dropped the appropriate number into each bottle (3 for 12
oz., 6 for 22 oz.) Then I siphoned the beer into the bottles.


A few "warnings" about Prime Tabs' use (most of these are echoed on
the information sheet that comes with them). Make sure your beer is
flat. The tabs provide nucleation sites, and you'll get some foaming.
My beer was fairly flat, but I still foamed a bit. Nothing major, and
nothing that caused me to lose volume in the bottle. I was just left
with a foam ring in the neck for a few days that disappeared as the
beer conditioned. Because of the foaming potential, don't drop the
tabs into a full bottle of beer.


The result was exactly the level of carbonation I expected for the
amount I used (according to the info sheet, 2 tabs per 12 oz. will get
you a "cask-conditioned" level of carbonation, 3 oz. a low-to-middle,
and 4 or 5 tabs a fizzy beer), with a nice, quick head formation that
sticks around a while. I'm not going to use them for every batch (I
need to do something with that 3 pound bag of corn sugar I just
bought), but I will almost certainly use them again.

Subject: Dehumidifier as fermentation cooler


I recently "liberated" a dehumidifier.  It has all the working parts that a
fridge does but the principle of operation is different.  In a fridge, they
cool a confined space with little (preferably no)air circulation except
within the space.  In contrast, a dehumidifier wants to pull the maximum
volume of air past the evaporator coil.  As a result, I am having a problem
getting the heat from the space I want to cool over to the evaporator (Or
if you prefer, getting the "cool" from the evaporator coil to the wort.)


Note:


The evaporator is constructed of about 3/8" aluminum tube shaped like a
flat coil.  It is about 9" high by 9" wide but flattened to about 2".


End of note


One alternative is to bond a thermal mass to the coil to increase the
effective surface area.  I will use this method if I decide to build a
"fridge".


The other alternative I am considering (and need help with) is just cooling
the fermenter.  Perhaps covering it with a "blanket" and somehow getting
the "cool" inside the blanket.


Can anyone point me to methods of doing this?

Hi All,

The AHA scheduled a place/date for the First Round judging   
in the Northeast before getting the necessary volunteers.  
Our club was asked to do the organization back in August 
1997 and we gave the AHA an immediate and very clear NO 
(what part of that answer did they not understand?).


Apparently the ensuing 8 months weren't long enough for them 
to find another northeast club to organize the competition.


I find it disturbing that the AHA decided to bash the Worts  
for the AHA's own shortcomings (gotta point the finger at  
someone else I guess).  I sincerely hope that Brian Rezac will 
publicly address this point when he returns to his keyboard.
