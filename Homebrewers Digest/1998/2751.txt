Originally, the RIMS concept was thought to be unscalable to larger
sizes.  I believe that this was later disproven.  Search the archives
for "RIMS and Fix."   One concern that I have (although I'm not a RIMSer
so take my advice on this with a grain of salt) is that if you have a
very large heat exchanger "device" for the RIMS (like your various
tubing designs above) you will need to have a *very* thin mash.  Remember
that in addition to the liquid that you normally have in the grain bed,
you also have to have enough *additional* liquid to fill your heat
exchanger.  Too thin a mash means your enzymes are very dilute, which
in turn, means that conversion will go slower and your enzymes will be
more easily denatured (this is just a fact of thin mashes).




This is a risk that you may want to consider before you invest your
limited resources in all the hardware for RIMS.  Personally, I would
put my money into a mash mixer and a single, large mash/lauter tun.

I agree, we can talk about our preference for more flavorful beer without

Firstly, I don't think that Tripels are dry.  I think they are medium-
sweet.  Secondly, I don't agree that the yeast will necessarily be
"ruined" by the additional sugar.  Yes, if too much of the wort is
glucose, fructose and sucrose, the yeast can "forget" how to make
the proper enzymes for bringing maltose in, but I believe that many
Belgian brewers have proven that you can approach 20% refined sugars
if you have used enough malt for good yeast health.  Typical all-grain
wort is about 8.9% glucose and fructose and another 5.5% sucrose.


No, I belive that if the yeast has been given enough oxygen and a
sufficient amount of yeast has been pitched (very unlikely among
homebrewers), the FG would be the same whether you added the sugar
or not.  Furthermore, I think you have inadvertently solved my
"I can't make a dry IPA" problem...


Three words: "alcohol is sweet."  Yes, I've been trying to make a
dry IPA and I'm beginning to realise that the beer I've envisioned
may be an impossibility at the original gravity I'm trying to use.

Actually, I was a little sloppy on that post.  The fact is that
via the Crabtree Effect, respiration is *suppressed* rather
than eliminated.  Even if the sugar levels are high, if there
is oxygen present, a small amount of the oxygen will be used for
respiration.


Sorry about that.

As a lurker, I beg of you, please don't beat me, masters. I just wanted a cup
your wisdom. I know I am not worthy.I am lower than ant spit. People, lighten
up here....


Read the comment from Sam today about posting that you are brewing 100 gallon
batches at a time is not such a good idea, seeing that we are only allowed 100
gallons a year as brewers (200 gallons as a household). That made me think
about my brewing practices and how they might be interpreted by someone from
the ATF or other interested parties.


I am a very active brewer, involved with two excellent homebrew clubs in
Michigan. As I really enjoy bringing people together to brew, a lot of beer
gets brewed at my home. Just two weeks ago, members of the Ann Arbor Brewers
Guild and the Fermental Order of Renaissance Draughtsmen (F.O.R.D.) brewed a
collective 70 gallons for my "little brew '98". I imagine that last year I
brewed in excess of the 200 gallon limit by a substantial amount. However, I
rarely take more than 5 gallons for myself. You see, I enjoy the cammraderie
of fellow brewers, so if I am brewing a 20 gallon batch of my Nearly Nevada
Pale Ale, I will have three additional slaves, er, brewers helping me do
everything from grinding the grains, to flinging the spent grains throughout
my lawn. They in turn pay for 1/4 of the cost's of ingredients and take
home 1/4 of the end product.


So my question is this. Does the brewing of a 20 gallon batch at my home
constitute 10% of my annual limit for my household, or does the addition of
three fellow brewers dilute this to just the 5 gallons that I keep. I guess if
anyone knows where I can find the 1979 amendment that legalized homebrewing I
can then review it and make my own determination.

Actually, presuming a fixed number of bits per sample, bandwidth

Hmmm... I'd better say something beer-related too...

1.  Anyone who has used the Oxynator from Liquid Bread care to comment on
 the results of a couple 15 second bursts of pure Oxygen compared sloshing
 the bucket around.  I'm currently aerating by slowly pouring 3 gallons of
 pre-chilled water into my primary (plastic) fermentor from a height of
 about 5 feet.  


I have and it really does help give quicker starts, faster finishes
and lower FG's.  I used to pour the entire 5-gallon batch (after
immersion chilling) through a funnel into a 6-gallon carboy.  It
used to foam quite a bit.  I typically run oxygen for 1 minute into
the kettle after chilling but before draining via a ball valve into
the carboys below.  This is for a 15 gallon batch, but it seems to me
that the time would be the same for 5 gallons.
 
2.  I saw this question previously, but not an answer.  Is the oxygen in
 those propane style canisters available in Home Depot and the like the
 same as the one's sold with the Oxynator.  These canisters cost $7 at Home
 Depot as opposed to $16.45 from Liquid Bread.


Same oxygen.  The only difference between medical grade and industrial
grade oxygen is that you need to drag around a stack of paperwork on
the tank that *holds* the oxygen in the case of medical O2.  I've read
(here in HBD) even that some medical oxygen has anti-fungal agents
added, but have not seen it confirmed by anyone.  If that is indeed
true, medical grade would be worse.

Actually, I've never *ever* seen a newbie get bashed (and I've read
*every* HBD... when I subscribed in 1987, I believe there were 14 of us).


On the contrary, the most abrasive posts in recent memory are posters
who slam the anal-retentive technoweenies (I can write this because I'm
one of them, sometimes...) for making homebrewing more difficult than
it should be.  Remember NOKOMAREE?


Also, the fur occasionally starts to fly when one "expert"
locks horns with another "expert."  I can see this as being just as
intimidating to newbies as a slam for asking a beginner question.
There have been many times when I've wanted to call some self-proclaimed
expert a name or begin my post with "Bull***t!"  Actually, I may
have once or twice started with "Baloney!"  So, I'm guilty too, the
damage is done and some beginners may indeed be scared away from posting.


Ironically, the post from Paul that started this whole thread
contained quite a bit of bile and probably scared a few beginners
itself...


We should all try to get enough sleep and not deprive ourselves
too long of tasty homebrew and make a strong effort to avoid any
mean-spirited posts altogether.  What's great about the HBD is
that it is so resilient... I'll bet that a week or two without
any angry posts and all is forgotten.

Subject: Maltose in Belgians


I've been following with interest the thread on candi sugar.  I brewed my 
first Belgian strong ale last Christmas.  Instead of using candi sugar 
(expensive) or table sugar (some homebrewing habits die hard) I used 1.25 
kg of maltose - a clear liquid sold by the local brewshop that looks an 
awful lot like liquid invert sugar.  It does taste less sweet, and the 
shop owner assures me that it is indeed 100% maltose.  


Now, if I understand correctly, maltose is more easily fermented than 
glucose, at least for beer yeasts.  My fermentation certainly went crazy. 
 The beer (meant to be in the "Golden Strong Ale" subcategory) had a 
great head, full body, and very nice citrusy flavour (from the yeast - Wy 
3944). It scored well and got positive comments at a local competition. 
Its only problem: it was a bit too sweet - probably from low hopping.


Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone else has used this stuff to make strong, 
pale beers?

Good afternoon all Homebrew digest readers.  Here is something new...


This coming Saturday (6/27/98) I will be doing a "BrewCast"....that is, I 
will be webcasting (video only) myself (and hopefully some members of my 
homebrew club) brewing a batch of Pale Ale in my backyard.  This is made 
possible by the really cool cable modem I just got, a couple of high-end 
Macs, a Hi-8 video camera, and a bunch of software.


Anyway, I'd like anyone who has time and interest to tune in and watch.  
I'll be answering email during the brew so you can tell me what you 
think.  I'm also holding a constest to name the brew (it's a new recipe) 
during the brew session.  The winner gets a beer (whoo hoo).


Anyway, check out http://24.130.11.18/brewcam (I registered brewcam.com 
but I don't think it'll be ready by Saturday...but maybe).


Let me know what you think.

Lou 


 I only brew 6 gal. batches so the transfer goes very fast and is not
difficult. I use a 2 qt pot to gently scoop the mash from the 10 gal pot
which I use as both a mash tun and a boiling kettle. My lauter tun is a 13"
dia. stainless pool filter fitted with an "H" shaped easymasher type drain.
Due to the large diameter it is quite easy to lower the pot to the bottem
and gently tip the mash out. No more aeration IMHO than stirriing the mash
in the tun to get the filter bed to mix and set. While the bed sets, I rinse
the 10 gal pot which now collects the wort and becomes my boiling kettle. 


As you can see, I still have only 2 containers, a mash tun/kettle + a lauter
tun just like the mash/lauter tun + a kettle crew.


Haven't noticed any specific HSA related tastes in my beer.

meters, including probe temperature maximums.


Just trying to be informative.  I sent David private e-mail but then read
were the collective should be entitled to more information and I heartily
agree.

Subject: Pre-boil formula & Temp.control


Greetings,
I have two questions for anyone out there who can help me out.
1)  What's a good formula to use to figure out what your pre-boil SG
should be?
2)  Where can one find a temp.controller for fermenting in a
refridgerator and which
        one is recommended?


Many Thanks!
James

Subject: Amarillo hops


Does anyone have experience with Amarillo hops?  My local homebrew store
just got some in, and the manager says they are a relative of Cascade. 
They do have a great citrusy aroma, with some hints of spiciness to it. 
I used some as FWH for an American Pale Ale, and really liked the
flavor.  I just wondered if anyone knew what the lineage of these hops
was.  


Thanks,

Subject: If you had to formulate a recipe on a desert island, or BJCP exam...


Yikes!  I'm about to take the BJCP exam this Saturday, along with 8 of
my cohorts, and one of the topics we've discussed is recipe
formulation.  There is a question on the sample exam that basically
reads "Give a recipe for a 5-gallon ALL-GRAIN batch of (X) and explain
how the recipe fits the style".  I had come up with a couple of memory
aids to make the calculation of grain and hops a bit easier to remember,
and I thought it might be of some use to those out there in HBD-land who
haven't yet "got the hang" of all-grain recipe design.


The simple (approximate) formulas are:


     *Lb of Grain required = Last two gravity digits / 5.4
     *Ounces of hops required for bittering = IBU(bittering) / (4 x
alpha acid)


For late hopping you could go further:


     *Ounces of hops required for flavor = IBU(flavor) / (2 x alpha
acid)
     *Ounces of hops required for aroma  = IBU(aroma) / alpha acid
       (Add all additions to get total IBU)


These numbers apply only to 5 gallon batches and *typical* homebrew
parameters.  More on that in a second.


Examples:


To figure the grain needed for 5 gallons of a 1.054 wort, you would take
the last two gravity digits, "54", and divide by 5.4.  This gives 10
lb.  Similarly, a 1.040 wort requires 40/5.4 = 7.4 lb.


To get 30 IBU from boiling 5% Fuggles for 60 minutes, you need 30 / (4 x
5) = 30/20 = 1-1/2 oz.  To get an additional 6 IBU from a flavor
addition use another 6 / (2 x 5) = 0.6 ounces.


===


The grain thing comes from assuming an average of 27 gravity points per
pound ("PPG") of grain per gallon of wort.  This is a "typical" homebrew
result and represents about 75% efficiency.  Normally gravity would be
figured


     SG points = PPG x LB / GAL


so


     LB = SG * GAL / PPG


Plugging in "5" for the batch size and "27" for the PPG, we get


     LB = SG * 5/27


which is the same as 


     LB = SG / (27/5)
        = SG / 5.4


***If you get closer to 30 ppg (83%) use SG / 6.  Lower efficiency (25
ppg or 70%) use SG / 5.***


===


Hops are normally figured from


     IBU = 0.75 x ounces x alpha acid x utilization / gallons   (AA and
utilization in non-decimal figures)


Using a typical utilization of 25% for 60 minutes, and again using 5
gallons, this becomes


     IBU = 0.75 x ounces x alpha acid x 25 / 5
         = 3.75 x ounces x alpha acid


Round up the 3.75 to an easier-to-remember 4 (means you get 27%
utilization instead of 25%, which is still reasonable as a guess)


     IBU = 4 x ounces x alpha acid


Therefore


     ounces = IBU / (4 x AA)


Assuming 13% utlization at 25-30 minutes (flavor addition),


     IBU(30) = 2 x OZ x AA
     ounces =  IBU / (2 x AA)


And 6-7% at 5 - 10 minutes (aroma addition)


     IBU(15) = OZ x AA
     ounces = IBU / AA


***These utilization figures roughly track the Rager curves.***


(If you're a Tinseth devotee you'd want to add a tad bit more hops for
flavor & aroma than these equations figure.)


===


These calculations are definitely rough but their simplicity should help
you find an answer close to reality without as much head-scratching, if
you're under pressure (like in the BJCP exam) or just trying to decide
if you have enough grain left to make that bock.

Subject: Teflon tape?/mashing questions/oxygen/sparging doghouse




Hello All,


        Charley Burns asks about using teflon tape to seal his SS 
ball valves to the SS nipples in his converted kegs.  I've done this on
a hot liquor tank and mash tun (one SS valve, one brass) and they've
shown no problems at all in 20+ batches.  I hope you enjoy your system 
as much as I've enjoyed mine (after an initially strained relationship!)


        Ed Krach asks about using welding oxygen tanks with an Oxynator.
I've done this several times with no infections or off tastes that I can
notice.  I think others have reported the same.  I believe that HopTech
offers just a regulator and SS stone setup, encouraging customers to buy
their own welding oxygen tank.  You should be in good shape.


        Ed Choromanski asks several questions about mashing.  He notes the
huge diversity in mash thickness and speculates that it's style related.
You're no doubt right about the style part (the British, in particular, seem
to like thick mashes,) but much of it might be equipment- or regime-driven.
People who do step mashes in a cooler are forced to end up with fairly thin
mashes, as, to some extent, are RIMS users, or anyone who uses a pump to
recirculate, as I do.  I've noticed that false bottoms are not as tolerant
of very thin mashes as, say, an EasyMasher, showing a tendency toward a set
mash when the ratio gets up above 1.7 or so quarts per pound.  Also, using 
malt that's a bit lower in enzyme content, such as a grist with a lot of 
Munich, requires a fairly thick mash, to avoid thinning out the enzyme pool 
too much. In any case, if you're doing straight infusion mashes, you can 
certainly do very well by staying in the 1-1.3 or so quarts per pound range.


        Ed also asks about the advantages of step mashing.  You might look
at the HBD archives over the last 8 months to see the "Great Protein Rest
Debate."  This is probably the most contentious topic here in recent
memory.  The upshot of it all is that malt has changed a lot over the last
few years, with European malts getting more and more modified, almost to
American malt levels.  A protein rest, or other low temperature rest, is
probably not needed with almost all modern malt.  On the other hand, folks
like me have had problems with chill haze with certain malts, unless we use
such a rest.  In any case, I think step mashes are fun to play with, and
you can see what works best for your malt and your system.  Keep an eye on
the head retention and malt profile, if you try a protein rest, to see if
it has any deleterious effects.


        Ed asks about adding a removable false bottom to a 10 gallon kettle, 
as well.  If you want a really easy and versatile setup, you might consider
Jack Schmidling's EasyMasher.  It works very well for kettle mashing, can
be used in the boil as a drain/hop filter, and installs very easily.  I
still use one in my boil kettle, although switching to a pump transfer 
system forced me to change to a false bottom in my mash tun.  I had some
problems with this at first, that the HBD collective helped me work out.


        Finally, Paul in Vermont warns us about the possible consequences of
putting sparging ahead of the spouse.  Paul, there's a reason I start brewing
at 6AM on Saturdays!

Subject: Step mashing / water:grist ratio / respiration defined


     Hi all,
     
     Ed asks some questions about all grain brewing.  He asks about why and 
     when to do a step mash, wondering if it is something only "high end" 
     brewers do.
     
     It is a common misconception (even amongst American craft brewers) 
     that step mashing produces a higher quality wort than single step 
     mashing.  I believe this thinking is born from the idea that if 
     something is more complex, it must be better.  This, of course, is not 
     always true.
     
     Step mashing is done to utilize malt enzymes that have temperature 
     requirements different from those of the amylases (every mash schedule 
     utilizes the amylases to convert starch to sugar).  Some of these 
     other enzymes are the glucanases, peptidases, and proteases.  These 
     work at lower temperatures than the amylases:  glucanase at ~104F 
     (40C) and the peptidases and proteases working over a range of 
     ~113-140F (45-60C).
     
     By using a step mash with rests at 104F (40C), 122F (50C), and 152F 
     (67C), the brewer would be breaking down glucans in the first rest, 
     breaking proteins in the second rest, and achieving saccharification 
     with the third rest.  This will definitely have an effect on your 
     beer, but does it produce better wort?
     
     When brewing with commercial barley malt, the low temperature rests 
     are not only unnecessary, but they can be detrimental.  Proteins are 
     needed for head retention and body.  Over-cleaving them will result in 
     thin beer with mediocre heading ability.
     
     Modern malts, even the ones from continental Europe, are quite 
     well-modified.  This means that the maltster has broken the proteins 
     down for you.  What was once the job of the brewer is now the 
     maltster's task.  Reviewing the spec sheets of commercial malts will 
     show this to be true.
     
     When brewing with substantial quantities of wheat, rye, or other 
     high-protein, high-glucan materials, the lower temperature rests can 
     be useful.  Otherwise, a single step infusion is fine. 
     ------------------------------------
     Ed also asks about the appropriate water:grist ratio when mashing.  He 
     questions the broad range cited in some homebrew texts.
     
     One good reason to start the mash very thick is if you are performing 
     a multi-step mash and are using boiling water infusions to reach each 
     temperature step.  The mash will thin with each infusion, so you want 
     to start thick.
     
     Mash thickness also has an effect on the chemistry that is going on.  
     Thicker mashes protect enzyme viability, but slow down reaction rates 
     (because of the high concentration of reaction products).  The 
     opposite is true for thinner mashes.  Kunze talks about thicker mashes 
     promoting carmelization (when the tun is directly heated), which makes 
     them appropriate for darker, malty beers.
     
     What does all this mean to the homebrewer?  Not much.  There are so 
     many other variables that have a greater effect on your beer that it 
     is not usually necessary to worry about such minutia.  If you are not 
     adding water during the mash, use a water:grist ratio that allows you 
     to stir the mash easily and maintain a somewhat even temperature 
     throughout.  This works out to be close to Dave Miller's recommended 
     1.25 quarts/pound (2.6L/Kg).
     
     That was pretty long for such a simple answer! 
     ---------------------------------
     Nathan questions the HBD definition of respiration, citing two 
     definitions that he found:
     
     "New Gould Medical Dictionary" -"The interchange of gases of the
     living and the gases of the medium in which they live, through any 
     channel, as in cutaneous respiration"
     
     from "Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary"- "2. biol. a. the 
     sum total of the physical and chemical processes in an organism by 
     which oxygen and carbohydrates are assimilated into the system and the 
     oxidation products, carbon dioxide and water are given off."
     
     He claims that by these definitions, yeast do indeed respire in wort.
     
     I guess they do according to the wording of the first definition, but 
     the second definition does NOT support the notion that yeast respire.  
     Fermentation does not produce CO2 and water.  It produces CO2 and 
     ethanol.  If water was the by-product of fermentation, I doubt beer 
     would have enjoyed such immense popularity throughout the ages!
     
     As a biochemistry major, I was taught that there are two distinct 
     types of respiration, as the above definitions illustrate.  One refers 
     to physical gas exchange.  The other refers to a specific set of 
     chemical reactions that metabolize a carbon source into simpler 
     products, thus releasing energy.  Oxygen is utilized in the pathway.
     
     Yeast don't respire (chemically) in wort.
     
     Have fun!

Charley,


    I just had a 11 gal rectangular stainless steel kettle made with a drain
located in the bottom corner.  I used teflon tape on both the ball valve and
the spigot connection, which are only inches from the gas burner.  I have
had no problems with this setup yet.  Although I have only made 4 batches in
this setup, I see no sign of degradation in those joints.

Subject: Beer Style Series Book


[snip]


I just got off the phone with a HB supply shop owner... no doubt
you know about the fire sale Brewers Publications had on the Beer
Style Series books.  I just learned from this shop owner that
these incredible prices were not made available to homebrew shops
and now customers are coming in saying: "$11.95!?  I just bought
four of these for $3.95 each at a bookstore!"


I've defended the AOB on other things, but to slap the backbone of
the homebrewing industry like this, (in my opinion) stinks.


[snip]


These books ended up on sales tables correct?  That means the have been
"remainedered".  This means several things in the book business


1)  The books weren't selling well enough, so they are sold with a myriad
of other books by the pound at auction.


2)  When the book store buys the remainders, they have NO idea what they
are going to get.  Sometimes its all crap, sometimes there are gems.  When
I worked in the book business and we purchased these "skids" sometimes we
would get nothing but damaged romance novels and at other times Penguin
Classics.


3)  The author has no control whether a book is remainedered.  In fact once
a book become a remainder, the auther doesn't even get paid for the book
being sold.


4)  Most likely the books were not made available to the homebrew stores,
because the books were being auctioned by the pound.  A homebrew store
would probably be able to attend such an auction BUT seeing as you NEVER
know what is going to be in a given skid, it would prove to be a waste of
time.


Now, these are just observations from managing a book store several years
ago.  I DON'T know the details of this particular instance but suspect the
AOB isn't as guilty as they are being made out to be in this thread.


Anyone have any firm details on HOW these books were sold off?


Cheers!
M.

you may want to start well before the atf process with the local regulatory
people. before going to the atf you will need written approval from your
local zoning/building dept.  usually the state will go along with the atf 
ruling to issue a commercial license, but states vary with the regs. 


i agree, get the atf process started early. i think what you are refering to
is the section about having a brewery in a dwelling.  this can be gotten around
as there have been many breweries in MASS and ME that have started in  
basements.  you will have to apply for a variance, but in the past these have
been no problem. things you want to do:
        1) sep entrance to the brewery from outside
        2) locks/alarms or some other security measure to protect the revenue
        3) local/state approval 
this is basically all they required to be able to grant a variance for the 
brewery in a dwelling.  by no means is this the end of the paper trail.


to the folks in maine that started this thread go see tod and suzy foster in
bar harbor, very helpful and they have been doing this for a long time. they
are very inspiring people, tell them i said hi.... good luck on your project.

From: "Michael O. Hanson" <mhanson`at`winternet.com>
Subject: Questions About Amount of Water, Protean Rest, and False


Firstly, Charles Papazian recommends one quart of water per pound of grain
for a protein rest and two quarts per pound of grain for starch conversion
in his New Complete Joy of Homebrewing.  These ratios have worked well for
me.  Some recipes give amounts of water to be used for mashing and
sparging.  Feel free to experiment.  Most brewers I know do.  You'll
probably make a few beers that work better as drain cleaner than beer but
you will learn a lot.


Secondly, A protein rest is generally used with undermodified malts.  Books
on brewing often recommend it for pilsner and lager malts.  I have seen
recommendations for a protein rest for six-row malts also.  A protein rest
reduces the likelihood of chill haze and breaks proteins up into substances
yeast can use as nutrients.  In my experience, you can use a protein rest
whenever you want with little harm to your beer.  If you can get lot sheets
for your malt, it's a good idea.


Thirdly, homebrewing supply shops often carry false bottoms designed to fit
into kettles that can be removed for cleaning.  There is no need to solder
anything in place.  You might want to consider one of these.


I hope this helps,

A couple quick device tips:::


While shopping for other things, I happened to notice (and buy) an Incoloy
heating element at a local home store....Furrow's.  4500W`at`240V for $20.
I'd be surprised if this was a regular stock item, but who knows?
At least they could order such an item for you.  Incoloy is a nickel
alloyed steel which is resistive to corrosion from acids.  Great for RIMS.


How to monitor grain bed in RIMS arrangements?   Slow flow?  Stuck?
It has been mentioned before that either a sight glass or a modified
pressure guage could be added on the outlet of your lauter tun.
I picked up some useful guages fairly cheaply from McMaster-Carr.
The first is the main guage and the second a back-up.
Note the first is glycerin filled while the second is not.
Ideally, neither guage would be used in contact with acidic solutions
without a diaphram to prevent corrosion of the guage innerds, thus the
back-up.

The party line on mash thickness is that less water (a thicker mash)
protects peptidases and beta-amylase over proteases and alpha-amylase.
Protein and starch are polymers of amino acids and glucose respectively. 
Peptidases and beta-amylase cut their respective polymers in the middle,
and proteases and alpha-amylase cut their polymers at the ends by nibbling 
off one unit at a time. 


So what?


Good question.


Again the party line says that a thiner mash promotes more complete starch
conversion and protein breakdown.  Yeah, maybe.  But the bottom line is
that any effect is pretty small and will (IMHO) be swamped by the more
gross effects of mash temperature, profile, and length.  Adjusting your
mash results with temperature, profile, and length is complex enough
without trying to take mash stiffness into account where (again IMHO) the
effects are not well characterized.  


My guess is that most people chose a mash thickness, not for the effects
on wort character, but for the practical effects on process.  For example,
if you are doing step mashes in some sort of cooler where the steps are
made by adding boiling water, it is best to start with a fairly thick mash
because you will have less thermal inertia to get to your next step.  If
you are doing multiple steps, you may end up with a very thin mash of
large volume by the last step.  Another consideration is the mash volume. 
If you are mashing in a 5 gallon Gott cooler with 10 lbs of grain, 2 qts
per pound is not possible since just the water comes to 5 gallons.
Mashout is another consideration.  In my mash procedure mashout is simply
a step from ~150F to 170F.  If I have a 4 gallon mash at 150F it takes
2 gallons of boiling water to make the step, yielding 6 gallons - not 
possible in a 5 gallon mash tun.


I personally consider mash thickness to be a second or third order effect
and have chosen to ignore it in my brewing by setting it to a constant
value of 1.33 qts per pound of grain in all my infusion mashes in my 10
gallon Gott.


Good brewing!
