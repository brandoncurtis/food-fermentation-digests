Martin & Christine ask about priming.  You might check the beginner
write-ups in the technical library at the Brewery (http://www.brewery.org)
and these two articles there:
     * A Primer on Priming, by Mark Hibberd
     * Dave's Preferred Priming Procedure, by Dave Draper: expands on
       work of Mark Hibberd


I don't know if corn sugar takes longer.  How long are you waiting?  How
cool are you storing them?


By the way, Many of us prefer to prime the entire batch at once.  This lets
you boil the sugar in a little water, reducing a (small) infection risk.
Some people find it easier to get consistent results with batch priming,
some do better with bottle priming.

John Watts asks about pumpkin ale: "Does the pumpkin contribute anything
other than mouthfeel?"  I don't know that it even contributes that.  My
pumpkin ale was one of the thinnest I've ever brewed, although it WAS an
early effort (not that I'm an expert now...)  One person posted that his
best pumpkin ale used the pumpkin-pie spices and no pumpkin.


So I'd say, use crystal malt or malto-dextrin powder (is that right?) to
get a sweeter base beer, add the spices, and mash in some pumpkin if you
feel like it.  I'd add the spices very late in the boil, or even "dry
spice" with them -- comments?

Interesting.  Patricia Quintana, in a cookbook, comments that in Mexico

Certainly lime-ades are refreshing.  I believe that citrus replaces some
chemicals lost in perspiration (a rudimentary Gatorade).  This is the most
reasonable-sounding theory yet.  I still don't care for the combo myself.


I do, however, love the image of a bunch of beer-snob wannabes, sticking
lime in their Corona in cold weather because you're "supposed" to drink it
that way, when it's done to make it a better hot-weather refresher!


Of course, if you actually like it, then drink it that way.  Stick a lime
in your Guiness, for all I care, but I wish restaurants wouldn't stick one
in the neck of MY beer without even asking.

Frederick L. Pauly writes that his "nitrogen-purged 02 barrier bag of whole
flower cascade" has little aroma, but his "little plastic bag of cascade
pellets" has a good aroma.


Pelletization give you better access to the heart of the hops.  -snicker-


Seriously.  Here's some speculation.


It may be that the crushing of pelletization releases the aromatics, and
the packaging retained it.  (Your pellets are likely to be in a purged
barrier bag too, if you use a good shop.)  The whole hops are, of course,
uncrushed.  You might try crushing a few of the flowers under a rolling
pin, or boiling them in a little water, and see if the whole hops release
the aroma you want.  If so, it should release in the steeping.


One experiment is worth a dozen wise men (or a hundred wise guys like me).

Subject: Lime


Steve Jackson asks about the use of lime to decarbonate. This is indeed
frequently done by larger breweries and by water treatment facilities
where the source water is hard but seldom by homebrewers in this
country. For as tidy a description of how to do it as one could hope to
find see Hubert Hanghofer's post of 23 Oct 1997 (#2450).


One of the reasons homebrewers in the US seldom use this procedure is
that the water treatement plant will usually have beaten you to the
punch i.e. if the local water is hard they will soften it in order to
prevent occlusion of their distribution system. Thus the water out of
the taps in most places in the US is already about as soft as you are
likely to be able to get it easily by boiling or lime treatement.
DeClerk  indicates than a decarbonation plant is working if the
alkalinity is a millival (50 ppm as CaCO3) or less at the output. The
reason I mention this is because of Steve's comment to the effect that a
small amount of crystal malt will get his mash pH to reasonable values.
This is indicative of a low level of bicarbonate in the water. If
boiling precipitates chalk, lime treatment should precipitate it too. A
hint: "seed" the mix with a smidgeon of chalk to aid precipitation
(boiling or lime treatment).

Subject: Cereal Mashes


In HBD #2759, Jeff Renner describes the process of double/cereal mashing as
"fun".  Gotta agree with him.  The Classic American Pilsner is a great style
of beer and a cereal mash is an enjoyable departure from the usual single
infusion mash.  I try to brew this style once or twice a year.  If the
thought of using cereals in you beer scares you, try an all-malt decoction
mash.


My latest version can be found at
http://hbd.org/cgi-bin/recipator/recipator?group=34&item=280.  It's all gone
now and my chest freezer is dead.  No more lagers until the winter, I guess.


Thanks Jeff.

In case anyone missed it, Mort O'Sullivan submitted what seemed to me a good
explanation of the lack of fermentables from crystal malt.  That was in HBD
#2758.  There has been further speculation on the subject in later HBDs so
I thought maybe some missed Mort's excellent (as usual) contribution.

Dave Humes asked about using Irish Moss in the kettle and reported a
"colloidal suspension hanging in the middle of my fermenters" when he
used it.


I use Irish Moss in every brew that I remember to add it and have experienced
no strange cloudiness in my fermenters.  I usually ferment in a SS Cornelius
type keg so would not see it there but when I have used glass carboys I still
did not see anything like Dave reported.  My beers usually come out pretty
clear. I can't say how much of that is due to Irish Moss, though,  as I have
done no real comparisons.

You are absolutely correct that it would be more accurate to give the
grain bill in terms of percentages of the extract, but then again, let's
consider this a bit more closely...


Indeed you may get more points/pound/gallon from DeWolf-Cosyns CaraVienne
than from Briess 6-row 20L crystal, but if you specified the brands you
used, then either % by weight or % by extract would be equally accurate
although they would not be equivalent (different numbers).  On the other
hand, if you did not give the specific maltster, both % by weight and
% by extract are equally vague, no?

There are exceptions, but I feel that when a writer says: "Witbiers may
contain up to 5% rye in the grist..." they mean by weight.  This (and
things like oats in Oatmeal Stouts and unmalted barley in Dry Stouts)
I believe is the most common occurance of the use of percentages when
talking about recipes.  It has to do with the general rules of formulating
a particular recipe rather than an explicit recipe for a particular beer.


This is what I meant when I've posted "Bitters typically have 5 to 10%
crystal malt, although some have none (most notably Timothy Taylor Landlord)."

Subject: RE:Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout


 "Michael O. Hanson" <mhanson`at`winternet.com> asks:


<<Does anyone out there know of or know where I can find an extract-based


recipe that comes out tasting something like Samuel Smith's oatmeal 
stout?
I know extract is considered inferior to all-grain brewing by some 
brewers.
 I would agree that all-grain brewing makes better beer when the grain is


handled properly.  However, I have a friend who wants to try to make beer


resembling Samuel Smith's oatmeal stout....>>


I would say that there are two things that are the hallmarks of SS 
Oatmeal
Stout.  One is the creamy fullish mouthfeel that others have remarked on.
 


I would not hesitate to use a little (1/2 lb or so) rolled oats in with
some other steeping grains (chocolate malt, dark crystal and roasted
barley) to help achieve the results.  Yes you will be adding some cloudy
starches and proteins.  So what.  It's going to be (or should be) black 
as
night anyway.  Who's going to notice?


Otherwise, Williams sells something called Oatmeal extract.  I don't know


what it is exactly and have never used it, but it may be worth
investigating.  I'm sure it was made for just such a beer. 




The second, and perhaps more critical element, for SS beers is the
pronounced buttery character that comes from diacetyl produced during the


fermentation.  This may be a bit more difficult for you to produce at 
home,
extract or not.  You will want to find a yeast that is a known heavy
diacetyl producer and then try and manipulate the fermentation to get it
really "over the top".  




One technique might be to try and keep the fermentation temperature at 
the
very coolest end for the particular yeast strain being used.  I'm sure
there are other techniques which I can't think of right now.  Perhaps
someone else will chime in.


I understand that the high diacety at SS is due to their fermentation
system called a "Yorkshire Square".  I'm not really up to speed on what 
it
entails.  Again, one of the all-knowing and knowledgeable collective may 
be
able to help us out here.


Go ahead and grab yourself a bottle of any of the Samuel Smith's beers 
and
give it a try yourself.  It's actually even more obvious in the pale ale
and nut brown than in the Stout.   See if you don't taste a whole pound 
of
butterscotch in there, once you start looking for it.


Good Luck,

    I am sending this in because, I wanted to share my night mare with
people who will appreciate it.  Last Saturday afternoon  ( the Fourth of
July) I stared to brew my basic IPA all grain, against my better judgement
because, I don't like to brew when my wives home from work.  Any way
everything was going relay smoothly, my mash temp were right on, my sparge,
was flowing just right, no spill's ect.  At about 8:30pm the wort was ready
to pitch, I had a Qt off slurry all ready to go, I pitched into my 6gal
glass carboy, carried down to the basement, and I was shacking it up with a
solid rubber stopper in.  My worst night mare happen it slipped right out of
my hands, in the few seconds as my would be beer and carboy headed towards
the floor I though it should not break it's thick glass, well it did! and as
5gal of sticky was going to be beer splashed out, I then thought there go's
all my beer, then I though what a bad sticky mess.  After a few more seconds
I looked down at my feet and my toes were a bloody mess. I told my wife to
drop me off at the emergency room, and go borrow a wet vac, at start
cleaning up the mess.  An hour latter I had one toe with stitched up and
tree other with bandages.

In HBD #2762, Steve Jackson wrote


"I have read in various places that bicarbonate (aka "temporary
hardness") can be removed from water by either boiling or by using
slaked lime.... 
<snip>
so I was wondering about the
use of slaked lime to get the bicarbonate out of my water. Since I
have not been able to find any details on its use and its suitability
for human consumption, I figured I'd see if anyone out there has
experience or insight."


Greg Noonan talks about using slaked lime in "New Brewing Lager Beer" (in
an around page 64).


Slaked lime (CA(OH)2) works by converting soluble bicarbonate to insoluble
carbonate by the following reaction:


Ca(OH)2 + Ca(HCO3)2 --> 2CaCO3 + 2H2O


For each gram of bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) in the water, you need about 0.6
grams of slaked lime.  If you know your alkalinity (expressed as calcium
carbonate), but not your bicarbonate ion concentration, multiply the
alkalinity by about 1.22 to find bicarbonate ion concentration (in normal
water), then multiply that times the amount of water (in liters) to find
milligrams of bicarbonate in there, then multiply that by 0.6 to find
milligrams of slaked lime, then divide that by 1000 to find grams of slaked
lime needed (is your calculator warmed up?)


Chemist out there!  Please correct me if I'm wrong.


BTW, Greg Noonan suggests that you don't convert all of the bicarbonate,
leave some behind (as appropriate to the style).  Therefore, you should
back off on the slaked lime added.  I would imagine that if you add too
much anyway, you start to screw up the pH of your water.

Subject: culturing over flame


I am not a biologist, but I believe that I'm a pretty keen observer.
I've never been very comfortable with that "asceptic curtain" concept
of working close to a flame.  You see, if you look at smoke rising
from a flame (like a campfire) and how it acts when it comes near
some other object (like a branch), you'll notice that small eddy currents
are formed that loop back around the object.  You can also observe
this in the heat currents' diffraction of light you see above a clean-
burning flame.


While it may be true that any microbiota that gets sucked into the
actual flame of the burner will be killed, I also believe that the
flame's action will also set up a upwards current of air *next* to
the flame... air that does not actually pass through the flame.
It is this air and the eddys formed around your hands and the mouth
of the glassware that I believe are the concern.  I believe that
working in the vicinity of a flame may actually be *worse* than
working in a relatively dust-free room with still air.


A laminar flow hood works by first *filtering* the air that it
blows across the work area.  This is very different from a flame
whose updraught will be pulling air of questionable cleanliness
from all over the room, don't you think?


Just another point of view...

                    Dark:            24.4
All other parameters are very close to above pale malt parameters.


It is difficult to convert this information to a S.G. But this should work:


>From Greg Noonan's "Brewing Lager Beer" pg 261-2, the chart
labeled Density:
    for a SG of 1.050 (balling 12.5) you need
    1.095 lbs extract per gallon.
1 lb  80% extract yields (1)(.80) = .8 lbs extract. (This is pure
 solids with all water removed.)


So for 5 gallons of wort SG 1.050,
(1.095 lbs)(1 lb syrup /.8 lbs extract) = 1.36875 lbs per gallon
1.36875 * 5 = 6.84375 lbs syrup.


To make this easier:
    (50 pts)(5 gal) / (6.84375 lbs) = 36.53968 pts/lb/gal.
So for an 80 brix syrup, use 36.54 pts/lb/gal and you will be very close.
ie: one can of Alex Pale at 4 lbs and 36.54 pts/lb/gal in 5 gallons total
volume is (4)(36.54)/ 5 = 29.232 SG.
Two cans becomes (8)(36.54) / 5 = 58.464.


Hope this helps

Subject: re: CO2 oops


    In hbd 2760 and 2759 M. W. Bardallis talks about having to leave kegs
with a certain level of CO2 on them based on CO2 volumes in the beer.


  I have both hand held spigots and bar style taps for my kegs.  Though the
hand held spigots can handle a higher dispensing rate than the bar style
taps, both styles can't handle a flow rate that is supplied by pushing beer
out at 12-15 lbs without forming a huge head.  I dispense all my beers at
between 4 and 8 lbs, depending on whether I'm using hand held spigot or bar
style taps and the beer style.  I never recharge the keg but if a long
period has passed (say a week) since my last pint from a certain keg, I will
let the excess pressure off the keg before pouring a pint.  I have not
noticed any major CO2 level decrease in the kegged beer using this method.
Maybe I drink my kegs faster than others, but I don't think you really need
to store your kegs under a set level of CO2 to maintain carbonation levels
unless you are moving your kegs around.  Agitated beer will outgass if the
pressure is not in equalibrium, but still beer doesn't seem to outgass very
fast......


    Anyone else have similar experience?

Subject: Propane indoors - detectors


I too have used propane for brewing indoors.  It still makes me nervous,
this after three years of use.  This is good as it keeps me honest in each
use,
doing  things like soaping each joint in the gas line for leak detection,
keeping the tank outside except while under fire, use of detectors, exhaust
and make-up air fans, no unattended flames, etc...


Oh, to my point.  I use a CO detector like others do.  Its mounted head level
to look for this (slightly) lighter than air gas at the region where I would
be
directly affected.  Just to clarify, the detectors with numeric readouts are
nice because you can see if CO builds up before dangerous levels result.


Oh, now to my real point: you can buy a *propane* detector fairly cheaply
in the same stores that sell CO detectors.  I use one as added insurance,
and if you do this, mount it close to the floor near the tank.  Ideally, the
tank
would be outside, but the lines are still potential leak sources.


And FYI, I frequently boil Teflon (TM, R, P, C, etc) tape in a Teflon pan,
collecting the CF2 and ionic F to use as sanitizer for my fermenters.


I don't know about the rest of you, but I wish Charlie lived somewhere
closer to me than CA....Charlie, you must be fun to talk/do brewing with!!
How about a 60g (more?) batch of worm ale??

OK, I'll bite.. Here's my 2p,


I'm American, west coast, have travelled in the UK many times and prefer
English styles of ales.  I've won 1st places and Best-of-Shows for my
English Pales and Bitters.  I'm not familiar with Rooster's and don't
know if it's British or North American but the hopping schedule you're
considering will turn anything into an American West Coast Style
interpretation. The Cascades alone would do that!  For an English
interpretation I'd use your native hops, maybe Northdown for the
90-minute boil and a 1/3+2/3 Fuggle/Golding mix for the later additions
for a profound flowery Pale.  Your yeast and ferment will account for
your fruity notes.  If you can score some of Rooster's yeast you'll be
well on your way.  I'd like to talk about your hopping schedule though.


When I make a beer that I want to show a firm hop flavor, I bias the
hopping schedule so that more of the target bittering comes from later,
large additions.  This works up a larger profile in flavors you can
taste and which carry aromas which survive the ferment.  If I want a 45
IBU Pale, I take 20% of that 45 IBU target from my 90-minute boiling hop
addition, 50% from a 40-minute addition, and 30% from a 20-minute boil.
I know this is profligate with hops, but the results are very pretty.


So, for instance if only using a 6% AA hop I'd add: 0.4-oz for
90-minutes (9 IBU), 1.3-ozs for 30-minutes (22.5 IBU) and 1.25-oz for
20-minutes (13.5 IBU).  These are worked out using SUDSW and in
real-life I'd fudge to the nearest 1/4 oz and eyeball high or low.  A 75
IBU pale, as you're considering, comes to:  2/3-oz 90-minutes (15 IBU),
2.2-oz 40-minutes (37.5 IBU) and 3-oz for 20 minutes (22.5 IBU).  This
would be *very* big in hoppiness and I'd cut it down to not more than 60
IBU to keep some balance.


Like you, I don't care for a lot of Crystal flavor but I'll often miss
it when absent, I usually add some small portion.  For most of my
English beers I usually have some proportion of Munich-Crystal-Maize as
additional grains.  Make sure your Crystal+Maize amounts to less than
15% of your base grain by weight so it'll convert.  I wouldn't add
wheat, your head will be fine and you can use the diastatic cost in more
flavorful adjuncts.  I suggest trying, 1-lb Munich (or more) + 1/2-lb
crystal and 1/4-lb Maize (or more) in addition to your 9-lbs Pale malt
with a simple infusion at 152F for 60-90 minutes.


Now, after all that, it'll probably turn out that Rooster's is American
and you really want the West Coast style - Jeesh!

**Paul Gatza Named New AHA Director**


Boulder, CO - The American Homebrewers Association (AHA), has appointed Paul
Gatza as its new director. Prior to becoming a member of the AHA, Gatza owned
and managed a homebrewing retail shop in Boulder, Colorado. Gatza has been an
avid homebrewer for the better part of a decade, and has won several awards in 
AHA competitions for his beer and mead. He also serves as a technical advisor
to Zymurgy magazine. He replaces Jim Parker, who left the directorship to brew 
beer in the Colorado mountains (lucky bastard!). 


"We are very excited to have Paul Joining the AHA team," says Cathy Ewing,
vice president of the AHA's parent organization, the Association of Brewers.
"Paul brings a unique combination of non-profit experience, homebrew retailing 
experience and award-winning homebrewing experience with him. He will be an
excellent ambassador for the hobby because he understands brewing and has
worked with homebrewers for many years."


In other AHA news, fans of Zymurgy magazine will be glad to hear it's going
bimonthly. Beginning with the September/October issue, the AHA will publish
the great homebrewing magazine six times a year instead of four. This year's
special "theme" edition of Zymurgy will be released in November, and will
focus on brewers yeast. 


******


I have but one question: Who the hell is Paul Gatza? How is it that the
AHA always manages to find these faceless, nameless people to take the
scapegoat - er - "directorship"?  (OK, sorry: that was actually two 
questions...)

Subject: Refridgerator, glass airlocks, wort chilling


Hi all,
Since I've been lurking for a while, I'll answer an easy one (as will many
others I suspect).


In HBD 2762 Bill Rehm asks:
Does anyone know where I can get glass airlocks
<SNIP>
Try Heart's Homebrew (no affiliation) in Orlando, FL or on the web at
http://www.heartshomebrew.com I have one and like it, but it seems a little
fragile to be boiled with a lot of other things bumping it around.


I am using an old Tappan side by side type fridge to ferment/condition in,
with the Johnson temperature controller.
I am considering the pros/cons of removing the partition between the
fridge/freezer.  The coils are in the back of the freezer behind a metal
cover, (though I haven't actually removed that cover to see them). I'd have
a lot of room but I'm not sure it would be worth it.  Has anyone done this?
I also think I could have a lager in the freezer side and an ale in the
fridge at the same time the way it is now.  The temp is 44F/64F with the
connecting vents at the top and bottom wide open.  I could also put a tap
on the door and keg in the freezer while fermenting in the fridge...
Definately leaning toward leaving it.
I have read some HBD archives that seem to say that generally the defrost
cycle is not a problem.  Comments?
I seem to recall reading that some fridges have heating elements in them in
some outer surfaces to prevent condensation.  Is this true?  If so, would
it be a bad idea to disable them? Could I drill through one and suffer
extreme bodily damage?
I suspect the fridge is costing me a fortune to run since it is in my
garage in Central Florida (ie: 100F outside, 120F in garage?) Has anyone
ever tried to add insulation (panels, canned foams, etc.) to make a fridge
more efficient? S.O. was not interested in moving it into the house!
Last question: Any suggestions on chilling when the tap water is 82F ?
Maybe a chiller in an ice bath then into the wort?  Not a problem now with
extract as I put my small boil volume into a carboy half full of icey
water.  What can I do when I start all-grain batches though?  Personally, I
would rather not let it sit all night (and don't want that thread started
again).  Ice bath isn't an option with a 3 tier system is it?  Ice water in
the HLT and run through chiller in wort?  Would need a recirc. pump too
this for long enough time...  What do other people with hot tap water do?


TIA
Randy

We are admonished to make large starters, up to 1 gallon at times, then

     Been out of the loop lately.....and been in others.....but here's the
latest.....


"Beer History Goes Flat for TV Channel"
    "An American History of Beer," a 30 minute documentary scheduled to air
on the Learning Channel this summer, has been cancelled by Johnathan
Rodgers, President of TLC, after he was made aware of it.
    The show, set to air during the afternoon hours of Saturday, July 11,
and Sunday, July 12th came under fire for being shown during hours when
children were most likely to be channel surfing ....and for blurring the
lines between documentary and 'infomercial.'
    The show, defended by Steve Cheskin, VP Programming, TLC, was cancelled
by Mr. Rodgers after inquiries by the Wall Street Journal. Said Mr. Cheskin,
"Clearly, Anheuser Busch is a good advertiser, and somebody we'd like to do
business with," he said in reference to the 116 million dollar a year beer
advertiser, "In terms of a business relationship, it will help us in dealing
with Anheuser, But we would not take this program unless we thought it was
acceptable."
    WSJ, 7.1.98


"Big Brewers Find Price War Seems to Have No End"
    The WSJ, the very next day ran this article, detailing the efforts and
effects of discounting to maintain share, if not profitability. According to
the "Beer Marketer's Insights," such efforts have lead to A-B's profits per
barrel falling to $90.58 in 1997, from $91.12 the year earlier. Miller's
revenues fell from $80.79 per bbl to $78.19 for the same period. (How much
does your beer cost?)
    WSJ, 7.2.98


Jethro Sez....
    While one wonders `at` the career development of Mr. Cheskin, it seems a
fair bet that the AB program will air, sooner or later. Amid the
controversy, the only thing that is a sure bet to change is the  cost to AB.
This is not a bad thing, for while I am hungry to see any TV devoted to beer
related subjects, I would like to see one of the planet's most voracious
marketers pay for their own advertising.
    After a weekend that saw the re-run of a history of the Coor's family,
(worts) and all, the easy money on this program by AB sez that for sure
there is nothing but a warm fuzzy feeling left for the viewer about the
Busch clan.
    Pay for play is all that is required here!


BATF PC Finally Allows Pinup Brew.......
    Despite having been approved by a federal agency, the United States Army
Air Force, over 50 years ago....images of 'nose-art' from allied bombers of
WWII were finally approved for display on beer cans destined for the US
market from a German brewer.
    The pin-ups, one of whom originally held a bomb, now sporting a lasso,
were denied authorization, as being 'too War-Like," as were the depictions
of bombs used to denote missions completed, in the initial BATF
applications.
    The cans were also declared to be 'too ribald,' so expect the pin-ups to
be more demure than those  originally on the cans sold in Germany.
    The irony lies in the fact that the cans had been sold for some time in
Germany, brewed by a German brewer, with those same markings declared
insufficiently "PC" by the BATF.


1998 MBAA Midwestern Technical Conference...
    In contrast to the National Conference of The MBAA in September, which
would cost individual non-member daily rates of $200 not including social
activities, the Midwestern Division of the MBAA's Conference is affordable!
Beginning 7.17.98 in Madison Wisconsin, the total cost to participants,
including social events, but not tours to local breweries, is only $90. But
for the budget and technically minded, the costs for the Saturday morning
tech sessions is only $ 10!
    For that you get 3 sessions, from a list of 7. Hopefully, one also has
access to transcripts of the other sessions.
    Chatting with Jerry Hilton, organizer, he emphasized the desire of the
District Milwaukee and District St. Paul of the MBAA, to include not only
small micro and pub brewers, but also homebrewers.
    Said Mr. Hilton, "We have had a bit of a disagreement with the National
office over inclusion of smaller folks, and the pricing of offerings, but we
feel that if anyone is interested enough to want to attend our conference,
we are interested in having them."
    While the deadline for application is officially 7.13.98, Mr. Hilton
stated that they would be accepted right up to the moment `at` the door.
Contact Jerry Hilton `at`  <hilton`at`execpc.com> for further info.
    Noting that baby sitting is offered `at` the conference hotel, the Marriott
West, (608)-831-2040, Jethro might even go with the micro-brewer, Robbie.


Brew-Rat-Chat....
    Jethro is pleased to have been associated with the reprobates `at` the
Brew-Rats Cyber Beer Club for a short while now.....He is pleased to belong
to what is now his 4th homebrew club, and the first that is purely cyber
space oriented. Populated by members from the global neighborhood, I am
impressed with the degree of camaraderie expressed amongst brewers that, on
the whole, have never met each other. Much like the HBD!
    While they certainly aren't for everyone, as they not only dispense beer
knowledge, edged with 'puter geek technobabble, but often times the
conversations range from the mundane to the obscene. But, as with any other
e-media, if you don't care for the topic `at` hand, merely scroll down, or just
verbally abuse them! Be careful though,  for they are known to bite back!
    Especially honored among the club is St. Strange, one of whom's writings
will be included in the HBD by Jethro.


Old Thread....
    While Jethro has been plagued by computer woes that have left him for
the first time in years without daily access, (I am writing this on a
borrowed unit), and while he has no desire to open old wounds, a comment
must be made.
    Charles Ehlers' points regarding etiquette and courtesy were well taken
by Jethro, especially considering that we were both members of the same HB
club in Manhattan, Ks.
    But when he alludes to the 'current brew meister' `at` LABCO, Jethro has to
interject. The current 'brewers' `at` LABCO are Heidi Helwig, former bartender
and bar manager, and Lou Kaylor, former bartender and all around good fella.
The brewer in question, Bret Kimbrough, `at` this point seems to be on the East
Coast, apparently having left in less than fortuitous circumstances, some
time ago.
    Further, the only individual I know in the state of Kansas that has ever
deserved the honor, Brew Master, is Steve Bradt, Free State Brewing in
Lawrence, and even he would probably reject the title.
    But "Hail To Brewers!', especially the members of the Little Apple Brew
Crew, Manhattan's homebrew club.
