Subject: Uneven Temperature profile in the mashtun


     We mash in a sankey keg ,not a gott cooler, but experienced the same 
     uneven temperature profile in our early mashes. We had temperature 
     differences as high as 20 deg F, 8" apart in the tun.  Lots and lots 
     of stirring helped, but once we started to recirculate the wort with a 
     pump, our temperature profile stayed within 1 to 2 deg f. throughout 
     the mash. We recirculate during temperature boosts and during the 
     rest, just enough to establish an even temperature profile.
     
     We measure using a thermocouple probe, but any long stem bi-metal 
     thermometer is adequate to check the temperature profile from top to 
     bottom and side to side.  Adding the the pump to the system improved 
     process repeatability, the quality of our beer, and left more time for 
     sampling previous batches.

Check out the Michigan Brewers Guild web page: 
(http://www.michiganbeerguide.com/current.htm) for an interesting article 
on a micro (in the true sense of the word!) and future meadery that is 
operating in our area.  Their name is Dragonmead and they are basically a 
microbrewery using 1/2bbl homebrewing equipment.  It seems their plan is 
to use their small size to maximize the number of styles available to 
their customers.  I have not been up there yet, but a guy I work with 
says they make very good beer.  They have only been open a couple of 
months so time will tell how their operation goes.  


It is an interesting concept for homebrewers wanting to make the next step.

1) I am using a 10 gallon rubbermaid with Phalse bottom and sparge arm.
I cut a piece of racking tube lengthwise and wrapped around the
circumference of the phalse bottom and held it down with my brew paddle

anyone have a way to keep the bottom from phloating up in the water

I had the same problem. I fill 3 Grolsh bottles w/hot water and place

Kevin, try going to www.pubcrawler.com for a listing of brewpubs. Just 
supply the city you will be near and pubcrawler gives you the nearest 
brewpubs. 


If you are comming up I-80 and want a GREAT brewpub, swing up to Jackson 
MI and visit the Jackson Brewery. It's located on I-94 just a couple of 
miles East of US-127. If you like hoppy beer try the Puddleford Ale. The 
food is also super-not what you would expect in a typical brewpub-really 
gourmet.

You dont mention the mash temps but I assume you had a rest in the 
beta amylase region.  If so then I would look at yeast cell pitching 
counts/viability and O2.  BTW, thats one mighty big Ofest! (you could 
wait another week and see if you drop the last 2P to 5P FG.)

Not if your sanitation procedures are good.  Problem is more of final 
gravity.   Did you do a forced fast ferment?  This is crucial to 
determine the real degree of fermentability and hence to decide if 
the problem is wort composition or yeast related.

IMO, the easiest method for home systems is the converted sankey keg 
with a Superb or wok burner.  For fermenting you can use another keg 
or a SS stock pot or several carboys or a food grade trash bucket or 
a custom unitank.


> Second, what are the

IMO, forget it.  Its hard enough to make this business viable with 
capitalization on the order of 2 million dollars much less 5K.  That 
said you could cobble together lots of home made SS  or 55 gal oil 
drums, work you butt off forever, have beer of questionable stability 
and never make a dime.  Ask Joe Rolfe about this, and he had (still 
has?) some nice 2 and 4 BBL unis.

Hogwash and it costs too much to be commercially viable (extracts).


> Subject: commercial examples of high IBU?


High is relative but Rogue lists IBUs on some of their beers.


Tom Bergman makes some very good points about micros and their 
strategic focus which I agree with entirely.  It never ceases to 
amaze me how folks get into the business and think that if only they 
had a huge brewery they could sell tons of beer.  It doesnt work that 
way in todays crowded market where consumers have hundreds of 
choices.  The brands need to be built before the huge brewhouse goes 
in.

I had their 5 gallon Brewhouse as Pilot Brewery. It was a great Research tool,

Kevin, I use the same set-up as you do. I use a piece of copper tubing 
to connect the Phalse Bottom to the spigot opening on the Rubbermaid 
cooler. The copper tube is stiff enough to keep the Phalse Bottom 
anchored to the bottom of the cooler. You are probable using flexible 
tubing to do the connection. My cooler has brass tube fittings on the 
spigot opening to accept the copper tube. Any good hardware store should 
be able to fix you up with the proper sizes to fit the spigot opening on 
your cooler and the copper tubing. (The copper tubing is connected to 
the Phalse Bottom fitting by a very short length of flexible vinyl 
tubing-just enough to allow the assembly to flex enough to slip into the 
copper compression fitting on the cooler).


Good luck!

Subject: Freezer modification question


I have the opportunity to acquire a freezer for $50 form my neighbor.  
The catch is that upon inspection, I realize that one cannot remove the 
shelves because the freezer coils are attached to the underside of them.  
They are not copper coils so I assume they are aluminum, or some other 
silver colored metal that is fairly malleable (at least I assume they are 
malleable b/c they are bent in loops).


The coils are attached to the shelves via clips so I think I can safely 
unclip the coils from the shelves and remove them (shelves).  I was 
thinking of bending the coils back towards the back of the freezer, as 
close to the wall as possible, therefor allowing me to put carboys and 
corny kegs in it.  


Has anyone done this/familiar with these types of freezers?  Anyone got 
any ideas on how malleable these coils are?  I don't want to start 
bending them and have them snap on me.  Should I forget the freezer and 
look for another kind ($50 is hard to beat I think).


Thanks

Just wanted to throw in my two cents worth concerning Frederick's
products. Our local liquor store just ran a special on all of Frederick
Brewing's products ($3.99/six!) so I was able to try all they have to
offer. While I also didn't find the Hemp beers to my liking I did like
some of the other beers very much notably their Stone Beer, the Wild Goose
IPA and the Porter which I found to be very tasty indeed! (went back for a
whole case later). The ESB Red ale was not bad and the "Sunrage Sour
Mashed" beer which I approached with trepidation was surprisingly good -
light and refreshiing, the perfect "lawnmower beer." While the Golden ale
was nothing to write home about I didn't detect any overt evidence of
staling or infections in any of these beers. Also, they make a seasonal
"Hopfest" every year which I had the pleasure of trying at one of
Baltimore's brewfests last Fall and it was EXCELLENT. The best beer at
that show IMHO and I believe it in fact came in first or second place here
as well as in a Barleywine rating last winter.  


P.S. - there are plenty of Victory beers here in Baltimore Tom so next
time you're in town stock up! My local pub has HopDevil on tap ;)

OK folks, I keep hearing about lucky dogs who live near breweries and manage to
get nice large batches of slurry to pitch into their homebrew.  So what's the
technique for getting to the point where you can do this.  I know that if I
walked into the brew-pub near me and asked how I might manage to sneak a pint or
two of slurry, the people would look at me like I was nuts.  What, do you slowly
ingratiate yourself with the brewmaster?  Are most (all) brewmasters so generous
with their yeast, or is asking such a thing a great, huge favor?


I'm asking all this because I wouldn't want to come off looking like a butthead
by asking, yet I do live near a brewery and wonder if I'm missing out on a
really good thing.


Thanks for any random thoughts.

If you're using bulk malt extract, yes.  If you're using cans of extract
or kits, the savings can be considerable.


The question is whether you want to brew good beer, or Great Beer.  Either
answer is fine, but you should know which one is your goal.  I personally
brew good beer and have fun.  I'll probably never win a medal, but I also
won't get shot at -- wait, wrong kind of medal.


Remember the 80/20 rule: 80% of the result comes from 20% of the input.
This is true for a lot of things, and brewing is one of them.  Mashing is
part of the 80% of the effort that gives the last 20% of the quality.

A larger pot can often straddle two burners.  Also, many people spend $50
to get an outdoor cooker.  If you do, I'd look for one with a ring burner
- -- the single-flame "jet engines" put out more heat, but throw a lot of it
past the pot.


> For brewpubs ...  Is there any way to edge into this level of brewing
> for less than $5K?


I suspect the licensing and legal paperwork will consume most of $5K.  (I
assume you're in the USA.)


As far as equipment costs, I doubt that there's anyone selling a turn-key
system in that price range, but you can probably put together a home-built
system within your means.  Your output will be limited, and you'll be
doing a lot of manual labor, but it might work out as a good attraction
for an established bar (that is not depending on your output for most of
its beer).


The only thing I can tell you for sure is to do ALL the research and make
sure you'll be able to get licensed and operating, BEFORE you drop the
money on the equipment!  There are more hoops to jump through than most
people realize.

Good news: you're already doing too much work.


You make a starter to increase the amount of yeast.  We do this with
liquid yeast, because the package contains only a small amount of yeast.


Dry yeast packages contain a LOT more yeast.  Just rehydrate and pitch.


Letting the yeast eat sugar for a couple of hours won't do much.  It takes
a day or so to increase the size of the yeast colony.  On the other hand,
it probably isn't harming them either.


One other reason to make a starter is so you can smell and taste it, and
see if the yeast was infected.  This would also take a day or so to show
up.  I never bother doing this with dry yeast.


Here's the Preferred Method for rehydrating yeast, based on info from
the Lallemand web site:


  1 Boil about a cup of water and let it cool to 104F (which is 40C, I
    think).  35-45C should be OK.


  2 Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water, but don't stir.  Dried yeast
    are very fragile, and stirring will shatter a bunch of them.


  3 After five minutes, most of the yeast are more flexible.  Stir.


  4 After ten more minutes, pitch into your wort.


You're right to start with plain water.  The osmotic pressure of sugar
water would kill a lot of yeast as they rehydrate.


I prefer not to let the yeast sit without food for more than 15 minutes,
but half an hour is not too bad.


> I pitch at 23C.


(Rassin' frassin' darn metric conversions...)


Looks OK.  You will get fewer esters (which give fruity, flowery flavors)
if you ferment a little cooler, about, uh, 18-20C.  (65-70F)


I think in F and convert to C.  If they don't match use the F value.

Unfortunately, one step toward that goal is killing off the micros founded
to make a quick buck by trend-followers.  Don't support a micro just
because it's a micro; support it if it's really trying to provide a good,
high-quality product (whether that product is gimmicky or not).

Great story!  I'd suggest you put water-filled pots on the rack and shake
it a little, just to make sure all the welds are strong.  If one breaks,
I'd rather have 5 gallons of cool water dumped on me than 5 gallons of
boiling, expensive wort.  You've probably thought about that, but your
experience with the acetylene tank makes me bold to mention it.  :-)

I'd expect it to disperse out into the air pretty quickly.  It'll hang
together about as well as steam or smoke.


If you want to guard against HSA, you might float a pie pan on top of
the wort, to cut off air access.  Also, you don't need to thrash around
with the chiller -- a very gentle movement will break up the thermal
layers.  One person does this by turning the water off and on every few
minutes, and the water hammer shakes the chiller enough to do the job.

Like the fellow Spencer quoted, I have a stainless steel mixing
bowl that won't hold liquid because I used to use it for sanitizing
small items in a bleach solution.  Admittedly, concentration was
probably high, and contact time was never more than an hour.


I believe the area of activity is at the site on the vessel where
the surface of the bleach solution and the air meet (Will purging
with CO2 help this?), that is, at the meniscus.  If you can fill a
Corny or whatever so completely that no air pockets remain, it
should be fine.


I still use bleach for many things (eg, carboys), but mostly for its
role as a cheap cleaner rather than a sanitizer.  For stainless such
as Cornys and my 1/2 bbls, bleach isn't allowed, and I either use
PBW or Barkeeper's Friend and some elbow grease.  Bleach is just
not worth the risk for me.

I just had this idea and wanted to run it by the group.
Some of us have trouble getting those leaf hops to stay sbmerged
even with weights. What I do is tie the top of the hop bag with
some dental floss and put the bag into the keg I use for a
secondary. Then I tie the other end of the string to something on
the top of the keg. The hops are usually bobbing about at the
surface when I put the lid on.
But.... what if now I turn the keg upside down! where are all
those hops now? Underneath all that beer.
What do you think?

Hello fellow Hop growers,
        I live in Southern Illinois.  I am growing some Cascade, Northern
Brewer, and Fuggles hops.  This is the 2nd year for all the plants.(2 of
each)  The NB and the Cascade are doing very well. I harvested about 6
ounces, dried, off both plants last year...then there's the Fuggles.  It (2
plants) came up last year well, and produced VERY little.  OK, this was the
first year, I can take that.  Now the 2nd year, the Fuggles came up like
gangbusters.  It grew up just great, but has still no produced any amount of
hops to be useful.  Both the Cascade and the Northern Brewer are doing great
and are covered with hops.  The Fuggles still looks good, although some of
the leaves are turning a bit yellow.  Do the Fuggles take longer to produce?
The Fuggles and the Northern Brewer are within 6 feet of each other.  The
soil and the amount of sunshine/water/fertilizer/soil type are the same.

In response to my criticism of George Fix's book, Principles of Brewing

" I have a relatively short list of errata noted
 - the ones relevent to chemistry are pp 143 - there is something wrong
with the DMS production rate equation and pp 13-19 there is something
rather confusing, *maybe* wrong about some of the water ion
discussion. Also I think that the level of detail in the chemistry
discussions in PoBS may not impress a professional chemist, but
considering it is written for a different audience I don't believe
that it is bad at all. As for the "multitude of errors" - I guess I'd
like to see just what you are talking about. Are these really
conceptual errors - or is it the sort of imprecision that is probably
necessary in a presentation to a general audience.  Would you care to
cite a few examples ?"

        Sodium and potassium hydroxide are not *weak* bases.


        Amino acids are not proteins


        B-vitamins are not minerals


        Chemical equations should always balance. The number and types of
elements on one side must appear in some form on the other side. Charges
need to balance as well. There are many unbalanced equations in the book.
I doubt Dr. Fix, being a mathematician, would appreciate it very much were
I to write a book on mathematics full of unbalanced equations, even if it
was targeted at a lay audience. 


        Carbon should always be forming 4 bonds in organic structures.


        Some steps in metabolic pathways outlined include the relevant
enzymes and important cofactors required while others do not. 




Maybe you will consider such errors minor and that I am being too picky
but it really did put me off while I was reading the book. There are other
mistakes that I do consider nitpicking so I won't discuss these although,
I do believe they too were for the modst part avoidable.


True, a book written towards a more general audience must inevitably be
watered down in many respects but I submit that when trying to present
technical material to a lay audience one should be doubly careful that
what is presented is as accurate as possible. Such a book is likely to be
used as a main source of information for the reader and if there are
fundamental errors in it I believe that you are doing that reader a
disservice. 


Of course, the occcasional typos will get through but the more basic
errors really should have been caught by proper proofreading.

This is not necessarily true (the part about relatively small savings).  The

As far as your next step, I would get a cooler, larger kettle and a propane

I got started with all-grain brewing and I am very satisfied with the results.

IBUs.  The brewery is interesting, as well.  It is the original equipment from
the New Belgian Brewery with a 4 barrel Lauter Tun with a copper pipe manifold

everything I've read so far calls for incredibly high sacch. temperatures,

Warner also mentions a "maltose rest" at 149 that I've never heard of.


Now, I know what mashing at these temperatures would mean for a "normal"

Hello all,


I know this is not a personal add connection, but...


I have not been brewing for a while for a variety of reasons.  One reason is
that I moved and my brewing buddies are too far away... But the main
reason why is because I am visually impaired and I have not met/converted
new friends into brewers (yet).  As an all grain brewer, I need to be able to
read a thermometer to hit my rests.  In frustration, I figured out a way to
solve my immediate dilemma--I will brew an extract batch of PA and use
dry yeast.. 


I would like to hook up with a brewer that lives near Chatsworth CA

Dear Everybody,


I know when I am wrong. It's too bad it's only after I am wrong that I know.
This whole percentage thing kinda went crazy. After looking back to the
beginning I see that I misunderstood the whole point of this threads origin.
I'll bet most recipes intend percent by weight, not extract. I stand by my
opinion that there is a better way to develop your own recipes. But when
publishing for the masses, percent by weight makes more sense due to its
simplicity and ease of implementation.


I became frustrated when several of you were pointing out to me that a small
part of my calculations were incorrect. I thought I understood the meaning
of CG:FG Diff, but enough of you assured me that I did not, (and Timo
pointed to examples) that I do realize my error. Indeed, Spencer, I was
making it more difficult. And, Jim, I only meant that I didn't understand
why you said to go with the pros and ignore the homebrewer texts, when the
pros I have spoken to and the homebrewer texts I have read are contradictory
to your assertion. Nevertheless, the issue is not a hugely important one,
and I didn't mean to raise my cuffs.


So everybody pop one, snap one, and kick back. I'll continue to brew

Subject: mini keg extra curricular ideas


Bret Morrow is looking for other stuff to do with his mini-kegs for variety.


You can do alot with minikegs, risking less than a whole batch and no bottling
time. The key here is that you get enough experimental beer to share, if it
comes out well, and not too much to dump, should disaster strike.


Easy trick-
Make a wheat beer, add a different fruit extract to each mini-keg. Or prime
with different fruit juices. {Pineapple juice should not be overlooked} All
your non-brewing friends will think you are a brewing genius.


Fancy trick-
Make a dark Belgian ale, or a saison style, fully ferment, condition normally
in the mini-keg. Attach the hand pump.. Draw off a pint. Leave the mini-keg
with the headspace in the fridge for a month or so. The beer will slightly
sour or "age". The resulting complex sour/tart beer can be astoundingly good.
I have made my favorite homebrew this way. A dark dubbell with some candi
sugar sweetness, aged until soured, tastes so good you will not believe your
not on a farm in Europe. 
If you cannot leave a spare pump on your keg for a month, remove the tap and
bung after you've drawn off a pint, then reprime with an ounce or so of sugar
and re-bung. Re-tap in a month. If not sour enough, wait a little longer.


Is that a new word, re-bung?

Subject: chlorine pitting of stainless steel


In my experience, pitting will occur where there is exposure to air,
oxygen being the critical factor.  Here's an example:  at a large
brewery where I worked, we installed a new beer supply line to
packaging, but didn't use it for several months.  It had been cleaned
and left packed with a 20 ppm solution of chlorine, made up from soduim
hypochlorite.  Over the length of the run, tiny amounts of seepage at
various valves
must have introduced air.  When we eventually tried to repack the line
with beer, pinhole leaks showed up all along the length of the pipe, and


it had to be replaced.


I'd guess that the examples of pitting others have mentioned occurred at


the air interface with the chlorine solution.  Draining and air drying
(or in this case, repacking with process water) would be the safest way
to leave the equipment.  It's pretty hard to completely exclude air from


any system.  Exposure for enough time to sanitize (~10 minutes)
shouldn't hurt food grade stainless.  I always try to keep in mind the
following :  you can't sanitize what isn't already clean and what's
clean and sanitized is pretty unattractive for bugs to grow on.  So
prolonged soaking probably isn't necessary.

Subject: BU calculation for Rob in Toronto


For whole hops the best utilization you can expect is about 5-8%, even
when boiled for 60+ minutes - at least that I've ever heard of.  Just as


a rough estimate, a 30% utilization would be some four times too high:
your real BUs would be about a quarter of the amount you calculated,
which makes a lot more sense (about 20 BU).  Just for the record, hop
pellets yield much better (because the lupulin has been exposed prior to


pelletizing  and the pellet breaks apart more easily in the boil), at
something like 8 - 20% utilization.  'Your milage may vary' because each


brewing system produces unique results.  (And this pinpoints the problem


of calculating expected BUs - you just about have to get a few actual BU


analyses to figure out what your average utilization is for different
conditions.  It's a chicken and egg sort of thing.....)


Of course to really calculate expected BU, you have to know the % alpha
acids in the hops - which you probably already have in the spreadsheet.
Then you would use the following formula, based on the definition of  1
BU = 1 mg iso-alpha acids/liter wort or beer:


(??? mg hops/??? L)  X (??? mg alpha/100 mg hops)  X  (??? iso/100 mg
alpha) =
 actual hops/total L           % alpha acids in hops
%utilization


     expected mg iso/L beer
      expected BU


The volume should be your cooled wort volume, since subsequent
processing losses won't change the concentration, only the final
volume.  You would have to calculate the contribution for each hop
variety separately, if they have different alpha contents and boil
times.


The other interesting thing to consider is the loss of iso-alpha acids
post kettle - in the fermenter foam, on the yeast, in any other foam
generating episode, in filtration.  So the  % utilization you choose for


the formula above will reflect not only kettle boil, but your overall
experience with the particular recipe being used.  In practice it's not
usually worth trying to quantify the post kettle effect, but it might
help explain results that come in markedly lower than you expected.


BTW, I gotta say I love the metric system for brewing calculations!
