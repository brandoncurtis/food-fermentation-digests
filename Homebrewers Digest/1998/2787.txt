Subject: Re: Improving beer through bigger starters


Hi all,


Alan wants to pitch a large starter, but is concerned about pitching 10%
of a foreign wort into the main batch.  He asks if you can just pitch the
dregs from the starter.


You can just pitch the dregs, but unless the starter is fermented out, 
that will
cut the cell count and select only for the cells that flocculate early. 
 If you
were to repeat this several times with the same batch of yeast, you could
end up with a yeast population that floccs too early.


To maximize the number of cells pitched while minimizing the amount of
alien wort going into the main batch, constantly aerate the starter 
(using an
aquarium pump) and/or agitate it constantly (using a stir plate).  Allow 
it to
ferment out, decant off most of the liquid, and feed it a small amount 
of wort.
Once this is active (or soon thereafter), pitch it.


This process will take longer than your average starter, but it really 
doen't require
much effort (the yeast are the ones doing most of the work).  It is an 
easy way to
improve your beer tremendously.


Have fun!

Subject: Gushers,forced fermentation, Clinitest


Brewsters:


Last week or so George DePiro and Jim Liddil and Al Korzonas
all addressed the problem of not knowing when the fermentation
is finished.  George and Jim both opted for a forced fermentation
at 80F to help Charlie determine the fermentation endpoint of a new
batch of Stout ( I think).


On a different subject, without offering a solution, AlK said:


"As for when you should rack out from under this pancake of yeast,
the question is: "is the beer done?"  Better put: "Have I gotten
enough attenuation?"  Part of this is determined by knowing what
your expected apparent attenuation is for this yeast and calculating
it.  No fermentation is perfectly clean and if you leave too much
fermentable sugar in the beer, you'll have gushers eventually."


Forced fermentations may offer a clue to when the fermentation  will be
furnished, but are subject to indeterminate errors.  Remember that
this same forced fermentation method is also used to determine the
stability of the beer, as a check for unwanted  bacterial fermentation.
Bacteria function better at elevated temperatures, so likely any even
slightly infected beer will give an FG dependent on the bacterial content


as contrasted to a fermentation that was carried out at cooler
temperatures.


AlK also brings up the other issue that certain yeasts like Ringwood
and Samuel Smith's require rousing to bring the beer to completion.
This implies of course that the fermentation is vessel and agitation
dependent as well as dissolved CO2 dependent and therefore
temperature dependent. Ergo, the smaller test bottle at a higher
temperature may give a different result from the larger vessel. Finally,
there is a need to bring the beer back to near the temperature of the
brew, so that a highly accurate FG can be determined. As we have
often pointed out in the past, accurate determination of the FG of a
beer full of CO2 is not hydrometry at its finest. In fact, it is full of
errors
as a method of determining the FG because of the bubbles of gas
that cling to the hydrometer. Worst of all these errors are in the wrong
direction, since the readings of the hydrometer will be higher and lead
the brewer to conclude that the main batch is finished when it is not.


AlK also suggests that we, who make many different kinds of beer,
actually know what the FG is ahead of time.  If we were Budweiser
or used only extracts, this could be an acceptable method, perhaps,
but we aren't and don't.  The whole point of this hobby for most
homebrewers is to make all kinds of beers with various
( intentional or accidental) mash temperature profiles and yeast that
behave differently. As a result, we almost never know what the final
FG will be, since we have no experience.  Given this, how do we know
what the expected FG is supposed to be?


Actually you don't care what the FG is supposed to be, but as AlK
points out to know "Is the beer done?"  This is another way of saying
"Are there any more fermentable sugars in the beer?"


Forced fermentations are probably very useful to determine if
your beer will have a shelf life (most often we  don't care) and to
evaluate your basic cleanliness in your preparation.  However, I believe
they are a cumbersome, 1800s, time consuming and full
of error method of determining a fermentation endpoint. Worst of all
these errors are indeterminate and vary from batch to batch.


Clinitest is superior to this forced fermentation/hydrometer method
for this purpose of determining "Is the beer done?", since it directly
determines the state of sugars in the beer and not the specific gravity
which is only marginally related to the (total) sugar content.  One
minute to run this simple test and you know exactly the state of the
fermentable sugar content of your beer at that point in time.
Visit your local pharmacy for a Clinitest Kit and actually know the
current status of the fermentation near the endpoint without having
to wait days for a suspect result. If you use Clinitest you will never
have to worry about gushers

Subject: jim liddil's post #2784


I was skimming through the digest, and wanted to add a couple of thoughts
on ph and its measurement. Having had some concern over low ph readings at
high temperatures, I have since changed my methods of taking the readings.
Siebel has noted that "by convention, when a ph value is mentioned in
brewing the ph would be the ph that the material would have at room
temperature." I have found that atc ph meters, read much more accurately at
room temp. The probe is a highly sensitive piece, and undoubtedly will have
a longer life when taking readings at room temp. Its my understanding that
the reasoning behind the lower ph at the higher temp is that hydrogen ions
dissasociate with h2o molecules and acids and go into solution. Higher
concentrations of hydrogen ions in solution will give you a lower ph
reading. Is it true that only the "reading" is changing, and not the actual
ph? On another note, when stirring yeast on a stir plate with a magnetic
stir bar, you will generate heat. I like to use three rubber stoppers to
elevate the beaker. Although rather expensive, orbital shakers make a good
alternative for aerating yeast for propagation or forced fermentation.

Subject: Proper Iodophor Temp.




Tim Burkhart <tburkhart`at`dridesign.com> asks:


>What is the optimum water temperature for the use of Iodophor? 


I don't know the optimum "killing" temp for iodophor, but I'd guess that
the hotter the water the better in terms of killing quickly.


However, Iodophor should be used in cold water.  Since iodine is EXTREMELY
volatile - a solid piece will sublimate in just minutes to hours - it acts
more like a dissolved gas, and will quickly evaporate out of a warm/hot
solution.  In some ways iodine is like dry ice only slower.

Subject: A Canning Question / A Propane Question


I have a couple of quick, unrelated questions for
the group en masse:


I have canned wort starters for some years.
When I first started doing it, I picked up
jars from a local hardware store, with no
instructions, and read a little about canning
in homebrew books, but I didn't know
everything there was to know about
standard canning techniques.


The above is mentioned just so you 
realize the habit I'm about to mention
didn't come about because I'm 
incredibly cheap, just ignorant.
Anyway, I didn't know you were 
supposed to replace the lids 
everytime you canned! I have
reused the lids many times,
and I never had any problem with
them. They sealed properly several
times, the wort seemed fine, etc.


So I wonder exactly why you're
not supposed to reuse the lids. If you're
boiling & pressure cooking them,
well, they become sterile, don't
they? Or am I missing something?


On the propane front. I just ordered
an outdoor cooker, which I should
receive momentarily. I purchased
and filled a propane tank. I was
wondering how many batches of
beer those of you who do this regularly
get out of one tank. I was
thinking of getting one of those
adaptors to attaching one of the
mini disposable propane cans,
which I always have around for
yeast culturing, because I'd
hate to run out of propane in
the middle of a brewday, and
I really don't want to have 2
of those monster propane tanks
in my house-or rather, my
back yard-1 is scary enough!

Subject:  RE:inactivity


Earl asked in Homebrew Digest 2785:
 -Snip-
I am a new homebrewer and just did my first batch Weds night.  It is now
Fri. morning and still have no activity.  I followed the directions to the
letter.  Any suggestions, should I wait longer, repitch more yeast, please
help????
 -Snip-


Some more information would be helpful, such as what type of fermenter 
you're using, what your recipe was, and what type of yeast you pitched. 


I'll make a stab at your problem anyway.  Most new homebrewers start with 
an extract recipe, plastic bucket fermenter and dry yeast.  Some 
possibilities are:


1. your ferment has started since you posted Friday and is proceeding 
normally.  Don't do anything different than originally planned for this 
batch.  Take steps to reduce lag time for your next batch.


2. your ferment proceeded normally but the leaky lid of your plastic 
bucket didn't allow enough pressure to build to bubble through your 
airlock.  If there's foam (kraeusen) on top of your fermenting beer, or 
kraeusen stuck to the fermenter sides above the beer, where it rose before 
subsiding, this was probably the case.  Proceed as for 1.


3. If you used liquid yeast but didn't make a starter, the long delay, or 
lag time, is due to the yeast needing to multiply many times before 
there's enough yeast to ferment.  Make a starter next time.  There are 
instructions on the Wyeast packs, at the Wyeast.com web site or search HBD 
archives or the Brewery library.


4.  you used dry yeast but didn't rehydrate before pitching.  Symptoms are 
much the same as pitching liquid yeast without making a starter.  Osmotic 
pressure on dry yeast cells attempting to rehydrate in heavy, sugar-laden 
wort kills a large part of the cells.  Try the Lallemand.com website for 
tips on use of dry yeast.  I can email you instructions for yeast starters 
and rehydrating, if you're web impaired.


5. you may have pitched yeast into wort at too high temperature, over ca. 
110 F. and killed or seriously impaired the yeast, or your yeast packet 
had been mishandled before purchase, killing it.  Try repitching a 
rehydrated yeast packet, use a different source and/or type if you suspect 
your purchased pack.  This is another advantage of making a starter, you 
*know* the yeast is viable before committing your valuable wort to it.


No doubt others will post some good thoughts on your ferment.  I was 
fortunate to start brewing by taking a night class mentored by some 
experienced homebrewers.  Finding a class or a club where you can interact 
with others more experienced will help a lot with those first time 
jitters.  Reading the Homebrew Digest every day will also help, but it's 
not always on point for the problem you have at the moment.  The Brewery 
BBS is also a good source for more-or-less real time interaction online.  
Naturally, information from there as with anywhere online needs filtering 
through your common sense.


I'd also recommend you purchase a good beginning homebrewing book, Al 
Korzonas' "Homebrewing Volume 1" is excellent, and is available from his 
website at http://www.brewinfo.com/brewinfo/   I have found it to be 
better (more correct, thorough and complete) than the widely available 
books from Papazian and Miller,  although I own several of those as well.  
 No affiliation with any commercial entities noted above, just a satisfied 
customer, of course.  Good luck, and Prost!

Subject: Irish Moss vs Carrageenan


It is my assumption that the ability of Irish moss (Chondrus crispus) to
precipitate proteins (and polyphenols?)  resides in its content of
carageenan (also spelled carrageen or carragheen according to the
dictionary).  I also assume that the  carrageenan in Irish moss is
extracted from the Irish moss flakes (is there any other form?) by boiling
it, which I believe is part of the method of preparing carrageenan
commercially.  If my assumptions are correct, why should I not use the
active ingredient, carrageenan, in my brewing instead of Irish moss?

I've heard much discussion about the conventional temperature at which pH
should be measured by the brewer, but I've never heard an answer to the
question, "How was the pH measured by the biochemist when he determined
that the pH optima for the enzyme?"
What is the convention among the biochemists  of the temperature at which
one specifies the pH of the enzyme reaction being measure?  And is this
the convention used by whomever determined the pH optima of the enzymes we
are dealing with?  I really don't care what Miller or anybody else's standard
practice is.  I want to know what the biochemist did when he studied the enzyme!


It seems that unless one has the answer to this last question, we're only
guessing as to the appropriate temperature at which pH should be measured
in the brewhouse.

 As many have already commented I too would be willing to bet that the
temperature is the problem. When I volunteered to work  in a brewpub two
summers ago, I got "paid" either  with finished beer or with  5-10 gallons
unfermented of whatever we brewed that day, which I then took home to
ferment and bottle. I loved their wheat beer brewed with the same ( 3068 )
yeast that you are using. Thus, I often took my" fresh from the kettle", 10
gal ration of this whenever available. Unfortunately I did not have a
refrigerator for fermenting at the time. Since it was the summer, my
fermentation temperatures also reached into the low to mid 80's. When
fermenting this  wheat beer at home,  I never got antwhere close to the
taste of the brewery's beer from the same batch. There was always a strong
raw taste I believe was due to  Esters and/or Fusel Alcohol (bad vodka or
nail-polish like)  and little of the banana taste. 
I also found that the color from the high temp. ferment was decidedly
"greyer" than the beautiful orange shade that a good wheat beer has ( see
the cover photo of Warner's book).


When I started paying attention to temperature control of my summer
ferments, the taste and final color got a lot closer to what I wanted.
Wyeast gives 68 deg F as the optimal temperature for this yeast. At 80 deg,
I bet you had a real ferment gusher on your hands as I have found that this
yeast can qualify for emergency rocket fuel at around 78 deg F but behaves
OK when kept at around 65 to 68 deg F.

Subject: Amstel Lager in the Netherland Antilles


I've just recently returned from a vacation on Bonaire, in the Netherland
Antilles.  The primary beer there is Amstel Lager, which is brewed on the
neighboring island, Curacao.  I was wondering if anyone has any insight on
the brewing process/recipe for this variation of Amstel (versus the Dutch
Amstel).  Has anyone ever toured the brewery in Curacao?  All I really know
about it is that it is brewed with distilled seawater, according to age old
recipes from the Amstel Brewery in Amsterdam (as it says on the back label).
I'm curious if the water chemistry is adjusted to that of "Amsterdam water."
I have never actually had Amstel Lager (not Light) here in the US, as it's
kind of rare, so I really don't even know if the taste is different.  Their
web page (http://www.amstel.nl/lounge/us/m0.html)  says that it is now
available in the US, and that it is a bottom-fermenting lager beer, brewed
from ... malted barley, hops and water.  This, of course, doesn't help much.
:-)


I would love to try to reproduce it for myself and my travel companions.
Perhaps even a recipe for a traditional Amstel Lager would get me started.
All-grain or extract.


Thanks,

I bottle condition my ales using a fridge that I keep at 68 degrees.  Once
my ales are carbonated I don't always have room for all that beer in my
other fridge, and I don't want to turn the fridge I keep at 68 down because
I want to ferment another batch.  So my question is this- How long can I
safely keep bottled beer at 68 degrees?  I need the fridge to ferment my
ales because living in New Mexico we experience about a 30 degree

Subject: hop questions






    I have 2 home grown hop questions:


1.  I have a vine of Cascade which is covered with cones of various sizes.
I am having trouble understanding the books I have on the tests used to see
if the hops are ripe.  I gently squeezed the cones to see if they are
"springy", as in they don't stay stuck together, and they seem to spring
back.  I have cut a cone open to see that the lupins are present from the
center of the hops down to the stem, and they are.  But I have also read
that the cones should be slightly yellow before they are ripe.  My cones are
not yellowed at all, but just about as green the leaves.  I don't want to
wait too long to harvest, but I don't to harvest hops that are too young
either.  Is one test more determinate than another?  For instance, should I
wait till they are yellowed, or is if fine to pick once the lupins are full
within the hops.


2.  I have a vine of Fuggles that has cones, but only 2 per leaf breakout on
the vine, not clustered like on the vine of Cascade.  Is this normal for
Fuggles?  The cones on this vine are also quite small.  They are all about
1/2" long and the leaves are very loose, more like flowers than like cones,
and my Cascade has cones as long as 2.5" and are tight like pine cones.
Could the number of cones and size of these cones on the Fuggles be caused
by a weak vine?  The Fuggles didn't climb nearly as high as the Cascade
vine.

This is true. I get to use the same Depreciation  schedules as the Big
Boys and therefore I'm paying about the same depreciation for scale
(give or take). What makes the difference is that the Big Boys have a
utilization rate much higher than the micros. They put a lot of beer
though the tanks and keep them full. At a micro you do less of that. We
don't do 7 day lagers ;-) Therefore the cost of that equipment (although
probably about the same on a time line) is higher on a volumetric basis.


Now as far as G&A, we beat the pants off someone like A/B...

Yes and No. I used to militate this position frequently. What I found is
that there is real depreciation and there is IRS depreciation. The
former is based in physical reality, the later in political reality. I
hate the later. There is a real cost of equipment; it wears out (some of
it *real* slowly) and therefore there is a replacement cost. On very
slowly depreciating things, the cost of the capital far outweighs the
actual depreciation.. This is a real cost even if you didn't borrow the
money. You have to figure in what it cost you to put that money into
this venture as opposed to some safe investment like T-bills...

Capacity on the scale of a micro exhibits quantized effects. Brew houses
(the limiting sizing thing) come in specific sizes: 7, 10, 15, 30 and up
bbls. Within a range of size, you can move production around with
relative ease. Once you hit the ceiling imposed by the brew house, you
have to rip out that brewhouse and put in another (assuming that you
don't want to run two). This is what I mean by expanding sizes. 


If you start up with a 15 bbl brewery in a 7 bbl market, you gots
problems for a long time to come.

Actually we are in a rather strange market. We came up 2 years ago and
are the first micro within 100 miles. We are both ahead and behind the
curve here. Micro beers are a dime a dozen on the shelves (well, more
than that), but few people know what one is. The hoppy beers of the west
coast won't sell here at all. You can still find $0.25 tap beer.... We
came up very small and are expanding as we generate market. Always
watching our backside too since Leinenkugals is in our back yard.

I mostly agree with you. We have an add budget of about $100/month or
so. We do very little advertising and are using you assertion to it's
fullest. OTOH, people like A/B create market by application of huge
market dollars. This is the basis of lite beer.

Hmmm. People make plenty good money voicing some kind of opinion on
this. While the micro markets must be pretty well saturated on the west
coast, places like the midwest are definitely under done. I had someone
point out that while the large (micro?) like Sam Adams and Petes are in
trouble the smaller ones are continuing the climb... It'll be
interesting to see where it levels out.

Absolutely True. The vast majority of drinkers in this country won't
touch a micro beer if offered one. We have a few people out here who
violate this dictum because we are the local brewery and they try it out
of curiosity / courtesy (and guess what? they like it!)... Maybe a third
of our market is the older W.W.II vets who remember what beer used to
taste like.

Anyone who thinks they can compete with a large brewer is doomed. No we
don't complete with any of these things directly. We do compete for tap
handle space (not on product) with Leinies, which puts in a strange
position. The basic thing here is that a micro *can't hope* to compete
with even a regional brewer so they *must* differentiate themselves
greatly from those. In a crowded micro market, they probably have to
either step up the advertising or take an even narrower niche market.

  Yes, coiling the dispense line will increase the dynamic pressure loss
in the system.  I can even provide a reference:


  "A bend or curve in a pipe, as in Fig. 6.19, always induces a loss
larger than the simple Moody friction loss, due to flow separation at the
walls and a swirling secondary flow arising from the centripetal acceleration.
The loss coefficients K in Fig. 6.19 are for this additional bend loss."

Well the results are in and my first all grain brew turns out to
be,...turpentine.


I'm not worried.


Brew session went exceptionally well.  I nailed my single infusion
temp right on the nose (156 F).  The sparge was smooth and clear.  I
guessed wrong at initial boil volume though and had to top up my
1.068 three gallons of wort with a couple of gallons of tap water to
bring me up to 5.25 gallons (US) for ferment.  I used my new 'Moroni'
gas cooker for the first time (170,000 btu propane cooker, control
valve allows a gentle simmer without sooting problems - $39 US at
BJ's Wholesale).  Did the whole process from grinding to cleanup on
the deck on a beautiful Vermont Sunday.


I'm not worried.


I forgot to rehydrate my dry yeast (Yeast Labs 'Whitbread') in
advance, so I did a real 'quicky' rehydration of about 5 minutes in
lukewarm tap water.  We had a heatwave the day after pitching - I was
on vacation and have no idea how warm fermentation was during this
period, but have reasons to believe it was quite warm.


I'm not worried.


After 3 weeks in the bottle, the stuff is not drinkable.


I'm not worried.


I know that many of the fusels and other harsh flavors will mellow in
time.  Alk had his now infamous 'Home Perm Solution Ale' go on to win
a medal or something after it had aged sufficienetly.  The problem is
that I'm not the most patient person around.  Is there some series of
actions I can take which will speed along the aging process?  Some
combination of abuses we normally avoid so we don't get stale (aged)
beer?


I'm not looking to beat up my whole batch, just a few bottles to see
if I ever will be able to drink this pilot brew.  So what do you
think?  Should I drive around with a sixer in the back of my car for
a week, refrigerate/warm/refrigerate the beer, store under
flourescents, anything else?   I mean, this IS my first all grainer,
I really would like to be able to drink some of it.


I'm not worried, just disappointed.

Mark Snyder`at`WMI
08/03/98 10:06 AM
Dick Dunn discusses the fact that "the folks who deliver 5-gal bottles have
long used a "handle" that has a hand-grip and a fork that grabs the carboy
just below the molded-in bulge in the neck.  This indicates that our
ubiquitous carboy handle is probably quite safe (and that their
_sotto_voce_ instructions are mostly intended to try to keep the
ambulance-chasers at bay) even if handling full carboys."


One point to consider is that the "fork" device will lift the carboy
without placing any extreme forces on the neck of the 'boy since it is
grabbing the neck from two sides and lifting straight through the neck.  A
typical carboy handle of the sort we use lifts the carboy from 'one' side
of the neck, and will place different stress on the carboy neck than the
device Dick describes.  An extreme comparison would be to imagine holding a
carboy only by the neck and parallel to the ground.  Probably not a major
point, but one would be better off to use the handle to initiate the lift
and then support the carboy from the bottom with the free hand when lifting
a full carboy.
Although I haven't had the misfortune of dropping a carboy, either full or
empty, one precaution I take when handling a full carboy is to wear good
quality leather gloves.  Good quality work type with a smooth natural
finish.  Most carboys are probably dropped due to a wet carboy slipping
from ones grip, and you won't believe how well a leather glove sticks to a
surface, wet or dry, until you try it.


Just my 2 cents, and I still have all my toes. :-)

Subject: Women Brewers


There has been some speculation lately about why so few women brew beer 
these days.  One poster suggested lifting heavy carboys, etc may be one 
reason.  As a female brewer, I think it's even more basic than that.  
Most women simply don't like beer.  Certainly not ALL women (no gender 
slight intended), I know a few who love beer.  And there are plenty of 
women who do drink beer, but mainly because that's what's available, 
they don't like it enough to brew it.  Most of my female friends prefer 
wine or mixed drinks to beer.  Part of it may be due to the marketing 
influences which strongly suggest beer as a man's drink (Bud babes for 
example - where are the Bud hunks?).  I've tried converting my female 
non-beer drinkers with homebrew to no avail.  They say it tastes better 
than the beer they're used to, but it still tastes 'beery'.  Remember, 
you have to really like the stuff first before you'll be willing to put 
in the effort to make it.


The general attitude among non-brewers toward me brewing is that men 
think it's really cool, and women think it's really weird/odd/whatever.  
But then, I have other hobbies (motorcycle riding) that are 
traditionally male dominated as well, so it must be a personality quirk.

Subject: Starter gravity


Greetings,


With all the discussion recently about starters, I'd like to ask a
question again that went unanswered several weeks ago.  


Why does Wyeast recommend that starters have a gravity of 1.020? 
That's significantly lighter than the lightest "real" wort.  So it
would seem that yeast pitched from 1.020 starters into higher gravity
real worts might have a difficult time acclimating to the higher
gravity.  Also, it would seem that if you start with a higher gravity
starter, you'll get more yeast.  I suppose a low gravity starter
ferments out faster than a higher gravity starter, so your starters
would take less time to prepare.


Any ideas?
