It seems to me that a tight-enough coil would bend the profile of the
tubing out of round, effectively reducing the diameter of the hose.  An
oval of a given circumference has a smaller area than a circle of that
circumference.  So this may work.

Ook ook ook... I mean, you're generally right.  Do make sure your handle
is the right size for the carboy.  I've read that carboys can slip out of
wrong-size handles.

No, I didn't.  A prior poster made this confused attribution, and it's
taking on a life of its own.  It's not my words or my belief.


My feeling is: one rehydrated envelope is generally "good enough," e.g.
when I'm just making good beer, not brewing for a competition. Those going
for the Very Best should pitch more yeast.  On the other hand, they're
probably building a starter from a liquid culture.

What's so absurd about it?  There are millions and skillions of cells, but
each one is tiny and does very, very little.  25% more starter gives you
25% more cells.


One purpose of exponential notation is to simplify comparing and thinking
about such large numbers.  If you're really trying to quantify the factors
that go into your beer's flavor profile, it doesn't make sense to just say
that a number larger than 1000 or so is "a lot."


BTW, 1EXX is an exponential notation, not an exponential scale.


The other posters claim that they have observed better results with larger
starters.  Have you used larger starters and observed no difference, or
only a small one?


It isn't a difference I worry about right now, since I'm wrestling with
other parts of the process at the moment.  But I don't just discount their
experience out of hand.

We just discussed this briefly on Mead Lover's Digest.  I got at least
one first-hand report of someone boiling bread yeast for 15 minutes and
still getting apparent fermentation from it.  I theorize that some of
the bread yeast got stuck somewhere, e.g. bubbled up onto the side of
the pot, where it safely rode out the boil.


There's non-viable yeast available at health food stores, but it's been
pointed out to me that they don't guarantee it's dead, they just refuse
to guarantee it will work well for making bread.

Subject: Starters


I'm interested in the discussion on starters.


If I take say 7 grams of dry yeast and make a 2 liter starter from it, 
which I
then pitch into my wort and use to ferment my wort, why do I get less 
nasty
by-products of yeast growth, than pitching direct into the wort? I 
would have
thought that the amount of yeast growth would be greater by using a 
starter
first, which has been aerated, and then pitching into an aerated wort, 
and I
get the impression that it is the yeast growth that causes the nasties.
 I
assume nothing is done to the starter to remove nasties that are 
generated
there.


I know I am missing something, because the posts seem to be unaniamous 
on the
subject - can someone turn the light on for me please.


On the subject of geographic diversity of brewing locations which was 
running
some months again, I never saw a greater range south to north of 
brewing than
mine. Invercargill, New Zealand at about 47 deg south and Reykavik, 
Iceland at
about 64 deg North. Currently happily brewing in Helsinki, Finland.

Subject: The long ferment (Wyeast 2206)


It finally quit.  To review: 1.075 Bockoberfest at 52F with Wyeast 2206. 
After 2.5 weeks or so it was down to 1.028. I raised it up to 60F and after 
about 4 days it dropped to 1.020 and stopped dead. Its racked to secondary 
and comfortably sitting at 38F (added 1 teaspoon of gelatin boiled in a pint 
of water) to fine it.


A number of others commented on how long 2206 took for them also. Several 
people had primary ferments of around 4 weeks so I guess this one was pretty 
typical. I suppose a bigger starter might have helped - next time.

Subject: Sweet gale beer


Dear All


I want to try to make a beer with sweet gale. I have read somewhere that
sweet gale used to be a poor mans substitute for hops, but a friend of
mine makes snaps with sweet gale and i tastes very good. I have also
tasted a commercial beer flavored with sweet gale, but the sweet gale
taste was very (to) discrete.
I have a supply of sweet gale and the basic question is how to use it.
My idea is to make a pilsner style beer and use the sweet gale instead
of the flavoring hops, that is adding them in the last 10 minutes of the
boil or so. I have _no_ idea about how much sweet gale to use, but the
leafs smell very potent - much more than the hops I use (we only have
one kind, totally unspecified commercially available here in Denmark) so
I thinking about using about half as much sweet gale as hops. I have
considered to other options namely to make an essence and adding it just


before bottling or dry "hopping" the beer with sweet gale. I'm new to
home brewing (this will be batch #8) so any experience or advice would
be greatly appreciated.


Thanks - Martin

Subject: "Best" Starter Method?


In order not to be confused with the "Better Starter Method Thread" I 
have
changed the subject of this post accordingly.<g>  I'm going to get a bit
risqu here and propose that the Best Starter method is *No* starter!


Yes, that's right, I've had the best feremntation results in beers in 
which
I used no starter at all.  My results have shown complete fermentations, 
no
off flavor development and lag times as short as 2 hours.  There is also 
no
chance of diluting or altering the end beer with nasty spent starter 
media
since ther is none.


Of course, I'm goofing on you a bit since I'm talking about pitching on 
the
harvested yeast cake from the primary of a previous fermented batch.  
Some
might say that this is essentially a 5 gallon starter after having 
removed
the fluid.


A great way to prove to yourself the merits of repitching yeast is to 
make
back to back identical recipes.  In the first, pitch your "normal" 
starter.
 In the second, pitch right on top of the yeast cake.  Of course it might


be prudent to give a little taste of that first brew during transfer to 
be
sure you want to subject the second one to the fermenter.  




I've done this and the results were remarkable.  I used W1056 and the
repitched beer began actively fermenting in about 3 hours and produced an


excellent *clean* beer in short order.  The first batch had detectably
higher levels of fruitiness and never fermnented out as far.  It was a 
darn
good beer too, just differrent


I have been warned by others about yeast mutation and advised that the
yeast should be washed or acid washed between uses, but I have not had 
any
problems repitching 5 or 6 times succesively with no intervention.  After


that I usually get bored with that strain anyway.


For actual conventional starters, I usually mix the appropriate amount of


DME and water in a mason jar and nuke it in the microwave for about 20-25


minutes.  Wicked easy and everything that touches the wort is well
sanitized (maybe even sterilized for a short while).  Microwave starters
are so easy it makes me woinder why anyone would bother canning wort.


YMMV,

Subject: Old Firestone Keg Parts


I posted a question a week or so ago about parts for old Firestone
Challenger soda kegs (racetrack style lid, not Firestone Challenger V or
VI). Specifically, I was interested in the nylon insert that lies
beneath the poppet in each stem.  
I received several comments and suggestions (thanks to Al Korzonas,
Herbert Bresler, John Wilkinson, Stacy Groene).  The bottom line seems
to be that the white nylon inserts that are generally available do not
fit this type of Firestone keg (they are too tall); however, they can be
sanded or filed down successfully. The whole posts including the insert
are apparently available (eg.South Bay Homebrew Supply, no affliation
etc), although I haven't actually got one and tried it on my keg.
Other parts for this type of keg are getting hard to locate, but the fat
O-ring that goes on the beer dip tube is also available.

From: Jeff Pharr <pharr`at`metsci.com>
Subject: sparge water acidification


A question or two on the process of acidifying the sparge water:


Most sources I have read suggest acidifying the sparge water to match
the mash, or at least bringing it down to the pH 5.5 to 6.5 range.  None
however, give suggestions on how to achieve these pH values.  I have had
no trouble adjusting my mash pH up or down using small additions of
calcium carbonate or gypsum.  It has been my understanding that one
should avoid using large amounts of these additive (large being over two
teaspoons per 5 gal), although I must admit that I am not sure what ill
effects emerge if these limits are exceeded.  


Based on these instructions and in the absence of any better
suggestions, I have been trying to use gypsum additions to adjust the pH
of the sparge water downward. But even the addition of massive amounts
(massive being 12 teaspoons in 12 gallons of sparge water), the pH
remains pegged above the upper limits of my pH test strips (pH 7.0).  I
have had similar experiences now with three different water sources and
have decided that there must be another way to drop the pH.


So here are the questions:


What is everyone else doing to bring down the pH?
Should I just start buying gypsum in 50lb sacks?
What are the problems associated with excessive gypsum usage in the
mash?
What are the problems with using sparge water with a pH up around 7.5?


I have not yet requested an analysis of my local municipal water source
but it seems neither extremely hard or soft.

First of all, thanks to everyone who responded to my question a week or
so back on why my first attempt at counter-pressure bottle filling was
a "no-win" as far as choice of pressure.  The consensus: temperature!
I don't know why I didn't think of it, but cooling the beer to 45F was
simply not cold enough, as Al points out above.

This reminds me that I derived a formula and generated CO2 tables several
years ago posted them to the HBD.  Maybe after a few years, it's time to
post the tables and formula again:

Subject:  Stuck fermentation of grape wine


I'm hoping I can benefit from some of your experience(s).  I know there's
not much talk about wines on this posting, but I'll bet someone can draw
from their knowledge and help me.  About two months ago, I started about
50-gal. of grape wine and added sugar, yeast, and yeast nutrient as I've
done so many times before but this time, it only fermented about two weeks
and then stopped cold.


I've checked the acidity level, and it was a little high, but not much, so
I brought it down to acceptable levels according to a wine-making book I
bought by adding water, but nothing happened.  I know the temperature is
fine because I've got another batch that fermented out perfectly right next
to it, plus I've measured it at about 73F.  At this point, the stuck batch
is WAY too sweet to just give up, so I'm wondering if anyone knows anything
else I might try before scrapping the batch.  It's been sitting now for
about 6 weeks without doing a thing.  Appreciate any ideas you might have.
Thanks...

My friend Dave Burley comments on FGs:


>Actually you don't care what the FG is supposed to be, but as AlK

Ah, but I disagree.  I think we do care what the FG is.  Dr. George in
one of his books discusses the affects of FG and how increasing the FG
will increase the sweetness of the finished beer.  I think it went
something like this:


(this is from GeorgeF)
dry - less than 1.010
semi-smeet   - 1.010 to 1.014


(this is my extrapolation)
sweet - 1.015 to 1.020
very sweet - greater than 1.020


Of course, this all depends on the OG of the beer, etc. etc.  But I
think you get the general idea (even Fouch could get this) to help with
beer flavor profile design.


How 'bout Siebel using Clinitest as a quick and dirty way to determine
if fermentation is finished!  What do ya say about this Al? :)

"I suppose one possible compromise would be to step up the starter to 2L

debated also:  do I use the yeast (which is already tired and sitting on
the couch) or use the young active yeast that is in solution?"


I asked Lyn Kruger "Should I use the sediment from a primary fermenter or
the sediment from a secondary fermenter as pitch for my next batch." Her
response was that over time, ( and I think she meant several pitchings) I
would effectively be selecting for non flocculent yeast.


And Steve wrote:
"Maybe you 'lazy types' should try a commecial sized starter for a

It seems to me that most commercial batches are started from slurry, not
starters. In the case that a commercial brewery needs to start anew with
their yeast, they are not likely to build up from a smack pack, but rather
they will purchase a large amount of centrifuged cells. And when they do
need to propogate, they will likely have off flavors in the first few
batches that may need to be blended with subsequent brews.
How's that for lazy?




And Mort was right when he suggested that Lyn Krugers quote
>Governing principal in fermentation:
>The rate of fermentation will depend on the rate and extent of yeast
>growth."
was intended for a normal pitching rate of 10 to 20 M/ml cells. When I asked
her about whether to use the primary or secondary sediments for subsequent
pitchings I had to explain that I was looking at 5 to 15 gallon batch sizes.
But do you mean that we can simply pitch 7 grams of dried yeast per gallon
and forget aeration? Is yeast growth not important?


This is just my opinion. Actual results may vary.

Subject: pH and Temperature; Brix


Hey Al,


Concerning pH you said:
"5.8 at 170F (which would be between
5.9 and 6.1 after cooling to 68F) or 5.8 at 68F?"


I have one of those  handheld pH meter pens...I am pretty sure (*and I mean
I am pretty sure I remember it right, not that I am pretty sure that I can
read my meter) that when I pull a sample of wort and check it at 150F(or so)
that it reads higher than
when I cool the same sample. I'm writing this out of memory; I would
guesstimate that a sample read at 150 says 5.6 and the same sample at 80F
says 5.4.
Are you sure you have this right?




About Alexander's malt, I am confused. I took the brix rating straight from
correspondence with the California Concentrate Company. I think my math
checks out.
Here's Al's reference:
"
Me: So for an 80 brix syrup, use 36.54 pts/lb/gal and you will be very
close.
>ie: one can of Alex Pale at 4 lbs and 36.54 pts/lb/gal in 5 gallons total
>volume is (4)(36.54)/ 5 = 29.232 SG.
>Two cans becomes (8)(36.54) / 5 = 58.464.


AlK:    All was well until near the end.  Peter assumed 36.54 pts/lb/gal for
the Alexanders Pale Extract.  As it turns out, Alexanders is the one
extract that is *considerably* lower pts/lb/gal than all the others.
Most dry malt extracts are 45 pts/lb/gal and most syrups are between
35 and 37 pts/lb/gal.  Alexanders is only 33 pts/lb/gal!  It is less
dense than other extracts because it is concentrated less.  Subsequently,
it is also one of the palest extracts and has less caramel flavour than
most (which may be good or bad, depending on the style, but it's far
easier to *add* caramel flavour than to subtract it!).
"


I don't think I assumed 36.54 pt/lb/gal for Alexander's Pale. I think I
showed it.
CCC says their extract is 80 brix. What am I missing?
I agree with Al's statement about it being easier to add caramel flavor than
to subtract it. I've found it best to use the palest extract you can find
and add color and flavor with specialty grains.


You also nabbed me on my tannin to sherry phenomenon. Sheepishly I say: I
think I was relating to the role of tannins in the development of a wine
over time. I am not sure why I made the jump from there to oxidation flavors
in beer. Could have been the Arkansas Cabernet (don't laugh, it kicks Butt),
or it may have been the Missouri BarleyWine (I know you're not laughing
now), then again, that MacDonald County stuff is fairly funky too.  MyBad.

Greetings folks,


 In HBD#2787, Bob Johnson asked for help in finding a 
safe place to put taps on his freezer-on-top Frigidaire.


 The refrigerant lines in most fridges of this type run from 
the compressor underneath, inside the back, and to an 
evaporator in the back wall of the cabinet, or in the freezer 
compartment. 


 The safest place to drill will be in the door, because 
unless you have a heated butter keeper there, there isn't 
likely to be any electrical wiring in the area. The second 
safest location is through either side wall, midway between 
the front and back of the fridge. The fridge's wiring 
harness may be lurking near the corners, and door 
heaters often run just underneath the door gaskets.


 Having said the above, please understand that any drilling 
carries some risk of damaging either the refrigerant 
tubing, or electrical wiring. Make sure the unit is 
unplugged, and go slowly.
Hope this helps!

Subject: Yeast Data


HBD #2786 had a number of posts with comments about yeast pitching rates.
For a data point, today I hydrated a 5 gm. package of Danstar Nottingham
dry ale yeast (lot 10828609, exp 11/00).  It was refrigerated at the store
upon receipt from the distributor and remained refrigerated until I opened
it.


Cell Count: 7E10 cells
Viability (via Methylene Blue staining):  >99%


With a nominal pitching rate (for ales) of 1E06 cells per ml. per Degree
Plato OG, 5 gallons (19 liters) of a 12P (1.048) wort would require:
1.2E07 cells/ml. X 1.9E4 ml. =   2.3E11 cells, or about 3 packages.
(Sorry, Paul, I don't have a package of Wyeast to do a cell count of it.)


I would wager that most homebrewers underpitch almost every time they
brew...Could this be the origins of THT (That Homebrew Taste)?

Subject: Wyeast 1968 OK for porter/stout?


I've not yet brewed a porter or stout and plan to brew both soon.  I'd
like to brew close to style guidelines, at least for my first attempt at
both styles.  I have slurry from a batch of ESB fermented with Wyeast
1968 that I'd like to be able to use, if appropriate.  The limited
research I've done so far seems to indicate that 1968 probably would be
a good choice for a sweet stout but not a dry stout since you'd probably
more attenuation than the 67-71% that Wyeast lists for this strain.


Does the above analysis sound reasonable?  Can 1968 be reasonably used
for imperial or foreign stouts?  What about porters?  Seems like a more
attenuative strain might be appropriate for a porter but the nice
full-bodied maltiness you get from 1968 might make for a nice brew.  If
it's appropriate for a porter then would it be better for a robust or
brown porter?

Subject: Plato v's Specific Gravity


It seems that one of the few remaining differentiators between those
who do it for fun, and those that do for money (Professional versus
Amateur BREWERS that is), is the unit of measure used for wort gravity
measurement.


I believe that the Specific Gravity that we measure with our
hydrometers represents the ratio of the weight of the solution under
test to the weight of the same volume of pure water.  


On the other hand degree Plato is a measure of the amount of extract
present as a percentage of the weight of the solution.


Personally I find SG very easy to work with, and it has the added
advantage that a ale wort with an OG of 1.048 tends to make a beer
with a final ABV of about 5%, 1.060 = 6% etc.  Also, considering that
you cannot measure Plato directly (need to measure SG and convert to
Plato via tables/formula), what is it that makes Plato more
usefull/meaningfull than raw SG to the professional brewers.


Should I start to divide any SG readings by 4 and talk exclusively in
Plato ?


Thanks for killing the curiosity in this cat.

I brewed a batch of India Pale Ale and added a handful of oak chips I 
purchased 
at the Jack Daniels Brewery.  I soaked them in some Gentleman Jack for 
about a 
week before pitching.  I wanted to give the beer a bourbon barrel taste.
  I 
tossed them directly into the secondary for about 10 days wearing only 
their 
birthday suit.  When I bottled I put a cheese cloth on the end of the 
racking 
cane.  Well it worked!  The oak taste and the bourbon taste was very 
apparent.  
I loved it, most others either loved it or hated it.  When I do it again 
I'll 
add a half handful of chips and go easier on the bourbon.  I'll also 
leave it 
in the secondary for only about 5 days.  If you decide not to add the 
bourbon 
you can just boil the chips in water before pitching.

Subject: pH, Coils, Reducing Sugars


The following is not a lecture on Nernst Equation. There has been some
recent discussion again on the subject of where the brewer should
measure pH. The consensus at Siebel has been reported that it is done on
cooled wort. BHS&Y support this. Individual breweries do what they do
and there are definite advantages to measuring cooled wort. You can't
melt the reference in cooled wort. You won't contaminate the wort with
fill solution if a sample is removed for pH determination. Low
temperature is less stressful on electrodes (even those whose references
don't melt). It's easier to bring a sample out of a mash tun than to get
a pH meter and ATC probe in. In the old days removing a sample was a
mater of practicality. The meter was an elaborate affair - not something
that slipped into the pocket of the lab coat. A sample would have had to
be carried to the laboratory for analysis and would have cooled during
transport . That a shift in pH occurs was well known. DeClerk tabulates
the amount of shift as a function of temperature and, though he says
"When the pH is measured in connection with mashing, it always refers to
the cooled wort." (Vol I p 266) on the next page he says "... the pH
should be measured at the temperature of the reaction." The reason for
this is that the shift in pH, which is real and is related to the fact
that the equilibrium constants for the components of the grist/water
buffer system are functions of not only temperature (i.e. Kevin
Eichelberger's explanation is essentially correct) but composition. Thus
the pH shift depends on temperature shift and on what is being brewed
with what raw materials. If a measurement is taken at room temperature
it should be corrected to mash temperature. In a commercial operation
where the same beer or handful of beers is brewed day after day the
correction can be determined once (by measuring hot and cooled mash),
checked periodically and applied on a daily basis.


The DeClerk publishes a shift of about 0.3 pH units. In my own brewing I
see a shift of about half that. I solicited measurement data from other
brewers and got data from only one respondent who actually measured a
mash (and got similar results) and from another who did measurements
with malt samples on the bench (and got about 0.3).


Thus the application of the correction is "iffy" if you are interested
in knowing pH accurately and we could argue for ever about how accurate
a measurement is needed.


The homebrewer has several options. He can easily access the hot mash
with a handheld meter. Equipped with a proper electrode he can make an
accurate reading but a proper electrode is more expensive than many
homebrewers wish to spend for this function. Therefore, many homebrewers
use cooled mash even though using a pH meter and naturally those that
use pH strips must do that as well.


The real question here relates to whether the 5.2 - 5.4 "optimum" range
which is often cited is at room or mash temperature. BHS&Y (Vol I, p279)
make it clear that it is at mash temperature (they are describing an
infusion mash). "Thus the pH in the cooled wort will be 5.5 - 5.8."
indicating a shift of 0.2 - 0.3.


To return to Kevin Eichelberger's question as to whether the actual pH
changes or just the meter reading the answer is "both" and it is
important to understand this. The change in equilbriun constants
mentioned above is responsible for the former and the unmentionable
equation explains the latter.


With respect to Fred Jonson's question: it is my impression that enzyme
optimum operating points are specified at their optimum operating points
i.e. the optimum temperature is specified at the optimum pH and the
optimum pH at the optimum temperature. I hope one of the pro's will
comment on this.

Jeff McNally explains how coiling a tube increases friction. I was sure
it was Coriolis! (this is humor - at least to me).

Well, the IPA(Dave's Sister Star -- boohoo, *sob*) that I brewed on 
the 25th of July seems to be infected for sure.  I was suspicious of 
it for the last couple days -- looking at the carboy, many particles 
seemed "suspended" in the wort, almost as if it was a big jug of 
some sort of gel.
I used ye ole sanitized turkey baster last nite to take a sample for 
hydrometer reading, and I didn't need more than one baster-full to 
realize.  The beer had taken on a strange viscosity -- slimy, snotty, 
kinda raw egg-whitish thick.  Instead of dripping off the end of the 
baster, it ran in "lines".  Just like a line of mucous from a child's 
nose.  ;)
This is the second time this has happened in two months- but not 
with consecutive batches.  I think I am definitely missing something 
sanitation-wise here once in a while...  Do these symptoms indicate 
any particular sort of infection?


I intend to throw the whole batch out, I just have to bring myself to 
do it sometime.  Probably Saturday morning, when I will whip up a 
quick and dirty low-gravity pale ale.  I am getting thirsty!!!

Subject: Head (de)formation




This spring I made an oatmeal stout.  When it was young, it had a bit
of residual sweetness, a creamy mouthfeel, and a wonderfully dense,
long-lasting head.


Last night I opened one of the last few bottles.  It almost gushed
(granted it was at room temperature).  It made a very coarse head with
lots of big bubbles, which fell quickly.  The flavor was extremely
dry, and the mouthfeel was thin, with non of the creaminess it used to
have.


Clearly some fermentative activity had continued in the bottle.  There
was no really detectable off flavor or aroma, so I don't think it was
bacterial.  But whatever it was had obviously broken down and consumed
at least some of the compounds that were making the good head and
creamy mouthfeel.  


So what happened?  Did continued fermentation (slowly) break down
dextrins, killing the head?  Did the oatmeal contribute some mystery
compounds (b-glucans?) that was degraded in the bottle?  Or was it
something else.


Speculation is invited.

Subject: Carboy Handles


I have to chime in with my $0.02 worth.
I use carboy handles, but have learned the hard way
to NEVER trust them with a FULL carboy.
I carry empty carboys all the time with the handles,
and used to carry full ones that way on the advice of
my homebrew shop owner.  One fine brewday, a full
carboy of freshly pitched wort was on its way to the
fermenting room when it slipped out of the handle and 
dropped nine inches to the floor, with fully predictable
results.  The handle had been checked for tightness
that very day, I was quite anal (and a bit afraid) of
the very thing that happened.
Now, I use the handle as a stabilizing device in holding
full carboys, but always carry them with one arm wrapped
around the carboy pressing it to my stomach and the other
hand holding the handle.
It was the plastic material coating the handle that
slipped and allowed the carboy to fall; I have never seen
a carboy fail at the neck.
Brew on,
Mike
