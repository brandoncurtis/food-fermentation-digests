Subject: Dry hopping


As a first time poster, I'll see how this works...


        I wanted to send a quick note for those who are looking at different
methods of dry-hopping, specifically in a corny keg.  I am enjoying good
success using the following method:
        I drilled a small hole about 1/4" from the end of the dip tube.  After
inserting the dip tube, I used nylon fishing line to thread through the
hole, then tied it tightly around my hop bag filled with whole leaf hops
(the bag being boiled for 15 minutes).  I left only about 3" of 4" of
line between the tube and the hop bag, to ensure that the hops remained
under the surface of the beer and in as much contact as possible.
        It is now 2 weeks since kegging, and the hop flavor is increasing by
the day.  I have only had one or two specks of hop material make it to
my glass so far, although results at the end of the keg remain to be
seen.  Hope this helps someone!

I have to disagree with this and wonder if by chance you did not read the
followup post I wrote after George DePiro's on force fermentation.  Geroge
worte that ne can use a package of yeast to ferment out 100 ml of wort or
so in a day or two to get a true final gravity.  I followed up wiht
description of the way Siebels does the test.  By overpitching one is
producing an evironemtn that is inhospitable to fast grwoing organisms.
Any organism that will grow and cause super attenuation are very slow
growers.  So if one does the 4-5 hour technique the chances of other
microorganism affecting the gravity are essentially nil.  Have you every
tried growing wild yeast or lactic acid bacteria on purpose and seen how
slow they grow?  I have.

No Dave YOU don't care what the final gravity is.  Don't go telling us all
what we care about!  By doing a forced ferment test, in the proper manner,
one can find out what the final gravity is going to be.

That's why Miller and AB still do them even though the have Scaba and Paar
beer analyzers.  All you''re blowing smoke about how inaccurate and
imprecise a hydrometer is, is baloney.  One can learn to use one correctly
and degas the beer etc.  In the forced test the beer is essentially
degassed from the vigorous agitation or stirring used.  So all chemist
should abandone grad. cylinders and pipets because there is no way in hell
one can learn to read a meniscus properly?  Oh please.

Yea, clearly.  But this is purely an acedemic experiment.  It would make no
sense to grow and pitch this much yeast on a commercial scale and most
homebrewers don't have the resources to do this kind of scale up for 5
gallons.  It's easy to do with a 300 ml at Hariot Watt.  and we have to ask
can this make good beer on a repeated basis?  Granted you made your point
but few are going to make beer using this method.  The satement Lord Peter
made is correct for the majority of commercial and homebrewers

NO.  thsi only applies to yeast that are 95+% viable and are already
adapted.  the lag phase is a period of adaption.  Oxygen will only aid in
membrane formation.  it does not help the cells adapt to temperature, nor
does it help them get their metabolic acitivities going.

Lag phase is governed by the temperature of the wort, the state of the
yeast, the flocullating ability of they yeast (have they been acid washed)
and what kind of wort are they being put into (chemcial make up).  The
yeast will suck up all the oxygen and make sterols, but this will not
cahnge the time spend in lag phase. they still have to adpat to the new
environment regardless of oxygen level.

Subject: Acidifying Sparge Water


Jeff Wrote, about problems using Gypsum to Acidify his sparge water.


Adding gypsum to the water will RAISE the pH of the water. It LOWERS the
pH of the mash because it binds with other minerals releasing free
phosphate into the mash and thus lowers the pH.


For those people that feel they MUST lower the pH of their sparge water.
then a few drops of Phosphoric / Lactic Acid will do the job very
effectively (In my water, as always YMMV). Of course you can also use
Citric, Malic or Tartaric acids at a pinch.


Be aware however that over acidification of the wort may result in poor
or no Hot break formation (Thanks to AlK for that one. By the way Al

This growth phase seems to be called the "EXPONENTIAL" not "LOGARITHMIC"
phase by everyone else.  It should also have been noted that the "material"
used up
must be a critical not a supportive(synthesizable) nutrient in order to limit
growth.

Well sterols and UFAs really, which are dependent for synthesis on oxygen, but
can also be absorbed from wort..

There are several reasons for a rate change - not the least of which is that
the simple mono-sugars are used up and so a typical beer is dependent on
metabolizing bigger (slower to catabolize?) sugars during the stationary phase.
It is true that growth requires a pretty fair amount of carbs for energy.   The
few graphs I have do not show this major rate decline in CO2 (a proxy for
fermentation) during the early & mid stationary phase.  I  have a very nice
paper by Gee and Ramirez from  JIB from the 1980's which shows a near linear
consumption of the individual sugars once they started to be consumed until
their individual levels drop too low.  I would assert that under 'normal'
brewing conditions that the fermentation rate starts to drop sometime after,
and not coincident with, the end of exponential growth.


>So, my thinking here is:
>1) Oxygen is the primary limiting factor in yeast growth.


Sterol and (maybe) UFAs ar the limiting factor, whether synthesized of absorbed
from wort lipids.  Also remember that the pitched yeast ideally have enough
sterol to divide ~3 times w/o other sterol synthesis or absorption - so in a
sense the pitched yeast state is a limiting factor to growth too.


>2) The yeast will not begin the logarithmic growth phase until they have
>proper amounts of aforementioned ergosterol.


I strongly suspect this is nearly correct, *but* what you are stating above is
a critical fact of yeast metabolism if true - and so I will need a reference to
really swallow the story that yeast actually WAIT, delaying division until a
"proper" lipid level is developed.  My guess based on competition and so
evolutionary pressure is that yeast *may* delay reproduction in the presence of
sufficient O2, and even more doubtful, that yeast *may* delay reproduction
until wort sterols are consumed. Either/both of these are different from what
you state - and different consequences accrue.  I feel that this theory of a
delay is highly speculative.  It is fully possible that yeast split as soon as
they can grab enough sterol(and many other necessities).  Perhaps you have a
source for this delayed division metabolism - I haven't seen one - but
would love to.


>3) The lag time is the period between pitching and the logarithmic growth
>phase.


Many books, several books on bioreactors, M&BS too, include a transitional
phases too.  This is just a matter of definition - so OK.

>of growth
That's easy - YES, I agree.


>The yeast did not have to wait around to get the proper
>components they need to begin the growth phase.
Doesn't follow, because of crabtree effect in fresh wort (~1% glucose) I'm not
entirely convinced that yeast even *CAN* absorb O2 initially. I have
doubts about whether they really "wait", tho I think it's possible


>5) Does this not mean that not only will the fermentation proceed at a

Not at all - you are ignoring the fermentation that would be occurring due to
the original pitched yeast mass regardless of growth.


Perhaps the problem is this - There are two things that you might mean my
"fermentation".  1/The amount of fermentation that takes place in a given wort.
2/ the amount of fermentation accomplished by a given group of yeast and their
progeny.  Your Seibel definition seems to mean 2/.  While I and M&BS, pp 645 or
G.Fix AoBT pp 79-81 clearly mean 1/.  Many texts state that pitching additional
yeast leads to shorter(faster) fermentations.  This has no meaning relative to
2/.

What I  see are a lot of references that relate lag to delays in producing
permeability enzymes, accounting for shock excretion, osmotic pressure changes
and  metabolic changes to undergo the crabtree effect due to the high (~1%)
glucose levels in AG-Wort.  There are a lot of references in M&BS, vol2 - but
frankly any decent book that covers saccharomyces metabolism should have this.
I'd check, 'The Yeasts', by Cambridge press from memory).

Are you sure this isn't 3 divisions (8X)  Jim ?  3X may make sense in terms of
desired sterol levels, but is clearly out of whack with commercial practice as
I read about it the Tech Journals from either side of the Atlantic.  As I read

You need a geeky engineer to answer this one...


In non-laminar flow regimes, fittings such as elbows (including long radius
turns) generate more frictional resistance than simply the linear path length of
the fitting (if the Reynold's Number is less than 2100, the effect decreases.).
In fact a simplified means to predict pressure drop in systems applies an
"equivalent length" factor to each fitting to represent the linear equivalent of
resistance.


So by coiling the tubing, Laurel is creating a series of long radius ells, which
will offer frictional resistance greater than leaving the tubing in a linear
configuration.


Here's an oversimplified illustration...


Let's assume we have a long radius ell with an inner diameter of 0.25 inch
(D=0.25), and let's set the bend radius (to the tubing centerline) at five
inches (R=5; no ASCII art - use your mind). The linear length of a 360 degree
loop can be computed by calculating the centerline circumference as 2*5*pi, or
~34.2 inches. Cameron's hydraulic data states that the length/diameter (L/D)
value for a long radius ell (R/D=20) is 50.


Since we have a single loop, the equivalent length of our example is:
50*4*0.25 = 50 inches, where
4 = the number of 90 degree ells to form a loop
0.25 = the ID of our example system.


So in fact we've added nearly sixty percent to the linear hydraulic resistance
(not backpressure) by forming a loop with a 10 inch diameter.

        I can't speak for Biochemists, but Analytical Chemists measure 
pH (and most other electrochemical measurements) at 25 C.  The reason 
for this is that a pH meter actually measures a voltage that is 
dependent the hydrogen ion concentration. (yeah, I know that it it is 
really related to hydrogen ion _activity_, but I can brew a batch in 
the time it would take me to explain pH in terms of activities well!) 
Hydrogen ion concentration is dependent on the dissociation constants 
(tendency to
break up into separate ions) of all of the  acids and bases in the
solution.  Dissociation reactions  of weak acids and bases are  
temperature dependent, and also dependent on the concentrations of all 
of the other ions in solution.  


        In addition, the dissociation constant of pure water is highly
temperature dependent.  According to my trusty CRC Handbook, The
(Calculated) pH of pure water would be 7.47 at 0 C, 7.00 at 25 C
(actually  6.99825), and 6.51 at 60 C.  Also any measurement is
dependent on the standards used, which are the buffers used to 
calibrate the meter.  These are calibrated at 25 C, and their actual 
pH will usually exhibit a lesser degree of temperature dependence, 
due to the added twist of the temperature dependence of the 
dissociation constants of the buffer acid and base pairs, but the pH 
may go up or down with temperature, depending on the specific buffer. 
This behavior is relevant not only from a calibration standpoint, but 
because wort contains both weak acids and bases (e.g. polyphenols and 
proteins) and thus is also a buffer, and will exhibit similar 
temperature dependence, that is, unpredictable. (I'm sure that someone 
has done some experiments in this area, so speak up!).  The indicators
used in pH papers also exhibit temperature dependent behavior, as the 
color change is due to changes in ionization of the indicator dye 
molecule.  


ATC on a pH meter can compensate for small differences in temperature,
but in my career, I have had the luxury of taking my samples to the lab
and measuring them at 25 C.  In Situ measurements of pH must account 
for differences in temperature, or all be run at a stated temperature. 


The question to be asked is, "is all of this jargon relevant to
brewing?"  From my limited experience in mashing, I must give an
unqualified "Maybe" 
;-).  I would say that cooling the sample to room temperature should
give quite satisfactory results, and investing in a 25 C temperature
controlled bath would probably not improve your brew. (although if
anyone has done this, please add your $ 0.02!) Keep in mind that folks
brewed at least drinkable beer for thousands of years, and good beer 
for hundreds of years, before the discovery of ionization chemistry (or
thermometers!). The product of controlling these parameters is a more 
consistent brew.
 
        What we need to keep in mind as brewers (and as citizens) is 
that physical and chemical measurements are usually dependent on the
measurement conditions, and unless there is a convention as to those
conditions (such as electrochemical measurements being done at 25 C, or
boiling points given at 1 atm. pressure) data taken out of the context
of the measurement conditions may be at best irrelevant, and at worst,
very misleading.

Subject: Re: sparge water acidification


Jeff Pharr asked "A question or two on the process of acidifying the sparge
water" in HBD #2788, Mon, 3 Aug 1998.
The first one was: What is everyone else doing to bring down the pH?


One simple answer is to use lactic acid.  I get 88% lactic acid from my
local homebrew shop.  It comes in a 4 ounce jar and lasts a long time since
you only need a small amount per brew (Columbus, OH city water usually
requires only about 1 teaspoon per 3 gallons of sparge water to acidify to
pH around 5.6).  The other nice thing about lactic acid is that yeast will
consume it during the fermentation, so it has virtually no effect on the
finished product.  (If you use a ton of gypsum, it will definitely affect
the finished beer, perhaps adversely.)


A word of caution:  Handle 88% lactic acid carefully; after all, it is
concentrated acid and will burn skin, clothing, etc.


Good luck and good brewing,
Herb

Subject: Pharr Out Acidity, Stuck wine, reducung sugars


Brewsters:


Jeff Pharr is unsuccessfully trying to adjust the acidity of his sparge
water with Gypsum.  Gypsum is a poorly soluble, neutral salt of calcium 
and
sulfate ions and by itself in water won't do much to change the pH.  The
reason gypsum works in increasing the acidity ( reducing the pH) of a 
wort
is that the calcium ion from the gypsum reacts with various phosphate 
salts
in the malt which are partially protonated. The even less soluble calcium


phosphate is precipitated and the proton released.  Ergo the pH drops.


To adjust your sparge water I recommend food grade lactic acid, although
other acids like food grade phosphoric will also work. One problem with
phosphoric acid is that it may upset the calcium balance in the wort, so
that's why I stick with the  lactic acid available from your  HB shoppe.


Sparge water around 7.5 may cause the extraction of phenols from the husk


and parts of the endosperm  toward the end of the sparge as the buffers 
in
the wort no longer are concentrated enough to control the pH of the 
sparge.
- ----------------------------
Matt garret has a wine fermentation that is stuck.  Add yeast nutrient ( 
HB
store) and pitch another pack of yeast if the addition of the nutrient
doesn't do it.

"Dave Burley should be pleased to note that the ASBC Methods of analysis

Subject: Gypsum & pH Adjustment


Jeff Pharr has messed with gypsum to try to adjust the mash and sparge
pH and asks:


> What is everyone else doing to bring down the pH?
> Should I just start buying gypsum in 50lb sacks?
> What are the problems associated with excessive gypsum usage in the
> mash?
> What are the problems with using sparge water with a pH up around 7.5?


The reason gypsum (calcium sulfate) works to lower mash pH is because of
a *chemical reaction* in the mash which liberates H+ ions (protons),
which is what makes acid, acid.  In plain water no such reaction takes
place, and you might as well be adding sand or Kool-Aid.


Excessive gypsum will overload your beer with sulfate ions, which
harshens and dries bitterness.  There are a very few styles (most
notably Burton Pale Ales) that can benefit from such an effect but in
most cases this is undesirable.  Calcium Chloride is now more commonly
available than before, and is a better choice in beers that are
sulfate-sensitive.


Sparge pH should be lowered to create a chemical environment less prone
to leaching susbtances from the grain husks which can lend astringency
to the final product.  A pH of 5.7 is a commonly-quoted target.


To lower sparge water pH, you can use food-grade acid.  Your HB supply
store should have 10% phosphoric or 88% lactic acid available.  The
amount of acid required depends on the composition of your water, so use
trial-and-error along with good pH strips or a meter to guide you.


Another suggestion is to prepare enough *distilled* or *RO* water for
sparging, then add malt extract at the rate of about 1 tablespoon per
gallon.  Distilled/RO water is very "pure" water and its pH is easily
influenced from even small additions of acids or bases.  Malt extract is
concentrated wort, which we know is an acid (acids have pH < 7.0, wort
is usually around 5 or so).  I have found that this ratio of extract in
distilled water lowers the pH sufficently to safely sparge without
adding a lot of sugar (something like 2 points of gravity, probably less
than your starter is adding ;-).

Subject: Commercial Starters


Peter Gilbreth comments in hbd#2788:
In the case that a commercial brewery needs to start anew with
their yeast, they are not likely to build up from a smack pack, but rather
they will purchase a large amount of centrifuged cells. And when they do
need to propogate, they will likely have off flavors in the first few
batches that may need to be blended with subsequent brews.


[me] The commercial brewers that I have spoken with regarding this buy very 
large smakpaks from Wyeast and propagate their yeast with small yeast 
propagation batches prior to pitching the slurry into a **production** batch 
of beer meant for public consumption. Thus avoiding the off-flavors in the 
first place. Do you specifically know of a commerical brewer that blends 
their beer to "hide" off flavors due to low pitching rates? Or was this 
conjecture?

Maybe I am just dense but I thought what Laurel meant was to use a long enough

   Oh gods of brewing, I approach ye on bended knee.  (Was that OK?)


   I'm in my first productive year of growing hops.  The Chinook
are just now getting great cones-- long and large-- while the
Cascades cones have been around for awhile (smaller and rounder).
This past weekend I picked about an ounce of the first Cascades
because they seemed dryish.  They smelled really nice, too.
However, after 5 days of air drying they just smell grassy.
What's up?  Did I harvest too early?  Too late?  Dry too much?
Not enough?  Not fast enough?  Could growing conditions have
been suboptimal?
   FWIW, they were papery and springy when I picked them, and
they lost *very* roughly (my digital scale measures in 1/4-oz
increments) 75% of their weight after drying.  The strigs are
brittle.  The cones were of various sizes, ranging from about
1/2" to 1" long.  I can see the golden-yellow lupulin glands,
and when crushed they smell like Cascades.
   Thanks in advance for any conjecture.

You mean the one we like?  :-) It's probably a secondary factor, at least,
in some less-satisfactory tastes.


On the other hand, there are a couple of comments in That Same Issue of
HBD about "adequate" pitching providing a "clean," non-estery beer.  I

"Dave Russell" <drussel3`at`ford.com> asks about using his own hops to match
a hopped extract.  Wow, best of luck, this will probably take you several

utilization (how much of the available bitterness you actually extract
from the hops) will vary based on how much you boil, for how long and how
vigorously, how much malt is in the boil, and a lot of other factors.


Also, John Bull extracts don't ferment out as completely as some other
brands (although some others leave even more sweetness).  You'll want to
use John Bull unhopped extract to match perfectly.


I'll let those who know more about hops give you specific advice.  I'm
just pointing out that you may have a tough time matching it perfectly.
On the other hand, you can easily come up with an excellent beer you will
enjoy, if you don't worry about matching it all that precisely.

I'll grant up front that I'm paranoid, but I personally would dump it and
