Subject: Yeast growth/Repitching yeast/old, thin, bald stout/plato


     Hi all,
     
     Peter talks about growing yeast, and says that pros won't start from a 
     smack pack, but instead purchase centrifuged cells.  While some small 
     brewers do buy litre "slurries" from Wyeast, this is not the rule (nor 
     is it enough yeast to pitch even an average brewpub batch; many 
     brewers grow it up from that stage).
     
     No matter how big of a batch is being brewed, it all starts with yeast 
     on a slant (or plate, or some similar storage medium).  Small brewers 
     (and large) can and do grow yeast just like some of us do.  It's a lot 
     cheaper than buying slurry, and I tend to trust my QC more than I 
     trust Wyeast's.
     
     Peter then writes in response to Mort's statement about yeast growth 
     and rate of fermentation:
     
     "But do you mean that we can simply pitch 7 grams of dried yeast per 
     gallon and forget aeration? Is yeast growth not important?
     
     In short, yes, you can get a complete fermentation by overpitching 
     yeast and underaerating.  Lyn Kruger, Paul Smith and I spoke a bit 
     about how it is possible to use aeration (or lack thereof) to control 
     yeast growth, and thus the final character of the beer.  I think I 
     posted about this stuff back in Feb.  She said they do this at South 
     African Breweries.  They do NOT repitch the yeast that is treated this 
     way, though.  Their goal is to minimize yeast growth in the fermenter.
     
     Paul Smith was of the opinion that while you could control certain 
     flavors characteristics by manipulating O2 levels, it is a dangerous 
     method (because of the increased chance of fermentation problems).  He 
     called this "brewing on the edge."  He believes it is far easier, more 
     reliable, and more reproducible to control beer character through 
     things like fermentation temperature rather than over-pitching yeast 
     with no (or little) oxygenation.
     --------------------------------
     Fred talks about the joys of repitching yeast.  I agree that it is the 
     best way to get your ferment off to a fast start.  It is almost 
     essential when making high-gravity beers.  There are some caveats, 
     though:
     
     Yeast do not store very well.  I have done cell counts on stored 
     slurries (stored at ~38F under unfermented wort, which they slowly 
     ferment).  After 2 weeks half the cells absorb methylene blue (they 
     are dead).  Repitching a culture like this can cause problems like 
     yeasty off-flavors and sluggish fermentations (because you are not 
     pitching nearly as much yeast as you thought you were).
     
     There is also the danger of contamination.  Be very sure that you like 
     the way the mother batch tastes before you commit another batch to the 
     yeast.  Acid washing is not something that many homebrewers have the 
     equipment to do (a pH meter is essential), and it will not cure all 
     infections anyway.  Acid washing yeast with >8% ethanol in the slurry 
     will result in yeast genocide.
     
     If you consistently harvest the earliest (or latest) flocculators, you 
     will be selecting for very flocculent (or nonflocculent) yeast.  In 
     time, you will have ferments that do not behave the way the original 
     one did.  It's natural selection occurring right before your eyes, 
     with you in the role of Mother Nature (sounds fun!).
     
     In summary, harvest the yeast as soon as fermentation subsides (to 
     ensure a viable, robust crop) and use it as soon as possible (within a 
     week).  Chill the yeast to near freezing as quickly as possible (big 
     breweries use heat exchangers, we can use buckets of ice water), store 
     it near freezing and do NOT aerate it.
     --------------------------------------
     Spencer weaves a tale of woe about a stout gone bad.  His oatmeal 
     stout was once a beautiful, vibrant, beer, with a rich body and head 
     to match.  Sadly, it is not growing old with grace (thin and 
     headless).
     
     Spencer fails to mention if the beer is bottle conditioned or 
     filtered, but my guess is that there is yeast present.  If there is no 
     contaminating organism that has chewed up the proteins that are 
     responsible for the good head and rich body, then it is likely that 
     yeast autolysis is the culprit.  There has been some discussion about 
     how Wyeast 3068 is prone to autolyze, and that proteolytic enzymes are 
     released when this occurs.  The same thing will happen with other 
     yeasts, it just may take longer than with 3068.
     
     If you know what the pH of the beer was at packaging, compare it to 
     the pH now.  If autolysis is the culprit, the pH will be higher than 
     at packaging.
     ---------------------------------
     David asks why pro brewers like to use the Plato scale when specific 
     gravity is so convenient.  I like to think of it as Metric vs. 
     America.  The Plato numbers have a meaning that is easy to comprehend: 
      it is the % of sugar in the wort (Plato based his numbers on sucrose 
     measurements, I think, but close enough).  Specific gravity numbers 
     have no intuitive meaning (not to me, at least).
     
     For some strange reason, many homebrewers don't use Plato.  They are 
     the equivalent of the average American (who doesn't know a liter from 
     a kilogram).  My hydrometer has both SG and Plato numbers on it, so 
     using either is a snap.  Plato numbers make certain calculations 
     easier than SG (like figuring out the amount of unfermented wort to 
     add to a batch to get the proper degree of carbonation).
     
     Have fun!

Subject: Re: Crystal malt & mashing


In HBD 2779, Hans mentions:


"A couple of weeks ago, there was a discussion here about mashing
crystal malt.  Stephen strongly suggested to not mash crystal
malt; it would tend to lose some of the flavor that we want from
it.  He suggested adding it at the end of the mash, or even
better, to the sparge water."


I like the idea of not mashing Crystal, and instead steeping it in the
sparge water.  But to me it seems like it would be better to steep it in
the wort form your 2-row (or whatever) just before adding bittering hops
and boiling.  Would this be better?  If not, why is steeping in the Sparge
water ideal?  I am thinking that you have a better chance of losing some
color and flavor from the crystal (as it filters through the grain bed) if
you steep it in the sparge water as opposed to the pre-boil wort.


I would also like to know if Hans or Stephen meant its better not to mash
any specialty grains or just crystal?


P.S. - The recent chain on Phil's Phloater provided me with the real reason
I was getting stuck sparges.  I didn't even bother looking down into my
mash tun after I had the water in it, so I never noticed that the false
bottom was floating up on the side that isn't attached to the drain.

In HBD #2785
Marc Battreall posted Rob Arguello's method of force-carbing a corny.
However he got the gas intake valve the wrong way.  The valve should be

you can hear the gas bubble through the beer. Valve has to be down to allow

First of all, you need to get some pH test trips that read above 7.0.  Or 
better yet purchase a hand held pH meter.  I use lactic acid for acidifying
 my brew water.  My water supply has an extremely high pH (generally in 
the neighborhood of 10.0 to 10.5 - depending on the time of the year it 
is).  The day before I brew, I fill a clean, converted,  bbl beer keg 
with about 12 gallons of carbon-filtered tap water.  I then add lactic 
acid until the pH drops below 7.  It doesn*t take much - usually 3 to 4 mL 
is sufficient.  I then use this as stock water for all of my brewing 
activities (mashing, sparging, make-up water, etc.).  I don*t have any 
idea of the strength of my lactic acid (I bought it at my local brew 
supply store) and I could go into a long discussion about the negative 
logarithm of the hydronium ion concentration and then calculate to the 
milli-mole exactly how much acid to add.  But why bother, I have a decent 
pH meter, so I use it for what it is intended.  Though I have never tried 
it, I hear that food grade phosphoric acid will work as well. 


I do not get too concerned about achieving an optimal pH range during the 
mash and sparge.  I figure my tap water is so alkali that it has to be 
treated.  So I treat it to near neutral and then proceed with my brewing.  
If the water came out of tap at pH = 7, I probably wouldn*t do anything 
at all.


>Should I just start buying gypsum in 50lb sacks?
>What are the problems associated with excessive gypsum usage in the
>mash?


Forget about trying to treat your water with gypsum.  You have already 
found out it will not work for your water.  That much gypsum is can lend a 
harsh flavor to your beer.  It is reported to  accentuates hop bitterness 
also.


>What are the problems with using sparge water with a pH up around 7.5?


It*s not he pH of the sparge water going in to your lauter tun that could 
be a problem, it is the pH of the runnings coming out that could be a 
problem.  I pH of 7.5 going in is perfectly alright.  This is pretty close 
to neutral and the natural acidity of the grain bed will keep the runnings 
low enough.  I have used lautering water as high as a pH of 9 and still 
did not observe overly high pH levels (>6) in the lauter run-off.  Even 
when I sparge for a long time, the specific gravity of the runnings 
usually drops to a point where going any further is not justified, but the 
pH of the runnings is still acceptable. However, do check the pH of the 
run-off on it*s was out of the lauter tun.  If it rises above 6, you may 
be leaching unwanted compounds (phenols from the grain husks) into your 
wort that could cause an astringent taste in your finished beer.

In Cindy Renfrow's excellent book "A Sip Through Time" there are a

Beats me... perhaps the 80 brix is for the bulk and the 33 pts/lb/gal
is for the canned.  I know that the canned extract is far thinner than
most and the Zymurgy article a year or two ago on extracts showed
exactly what the pts/lb/gal were for two dozen extracts.  That's where
I got the 33 from (Rolling Rock couldn't be made from Alexander's,
could it?...naaa...).


***
As for the pH change with temperature, I've never tried to measure the
change... I don't even own a pH meter... I read about it in AJ deLange's
articles in Brewing Techniques and here in HBD.  Check the archives.
AJ says that pH goes down with a rise in temperature, so I believe him.
Incidentally, I suspect the actual pH change depends on your water chemistry.

Three warnings:


1. If the pitched wort is hotter than room temperature, the cooling wort
and headspace can easily suck that chlorine bleach water up the blowoff
tube and into the beer.


2. Some yeasts, e.g. 34/70 (Wyeast #2124 allegedly) and Whitbread,
don't like working in fermenters that are much taller than they are
wide.


3. Having experience three explosions due to too-small blowoff tubes, I
can assure you that with or without the connector (i.e. slipping the
tube right onto the tank fitting after removing the connector with a
wrench) those pathways are just too small.  Yes, I know that the tanks
are rated to 130 psi (new), but if it clogs, the beer will carbonate
and when the clog gets ejected you can lose as much as half of the batch
to foam!

Unless they add bitterness via isomerised hop extract, it's physically
impossible to get much over 100 IBUs.  The solubility of isoalpha acids in
hot wort is only 120 mg/l and you lose a *lot* of that via break and during
fermentation.  My guess is that it's difficult to *reach* 100 IBUs let alone
surpass it.


In my opinion, you can taste the difference between an actual 70 and an
actual 80 IBUs, but getting there is another story altogether!

I think you're being too pessimistic... I've got test reports from Siebel
on beer that I made.  It indicates that I got 27% utilisation from pellets
on a full-boil batch and 22% from a concentrated boil.  My own empiracal
data indicates that I've gotten upwards of 25% utilisation from whole
hops.

I've read where the recommended growth is 5X to 10X, but this is with

Yes.... same malt, hops and yeast.  The visual difference was stunning.
In my extract test, I made up four 1-liter "batches" in Erlenmeyer flasks
using rates equivalent to 1/4 teaspoon per 5 gallons, 1/2 teaspoon per
5 gallons and 1 teaspoon per 5 gallons.  There was also one without any
IM.  The 1/4 teaspoon was crystal clear in 5 days.  At that time, the
no-IM was still cloudy and the yeast still in solution.  The 1/2-teaspoon
and 1-teaspoon batches were even cloudier than the no-IM batch.  After
two weeks, the no-IM was almost as clear as the 1/4-teaspoon batch as
was the 1/2-teaspoon batch.  The 1-teaspoon batch was the cloudiest
of all.
 
I had wondered about the relationship between IM and yeast flocculation
back when Jeff Frane posted about it a few years ago.  This experiment
really opened my eyes to it.  I suspect that the effect may be that
suspended break interferes with the yeasts' ability to flocculate (i.e.
the yeast are coated with break material).  DeClerck even goes so far
as to say that if you don't get a good cold break, it can interfere with
the yeasts' ability to uptake some nutrients.

Marc posted that he has tried Robert Arguello's Force-Carbonation
technique and it works well for him (chill beer in freezer for
4 hours, attach CO2 at 35 psi and then rock for 4 to 5 minutes).
 
I'm not comfortable with that method.  It seems to work for Robert
and Marc, but everyone's freezer is different and everyone's beer
*starting* temperature is different.  So if the beer in the keg
happened to get down to 40F in those 4 hours, 5 minutes at 35 psi
could give you more than 5 volumes of CO2!!!


I urge everyone to print out Alan's excellent tables that were
recently reposted, set the CO2 pressure to the one you need for
the actual temperature and volumes and then rock the keg until
the CO2 stops flowing.  Actually, since I've personlly made the
following mistake more than once, let me suggest that you
disconnect the gas line from the keg during shaking.  Sure,
that bubbling sounds cool, but what do you do when beer starts
climbing up your CO2 hose back towards the regulator?

Greeting Lagerheads...


tis I badger, the fearless brewer...


I have discovered another gadget, and is always the case, I get it working,
but not really sure exactly what all is going on with it...


Gadget:  Chrome Bar Tap directly on my keg thru the use of the Phils Phunny
Gizmo Adapter Thingie.. (I don't know what its called)  its a chromed piece
of metal that fits in the back of a Bar Tap (without the shank) and screws
DIRECTLY onto a Liquid out fitting...


what this results in is a bar tap sticking right out of your keg.  works
GREAT, especially if your camping, and you have a milk crate with a 5 gallon
keg, your tank in the other corner, and the whole thing covered in cloth.
One piece, can move it easily, and the parts and regulators are all shoved
in the sides..


  You can pull Drafts right off the keg.. adds some class..  no more cobra
taps in the dirt..


(no association btw, just a happy happy beer drinking customer)


But My Question (I was getting to that) is this...


since there is ALMOST NO hose or travel length from the keg to the
dispensing end, is there some sort of different settings for the gas? or
something like that?  should I set the pressure Lower? or higher?


thanks!

AJ responded with some helpful information about measuring pH at different

but I'm not entirely sure my question was fully understood.  AJ hit the
nail on the head earlier in his post (the nail I was trying to drive home)
that the relevant pH in question is the optimum pH range of the enzyme.  I
reiterate my  assertion that I am not interested in what anyone's standard
practices or conventions are for measuring  pH EXCEPT the enzymologist who
published the data on the pH optima of the enzyme.


It is conceivable that the pH range at which an enzyme has its maximum
activity under the conditions of a lower temperature could be different
than the pH range at which that enzyme has its maximum activity at 150 F.
The real question is what is the pH range at which the enzyme has its
maximum activity at mash temperatures,   AND  how does the enzymologist
specify this.  My guess is that the listed pH optima are at the optimal
temperature.  This  doesn't mean the enzymologist has to actually measure
the pH of the wort at that temperature.  He could simply cool it and make
the correction as AJ has indicated.  And as AJ have well pointed out, this
is something that one needs to calibrate and not make any assumptions
about if one is truly interested in measuring pH accurately.


So, do the enzymologists have this measurement under control or not?  That
is, do the enzymologists consistently actually measure the pH at the
optimal temperature or do they consistently make the correction for the
difference in temperature?  Or are there some not-so-careful enzymologists
out there publishing  pH optima out there that are uncorrected for
temperature differences?  Can I trust the published pH optima or not?  If
I can, we all know how to measure pH thanks to many who have posted on
this, and there is no problem.  My biggest concern is that there may not a
convention among the enzymologists for measuring the pH optimat??that the
published values have not been consistently corrected for differences
between the temperature at which the enzymatic activity was measured and
the temperature at which the pH was measured.

Yes.  Don't use it for brewing.  Quats are essentially surfactants and
will remain on the surface after drying.  The effect is pretty much the
same as washing your equipment with liquid dish soap and not rinsing
well.  In my line of work (food service sanitation), we use quats a lot,
but never in a bar, brewery, or any other similar situation.

Don't count on it.  TSP is one of the best economical hard surface
cleaners around.  Phosphates have been a tough point for a long time,
but the true culprits (agricultural chemicals) are hardly touched by
it.  Phosphates are not banned for industrial in most laundry
situations, nor for just about any hard surface cleaning application.

Subject: American Brewers Guild-Adv homebrew course


I am seriously thinking about attending the American Brewers Guild 2 day
Advanced Homebrew Course.  I have a few questions of the collective first.


Has anyone here ever attended the course, if so what did you think.  Was it
worth the $160 + hotel + travel costs?  How detailed and indepth is the beer
faults tasting section?  Is this just a 'boil/pitch/stir' course or do they
get indepth into the real cutting edge stuff?


Also, is it worth going to the Woodland CA location instead of the Denver
location (Denver is closer for me) to get into the real brewing school?


My beer budget allows for either this course or a keging system.  Is it
worth giving up my keg system for now?


- ----------------------


Last night I read the article in Brewing Techniques about Sahti Beer and I
was just fascinated by the idea of 'no boil' brewing.  For the moment, I
don't want to brew a real Sahti beer, but has anyone tried
mash/launder/pitch without the boil?  I am imagining a FULL BODIED, protein
rich beer that sticks to the top of your mouth with an overpowering malt
taste.  You would have to drink it fast, and probably use alot of dry yeast
to beat the infection.  What about hop extracts, so you would still have
some bitterness to counter the sweetness?  Any ideas?

Subject: Iodophor, Pe^(rt), homebrew twange, celler temps


Hello Friends-


In 2785, Tim Burkhart <tburkhart`at`dridesign.com>  asks about water temp
for Iodophor. The bottle (in pita to read green print) states "add B-T-P
Iodophor to cool or luke warm  water. Never use hot water."


The thing I hate about the stuff is the mixing directions:


1/4 oz in 2 1/2 gallons of water
capful = 1/4 oz.


That's not a very easy ratio to use for other volumes. So I made a table
on a sticker and put the sticker on the bottle. I used indelible ink.


Gallons        Teaspoons
water        iodophor
1        .6
2        1.2
3        1.8
4        2.4
5        3
 .42        .25
 .84        .5
1.25        .75
1.67        1
2.5        1.5
3.33        2


I grew so attached to my bottle with the table, I refilled it. I spilled
some down the side and the sticker turned black. I was bummed. Then the
next time I used it, all the black had faded and I was joyous (as joyous
as you can be about something like that).


On another note, I was soaking some Martinelly(sp) 7 oz. apple juice
bottles in iodophor. I noticed that the label glue was purple. Does this
indict incomplete conversion? Should I rest the bottles at 155F first?
Are my bottles ruined?




In 2788, Sam Mize says "25% more starter gives you 25% more cells." in
reference to exponential growth. While I agree, we should look at the
implications.


For the sake of argument, assume a wort with no dissolved O2 and two
starters, one with 75 cells and one with 100 cells. As has been well
documented, there is enough sterol for 3 divisions.


That means the 75 cell starter will double to 150, then 300, then 600.
And the 100 cell will double to 200, 400 and 800. 


Although the first starter is still 25% less, we're starting to talk
about significantly differing populations. Then when you add O2 and
enable more divisions, the difference in population is even more
dramatic. 


I say build a starter as big as you can. Every little bit helps.




And then Brian Wurst says "I would wager that most homebrewers
underpitch almost every time they brew...Could this be the origins of
THT (That Homebrew Taste)??"


Well, in my brewery, it was referred to as Homebrew Twang. I pretty much
eliminated it when I started paying attention to HSA.




And now for my question: I'm using an freezer for 'cellering' my beers
and meads. What temperatures would the collective suggest? I've been
dialed in at about 65F.

Pressure drop on Coils


I will throw in my pennies worth. When a liquid travels down a tube pressure
is lost to overcome the friction. When the liquid goes through a chance of
direction, at a bend or curve the more pressure is lost to change the
direction of the liquid, thus a coil will always give a higher pressure drop
than a straight length of tube. You can see the effect if you take a poly
tube flowing and then bend it into a coil. The flow rate drops. A full
discussion and calculation methods are available at ASHRAE or CIBSE design
notes.


Stuck Wine


I have had this problem as well. There is no certain way to solve it, but
the most successful way I had was to take a couple of litres of actively
fermenting wine from another batch and add one litre of the stuck. Aerate
and watch carefully, once this is fermenting again add another litre of the
stick. Repeat this until you have about 10 litres of active starter. Aerate
the stuck wine and blend in the starter. This normally shifts the stuck
wine. What is the condition of the bottom of your fermenter. I mean it's
temperature, I find wine is very susceptible to the bottom temperature have
had stuck fermentation because the bottom was too cold.

Subject: sulfites, etc.


Sigh...I suppose I should have followed this one longer.  I had actually
given up on the thread when Burley first wrote about using sulfiting to
prevent a bacterial-induced off-taste but at a rate that obviously would
not prevent such bacteria, then defended it on a different basis.  I don't
have any patience with such duplicity...it's why I've mostly given up on
the HBD.


But ALAN KEITH MEEKER <ameeker`at`welchlink.welch.jhu.edu> quoted Burley
thus:
> >Although I know this was not your direct point , Dick, I see people are

Complete nonsense.
The "contains sulfites" is required by US law if the sulfite level is above
a certain very low threshold...a level that will be achieved by almost any
winemaker using added sulfites, and even some wines that don't have any
added but happen to acquire enough during fermentation.  It's legal crap
that has nothing to do with process, safety, or health.  It's not a
marketing ploy.  It's a legal ploy by legislators manipulated by the tee-
totaler fringe:-)  You can sort out this much by digging in to the laws and
finding that only alcoholic beverages are required to warn for sulfite
content at such a level.


The "complete nonsense" comment is aimed at the apparent sulfite-vs-nitro-
gen contrast.  Nitrogen is a gas which is inert relative to fermentation
chemistry, but it has nothing to do with combatting bacteria, stray yeast,
or any of the concerns in the original thread.  It's a blanket gas.


> >...I have yet to see any reason not to use this simple compound in

> >in wine...


The two parts of this statement are entirely separate.  There is no good
reason to avoid sulfiting in moderation based on any argument that it is
harmful other than to the sulfite-sensitive (who must also be careful of
restaurant salads, etc.).  OK, so we're in tune there.  But that is off to
the side of whether one should use it in preparation of cider or perry
(remember, that's where this thread started).  The droolingly obvious
reason NOT to sulfite a perry is that you'll kill the natural yeast which
might well be your key to a successful slow fermentation.


Back to Alan:
> I don't think this is just a marketing ploy. I believe that the "contains
> sulfites" label serves as a warning to the small portion of the population
> that is sensitive to the presence of sulfites in foods, beverages, and
> medicines...


Back to "nonsense":  The warnings are applied selectively to wines.  Other
foods which contain much higher sulfite levels are NOT subject to warnings.
I wouldn't mind seeing blanket warnings at some specific level, but what I
(and a lot of other folks) object to is seeing a warning on a wine bottle
which will give somebody x amount of sulfite if he drinks half a bottle,
but not on a salad bar where he'll get (say) 3x amount of sulfite from the
lettuce in a typical salad.  Why do the warnings work this way?  Because
there are folks who really don't want you to drink alcohol, but they can't
get at you directly, so they use indirect ploys like "contains sulfites".

My advice is that you have to expect barleywine to take more time to
bottle condition than lower gravity beers; lots longer.  


I made a BW eight years ago (Sierra Nevada ale yeast, FG was
around 1.022) that I bottled; some with new yeast only, some with
dextrose prime only, some with yeast and dextrose, and some with nothing
at all.  Guess what?  They all eventually conditioned nicely.  The ones
with new yeast conditioned faster, but I was not sastisfied with any of
them before 9 months.  The one with nothing took around two years!  I
was able to wait with great patience because I kegged two gallons that
was ready instantly.  Interestingly, I CP bottled some from the keg and
they did not display the bottle longevity that the others did, giving up
in four years while the others lasted 6.


Just from my single experience, I would say to add yeast, but I would be
interested to learn what others have to say on the subject.

Subject: Oak in Brewing


In HBD# 2787 Alan Meeker asks about the use of oak in beer. There are a few
"uses" for oak in brewing that I know of.(this is in no way inclusive of all
of them) The most common use is in IPA's. Traditionally oak casks were used
to transport the beer "around the Horn" to India.  This imbibed a "oaken"
flavor to the beer.  IPAs today have been fermented on oak chips to mimic
this tradition. I've also had Rauchbiers with this subtle note also. Lambics
especially Grand Cru & Guezes are stored in oaken vessles for a period up to
years. On usage of the oak chips I've placed them in the secondary and this
provides a nice note especially in a strong, hoppy IPA.
Alan's reference to a red wine with oaken character might not be directly
comparable to beer because wines contain lots of tannins (especially reds)
which will add to the "oaken" characterisitcs.
