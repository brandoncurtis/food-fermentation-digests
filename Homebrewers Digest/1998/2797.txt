It just came to my attention that a fellow brewer and BJCP judge that I've
known since I began to brew and judge, Mark Johnston, was killed in an
automobile accident on July 31, 1998.  He leaves a wife and at least one
child.  Mark was a National judge working toward his Master rating.  There
hasn't been any organization identified to which to make donations.  I will
then at least tip a homebrew in his honor.  It may not be the Big Brew, but
join me if you will.

SCENE 6, Take 2: Inside a dimly lit wharehouse within a top secret
government complex located deep in the bowels of a mountain. Mulder has
gained access by picking the $3 Master Lock at the door with a bobby pin.


SCULLY (hesitating at the open door) "Mulder, what are you doing?! We're
not authorized to enter this facility."


MULDER "The truth is in here Scully. I have to find out what they're
hiding from us. You can stay out here if you want to but I'm going in."


[Scully shakes her head, and follows Mulder through the door. Inside we
see a huge dimly lit storage facility with racks stacked to the ceiling
and extending off as far as the eye can see.] 


SCULLY (astonished and confused) "Mulder, what is all this?"


MULDER "The answer Scully. The truth." 


[Mulder reaches forward and pulls off the shelf one of the seemingly
infinite number of glass bottles stacked there. Camera zooms in to
reveal a bottle of red wine. Mulder closely examines the labelling on the
bottle.]


MULDER "This is it Scully, the prooof we've been looking for." 


SCULLY "Mulder, this is the same wine we found next to the oil-coated body
of that mass murderer in Atlanta."


MULDER "And Congressman Watkins, and in Cancer Man's apartment, and... in
my Sister's bedroom just after her abduction."


SCULLY "Mulder, this just doesn't make any sense, what does it all mean?"


MULDER "Isn't it clear to you what's going on here Scully? Look...
(indicates warning label on bottle that the wine contains SULFITES)."
How many more labels do you have to see before you believe? There are
agents of deception at the highest levels of the government, shadow
figures bent on preventing the citizens of this country from consuming
alcoholic beverages. They nearly succeeded during Prohibition but had to
go underground when they were thwarted by people who had discovered the
truth. Now they're re-emerging, using connections they made with the Nazis
in the 1940's. JFK was on to them but they had him eliminated. For awhile 
they were based at Area 51 until the 1970s when they were forced to move
due to rumors of secret UFO tests being conducted there." 


SCULLY "Mulder what you're saying is crazy."


MULDER "Is it Scully? There are powerful forces at work here, they've
infiltrated every level of the government, including the FDA. They want to
scare people away from drinking alcohol."


SCULLY "But why Mulder, why would anyone want to do that?"


MULDER "An invasion, from outside our solar system. Hyperintelligent
coackroaches from another dimension are massing to take over the planet.
Consumption of alcohol makes a person immune to their mind control rays."


SCULLY "Mulder that's ridiculous! The warning label is just to caution
people who may be sensitive to sulfites. There's no nefarious
uber-conspiracy at work here."


MULDER "Is that right Scully? Then how do you explain the fact that the
labelling went into effect at the same time as the Challanger disaster?
How do you explain the sudden turn around in testimony by Monica Lewinsky
at precisely the same time that sulfite use is being discussed on the HBD?
These aren't coincidences Scully - they're diversions carefully
orchestrated to obscure the truth. The American wine lobby is powerful and
wants to discourage the drinking of French wines so it's putting the
sulfite labels on the wines to frighten the American public."


SCULLY "Wait, I thought you said it was alien Nazi cockroaches??"


MULDER "Scully it doesn't matter *what* the conspiracy theory is just that
there *is* a conspiracy theory. No matter how paranoid you are you're not
paranoid enough."


Suddenly the lights black out. Creepy violin music cues up...


SCULLY "Mulder what's going on? Mulder it feels like cockroaches are
crawling up my pants!!


MULDER (breaking open one of the wine bottles) "Quick Scully! Drink
this!..."

Badger asked about perforated pizza pans:

When I set up my RIMS, I ran out of money before I purchased a SS false
bottom for my lauter/mash tun. As a temporary fix I purchased one of those
perforated 12 inch "AIR BAKE" pizza pans from Walmart. I drilled a bunch
more hole in the thing (3/32 nds) and a single large hole in the middle for
my pickup tube to pass thru. The pan tried to float on me the first time, so
I put a SS hose clamp and washer on the pickup tube. When the pan and tube
are installed in the keg, the clamp and washer are above the pan and hold
the pan in place.


As I said, this was supposed to be a temporary fix, but after many many
batches in this rig I am still using it. I also added one to my boiler and
it helps keep the vast majority of hops out of my fermenter. One of these
days I will find the bucks for a SS screen, but the pizza pan is working
just fine. My efficiency in this RIMS runs 80% according to "ProMash".

Subject: What am I tasting?


Let me state up front that I'm a complete ignoramoos when it comes to the
nuances of tasting.  My tasting notes often look like:  "Yummy, but too much
hops."  So in what follows, I'm going to be (admittedly) VERY vague.  Apologies,
and I hope I can still get a answer to my questions (or at least some good
guesses).


I had a Nut Brown Ale at Brewer's Alley in Frederick, Maryland the other day
that was fan-damn-tastic.  I hit the Old Dominion Brew Pub with some regularity,
drink pretty fresh (when I can) bottles stuff from hither and yon, always drink
the local beer when traveling, etc.  The brown from Brewer's Alley had a fresh
sort of taste to it that reminded me of some of the best beers I ever got when
back in the Portland, OR area ---- also a bit like some damn fine home brews I
had (my own and my friends') back when I got my start around 1990 or so.


What I'm wondering is what could have been so pleasant in the nut-brown that I
wouldn't get at Old Dominion drinking a brown, or at any other good brew-pub
 ...... could it be that the beer was just exceptionally fresh?  I'll mention
that the beer was your basic nut-brown ale ---- not cask conditioned, not made
with funky ingredients, just your basic malt-hops-yeast-water type beer. 


The main reason I'm looking for an answer here is so I can actively seek out
this fine quality in other beers ---- that's why I'm hoping it's not simply
fresh-beer.  Besides, ain't what I'm drinking other places fresh?  And BTW, my
latest home-brews don't have this quality even when I drink 'em almost
embarrassingly young.


Thanks for answers or WAGs.  And anyone familiar with Brewer's Alley Nut Brown: 
any pointers to similar stuff?

Subject: Michigan Brewpub Report




Steve Alexander said:


Perhaps I didn't state my point clearly enough.  To reiterate, we need to
communicate which are the good, the bad, and the ugly breweries over this
forum


Which reminds, me it's time for another installment of my Michigan 
Brewpub
Review!  (Don't worry, Alannnn and Phil- I won't pick on Harpers, or 
menial
laborers)    ;(


On a side note regarding my previous comments about Harpers in Lansing 
(which
drew a bit of fire- Sam- check out HBD's 2618, 2620, 2624 (my favorite) 
and
2626):
I have tasted the cardboardy oxidation off taste in another newly started
brewpub which went away quickly.  Perhaps in the course of training staff
 how
to properly fill the kegs?  Oops!- thinking out loud again.
Haven't been back to Harpers since.  Don't get out that way much.


Anyway, My "tasting notes" on local MI breweries:


Grand Rapids Brewing Company.  (single yeast facility- 1056)
West Michigan's premier brewery of the pre-prohibition days.  Their 
Silver
Foam, a light colored fruity ale was gaining National fame before 
prohibition
shut down the brewery.  Current offerings include Silver Foam, River City
 Red,
and Lumberman Dark.  A rotating fruit and spice beer is always on tap, 
with
seasonal variance.  Personally, I think their beer has been lackluster, 
or
"hit and miss" since brewmaster Mark Stehl moved on.


Robert Thomas Brewing Co. - Grand Rapids (at least two strains)
"Restoring the Local Brewing Tradition one Beer at a Time"
And doing a good job, too.  With three initial offerings, these guys are 
doing
quite well.  Hefe-Weizen- an authentic German style wheat really nails 
the
style, with an authentic wheat yeast strain.  Their Kings Cross Porter is
 a
good porter, with a faint chocolate flavor.  The Par 5 Pale Ale is a 
little
light on the hops, perhaps, but that's just me.


Bob's House of Brews- Grand rapids (multiple yeast strains)
This guy (Dennis Holland) has got guts!  He started serving Cask 
Conditioned
Ales with no apologies- cellar temp. low carbonation and extra hops.  A
different style every Wednesday.  One of his cask conditioning ales
accidentally got carried up to the third floor of the BOB (Big Old 
Building,
housing five different restaurant/bars) when they ran out of Bud.  They 
were
surprised and not pleased to get a mug full of cloudy, flat, warm beer.
Dennis changed the locks on his brewery the next day.
Best brewpub I've been to.  His Saaz Pils is UNBELIEVABLY good until it 
drops
bright (all his beers are unfiltered), then it is only believably good.
Other offerings: Dutch Treat Wheat-(American style), Weatherball Red ESB,
Festive Amber (a less hopped version of his IPA), IPA, Broomaster Stout,
Smokey Scotch Ale, and Gran Prix Ale, a smooth 13 malt endeavor.  It's 
ALL
good!


Big Buck's Brewery Grand Rapids (single yeast strain- shipped down from
Gaylord after a few generations)
I haven't had a beer there that I liked.  Friends have told me they like 
it
more than GRBC (see above), so maybe it's a matter of taste.  I think the
brewmaster slipped during a brew club tour when he said that they use 
corn and
rice adjuncts in all their brews, and they yeast is "second use" yeast 
from
Gaylord, the origin of the Big Buck chain.  Just doesn't seem to me that 
rice
and corn should go in ALL styles of beer.


Arena Brewing Co. Grand Rapids(not sure about the yeasts used)
I have not talked with the brewer yet, but I think he knows what the heck
 he's
doing.  This is the place where I tasted oxidation in three of his beers 
all
on the same night (shortly after they opened).  Since then, I have not 
found
it again.  Golden Pale Ale- a light German interpretation of the style- 
Light
and refreshing. Arena Pale Ale- haven't tried it. Steel Head Red- Good 
toasty
flavor, sweet finish.  Porter Delux- The next beer I'll try- Sounds good.
Dortmunder Export-Good malty rich flavor.  Yummy!  Seasonal Saison- A 
citrusy
Belgian brew.  Pretty good when I first had it, last night it tasted a 
bit
funky, more acidic and was headless.  Perhaps it doesn't age well.


North Peak Brewing Co. Traverse City  (single strain)
I was singularly unimpressed with any of their offerings.  Oxidative off
flavors and diacetyl.  The darker brews were better, probably due to 
masking
the off flavors.  Tried their seasonal Cherry Blossom Wheat (Berliner 
style):
Something went terribly wrong!  I tasted no cherries, but it did taste 
like a
spoonful of butter had been mixed into my glass!  Is this what "Berliner
Style" means?  It tasted like 1056 in all their brews, with some flavor 
flaws.


Mackinaw Brewing Co. Traverse City  (single strain)
Marginally better than North Peak.  No serious flavor flaws, but not much
flavor either.  The Pig Stout (dry) was the beer I liked best followed by
their Beadles Best Bitter.


Traverse Brewing Co. Williamsburg (go figure)
A micro with a tasting room.  Free samples!  I wish I hadn't golfed all 
my
money away, and could have bought a bottle of each offering:  The samples
 came
from already opened bottles and the flavor suffered from being flat, 
and
somewhat oxidized.  The one that I had from a new bottle was very tasty- 
Their
flagship, Manitou Brand Amber Ale.  Didn't get a chance to sample their
Traverse Brewing Company Stout- none on hand.  I'll look for them on the
shelves (you should too, Steve!)  Sleeping Bear Brown Ale- Hard to tell 
from
the bottle dregs, but I don't really like this "style" anyway.  Old 
Mission
Lighthouse Ale- A good pale ale that I would like to be hopped heavier, 
but
that's why I homebrew.


So, to summarize,


Good (bordering on great-in order of preference)

Does anybody know to what percentage Nitrogen is soluble in a liquid, if

Nitrogen on draft wine systems because it does not go into solution and

Does anyone have any experience in pitching hops right off the vine? I 
realize that they contain lots of water and I will have to adjust my 
pitching rates accordingly. Why do we pick hops, go to great lengths to dry 
them and then re-hydrate them again in boiling wort?

My source is The Practical Brewer, published by the MBAA.  I believe
it's on-line somewhere.  There is the possibility that the beer only
lost 5 IBUs during fermentation, but that's unlikely.  There is also
the possibility that the error in measurement increases with increasing
absorption (these devices were designed to test beers like Bud with a 
whopping 12 IBUs!).  What's accuracy of that equipment, Louis?  Finally,
there is the possibility that the brewer added bitterness via isomerised
hop extract (as I noted in my original post).  Can you find out?

__________________________
Back to "nonsense":  The warnings are applied selectively to wines.Other
foods which contain much higher sulfite levels are NOT subject to warnings.
I wouldn't mind seeing blanket warnings at some specific level, but what I
(and a lot of other folks) object to is seeing a warning on a wine bottle
which will give somebody x amount of sulfite if he drinks half a bottle,
but not on a salad bar where he'll get (say) 3x amount of sulfite from the
lettuce in a typical salad.  Why do the warnings work this way?  Because
there are folks who really don't want you to drink alcohol, but they can't
get at you directly, so they use indirect ploys like "contains sulfites".
_____________________


Well, the reason there isn't a warning on salads is that the use of
sulfites is apparently BANNED outright for fresh fruits and vegetables so
no warning should be necessary...




The FDA estimates that one out of a hundred people are sulfite sensitive,
and that 5 percent of those who have asthma are also at risk of suffering
an adverse reaction to the substance. 




>From a 1996 FDA document: "Complicating matters, scientists have not
pinpointed the smallest concentration of sulfites needed to provoke a
reaction in a sensitive or allergic person. FDA requires food
manufacturers and processors to disclose the presence of sulfitiing agents
in concentrations of at least 10 parts per million, but the threshold may
be even lower. The assay used to detect the level of sulfites in food is
not sensitive enough to detect amounts less than 10 ppm  in all foods so
that's what the regulation has to be based on..." 


"When the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was ammended in 1958 to
regulate preservatives and other food additives, FDA considered sulfites
to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS). But, when FDA reevaluated their
safety and proposed to affirm the GRAS status of sulfiting agents in 1982,
the agency received neumerous reports from consumers and the medical
community regarding adverse health reactions. In response, FDA contracted
with the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB)
to examine the link between sulfites and reported health problems that
ranged from chest tightness or difficulty breathing to hives to fatal
anaphylactic shock."


"In 1985, FASEB concluded that sulfites are safe for most people, but pose
a hazard of unpredictable severity to asthmatics and to others who are
sensitive to these preservatives. Based on this report, FDA took the
following regulatory actions in 1986:


        Prohibited the use of sulfites to maintain color and crispness on
fruits and vegetables meant to be eaten raw (for instance, restaurant
salad bars or fresh produce in the supermarket).


        Required companies to list on product labels sulfiting agents that
occur at concentrations of 10ppm or higher, and any sulfiting agents that
had a technical or functional effect in food (for instance, as a
preservative) regardless of the amount present. (This labeling requirement
was extended to standardized foods, such as pickles and bottled lemon
juice, in 1993).


"FDA requires that the presence of sulfites be disclosed on labels of
packaged food (although manufacturers need not specify the particular
agent used). This information will be included in the ingredient portion
of the label, along with the function of the sulfiting agent in the food
(for instance, a preservative)."


"When food is sold unpackaged in bulk form (as with a barrel of dried
fruit or loose, raw shrimp at the fresh fish counter), store managers must
post a sign or some other type of labeling that lists the food's
ingredients on the container or at the counter so that consumers can
determine whether a product was treated with a sulfiting agent."




 ... So, if someone's getting a dose of sulfites from their trip to the
salad bar it's because someone is not obeying FDA regulations NOT because
the labelling laws are inconsistent in this case.


Why do wines have a sulfite label while other foods only have to
include sulfites in the ingredients list? My guess is this is because
wines as a rule don't have ingredient lists so to indicate the presence of
sulfites they have to include a specific notice.

Maybe in the old days, but not in the new days.  The first
question I asked in the cooper's shop at The Old Brewery
 - Tadcaster (Samuel Smith's) is "Are the casks line with
pitch?"  The answer was: "No... absolutely not... raw wood."
I'll just mention again, that Samuel Smith's OBB and Museum
Ale [RIP] tasted at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese in London (very
far from Tadcaster) had *no* oak character and I was LOOKING
for it.

That would be completely wrong for a Lambic.  Again, Lambic
is typically fermented in used wine casks which are unlined
and uncharred (although some can be toasted).

Mike Allred and Sam Mize contemplate on no-boil beers. Well, guys, it can
be done. It has been done. And, I have done it. In fact i'll go out on a
limb and say it was probably done that way for hundreds of years...in
ancient Sumaria.... But seriously folks, During Big Brew 98, the all
grainers decided to keep sparging and combine worts to make an additional
batch. Well, the sun went down and the brewers got hungry, and the extra
carboy of wort just stood there patiently waiting to be boiled. We decided
to flip a coin to see who would get to take it home to play with. Nobody
had any coins after we paid for dinner, which was OK since nobody wanted
the wort anyway. Since it was my carboy I stuffed a cheese cloth in it and
shoved it into the van.


Sunday came and went, so did Monday and Tuesday for that matter. Wed there
were signs of spontaneous fermentation going on. (how is that for a wort
test!) By Friday there was a 2" head on it. Eventually I found an airlock
for it. A week or so later I added 2 lbs of Liquid wheat malt extract in
hope this might turn out to be an American Lambic. When I finally racked my
Big Brew out of the primary, I pitched most of the yeast cake into
p-lambic, and took it down to the basement from the garage. (Far from my
brewing stuff).


Shopping at the local hardware store, I discovered they once sold homebrew
supplies. Among the old and dusty stuff were some hops. Packaged in a clear
plastic bag, the were listed only as Bullion Hops. The were well oxidized.
Almost brown in color. Those behind the label were more green than brown.
I'm guessing 4+ years old. Ever smell a half eaten bag of Cheeto's that's
been in the back window of black car for the month of July? That's what
these smelled like. Cheeeeezy!!  I took them home and waited for my wife to
be out of the house for few hours. I then boiled them is as little water as
possible. This didn't work so well so I moved up to a larger pot and boiled
that down to a smaller volume for about an hour or so. I then strained and
cooled the hop tea and added that to the American p-Lambic


So, all you Lambic-digest lurkers what do you think the odds of it being
drinkable are? My assumption is about 10%. So I only have a carboy and 7$
invested it, so its an experiment. What fun! Here are some questions. Is it
worth the outrageous price of pure cultures to insure that the right Brett
and Lacto got in there? How long before its "done"? Anybody want some???

I don't recall the details, but I call them as I see them.  I have nothing
to gain from discrediting you methods.  My intent it simply to warn
readers of potential problems.  It is part of the natural, honest flow of
brewing information that we call the Homebrew Digest.


I suspect that there was something you left out in your counterpressure
bottle-filling procedures that you do that prevents your beer from being
overcarbonated as anyone armed with Alan's charts can clearly see.


Wait... it's coming back to me (you see, in addition to the HBD, I also
answer 10 or 20 private questions every week... a practice I may have
to discontinue if it increases significantly).  In your procedure, you
said that you connect the CO2 and crank it up to something like 20psi.
We discussed this offline, didn't we?  You explained that you do not
keep the beer *AT* 20-something psi and 30-somthing degrees F for any
lenght of time.  This information was *OMITTED* from the original post.


As posted, it could be interpreted as I did... that the beer is allowed
to stabilise at that temperature and pressure.  This *would* result
in gushers... *guaranteed*.  I stand by that.

Please note that Robert says "will result in overcarbonation" (putting
these words in my mouth) where as I said "could give you more than 5
volumes..."  There is a BIG difference here.

I do not recall this warning and it certainly was not included in the
post to the HBD which explained the method.  As for the variables that
need to be respected, how about a little respect for the person who
pointed out these variables.  I never took any tone with you... I just
posted my warnings, politely.

Actually, this is where knowing the science would help you.  The pressure
need only be *equal* for the beer to flow via gravity into the gas line.

A check-valve will save your regulator the first time it happens, but can
eventually stick because the beer will dry in there and the residual sugars
will gum up the check-valve.  I'd also like to point out that check valves
cause a pressure drop and therefore the gas pressure on top of the beer
will be lower than the regulator is reading.  Incidenally, one person has
already posted that this has happened to them, so this is not as rare as
you might think.

I guess nobody bothered to tell you that advertisements on HBD are bad
nettiquette.  Many of us have things to sell, but we don't use the HBD
for free ads.


Most homebrewers don't understand kegging and counter-pressure bottle
filling.  Heck, most barowners don't understand draught systems!  Most 
homebrewers carbonate their beer by the seat-of-the-pants and most get
glasses full of foam at least 1/3 of the time (1/3 of the time the beer
is undercarbonated... the last 1/3 they got lucky).


Alan's tables, Dave Miller's article in the 1992 (I believe) AHA Conference
Proceedings, Ed Westemeier's article in Zymurgy a few years ago... *these*
are the keys to predictable, repeatable, consistent carbonation.  It doesn't
have to be hit-or-miss anymore.  You don't have to test the carbonation
level after x minutes or guess if your temperature is right.


I never said your methods would not work... I simply pointed out that there
was a *risk* of overcarbonation.  The fact is that there doesn't have to be.

Well, if you're going to wait 2 weeks to tap the keg, then you might as
well prime.  The benefit of forced carbonation is that it is quick. The 
other benefit of kegging is that it is easy to adjust the carbonation if
you get too much or too little.

I gotta agree with Jack on this one.

  Here's a question I've seen posted a couple of times, but have never seen
a good answer for.(I checked the archives also). I recently acquired a
magnetic stir plate, some stir bars, and 1000 &2000mL flasks among other
stuff (you can never have enough stuff!) Anyway, I've heard talk about using
stir plates for yeast starters, but no specifics on how effective it is and
any differences in technique from doing a "normal" starter.
  My normal starter ends up at about 1/2-2/3 of a gallon after being bumped
up twice from the original 2 cups or so, with just shaking and swirling a
few times a day. Then the whole thing goes into the batch (10 gal).
  My main questions are as follows, but feel free to tack on any additional
info as needed


1) Will I need to use as much volume, I.e.;can I eliminate the third day of
adding wort and start a day later with it and still be ok with the yeast
count?


2) Should the stir plate be left on for the duration of the starter? Also,
should it be on so that it just swirls the yeast, or high enough to really
mix it into a frenzy? (oops! two questions in one)


3) What is the best way to sanitize the stir bars? Can they be boiled, or
use Iodophor or bleach solution?




  Well, you get the idea (I hope)! Thanks in advance,

If there is no change in the hydrometer reading how do you know if you
