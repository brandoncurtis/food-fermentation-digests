To: Jack Schmidling        
     Are you telling us you never tried fresh, green hops
directly picked off the vine, and used in a batch of beer?
  Don't wait another minute!  Green hops seem to give enhanced
flavor to the beer, the heading is improved, too. 
 Once you try it, you'll wish you could use green hops all
year!  Make lots of beer while the hops are green!
  The weight of the hops is a lot heavier freshly picked, so
you will have to do some guess work to estimate how much to
use.  In hot weather, hops start to dry out on-the-vine,
so that also needs to be taken in consideration.
 Try it, you'll love it!

Subject: cleaning keg lines


I seem to have a recurring problem.  The beer in my kegs seem to pick up an
off flavor about 3-4 weeks after tapping, which I attribute to
dirty/contaminated keg lines (doesn't happen when I detach the the keg lines
after dispensing beer).  I am currently using the plastic cobra taps, in a
converted chest freezer.  What is the best way to clean and sanitize the
lines, so I don't have to keep on detaching the lines?

It depends on the method of drying.


If you dry in an oven you are relying on heat to remove the moisture from
the hops and in essence you are baking the hops.


I think the preferred method is to use a dehydrator. This method removes
the moisture by passing air over the hops. Of course the drier the air the
better. Most home dehydrators have a heating element in them to provide
warm air, which speeds up the drying.


By drying them in dehydrator you also maintain the hops color. The airflow
and gentle heat, usually around 115 degrees F., assure this.


If you do use an oven, cut the heat down and position a fan the air in the
oven so the air has a chance to move around.


The dehydrator I use is an American Harvest with 8 trays. I end up with 6-8
ounces of dried hops per 24 hour period.


Hope this helps,


Phil Rozanski

Subject: when lager


I am not an historian, but I've always associated the move to lager
beers with the industrial period.  Workers in hot sweaty environments
wanted a cool, refreshing quench-your-thrist type of drink "Its Miller
Time" rather than a sip-thru-the-evening flavored ale/stout as you hang
with your buddies in the pub.


Also, the industrial period meant that mechanical refrigeration and
ice-making was possible and the Great Lakes ice that Made Milwaukee
famous as a producer of lager beer, could be had in St. Louis,
Louisville, Cincinatti, et al. Imagine in the 1870's trying to brew
lager beer in climates like Kansas City, Missouri or Alanta and having
to compete with ice loaded boxcars of beer from Milwaukee.

Subject: No Sparge 1st attempt


I read an article recently in Brewing Techniques about conducting an all 
grain 
and omitting the sparge.  I then searched the hbd archives and found 
others who 
have done the no sparge and everyone who does it seems pleased with the 
results.   Different folks use different techniques and I'm going to try 
my own 
technique this Friday if my yeast arrives thru the mail in time.  I'm 
going to 
conduct a 15 gallon batch using two boilers.  My plan is to make the mash
 just 
a little thin by using 1.5 quarts of water per pound of grain.  I will 
have 42 
lbs of grain and 16 gallons of water in the mash tun.  Assuming 1 gallon 
of 
grain absorption per 10 lbs of grain I should be able to get about 12 
gallons 
of first runnings.  I'm hoping the gravity will be higher than my target 
so I 
can dilute with treated boiling water.  Before I dilute I will stir the 
first 
runnings in boiler number one and transfer over a calculated amount into 
boiler 
number 2.  The calculated amount is based upon the gravity and dilution 
needed. 
 I will then figure out how much more wort I need for boiler number two and
 add 
that + an extra 20% to the mash tun and no sparge once again.
I guess this second boiler could be called a modified small beer since it 
has 
some of the good stuff or maybe it should be called a medium beer.  I'm 
looking 
for any opinions or suggestions about my strategy.  I'll post my results 
when I 
get to taste my first bottle which shouldn't be too long since this is 
going to 
be an English Brown Ale.


Cheers!

I have used double decoctions for my Bock beers. I feel it does indeed make
for a better flavored -- richer/malter --  beer. (I won best of show with
this recipe in Memphis a couple of years back)


For me decoction mashing is the only way to do a multi-temp. mash; since i
have basically only an infusion mash system.


Yes it takes quite a bit more time, but i feel it is worth it for
traditional bocks and other lager beers.

In a message dated 98-09-08 04:08:01 EDT, you write:

 I believe hops are dried simply as a storage method.  Similar to
 making jerky or sun-dried tomatos.  Remove the water and there's less
 chance of molds and other contaminants getting hold.  
 
 SM >>


Another reason to dry hops is a beer recipe (using whole hops) assumes the
hops are dried.  Non-dried fresh hops have a certain amount of moisture in
them, so you would not be able to assume 1 ounce of green hops (undried) would
have the same amount of alpha-acids or flavour compounds as 1 ounce of dried
hops.  I do not know how much water is in green hops (comments anyone?).
Perhaps there is not enough to make a difference on small scale brewing.

Subject: Poly Clar


All -


Due to the relatively low traffic on the HBD of late, I'll ask a
question that has been gnawing at me for awhile . . .


I would like to fine my beers with Poly Clar (have heard it's one of the
more effective fining agents), so I bought some, rehydrated about 1
tablespoon of it in boiled, cooled water, and dumped it into a finished
APA that I had sitting in a carboy in my 70 or so degree basement.  I
swirled the carboy around once every few days to try to resuspend the
stuff, but the final bottled product was not that much different than my
un-fined beers.  Scratching my befuddled head, I reasoned that I had
missed an essential step somewhere in the process.  However, the
instructions on the Poly Clar container said only to "add to finished
beer"  Gee, thanks for the scoop.


Anyone know what I did wrong?  Should the beer be chilled to bring out
the chill haze before the Poly Clar is added?  Should the Poly Clar be
added to an empty carboy and the finished beer racked onto it?  Does
Poly Clar suck?  Any ideas on how to use this or any other fining agent
would be welcomed and appreciated.  BTW, the Poly Clar that I used was
white and had the consistency of confectioner's sugar (I've heard
there's 2 kinds of Poly Clar).  I don't have any affiliation with the
stuff; just trying to glean a little info . . .

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Phil Rozanski opines: "It depends on the method of drying."


Actually, it seems to have more to do with the SPEED of drying. I dry on a
rack in the basement using ambent air currents. Hops are to 1/4 moisture
by weight within a few days, but brown considerably in the process. A
dehydrator would dry those same hops in much less time and would brown 
much less. Same is true when "pressing" plant material for preservation: 
the FASTER you remove the moisture, the less color change you experience 
in the plant material. All else being equal, I don't think the oven 
vs the dehydrator should make much difference - except the increased 
airflow with the dehydrator. As has been said before, the key is airflow, 
not temperature. (And, allied with the airflow, the ability of that air 
to take up more moisture: humidity.)

Subject: Northern Wisconsin Report


Howdy Gang. I just got back (last night) from a great time in the Door
County area of Wisconsin. My wife and I went 'up Nort' to help shingle our
family's summer cottage. Weather was great for that kind of work. Anyway to
the point: after shingling for most of the daylight hours, my parents
announced that they wanted to take us to a brewpub in Door County.


Always up for a new thing, I said "Let's go." When we got there, I noticed
a nice ten barrel system behind glass, spotless. My mouth began to water
when I saw that they had six styles, four of which were exciting to me.
However, the excitement that I felt when we took off for the brewpub was
instantly lost when I saw how they served their beers: in plastic cups like
at a keg party. I paid $3.00 a cup for beer while a younger lad, but that
$3.00 also afforded me all-I-care-to-drink amounts of beer (i.e. I could
refill it as often as I wanted).


Is this standard practice now (to serve pub-brewed beer in plastic cups)?
The other brewpubs I have been to served their beers in glass. The real
irony is that this brewpub sold glassware that had the pub's name on it. I
am currently drafting a letter to this establishment to express my opinion
about their presentation, as well as other facets of the service there.


In other notes, I had the six beer sampler, which came in two-ounce shot
glasses. Their fruit beers were boring (very faint fruit taste), and their
porter tasted like a fine dry stout. Two positive things to say: all beers
were crystal clear, and free of taste defects (to my in-training palate).
And as a final note, my wife (Jamie) expressed to me that she really liked
fruit beers, especially the ones that have fruit taste. (Thank you, God.
One more beer bullet.)


On the way home, Jamie even charted a course that would take us through New
Glarus, Wisconsin. New Glarus is a brewery that really takes its fruit beer
brewing seriously. You may remember they won the gold medal in the fruit
beer category for their Belgian Red (cherries, cherries, cherries). I
believe their raspberry beer also won high praise at GABF, but I may be
wrong. New Glarus Brewing Company also produces a fine line of more
standard fare: a pils, a light lager, etc.


Others may have said it first, but New Glarus may have a triple crown in
the fruit beer category at this year's GABF. Belgian Red, Raspberry and
Apple Ale. You can decide for yourself which takes first, second and third.
They are all excellent. Bring your checkbook when buying New Glarus' fruit
beers however. $5-6 for a 750ml bottle. Worth every penny.

Well, I've got my own tip to share regarding hops storage.


When using a CO2 fire extinguisher to purge wide mouthed one-gallon glass jars
for hops storage, it's best to do so BEFORE you put the hops in the jar.


I'm still picking hops out of my teeth and hair.


And Marc- in my experience, eyelashes and eyebrows grow back, but slowly.

Subject: Triple decoction / in-line thermometer / Thanks!


     Hi all,
     
     Tom asks if a triple decoction is appropriate (and desirable) for 
     brewing at home.
     
     First, a quick review of what decoction brewing does:  it allows 
     sugars and amino acids to react to form melanoidins (which can give a 
     beer a deep, malty character).  This does not happen to a significant 
     degree in an infusion mash because the temperature never gets hot 
     enough.
     
     I decoction brew quite often, and gave up multiple decoctions about 
     1.5 years ago.  Why?
     
     I didn't think it was making enough of a flavor difference in the beer 
     to warrant the time, effort, and potentially damaging mash handling.  
     All that handling of the hot mash can put you at risk for hot-side 
     aeration and burning yourself.  A single decoction seems to work 
     adequately.
     
     Another tremendous factor in my decision to abandon multiple 
     decoctions was the damage done to both the body and head retention of 
     my beer because of the long protein rest(s) that are really hard to 
     avoid when doing a multiple decoction.  As I've said (many times), 
     modern malts are quite well-modified and do not rigorous mashing like 
     the continental malts of yesteryear.  Resting the main mash in the 
     proteoytic range for over 30 min. while decocting can harm your beer's 
     body and head.  Ouch!
     
     When doing a single decoction it is easy to get around the protein 
     rest:  simply mash-in at saccharification, rest, pull the decoction 
     and boil, then return it to hit 165-168F (73.8-75.6C).  At this 
     temperature alpha amylase will convert the starch that is liberated 
     during the decoction boil.  This adds little time to the brew day, 
     too.
     ---------------------------------
     Here is a neat trick that I have now used 3 times and therefore 
     declare a success:  a simple in-line thermometer to measure the 
     temperature of wort as it exits my counterflow chiller.
     
     I spent a while trying to find a thermometer with a stem that would 
     make a water-tight seal using a compression-T so that I could measure 
     wort temperature as it enters the fermenter.  After a little 
     searching, I dropped the idea and simply cut a slit in a piece of 
     tubing.  The slit is just big enough to allow the stem of my Taylor 
     pocket digital thermometer to fit in it.
     
     I boil the tube, put it on the end of my chiller, poke the thermometer 
     through the hole and let the wort run.  Voila!  Amazingly, it doesn't 
     leak after three uses!  Simple can be so good...

Paul Niebergall responds to George DePiro's comments about ancient beers as ...


>I have never
>experienced *phenolic, sour, etc.* flavors in any of my decocted brews.


George was referring to phenolic off flavors due to infection and dextrinous or
starchy worts due to lack of ability to measure and control temperature and not
due to the decoction process per se.  A thermometer and the improved sanitation
and yeast handling practices have improved homebrew re these problems - however
infection and resulting off-flavors continues to loom large on the list of
threats to good homebrew - and commercial brewing as well.


As for the statement, ".  I have never experienced *phenolic[...]* flavors in
any of my decocted brews".   I think this needs to be reconsidered.  If you
have no phenolic flavors you really don't have beer - it's more like a Zima
clone.


Phenolics get a 'bad wrap' in every venue on brewing, and certainly the bad
side of phenolic flavors can be very bad indeed.  What the statement above (and
I'm not picking on Paul here) and other similar absolutist statements about
phenolics ignore is that normal levels of phenolic compounds are VERY IMPORTANT
to normal beer flavor profile.  A beer stripped of phenolics will taste simple
and insipid.  Unoxidized phenolic compounds also impart an important 'flavor'
of freshness and briskness  to beer and other drinks (wine, tea).  My recent
experience and experiments with sparge versus no-sparge and the use of malted
'feed' barley for brewing, and the dilution of the resulting beer has just
reinforced my conviction that all beer relies on balanced levels of phenolics
for many of the positive flavor elements - also that in excess the positive
contributions of these smaller and unoxidized phenolic compounds can quickly
become dominant and negative - much faster than say negative aspects of
excessive hops or melanoidins.


A while back I made a CAP using homemade malt from feed barley.  As I reported
the beer had a decidedly off flavor component that might be called husk-like or
perhaps straw-like.  This component faded fast on dilution 1:1 with another
more normal beer - making a rather acceptable drink.  More recently I created a
no-sparge and a sparge-only (small) beers - same mash, same yeast, different
hopping - both are quite acceptable on their own . The obvious difference in
flavor is quite apparently due to the same component that appeared in the
feed-barley malt beer - namely added phenolic content.


It isn't really beer without background phenolics, tho' it certainly isn't good
beer with excess phenolics either.

Mort points out some great historical references and provides notes - but
mostly he makes me envy his libraries full collection of JIB.  Mine stops

resident renaissance man (brewer, baker, biologist, historian, and isn't there

interesting insights into lager development/history.


Incidentally I also found some answers to the historical questions I recently
posed in a little gem of a book, "Beer: Tap into the Art and Science of
Brewing", by Charles Bamforth.1998 Plenum Press.  The intended audience for the
book is, I believe, the non-brewing beer geek/science geek, and it's certainly
not a how-to book, but it contains many tidbits on the science and practice of
brewing that won't be lost on the HBD audience either.  Fun to read and well
written, with some great insights on history as well as science (Answers the
burning question - why did the US Air Force fund the development of the metal

AJ posts on mineral levels in malt, esp zinc levels and the results surprise me
a bit - in that free zinc levels in malt are so high.  He states ...

I think it would be extremely interesting.  I have read in several sources that
zinc and certain other metals Cu and Mn from memory) are so effectively removed
from wort, bound to the break material that wort can be deficient in these
critical yeast enzyme cofactors regardless of the apparent high levels in the
kettle.  I know that adding 0.5ppm of zinc to my fermenter has a noticeable
positive effect on fermentation (and makes good use of the 'zinc as common cold
cure' scam tablets of a few years ago which still appear in the pharmacy
shelves).

Subject: 19th Century beers


I've found the discussions lately of 19th Century brewing in US
quite interesting.
I enjoyed the history section of the new style book Altbier, 
which describes the "lager revolution" from an angle that was
new to me.


Basically,  people (at least in Bavaria) had been trying to
"brew lagers" for hundreds of years. They realized that fermenting
and aging in cool caves made better beer than warm areas.
Brew laws like the purity law and a later law which prohibited
brewing in the summer, led to better beer. In the days before
yeast cultures, all these methods were leading people to making
lagers, primarily by selecting for cool fermenting yeasts.
Naturally people would perfer the cleaner tasting lagers to the
ales back then, which no doubt quickly went sour and were
flavored with all kinds of root and herbs.


Mid 19th century was, of course, when new yeast research
started to show brewers how to make lagers in other areas of
the world. Refridgeration quickly followed.

Subject: Storing grain


There has been some discussion lately about how to store grain so I thought
I would contribute my method.  It is similar to that offered by Gregg Howard
but instead of using icing buckets I use five gallon liquid malt extract
buckets retrieved from my local homebrew shop.  They get malt extract in them
and empty them into large drums.  They throw the buckets away and I picked
some up.  I had to clean the buckets out but that was simple using hot water.
I have even used the extract recovered to make starters.  I am cheap.  The
buckets I got have a screw on cap on the lid which makes it easy to pour grain
out.  I remove the lid to fill the buckets but just remove the screw on cap to
use the grain.  I also use these buckets for sanitizer, collecting chilled
wort if not going directly to the fermenter, or anything else a bucket is good
for.  I label the buckets containing grain with a strip of masking tape with
the grain description written on it.  A 25 kilo bag of grain is about two
buckets and one batch of beer, or two and a partial bucket.


Another thing about these buckets is that the lid is hard to remove but I found
a plastic tool at Home Depot intended for removing paint bucket lids that
works well.  If left out in the cold these tools will get brittle and break but
if warmed up before using are fine.


I don't know if these buckets are common elsewhere but anyone interested might
call their local homebrew shop, if there is one, and ask.

I'm guessing that this is the problem. After observing this yeast more closely
than I have in the past, I've noticed that the yeast (#1338, European Ale)
tends to flocc nicely and hard (i.e. it's not "fluffy" on the bottom of the
fermenter, it packs itself down hard). I'm guessing this would also explain why
others (and I) have noticed that #1338 tends to keep fermenting forever. Most
of the yeast floccs out and the rest keeps sloooowly chugging away.


This is one of the coolest things about homebrewing: getting to toy with
various yeasts and see how they react quite differently and give quite
different flavors/aromas.

Subject: Parti-Gyle and Batch Sparging


I am planning my first parti-gyle brewing experience this weekend and have
a few questions for those more experienced with this process than I (anyone
who has done this before). I am basically struggling to cross the
parti-gyle process with my batch sparge process.


Just as a little background, I am planning to brew the Big Brew '98
Barleywine recipe (from Rob Moline's/Jethro Gump's recipe) and wanted to
make a second small beer from the second runnings. I am planning to use the
article in the July/August issue of BrewingTechniques as a guide for the
recipe for the second small beer.


Since I batch sparge (add all the sparge water at once, rather than
trickling it over the length of the mash), my questions revolves around
when do you add your second batch of sparge water to the mash? 


(1) Would you add the second batch of sparge water while your first brew is
boiling (and leave the mash to rest at approx 170F during that 60-90
minutes) or do you (2) shorten the time during which the mash "rests" with
the second sparge water (possibly waiting until the first beer is finished
boiling)?


Arguing both sides:
1) If I add the second batch of sparge water right after beginning the boil
on the first beer, I am concerned that the mash sitting in 170F water for
60-90 minutes will leech out tannins/other bad stuff from the malt.


2) If I wait until later in the process to add my second batch of sparge
water, I am concerned that the mash will begin to get lactic or otherwise
spoil while sitting (and cooling) after drawing off the first batch of
sparge water.


I understand that this is a strange combination of two processes (batch
sparging and parti-gyle brewing), but I really don't want to waste all them
good sugars left over from the barleywine.


Thanks in advance,

Subject: Rice Beer/Sake


I have recently started experimenting with rice brews and would like to post
some ideas and results.


Brewing with rice is markedly different than brewing with other grains.


The biggest difference is that rice is not mashed to convert the starches to
sugars. Instead, the mold aspergillus oryzae is inoculated into a rice base
that is added to the rice to be brewed. This mold creates an enzyme that
converts the starches to sugar that is then fermented by the yeast. This
inoculated rice is called koji.


The process sounds difficult, but I have found it to be very easy in practice.


This whole process is also the process that is used in the brewing of sake.
Sake is often referred to as a rice wine, but since it is brewed from a
grain (rice), it is technically a beer. 


I have not yet tried to brew sake, but I am sure it is in the near future.
Sake brewing follows the same basic process that I will outline, so it is
not at all difficult. Probably the biggest hurdle to overcome is finding a
source for the proper rice that is highly polished (50-60%). Most
commercially available rice in the United States is only polished to about 90%.


However, it is still possible to brew good homebrewed rice beer.


Koji is readily available from oriental grocery stores and not expensive.


Here is my basic rice beer procedure:


     Ingredients:


                    4 lbs short grain white rice
                    20 oz koji
                    1 fresh lemon or lime
                    20 oz liquid beer yeast


     Equipment:     Rice/vegetable steamer
                    4-5 gallon plastic container (food grade)
                    Large stirring spoon
                    Large container for washing rice


Procedure:


               Wash the 4 lbs of rice in cold water. Rinse repeatedly until
the water is clear.


               Soak the rice in water for 12-18 hours. Store in the
refrigerator for this period of time.


               After 12-18 hours, drain off the excess water. Steam the rice
for 1 to 1.5 hours.


               After steaming is completed, place the hot rice in the
food-grade container. Add 3-4 gallons of cold water and mix
throughly. Add the 20 oz of koji and mix again.


               Check the temperature of the mash. If below 90 degrees F.,
add the yeast and mix again. 


               Add the juice of the fresh lemon or lime.


               Cover the container and keep at room temperature. Stir the
mash twice each day.  


               Once fermentation begins, much of the rice will appear to
float on the surface. This is normal. There will also be a
distinictive oder that is also normal.  


               In about 7-8 days, active fermentation will appear to have
ceased. Keep the container covered for an additional 24-36                hours.


               Prepare a suitable number of bottles and caps. Rack the brew
to a bottling bucket and proceede with nomal bottling                processes. 


               The beer is ready to drink at time of bottling. The brew may
have a distintive milky appearance, but this will settle out
within 24-48 hours, particularly with refrigeration.


Rice beer is typically a stillbrew, but it is possible to carbonate the brew
is desired. It is also possible to dramatically increase the alcohol content
from about 5 or 6% by volume to 18-21% by volume!

Yes, as the responsdent said, drying is to facilitate storage, however,
there is another point to consider.  Dried hops, just like (other) dried
herbs have more flavor per weight (getting rid of that pesky water you
know).  You'll want to up the amount you use, from what you would've
dried.  How much?   I don't know, but since you probably don't know the
acid levels that exactly, or a precise utilization, don't worry about it
too much...just some more.  Relax and try it.    Its always worked well
