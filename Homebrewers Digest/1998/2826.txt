Subject: Enzyme temperature dependence. Phosphate cleaners, Clinitest (X2) Unibroue skunk


Brewsters:


Jenny and Peter Stockham ask about why the barley malt enzymes
have an apparent optimum at 70 degrees C when in nature, seeds
never experience these temperatures. Ignoring the fact that this
optimum is different for various enzymes and that the optimum
represents a competition between rate of reaction and rate of
denaturization,  I suspect the answer lies in the fact that the
enzymes' rates of reaction are this high so that they can have a
reactivity at 10C ( soil temperature) on the order of days, which
represent the normal cell growth rate time scale.  Using the rule of
thumb known to all chemists that a reaction rate drops by a factor
of two for every decrease of 10 degrees C we see: e.g. 1 hour at 70C
would take 2 hours at 60, 4 hours at 50, 8 hours at 40, 16 hours at
30, 32 hours at 20 and 64 hours ( 2 1/2 days) at 10 C.
That's my guess.
- -------------------------------------
Jeremy Bergsman asks about phosphate cleaners ( e.g. TSP) and
if they do more than increase the pH, like lye and bleach.


Yes, Phosphate cleaners ( called "builders" in the detergent trade)
do increase the pH and they also provide anions ( various phosphate
ions) to adsorb onto dirt particles, esp clays. These dirt particles
become anionically charged and are more easily dispersed,
since they repel each other and provide the opportunity for the
water molecule dipoles to surround the particle and prevent
re-precipitation. At high calcium concentration and lower pHs
I suppose it is possible that various calcium salts could
precipitate, although this is not a real problem in the cleaning
world if sufficient phosphate cleaner is used, to my knowledge.


Note also that these phosphate cleaners are not much good
at dispersing a lot of oils and the like by themselves, but the
pH building ( i.e. increasing) helps the organic detergents -
which dissolve their oily heads in the oils and greases to work
efficiently by keeping their carboxylic or sulfonate tails ionic.

Greg, this is the classic case for the use of Clinitest that amateur
brewers often ( and not often professional brewers) face . You
are trying a new recipe, you have added adjuncts and you mashed
at a temperature clearly outside your experience and outside
most recommendations.  Most of all the mash temperature varied.
You don't have a clue what the FG should be. Under these
circumstances a hydrometer is nearly useless.


What can you do to keep from bottling bombs?


Go to your pharmacy and purchase ( you may have to special
order - three days usually) a Clinitest KIT ( NOT the Clinitest STIX).
This will allow you to determine the amount of fermentable sugar
in your beer. If you get more than a reading of <1/4% glucose,
[using drops of beer not your urine 8^) ]  your fermentation is not
finished and you should not bottle.  




If you get a reading higher than <1/4%, chances are the low FAN
due to the adjunct addition, early racking and the like reduced
the yeast population and slowed or stuck the fermentation.
Check it for a couple of days with Clinitest again and if the
fermentable sugar is not decreasing steadily ( you may not see
activity in the air lock for a while, since you racked), then you
should develop a plan for adding a new yeast starter and perhaps
some yeast nutrients.


Let us know how it turns out
- ---------------------------
Dan Cole asks about orange lights being used at Unibroue
to brew their new Pils.  They claim this allows them to use
clear bottles.


Well, it is true that green/blue/UV light is the optimum skunking
wavelength and orange light may work in the brewery, but not in the
commercial world where, as AlK claims - fluorescent lights in
a display case will skunk beers.


Unibroue, being pretty smart, probably uses isomerized hop
extracts like Miller Brewing, so they can get away with clear bottles
for marketing and not be worried about skunking.
- -----------------------------------------
SteveA says:


> fails to explain the correlation of higher Clinitest
>readings with stronger and more dextrinous commercial
beers or my strong ale.
>Obviously more data would be needed for me to support
this correlation fully
>too.


I guess I missed how you determined how dextrinous these
beers were - other than tasting. I do not believe tasting
is a sufficient method to distinguish dextrin content from low
sugar level content - do you? In the absence of knowing what
the Clinitest result was at the end of the fermentation, your
strong ale information could be easily explained if the higher
alcohol content caused premature flocculation and your
carbonation did not complete fully -as I noted before.


Let's limit this discussion to what I have been observing for a few
decades. Clinitest is a useful asset to home brewers for
determining the end of the fermentation.  I have never said
anything about using it for determing the dextrin content of
beers or being used on commercial or other bottled beers.


As you say:


> What is in question is Clinitest result interpretation as regards
>the completion of fermentation.


I agree that this should be the only subject of discussion and that
Clinitest results should be applied under these circumstances to
answer this question only at the end of the fermentation - not on
bottled beer and in other areas, as a supposed test of my
observation.


Please, when you repeat your various fermentations, check
the % glucose and see if all of your beers that are properly
fermented dry do not show <1/4% glucose at the end of the
fermentation.  Then check the Clinitest results of the bottled
beers. Chances are, if you did not use an actively fermenting
primer AND you used glucose for a primer, the bottled beer
results will be higher % glucose than the finished beer.


This experiment will go a ways towards proving if high
alcohol beers have higher than <1/4% Clinitest finishes,
as you contend, or not. I normally operate at OG  = 1.065 - 1.070
(would you call this a strong ale?) - but have gone to higher
OGs on numerous occasions and made the same observation
that a properly finished beer ( i.e. rousing, dropping, correct
yeast for the higher gravities, etc.)  finishes at <1/4% glucose
Lagered beers, with true lager yeast, finish at 0% glucose,
in many cases, despite the fact that in some cases they were
mashed at 158F and were highly dextrinous beers.


This does not square with your contention.


I'll look forward to your and others' results.

Subject: Dry Hopping at Cold Temps


I just don't have the patience I need to be a good brewer. I want to drink 
the beer now!


My last batch of pale ale was a week in primary and 10 days in secondary 
with an ounce of EKG. Had a very pleasant hop aroma/flavor. Well this time I 
kegged it after only 4 days on the EKGs and I have almost no hop aroma 
(otherwise brewed exactly same, even same batch of hops). So I stuck another 
ounce of hops in a boiled muslin bag and stuffed the whole thing in the keg 
on top of the beer.


Question is, will the hop aromas be extracted more slowly at 40F in the 
fridge than they would at 70F in my basement? Ie, should I remove the keg 
and bring it up to room temp for faster flavor enhancement?

Last year (and hopefully this year), Sierra Nevada made a beer with
fresh hops called (I think) harvest ale. Probably only available on draft
locally. I'm not sure, but I think they used green hops, and I know the 
beer was great.


Also of interest to hopheads, I just tried a beer from Bear Republic
(in Headsburg, CA) called XP. Great cascade hop aroma, flavor and
bitterness, in the vein of Sierra Nevada. Give it a try...

I used this yeast on a second runnings mild (oh the perils of parti-gyle 
brewing, what a long day *that* was). This wort started at 1.032 (a really 
mild mild). I created a two quart starter from the RTP vial. The whole 
primary seemed to be over in about 3 days which didn't surprise me. I 
sniffed the beer at day 5 and it stinked to high heaven of diacetyl. I've 
become very sensitive to that odor/flavor due to a problem I'm having with 
too much of it in about every other beer I've been making for the last 6 months.


Anyway, a little birdie (named Brian) told me that this yeast is notorious 
for producing diacetyl. Another little birdie (named Terry) said I should 
just leave the beer on the yeast for awhile to see if it would re-absorb it. 
So that's what I'm doing. But for how long? And should I rouse the yeast 
periodically? Its still in the primary for now. 


Would it make sense to pitch another yeast on top of it (another strain like 
1056) to try and have the new yeast absorb some of that diacetyl? I have 
about 16 oz of Wyeast 2206 and a full quart of W-1056 slurry available.

From: Jeremy Price <pricejy`at`email.uc.edu>
Subject:  RE: Why do mash enzymes work and chemistry of head retention




Jenny and peter Stockham brought up a good point about mash temperature and
the temperature that the amylases are active in nature. Clearly grain does
not germinate and sprout at 65 deg C. The Lowest temperature we brewers
mash at is 65 deg C. So what's the deal?


Raising the temperature in many enzyme driven reactions will increase the
rate at which the reaction occurs. This is true until the temperature
causes a conformational change in the 3-D structure of the protein. (all
enzymes are proteins) pH also affects the 3-D structure of proteins, which
is another reason pH of the mash is important. When the structure of the
protein is changed, the enzyme can no longer catalyze the reaction.   Some
enzymes are very heat stable, others denature at lower temperatures.
Amylases seem to tolerate temperature better than most enzymes, however at
these higher temps, the do begin to break down in a matter of hours.




Amylases are active at lower temps, but the rate of the reaction is MUCH
slower. For a small seed this is not a problem, but obviously for brewers
the rate would be to slow to get full starch conversion.


As far as an evolutionary reason that amylases are "temperature stable"
here it goes. Plants do not regulate their own temperatures, they are
subjected to drastic temperature changes from day to night. It only makes
sense that plant proteins may be a bit more stable. This is just a 
thought

I can't answer the bio' side of this, but "orange" strikes me as curious
from a light stand point.  I question the advantage orange wavelength
would have over more red.  Is the point to remove bluer wavelengths? 
Have they decided that's what skunks beer?  So the orange protects it
during packaging;  what about distribution and sale?  Do they warn
customers to store it in orange light?   Sounds like marketing to me.

I read your post this morning and thought, wow, perfect timing. I was
planning on posting this evening about the GABF and the Falling Rock.


I am planning to be at the GABF as well. Some of you may remember that
last year I suggested that any HBD'rs going to the GABF try to get
together, meet each other, and have a few beers. Brian Rezac picked up
the idea and arranged with Chris Black, owner of the Falling Rock, to
host a sort of home away from home for the HBD in the downstairs cigar
room at the Rock. It was a very comfortable place, couches and easy
chairs, privacy, real nice. We had some great times, I particularly
enjoyed getting to meet Ken Schwartz, and Jethro's alter ego, Rob
Moline. And Brian Rezac is a great guy, as he's proving again for sure!


I say that because it looks like we are going to be able to do it again!
Brian talked with Chris and he is willing to offer his place to us
again. I'm sure Brian will be posting in the near future as details are
firmed up. Right now it looks like the time will be Saturday night.
Brian has already talked to the folks at LeftHand Brewing and they are
going to be donating a keg of their Sawtooth Ale for our pleasure, and
Brian is still working on some other breweries   So I hope to see as
many of you as possible there. It's really nice to be able to put faces
with the names we've come to know through the digest. It's truly amazing
what a great group we are, and this is a great chance to get to know
each other better, not to mention maybe share some homebrews.


I'd like to hear from any of you planning to go. It would be great to
arrange a time to meet during the festival and sample some of the
incredible beers that will be available. The GABF arranges some small
groups led by some notables of the beer world to focus on different
styles or  whatever is of special interest .  I think you led one last
year Rob, would you be willing to do that again for an HBD group?


Hope to see you soon,

Subject: Alt malts,attenuation


I must say that I've enjoyed the recent thread on alts and have learned
a lot.  First, let me second the excellent recommendation from Al K to
use munich malt as a base, particularly if you like dry maltiness which
I prefer to a caramelly-sweet malt profile.  Second, you can brew a dry,
crisp, malty alt without getting to the 78-80% apparent attenuation
recommended by some -  if you use munich malts as your base and hop
aggressively.  My last batch (my best so far) had an OG of 1.050 and an
FG of 1.014 for only about 72% AA but came out very dry and malty due, I
believe, to the use of DWC munich as the base malt.  The relatively low
attenuation contributed to a nice full-bodied beer.  Just my $0.02
worth...

IBU's for Duvel and/or have any tips to making this classic? Yeast ideas
are also appreciated.

Subject: Decoction mashers: check my decoction. (please)


Hi all.


Here In Australia, the malts are modified to the point of stupidity, so
anything involving extended protein rests is tantamount to putting your
wort in a guilottine.


I was thus going to try the following schedule for my upcoming alt.
Times and temps as follows


23litre Alt
3.5kg L.Munich (5L/13EBC) malt (higly mod)
1 kg Pale malt (2L/5EBC) high mod
500g Wheat malt (5EBC)
50 g Choclate
250 g 280EBC Crystal


O.G 1.048~
30 Minutes 60C (140f)
Pull decoct at mash in raise to 70C hold 10 minutes then to boil and
hold for 10 minutes. Return to main mash
30 Minutes 70C (159f)
At 45 minute mark pull second thin decoction, boil for 10 and return.


Raise to 75C (168f) and continue as normal.


My main question is will these rest times give satisfactory emulation of
say a 66C(152F) rest at 1 hour??
Criticisms of grain bill/times/method/personal odor welcome!!!

A question for the collective;


I am interested in brewing a Christmas Ale.  I recently read an article in
BYO in which the author indicates that he brews his Christmas brews in
May (in order for all of the spice additions to mellow and blend).  Is it to
late in the year to brew a Christmas type ale?  If it's not to late, then does
anyone have a really, really good extract recipe to share (speciality
grains ok)?  If it is to late, does anyone have any recommendations for a
substitute (a recipe would again be appreciated)?  Private email
welcomed of course, but if you have the mother of all holiday brew
recipes, I read the Digest every day so I will see it there as well.

Subject: Sparge Water Temperature


Hi all,


Jack recommends using very hot sparge water to keep the grain in the
lauter tun at the proper temperature.  There is a problem with this idea.
Pouring nearly boiling water onto the grain bed will cause localized
heating at the top of the tun.  This can lead to both excessive tannin
and starch extraction from the grains.  If you do not acidify your sparge
water (and it has medium to high residual alkalinity) tannin extraction
will be worse.


My grain bed is always down around 158F (70C) by the end of the sparge.
I'd rather have it there than too high.  Starchy, astringent beer is not 
my goal.


Jack does mention that the sparge water loses quite a bit of heat in the 
transfer
from hot liquor tank to lauter tun.  It could be that his sparge water 
is not as hot as
his post implied, which could explain why he doesn't perceive problems 
with his
technique.  It would be best to measure the temp of your sparge water as 
it enters
the tun.  You may find it quite a bit cooler than you thought, especially
 if using
a pump, long plumbing, and/or a sparge arm.


Have fun!

Subject: Re: Alts and Sticke


Jeremy's post on Alt was certainly an interesting malt bill.  Bills 
that focus on pils malt such as this one are probably from the larger 
Alt brewers and not the small hausbraueries in the Altstadt that we 
craft brewers strive to create.  Some even use color beer to adjust 
the final color, this is concentrated dark beer.


To brew a sticke, I would suggest an OG of 12.5-13P, all Munich malts 
and 40-45 BUs of Hallertau/Spalt/Tettnang.  Dry hop or finish hop 
with 1/2 oz of similar hops.  I have never been at the Altstadt when 
a sticke was being served so this is a summary from what Jackson has 
written.


Drinking alts in the Altstadt is one of the finer beer drinking 
experiences one can have.  Then again so is drinking local 
specialities in Munich, Franconia, Brugge, Beersel and London.


Prost!

        George de Piro on the subject of TSP, comments about the laws governing it 
and "...Some environmentalist nonsense about algae blooms..." as being the 
reason for the law.  This is hardly environmentalist nonsense, but rather 
limnological fact that phosphate based detergents historically have  caused 
significant algal blooms in rivers and lakes.  The book "The Algal Bowl" is 
a good read on this subject.  Phosphate is a limiting nutrient in many 
oligotrophic (low productive) lakes and a small increase can cause profound 
changes to the ecology of the lake.  The die-off of algae and macrophytic 
plants and subsequent rot in the fall and winter can result in very low 
oxygen and signficant die-off of fish.  I'm not that "up" on the subject, 
but I believe there were some changes to laws governing the composition of 
laundry detergents and such.

I just wanted to point out that Weyermann also makes a light and dark
Munich (as well as a Vienna!) malt and a dark wheat malt.  Also, it's
important to remember that very few Dunkelweizens in Germany have any
roasty character at all (I tasted a good dozen Dunkelweizens and only
one or two had a noticeable roasty character).  Finally, the traditional
way to make a Dunkelweizen is not with dark wheat malt, but rather
pale wheat malt and Munich malt.  Most Dunkelweizens really taste like
a cross between a Weizen and a Munchner Dunkel (traditionally made with
100% Munich malt).


All the pieces fit together nicely, don't they?

Actually, the article went on to say that the bottles were being shipped in
a unique bottle carrier that was light-tight. It went on to say, if the
bottles weren't mishandled in bars (pulled out of the case and put into a
bucket of ice under flourescent lights), when the customer opened the
6-pack carrier would be the first time that it saw "real" light.

I seriously doubt this. Unibroue is quickly becoming a very respected brand

have no affiliation, nor have I had the pleasure of tasting any of their
products).

Primary fermenation should be low for an ale, low 50's will work with
these yeasts.  Lagering is like any lager, as cold as you can go and not
freeze the beer.  My alts lager at around 36oF-40oF depending on which
fridge I put them in; can't get much lower on these.  With 60's for
primary and 50's for lagering I've found they are too ale like to be
true alts.  And yes, I have been there.

Actually, I too spent the better part of a day with the brewmaster at
Zum Uerige and when I asked him about the grain bill he said (in
German, of course), that they use mostly Dunkel malt with a very tiny bit
of very dark malt (I seem to recall him holding his thumb and index
finger just a centimeter apart when telling me this).


As for filtration, I witnessed the bottling of Zum Uerige: they only
centrifuge the beer... they do not filter it.


Finally, I don't consider 75-78% Apparent Attenuation "fairly high."
I hope you all didn't think that I meant 50% attenuation like the
original Salvator Doppelbock!  I know that I've written 70-80% in the
past, which is probably wider than I would have liked to write.


I would tend to agree that 75-78% is right for Altbiers and would
consider the 80 to 85% that some American Light Lagers get to be
"high" and out-of-place in an Altbier.  Some "Malt Liquors" have
92% apparent attenuation and Miller Lite actually blows up most
AA formulae (it has an FG of 0.996, I believe).


My contention was that 80% apparent attenuation was too high for
Zum Uerige and even your calculations seem to bear that out.  While
it may be a minor point, I do believe that 75-78% is significanly
different than the 80% Piendl reported.


>As for malty finish, mouthfeel and ADA I will once again point out

I guess I'm guilty of that mode of thinking... it's difficult to
not associate attenuation with mouthfeel.


Just for laughs, I looked up my best Altbier batch in my logbook.
It held up very favourably in a side-by-side taste test with a
bottle of Zum Uerige that I brought back with me.  It was made
with Wyeast #1338 European Ale (which Wyeast lists as 67-72%
apparent attenuation) and was a nice, clean fermentation and the
beer did not overcarbonate even in the bottles that lasted a year
in the back of the crawlspace.  OG was 1.053 (yes, a touch high)
and FG was 1.012...


 ...apparent attenuation: 77%


I believe that Jim and I are in agreement although I can see how
my previous statements could be interpreted as if I thought Piendl's
data was off by 10 or 20 percentage points.  I didn't mean to imply
that.


I'm deeply sorry.  I'm arranging weekly meetings with several
members of the clergy in an effort to help me prevent this from
occuring again.  Although I have instructed my attorneys to mount
a vigorous defense against Mr. Busch's accusations, this should not
be interpreted as if I do not admit having made a mistake that I
deeply regret.

Careful... if you used a wine yeast and had a very high OG (like 1.140
or 1.150), your wine yeast could have pooped-out from the alcohol and
the relatively more alcohol-tolerant S. Bayanus (like Pasteur Champagne
or Wyeast Dry Mead) could lead to overcarbonation.


Personally, I don't ask the yeast to carbonate the mead for me... they
have already done enough!  When I do make the odd sparkling mead, I
force-carbonate it and bottle that.  Typically, I'll use 2L PET bottles
and Carbonater(tm) caps.  I overcarbonate it by a few tenths of a volume,
chill to 35F and then pour gently into cool bottles.

The history of the test upon which Clinitest is not at issue here.
What is at issue is the fact that some recipes will lead to dextrin
levels which result in Clinitest readings of greater than 1/4%.


Also, please note that Clinitest was developed for testing urine
glucose and that the application you propose is to test a mixture of
many, many various sugars, some of which have reducing ends and
some that do not.  The use of Clinitest on beer certainly does not
have a century of history.


>I have always recommended Clinitest as a method of indicating that the
>fermentation was finished when the glucose level was <1/4%.


I have said many times in the past (a fact that you seem to repeatedly
ignore!) that the glucose in the wort will be consumed *first* and
there is a lot of fermentation that goes on long after all the glucose
is long gone.  Furthermore, if you would read Steve Alexander's post
again (see http://www.brewinfo.com/brewinfo/articles/clinitest.html),
you will note that he does *not* say that Clinitest is useless (nor
do I) but rather that:


        1. readings at or below 1/4% are a sure indication that
        fermentation is complete.


        2. readings of 2% or greater are a sure indication that
        fermentation is NOT complete.


And here's the part that you *repeatedly* ignore, Dave:


        3. readings between 1/4% and 2% mean fermentation may or
        may not be complete...  knowing which requires an understanding
        of the fermentability of your wort.




My entire reason for opposing your posts about the "ease of Clinitest"
is because I foresee some beginner homebrewer making an Old Ale or
perhaps Jethro's Big 10/20 Barleywine and doing weekly Clinitests
that keep reading 3/4%... thinking "Dave said to wait for 1/4% to
bottle."


THAT'S MY MAIN POINT!!!
