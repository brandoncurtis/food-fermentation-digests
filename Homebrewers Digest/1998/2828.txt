Yes... *now* they are made in a variety of ways... heck, I'll bet you
can find one that's made with a dollop of EBC900 syrup!  I'm talking
about beers made from Munich and pale wheat malts.  From my tasting, that's
how I feel the beers, that (in my opinion) were from the most traditional
breweries (like Augustiner), were made.

Indeed... too much caramel flavour.  In my opinion, the ones that are
above 13L or so generally were outliers (had roasty flavours, for example).
Many people think Munchner Dunkel and Dunkelweizen are *dark* beers... 
on the order of a Pete's Wicked Ale.  Most are not.  Most are *amber*...
many Dunkelweizens are no darker than Bass Ale (10L).  Ayinger Altbairisch
Dunkel is uncommonly dark and chocolatey for a Munchner Dunkel when you
compare it to Lowenbrau, Spaten, Augustiner, Hacker-Pschorr, Kloster
Andechs Andechser Dunkel, Paulaner...


My Munchner Dunkel (a dead ringer for Augustiner Dunkel) was panned at
the AHA Nationals second round this year for not having enough "chocolate
malt flavour."  AAAAAARGH!!!  Please remember why Dunkels were brown...
because Munich water was too alkaline to brew with paler malt until
they learned how to modify water chemistry.

I suspect that it's a relatively new malt.  I have contacts in a German
maltster (Weyermann) and I could ask how long dark wheat has been made.
Now just to find the email address... I used to correspond with them
via fax, but the last one was unanswered and I've seen an email address

When I first started all-grain brewing, the last runnings from my lauter-tun
were coming out at around 130 F.  I have no idea what the mash temperature
was, but it couldn't have been much higher than that.  My beer turned out
really fine.  In fact, even though I now have an insulated system that keeps
the temps around 150 F or slightly below, I came to the conclusion that low
sparge temps don't hurt a thing.  The only issue is the risk of a stuck
sparge.  I nearly had a couple before I learned how to keep my sparge water
temperature up a little higher (around 170 F).  My opinion is that you
should acidify the sparge water IF you have high residual alkalinity (as
George suggests), and don't use a temperature above 170 F.  If you are still
losing too much heat in the lauter tun (and getting slow or stuck sparges),
then insulate the tun or change to using a Rubbermaid/Gott round cooler, or
start using rice or wheat hulls in the mash.  I'm still using a
bucket/Phil's Phalse bottom combo, but have insulated with plastic bubble
insulation that looks like a silver space blanket.  I've had my cooler for
quite awhile, but just haven't made the switch yet!  Everyone tells me my
beer is as good as the microbrewery beer they are used too, so I'm sure
running a bit cool does not cause a quality issue.

"Jack recommends using very hot sparge water to keep the grain in the
lauter tun at the proper temperature.  There is a problem with this idea.
Pouring nearly boiling water onto the grain bed will cause localized
heating at the top of the tun......


Very hot and nearly boiling are not quite the same thing.  Just
because I bring the water to a boil does not mean it is boiling
or anywhere near that when it is sprinkled (not poured) onto the
(please note) one inch of water already on top of the grain bed.


Just think of an inch or more layer of water above the grain and
then ponder how a gentle sprinkled flow on top of that transfers 
heat to the grain.  Very inefficiently.


"My grain bed is always down around 158F (70C) by the end of the sparge.


Then, whatever you are doing is working properly but there are those
who would make the case that it should be higher but certainly not
lower.  That is one of the reasons for a mashout.  You get 20 degrees
to squander.


" It could be that his sparge water is not as hot as his post implied, 
which could explain why he doesn't perceive problems with his
technique....


Not sure what I implied but that is only part of the issue as 
mentioned above.  Just so happens that my sparge tank is in the
loft and there is about 10 feet of coper tubing and a spray head
that loses a great deal of heat.  


"  It would be best to measure the temp of your sparge water as
it enters the tun....


It's a meaningless number unless you know how much heat is being
lost at the surface of the water.  The only number that matters is
the temp of the mash.  Measure at the top if you wish but I guarantee
you it will be nowhere near the sparge water temperature.

I made this later than this last year.  It was just fine on Christmas,
although it was muchbetter later.  In fact, I think I'll make an
all-grain variation this weekend, now that I think about it.


6.5# Alexander's Pale Malt Extract
1# Crystal Malt 80L
1/4# Chocolate Malt
2 Cups Brown sugar
1/2# Honey
1  oz Northern Brewers hops  (Boil)
1 oz Cascade hops
1 tsp Cardomom
5 cinnamon sticks
1/4 C grated ginger
Peel from 2 oranges, grated
1 tsp. Irish Moss
1 pck. Wyeast #1056 American
11/4 Cup  Light Dry Malt Extract (priming)


Procedure followed:
Steeped grains 30 minutes.  Added LME, Brown sugar, brought back to
boil.   Added 1 oz Northern Brewers hops.  Started a "tea" on the side
with spices by boiling water, stopping boil, and letting spices steep
while wort boiled.  (I thought boiling spices in the wort would make
them a bit astringent.)  After 50 min. of boil, added 1 oz Cascade hops,
honey, Irish Moss, and tea (straining out spices).   Cooled after 65
minutes.

One comment I have on this is that if these are Sodium lights (Orange /
Yellow) then the costs involved in running and hardware are _much_ less than
for other type of lighting. Which is why we see them so much used for street
lighting. The Talisker distillery on the Isle of Skye uses them in the
whiskey store. I might put it to them that they could say they use them to
prevent the whiskey spoiling during storage, (hold on, Oh yeah they use
wooden barrels)

Well, Al, *some* non-malt grains have a certain amount of dryness to 
them that is perceived as astringency. Like Rye, or Oats. Good things 
when used in the right proportions, but when overdone, can cause REAL 
excessive dryness akin to astringency.

I do believe that you mean *reduced* ;^)
>
>I do believe you are mistaken to blame astringency on adjuncts.
>
Perhaps, perhaps not -- I made a perfectly good Oatmeal stout last 
spring, and it had a 2.5#/gal grain bill, with 2# of the grist coming 
from Quaker Oats. After aging a few weeks, it started to develop some 
dryness I've not noticed in lesser amounts. Too, a friend made some 
"Roggenbier" last year that was basically a Bavarian Pils with a *POUND* 
of Rye added. It was so dry that it made my eyes water! My tongue felt 
like it had been grabbed by someone with a towel. Both beers were good 
when first conditioned, but within two weeks, developed an unpleasant 
dryness. Batches made later with lesser quantities of Oats/Rye were 
excellent, and remained so for the end of the last glass 8*)

Doesn't the yeast make a difference as well?  If I start two different
batches with the same wort, and use a strongly attenuating yeast in one
batch and a weakly attenuating yeast in the other, won't I end up with
different amount of residual sugar in the finished beers?  If that is the
case, I should get different Clinitest analysis for the two beers, even

Actually, White River Junction is in Vermont.  The Seven Barrel Brewery is
just across the state line in NH.  If you're going to White River
Junction, tour the Catamount Brewery.  It's a free tour, with lots of
tasting afterwards.  They sell their beer by the case, with tax and
deposit included in the price (which as I recall was much better than the
store price.)  Excellent brews!  


Ask the tour guide for directions to the Seven Barrel Brewery (brewpub). 
It's only about 10 minutes away.  Bring a designated driver.

Brewers have been making fine quality beers for hundreds of years

been making good beer for over 4 years and never considered using a 
Clinitest.  There is such a thing as applying too much technology to

Subject: Yeast beasties


A friend of mine (OK, brother-in-law) has gout, and although he enjoys my
homebrew, he usually shies away from it and drinks filtered store bought
instead.  I was wondering if I let my ales sit in secondary and then
force carbonate, if that will significantly reduce the yeast count. 
Usually I prime my kegs with dextrose right out of the primary.  My
yeast-du-jeur is Nottingham, no flames about dry yeast , it suits my
needs well.  Will this help, or is my private stock safe from extinction
anyway?  Buying a micron  filter is out of the question for several of
the usual reasons- time, money, space, extra hassle, etc...  Private
e-mail is fine, or post if you think this info might help anybody else.

Jeff,


        I have recently toured Erdinger Weissbrauerei, and I can assure you
that they use a significant portion of dark wheat malt in their Dunkelweizen,
which is definitely at the darker end of the range for the style.  They also
use a special yeast which is a lot more subtle than others.  I wish I could
have gotten a sample.  I personally like this style of Dunkelweizen.  
Oberdorfer also makes one that is similar.

I too have been reading the Alt thread with great interest, especially now that
temperatures here in Northern Wisconsin are getting to Alt-brewing ranges!
even found a local source for Weyermann Dark Munich! Life is good.


I was considering brewing a Sticke Alt as my Christmas beer. Neither the BJCP
nor AHA has guidelines for it. I did find one source on the 'Net that suggested
the following: O.G.: 1.045-1.060, IBU: 40-60, Color: 11-19, possibly
dry-hopped.


Here's a proposed recipe. Comments?
Der sticke Holzfeller Altbier (Native Germans: is my German right? I only had
two years in high school. I intend it to say "The Secret Lumberjack" because my
standard Alt is called Der Holzfeller "The Lumberjack" a la Monty Python.)
10# Weyermann Dark Munich
1# Weyermann Melanoidin
4 oz Spalt--5.7% AAU (3 oz--60 minutes, .5 oz FWH, .5 oz dry hop)
#1338 European Ale


At 70% efficiency it gives me an O.G. of 1.056


Happy Alt brewing!

Subject: Kenny's plumbing problem / Alt hopping


     Hi all,
     
     Kenny describes a system that is similar to many RIM systems (he has 
     the outlet of the lauter tun going straight to the pump, which will 
     then move wort to either the top of the lauter tun or the kettle).  He 
     is concerned about perturbing the grain bed with pressure changes when 
     switching from vorlauf to kettle filling.
     
     I designed my 1/2 bbl system with a lauter grant to avoid the problem 
     Kenny envisions.  The runoff from the lauter tun flows into the grant, 
     using only gravity and a ball valve to control the flow (cheap).  A 
     pump then moves the wort from the grant to wherever (sometimes the 
     kitchen floor when I open the wrong valve...).  The pump can be run at 
     top speed without fear of exerting unwanted forces on the grain bed.  
     This also negates the need for a relatively expensive pump speed 
     controller.
     
     One could get a similar effect by replacing the lauter grant with 
     either a pump speed controller or a ball valve on the output side of 
     the centrifugal pump, but that would require relatively precise 
     jockeying of the controls to avoid unwanted pressure changes on the 
     grain bed.  The lauter grant just seemed easier to me (I tried the 
     other ways first).
     -----------------------------
     Steve J. (and others) are pondering the dilemma of hopping an Altbier. 
      The high IBU's necessitate a large quantity of low-alpha hops so 
     there is often hop flavor "bleeding over" into the beer.  I have had 
     this problem, too, even with a 90 minute hop boil.
     
     I wonder if better results might be more easily achieved by using a 
     higher alpha hop, such as Perle.  You would be using less hops, 
     therefore introducing less hop polyphenols, etc.  It may not be 
     traditional, but it might work.  For all we know the Altstadt brewers 
     are lying when they disclose their hop preferences :)
     
     A really untraditional way of getting hop bitterness without the 
     flavor would be to use iso-alpha extract.  That would be cheating in a 
     severe way.  I wouldn't condone it, but that's just me.
     
     Have fun!

Subject: lactic acid and those big ole starters


I picked up some lactic acid to use in my brewing.  Can someone tell me -
Should I add it to the mash water or the sparge water or both?  And what
amount per gallon should I add?  I am not interested in trying to modify my
water's profile to look like some other areas water profile, but I am
willing to use a few simple additives to improve the mash.  Is there
anything else besides lactic acid that I should consider?


P.S.  whoever those advocates of the big starters were?, THANK YOU!  I
really stepped one up like 4 times to about 2/3 - 3/4 gallon, let ferment
out after the last step up, let it settle out, decanted off the spent wort
and added about 2 cups wort to the slurry the morning of brew day, pitched
that night and I have never seen anything like it.  Lag time - what is
that?  A thing of the past for me.  My airlock sounded like a machine gun
in no time.  didn't use an airlock on the starter either, just foil.
Stirred the starter up about 3 times a day (i have no oxygenator, thats
next), and I am fermenting cool - I expect great things.


Thanks again,
Pete

All kinds of new stuff has been added and a new faster server.
My site now has access to a T1 line so transfer speed should be good.
Please take a look. In fact please add a recipe. I have some plans
for the future of this site and they will only work if you people 
use the system and add recipes. I want to do some compairative
studys and other stuff the requires large numbers of data points.
The more recipes added the closer I get to doing it.
Please help me. I am not doing this to make money. I am doing it

 ...I feel honored and hope I can help with this:


According to my knowledge Warner is right ...and I must say 
that most *industrial* dark beers (Dunkelweizens as well as Alts, BTW) 
nowadays are not made in the sudhaus but in the lagering cellar by 
blending pale standard suds with traces of color-beer prior to 
bottling.


Color-beer is made according to Reinheitsgebot, using 60% pale-, 
40%(!!) color-malts and high hopping rates, OG 16-20P, 8000 EBC. It's 
sold fermented. Turn key blending stations are also supplied by the 
color-beer brewers.


In Germany only malted barley is allowed for brewing lagers, 
even special malts must be based on barley. But note that for ales like 
wheat they may also use color-malt made from malted wheat (or 
color-beer made from the same). Wheat has the advantage of being 
huskless and therefore undesirable burnt flavors are avoided.


It's incredible how many distinct flavors they create with 
different color-beers ...I'm sure even a BJCP master will have a 
hard time to distinguish between traditional colored and "industrial
colored" beer!


Living in another part of the beerworld, I don't know what exactly you 
mean with "roast malt flavors" but I can tell you that burnt flavors 
- -- literally translated: "malt-bitterness" -- are off-flavors in dark 
wheat. Smokey notes are sometimes to find and IMHO they eliminate the 
last bit of wheat characteristics (perhaps intended to making the style 
palatable for non-wheat drinkers and extend the market ...I don't 
know).


But as it seems, my knowledge of this style is very limited because I 
didn't know that there might be *traditional* ways to color 
Dunkelweizens. IMHO this style has NO TRADITION. -- Where does 
tradition start? In a certain region of the world or at a certain level 
of history? Can anyone point me to the history of Dunkelweizen?


This style has been created during the wheat renaissance in this (the 
20th) century. 100 years ago the Bavarian wheat style was almost dead, 
nearly eliminated by the upcoming lagers. And before that depression, 
WEISSBIER was the traditional -- the original wheat style. WEISS means 
white and the term was choosen to make a distinction to BRAUNBIER -- 
the brown Bavarian lagers of that time.


So there should be no traditional way (and IMHO no reason, also) to 
color a wheat and the creative challenge for us should be: Don't cover 
the yeast characteristics (4VG and sometimes iso-amylacetat) with too 
much specialty malt character!


Narziss gives the color range of 25-60 EBC for dark Hefeweizen. Even 
using all dark base-malts (munich and dark wheat) you'll have trouble 
with the lower limit. Moderate use of (huskless) color-malt and 
caramunich should be necessary.


I target for the lower limit of 25 EBC with my grain bill. The recipe
has been brewed by other wheat fans and I've got positive feedback. 


50% pale Wheat malt (4 EBC)
15% Pilsener malt (3.5 EBC)
30% Munich malt (21 EBC)
5% Caramunich (120 EBC)


add 0,7% color-malt (1300 EBC) 20-30 mins prior to mashout.


SRM = EBC /2 (1.97, to be more exact)


CHEERS &
sehr zum Wohle!

Fellow brewers-


Does anyone have any thoughts about the use of Hydrogen 
Peroxide for sanitizing the filter pads for use in a plate filter??  
I don't want to use Iodophor as I am concerned about not being 
able to rinse the iodine flavor from the paper pads.


I' thinking about sanitizing the filter setup as follows:


1)  The hoses and plate assembly in Iodophor
2)  Hydrogen Peroxide on the filter pads
3)  Run boiled/ cooled water through the pads to rinse out the 
Hydrogen Peroxide

Subject: Not again! Altbier hops


Just have to chime in with Al on this one & reassure Mr. Steve Jackson. I
get similar results, ie some hop flavor & aroma despite only one (big)
kettle addition in the alt. Compares favorably to the descriptions given
by those who've been there, & the occasional Alt produced by our local
transplanted German microbrewer & beer geek, Tom. I have a low-grade
obsession with this style, so I've queried him at length on the subject.
Of course, every time I have some homebrewed alt on hand, it all gets
consumed by my wife ( it's always her fault) before I manage to take a
jug down to the brewery for my friend's expert opinion. I think judging
Alt is tough for many judges because published style guidelines may be
incorrect or misleading, and  beers represented as 'alt' in this country
often are poor or inaccurate examples, added to the sad fact that many of
us have not been to Germany to check out the real McCoy. Anyway, sounds
to me like Steve's probably right on track, 'faults' and all.

I can't speak to the orange light issue, but I can assure you that
Unibroue is no Molsen wanna be.  Having had the opportunity to sample
large quanities of six of their beers while visiting Montreal, I can
tell you that they are truly a world class brewery.  If you don't
believe me, one sip of "La Fin Du Monde" (the end of the world) will
change your mind.  Also highly recommended is "Trois Pistoles." (you can
figure that one out)


I am surprised to hear that they are making a pilsner as their specialty
is Belgian styles.  Yes Virginia, in Quebec you can get six-packs of
fresh, very authentic, Belgian style, bottle conditioned ales in nearly
all gas stations.  Sometimes I still regret not moving there!


As for packaging, all of their six-packs are totally encased in a
cardboard box.  I am telling you, this is not a brewery that puts
marketing or efficiency ahead of the quality of their beer.


So please, don't make sweeping nasty statements about breweries that you
do not know.  Besides, if we are really honest, the last truly bad beer
that we drank was probably one that WE made!

    I live in Montreal and I have not heard anything about the orange

Unibroue is thrying to edge in on Sleeman's market appeal. IE: If they
want pilsner in clear bottles, that's what we'll give 'em.
Just as a side note to this I've tried it and it doesn't taste much like
a pilsner. It' seems to taste more like Sleeman's Lager.... Hmmmm funny
that don't you think?
