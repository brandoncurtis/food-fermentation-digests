Quinoa is not a cereal grain, though it is often treated as one.  It's

I pursued the mash-out question at some length here about
6months-1year ago (check archives for the whole brutal story).  I've
pretty much convinced myself that the mashout has little or nothing to
do with denaturing enzymes.  George D.P. clued me in that mash-out
(165F-170F) can burst some remaining starch, allowing the a-amylase
access to them, thereby increasing extraction.  The other benefit of a
mash-out is to reduce the viscosity of the lauter.

My .02,  The valve stem idea is a great one.  I wrote a short article
that was published in BT about 2 years ago concerning this very subject.
I used the chrome valve stems but rubber would work too and be a little
cheaper, in any case it's way cheaper than the commercial caps.


This summer I want to a July 4th pig roast.  I wanted to take some beer.
My solution was to design a special cap for a 3L soda bottle.  It is
something very similar to the type of fitting used when CP filling.
The beer out uses 1/4" OD (1/8" ID, i think) which allows the use of
a short line while being able to maintain the pressure for proper
carbonation (it isn't very much of a convenience when you have to drag
along 12-15' of beer tubing).  The gas in uses a valve stem.  The CO2
is supplied from a CO2 bulb bicycle tire inflator.  Works very slick.
I had to do some cutting and soldering to get the various pieces on
one fitting.  I'll have to take some photos of it, hmm maybe another
how to article.

Subject: counter pressure kegging


Hello All,
I have just upgraded to soda kegs, and really like them.  I also
purchased a counter pressure bottle filler.
 
Previously, I used the minikegs.  I really liked these, particularly the
size.  I also have a couple of Party Pigs.  I am interested if anyone
has counter pressured filled these.  The minikegs seem pretty
straightforward.  The Party Pigs seem a little more difficult.  I am
planning to get a large stopper and counter pressure fill the Pig, then
pressure up through the tap nozzle with the CO2, also popping the
pouch.  
 
Does anyone have any comments?

To Rob and any other HBDr's that I've written to (and all that I

couple of options for meeting up: Brian Rezac will be doing a hombrewing
demo out front of the hall before opening each day. This would be a good
meeting spot. I'll be there on Thursday for sure - probably other days
as well. Another good meeting place would be inside at the AHA
Hombrewers Table. I would imagine a lot of us will be there for the
members only session, so maybe a good time and place would be at the
Homebrewers Table 1/2 hour after the show starts (this would give us a
chance to grab a beer or 3 on the way to meeting). And of course, I hope
everyone can make it to the Falling Rock on Sat nite for the
HBD/Homebrewers gathering. That is scheduled to begin at 8, but I
suspect that most of us won't make it there until later after the

This is a very good point.  Since the starter does ferment down, and is at a
low SG prior to each doubling step, the idea of easing the yeast up to the
gravity of the beer by increasing the starter's gravity may not work as
advertised.  I've always done it this way because I thought that's what
Darryl had said ... and assumed the yeast must be getting tougher along the
way, or the yeast that was growing was more 'able' in higher gravities.  So,
to verify what the heck _was_ said by Darryl, I went back and re-read that
portion of the Bock book just now (it's in the Recipes chapter).  Seems that
Darryl made no such claims, only that you should pitch more yeast than the
usual rate to make sure that the yeast has a fighting chance in the
high-gravity environment.  I stand humbly corrected!  I think that I'll
modify my doubling procedure and just keep using the 1.030 (plus or minus)
gravity wort each time, concentrating on volume not gravity.  (I'm an
electrical engineer ... not a microbiologist ... what do I know?)

Subject: Bacterial sanitation thresholds


Does anybody out there know of a chart or other reference table detailing 
the potential beer-infecting bacteria and their relative sanitation 
thresholds,  ie temp/time ratios, or concentrations of chlorine or iodine 
necessary for effective control?


If it is available in archives, I'd love to have a copy, and if it is in 
someone's head or notes, I would guess that it might be very helpful to 
the masses.


I am a big proponent of use of heat for sanitation (it doesn't have the 
affect of contributing chlorine to the water table), but I don't know how 
effective it really is against lacto and other sinister beasties.  I know 
most wild yeasts are fairly intolerant to heat, but I'd love to see the 
numbers on the other stuff.

Subject: Clinitest Test


Brewsters:


AlK calls me the Master of Obfuscation and, as many times in the
past, with me and others, tries to use personal attacks and
name-calling to obscure the point of the discussion.


Please Grow Up!


Let me once more say what I have said many times in the past
and which Al chooses to blur for his own purposes:


1) Near the end of the fermentation, Clinitest is a good indicator
of the remaining fermentable sugar content, since it does not
just indicate Glucose content, but all fermentable sugars
( unlike more modern enzyme based Clinistix which is specific
to glucose).  It is not good at the beginning of the fermentation,
since sucrose is a non-reducible sugar. In most worts this
represents about a 3% error in total fermentable sugar content,
giving a too low result at the beginning of the fermentation.
However, into the fermentation, the sucrose disappears and
becomes fructose and glucose ( which are reducible) under
the influence of the extracellular invertase enzymes and so is
indicated by Clinitest. Hence my recomendation to
 < use Clinitest only at the END of the fermentation.>




2) I have often pointed out that there is a "dextrin" which is not
fermentable by ale yeast, but appears to be fermentable by
true lager yeast. I find that ale yeast are finished fermenting
when the Clinitest reading is <1/4% and often lager yeast
( even those in very dextrinous beers) ultimately give a reading
of 0% Glucose based on Clinitest.   Based on discussions with
AlK, it is possible that this is mannose, which ale yeast do not
consume but lager yeast do. The source of this "dextrin"
( that is unfermentable substance)  is just a postulate, no proof.




3)  Despite George DePiro's indication that Miller shouldn't
agitate their beer, both DeClerk and Malting and Brewing Science
indicate that some form of racking, agitation of the beer -
especially with flocculant yeasts - will help the yeast to finish
the fermentable sugars. I have provided these references many
times in the past. Agitation and racking ARE good brewing
practices if you want to ferment out all the fermentable sugars.


Despite others' attempts to change the method of brewing for this
test, I suggest any so inclined to test Clinitest start as I have
suggested and take care to maintain proper temperatures
and agitation of the yeast. I would not recommend malt extract
as many now on the market have great quantities of sugar
added to them and do not necessarily have sufficient FAN's
for healthy yeast fermentation. Other important factors to
remember is that even though the fermentation appears to be
over from a CO2 evolution standpoint, my experience is that
Clinitest indicator of fermentable sugars continue to decline over
several days after the apparent bubbling stops. My experience
 is that it may take a day or more after you get a 1/2% Glucose
reading for the reading to drop to 1/4% and then to <1/4% .
Clinitest readings should be taken for several days running to get
to a steady value.


A final point I have often made is that if Clinitest is in error by 1/4%
( the MAXIMUM it can be) it is STILL   more accurate than a
practical hydrometer at indicating the end of the fermentation.
Clinitest measures what you want to know directly and is
independent of temperature, gas bubbles, color and the like.
With a hydrometer you have to know what to expect as a
final FG, Clinitest is independent of prior knowledge, since it
indicates reducible sugar content. Hydrometers indicate ALL
dissolved substances and the fermentable sugar content can
only be inferred. Clinitest's real strength is in homebrewing,
since we often are making new brews all the time.


Good luck in exploring the usefulness of Clinitest.


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: Lactic Acid/Chlorine/Methane


Darrell asked why gypsum is recommended more often for pH control than
lactic acid. Where residual alkalinity is not excessive calcium salts
are often recommended over lactic acid because the anions of the calcium
salts (chloride, sulfate) are considered more flavor neutral than
lactate. Of course all three of these cations do have flavor effects,
some of them quite dramatic ( it doesn't take much sulfate to coarsen
the delicate bitterness of noble hops). In addition calcium does lots of
good in the mash. We can't quite say the more of it the better but
calcium is probably the ion to which that philosophy most closely
applies. One of the good things Ca does is release (in the course of the
acidification reaction) the yeast vitamin myo-inositol. Thus a calcium
salt is definitely preferred where the water is calcium poor (exception
 - Bohemian Pils brewed with very soft water). Where  the residual
alkalinity is high, additional calcium usually does not help that much
(it takes 3.5 mEq/L Ca++ to offset 1 mEq/L RA) and the acid must come
from elsewhere. High kilned malts contains quite a bit. If these are not
desired because of color consideration, then additional mineral or
organic acid is called for.

Stuart Baunoch removes "chlorine" from his water by letting it sit in
open gallon jugs and asked if there is a better way to do this. Yes, a
couple. First off, get the water out into the air i.e. put it in a
container where as large a surface area as possible is exposed. A brew
pot, stockpot, crab pot (which hasn't been used for crabs) etc. will do.
Second, agitate or circulate the water. This gets the part of the water
which isn't near the surface up to the surface so the "chlorine" can
escape to the air. Aeration, splashing, etc. are even better and heat
helps. Even with additional surface area and agitation it may take days
for the "clorine" level to get down to the hundredths of milligrams per
liter level. This is especially true if the water contains chloramine
which leaves at a rate 3 - 15 times slower than free chlorine, depending
on circumstances.




The easiest way to get rid of both chlorine and chloramine is to add 1
Campden tablet to each 20 gallons of  water being treated. This will
neutralize 3 mg/L chloramine or 6 mg/L free chlorine but will also add a
few mg/L sulfate, potassium and chloride.


Strange as it may sound, adding bleach to standing water which contains
a high proportion of chloramine  will get rid of it much more quickly
than if no bleach is added. I prefer the Campden tablet method. It is
quicker still.

Yes there is a better way. There an seemingly infinite number of home water

All of them contain some amount of activated charcoal in their filter
material. The charcoal does an excellent job of removing 90%+ of the
chlorine in municipal water.


The type you choose is completely up to you. I am a firm believer in
filtration. I have a whole house unit, and it prevents any concern about
chlorine in my brewing water. The one I have also removes a bunch of other
junk which would be bad for my beer and that I definitely wouldn't want to

IMHO, a good filtration unit is well worth the money it costs.

seems to me that both Al and Brian have said the same thing.  Al says that
sulfate increases perception of bitterness and Brian says it makes it
taste more bitter.  Taste is perception.  The circle has no end.  All is
one - oops!  Time warp to the 60's! 


What I get out of high sulfate is not so much an increase in the
perception of bitterness, but a dryness that puts a harsh edge on the
bitterness.  If the sulfate levels are really high I also get a front of
the mouth powdery dryness, similar to, but not exactly like spinach
dryness.  Using an auditory analogy, sulfate seems to do to beer taste
what adjusting harmonics to the midrange does to voice.  It doesn't raise
the volume of the voice, but just changes the tonal quality so the voice
stands out more from the background.

Subject: Second use First Wort Hops




HBD-        
I have not received any response to my query of the possibility of "FWH"
effects from spent hops from a previous batch:
FWH a barleywine, and after the boil, dump those hops into the second brews'
boil.  Will any FWH characteristics carry over?
Could it be that I'm the first homebrewer to do this? What are the copyright
and marketing implications of divulging new brewing techniques to an
electronic forum?
But seriously, folks- has anyone done this before, or thought about it?  Seems
to me, the low temps of sparging  fix the aroma components (as I understand
it).  The first boil won't extract them all.  Could they be extracted in the
second boil?  I also queried a while back about the possibilities of "First
Wort Spicing"- adding spices (such as coriander) to the first runnings.
Different chemistry, but could their be a similar effect?  Especially if you
"FWS", and FWH concurrently?  I have tried this with a Wit- FWH with .5 oz
Cascades (out of style, I know) and FWS with 1 Tbs crushed coriander.  It's
still in the secondary.


If you can tear away from the riveting Clinitest debate, give it some thought.

Subject: Re: Methane from a brewery?


In HBD #2836, Dave Humes asked where methane might be coming from in a
brewery (methane that a couple of Japanese breweries are using to produce
hydrogen for fuel cells).


For big breweries like that, I think that the most likely source of methane
is the wastewater from the breweries.  Breweries tend to generate a lot of
wastewater, and it is often pretty concentrated with organics.  The
wastewater comes from rinsing and cleaning equipment, spilled beer and
wort, bad beer(?!), etc.  A lot of the big breweries have their own
conventional wastewater treatment processes, such as activated sludge, and
those processes produce a lot of bacterial sludge.  This sludge is reduced
in volume and stabilized somewhat using anaerobic digestion, which produces
methane and carbon dioxide.  This gas would then go to a steam reforming
process to produce hydrogen and more carbon dioxide.


Obviously, this isn't part of the brewing process (unless the brewery
reuses their treated effluent as brewing water :-)!)

Subject: rank starters


Last weekend I tried a no sparge, or perhaps more accurately a low sparge,
mash.  I increased my grain bill by 20 percent and at mash out filled the
mash tun with 170F water.  I added no more water and drained to the kettle.
I collected eight gallons of 1.070 wort which I diluted to 14 gallons for the
boil to produce a 1.052 wort for the fermenter.  After draining the kettle
I refilled the mash tun with hot water, stirred, recirculated until clear,
and ran to the kettle, collecting ten gallons of 1.030 wort.  I boiled this
ten minutes, covered, and went to bed.  The next day I drained the wort in
the kettle to thirty five quart mason jars for starters.  I only had time to
pressure can fourteen of them.  I canned another fourteen the next day and
the remaining seven the morning after that.  The last twenty one appeared to
have fermented some and the last seven didn't smell that good.  I am pretty
sure something was working on them but the pressure canning should have killed
anything and denatured any toxins, right?  What I wonder about is would those
last starters be fit to use?  I realize that if they were not decanted off the
yeast before pitching they would carry their off flavors to the new beer but
suppose they were decanted?  I think Jim Liddle wrote that one could autoclave
feces but one would still have feces.  It would be sterile feces, though,
wouldn't it?  Of course, there would be flavors and smells associated with
the sterile feces but they wouldn't be capable of causing an infection would
they?
I don't think I have the nerve to use those last smelly starters but just
wondered about the possible consequences if the liquid was decanted.
I expect there will be lots of opinions about this.

I would be carefull about picking single colonies for starters. There are
some mixes cultures on the market, like wyears Bavarian wheat (I think)
that are a combination od s. cerevisiae and s. delbrucki  (sp?)  I am
certian that in some of the belgian ale strains there is also a mixed
population of yeasts. If only one of the strains is used, the flavor
profile of the beer may be altered comsiderably. By picking only the fat
colonies, you may be eliminating the other strain.
 Also, the big healthy yeast colony may not be the intended strain, as
there are wild yeasts that can outgrow the brewing strain.


 It is good practice to streak out strains to a single colony when
culturing from bottles, or under unclean conditions. To eliminate any
potential bacterial contamination. If you are certian that the strain of
yeast is infact a single strain, and not a mixed culture then using a
single colony is also ideal.

Brian -
your fridge sounds similar to the common office or dorm sizes fridges,
only way cooler. I was also given one of these small fridges. I had
planned to take off the door and build a fermentation chiller out of
foam - something loosely based on Ken Schwartz' Son of Fermentation
Chiller. I don't have the URL handy but it's been discussed here in the
past and shouldn't been hard to find. I think this should work very well
and you could build the chamber large enough to hold a couple of
carboys.


I never built it because I got the opportunity to buy some used equip
from a brewer who was no longer brewing. Got a great deal on a bunch of
stuff including a used fridge and Johnson temp controller. I have only
brewed a few batches using this setup but it makes a tremendous
difference. I brewed a hefeweizen from a recipe I had used several times
before and the improvement  was dramatic. Trying to keep the temp down
here in Florida is a major problem, and a potential source of off
flavors. I would encourage anyone to do whatever they can to control the
fermentation temps. It is one of the things that can have the most
impact on improving your beer. You should be able to buy a used fridge
and a temp controller for under $100 - or build a fermentation chiller
for much less. Whatever you do in this direction will more than pay for
itself in improved quality (not to mention the ability to lager). Hope
this helps.

Precision Brewing Systems "HERMS"  looks to be a fine example of a
commercial heat exchange system. They have a simple but effective valve
that controls the temperature with out the use of electronic temperature
controllers. Their system should be considered when thinking about this
type of setup.


You can achieve the same results with a couple of ball valves and
consistent monitoring, but left alone for just a moment and you can very
easily over shoot your target temperature. I denatured a batch with my
system when I ran into the house for just a moment and didn't switch the
valves back to bypass the heat exchanger. This is when I switched from a
manual system to a more automated system.

I can assure you that Bob is correct in the fact that a *lot* of
experimenting and expense is possible to achieve the results you desire.
My systems heat exchanger alone took several weeks of design and redesign
before I was satisfied with the results of temperature boost and not to
denaturing the enzymes. The flow rate needs established first, not so fast
that you stick the mash and not so slow that temperature raises to slowly.
Then you can experiment with the heat exchangers size, length and design
that matches your system.

>ability to raise mash temps quickly, not heat mash above 158F, Hit & hold
>temperatures accurately, not thin the mash by adding water to raise

I agree totally, if you build one or buy one you will be pleased with the
consistent results you will achieve with the system.

My experience is that some measures need to be taken when streaking petri
dishes or harvesting yeast from them. I found myself with rather frequent
instances of dishes becoming infected with various mould and or bacteria
colonies when I first started my yeast ranching career.


I found that my dishes were being infected by airborne contaminants and I
brought this situation under control only after taking some simple
precautions. Firstly, I took care to always keep the petri dish upside down
when the lid was off. Secondly, before opening any dish, I thoroughly spray
down the room with Lysol aerosol. I do this about 5 minutes beforehand.
These simple precautions have effectively prevented contaminations. You
must, of course, be certain that your growth medium is perfectly sterile or
no amount of care later on, will prevent infections.


To make things simpler, I am in the process of building a laminar flow hood.
It is a simple task, inexpensive to build, (mine will cost about $125.00),
and well worth a bit of work. It is true that a flow hood is not an absolute
necessity, but it is a simple enough project that it should not discourage
folks from taking the plunge into yeast ranching.


For those interested, there is an excellent article on building a laminar
flow hood in
Brewing Techniques Magazine, May/June issue of 1995 Vol. 3 Issue 3. The
article is entitled "How to build a Laminar Flow Hood", and is written by
Jim Caldwell.

Subject: Sideways fridge - no!


Greetings folks,


 In HBD# 2836, Brian Pickerill asks if it is ok to turn his 
fridge on its side to allow better fermenter access. He also 
mentions a noisy fan and the need for a temperature 
controller. 


 Please don't turn the fridge on its side! The compressors 
in most fridges that homebrewers are likely to use are of 
the "splash lubricated" variety. The compressor must be 
kept upright in order to provide proper lubrication, and 
since oil doesn't compress, major compressor damage 
may occur if it inhales a slug of it.


 A second possible problem may occur if the fridge uses a 
capillary tube expansion device. The oil in the compressor 
may run out into the capillary tube when the fridge is 
placed on its side. The inner diameter of the capillary tube 
is small enough that oil may prevent proper refrigerant flow 
when the compressor starts. In extreme cases, the system 
pressure is unable to clear the capillary and the system 
must be disassembled for repair.


 The controls and layout of this type of fridge may vary 
widely. The temperature may be controlled by either a 
temperature controller or a pressure switch connected to 
the low-pressure side of the system. There will likely be a 
defrost timer with adjustable time and duration settings. If 
the desired cabinet temperature is higher than 45 degF or 
so, program the timer to bypass the defrost cycles 
entirely. Try adjusting the existing temperature controller 
before deciding to replace it. Commercial controllers often 
are adjustable over a wide range. 


 Noisy fans are often caused by bent or broken fan 
blades. If the fan is metal, see if is possible to straighten 
the blades so they are all in the same plane (don't try to 
adjust the pitch). If this doesn't do the trick, see your local 
appliance parts store. There are very many possible motor 
and fan combinations, and the parts aren't expensive.


 One final note. Please understand that a commercial 
fridge is a heavy-duty device. It will be noisier and cost 
more to operate than a domestic fridge. It also is much 
more able to take a lot of abuse. 


Hope this helps!

poor me.  i haven't been able to brew for 18 months . . .


lucky me.  my wife is insisting i build a dedicated brewing facility in the
basement . . .


i've been going through web pages looking at how folks set up their systems.
most of these are for outdoor/garage systems.  these have been helpful, but i
still have some questions . . .


the plan is to tap into the natural gas line to feed burners.  i've gone to
several restaurant supply stores in the area, but can't find high output ng
burners.  where have folks found these?  and what btu rating did your burners
have?


as for venting the system, the cost of even small restaurant style hoods is
more expensive than i'd like (on the order of $1000), so i've got to cobble
something together.  constructing the hood per se will not be a problem, but
i'd like to know what others have done about the fans for moving the air.
specifically, what kind of fans have folks used?  i've thought about buying
simple bathroom fans, but i'm not sure that even multiple bathroom fans will
move enough air.  again, where did you find the fans?


once i get going, i plan to do mostly 10 gallon batches, although i will
likely do some 5 gallon batches as well.  to do this, i i'll need something
with a 15 gallon capacity for the kettle (to allow for vigorous boils), but
what about the hot water tank and mash tun?  is a 10 gallon vessel large
enough for these?  if 10 gallons is large enough, are there convenience
benefits from having larger vessels?  in order to cut down on the scarce
resource (time), i anticipate using batch sparging, which i would think (never
having actually used batch sparging) would make a larger mash tun valuable.  i
gather that trying to sparge a 5 gallon batch in a 10 gallon vessel can result
in an overly shallow bed depth; is that the case for a 10 gallon batch in a 15
gallon pot? what say those who have gone down this path before?


tia for the help.  email preferred; posting to the digest would likely
interfere with the clinitest postings  ;^)  my address is briand`at`lilly.com


one more thing.  i'm new to the indianapolis area, and i'd appreciate any
