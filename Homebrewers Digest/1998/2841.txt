Subject: Consistency in priming/carbonation


We have all read in numerous texts of the 3/4 cup of dextrose rule for
priming 5 gal. of many (most) beers to achieve the appropriate level of
carbonation.  In fact, some texts and homebrewers strongly warn against
using very much more for fear of creating gushers or bottle bombs.  I
submit for discussion to the collective that this is yet another momily
(just consider how much dextrose one would prime a Bavarian Weizen with),
but I raise a more important question based upon some information that
doesn't seem to appear in the textbooks:


According to a successful, knowledgeable, and careful commercial brewer in
the area (with plenty of homebrewing experience), the CO2 in the finished
beer is only partially derived from the priming sugar.  In fact, in his
commercial operation, there is about 1.2 volumes of CO2 in the "finished"
beer and a typical homebrew will probably have about 0.8-1.2 volumes of
CO2 in it.  (As you know, this is only about half of the final desire
carbonation level.)  If left in the secondary for varying amounts of time
after the fermentation is complete, then the amount of CO2 in the finished
beer will likewise vary, decreasing with time.  Accordingly,  the amount
of priming sugar required to carbonate the beer to the desired level will
conceivably vary widely, depending upon the time spent in the secondary
after fermentation is complete.  (Compare this with the recommendation of
C. Papazian and other authors to put the secondary away in a comfortable
place for extended periods of time, forgetting about bottling until you
have the time and the urge strikes you, with no regard for the principal
of constant decreasing CO2 of levels in the beer.)


Someone may suggest that racking to the priming container essentially gets
rid of most of the beer's CO2 before it is bottled, bringing all beers to
the same starting point.  Perhaps this is true and would explain why
commercial practices may be different that that of homebrewers.  All I
know is that I have bottled with precisely weighed dextrose into precisely
known volumes and get dissapointingly high variability in my carbonation
levels.  For example, I primed a Weizenbock (that sat in the secondary for
5 weeks) with 38 g dextrose/gallon (about 1.5 times that of my American
pale ales) and it has been judged to be "undecarbonated", especially for
the style.


So, is the CO2 content of the beer at bottling time a variable or not?
And if so, does one have to decarbonate the beer before bottling and use
considerably  more than 3/4 cup dextrose per 5 gallons ?  How would this
be applied to kegging?


Comments?

Subject: Lead Poisoning


Wasn't Italian wine and lead goblets part of the downfall of Rome?  Since
the wine wasn't up to par with what the Romans were used to, they would
'sweeten' it by drinking it from lead goblets.  This habit, added to
their other 'quirks', shortened their reign and lifespan.
This is the kind of stuff that fills my brain, instead of really useful
info.

Howdy, brewsters:


Chris writes in HBD 2840:


<snip>
Is it possible to have 3 burners run off the same
propane source?
<snip>


I built the 3 burners on my 3 tier system modeling
them after the King Kooker jet style burners. I
use 1 propane bottle with a regulator for a gas
grill. I feed the propane into a manifold made
from 1/4" ip and 3 needle valves using 1/4" flared
copper tubing to each burner. I rarely have all 3
burners going at once, but often have 2 going.
I've had no problems at all.

This worked great for me when I went to a July 4 party on my motorcycle.  I
was also on a 2 week spin around the NE and didn't really have the room to
cart a keg with me the whole trip.  The $.99 it cost for the 3L soda bottle
was worth it.  The only thing I had to keep with me was the tap cap.

For real portability, I used one of those bicycle tire inflatiors, the kind
that uses CO2 bulbs.  You may need to make an adapter depending upon your
situation so being handy with tools and soldering is a plus.  Another less
painless way to used these inflation devices is to put a valve stem right
in the center on the keg lid.  I've done it to all my kegs.  There are a
lot of pluses for this.  Some are:  adding CO2 to keg without having to
connect the quick connects, able to check the actual pressure in the keg
without having to account for line/check valve pressure losses, use a
CO2 inflator for portable use.


>$15US or so for a five gallon Cornelius type keg.  The soft drink bottles


Why not try a 3 gallon size.  They are the same diameter as 5 gallons
just a little shorter.  They are a little more portable.  I use these
because they don't take up so much space in my fridge.  I can keep the
top shelf in place for storage of bottles.

I have also discussed this offline with Ron Babcock and he has gotten

When we first started with the PBS HERMS idea, we used a counterflow wort
chiller for heating the mash. The only difficulties we saw were: 1. We
needed an additional pump to move the heating water while circulating wort.
2. Controlling heating was a bit more involved than with PBS HERMS
(control; heating water temp due to additional heat loss when pumping,
heating water flow, wort flow) 3. As mash came up to temperature it was
diffcult to keep recirculating temp at or below 158F.


In short the use of a cf chiller from our experience will work. It's just
not as simple and fool proof as PBS HERMS. You, as a brewer, have to
determine what will work best in meeting your priorities of; simplicity,
speed and cost and your desire to tinker.

Subject: leached lead


Thanks Nathan for the interesting anctedote about the pub owner. 


It reminded me that when drawing drinking or brewing water, those with
lead pipe supply lines from the street to the basement (many houses
built in the 1920's and earlier) or those with lead solder systems
(copper pipe thru the mid 1990's) should let the overnight water in
their pipes run until it changes from house temperature to ground
temperature.....which is usually colder.  The water standing in those
pipes may have leached some lead from the pipes and/or solder.


When we flush the toilet first thing in the AM, this usually does the
purge the pipes bit.  Let the coffee water run till it feels cold.

I have to agree with you Dave. I just finished building a system as you
describe. I do think you need a mixer along with the coil to improve the
efficiency. I've just published a web site describing some of the
brewing equipment at the Flat Iron Brewery, including the SHMS. If you
go there, keep in mind it's a work in progress. The address is

Subject: Collar design for an upright freezer


Dearest Collective:


I have recently had the good fortune to acquire a mid-sized upright freezer
for free. 
It has the coils fixed to the shelves, making the shelves fixed. Since I need
a place where I can ferment my 5 gal carboys I am looking into expanding the
cooled space.. 


Here is what I am thinking..
I want to remove the door, build a collar out several feet, and re-attach the
door to the collar. I haven't settled on the exact dimensions but I want room
for at least 2 carboys. 


I have read the archives concerning the matter, and it seems this has
been done sucessfully on the chest-type freezers. Has anyone this sort of
thing to an upright? 


Here are my thoughts so far..
Since I live in a hot climate (in the summer at least), I want to insulate the
collar. I have considered using plywood and 2x6 studs with regular fiberglass
insulation and, a vapor barrier of course.


Although it is a bit more expensive, I have also considered using 2 inch thick
ridgid foam insulation that has a foil backing on both sides. Maybe one layer
of this could be used as a vabor barrier/insulator in combination with a
thinner fiberglass insulation designed for a 2x4 wall, all set in my 2x6
frame. 


Is there an easier way?


Also, I will be hooking up a temperature controller, any recommended models
here?


Thanks

Subject: specialty malts


Hello to HBD,


Many folks have E-mailed me privately to comment on the need for a 
protein rest with specialty malts.  I made the comment that specialty 
malts were frequently made from lower quality grain.  The concensus, 
which I do concede is correct is that continental maltsters do not use 
lower quality grain for their "specialties", but do use higher protien 
malts.  However, these malts are overmodified (even by continental 
maltsters) precluding the need for a protien rest.  Also, although it is 
true that six row was commonly used by american maltsters for their 
specialty malts, this is no longer the rule, and even when it is, it is 
also over modified, again precluding the need for a protien rest.  
Thanks to the respondants for the clarification, and apologies to anyone 
to whom I didn't help to understand the topic.


Adam
