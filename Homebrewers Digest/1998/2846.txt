Right you are... that's why several posters have pointed out how nasty
starters taste.  If you follow my suggestion to pour off the spent wort
the day before brewing and add a small amount of fresh wort, you can indeed
build up the starter with constant aeration, add lots of nasty-tasting
yeast nutrients and ferment lager yeasts at warmer than ideal temperatures
(although you would want to cool the starter down slowly after that last
feeding so you don't shock the yeast when they hit the cool main wort)
and not worry about off-flavours.  In other words, do whatever you want
to maximise yeast health and growth early-on in the start, but treat it
like beer after that last feeding.

A question for you: have you stored beer in these for more than a week
or two?  Does the rubber of the valve stem (which is probably butyl,
certainly not food grade and rather icky-smelling) impart any aroma
or flavour to the beer?  What if you store it on its side (so the beer
actually touches the rubber)?  Can this extract any unpleasant or
perhaps even dangerous compounds from the rubber?  Chemists?

A few comments:


1. The answer to your question is "yes."  HSA is a problem both before
and after the boil.  You should try to minimise oxygen in the whole
system until you have cooled wort ready for yeast.


2. 1.25 gallons of water is an awful lot for only 2# of malt.  3 quarts
would have been safter, however for this recipe, the chocolate malt
is likely to have saved you.  The issue is pH and if you use too much
water for the malt, the pH ends up too high and you extract unwanted
polyphenols (aka tannins).  Luckily, dark malts lower pH and you should
have been okay.


3. 145F is still a bit too hot to be splashing (and therefore aerating)
your wort.  DeClerk says 140F is the upper limit, but the de-facto
standard for homebrewers is roughly 80F.  There is some debate as to
how important HSA is, although my experience indicates it is.  I am
starting to think that HSA on pale beers is simply a shelf-life issue
(the beer tastes fresh only 4 weeks in stead of 4 months or more), but
that the real damage is on high-melanoidin beers (ones with a lot of
Munich and/or Crystal malts -- different melanoidins, but melanoidins
nonetheless).  This (and quite simply sensory threshold differences)
could explain why different brewers have different opinions on HSA.

Yes. The HBD itself was harmed by it. At least one vocal and well-known
brewing personallity has publically stated that he could/would not post
information regarding reducing sugars to the HBD due to the vehemence of
the Clinitest debate. I'm sure there are others, but this was enough. 


Frankly, there will be stories and opinions to either side of the issue. 
One key fact to keep in mind is that, though we try to keep the HBD as 
fair and open as possible in regard to content, this is not a democracy. 
By its sheer size and international nature it cannot be.

Use a piece of brass or steel tubing.  Cut the end square, sharpen it
with a stone or sandpaper, and drill slowly with a little glycerine as
a lubricant.  It will core out a nice rubber plug.

Lab supply houses should carry two and even three hole stoppers.

  Steve, thanks for your post, I agree wholeheartedly.  I've been reading 
HBD since it came from hpfcmi.fc.hp.com. It's been great, but I can't 
tolerate having anyone else decide what's appropriate to discuss.

salute (pagedown, that is).  Please do proceed with experimentation and 
reporting on Clinitest (and FOOPs, botulism, mercury, lead, U.P.S., the 
toxicity of hops in sighthounds, Eisbeer, and especially Alt and Doppelbock).

Altbier glasses are straight-sided, very simple, thin glass cylinders.
They are typically between 1/4- and 1/3-liter (1/4 being most common).
Since Sticke is only one batch twice a year, I'm prety sure they don't have
special glasses for it... the beer only lasts a few days at best.


As for Pale Ale malt, surely you don't need that for the Sticke?  What
I recommend is 5 to 12% DWC Aromatic and use Munich malt for the balance.
You can even use 99% Munich and 1% chocolate malt.  Yes, I would choose
Belgian over American, but German is most authentic.  I don't know of any
German maltster making a Pale Ale malt.  Use Munich... trust me...

Toss the starter... fruit flys are notorious for clomping around in
lactic bacteria and wild yeast when they are not looking for a beer
in which to drown.

I've had *some* luck with using a *short* length of copper tubing that
has been sharpened wit a flat file.  Hold the stopper in something other
than your hand so that *WHEN* the power drill slips, it doesn't mangle
your hand.  Go very slow or you will burn the rubber. (Why do I get
the feeling I'll be quoted out-of-context on this?)

That would be one heck of a progressive HB shop, although maybe it does
exist.  I would indeed check lab supply places... they are sure to have
them.

In my experience, pellet hops will clog *anything* and *everything*.
As far as I know, the method you suggest would work only with whole
hops or plugs.

Bravo Steve Alexander on your comments in re the censorship of the Clinitest
Wars.  Although they are not the steamy, torrid posts that keep me rapt in
anticipation of the daily HBD download, they are what it is all about.   


And besides, the Clinitest Wars have given rise to some very witty humor
(kudos to Glyn Crossno's Clinitest version of the Roman Downfall) and I, for
one, like a little comic relief.  


In conclusion, I think it is every HBDer's duty to climb aboard and send us
their puns, poetry and even notional movie titles using the word "clinitest."

Maybe I'm just a cynical old bastard, but this mumbo-jumbo that
maltsters are putting out that higher protein barley is better for
malting Vienna and Munich malts sounds like a total snow job to me.  I
have a very hard time believing that a low quality barley will ever
make a high quality malt.  They're interested in using higher protein
level barley because they cost less, and they can actually charge more
because it's a specialty malt.  As Steve mentioned, the amount of
protein that is used for Maillard reactions is "in the noise", but
beyond that, why would having more nitrogen compounds somehow lead to
"better" melanoidins?  I'll take a nice Moravian Vienna malt myself,
I'm pretty sure I can make up for any of it's supposed deficiencies in
the brewhouse.

Subject: Censorship and celebrity death match


Brewsters:


I think we all share Steve Alexander's aversion  to censorship if it
is ill intended, however, I would hate to try to read the HBD if Pat
and Karl did not uphold the basic guideline that "beer only"
Subjects should be allowed in the HBD.


Also, I think maybe the the fact that Steve was out of the loop
on the decision to let Louis behave as an Independent
Counsel ( sorry ) and mediate this discussion by actually
bringing in some new facts,  may have caused Steve
to unduly attack Louis and his motives.  I believe AlK
suggested Louis and I seconded it as a way to stop the ever
deteriorating level of the Clinitest discussion to one of attacks
of a personal nature. Not what we want in the HBD.


AlK and I have been in regular discussion ( as we have been
privately with each other for a long time) with Louis in designing
the experiments to be carried out. In addition to understanding
how or if Clinitest is useful to homebrewers and how its results
should be interpreted, it is likely we will gain a better
understanding of attenuation.


One thing this will NOT be (as one of my correspondents
called it with tongue-in-cheek) is a "celebrity death match".
That is not the intent, rather a, long overdue, better understanding
of a tool gained by focussing directly upon it, looking for its
weaknesses and strengths. Louis Bonham and BT will provide
that mechanism and give this subject peer review.

Isn't it enough that we have had to put up with seeing this debate go on and
on for months? I mean, I do have a page down key for avoid these types of
subjects that don't interest me in the HBD (and believe me it has been very
busy lately!) but to write an article in BT is pushing the limit don't you
think? After all, BT is a fine publication that I look forward to receiving
every two months with great anticipation and it is a magazine that we all
PAY to receive. The Clinitest debate has been beaten to death in this forum
and both the pro's and con's can be found in the HBD archives and on Al
Korzonas's web page for those interested in this information. I for one
would rather see ANYTHING else printed in BT rather than the results of a
Clinitest experiment. I am sure that both Dave and Al have valid, documented
data to state their cases and that maybe some of you out there might be apt
to use Clinitest, and others may not. But the bottom line is [unfortunately]
most of us are wasted from hearing about it and really don't give a damn. I
feel that most of us will agree that seeing this in BT will just prolong the
agony.


However, I for one do indeed appreciate Louis's intervention to put a stop
to this silly and timeless debate.




Have a hoppy day!

Use a ferment temp around 55'F for Koelsch, for best results (using the 
Wyeast #2575, or 1007).


>I'm thinking 68 - 70 F, but now I wonder if kolsch yeast is like alt

Koelsch yeast, and German ale yeast can handle fairly cool temps, but 
*not* lager beer temp afaik. Use 80% lager malt, and 20% wheat for a 
real nice light tasting Koelsch -- and mash at around 145~149'F. Then 
keep the hopping light, like 1~1.5 oz of Saaz in the boil, w/o any late 
kettle additions. Ferment till completion (~80-85% ADA) then rack and 
lager at 35~40'F for about a month. Package, and enjoy!

Subject: Gluten Free Substitutes


While I was at the local homebrew store yesterday,
a couple came in with an interesting problem.
While he likes his beer, she is almost totally gluten intolerant,
and cannot have any beer, even though she likes it.
They asked whether there was anyway around it.
The only solution we could come up with was
using liquid rice malt as a base and adding roast
barley and black malt which we _imagine_ would have no gluten left in 
it, to make a porter/stout type of beer.
Dave Miller has a mead ale as well that we recommended as an 
experiment.
Has anyone tried making a gluten-free beer? 
Any ideas?

Subject: Re: Protein rest two-cents


Greetings Brewers,


In HBD 2844, Steve Alexander raises questions re: an over-rested mash.


"Frankly if you're not getting a *LOT* of sugar developing 80'`at`58.8C you've
got a serious mashing problem.  Try using your tongue next time - every
serious brewer should keep one handy just for such a contingency.  Rainbows
on the bubbles - ahhh recreational drugs of the '70s - I'm not sure why you
would associate this with sugar rather than oils or laminar b-glucans.


[Please insert some virtual smileys in the above - I know Charles to be a
bright and serious brewer]"


Actually, this put a smiley on my face, and I know Steve to be a gracious
poster of high-quality detail, so any clash should only yield light.


Later in his post Steve is right in suspecting pH (but not re: HSA).  I
wish I had mentioned it originally.  Our water is very soft, calcium (as
CaCO3) 11.7 mg/L (ppm), alkalinity (as CaC03) 12.0.  I add a mix of salts,
but to only 50 mg/L calcium, not enough for pH 5.4, I do it mostly to
preserve hopping nuance in the end by minimizing sulphates, carbonate and
chloride, but my mash pH (at room temp) is only 5.1 for pale beers.  Good
for protein breakdown, not so good for saccharification.  I compensate with
longer mash times (usually 40-minutes at low/mid 150's, then mashout) and
still get a small particulate break during my boil. I add Irish moss but
overlooked it in this beer.  It might have helped but still not saved this
one.  I'll tell you why, But...


I'm not letting that pychedelic swipe at bubble rainbows get past.  I've
noticed that at around 150F the sheen on the bubbles shows color (Newton
rings).  Before that, it is dull and the mash liquid is chalky -- and
tastes starchy.  It may be related to starch solubilization or heat, but
above 150F and as the mash progresses the film can cycle through
increasingly more changes of red/green then brown/violet rainbows before
finally breaking, earlier in the process it doesn't last through so many
cycles.  It's just one of the milestones in my mashes, a rude index.  As
Joe Bob Briggs says: Check it out.  Regarding the 70's,  The 60's were
wierder for me.  I'm burdened with a recreational paranoia called "What
would I do if I were stuck on Gilligan's Island?"   It causes me to
remember factoids like: beeswax melts at 150F, and note non-numerics like
bubble rainbows.


After 80 minutes at 138F the resulting wort lacked coaguable protein, not
even much foam during the boil and no cold break just solid cloudiness,
even after ferment.  After four weeks of cold conditioning I tried clearing
a sample with gelatin and another with Polyclar.  Both helped, but the
Polyclar more and it noticeably reduced the objectionable flavor.  This was
also my first use of a new crop of Wyeast 2042 (Danish) which didn't seem
to fall out so I'd thought, "Well, maybe non-flocc'ing yeast had
tannin/(phenol?)/protein crap stuck to them and are presenting this flavor.
 I can select for stronger dropout."  I  used both, and not together,
gelatin first then George Fix's suggested 40g/hL of Polyclar.  The result
is moderately bright but tastes simpler, kind of commercial.
 
Steve Alexander In HBD 2844:
"I guess I find this case to be very very unclear evidence of anything.
Kunze cites 45C-50C for primary protein degradation, you're at 58.8C -
almost 16F higher. ..."


Normally I'm with Kunze, but 45C-50C sounds whacked for optimal
*proteolytic* conversion, are you sure he doesn't mean peptiditic
degradation?  Even if the peak proteolytic temp is 132F, the enzymes
survive into higher temps before inevitably breaking down, and work faster
too.  I doubt they survived long into 138F but they appeared to have done
their damage, and to the largest proteins. 


As George De Piro wrote in HBD 2840:
"Wolfgang Kunze writes that too much protein degradation will actually
cause more haze potential in the final beer.  This is because it is the
high-molecular weight protein degradation products that are the most potent
haze causing proteins.  You therefore don't want to degrade the largest
proteins too much."


I don't know Steve it kinda walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck...


Organoleptically yours,
Charles Rich (Bothell, Wash)

Subject: Doing Al's work for Him


Although the issue has been mediated to reach a successful agreement, I take
issue with the solution.


Throughout the whole Clinitest debate, Al had been reiterating his intention to
actually try out Clinitest.  I know that he has stated this since January, at
least.  In the course of over 10 months he's set up a webpage on the subject,
posted countlessly on the subject and essentially done everything else but
actually try out Clinitest...what a waste.  With the brokered agreement Al
continues his avoidance of personally trying out Clinitest.


Al forgets his own words:


- ----quote (private communication, 1/13/97)-----
It's just frustrating to me when I report a phenomenon and try to
convince brewers that it's important and then people who mean well,
but are effectively "shooting from the hip" contradict me (sounding
very convincing).  Had you done your talc experiment before posting
your initial disagreement with me, things would have been much better.
It's an uphill battle to straighten out all the misinformation that's
already in homebrewing.  Hopefully my upcoming book will help.
- -----end quote------


Al, if you had done your experiments with Clinitest as you had repeatedly told
us you would, we wouldn't be in this situation of having the Steering Committee
step in and mediate _your_ shooting from the hip.  Through what can only be seen
as an outright refusal to see for yourself how Clinitest performs and your
repeated posting of unsubstantiated criticism you have done a great disservice
to those who read HBD.


We all would've been spared the irritation of your repeated posts had you just
done it.

From: "Penn, John" <PennJE1`at`SPACEMSG.JHUAPL.edu>
Subject: Re>New Brewer Questions


Matt asks a bunch of new-brewer questions...
First you may have noticed that there are few absolutes in homebrewing
just a lot of general rules of thumbs and depends on... So here's my
$0.02  take it for what its worth.


1)  Dry yeast starter.  The point is to pitch sufficient yeast to reduce
lag times and limit the time that bacteria can get a foothold in the
beer.  Plus underpitching may lead to some off flavors.  You can make a
starter with dry yeast if you want to but most people probably use dry
yeast because it is so convenient and doesn't require a starter.  How
much to pitch depends on the type of beer, quantity of beer (usually 5
gallons?), and type of yeast.  Lager yeasts generally require maybe
twice as much yeasties as ale yeasts.  So pitch two packets if your lag
times aren't to your satisfaction but experiment with yeast starters if
you want to.


2) Aerating  a plastic fermenter...  I don't know about the liquid yeast
need more O2 than dry part of your statement.  Some yeasts do require
more O2 than others and high gravity beers tend to saturate with O2 at a
lower concentration than normal gravity beers.  For me... I put the
plastic bucket on my legs with an empty airlock in place and shake for
about a minute to get a nice foam coating on the wort.  Seems to work
for me.  My initial mistakes were to count on pouring the wort into the
bucket and counting on enough aeration from just one vigorous pour.  If
you read previous HBDs theres info on O2 saturation experiments and
usually it takes several pours back and forth between two buckets to get
sufficient O2 saturation.


3)  Sediment settling time... How long the sediment takes to settle
depends on many factors.  How flocculent is the yeast strain in
question?  How long have the bottles sat before they were shaken up?  If
the sediment is just yeast do you care how settled they are?  


4)  Wet shirt cooling..   Cooling with a wet T-shirt can shave 5-10F off
the fermentation temperature and you can add a fan blowing on the shirt
to increase cooling.  Do you have a wet bulb/dry bulb thermometer to
determine what the temperature difference is in your area?  The cooling
effect depends on humidity.  If you live in a low humidity area this may
not work for you.  You gave the impression that it did not work at all
but what were your circumstances and how much of an effect were you
expecting vs. what you got?


5) siphonless fermenter..   Sorry, don't know about that one.


6) 2 packs of yeast for different batches...  There are so many
variables from batch to batch like ingredients, gravity, how fresh the
yeast are, how the yeast was handled etc.  Every fermentation is
probably different even with the same yeast.  Unless the ingredients
from the two different batches were identical and the brewing
procedures/ferementation temps were exactly identical I wouldn't worry
about different effects from the same yeast.  Just make sure you wait
until fermentation is complete before bottling.


7)  Stirring constantly...  In my opinion/experience the key to avoiding
most scorching is not to pour the extract into your pot while the pot is
sitting on hot coils.  Remove the pot from the hot coils, add extract,
stir for quite some time because that thick extract takes a while to mix
in, then add back to hot coils.  You can stir constantly if you want and
its good that your lid is only partially on or else you might get
excessive DMS.  


Your newbie questions are always welcome.. We'll all been there and are
still learning.  In a shameless plug for AlK (no relation or tie in)..
I think his Homebrewing book is very thorough and excellent.  There are
some mistakes in Papazians books which are most peoples first
homebrewing books, but Al works hard to elminate those kind of mistakes
and often gives both sides of an issue.   I know you can find a place to
get one from Al's webpage if you can't find it at your local brew store.
And, as you may have noticed Al is a frequent and knowledgeable
contributor to the HBD.

a few others here might need the "grounding" also.


Remember it IS a hobby (for the better part of group here).
Any hobby that can raise my blood pressure is probably
not worth it.  Seeing a few of the posts here in the past
several months makes me believe there are a hell of alot
of people taking this far to seriously.  Granted opinions
will not be the same and tempers could flare but this
is a normal problem (??). Just remember the hobby part. 


As with any issue, what works in one brewery may or may not work
in another.  Do what works for you.  It is your beer, you have 
very few people to satisfy other than youself.  Take everything
said in brewing texts and here with a grain of salt until
it proves for you in your brewery. And by all means keep it simple.
There are parameters you can control in your brewery and many more you
can not control. Take care of the important ones, the yeast, sanitation
and controlling the process as much as you can. Once you can duplicate
the process, try some "new fangled ideas".  Making good beer is not
really rocket science (ok for anyone making less than a few hundred
thousand barrels a year - it is not;).

privately something that seemed to resolve the issues.  I thanked him
and suggested he post to HBD, but he responded that he had agreed not

Always aerate, whether using dry or liquid yeast.  Running *cooled*
wort through a strainer
is a good way to aerate, but I'd rock the fermenter for a good 5-10
minutes as well.

Probably, depends on yeast strain, road conditions, and your car's

I stir constantly from 208F until the boil gets going, after which I

and stir every 10 minutes or so to assist in hop extraction.
