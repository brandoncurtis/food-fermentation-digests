people use this for quick sanitizing of funnels, taps onsite, etc.  I have
heard of bleach solutions, idofor solutions, etc.  what ratios though?  to
be used in spray bottle.

Doug,


The brand new codes for 240V dryer hookups in the US call for 4 wires,
including a 'neutral' and a ground and the two 'hot' legs.
So you could wire your heater with a new style 4 wire dryer outlet and plug.
They are not expensive. This gives you two 'hots', a common and a ground. 


More importantly- the neutral wire you are talking about in the 3 wire 240
system is NOT a neutral. Only the 3 wire 120, or the 4 wire 240 has a neutral.
Be careful! Three wire 240 is not the same as three wire 120. Both insulated
wires in the 240 system carry current to the device, {if using romex} the bare
wire is, of course, the ground.
If using wire in conduit, you need to check which two wires are hot. The
difference is sort of semantic, but you don't someone out there thinking that
the "white" wire in the 240 box in their three wire dryer outlet is not always
hot, 'cause it is.

Here's what I have going Scott....


I have an agreement with a local fire extinguisher service company. They
provided me with a 50LB co2 tank and a 20 LB tank.  I paid a $25.00
REFUNDABLE deposit for the tanks. I use the 50 lb tank until it is empty,
then call the company for a full tank. It takes them a day or two to deliver
the new 50 pounder and in the meantime, I use the 20 pound tank. When they
deliver the full 50 pounder, I pay them only for the gas which comes to
$19.00. When the 20 pounder finally gets empty, they replace that with a
full one for $16.00.  As you can see, the bigger the tank, the cheaper the gas!


One benefit of this, (besides the obvious), is that you don't have to worry
about certifications etc. The tanks belong to the fire extinguisher service
folks and that is their worry, not mine or yours.


Look in your local yellow pages under "Fire Extinguisher".  I'll bet you can
get a similar deal going, although you might not be able to get them to
deliver the gas for free, I definitely lucked out there. You might have to
take the cylinders in for replacement yourself.

I'm not a chemist, so I'll leave it to them to post on the actual reactions,
but I do know that the result of adding lactic or phosphoric acids, if
you have sufficient calcium in the mash/wort is that calcium lactate or
calcium phosphate are formed.  The latter is virtually insoluble in wort/beer
and so it will flocculate out taking precious calcium out with it.  I
believe that those who have said that the phosphoric acid results in some
yeast nutrient are probably not aware of the chemistry.  As far as I know,
given enough calcium, I don't believe any phosphate would be available
for yeast nutrition.


If you have just enough calcium, then yes, lactic acid will keep more of
it in solution and less in precipitates than phosphoric.  If you have an
abundance of calcium, then I believe that whichever acid is cheaper may
be better.  However, there is the issue of two hydrogens versus three and
the issue of varying concentrations (the lactic acid I get is 88% whereas
the phosphoric is only 10%).  Perhaps the chemists could comment on these
also?

Your theory is correct Duff. These probes are not sealed in any way beyond
the crimp. The woven stainless steel mesh covering the lead is actually one
of the conducters for the thermistor. Liquid getting past the crimp enters
the body of the probe and creates havoc. The fix is to allow to dry for a
number of days or you can force dry in a medium oven. PREVENTION: Starting 1
inch beyond the crimp and extending 12 inches along the wire, liberally coat
the stainless mesh with silicon sealant, (the clear aquarium grade). Make
the coating as smooth as possible. Allow to cure for a day or so then cover
the silicon with shrink tubing. After this is accomplished the probe can be
completely immersed without trouble.

i just called up vinotheque (you can get the phone number via
www.vinotheque.net, why they're a .net is beyond me), and inquired
a bit into the ireks situation. according to the nice fellow there:


  a.) ireks makes their own malt, and sells to weyerman
  b.) weyerman's is more highly modified than ireks; he recommended
      decoction mashing ireks for best results
  c.) he imports ireks directly, in 20 ton lots


he even offered me lot specs! what a sweetheart.


i suspect the proximity of vinotheque to crosby and baker may
be significant- by offering variety, vinotheque can likely
maintain market share against its (likely larger) competitor.

Fellow brewers,


Was reading up on stout in the Lewis book and he suggests using "a
liquor-to-grist ratio of 2.5:1 to 3:1 ... for infusion mashing."


Can anyone clarify this for me?


I usually mash at about 1-1.5 qts. per lb. of grain. He doesn't state any
units.  I have noticed that most homebrew books and publications use
qts:lbs.

I picked up a two-hole stopper for my ehrlenmeyer flask today at the
local lab supply shop for the princely sum of US $0.40.  I can't
emphasize enough the usefulness of searching out a local lab supply
house, and building a raport with them.  I go to mine quite
frequently, and they know me by name, and know I'm using the stuff for
brewing.  Flasks, stoppers, stir plates, pH strips, barb connectors,
lab quality thermometers (for less than $5!!), test tubes,
microscopes, brewing salts, etc.  You get the idea.  They have a whole
storeload of stuff that we brewers use, it's cheaper than any other
source, there's usually one in every decent-sized city, and they'll
never turn away business.


Or ..., you could spend $3, 30 min., and 5 ml of blood trying to bore
through a stopper yourself.

Hello All,
I have been pestering Al K regarding the publication of his next book, Vol
2.  He says not to expect it for a year or more.  I for one am looking
forward to it, as I enjoyed the Vol 1.


Regarding the discussion of pewter:
Antique Pewter is an alloy of Tin (>90%) and Lead.  Obviously, this is not
food grade.  Modern Pewter may have Antimony, Copper, Cadmium as well as Tin
(and Lead).  Again, Pewters with Cadmium are not food grade.  The Lead is
used to give a dark color as well as to prevent pitting.  Cadmium is used in
increase the "polishability" of the product.


Modern Food grade pewters contain Tin (~92%), Antimony (~8%) with maybe a
percent of Copper.  Antimony free Pewters may contain Silver, Bismuth and
Copper as well as the predominant Tin.


Lastly, there are some Aluminum Alloys which have the appearance of Pewter
and are food grade.  These may contain Silicon and Magnesium as well.  The
Aluminum "Pewter" is considered food grade.

Uhh, yes.  Unless you use a cucumber, and then you'll get more
cucumber flavor.


> Will more residual sweetness enhance the pumpkin flavor?


I like to stick with plain pale ale malt and pumpkin.  I like the
orange color, and use the pumpkin as sort of a crystal malt.  If you
use crystal malt, you get more of a brown coloring.  The problem
becomes lautering.  As you increase the percentage of pumpkin to get
more flavor (we used 50%), you get a larger lauter headache. We tried
rice hulls, but the pumpkin just laughed at them.

Someone here used the pumpkin to lauter in. Stuck a slotted copper
manifold in the bottom of a XXX-large one, and mashed inside.  Was

Brewed a Redhook ESB clone yesterday and got no hot break
that I could see.  This has happened before but I haven't
kept thorough enough notes to be able to state categorically
what the effects might have been on the afflicted brews.
Shame on me, I found my thermometer was reading 3 degrees F
low after I was done brewing!  Never again!  I've seen the
light.
Could the temperature problem (vis a vis mashing temp.,
sparge water temp) cause this situation?
What can I look forward to as far as effects on my finished
beer?


I seem to lose too much heat out of my mashtun (cheap cooler
with copper manifold) and so have relied on pulling a sort
of decoction (liquid only), about 2 qts and heating it on
the stove to 168-170F and adding it back in to try to
raise/maintain the temp. during the mash.  Sometimes I do
that several times rather than thin out the mash too much.
Comments?

Subject: 240V GFCI, grounding


Greetings folks,


 I had hoped to see a post from an electrician to help 
clarify the the 240V GFCI questions, but since questions 
continue, I'll see if I can shed some light on the subject.


 I'm not a licensed electrician although I have done a lot of 
electrical installation and troubleshooting related to 
industrial equipment. I also do a large amount of 
electrical/electronic control system design and 
construction as part of my current employment.


 It is true that the neutral conductor in both 120V and 
240V circuits is connected to a terminal strip in the 
distribution panel that is physically grounded to the panel 
housing, as is the ground conductor. The panel is then 
grounded to a rod driven into the earth. Many 240V 
circuits have both neutral and ground conductors since 
the powered equipment needs 120V for controls or for 
other purposes. Many others don't use a neutral since the 
equipment requires only the 240V. A ground conductor is 
still required. 


 The neutral conductor is part of the electrical current path 
and may be shared with other electrical devices. Any 
electrical resistance or opening of the ciruit in the neutral 
wiring path will place a voltage on the neutral conductor 
with respect to earth ground. If a person were to touch the 
neutral and earth ground, he/she becomes the ground 
conductor and will receive a shock.


 A separate ground conductor is connected between the

In _Using Hops:  The Complete Guide to Hops for the Craft Brewer_, Mark
Garetz suggests substituting "Northern Brewer, Galena, or any other
bittering hop to your liking."  He also says that its aroma is "not highly
regarded, but reasonably neutral in character."  I think that flavor of
boiling hops can come through even after a long boil, so you might get some
differences.  He says that Bullion shares the same wild Canadian ancestor
as Brewer's Gold, so it might be a good choice, although its "High oil
content means that aroma may come through  stronger if boil times are short
or when used in a very light lager."  He also says that Galena was bred
from open pollination of Brewer's Gold.

Allen has discovered a contradiction in thinking among HBD
readers.  Allow me to elaborate further.  Let's think about this fruit
fly thing from another angle.  What if you took a fruit fly and
dipped it in isopropanol to sterilize it (o.k., it is dead now, but
forget about that for a moment).  After sterilizing the fruit fly, rinse
it in distilled water and then dip it into a tiny amount of frothy
yeast starter that has been previously prepared.  Now take the yeast
coated fruit fly and place it in a carboy along with five gallons of
your favorite boiled and cooled wort.  How many people out there
in HBD land would exclaim that I was crazy and that there is no
way you can get any fermentation at all from less than a pin-head
sized drop of yeast?  However, what you have just done is
inoculate your wort with probably a million times more yeast cells
than the number of bacteria cells present on an average fruit fly.
Why is it that we think that it takes nothing less than a couple of
billion yeast cells to make a good batch of beer, and yet a few
bacteria will absolutely ruin a batch of beer?  Keep this sanity
check in mind next time you are contemplating a couple of
hundred dollars for a laminar flow hood, or a couple thousand
dollars for an autoclave.


Drilling stoppers:  I think this is the next candidate for censorship.

Subject: Hops aroma and flavour problems


Hi all,


I have been having on going problems with hops flavour and aroma. 
 Specifically keeping it in my beer for longer than a couple of weeks after 
the beer has begun to be consumed.  This problem occurs for all of my beer 
recipes (both ale and lagers).


My current method of making beer includes all grain mashing (by infusion), 
full wort boils for 75 minutes, immersion chilling, stepped up liquid 
yeast.  My typical beer is an ale (different styles) which is fermented at 
temperatures recommended by the yeast manufacturer.  I typically package my 
beer in bottles by adding 3/4 cup sugar in bulk to the bottling bucket, 
bottling, and waiting until their is evidence of carbonation (yeast cake in 
bottom of bottle).  I don't have co2 for purging the bottles.:(


As for hops, I have tried pellitized and flaked.  The hops always smells 
very fresh before it is used.  (I.e. I'm not using stale hops.)  I have 
tried first wort hopping, and adding hops from 30 minutes to flame-out for 
flavour and aroma  (depending on the recipe).  I like a big hop nose and 
flavour.  While the previous, gives me what I want for the first couple of 
weeks after I begin opening the packaged beer,  it quickly disappears until 
very little remains.  Older bottles (say a couple to a few months) have 
just about zero aroma and very little flavour.


Finally some questions:
*        why is the hops aroma and flavour disappearing?
*        can an infection cause this?
*        is the problem related to how I package my beer?  I.e. must I keg or use 
co2 in packaging to keep the hops aroma and flavour longer?


Any info on this would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

Subject: 240V


Two incorrect statements have been made about 240V systems in the last 2
days.  The neutral in 240V wiring is NOT the ground.  Like many 120V
circuits, some 240V circuits do not have a ground, but some do (IMO all
should).  Also, removing the neutral will not always allow the appliances
using the circuit to work.  For example, my new electric oven requires 4
wires: "+" 120, "-" 120, neutral, ground.  It uses the +/- 120 pair to apply
240V to the heating elements and convection fan.  It uses one of these and
the neutral to apply 120V to the electronic control circuitry, and the
ground to ground the chassis for safety.


I'm concerned that some things said here might lead someone to attach the
neutral wire to exposed parts such as kegs or heating chambers.  These parts
should always be grounded! 


(Electrically the ground and the neutral are the same, but they take
different paths to the panel.  If the neutral is broken, current can travel
through the ground rather than through you.  Hopefully the current through
the ground is high enough to trip the breaker so that you realize something
is wrong.  Even more hopefully, you have GFCI so that that trips no matter
what the current is or where it's going.)


I have read here that 240V GFCI breakers exist but are very expensive.  I
have learned that even 120V GFCI breakers are a ripoff compared to a GFCI
plug, which can be used to protect a whole circuit as long as it is wired in
the first position and the rest of the circuit wired from it.  I paid ~$45
for my 120V GFCI breaker, but a plug costs ~$10.  Therefore I wonder if 240V
GFCI plugs exist.  I imagine they don't given the lack of need for such an
animal.  BTW, you can't gang 2 120V GFCI units to make 240V.

Scott asks about co2 tanks . . .


Try a local fire extinguisher company.  I bought a reconditioned 15#
cylinder, hydro-tested, filled with co2, and complete with manifold
(valve and threaded fitting) for $65.  Refilling it (which I have done
only once in the 1.5 years that I have owned it) costs about $11.  I
have carbonated countless kegs and 2-liter PET bottles without a refill.
 Bigger is definitely better here, since a 5# tank costs about as much
to refill as a 15# tank.  The only drawback was that the fire
extinguisher has a 5-footed base much like a 2-liter PET bottle, so I
had to build a rolling stand for it to avoid falls (a good idea anyway).
 The shop will hydro test it for you (which is the legal/certification
hoop you must jump through).  Mine included this in the price of
admission.

I'm not an electrician, but the residential breaker panels that I have
seen
do have neutral tied to the ground bus. However, this doesn't really
mean
that neutral and ground are "the same thing". Both return current, but
one 
is intended to be the return path (neutral) while the other (ground) is
a
safety return path and is not used for normal operation.


The GFCI measures the current going out the "hot" leads and compares
that amount against the current flowing into the neutral. If they vary
by more
than a few milliamperes, the GFCI trips. Obviously, if the neutral isn't


getting all of the current, then some is "leaking" out somewhere. For
safety, it had better be "leaking" back down the ground path, not
through
your body! So, the circuit to your brewing equipment must have 4 wires,
two "hot" wires for the 240V source, one neutral and one ground.

A good model to use when wiring 240V for brewing equipment is to use the
NEC's model of wiring a whirlpool bathtub or hot tub. All exposed metal 
within 10 feet of the bathtub must be grounded to a common bus bar,
preferably at a manual disconnect box where the main 240V line meets the
wiring from the appliance ( tub, brewing equip., etc.).


It's been about 5 years since I priced a 240V GFCI. Seems to me they
were
around $200 US at the major home improvement places such as Home Depot.


I hope this information helps.

<<<


Sorry Ron, all you get is an EE, so I'll apologize in advance ;-)


The neutral is derived directly from the center of the 240 V
winding of the distribution transformer (back on the pole).  This
connection is also grounded at the base of the pole, hence the
name "grounded conductor".  The grounded conductor, or
neutral, is intended to carry full rated circuit current.


Three conductors are brought into your home; two hots
and a neutral.  In your panel, connections between the hot legs
gives you 240 V branch circuits; connections between either hot
and the neutral gives you your 120 V circuits.  Typical wiring
designs alternate branch circuits between the hot legs so that
the overall 240 V service is essentially balanced.


Another intentional grounding connection is made at the panel;
here the neutral (ground*ed* conductor) is bonded to the ground
(ground*ing* conductor).  This ground is the source of the green
(or bare) wires that are run along with the circuit conductors to
provide an alternate path for fault currents (as opposed to say,
through the electricity-harnessing homebrewer) when something
goes wrong.  Grounding conductors are not intended to carry
currents on a regular basis, but it's a good thing to have them
there when they're needed.


A single-pole (120 V) GFI monitors the net current flowing through
its circuit, essentially comparing the current coming into the load
on the hot lead to that returning from the load on the neutral.  If
the net current is not zero (i.e. some fraction of current is flowing
on an alternated path (water pipes, refrigerator frame, wet
concrete floor, etc., the device interrupts the circuit.  This is what
you want as under the right conditions a milliamp (0.001 amps) is
enough to do a person in at 120 V.  Note that a regular old circuit
breaker would require > 15 amps before it interrupts the circuit.


A 240 V GFI would work on the same principle, only between the
hot legs.  I have not actually seen one of these, and a check of
the Grainger on-line catalog does not show any, but another HBD
poster has suggested that they are available.  Can anyone else
confirm this?

I have but one data point to add to this discussion, but I'll post it
again.  I got (based upon my tasting, although I've pretty good at
this) about 20% utilisation from whole first wort hops, steeped during
the 45 minute runoff and then boiled 70 minutes.  Another way to look
at this is that I got about 2/3 or 66% of the IBUs that I had expected
from the 70 minute boil.  This one data point is pretty weak without
other supporting evidence, but if I were do use FWH again, I'd simply
multiply my expected utilisation by 2/3.


As an aside: Personally, I felt that the FWH added no aroma, and a lot
of hop flavour.  I typically add hop flavour with additions at T-15
and my gut feeling is that I would rather put the flavour hops in the
boil for 15 minutes rather than 70 minutes.  Perhaps there might be
more polyphenol (tannin) extraction?  Maybe?  I didn't notice an excessive
amount of astringency in that FWH beer and I used quite a bit of hops
(3+ ounces of Saaz for 5 gallons), so maybe polyphenol extraction is not
a concern.
