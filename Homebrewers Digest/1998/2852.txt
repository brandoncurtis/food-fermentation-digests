I may have missed A.J.'s true point, but will still add my $.02. ...........


Measuring the current on the ground wire is a never a good way to detect
electrical problems.
The issue arises when current finds a new return path (through you) to ground.
This new path
may never make it back to the ground wire you are monitoring but find a new
path via a grounded
 water pipe or something else.  A GFCI device does not measure the current
flowing on the ground
line to determine when there is a current imbalance (and for good reason).  The
device compares the
current flowing on each leg (hot and return) and if there is any difference the
switch will activate (open).
The switch does not know the actual return path (ground wire, you to a water
pipe, or that water stream
from the appliance to a drainpipe), it only knows that the amount of current
delivered is not being returned
and this is a bad thing.  So, measuring the current on the ground leg will not
save you when you dip your
SS spoon into your mash that is electrically (and thermally) "hot" if your
standing in a little spilled water
 leading to that grounded drainpipe.


You may ask" How can the appliance be "Hot" if is grounded?".  The ground wire
does have some amount
of electrical resistance and can provide a voltage drop between the appliance
and earth ground.  Also consider
poor or old connections to the apppliance that can add significant resistance
and increase the voltage potential
between it and ground.  Remember, the current will take the path of least
resistance.


Also, measuring the current on the ground leg as you have described will
indicate changes in current flow, not provide
a steady state RMS voltage unless the current is continuously changing,
probably not the case.  If the current
ramped up slowly, it may never be detected on the induction pick up described.

To prevent the foaming I have tried:  chilling the mug, slightly warming it,

As I remember pewter has a fairly rough texture and this may present a
large number of nucleation sites for bubble formation compared to the
inner surface of your glass which is fairly smooth. Rough spots promote
the formation of bubbles. When you see streams of bubbles originating from
the walls of a glass there is bound to be some type of imperfection at
the point of origin. You can demonstrate this if you want to ruin a glass
by taking a metal tool and making a scratch on the inner surface. Pour in
a beer or soda and you'll see bubbles initiating all along the length of
the scratch. How to stop it? I don't see how you can unless you either
coat the inside so as to make it smooth (I suppose you could try forming a
thin layer of ice in there using your freezer). Cooling should help keep
the gas in solution somewhat but you've already tried this although, I
believe if you  *froze*  the pewter you may actually make things worse as
now when you pour in the beer it may immediately form microcrystals when
it contacts the frozen metal and these ice crystals can themselves act as
potent nucleators but then again this is just speculation. I'd say your
best bet is to chill the beer itself down low to maximize gas solubility
then pour carefully into a well chilled (not freezing temps) mug. Give
this a try. Of course the low temp may be a sub-optimal serving temp for
your beer but one does have to make compromises at times...

Subject: Bridging from Homebrewer to Brew Pub or MicroB


Fellow Homebrewers:


I am doing the mental & financial gymnastics of buying a brew pub or a
microbrewery.  Texas has some unusual laws & rules, but I realize that there
are others who have considered these matters.  Can someone refer me to a
preliminary source for these types of brewing and liquor laws (before I make
some lawyer rich)?  A major ice cream company in Texas (Blue Bell) has a
wonderful marketing motto that sums up how I want to run a brew pub:
Eat/Drink all we can & sell the rest.


Seems like a brew pub could/should bottle & market all the production that
doesn't sell from the tap `at` the pub, but there are likely legal or
operational barriers.  The economics of the fixed costs of a homebrewer
(equipment & marriage) are magnified in a larger facility.  Looks like you
want the kettle going as often as possible & line up the fermentation tanks
to handle the through-put.  I suspect that many a homebrewer has thought
about these matters, and some have made the move to becoming a "for
(monetary) profit" brewer.


Many thanks!

I was walking through Sears Hardware the other day.  In the section where

I use these "lint traps" in my RIMS with great success. My mash/lauter tun
is an inverted 1/2bbl. Sankey keg with the bottom cut out. The hole in the
keg where the draw tube goes is the drain to my pump inlet. I use a
perforated stainless false bottom and place a stainless "lint trap" rolled
up like a sock, into the center drain hole, under the false bottom. The
"lint trap" fits snugly and prevents the grain that gets past the false
bottom from entering the pump. In my boil kettle, I use a "lint trap" at
the end of the siphon tube to keep hop particles out of my chiller. The
"lint traps" come coated with a light oil. I wash them thoroughly with
unscented dishwashing liquid and plenty of hot water before use. The "lint
traps" are durable and stand up well to mash and boil temperatures and are
a bargain at about a buck each.

Your are absolutely right bacteria will grow exponentially, IF left
on there own.  Anyone can observe this by inoculating some
sterile media with bacteria and watching it grow.  The problem
is that our home brew is not a petri dish in a lab.  And therein
lies the true contradiction.  Everybody is so proud of the fact
that they know a single bacterium can multiply to 1 million (or
trillion) in a very fast time period, but it rarely happens that way
in home brew. Our own batches of beer are almost always
contaminated with way more than a single bacterium.  Yet
seldom does a batch of beer get contaminated enough to cause
off-flavors, or worse (beer, say hi to Mr. Drain).  Why is that?


I would like to thank Mr. Meeker for answering that very question:

The first paragraph tells the old familiar story about exponential
bacterial growth.  This is something we as home brewers should
keep in mind, but do not let it spoil you brew day (or your beer - HA!). 
The second paragraph tells the real story.
Thanks for pointing this out.

as we might imagine.  That may be but I fondly remember the Pabst
Blue Ribbon my father drank in the late 1950s as being a full-

these American beers produced 30 to 40 yrs ago were pretty good
brews with a lot more flavor than todays versions.


I'm looking for an all-grain recipe that might come close to the
Pabst brew of the past. In particular the grain bill, hop varities
and amounts (please indicate IBU calculation method or give HBUs)
and mash temperatures.


Any help will be appreciated.

Subject: Citric Acid levels in homebrewed sodas


Greetings Fellow Hop Heads...


And now for something a wee bit different.  I know this is a bit off
topic, but hopefully someone can help...


I recently purchased a book on brewing homemade sodas and such. Really
good book, yadda-yadda-yadda. Made the vanilla creme soda in there and
was surprised to find my soda tasting like bland, CINNAMON-vanilla creme
soda that leaves a dull aftertaste. And there is no "crisp" life to it.
I have solved the cinnamon bit, don't put cinnamon in... hee hee. But I
want to add citric acid to give it life and bite, kind of like every
other creme soda out there. I can pick up citric acid at any
homebrew/winemaking store, no prob. But how much to use?


I brew sodas in batches of 1gal (to start) and if it is good, I will
then make a 5 gal version. How would I calculate the amount of citric
acid to add? I have a theory..


Would I be able to take my favorite brand of creme soda, do an acid test
on it to measure the amount of acid present in say a liter of the soda,
and then add citric acid to my homebrewed batch of soda to the same
level. Question: How do I calculate the levels of acid and the amount I
will need to add to my batch of soda? (algebra is squeaking its way into
this, damn!)


Does anyone know of an equation? Or does anyone have an easier way? How
much citric acid to add to a one gallon batch of creme soda??? Thanks.


Cheers,


Jonathan

I just kegged an IPA and it has a taste like weak tea - kinda tannic. It

the hops. But could it be an infection? The flavor seems to be volatile in

Subject: Q: Proper Yeast pitching temps / testing malt quality




  I have been brewing for a long time with good success, pitching at
about 80F, and then fermenting at ambient (uncontrolled) temperatures.
I recently purchased a Johnson controls fridge controller in hopes of
gaining more control over this portion of the process.  My question
is, now that I have more control, how should I control it?  After
using my combination of both immersion and counterflow chillers, my
final wort temp is 80F.  The yeast I am using calls for a 60F
fermentation temperature.  Would I be better off pitching at 80F, then
cooling to 60F, or cooling to 60F before pitching?


- ----


  After readin Al Korzonas' post from Oct 7, I am thinking that one of
the problems I have experience occasionally, namely metallic flavor,
could be a result of old malt.  I have had a tendency to buy big bags
of crushed malt, and use it over a longer than optimal period of time.
Now that I am a father, I don't buy the large bags anymore, but I
don't always brew as soon as I originally intended.  How can I tell if
the malt I have should be discarded?  Are there steps I can take to
lessen the risk of getting the metallic flavor from malt of
questionable age?


Thanks,

I use one of these thermometers for all my mashing needs.  My 
solution was to thread the probe into some Tygon tubing.  The 
interface where the Tygon "sheath" ended on the probe was sealed with 
Silicon.  Hasn't failed yet.


 By the way, allowing an already wet probe to dry for a few days 
won't work, you have to put the probe into the oven to vaporize any 
entrained liquid.

I use plastic pails for the RIMS tun, boiler and HLT and, even with a GFCI,
I'm concerned about grounding since water and wort are somewhat conductive.
 For the boiler and HLT, I made grounding eye type lugs for my heater
elements from split-open and pounded flat copper pipe.  It fits between the
rubber washer and the metal hex head on the heater element.

Hello All,


Charley Burns asks about Wyeast 2565 Kolsch Yeast behavior in HBD 2849:


>I pitched a 1 quart starter into 5 gallons of Alt (always experimenting) `at`
>1.050. After 2 weeks `at` 60-62F its only down to 1.024. Still bubbling away a

>Still getting 4 glubs per minute. Is this typical of this yeast?


I brewed a Kolsch a few months back using this yeast and was somewhat
befuddled by the same characteristics that Charley speaks of but was
extremely pleased with the resultant brew it produced. Obviously so were the
judges at the AHA Regional competition because it won first place in it's
class. Here are some stats from my brewing logbook:


Ten pound grain bill made up of Pilsner, Pale 2 Row, Vienna, and a tad of
Wheat. It was a five gallon batch with an OG of 1.047 and fermented in a six
gallon carboy for the primary. The yeast starter was stepped up from the
original Wyeast pack to 800 ml in two 400 ml stages. (Close to a quart).
Pitched into the wort at 70F and lowered the temp to 56-58F over the next
two days and held it there for 12 days total. After twelve days the beer was
still extremely cloudy but not showing the obvious signs of a vigorous
ferment. This is about the same time as you stated that yours has been in
the primary so I am not sure why you have not had the reduction in SG that I
did. A hydrometer sampling indicated that the SG on mine was 1.009 so I
racked it to a Corny keg, lowered the temperature to 46F and held it there
for 14 more days. The Cornie that I use for a secondary is one that I
twisted off the gas in fitting by accident so I bored the remaining hole out
smooth and fit an airlock in it with a small piece of tubing. Works pretty
good. After two weeks of little to no airlock activity another SG check read
1.006 and I assumed it to be the terminal gravity (gosh if I only knew about
Clinitest back then and didn't have to ASSUME or depend on a hydrometer
maybe it would have won at the National level!)  (sorry, couldn't resist
that one!!) so I primed it, fined it with 2 teaspoons of gelatin, and
bottled it. The beer was still pretty cloudy at bottling time even before I
roused in the priming sugar. I stored the bottles in the refrigerator at
about 44F for a few weeks before I sent them off to the Nationals and they
had cleared by then.


Here are some of the comments from the judges: BJCP #1 Comments: Aroma hops
OK. Color OK, overcarbonated, light haze OK. Hop flavor a tad much for
style. A tad full on the mouthfeel. Nice beer. Maybe a little lower OG & cut
back on the late hopping. Scored 39
BJCP #2 Comments: Aroma appropriate for style. Nice light color. Good
carbonation, little haze. Some wheat character evident. No fruity esters.
Body OK for style. Nice beer, a little light. Score 39.


Notice that both of them commented on the carbonation level and slight haze,
but disagreed on the body. This would indicate that this yeast is indeed a
low flocculator as per the Wyeast stat sheet. Granted, neither one of us
pitched what is considered to be an enormous yeast starter, but the
characteristics of this yeast seem to be as advertised. In my case the yeast
finally did settle in the bottles a few weeks later and it was as clear as
any American commercial pilsner on the market (barring the bottom cake of
course.)


I was extremely pleased with the flavor profile of this yeast as was
everyone that sampled this brew that I made with it. The beer had all the
visual appeal of a Bud with a snow white Guinness head and all the flavor
attributes of a light fruity ale. It is truly a hybrid/mixed yeast and I am
looking forward to brewing with it again soon. I have a few slants of it in
my yeast bank.


I know this was long winded but to answer your question, yes, it is typical
of this yeast. My suggestion to you would be to wait it out a few more weeks
in a secondary at 45-50F and see what happens. The higher temp you raised it
to might favor production of some undesirable flavor compounds and I suspect
it won't have the clean flavor profile you are probably shooting for (an
assumption on my part). Lower the temp back within the range suggested by
Wyeast. This yeast's fermentation profile is has a wide range thereby making
it predictable. The beer will clear eventually after you fine it I promise.


Have a hoppy day!

Subject: Big carboys/demijohns break easily


A word of warning to anyone planning to use demijohns for brewing. I was
given a couple of freebies and realising that they were VERY thin was ultra
cautious in handling them. I used them as primaries successfully - no need
for a blow-off hose! After I racked to kegs I started to clean them up.
Naturally you can't lift a full one ....54l = 54k = 120 lbs. But after
siphoning out 2/3 I figured I could lift it up and dump out the rest. Some
ale angel must have whispered "put your big work gloves on" because the
demijohn shattered in my hands and I was left holding the neck and looking
at about 60 lethal looking shards. Keeping the plastic casing on probably
would have prevented this but it's tough to clean with the big brush when
you can't see what you're cleaning.

I've FWH'd my latest IPA with Cascade and Chinook (2 oz each in 10

My split batch Altbier/Sticke (90% Light Munich) was mashed in

direct heated to 154F over 15 minutes and held until sacc.
completed.  Big chill haze - brilliantly clear until chilled.  I'll

Subject: Priming Lagers & Pumpkins...


     Greetings,


     I have convinced myself I need to start kegging, at least if I want to
     make lagers.  Here is a bonehead thing you should probably try to
     avoid.  I fermented and lagered a CAP.  It was very clear when I
     bottled and my lagers always seem to take a long time to bottle
     condition.  So when I bottled, I added the priming sugar (boiled
     syrup) to my bottling bucket as usual and started racking the beer
     from the carboy it had been lagering in.  Here is where I modified my
     normal procedure.  I had smacked a pack of yeast the day before and it
     was fully swollen.  I added it to ensure enough yeast to quickly
     carbonate the bottles.  Well the syrup was hot and the beer was cold.
     After getting the siphon going, I added the yeast.  Unfortunately, I
     thought I had a good siphon, but somehow a bubble had gotten in the
     siphon and I lost it.  So the yeast hit a solution that was probably
     too hot!  Negligent yeasticide.  I restarted the siphon as quickly as
     possible and completed racking to the bottling bucket.  Then I bottled
     as usual.  Well it is 3 weeks later and virtually no sediment or
     carbonation.  The beer is also still sweet.  It has been at 50 Deg F
     since it was bottled.  I'm going to try taking it to room temp and see
     if it will take off.  The good news is that it must not be badly
     infected or I would expect something to be fermenting the priming
     sugar.  And finally a question.  In addition to being pretty sweet,
     the beer seems to have a winey almost chardonney like flavor.  Would
     this be a sign of oxidation during lagering?  I lagered in a 6 gal
     carboy even though it was a 5 gal batch.  I racked a little late, so
     there was little fermentation going on in the carboy to sweep out
     oxygen.  Another good reason to start kegging and having CO2 around
     for purging things like secondaries.  Anybody care to comment?


     This is a wee bit off topic, but I would like to carve my pumpkin
     instead of mashing or fermenting it.  Anybody ever carve a pumpkin
     with some sort of brewing or beer related design they'd be willing to
     share?  I carve freehand, but a picture or sketch would be helpful.


     Cheers,

Hmm.  I wouldn't think that adding amylase would help, unless you
boiled the corn grits.  Remember, the point of boiling the grits is to
gelatinize the starches.  Your main mash will have plenty of amylase
to convert the starch to fermentables.  I know that some people
say you can just boil corn grits without doing a cereal mash, but I've
had to spend hours cleaning burned-on grits every time I've tried it.
I'd either do a cereal mash or use flaked corn.

The locus classicus for this style is Wahl and Henius, "American
Handybook of
Brewing, Malting, and Auxiliary Trades.  In the third edition (Chicago,
1908),
the information is on pp. 1276-7.  The beer was brewed commercially
mostly
around Louisville, Kentucky.  The grain bill was pale malt and 25-35%
corn,
either grits, meal or flakes, with sugar coloring added to make it
"dark, . . .
about the same as that of average Bavarian beers." Hopping is low, 1/4-
3/4 lb. per barrel.  Later Wahl and Henius write that "the beer should
possess
a pronounced malt flavor, be full to the palate, of somewhat sweet
taste,
and mild in character.  Besides these properties as to taste, the
beer should ahve a slight but characteristic bacteria taste and flavor."


I would think that you'd get this flavor (which I think means "sour") by


doing an overnight sour mash, but at that time the brewers used an
infected yeast culture: "the yeast should contain about 2 per cent of
such bacteria (20 bacteria per 1,000 yeast cells)."


I've heard of brewpubs in Tennessee and/or Kentucky brewing this
style.  As far as homebrewing, didn't Ray Daniels write an article
about brewing Kentucky Common for an AHA Convention years
ago?


Me, I'll stick to swankey, the anise-flavored low alcohol beer once
popular in western Pennsylvania.

Subject: source for CO2 cylinders




Recently I asked about sources for CO2 cylinders.  I was quickly
overrun with responses and had no hope of thanking everyone
individually.  Thanks everyone for providing much useful info.  I'll
try to summarize some of what I gathered.


Interestingly, no-one suggested buying CO2 tanks from your local HB
shop.  I plan on getting my kegs and fittings there (keeps him in
business), but the tank and gauges elsewhere.  Obviously, I'm not
alone. 


There seems to be two options for CO2 tanks; renting and buying.  Both
seem to be handled either by a welding supply house or the local fire
department.  When renting, you pay a deposit, and they simply exchange
tanks when you come in, whereas you can buy your tank and have them
fill it for you, but then you are responsible for maintaining it's
certification.  No-one really had a definitive answer on the time
between tank certification.  I got anywhere from 5-10 years.  Cost of
filling seems to range from about US $8-12 depending on volumes and
sources, etc.


Gauges were also split between those recommending dual gauges, and
those who said a single is all you really need.  I suppose it will
come down to a cost vs. utility issue for most of us.


A few people surmised correctly that when I was concerned about
safety, what I meant was gauge cages and the like, not leaks (would a
leaky CO2 tank cause my plants to sprout so vigorously that they
overtake my apt?).  Maybe because I work at NASA, and understand the
energy stored in one of these babies and what a nice rocket it would
make, or maybe just because I know how clumsy I am, but the idea of
accidently "knocking the top off" concerns me.  I must admit, I've
only seen gauge cages on larger welding tanks.  How much of an
inconvenience is it, and do they even make cages for smaller tanks (5
 - 15lb. range)?
