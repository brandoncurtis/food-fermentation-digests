Subject: Copper manifolds -- The vorlauf + sparge one...


Let's not forget that you can also have a copper vorlauf + sparge
manifold!


I'd used Phil's sparge arm for quite a while, but still needed a return
manifold for the vorlauf. You can't use one of those spinning things
'cause they'll get clogged up pretty fast. :-) After contructing my
return manifold, I also used it for sparging. It works *extremely* well.
Here's a crude 3-D drawing showing the basic design.... :-)


                            ||
                            ||
                        \\__||______//
                         \--||//----/
                            | /         
                     \\___ / /___//
                      \----------/


The whole thing is made from 1/2" copper pipe and "T" fittings. The
basic design forms an "H" when looked at from the top with a pole coming
up from the middle. On the four corners of this "H" are 90 deg. copper
fittings. These point directly *upwards* and should be kept just under
the mash level (as close to, but not above).


The wort (or sparge liquor) enters from the top and is distributed
evenly to all four corners. If one corner is not under the mash level,
the vorlauf/sparge liquor will flow from the other corners instead (path
of least resistance). So, keep all four corners *under* the wort level.


The sparge/vorlauf liquid flows in so gently you'll think it's not
flowing at all! I even did some tests with a flow rate of 7 GPM and you
could barely see the movement!


The best part if that you can use the same manifold for the vorlauf AND
sparge operations....


Happy Brewing!

Subject: pLambic (maybe)


Last February I brewed my first pLambic and it went thru its phases but
without fruit.  Oct 20th I managed to get 10# of fresh raspberries and
mushed them up and stewed them at 160F,  cooled them and added to the
plastic bucket of Lambic stock. The yeast didn't get recorded but I'm
sure it was Wyeast for Lambic. 


Later I found a copy of the Lambic book by the Ass'n of Brewers series
and it said to add the fruit after a week of primary fermentation.  


What should I do next and how long should I wait to bottle?

I have just put together a counter flow wort cooler from copper tubing

Couple of care questions arise though!  Can anyone help with advice as to

Randy Erickson asked about using ColorpHast pH strips, and how to get them
to work properly.  I answered and gave my "dip it in, lay it on a saucer,
read in a few minutes" technique.  I have since then been kindly enlightened
by Troy Hager, who has done further experiments to get the pH strips to work
well.  Fortunately, he has water with pH ranging above 9!  That made it easy
to see if he was getting the strips to work well or not.  Troy pointed out
to me that the instructions state "immersed" not just "wet" for the strips,
and noted that my technique was still at risk of giving inaccurate results.
He suggests leaving the paper (active) side of the pH strip in at least a
teaspoon of the liquid being tested for about 5 minutes, then reading the
results.  Anyway, just thought I'd pass on this correction in technique,
just in case Troy didn't post it to the HBD.

Someone recently questioned the potential differences in diastatic power

of conversion after a 4 hour mash smack dab in the sacharification
range.  While I cannot comment on the current condition of American
munich malts, Weyermann's have plenty of enzymes to do the trick.


Dave, I think we should know where the "Problem" Munich malt came from.
I can assure you that Munich Malt made from 2-Rowed Barley has enough
Enzymes to do the trick.
I don't comment on the Malt from germany that you mentioned, but
I know that US malt is good, or even better than Imports.
The statement can be proven by all the GREAT Craft brewed beers in
the US which use US malt for there nectars.

Dave, does it mean that we need a German trained Brewmaster for
German style beers; and a english trained Brewmaster for english
style beers?? :-)
I brewed a lot of german style beers and english Ales here in the US,
and I used only US malt. Not that I dislike the imported malt's,
but when brewing on a large scale, you have to consider the cost's too.
But, I also brewed  5 gal batches with Homebrewers in our Pilot 
Breweries. We (I) never had any problems with US malt, there are 
enough enzymes in US malt to do the trick; I observed problems by
using Import's and applying the infusion mashing ( to go more in detail
would be a other posting).
I also believe using Darker Malt's for color in beers ( not color extracts);
smooked malt for smooked beers (not smooked extracts ); and that 
Specialty Malt should be made from 2 - Row Barley varietys.

Ignoring everything else, your mash temp at 154F (that's 68C) is on the 
higher side encouraging the alpha enzymes which produce more unfermentable 
sugars, but much more mouthfeel. If you're thermometer is reading a degree 
or two lower than it should, you'll be well intio alpha amalayse territory 
so an FG of 20 -30 wouldn't be unusual.
A while back I experimented with high mash temps on beers with nothing but 
pale and goldings and at around 68C  the effect was lovely if you like 
sweetish thick beers, but when it got to 70C the sweetness was almost 
unpleasant, unless you like ultra sweet stuff. The FGs were between 20 an 
30.
Can't comment on the yeast cos I've never used it.
As for colour, even relatively small amounts of black/chocolate malt or 
roast barley turn beers really dark.
Brewers caramel is another alternative used to colour adjust.

One of the commonest causes of tannin extraction from grain is over 
sparging apart from over temperature of grains. A high mash ph can 
contribute as well.
For the price of a thermometer, why risk duff beer? Any thermometer is 
only accurate to + or - a percentage of the overall scale, usually 
dependant upon the price you pay for it:-)

Mark,


You sound like you've got a King Kooker pk84 type burner. The casting that 
sits in the 'cup' bit has 24 flame orifices and its designed to work at 
high pressure?
The screw you mention just goes through both castings pulling them 
together with a nut under the base. It's nothing fancy. Don't be afraid to 
just saw it off and replace it. Once sawn off, the middle casting just 
falls out (unless its gunged in with debris then it may need a helping 
hand). There's no joint in it or anything to rip. Once apart you can poke 
all sorts down the burner shaft:-)


If all else fails Metal Fusion (the manufacturer) will sell you new burner 
castings complete with nozzles and air adjustor for around 15usd.

I am planning to convert my 3 tier gravity system (using Gott) to either a
SHMS or HERMS.  My original plan was to make it a SHMS, but the necessity
for a mash mixer kinda turned me off to this one.  More recently I have
been considering go the HERMS route, but this appears to have its own set
of difficulties (don't overheat the wort, watch out for hsa, sanitize the
pump and immersion chiller).  Being able to just pump hot water thru the
immersion chiller seems to make this option better to me.
- --------


Heat exchange mash heating, in general, has it's benefits; controlled,
gentle, fast heating, without overheating, 


Between the two systems SHMS and PBS HERMS,  PBS HERMS is much simpler to
operate, but requires a completely integrated system. 


You are correct to point out the concerns; HSA, & overheating (Sanitization
is not an issue) that must be taken into account and for that reason, I
would agree SMHS is easier to design/use with a pump, immersion chiller and
cooler, than is trying to set up a system similar to PBS HERMS.


Whichever way you go I think you will enjoy the benefits.

Subject: Yeast autolysis


A 6+ week old mead developed a yeasty off-flavor while bottle conditioning.
Perhaps this was caused by yeast autolysis?  I have noticed that many HB
texts warn of leaving beer in the primary over a yeast cake too long, and
advocate racking to a secondary within two weeks in order to avoid
autolysis.  But many of the same texts mention that HB is stabilized in the
bottle because the sediment contains yeast.  Why is beer over yeast *bad* in
the bucket but *good* in the bottle?

Subject: Re: Mashing vs. Extract: a big deal, or not?


Alan E. only likes mashing because his initials (apparently) are so cool.


As for my humble opinion on the matter, going all-grain is an investment of 
money and an investment of time, but not a great deal of either.  The time 
matter gets better.  As Alan points out, some of the apparently wasted time 
would have been spent anyway.  Also, as you brew successive batches, 
you'll find ways to improve your time efficiency.  The first time I mashed, I 
think I sat and watched it the whole time ----- kind of like watching grass 
grow, and about as useful.  Every time since, I've found another way to 
speed things up.  Last time, my wife said "You're finished already" (which 
is not a pleasant thing for a guy to hear under some circumstances .... in 
this case, I didn't mind).


Finally ---- the whole thing boils down to trying it out and seeing if you like
it.  
As Alan pointed out, the alchemy of doughing in and seeing this starchy 
mess in the mash tun, and ending up with sweet wort, is ALMOST as cool 
as the difference between what goes into and comes out of the fermenter.


After being a happy extract brewer, then becoming a happy all-grain brewer, I'm
glad I didn't mess around with the partial grain type step.  One other 
seldom told secret ---- even after doing all-grain, you can still whup up a 
quick extract batch if you want .... you won't go blind.

Alan Edwards asks:
Is mashing really a time-consuming pain, or is that just a myth?


Myth.  Like you, when I went all-grain, I never looked back.


Probably the most difficult part of all-grain brewing is finding a place to
store the equipment.  When I was using extracts, I could fit all my
equipment into a grocery bag (carboy excepted.)  These days, a whole corner
of my garage is devoted to this obsession.


My "big" equipment includes 2 15 gallon kettles, 3 coolers for mash tuns, 1
cooler for a lauter tun, 1 cooler for a HLT, 2 burners, and nine fermentors
(plus kegs, bottles, and all the usual junk).  It all stacks together real
nice, but it does take some volume.  This lets me brew 2-3 10 gallon batches
on a brew day for only adds a couple more hours than a 5 gallon batch would
take.

Subject: Metallic Flavors


Reporting back on my metallic taste.  The majority of people have
sugguested that the flavor is coming from oxidation.  In off-line
conversations with Al K., he has previously pointed to oxidation as a cause
of some astringincy that I was getting.  Therefore, it would seem that this
could be the cause of both problems.  I believe the cause to be some
ridiculously old hops that I use.


Here is the game plan, assuming free time to do this.
1.  Fill keg with water and carbonate.  I hooked this up last night.  If it
tastes like metal, it is either the keg or the gas supply.
2.  Fill keg with water and let it sit.  Taste it.  If it tastes ok, then
it was not the keg and is the gas supply.
3.  If step one does not have the metallic flavor, blame it on old hops.
4.  Buy a premade kit beer.  Make the can.  Add no hops or specialty
grains.  If that does not have the metallic taste, it was the old hops.  If
the metallic taste exists, I open a soda water business.


I will post my results.  Maybe they will help somebody.


Thanks for all of the help.

Dear Friends,


In #2857, Jeremy Price sung the praises of first wort hopping 
(FWH), but made one slight misstatement: 


"First Wort hopping (FWH) is just as it sounds; you add your 
bittering hops directly to the first  runnings of the wort."


This is not so; one adds the hops that would have been the aroma 
addition at this stage, and adds the bittering hops as per usual.  
My beer page contains a summary of the Brauwelt International 
article that was the impetus for Dr. Fix's bringing FWH to the 
Digest community's attention some years back, where you can get 
more details.

I'll bite, Alan--I think time is a factor, but money really isn't.


The additional equipment necessary for simple infusion all-grian mashing
(a cooler and a false bottom/manifold/easy masher) isn't very expensive,
and it is quickly ofset by the lower cost of barley malt v. malt
extract.


Time is a significant difference.  I can do an extract batch in about 2
hours, but a full mash takes me from 4.5 to 6 hours.  That's 2 to 3
times as much of a time investment.  Is it worth it? For me, absolutely;
for my wife, no, so we alternate between extract and full mash.


I'll have to agree on the (non)hassle factor: mashing is cool!  I enjoy
stirring the grain and water together and watching it get thinner as the
starches convert. I further agree that a partial -mash will take about
as long as a full mash.


So in response to your question, "I want to ask you all:
Is mashing really a time-consuming pain, or is that just a myth?":


Time-consuming, yes; pain, no.

Subject: Gas Cookers...


Greetings!


Planning my conquest of the world of all-grain brewing and am
contemplating which outdoor gas cooker I should be using. I plan on
using a converted keg or largish brew kettle. Any suggestions?


I have been down to China Town in L.A. on several occassions and a Asian
Restaurant supply house has this (cannot tell exactly what type of metal
it is) gas cooker base. Its jets are many and spread out (radial
pattern, quite broad, about 15" in diameter or more), kind of squat,
sturdy, heavy, and cheap. Has anyone ever used one of these gas cookers
before? Anyone know the BTU output? When I asked the store clerks, they
were dumbfounded... Thanks!


Also, what would anyone suggest as my first all grain brew? (Ale
preferred... not ready to venture out into Lager-Land)


Cheers!

Having replaced 95% of the wiring in my own house and helped numerous
friends and family with wiring in their homes I would say that it is safe to
assume, as long as you assume it was done WRONG, because I've never seen a
house that had it all done right.


Everyone should get one of those little circuit testers from the hardware
store, even if you don't use electricity in your brewery.  You plug it into
an outlet and little lights tell you if anything is wrong.  Fancier ones
will cross a high resistance resistor between hot and ground to test a GFCI,
but I believe that the GFCI test button is supposed to be a good test of
that GFCI protection, so this feature may be unneccesary.

Subject: Re:  Mashing vs Extract: a big deal or not?


In HBD #2857, Alan Edwards commented about the "joys" of mashing in
response to Pete Perez's comment that he doesn't always have time for an
all-grain batch, and then invited comments from others.  So here goes...


I pretty much share Alan's enthusiasm for mashing.  I switched to all grain
mashing five years ago (after six years of extract brewing) and I haven't
looked back (except for an occasional mead?).  I get a personal sense of
accomplishment when I turn malted grain into beer.  That sense of
accomplishment wasn't as great when I was pouring cans of extract into a
pot of water.  Also, tinkering around with the brewing process is a lot of
the fun.  And the beers seem better, too.


For me, brewing usually takes 5 or 6 hours for my small (3 gallon) batches.
 And like Alan, not all of it is wasted time.  I do a two-step infusion
(whether the beer needs it or not!).  During the protein rest and then the
starch conversion, I'm usually reading the Saturday HBD.  (Don't read HBD
in a different room while the wort is coming to a boil.  I made that
mistake ONCE!)  I've got a spreasheet that does a good job of telling me
how much hot water to add to hit my desired temperatures, so I'm usually
not fiddling around with that.


For me, the part of the process that requires the most attention is
lautering and sparging.  I try to time the brewing so that lautering and
sparging is during halftime of the football game I want to watch.  I found
that cleaning the equipment right after I've used it (instead of waiting
until everything is done) makes that chore a lot more bearable. 


Alan speculates that money, rather than time and hassle, might be the big
impediment. I also acquired my all-grain equipment a little at a time, and
"practiced" using it on extract/partial mash batches.  But when I looked at
how much I "invested" for the extra equipment needed for all-grain brewing,
I figured that it paid itself off in 10 batches (110 batches ago!), just in
the savings of grain versus cans of extract.  (I did that calculation just
in case my wife asked whether it was worth it.  She never asked, and has
used the equipment to make several batches of her own.)


Again, it's too much fun to go back!

Subject: Portland Water/Thermometers


Michel Brown asked for comments on a water analysis. Judging from the
softness of the water and the mention of Bull Run, I conclude that
Michel is in Portland, OR (I can't do this for just any city but as I
gave a talk on water at the AHA conference I'm a little familiar with
the water there). Portland does use chloramination. See
http://www.water.ci.portland.or.us/3faq.htm and related pages. They do
not report the amounts of free chlorine and chloramine but only state
that all samples contain chloirine residuals. As doses change over the
course of the year and the relative amounts of chlorine and chloramine
vary according to many factors, a reported value wouldn't be very
meaningful anyway. Assume chloramine is present and treat it with
Campden tablets or let the water stand exposed to circulating air for
several days to be sure the chlorine and chloramine are gone.


As for the alkalinity: it is quite independent of hardness. Pure water
itself  has an alkalinity of about 2.5 mg/L as CaCO3 (this is 50 times
the number of mEq/L of acid required to lower the pH of pure  water to
4.3 which is what is done during an alkalinity test). Pure water with
sodium carbonate added to it would indicate substantial alkalinity. In
both cases the hardness would be 0 as hardness is a measure of calcium
and magnesium only. In the data posted we have total hardness of 6.3 ppm
and alkalinity of 7.9  which excedes this so that out of the 7.9 ppm of
alkalinity  6.3  ppm is paired with  Ca/Mg (the temporary hardness is
6.3 ppm) and the remaining 1.6 isn't . This latter is probably the
alkalinity of the water itself as mentioned above (depends on exactly
how they measured alkalinity).

Brent Oberlin asked:

Yes, several. The pertinent question is "Wrong by how much?" The usual
checks, ice water and boiling water (correcting boiling water
temperature for altitude if different from sea level) should give a
general idea as to whether the thermometer is totally out of whack or
not. If it's a liquid thermometer look for bits of the liquid separated
from the main column above the column. If its the bimetal dial type with
adjustable scale, set for the best compromise reading at boiling and
freezing. If electronic, look for a calibration procedure in the
instructions.

Greetings, all.


Brent asked about bad thermometers.


A resounding YES - thermometers can be off - by a
considerable amount.


When I first went to all-grain last year, all my beers came
out with a real high finish gravity, even when I mashed at
150F. Suspecting my floating thermometer, I bought a new
dial thermometer for mashing. The two thermometers read 9
degrees apart in room temp water. The floater read lower by
9 degrees, which means that if the dial therm was accurate,
the lowest mash temp I actually used was 159F! No wonder my
beers had high FG. Using the dial corrected that problem. I
have since purchased a cheap alcohol lab thermometer for
calibrating the dial (it is adjustable) and the floater is
11 points below what the new one reads.


Alan asked us to post our opinions about all-grain vs
extract.


I used to do 2 5gallon batches of extract based (with
specialty grains) brews back to back in about 5 hours in the
kitchen. Last Sunday, I brewed 2 8 gallon batches of all
grain back to back in about 8 hours. During that time, I was
also able to bottle 2 cases and watch some football too. 16
gallons in 8 hours is 2 gph; 10 gallons in 5 hours is 2 gph!
So, for the same time investment per gallon, I actually
filled and capped 51 12 oz bottles in 0 minutes. Hows that
for a record! Needless to say, I'm not looking back either.

Don't believe so since you got the same results with the stainless coils.

I don't think so.

You probably won't.


I have to be careful with this because I promised I would.  I have but a
couple points of my own data to back this up and I'm working on more.


When you used Star San to sanitize how did you do it?  Did you let it soak
in the kegs for and extended length of time before you filled them?  By
extended I am talking hours to days,  not the one minute that the
instructions call for.


Have you noticed any haziness to your beer after putting it in the kegs
that you didn't notice when the beer was in the carboy?


Do you detect a petroleum like odor/taste in the beer?


I would like to suggest that you sanitize your keg with standard iodophor
the next time you are going to fill them.  Let the HBD know if the metallic
flavor disappeared with the change in sanitizer.


I have had a couple of bad experiences with beer put into kegs after using
Star San that I never had using iodophor.  I have spoken with Five Star on
the subject and I believe that they running some tests as am I.


I am not saying that Star San is causing these problems but there have been
some coincidences that I can't readily explain.  The folks at Five Star
have been very good in discussing this with me and I believe that they want
to help.


If anyone would like more details e-mail me and I will explain but I don't
want to go into detail in the general forum because it is not necessary
right now.


If anyone else has noted anything odd about their beer after using Star San
that you couldn't explain please share it with the group and especially
with Five Star.


Brent I hope this helps.

little unclear about something: Is it a good idea to repitch the yeast into a
new batch of wort? I understand that the methods used today to process dried
yeast are much better than the bad old days, but is there a possibility of
wild yeast getting the upper hand? From what I've heard, the process of drying
yeast increases the chance of wild yeast contamination.
Another question: Has anyone used a kolsch yeast like Wyeast 2565 for a high
