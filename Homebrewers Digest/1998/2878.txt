Probably not in it's present configuration.  It sounds like this regulator
was
used on an acetylene tank, but can't be sure from the description.  There
are
several types of CGA (compressed gas adapter) fittings.  Each one is for
different types of gas.  You wouldn't want somebody accidentally hooking up
a N2 bottle instead of compressed breathing gas, would you.  That's why the
different fittings.


The oxygen label means that it is suitable for use with oxygen, but it
doesn't
mean that it has been used on a oxygen tank.  O2 is a very strong oxidizer
and
can violently react with internal working of the regulator if they were not
designed for O2 use.  NEVER use a regulator on O2 that does not have an
oxygen use certification.


That being said, if there is a gas supplier in your area, you should be
able
to take the regulator to them.  They'll probably have the correct CGA
fittings
for CO2.  The most expensive part is the regulator and it sounds like
you've
got a deal.  I'd also think about getting the functionality of the
regulator
checked.

Greetings Steve and all:


I used the question posed by Steve as an excuse to call
my German friends.  Once I had been on the phone long
enough for my Deutsch to come back, I asked the question and
after some initial confusion associated with morning(I forgot 
about the time difference and called at 8:30 am German time)
I got some answers.  They then called a friend in Bavaria
and got some better answers when they called back.


Accordingly, this is what I was told.  They style you asked
about is better known to homebrewers as "Weizenbock."  There
are some guidelines,  it is 50-60 percent wheat malt, sometimes
lower.  Its full bodied, and bitterness is extremely low.  
Traditionally, Weinacht Weisse is Dark with some toasty malt flavor.
and the original gravity should fall somewhere in the 1.070-1.075 range.
My dear friends assumed it was a hefe-weissen (with yeast) so it may
cloudy stuff.  They forgot to ask the brewer (oh-well)  Personally,
I enjoy hefe-weissen


Steve, you should ask your friend if he remembers the color and if 
it was cloudy, and shoot from there, if he remembers it well enough,
tell me because now I'm curious.  Weissbeir is my thing.


I would probably brew using Wyeasts Weizen Yeast (3068) and if it wasn't
cloudy, It was suggested to roll it gently across the table.


Hope that helps!

I made mine from some SS screen with 1/8" holes.  I used SS screws
and nuts to make the legs.  The one thing I did was to cut the screen
slightly undersized and then cut slit in a length of poly tubing.
I wrapped this around the edge of the screen.  Provides a nice
tight fit and the rough edges of the screen don't cut into the
side of the cooler.


My outlet is a 3/8" NPT male fitting thru the original grommet.
On the outside of the cooler I used an oring and a female
fitting.  I haven't had any leaks.  There are several others
who have done similar things.  You'll find some good
descriptions on various web sites.

My pots are thinner (not sure of the exact gauge) but here's what I
did.  I drilled and tapped a 1/4" NPT hole about .5-1" up from the
bottom.  Your .281" thick should work great.


I soldered a bushing into a ball valve and tapped it as well.  I then
inserted a close nipple in the valve and soldered.  The valve assembly
was then screwed into the pot until it was good and tight.  In  my
set-up, there were enough threads protruding into the pot so that I
could attach a 1/4" NPT female to 3/8" compression fitting.


I've done this to a 32 qt pot (my former boiler, now hot water tank)
and a 60 qt pot (my boiler).  Never had a leak.  Just be sure you
don't strip the threads in the aluminum.  I did mail order some
solder that is lead/toxic metal free and is supposed to be able to
solder almost any metal except titanium.  I haven't tried it yet
but this might work either by itself or in addition to the threads.
I'd use it in addition to threading.  The threads would provide
the mechanical connection and the solder would seal any leaks.

I saw a picture in a magazine ad of a carboy with a valve attached on the 
bottom.
Has anyone tried to modify their carboy and attach a valve.  I'm 
interested
in how difficult it is to cut through the glass.  My thoughts were to cut
 a 
hole
big enough to attach one of those bottling bucket valves.  The tricky 
part
would be holding the nut from inside the carboy in order to tighten
the valve.  My hope is to avoid the bottling bucket and the siphon hose.
Also transfer into the secondary would be easier, not to mention getting
gravity readings without having to use a wine thief.

Yikes - a cup of yeast in 5 gallons?  I'm not worried about the flavor
contribution, but all the yeast in the bottom of the bottle spoils the
clear brew I've worked so hard to achieve.  While I mostly keg now, I do
still bottle.  I generally try to carry over as little yeast as possible,
and certainly don't try to get more from the primary of another brew.  I
want as little yeast on the bottom of the bottle as possible.  I generally
get no more than the thickness of a coat of paint.  Fining with gelatine
ehlps fi I'm in a hurry.  Then even a careless pour results in nearly clear
beer, and with a little care, I get no yeast at all, even after carrying
the bottles somewhere.


I've also never had a failure from dead yeast, including lagers.  It may
take a while, but they always carbonate.

I use three 10 gallon aluminum stockpots in a bottom fired RIMS.  I really
like them.  Mike O'Brien of picoBrew fitted them with bulkhead mounted
valves and fabricated copper false bottoms for the mash and boil kettle.
He used copper bushings and I have been concerned about electrolosis
between them and the aluminum kettle, but so far, so good.  I have cleaned
the boiler once in dozens of brews with Five Star cleaner (can't remember
the name).  Did a good job.   Otherwise, I use a nylon "chore-ball"-like
scrubber when I'm done brewing each time.


As Bill says, the big advantage of aluminum (other than cost) is heat
conductivity (10X that of SS, I read here many years ago).  That is also
its disadvantage, at least in a mash tun.  I've wrapped mine in aluminum
foil/plastic bubble wrap.  This works well, but the burner head does
eventually ruin the bubbles.  I've rewrapped mine once and it's about time
to do it again.  I'd guess it lasts maybe 15 brews, maybe a little more.


I've recently begun to use a 10 gallon Igloo for the sparge water, so I
really don't need the third kettle.  Folks have posted here in the past
that the Igloo is safe for hot liquids, and I've had no warping, but the
smell of the hot container after I'm done leaves me with some health
concerns.  I do wonder what kind of plasticizers or other nasties are being
leached into my sparge water.  It has no taste, but that's not infallible.

It's clear that I wasn't clear in my post about "stealing" yeast from
the primary for use at bottling.  I *meant* to say that I suck up a cup
of *liquid*, not a cup of *yeast*.  The amount of actual yeast is
probably no more than a few tablespoons full.  I've gotten several
puzzled replies, and figured a clarification wouldn't hurt.

How to make a Bock from a Doppelbock


Or, Stupid Brewer Trick #134. The day was fantastic, 55 degrees, sparkling 
blue sky, very light breeze and the mountains white with their first good 
snowstorm of the year. I was set to once again brew the Dopplebock that did 
so well last year in competitions. I had taken very detailed notes from that 
brew (assisted by Brian S) so I was very hopeful that duplicating the batch 
was possible.


Everything went as planned, got the grains measured and milled, mashtun 
heated up, strike water heated up and nailed the 138F protein rest. Pulled 
first decoction, took it up to saccarification `at` 158F, rested 40 minutes and 
boiled it for 20. If you've never done a decoction - do it. The aromas of 
boiling grain that has been mashed at 158F are incredibly heavenly. Dropped 
the boiled grains back into the rest mash and nailed 159F - perfect.


Heated and treated to PH 5.75 6 gallons of sparge water. Took second 
decoction and boiled it 15 minutes, once again heavenly aromas. Back to the 
rest mash and hit 165F. Its too good to be true, the brew is going perfect! 
So, why not, have a couple of homebrews with lunch. Started at 9:30 am and 
its 1:00 now, ready to start sparging. Re-circulated a gallon before wort 
ran cool. Boiling grains really blows them apart and it takes quite a while 
to set the grain bed.


Now for the slowest sparge I have ever done, took 1 hour and 15 minutes. The 
brew smells so good I can hardly contain myself. But, I'm worried. This 
looks like its really strong. I was targeting 1.090-1.095 for an original 
gravity. So I stirred up the 7.5 gallons of wort and then took a reading. 
1.093! Oh my god, wayyyy too strong, it'll boil down to 1.116! I quickly did 
some more math and decided to take 1 gallon out and replace it with 1 gallon 
of water. 


So I go into my 90 minute boil, everything is progressing fine, hops and 
Irish Moss go in on time and I chill it down to 68F. After settling it goes 
into the primary along with a 1 quart starter of Wyeast 2308 and I pull a 
sample from the kettle as it goes. 1.077! Huh? What happened? Here's the 
stupid part. Even though I had stirred the wort to take my pre-boil sample, 
I have a false bottom in my kettle to catch the hops. The wort UNDERNEATH 
the false bottom never got stirred up into the wort at the top. When I took 
the sample, I took it from my kettle spigot at the BOTTOM. All the first 
runnings wort, the absolutely strongest, was under the false bottom, causing 
the sample to be totally wrong.


So now I have a bock, instead of a dopplebock bubbling away in the primary. 
Oh well. In two weeks when the primary is finished, I'll have one helluva 
yeast starter for a 1.091 dopplebock which I will try again.


I did take that 1 gallon of heavy wort and mix it with some second runnings 
and made a half batch of 1.040 spiced holiday ale too. So it wasn't a total 
loss anyway.

Andrew, did you notice that the Zymurgy article stated that the sample beers
were all shaken in transport to the tastings? The authors concede that the
tasted samples were turbid (my word-not theirs) because the corny kegs of beer
samples did not have time to settle after transport to the tasting site. That
makes all the rest of the article useless. Can you discredit a beer yeast for
being "yeasty" after you stir up the yeast? 


Perhaps the next time, a little (prior, ha) planning will help make the

Which is it? First he said MPT was incorrect and then wrote MPT-to-brasing.
A typo, I suspect.
Interesting note, though.  Last night I was in an ACE Hardware store buying

It seems they don't know either.  Or do they?

Subject: Re: Brass and Lead


Bill asks if a study has ever been done to examine whether lead is
re-exposed or leached from brass fittings after many batches.


To the best of my knowledge - No.
I suppose we should get some Lead Detection swabs and swab our parts and
see if any lead is detected.  I can think of several parts I have that
were de-leaded several years ago and have seen a lot of use since.  I
will try to remember to test them.


I am not worried about it because of the compatibility of wort and
brass/copper alloys.  In addition, the amount of lead in a brass fitting
is small. Less than 7% in all alloys that we would be using, some as low
as 3%.  Think about it.  If you have 100 grams of fittings, you have
less than 7 grams of lead, of which you are only exposing the surface
area of the part for dissolution. You would have to calculate the
surface area of all the fittings and figure the volume percent of the
lead phase (less than wt%) and determine how much you are ingesting
based on dissolution rate.  It is going to be tiny.


But you are right, this question should probably be answered
definitively.

I never weld.  I know most do, but why?  I like to fabricate bulkhead
fittings - or really just use various fittings in combinations that achieve
a bulkhead fitting.


Once welded, always welded.  Also, the welding can cause sanitary problems,

I like to experiment and be able to make changes and this gives me the

Hi all, 


About two years ago some of you may remember the the AOB/AHA was killing the
HBD. The end of this great resource was surely doomed if something was not
done to save it. 


Well anyway, I suggested to Pat that he was the only sucker errrr I mean
brewer that could really do it justice by taking it over and saving it from
the sure untimely death that my buddies at the AOB/AHA were giving it. 


Pat contacted the OEONLINE people and somehow suckered the already over
worked/underpaid/rarely thanked and all around great guy named Karl Lutzen
to go along with the idea of saving the HBD.


To make a really long story short these guys brought back the HBD to what it
was... A great free brewing resource for all to enjoy.


Being that the 2 year mark is right around now I personally wanted to say


THANK YOU PAT AND KARL FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS AND UN-ENDING HARD WORK!!!


The entire Homebrew community owes you's bumbs a great big thanks.


Hats off to you guys... 


I will now return to my normal grumpy plaid loving self...

Charles,
I noticed a very similar pattern when I first switched to a RIMS system.  It
might be the mash-out that is the culprit.  My theory is that by raising the
mash temperature to 170 deg F you may be liberating more starch and protein at
a temperature that the enzymes are no longer able to deal with them.  After a
few hazey batches I loweredc my mashout temp to ~160 deg F and are more
careful to sparge at a bit lower temp.


Of course, YMMV

in michael jackson's beer companion book, he writes that one of the

baltimore that was accompanied by.......irish dry stout.  the 
pepperiness
was undoubtedly from old bay or a close imitator.  jackson writes that, 
at
first thought, this seems an unlikely combination, but given the 
excellent
pairing of oysters and dry stout, it's not too much of a leap to 
believe
that whatever it is about dry stout that accentuates the taste of 
oysters
could do the same for the flavors in blue crab.


for michael jackson to say it was one of the most memorable meals of 
his
life, that's a strong statement.  this guy has probably tasted a 
broader
selection of authentic cuisine than all but a few on the planet.

Subject: flavor not foot, low malt beer


Brewsters:


Donald Breistle and Ted Major insist on interpreting Wurz
as foot,base,source etc. Breistle now suggests that perhaps it
Derives from the German word for value.


Wurz is German for foot of a mountain, and the like, as indicated.
WUrz ( with an umlaut over the u ) is the German word for wort.
WUrz (umlaut)  has a meaning like spice, flavoring, zest and
malt liquor when applied to beer making. Wine drinkers will
know this as a component word in the grape and wine named
GewUrztraminer -"SpicedTraminer"- to describe the taste. 




It does not derive from "wert' - German for worth or value.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------
The Wall Street Journal; today (Monday) had an article on a
new low-malt beverage ( called Buddy) that Bud is introducing
into Japan.  It has introduced a competitor in the beer style called
Haposhu which has much lower malt ( like 24%) and Bud's has
higher alcohol (6%) than competing low malt beverages on the
order of 5 to 5.5%.  Normal beer in Japan has to have at least
66.7% malt to be called "beer". Haposhu means
"sparkling alcohol drink."  This low malt beverage is being sold
since it can be made from lower cost ingredients (beans, millet, rice
and a barnyard grass calle "hie") and has a lower price in these
restrained economic times in Japan.  The price?  a 12 oz can sells
for $1.20 versus $1.80 for beer! Yeah, per can.


This is the first time Bud has ever brewed a beer different
from their mainline brew.  The reason says A-B "We're
trying to cater to a diverse market"  Yeah right.


Bud hopes to up their market share in the market to
1.2% from its current 1% and to be at 3-4% by the year 2002
( the year that spokesman obviously retires)

Subject: Sparging temperature


"Gregory M. Remec" <gremec`at`gsbalum.uchicago.edu> asks about sparging temps 
in hbd 2877:


I've found some contradictory information regarding proper sparging
temperature.  I understand that to avoid tannin extraction (assuming an
appropriate pH), I don't want the grains to reach a temperature much above
170F.  Many sources state this as the reason to heat sparge water no higher
than 170F.  However, other sources maintain that due to thermal losses, one
may use sparge water near boiling temperatures and never raise the grain
bed above 170F (assuming a properly slow flow rate).<snip>...


Yes, there are lots of different recommendations on this. I read in George 
Fix's notes (either Vienna book or the 40/60/70 article) that he recommended 
sparging at about 160F. The last few batches I've been keeping my eye on 
what my grain bed temperatures are throughout the sparge. Frankly they don't 
change much at all and it doesn't matter if the sparge water is 185F down to 
170F. My last batch was a double decoction and the grain bed hit 165F dead 
on with the second (mashout) decoction. I sparge for 1 hour and 15 minutes 
and the grain bed never changed a single degree. Started with 185F water and 
it was 170F by the time the hour was over.


One point, I never let the grain bed run dry anymore. I always heat up 1 or 
2 extra gallons of sparge water and keep and even flow the entire time. I do 
this because the first time I did it by accident, it resulted in a very nice 
clean, nearly trooooob free wort. If you've ever watched the clear tubing 
from your mashtun as the grain bed runs dry you'll see that your clear wort 
all of a sudden gets filled with chunks of grain as the water runs out.

Subject: O2 gauge & corona mill


Hello all
 
Someone picked up an oxygen gauge and asked if it will fit a CO2 tank. Gauges
will usually only fit one type gas cylinder. But they can maybe be refitted to
fit. The stem with the large nut on it is different. They can possibly be
changed to one that fits. Do you have a friendly local welding supply shop?
Take in and talk to them,  they will usually tell you if it will work or can
be made to work. Sometimes they may have a used gauge that you can trade in on
if yours can't be made to work.
You can get a hose barb to screw on the small fitting for your CO2 line to the
keg in the size to fit you CO2 line.


Someone else asked about setting up a Corona mill. Check Miller's "The
Complete Handbook of Home Brewing". Basically turn in adjustment screw until
until you can feel it touch the ball bearing and beginning to push the outer
plate towards the inner one. Back off one full turn and tighten wingnut. Crush
a cup of malt and look at it. If the crush is too coarse, tighten another 1/2
turn. Or vice versa too fine a crush. Crush another cup. Check and fine tune.

Subject: Another Belgian Ale problem


        Hello all,
   I'm a first time poster although I've been lurking for a while.
  A recent problem I've experienced and a similar one to Dean
  Fikar's has driven me to post. Although, I'm a recent convert
  to all-grain brewing (2 batches so far), the problem involves my
  last extract brew, a Belgian Tripel.
    The beer started at 1.084 SG and I pitched what I thought was
  plenty of starter (the entire slury from a previous batch of lower
  gravity Belgian Ale). It did sit in my fridge in a quart jar for 2-3
  weeks before making the starter for the tripel. The brew took off
  within a couple of hours after being aerated by pouring back and
  forth between my boiling kettle and a plastic pail.
    The beer fermented for about 8 days in my basement at somewhat
  cooler temps (65F) than I had expected. I also realized that I had 
  somewhat more than 5 gals in my 6 1/2 gal primary carboy, so when
  I racked to secondary I was prepared with a gal wine jug for the
  extra volume. Both of these bottles were kept in the same area of my
  basement at the same temps. I actually moved them closer to a space
  heater because I thought the temp may have been a littler too cool.
    Anyway, without making this any longer than it already is, the 1/2
  gallon or so in the small jug cleared like a charm and after 3 1/2 weeks
  the 5 gallon main batch is as cloudy as the day it was racked. I checked
  the gravity on both and the one in the 1 gal jug is 1.010 - the other 1.020!
  There doesn't appear to be any activity.
     I'm at a loss for why this happened and am wondering what I should
  do now - pitch more yeast? - add some kind of finings and bottle anyway?
  The brew was one of the simplest I've made - 9 lbs. of DME, 1 lb candi
  sugar and 1 lb of table sugar, lightly hopped - oh, and the yeast I used
  was Wyeast Abbey II (1762). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

In HBD#2877 Andrew Stavrolakis asked about the gas regulator he bought cheap:


Andrew,


Sorry, the regulator you bought is intended for oxygen and almost certainly
has the wrong fitting on it -- it won't mate with a CO2 tank.  The fittings
are made different for different gasses (to avoid mix-ups).  Also, the
second stage (to 150 psi) is probably too coarse for proper regulation of
CO2.  You really want better control of your CO2 (to within 0.5-1.0 psi).


On the bright side, you already have a regulator for oxygenating your wort.


Good luck and good brewing,

I doubt if any of us have mashed as you describe, but I do have one
datapoint on using a corny as a hop back after the boil which may be
relevant.  I simply fitted a stainless 'scrubby' to the end of the
'out' dip tube and threw in my handfull of whole hops.  I then let the
hot wort run into the keg instead of putting it through my counterflow
chiller.


It worked great BTW, and not only filtered as required, but imparted
the delicious hop aroma that I was seeking.  


But I had the following problems, and I believe that you would face
the same issues with your setup.


1. It took forever (1 hour actually) to run 22 litres through, even
though I was using ~ 50 PSI of CO2.  The scrubby just packed solid
with all the trub.  I would expect a squishy (pronounced like SQUEEGY
but with a fISH sound in the middle) mash would compact even more.


2. Due to the high liquid temperature, it pretty much ruined all the
rubber parts on the keg.


While I don't know for sure, I expect that the mash filters used to
make industrial beer would gently squeeze the mash over a large
surface area so as to avoid totally pulverising it.
