" The gist of the experiment was that aluminum levels were measured 
in wort before and after a boil in aluminum. The aluminum levels 
were identical.


" My question is: has this been done for "deleaded" brass?


" So why haven't we tested it even to the same level we tested for 
aluminum?


Who'se "we"?  Have "you" tested anything?


I, for one, tested and reported results from mashing, boiling and
fermenting in kettles with EASYMASHERS installed that had never
had any treatment whatsoever.  The samples were sent to a lab
along with control samples of the water that was used to brew
the batch.  Guess what?


The water had MORE lead in it then the beer.


To be totally honest, both numbers were in the noise and at the
limits of detectability but the water sample actually did have 
a higher value for lead.


Needless to say, I abandoned the plastic SLEEZYMASHER(r) project
and had another beer.


"My fittings are stainless steel.
 
Mine are all brass "loaded" with lead.


If I thought folks would pay $100 for an EM, I suppose I would offer
one in stainless.

Roger Protz describes the making of this beer fairly
detailed in the "European Beer Almanac"
86% pale malt(of 4 different types)
13,5% Caravienne malt
White Candy sugar (350 kg per brew)
Hallertau and Styrian Goldings hops, dry-hopped with Kent Goldings.
same yeast for the primary and secondary and a different (lager)
yeast for the bottle priming.
The IBU is not specified, only mention generous use of bittering
hops resulting in a tart bitterness.
I am wondering if anybody has tried making Orval  and have a
good recipe to share.

I checked with a local welding supply firm regarding my O2 regulator; they
were very nice and pointed out that converting to CO2 is as simple as
changing the CGA fitting on the regulator.  A few people have pointed out
that the 150lb gauge may not be sensitive enough for kegging purposes; I may
swap that out as well.  I *didn't* realize that a CO2 tank would cost $70
 -$90 - Holy smokes!
Looks like I may have saved a few bucks anyway.

Howdy folks!  Recently changed my mash / lauter tun.  Replaced the 3/8 inch
ID copper"ring manifold" with a pizza pan false bottom.  I also changed
from 3/8 inch ID copper to 1/2 inch ID copper for my outlet.  I've had a
little difficulty with some stuck runoffs.  I've never had problems with
the 3/8 inch ID ring manifold (even with a 50% flaked rye roggenbier...slow
but not stuck).  Is it possible that the larger bore copper tubing is
drawing wort at a high enough rate to cause the stuck run-off?  What size
"runoff" tubing are people using?  I use a converted keg.  Thanks.

Okay, here's the deal.  I recently got the question posed to me that I
love to hear from my SO.  "What do you want for Christmas"  (She shops
early; I don't get around to asking that question until sometime in mid
December . . .)  My answer?  "Well DUH -- beer stuff" (ok not exactly in
those words).


My question concerns aluminum.  I've pretty much gleaned from the digest
that the aluminum/Alzheimer's thing is mostly speculation (and really,
I'm much more likely to die of liver failure before Uncle Al ever has a
chance to visit), but since I saw a *20* gallon stockpot on sale for
about $140, I'm leaning toward this as my Xmas request.  How
durable/cleanable are aluminum pots??  I know it's a softer metal than
SS, but will it pit with repeated boilings of a relatively low pH wort?
Does it stain/retain gunk easily?  The one I saw was sort of "brushed"
looking.  Who uses these things as boilers, MT's, HLT's??

<echo sound on> IS MY BEER RUINED? <echo sound off>


Brewed an extract heffeweizen on Sunday and pitched an 800ml starter of 
Wyeast 3068 Weihenstephan.  High krausen (sp?) was 12 hours later.  
Never had a beer take off like that but then again this was the first 
time I've taken the time to do a proper starter.  The 6.5-gallon carboy 
was borrowed from a friend.  It was reportedly 'clean' but I used TSP 
and rinsed well.  Sanitized with Iodophors.  I use a chest freezer for 
temp control and held this ferment at 68F. You can really smell the 
banana when you open the lid.  This AM (Wednesday) I noticed there is 
no activity through the airlock (quick ferment?).  Still have a 1-inch, 
rocky head on the beer but there are several spots around the edge that 
are turning black and look like mold. Not in the middle of the head but 
just at the top edge where it touches the glass.  Is this normal?  This 
is also the first time I have fermented in glass.  Maybe this IS normal 
and I have just never noticed it before (wishful thinking).  Comments?

Subject: Proto-germanic brewing


I'm glad to see both Don Beistle and Dave Burley responding to my post
about the origins of 'wort' and even baiting me a bit.


The traditional explanation for basing 'wort' on the meaning 'root' is
that root also meant spice, hence a transferred meaning of an infusion
of spice and thence narrowed to the specific infusion of malt (first
instance in the OED, ca. AD1000, is "hwaetene wyrt": wheat wort).  My
knowledge of German linguistic history is pretty weak, but I suspect a
similar relation between Modern High German 'wurz' (root/foot of the
mountain) and 'wuerz' (root of plant/spice).


Don's argument for an alternate proto-germanic etymology is an
interesting one.  'Worth' derives from the Indo-european *wer, meaning
to turn.  Thus the 'worth' of the malt is that it 'turns' into beer. 
ALso related to this Indo-european root is the Old English 'wyrd'
(ancestor of modern 'wierd'), meaning 'fate.'  Beer is the fate of malt?
I like the thought, but I'm not sure such folk-etymology is enough to
convince me.

With all of the discussion about Nottingham dry yeast, I thought I might add
this little ditty. When visiting a Hops Bar & Grille (a chain in the
southeast) recently, I ordered a sampler. I thought all four of the beers
were pretty good. When talking with the "Brewmaster" I asked if he used 1056
as a lot of brewpubs do. To my surprise he said they (all Hops) use
Nottingham dry yeast. I then asked him if they rehydrate. "No, we just pitch
it right out of the pack". They are not allowed to deviate in order to
maintain consistency within the chain. The "Brewmaster" was a former
restaurant employee trained on the Pub Brewing system.


BTW, they do list a couple of their beers as lagers, but they use the same
yeast just cold conditioned.

I can't speak about the Igloo cooler, however I have used a 10 gallon   
gott cooler as a mashtun for about 2 years, and have never detected any   
off flavors that might have originated from the materials the gott was

Subject: Chimay White / Cinq Cent


Earlier this year at one of my homebrew club's meetings, the styles of the
meeting were Strong Ales and Belgian Ales. It gave me my first opportunity to
try Chimay White / Cinq Cent. Let's just say it was love at first taste. I've
searched the archives and found only one clone recipe, a reprint from Brew Your
Own. I also found the Brewing Techniques "Brewing in Styles" article by Martin
Lodahl on Belgian Trappist/Abbey Ales, but that's about it.


I assume a good base would be German or Belgian Pilsner malt with about a pound
of light candi sugar. The Lodahl article lists the original gravity as 1.071. I
don't know what IBU level to shoot for, but it must be relatively high. I've
also read that Hallertau, Saaz, or Goldings (Styrian or East Kent) would be
good choices for hops. I'd probably try to culture yeast from a few bottles of
Chimay or maybe just use Wyeast #1214 which I've heard is supposed to be the
Chimay strain.


Any thoughts? Any recipes?

My recollection is that just *some* (unidentified) kegs were agitated.  If
they *all* were shaken, we could at least derive some inference about the
flocculation characteristics of the yeasts.


Generally, I found this "AHA Road Test" to be poorly conceived and
executed.  Why bother to test dissimilar types of yeast in sub-optimal (for
the yeast's "style") worts?


I have been playing with the Nottingham since Big Brew '98 with very
acceptable results (and how can I beat the convenience?)  My (unanswered by
Zymurgy) question is:  Are there any other dry yeast "styles" (by Danstar
or another brand) that are of equal quality?


Perhaps the next time, the HBD contributors could aid in designing the "AHA
Road Test".  Brian (Rezac), are still on the list? Comments?

Subject: Darcy's Law




Folks keep bringing up Darcy's Law and how it relates to lauter
design.  IMO, it's irrelevant to the problem.  What the micro-flow
(and diffusion, etc.) between each grain particle looks like, while it
may be interesting, is not significant for predicting how the
macro-flow of sparge liquer through a lauter tun will look.


We do know exactly the downward mean velocity through the lauter tun,
because we control it with our outlet valve.  There isn't a "discharge
coefficient" involved in the macro-flow - I can raise the mean
velocity through the grainbed simply by opening my valve.  I think
it's possible to achieve an exit velocity that's pretty darn close to
the maximum predicted by ignoring the grain completely.

If you are trying to solve the problem of getting a stuck mash when making
a rye beer, let me share my recent experience mashing with 33% rye *malt*
(as opposed to flaked or raw).  My experience supports that if you do a
beta-glucan rest, and a protein rest, that there is a reduced chance of
the sparge getting stuck.  Mine didn't stick at all, although it took
2 hours and 45 minutes to collect all of the runnings.


I took a clue from a thread a while back in the HBD, and got further
clarification and help from George DePiro.  (Thanks George!)


Recipe:
  5 pounds 2-row pils malt (pils for the extra beta-glucanase)
  4 pounds rye malt (33%)
  2 pounds Munich malt
  1 pound  caramel malt


Mash schedule:
   35 min at 104F; mash in and beta glucan rest
   20 min at 122F; protein rest
  100 min at 150F; starch conversion
   15 min at 168F; mash out


(These are the actual times--I was shooting for 30, 15, 90 and 15 minutes
respectively.)


Since I mash in a 10 gallon RubberMaid cooler, I used a combination of
boiling water additions and decoction to step the mash; and ended up with
a pretty thin mash--about 17 quarts of water was added, total.  That ends
up to be about 1.4 quarts per pound.  I started out with a thick mash and
discovered a fun way to dough-in at 104F...mix it with your hands!


Anyway, the sparge never threatened to stick, but it was pretty slow--almost
3 hours to complete.


Just plan for the extra time.

HBD Brewers:


I too have been rereading all the great posts about alt brewing and am
getting ready to brew one soon. I have decided to do a single decoction and
use 100% Weyermanns Dark Munich malt.


After combing the back issues of BT and the HBD archives on decoction
schedules, I have come up with this:


Mash in at 145F - rest for 30 mins.
Pull a thick decoction and slowly ramp up to 155F - rest for 15 mins
Slowly bring to boil - boil for 30 mins
Add decoction to mash to raise to 167F
Hold at 167F for 30 mins.


All of you alt and decoction experts - what do you think?
Suggestions/critiques welcomed!


Private emails are fine!


Thanks!!

Subject: Nottingham Yeast


Dear Colleagues in brewing,


With Andrew Stavrolakis' post about Nottingham Ale Yeast bringing the
recent Nottingham posts to at least 4, I feel compelled to add another --
while we're on a roll...


I have never used this yeast, but have been interested in it ever since I
took a brewpub tour in San Diego and nearby environs last March.  I visited
at least 10 different brewpubs, and I think at least half of them were
using Nottingham yeast almost exclusively.  Many different styles, all good
to excellent beers, with only Nottingham!  One brewer even brewed his
Hefe-Weizen with it and it was fabulous.  He managed to get the esters just
right by controlling fermentation temps, mash schedule and grain selection.
[I admit to being negligent in not posting the results of my brewery tour.
Maybe I'll get out my notes and try to put something together for HBD.]


I have purchased a packet, but being a liquid yeast user and yeast rancher,
I haven't gotten around to using it yet.  I was not able to locate a source
for Nottingham Yeast as a liquid culture.  [Anybody out there know of one?]
I'm so unused to dry yeast that it hasn't reached the top of my list.


Andrew's suggestion for using Nottingham yeast in a Barleywine sounds
great.  After having just gotten around to reading the Barleywines article
in the last BT, Nottingham sounds like it fits the bill very well - high
attenuation, neutral character, clean, alcohol tolerant, good floculator...


I want to learn more about this yeast strain, so I encourage everyone with
experience with Nottingham Yeast to please share their experiences with us
through the HBD.  Could be an interesting thread, who knows.


Good luck and good brewing to you all,

anything around this time of year, except perhaps our disdain; so I'll
refrain from JR-relative measures -- at least until after Saturday's game.)

Subject: Xmas traditions


I know it's a little early but thought you all might enjoy the following
 .......


************************************************


Santa was very cross. It was Christmas Eve and NOTHING was going right.
Mrs. Claus had burned all the cookies. The elves were complaining about
not getting paid for the overtime they had while making the toys.  The
reindeer had been drinking all afternoon and were dead drunk.  To make
matters worse, they had taken the sleigh out for a spin earlier in the
day and had crashed it into a tree.


 Santa was furious. "I can't believe it!  I've got to deliver millions
of presents all over the world in just a few hours - all of my reindeer
are drunk, the elves are on strike and I don't even have a Christmas
tree!  I sent that stupid Little Angel out HOURS ago to find a
tree and he isn't even back yet!  What am I going to do?" Not knowing
what else to do, Santa went down in the cellar and brought up a firkin
of 1982 Bigfoot barleywine. He started hitting it pretty hard and
getting even more pissed off every minute.


 Just then, the Little Angel opened the front door and stepped in from
the snowy night, dragging a Christmas tree.  He says "Yo, fat man! Where


do you want me to stick the tree this year?"  And thus the tradition of
angels atop the Christmas trees came to pass......


**********************************


I had no idea this was how the tradition started. Hope you all have your
holiday beers and winter warmers well under way.

Subject: Dry yeast for Altbier??


Hi all.


My local store is out of any Wyeast appropriate for
an Altbier (German Ale 1007, Kolsch 2565, or
European Ale 1338).  Are there any dry yeasts that
could work?


Al K.'s book claims that most "Lager" dry yeast is
really cool fermenting ale yeast (p. 469).  If this
is so, what about YeastLab Amsterdam Lager, or
YeastLab European Lager?  Do they give an appropriate
maltiness?


Thanks,

Subject: I am so dry... So dry I be...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


With all the hubbub regarding dry yeasts of late, I just had to pipe in:
When educating the Eison New Jersey Brew Crew, I used nothing but dry out
of convenience. The Honey Wheat was one of the CLEANEST I've ever brewed.
I think it was Whitbread...


See ya!
