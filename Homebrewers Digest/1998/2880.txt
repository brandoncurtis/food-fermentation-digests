Subject: Bottle Priming / Pb in Brass


Homebrew craniums,


Recently, I asked a few questions here and elsewhere about
CO2 in relation to bottle priming.  I've just posted a web page
with a JavaScript calculator for bottle priming (the reason for
my questions).  Here's the link:


http://hbd.org/~mriley/brew.cgi/widgets/bp0.html


You can download the page and use it without going
online, and... It works in metric, too!


On the same page, you'll find a list of beer styles with
carbonation level guidelines and a chart giving a
breakdown of the priming rates for various ingredients.

And, of course, you tested using brand new EASYMASHERS as
well as used ones, right?  Because, if the whole point was to
determine if lead gets leached into beer, you'd want to test virgin
brass - brass that hadn't already had all the surface lead leached

Subject: Oversparging?


Greetings all.


Dittos on the kudos to Pat and Karl.  Last week when the
server was down for a whole day!!!, was a bummer.  I was
clicking here and there, willy nilly, drat!  Like the
proverbial day without sunshine.


On to my question:
In my hubris I tried to emulate Mr. Maier and brew a
Shakespeare Stout knockoff lo these three weeks ago and had
an odd occurence I would like to bounce off y'all.


The recipe called for an OG of 1061.  I figured my grain
bill using 70% efficiency, typical of my system, and
proceeded as per usual.  Mashed 45 minutes `at` 145F, them
raised it to 150-152F for 60 more minutes.    I had plenty
of extra sparge water just in case I got lucky and my
efficiency turned out higher than usual and kept sparging
until my runnings dropped to SG 1010(temp. corrected,
natch).
I ended up with 9.5 gallons of runnings, which, when boiled
and knocked out yielded almost 8 gallons of 1044 wort.
In doing my numbers it appears I DID get 70% efficiency, 68%
actually (486potentialGU/330actualyieldGU), but in WAY too
much water.


I know I could have kept boiling longer to concentrate the
wort more and raise the SG, but my question (finally) is
"What the hell happened?"  Why did it take 10 gallons of
water to extract the required amount of fermentables?  Is
that the true test of efficiency of my system?  Would my
mash temps being so low be enough to put me in that range
SG?

Subject: Liquid Nottingham?


Herbert Bresler asks about availability of a liquid culture of
Nottingham yeast.


The whole point of the Danstar line is that it is DRY.  Dry yeast offers
cost, storage, and pitching rate advantages (versus directly pitching a
single smack-pack let's say).  If you want to use liquid cultures, it
pretty much defeats the purpose.


Mark Ohrstrom asks about other Danstar yeasts.  They offer a couple
others, "Windsor" and "London", with different characters compared with
Nottingham.  I've used both with good results.  They offer more
fruitiness and less attenuation.  See http://www.lallemand.com for lots
of good info.

Subject: Clear near beer


Richard,
I've toyed with the idea lately of a hydromel.  Maybe 2 pounds of honey per
gallon of must with a sweet mead yeast.  Use squeezed lemons to provide
some acidity and the lemon flavor.  I've got a mead going right now that is
nothing but 10 pounds of honey topped off to 5 gallons with water and
Lalvin D47 yeast.  It's not done fermenting, but is getting close.  It's
pretty good, with a touch of sweetness left.  I'm beginning to think that
some of these lower gravity meads (mine started at 1.074) have merit.  


I think this may be the type of thing your wife might enjoy.  I've got a
lemon / ginger / chamomile mead in the secondary right now that had 16
pounds of honey in 5 gallons.  I may try a small batch with less honey and
a less attenuative yeast.


Anyhow, I wonder if this might work to fit your wifes desire.  You could
easily make a small batch (1 gallon) to see how it works.  That makes the
yeast a little expensive, but that beats ending up with 5 gallons of
something that wasn't what you expected.

Subject: I am so dry... So dry I be


I wonder if the resurgence in favor of dry yeast is due to better
quality control by the producers in fast 6 or 7 years, or if we are
managing the use of the dry yeasts better?  I to recently used
Nottingham for a Bitter and a Barleywine (the Bitter was used to produce
enough yeast for the Barleywine).  But rather than pitch the dry yeast
directly I did make a 1 liter starter and that went into the Bitter
wort.  In the last 6 years or so my processes have improved from my
early brewing experiences with dry yeast.  So it's hard to factor out
the reasons for recent successes with dry yeast without a controlled
study.  I seem to recall one in BT or Zymurgy some time ago.  Perhaps
it's time for another as the interest in dry yeast may pick up due to
its convenience should these studies show that quality control and
contamination issues have improved.

Subject: Danstar yeast & wort ?s


Danstar has a few dry brewers yeasts available: Windsor-Sweeter, more
flocculant and fruity than Nottingham; London-midway between
Nottingham and Windsor for attenuation and fruitiness.
There may be one other, the tiny gray cells are failing me this AM.


On the question of how to pronounce "wort", my Ger/Eng dictionary
says "wurze (u-umlaut)-seasoning, (brewer's)flavoring, dressing;
wort." Wort in the Americanized pronounciation would most easily
said "wert"(Websters pronounciation), though probably more properly said
"voort" double o's like in boot. Though in all practical
applications I understand when people say "wart" "vert" "vart" "woort".
   A wort by any other name would smell as sweet.

Subject: Brass/Lead Fallout


All-
        By asking the brass/lead question, I was by no means whatsoever
trying to impugn the brewing-related products that people here on the
digest sell! I am not trying to smear anybody!!! I apologize if people
think that is the case.            
        
        It just struck me as rather interesting that posters have always
seemed more worried about aluminum in their beer than lead. Up to to this
point, I have not heard a peep that "deleaded" (or not) brass is safe in
the long run. Frankly, I would have thought that since lead ingestion has
been proven to be a poison for humans, that someone would have tested
brass. 
        
        I feel I have asked a perfectly valid question. Others have
(rudely) thought not.

I use a 60 qt for my boiler and a 32 qt for HLT.  The 32 qt
used to be my boiler.  They clean well using standard
scrub pads (I use Scotch brite but any non steel pads
should work).  No noticeable staining.  The bottom of the
pot can get a little discolored, but more from the burner
and stand than the heat (the wort is absorbed the heat).


Mine have minor pitting but it's more because of
galvanic effects of Al, Cu, brass and SS (these are
the metals that I use of various fittings).  The worst
seems to be Cu to Al contact areas, like where I used to
tie a copper Chore Boy on the end of my drain tube.  I
don't expect the pitting to get thru the pot anytime soon
and it will probably last my entire brew career.  I don't
think you're as likely to see the problem in the HLT
as that usually contains water only.


I think Al is a great metal.  It is easily workable,
cheaper than SS.  Just be careful with caustic cleaners.
I've never had to use more than a scrub pad.

Earlier this year I brewed an alt with Nottingham, just to see what it would be
like. The results were mixed.


Positives: very low esters, even though we had an unusually hot day (90F in
mid-May) and it fermented at ~72F.


Negatives: quite neutral, quite dry--even though I mashed at 156F. Very
different results from using #1338 which adds a substantial malty flavor and
isn't so dry.


The verdict: a good beer, but not what I was looking for. I'll stick to #1338
for alts.

My alt experiment was worthwhile in that I used the primary Nottingham yeast
cake for my barleywine. My lag time was less than 1/2 hour! I had to add a
blow-off tube even though it was a five gallon batch in a seven gallon bucket.
It went from 1.095 to 1.028 in a few days (1.025 after several weeks in a
secondary).


The barleywine has been quite well received. I'm going to enter it in my club's
competition next May (when it will be a year old). I'm going to have a hard
time keeping it around that long. It has tasted great since I racked it to the
secondary!


If you're bored, the recipe may be found at my homepage
http://www.ez-net.com/~marnold under the All-Grain recipes section (although it
is a "partial" mash).

A local brewery here uses Nottingham for all the beers, even an award-winning
Bock. I tried using it for a German Pils and found out two things 1) Nottingham
does a pretty good imitation of a lager yeast, 2) Making a good German Pils is
an exercise in balance which I failed. Good beer, but not much of a German Pils
('course, that's MY fault, not the yeasts).

Don't let the cost of the tank fool you.  Most places swap tanks/bottles,
so
the next time you take in the empty it will cost only $7-$10, depending
upon your area and supplier.


I actually had my CO2 set-up before I had kegs.  Once you get everything

Adam-
        Here is a synopsis of my journey looking for good (read: heavy
duty) aluminum stock pots - I browsed the net and found 2 companies
selling large capacity heavy duty al pots: Vollrath and Lincoln/Wearever.
Also, after talking to Bill at MovingBrews(N.A.,Y.Y.Y), Polarware has just
entered the game. I have not seen the Polarware products. I compared the
Vollraths and the WearEvers - The Vollraths are 1 gauge vs. WearEver at 2
gauge (.281" vs. .250", respectively). Also, the Vollraths are nearly HALF
the price of the WearEvers. Let's see, thicker, much cheaper, I guess I'll
flip a coin...and the Vollraths win!


        BTW - Heavy duty al pots are NOT cheaper than ss. The prices of
the WearEvers are absolutely breathtaking, and the Vollraths are not
cheap. Standard duty al is quite a bit cheaper, but not inexpensive. Try
auctions at restaurants going out of business. I've had no luck at flea
markets and garage sales, but you never know.


        Probably the only way you can actually purchase the things new is
through a restaurant supply distributor (what I did).

Subject: Aluminum pots (Xmas draws near)


Jay Spies wants a Santa to bring him a new big brew pot.  But he's
concerned about aluminum and wants to hear from someone who owns one.


Jay,


I've been using an aluminum pot for a HLT and boiling kettle for a few
years now.  It's great.  Conducts the heat well, is lightweight, and cleans
up with a soapy sponge.  I have noticed a little bit of pitting if I get
lazy and leave the last of the wort (with hops and trub) overnight before
cleaning.  So now I at least rinse the pot before I set it aside.  I have
never noticed any detrimental effect on my beers (an neither have the
judges when I've entered brews).  All in all, I'm a happy customer.
Aluminum is a lot less expensive than stainless, and the light weight is a
real back saver.


Even though I've considered it, I have not actually tried to modify my
aluminum pot in any way.  If you want to modify your pot to accomodate a
spigot or other accessory, I have seen where others have done this.  You
might start by reading the archived post by John Schnupp.  He provided some
details in HBD#2750 (Subject: Re: Kettle outflow without welding).  There
are probably other good posts on this subjet in the HBD archive as well.
AlK also has a detailed description of a weld-free bulkhead fitting on his
web site.  There are others.

Rick, you are on the right track.  Proper calibration of a thermometer
indeed should be based on a reliable source for calibration.  This is why
most people suggest using and ice bath to calibrate at 0C/32F, or a boiling
water bath to calibrate at 100C/212F.  We all know the melting point and
boiling point of water, so we use them as benchmarks to calibrate our
thermometers.  So far so good, but by using this method we are calibrating
our thermometers at temperatures that are far away from where we need them
to be accurate.  Thermometers are not perfect.  How many of you have
adjusted the calibration of your bimetal brewing thermometers so that an
ice bath reads a perfect 0C/32F, only to find that it doesn't read exactly
100C/212F in boiling water (even accounting for differences in altitude)?
I would bet that this is a common event.  Thermometers should be calibrated
against a reliable standard IN THE RANGE OF USE FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED
(sorry to shout, I just needed to add emphasis).  So to calibrate your
brewing thermometer you should calibrate against a standard that you know
is accurate at mashing/sparging temperatures, say in the range of 95F/35C
to 170F/77C.  So Rick is right on track when he chose a "people
thermometer" to calibrate his brewing thermometer.  Sure is a lot closer to
mash temps than ice!


There is a problem in using a "people thermometer," however.  Most clinical
thermometers are made to record the highest temperature and stay there
(this is why you have to "shake them down" to get the mercury back into the
bulb).  So if you try to calibrate with a "people thermometer" in 98F
water, and the water cools while it's sitting there, the water may actually
be cooler than 98F by the time you set the calibration on your brewing
thermometer (even though the "people thermometer" says it's still 98F).  So
all your temps will actually be lower than what your newly calibrated
brewing thermometer says.  Could be a problem for mashing.


The proper way to calibrate a thermometer is to start with a standard
reference.  These are called "NIST traceable" thermometers.  NIST is the
National Institute of Standards and Technology, formerly the National
Bureau of Standards.  You can buy NIST traceable thermometers from
scientific supply catalogs for a few dollars more than a regular lab
thermometer (don't get "Primary Reference Standards" unless you want to
spend $200+ for a thermometer).  You don't use the NIST traceable
thermometer in your mash, you only use it to calibrate your other
thermometers.  To ensure accuracy, you should calibrate all your bimetal
thermometers periodically (every few months or after each time it's dropped
on the floor, whichever comes first).  For a liquid thermometer, once you
have calibrated it, you're done calibrating it forever (unless it becomes
damaged).  You simply note how far off it is from the NIST traceable and
use that to correct the reading.  In this way, all your thermometers become
"NIST traceable;" you connect them to the NIST traceable standard yourself.




You should use a NIST traceable thermometer that just covers the
temperatures of interest.  The narrower the range of the thermometer, the
more accurate your readings.  This is the rule for liquid-filled
thermometers (and for thermometers in general).  Usually thermometers are
accurate to within +/- one calibration mark.  So, if the scale is marked
every tenth of a degree, the actual temperature is within a tenth of a
degree of the reading - if the calibration is marked every 2 degrees, than
your actual temp is within 2 degrees of the reading.


Be sure to get a partial immersion thermometer (not a total immersion).
Partial immersion thermometers are meant to give the proper reading when
they are immersed to a specific depth, usually 100mm (there's a line there
to tell you proper immersion depth).  This is what you want to do when you
calibrate your brewing thermometers.  If you use a total immersion
thermometer that is only partially immersed, you will get inaccurate
readings.  (I know this should be obvious, but) be sure to allow the
temperature reading on any thermometer to stabilize.


Bimetal thermometers are notoriously inaccurate right out of the box.  I
don't think I've ever had one that didn't need adjusting.  I've also had
them go bad on me, that is, become un-calibratable (if that's a word).
Periodic checking is the best way to guarantee accuracy.


If you don't want to rely on your bimetal thermometer for accuracy, you can
use it to get close to your desired temperature and then check the temp
with a more accurate liquid-filled thermometer to know that you have hit
your target.  Again, I don't recommend using your NIST traceable for this;
use one you calibrated.


A suggestion:  Since you only need to take the NIST traceable out of its
secure home every few months, it seems to me to be a good thing for a
homebrew club to buy and loan to its members.  Just a thought for those of
you in active clubs.


Sorry to be so long-winded about all this, but I hope this info is useful
for some of you.  I've learned a lot from this forum, and I hope I can give
back a little.


Good luck and good (accurate) brewing,

Jay Spies asked about using aluminum kettles and mentioned a 20 gallon aluminum
stock pot costing US$140.  I didn't think a legal converted Sanke from SABCO or
others cost any more than that.  Granted it is only 15.5 gallons but very
durable.  Of course, as has been pointed out before, the heat transfer in
aluminum is much better than in SS.  I would still look into the converted
kegs.  I have SABCO units and like them.  I don't use caustics so I guess
aluminum would do as well except for perhaps being more prone to denting.
The converted kegs I use have thermometers and drains fitted which would have
to be added to the aluminum pot (if you wanted them).

That will be too dark by a good bit.  Alts are dark copper to light brown
(excepting Sticke).  Dornbusch's book (despite its shortcomings pointed out
here) gives only one all-Munich recipe - one that uses an unusually light
Munich at 6.5L.  I'm not sure how dark Weyermann's dark Munich is, but I
think it's at least double that.  Durst's is16L.  I used 100% Durst dark
Munich for a Dunkel and it is a deep brown (and very good).  Decoction will
make it even darker.


I'd suggest regular Munich (~8L)  and some Vienna (~3.5L) or Pils (~1.4L),
but I hasten to admit that I've had only one authentic Alt (swingtop hand
carried from D'dorf).  Save the dark Munich for Dunkels or Bocks.

Subject: Darcy' Law Rules


I am sorry if I was the one who started down the path of looking at 
*micro-velocities* of wort traveling through a grain bed.  However that 
tangent path aside, Darcy*s law is the law that describes the flow of wort 
through a grain bed.  It*s as simple as that.  The fact is that Darcy*s 
law was developed specifically to describe flow through a porous media, 
WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK AT MICRO EFFECTS.  The law is used to predict 
volumetric flow rate (Q) based on three terms:


Q = KiA 


Q = Volumetric flow rate


i = Hydraulic Gradient


A = Cross-sectional area of flow


K = Coefficient of hydraulic conductivity


Flow rate (Q), gradient (i), and area (A) can be measured directly.  The 
third term (K) can*t really be measured directly, but isn*t to hard to 
come up with.  Hydraulic gradient (i) in a lauter tun can be measured with 
a tape measure.   i = dh/dl with dh being the difference in head (the 
vertical distance from the surface of the sparge water level to the lauter 
outlet) and dl being the distance of flow (grain bed thickness).  Usually 
dh will be equal to or slightly greater that dl because the level of the 
sparge water is usually at or slightly above the top of the grain bed in 
most sparge set-ups.  Anyway, both of these values can be easily measured 
*in the field*.  


The cross-sectional area of flow (A)is  easy enough to determine with a 
tape measure and a calculator.


The tough value to determine is K, the coefficient of hydraulic 
conductivity of you grain bed and lauter set up.  Some purists may
insist that in this case, K is not a true coefficient of hydraulic 
conductivity because we are measuring the effects of false bottoms, 
valves, etc. in additiona to that of the grain bed.  So lets call it 
*system permeability* for lack of a better term.


This is what makes Darcy*s law so appropriate to apply: if you know Q, i, 
and A, you can determine K.  All you have to do is measure Q with a 
graduated measuring cup and a stop watch and then divide that number by i 
and A.  Remember to use consistent units.  


So with a tape measure and a little math, it is easy to determine K for 
your lauter set-up.  Once you have a value of K determined for your 
system, you can use it to predict the flow rate for various grain bed 
depths and sparge water depths.


The only valid point Mr. Murman makes in his musings (provided below for 
clarity), is that the valve does have some effect on the flow.  However, 
that doesn*t matter because we are determining our K values for the entire 
sparge set-up (including grain, false bottom, outlet screens, valves, 
etc.).


>Folks keep bringing up Darcy's Law and how it relates to lauter design. 
 >IMO, it's irrelevant to the problem. 


Your opinion is wrong.  Darcy*s law is completely relevant.  And that is 
not my opinion, it is a fact.  You may not NEED to apply Darcy*s law 
because you do not care about *predicting* the flow rate through your 
system when you can control the flow rate with a valve.  But none the 
less, it is completely applicable to analyzing the flow rate through a 
lauter system.


>What the micro-flow (and diffusion, etc.) between each grain particle 
>looks like, while it may be interesting, is not significant for predicting
 >how the macro-flow of sparge liquer through a lauter tun will look. 


I completely agree with the above statement (except for the part about 
this being interesting ;).  By applying Darcy*s law you do not need to 
know anything about what *micro-flow (and diffusion, etc.) between each 
grain particle looks like*.


>We do know exactly the downward mean velocity through the lauter >tun, 
because we control it with our outlet valve.  There isn't a >*discharge 
coefficient" involved in the macro-flow - I can raise the >mean velocity 
through the grainbed simply by opening my valve. 


As I have indicated above, Darcy*s law is a macro law by definition.  You 
do not need to measure (or know) anything about micro-velocities to apply 
Darcy*s law to your sparge set up.  You can derive micro-velocities from 
the equation if you want to, but that isn*t really what it is intended 
for.


>I think it's possible to achieve an exit velocity that's pretty darn 
close to >the maximum predicted by ignoring the grain completely.


To determine the *maximum predicted exit velocity* you will need to apply 
Darcy*s law and determine K for your system.  In the end you may find out 
that the restrictive effects of the valve are much greater than any head 
losses resulting from the wort flowing though the grain bed, but Darcy's 
law still applies.


Brew on,

A few posters have commented on 'a brown dirt-like substance' in canvas bags.
While I'm not positive, this sounds remarkably like clay, as in kitty litter.
The cheap kind (the green stuff has alfalfa in it).  It's so cheap it's
probably not worth baking in the oven to dry out.  Even if its not as
effective since its in chunks instead of dust, it should be a decent
dessicant.


How about some of the chest freezer folks give it a test and let us know the
results.  Whoever had the cat fall in their fermenting beer once, please keep
the lid on your freezer!!


Also, I believe the chemical in damp rid is calcium chloride (one type of ice
melt) or  maybe potassium chloride (sometimes available for water softeners),
but I'm not sure I can remember (used to have  a boat and stopped buying the
damp rid salt once I learned what it was and used the much cheaper
alternative).  More scientific testing is encouraged!

Subject: Nottingham in a Weizen?


on the Nottingham thread, Herbert Bresler writes:


"I have never used this yeast, but have been interested in it ever since
I
took a brewpub tour in San Diego and nearby environs last March.  I
visited
at least 10 different brewpubs, and I think at least half of them were
using Nottingham yeast almost exclusively.  Many different styles, all
good
to excellent beers, with only Nottingham!  One brewer even brewed his
Hefe-Weizen with it and it was fabulous.  He managed to get the esters
just
right by controlling fermentation temps, mash schedule and grain
selection."


With regard to using Nottingham in the  Hefe-Weizen - one of the
qualities that has been mentioned here lately is that Nottingham is a
very clean fermenting yeast. Someone likened it to a dry version of1056.
How does this fit with a weizen? Most of the flavors characteristic of a
hefe-weizen are directly attributable to the yeast (although you've
gotta have that wheat!). Herbert mentions controlling fermentation temps
 - cooler temps are going to produce a cleaner fermentation, warmer temps
would be likely to produce more esters but I would expect a fruity
character -  not the cloves, bananas and bubblegum we look for in a
hefe-weizen. It is hard enough to get a good balance of these flavors
using Wheinstephen yeast. Nottingham may be a great choice for many
diverse styles, but I have a little trouble imagining using it in a
weizen.


On another subject, I'd also like to chime in with thanks to Karl and
Pat for the great job they do. They deserve a raise ... we should at
least double what they get now. Seriously though, think about how you
felt a few weeks ago when you didn't receive your HBD fix, I know it

some money this holiday season. Think of it as a gift subscription - to
yourself. The janitors haven't asked for funds but I don't know of any
computer that can't be upgraded, certainly not any computer geek who
wouldn't love more toys on his system. What do you say Karl? Pat? would

Andrew, before you buy a CO2 cylinder, talk to the people at the welding
supply shop again. Some shops don't fill on premises. Especially chain type
operations. They may have one shop that fills for all of their stores. This
means that you have to bring your tank in, drop it off, and wait for them to
get it back in. They may or may not have the five pound cylinders always on
hand that you can just swap your empty for a full one. But they usually have
the larger size on hand for the people that use them in MIG welding. Also, the
shop I use considers five pounders an oddball size and charge the same price
to fill a five pound or larger cylinder. The fives are a handy size to take to
a party. But, if you can save the difference in the price between a five pound
or larger size cylinder in a half dozen or so refills, it might make sense to
go with the larger size. Also, there may be advantages to leasing instead of
buying a cylinder. Inspection and hydrostat test at about $50 or so every 5
years. If you buy, you're responsible for the test. If you lease, they take
care of it. Another source to check is fire extinguisher places. A fire
extinguisher is basically a gas cylinder with a different type valve on it.
Some fire extinguisher companies will replace the valve and set you up with a
CO2 tank much more reasonably than a welding supply shop. Might be an odd size
like 7 pound or something and you would have to get it refilled where you got
it. Check the Mom and Pop type fire extinguisher companies and not the chain
type operations

Hi Boys and Girls,
  Last weekend I put together what looked like a great cider recipe using 4

Brown Sugar. I boiled 1 and 1/2 gallons of water, dissolved the brown sugar

one pint of boiled water (cooled to 105deg) and 2T corn sugar, according to

real good. After 4 days of no airlock action (and the gravity remaining at
1.052), I rehydrated another pack of wine yeast (this time following the

single bubble escape, but nothing spectacular. I believe I've done a good job

Second, I was wondering if it would be better to have a shorter length of 1/2"
