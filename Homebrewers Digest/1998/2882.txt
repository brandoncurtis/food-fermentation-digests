I've read that malted rye can impart a harsh taste. I think it was in an
article about the Redhook Brewery. The brewer was discussing Redhook's Ryehook
ale and recommended flaked rye for a smoother flavor.
Don't kill yourself trying to find malted rye. I actually went to the trouble
of malting my own once (I still have it in a jar somewhere) and I can tell you
that you will have some trouble with milling the grain. It is quite hard and
it will have to be milled separately because the grains are much smaller than
barley. So why go to the trouble of changing the setting of your mill (or
talking your homebrew supplier into changing his/her mill setting) when you
can get good results with flaked rye?
One more thing---A little goes a long way. I recommend between 10% to 25%. 10%
flaked in a lighter beer provides a good amount of rye flavor with little or
no run-off problems. I recommend doing a bete-glucan rest at ~108-112 degrees
F for 20-30 minutes because the rye can create an extra-thick mouth-feel that
is inappropriate in a lighter beer. Check out my Roggen Pils recipe at The
Brewery---http://brewery.org/gambmug/recs/322.html

If Fred believes this works for him then I believe it works for him, 
but I don't believe it will work for me or for many other people.  That 
98.6 F figure (which is exactly equal to 37.0 C, a fact which alone 
should make us suspicious) is a momily about as reliable as pulse 72 or 
BP 120/80. People are just not sufficiently uniform to be a satisfactory 
standard for anything as touchy as mash temperature.  


I am more than a bit hyper about this because my "normal" body temper-
ature is around 96.8 F.  Most people to whom I tell this believe I'm 
just transposing those last two digits and that I'm malingering when I 
claim to be sick at 98.6 F.  This caused me so much grief throughout my 
childhood that one of the great rewards of early adulthood was being 
able to give the finger to the bigots who disbelieved me on this point.


I think that anyone who believes 37 C is a useful calibration point for 
a brewing thermometer should follow the advice of Frederick L. Pauly 
<flp2m`at`avery.med.virginia.edu> in HBD #2877 or that of Herbert Bresler 
<bresler.7`at`osu.edu> in HBD #2880.  


The electronic fever ("clinical") thermometers available nowadays seem 
not to have the "lock on max" feature Herb mentions.  The one I have is 
consistently within 0.2 F of my traditional mercury fever thermometer 
but I have no idea whether that is typical performance.

I just wanted to thank everyone for their advice on Wyeast 2308-Munich. To
summarize the suggestions: ferment cool (50F), a diacetyl rest is
mandatory, huge sulfur production should be expected, and be prepared to
lager for months. Many said that if you follow all the above advice, you
will get an award winning Lager and many called this yeast their favorite.

paul, take it down a notch.  what scott is saying is that flow rate at the
bottom of the lauter tun is not the quantity being sought.  what john palmer
was trying to show in his experiment was how the mash liquor drains through
every part of the lauter tun.  and in that case, d'arcy's law is completely
irrelevant.  what you need, theoretically, is a solution describing the flow
at every point in the lauter tun so you can determine where the flow is not
reaching, and therefore where your extraction might be compromised.  a
"picture" of the flow is what john was shooting for, and that's why (i
suspect) he abandoned the theoretical approach in favor of the experimental
approach.


if you want to know the flow rate coming out of your lauter tun, just take a
measuring cup and use your wristwatch.  and use a valve so you can adjust
it.

Subject: Yet another newbie Protein Rest question


Hello one and all.


I just spent about 5 hours cruising thru the archives to
find out about protein rests.  In particular, there was
some good stuff this last January.


Most discussions centered around the protein rest's effect
on haze, and only occasionally mentioning body (the usual
comment in this regard was the potential body loss from
low temp protein rests).


My question (which I couldn't find elsewhere):


What effect on body does a 135 deg protein rest have?
In particular, what happens (to body) if a well modified
malt gets a 135 deg protein rest?


My guess to my own question is that large proteins (the
kind that would normally hot-break out) will get broken
up into more soluble proteins and contribute to body.
But obviously I don't know what I am talking about,
else I wouldn't be here!!

Subject: Sweet Beer


About a month ago I made Phil Fleming's Christmas Ale.  I probably made
a mistake by not propagating the yeast.  Instead I pitched right from
the smart pack using Wyeast 1007.  About a week into the primary
fermentation I realized that I should have used more yeast for such a
high gravity beer,(1.070+) and I repitched another smart pack and let it
sit in the primary for another week.


Last night after two weeks in the secondary I took a gravity reading
which turned out to be 1.020 which I assumed would mean that it was
probably done.  I then took a sip of the beer and it tasted like it
never fermented at all.  It tasted very sweet just like on the day that
I started to ferment it.


My question, is what should I do?  Should I give it more time?   Should
I repitch some yeast this time using the proper amount of yeast?  At
1.020 I think that it should be about done, but maybe with such a high
gravity beer it just needs at least a few more weeks in the secondary. 
This is my first attempt at a high gravity beer.


Please help I will be very greatful especially since this was a very
expensive beer to make given all of the ingredients.

Subject: Weizen Changing Character


I am a new owner of a Cornelius kegging system.  A little less than two
weeks ago I kegged my first batch (a weizen) in the Corny and stored it
at a stable 46 F. under 18 lb. of pressure to condition.  After 4 days I


tried it and was immediately impressed by the wonderful banana and
clove-like characters of this beer.  This is my first weizen, I've made
several other beers over the past year, always brown ales.  Now, just
one week later I am wondering what happened to the banana and clove
notes?  It is still a very nice drinkable beer, but the overall
character has changed seemingly overnight.


Although the beer is still not sparkling clear (I used liquid hefeweizen


yeast), it has cleared steadily over the past week, no doubt due to the
settling of the yeast in the corny.  Did the characteristics I am
missing go the way of the yeast, consumed during the first week?  Or is
this just a natural process of the beer conditioning over time?  This is


the first beer of this style I've brewed.  Maybe I've just not noticed
the similarly changing character of the previous (hoppier) ales I've
made.  Can someone shed some light on this?

Subject: single infusion vs step mash


Well I thought I was going to scoope the HBD with this big news
item but Dave Draper beat me to it.
I have been wondering for a long time about the step mash vs
single temp mash with well modified malts. What does it add to
the beer besides possibly more effeciency?
So I experimented.
Usually I do 10 gallon all grain batches. For the experiment I
split the grain bill in half and using the same yeast culture,
made 2 5 gallon batches that fermented side by side. Now,    one
month old I tasted them and found no difference between them.
It was a pale ale and one was mashed at 154F while the other was
stepped through 135F 10min  148 15min 158 20min then 165 for
10nmin. All the temperature rests, to my amazement, were hit
right on. 
Of course this is just one experiment but it helps me feel more
comfortable doing my single infusions for my ales with well
modified malts.
All those opposed, please, fire away.

Subject: Rye malt vs flaked rye


Eric, because RYE (secale cereale ) is a strongly flavored grain, I
recommend not to use more than 15% in your recipe; later on,
you can increase the rye level; per your tasting.
As with Wheat Malt, Rye has no husk, therefore can create problems
during mashing and lautering. Also, Rye has a lot of  beta - glucans,
which increase the wort viscosity and will create problems during
run off; filtration ; and can cost flavor problems.
During my apprenticeship in Germany we brewed a Roggen Bier,
using 80% 2 - Row Pilsener Malt, and 20% Roggen (Rye).
Because the Pilsener Malt was undermodified, we applied a
single decoction mashing. I remembered some long Brewing
days when brewing Roggen Bier - but, when the Bier was
finished and we had the chance to taste the nectar, it made up
for al the long hours on the kettles.
I do recommend to start brewing with Rye Malt.
The first source that comes to my mind would be MidAmerica
Brewing Supply in MN (they don't pay me to name them),
ask for Jim or Jerry, and if they don't have it, they can give you
a source.    Good Luck

Dave, in order to convert, you need a pool of enzymes. Maybe
the Malt used did not have enough to do the job.
Ask your supplier for the lot analysis of that particular malt
and see what the enzyme levels are.




 ...............the idea behind the decoction


The idea behind decoction mashing comes from Europe
(mostly Germany), where most Malts are undermodified,
and this type of mashing regime is necessary.


 .............................with a grist comprised  of 75% HB Munich
and 12% DWC Pils, I found that  conversion (even at 158F) was sluggish.


Dave, again as in your first question, I think the malt used has
not enough enzymes to do the job correctly.
