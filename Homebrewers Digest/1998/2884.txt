    I know that prices may vary in different areas of the country for the same

was $24, including a refill. Test alone is $14.  I know when I originally

But when I had this bottle tested, I asked about the failure rate and was told
they don't see many failures. Granted, this is but one shop in my area, but my
previous and ongoing experience with SCUBA tanks (which are subject to the
same test) leads me to believe they last a LONG time. I have one SCUBA tank
that was used when I got it back in 1963 and it still passes it's test. Just
my $.02 worth.

Subject: Yeast propagation


Sorry, I am a few weeks behind in reading my hbd's.  I have some
questions relating to the creating and storing of wort for yeast
starters.  The posts were concentrated around canning wort, and
refridgerating it for later usage.  First question I have, I have never
canned anything.  Any special equipment involved in the canning
process.  I know there are jars and lids/seals involved.   How do you go
about canning wort?  Any help would be appreciated.


There was no discussion on creating wort, and directly bottling it in
sanitized bottles.  My thoughts were to create a batch the size
necessary to fully step up my starter, then bottle & fridge the wort. 
This wort wouldn't be around for more than the "week" needed to step up
the culture for pitching.  Why wouldn't this method work?

Subject: Metallic flavors / Aluminum / Printing what others write


     Hi all,
     
     Ed asks why his last batch of beer has a metallic flavor.  He says 
     that it fades away if the glass is allowed to sit a couple of minutes.
     He notes that the appearance of the off-flavor coincides with a change 
     in his cleaning regimen.
     
     Metallic flavors are most often the result of oxidation, not exposure 
     of the wort to metal.  The First George (Fix, that is) has written a 
     rather nice article about oxidation in the most recent issue of 
     Brewing Techniques.  This is complemented nicely by Scott Bickham's 
     flavor-series article about oxidation flavors (earlier this year in 
     BT).
     
     By the way, the picture of the brewer on the title page of my BT 
     article this month is NOT me!  My picture is at the end of the article 
     in a little 1" square box.  My brewery really is the 40 square foot 
     kitchen that is pictured in the article, though.
     ------------------------------
     Some people have been wondering if Aluminum can be used for brewery 
     vessels.  Yes, it can.  The major reasons aluminum is not often used 
     in commercial operations:
     
     1.  It is quickly corroded by most cleaning agents used in Clean In 
     Place (CIP) systems.
     
     2.  It is softer and more easily damaged than stainless.
     
     3.  It is not a strong as stainless (structurally).
     
     Wolfgang Kunze, in his text, _Technology Malting and Brewing_, says 
     that aluminum will impart no off-flavors to beer or wort.
     
     Eric Warner (Weihenstephen grad, writer, and all-around great brewer) 
     won a gold medal at the AHA NHC a few years back with a Weizen that 
     was fermented in an aluminum vessel.

     I occasionally get requests from people to reprint my writing in 
     various places.  I appreciate (and always say "yes") to such requests. 
      I have noticed a bunch of web sites that have printed my writing 
     without permission, though (including some commercial enterprises).  
     You know who you are.
     
     The reason this upsets me is because what I write here is not always 
     up to my usual standards of grammar and basic good writing.  I don't 
     like to be represented on some stranger's web site like that.  If you 
     ask permission, I can fix things like typos, etc.  I also don't like 
     the idea of my writing being used for commercial purposes without any 
     kind of compensation (not even a "thank you").  I realize that there 
     is little I can do about this in the modern age, but I will remind 
     folks that a little courtesy goes a long way.

bas,
I think I remember reading in the Belgian Ale style book that Westmalle
uses the same yeast throughout their process (including bottle
conditioning) and for all their beers.  It seems that the Wyeast Trappist
High Gravity strain is Westmalle yeast. I copied the stats below from the
web page at
http://www.best.com/~smurman/zymurgy/wyeast.html


Wyeast 3787 -- Trappist High Gravity
Robust top cropping yeast with phenolic character.
Alcohol tolerance to 12%, ideal for Biere de Garde, ferments dry
with rich ester profile and malty palate.
 Temperature range: 64-78F
 Apparent attenuation: 75-80%.
 Flocculation: medium.
 Source: Westmalle


I have a starter culture growing right now, but have not yet brewed with
it.  I found it to be a little slow to swell in the package, but a fast
fermenter in the starter wort (O.G. 1.040).  I don't think I'd go to the
trouble to culture up from a bottle since I can get the same strain from
Wyeast much easier (but perhaps not as much fun).


I hope this helps.
Good luck and good brewing,

I don't think vigorously abrading the pot is a valid representation of what
happens when you boil wort (or anything, for that matter), and I don't
believe you can conclude the "grey gunk" (aluminium oxide?) is getting into
your beer from this experiment.  I've brewed in both aluminium and stainless
steel, and have never detected any flavor defect attributable to the former.

You got yo' self a King Kooker.  It's plenty hot (I think around 130K
BTU's??) but the flame control is nil.  That plate thingy is swung in
place to (I think) divert some of the heat off of the pinpoint-sized
location where the flames normally go.  If I were you, I'd go for the
copper manifold because if you do step mashes, you'll be doing *plenty*
of frenzied stirring, and I can just see you whacking the fragile
easymasher into oblivion, and with 20 or so pounds of grist on top,
digging it out is bound to be somewhat, uh, frustrating.


Scorching is likely to be a factor, and it will darken the beer (not a
big deal if it's a dark beer, but a big deal if you're doing a CAP or a
German Pilsner) and denature some of the enzymes (not sure of the
potential ramifications here), and worst on my list, provide you with
considerable headache scrubbing out the burnt gunk.  I'd either do
single infusion or try to adjust the flame down as much as you can.

Subject: CO2 toxicity to yeast


About a year ago it seems, there was a thread on CO2 toxicity to yeast.


I have a data point.  I acknowledge up front this is not a rigorous scientific
method experiment (wasn't experimenting, I was brewing!), but its probably
pretty good as far as anecdotal evidence goes.


Brewed a helles type lager, 11gal, split into two 6.7 gal carboys (as usual),
same temp (low 50s), same yeast (American Lager by Wyeast), same amount of
yeast (sludge from 1 gal starter into each carboy), same oxygenation routine
(2 min pure O2 through stone).


Difference:  allowed wort to settle for a few hours, siphoning carefully from
just below surface. First carboy was very bright, second was fine until I
sucked in some trub and hop sludge, ending up with a turbid  wort.  I kept
track of which was which because I was curious to see if there would be a
flavor difference.


After 10 days, I was planning to keg (my lagers always have finished 7-10
days), but, as always checked gravity before siphoning.  Turbid carboy  FG
1.014 (OG was 1.053 by the way), perfect.  Bright carboy 1.030! with no real
activity present (both carboys had clumps of foam that had been there for a
couple of days).


Now, first line of thinking is, 'so the trub allowed the yeast to synthesize
sterols (I think that's right) and all you have is an
underpitched/underoxygenated wort situation (systemic error).'  BUT, I
agitated the carboy to drive out the CO2, (also resuspending the yeast).  NEXT
DAY, SG down to 1.024, and no trub added, which lends support to the CO2
concentration affecting the yeast theory.  So I've racked it to drive out more
CO2 (taking most of the yeast along cause I still need it to finish).  Almost
racked onto the turbid carboy's dregs, but chickened out.


Never had this problem before, but also never so carefully siphoned the wort.
Used to just drop the tube in and both carboys got a load of trub and hops.
In this unintentional experiment it seems that most variables have been
eliminated (approximately equal situations-not lab quality data to demonstrate
splits were equal), EXCEPT for rising CO2 concentration.  So maybe that's
something to keep in mind.  Don't get your wort too bright, especially if
making lagers where the cold temps will hold a higher CO2 concentration that
may impede the progress of the yeast.


Just for info.

Subject:  Weizen question


Someone asked about Weizen losing its banana clove note quickly.  Yep, I seem
to notice Weizen has a remarkably short shelf life with respect to these
flavors, although I don't notice them vanishing for a couple months.  I used
to brew 10 gals at a time, but now only brew 5 gals of weizen since I really
like the ester's,  and they don't last .  The last keg/case never as good.  So
your Weizen sounds normal (and I've brewed lots), just drink it quick.  I do
find keeping the yeast roused helps,which is why I tend to bottle weizen,
getting good at the german inverted bottle pour into a weizen glass.

Subject: An idea I had for computerized recipe exchange


Hello Brewers,


Being a home-brewer and computer programmer has led me to explore the
various recipe calculators that are out there.  While many of them do a good
job formulating, printing, and saving recipes, none I have found enables
true sharing of recipes between brewers.  Sure, I can add a recipe to the
Recipator at brewery.org, or submit it to Cats Meow, but then it's just a
text recipe for others to use.  No program out there, that I know of, allows
you to pull a recipe from the web and work with it on your home PC without
typing it in again.  (Please correct me if I'm wrong on this!)  In other
words, I want to get a recipe from the web, have it import directly into my
homebrew software, and work with it for a new batch.  I should then be able
to upload the batch recipe back to the original web site.


I've got an idea that I want to start batting around with any of you who
like to use computers in your homebrew endevours.  XML is quickly becoming
the de-facto standard for organizing data that needs to be shared by
multiple systems.  I would like to develop an XML vocabulary for use in
storing homebrew recipe data.  Once the vocabulary is developed, I also want
to develop a few reusable components to allow software developers to add the
import/export functionality to their programs and web sites.  And of course,
I want it to be free!  :)


If any of you are interested in this, please let me know.  I can set up a
mailing list so we can discuss the topic outside this forum.

Subject: He lost...that weizen flavor... / yeast nutrient


"...he had that weizen flavor, now it's gone, gone gone..."


Several people have mentioned problems lately with Weizens losing their
wonderful character after a few weeks.  It happened to mine this year, too.
But I don't think it has anything to do with the yeast settling out.  I
think it's not the flavor of the YEAST that is missing after time, it's
that the beer chemistry is changing because the wheinstephen yeast keeps
attenuating and changing the beer past the point of it's prime.


I first read about this theory in HBD 2850 from Randy Ricchi in response to
Alan Meeker. Basically, Alan talks about how his first weizen, with a 200ml
turned out great and kept it's flavor for a _year_.  He wonders if it was
_because_ it was underpitched.  Randy argues for a somewhat underpitched
and minimally aerated weizen:

This set off bells with me because my first weizen was great, and I had it
for a month and a half and it lost no flavor.  In fact, it was awesome at
the end.  OK, so it didn't last nearly a year, but the last weizen I made I
pitched a huge starter and aerated a lot and it was fine at first but a
major disapointment after only a week or two in the keg.  I am definitely
going to slightly underpitch/under aerate next time, too.  No doubt about
the vigor of the 3068 yeast strain--it's incredible.


Incidentally, on that first weizen, I popped the 3068 smack pack at least a
week before pitching it the night before in about a 20-32 oz starter!  I
had just made a venturi tube and used that for aeration.  (not much
aeration, I'd say.)  There were a lot of other variables (first batch was
extract+ bottled, later ones have been all grain + kegged) so my mind isn't
completely made up, but I'm really curious about this.


Does anybody else have any datapoints on this?  Maybe my first weizen would
have gone south too, if I had kept it more than 6-7 weeks, but I could live
with 6-7 weeks, it's 1-2 that I have a problem with.

Thanks to everyone who posted or emailed me about my yeast nutrient
question.  (IMYNR?)  My first mead is chuging along, slowly.  BTW, the
nutrient turned out to be Fermax, rather than just diamonium phosphate.
(DAP).  So, I'm not sure if it breaks down over time or not.  I would guess
that it would to some extent.

My take on it was that the DAP itself would probably be pretty stable.  I
think it's the yeast that were in there that would have broken down over
time.  I definitely wanted to boil whatever it was, rather than add it
straight.


I used the old Fermax and I guess the mead is going alright.  There is
definitely fermentation going on, but it's more subdued than most beer
fermentations.  This is normal I suppose?

Subject: Yeast came back, Site Glass, Making ZIMA??, Runoff


Just a data point about long term storage of yeasts.  I had obtained a nice
bottom yeast in 1992 from Pierre Rajotte. I used it a few times and stored it
away under 10% sterile sucrose solution.  I started to reanimate it for a 
brew this past Saturday. I was getting worried Monday AM, no activity....
This morning - it was getting active (gas being produced).  I looked at it
under the scope to insure they were as I remembered.  Sure enough they were
looking  pretty good (size, shape and health wise).  Just a data point.




My .02cents on a site glass: if it is glass make sure you have
some protection (metal tube) for the glass.  You may be better
off using food grade plastic hose - at least it wont break
in the middle of the brew.

Filtering with sub-micro pads/cartridges in one shot could make for a
long day. Try clearing the beer of all particle matter first (gelatine,
isinglass
long cold storage, or other finings) then prefilter at least once down to 1u.
Even them submicron - youll probably want a large filter area.  Good luck...




As for lauter rates, several of the professional brewing level texts have
rates and data for runoff.  A rough guide line is runoff completes in about
2 hrs, giving a total grain/water contact time of 3 to 4 hrs.  IMHO best
results
are obtained with manifolds under a false bottom and not a manifold in the
grain
bed. Monitoring of the different aspects can be done by having two site glasses
(see above tho) to monitor suction across the false bottom, and a variable
speed 
runoff pump pulling the runoff to the kettle (via grant). But again what works
for
me wont work for everyone....


Good luck and great brewing

I Just had the opportunity to get out to NYC and happened by the Tap Room
(18th between 5th/6th).


I got a sampler of their Hefe, Marzen, Pils, and Helles (Dunkel and Bock
were out). The Hefe was wonderful with nice bananna and clove aromas and
flavors (clove a bit heavy for me), a little phenolic (band-aid I think)
right up front but faded quickly. Pleasant and suprisingly hoppy aftertaste.


The Marzen, Helles, and Pils were each good in their own right. Stylistic
considerations aside, the phenolic flavor upfront carried through to each
brew. Fine in a Hefe, but not so in a Pils. The Marzen, Pils and Helles also
lacked that lager crispness and clean body/texture that I would expect.


Any HBDr's been there recently? Did you taste the same thing? ... would it
be attributed to extraction in the mash or sanitation? I'd like to hear some
opinions.

Hi all,


A friend of mine and I have been discussing the question of copper somehow
leaching into wort during the brewing process.


Says he:
>I have mostly SS in my RIM system but I still use a little copper here and

>with this and noticed the same?


To which I replied:
**********
I notice the same thing with the copper in my system (strainer tube that I
fashioned and my immersion chiller), but I'm not sure if it's copper oxide
or just gunk from the brewing process.


I just thought of a way I could test this out:  copper in solution is blue.
I'll wipe/scrape off some of that gunk and mix it up with a little water and
maybe a little lactic acid (maybe it will help it dissolve), and see what
colour it turns.  I'll get back to you when I do this.
**********

I do appreciate Dave's attempt at covering both his and my positions on
this topic.  It *almost* eliminated the need for me to post a rebuttal.


Dave is right that my objection to his method is because some of the
priming sugar can be consumed.  I contend that some of the priming sugar
*will* be consumed and you *will* get variations in carbonation even from
something as simple as waiting 10 or 14 rather than 12 hours or by
storing this "primer starter" a few degrees warmer or cooler than last
time.  I further contend that since Dave kegs most of his beer (by his
own admission in HBD), variations in carbonation are unlikely to be
noticed and would even-out when the been began to be served under external
CO2 pressure.


Dave claims that doing it the way I suggest produces an unreliable
carbonation.  This is incorrect.  I have posted numerous times on the
fact that high-gravity (and thus high-alcohol) beers are going to have
some difficulty with carbonation.  I even posted on some of my own
experiences with this phenomenon with some *very* high OG beers (one
was 1.120!).  The *correct* way to prime with actively fermenting yeast 
is to begin not with a few tablespoons of DME and a measured amount
of priming sugar, but rather make up a small batch of beer in which you
know the OG and expected FG.  You start this batch fermenting and then
you measure its SG.  You then calculate how many SG points remain in
this mini batch and with that you can determine how many ounces of this
fermenting beer you would need to add to the main batch to prime it
properly.  No guesswork... you are priming with actively fermenting
beer and you are adding a measured and predictable amount of fermentable
sugars for the purpose of priming.  Incidentally... you may have heard
of this technique.  It's called *kraeusening*.  All other definitions
or differing descriptions of this technique are *not* kraeusening.


I don't have the time at this moment to describe this technique in
real numbers (i.e. how to calculate how much of the fermenting beer
to add), but if there is interest (email me privately), I'll write
something up and ***post*** it to the HBD when I have a bit more time.

See above.  Its variability would be far more evident when bottling
than when kegging as you typically do.

Oh, it's okay for you to suggest something you haven't tried personally,
but I can't criticise something that I know from experience has flaws?


Also, I've mentioned this before... there is no need (or desire) for
yeast growth at bottling time.  In fact, we would like to discourage
yeast growth because it only means more sediment at the bottom of each
bottle.  It is a moot point however, because properly done, you would
not be introducing much oxygen at priming time and *oxygen*, not FAN,
would be the limiting factor for yeast growth at this point in the
process.

But what if there is *considerable* unfermented (but fermentable) sugar
remaining in the wort (not just the first primings, but some left over
sugar from the main wort)?  Then your teaspoon of active yeast will
produce bottle bombs.  What were the OG and FG?  From this we can
calculate apparent attenuation and determine if you have leftover sugar
from the main ferment or not.  To simply recommend more yeast without
knowing the OG and FG is like diagnosing an illness without even getting
the patient's temperature.


As much as I razz Dave, I know he means well and I really mean it when
I say I appreciate his trying to cover both his and my positions on this
issue.
