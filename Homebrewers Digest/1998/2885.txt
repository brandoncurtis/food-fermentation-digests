Subject: crystal vs. caramel/ABG classes


Dave is right that crystal and caramel are (in modern terms) equivalent.
He incorrectly blames Briggs for this, however.


Wrong Brit, Dave.  The blame should go squarely on Young and Dr. Michael
Lewis, who wrote this misinformation in their book.


Let's all not forget that this *is* the same Dr. Michael Lewis who heads
the American Brewers' Guild (despite what it says below).


Coincidentally, I ran across a post by the well-respected Martin Lodahl
on Dr. Michael Lewis while I was looking for a writeup on kraeusening
a few minutes ago.  Recently, there was a question about whether it is
worth it to attend the American Brewers' Guild classes.  For this reason,
I'm reposting Martin's 1994 HBD post.

Who said that dextrin malts are stewed at a higher temperature?
Can you provide a reference?  This is the first I've heard of this.
Whether it is true or not is moot to the original question.
 
Let's not lose sight of the fact that the original question was...


    Will mashing crystal malts convert some of their unfermentables
    into fermentables?


The answer is, yes, although, based on Mort's post, not as much,
perhaps, as you might expect.
 
Interestingly enough, it was this question back in 1990 or so, that
prompted me to contact Dr. George Fix and ask him his opinion.  Basically,
he said that he adds crystal malts for their flavour and aroma and
controls fermentability of the wort with his mash temperatures and
not with the addition of crystal malts.
 
It's primarily extract+specialty brewers that use crystal malt to
control fermentability and this concept can take some time to abandon
when one begins brewing all-grain.

i was just given approx 6 1/2 lbs of briess wheat extract and told to try
something unusual with it. as i am not a fan of the clove/bananna/phenol of
most wheat beers i was thinking of a dunkelweizen bock using wyeast 3333
german  wheast yeast. would i be better off using more wheat extract,partial
mashing some munich malt,or using something else to bump up the fermentables
and deepen the color.? i was thinking of using mt. hood /saaz for hops.

Subject: Another source of metallic taste


Hi all,


I recently had a  couple of batches spoiled by a really nasty metallic
taste. I was therefore looking at all parts of my brewing process. I
happened to notice a splash in one of the boiling kettles (I boil with
two 5 gal SS pots on an electric stove). It came from the range hood
which was poorly installed and had been poorly cleaned and scratched
with oven cleaner in the past. I tasted the water still clinging to the
hood and it tasted wretchedly familiar. I now boil with a towel to mop
up the condensing water under the hood and ponder the completion of the
new kitchen free brewing system.

Subject: Hop Pellets


Thanks to all who responded to my frustration regarding hop pellets.  Those
who responded with equal frustration seemed to have converted from whole
leaf to pellets.  (I converted because I moved from Seattle where whole leaf
hops were more plentiful than around Dallas, where I live now)  I was using
a SS screen (easy-masher) in my kettle which allowed the whole leaf hops to
filter the trub.  Well, pellets make a SS screen, chorboy or anything else
into more of a cork than a filter.


The suggestions were:


1)  Bag the pellets so they don't get the spluge everywhere.  Pay attention
that the bag does not get stuck under the outflow pipe and scorch in the
bottom of the kettle.  (Burnt nylon does not make a nice rauchbier.)  Expect
10% degradation in hop utilization.


2)  Design the recipe one gallon larger.  Whirlpool, settle and pull from
edge with siphon or, if you have a pot with a drain, leave whatever is below
the drain.  The smaller diameter tubes (like on the easymasher) seem to get
clogged very easily, so don't put anything on the end of the 1/2 drain tube
and let her rip.


3)  Brew with whole leaf hops. (duh)


Thanks for all the input.

Subject: Lauter Tun Flow Modeling


John Palmer kindly asked me to report on lautertun flow modeling to the HBD.
Thats kinda tough without graphics, but I'll do my best.  To the best of my
knowledge, I'm the only one yet who's been goofy enough to do this, so please
consider this bit of esoterica "original research" .  Over the past 6 months
or so, I've had a pleasant email discussion with John regarding this, because
his interest in lauter design led him, like me, to work toward an efficient,
simple, and functional lautertun design.  My professional prejudice led me
toward drains, used in zillions of applications for removing fluid through
porous media.  After looking at John's empirical experiment, I attempted to
model fluid flow under constant head conditions to see if we can predict
radius of influence of drains in a typical homebrew sized lauter, and to
evaluate what configuration might be the best.  


As someone suggested, one must apply Darcy's Law at numerous points within the
grainbed to do that.  I applied MODFLOW, the U.S.G.S. Modular Finite
Difference Ground Water Model, (MacDonald and Harbaugh, 1988).


MODFLOW is a three-dimensional, unsteady state, non-homogeneous, anisotropic
flow model, perhaps the most applied three-dimensional flow model in the
world.  It is typically used to arrive at solutions of complex ground water
flow problems in areas of complicated geology and hydraulics. In this case,
the material was assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous with respect to flow,
and as a constant head case was desired, steady state was assumed. Because it
involves vertical flow, however, a numerical solution to the 3-dimensional
flow equation is warranted. 


I'll now outline the assumptions in the model for any of you who wish to
critically evaluate this work, in words I hope the layman can appreciate.
Assumptions include constant fluid potential (aka constant head) between the
sparge water surface and the drain for the majority of time during lautering.
In this model, head is held constant at the thickness of the grain,
approximately 20 cm.  The model assumes no leakage through the walls of the
lautertun.  This is called a "no-flow boundary condition", and holds true for
the sides, ends, and the bottom of the tun.


The drain is of adequate capacity to remove the sparge water.  This capacity
is approximately 0.01 m^2/sec, a typical value for drains.  Hydraulic
conductivity is a measure of the ability of grain to conduct flow.  This has
been experimentally determined (see HBD# 2069), and in this case is assigned a
value of 0.1 cm/sec. A value of  0.25 cm/sec was experimentally determined, my
previous work on this used 0.025 cm/sec as design assumption, but later work
suggested that may be too conservative. The system was assumed isotropic(non-
directional) with respect to flow.  My home system is designed to the lower
value, and I've never, ever, ever had a stuck runoff, even considering all the
corn, rye, oats, and other junk with which I brew.  Effective porosity
(porosity available for flow) of the grain was assumed to be 0.3, or 30%.
Total porosity was set at 0.4.  These values are assumed based upon grain size
comparison with geologic materials for which the model was designed. The tun
is 25 cm wide, 40 cm long, and the grain is 20 cm deep. A model grid of 40
columns, 25 rows, and 20 layers was constructed.  All layers have equivalent
hydraulic conductivities.  Another model was run on a cylindrical tun 0.45 m
in diameter. Values for hydraulic head are calculated at the center of each
grid cube using the 3D Transport equation.


The effects of drains installed 0.03  meters (3 cm) above the base of the
lautertun were simulated.  Conclusions are as follows:


The model predicts hydraulic head distributions very similar to John Palmer's
empirical results. They strongly suggest that a double drain system lauters
grain in homebrew-sized equipment in a significantly more efficient fashion
than single drains.  Flowpaths through the larger volume of grain are shorter
overall, thus increasing the opportunity for rinsing a greater volume of grain
in a given time.  Modeling indicates that flow regimes are maintained in each
system and complete rinsing will occur, though,  throughout the volume of
grain in a typical homebrewers lautertun.


A false bottom system is generally considered superior to a drain, based on
complete rinsing via gravity drainage through grain.  Modeling indicates
hydraulic pressure overcomes this advantage, and completely rinses grain
beneath, below, and at the edge of the lauter system.  This is also
illustrated in the final stages of John's empirical study, wherein the entire
grain media is saturated with color.


In general, this little bit of esoterica indicates that drains work really
well at the physical process of rinsing grain of goodies. It indicates Darcy's
law is indeed applicable to the flow of fluid through porous media, even if it
is barley malt, and it suggests that double drains are probably better than
single drains, but that single drains will work anyway.

Mississquoi, even though I was from the NW and could pronounce other screwy

Subject: My CAP


Brewers,


     Brewed a pseudo CAP.  Here is how it went.  It's a long post but
might be somewhat entertaining for you.  


     I took 15 lb American 6-row and did a double crush at the standard
setting on my Malt Mill.  It looked like the grain was very course not like
the way 2-row crushes--not much flour but big chunks of grain.  It was not
easy doing the second pass.  Had to gently push the grain down the hopper. 
 Is this typical of a second pass for 2 or 6 row?
     Mashed 15 lb. 6-row with 2 lb. flaked maize at 150 for 30 mins, 158
for 40 mins, and mashed out at 168 for 15 mins.  I recirculated until wort
was clear and it was beautifully clear!  
     I heat sparge water up in a keg with a spigot on it.  I empty it into my
GOT Cooler and put it up above my mash tun on a stand.  Works very well
for me.  Well the keg I heat sparge water in is also my boiler.  I began
sparging into my kettle and about 15 minutes later my helper/eyes (young
nephew) says, "Hey, where is all that water coming from under that kettle?" 
My heart immediately dropped because I knew exactly what it was!  I left
the spigot open when I drained it into my sparge tank.  I lost about 2 or 3
quarts of beautifully clear wort.  I continued to sparge and got 6 gallons of
runnings before my gravity got to 10 and I decided to stop.  The gravity was
at 45 and I wanted it to be at 48-50 for 10 gallons!  I had plenty liquor in
the mash tun and in the sparge tank. 
     With 2 big starters going, 2 fermentors sanitized, frig all cleaned out
with space for the 2 fermentors, and many thirsty friends and family
members, I did the unthinkable.  I added 3 lbs of light LME to the boil and
brought the volume up to about 11 gallons.  The gravity was at 50 and all
was sort of OK.  When taking the gravities before adding the extract, it was
a beautiful golden yellow (as far as I could tell), and after adding the
extract, it turn substantially darker--even I could tell with my poor vision.  I
was heart broken for selling out on America ;-) just like the big boys...
     Planning to get approximately 30 IBs I FWHed 1 oz Saaz, 1.5 oz
Cluster 60 mins, 2 oz Saaz 10, 1 oz Saaz at flame out.  Boil went perfect.
Drained 6 gallons into the first fermentor and got about 1.5 gallons in the
second one.  Gravity reading between fermentors read 1060!  I added some
water to the second fermentor and brought the gravity down a bit.
     The wort going into the fermentor is never very clear--should it? Is this
a sign of not boiling vigorously enough?  I usually get a nice small ripple of
a boil. Should I turn the heat up a bit and boil harder and just keep adding
more make up water?   Or should I take out my chiller, stir the wort and
get the whole hops to form a better filter bed for my Easy Masher?  
     Beer looks great but not exactly what I wanted.  I'll try the CAP again
for sure.  Some improvements to my system that will be coming up real
soon is to add a simple sight glass to gage how much liquid is in kettle,
mash tun, and sparge tank.  I don't do a very good job of feeling the side of
the boiling kettle to measure liquid levels (obviously);-(  This is much easier
to do with cold kegs in the frig.  I've also been writing Santa for a new
pump, disconnects and tubing.

Bzzzzzt! Wrong-O, buster. It was Stroh's. Most definitely. I doubt that
Old Style could have also used the same catch phrase without somehow
infinging on Stroh's, but it was DEFINITELY a Stroh's advertising catch.
Mebbe both, but I don't recall ever hearing or reading it in any Old Style
advertisements. Having lived in Detroit my entire (give or take a small
percentage here and there) I was literally INUNDATED with Stroh's
commercials...

Yup, they did say KROY-zen. Actually, it was KROY-zen-ing, but that's
picking nits. Of course, they never said much more about it that that they
did it; not what it was. This would leave the typical beer consumer
saying:  "Well? So what?!?"

Hmmm. Why's that? Unless caramelization is undesirable, it becomes a
matter of heat is heat, as the original poster alludes to. Being a larger
brewery, I'd imagine the kettles and/or processes were designed to prevent
unwanted caramelization, so the point still becomes a big "so what?" in
terms of their advertising gimick...

You really want to leave the "gray gunk" on the inside of your al
kettle. This oxidized layer minimizes the amount of aluminum ions that
are transferred to your finished beer.  The inside of my al kettle is
dark gray/charcoal (but smoothe, no scale or chunks!), and I can't taste
al in my beer.

This is key with al kettles, do not scrub them so they are shiny!  Just
wipe the gunk out with a soft sponge, so that the oxidized layer
remains.

Subject: Labeling Bottles


I have about 80 bottles (or so) that I need to label. I have designed
a color label that I can print  on a Deskjet printer. I would like to
use a labeling method that will allow the labels to soak off easily
afterwards, so the bottle can be reused. I tried my first experiment
with soaking the labels in milk, which I had read about somewhere
(maybe here?) some time ago. The labels stick on well (I have yet to
try to soak them off); however, the colors from the printer bled somewhat. 


I printed, as said, with a deskjet printer. I used plain white paper to print
on.
Does anyone have any suggestions on a technique that will allow: 


1) Labels that are easily removable afterwards, by soaking, yet will stay on
until then.
2) Non-bleeding colors (maybe I should use a different paper?)
3) Not as important, but since we're talking about 80 bottles, here--something
that's not too extremely labor intensive.


Thanks in advance for your help.

Subject: CO2 toxicity and sight glasses


Hello fellow brewers,


Agitating a yeast starter is well known to increase both the rate of 
yeast reproduction, and the maximum population.  Most people contribute 
this to exposing more yeast cell to the wort, and therefore feeding them 
more.  I have long contended that this may be true, but more significant 
is the removal of CO2.  CO2 is way more soluble in water than most 
gasses, because it forms carbonic acid instead of remaining as dissolved 
gas.  This carbonic acid greatly reduces the pH.  So that I can speak 
more authoritatively, the next time I make a starter, I will take a pH 
reading pre and post agitation during active fermentation.  If anyone 
has a starter going now, and beats me to it - go ahead!!.  More evidence 
for this is this:  If you want a mead to finish in about 2 weeks, adjust 
the pH up into the high 5's with CaCO3.  You will have to re-acidify for 
balance, but it the carboy will bounce around the floor!!!


As for sight glasses, I have a 10 gal SS HLT with a thermometer threaded 
into a nipple welded into the pot.  I removed the thermometer, and 
placed a double male (MPT? ;*) ) threaded nipple, and a "T" fitting in 
between the pot and the thermometer, the third limb of the "T" is 
pointed up with a hose barb fitting threaded into it.  A piece of tygon 
goes up from the hose barb and is clipped into one of those racking cane 
holder clips at the top of the pot.  It is easily replaced if it gets 
cloudy, it was cheap, and it is pretty much unbreakable.  The drawback 
is that it only measures over 3 gallons.


Happy Brewing


Adam

Tim said:
"Being a home-brewer and computer programmer has led me to explore the
various recipe calculators that are out there. While many of them do a
good job formulating, printing, and saving recipes, none I have found
enables true sharing of recipes between brewers... No program out there,
that I know of, allows you to pull a recipe from the web and work with
it on your home PC without typing it in again."


Tim,
Take a look at Pro Mash (www.promash.com) (No Affiliation, YYY).  It
saves recipes and brewing sessions in separate files, making them very
easy to exchange.  The creator has even set up a BBS type area on his
web page where users can exchange recipes, sessions, notes, etc..  Of
course, the limitation to this program is that it does not use a
"standard" method of information exchange like XML, so you can only
exchange back and forth with other ProMash users.

I currently have a Scotch Ale nicely fermenting.  I had tried to
activate the yeast from the dregs from a bottle of Fullers 1845.  I did
not think it was working so at brew day I got out a quart of "yeast
cake" I had harvested from the last batch I made with Thames Valley 1275
(Wyeast).  I pitched it and was going to pour out the Fullers experiment
when much to my surprise upon tasting theFullers, it was tasting like
beer!  I then also pitched the Fullers step-up yeast.  I am sure no
problems will occur in this beer since the properties are similar
enough, but what happens in the next generation of yeast if I try to
harvest this "bastardized" yeast?  Will mutations occur?  Should I just
throw away the bottom 2nd generation?  I have never mixed yeasts before
and am very curious.  Any help from someone who has mixed them will be
added to my data bank of home brew knowledge .

Date sent:  25-NOV-1998 10:31:14 


I have just brewed a pretty HUGE beer (beaucoup malt and honey) to make a 
real high gravity ale.  In the mash I placed a chopped (preboiled) beet.  I 
was interested in both the flavor and color.  Actually, I had to put most 
of the liquid in, and little of the beet itself in that my boiler was right
at the top!


The color was wonderful...to the point that I want to call this one "Purple 
Haze"....but after the boil the color seems to have melded into the wort.
Does anyone know whether I could/ should extract more liquid from several 
beets by boiling, and add this to the secondary?  I am of course worried 
that there may be starches or off flavors that could be departed along with 
the color...


Any ideas?  Or perhaps there is a safer way to impart purple to a 5 gallon 
batch?

I submit (mostly seriously) that this is not a question of pronounciation,
but one of philosophy.  If you consider yourself a participant in this
forum because you are a brewer who just happens to be at home, then you
might say hBd.  If you stress the importance of your kitchen as the

for those of you who don't brew much at all, but browse these pages mainly
to consider it's contents (or for those of you who merely consume the
homebrew of others) they might say hbD.  All are equally correct for each
one's point of reference.  And all provide us with interesting and useful
information.  It is indeed fortunate for all of us that we have

Subject: Re: Yeast propagation, canning wort


Dave


Canning is a piece of cake.  If you buy 'Ball' brand jars, they always come
with a little instruction manual.  Also, most places that sell jars sell the
'Ball Blue Book' that explains a lot about canning.  To can, you need to buy
some equipment, too.  For just the heat-type canning you'll need a 4-gallon
(?) stock-pot along with some other trappings.  I guess you could use your
brewing pot, but our canning pot is covered in hard water deposits and
doesn't look appealing.  The other trappings include a rack to lift/submerse
jars in the canner, jar clamps to pick them up, and probably some other
stuff.  I think these usually come as a package.  Total, including stockpot,
trappings and jars (lids usually come with the jars, but they are supposed
to be single use and next time you can you'll need to buy a pack of lids.
The twist on part, the bands, are reusable), will probably run at least $50.


To can, you just boil jars, take them out and fill them, put lids/bands on,
and boil the filled jars for a specified length of time (read recipe).  It
is important not to tighten the lids/bands on real hard prior to putting in
the canner (uh, learned the hard way).  The lids end up being held on by
vacuum.  The boil sterilizes the contents and ejects some air.  When the
jars cool, a vacuum develops holding the lid on.


However, I've read pressure canning is preferred for wort.  I know nothing
about pressure canning.  Maybe someone could discuss this.


I've read many times that just microwaving wort to boiling, and subsequent
cooling prior to use is so simple, why bother canning?  The starters I've
made, I just boiled wort on the stovetop, cooled quickly in an ice bath and
used directly after aerating.  Canning is easy, but takes a little time to
set-up.  I think stovetop or microwave preparation of wort immediately prior
to use is the best way to go - particularly if you are talking small
(<1-gallon) volumes.  Knowing I just boiled it is so much more reassuring
than wondering if the canned wort is infected, has botulism, blah, blah....


By the by, may I add my thanks to Pat Babcock and Karl Lutzen.


Latersville,


Matt
