Subject: Sprouting malt / canning / serving beer


Hi all,


Dave B. "sincerely doubts" that malt can sprout.  Well, he has never 
tried it!
I must admit I had the same reaction when Jim Basler of Briess malting 
told
me that malt can grow, but rather than just doubt it, I tried it.


It grows!


The germination rate is horrific, and the best results were achieved 
using fresh,
homemade malt, but it can be done.  You could then take the seed from the
 plant
or two that you grow and plant them to make more barley seeds of a 
malting variety.
- -----------------------------------------------------------
A few people have talked about canning, saying that it is acceptable to 
simply put
hot wort into jars or beer bottles.  While this can work, it is not the 
best way to can
wort (or anything).


I like my starter wort to be sterile. Yes, I used that word on purpose. 
 Sterility is only
ensured (not insured; that should make Pete happy) by pressure canning. 
 If you
don't own a pressure cooker, then a boiling water bath can be used to can
 wort
with better results than simply putting hot wort into jars.


It is really no extra work.  If you are making starter wort form extract,
 simply dissolve
the extract in hot water, add some hops (I have been using iso-hop 
extract) and put
it into Mason jars.  Put these into the pressure cooker or boiling water 
bath and
let 'er rip.  There is no need to boil the wort before putting it in the 
jars.
- -----------------------------------------------------------
Bob asks people to chime in about they serve beer.  Since the queue is 
short, I'll
write in:


The last time I was at my friend Bill Coleman's house I served him a CAN 
(yes, CAN)
of Belle Vue Kriek via the old "shot gun" method.  It seemed appropriate 
for such a
sickening brew.


In this way none of Bill's fancy Belgian glassware was contaminated by 
the
mass-market blech.  Unfortunately, the floor didn't fare so well...


Have fun!

Mash separately 1 lb. oatmeal 1 lb. flaked barley.  I use a protein rest

Mine produced an OG of 60 for 5.5 gallons.  I used Scotch ale yeast and

This could have been the best mistake he/you ever made but you forgot

I just finished the last of, what we think was, the greatest beer
ever made at the World's Greatest Brewery (tm).

The grain bill was 12 lbs DeWolf Kozens/Cosins?... can never
remember... Munich and 3 lbs of CaraMunich, same brand.  The hops
was  green home grown Chinook and the yeast was PU.  I mashed it
like every other beer I make (90 min at 155) and it produced about 8
gallons of 65 gravity wort.  I did not add brewing water after
fermenting as I usually do to bring it back to ten gallons.

Subject: Re: Drilling Holes in Glass Carboys


I did not see the original post as I'm quite new here... so if it is off topic 
please forgive me.  I understand the question is how to safely drill a hole 
thru a glass carboy to install a valve.


Drilling holes in glass carboys is definately NOT dangerous but you have to 
have the right tools to do it.  I have done this many times safely.  I am a 
machinist and have the tools to build the drills easily.  I have never tried 
the drills that are supposed to be good for drilling holes in ceramics or 
glass and would probably NOT try these.  However, once the hole is drilled I 
don't see how one would get the valve nut into the small neck of the carboy 
much less manipulate it onto the valve and tighten it... maybe I'm not seeing 
something here.. or I haven't seen the valve type in question.  I'm thinking 
of the plastic valves sold in brewing supply stores.


If you are of a mind to do this you will need to build a drill from a soft 
metal such as copper or aluminum.  The OD of the drill will be just a tad 
larger then the threaded portion of the  valve you are trying to install in 
the carboy.  The "drill" will have to be a centered tool that has a shank to 
fit your DRILLPRESS... I would NOT recommend a hand drill.  The drill 
portion can be a piece of copper tubing/pipe if one has the luck of having the 
proper size OD available.  You can slit the ends of the pipe slightly with a 
band saw or something similar to capture and feed grit to the cutting area.


I'm not a writer but I hope you get the picture of the drill... I don't know 
if it is appropriate to do an ascii drawing on this forum.  Anyone interested, 
I may be able to 'draw' a pic and send it under separate cover but you might 
have to have a friend who is a machinist build one for you.  Maybe you can go 
to a local junior college that has a machine shop class and ask the instuctor 
to have a student build one as a project.  I can provide a plan with a SASE or 
would build you one for a fee.. but cost might be prohibitive on a one by one 
basis... I doubt if there would be a market for many.


The idea now is to firmly  secure the bottle on it's side in the drillpress 
and locate the drill over the location of the place where you eant the hole.  
Surround that area with plasticine modeling clay and add a small amount of oil 
and some valve grinding compound available at an auto supply store.


Find something  to attach to the drill press handle that will overcome the 
spring return tension and attach that to the handle (or you can stand at the 
drill press and manually apply pressure)  Turn on the drill press and the 
drill begins abraiding its way thru the glass.. it doesn't cut as a spiral 
drill would.  You will need to lift the 'drill' from the spot every minute or 
so to allow a new slurry of grinding compound to flow down into the groove you 
are cutting.  Be careful not to get impatient and put too much pressure on the 
cut or you will break it out on the backside or worse, ruin the carboy..  
Remember this is like using sandpaper on wood vs a chisel or spiral drill... 
you are abraiding your way thru the glass.


Any further questions, I'll be glad to try to answer.  Good luck.

Jeff, go to the mall during the Christmas season.  They have these guys

engrave glasses and mugs and stuff using a sandblaster.  You could also
try "Things Remembered" or any other personal engraving company.  ;-)
Just tell 'em you want  "HBD.ORG" on the mug.

Subject: Re:Milk and gummed labels.


I would love to hear some suggestions for a more viscous, water-soluble
alternative to milk.  Being more viscous would avoid the problem
altogether.


Fred, I missed the beginning of you're conversation.  For years I used gummed
paper, not self stick labels,  for bottling.  That was before the advent of
"cheap"
computers.  We did a manual layout and took it to the printer for an offset
job.
Never had a bleed problem.  When I started using inkjets I had the same problem


that you are experiencing with bleed.


The application of the label helps.  Wet the bottle, not the label.  Put a
small
amount of dish soap in the dip so the water spreads across the bottle and
doesn't pool.  Move the label from the sides and don't try to rub it on.
Still get's a bit of bleed on some of the bottles.


Here's an idea I had.  I haven't tried it myself but I think it might work.
Print to gummed paper.  That's the water soluble kind.  Use a color inkjet.
Then use an artists fixative on the printed surface.   The fixative might
bleed through and fix the gum if you use too much, but it's worth a try.
Krylon Clear Coat has far too many solvents and will definately soak
all the way through the paper.  Some fixatives tend to stay more on
top of the paper.  I'm not sure of which ones, an artist I'm not.

Subject: Say What 2


J Pullum opines about Falstaff and Blatz in 1960s Omaha (hbd 2887).  My
recollection about 1960s beer drinking in Kansas City is that you started
with Bud or Schlitz and then, after taste burn-out, switched to less
expensive quarts of Grain Belt.  Seems like Grain Belt went very well with
KC BBQ ribs, especially at the Rosedale BBQ on Southwest Blvd (just a
customer).  Still can get the ribs but will have to settle on a 90s brew.


Speaking of old time lagers, I'm still trying to brew a version of Pabst
Blue Ribbon (50s style my father drank).  Thanks to Jeff Renner, Michel
Brown and others I've brewed up two versions of CAP.  One way too hoppy and
the second about right on the hops but sweeter than I remember.  My thoughts
are to lose some of the maize and replace it with some rice or sugar, to
make the flavor less intense.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.  The PBR I
remember was quite hoppy (Saaz I think) and not very sweet, although this
could be how a young beer drinker perceived the brew.

Subject: Cheap 240VAC GFI???


Ground fault checks for a variation between the incoming "hot" wire current and
the neutral out current.  They have to be equal.   If there is a difference
between the two it assumes a loss or leakage to ground that is not traveling
through the neutral wire,  i.e. your body and the plumbing fixtures.  The Delta
N, is the difference allowed, 10 ma, between the hot and the neutral current.
It will not sense a fault between the two hot wires.  This means you have 3
wires, two hot, 1 neutral coming from the GFI.  if you grab either hot wire and
short yourself to a ground, say a water pipe, it will interrupt the circuit.
If you grab both hot wires, 240VAC or if you grab one hot and the Neutral,
120VAC, tough luck, you're toast.  Since it disconnects by the delta N,  it is
not looking for overcurrent so of course it can't be used as a circuit breaker,
you have to use a circuit breaker for that one.


Note:  It is not immediately apparent by the data if the two hot wires are
being summed in some way and compared to the total neutral wire or if the load
has to be balanced.  I would assume the former but you know what they say about
assuming.  If it is relying on a closely balanced load and the device was
designed for a specific application, it is possible that it would be useless
for very many other apps.

Otherwise! I've not it heard pronounced either way.
In German the double a is pronounced like a long a in English,
as in car, far, and guitar. The s is pronounced as a z

Subject: A Mystery of Some Gravity


I need your help with a beer mystery of some gravity. While at the GABF
in October, I was very intruigued by a new style (at least for me) -
wheatwine. Several breweries had their interpretations, I was most
impressed by the one from Steelhead in Eugene, Oregon. Basically, a
wheatwine is much like a barleywine, only wheat. Duh! Anyhow, I decided
to try making one.


I had downloaded an evaluation copy of ProMash and used that to put
together my recipe. I did a 5 gallon, full boil, partial-mash batch. I
used the following extract and grain:


2 cans (3kg each or just over 13 lbs) Ireks liquid wheat extract
1 lb. malted wheat
4 lb. pale malt
LOTS OF HOPS (Centennial, Chinook, Hallertauer)
Wyeast 1056 (yeastcake from previous batch of Steam Beer)


The default efficiency is set at 85% in ProMash. At this efficiency the
program gave me an anticipated starting gravity of 1.122. I know this
efficiency would be low for the liquid malt extract (the bulk of my
batch) and possibly  high for the partial mash, but should be at least a
good approximation of SG. Certainly it would be a BIG beer, in line with
what I wanted. I did a full boil, cooled with my two-stage immersion
chiller and drained into my carboy. At this point the temp was approx.
80-85 degrees.


Here comes the mystery - I took a hydrometer reading for starting
gravity and got 1.074. I don't understand!!! Just from the liquid
extract alone I should have been way above this. I didn't adjust for
temperature, but at 80-85 degrees this difference would be small. I got
approx. 5 gal in the fermentor. I used leaf hops and there was certainly
some wort left trapped in this - but very little. My previous batch of
steam beer had SG readings of 1.041 and FG of 1.014. Pretty much what I
had expected.  I had gotten the FG reading the same day as I did the
batch of wheatwine, so that I could pitch onto the yeastcake. So it
isn't like something happened to the hydrometer in the interim. Also,
later I checked the hydrometer in tap water and it read 1.000, so my
hydrometer would seem to be ok.


I don't get it. If it had been a partial-boil batch I would say the wort
wasn't mixed fully - but it was full-boil.  The only other possiblity I
have thought of is that for some reason the malt extract was way low. Is
that possible, or what could cause this type of reading?Any suggestions
would be greatly appreciated. I am totally baffled.


At this point, the batch is happily fermenting away. I can't believe
that the gravity was really that low, but if it was - what have I
brewed? Certainly not a dopplebock - not with that amount of hops or
that yeast. Maybe an American Wheat PA?

Rick Pauly posted about a bitter-sweet beer.  RickI've never had the
pleasure of a Hop Pocket or Hop Devil - not sure they are available in KC.
However, I've been seeking the same bitter-sweet flavor you describe for
about a year.  Something beyond Redhook ESB or Fullers ESB.  The recipe
given below gets close (actually better than either of the targets IMO) but
could still use a little burnt flavor to enhance the sweetness.  If you can
achieve that please let me know how.
                                                        
Pale Malt                7.0 lbs

I've mashed this recipe at 148 up to 158 single temperature infusions.  Also
have used a decoction in an attempt to release malt flavor.  Best results
to-date came from an infusion at 148F, followed in 20 minutes by a decoction
(30 minute boil), returned for a final rest at 152F.
                                
Total boil time is 90 minutes

Force chill, aerate and settle                                                        
                                                        
Best fermentation has been with Wyeast 1028 Ale and 2206 Bavarian Lager.
Both taste the same but the lager version is smoother.
                                
I've brewed this with OGs from 1044 to 1055.  The lower OG produces a
mellower beer that is more drinkable.  FG is usually around 1015.


Using Greg Noonan's calculation I get 55 IBUs for the 60 minute hops but the
beer is not overtly bitter.  In my experience the beer takes 2 to 3 months
to mellow out and be at it's best in bottles.  Again if anyone can suggest a
method to introduce a burnt flavor note to this beer I would appreciate it.

Subject: 240V service, I need a neutral




Dear HBD,


I have looked back over the GFCI/240vs120V lines thread of a couple of
months ago and I *think* I understand it. However this doesn't seem to help
my situation. Plus, as this is a safety issue, I don't feel too bad bringing
the thread up again.


I have recently moved into a condo and both my wife and I are very glad to
have all of my brewing stuff moved into a garage. Unfortunately, the housing
association feels that my brewing, using a propane burner, in my garage
doorway (as far out as parking lot traffic will allow) is a safety hazard. I
disagree as I am very careful but I can see their point. After all, they are
looking out for my investment also. As I was already gathering stuff to
convert my HLT to electricity, I just figured I could convert my kettle to
an electric boiler also. My water heater is located in the garage and the
home inspector who examined it before we bought the condo told me it used
120V/30A wiring.


The problem began when I actually examined the wiring the other day. Here is
what I found. The service into the electrical box consisted of an insulated
cable with three wires inside
1) bare copper: presumably ground
2) black wire: 119.9 V to ground
3) "white wire": covered with black tape to appear black 118.9 V to ground.


Wires 2&3 are 210V w.r.t. each other.


The circuit breakers are two 30 Amp circuit breakers from adjacent slots
"ganged together". 


It looks to me that the water heater is actually using 240V, with no neutral
conductor.


The question is, how do I split the 240V service into two 120V services that
I can connect to GFCIs without a neutral line?


I could use the ground as a neutral but is that safe? Wouldn't then the
return current from my 120V circuits (up to 30Amps) be electrically
connected to things such as appliance housings ? (The water heater is the
only thing on these circuit breakers).


And if I could use the ground for the return current, what would I use to
ground my HLT etc?


I should also note that there is also a plug in the garage on a different
circuit. It is 120V/15A and I have already placed a GFCI on it. I know I
coulkd use this but it doesn't the rating to drive two heater elements. With
only one heater element I would be confined to small barches, long heating
times and insipid boils.


Does anyone out there have any sugestions? Other than hiring an electrician
to rewire my garage, I will never have enough beer bullets to justify that
expense.


Thanks for any help I can get. I want to start brewing again!

Subject: Re: Heat Exchanger details


HBD,


About a month and a half ago, I posted a request for details about various
heat exchange systems (i.e. coil i.d., length, flow rate, etc.) in use out
there. Unfortunately the response was unspectacular. Other than, a reminder
from PBS that the term HERMS is trademarked by them, the only information I
got was from Chris (Cuckold`at`cornerpub.com) telling me what he planned to do
but hadn't actually built.


Chris planned to use 30-40 ft of 3/8" tubing (better heat transfer than
1/2"). Chris also noted the importance of a bypass valve to avoid over
heating. Chris also thought that horizonal coils would be better than
vertical coils to avoid trapped air. (I don't think this would be a problem
with a good flow rate, however, horizontal coils would be easier to drain
the liquid out of after cleaning, Ed.)


The following info I gained by webcrawling and search back HBDs


Ian Smith: 25ft of 3/8" coil. 1gal/min flow  through 152F water gives a wort
temp of 150-150.8F


Ronald LaBorde: 25ft of 5/8" coil "just thrown in the HLT"


Rick Calley: 25ft of 1/2" horizonatal coil atached with Swage-lok bulkhead
fittings


David Ludwig: 8 ft of 1/2" horizontal coil inside the MASH-TUN and not the
HLT. David pumps hot water through the MT and NOT hot wort through the HLT.
This requires a mixer in the MT to ensure an even temperature. David
recommends a short coil to "reduce drag on the circulating mash and to
reduce the heat soak-back following temperature boosts" 


Zymie & IGOR: 25ft of 1/2" vertical coil, the coil is wrapped  HLT at 170F


Personally, I have decided to go with a 25ft 3/8" horizontal coil because it
is easier to work with than 1/2" tubing and has a better heat-exchange
surface to volume ratio (Plus, then I can use the other half of a 50ft coil
for a counter-flow wort chiller). The only concern I have is about the
flow-rate with a smaller diameter, but Ian Smith got 1 gal/min which sounds
good enough to me.
 I already have Swagelock-bulkhead fittings to attach the coil to the keg
side. They were relatively inexpensive and shoud work great.

Hey gang!


I bottled my Xmas Ale over a month ago, just tried a bottle and it's flat as
ever.  What can I do NOW to carbonate my bottles?


It's a pretty high-gravity beer (SG 1.070), but I thought the bottles would
be carbonated by now.


Solutions I've considered are:


1) Waiting.
2) Adding some corn sugar to each bottle (dissolved in water first?)
3) Adding more yeast (how much?)
4) Adding corn sugar AND adding more yeast (this frightens me)


Any help?

Hi Folks...


Let me preface by saying I am a complete rookie..though eager to learn.


So far  i have  made one batch of Bock with a kit, and after perusing
the internet for hours decided to ignore the simplified instructions and
go with a more detailed beer brewing procedure...Boil wort/rapid cool/
ferment/sec ferment /bottle etc..to our delight and amazement the final
result was pretty damn good.


At any rate, I am now preparing to brew a brown ale (malt extract from
Ireland). As this is an ale and not a lager, different processes are
required.


After looking through the files I have saved from the internet, I notice
a great many discrepencies in damn near everything . I realize as in any
human endeavor there are many different ways to do things, ending in a
similar result, but i'm getting confused at this point.


My question to you folks: is there a site on the net where they have
basic (well not too basic) instructions for an ale, that are tried and
true?? perhaps I have it already, but which one is it??


As I have developed a fairly sophisticated palate, I don't want to brew
any insipid crap if possible.( Maybe my wife will drink it...haha)


Thanks for any assistance in this paltry matter.

you've qualified for the MCAB and haven't gotten an e-mail from me (I've gotten
lots of bounces), drop me a note and we'll fix you up.  If you know anyone who's
qualified for the MCAB, do pass the word that the entry packets are out -- we
want to make sure that everyone knows.


Even if you didn't qualify this year, do consider coming to the MCAB in
Houston.  It'll be a great beer weekend, with lots of technical conferences, a
sensory evaluation seminar, exhibits by amateur and craft brewer suppliers, and
of course lots of Foam Ranger fun and warm Texas hospitality.  And a great price
too -- free.  OK, you gotta pay for transportation, lodging (MCAB rate of
$59/night at the conference hotel), and your food and drink, but we're not gonna
gig you to listen to Goerge Fix, Paul Farnsworth, Dave Miller, and other
notables, or to hand out and party with lots of the biggest beer geeks in North
America.  C'mon, come to Houston in February (typical daily temp of 60F), have
some fun, and learn a little bit more about brewing.  (Feel free to write me for

Brewrus (that would be brewing gurus),
  I apalogize for bothering the masses again with my cider with preservatives
= crappy fermentation problem again, but while my local brew shops are very
curtious in their attempts to help me I find they know two things about making
cider; jack and sh*#. To bring you up-to-date: I'm making a cider with 4
gallons of apple cider (w/ potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate and malic acid),
4 lbs of brown sugar boiled in 1.5 G water, and 1 pk wine yeast. O.G.=1.052.
After 4 days of no airlock action I repitched same brand wine yeast. For next
7 days I got airlock bubbles anywhere from once a minute to once per 20
seconds. So after 11 days total in primary I racked over to secondary on top
of another wine yeast pack boiled in a cup of water (as nutrient). The gravity
was still 1.052!?!  Now after 4 days I see nothing (and the S.G is still
1.052...the hydrometer works fine at 60 deg)! I understand that the
preservatives are holding up fermentation, but is it killing it? Apparently
not much is happening. Before I have to think about just ditching it and
getting on with my life (:^( I wanted to see if any of you could help me with
any ideas. I worry..it's been over 2 weeks now since I put this batch together
(where's the confidence in my sanitation?). Thanks!
