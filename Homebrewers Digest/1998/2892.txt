Subject: RIMS Questions --- summary


A while back I asked for advice on RIMS false bottom designs,
with particular emphasis on those suitable for a GOTT that do not
require a lot of different parts.


<John_E_Schnupp`at`amat.com> uses a piece of 1/8" screen,
with ss bolts for legs, and slits a length of poly tubing to fit
around the outside.  This makes a tight seal around the edges
of the inside of the GOTT.


Fred Wills <MaltHound`at`aol.com> uses a slotted pipe manifold in
a rectangular cooler with no problems.  He also turned me on
to the 3-MDX Little Giant pump (Grainger p/n 2P579A) for only
$72.


"Roger Marshall" <roger`at`caribsurf.com> cut the handle off of a
5" dia. kitchen strainer and inverted it on the floor of  the cooler.
He carefully cut a hole in the side for the copper drain tubing,
the force of which keeps the strainer from moving around.


Lee Menegoni <Lee.Menegoni`at`digital.com> suggests a coil of
1/2" OD copper tubing with 1/16" drilled holes.  He also
suggests draining by gravity to a lauter grant (plastic bucket),
then circulating the wort by pump. 


C.D. Pritchard uses a spiral coil of ss braided 1/2" OD hose
for his false bottom.  Plenty of open area, and damn-near
impossible for grain to pass through.


FWIW, no-one responded that they use an EasyMasher with
RIMS.  I was kind of hoping someone would.


**************************************************************************


Also recently, my friend Robert Arguello <robertac`at`calweb.com>
posted about using a NPT x 3/8" compression fitting with a
length of 3/8" polycarbonate tubing for a *sight* glass.  When
I asked him about a source for this tubing, he directed me to
a plastic supply house, which doesn't really work in my area.  I did
think of a solution though --- racking cane!


It turns out that the standard 3/8" clear racking cane fits nicely
in a 3/8" compression fitting.  I replaced the brass sleeve with
a poly one, but I noticed that a corny keg dip tube o-ring also
appears to fit.


Cheers and thanks,
Randy in Modesto

Subject: re: 240V service, I need a neutral


Thanks for all the helpfull responses on the HBD and by email,


As I was afraid of, but hoped some-one would convince me otherwise, it is
unsafe to use the ground as a neutral.


As for other items raised,

The bare wire is definately a ground. I found it tied to a box casing.
(This info was missing from the original post)

I was planning on using two GFCI's one with each hot wire. The load each
would see would have been only a single water heater element (~13 amps) as
there are at the end of the line.


3) Seth Goodman wrote...

Yes, the water heater is kinda small and works poorly.


I was planning on turning the hot water heater off while brewing (either
manually or by a built in relay to prevent my forgetting) so I wouldn't
overload the circuit.




One suggestion (sorry I don't have the name at work) was to use one hot
line from the 240V water heater supply and the neutral from the wall plug
(connected trough a GFCI of course). This would put double the current on
that neutral (up to 30 amp). As the neutral doesn't go through the breaker
(only the hot does) this wouldn't trip the 15 amp breaker.


*IF* the gauge of the return wire is sufficient to handle 30 amps (12
gauge? I will look it up and check the wire) does this sound safe?


As mentioned above, when brewing I will turn off the hot water heater and
the other regular 120V line has only the master bedroom (a clock only) on
it.


Thanks for all the safety help. A little paranoia is better than
overconfidence when dealing with electricity and water.

I have found a bunch of magnetic drive pumps at a surplus store. they are
March AC-2CP-MD pumps. From the March website (www.marchpump.com) I have
found the following specs.


13ft head,flow`at`1ft=4.75 gal/min; flow `at`6ft=3.25 gal/min


I have two questions for anyone with knowledge of these pumps or pumps in
general...


1) What is the temperature rating of this pump?


2) Is this pump powefull enough to pump wort through a 25ft coil of 3/8"
o.d. copper tubing. I am concerned that the resistriction due to the coil
may exceed the head. Can any fluid engineers out there tell me how to
calculate the restriction of a coil?


Thanks for any help you can give.

Subject: Pumpkin Specific gravity


Brewing on the Saturday after Turkey day puts me a little late on the
pumpkin ale this year.  I have had no luck in finding a standard to use in
determining the amount of fermentables pumpkin adds to the brew.  I have
probably made it harder to calculate by adding the juice to the boil and not
the pumpkin itself.  I steamed 18lbs of pumpkin and then ran it through a
squeezo extracting 2 gallons of juice.  I then added the juice to the boil
of an all-grain batch.  Any s.g. numbers on pumpkin or it's juice would be
greatly appreciated.

Subject: amber ale


        Scott asks in #2890 just what amber ale is.  Amber ale is, for one,
an AHA recognized American style.  American wheat, several American style
lagers and amber ale tend to be the whipping boys of style super-purists
(they tend to lay off American pale ale).  These styles are characterized,
these critics would argue, by their lack of character and history--it's
often a hot debate.  In the marketplace, amber ale is usually a
micro-brewery's flagship product engineered to be a cross-over beer, that
is, palatable to a first time drinker whose beer experience has been more
along the lines of Bud, Heineken and whose notion of styles is light and
dark.  No snobbery intended here:  Light and Dark were basically the style
categories for the AHA 20 years ago, and any craft brewer will tell you that
part of his job is to educate his customers about style differences so he
can sell them more of his product.  Amber ale is a gateway beer--not too
hoppy, not too malty.  Get the customer hooked on your flagship amber, and
soon enough he'll try a hoppy pale ale, another couple of months and he'll
be jonesin' for a roasty stout, and when he goes to the supermarket, he'll
buy six of all three.  I'm living proof of the success of this marketing
strategy.  I like my local craft brewer's amber--Abita Amber.  I don't tend
to buy it that often for myself; I'll buy Abita's seasonal (a malty
Christmas ale right now) instead.  But if I'm throwing a party, Abita Amber
is what's in the cooler.  The light lager drinkers seem happy to try
something new and the "beer conscious" are happy to have something while not
awe-inspiring, at least tasty.


Happy brewing,

I am greatly disappointed in all of you.  You have failed, collectively and
 individually!
      In the Nov. 28, 1998 edition of "The Economist" it is reported that 
the Czechs just cannot get enough beer.  Retail sales per person for 1997 
in the Czech Republic topped 179.5 litres (almost 1/2 litre per day).  
Ireland was in second place with 136 litres. In the USA it was about 65,
 back in 10th place.  Australia was around 60 (Ha, take that Crocodile Dundee!)
      Let's do better next year folks.  I know this report is on retail sales,
 and we brew our own, but it is indicative of overall consumption.
  Let's go team!

Bock Patience?
 
    I tried to brew a partial mash bock on November 11, 1998.  Our
homebrewers club (StarCity Homebrewers Guild) is brewing bocks for our
February 4, 1999 monthly meeting.
   I fermented it for 19 days at 48-50 F, then racked it to a
secondary glass carboy for lagering.  I have read conflicting
opinions about 1)how long to keep it in the secondary, 2) whether or
not a diacetyl rest is necessary, 3) and when to bottle.
 
     Here is my recipe:
8+ lbs. M&F super light LME
 2 lbs. Munich
 2 oz. Chocolate
 Mt. Hood pellets (finishing)
 Tettnanger pellets (bittering)
 WhiteLabs pitchable yeast WLP 820 (or was it 830?) German Lager Yeast
  1 tbsp canning salt
 
 My OG was 1.055 (I know, I should have OG of 1.064+, but I thought that a 
long boil would thicken or increase the gravity).  4.5 gallons of wort.  
After 19 days my gravity is 1.014.
 
    So, is a diacetyl rest necessary or beneficial for this brew?
When should I bottle?  How much longer should I keep this in the
secondary?  Will it be ready for our homebrew club taste-testing on
Feb. 4, 1999?   Thanks.

Kirk,


I bought one of those systems but for air instead of O2 and had the same
problem with it floating.  I just took a 5/16 - 18 SS nut, drilled the minor
diameter out to 9/32 and slipped it over the barb portion.  That took it to
just a bit heavier than neutral buoyancy and it has worked fine ever since. 
Your washers will do the same thing.


You are probably wondering the same thing I did which is why do they sell
something which needs to be modified in order to work - or am I doing
something wrong.  I wondered about it awhile, drilled out the nut, and DID
it.  It works.  The question remains.  And I don't know the answer but my
curiosity diminishes daily.

Subject: Naming beers


Hi, folks;
        Greetings from the only guy in the brewing universe 
with NO all-grain ambitions, with a couple of random thoughts...
        First, I thought you'd like a funny story, to wit:


I was sitting at my confuser, reading my beloved HBD. Barb, 
who has now been putting up with me for 15 years (Bless her), 
was in the kitchen catching up on some dishes. I saw a post 
about brewing one of those "winter warmer" type spiced ales. 
I thought that might be a nice one to try. If it came out 
nice enough, I could use it as a gift for friends.


So I say to my honey, "Hun, I think I'm gonna make a 
Christmas Beer this year."


With the water running in the sink, she can't hear me. She 
says, "What?"


I repeat it, louder. She comes around the corner with a look 
of disbelief, and asks, "You're making a WHAT?"


"A Christmas Beer?"


She breaks down laughing, and says that it sounded like I had 
said I was gonna make "A Crystal Sphere". So, my spiced 
holiday ale will be (tada!) 
Barb's Crystal Sphere.


Sometimes I think the only reason I brew is so I can name 
these beers. :)


        Second, I recall a short time ago there was a flurry of 
well-deserved praise for Pat and Karl, and their efforts on the behalf of 
the HBD (aitch bee DEE). I became a subscriber just before the end of the 
AOB era, and the death throes were not pretty.
        What with Christmas coming up and all, Howzabout we all send them a 
beer...just one...not even necessarily our best. I'm sure we'd all like to 
have them over for a couple, and thank them in person. This might be the way 
to do it.


        Lastly, a quick aside to Badger. Long ago, (1983) I was Lord 
Theodore Digenes Ducas of the Barony of Dragonship Haven, in the East 
Kingdom. I --uh-- thought you should know that.

Subject: Bottle conditioning as diacetyl rest


OK, I've got my first true lager fermenting slowly in my 'fridge and a
thought occurred to me... Why do I have to do a diacetyl now, if I'm going
to eventually bottle condition at room temperature for a couple of weeks?


I can think of at least one posibility (more yeast in fermenter diacetyl
rest would take less time with the greater yeast), but couldn't 2 weeks
with a reduced yeast count equal 2 days with a greater count?


This may be a stupid idea, but it may also explain why some people claim
that they don't use a D-rest and can't taste any diacetyl in their finished
beer, and why other people swear by the D-rest. Maybe those that don't do a
D-rest are bottle conditioning, while those that do a D-rest are kegging
and artificially carbonating? This may go hand in hand with the level of
advancement of homebrewers; those with kegs are more advanced and more
well-read so they will include (and need?) a D-rest, while those that are
still bottling are less-read (than the 1st group) and don't include (or
need?) a D-rest.


Thoughts along this line may be more fruitful that questioning each others'
palates (gosh, I hope I spelled that right).

Donald Beistle <dbeistle`at`arches.uga.edu> posted in HBD #2891:
- --quote----
All the talk lately about references to krauesening in beer ads from the
greater Great Lakes region has me reminiscing about my own dissolute
youth. I have to add my voice to fray, affirming that it indeed was
the House of Heileman that touted the benefits of krauesening for its Old
Style brand. Anybody else remember when Old Style was "Pure brewed, double
brewed in the late '70s and early '80s?


By the way, has anyone else noticed a correlation between early exposure
to krauesening-related beer advertising and an interest in the Classic
American Pilsner movement? I know I've got the bug and everyone else
associated with recreating this style seems to hail from Wisconsin or
Michigan.Is there some Proustian compulsion to recapture the Old Styles
and Hubers and Hammeses and Lithias from out of our childhoods driving us
to brew with corn and domestic hops?
- ---endquote---------


Being a native-born Cheesehead raised on C.O.M.B. (Cheese, OldStyle, Milk and
Brats) I can agree with Donald that Heileman has been selling its Old Style as
krausened for decades (at least 3 that I can remember).


Relative to Donald's second statement, perhaps we are so interested in CAPs
because the beers of our (relative) childhood have changed over the years.
Heileman's Special Export in the late 70's was a different critter from the
swill it is today.  Same goes for Pabst's Andecker, which in the mid-70's was a
superb beer...about 1980 they changed its packaging and recipe...a fine beer
lost forever.   The trend of megabrews being reformulated into Barley Coke (tm)
led me to homebrew in the first place.


As for using domestic hops, the experiences of my youth with Schlitz (which uses
Cluster hops) have tainted my use of the hop in homebrewing...one taste of a
Cluster-hopped beer brings it all back (in reverse-peristalsis mode!).

Your speaker is misinformed. Soluble gaseous nitrogen (from air) provides no
nutrient value. Unlike soybeans, brewing yeast is unable to "fix" free nitrogen
from solution. Instead, nitrogen is taken up in organic form.

Subject: Beets for color




Darrell writes about beets in his high gravity ale:
(stuff deleted)
The color was wonderful...to the point that I want to call this one
"Purple Haze"....but after the boil the color seems to have melded into
the wort.  Does anyone know whether I could/ should extract more liquid
from several beets by boiling, and add this to the secondary?  I am of
course worried that there may be starches or off flavors that could be
departed along with the color...  Any ideas?  Or perhaps there is a safer
way to impart purple to a 5 gallon batch?
- ---------


I haven't used beets for beer, yet, but do have a batch of beet wine
fermenting.  I agree with the color, it's an awesome hot pink - florescent
purple mix.  It's in the very early fermenting stage but I couldn't resist
and had a taste over thanksgiving break.  It has a nice beet flavor and a
subtle beet bitterness as well.  I think with age, it should be quite
awesome or at least interesting.  The bitterness could be from the fact
that I used some older, bigger beets out of the garden.  Beets are best
when they are smaller/fresher.  Also, I left most of the skins on, this
may have added bitterness as well. 


So, from my limited experience, I would say to boil some beets (as if
serving for dinner).  The boiling will bring out the sweetness (convert
the starches) and color.  You could then add just the cooled solution to
the secondary, or both, the liquid and the beet mash.  In wine making,
keeping the fruit/veggie in the fermenter for about a week or so adds
color.  This is what I did with the wine.  Originally, the must (wort in
the wine world) looked blood red and now has the pink/purple cool looking
color.   If/when, doing a beet beer, I would make it light as possible
by using oly pale grains (superlight malt extract, for those non-mashers).

Subject: RE: Reusing yeast cake


Holey moley Batman


So I reused the Wyeast 1056 yeast cake of my 1.078 stout to make a
1.050 pale ale.  I siphoned off the stout into the bottling bucket
leaving behind about a liter of liquid over the yeast cake.  I dumped
in 2-3 gallons of boiled/cooled water and then siphoned in, through a
strainer, the aerated pale ale wort.  There wasn't a lot of gunge on
the sides of the plastic fermenter but I soaked a couple of paper
towels in EtOH and quickly wiped the sides and lid to ease the
worries.  I stirred the wort with a sanitized spoon, took a gravity
reading and shut it up tight. I went on to bottle the stout.  1 h
later, the airlock, which had been kinda sucking back as the wort
cooled from 78F, was looking as if it was showing positive pressure. 
Nah, I thought, and ignored it.  2 h later is was bubbling at 1
bubble/8 seconds!  That's a start 10 h faster than last batch!  This
morning, 5 h after pitching, the airlock is hanging on for dear life
as the bubbles are erupting about 6 bubbles/1 second.  Oh man am I
getting dizzy?  Air! I need air!  The basement is filling up with CO2.
 The fermentation is going a little warm at 74F, so maybe this is a
partial source of the activity, but dang!  I won't be surprised if the
lid blows off.  In summary, pitching on the yeast cake of the previous
batch makes a great starter, thus (hopefully) avoiding all the
headaches of a slow start.  I'm not worried about 'pulling off onto
the shoulder of "style"'(I like that phrase) with my stout/pale ale
1-2 punch, but others might consider this a faux pas.  But, this makes
for a *long* brewday (or night, in my case)- brewing and bottling in
the same session.  This was one brewday (night) I waited till the end
to 'relax-don't worry-have a homebrew.' We'll see how it turns out.
Laters,
Matt

Matthew,
Yes, if you have time, just sticking your hops in a paper bag will
oxidize them nicely.  I have made a couple of lambics, and both times I
"aged" the hops in my oven at a low temperature (<200F) for 90-120
minutes.  Baking them seems to have the same effect - essentially, you
want to drive off all the aromatic and flavor compounds.


Have fun,

Subject: CSA reduction, bottle air


Hello collective,
I just read the excellent article by George Fix on beer stability
in the latest "Brewing Techniques" and I want to try to reduce
the headspace air. Prof. Fix says that (paraphrasing here) homebrew
fillers can give very low levels of headspace air if one caps on
the foam. I've heard people here refer to "capping on foam" as well.
My problem is that I don't have any foam to cap on, in fact, I go
out of my way not to produce foam when bottling, since I thought
that would aerate the beer. Is Prof. Fix making the assumption
(unstated, I think) that one is using a counter-pressure bottle
filler? I don't have a CO2 setup and don't plan on getting one in
the near future, is there any way for me to cap on foam without
aerating the beer? Can I "cap on beer" (i.e. no headspace?)
I leave about 3/4 - 1 inch of headspace - probably >2 ml, way more
than recommended. With this much air and storage at room temperature
in order to carbonate, I get the feeling from this article that my
beer is always oxidized by the time it's ready to drink! 


Sorry for what may sound like stupid newbie questions, but this 
article has me a little confused.

I have launched a self education effort on water chemistry w.r.t.
brewing. I have found some very helpful things on-line by Ken Schwartz

spreadsheet. I am currently looking for the effect of boiling on the
water chemistry. I found an explanation by Dave Miller that states that
boiling will remove all but 30 to 40 ppm of the carbonate-bicarbonate
and that will result in the loss of 3 ppm of calcium for each 5ppm loss
of the carbonate-bicarbonate.


I would like to know if this is consistent with the view of the more
knowledgeable members of the group. What is the effect of boiling on pH?
I have searched the HBD archives with limited sucess. Its amazing how
often the words water and chemistry show up. Imagine that.
Is there reading material I can get my hands on to further my education.

A few months back, one of our local LCBO outlets had quite a
display of lambics and I picked up 8 bottles (Kreik and Framboise
for my wife and daughter-in-law). These were all finished with
the champagne style corks. Stored them in a wine rack in the
basement, on their side as I do with all my corked wines. 
This past Monday night my wife said she fancied a Framboise, went
to the basement and brought one upstairs. It had obviously been
leaking and she said a total of 6 out of the eight were leaking.
Luckily, when I opened it, I held the cork while undoing the wire
cage. The cork was under extreme pressure which had obviously
been forcing a small quantity of beer past the cork while it was
on its side.
On the other hand, if they had been stored upright, would all the
carbonation have gradually leaked out leaving 6 out of the 8
somewhat flat?
Sorry, I know I didn't answer your question, just posed another

And yet another solution....
Use a buffer pad (as in the buffer you use on floors) that is slighty larger
then the Phalse Bottom. Slide this down over the false bottom and bingo.
You've got something to hold it down, to avoid stuck sparges and little
recirculation of wort is needed to clarify. The drawback is cleaning it and
after a number of uses it may need replaced.

I agree, as we once rented a condo with a spot of distorted siding
about grill high, but if you can't beat them, join them!  You 
could try finding an old kettle grill, and mounting the kettle 
around your gas cooker, cutting openings as necessary to keep the
hose safe.  Mount it on a wheeled platform with your tank, and you
have the hottest Weber in town! Think how fast you could grill 
burgers, too! 


Seriously, if your cooker is UL approved, there should be no 
safety issues beyond those of a propane grill.

Don't call it a light beer. The politically correct term in "Mild"


Actually, a mild ale is an english beer with a low gravity, relatively
dark color, and good malt taste. So just tell your buddies you were
trying to make a mild ale...

Subject: yeast health/does early krausening lead to CAP?


I have started a large experiment comparing storage of yeast in water,
KH2PO4 buffer solution and NaCl solution.  Results will dribble in over the
next 6 months, but one early observation is worth reporting.


One of the yeasts in the experiment is a culture of Wyeast 1968 that I've
been maintaining in sterile DI water for over 4 years now.  (repeat for 4
years: store 6 months in water, culture onto wort agar, transfer into fresh
water)


As one measure of the health of this culture at the beginning of this
latest experiment, I grew it out on RDMA plates, which detect the presence
of respiratory deficient ("petite") mutants.  I counted a total of 721
colonies on 3 RDMA plates, of which only 4 were RD mutant, 0.6% of the
total.  Long term maintenance of the culture under DI water at room
temperature hasn't seemed to cause a RD problem. 


****
Donald Beistle wonders about a correlation between early exposure to
krausening-related beer advertising and an interest in the Classic American
Pilsner movement.  I grew up in Detroit drinking Stroh's...and my first
attempt at a CAP has been fermenting for 2 weeks now.  Draw your own
conclusions.


FWIW, I only vaguely remember Stroh's ads claiming krausening, but
distinctly remember wondering if "fire-brewed, Bohemian style" meant that
they stoked the fire with beatniks.
