In #2891 Donald muses on the high degree of interest in homebrewing CAPs in
the Upper Midwest--namely Wisconsin and Michigan.  Donald, I believe your
theory to be true; you might even add this "you can take the boy out of
Michigan. . ." tidbit to the positive evidence column.  I've been away from
my home state of Michigan for 13 years now, but my interest in brewing CAPs
stems directly from Carling's sponsorhip of the Tigers (Ken Caminiti:  "No
thanks, I'd rather not make that extra 2 million a year."), the memory of
long summer afternoons drinking beer with an old farmer, a strict Blatz man,
after we'd put the hay up, silly undergrad pilgrimages to Frankenmuth,
pitchers of Schlitz Dark at the Brown Jug in Ann Arbor.  And in Wisconsin. .
 . .well, now you're talking about one of the few places in the country that
has maintained strong regional affinities for locally brewed beers.

Charlie, so good of you to stop by and let us know about the AHA's 20th
anniversary. I mean that. Much has been said about merits and drawbacks of the
AHA, it's current leadership, direction and publication. But most agree that
it has made significant contributions to both the creation of and the
advancement of homebrewing. I have sat quietly on the sidelines when some have
bemoaned an erroneous article or poorly stated fact. But the bottom line is: I
like Zymurgy, the AHA homepage, enjoyed the hell out of the 1997 AHA
convention in Cleveland (we spoke about my barley wine specialty). I also like
Brewing Techniques, Brew Your Own, Malt Advocate. Let's face it. I enjoy just
about anything that promotes this passionate hobby of mine.


Now that I know that you can find your way onto the HBD, welcome, kick back
and have a homebrew. Let me tell you that you have a good man in Brian Rezac.
He is passionate and not afraid of taking on some constructive criticism. As
one of the groups that took part in Big Brew 98, he has recently contacted us
for input on Big Brew 99 (mark May 1st on your calendar). In fact, Rob
Moline's10/20 recipe is so bitching, I am coincidental brewing it again this
Saturday at a local homebrew shop (Brew & Grow) as a demo and the resulting
brew will be served at the proprietors wedding next September.Now I can tell
people about the 20th anniversary as well.


Just thought I would add a friendly, reasoned voice in anticipation that there
may be a few other views represented in tomorrow's HBD.

Congratulations to Charlie and the AHA on their 20th anniversary. It's
too bad the 7000 people who quit the AHA in the last two years won't
know about this historic event.


I'm glad Charlie took time to write HBD and let us know about it.
However, I wonder why it wasn't important enough to mention on their

I was also very excited to lay my hands on 3 bottles each of the Gueuze and
the Kriek.  Tried a Gueuze and was disappointed.  Very little brett
character.  It did have an off flavor that was kind of a medicinal phenolic,
bordering on metallic, that I found objectionable.  Nice complex sourness
with some acetic, but not as much as typical Cantillon.  The store owner
warned me about huge bottle-to-bottle variability, which I would have
anticipated anyway, so we'll see what the other 5 bottles have to offer.


Regarding hops, Matthew's plan sounds great.  I have some '94 Mt. Hood that I
obtained in late '96.  I spread these in a 4" layer on sheets in my garage
for several months (it's 50 lbs of hops).  They've been loosely bagged at
garage temps since then and they still have some good aroma.  Cheesy came and
went while they were on the floor.  Now they smell a bit like hay.  Be
prepared to wait.  A little baking can help you along too.

Subject: Is My Beer Ruined?


I started brewing an ale a few weeks ago, using Yeast Culture Kit Co.
American Ale, which I have used before with great results.  OG was 1.052,
fermentation temperature mid-60's.  I racked it the secondary after 10
days - I would have liked to have done this sooner, but it's a busy time of
year.  SG at racking was only 1.020, so I figured/hoped that racking would
rouse the yeast and get the gravity down a few more points.  I tasted it at
racking, and it was OK in spite of the slightly high SG.  Activity resumed
within a day.  However, it's been in the secondary for almost two weeks, and
it's still bubbling away - about a bubble/second or faster.  This activity
can't be from normal fermentation.  I suspect yeast autolysis, but I've
never experienced this before, so I'm not sure.  I'm afraid to bottle with
this much activity.  Any suggestions.  Should I bottle anyway, and hope I
don't get any grenades?  Should I just wait for as long as it takes to stop?
I have been advised to bring the temperature down to the low 30's if
possible to shock the yeast into submission - any comments on this?  Or
might I have a contamination or other problem that warrants tossing the
batch?  Any suggestions appreciated.


Brew On!

Not necessarily.
At first milds meant an ale that was served as soon as fermentation 
was complete before an acetic or lactic sourness occured. At the 
start of this century it meant an ale that was less heavily hopped 
than a pale ale. TODAY, it usually is the lowest gravity beer that a 
brewery produces, but there are a few exceptions.
You could still brew a higher gravity ale and call it a mild if you 
want, regardless what the AHA say :-)
Who really cares, as long as we are having fun!

Greetings,


Does anyone know which hops are used in Guiness? I am planning to brew
an all grain stout and would like it to be similar to Guiness. I
checked the recipes in the CM3 and found hardly two recipes using the
same hops.


There are 19 versions of Guinness brewed, just to make  your job 
easier!
However Foreign Extra Stout hops "...are a blend of several 
varieties, including Galena, Nugget and Target."
p176, The Ale Trail, R.Protz, 1995, Eric Dobby Publishing


I also read somewhere that Northdown was used a lot by Guinness 
Brewery, can't remember where though.

Subject: pLambic hops, Heilemans, brewing again


Hello-


I've been in the process of brewing a plambic since Jim Liddel's BT
articles. That's right, I'm aging hops. I left them in an open baggie,
not a paper bag. Is my beer ruined? Anyway, I suggest that brewers date
their aging hops. ("date their aging hops", I'm sure there a joke in
there)
- ---
As a yute in dear ol' Nebraska, my Norwegian buddy used to steal his
dad's beer. Svin only bought Heilemans. So we'd get 'full krausened' on
Old Style (aka Dog Style). That was before Colorado Koolaid flowed in to
the Cornhusker state. Those were the dazes.
- ---
I brewed my first batch of beer since moving to Detroit. I put it in my
freezer (outside) with a heater (on a controller) thinking it would be
cold enough to keep the temperature steady. Next morning, the temp was
at 70. Then I checked an hour later and it was at 75. I grabbed my other
controller and got the freezer back online. With the heater, the
freezer, and a fan, that baby is in a narrow range of 65-68.


I was unaware of just how much heat is generated by fermention. I wonder
if I could heat my house if...
- ---
This batch was a no sparge batch. I was pretty disappointed with the
whole process. I dropped from my usual 75% to 40%. I expected a drop in
efficiency. I assumed it would be about 55% but 40% really hurt my
feelings. 20 pounds of grain for less than 5 gallons of 1.056 beer.


I also had some [no] sparge trouble. I got a lot of particles in the run
off about half way through. I use a false bottom. I am at a loss to
understand why I got particles after it had ran clear. Anyone else have
problems like this.


I doubt I'll do much no sparge brewing because of the sparging trouble
and the dismal efficiency. At least for now.
- ---
No sparge is nice because you don't have to worry about heating sparge
water. No need for a three tier stand, sparge tank, or a sparging
manifold. Might be a good way to get started all grain brewing since it
eliminates quite a bit of the hassles.

Please don't do things like this, for two reasons.


1) Non-standard wiring methods are *explicitly* forbidden by the
National Electrical Code (Section 300-3, et. al., in the '93 NEC,
newly released '99 code probably identical).  This is to protect the
*next* guy who works on your wiring - even though I'm sure you would
remove all this non-standard wiring when you move.


2) If, Heaven Forbid, there were a fire in your home, and it was
determined by the Fire Marshall to be an electrical fire, and the Fire
Marshall found the non-standard wiring in your garage (and even if
that wiring had *nothing* to do with the fire), your insurance company
might use that as a pretext to void your homeowner's insurance, and
pay you _nothing_.


Sorry to be a wet blanket.


Have you asked an electrician for a quote with the "two cases of
homebrew when you're done" discount? :-)

Hi, Ian.  I have the 10-gal Gott and wouldn't trade it for the world.  
Actually, I have two of them.  I use one with a Phil's Phalse Bottom 
and the other is my HLT (Hot Liquor Tank).  Using a 10-gal Gott will 
allow you to do some higher-gravity beers (more grain).  I don't know 
what a 5-gal Gott sells for but I think the additional cost for the 
10-gal is very justified.  It just gives you more options.


I just went out to the Rubbermaid web site but couldn't find any info 
on the Gott.  I submitted a question about them and would assume a 
response will follow.  You might want to do the same thing.

Hope this helps,

Well, since you specifically asked, I do.  Actually, it's a homemade
version, but pretty close to the original.  I've used it for several years
(even before I converted to RIMS) with no problems.  Never a stuck sparge,
even with unmalted wheat.  It seems to work fine in conjunction with the
pump.  Let me know if you have any specific questions about it.

hello fellow beer drinkers
just moved from glacier park montana where you could buy brewing
supplies to an area  where they sell nothing.........
i live about an hour west of the twin cites in wisconsin.
i need to find a source to buy supplies to start brewing again........
need  also to find a source where i can get hops that are not in the
shape of
rabbit pellets.........and real malt from 50 gallon drums..........


thank you    arlen`at`spacestar.net

Subject: Aeration and lag times


I don't know if this has already been covered in previous posts, so bear
with me.


I was force-carbonating a 3-gallon corny keg last weekend for a party.  You
know the routine -- crank up the pressure and shake-shake-shake.  During the
project, I looked over at my 10-gallon corny keg and wondered if I could
apply the same concepts to force-aerating wort.  For example:  


Take my 8-gallon batch, decant it into the corny keg after the boil.  
Crank up the pressure using compressed air.  
Shake-shake-shake.  
Pump the beer into a fermenter.


This will only work if you have a compressor and inline air filter (so you
don't get compressor spooge in the beer).  I really haven't had a problem
with lag times or beer quality, but it's something I'm going to try.


I'll keep the board posted...

Your speaker is misinformed. Soluble gaseous nitrogen (from air) provides no
nutrient value. Unlike soybeans, brewing yeast is unable to "fix" free
nitrogen
from solution. Instead, nitrogen is taken up in organic form.

Our club has been invited to use the 7 barrel brewing equipment at the
brewpub.  It is just sitting there idle.  It sounds like a great opportunity
for the club.  We will be brewing for Abita, with the beer to be supplied to
the brewpub taps.  We will be working for Abita, under their license.  We
are planning on a single test brew, and if things go well we may do it on a
somewhat regular schedule.  Abita has offered to train us and supply all
grain and hops, etc.

Subject: Headless Stout Question/Blow-Off??




Hi All. After seeing the lengthy rant by Scott Abene in the last HBD I can
only hope I may squeeze this question in between all the flames that will
probably ensue!


Here's my question: Just made a simple all-grain stout. Base was 2-row
with 1# roasted barley, 1# flaked barley and 1/2# cara-pils. Except for
the roast, all were mashed together in a single 65degC step x 90 min.
Yeast was 1084. OG was a bit low at about 1.034, FG was 1.005 which made
me happy since I was going for a dry stout. The problem is that there is
virtually NO HEAD to the final beer which surprised me greatly given the
use of the # of flaked barley. I have always gotten good heading in the
past whenever I've used flaked  *wheat* but I thought one gets the same
effect from flaked barley - is this not the case??


TO BLOW OR NOT TO BLOW - THAT IS THE QUESTION 
(No Monica jokes, please!)


There's another factor here that I'd like to see some discussion on. I had
filled my glass carboy fermentor quite full and pitched a LOT of yeast so
I had LOTS of activity and therefore a fair amount of blow-off (used a
blow-off tube) about 4-5 cups blow-off collected in total. Could this
amount of blow-off have taken much of the head-forming/head-retaining
compounds with it?? Through the reading I've done I believe the consensus
is that the loss of the foaming blow-off material does not (significantly)
reduce the head-forming ability of the final beer. This has always seemed
counter-intuitive to me. 


Also I am wondering what is the general consensus
on the use of blowing-off is. It seems that the reviews are mixed - some
sources say it is *essential* in that it helps to remove fusel alcohols
(though why these would prefferentially be collecting up near the top is a
mystery to me) and insoluble hop resins in the krausen head which one
wants to eliminate before they have a chance to drop back into the beer
when the krausen falls. While it does seem that there are plenty of these
sticky "resins" collecting up there it also seems to me that 1) they tend
to stick to the top of the carboy and stay up there when the krausen falls
and 2) that if they are insoluble to begin with it shouldn't matter if
they fall back down as they will not go into solution (unless they do so
slowly over time or as the % alcohol increases?). It also seems to me that
if you are using a truly "top-cropping" ale yeast you'll be blowing off a
fair amount of your active yeast which will be counter-productive.


I have made beers where I had lots of blow-off and others where I've
had none and haven't detected any major off-flavors or harshness that I
could pin specifically on the beers that weren't blown off. So what's the
collective wisdom (an oxymoron?) on this subject??

Subject: All Grain Ramblings, Duvel culture, Questions


        I always get a little chuckle out of those posts that say all
grain only takes a few more hours (8?) why doesn't everyone make the
switch.  Well with two 3-4 yr old boys my brewing sessions usually start
at 9PM and go for a couple of hours!  Time?  What's that?  I've been
interested in all grain but don't expect to have the time very often,
mostly I'll stick to extract.  I also try to brew two batches at once so
that I limit my brewing to about once a month.  


Mill:   Well I wanted to use my Gott cooler for a second time and my
brand new Corona Mill.  Thanks for the recent advice on adjusting
Coronas, there are no instructions on adjusting the Mill.  I tried the
"tighten all the way then back off 1/2 - 1 turn."  One turn seemed about
right and then I tried maybe an 1/8 turn more backoff since I wasn't
sure what the grains should look like.  They looked more like Grits than
the precrushed stuff I usually get from the homebrew store.  No sparge
problems though with the "grits".  At any rate I crushed about 10# of
grain (5# pale, 1.5# wheat, and 3.5# of 2 or 6-row).  The grains were
given to me by a friend who didn't have time to brew so I just made up
my own recipe.  I also added 1/2# of 90L German crystal malt to the
kettle and used the hot sparge outflow to steep the crystal.  


Mash:    My brewing consisted of about 20-30 minutes of crushing the
malt the night before, getting up early to heat 3 gallons of water for
mashing, and doing an ALL DAY MASH.  My initial temp with about 3.1
gallons of water was about 165F and when I added the grains it seemed to
drop to 150F which I think was probably just a low reading at the top of
the Gott cooler, I was expecting a little warmer.  Left it to mash all
day and close to brewing time it was still 142F!!!  Wow, that Gott works
really well I was worried about it cooling off much more than that.


Sparge:   I cheat a little... Well, the wife was at a play so I boiled
some water and did a sparge while the kids played a little and had some
cookies ~7PM.   That way when the kids were in bed and at my usual 9PM
start I already had the sparge done.  I'm still on the stove so I
collected about 4 gallons of about 1.057-60 in a 5 gallon pot and
another 1.5 gallon of about 1.020 in my 4 gallon pot for a second batch
of extract based beer.  I boiled the batch down from 4 gallons to about
3.5 gallons but then added water back to get about 4.5 gallons in the
low 50s gravity.  


Boil/Yeast:  The rest of the all grain batch went as usual and by 11PM I
was done with both the extract batch and the all grain batch and
cleanup.  I used the Duvel starter that I tried a month ago, starting
with the 11 oz bottle, stepped up to 1/2 gallon, then poured off a quart
and added another 1/2 gallon of fresh wort.  Both batches started the
next morning using the Duvel starter but they are going relatively
slowly, maybe 1 bubble per 5 secs instead of 1 bubble/sec.  I thought
maybe the yeast thought 68F was too cool since my usual ale yeasts are
much faster.  I looked at Rajotte's Belgian book again last night on
yeasts and he mentioned that secondary yeasts added at bottling time
tend to be slow starters.  Maybe I've got just the bottling yeast in my
Duvel.  Anyone know for sure about this yeast?  I guess for now it seems
to be fermenting even if it seems slow so I'll just give it a few weeks
before bottling. 


  I still don't have a good bulkhead connection to my Gott cooler, just
a small hose jammed into a cutoff water spigot and a clamp to control
flow.  I need to work on improving that.  I spent some time at the
hardware store but couldn't find a good system.  My rectangle of copper
tubing seems to work well with no sparge problems even though I thought
my holes were too big.  Any help here on bulkhead fixtures?
   Thanks for all the wonderful inputs on the HBD and especially Karl
and Pat for keeping the HBD going.  As for me, I thank Charlie Papazian
for his book that got me started.  Though I think Al K's Homebrewing I
book is much better and more thorough for those looking for a good
starting book.

I'm replying to this and ccing the HBD because I thought it was of general
interest and Hugh agreed.  Indeed the positive controls showed no growth
and even now they show no growth even upon retesting. Does this mean the
media won't support growth?  Highly unlikely since these same bottles of
media were used to test mammalian cell culture media and the positive
controls grew microorganisms.  In this case we cough directly into the
growth media.  But you'd be surprised at the incidence of positive tests
due to operator (i.e. grad student) error even when working in a class
2/Type A laminar flow hood.

Maybe.  First off the reason for this testing was to evaluate whether my
pompous statement about buffer promoting growth better than water was true
in the specific use of storing yeast.  If microorganisms end up in the
water or buffer and then they are transferred to the YM and MRS (both very
rich growth media) then they should reproduce.  We should not have to wait.
But as a follow up I  still had all the tubes when you sent me this e-mail.
So I retested all the samples I had.  It's been something like 10 days and
again none of the samples or controls are showing any growth.

But it does not matter.  If bacteria fell into the water or buffer, they
would in theory not die in the two hour time frame.  So then when a sample
is put into rich growth media the microorganisms should thrive.  And again
further testing failed to show positive growth.

No.  Again the reason for doing this test was to test, in general, how well
thsi technique works and is it subject to contamination.  Let's look at
this in a real world situation.  I choose the 12 X 75 mm tubes because they
represent a tube size that would likely be used by those storing yeast in
water or buffer.  And I then left them out for two hours to represent a
worse case scenario.  Typically if one were storing yeast in water the tube
would only be open for a matter of seconds.  I'll point out though that
this testing was done in a lab.  But it is a far from clean lab, we do cell
culture, but we also do various chromatography work, animal studies,
molecular biology stuff, and I have my running stuff hanging in here also.
I also placed the tubes in areas under ventilation vents.  


So I wanted this to be a test that some what represented a real world
situation, not some ideal that 99% of you will never achieve.  Now this is
a single study, done in one place.  I have not a study with tubes that
contain yeast and are then checked for contamination.  This requires adding
various combinations of antibiotics and antifungals to test all the
permutations.  I'll get right on it. :-)  But I think in general (no this
isn't a PhD defense meeting so I'll go out on a limb and make a few leaps
of faith)   that this shows that neither water nor buffer are very good
growth media alone.  And that one can safely do a certain amount of culture
work with out risk of cross contamination provided one is careful and uses
good techniques.  Yes I've been doing this stuff for years.  I think it
shows that water or buffer stored offer reasonable alternatives to petri
dishes or slants for the average person.  500 grams of USP grade pottasium
phosphate monobasic can be had for ~$30.  This is enough to make alot of 2%
solution.  I have often wondered why some enterprising induhvidual does not
distribute yeast cultures in water or buffer.  A homebrew shop could have
100 tubes in a very small space.  If one used polypropylene tubes of 1.5 ml
capacity this would work well.  All the brewer would have to do is invert
the tube a few time to suspend the yeast, wipe of the tube with 70%
isopropyl and pour the contents into 100 ml of wort.  And then step up
again.  One could even make kits that include the tube of yeast and a 50 ml
tube of sterile media.  In theory one could have 10 strains of yeast on
hand in a very small box.  And there would be less waste since the storage
time for these would in theory be longer than that for things like wyeast
or white labs since people would know stepping up would be required.


WRT to water vs buffer experiments still need to be done to look a the
kinetics of the loss of viability using tissue culture/endotoxin free water
and tissue culture grade buffers.

I am using a phils phalsebottom in my RIMS unit.  I am using a stainless
steel pot not a gott.  I took a silicone stopper and plug the hole in the
center and just use the thing as a true false bottom with a drain
underneath.  I also put a piece of tubing around the edge to act as a
gasket to make sure it stays in place.  and I put some stainless bolts into
it near the center to keep it from collapsing so much.  It works OK, but I
am looking at getting some a piece of perf steel from Small Parts that has
more open area, even though I have not had any problems so far.  I've only
used my RIMS 4 times.

Subject: Lag times


John Varaday's data about the use of Air, O2, Shaking and Spray methods
of getting O2 into solution is interesting.  But I don't know if one can
draw a conclusion about whether the longer/shorter lag times are
beneficial or not from this.  The point is to get yeast growth and
activity as quickly as possible to beat the other beasties to the
goodies.  Yeast growth and reproduction is greatest in the presence of
O2 and other required nutrients.  Should yeast be placed into a wort
medium that was not conducive to growth but rather more quickly to
fermentation, it would seem that you might recognize the evidence of
feremenation (bubbles out the air lock) sooner with less OK than with a
much higher concentration of O2.  But because of the smaller volume of
yeast be in worse shape in terms of being in competition with other
yeasts and bacteria than the samples with the higher O2, rapidly growing
brewers yeast colony and less resulting CO2 early.   I'm sure that the
biochemists on-line can provide more detail but the logic seems to be in
favor of greater yeast growth, not necessarily which start producing CO2
the soonest.

Subject: headspace air


collective homebrew conscience:


andrew wrote in and asked about headspace air for bottle conditioned beers,
specifically, how to "cap on foam" if you're not counterpressure bottling
from a pressure vessel.


good question.  there are a number of ideas on how to reduce air in the
headspace.  dave miller has suggested in at least one of his books that you
leave absolute minimal headspace by filling the bottle to nearly full.  i've
done this accidentally (and on purpose), and it seems like the carbonation
of those bottles takes a really long time, and the final level of
carbonation doesn't get as high as other bottles from the same batch that
had 1/2 to 3/4 inch of headspace.


one other method that gets suggested is to rest the bottlecaps on the
bottles for an hour, without crimping them, and during this time the yeast
will create co2 and dilute the air in the headspace.  i've done this also,
but i have no idea if it really works.  maybe some of the yeast experts
could comment on this?  does yeast really get going right away and produce
enough co2 to fill the headspace?


now here's a story about how i was able to cap on foam with a bottle
conditioned beer:  i brewed and briefly lagered (~3 weeks) a german pilsner
a couple years ago, and it was lagered in a carboy in the freezer at 54
- -->32 deg f.  when it came time to bottle, i didn't let the beer warm up to
room temperature before i put the beer in the bottling bucket and added the
sugar.  during the transfer from carboy to bucket, a lot of co2 came out of
the beer, due to the temperature rise.  the same thing happened while
filling the bottles - lots of co2 and some foam.  i was able to "cap on
foam" even though i was not bottling from a pressure vessel.  the beer
turned out fine (dave miller gave it a 39 - 2nd place at stl hb comp), maybe
a little too carbonated.  i didn't think to reduce the amount of priming
sugar due to the larger amount of co2 in solution at the lower temperature.
i have never repeated this method on purpose, but i suspect it would be hard
to do with an ale yeast.  the reason there was lots of co2 in the beer at 32
deg f was because the lager yeast had continued to ferment as the
temperature was dropped from 54 down to 32.  you'd likely never be able to
achieve this with an ale yeast, since it would quit working and stop
producing co2 at a much higher temp.  (plus why would you lager an ale,
excluding the german styles?)  i think also you have to make sure to start
ramping the temperature down while there is still some fermentable extract
in the beer.  how you determine that is... well, it's up to you.

Any fermentables from pumpkin would be in the starch. You would need
to mash this starch with your barley.
Adding pumpkin juice to your boil will possibly add some pumpkin
flavor and some unfermentable starch. See how it comes out, but next
year, add the juice (or the pumpkin mush) to the mash.


Good luck.
