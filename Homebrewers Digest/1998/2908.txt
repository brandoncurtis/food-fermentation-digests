Subject: Re: yeast culturing




As long as things are slow, and yeast culturing has come up, this is
my $0.02 on necessities of the craft.


agar - works much (much) better than gelatin and is actually cheaper.


innoculation loop - at first I used a paper clip because a decent loop
will cost about $15-20, but it is well worth the investment (reach the
bottom of a test tube with a paper clip).


alcohol lamp - burns hotter, cleaner, and more conveniently than other
options.  get the high-octane denatured alcohol as well.


petri dishes (2 minimum) - workhorses of yeast harvesting.  used for
everything.


stir plate and magnetic stir bar - necessary for rapid growth when
stepping-up from a petri dish to pitching quantity.


pressure cooker - sterile is necessary.  I use mine more than any
other piece of brewery equipment.  It's not even close for second
place.


There are other pieces, such as ehrlenmeyers or test tubes, but the
ones above seem to be the most commonly short-changed.  The above
equipment does seem like overkill, but I started with the barest
items, and little hard information, and learned the hard way.  You can
work with a Bic lighter and a paper clip, and pray that your yeast
will grow fast enough to out-race any contaminants, but you'll have
much better results if you invest a few $$ up front.

Can anyone tell me how this relates to second (or first)-hand smoke?
Does this mean that workers in a smoky pub are constantly impaired in

Can anyone give me any information on recipe formulation for Anderson
Valley Hop Ottin IPA. I am particularly interested in the hop selection.
I heard from a sometimes reliable source the dry hops are columbus which
this man read in an article. He did not know which magazine. Any leads
would be appreciated. Any guesses?


If you have not tried this beer and you like lots of hops give it a try.

In HBD #2907 responding to a keg cleaning question, Frank Timmons
writes:


                                "I wouldn't worry about the fact that
your keg is not shiny. Stainless steel forms a tightly adhering passive
layer of chromium oxide that is fairly dull. This is a desired thing,
because the passive layer is very corrosion resistant. If you do manage
to get it shiny, it won't stay that way, and it will be leaching chrome,
iron and nickel oxides into your beer. That is a bad thing."


 ...right after I had just touted the benefits of shining up my keg with
an abrasive wheel.   Oops!  Guess I'm not gonna do that too much!  It
does seem useful however to shine the thing up the first time since
there's usually so much gook on it.  So this begs the question... is
there a process by which you can induce the protective layer of chromium
oxide after aggressively cleaning the gook with an abrasive?  Does it
just form naturally over time?  I've got two more kegs to clean up...

My converted keg fermenter works just fine, but, trying to be like the 
big
boys, I've decided to weld in a conical bottom just to make things a 
little
easier.  Here, in the nethers of Montana, there just doesn't seem to be a


fab-shop capable of rolling a 316L Stainless Steel 40 degree cone down to
 a
small enough opening, say 1-1 1/2".  Has anyone tried this before?  I 
really
don't want to cobble that many triangles together, just because of the 
time
involved, not to mention trying to achieve a smooth finish on the I.D.  
If
anyone knows of a fabricator with this kind of service, your shared 
knowledge
won't be wasted on me.  


Maybe I just have too much spare time on my hands, NAH, wait till you see
 the
steam fired boiling kettle.
Anyway, TIA.

the fruit fly bitter -  it is conceivable that the fruit fly in the starter
damaged the beer somewhat.  it placed only third at the st louis brews happy


holiday homebrew competition.  i haven't gotten the judges comments back
yet.


I am afraid that if I found a fruit fly in my starter, I would start over or
use a fresh yeast pack and forgo the starter completely.  Fruit flies are a
primary carrier of wild yeast and your starter would have been heartily
contaminated.  You probably have a bit of acetic acid in your beer, too.

Subject: Mead Some Questions Answered


I'm attempting my fist mead soon. It's a simple recipe: 15 lbs. honey, acid
blend, yeast energizer, Irish Moss, and Wyeast Sweet Mead Yeast (#3184).
Questions: 1. To make a yeast starter the yeast package says to add the
yeast to diluted fruit juice. What kind of juice? How much diluted? Is it OK
to use DME instead? 2. Should I use my Oxygenator to aerate the must once it
is in the carboy? 3. Is mead subject to oxidation due to hot side aeration?
4. Is it critical, as with beer, to quickly cool the must? Should I use my
wort chiller? 4. My recipe calls for 6 months of bottle aging. Should I cap
with oxygen absorbing caps? Thanks.

1) I saw several messages ion the archives saying not to use bleach to
clean them because of oxidation of the plastic interior.  Is this true, and
if not bleach what can you use to sanatize them?


2) Saw several posts that said most kegs use 2-4 cartridges to dispense

Subject: Bugs


What is the experience of other homebrewers regarding bugs in the malted
barley?


On several occasions, I have purchased grains from my homebrew shop, which I
consider to be reliable and has a good turnover of stock.  Recently, I have
started crushing my malt at home with my motorized maltmill (another whole
story), but first, I put the paper bag containing the grains into a white
plastic bucket for a day or so until I am ready to crush.


When I open the sealed bucket a couple of days later, I notice about a dozen
weevils, easily seen in the white plastic bucket.  They have apparently
migrated from inside the grain and bag to the bucket.  Maybe for water? Or
air?  I would not see these bugs so easily in the barley malt, but this day
or two of storage has caused them to reveal themselves.


So my question is, how common is this, is this something that we just do not
discuss and glance away, (see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil), or am I
getting buggy malt.


The beer tastes fine by the way!


What say out there, anyone wishing to email me some data, I will later post
the results.

To the electrically inclined,


I have a friend who aquired a restaurant. He gave me a Beverage-Aire beer
cooler complete with two taps on top (I know, eat your hearts out). I ran a
20 amp circuit to my brew room just for it. I installed a GFI outlet for it
because it is beside my sink. It ran fine for about two weeks. Now it has
begun tripping the outlet. Everytime I reset, it immediately trips again. I
can plug other things into it with no problem. Please help I have a lager
conditioning in there.


BTW, I've had the temp around 50 for the lager's primary. There is some
condensation in there.

Subject: munton's malt


collective homebrew conscience_


i've used munton's pale malt in a couple of english bitters this year, and
i'm finding that it doesn't taste to me like it is exhibiting enough of a
"kilned" character in the final product.  also the color is paler than i
would like.  my fix for this year is to include some vienna malt for the
remaining beers.


maybe i'm expecting too much?  there must be british pale malts out there
that give a nice light toasty malt profile.  my only previous experience
with ale malt was dwc, which was fine, but i never brewed strict bitter
recipes and usually augmented with significant crystal malt, so the
character of the base malt was more difficult to detect. i'm trying to get
away from large (>.5lb) crystal malt additions for the bitter recipes.

Subject: To AHA or not to AHA?


I've followed the recent threads on AHA with mild interest.  I have no
strong feelings and I'm unlikely to join.  But I think that makes me a
fairly typical homebrewer, so perhaps my views on all this should be
of interest to anyone trying to boost membership.  (Did you catch the
twisted logic in that?  Wheeee!  Maybe I just like to talk about
myself.)


There is simply no incentive for me to join AHA.
I've browsed Zymurgy while waiting in line in homebrew shops. It
didn't seem worth the money.
GABF?  Don't care.  There are more than enough festivals close to home.
Competition?  Never been to one, never entered one.
Legalization efforts?  OK, this is important.  Although the laws in my
community are not a problem, I can see parting with a few bucks to
help my homebrewing brethren who are still under the yoke of
puritanical oppression.


So what would I look for in a homebrewers' organization?
Anything that helps me brew better beer, makes it easier or more
efficient, or exposes me to new ideas and techniques.
Active discussion on any topic of interest to homebrewers.
Experienced brewers helping newbies.  (And sharing the newby's joy in
success!  After all, we're all newbies at some aspect or other of this
stuff.)
Consumer Reports type coverage of products, naming names, no holds
barred, candid discussion.
Recipes.


Seems to me I get most of what I need from HBD.  Maybe someday I'll
see a reason to join AHA or whatever organization replaces it.  In the
meantime, I'll occasionally send a few measly dollars to the janitors,
keep reading and keep learning.

I always try to keep an ear out for metals questions, but apparently a
couple snuck by when I wasnt looking:


Randy said something about pickling tarnished stainless steel with
hydrochloric acid.
DONT DO IT.
There are less nasty ways to clean stainless. Use Scotchbrite pads or
wheels like Pete Ratkiewich recommends and some oxalic acid based
cleanser like Revereware or Kleen King or Bar Keepers Friend. Rinse well
after use and let the keg sit for a week or so to repassivate itself
before use.


As a followup, Mark Bayer asks if he should do anything special after
using his stainless pot.
In a word, No.  Use a sponge and some mild dish detergent like Ivory or
B-Brite to help clean it out, and then rinse and store.  Do not
aggressively clean it after every use, it is not necessary and can be
counterproductive to its corrosion resistance.

Subject: Adjustable mills


"George De Piro" <George_De_Piro`at`berlex.com>
    
     "There are some very good reasons to desire an adjustable malt
     mill.  Here are some of them:
     
     "1.  Different malts are different sizes and require different 
gap sizes to efficiently mill them......


The first half is a given but the follow up needs to be proven or at
least screams for a definition of the word "is", er, rather the
word "efficiently".  Can this "efficiently" actually be measured
or tasted?  If so (which I doubt) is the measured value significant?


"  Wheat malt is not properly crushed in a mill that is optimized
 for two-row barley.  Some raw grains are even smaller.


But what if the mill is optimized for all known types of malt?
This may sound pompous but why are you assuming that the fixed
mill is optimized for two-row barley and later on you even draw
a distinction between US and European two row.


"     2.  In my experience one of the most common causes of poor
     extraction efficiency is poorly crushed malt.  While water
     chemistry and sparging technique play a role in extraction
     efficiency, they are secondary to a proper crush.
 
As a manufacturer of both milling and lautering equipment, I could
not disagree with you more.  Once one gets out of the Corona class,
varying the crush is tweeking at the margins.  Virtually every
customer I have ever talked to with yield problems blamed on the
mill, eventually found that the problem was either the malt or 
the lauter system or process.  I would put the greatest burden
for variability on the malt, in particular, bottom end American
malt.


"     3.  Of concern to commercial breweries (and maybe a couple of
     fanatical homebrewers) is that rollers wear out with time.
     Adjustability allows the gap to remain optimized throughout the
     mill's life.
 
Good point but we offer hardened rollers for such applications 
which will out live the brewer.  It is certainly not a consideration
for the homebrewer.  Furthermore, the large scale commercial brewer
deals in volumes large enough to worry about small variations in
effciency.  The homebrewer can't even see them much less worry.


"        Achieving a proper crush is crucial to the quality of your 
beer. Overly-crushed malt can cause slow or stuck lauter runoff or
yield wort of poor clarity.......


Good point but (at least with OUR fixed mill), one can not over crush
any malt that I know of.  In fact, another virture of our one-sided
adjustment is the same point.  As one side maintains the nominal 
spacing, you can not over crush no matter what you do to the other 
side.  You may get more fines that you need but it can never really be 
excessive.
     
" Keep in mind that European 2-row is slightly larger than 
American 2-row.....




Again, I suspect this is a "so-what".  How much is slightly?  Does
it really matter in a mill with the proper nominal spacing?


I will answer that myself.  


We offer an adjustable mill for the folks who think it does.

All -


In my never-ending quest to reduce the batch cost of my brews, I recently
had the bright (but seemingly short-sighted) idea of buying my hops in bulk
and using them as needed.  I had heard that a Dazey Seal-A-Meal type thingy
(with the heat strip that goes all the way across) could re-seal the O2
barrier bags that the hops come in.  


With this in mind, I ordered about 3 pounds of my favorite varieties of
hops, and planned to buy a sealer at the store or over the net. However, my
search for one of these things has been about as successful as a search of
the AOB website for useful brewing info.  
(  :-D couldn't help it . . . )  So, my yummy hops all sit in the freezer,
as yet unused.


Anyone have any idea where I can get one, and not have to pay $150 like the
one that is used in my local brew shop??  Anyone have one they'd like to
sell that's not trashed??  The only ones I can find are those "Eurosealer"
things that make a ridiculous little seal about as big as a staple.


Any help would be appreciated . . .

Subject: Lo/Hi Pressure Burners & CO


Greetings!!


I'm trying to decide whether to build my home brewery in the basement 
or garage of the 1940's vintage Cape my wife and I are in the process 
of purchasing.  The basement would be much more convenient, and there's 
much more space available.  On the other hand, the garage seems best 
suited since I can open that big old door and get all the ventilation I need - 
of course, I'd freeze my butt off in the winter...


The determining factor for me is going to be whether or not I can safely 
operate two burners (either propane or natural gas) in the basement.  
I've been avidly following the brewery setup thread most recently initiated 
by Al K.  In his most recent post on this subject, Al included a message 
he received from Harlan Bauer, who suggests using low pressure burners, 
due to the fact that high pressure burners are very inefficient & produce 
a lot of carbon monoxide.


So, my question is, how can I tell which burners are either high or low 
pressure??


American Brewmaster Home Brewing Supply Shop 
(http:\\americanbrewmaster.com, and I'm not affiliated or even a customer, 
yada, yada...) offers several propane cookers & parts for sale.  More 
specifically, they offer low & high pressure cast burners and low & high 
pressure regulators.  They state that the high pressure burner puts out 
170,000 BTU, and the low pressure burner 35,000 BTU.  Can I assume 
that this statement generally covers all burners??  (Meaning high pressure 
= 170,000 BTU, low pressure = 35,000 BTU, or similar numbers.)


Many of you out there might be saying "Well, why don't you just call 
the supplier and ask them whether the burner they sell is high or low 
pressure??"  Well, I've done this a few times, and mostly I've encountered 
individuals who know little or nothing about homebrewing and all the 
related equipment/ingredients/process (these have all been mail order 
suppliers).  I'm not bashing mail order home brew suppliers here, I'm just 
saying that a lot of the time, the people they hire to man the phones 
usually don't have a lot of home brewing knowledge.


Sorry for the lengthy post, but I definitely want to get the correct 
information before I make any purchases, or lay any tile. ;^)  Also, there's 
the potential health risk to the family unit...


TIA!!


Merry Christmas & Hoppy Brew Year!!

Gail, ummm, I'm not trying to be a smart-ass, but after seeing your return
address it could be interpreted that way...  Brewers Resource has them, and
their URL is: http://www.brewtek.com

Subject: Honey Stoudt




Brewsters:


Earl Bright wants to brew a Honey "Stoudt" and asks how much honey to 
use:


Well, first, I knew a Jeannie Stoudt in high school who was a honey and
stout she was, especially below the shoulders and in all the right 
places.
Secondly, honey is a delicately flavored source of sugar and the roasted
malts and grains in a stout will largely mask any flavor contribution 
from
the honey, I imagine.  If you really want to use honey in your stout, I
would go with the more strongly flavored honeys and avoid the clovers
Wildflowers and such. Maybe try Eucalyptus or the darker honeys.
Actually, I would recommend you spend your honey money on some to
use in say lager malt based beers if you want to taste and smell a
difference.


If you are using extracts and don't know if its 100% malt extract or not,
 I
would not use any honey at all, since I had a bad expereince once with a
John Bull Stout which would not finish, I imagined due to too low a
FAN as a result of added glucose at the factory. British cans don't have
the same labelling laws as the US.  Adding honey to an extract may
produce an incomplete fermentation if other sugars have already been 
added.


Look in Joy of Homebrewing or elsewhere for the sugar content in honey,
but I believe it is about 82% by weight for commercial honey. You can
check this by diluting a known amount of honey to a certain volume
and measuring the SG . JoHB has some tables as does every other HB book
to allow you to convert it.  If you want to add the honey, and you want
the maximum flavor/aroma impact, do not boil it, add it just as you are
turning off the kettle, cover the kettle and let it sit for about 10
minutes
and then cool it as normal.  This will likely be sufficient to kill all 
the
bacteria
and molds which are resident in the honey, but prevented from fermenting
it by the high sugar content.


And now to answer your question. Use enough honey that about 15% of your
fermentables will come from the honey. Add all of your hops early in the
boil
and do not add aroma hops. This amount will lighten the malt flavor and 
if
the
honey has not been boiled, will impart a delicate aroma. Even though much


of
the aroma will have been lost during fermentation.


An alternative scheme is to add this amout of honey during the secondary
fermention ( I.E. after the rip-roaring fermentation is finished), rack 
it
onto
the honey solution which has been taken to 170F covered and held
fifteen minutes and cooled. Be sure to leave some head room as this
fermentation will re-start, sometimes actively, depending on the OG
of the beer. 






Keep on brewin'

I always have wanted to write a book and thought maybe I have the writing
skills to do it. Now I know the title -  "Bonehead Brewer Tricks - the
compleate idiots guide".


I always thought it was a good idea to soak those carboys for 24 hours in a
stiff bleach solution. It cleans 'em up really nice and sanitizes all in one
easy step. A good rinse and you're done! 


Well its always worked really well for me, at least right up until last
night. You see, I brew on my patio, under the upstairs deck, out of the rain
and direct sunlight. Some of you have been here and know what a truly great
place it is to brew with a fabulous view of the sierra snow caps to the east
and right below a great panoramic view of Deer Valley. Well, that patio is
also where I store my soaking carboys and kegs.


On Saturday I set a 5 gallon carboy out there full of water/bleach just for
a soak and cleaning. You know whats coming don't you? Yup, this morning its
18 degrees faranheit out there and I've got a nicely shattered carboy on the
patio. Its interesting to look at, shattered in a million pieces yet still
standing there like its really intact. Like a shattered windshield that will
fall into a pile at the slightest touch.


Duh. Its winter.

Subject: Vinegar


        
Hello all,


Planning my next brew and  Id like to save a few 
gallons to make some malt vinegar.  A very good 
friend uses malt vinegar for pickeling and 
cooking  I have never made vinegar before and 
would like to know if anyone can help me with a 
few questions.




Which would be better hopped or unhopped wort?
Does it need to be boiled?
Is a starter needed?  The starter comes in a jar and 
it is supposed to be enough for 5 gallons.
If I want to make more vinegar with this bacteria, 
can I streak in on a plate or slant?  




Is it easy to make good vinegar and get good 
results?
  


I am planning to be very careful with the vinegar so 
I do not contaminate my regularly used brewing 
equipment.


TIA
