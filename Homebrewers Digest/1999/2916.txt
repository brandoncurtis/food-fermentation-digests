Subject: Lagering and repitching yeast


I have made my first lager, an Oktoberfest. It is going to lager for 7
weeks at 40 degrees F. It will be bottle conditioned after the lager
period. My question is; Will I have to pitch more yeast when I bottle, or
will there be enough of the little critters in there to do the job? I've
heard both versions. 
Help! I want this to turn out right!


Thanks for the help,

I rigged up a simple temperature control for an unheated closet.  The
same might work for your attic.


It requires a transformer, a low-voltage fan, and a thermostat.  I had
the thermostat lying around, since I replaced the house thermostat a
while back.  I used a "power adapter" for a defunct battery-operated
device as the transformer.  The fan was a surplus "muffin fan," such
as are used to ventilate PCs, from a friend who had a pile of them.
Assuming that the "natural temperature" of the space is cooler than
you want, you hook up the transformer, thermostat, and fan in series
so that the fan will turn on when the temperature gets too cold.  A
cheesy diagram may make this more clear:




          wires connected           thermostat               fan
wall      to low-voltage plug         ---           +------+
plug    +-+    +---------------------(   )----------+      |
==)-----| |---<                                     ---           |      |
        +-+    +------------------------------------+           |
       xformer                                            +------+


You can either remove the low voltage "plug" from the power adapter,
and just splice new wires onto the existing wires from the adapter, or
you can try attaching the wires to the "plug" if you want the adapter
to be still usable for its original purpose.


The fan is mounted in the doorway, and the door is opened a bit.  When
the temperature in the closet gets too low, the fan turns on and blows
warm air from the rest of the house into the closet (or,
alternatively, blows cold air out of the closet.)


This works best with a thermostat with a bimetal coil and mercury
switch, because you can tilt the thermostat to make it work at the
lower temperature range that you will want for lagering.  An auxiliary
thermometer makes calibrating it easier.

From: William Frazier <billfrazier`at`worldnet.att.net>
Subject: Calcium Chloride


Recently I have been trying to rid my Redhawk ESB recipe of an
unpleasant bitter quality.  I believe it can be traced to high
sulfate (152 ppm) in my Johnson County, KS water.  My approach
is simple enough...dilute with distilled water.  For my next
brew I plan to dilute 1:3 to lower sulfate to 38 ppm.  
Unfortunately this will also lower the calcium to 25 ppm. While
this might be OK it is not optimal.  I found some calcium
chloride in a local homebrew shop and this is where the 
confusion begins.


The label reads "calcium chloride, one tsp in 5 gallons
increases Ca 95 ppm and Cl 84 ppm".


Since calcium chloride exists as CaCl2 these labeled amounts                        
can't be accurate.  The first problem is with ratio of Ca and                        Cl.  The
second problem is that the label doesn't indicate                         
whether the chemical is anhydrous, dihydrate or another of the                        
possible forms of calcium chloride (NOTE: The shop owner                        
called the supplier and said it was anhydrous).                                


The problem may have started with information contained in                        
The New Complete Joy of Home Brewing.  This was my first                        
brewing book purchased over ten years ago.  Charlie Papazian                        
states that one tsp calcium chloride flakes (CaCl2) in                                 
5 gallons will increase (approximately) concentration of;                                


        Calcium        (Ca++) ion 95 ppm                
        Chloride        [2(Cl)--] ion 84 ppm                
                                
If the tsp did provide 95 ppm calcium it would have to                 
provide about 168 ppm chloride.  The way the chloride                
content is stated is very confusing.                


I referred to a couple of newer homebrew texts...                


New Brewing Lager Beer by Gregory Noonan                
One gram per gallon anhydrous calcium chloride gives;                


        Calcium        161.4 ppm
        Chloride (ie. as Cl2)        168.8 ppm
                
Homebrewing Volume 1 by Al Korzonas                
One gram per gallon anhydrous calcium chloride gives;                


        Calcium (Ca+2)        95.41 ppm
        Chloride (Cl-)        168.79 ppm                


To end this long boring discussion, Al Korzonas' figures                         
are correct.  The others are either misleading or wrong.                        
It's basic chemistry and arithmetic.  If you are trying to                        
get your water chemistry right don't believe everything                                
you read on a label.

You might want to check with your local Police Department.  They
often confiscate very nice triple beam balance scales while
conducting drug raids.  Most localities have Police auctions once
or twice a year.  I only learned of this AFTER buying one from the
www.scaleman.com site.  I'm not unhappy with the one I bought,
though.  It was very nice.

Subject: Strike procedure


Greetings, all!


My question is about the initial mix of hot water & grain in
the mash tun. I mash in a converted sanke keg by adding the
strike water, heating it to strike temp, then pouring in the
grain while stirring. I usually hit my mash temp within a
degree , and don't seem to have any real problem with my
brews.


However, a fellow brewer asked me if I might be denaturing
some of the the beta amylase enzymes when the grain first
hits the 164F+ water and maybe don't get as many
fermentables as a result. I do occasionally have a batch
that finishes with a higher than expected gravity, and maybe
this is a contributing factor.


Does anyone have any thoughts or comments on this?


Hoppy brew year to you all!

The best fermenters I've found in the 1 gallon range are jug wine
bottles.  Three and 4 liter ones are pretty readily available, even
filled with wine that you can stand to drink.   I've used them for beer
and also splitting 5 gallon mead batches down into small trials with
various herbs, spices, and fruits.

Subject: Brew Classic European Beers at Home


After lurking for a week or so it's time to send my first post to the
digest.  I'm just tasteing the first bottles of a batch of stout I made
from the "Brew Classic European Beers at Home" Wheeler and
Protz,Guinness Export Stout p.108 recipes (grain) and I'm dissapointed. 
I don't think I made a mistake I think this is a lack luster recipe. 
There is no complexity or depth drinkable but not exciting.  It dosen't
have rough edges. I doubt it will improve much with ageing. My point is
that American homebrewed and microbrewed beer set the standard world
wide for beer quality. With the exception of certian Belgian sour types
which require 3 or 4 years ageing.  Which to my knoweledge no one is
making here. In fact all of the UK brews I try lately lack complexity,
depth and interest compared to anything made by Bell's. What say you to
that?  Have you tried a recipe from this book? I'm doubly dissapointed
because I have a batch of Hoegaarden Wit p.160 ageing in the secondary.


I would also like to ask if anyone has used Papazian's "Home Brewer's
Gold" recipes? These recipes look interesting but I've not used any of
his recipes.

Greetings:


I was also the recipient of an Automatic malt mill for
Christmas. Unfortunately, I packed it up and sent it back to Williams
Brewing the very next day: it was not able to mill Hugh Baird 140L
crystal at any setting. The second roller (the one that is supposed to
operate on the friction from grain caught between it and the powered
roller) continued to get jammed. When the "free wheeling" roller
doesn't turn, the grain doesn't get milled.


I called Williams Brewing and accepted their offer to try a
replacement mill, but I'm afraid that there is a design flaw in the
mill that prevents it from being able to handle the larger, harder
grains (like Hugh Baird 140L crystal). We'll see when I get the
replacement.

Paul you are ignoring the basis of all of the thories of central tendency
and basic statictics.  The fact that you HAVE only one point should tell you
something.  There are other points, they just didn't make it on the chart.
Either no one else documents the fact that a fly invaded their starter out
of embarrassment  or  they are out of range, they stink, they taste funny,
they ended up in down the sink, etc. due to  high acetic acid, wild yeasts,
and/or other bacterial infections.   It is just not wise to introduce
unknowns to your beer  in such a way.  Now if a fly gets in your wort.  You
can't do much about that and you may as well take a chance.   In the
starter, I still feel uneasy.


Maybe we should start a study project.  Everyone who finds a fly in the
starter and tosses it anyway can log in and evaluate the beer.  Do you want
to keep the list and log the points in.

Dave, I wonder how you justify this when fermenting so much over
so many years.  I can understand that it makes the  process easier
but remember yeasts are airborne.  You may even get a superior
product.  Here's why.   You are probably spending
around 5 bucks a pouch for the purity of a
liquid yeast only to have it compromised by the yeast soup you have
floating around in your home brewery.   Do you ever note little clumps
of ale yeast floating on the top of your lagers?   Remember that most
great French bread bakeries NEVER add yeast, they rely totally on
the yeast soup floating in the bakery.  This may
be  a small portion of your total toss but it does count. Each beer
You make has a bit of the Dave Burley yeast flora in it.  You
also take the chance of introducing airborne bacteria.  If you have
never had a putrid yellow puss pack floating on your beer,
you are lucky.   Pasteur
learned this and used it as the basis for his studies on sterile
process.  (Don't ask me for the French name of the study, I don't
speak French).


In your case, you may have excellent results because you have an
excellent soup of airborne yeasts.  I HAVE to use carboys because
I  make wine each fall and montrachet and other wine yeasts
make really  funky beer.  For newbies who are just starting, wild
yeasts  would make up the majority of their airborne yeasts.
This could also have desirable or undesirable results, most likely
undesirable due to bacterial concerns.  Here's
a test for you,  take a small container of cooled wort out of your
next batch, say  a quart with an airspace, don't add yeast,  set it
in your brewery area for several hours uncovered  then cover it,
preferably with a lock as you normally would.


Betcha' it ferments out to a decent tasting beer with a lot less
acids and undesireables than you would think.

This news appeared this summer in a UK site and mailing list, and also

the news should be still in the main page.
Samichlaus used to be brewed on 6 Dec every year to be released on the

(and quite surely also in Dec 98) and despite all the complaints and

The last Sami you can find is the 1997 (still available in some shops)

We were talking about it in the italian beer newsgroup... besides the

Subject: too much head stability


After 2 years and 45 batches of extract based brews, I made the
transition to all-grain this past summer.  I am enjoying the fruits of
that labor-intensive experience now and have a question about the
product.


There has been much discussion recently about mash schedules and the
effect on clarity and head retention/foam stability.  


The problem I am having with my first all-grain is that it has TOO
MUCH foam stability.  When I pour a glass (from bottle or party pig),
I get half a glass of this rocky dense head that does not receed.  In
fact when the beer is gone, there is usually still about 1/4 glass of
head left.  My glassware is clean, and I have tried pre-wetting the
glass with cool tap water to no avail.  The beer is not
overcarbonated, if anything slightly under.  Perhaps someone more
knowledgeable than myself could review the following procedure and
tell me what is causing this.


Ingredents:
- --9 lbs Schrier American 2 row
- --1 lb Breiss 60L crystal
- --0.75 lb DWC Munich
- --0.5 lb Cara-pils
- --2 ozs Nugget 12.3 AAU 60 mins
- --1 oz Nugget 12.3 AAU FWH
- --1 oz Homegrown Saaz FWH
- --1 oz Homehrown Saaz 20 mins
- --1 oz Kent Golding Hop tea to secondary
- --Wyeast 2112 from starter


Procedure:
Mash 90 mins at 156 
sparge with 175


O.G.:  1.065
F.G.:  1.010
ferment at 50 degrees for 2 weeks
secondary at 40 degrees for 2 weeks


So what do you think?  The mash schedule was pretty non-involved, I
just combined water heated to 170ish with the malt in my pre-heated
gott, stirred and let it sit, checking the temp periodically.  The
initial temp was about 159 and crept down to 156 during the 90 min
mash.  Does FWHing with a high alpha acid hop lend to foam stability?


Any advice/insight would be appreciated.


Cheers

I'm a Carona owner (say *that* a few times fast... :-) and 
I am quite satisfied with my extraction rates.  I Found the best 
(subjective term of course...) overall spacing and locked it in 
tight.  I am in full agreement with Jack on this aspect of roller 
or plate spacing; it isn't worth the hassle to tweak it everytime.  
I can screw up a batch in so many others ways! <grin>


However,  what Jack writes  made me wonder about something related 
to this topic:


The biggest reason roller mills are so attractive is because of the
type of crush they give; which then translates into smoother 
lautering and run off procedures.  However, as Jack points out above 
the best  extraction would happen if the malt was pulverized into 
powder. 


Does this mean if I took my grain, turned it into powder and mixed
it with a bunch-o-rice hulls in my tun I'd get the best extraction,
provided the hulls performed as an adequate filter bed as the grain
husks normally do?  Would there be too much tanin extraction?

Subject: Danger from too much dissolved O2 in wort?


Greetings,


I started oxygenating with pure O2 several months ago, mainly to
shorten my brewing hours and also to insure that adequate levels of
dissolved O2 are provided.  I've become somewhat concerned that I
have little control over DO levels since it's not something that I
can measure.  From what I've read for normal gravity worts, there's
little advantage to be gained by introducing any more DO than about
25% of the saturation amount.  BTW, what is the saturation amount? 
Some say 8ppm, others say it can go as high as 30ppm if pure O2 is
used.  I've also seen a recommendation to saturate the wort.  My
question is, can too much DO be detrimental.  Or, is it the case that
all the DO in a saturated wort will be rapidly metabolized before it
can do any harm.  Has anyone looked at what kinds of reactions occur
between DO and wort compounds before the O2 is metabolized?  Are
there sufficient products from these reactions to cause flavor/aroma
defects?  Is it possible to get so much DO in the wort that it
poisons the yeast?


Thanks.

Subject: fruit flies in my science


The ongoing debate concerning the net effects of fruit flies in yeast
starters raises once again the weak science that is routinely tossed
around here.


Paul notes:
But, so far we only have one real data point versus a lot of
speculation. 
The problem lies not only with the paucity of data points, but in there
very nature.  In this instance we have a dependent variable apparently
being something as vague and difficult to quantify as "beer quality".  I
have been judging beers in formal settings since 1986 and am quite
active in it still.  The "fact" that the beer scored 3rd in a homebrew
comp means nothing about its "quality" other than two beers were judged
"better".  A more insidious problem with using these types of "data" is
that they are entirely uncontrolled for.  They represent empirical
"studies"' as opposed to structured experiments.  Tons of ancillary
factors contribute to beer quality.


As an example, a manipulative  experiment looking at the  fruit fly
factor in contamination would test it across exposures (no flies
 -control, one fly, two fly, threee flies, more), across worts, across
breweries, and across time. Multiple replications for each of these
factors (or a time series with subsampling to account for time) would be
required to develop inference regarding the relative import of a bug in
your starter.  This is what science does -- decreases uncertainty.  The
experiemental design can increase its potential inference by having very
high levels of significance and high levels of power (ability to detect
change from null).  Secondly, it would always be good to use a
quantitative measure as the dependent variable (cell counts make sense)
in conjunction with structured blind taste evaluations by trained beer
sensory people.  Sounds daunting, eh? This is why even the most esteemed
brewing jounals highlighting the best experimental research on brewing
still come up with speculative results.  At its very core, science can
only get inference.  Despite many (scientists even) talking about
"proof", they are actually talking about statistical tests that they
have deemed "significant".


So what are we to do?   There is already very strong experimetal
evidence that common fruit flies harbor bacteria on their surface.
There is also strong evidence that most beer (and virtually all
homebrew)  has at least background levels of contamination.  Given that
the starter is nutrient rich media, and that cell growth is an
objective, I tend to think that low levels of bacteria contamination at
the starter phase would be more problematic than later.  This of course
depends on the bugs particular life history and living requirements, but
kinda brings to mind Dirty Harry.


I dont discourage the use of individual data points in trying to
develoip understanding, but I do think that an understanding of a
particular factor should carry with it an understanding of how it was
reached.  Nor do I frown upon the use of exotic adjuncts in beer.  How
do you think I came up with the name of my 1994 barleywind "Old Stogie"
or its 1995 sister "Old Loogee".


Peace, and a fine 99 to you all.

That assumption is on par with assuming that lying down on a highway is

melon (cranium) would be. If I hadn't seen other egregious lapses in
logic in his reply, I would conclude that Mr. Niebergall didn't intend
his response to read this way.  His saying that the judges were schmucks
removes all doubt.  Undesirable yeasts or bacteria are not guaranteed to
propagate from the feet of fruitflies, so there is a chance the judges
sensed rightly.
  As a novice judge and willing audience to diverse points of view, I'm
here to say it's better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. 
In general, it's downright unproductive to get all pissy about data you

You've touched on one of the ongoing and unsettled questions on HBD.  I
don't think anyone has come up with the definitive answer as to why it
takes more than a few days to carbonate, but it does.  Obviously your ale
finished fermenting lots more fermentables much more quickly that that.
Suggested reasons have been low nutrient level in finished beer, low pH,
pooped out yeast, Crabtree efect; I can't remember the rest.  In spite of
Dave Miller asserting that it takes time for the CO2 to go into solution
after it's been produced, this is impossible.  It is produced and
immediately dissolved in situ.  When you cool your ale, you will get less
pressure and less fizzy beer because colder beer can hold more CO2.  This
will happen immediately without any"re-adjustment of the CO2."  You will
also likely get chill haze, but that's a separate issue.


Give it those few extra weeks for full carbonation and the beer will
probably taste better, too.  And don't forget that British style ales are
best with low carbonation and not too cold.

the same experience.  The major German producers' products are excellent.
Briess has also brought out a 2-row Vienna-style called Ashburne, which I

Pilsner malt base, I've been happier with the results - no caramel flavor.


>is Hugh Baird or Maris Otter of comparable quality?


You are comparing apples and oranges here - Hugh Baird is a maltster; Maris
Otter is a older barley variety prized for malting.  Several British
producers produce malt from it, and Baird and other maltsters produce malt
from several varieties.  Halcyon is another variety.  The only bad malt
that I remember being reported here specifically is a Maris Otter that
George Piro found to be substandard (greatly overmodified).  I can't
remember the producer.  Most Maris Otter is fine although apparently very
friable.


I have had good luck with Scotmalt, Paul's, Munton & Fison and Hugh Baird.
Cost isn't much of a consideration for me - all grains are close enough in
price to one another for me to use grains from the country of the style I'm
trying to produce.

Hi all -


I am a five month lurker, first time poster.  I'm hoping somebody can
explain the results of a little experiment I ran.


My understanding is that boiling water will cause calcium to precipitate
with bicarbonate, thereby softening the water.


I tested water with an aquarium water hardness test kit, which consists of
sodium hydroxide and calmagite solution.   EDTA color indicator  is then
added drop by drop (mixing between each drop) until a color change is noted.
My results:


Tap water                                    150 ppm hardness
Boiled 10 min (and cooled)      140 ppm (no obvious precipitate)
Boiled 40 min (and cooled)      240 ppm (granular and thread like  white
precipitates)


The chemical analysis (Lake Huron water) lists the following:
Mg 6.6 - 8.0 ppm, Ca 20 - 27 ppm, total hardness 96-104 ppm, non-carbonate
hardness 21 - 46, and pH 7.2 - 7.6.  These numbers are ranges for an 8 month
period.


Why did boiling trigger a higher hardness result from this test?


TIA - email responses are fine - I'll post summary of results.

Subject: On fruitflies and dogma


I'm going to get a little philosophical here.


A little while ago, not quite satisfied with the dry stouts I had made
in the past, I began to browse the recipes in Cats Meow and other
sources to see if I could find a recipe I liked better.  After a while,
I just started to see how many different recipes claimed to be clones of
Guinness.  I never really tried to count them, and I can't even provide
an estimate, but they are legion.  And they are DIFFERENT.  It's hard to
believe that so many recipes with such different ingredients and
processes can all claim to result in the same thing.


But they do, and I would bet that each one of them produces a dry stout
that would please any reasonable stout lover.


One of the most amazing things about this craft is that so many
different techniques work!  Over thousands of years of brewing, a world
full of brewers has evolved so many ways of improving a vary simple
biological process that we cannot even begin to guess at how many ways
there are to make a good beer.


And it is a simple process.  Let's face it, if we took a can of hopped
extract, mixed it with some water in an open bucket, and left it out for
a while, we would probably end up with beer.  Depending upon the kind of
ambient yeast that chooses to ferment it, we may even want to drink it.


Everything we do beyond that is to increase the probability that we will
like the results.  For example, if we just wash our equipment in a
normal fashion, we will PROBABLY be OK, but since that degree of
probability can be increased significantly by good sanitation technique,
we all sanitize.  But here's a confession: when I was a clumsy beginner,
I frequently did stupid and unsanitary things I'm now embarrassed to
admit.  I had to toss a batch, and I had a couple with off flavors, but
other than that, THE BEERS CAME OUT FINE.


Another example: for a variety of reasons, today I always make a
decent-sized starter for my yeast, but for the first forty batches I
made, I just tossed in Wyeast straight out of the smack pack or used a
dry yeast on occasion.  I never had a problem I could notice.  I had an
occasional lag time approaching 24 hours, but nothing really bad ever
came of it.


As I grow more sophisticated in my technique, I get pickier, and I'm not
sure that's all good.  My friends rave about my last Pilsner, but I
notice the diacetyl and feel disappointed.  My stout-loving friend
thinks the one I just finished is the best he's ever tasted; I know I
mashed it at too high a temperature and taste the slight sweetness and
extra body.  I can't enjoy my own beers the way my friends can.


There's actually a point or two to this rambling:


As we develop our techniques and our palates, we can easily lose sight
of the fact that much of what we do makes improvements only noticeable
to an expert.  More importantly, we lose sight of the fact that what we
have learned to do is not the only way to do it.  Most importantly, it
seems that many of us have developed the attitude that there is
something wrong with others who don't do or feel as we do.


In the past months, many people have made posts which seem to speak with
all the dogmatic authority of the Pope.  All Wyeast yeasts suck!  All
fruit flies harbor diseases that will make beer undrinkable!  (Well, at
least to a REAL beer drinker.)   You can't possibly make beer without at
least a liter of starter!  (There seems to be a competition to see who
uses the most starter; I'm waiting for someone to announce they used a
five gallon starter and noticed too late there was no room left for the
wort.  But it had no lag time, by golly!)


I guess I'm suggesting that we lighten up a tad.  The wonderful thing
about a medium like this is the ability to share the things we do.  When
we try something and it works, sharing it here makes us all richer, but
when we put down others with different ideas, we are all impoverished by
the act.


My son has asked me to introduce him to home brewing in his apartment
this spring.  I will start simple.  I think I'll begin with a simple
English Ale.  I'll use some extract syrup with some crystal that we've
steeped in an old enamel kettle.  We'll pitch a couple of packages of
Nottingham dry yeast.  We'll ferment it in an old plastic fermenter I
have left from a bygone era.  No dry hopping.  If a fruit fly comes by,
we'll take it out and hope for the best.


I bet it will taste just great.


I may suggest he join this list.  Maybe not.  I hope nobody here tells
him he's a piece of scum because he's using all the wrong equipment.

Subject: Steam purity and how delicate are enzymes, really?


Hi all,


Micah Millspaw (MicahM1269`at`aol.com) commented in Homebrew Digest #2915 
that he felt that using steam in a heat exchanger would eliminate:  


>the risk of wort damage from the steam, which is not very pure from
>a home pressure cooker, I'm certain.


Since I sometimes fail to see the obvious, I must ask why one would think 
that steam from a home pressure cooker would not be as pure, or more pure, 
than the water used in one's mash. Wouldn't they be from the same source?
 
Wouldn't the steam actually be more pure, since the condensate would 
essentially be distilled water? 


Let me throw out one question that has been bothering me with respect to
steam injection in a rims. Recently someone (Steve Alexander?) questioned
whether beating up the wort could have a bad effect on enzymes...my words 
not the authors who stated things much better :-)


Anyway, steam condenses real fast in cold water, and I am pretty sure fairly 
fast at mashing temperatures as well. Steam bubbles changing to liquid 
water, within a pot of water, make a pretty good popping sound. There must
be a 
significant shock at the point where the popping sound is generated.


How delicate are these enzymes that we depend on anyway? should I put my beer
glass down and start to worry as I continue to put together my steam injected
rims?


Welcome to 1999!
