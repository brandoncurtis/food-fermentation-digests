Subject: Purity of Dry v's Liquid Yeasts


Matt Comstock posts an interesting discussion with Lallemand
concerning dry yeast in HBD #2929.


He was told ...
"The standard for the presents of wild yeast by my company is less
than
1 wild yeast per 2,000,000 beer yeast cells or less than 0.000005 %.
That is not perfect but mighty close to it. "


And further asked ...
"Do you have any idea for those of liquid yeast manufacturers?  Is
there a bacteria standard as well, or is that simply: none."


I would not have a clue, but I did remember reading some specs of a
leading liquid yeast producer on the web.  I won't give any names but
you can find the details at http://www.wyeastlab.com <Grin>


The Purity Standards are listed as: 
        Wild Yeast and Mold ; Negative in 10 ml suspension
        Bacteria ; < 1 cfu / ml
        Yeast Mutants; None detected


So there it is - all our questions answered. Now if we only knew what
'< 1cfu / ml' meant ... anyone got any ideas.

I would like to thank the collective publicly for all the help and advice I
have received any time that  I have asked a question, or posed a problem. I
recently asked which would work better for my system, a false bottom or copper
manifold. I got tons of helpful info. I used the manifold for the first time
this weekend and it worked great! My false bottom got retired to my brew
kettle to filter out hops and trub, again worked great!!!!!!. I also asked
about my converted kegs and the problems with moving liquids and keeping temps
in line. Again, you guys have come thru and gave excellent advice. Thanks to
all who has helped this brewer go from extract to all grain, and love every
minute(well, almost every minute) of it.

I am thinking about purchasing a aeration system. I see advertised the oxygen

I guess that there are all different brands, so any advice would be

Subject: Sankeys/2inch TC, worrying too much, decocs, yeast build up/10%sucrose


I was looking at the sanke fitting on kegs.
Took out the spear assy and I had a 2inch
triclamp fitting sitting there. Almost
a good match with the proper dremel tool
action. All one would need it a good gasket,
the 2 inch to x inch reducing fitiing and
a nice butterfly valve. A relatively cheap
way to obtain a "cylindroconical" tank using
a 5 gallon "corny style keg" with the sanke tap.
Some food for thought, anyone done this?  


>From past thread....amoungst others
>Paul continues with questions about mash schedules, in
>particular, about decoctions and protein rests.  He asked
>a local brewer about the subject of p-rests and was evidently

I think we do..worry too much. Why do you think the commercial
brewers (some, not all) - think we are "crazy homebrewers".
C.P. had it canned years ago relax, be happy, have a homebrew
(maybe it should be: have a homebrew, relax, be happy..repeat.)




Decoc(and RIMS/HERMS) must be done carefully, if you are using
pumps, they must be airtight as is all fittings and hoses.
Air pick is not wanted thru-out the mash schedule.
Your equipment will dictate if it is a thin or thick decoc.
I typically transfer thin decocs to mash out and pump both ways.
This has worked very well for my equipment.




In an adder to G.Depiro on yeasts...
>Are you building yeast or making beer


When starting the yeast, timing is key.  You dont want
the inter build up stages to be too far apart. Keep this
down to a minimum (days is best).  This will take practice.


As the doublings get close to the pitching volume - you
treat the starter like beer and less like a starter (aeration
agitation and elevated temps).  Decant early stages.  And have
wort similar to the brews wort for later stages. 


As for yeast build up from under sucrose -  status is


One of my strains, I call Lambada - is it fully back
from many years under 10% sucrose. Inital fermentation
tests are still ongoing but flavor wise - it is what 
I remember. Looks healthy. Really glad this one came back...


One has not come back - yet - I call it CARBO.
another I call VIT is plating out ok - no fermentation results
Dekoninck is very strange - plate growth is slow.
Le Cheval shows similar to DeK.
Several plates of others (sevaral WY, HairofDog) are 
still "in the oven".




Good Luck and Great Brewing

HBD-
I pulled myself out of bed at 8:30 Saturday morning.  Wandered downstairs
and saw my brew partner Jason stuck in my driveway.  Several judiciously
removed shovels full of snow and some brute force later, we got him free.
Into the garage to start the brew day:  23 pounds of pale ale malt, 3
pounds of crystal, and a half pound of chocolate crushed the night before.
As a last minute consideration, we added a pound of carapils to the grist
bill for our first joint brew session, a brown ale.
We perched a half barrel converted keg onto a pipe nipple stand atop my
table saw, and used a hose to fill it from the hot water tap in the kitchen.
Then I
inserted a 1500 watt immersion chiller, and plugged it into my freshly
fabricated relay switch assembly that was hooked to the high temp alarm on
my fermentation chiller controller, doing double duty today.  Flipped the
switch and...blew the circuit.  Couldn't find the right breaker for that
circuit, so we ran a power cord from the kitchen.  And tripped the GFCI.
"It CAN'T be my relay wiring!...I think."  Back tracking through the
components, it turned out to be the multi outlet surge protector we were
using for the power strip.  A new power
strip later, and we got power to every thing that's supposed to have power
(and no power to things that shouldn't).
As we start heating up the mash water on our tardy third brew partners new
dual station King Cooker (100K burner and a 30K burner) we remark at how
fast our immersion heater is heating the sparge water from 130F (from the
tap) to 170F.  Todd shows up.  Since he's an EE, we turn our attention to
the now defunct outlet, which I have partially dissected, and is hanging by
the wires.  After he notices that I was checking the circuit with the
multimeter set on DC voltage (hey, I'm not really an engineer, I just play
one at work), we still determine the circuit to be dead.  None of the
breakers have been tripped.  Jason wondered aloud if perhaps it was on a
different GFCI than the one in the kitchen?  No, I'm sure it's not.
Instead, I flip every breaker in the box, just in case one of the breakers
was tripped, but not looking like it.  No good.  Now I have to reset all
the clocks in the house.
Mash water is ready.  We fill Jasons 48 qt. cooler with 40 qts of water at
170.  I decide that was a little too much, so I scooped out 3 qts. and
added it to the sparge HLT.  It was up too high to see into, but I knew
where the middle of the keg was, so I reached up there, and started
pouring.  The water started pouring down the sides of the keg, so I
figured I was off a bit.  I moved the pouring vessel around as I poured
the rest out, but it all just cascaded down about the sides of the HLT.
After I was done pouring, I climbed up the ladder standing next to me and
took a good look.  A lid was over the top of the keg!  DOH!
OK, we mashed in the 27.5#'s of grain, and had about 1/2" of freeboard.
Just about right.  We hit 154F.  Just about right.
While the mash steeped, we turned our attention to the lifeless outlet.  As
we stood scratching our heads, I thought- "Hey- they couldn't have wired a
whole house, and put three bathrooms, the kitchen and the garage all on one
GFCI!"  I went into the first floor bathroom, and there it was- a GFCI that
had been tripped.  I pushed the reset, and Jason and Todd started yelling
"We got power! We got power!"  I ran to the garage, elated!  My elation was
short lived, though, as when I got there, I grabbed the multimeter clip on
the hot lead to disconnect it.  My eyes lit up, I did a little dance,
looked at Todd wide eyed and said "I GOT IT!!  I GOT IT!!".
I have no idea what that means.
No big deal.  I took some 480 in college and it didn't affect me a bit
(sic!)
In between Jasons "I told you so" 's, and Todd's "You dumb ass!" 's, we got
good conversion.  We were still impressed at how quickly my immersion
chiller got the HLT up to temp.  Then we stirred it.  The temp dropped 30
degrees.  After a quick boil up and addition of 4 gallons of water, we were
at sparge temps.
We collected the first 4 gallons of spargant (after recirculating a gallon
or so) in a 5 gallon pot, and set it to boiling on the 30K burner.  Then we
collected another 13 gallons in another converted keg, and started boiling
it on the 100K burner.  Another 4 gallons of "last runnings" at 1.015 was
collected in another 5 gallon pot.  (the last runnings I boiled down to 2
gallons of starter, and botulo-canned it for later use.)
We boiled it all down to fit in the keg, added 2oz homegrown Northern
Brewer for bittering, and 2 oz of homegrown Cascade for flavoring.  We each
got 5 gallons of "Unblinking Brown Ale" at 1.050.
To my fermenter, I added about 1/2 pound of ground hazel nuts I've had
soaking in the fridge in vodka for a few months.  Jason and Todd went
straight up.  We pitched the Widmer yeast I harvested from my primary
fermenter containing a wheat stout.  I originally got the yeast from a bottle
of Widmer Hopjack this
last New Years.
4 hours later, our airlocks were happily chugging away.
Interspersed throughout the brew day were snow shoveling sessions, using a
hair dryer to dry out the distributor cap on my wifes Aerostar so it would
start, photo ops, unkinking Todd's immersion chiller hoses, and rigging up
a two stage immersion chiller with Todd's chiller buried in a converted keg
full of snow and water, hooked to my immersion chiller in the brew keg.
And of course, the electrical work (sic!, sic!)!
Not a bad day for our first of many joint brew sessions, and Todd and
Jason's first all grain brew.
I worked it out on paper to hit 15 gallons at 1.045.  With an extra pound
of Carapils, we got 1.050.

For a home brew RIMS, why can't you use the HLT for the brew pot.  One less
pot, one less burner, less fabrication.  In an RIMS where the mash is heated
by a recirc coil in the HLT you could make a complete system with a single
burner.  The only real problem that I see is the cleaning measures required.
If the coil were removable that would be minimal.

Rod, no reason why it couldn't be done. However, many brewers using multi
vessel systems do so for the time savings, they offer; heating sparge while
you're mashing, raising boiler temperature while you're still sparging.
These steps alone save an hour or more depending mash & boil schedule.


Removing the coil might be a problem, depending on how you mounted it. To
work efficiently it can't just drop in.

malts, and #1968 delivered. As I recall, I roused the yeast once after the
fermentation had slowed down.


This yeast finished very quickly. I used oxygen for the first time with this
batch, so that had something to do with it.

sweet.

Subject: Purity of Dry v's Liquid Yeasts


Matt Comstock posts an interesting discussion with Lallemand
concerning dry yeast in HBD #2929.


He was told ...
"The standard for the presents of wild yeast by my company is less
than
1 wild yeast per 2,000,000 beer yeast cells or less than 0.000005 %.
That is not perfect but mighty close to it. "


And further asked ...
"Do you have any idea for those of liquid yeast manufacturers?  Is
there a bacteria standard as well, or is that simply: none."


I would not have a clue, but I did remember reading some specs of a
leading liquid yeast producer on the web.  I won't give any names but
you can find the details at http://www.wyeastlab.com <Grin>


The Purity Standards are listed as: 
        Wild Yeast and Mold ; Negative in 10 ml suspension
        Bacteria ; < 1 cfu / ml
        Yeast Mutants; None detected


So there it is - all our questions answered. Now if we only knew what
'< 1cfu / ml' meant ... anyone got any ideas.

The best way that I have found requires access to a decent-sized air
compressor (usually more common 'round the 'hood than a plasma cutter.)
Get yourself an air-driven muffler cut-off tool (basically, a small
abrasive saw) for $15-20, two or three replacement abrasive discs per keg,
a worm-gear hose clamp large enough for the body of the air tool, and a
wire coat hanger.


Cut a piece of coat hanger long enough to loop around the Sankey valve in
the center of the keg, and secure the ends of the loop to the cut-off tool
with the hose clamp.  Adjust the swing of the cutter to the desired
diameter of the opening (be careful that the disc doesn't contact the rim
of the keg -- a 12inch opening is usually OK, and matching lids are
available at Target for $10) and tighten the clamp (gently!, if your tool
has a plastic body).  You may have to remove (GASP!) the clear plastic
safety-shield to get the right radius -- put it BACK on when you're done).


Wearing safety glasses (MINIMALLY), or preferably, a full face shield, AND
hearing protection, begin a very shallow cut while swinging the tool around
the Sankey valve.  Be careful NOT to tangle your feet in the air hose!
Continue to cut deeper and deeper in repeated passes.  As you begin to
break through the top of the keg leave a "spider" of metal to support the
keg top until you're ready for the final pass.  Assuming you're not
standing next to the compressor you can use water to cool the cut as you go
(stainless gets harder as it heats up).  Change the cutting disc as
necessary.


After the top is cut out, remove the SHARP burr around the opening with a
die grinder, or a hand-held stone.  Check your progress with a wad of paper
towel, NOT your finger! If you do use your finger, be sure to have some
salt handy to make the memory *really* vivid!


This method is relatively fast, doesn't require exotic equipment (an air
compressor is WAY useful around the house <snort>!) and leaves a MUCH
better finish than I've ever seen done by an amateur with either a Sawzall
or a torch.




Standard disclaimer:  If you maim yourself, or by-standers, by following
these instructions to the letter, don't EVEN be thinking of getting a
lawyer to sue me!  Act like a thinking person.

Subject: Humble questions


Hello all,
        I have been quietly reading the digest for some time and while I am
facinated with the advanced brewing techniques I am still getting the
basics down. You have to learn to crawl...I was hopping (grin) that some
kind soul could answer a few basic questions that have been plaguing me in
my malt extract brewing procedures.They may seem obvious to most of you but
again with the crawling and walking thing. Also perhaps someone could
reccommend a more basic mailing list suited for beginner's like me.
        1. I have been losing a great deal of my wort during the boil (at
least a gallon). My last batch, I used three gallons of water to 6 lbs of
light malt. I steeped 1 lb of crystal malt to the boiling point, removed,
added my malt, and hops and boiled for 60 min I don't have a large boiler
and i have a boil over problem when I cover the pot. When I reduce my heat,
I don't get a rolling boil. Is good or bad? Should I let the wort reduce to
make it more concentrated or am I just evaporating all the yummy goodness
into the air?
        2. I have been using grain bags during the boil to avoid sparging.
I thought this was a good idea for looseleaf hops as well. However, I
noticed a lot of sediment in my carboy this go around. Should I use a
strainer to gather up the looseleaf hops? Note: I brew solo so I am not
sure how to practically accomplish this.
        3. Lager yeast. I am attempting a steamesque beer and I purchased a
wyeast smak-pak of california lager yeast from my local brewer. He advised
me that I didn't really need to wait for the incubation period to commence,
i.e. the packet to swell, and that I could just pitch and go. I smacked the
pack about 48 hours before I brewed and pitched at 66 degrees, the packet
had not swelled at all. I  am still expectanlty waiting for signs of life.
It has been a full 24-hrs and then some. Should I aerate some more, pitch
more yeast, or just settle down and be patient?
        Thanks in advance. Feel free to send me private e-mails so as not
to bother advanced digest readers.

Dan Listerman asks if there's a scientific term for the collapse of foams.


I know a fair amount about the physical chemistry of foams and I am not
aware of a single special term used for this phenomenon.  Researchers in
the area tend to talk about the inverse effect - foam stability.  For
disappearance of foams, I've seen papers using the phrases "foam collapse",
"foam decay", "foam breaking", "foam destabilization" and "foam rupture".
If you refer to the process as  "collapse", you'll be understood and as
scientific as anything I've seen.


An excellent review of foam chemistry that I often refer back to when
thinking about foams and foam collapse is:

Colloid and Interface Science, v64, pp 67-142 (1996).

I don't believe the article is correct regarding this association.
I was one of the people who researched this phenomenon and can vouch
for the fact that too little headspace does indeed decrease carbonation.


The reason I don't think it is correct is quite simply because oxygen
is not required for fermentation.  A year or two ago, another HBD'er
(sorry, buried deep in my disk somewhere) and I discussed the thought that
perhaps it was due to the fact that during respiration (yes, indeed,
respiration) more CO2 is produced than during fermentation.  However, we
did some quick calculations and determined that the priming sugar was
enough to induce the Crabtree Effect (also called reverse catabolism, I
believe) which *suppresses* respiration and causes 90+% of the oxygen
to be used for cellular activity other than respiration.  Therefore,
for all intents and purposes, brewers yeast *don't respire*.


Actually, it would not be difficult to test the article's assertion...
three bottles:


1. filled normally,
2. high fill - taking care to introduce little or no oxygen, and
3. high fill - aerate the heck out of the beer.


My gut feeling says there is some *other* factor (not oxygen in
the headspace) that causes this phenomenon.

Subject: Yeast Starters/Good Head


As a service to my fellow HBD'ers, I'd like to finish out the starter
thread that I'd started a couple of days ago. Much thanks is necessary to
Ted Mc Irvine, Nathan Kanous, George De Piro, Scott Murman, and Jack
Horzempa for their quick responses to my query.


        In summary, one should always use starters when using liquid (Wyeast)
yeast. The popular "smack packs" only contain about 50 mL of yeast when
fresh, which the directions on the pack say should be stepped up to at
least 12 oz of wort prior to pitching. I'd screwed up by pitching a smack
pack to 1/2 gal (roughly 2000 mL) of wort, or about 4X as much as I should
have.
        In the future, my procedure will be as follows:
1. "Smack" the pack.
2. Wait 12-24 hours until pack is firm, ~1 inch thick.
3. Pitch smack pack to 12 oz of wort (~1/2 cup DME)
4. Wait 24-48 hours until fermentation is complete.
5. Repitch 12 oz starter to 1/2 gal of wort.
6. Wait 24-48 hours until 1/2 gal starter is at high kareusen.
7. Brew.
8. Pitch the whole damn starter to the beer.
        Also as a follow up, the starter kicked off about 48 hours after I'd
pitched the smack pack to the 1/2 gal of wort, and was the prettiest white
head that I'd ever seen. Smelled fine, no floaties. Pitched it to my new
bitter this afternoon.
        As a future item for discussion, I like head! In an effort at aiding head
production, I make my starters from half light DME, and the other half
wheat DME. When I prime the beer, I do it using 1 1/4 cup of wheat DME. Am
I helping, hurting, or barking at the moon?

Mark Swenson asked in HBD #2929 about Wyeast 1968 and whether rousing was
necessary due to its flocculent nature.


I have used 1968 more than any other yeast and while it is highly flocculent
I find that if aerated well it doesn't need rousing.  When I first started
using it I sometimes had attenuation problems but traced it (thanks to HBD)
to inadequate aeration.  Since I have been aerating adequately I have had no
problems.  I think adequate aeration is preferable to rousing in any case.
I use O2 now but had good results before by pouring the wort between sanitized
buckets to aerate.  By the way, I think good aeration is a good idea with any
yeast.  It just seems to be a bit more critical with 1968.  Good yeast,
though.

Hi, Mark.  Great choice of yeast.  This is one of my favorites, and is very
good in bitters.  I would like to burst your Momily, though.  I have also
heard this same comment about 1968, and it seems to get repeated very often.
In my experience, I have never had any difficulty in getting it to ferment
out.  I've used it many times, and I would say that with adequate pitching
rate and aeration, you should have no problems.  Good luck.

My last three brew sessions, I've been using a little widget my wife got

Oh man, do you guys bring back memories!  That FAQ that I wrote slightly 
embarrasses me now.  I've learn SO much more about yeast since then, and 
believe that I now understand much more about what is happening as a 
newly started sourdough starter goes through it's birthpains on the way 
to a good robust starter.  BUT, even though I've promised now for years, 
I've never rewritten the FAQ!  The info in the FAQ was based on 
empirical experience and observations.  I've started many starters from 
scratch and always felt disappointed when others gave up, or 'cheated' 
by adding commercial yeast to their bread recipes, so I wrote the FAQ.  
Oh well, thanks for the trip down memory lane ... I really will re-write 
the FAQ one of these days.


And Jeff, I always wondered if you were the same guy as the one in 
rec.food.sourdough or not.  Remember "Sourdough Dave" Adams?  Whatever 
happened to him.  Last I heard, he was working at Cray Computers (or 
Cray Research), and then he disappeared ... figured he retired or 
something, but you'd of thought that he'd stay in contact, eh?

PS: Sorry for being off topic.  But just so's this is a beer brewing 
post, remember to never feed your sourdough within a few days to a week 
of brewing unless you want Lacto Bacillus in your beer.  Ask my brother 
about the very first beer he brewed ... on the day he was feeding his 
sourdough starter.  Mmmmmm, sour beer!  For those p-lambic brewers in 
the crowd, consider feeding your starter on the same day you brew, and 
fan the gas off the starter into your fermenter! <g>

Subject: Diacetyl Rest info needed


Hi there,
I'm planning on brewing a Pale Lager in the Pils / Export style in the
few weeks and I would like to do a diacetyl rest but am not sure of the
exact time to do the rest.  Miller's Homebrewing guide recommends
starting the rest when the wort is 2/3ds of the way through it's
fermentation.  This much I understand, but do I conduct the rest in my
primary fermenter and transfer after the rest, or should I transfer at
the end of primary, into secondary and then do the diacetyl rest in the
secondary?  Any info would be greatly appreciated.

I brewed a batch of Stout on 1/1/99 O.G. 1.047 and transferred it a

1.010.  It's been tucked away in seconday ever since, but I've

not have any coffee extract or flavoring to add except what I can brew
in my own coffee maker.  Any advice on how to incorporate coffee flavor
into this batch?  Should I put it in in the secondary or just prior to
bottling?  How mych coffee would be a safe jumping off point for a five

Minor point of correction, and a fun trick: Hydrogen does impart quit a 
good flash of flame when it goes off.  When I was a kid, I used to make 
hydrogen by putting lye (sodium hydroxide) and water in the big glass 
coke bottles (can't buy them anymore), mixing it well, then dropping 
crinkled sheets of aluminum foil in.  You do this and then snap a 
balloon on the top of the bottle and watch it inflate.  We'd then tie 
the balloons on a string and light them with a match tied to a stick 
(gotta keep your face back ya know!).  Man!  They'd make a big boom!  We 
took pictures at night with the flash too.  I might even still have a 
few (with artistically 'shocked' faces for the camera of course).  It 
was a lot of fun.  But anyway, yes we did get quite a lot of flame and 
light out of the hydrogen.  My junior high chemistry teacher is 
responsible for teaching us this trick ... nice guy!


Brian


PS: Don't try this with the new plastic coke bottles.  The 
lye/water/aluminum mixture is quite exothermic.  The water often reaches 
a full boil, and more than one _glass_ bottle broke while performing 
this experiment.  The new plastic ones would probably melt.  And the lye 
mixture is nasty stuff that you don't want splashing on or around you 
(or in your eyes!)

A cfu is a colony forming unit. When you properly streak out a plate
each bug (bacteria or yeast) will grow and  divide to form a colony.
So a cfu is one viable bacteria or yeast cell.

HBD-

'< 1cfu / ml' meant ... anyone got any ideas.


1cfu / ml means One Colony Forming Unit per Milliliter


Now a question or two of my own-
I'm currently running a natural gas line to the garage. I'll T off the NG stub
behind the oven, and run some black iron pipe through the garage wall.  I'll
put a ball valve shut off in the garage.  My question is the best (safest,
cheapest, easiest) way to run the gas to a 30K burner I scabbed out of an old
water heater?
I got a flexible gas line, like the ones used for appliances, but I have no
way to connect to the 3/8 reverse flare fittings on the burner to the 1/2 pipe
threads, unless I buy an $80 water heater regulator.  New water heaters only
cost $120!
Then I had a thought- Why can't I terminate the ball valve with a hose barb,
and use that tan rubber gas hose like the stuff we used in college chem lab?
We currently have it in our lab here at work, to.  It is made for NG, very
flexible, and I could disconnect it and store it in the basement when not in
use.
Also, since NG is low pressure, low flow, I should be able to get some flame
control from the ball valve shut-off, right?  I mean, for the most part, I'll
want to go full bore anyway, boiling 7-10 gallons at 30K BTU, right?

Subject: Yeast Starters---One Flavor/Odor not mentioned


In HBD #2930 George De Piro gave a great description of various flavors
that could indicate problems.  Well, he left one out.  Diaper pail.  That's
right.  When I stepped up this last batch of yeast, I used some starter
wort I had canned.  The first step up went fine.  When I did the second
step up, I opened a quart of the canned wort and dumped it in the starter
jug.  Shook it and replaced the air lock.  Then I noticed a foul odor in
the air.  Sure enough, I tracked it to the jar I had just poured the
starter from.  Horrible, foul, "diaper pail" is the best description.


Needless to say, I wouldn't risk using it on a full batch.  I let it
ferment down and decided to try a test.  It still smelled like diapers.
When I brewed yesterday, I put about 1/2 Gal. of the batch in the starter
jug (after pouring off the spent "wort").  I'm thinking I will let it
ferment down and maybe even bottle it. 


Any opinions out there on what are the risks in tasting it?

D. Lamotte asks about the definition of cfu, specifically, what cfu/ml
means.


cfu stands for Colony Forming Unit. In saying that there is less than or

expect to see no more than one bacterial colony on average.

Madman Bob Fesmire asks about Oxygenators,


Liquid Bread is the system I have and am basically happy with it. If you
get the chance to shop the things side by side pay atention to the quality
of the regulator. LB's is not of the higest quality. It is quite soft and
has dented upon the chance droping. The threads in the inside are also
becomming stripped after 10+ bottles of use over the last 3 years. In the
past I stored the O2 bottle with the regulator off, but now its too much a
PITA to get the regulator on and off.  Has anyone else had this problem?


I have also found that if you turn it on all the way to create a "rolling
boil" effect in the carboy you are wasteing gas. I used several 1.1 cu ft
tanks with only 3-5 uses, when your supposed to get 15-20. You only have to
crank it up to the point where you can visabily notice it working. You do
this twice for 15 seconds each. Letting the foam settle between blasts.


We should be airating our starters also. But for how long for these tiny
volumes? And is there a better way to sanitize the 316 SS stone they give
us than boiling? Thats time consuming and another trip up and down the
stairs for me. Suggestions??

Distilling topic - Mike Allred asks several questions about liquors and
several answers in a more or less correct vein and then Jeff Renner drove
home the correct detailed description regarding scotch, blends and vatted
whisky's.  One or two points still deserve comment.


Blended scotches shouldn't be ignored (do as I say, not as I do) even though
they include grain alcohol - they can provide remarkable consistent and good
flavor at a reasonable price.  The current issue of the "'Malt Advocate"
http://www.whiskeypages.com , has an interview with Richard Paterson, master
whisky blender for Whyte& Mackay - rather nice job if you can get it.  The
same issue, as already noted on HBD, awards Hopdevil their domestic beer of
the year award. Congrats Jim Busch and the guys at Victory Brewing - tho'
I'm concerned that the attention paid to Hopdevil hides the fact that
Victory makes some of the finest commercial  lager beers in North America.


Philip Wilcox adds.
> B) single malt= 100% the same malt ie. Scot malt
Scotmalt is a tradename for malts from 'Brewing Products Ltd', not a scotch
whisky malt.
> G) there is a book available from ThingsBeer (thingsbeer`at`voyager.net) on

Be sure to get a license from the BATF before you try this - BATF takes no
prisoners.


Jeff Renner adds
>Oddly enough, the distillers are not particularly fussy
>about yeast and typically use dry yeast.
I'm not sure that selecting dry yeast means that distillers are less picky.
I know that one distillers yeast can ferment maltotetraose  to a limited
extent !  Several other selection criteria for whisk[e]y yeast are discussed
in "Yeast Technology" by Gerald Reed et al.  The flavor profile of the yeast
is relatively less important, than in beer since many of the flavor active
compounds are removed in distillation. Attenuation, speed, low fusel levels
are probably much more critical.  Mort could probably add a lot here if he's
still listening.


> Many Bourbon distillers are more fussy and culture their own yeast.
They are more secretive - that is certain.

>and 8-15% malted barley.  It astounds me that as little as 8% malt

And George DePiro adds the M&BS description of distilling malts in the UK.


I have 15% malt + 85% gelatinized grain mashed at 56C with a bump to 62C and
is fermented at 20C-30C(!) as a typical whiskey mash cycle.  The SG of the
mash wort is in the normal range for beer (like ~12.5P) because this yeast
operate most satisfactorily at the SG.  Of course bacterial and wild yeast
infection is rampant since there is no boil.  This matters little since the
'sins' of the ferment are purged in the distillation.  The resulting wort is
distilled by either a continuous or pot still - and the choice has a major
impact on the resulting liquor. Pot distilled whisk[e]y (which is almost
exclusively Scotch)  gets some flavor profile from the wort while continuous
or 'Coffey' distilled liquor gets very little flavor from the wort (except
for the rye contribution) but primarily is flavored by the barrel or other
post distillation additions.


Tim Wauters notes on the rum topic ...
>under the name Sucanat.  It can be used as a substitute for some of those
>difficult to locate (for me at least) British dark brewing sugars.
Brown sugar, molasses, sucanat all have a similar flavor profile.  IMO these
three don't fit in IPAs.  British 'chip sugar' or electropositive caramel is
made with ammonia compounds and sugar syrup and caramelized to various
extents.  The flavor addition reportedly gives a notably dry finish note -
sucanat doesn't.  I'm not aware of a good substitute available to US HBers.

Decoction ...
Jim Bentson writes that LKBonham writes then Brauwelt Int'l (1986) reports
 ...
>(It concludes that the qualitative
>differences in beers produced with decoction vs. infusion
>mashes were "extradinordinally small," and that, "based on a


I think the debate is still open for additional evidence.  Kunze "TB&M"
(revised in the mid 1990s) states of triple decoction, "...three mash
processes produce very aromatic beers".


As for Louis Bonham's and Andy Thomas' "RIMS vs Decoction" BT article, the
results are to me inconclusive or perhaps favor decoction.  The second part
of the test involved a bock beer in which the decoction version suffered
from some rather extreme fermentation problems.  Taste comparisons for that
beer can offer little information that would sway me.


For the first part, a helles recipe, the judges preferred the decoction
helles 5 to 1 - quite decisive.  The judges did prefer the maltiness of the
RIMs helles 3 to 1, but also made several references to grainy (negative)
flavors in the RIMS helles.


Another mitigating factor is that the BT article states, "... and Andy has
found that shorter [10-15 minute decoction] boil times are sufficient to
extract Bavarian  style flavor".  The article states in a footnote that Greg
Noonan believes that longer boil times improve flavor. This was also the
opinion of Art Beall, this year's Ninkasi winner (who won on lagers and a
german wheat), in private communication.


To be fair the BT article does accurately state these results, but many
HBers seem to think that the clear conclusion is the decoction doesn't
matter.  The  matter is "open to debate" is the stated article conclusion.


What do I think ?  That decoction is a lot of work and time but does very
probably add a small but noticeable improvement in flavor.  I also
personally think that pressure cooking wort (see comments by me,
C.Scandrett, and experiments by Charlie Rich in the HBD archives) adds many
of the same benefits with more hardware and less time & effort.

Material within the plastic can leach out particularly into alcohol and
fats.  For non-food grade plastics, the residual plastisizer levels may be
high, the colorants toxic, and in the case of recycled plastics may contain
such nasties as insecticides residue.  The FDA website has some notes on
recycled plastics and their content.


Is it dangerous ? Improbable, but why take a chance.  You can often get free
but dirty FG buckets simply by asking politely at a bakery, or new ones from
US plastics.
