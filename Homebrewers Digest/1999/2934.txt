Sean,


I've made one coffee stout, and sampled several batches made by a
close friend. All
were made with 1/4 to 1/2 cup of ground coffee beans added 10 or 15
minutes prior to
the end of the boil. Then strained out while pouring into the
fermentor. They all
tasted good, but 1/2 cup makes for a VERY coffee stout. My next batch
will have 1/4
to 3/8 cup in it. I'm afraid to admit it, but I just made a porter
with 3/4 cup of
Tasters Choice instant coffee in it. I boiled it in 1 pint of water
and added it to
the secondary. It honestly tastes great. Just enough coffee flavor to
taste, but it's
weak enough to make you wonder if it's coffee or some other roast
flavor. I've had
more compliments on it than most beers I've made.


As for the barleywine. I just transfered a new barleywine to the
secondary, and
pitched champagne yeast to it. It was fermented for a week with
Wyeast #1056 American
Ale yeast,  just barely starting to settle, that way there was still
plenty of
available sugars for the champagne yeast to get a good quick start.
I've sampled
friends barelywines made with the same yeast combination, and they're
better than any
barleywine I've bought. I would recommend it. Good luck with both
batches.

Subject: barley wine yeast, not food grade plastic


Sam in San Diego asks about champagne yeast for barley wine. I've just
been reading about this in "Designing great Beers", Ray Daniels(which is
a great book). He uses commercial records and'93/'94 NHC second round
entries to construct profiles for several styles of beer. The following
are some thoughts from him.  There is no record of anything but ale
yeast in historical records. Today some micros and homebrewers do use
champagne or wine yeast in the US.  NHC entries used a wide varity of
yeasts but no champagne, 3 entries used American ale, the only
duplicate. In some research he quotes 15 ale yeasts attained higher
attentuation than the 5 champagnes tested. He suggests maximize
aereation and repitch the yeast from a prior batch.  For my N2K barley
wine I intend to use Yeast Culture Kit A8 English Barleywine to brew a
brown ale and rack my barleywine wort onto the yeast from that brew.

Subject: oh no! an aeration question


When I got my aeration system I bought a air pump setup.  Penny wise and
pund foolish.  Needless to say it takes quite a long time.  The
instructions say that I should aerate for 1 hour before pitching, and
one hour after pitching.  The problem is, when I transfer from my brew
pot, after cooling of course, I strain the wort to aif in trub
elimination and filter out hop residue.  This produces a lot of foam.
Now I start to aerate and I quickly get a huge amount of foaming.  It is
impossible to even come close to aerateing for 1 hour.  What do I do?  I
tried not straining ( I do whirlpool to syphon awaay from the trub ),
but it still gets quite foamy.  Should I foam away and just have a big
mess, but a well aerated wort?


Thanks,

Well, I was hoping someone would help me with my hope to achieve very
low
final gravities in my IPA but I had no takers. Maybe if a share
something 
someone will help me.


This is how I have been sanitizing bottles for the last 6 batches. It
was given to me by a home brewer who's day job is as a enologist for
Stags Leap Winery. I rinse my clean bottles making sure to leave about
1/2 oz or so of water in them. I then stack them on their sides in my
oven and heat them to 170 deg for 20 min. According to her: wet heat
kills, but some spores can survive dry heat. I then shut off the oven.
If I remember to do this a few hours before I need to bottle I just let
them cool in the oven. Otherwise I open the door and let the hot air
out. Then I close the door and wait 20 minutes or so. And repeat until
the temp is down to about 115 deg then you can open the door completely.
If you cool the bottles to quickly they can crack. I like to start to
bottle when the bottles are about 10 to 15 degrees warmer than the beer. 
Pour out the residual water and bottle as you normally do. I find the
beer 
releases a little CO2 when it hits the hot glass and makes it easier to
cap 
on foam.


I have not had an infection yet but I still consider the process
experimental. I find it much easier than any other sanitizing I have
tried.


Cheers,

Mark Bayer had a number of good points/questions


> question:  what does mashing at 155-160 deg f contribute, other than more

Malty and sweet are not the same thing.  When working with a high
sacc. temperature, effectively you're allowing a higher percentage of
starches to remain as dextrins.  These are pre-cursors to sugars.
Malt flavor compounds (Maillard's) are created from sugar and amino
acids and high temperatures - a separate phenomenon.  The necessary
entity here is the nitrogen from the amino acids.  Malt flavor is
created in the malt house, or from decoction/pressure cooking, but not
from mashing.  If it isn't in the grain, and you don't do anything
funky, then you aren't gonna get many malty flavors.  Mashing at a
high sacc. temperature isn't going to magically create melanoidins
that weren't there originally.


A high sacc. temp. also shouldn't contribute much sweetness, per se.
Any sugar in the wort will be consumed by the yeast, unless something
is very wrong.  A high temp. mash will lead to more "body", and more
foamstand, and less alcohol, and definately a different flavor, but I
don't think it would necessarily be a sweeter flavor profile.

Hi folks,


        Harold Dowda asks about the easiest way to cut out
the tops of his kegs.  


        For me, I cut the tops out of my kegs using a rotary
tool (Dremel) and the fiber reinforced discs.  The job
lasted about 30 min and 2 discs per keg.  Eye and ear
protection required.  Mark your cutout circle, have a seat
and start grinding.  Then switch to the sanding drum to
deburr.


        Harold, the next step is to buy a bimetal hole cutter
for your drill and install a bulkhead fitting.  I bought brass
1/2"  SWAGELOC fittings for $6/pc and 1/2" brass
ball-lock valves with stainless ball for $8/pc (the kind used
for natural gas lines).  Brass is fine to use... just remember
to use Palmer's recipe for de-leading brass.  On the inside
of your keg you can install a manifold, false bottom or a
piece of copper tube with some stainless screen attached.


        I hope this info helps, any extraneous info should be
happily ignored.


Prost!

In fact, it is easy to design a RIMS setup with a single burner.  OTOH I find
that the point in the brewing process that requires multiple brewing vessels
is during the sparge.  You need to have someplace for the Hot Liquor to be
stored and supplied from at the same time that you need someplace for the wort
to run-off to.


In my electric RIMS setup I have a 48 qt coolers for HLT, a 40 qt cooler for
the mash/lauter tun and a 1/2 barrel keg and propane burner for the kettle.
My regular process goes something like this:  


1)  Fill mashtun with correct quantity of hot strike water and use RIMS to
bring it to desired strike temp.  At the same time I fill the kettle with the
sparge water quantity and begin to heat it to ~180 degrees.  This typically
takes quite a while at a low burner setting, however, there is no rush at this
point.  I then go of and mill the grain.  One of the key benefits of an
electronically controlled RIMS is that I can multitask.
2)  Mash-in and conduct RIMS mash.  This is kind of independent of any other
vessels at this point.  When Hot Liquor reaches temperature I transfer it to
the HLT (cooler) where it stays at temp for hours with negligible heat loss.
3)  Lautering is accomplished by continuing to run the pump, cutting the flow
rate down to a minimal trickle and redirecting the output to the kettle.  As
the run-off collects in the kettle I can begin bringing it to a boil by firing
up the burner.  This is the only time I allow the pump to touch the wort so I
have minimal concerns about the pump's sanitation.  This is pretty much the
only point where I find it advantageous to have 3 separate vessels, but only
one of them need be directly heatable.


Hope my sharing my setup and process will give you some ideas that you can
incorporate in yours.

I was basing my comments in part on the interview with Michael Jackson in
Malt Advocate - late Fall issue, p. 38 "I think they [Scottish distillers]
massively fail to comprehend the importance of yeast strains.  There's
really a whole lot that hasn't been explored there."  I also remember
reading elsewhere that they use dry yeast.  Bourbon makers, as I mentioned
earlier, are different.  Some use dry yeast, some use hopped starters with
proprietary yeasts, and some deliberately introduce lactobacillus with
proprietary yeast for sour yeast (not the same as sour mash).

Sean Murphy (smurphy`at`sdcoe.k12.ca.us) asks about the timing of
a diacetyl rest:
>I would like to do a diacetyl rest but am not sure of the exact
>time to do the rest.  Miller's Homebrewing guide recommends

Miller is referring to a Narziss fermentation:  "...some German
breweries actually raise the temperature of the beer from 48 to
60 (degrees F) when fermentation is about two-thirds finished..."
(Fix writes in his Brewing Techniques article that the temp. is
allowed to increase to 68 degrees F.) This is done in the initial
fermentation, before the beer is racked, to keep the beer in
contact with the yeast until diacetyl is reduced. Miller gives a
guideline when to do this:  "when it (the bubbling of the airlock)
is down to once a minute or so, you can reckon that fermentation is
over and it is all right to rack. If you want to do a diacetyl rest,
now is the time."
What I find confusing is when Miller writes under "Professional
Procedures" the following:  "If necessary, the temperature is
lowered to about 35 (degrees F) for a "diacetyl rest" of 2 to 3
days after fermentation is over.
In any case, as I suggested a few days ago, Fix's article is a must
read on this topic at:

David Lamotte was wondering what "< 1 cfu/ml" meant concerning bacterial 
contamination of liquid yeasts.  < 1 cfu/ml means there is less than one 
"colony-forming unit" per ml of solution.  If 1 ml of a test solution is 
cultured on an agar plate, there will be less than 1 colony detected 
after incubation.  In general, 1 bacterial cell would lead to one colony 
but does not preclude more than 1 cell clumped together which would 
still grow up as one colony.

I would not exactly call it a screw up.  Using a starter that was created 
from pitching a swollen smak pak in a  gallon of wort is still about 40 
times better than pitching the swollen smak pak directly into 5 gallons of 
wort.  Bottom line is that you still used a  gallon starter in a five 
gallon batch of beer.  This is completely adequate.  The five gallon batch 
of beer doesn*t know or care that you may have slightly under pitched the 
 gallon starter.  It will still contain roughly the same number of 
yeast cells.

I seriously doubt that many people could detect an increased sweetness 
between two supposedly identical brews; one mashed at 151 degrees F and 
one mashed 4 degrees higher at 155 degrees F.  Theoretically, there should 
be an increased dextrine content in the higher temp mash, but common 
inconsistencies in home brew practice such as yeast type, pitching volume, 
and fermentation temperature would quickly mask these effects.  (My 
apologies to any bloated egos out there with equally bloated opinions of 
their super sensitive palettes :-)


Tom writes about using aluminum foil.  I always cover the tops of my 
sanitized and dried bottles with a small square of aluminum foil.  It 
keeps the dust out.  I have gotten to the point where I will not even brew 
a batch unless I have enough bottles that are ready to go.  This has 
greatly reduced my stress level at bottle time (have you ever had to 
bottle on quick notice because your have to go out of town and then find 
out that you didn*t have enough bottles ready?).  Anyway, cover them with 
foil and store in boxes or rubbermaid totes.  They will last pretty much 
indefinitely.

I agree.  I have used 1968 quite a few times, and I have always been
happy with the results.  Like Dave, all I do is shake the heck out of
the carboy for aeration.  I have never had a final gravity as high as
the 1.019 mentioned in another post.


Remember, too, that 1968 is derived from Fullers of London, and is
designed for cask conditioned ESB's.  I have had the pleasure of
hoisting a few cask conditioned Fullers in London, and users trying to
emulate this beer should expect more maltiness than you might find in,
say, a SNPA.


We have to be careful not to commit the "single cause" fallacy when
troubleshooting.  Like most situations in our lives, the results of
brewing beer are dependant upon a variety of causes.  Poor attenuation
or a sweet taste in the final product can be caused by a number of
factors or combinations of factors.  You have to be careful about
assuming that one and only one factor causes a result.


Not that I want to teach a logic class, but another related fallacy is
called "post hoc."  First we do something, and when something else
happens later, we tend to assume that what came first caused what came
second.  Sometimes it does.  Sometimes it's a coincidence.  You need to
investigate further to see if there's a true relationship between the
two.

This has been reported to me as being used successfully (I happily seem to

sure to mash any cornmeal with 30% malt for ~20 min. before boiling it and

I use foil!  My SOP now is when I empty a bottle I immediately clean
it with a squirt of 'softsoap' sitting by the sink, shake around
vigorously to remove any sediment, then rinse. Then, I fill the bottle
with a squirt of bleach soln and fill with cold tap.  I cover each
bottle with a square of foil.  I store the bottles this way.  When
bottling time comes along, I dump the bleach and rinse with my bottle
washer - I reuse the foil and cover the clean bottle until I fill with
beer and cap.  Saves at least the step of soaking the bottles just
prior to bottling.  Actually, it just spreads it out over time. 
Rinsing two cases of bottles takes me about 20 minutes.  Sanitizing
AND rinsing used to take at least a couple times as long, including
soak time.  My only concern is the couple cases of bleach sitting
around where kids can get at it - not cool, very dangerous.

In his response to a N2O questions, Dan Listermann comments about N2
for stouts: " N2 is almost inert and cannot pass through the walls of
a bubble this way so they last longer."


I've seen this comment on the HBD before, but I don't understand how
N2 could get into the bubbles in the first place.  The N2 is
introduced through the top of the keg to push the beer out through the
dip tube in the bottom.  If N2 is indeed insoluble in beer, how does
it get to the dip tube to come out in the bubbles?


If that's the case, then isn't the real point of a CO2/N2 gas to allow
a lower CO2 partial pressure to permit lower carbonation levels in
kegged beer when the length of the dispensing tube requires a higher
total gas pressure to push the beer out of the tap? If that's the
case, then isn't N2 a red herring when trying to get a thick head?

Subject: Brew Stands/Nitrous Oxide/Lighter Side/Cancelling posts


Badger Roullett <branderr`at`microsoft.com> asked about Brew Stands...


I'm looking for one and here are my options.  Most of the people who sell
systems don't sell racks unless they include lots of other bells and
whistles.  What I have found:


1.  St. P*t's sells a stand available in either iron or stainless for
around $400 in stainless, near $300 iron.  It can't be taken apart so it
has to be shipped by truck (about $150 from TX to OH), but does have the
facility for attaching burners and can be mounted on casters.  Look at
their catalog for details.  I know some people hate them, but when I called
and asked questions, I got precise answers about dimensions.


2.  Modesto Brewing Supply sells the "Penquat Brew Tree" which they have
advertised in Zymurgy occasionally (Summer 1996 p. 73, Spring 96 p. 84).
They're tough to get a hold of by phone, but the pictures in Zymurgy look
interesting and I'm awaiting info by mail about the details.  You can call
them at 1-800-CXS-BREW.  The Penquat can be shipped by UPS, but you have to
assemble it.


3.  People like pbs say they do custom work, but I haven't talked to them
about just a stand and don't know if they do stands without the kettles and
other stuff.  Likewise for pico-brewing, etc.


4.  I'm also considering taking a drawing to Joe Schmoe's welding here in
town and seeing what they'd charge to make a rack for me.  My guess is
these small welding shops could do it without too much trouble and the
price could possibly be negoti-beer-ated depending on how much business
they have at the time.


No affiliation with any of the above.
- ---------------------------------------
Jeff Hall asked about Nitrous Oxide


Dan Listermann said "NO2 forms nitric acid...."


Actually, Nitrous Oxide is N2O.  My concern about this would be that N2O
decomposes into nitrogen (N2) and free radical oxygen that either
recombines to make oxygen or reacts with anything it finds to oxidize it
rapidly.  Something about using a gas that will oxidize your beer just
doesn't seem like a good plan.
- ---------------------------------------
On the lighter side:  over the holidays, I managed to use the word "gueuze"
in a game of Scrabble, getting a triple (or would that be tripel?) letter
score for the Z.  Luckily, I had my copy of Jackson's Belgian Ale book
(mandatory airport reading) so I could document the word.  My goal was
"zymurgy" for a triple word score, but my family has decreed that I can't
use any more dorky beer words.  Hmph!

Eric,


I use a 30K BTU Superb burner running off the furnace NG line in my garage.  I
went to the local bottle gas company and picked up a gas valve that has a 1/2"
pipe thread on one end and a 3/8" flare on the other.  Then I purchased a 10'
(thick black) gas hose with 3/8" flare fittings crimped on to each end of the
hose.  This connects NG valve to the burner's gas valve.  I have a couple of
3/8" flare caps to protect the fittings and protect against any curious kids
"accidentally" turning on the gas valve when I'm not around.


I wouldn't use the hose you are talking about.  It is way too easy to kink or
puncture and can fall off of the barb fitting near the burner causing a fire.
The gas hose I have is REALLY tough and with the flare fittings I don't have
to worry about it falling off.  


Where is the gas orifice in your setup?  You don't want to run straight off of
the gas line without an orifice.  It has been a while since I've taken a water
heater apart so I can't remember if it was in the burner or in the valve.


>Also, since NG is low pressure, low flow, I should be able to get some 
>flame control from the ball valve shut-off, right?  I mean, for the most 
>part, I'll want to go full bore anyway, boiling 7-10 gallons at 30K BTU,
right?


I don't think you want to control the gas flow at the beginning of the line.
What if for some reason the pressure drops (kink the hose if you use the tan
burner hose) and the flame backs up the hose?  Again, a possible fire.  I'd
try to have a valve with orifice right at the burner for control.  The bottle
gas companies have all kinds of valves and fittings.  If you take the burner
in I'm sure they can fix you up.  


I normally boil 7 1/2 gallons of runnings and have the gas valve on my superb
about 2/3 open to keep a good rolling boil.  I also light the flame (running
very low) after collecting enough runnings to cover the bottom of my 1/2 bbl
boiler.  I keep turning the flame up as I sparge and get a boil typically
about 10 min after the sparge using this procedure.


Good luck and hope this helps,

Greetings All!


        I have noticed a number of posts recently from people planning
Milennial Barley Wines.  I am about to bottle mine, and thought I would
throw the recipe out there for the collective.


        All Grain / 3 Gallons


        12.5 lbs pale ale malt
         1.0 lbs crystal malt (40 L)
         0.5 lbs dextrin malt
         1.5 ozs each Fuggles and EKG (~5.5% AA)


        Single infusion at 154 F in a 5 gallon Gott cooler, at about 1.1
qts/lb.  Sparged to 4 gallons, 90 minute boil.  Added Fuggles for 60
mins, EKG 1/2 oz each for 30 and 15 mins.  Added Irish moss at 15 mins,
chilled and topped up to 3 gallons.  Open fermented in 4 gallon
stainless pot, transferred to glass secondary afetr 10 days.  I pitched
with Nottingham dry (quickly becoming a favorite), OG 1.100, GF 1.013. 
Taste test from the gravity reading was superb.  Malt, hops, esters... a
little bit of everything.  All kind of understated, though.  I plan on
dry hopping with the last 1/2 oz of EKG and then bottling.  Now I wonder
how long I can make 3 gallons last...


        Quick question, as well.  Does anyone know of a source for plastic
cylindroconical fermenters in the 1 to 3 barrel range?  I haven't got
the boiler and mash tuns yet, but I know those can be worked out. 
Private e-mail is fine, and if anyone wants the information just dropme

*ChemGeek alert*


I read that someone was concerned with the quality of information on
this forum, so I'll suggest:


First
N2 = molecular nitrogen = major component in air
NO = nitric oxide = nasty colorless gas
NO2 = nitrogen dioxide = nasty brown gas
HNO3 = nitric acid
N2O = dinitrogen oxide = nitrous oxide = colorless gas, anesthetic,
and aerosol propellant


>From Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, Cotton and Wilkinson, 5th, pp.
320,321:
"Nitrous oxide is relatively unreactive....  At elevated temperatures
it decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen...and supports combustion."


>He told me that CO2 forms carbonic acid as it passes through the
bubbles.


Yes, see Adv. Inorg. Chem, 5th, pp 245.


>N2 is almost inert and cannot pass through the walls of a bubble this
way so they last longer. NO2 forms nitric acid and acts in ways
similar to CO2.


I don't know about the first statement.  I thought there was a
difference in the solubility of CO2 vs. N2 in aqueous solutions, and
this caused the bubbles to act differently (I guess that is saying the
same thing).  But N2O is 'relatively unreactive' and does not form
HNO3 in water.  Otherwise every time some kid sucks on a whip-it vial
his insides would melt.  However, NO2 = nitrogen dioxide (which is not
the nitrous oxide in whip-its) does react with water to give HNO3 (See
Adv. Inorg. Chem., 5th, pp. 324).


>I would have to say that NO2 is no substitute for N2.


I don't know about N2O (nitrous oxide) as a substitute for N2, but NO2
is NOT a substitute for N2.


>He did say that the nitric acid has a sweet taste??????????


Ouch


So I didn't give an answer, 'Is N2O (nitrous oxide) a substitute for
N2?' but only clarified the question.  Typical ChemGeek procedure.

I used to do it a lot when I bottled, but it became a pain in the butt
to handle all those little wee pieces of foil.  What I ended up doing
is lining the bottom of the beer case with paper towel and just turning
the bottles upside down into it.


Now I keg my beer.
