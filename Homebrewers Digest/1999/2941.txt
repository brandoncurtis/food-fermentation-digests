Subject: Sparklers


Jeff Luck enquired as to what a sparkler is. As I'm writing from
Yorkshire and put down a pint drawn through one a scant few minutes ago
I'll take a whack at this one. A sparkler is a device that attaches to
the end of the swan neck on a beer engine. It can come in several forms
but all have in common that the beer is forced through small apertures
which disturbs it and causes tiny CO2 bubbles to form giving, in a beer
with proper protein spectrum, a rich, creamy, long lasting head. The
publicans here seem to like to violently spray the first pull into the
glass, then lower the sparkler beneath the surface as they complete
pulling the pint. When the glass is put onto the bar the beer is so full
of bubbles  that the color can't be discerned i.e. you can't tell which
one is the bitter and which the Old Peculier.


Not all beers benefit from sparkler treatment. It is generally
associated with the beers of the north though sparklers are  now finding
their way, often improperly, into establishments in the south. The CAMRA
guide indicates in its listings which brewers' beers should be pulled
through a sparkler (little shower head symbol next to the brewery name)
and which should not (showerhead with a transverse bar through it).

Subject: re: dextrins/proteins/head/sweetness AND Yeast


Steve Alexander writes a wonderful summary of how malt selection and 
processing can affect malty flavors and head retention in HBD 2939, 
continuing the discussions from last year. I recommend everyone interested 
in this topic to review a number Steve's past posts, especially if you're 
interested in the details of what goes on in the mash tun, decoction kettle 
at the molecular level. Just read it reallllll sloowwwww.


However, he only hints at what yeast does to impact malty flavors:
[Steve]
Oddly yeast seem to have a big impact on an aspect of flavor that is
sometimes called maltiness.  To my mind this is different than
aromatic maltiness, but I'm not sure that I can characterize the
flavor any better than that.  Yeast choice matters when it comes to
malty character.


[me] Boy do I agree with that. I have on occasion split batches of wort 
between yeasts (as many of us have) and been really surprised at the taste 
differences. Now those of us that have used some of the Wyeast Belgian 
strains to make Dubbles and Tripels know that yeast can have a profound 
taste impact. But there are much more subtle differences in other yeast strains.


Take for instance CalCommon 2112. I can't believe how strong the malt 
flavors come through with this yeast when I make a steam beer or even an 
altbier with this yeast. Its great for that. Fermenting the same wort with 
1056 produces a clean beer sure, but instead of malt, you get hop flavors 
and bitterness accentuated (and a drier beer too). The Scottish Ale yeast 
(1728?) has the same sort of impact, focusing on the malty character of the 
wort.


Next time you make an IPA, split the batch a few ways with 1056, 1968, 1728 
just to see for yourself. I've been trying to come up with a clone for 
HopDevil (Jim B just clams up when I ask for hints) and I'm convinced that 
there is a yeast contribution that is other than the typical 1056 used for 
american pale ales. (am I right jim?...).


Play with yeast, you'll really be surprised how it changes the character of 
your beers.

Subject: Polenta & CAP


I am planning on using polenta in a CAP tomorrow and was wondering how much
to use by weight to substitute for flakes. Since flakes are dry and polenta
soggy, I thought about using 120% more polenta than flakes. If I used 19
lbs of malt and want to shoot for 24% corn, I would use 6 lbs of flakes. If
I use 120% more polenta than flakes I would use 6*1.2 = ~ 7.5 lbs of
polenta. Does this sound right? Is 120% too high?

Subject: Kegging w/ CO2, but w/o a tank&regulator


Hi Folks,
        The recent thread about kegging without a tank reminded me of an 
idea I had a few years back but never followd up on, or tested. The 
principle is to use the fermentation process to provide the CO2 
necessary to dispense your beer.  Here is the basic setup


Equipment:
        Two S.S. soda kegs. 
        Two gas in fittings
        Two beer out fittings 
        Three hoses 
        One thumb tap 
        One large syringe
        Hose clamps etc.


1) Begin by priming and kegging in one soda keg. Allow the beer to 
naturally carbonate.
2)  When you are getting close to the point where you want to serve 
the beer make a small (perhaps a half a gallon might suffice) batch 
in the second soda keg using DME and pitch some yeast.  You might 
use dry yeast, or the sediment from a fermenter. 
3) Allow the yeast to ferment a bit and purge the headspace of the 
keg. Close the vent and allow the yeast to ferment some more.
4)  Make up a hose with gas fittings on both ends. Connect the gas 
ports on the kegs together.
5)  Attach the dispensing line to the beer out on the main keg, and serve.
6)  Attach a short length of hose to the second beer fitting and 
clamp the tip of the syringe securely inside the short hose.
7) When the fermentation and pressure subside you will need to feed 
the yeast in the auxiliary soda keg. Remove the plunger and sanitze 
the syringe setup. Fill the syringe with sterile wort and replace the 
plunger. MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON THE PLUNGER as you attach the syringe 
to the beer port on the auxilliary keg and then depress the plunger 
to feed the yeast through the dip tube. Repeat as needed.


        I realize that the feeding process (actually the whole process!) I 
outlined has a number of potential problems associated with it but I'll 
leave it up to anyone who is brave (or foolish) enough to try this to 
work the details.  I assume no liability for injuries sustained from 
high velocity projectile syringe plungers,  but I will demand 
royalties if anyone makes money off this idea!:^)


                                                Have Fun,


                                                Simon Andrew Wesley

Subject: GFCI, just curious


Every time I read a post or website about brewing with electricity, I
think to myself......hmmmmm, why is everyone so anal about GFCI
protection?


I have a few theories:


1. Don't know anything about electricity, therefore "Me Too".
2. Know too much about electricity, therefore "Me know, me too".
3. "me too"
4. Don't know what an equipment ground is, or what its used for. (see
#1)
5. Like to be ultra safe whether knowledgeable or not.




It doesn't seem to damn likely that someone is gonna stick their head or
hand in a bucket of boiling wort and get electrocuted, but I guess it
could happen. Most people never give a thought to the fact that their
electrically heated water coming out of the shower head isn't GFCI
protected.


Hmmmm....

Subject: Wine into fishes and walking on beer !


A few tuppenceworth from SW England resulting from HBD2939 :-
I don't usually say too much, so indulge me ,,,


J. Matthew Saunders said
I'd say that a post on Beer in times past--in and outside the Bible
or any other text--is on topic.


One is not, according to list-iquet, supposed to send messages saying
'me too' or 'I agree' , but I DO agree with Matthew, particularly as
I had never before thought about what the common person in Judea would
have been drinking. The orig. post on this topic got me thinking and
it was quite an entertaining and surprising experience !
Dredging up the brain cell(s), was it not the Romans who introduced
the hop to to northern europe and hyperborea anyway? They must have had
a good reason for this ? Was it because it was their preferred beverage,
were they tired of all that wine and what was his name, Baccus?
Did the common roman erk bring it whilst his masters were importing
wine at vast expense from the south and trying to get the grape to grow
so far north ?
- ----
Hang on, I'm not done just yet, on a light hearted note :-
further down #2939 Rod Prather says
"Brings a whole new meaning to Sunday morning communion.   "This drink
in rememberance of me"  POP, FIZZ, GLUG, GLUB, BURP.


well, in the church I used to be taken to in my childhood
(long time ago - dont know what they say now )
it went something like this :
The goblet of wine was presented and this intoned,
 " In remembrance of Me, drink ye all of this "


well, of course some of us sometimes did ! Deliberately ignoring the
semantics which were more akin to the american y'all ie. the assembled
multitude. Not supposed to be all the contents of the goblet!


- ----
Even further down Jeff Renner says :
Jeff (Hoping to spread oil on troubled waters)


hmmm, I do believe the Romans ( you see, I am trying to keep on thread!)
used oil on the surface of their wine stored in amphorae (amphoras?sp.)
to prevent oxidation/infection ? Before the use of corks and bottles.
What's up, had they not found the cork-oaks of Portugal or not
discovered how to make bottles with parallel( cylindrical ) necks then ?
Does this suggest that for a truly authentic brew that we should maybe
use olive oil to keep our beer under, not a keg ? he he te he <G> !


- ---
On a less frivolous note Jeff also said :
 Today in the US, especially, many use it to promulgate
intolerance and bigotry of the worst sort. 


Huh? what's special about the US ? Just look round the rest of the world
from N.Ireland via the Balkans, mid-East, to the (indian?) subcontinent
to Tibet, need I say more ? On second thoughts don't bother looking, its
too depressing. This could be why I dont know what they say, now, in
that church of long ago.
Opps, sry, my last post on that bit of off-topicness, lets get back to
beer and brewing, past,present and future with emphasis on the humour
and pleasure of it. Good will to all brewers.


Thanks to y'all for many interesting digests, I will now go back into
obscure lurk-mode. ( without asking if it is true that the Egyptians,
in the times of the pyramids, made their beer from loaves of bread or
what their leavening was. )

        I agree with you...flavor profile rules....and the flavor imparted by the
yeast I used  'stood alone' on the 'shelf/tap' of 96 GABF, among many
micros, including some that have long dominated the Barleywine
category.....now, if you can name any 'shelf/tap' that has 40 Barleywines,
other than GABF, I'd like to hear of it....
        A further assurance to you, in regards flavor imparted by a dry yeast, is
the rating given by James Robertson and his team for the "Beer Taster's
Log," of 99/100 for my beer brewed with a Dry Yeast....from a panel of 5
tasters.....


> In
>general I still dont see and did not see many commercial packaging

        I have long been aware that there are many major and micro breweries that
use dried yeast for their brews....Individual agreements preclude me from
knowing, yet alone naming them, but.....the bottom line, as you say, is
flavor.....


>One way to stand out is to find a very unique yeast, that, not many -
>if any,
>of breweries in the area are using.


        It is my experience that the best and easiest way to stand apart is to keep
your brews 'clean'.....a process which seems to elude most that I
encounter.......


Picking it is quite a difficult

        And that's where you get into trouble, repitching 'very many'
times.....Yes, I do know breweries that repitch countless times....BUT, they
do lab analysis on the yeasts they RE-CULTURE and GROW, for viability,
vitality, purity, etc.....
        But, to me, (and what do I know?) repitching more than 5 times is asking
for trouble.......and again on the 'what do I know,' I virtually never
repitched (`at` LABCO)....finding the cost of using a new brick to be
negligible......(`at` CABCO, we frequently repitched, never more than 5
times)...no probs...
        But, as you say, the Lallemand yeasts I have long been using did not come
with a certificate of purity.....I only found them not to need one....
        OTOH, Mr. Bonham's reports on their use, in BT, found no problems
either.....Indeed he remarked on his surprise at their qualities...
        Another who knows a damn sight more than I, Dave Draper, remarked on his
changed attitude to dry yeast after using this product, in these pages of
HBD....

        The math shows me that when I make a 7 bbl batch that uses less than 25
bucks in yeast to make over 3 grand in retail, even `at` $ 2.25/pint (compare
that to where YOU live!!) prices, with no lab equipment, nor management of
yeast time......DOH! I have been so stupid! I could have bought an
autoclave, hood, microscope, dedicated refridgerators, and incubators, and
spin centrifuges.........not to mention lab personnel!
        Instead, I spent 20 minutes in rehydration/attemperation....Time
incorporated in knockout......! DOH! I have been so stupid!

        Lou, your point is well raised...though I had hoped to stimulate discussion
on the issue raised by the Ingledew paper, that yeast generate more ethanol
during growth than that of the non growing cells.....
        I guess that is not going to be argued....
        BTW, for those that want the reference...."Applied and Environmental
Microbiology, Sept 1984, p 639-646, Vol 48, No 3., Casey, Magnus, Ingledew"
can be obtained from  .. www.isinet.com or  1-800-336-4474. Cost seems to be
about 10 bucks, maybe more.....


        But the essentials are these....as questioned most notably in a private
communication from Pete Santerre....who understates his acuity....
        1) High yeast growth does lead to higher fusel production..
        2) Lower temps of fermentation decrease fusel production....Higher temps =
More fusels...
        3) Fusels are a product of 'spillover' of amino acid metabolism, and
carbohydrate metabolism...obviously, in a high grav brew....there are many
more of these reactions occurring...thence, more fusels.....
        4) "Fusels are pretty much there for the duration".....Some are
oxidized...for no matter the storage, nor the method ..there is some O2..
        5) "Fusels are pretty much there for the duration".......Some is
volatilized...though this is a very, almost insignificant amount....
        6) "Fusels are pretty much there for the duration".....Some will be
attached to the products of protein degradation....and yeast
autolysis....(keep in mind that we have been talking about high grav
brewing.....it follows that there is a long lagering.....and most of these
products, if not all, are not filtered, in a BP/Homebrew environment...as
opposed to a commercial high grav brew, that will be diluted and
filtered)....
        7) Remembering that esters are the product of a reaction of an organic acid
with ethanol....and that "Fusels are pretty much there for the
duration".....a slow, up to 2 years or longer reaction of fusels with other
organic acids, (from autolysis, protein degradation, etc)will lead to
formation of more esters.....This is a slow process...BUT..
        8) "Fusels are pretty much there for the duration"....this is why, even
with a 12 months or 24 months aged barleywine...consumption of a "fair bit"
(scientific term) will result in a 'hang-over' or head ache....
        In short, in a VERY complex chemical reaction(s)....the "Fusels are pretty
much there for the duration." Maturation and 'softening' of a high grav brew
is a long term, and complex process.....

This seems to be a pretty common mis-conception.  Everyone seems
scared to death of the autolysis-trub-bogeyman, and feels they have to
rack at 1 week (or 2 weeks, or whatever).  Bigger beers take longer to
ferment.  If it's still fermenting, leave it alone.  Even if it's not
fermenting actively, leave it alone for awhile.  About the worst thing
you could do is take it off the primary yeast cake.  As long as there
is sugar available, you have no risk of autolysis, and any trub
compounds the yeast wanted they took long ago.

Subject: : Lager Questions


Kelly had some trouble with a lager fermenting out completely.  Here's what
was said:


The first 5 gallons went to the 1st
carboy . The next 3.5 went to the second, where I added 1 gallon of boiled
and cooled water. 1st carboy 1.064 the second should be around the 1.050
range. I had a starter of Bavarian Lager Yeast going for a while at 48
degrees in a well controlled fridge.a full 1 gallon bottle of yeast stepped
up about 6 times. A fine looking yeast sample at high krausen when pitched.


Now, the complaint is that the first carboy has not fermented out as well.
I've got an observation that I encountered when fermenting a batch of ale
in a similar manner.  


You had a 1 gallon starter of yeast.  Good!  You had 2 batches (no HUGE
fermenter).  Good, me too.  Now, I suspect that after the first carboy was
full, you swirled your starter to rouse the yeast and you dumped half of
the starter into the first batch and half into the second.  If that is not
true, the rest of my discussion is faulty.


If this is how you did it, think of what happens when you swirl your wort
after chilling before running off into a carboy.  Not everyone does this,
but it serves to illustrate.  The swirling after chilling, before running
off is to pile the hops and trub into the center.  When you swirl your
yeast starter, you do the same thing.  You "stack" the yeast in the center
on the bottom and pour off some of the supernatant as your starter into
your larger batch.


Now, it may not be quite that simple, but I know that when I swirl
starters, I've got some large flocs of yeast on the bottom.  Those do
suspend a little, but don't pour off.


I had a Kolsh perform similarly.  Huge starter, first half looked alright,
but didn't ferment out as well as the second.


Two solutions.  Now I split and make 2 starters for 10 gallon batches.  The
other option would be to allow the two to ferment near completion, and then
"mix" the batches in secondary.  Half of each 5 gallon "batch" into each of
the secondaries.


Hope this helps.  If this is too unscientific and not founded on reasonable
logic, I'm always interested in constructive criticism.  We don't learn a
thing if we don't make mistakes, now do we?

I read John Penn's post about using Duvel yeast, which stopped fermenting at
1.030, 
with interest. I've also cultured yeast from bottles of it, and have found it
to slow 
down sometimes at regular fermentation temperatures. It seems to function 
much better at around 76-78 degrees, and will finish a beer off with a very
clean 
flavor at that temperature. As a matter of fact, I fermented with it in the
summer for that very reason!


Just thought I'd add another data point.

Subject: DME vs. LME


        I want to correct or expand on what I saw as an "error" in this
mornings HBD.  A poster mentioned that 1# of DME (dry) was equal to 1.1#
of LME (liquid).  Maybe they meant 1# of LME is equivalent to 1.1# of
grain (which is roughly true depending on efficiency).  I usually use 1#
of DME to 1.3# of LME.  My first couple of recipes in Papazians second
book came out about 10% lower in gravity than I expected.  Then I found
in Noonan's Scotch Ale book that he uses 1.034 ppg for LME vs. Papazians
1.037 ppg.  Voila, the 10% difference.  I now use 1.034 ppg for LME and
1.045 ppg for DME in my spreadsheet and have had pretty good results
such that I don't worry about measuring the OG knowing that I will
probably be within a couple of points of my calculations anyway.  I
realize that I often see a range of 1.042 - 1.045 ppg for DME in
different references and I have seen 1.033 - 1.037 ppg for LME.  As Al
K. once pointed out to me, Alexanders malt extract is about 1.033 ppg
which is lower than some other malts.  But, I usually use M&F LME so the
1.034 ppg seems to work well for that malt.  Liquid malts and dry malts
probably vary a bit among manufacturers but I find 1# of DME vs. 1.3# of
LME to work well for me.  Just another data point.

Subject: Bottling bucket necessary?


Hi all,


I've always racked my wort from the secondary carboy to a bottling bucket
for bottling.  Is this step necessary?  Couldn't I add the primer to the
carboy and stir it in, attach the filler to the siphon hose, then fill the
bottles directly and avoid the intermediate transfer to a bucket?
Potential advantages include saving time, eliminating some aeration, less
beer wasted, and less cleaning.  What are some potential problems?  I
thought the sediment might be a problem, but I have to avoid that when
racking to a bucket anyway.


I'm planning on bottling tonight, and since I couldn't post yesterday, I
won't be able to assess the concensus on this issue in time for this batch.
 It seems to me that those that keg don't bother racking to a bucket.  But
what method do those of you that bottle prefer?  


BTW, I actually enjoy bottling.  I don't drink my beer all that fast, and
have no desire to spend more money on optional equipment, so kegging has
never been a priority for me.  It's also the only process with which my
wife and kids like to help me: they love to operate the capper.  


Thanks for any help,

Hi All,

The single infusion mash schedule you're using is fine for the styles
you're brewing, though you might want to mash a bit lower than 158F for
a pale ale. I suggest adding a little torrified wheat to your grain
bill. Keep the addition small, 1%-2% of the grain bill, and you won't
need to adjust your mash schedule or worry about haze. I use a cup, 8 oz
by volume, in a 10 gallon batch of bitter/pale ale/IPA. No clarity
problems, great foam stand, and the beer leaves a lovely lace on the
side of the glass. IMHO, use of torrified wheat in this manner provides
great head retention in styles with a low level of carbonation.


Eric Fouch provides his approach to beer bullets:

ROTFLMAO!!!! Eric, you are obviously a twisted, irreverent individual -
my kind of guy! If you're ever in the southern New Hampshire area, look
me up and drop by for a pint, we can discuss re-loading techniques.


My own approach is to simply get out of bed on Saturday before the wife
does, and mash-in. She hates brewing smells, so this approach never
fails to send her fleeing to the nearest shopping mall for the day. A
very small price to pay, IMHO.


Cheers,

I can't give you the technical stuff, but I can tell you what I know. Most of
my beers are lacking in the head retention department. My IPA, on the other
hand, has a head that could deflect small-caliber bullets. It is the only beer
I use Briess Carapils in (1/2 pound) and it is the most highly hopped beer I
make (6 oz / five gallons).


>From what I've read crystal malts, carapils, wheat, and/or flaked barley can
improve head retention. Higher hopping rates can help too. Soap residue in the
glass can kill head retention, as can very long protein rests.


AlK's book addresses this on p. 304-5.


Hope this helps,

Subject: Mass. Brewer, Montreal Continuous Fermentation Brewpub


Ips Brewing it is a rumor on the street, Mass Bay (Harpoon) has bought
the labels. Harpoon has great packaging  equipment (a Krones), Ips has
a reasonable sized brewhouse and quite a few fermentation/storage
tanks - may be they will over the road tank it down to Boston for
packaging.  My guess anyway.  Or maybe they will fianlly shut down the
bastardized brewery in Ips..(- did i publically bash my  x competition
again;) sorry Jim/Paul no malice intended.


Speaking of yeast growth.....Any one been to Montreal and gone to the
brewpub that had the Continuous fermentation rig??? I thought they had
sold it off but did anyone have any of the beer produced whilst it was
in operation?? 
I think (***QDAlert*) this type of fermenter would be a great little
toy to play with...

Subject: Excessive blow off


Ian Smith <ISRS`at`Cmed.Com> asks about excessive blow-off and how to avoid
losing the beer.  I often do primary fermentation by splitting a 5 or 6
gallon batch into two carboys with the extra head space keeping the beer
from blasting out, and then rack into a single carboy with no head
space.
