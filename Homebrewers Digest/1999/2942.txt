Subject: Response from St. Pat's


I wrote in an earlier post to HBD that I had e-mailed St. Pat's about their
Moravian malt but had received no reply.  As she points out in her post to
HBD #2940, Lynne O'Connor did respond to me and I suppose I should have
mentioned that in a post to HBD.  I have only bought one thing from St. Pat's
so far but their service was fine and I will probably buy from them again.
I don't want anyone to think my comment was further bashing of St. Pat's.
It wasn't.

The stringent measures used by British pub-chains to avoid wasting beer
aren't really a positive aspect of the business. Landlords are often
penalised if they aren't bringing in the right amount of money for the
amount of beer that they've received, which has often led to landlords
selling short measures to make up the money, or having to sell beer that
has gone off a little, or even to (notoriously) watering down beer to make
up the volume. Of course, it works both ways, and large breweries have
traditionally been wary of landlords writing off spoilt beer which in
reality was good beer that was sold normally. Perhaps this doesn't happen
in the USA because there isn't the tied-house system here.


Bad beer is very common in certain pubs - we always used to say, "Oh, they
don't clean the lines properly." Also, really good beer isn't very common
in touristy central London - not in terms of well-cellared real ale,
anyway, although it is there.


Another way of dispensing real ale, occasionally seen in small country pubs
(the kind which consist of one or two small rooms) is simply by gravity.
These are called taprooms, and the casks are stored behind the bar. Instead
of pumping the beer up from the cellar, the glass is simply filled straight
from a tap attached to the cask. This often results, however, in VERY flat
beer - too flat for my taste.


A question: I often see in the HBD that Microbrewery X uses commercial
yeast Y. Do many of these breweries develop their own yeasts, or do the
yeasts themselves change because of the size of fermenter, wort gravity,
etc? Or is the golden age of each brewery having its own distinctive yeast
long past, and we're merely living on the metaphorical (and literal) dregs
of long-established breweries? What do people think?


Cheers,
Andrew Smith

Subject: N20 Stout-- Done That


Sorry about the long delay in throwing this in-- hope ya'll are still
interested.


I force carbonated a stout with whipped cream chargers about 2 years
ago.  I used mini-kegs, and force-"carbonated" with a whippit cartridge,
then another.  Yes, it did dissolve in the beer.


Odd thing, and I'm not going to open my CRC to try and explain this, but
it actually took 4 capsules to get to the level of "carbonation" I
wanted.  Maybe I had a leak in my mini-keg.  The head was indeed quite
creamy, and didn't hold gas in suspension very well at all-- or at least
it didn't have a carbonated mouthfeel to it.


The nitrous did seem to have an effect.  This was an exceptionally
relaxing beer and brought on effects that I do not attribute to alcohol
intoxication.  (Nothing unpleasant, mind you.)  In fact, this beer
seemed to bring on a bit of a buzz much more quickly than I would have
expected from this particular stout.


So try it out, and have fun.

I'm in the stick all the bottles in a 20 gal bucket full of Chlorox 
water and forget about um camp.  One caution, however.  When 
I first did this I purchased a 20 gal bucket with wheels.   These 
wheels are not made to handle this kind of weight.  By the way
before you fill this bucket make sure you have it where you want
it because it aint goin nowhere after you fill it.  Well the
wheels fell off the bucket and without the wheels it will not stand
up.  So buy a bucket without wheels.  Now I can't get rid of this
garbage can without wheels.  It's hard to get the trash guys
to take a garbage can as trash.

Subject: Kelly's stuck lager and protein rests


     Hi all,
     
     Kelly writes, with regard to Weyermann malts:
     
     "I heard with this Vienna and Munich malt a protein rest
     is the right thing to do."
     
     Back to me:
     
     A protein rest is the wrong thing to do for the following reasons:
     
     1.  High-melanoidin malts like Munich and Vienna are very well 
     modified.  The maltster wants to create as much free amino nitrogen 
     (amino acids) as possible so that there are plenty of reactants for 
     the Maillard reaction.  Sugars and amino acids combine in this 
     reaction to from melanoidins, which range in flavor from malty to 
     bready to caramel and many other things.  They are important flavor 
     and color compounds in beer as well as other foods.
     
     2.  Not a whole lot of protease survive the high temperature kilning 
     of these malts, anyway (especially dark Munich), so you are wasting 
     your time.
     
     3.  As Steve Alexander and I have recently written, protein rests are 
     not only a waste of time these days but can damage your beer, too:
     
     a.  Providing too much free amino nitrogen in the wort can increase 
     ester levels, so if you are trying to make a squeaky clean lager you 
     are hurting the odds of succeeding.
     
     b.  Breaking down the larger proteins will also reduce the body and 
     head potential of the beer.  Note that I said "will," not "may."  The 
     necessity of proteins for good body and head retention is 
     indisputable.  Whether or not you destroy enough of them during a 
     protein rest is another thing, though.  That is why you may be able to 
     perform a protein rest and still get decent heading and body in your 
     beer.  Why do something that is likely to do more harm than good, 
     though?
     
     All of the malts I have seen available to brewers in the US are well 
     modified (if you can believe the spec sheets, which I do).  Even wheat 
     malts can be mashed with a single step infusion.  I brewed a Wit beer 
     with 45% homemade Pilsner malt, 45% raw healthfood store wheat (good 
     thing my mill was adjustable), and 5% oats with only a 20 min. 
     excursion through the protein rest range and had no trouble lautering 
     the wort.  If you can do that with that grain bill, you should be able 
     to skip the p-rest completely when using 100% commercial barley malt.
     
     On to Kelly's real question:  why did the high-gravity half of his 
     wort get stuck at 1.030 while the normal gravity aliquot fermented to 
     completion?
     
     I don't know.  Here are some educated guesses:
     
     1.  You pitched more yeast into one fermenter than the other.
     
     2.  You mention that the high-gravity batch was relatively free of 
     break material while the other was not.  Break can serve as both a 
     yeast nutrient and a CO2 nucleation site.  Too much CO2 does inhibit 
     fermentation.  Agitating the carboy twice per day may release enough 
     CO2 to allow the ferment to finish.  Good beer can be made this way 
     (I've done it, as have many others).
     
     If you are afraid of leaving the beer on the primary yeast for a 
     prolonged period of time (because of autolysis), rack the beer and add 
     a fresh dose of yeast.  Lager yeasts tend to be more forgiving with 
     regard to autolysis than many ale strains, and the low fermentation 
     temperature also helps prevent autolysis, so you may be OK.
     
     Have fun!

Subject: Head Retention and Gluten


Jim Kingsburg asks about head retention improvement.  He should ask his
local homebrew shop to order some Weyermann "Carafoam."   As I understand


it it is a dextrine malt that improves head.  Crosby and Baker import it.




Chad Humphery asks about gluten free beers.  I have made a buckwheat beer


however I have yet to perfect my malting techniques for this grain.  The
malt would not convert itself so the beer I made was 66% buckwheat and 
33%
6-row pale.  I have another batch of malt to try.  The problem with the
buckwheat is that it does not germinate evenly ( or at least evenly
compared to barley ).  I am starting to think that buckwheat picks up 
water
much more quickly than barley.  




You can buy dehulled buckwheat in health food stores and it will 
germinate.
 The buckwheat that I have was sent to me by the farmer and it still has
its hulls.  It lautered very well.

Subject: Sanitation Again


My last batch of pale ale got off to a slow start due to what I believe
were lower than normal temps. in my primary.  After 48 hours and no
activity, I decided to raise the temp. and add another packet of
Nottingham.  Once the temp. came up, fermentation started and everything
was fine.  I was expecting an infection due to the long lag time after
reading many posts on the subject.  The beer came out better than
expected.   I have violated many "sanitation rules" in my short career as
a home brewer and still haven't managed to get an infection.


Sanitation Violations:
1) Hairy arm inserted into cooled wort up to armpit prior to start of
fermentation looking for rubber thingy - no infection
2) No chlorine soak for 5 batches of beer bottles, simple rinse with tap
water - no infection in any bottle
3) 48 hour lag time - no infection
4) Wort cooled in driving rainstorm with no lid - no infection

Corny Kegging and Pressure....
        A simple technique, even for those that wish to prime their kegs, still
requires `at` least 5 lbs CO2 pressure from a CO2 tank to seal the thing...
        By applying CO2 pressure from a CO2 tank, while the handle is
'unlocked'...... lifting the entire keg by the locking handle will seal the
keg.....you can usually hear the gas escaping from around the o-ring until
the o-ring pops into place.......`at` that point, even if the internal pressure
is higher than that desired, relief of pressure to the chosen degree will
not unseat the o-ring......
        Until that o-ring seats....you can throw all other equations out the
door......even if you do wish to prime; with a corny, you must have a tank
source of CO2 to seal the thing.....


Mold in the Brew...
        George De Piro abuses me verbally and asks about an old episode...
        Whilst `at` LABCO, in the pre-failure days....the flex tube from the grain
auger lift, down to the tun, was often just left in the top port of the tun,
used for only the purpose of grain dough in.....
        Of course, water vapor from the tun, over the 90 minutes of mashing
employed in those days would rise into the flex tube, and up to the head of
the augur......where it would meet the flour of milling.......
        One day, I started to mash-in, and cranked up the mill....while it was
operating, and before I could 1) get the first bag of grain to the hopper,

Kevin Brown says regarding a bag of malt:
I opened it this past weekend and found out the mold was also on the inside
of the bag.
When I transfered the malt to 5 gallon buckets for storage I noticed the
malt on the perimeter of the bag also had mold on it. My first thought was
just to throw it all out. Then I thought maybe it can be washed off before
crushing, however I really don't want to to spend a brew day making bad
beer from bad ingredients. Does anyone have experience with malt that has
had some mold on it? TIA


Here is my 2 cents:
Some molds which grow on corn, peanuts, barley and malt produce a toxin
called aflatoxin. Aflatoxin is a mycotoxin from some strains of Aspergillus
flavus and most strains of A. parasiticus.  Aspergillus has  a dark color
and is flourecent under UV light.  I have no idea what A. parasiticus looks
like.  Aflatoxin is one of the most carcinogenic substances yet discovered,
and is thought to be able to cause liver cancer in amounts in the parts per
billion range.   And, it is likely to make beer which has a moldy flavor.
Yuck.   The malt in the middle of the bag may be ok, but for $35 a bag, I
would get some new malt.

Nope.  But I only used flakes a few times, then switched to coarse corn
meal and a cereal mash for all of the rest.  For the same mash regime, they
seemed to be the same - about 67 - 70% apparent attenuation for
40/60/70/76C.  I have switched to 65/70/76 for my last two all malt lagers
and got 75% aa, and I plan to use 40/55 (immediately add cereal
mash)->65/70/76C for my next CAP.  But, I'm also going to use rice (just to
see how it performs), changing two variables in midstream, so there won't
be much useful data on this.


There is historic reference (Wahl and Henius) for using higher mash temps
for lower aa and less alcohol.  This time I'm looking for a little crisper,
drier beer.  Of course, that means more alcohol for the same OG.

In my CAP update in HBD 2939, I left out:


Water - Low sulfate water is important for a clean bitterness.  If you need
to add Ca++, use CaCl2, not gypsum (CaSO4), which can give a lingering
harshness to the bitterness.  I've used deionized water with 1 tsp.
CaCl2.2H2O/5 gallons, but usually boil my temporarily hard well water,
decant, then add CaCl2.2H2O.


Of course, 100+ years ago, brewers probably used the water they had, but
some water was know to make better beer than others.  I suspect that water
affected the bittering levels used.  Low sulfate water encouraged higher
hopping levels, while high sulfate kept hopping low to avoid harshness.

One good thing about racking once more is that you can bottle with a lot
less yeast carryover.  When I bottled, I would fine with gelatin in the
secondary, which gave me nearly crystal clear beer (usually ales) over a
firm yeast sediment.  I managed to have no more yeast in the bottle than
the thickness of a coat of paint.  Aesthetically pleasing.  Gives a clear
glass of beer with no careful decanting.

Subject: blowoff loss/head retention


collective homebrew conscience:


ian smith asked about how to prevent losing beer due to blowoff.  i use an
oversized carboy, 7 gallons, for primary fermentations, and there is plenty
of headspace to prevent any loss at all.  there has been an increase in my
beers' head retention and hop presence, both bitterness and flavor, since
i've been using this method (about the last 15 batches).  


the possible disadvantage is that the dirty krausen substances (break
material, hop residue, etc.) remain in the fermentor.  some sticks to the
sides, but most falls back into the beer.  this is true also for top
fermenting yeasts that floc to the top during the hop drive.  i'll bet if i
backed down to a six gallon fermentor, i could have most of the dirty
krausen stick to the top and sides, or get blown out, along with some of the
top fermenting yeast, if applicable, plus lose less beer and foam-positive
material than in a 5 gallon carboy.  unfortunately, i have 7 carboys
already, and another would be overkill, plus it would use up a beer bullet.


by the way, i have no formal education in brewing, only hands-on experience
for 7 years (about 80 all grain batches), along with reading a few texts and
the hbd for a few years.  the above info. is based on experience alone, i
have no journal articles or research papers to validate any of my advice,

If I were to attempt this I would make it simpler.
Ferment a real batch of beer in your 2nd fermenter.
Make a hose to connect the two gas 'in' posts.
Connect the kegs as the 2nd is fermenting and CO2
  is needed.
Drink from the first keg.
When first keg is empty and the 2nd is done fermenting,
  transfer and prime and start all over.
If your really lazy, clean first keg and make new batch, 
 and simply make the 2nd keg the first and visa versa.


It's really easy to make a gauge to check the pressure of
your kegs.  It even looks sorta like a tire pressure gauge.
Use a gas 'in' connector, a dial gauge that goes to 30 lb
 pressure, a couple of brass fittings and/or a
very short (3"-5") piece of hose and hose clamps.

Subject: Bottle Priming 


HBD'rs-


Gregory asks about the necessity of the bottling bucket.  I have recently
retired my bottling bucket.  And not in favor of kegging (too many walking
hormones in the house):
My beers have been dinged recently in evaluations for oxidation.  I must
have a high tolerance for oxidation, as I can only pick it up in my beers
if they are light styles and 10+ months old.  At any rate, the only source
for oxidation in my process that I could find was racking to a bottling
bucket and bottling.  This is my solution:
I prepare about 10% more bottles than I think I'll need-  If I'm bottling
~5 gallons (~52 bottles) I'll prepare 57 bottles by dissolving the amount
of priming sugar needed for 57 bottles in 600 ml or so of water, and boil
it.  Then I take the volume of priming solution and divide it by the number
of bottles:
650 ml / 57 = 11.4ml/bottle.  Then using a syringe, I "innoculate" each
bottle with 11 ml of solution.
I think this solves a number of problems:  No transfer to a bottling bucket
(oxidation opportunity and an extra bucket to clean).  The end of the
bottling wand can be submerged below the surface of the priming solution,
eliminating that "gurgle, gurgle" when you start filling the bottle.  Also,
transferring straight from the secondary, the beer will be saturated with
CO2.  This CO2 should come out of solution in the bottle (instead of the
bottling bucket), allowing for some purging of the headspace.  I don't need
to know how much beer to prime (in the fermenter), I just prime extra
bottles, and rinse them out when I'm finished bottling.
I like bottling, too.  Lots of beer types "on tap", and I have a "thing"
about stacks and rows of things.  Bottles.  Deer Carcasses.  Cordwood. 
Dirty Three Packs.  Why- I almost joined The Royal Society For Putting
Things On Top Of Other Things.  If only they hadn't been disbanded for
being silly. 


Make no mistake-  I will someday keg.  Just so I can look at stacks of
kegs.

I'm the one who previously wrote Rob privately.  I rarely post to HBD but
try to read faithfully.  Didn't want to post off topic.  However, I am
interested in the history of beer and find the orgins of beer in the
middleast fascinating.  I even believe that brewing might be used to trace
the movement of ancient peoples and/or cultural influence from the fertile
crescent into central asia and across northern Europe to the Germany and the
British Iles.


Anyway, I had previously posted privately to Rob concerning his 'Jesus and
Beer' post:


>I have an interest in beer in the Bible.  In Hebrew and therefore also in
Aramaic (closely related language) the word for beer was "shekar"--usually
translated "storng drink" in KJ Bible.  This word comes over into Greek as
"sikera"; wine is "oinous".  Although one or more of the gospels may have
had an Aramaic form or oral tradition before being translated or rewritten
into Greek, we have none of these surviving today.  The gospel of John is
the only one that mentions the wedding at Cana.  There is a fragment of this
gospel in Greek from before 70 AD.  So, any Aramaic original had to be very
early indeed. 


I have no doubt that beer was common and drunk very widely in Jesus' time
and before (see Deut. 14:26--from maybe 1450 BC--where Israelites were
instruted to purchase and drink wine and beer).  I do not doubt that Jesus
drunk beer (and alcoholic beer too, no doubt!).  There were early
translations of the Greek gospels into a form of Aramaic.  I have not
studied these.  If these used or substituted the word "shekar" for the
substance produced by Jesus in Cana, that would indeed be interesting.>


Then again after another exchange:


>Thanks a lot for your response.  I looked again and found the article
<http://www.globalbeer.com/web/p2.html>.  Certainly not a scholarly article
or very accurate (ie. based on the bias that the New Testament was witten
and altered over a period of several centuries; which I believe very few
serious scholars would argue today).  However, it (this topic) is very
interesting.  As I said before, I have no doubt that beer was drunk in 1st
century Palastine.  In Luke 1, John the Baptist's father was instructed
before John was born that he was to eat neither drink "wine or strong
drink", not because Jews of that time were teetotalers, but because John was
to live under a special vow and set of rules.  Anyway, the word for "strong
drink" here is that Greek word "sikera", which was a translation of the
Hebrew word "shekar".  Shekar might be some alcoholic drink other than
fermented grape juice--cider, mead, etc--but very likely it was a fermented
grain beverage.  Shekar is the word for beer in Israel today.


Wasn't trying to pick on you.  I always enjoy your reports and will continue
to read with great interest.  Nor was I offended in any way by this post.
Just like to check out the source of such information.  There was truth
there in that beer was a common drink in 1st century Middle East (most
people don't know that) but there was some confusing and incorrect data too.
Guess I'll have to run down what Michael Jackson says about this.>


Let me add now:  My research seems to indicate that barley may have been the
first cultivated grain in the middle east (fertile crescent and Egypt) and
that it was used to make a fermented beverage very early in history.  I
think it could be argued that beer was fermented before bread was baked or
that the two went hand in hand.  Some have suggested that civilization
itself may even be one of the benefits of the development of brewing.  A
settled non-nomadic lifestyle was necessary for the cultivation of grain and
brewing of larger quantities of beer.  A thirst for beer may have been one
of the powerful motivating factors towards the development of cities.

GFCI detects an unbalanced current flow between the hot and neutral line.
If there is more than (I think) 10 mA difference the circuit is
disconnected.  The device assumes that the current has found a different
path to ground.  There could be many reasons for this different path to
ground, one of which is thru your body.  The GFCI protects humans against
electrocution.


The circuit breaker is a device that detects excessive current flow in the
hot side of the circuit.  Circuit breakers are selected based upon the
current carrying ability of the wire they are connected to, and the wire
size is based upon the maximum current drawn by the load.  The circuit
breaker protects against electrical overheating and fire.


If you happened to be holding onto a electrical device that was not on a
GFCI and the current found a better path to ground thru you, you would
most likely be DEAD.  The circuit breaker will not protect you because
by the time the 20A (or whatever size) breaker detects an over current
condition, smoke has long been rolling out your eyeballs.  Yep, your
eyes will explode right out of their sockets.  Your eyes are basically
water in a sealed container.  Get then heated (that's one of the products
of passing current thru a your body which is basically a big resistor)
even by a little bit and the pressure on the eyeball increases dramatically
according to PV=nrT.  I digress, the things you can learn in an
industrial safety class.  Electricity really is take way too lightly by
way too many people.


About your water heater example.  The heater coil is constructed in such
a way that the part that touches the water is ground (equipment ground) and
the inner portion (heat producing part) carries the load.  Also the tank
is connected to the equipment ground and unless there are no copper pipes
in you house, they too are connected to ground (usually earth ground).
If there is a failure in the heater coil, the hot line will be connected to
ground (equipment or earth).  This is basically a short circuit.  A short
circuit draws a large amount of current and the breaker trips in short
order.  At no time is the current presented with the opportunity to take
a path to ground other than its design path or a short circuit, the water
can not become electrically hot.


This is the way I understand it.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  I'd rather be
ultra SAFE than ultra DEAD.

I have been using such a keg for a boiler for many years.  Even though
I have a welder, I have never gotten around to patching the bung hole
on the side.  I simply got a solid rubber stopper from my local brew
shop and popped it in the hole.  A couple of light taps with a hammer
and it hasn't moved in over 5 years.  After the first couple of
batches I would tap it out for cleaning, but now just scrub around it
with a brush after the boil.  


You could even use a drilled stopper if you wanted to insert a
thermometer etc.

Subject: Re: Keg sanitation


Rick Georgette in HBD #2941 asks if he should be concerned
about sanitizing the quick disconnects and associated fittings on
kegs.


While I have not performed any microbiological studies on my fittings,
I consider that the risk of infection is minimal.


However, I have found that a quick squirt of isopropyl alcohol (70%)
should not only kill any nasties, but it also acts as a lubricant
allowing them to slip on smoothly.  


Prior to this I was going through 'O' rings at an alarming rate as
they are very stiff at fridge temps, and were easilly damaged.
