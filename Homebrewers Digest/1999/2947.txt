Subject: Astringency


I'm still a good three weeks behind in reading HBD, but I'm working on
it.  Sorry about this being so tardy:


Dan writes:

I think we may have a problem here with what we call certain mouth sensations.
"Astringency" is not something you get from dark grains.  I refer to these
flavours as "sharpness."  Astringency is due to polyphenols (called "tannins"
in layman's terms).  Polyphenol extraction from grains is increased by
temperature and overcrushing, but the main factor influencing polyphenol
extraction is *pH*.  As the pH increases, so does polyphenol extraction.


Ironically, dark malts and grains (like roasted barley, rye and wheat)
are acidic and therefore *decrease* pH in the mash.  Therefore, adding
the dark grains in the beginning of the mash will actually *decrease*
polyphenol extraction and therefore *decrease* astringency.


So, that brings us back to my initial point: namely that it seems Dan
feels that adding the dark grains/malts at the beginning of the mash
increases the "sharpness" (using my term), but that I feel that referring
to this sensation as "astringency" is not correct.


In trying to teach judges the sensation of astringency, I have had them
chew just the skins from about a half-dozen grapes (all at once).  I've
also done this personally, side-by-side with Black Patent malt.  There
were some non-flavour sensations from the Black Patent malt, but they
were clearly distinct from the sensations from the grape skins.

i'll be brief, since i know i won't be the only one to respond:


pete c. proposed a hypothesis that fermenting beer in a carboy is
continually in contact with as much oxygen as is contained in the air we
breathe.  his analysis disregards the relatively huge volume of carbon
dioxide that constantly evolves from the liquid and dilutes/displaces the
gases in the headspace of the carboy.  i'm sure others will provide far more

Dave, I second the advice someone else gave, check your hydrometer
first. It should read 1.000 when placed in distilled water at 60F. Check
your thermometer as well.


Assuming your equipment is OK, the other thing I noticed is that your
grainbill contains a lot of malt that will produce unfermentable sugars.
You've got 785g (~1.75# for the metrically impaired) of various types of
crystal malt, plus 115g of Breiss carapils, aka *dextrin* malt. Don't
know if you've made this particular recipe before, but with the mash
temps you used and the amount of yeast you've pitched, I tend to think
it's done at 1.025 rather than stuck. You may want to tweak this
grainbill for future batches.


Cheers,
Jim

Subject: spruce, breakfast oatmeal




I don't want to chime in with a "me, too!" on a thread, but I just wanted
to emphasize the fact that spruce essence is powerful!  We brewed an
all-grain spruce beer about 2 years ago and since no one in New York
carries spruce tips (and I assumed that the Botanical Garden wouldn't be
pleased if I harvested tips from their spruces), we used 1 teaspoon of
spruce essence in the bottling bucket to approx. 6 gallons of beer.  At the
time, we thought we were being cautious; instead, we were far too generous
(obvious moral of that brewing session:  test an extract before using it).
I *still* can't drink that beer because just the aroma is enough to knock
me out (and it's mellowed alot).  It's got a huge eucalyptus profile and
seems like it might clear up any nasal congestion (and maybe even clean the
stove top after brewing).  It's always fun to break out a bottle of that at
homebrew meetings, though...




For a quick breakfast malt fix, I use malt extract to sweeten my oatmeal.
Health food shops sell resealable jars of it, so you don't have to deal
with a big can from the homebrew shop.  It's also tasty in coffee, tea, and
on ice cream.

Subject: Spruce beer


<<I'll take a shot at this one.  Around here, spruce tip homebrews are quite
common.  In fact, the Skagway Brewing Company produces a commercial version
that is very popular.  For those who don't live in evergreen country, spruce
tips are the new growth that occurs on the end of the tree branch in the
Spring.  When they first come out, they kind of resemble a hop cone.  The best
time to pick them is when they're 1"-2" long and still compact (before they
start to open up).  They also freeze well in zip lock bags. >>
<>


I have tried numerous attempts at a spruce beer with extract (made by others).
I have never cared for the results.  The flavor is always too intense and
sometimes mediciney.  I make an annual spruce beer using the new growth from
our blue spruce.  I use approximately 1 quart of spruce needles (new growth as
described above) for every 5 gallons of wort.  I also add them like hops, but
usually add 1/3 at 60 minutes, 1/3 at 30 and 1/3 at the end of the boil.  I
start out with a medium gravity brown ale recipe, but imagine that any lightly
hopped recipe would work.  This has worked very well for me and I am looking
forward to making this years batch.

Subject: PV=nRT




     There has been some recent discussion of the ideal gas law and its
     applicability to things other than ideal gases.  I hope this is not
     too far off topic for this august body...


     Prepare to page down.


     PV=nRT is the ideal gas law.  There is no ideal gas, as far as I know,
     although most gases at relatively low pressures and high temperatures
     can be well approximated by this relationship.  The equation is useful
     because of it's simplicity and there are many variations which can
     improve the model for gases which are not too far from ideal.


     *** QDA ***
     Air, pure oxygen, pure nitrogen and many common gases with cryogenic
     boiling points are well approximated as ideal gases at typical ambient
     conditions.  I'm pretty sure freon type refrigerants are non ideal,
     especially at working conditions.  I think that CO2 and helium are not
     very ideal.  I can't recall if halogens (chlorine, fluorine, iodine)
     behave like ideal gases or not.  I hope you don't have much of them in
     your brewery.  I don't have references handy and I haven't worked with
     inert gases in a while.
     *** End QDA ***


     It does not apply to saturated vapors like steam (that is not
     superheated).  When vapor and liquid co-exist, lnP=m/T + b is the
     relationship that defines vapor pressure.  Density (the n/V part) is
     not likely to behave much like an ideal gas.


     And mixtures of gases and vapors are a whole other kettle of hops.


     The AGA and others have more complex models for describing vapors and
     gases for those who need to know.


     And liquids and solids are essentially non-compressible, so pressure
     has essentially no impact on either density or temperature.  However,
     temperature and density are related.  Sometimes even these
     relationships can be complex.  Solids that have more than one solid
     phase or crystalline form, for example, can have very complex
     relationships.


     So please don't be surprised if PV=nRT does not apply to table salt or
     table sugar or DME or crushed malt or wort or.....

Subject: plastic and copper


It's been on my mind- brewing in HDPE plastic buckets?  I've seen the 
mashers but not heard of boiling in plastic til lately on in this group.
Sounds strange yet intriguing.  Would plastic outgassing affect the beer (or
the person)?   My bigger concern is using the immersion heater with this
setup.  Wouldn't a basic water heater element leach iron into the wort.
McMaster has copper sheathed ones, but they're $100.  Anyone have a source
of low cost copper sheathed immersion heaters?


Following the copper threads, I wonder if the Cu brewing tradition stems
from some antibacterial benefit.  I have no evidence, just a guess.  My
homemade Cu kettle is never scrubbed but always shines brighter just after a
brew.  This indicates to me that some etching has occurred.  I seriously
doubt it's harmful to me, but it probably keeps out some bateria.


Pressurized fermentation - I know yeast survive this if they were
depressurized slowly.  I've gone to 60 psi, then back to 0, and up again.
After the third time the yeast seemed more hesitant, but I think it was
because I expanded their bodies too fast.  I posted about attempting to
regulate beer from a keg for dispense without CO2.  Well, the problem I
found is that the extra volumes of gas must still get out.  So you get foam
even if you regulate it (just more slowly).  What's needed is a 2nd
container to hold the foam at final delivery pressure and wait for the foam
to settle.  As the 2nd container is tapped the cycle is continued, but the
volume of beer that settled out diminishes unless the excess gas is bled
off.  Perhaps you could install a float switch at the top of this vessel
(I'm thinking of a 1-2 liter soda bottle) in-line with a 5-10 psi check
valve.  When the liquid or foam reaches the top the bleeding would stop, but
it would also only bleed if the pressure was greater than the check valve.
Where can I get this float switch?  I know this becomes complicated and
bulky.

Subject: Oxidation at bottling


Fred Johnson writes doubting the importance of O2 inclusion during bottling.


Oxidation is a strange thing - it may have a sudden and obvious impact or
it's effects may develop slowly and subtly.


A few months ago I repeated the experiment in which bottles are filled to
various extents and the less filled bottles invariably reach higher
carbonation levels more quickly and overfilled bottles are invariable
undercarbonated.  I double flushed one set of samples with CO2 prior to
filling, and left another set with air in the headspace.  The difference in
carbonation levels between CO2 vs air in the headspace was negligible but
other differences were apparent.


The underfilled air-in-headspace beers had noticeably more yeast sediment
than their CO2 flushed equivalents, evident haze, and a bit more esters
(this was a marzen using WY2278). The yeast growth, haze and esters levels
can all be easily explained as a consequence of oxygen.  The biggest flavor
difference was that the nicely floral background hopping of tettnager and
hersbrucker was replaced in the air purged bottles by a less pleasant
bitterness.


Bottle conditioned beers are certainly much less susceptible to small
amounts of air than the filtered commercial beers, but air is still a
spoiler.  Bottle conditioning a couple bottles at 80% fill with air vs CO2
in the headspace should give you a pretty good idea of what you are up
against.

Patrick Finerty (#2944-3) asks about large brewpots at B3.  Jay 
Spies (#2946-30) says that the rep at B3 tells him they are of 
Italian manufacture and have a spigot welded in.  A few years back I 
bought a several of the 100 litre (~26 gal) SS brewpots (also of italian 
manufacture) from Hoptech (Std. Discl.) for about $215 US.  At that 
time they were also selling 50 litre pots of similar design.  These 
came with a spigot which srewed into a 1/2" NPT female half coupling 
which is welded into the bottom of the kettle.  I have been very 
pleased with them.  I tossed the spigot on the brew kettles and replaced 
it with a drilled out 3/8" compression fitting.  A length of 3/8" tubing 
goes through the wall into a 3/8" compression "T" and then into a slotted 
manifold which runs around the perimeter of the bottom of the kettle. 
At the time when I was shopping around for these there were several 
sites on the web selling what appeared to be the same style of pots. 
I just took a quick peek at the Hotech site and they do still sell 
both sizes. The 50 litre is $160.  I hope this is useful.

I was concerned about this very issue back in Nov 1997 and found the
diffusivity constants and did the calculations - presented in HBD 2549 ...

Everything you wrote was fine except you didn't realize how very long it
would take for get an appreciable amount of oxygen to diffuse back through
your bubbler.  Neither did I till '97.

I have heard mention of no-sparge brewing. Could someone explain this to me?
My basic idea is that you mash with lots and lots of water, then drain into
brew kettle. Also, I have seen first wort hopping. Have many on this digest
used this? What are the benefits?

Subject: Is the Schmidling mill as good as a 6 roller?


Hi folks,


Can someone here "in the know" please comment on the following?
It sounds to like "that's not a bug, it's a feature", but 
I don't really know anything about 6 roller mills.


thanks,
 -Alan


 One final point on adjustable mills is worth putting on the
 table.  It is frequently suggested that the one sided
 adjustability of the MM is a limitation when in fact, this
 is actually the key to the so called "text book crush".


 If you look at the oft published drawing of a six roller
 mill, you will note that the roller spacings are about
 .050", .030" and .012" from top to bottom.  It just so
 happens that, when an adjustable MM is set to near contact
 at the adjustable end, one gets those same numbers at the
 fixed end, center and adjustable end respectively.   The end
 rusult is that the random distrubution of grain across the
 length of the rollers provides about the same grist
 distribution as a six roll mill.

Just use 2 coils.  I don't see where there is a problem here.
I tried 15' of 3/8", but that wasn't long enough to cool really
well.  I suppose it would be good for a british style ale, though.
I had to move to 25' to get the chilling I wanted.

Your 13-15% limit is probably a little low, but right under most
circumstances.  Wines can regularly reach this level (provided the juice
had enough sugar).  Twenty-five years ago I had a white wine (very ripe
Aurora [Seibel 5279] grapes) that started at 28 deg. Brix and fermented out
completely dry (per Clinit*st) using some dry yeast of .  I think that
figures to nearly 17% alcohol!  (_American Wines and Wine-Making_, Wagner,
p.124)  I had hoped to stop the fermentation at 12% alcohol for an
auslese-style wine, but it wouldn't stop, even at refrigerator temps.  I
was amazed.  It was a very out of balance wine.  I didn't know about
sorbate then, which would have stopped it.


Port is made from partially fermented grape juice to which is added brandy
to raise the alcohol to ~20% and arrest further fermentation, thereby
leaving a good bit of residual sugar.  The yeast never gets a chance to
ferment at very high levels.


As you surmised, yeast simply poops out beyond a certain level of alcohol.

Just to explain my reasoning-- HOCl is indeed desireable and I don't
argue that, but
maybe I should have been a bit more clear when I said that we don't want
almost all
of the -OCl converted over to HOCl (as would happen at lower pH's).


Although the mechanism of HOCl as a biocide is not really well
understood, it is
clear that a few molecules do the work on one biological cell.  Think of
a huge
battleship being disabled by a few mines.  If you put all of the mines
in one place,
you blast the living daylights out of the battleship, but now there are
no more
mines and the rest of the armada cruises through.


A slower release gives the HOCl more of a search and destroy in waves--
cells are
deactivated, then more HOCl is generated and more cells are
deactivated.  The
mechanism of the biocidal activity is more complicated that simply
coming into
contact with organic material and both the HOCl and the organic molecule
end their
existence in their current form (kind of like some battleship wreckage
exploding a
mine-- it does no good, but there's a big bang).

Time is relative.  At 120F, 50 ppm chlorine will give you a 99.9% kill
in 15-20
seconds.  At 60F it's more like a minute (QDA-- don't have a reference
book handy, but I have been working with this stuff for the past 10
years).  If you acidify your bleach the times don't change that much,
because you're still waiting for contact to occur between
the organisms and and the chlorine-- the biggest limiting factor is the
random
motion of both through the water as they must meet before anything gets
killed.  If
you have twice as much HOCl in the water, the meeting will occur more
quickly, but
you're only saving around 15 seconds at room temp.  (Incidentally, you
get a faster kill at
higher temps because the Brownian motion, or random travelling, is
happening much
faster; temperature is really only a measurement of how quickly
particles are moving
within a medium.)


Hope this helps,

Subject: N2 and bubbles...


(Hi Dave)


Just read Dave Sapsis <DAVE_SAPSIS`at`fire.ca.gov>'s post to the HBD
responding to my question....about the feasibility of making a
Guinness-like head by using an airstone blowing nitrogen in a glass of beer.


I was going to ask a follow-up question directly to Dave, but as I was
typing it occured to me that others might be interested in what makes a
bubble a bubble.


Please understand that I don't really know anything about bubbles :-) just
have impressions and have no reservations about showing my ignorance by
asking!


In my mind I see a bubble as spherical liquid surface containing gas that
may pass through through the bubble's surface at some rate. One gas may
cause the bubble to shrink or break faster than another, for whatever
reason. Shrinking or breaking may be the reason foam dissappears, I don't
really know. 


Anyway, somewhere I got the idea that a bubble with nigrogen as the gas
inside would last longer than a bubble with CO2 or air inside. At least on
average. Is this true?


I did not know that the widget contained both beer and high pressure N2. In
my mind it was just filled with high pressure N2. Is the foam that
develops, when the widget is activated,  simply bubbles filled with co2
driven out of the beer in the can, by the shear forces resulting from the
rapid forcing of beer, within the widget, out as a high velocity stream?  I
know the widget-induced foam is quite different from the foam that comes
out of a non-widget can. What is the quality that makes this foam
different? I had attributed it to being bubbles filled with nigrogen...goes
to show what I know!


If an airstone were used in a glass, would the bubbles formed be filled
with n2? Seems like they should be. It was not clear to me from Dave's post
how a n2-filled bubble would compare to a co2-filled bubble. If we had a
glass of n2-bubble foam beside a glass of co2-bubble foam, which would last
longer? I would have guessed the n2-bubble foam would be more stable, but
only from impressions gained reading the HBD over the last years. I have no
experience with n2 at all.


I guess the real question my mind is driving at is: Could a head built by
an airstone bubbling n2 through beer end up being superior to the one
provided by a Guinness tap? Could it be equal? Would it be inferior? Would
it even develop?


AT this point I don't know the theory, and the only way for me to get the
answer is to put out $50 or so for a n2 cylinder, which I would rather
avoid at this point if theory says I should wait for nitrogenated beer
until I get the proper tap as well.

Subject: Oxygenation of finished beer / yeast autolysis


     Hi all,
     
     Several people are questioning the importance of aeration of the 
     finished beer, especially for bottle conditioned product.  They reason 
     that the yeast will consume the oxygen and therefore protect the beer. 
      (One person stated that they were reluctant to question me; please 
     don't be like that!  I am far from infallible and like being 
     questioned.  It forces me to look up stuff to support my statements, 
     thus helping to solidify my knowledge.)
     
     Yeast as antioxidants:  as anybody who has been reading this digest 
     for a while knows, yeast do not respire in wort.  Search the archives 
     for more info about this.  Yeast do consume oxygen to synthesize 
     sterols, though, so why won't they be great antioxidants?
     
     Yeast will take up some oxygen at bottling time, but not all of it. 
     Reasons for this could be that the pressure in the bottle slows the 
     yeast down.  Pressure is a well-known inhibitor of yeast growth, so 
     some O2 will remain.  Louis Bonham tested some bottle conditioned beer 
     that I sent him a while back for both CO2 content and headspace air.  
     Unfortunately, I can't find the data!  Perhaps Louis can find a moment 
     to jump in?  Maybe George Fix has some data about O2 levels in
     bottle conditioned beer?  I seem to recall reading somewhere that the 
     yeast only consume about 30% of the headspace O2, but don't remember 
     where I read this.  That's useful, huh?
     
     The oxidation of the finished beer can happen quickly if the beer is 
     relatively warm.  Cold beer will not oxidize as quickly, but it will 
     allow O2 to dissolve in it more readily, and the yeast will not be as 
     active.  Either situation seems grim.
     
     After all this, *you must remember what I said in my last post* (Alan 
     M. seems to have missed this point, accusing me of blindly applying 
     mega-brewer procedures to my homebrewing):  if you store your homebrew 
     cold and drink it within a month or two, it is likely to be fine (if 
     you are not going out of your way to aerate the beer).  George Fix's 
     data (from Brewing Techniques 6.6) demonstrates that beer with 2.0 mL 
     of headspace air will not start to noticeably stale until it is 70 
     (seventy) days old, if stored at 43F (6C).  On the other hand, if you 
     store it at 86F (30C) it will be rotten in 5 (five) days.  Quite a 
     difference!
     
     That is why commercial brewers are so concerned with cold-side 
     aeration.  They have little control over what is happening to their 
     beer once it hits the road.  Even beer with only 0.5 mL of headspace 
     air will taste stale in as little as 60 days if stored at 30C.  
     Lighter beers tend to show off these flavors more prominently
     than fuller beers.
     
     60 days really isn't too long for your average craft beer or import.  
     The high prices and (sometimes) long ocean voyages mean that the beer 
     may be far from young when it finds itself in your glass.   Many small 
     breweries in both the US and other countries have less than ideal 
     bottling lines, and therefore have the potential for more O2 pickup 
     than beer bottled at a well financed establishment.
     
     As far as oxygen being desirable at bottling time to help the yeast 
     grow and ferment the primings:  I strongly disagree!  You don't want 
     yeast growth at that late stage in the brewing process.  You want a 
     population of healthy, happy yeast that are able to quickly ferment 
     the primings before the pressure knocks them out.  This is best 
     achieved by adding a fresh dose of yeast at bottling time.
     
     In summary, if you find that your beer is losing its malt character or 
     picking up oxidative off-flavors (metal, sherry, etc.), perhaps you 
     should be a little more careful about O2 pickup in your brewery.  If 
     you find that your beer holds up fine in the time that it
     takes you to consume it, then there is probably no need to get 
     paranoid about oxygen.
     
     I encourage all of those interested in beer oxidation to read the 
     aforementioned Fix article and Scott Bickham's Focus on Flavor article 
     (I think it is also in BT 6.6).

     A quick note about yeast autolysis:  somebody a few issues back 
     (sorry, I can't remember the name of the poster) said that yeast 
     autolysis is not much of a threat to homebrew, even if it is kept in 
     the primary for a few weeks while you wait for a slow fermentation to 
     finish.
     
     This is far from the truth.  I have ruined more than enough batches by 
     keeping them in the primary for 2-3 weeks (even if there was residual 
     sugar to ferment).  Certain yeast strains are more prone to autolysis 
     than others, but very few ale yeasts do well after 3 weeks in the 
     primary.  Lager yeasts can be a bit more forgiving, at least in part 
     because of the cool temperature the beer ferments at.
     
     Yeast autolysis is recognized by a meaty, yeasty, rubbery, 
     aroma/flavor.  In my experience, few judges actually recognize this 
     flaw for what it is, often saying that the beer seems infected (I have
     entered autolyzed beer in several competitions just for kicks).  Even 
     though they often cannot identify the source of the off character, one 
     thing is agreed upon:  it is not pleasant!
     
     Even if your fermentation is sluggish and there is residual sugar, the 
     yeast that flocced early and are buried at the bottom of the fermenter 
     aren't seeing it.  They are dying.  You don't want them in your beer.  
     Simply shaking the carboy does not "deflocc" all the yeast.  Try
     this at home:  shake the carboy and take a look at it in 5 minutes.  A 
     lot of yeast will have settled quite quickly.  It is not actively 
     fermenting.
     
     If your fermentation is slow or stuck, it is better to rack the 
     semi-fermented beer out of the primary and add a dose of fresh yeast 
     to get things going again then to simply leave it on the spent primary 
     yeast.
     
     Have fun!

Well, I'm a brewing wife.  My husband doesn't like beer and never has,
although he does say that the best beer he's ever tasted has been beer that
I've made.  I have tons of support from him ("Honey, I can't get the lid
off my plastic fermenter, could you do it?").  In the short time I've been
brewing, he's only complained about it once, and that was because the stove
was full of brewing stuff and he didn't have a place to fix his dinner.  He
doesn't even mind when I have some of my brewing buddies over to the house
to watch football or hockey and drink beer.

Disorganization is merely the sign of a very healthy individual
trying to do more in a shorter period of time than those lazy, obsessively
tidy types who can think of nothing better to do than straighten objects in
drawers and stuff like that which only feeds on their own egos and makes
them think they're better than those of us who are truly gifted.

Fellow brewers,


I was interviewed by a newspaper reporter (Becky Billingsley) last summer
for an article that ran in the Myrtle Beach (SC) Sun Times.  It was about
home brewing, and I was the "expert" she quoted on home brewing and judging.
I actually judged some beers brewed by other people in her article.  She
recorded my comments and "scores".  It ended up being a half-decent article
and features yours truly fairly prominently.  The reason I bring this up now
is that she notified me that it was picked up by the national AP wire this
week.  I'd be curious knowing where else it gets published.  If any of you
happen to see it in your local papers, I'd appreciate a brief note.


TIA,
