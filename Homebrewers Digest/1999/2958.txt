Subject: Skewed mills / Yeast Autolysis


     Hi all,
     
     Jack Schmidling writes, in response to my post about 6-roller mills vs. 
     skewed roller mills:
     
     "There is also no way they [the pieces of malt] can be obliterated
     if the close spacing is not less than the closest spacing on a 
     multiroller mill."
     
     
     Yes, there is.  The concept is really quite simple:  The closest 
     rollers on a 6-roller mill are not meant to crush intact kernels.  They 
     are meant to crush the small bits of endosperm that were formed when 
     the grain passed through the first two sets of rollers.  The spacing 
     between the last rollers on a 6 roller mill is typically set at 
     0.3-0.35 mm.  The diameter of your average piece of barley malt is 
     2.2-2.3 mm.  Please explain how you hope to squeeze a 2.2 mm piece of 
     malt through a 0.35 mm gap without obliterating it.
     -----------------------------------
     Several people have asked:
     
     "How is storage on the cake of yeast in the primary any different than 
     storage on the cake in the secondary or in the bottle? And if yeast 
     autolysis is such a problem, how can one produce a decent 
     bottle-conditioned beer, such as a barleywine or any other big beer, 
     that is supposed to REQUIRE some aging to produce its characteristic 
     flavors?"
     
     
     Storage of beer on the primary yeast is vastly different to storing the 
     beer on secondary or bottled yeast.  The major difference, and the one 
     that most concerns us, is that there are orders of magnitude less yeast 
     in the secondary or bottle than in the primary.
     
     I have never had a beer develop autolyzed flavors from contact with 
     secondary or bottled yeast.  Some of the other, more subtle 
     characteristics of yeast autolysis can become noticeable in time (like 
     reduction of head retention, thinning of body, rise in pH), but the 
     autolyzed flavor found in beer that has spent too long in the primary 
     is unique to that situation (in my experience).
     
     Have fun!

Mark Riley Writes:


I've made several ales and lagers
without using a protien rest and have found that these very
same beers have a stubborn chill haze that won't go away
with "lagering".  


I say:


Hmmm funny you should mention this topic. I have been eliminating
my protein rest lately to see if it made a difference. Well, I am 
experiencing the same said chill haze problems for the first time
ever in my brewing. Lagering seems to get rid of it most of the time 
but not completely. 


Mark Riley Writes:


Now, supposedly the pros say that a
protien rest is "unnecessary with  todays malts" but do
these same pros not care about chill haze because they're
all filtering their beers and this is a non-issue for them?




I say:


I have talked to several pros about it and they filter... Therefore 
they have no problem.


I am also experiencing better head (lord knows we all need that ;) ) 
on my beers but it isn't as lasting as when I do a 134 rest.


I am using many of the same malts that Mark has mentioned as well 
as Briess Pale Ale 2 row.

Subject: Mash question


I am trying really hard to make that jump to all-grain brewing.  In
preparation, I have been doing partial mashes of about 5 lbs.  My lautering
/ sparging seems to take forever (1.5-2 hours).  I try not to grind too
finely.  I put some water in the bottom of my bucket.  I am using a small
bucket with a plastic Listermann false bottom.  I try to lauter very slowly
and keep a little fresh sparge water on top at all times.  I end up
stirring it and blowing through the drain tube to get stuff moving.  I mean
it moves at less than a trickle.  I have done about 4 of these batches, and
every one is the same.  If lautering is this hard, I am not sure I want to
try to lauter 7-10 lbs.  Can anyone describe for me how thick the mash
should be?  I have heard "like runny oatmeal".  Any other terms out there
that leave less open for interpretation?  I prefer to go by feel rather
than having to pre-measure my mash water.  Any help is appreciated.

Nobody responded to this post so I guess I'll take it as my responsibility to
answer on this subject ;-).  I researched and wrote on this subject a couple
of years ago when I purchased my Superb burner and converted it to natural
gas.  I should remember the digest number of the original and subsequent posts
or at least save a copy of the text but alas...  


To convert the propane gas orifice to use natural gas you need to first,
unscrew the gas valve out of the burner.  Next, remove the orifice from the
end of the valve (screws out as well).  Then, drill out the orifice opening
from its existing size #52 wire drill = .0635" (approximately 1/16" depending
on how exact you want to be) to a #35 wire drill = .110" (approximately
7/64").  Then reassemble the burner and enjoy.  


I purchased a second gas valve and orifice so I could easily use both gas
sources as well but the second gas valve wouldn't fit in the burner (It wasn't
tapered as much as the original).  So if you plan on this route, take the
burner with you and try it before you buy the valve.  The extra valve is not
really necessary because it is really no extra work to just change the
orifice.  BTW, I've never used propane so I don't have any info on which works
better.  


I got the opening sizes from a local bottle gas supplier where I purchased the
burner, valve and orifice, gas line, etc. and they work GREAT for me.  As
always, YMMV.  


Good luck and Cheers!

Subject: CFC - the range of "k"


In a recent post made the assertion that the equations I presented 
for counterflow chiller design were valid ....... as long as k does 
not vary too much as the other quantities (most notably flow rate) 
are varied.  


AJ Delange commented in response.
>In fact the flow rates have a marked effect on the rate of transfer.


I guess one man's "not too much" may be another man's "marked 
effect", so let me be a bit more explicit.  


I have tested my chiller over a fairly wide range of values for the 
flow rates of wort and cooling water and determined the values of the 
effective value of the heat transfer coefficient "k ".  Here are the 
extreme cases:


When running the chiller with wort flowing at .25 gpm and coolant 
running at 1.0 gpm. I get a value for k of 1.8 W/mK.  I have to tell 
you it was not easy to throttle the chiller to this extent and I can't 
imagine why I would ever want to run like this.
When running the chiller with wort running at 2.0 gpm and coolant 
running at 5.0 gpm  I get a value for k of 4.5 W/mK.


In summary increasing the wort flow rate by a factor of 8 and the 
coolant flow rate by a factor of 5 the value of k changed by a factor 
of 2.5.  I believe that the impact of changing both flow rates should 
be multiplicative so we are really looking at k changing by 2.5x 
when the overall effect of the flow rate changes is a factor of 40x.  
That is what I mean when I say that k does not change a lot as 
the flow rates are changed. 


For the range within which I might actually want to run the chiller, 
k varies from a low of about 3.5 up to a high of about 4.5. 


I would suggest that a person wishing to design a chiller similar to 
mine operated under similar conditions use a k value in the range of 
4.0 W/mK to 3.0 W/mK to be on the safe side.  If you expect to run 
wort through at 1.0 to .5 gpm a k value in the range of 3.0 W/mK 
to 2.0 W/mK might be appropriate.  If you go much below this you 
should consider using k values in the range of 2.0 W/mK to 
1.0 W/mK.  I hope that this clears up any confusion caused by my
earlier comment:


>I suggest using my empirical value of k = 4.5 W/mK as a starting 
>point.  If you expect to run your system a lot slower  you should 
>probably reduce this value.   


In closing I would like to make two further comments in defense of 
the method of chiller design I have outlined.  I belive it is a valid 
approach because:
1)  I have a chiller designed using this method which performs pretty 
close to design specifications
2)  The equations have the mathematical format predicted by 
Chalkie my bookie.!:^)

Subject: Checking some "facts"


Greetings,


I'm currently having an argument with a fellow in the on-line
German forum at http://www.bier-selbstgebraut.de/wwwforum/index.html


We both agree that going over 78C/168F in  your sparge is a bad
thing.  But he says it's because over this temperature, you denature
your enzymes, and since they are made out of protein (which they
are), you therefore get hazey beer.  He says that by no means do
you want to have denatured enzymes for your sparge.  And it gets
even crazier, because he says that this also gives you lower
extraction (Ausbeute - pretty sure I understand that term right)


I've never heard of this before.  At first I was cautious because
they do things so differently over there that I'm always careful
not to step on toes out of my own ignorance of their procedures.
But this just sounds silly to me.


First of all, enzymes are denatures just over 160F, as I 
understand.  Secondly, my understanding was that mashout was
specifically to denature enzymes.  And then the bit with the lower
extraction seems to me to be just way out in left field.  I mean,
I've seen in my own experiments how mashout gives me significantly
better extraction.


Can anyone shed any light here?  Is this guy crazy, or is there
some crucial piece of the puzzle which escapes me?


thanks,
 -Alan

I have been reading Pierre Rajouett's (sp) Belgian Ale Style book and came
across the recipe for Biere de Table. This is a brew that starts with and OG
of 1.016-20.


Has anyone brewed anything this low? It seems to be the mildest of the mild.
How do you get any flavor at that low OG? Decoction? Yeast strain?


If it can be brewed successfully I'd guess it would be a great breakfast,
noon, and night beer.

Hi everybody.
Couldn't get any whole coriander at the brewshop or "natural" foods store.
Found some ground coriander.  Very aromatic.  Not quite as fresh as
crushing my own.  Has anyone used commercially ground coriander in a wit
beer?  How much should I use?  I think I would actually use a little less
than when I used whole...fresh crushed...because of the greater surface
area and such.  Comments?  Suggestions?  TIA

Someone mentioned making a barly wine for 2000.  It has my interest.  To 
make a BW with starting gravity of 2.000 would require 25 # DME for 1 
gallon, wonder what yeast you would use?  But you could make one with 
starting gravity of 1.200 which would be about 25# DME or 20# pale malt 
and 11-12 # of DME.  Estimated alcohol (from SUDS) would also be about 
20%.  Again what yeast?  Would you need to pitch different yeasts, 
something at first to take the high sugar and then repitch later with 
someing that can take the high alcohol.  I understand that Sam Adams uses 
a process something along this line for their tripple.

     Hi Steve & Phil


     If you can throttle the outlet of the pump, you may achieve the same
     affect.  Smaller inlet plumbing means you will have to settle for
     reduced recirculation flowrate, but if that is acceptable, you could
     avoid the trouble of replumbing everything upstream of the pump.  It
     might be worth experimenting with, anyway.  Your flow control valve
     ought to be downstream from the pump, regardless.

Subject: non-distilled liqueurs


In HBD # 2956, "Matthew  Hahn" <mchahn`at`earthlink.net> asked for
information on non-distilled liqueurs.


When I was still in the BOP business, the brewing/wine supply
wholesalers that I dealt with carried two different brands, "Moonshine"
and "Contessa". Both brands claimed to have developed (several grains of
salt required here), some secret, super, high alcohol tolerant, yeast. 
However, both kits worked the same and were basically the fermentation
of a sugar and yeast nutrient solution. To achieve the claimed 20% ABV,
additional feedings of sugar were required over a period of days so as
not to subject the yeast to an initially high gravity. Once fermentation
was complete, the resulting alcoholic liquid was further adulterated by
the addition of a flavoured syrup, which supposedly made a liqueur in
the desired style.
We tried several flavours at the BOP and ended up dumping them all down
the drain as unfit for human consumption. 
Some people may enjoy them but, certainly not me nor any of my staff.
As always, YMMV.
Cheers,
Ross.

Publication of New Brewer ~28,000 copies $ 411,538


Then it costs over $14.69 to publish each copy of the New Brewer.
This compares to $2.20 per copy of Zymurgy.


Either the start up costs for the New Brewer are still being amortized, or I
want to be a paid writer at the New Brewer. I figure that the AHA could pay

Subject: decoction anyone ?


Ted McIrvine describes his decoction procedure ...


>For a triple decoction, I mash in around 130, decoct to 145 and 155, and
>then mash out at 165 on the third decoction.  I use a very thick

>(Mark Bayer's comments about this match my experience closely.)


You may want to consider a mash-in at 90-104F/35-40C instead of 130F/54C.
Unless you have particularly poorly malted grain (like homemade hard as
stone) you don't get any advantage from a 54C rest and *may* be killing your
foam head.  Nothing important happens at 100F except that the malt gets wet
and the enzymes&starch go off into solution.  This allows the enzymes to act
faster at 145F/63C.  Kunze and others suggest avoiding or at least carefully
controlling the 50C temp range as a head/body killer.


Aside from this one change I've got nothing at all against your specific
procedures Ted, in fact they parallel the way I initially decocted quite
closely.  Over time I've made some incremental improvements to the process
that save a lot of time yet still yield a comparable product.  Unless you
really enjoy cleaning up after a 9 hour brewing schedule you may want to
consider ....


The triple decoction 104F-D1-143F-D2-155F-D3-165F works well enough - but
undertanding what happens at each stage allows for simplification.


R1 - The first rest at 104 just allows enzymes and starch to get into
solution - little enzyme activity.


D1 - The first decoct step (to 143F) will gelatinize the grain fairly
completely and will release about 3%-5% extra starch over what you would
extract in an infusion mash using commercial malt.  The extra extract is
financially worth about 30 cents/5gal.


R2 - The second rest at 143F is primarily to allow both beta-and
alpha-amylase to act together.  The rest at 143F largely determines the
fermentability of the wort.


D2 - The second decoction does release some small amount of additional
starch, but primarily the second decoction is for flavor and temp boost.
Why flavor ?  After the 143F rest there are a lot of simple sugars present.
The simple sugars and amino acids (freed during the malting process) when
heated to around boiling create the flavorful maillard products and
melanoidins we seek.


R3 - The 155F rest is at a high enough temperature so that the beta-amylase
is denatured over a short period of time.  The alpha-amylase isn't entirely
stable at this temperature either, but it is much more stable that the
beta-A, and normal malt has about 25 times more alpha-amylase activity that
beta-amylase activity to begin with !!


D3 - this thin decoction boosts the temp to mashout temps, and denatures
nearly all of the amylase by boiling the thin mash.  More maillard flavor
products are formed.


R4 - a brief rest at mashout 165F.  In an infusion mash - the boost to
mashout reportedly coagulates enough protein to permit better runoff and so
higher extraction efficiency.  The explanation that the higher temp
decreases the viscosity of the wort and so permits better extraction doesn't
appear to be correct !  The change in viscosity from 155F to 165F is not a
big factor.  Why do we need this for decoction ?  More interesting I have
performed a lot of lauters around 70C(158F) and the loss in efficiency
(which may be lauter design dependent) is again worth about 30 cents/5gal.
Surprisingly a mashout temp of 168F/75C is not sufficient to quickly
denature the alpha-amylase.  It is however flirting with the problems of
phenol extraction.
- --
The above explanation of the process is certainly controversial in some
respects, and of course open to debate and disagreement, but there is
support in the lit for most if not all of it.  Add to the above some
practical facts and personal biases ...


The 30 cents/5gal saved in malt cost by additional extraction of starch in
decoction is not a worthwhile saving at the HB scale.


The time saved by solubilizing or hydrating the malt at a 104F mash-in saves
time at the 143 rest, but the saving is illusory since this is mostly
unattended mash time at a necessary rest temp.


The value of unfermentable carbohydrates in beer, those formed after the
boost from 143F, are of very dubious value with respect to body,mouthfeel
and foam/head properties.  (see my previous post for references).  Protein
is a much bigger issue for all of these.


==


My streamlined method is as follows:


R1- Mash-in for a strike at about 60C/140F, and allow enough time for a
nearlycomplete conversion and a few % extra malt.


D1 - Decoct for a boost to something around 160F.  This can be a thick or
thin decoction but at least half the liquid should be left out of the boil
in order to leave enough alpha-amylase behind.  The boil should take almost
as long as the combined boil times for a triple decoction - say 30+' for a
dark beer, and 15+' for a light one since this single decoction is the only
opportunity to create the maillard products.


R2 - rest at the 160F temp until you get a negative iodine.  Only then start
the recirculation.  Note that a negative iodine only means tha amylose
segments greater then G9 are missing.  Additional degradation is desirable
and occurs during the lauter and beyond.


The Pros:
   You get the maillard products you seek.
   Save 3+ hours during the mash.
   Prevent HSA damage by decreasing the amount of handling/decoction.


The Cons:
   Minor amount of extra malt is require ~$1.
   Your wort is highly fermentable and so won't make a good
       lenten nutritional beer nor refute Dave Burley's Clinitest
       assertions [kiddin' Dave, hope you can still laugh about
       it - but not on this forum, right ?]
  Dissonance theory says you will not appreciate this beer as
       much as a triple decoction for purely psychological reasons.
  It's not traditional, but then again you don't look so great in
       lederhosen anyway.
- --
Of course a canner/pressure cooking of the wort first runnings removes the
decoction entirely and yet preserves the maillard/melanoidin formation for
an even greater streamlining.
==


OK - now for my decoction question.  M&BS pp330, states that decoction
mashing rate is 3.3-5.0hl/100kg (1.58-2.4 qt/lb).  Kunze states pp 207, that
4-5 hl/100kg (1.92-2.4qt/lb)for pale beers and 3-3.5 hl/100kg
(1.47-1.67qt/lb) for dark beers and does not reference whether infusion or
decoction is meant.  A few pages later the pale figure is used in reference
to infusion.


These higher figures would imply something like 8lb of malt and 4.8gal(!!)
of mash water for a 12P pale lager batch.  Has anyone actually tried such
thin mashes ?

Having lived in such a location (Alaska) and knowing all about this

you'd still get some of it landing on the ground ... not as fun!  And of

I would conjecture that it is not just the loss in mass that helps here.  
In fact, I'd bet you a very flat yellow cowpie that the primary effect 
here is coming from the fact that much energy is being used up in the 
state change from the liquid state to the gaseous state.  Hot water 
evaporates really fast at cold temperatures and probably accounts for a 
substantial cooling of the liquid left behind, which in turn helps the 
stuff freeze quicker.

        Ames/Story County area homebrewers are invited to meet in an initial effort
to judge the feasibility of the creation of a local homebrewer's club.
        While it is known that the local Ames/Story County area  has many
homebrewers, it has been some years since there has been an association of
those brewers.
        This meeting is proposed in order to allow local brewers to meet and
interact with other area brewers, to expand the knowledge of local brewers,
to educate those interested in the craft of brewing, and to benefit both
brewers and the general  public with an increased understanding of fermented
malt beverages..
        During the initial meeting, should interest prove to be sufficient to
support the on-going assembly of a structured organization, discussion will
focus on a draft constitution, selection of a regular meeting time and
place, and any other such business that the attendees deem appropriate.
                The initial meeting will be at Lucullan's Italian Grill and Sport's Bar,
400 Main Street, Ames, on Tuesday, February 23rd at 7 p.m., in the Sport's
Bar.
