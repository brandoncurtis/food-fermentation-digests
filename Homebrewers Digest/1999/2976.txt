At the MCAB  I asked Chris White (owner
of White Labs Yeast) about this.  He's a big believer in propagating &
pitching lager yeast at about 70F and then bringing it down to lager
temps over the next 12-15 hrs.  He believes the yeast will get off to a
better start this way and feels that very few esters & fusels will be
generated during the first few hours after pitching.  That said, you
sure
would want the temp down in lager range once the yeast has stopped
propagating and started the fermentation process in earnest.


I'd be interested what others out there do in regard to pitching their
lager yeast.

Subject: Acid Malt & Mill Gaps


Jeff Carlson asks about acidulated malt ( saurmalz ).  I have heard that
the malt is sprouted and reseeped at about 125'F to cause a lactic
fermentation and then kilned.  The result is a very strong lactic 
sourness.
 Taste one corn.  Take my word for it, you only need to taste one.  




I understand that it is made to reduce the pH in mashes without violating


German brewing laws.  




I use it at 3% ( .25 lbs in five gallons ) to give my stouts that 
Gunniess
tang.  It works great!  It is perfectly controllable, especially when
compared to sour mashing.  I would like to see if a pseudo Berliner Weiss


could be made from it.  It may have applications in pseudo lambics as 
well.


Rick Gerogette asks about mill gaps. We, operate a homebrew shop here in
Cincinnati.  We carry over 75 different grains and allow our customers to


mill their grains in either a Philmill or a two-roll prototype mill.  I 
see
a lot of different grains being crushed.   I won't debate that you can 
make
good beer at a constant "magical" gap setting.  We are talking about home


brew here.  But if you don't adjust the gap, you will get inconsistant
crushes when you move from one grain to another.  One of the prime 
reasons
that brewers get poor extractions is poor crushes.  This is especially
common amoung beginning all-grain brewers because of a fear of getting a
stuck mash.  Inconsistant crushes cannot be looked upon as an advantage. 


"Magical" gap settings will produce inconsistant crushes. 




On the other hand, if adjusting the mill is difficult and time consuming,


"magical" gap settings could be usefull, but don't be fooled into 
believing
that you will be getting consistant crushes if you use a variety of 
grains.


I crush by visual inspection never worrying about what the gap is.   
Almost
all corns need to be crushed and there should be few intact "ends" 
floating
around.  I tend to crush on the fine side and don't have problems with
stuck mashes or tannins.

My 12in has a cross-drilled hole through the nylon elbow that allows phlow
when it's bottomed.  You may have an early version, or the hole was just
phorgotten.


As phor countering the phloating tendency, I have had good luck with just
holding the thing down with my mash paddle while I add grist to the
underlet water.  So phar, so good ...

Subject: Gott mashing




The discussion about Gott cooler modifications and floating false
bottoms prompts me to post my 10 gal Gott modification.  It uses a
12" stainless steel perforated pizza pan, hence, it doesn't float.
Rather than use flared brass elbow fittings and copper tubing, you 
can use hose barbs and plastic tubing to connect the false bottom with
the bulkhead fitting.  Also the flared elbow can be fit into the center
of the pizza pan rather than the side as I have done.  I placed it at the
side because I didn't want to risk knocking it around while doughing in 
and stirring at the half-way point in the mash.  If I were to do it
again I think that I would still use flared fittings and copper tubing,
but I would fit into the center of the pizza pan.  Why?  It just seems
more "correct".


I preheat my Gott mash/lauter tun with a few gallons of 130F tap water
for about 10 minutes before dumping in ALL the strike water.  The grain
is stirred in while pouring it into the water.  I never have problems
with dry balls or clumping, and it only takes a few minutes.

I purchased a 12" stainless steel unperforated pizza pan.  Taped 1/4"
graph paper on the pan and dented it every 1/2" with a drill set, then
drilled 1/8" holes at each set.  It was a pain.  You can purchase
perforated pizza pans and avoid all the drilling.


At a boating supply store I bought a 5/8" a brass bulkhead fitting.
This fitting is threaded internally for 3/8".  I also purchased a
hose barb with 3/8" threads, and 2 flare elbows.  I flared a short 
arc of copper tubing (6") and drilled a larger hole in the side of 
the pizza plate that a flare elbow threads into.  The other elbow 
is on the inside side of the bulkhead fitting.  The hose barb goes on 
the outside side of the bulkhead fitting.


(Alternatively, buy 3 hose barbs (bigger ID the better).  One attaches to
each side of the bulkhead fitting, the third attaches to a threaded
elbow to replace the flare elbow.  Then use plastic tubing, rather than
copper to join the pizza pan to the bulkhead fitting.  (see below))


About 3.25 (cut to fit) feet of 1" thick-walled tubing (Tygon in my 
case) was slit lengthwise and fit all around the edge of the pizza pan.  


The bulkhead fitting with external hose barb and internal flare elbow
fits into the spigot hole of the Gott.  The perforated pizza pan with
circumferential tubing seal and flare elbow lays upside down on the
bottom of the cooler and the short arc of flared tubing connects the 2
flare elbows.  Everything fits together finger tight.

Subject: Cornies for lagering / Beginners Guide to Mashing / Titletown Open


I've got a doppelbock in the primary right now. In about a week or so I'm going
to transfer it to a secondary for lagering. I'd like to rack it to a corny keg
and forget about it for many months (yea, right). I know that corny kegs aren't
the ideal geometry for primary fermentation, but will it make a big difference
as a lagering tank?

Jim Cave sez:
>GET OUT THERE AND MASH, DAMN IT!!  IT'S SIGNIFICANTY CHEAPER AND THE 
>RESULTS ARE WORTH IT!!


I couldn't agree more. All the technical debates about mashing, while important
and interesting, make mashing out to be an extremely complicated process, which
it is not. Fortunately the members of my homebrew club (the Green Bay Rackers)
encouraged me, I tried it, and I got hooked. Yeah, it takes more time, but I
love the whole process. I'm actually brewing more and enjoying it more. Go fig.


Bottom line: if you're thinking about trying to mash, do it! Maybe your first
batch won't get a 48 in any competition, but who cares? Get the basic process
down and improve from there. Ask a local all-grain homebrewer when he's (or
she's) going to brew next and invite yourself over! You'll be glad you did.

The following is presented as humor.  Don't worry, just get a home brew and
enjoy.


In my experience, I've seldom found critters in malt kilned at high
temperature.  In rolled grains, and in lower kilned malts.  IMHO these are
infected at the brew shop due to various situations.  One brew shop just
told me that the critters were only guaranteed to be absent for 30 days.  I
guess that's the lag time for egg hatching?  Besides, the critters just
float to the top of the mash.  They don't swim well without scuba gear, as
you observed!


When I worked for General Mills, many years ago, I checked dockage for
vermin by using a heat lamp on the screenings from a kicker.  Can't recall
how many live ones were allowed; however, many of the carloads of grains
(including barley) had to be fumigated with methylbromide.  A banned
practice today.  What chemical procedure is in use today?  Ahhh, irradiation
to the rescue!   Checked the glow of your spent malts in the dark of night
:)?  Have you wondered what effect the kilned insects have on the
nitrosamine content of your favorite malts?  Do insects/eggs glow after
irradiation?  I wonder about the flavor contribution of dioxins?


And to think that some home brewers are worried about plasticizers from
non-food grade plastics, lead and cadmium from brass plumbing, aluminum
causing Alzheimer's, or an imploding pirex carboys!


Prost

Subject: Keg sanitation/Finings/CAP recipe




Many thanks to those hbd'ers (Chris Schmidt, John Wilkinson, Ken Pegram,
Todd Larson) who responded to my inquiry on corny keg sanitation and the evils
of bleach.  Fortunately I had diluted the solution enough where no damage was
done.  I did however notice some rust on the inside of the draft and beverage
posts on one of the kegs when I took them apart.  I took a green scrubber and
cleaned it up as much as possible and lubed with keglube.  I don't know if
this
was due to the bleach solution or was a pre-existing condition.


The general consensus was to use TSP `at` 5 tbl per 5 gal hot water to clean.
Then follow with a iodophor s sution of 2 tbl per 5 gals for a 20 minute soak,
making sure to push the valves to get the sanitizer up in the pick up and
gas tubes.  Question:  Does a TSP solution or Iodophor solution corrode SS?
I have also noticed a phosphorous-free version of TSP called 'TS-Free' or
something like that, would this be a safe substitute for the real TSP.  I
didn't
know so I looked around other hardware stores until I found the real McCoy.


On the subject of finings - My local HB shop recommended polyclar in the
secondary for 3-4 days and then gelatin in the keg to clear the beer.  I will
say that I have some of the clearest beer I've ever made but it seems to be
on the thin side when compared to the same beer I brewed and bottle
conditioned 3 months ago.   Does anyone have an opinion (there's a loaded
question) about the use of fining agents and any detrimental effect on the
different styles of beer?  i.e. is it acceptable when attempting a lager but
not so
when making a porter?  German wheats would be exempt from this treatment
of course.  That reminds me it's about time to brew a wheat for summer.


CAP Recipe - I have seen several recipes for pre-prohibition CAPs and am
interested in brewing one, especially now that I have lagering facilities.
The
only problem is that these recipes are exclusively all-grain and I have not as
yet taken up that religion.  I am looking for an extract version of a CAP if
any
one has come up with one.  This raises a question about flaked maize.  Can it
be used in an extract recipe?  If so how would one go about using it?  If a
partial
mash is requried to use the maize what is the barest minimum of equipment
needed to accomplish the task?


Janitors, Sorry for the length, hopefully this post will stir some ongoing

Subject: Gott coolers and the BB Snake


All -


Hmmm . . . it seems every couple of months this Gott cooler conversion /
phloater thing keeps coming up, so here I go again rehashing an old post.


In HOMEBREW Digest #2744, Fri 19 June 1998, I posted about the BB Snake
thingy that I made for the 10 gallon Gotts.  Scott Moore recently posted
that he uses one successfully.  Cool.  Glad to hear it !!  If you want the
complete post, the above cite gets you there.


WRT Gott conversions and EM/Phils comparisons, I'd have to say that in terms
of ease, the EM is probably the way to go, but if you build my BB Snake, the
Phils works flawlessly (insert shameless ego gratification here . . .)
Almost 9 months and about 18 batches later, I've never seen a single husk
make it through the works.  Also, I add ALL the strike water before grain 1
ever goes in the cooler.  Adding the grain first will give you a real tired
arm breaking up all the doughballs, and the strike water/grist/strike
water/grist thing seems just too laborious for a lazy sot such as myself.


The spigots on the Gotts just screw out, and I bought a cooler bulkhead
fitting from HopTech (NA, yadda yadda) that seals well and accepts some
vinyl tubing that goes to the elbow.  Eventually, I'd like to step up to a
1/2" ID elbow and some braided 1/2" tube to a 1/2" ball valve, and make the
whole deal into a RIMS type MLT.  I'll do that whenever I stop being lazy.
;-)


Anyway, coolers maintain the temps well (provided that you are able to
accurately calculate the temperature of your strike water -- does anyone
know how to do this, I'd like to hear some discussion...)  Sorry, couldn't
resist!

Subject: Implosive carboys,


Brewsters:


Ross Reid has used a vacuum pump to move beers around
in his glass carboys and wonders about the safety.  




A couple of comments:


1) glass carboys vary by the source ( thickness, annealing),
construction (ribs or not, type of glass, shape of the
bottom, etc.),  by their history ( scratches, dings, heating)


2) Just because no problem has been encountered does
not mean Ross won't have one.


Simply transferring from one place to another will not place
a high vacuum on the glass walls, however, as Ross pointed
out, he sometimes gets as high as 1 atm when transferring
from one floor to another.  




In my opinion it is unsafe to do this without some kind of
substantive protection.  I could suggest a covered wooden
box into which the bottle under vacuum is placed so that if
it implodes all you would have is a mess.  Safety glasses
will not protect the rest of your body.  Freshly broken glass is
incredibly sharp. So much so, that freshly broken glass is
used in microtoming tissue into thin slices for microscopic work.


Certainly, I would not use the bottle bare. Even in a laboratory
using glass pieces under vaccuum ( which were <designed>
 for vacuum use, N.B.) we always use a heavy form of tough
tape to wrap them securely.


I once brought a carboy home from the HB store and noticed
a hairline crack running between the ribs of the glass. It did not
appear to be from striking, but due to poor annealing.  Had
I put that one under vaccuum, I would likely had had a shatter
event.  Point is you never know when you are using a piece of
equipment for a purpose for which it was not intended.


Pyrex glass may or may not be stronger than soft glass, but it
likely will have less thermal stresses due to its lower thermal
coefficient of expansion. We still wrap it up. Remember the
larger the radius of curvature, the weaker the glass to
deformation.  Put another way - the bigger the bottle,
the higher the risk of implosion.


Be safe and have fun. Both are possible.


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: Vacuum and Heat Sealer Recommendations


HBD,


I'm looking for a recommendation on a vacuum sealer or a heat sealer.  I
buy most of my grain in 50 pound bags.  I currently repackage the grain
in zip-lock bags.  I'm considering a vacuum or heat sealer.  More
importantly, I always seem to buy whole hops in six ounce packages.  I'd
love to be able to repackage the "left-overs" using a vacuum sealer or
consider buying whole hops in bulk.


I poked around the Internet and found a few vacuum sealer models in the
$200 - $300 range,


        Magic Vac    70-FS    Champion    $259
        Magic Vac    70-FSMAXIMA    Maxima    $329


And these models "as seen on TV",


    Foodsaver    #2 Professional    $299
    Foodsaver    Compact II    $179
    Foodsaver    Deluxe    $199


A more cost-effective alternative would seem to be a heat sealer,


    TISH100    4"    140W    $69
    TISH200    8"    180W    $89
    TISH300    12"    200W    $125


Hoptech offers an 8" Rival Micro-Seal for $21.


Does anyone have experience with any of these models or with any other
model of vacuum or heat sealer?


Most of my local homebrew supply retailers use a heat sealer.  This
would seem adequate for grain.  And with whole hops I suspect that you
can squeeze most of the air out of the bag before heat sealing.  Can a
homebrewer justify the added cost (> $100) of a vacuum sealer over a
heat sealer?


You can E-mail me directly.  If others are interested, I can append a
summary.


Thanks,


Joe

Subject: RE: Lager Pitching Temp


Troy Hager asked if anyone used a settling tank as suggested by Noonan.
I drain my chilled wort to sanitized buckets and put them in the freezer
to settle and get to the pitching temp I desire.  I even do it with ales,
although it doesn't take as long to cool so I will take them out of the
freezer and let them settle longer, if necessary, without further cooling.
I then siphon into the fermenter, leaving the sediment behind.  I do loose
some beer this way but I like the clear wort going to the fermenter and I
have had pretty good luck producing clear beers.  I chill to about 44F for
lager and 64F for ales before pitching.  Of course, the starter needs to be
at about the same temperature.

I worried about this but I am not sure I agree that longer lag times really
are a major cause of bad beer.  If sanitation is good I don't think a couple
of hours lnger to pitching is going to hurt.  It hasn't hurt me but I know
my sample is small and may be meaningless.

This is my second season using my HEMAN RIMS system.  It is big fun brewing
with my brew toy.  I have been able to standardize most aspects of my brew
day:
I can hit strike temps and step mash boosts temps within a degree or two
everytime.  Sparge rates and brew kettle evaporation rates can be repeated
easily.  Run off SG can be easily read with my trusty hydrometer.  I can use
commercial products to compare color targets.


My final IBU's predictions are just that. Predictions. I prefer hop pellets
and use hop bags. Do I add 15% for pellet use and subtract 10% for hop bag
use?  I have a custom built brew kettle with an extra heavy duty bottom for
even heat distribution.  Do I add 5% for the very vigorous rolling boil ?


ProMash and Suds97 have different IBU calculation formulas. Promash even
'ages' your hops in storage for you. It is interesting to run one's favorite
recipes through these software programs to get a feel for the different IBU
predictions using different formulas.
My solution will be to have two or three of my stock batches tested for IBU's
by a reputable lab and work backwards from that point to measure 'my' system's
utilization.  My local tech school hopes to have an affordable IBU testing
program in the fall of 1999.  


Until then it is just guess work.


My question to the HBD:


What are some of the most useful steps to get the IBU predictions "In the ball
park, aka in style"?

Jim,
I think its a fairly simple thing to check your mash pH.  Even if you don't
have precision, it's important to have an understanding of your pH, and more
importantly your water chemistry.  When I first began all-grain, I failed to
consider this fact.  I am one of the unfortunate brewers who have water high
in carbonates.  Missing this one piece of (for me) critical information, I
made some very astringent beer until I traced the source of my problem.  So
while you are correct that for most brewers, this is not a big problem, for
some it's a critical factor to understand.  Armed with this knowledge, you
can avoid making astringent beer.

As much as I hate to also disagree with my friend and fraternity brother
Curt, I have not found this to be true in my set up either.  I've heard the
commandment, "thou shalt lauter for 60 minutes or leave sugar behind."  My
experience mirrors Jack's.  I usually sparge for less than 30 minutes, and
have no problem with extraction.  I have a RIMS and have wondered if all the
recirculating perhaps makes the sparging more efficient.

I rack a finished lager into a carboy and chill the carboy overnight
until it is down near 40 degrees.  Then I rack the unfermented wort off
the cold break into another fermenter and pitch my yeast.  This solves
both the temperature problem and gets rid of all the crap that you don't
want in a lager fermentation.


Someone else recently inquired about DMS in a cream ale.  The resident
rocket scientists forget to ask whether this brewer had used a wort
chiller and had a slow cooling.  I think using a wort chiller is the
single biggest improvement that a beginning brewer can make.  Lager malt
and covered boils can produce DMS, although I do both often and never
get DMS unless I'm doing a Bock in which one wants a tiny trace.


I came of beer-drinking age in the land of Gennessee Cream Ale, and a
trace of DMS (sort of like sweet creamed corn) is tasteable in the
style.


For those who don't want to lose beer through a blow-off hose, try using
two carboys.  This also has the benefit of giving your primary
fermentation more head space, and when you rack the five gallons into a
secondary, the head space vanishes, just the way one would want it to
do.

Subject: Decline of homebrewing....


Seems our HBD Janitor is theorizing about what's at the root of the decline of
our hobby at his OTHER job on aol. Thought you might find this interesting.


Posted w/o his permission, but I figure he'll can the article if it bothers
him!


The Weizenguy




Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Funny thing, this. As with many "craft hobbies," they swell and then crash to
the breakers. Some return for another roll, others die out completely.
(Anybody remember glass cutting in the '70s?)


Economics is the problem here. Many existing home brew retailers saw the tide
roll up and decided it was to be the eternal tsunami. Some reacted by
increasing inventories and investigating new products. They are to be
commended. Others hunkered back and figured you'd take whatever they had to
offer. Some raised prices, some lowered. The tide grew higher. No-one noticed
the shore was coming up. Many new shops opened up hoping to glean a share of
the
rising surf. The tide surged still higher. And the ranks of those riding the
surf swelled as well.


While all this was going on, another swell was rising in yet another ocean of
beer: microbreweries and brewpubs were flourishing all over the country. So
much so that many "one beer for all" megabreweries were sent scampering to
their pilot breweries in order to get in on the wave with something of flavor
and substance. Still others went about like large sharks snapping up the
smaller, tastier fish in buyouts. Good beer was abundant, but somewhat
pricey. The sheer number of competing breweries and pubs began driving the
prices of good beer lower and lower until...


 ...both waves crashed into opposite sites of an island known as consumer
desires and motivations. The economy in the US what it is today, we can all
pretty much get whatever beer we want fairly affordably. For many, this killed
the motivation to brew it for themselves. Face it: how many times have you
heard someone in describing their craft say that they can brew it cheaper, or
they can brew what they can't buy? We all have. I believe I've even said
it a few times myself. Now, take all those people out of the pool of those
buying home brewing supplies, and you see suppliers dropping like flies (and
it's not the "backdoor dealings" that hurt suppliers -- that's just whining.
Show me a brewpub or micro that can afford to give away or co-buy in volumes
high enough to threaten a shop?) 


Add to this a national organization supposedly dedicated to the promotion of
home brewing which does absolutely nothing of value for its membership. Have
this same money-grubbing organization attempt to set up organizations internal
to itself to compete against existing organizations which support the
suppliers and those dedicated to appreciating and judging beers, further
fracturing the home brewing community....


Yes, it's ugly. And yes: we're the only ones that can stem the tide and turn
the flow. I was once told that I was a disease -- that wherever I went people
were "infected" with home brewing. (I thought it quite a compliment :-) This
is how we need to be. A carrier for the brewing bug. We each need to do what
we can to "spread the word." Demonstrations at your local supplier. Public
services carried out by your local club. Person to person
conversation, sampling, teaching. Local newspaper stories. Web pages. Beer
festivals. 


Stop in at your local shop and ask how you can help him stay open. Maybe
you've noticed some particularly nagging thing about his shop he may not be
aware of, but that all your friends comment on. Let him know so he can fix it.
Offer to help her build an order of things you know will sell to you and your
friends. I'm not suggesting that you go in there and be a free stock boy
(unless you want to), but offer some assistance to help keep the place
open.


And be an evangelist for the craft. It'd be nice to be able to go door to door
preaching your message as some religious groups do, but that'd be a bit silly.
No. Tell you co-worker about brewing. Invite a few over some weekend for a
brew-be-cue: brew some beers and cue up some food. Be sure to have plenty of
good home brew around to whet their appetite for more! There's plenty other
things to do such as this, too! Be creative! Spread the word!


Enough ranting! I've a family to tend to...

I don't really consider it socialistic, though it could be construed that way.
I started my brewing career (many have heard this before. Page down to the
next paragraph...) at the tender young age of 12. It was a science project on
yeast and fermentation. It was also very illegal as I was 12 in 74. Anyway, it
captured my attention, and with the support of my parents, I "pressed on."
There were no books, no newsgroups, no "home brew shops" (a few good
wine making shops, though...). Good ingredients and good information were
pretty hard to come by. I do this (AOL), the HBD and my pages solely because
it was something I *could* do - something I could offer from all of that. My
reason for doing this is the difficulty I had in getting quality information.
Not socialism; just a tad of altruism. 


As you read on, you'll understand, too, how you don't owe it to those coming
up behind you. No, quite the contrary: you owe it to yourself. Read on,
brothers and sisters! Read on...


As I implied above, there's a SELFISH reason for pushing the craft, my friend!
Consider this: if the number of brewers continues to drop off, so will the
volume of sales in your local home brew shops. They close. 


Pickings get slim. Prices go up. 


Distributors are then hit by the reduction in market, and they shrink and
close causing more home brew shops to close. 


Pickings get slimmer. Prices go higher. 


It's an economics thing. We're slipping out of the "economies of scale" realm
of economics down to the other side of supply and demand. For the short term,
if this trend continues, supply will outstrip demand and, as those shops
continue closing, you'll enjoy low prices on old ingredients -- "close-outs."
Once that trend flattens out, and the supply base stabilizes at the smaller
level, the supply will, at best, meet the demand. More than likely,
it'll turn slightly in the favor of demand outstripping supply. 
Prices go up even higher. 


One other nasty thing that usually occurs in such situations: since your
market is not high demand, it has little buying power. With little buying
power, it's hard to enforce any demand for quality. And the malts get stale,
the extracts get doped with sugars and you have little say in the matter if
you want to brew at all. Dollars to doughnuts, companies such as Whitelabs,
Wyeast, YCKCo, et al. will not be able to stay afloat in the home brewing
market, and the quantum leaps made in yeast culture quality in our market will
be lost...


Pretty bleak looking picture, hey? But not unrealistic. THIS is why you want
to push the craft by attracting and teaching new brewers: to keep prices down
and quantity and quality of supply up! Plain ol' economics.


Now, brother and sister brewers! Go out and spread the good beer! Gather a NEW
flock o' brewers to the bossom of the burbling carboy! Amen! I say: AMEN!
