Doesn't sound much like the same beer, does it? That's because the
Belgian and the Dutch Oud Bruins are actually 2 entirely different styles.
There is no sourness in the Dutch beer, and it is indeed low in alcohol.
I am unaware of any that are available in the US, and if you entered a
well-made version of the Dutch style into a homebrew competition, under
the Flanders Brown category, it would not score very well at all. 


To read more about these styles, check out Tim Webb's excellent book
about the Beers of Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg, put out by CAMRA,
which is now available in the US.

Conversely, I entered 4 beers in the Boston Comp and won 3 ribbons. These
same four beers were entered in the Brooklyn contest and didn't place at all
(still waiting on scores sheets from Brooklyn so I can't comment on how well
I scored). This includes a Bohemian Pils that qualified me for MCAB 2000
with a score of 38 at the BHC. For some reason the judges in Brooklyn felt
that no beer entered in their contest was good enough to be awarded either
1st or 2nd in the European Light Lager category. That really puzzles me, not
awarding a ribbon in an *amature* contest. It's not like a home brewer is
gonna use the award for marketing. What criteria was used in Brooklyn to
determine if a beer was good enough to receive an award? Does a beer have to
score above a certain rating to be awarded a blue ribbon? Is this common
practice at home brew comps (I haven't heard of it before)? I understand why
this would be so at the GABF, where a ribbon is worth its weight in gold
from a marketing standpoint, but in an amature contest I fail to see the logic.

Subject: Split session brewing responses


Hello all,


Thanks to all those who responded to my post regarding split session
brewing, which I tried for the first time recently.  Some people requested
that I share the replies I received.  To summarize, I mashed and sparged
one evening, then boiled the next morning, and posted a question regarding
the proper storage technique for the collected wort (I left mine sitting on
the stove).


A number of people felt that there was a danger of contamination with
storing unboiled wort overnight.  Several brewers indicated that when doing
a split session, they boil the wort for a short period to sterilize it
prior to storage.  One posted reply suggested simmering the kettle
throughout the night (with small kids in the house, I can't try that).
Another post noted that spent grain in a mash tun got "reeky" if not
cleaned until the following day.  Notably, no one presented any evidence
that overnight storage of unboiled wort actually did cause problems.


Other brewers indicated that they take no precautionary measures beyond
covering the kettle between sessions.  One brewer claims to have used the
split session procedure for most of over 160 problem-free batches, storing
his covered kettle on the basement floor.  Another brewer pointed out that
it took two full days to deliberately sour a batch, so he had little
concern with storing fresh wort for 8 to 10 hours before boiling.


I really like the split session approach and will definitely continue using
it, because for a family man like me, two shorter sessions are much easier
to schedule than one long one.  Also, I think the long steep benefited my
first wort hopping results, as I tasted a delicious hops flavor and
smoothness in the wort that I hadn't noticed before with these same hops
(homegrown).  Bringing the wort to an intermediate boil requires a lot of
extra time and energy that doesn't seem justified, and more efficient use
of time is a primary objective of the split session approach.  Given the
successful results others have with just letting the covered wort sit at
room temperature, I think I'll continue using that practice.  Of course, YMMV.


Cheers,


Greg

If you just want to pump liquid from one container to another as quickly as
possible, that statement is correct 
 
However, we have used and sold many similar pumps both individually and
with our systems over the last 9 years with anywhere from 3/8 to 3/4" drains.


Experience indicates, in a brew system, there are more factors involved in
the proper  operation of the pump, than simply inlet and outlet size;
Screen, Crush, back pressure, overall system design etc.

I held off on posting this since it is so simple and easy I assumed that

Rinse the carboy well.  Pour in 1-2 cups of household bleach.  Fill carboy
with cold water and cap or seal - plastic wrap and a rubber band works.  
Let it sit.  After a day or so all the gunk will be dissolved.

In response to the cleaning carboy thread:
I have heard a lot of other cleaners mentioed, (sudsy amonia etc) but I
have used with complete success on even the stubornest, crusty krausen
residue, household bleach, generic, un-scented, economic, deconatminating,
amazing, revitalizing BLEACH (feel free to sing along).


I rinse most of the gunk out with plain old water and then use two ounces
o'bleach measured via shot glass to a full five gallon carboy. Then, I let
it set for several hours or overnight. The bleach eats up the gunkies. I am
able to use one of those elbow brushes to wipe away the persistent ones.
Then I rinse thourougly. Lately I've been storing my carboy's with bleach
water in them (albeit with a greater dilution 2 tsp: 5 gal).
Put that in yer pipe and smoke it

I have also wondered about the "life" of the idophor solution.


This is a problem with just about any sanitizing solution that you use.
The most common ones for brewers are halogen containing (chlorine or
iodine) or peroxygen based-- both of which will degrade over time.  I
generally consider a week in a sealed container to be the top end for
any solution that I have stored-- but that's due only to gut feeling
(and I have used all of those mentioned above).


One product that I just don't know about (and I hate to do this, but
can't bear for someone to claim that I'm losing my objectivity about
brewing) is a product put out by my no. 1 competitor, Star-San.  As it
is an acid-based cleaner, I don't see how it could degrade over time.

Alan McKay asked about plumbing his new mag pump:


*************
I finally broke down and bought a pump - the high temperature (250F) 6144MM
from Moving Brews.  The fellow from Moving Brews says that on the inlet size I
shouldn't run a smaller pipe up to the pump, than what's on the inlet of the
pump
itself. This is repeated in the reading material included with the pump.
This presents a very serious problem for my brewery, as I'm all 3/8" copper,
which is only about 1/4" ID - quite significantly less than the 1/2" on the pump
inlet.
*************


What you were told by the salesperson is correct Mike... Don't plumb the
inlet side of the pump with pipe that is smaller than the inlet. The reason
is that mag pumps are lubricated by the liquid being pumped and any
restriction on the inlet side will reduce the pump heads' ability to remain
"full" of liquid.  Running the pump even partially dry can result in
cavitation and failure, (seizure), of the impeller. I know this to be a fact
as I did exactly that to my first mag pump. All plumbing in my system,
(inlet side), now matches my pumps inlet diameter of 1/2". Also, my current
pump has the advantage of special carbon bushings that allow the pump to run
dry for up to 8 hours without damage. The pump is a "Lil' Giant and handles
up to 200F continuous and I have no problem running near boiling wort thru
it for short periods. I don't have the model number handy, but it costs
$125.00 through Graingers.

I had been hoping to hook my pump up like this :


 - Kettle -> CF Chiller -> Pump -> Carboys


But with this requirement mentioned above, I'd have to build a whole new
chiller.
The fellow at Moving Brews recommended I go :


 - Kettle -> Pump -> Chiller -> Carboys


and then replumb between the Kettle and Pump with a thicker copper.
This would certainly be a lot easier than building a new chiller.


But I thought I'd ask what you folks are doing.  Are you all just ignoring
the recommendation and running smaller pipe up to the inlet anyway?
If so, how long have you been doing this?  Which pump are you using?
Have there been any problems resulting?]




I use a 1/25 hp pump from Moving Brews.  Nearly all these mag drive pumps
require what's referred to as a "flooded suction".  This means that there
needs to be a positive head (pressure) on the inlet for the pump to operate
as designed.  If you don't have this positive pressure on the inlet, the
pump will cavitate, greatly reducing pump life and actually spinning your
beer into a froth as well.  With my March pump, you can hear the vibration
when the pump is cavitating.  You can choke back these pumps (place a
restriction, i.e., a throttling valve or other device) on the outlet and
control flow in this fashion.


I understand you want to gravity flow through your CF wort chiller and then
to the pump inlet.   First, I would ensure that the system will gravity
flow through the CF without a pump in line.  Measure the flow rate and
verify this is satisfactory.  If it is not, increase the head on the CF
chiller by raising the elevation of the kettle and/or upsize your transfer
tube/pipe.  If flow is satisfactory, then install your pump and throttle
the pump discharge to less than the flow you measured at the CF chiller
outlet.  This would provide for the positive head required at the pump
inlet.  If flow from the kettle through the CF chiller to the pump inlet is
not satisfactory, then you likely need to buy a different style pump that
will actually provide some suction to facilitate this flow.

Another waylong message on this topic.  Lately this forum has been concerned
with the decline in the "homebrew market".  Many of our local retailers,
whether good or bad, are in trouble.  As with any market contraction, it is
likely some homebrew shops will go out of business over the next year or so.
So, shopowners and others in the know, how do I be a good customer?


First, I am not an employee of a homebrew shop, and I have no idea what kind
of financial condition my local shop is in, though the owner is a bright and
considered guy and I think must be making a living.  He's not driving a BMW,
and neither am I.  IMHO anyone who planned on getting rich in the homebrew
supply market is probably broke by now.


Heres what kind of customer I am. I have been brewing over 6years now.  I buy
all my grain from my local supplier, Jim's Homebrew, because they have great
service and high quality products at a fair price, period.  I buy in batch
lots, and the shop does my crushing.  The grain is always great, no bugs, none
of the horrors one reads here in this forum, ever.  The crush they give is
dandy, matching the written charachteristics of a perfect crush, and though my
yields don't approach the high yields cited often here, they are reproducable
batch after batch and the crush is not responsible.  I don't buy rolled oats
there; I use Quaker.  I malted my own grain a time or two, and they talked me
through it, encouraging all the way.  I got the grain from a family member
who's a farmer..so I cut out all middlemen. It cost me more than I would have
paid, cash.


I buy my hops there if I don't grow 'em myself from rhizomes I bought there.
I buy my yeast there, too, taking an older pack of liquid yeast so they can
save the fresh stuff for folks who don't build a starter.  The shop turned me
on to the danstar dry yeasts, for which I am eternally grateful. I don't, and
won't, yeast ranch, it's just not for me.


They carry a lot of beers you can't just  buy anywhere, so sometimes I'll
sneak down and buy a few, take 'em home and drink 'em.  Belgians, regional or
other unique beers, barleywines, etc.  I've learned a lot about beer there. I
don't subscribe to BT or BYO, I buy by the issue at the store if I see
articles I want.


I make my own equipment by scrounging stuff or using other things (canners,
for example) as brewing equipment.  I bought my kegging stuff there, scrounged
some other kegs, and get my CO2 from a local industrial gas supplier.  I do
this because one of the reasons I homebrew is that I have this pathologic need
to make my own stuff....all my brewing equipment, my sailboat, flies and
flyrods, duck decoys, I train my own dog, smoke my own fish and pheasant and
venison jerky, etc...you get the point.


I don't belong to a club, because I don't have time, belong to too many
clubs/conservation organizations, etc already, so I'm not joining.  There
isn't one in this town anymore, anyway.


All in all, I suppose I spend about 300 bucks at this brew shop, 20 bucks 12
times per year for a batch of beer, and another 60 or so in incidentals.
Could I scrounge around, mail order, internet order, and save on this?  Yeah,
but what over a year, 10 bucks?...instead of great, friendly, knowlegable
service and fresh stuff?


Folks, at this rate, he ain't staying open on me.  And he's getting all my
brew money.  And this shop earned that, as I've now told all my friends.  So,
those of you who run brew shops, or have, please tell us all, what beyond
keeping making good beer will keep a good shop open?  How do we close the bad
ones before they drive the good guys out? Given this inevitable crash in the
brewing market, wasn't this washout preordained? (remember, I flyfish,too.
Anybody see "A River Runs Through It"...)  How is a 30 second commercial going
to target the do-it-yourselfer/hobbyist who is also interested in making and
drinking beer? And how are those shops who need it the most gonna cover the
airtime?


So, let's hear it owners and suppliers, what do you expect in a customer?

Subject: Judging Variability: Problems with BJCP Exams


It is pretty easy to second-guess judging or make generalizations about
the judging of competitions.  I'm going to decline to do that even
though I've had beers that had wildly different evaluations from
certified judges.  But I think that George's first point suggests that
there are serious problems with the BJCP.


Several of my friends at Homebrewers Of Staten Island (whose beer
judging abilities I value highly) have encouraged me to take the BJCP
exam, which always seems to be held when I'm working on Sunday morning. 
Their opinions about beer and recipes have been very helpful to me.  So
the grumbles that follow have nothing to do with judging of my beer or
the exam that I haven't taken.


First off, it is ridiculous that a BJCP exam can use beer brewed by the
exam evaluator.  Several friends have been roasted on the exam for
spotting defects in beer brewed by the evaluator.


Secondly, I think many Certified judges haven't tasted stellar examples
of particular styles.  I still vividly recall a very loud and officious
certified beer judge from western New York who sat in The Broad Ripple
Brewpub pontificating, yet he couldn't tell the difference between the
IPA and the ESB (both of which are absolutely classic there.)


Thirdly, the more I read here and the more I brew and taste, the more I
am convinced that some of the AHA style guidelines are from Mars if not
Uranus.  For example, an all-Munich malt grain bill would probably make
a great Bavarian-style Alt-bier,  (think of Ayinger Alt-Barische Dunkel)
but I'm sure many judges would trash such a beer for being out of
style.  And nobody has disputed my contention in a previous digest that
a 60 OG gravity "Belgian" Dubbel or Pale Ale falls into the middle of
the AHA range while being illegal to brew in Belgium.


Finally I think that although beer judging may appeal to some brewers
who want to deepen their knowledge of style and who judge with
sincerity, it also attracts an uncouth group of know-it-alls who want to
tell everyone else how to brew.

HBD-
We seem to have a leak in our Information Managment Departement:


News flash from the Midwest:  I just saw a preview in Fred Garvin's
kraft korner for the Fred Garvin Productions Manufacturing Company
Adjustable Roller Malt Mill which sports the following features:


 -accomodates any gap spacing
 -variable speed drive to suit your own cranking speed
 -continuous duty for those all night sessions
 -self lubricating assembly
 -easy clean up
 -KY dispenser option        


Thanks to Mr. Druey, The Bent Dick YoctoBrewery is on damage control.
Work on our adjustable malt mill is on hold.  We are waiting for our
engineering staff to complete their reverse engineering on some Intention
Sensors.  You know- the sensors on the doors on the Starship Enterprise?  The
ones that know whether Spock is throwing somebody up against the door, or
throwing them out the door.  The door either opens, or stays closed
accordingly.  Our engineers are staying up around the clock, watching old Star
Trek reruns, while Fred fetches them coffee.
Once this hurdle is cleared, we will be offering a mill that will automaticaly
adjust it's roller gaps to provide a crush that will match whatever %
efficiency you are expecting.  It will also adjust the speed of the rollers
depending on how much of the rollers surface you think should be involved in
crushing the grain.
Kyle, report to Fred's office after the Object Removal Seminar this weekend.


Next week, Fred's Craft Corner will cover making a CPVC manifold to fit a 10
gallon Gott.

4) Pump the wort back into the kettle. Keep pumping until the wort is at
the temp desired and then stop the water and transfer to carboys.


This is my standard chilling procedure. Use some leaf hops to set up a
filter bed and you get crystal clear wort by recirculating. I set the
return flow so that it forms a whirlpool. This way I run the pump full
speed and the water slow. This keeps a lot of wort in contact with a little
water and the exit temp of the water is very close to the input temp of the
wort (rather then the wort exiting at the same temp as the input water).
Friday night I chilled 11 gallons of Tripel (westvleteren yeast!) to
55F in 30 mins using 45 gallons of water.
