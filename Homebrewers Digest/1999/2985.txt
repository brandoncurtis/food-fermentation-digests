Started reading the hbd while cooking the evening meal.  I don't knowif it

ASSED indeed- then I read the " ASSED".  The spelling of "ARSE" gave him
away.

>    I was in Chicago a year or two back, and went to a couple of "Brew
shops". One I think was called "beer in a Box"-it was closed!  Next I tried
a place with a name somethig like "The Golden Sheaf" - it was owned by a "Al
K-something-or-other."---he was't there: nor was anything else.  Can't think
of the name of the other:- but it had bugger-all anyway.  Coming from a
small
"Brew Shop" in W.A. (thats Western A-Bloody-stralia) I found it hard to
believe that my "piddly" little hobby shop was actually bigger than some of
the "Must See" shows in the States.


Big Deal!  If your shop is so fantastic, so be it.  Maybe land is cheaper,
maybe rent is cheaper.  Maybe you have no competition or you have the means
to have such a large establishment.  Chicago is NOT a cheap place to live in
America - I doubt it very much that you could even afford to run your shop
here.  Why?  Most American HB shops can't afford to be huge because there
still is such a LARGE percentage of American beer drinkers that prefer that
stuff that comes in 30 packs of 12 ounce cans over the 'good stuff'.


>    (1)In Australia, most brewing is done with a "kit & a kilo".  Because
beer is so cheap in the U.S. you don't brew for cost, in Australia we do.
However some people can afford the beer - but brew for the flavour-these are
the people we target-we cannot match the "super Markets" in price (although
we get the questions that the "check-out chicks' can't answer.) but
we can match the bastards on accessories.  Look at the market share you can
compete in:- forget the rest.


For the 'swill' drinkers in America, yes.  One can get a case of Old
Milwaukee on sale cheap.  However, for even the average Homebrewer that
likes GOOD beer, I couldn't disagree more.  Average cost of a good micro
here approaches $25 or more per case in many cities.  If it was so cheap as
you describe, then I guess I'll go sell all my brewing stuff at a flea
market and just go back to buying all my beer again.


>    (2) Smart-arssed grain brewers that can buy their grain from "micros":-
In U.S.A. they may be a worry. In Australia- forget them! they want
everything on the cheap, they only pick your brains, they buy everything
wholesale & they only upset genuine customers. The amount of business
generated by these " holier than thou" scientific brewers is not worth
having.  Concentrate on your genuine customers.  Sure I've had "smart"
brewers go away thinking that I did't know the particular adjuct (let alone
stock it) that they wanted:- however I also didn't tell them which breakfast
cerial would do the job.  As far as I am concerned, I stock grains (fresh
because I use them  myself) but I don't take shit.  <snip>


What's wrong with wanting inexpensive stuff?  You yourself said that most
Aussie brewers are doing it for cost cutting.  Picking your brains?  Hey
butthead, isn't it your job to help your customers?  I guess you don't think
so.  However, I do see we have yet another HB supplier that "Doesn't take
any shit."  Well, if I lived there I guess I wouldn't take your shit either.
Where I live there are 2 homebrew suppliers.  One gives nothing but
attitude, shitty prices, and frankly, I don't care for the way the owner
smells.  So...I goto the competition.

Subject: Poor Extraction Cause


DL:<"How much moisture can a grain have to effect extraction enough to
measure?>


JS:<The obvious answer is any amount will effect extraction 
"measurement".
Since we determine the amount of malt by weighing it, the extraction rate


is inversely proportional to the amount of moisture.  A 1% change in
moisture will produce a 1% change in extraction determination. Between
humid summers and dry winters, the moisture content of grain can change 
by
as much as 20%.  This puts a severe limit on the ability to even 
determine
what extraction is on a casual basis.


I put measurement in quotes because moisture has no effect on the real
extraction rate, just our ability to measure it accurately.>


I trust that Jack means that the moisture can increase vary 20% from what


is is supposed to be such as 5% to 6% instead of adding 20 percentage
points to the content such as going from 5% to 25%?? 




If the moisture content did vary, I doubt that that the extraction rate
could be measured on a practical level.  Say that you had a malt that was


spec'ed at 36 points on a coarse grind dry basis with  4% moisture and 
your
system's efficiency was 90%.  36 * (1-.04) * ..90 = 31.10 points.  Add 
25%
more moisture ( 1% ) and you get 5% moisture.  36 * (1-..05) * .90 = 
30.78
points.  Not that many common hydrometers could reliably pick up a .0032
change in gravity.  While this is a 1% difference in extraction, it is 
not
much to measure.


DL:<"Again, it has been my experiance that the larger portion of the poor


extraction problems comes from under milling.  Rapid or poor lautering
techniques are a distant second.>


JS:<For some anecdoatl experience, I was never able to achieve extraction


above the mid 20's no matter what I did until I change to DC Belgin malt.
 


It immediately went to the low 30's and has never changed in 5 years.


What does this say? It's in the malt folks.>


That is a huge change to blame on moisture.  Let us see if we can 
calculate
how much moisture it would take to go from 25 to 30 points per pound per
gallon.  The typical spec sheet for DC Pils is 35.6 points extraction for


coarse grind dry basis. Moisture is listed as 4.2%.  Lab extraction on an


"as is" basis would give you 35.6 *(1-.042) = 34.1 points.  88% 
efficiency
gives you 30 points per pound per gallon.  Assuming the same 88% 
efficiency
25 / .88 = 28.4 points.  (35.6 - 28.4 ) / 35.6 = .20 or 20% moisture.
  In
other words to account for this extract change a malt would have to 
absorb
enough water to go from 4.2% to 20 %.  I doubt that you will ever see 
malts
with that kind of moisture and if you did, you could quickly tell that
something was very wrong by chewing.


I think that Jack may be right that the change in malt caused his 
apparent
increase  in extraction, but it is not for the reasons he believes -stale


and old malt.  More likely the DC malt crushed better at the gap his mill


was set at and the other malts needed a tighter gapped mill.

Subject: Yeast Storage, Sparge bag size


QUESTION ON YEAST STORAGE:
I'm venturing into the area of yeast culturing, with the dregs of a batch
made with Wyeast 1028. I've washed it a few times, fed it new wort twice
to build up the population and get healthy yeasties, and now it has been
sitting in a few bottles in the fridge for a few weeks. I'm hoping to keep
these viable for several months, as I only brew every 3-4 weeks, and
usually completely different styles from batch to batch, requiring
different strains. 


What I'm wondering, is it best to store yeast long-term (more than a few
weeks)  under the fermented wort, or would it be better to pour off the
wort, and replace it with sterile water? 


Also, I think test-tube slants or petri dishes would be great for storage,
(in an apartment, the issue of how much space my homebrew equipment takes
up, either on the shelf or the fridge _always_ comes up)  but the lab
supply catalog I looked through had outrageous prices.  Are there cheaper
alternatives for us homebrewers who dont require medical-DNA-research
quality?


QUESTION ON SPARGE BAGS:
I got a nylon sparge bag for my birthday, in hopes of easing into
low-buck all-grain brews. This one, however, is smaller than the one I saw
in my local homebrew shop.  In an old BYO article, they mention a 6.5
gallon nylon sparge bag (which sounds about the size of the one locally).
The gift I received would only hold a max of five gallons (according to my
bottling bucket measurements). If I take this one and pull it over the lip
of the bucket so it doesn't fall in, the bottom of the bag hangs at about
the 2.5 gallon level.


Is this okay?  Do I have a bag made for another purpose?  Will the large
space between the bottom of the bag and the spout matter?  (I estimate
that a 6.5 gallon bag's bottom would hang at about the 1 gallon level,
just above the spigot.) 


Before I try this bag, I thought I'd ask the collective first; I can still
return it and buy the larger one if its not been inundated with malt. :)


(If it matters, I plan to batch sparge, as opposed to manual sprinkle
sparging, although I'll proably try both.) 


Thanks a bunch,
Gary

It sounds as though your first grumble has everything to do with an exam
you have not taken. Yes, the beer may be brewed by the exam proctor and
the examinee's score is compared to the proctor's score of the same
beer. The proctor, however, does not grade the exam. When I took the
exam last August, the worst of the four beers was brewed by the proctor
and after the exam he enlightened us on why it was so bad. I was
"roasted" on a score I assigned to a commercial beer.

This may also be true, but we must use some sort of guidelines. The BJCP
guidelines are imperfect as well but offer a pretty good place to start.

I am neither a Trappist monk nor do I live in Belgium; I am a
homebrewer. It would, for example, be impossible to objectively judge a
beer from the Belgian "Category S" because they are vastly different
from one another. I'm not sure legal classifications are relevant to
beer styles. If we chose to go by American laws, everything brewed over
6-7% ABV would likely be Malt Liquor.


In essence, every group has it's embarrassments and I'm not about to let
them spoil my fun.

Subject: no break/mash questions


Well, judging from all the private email I've gotten, I believe that
I may have been missed on the HBD.  Thing is that Karen (who, incidentally
dislikes the smell of beermaking, but does enjoy the finished product)
is currently very pregnant and on complete bedrest.  We have purchased
a new house and I'm in the process of singlehandedly subcontracting-out
a dozen tasks, making a lot of fixes and moving a million pounds of
"stuff"  This has caused me to fall behind in my HBD reading.  I decided
that I had better post a few comments each day rather than wait until
I'm completely caught up and then catch the wrath of those who object
when I post a dozen 8k posts per week (frankly, I don't blame them).


So here goes... mind you, some of these are months old...

Depending on your water ions (I speculate), your pH varies with temperature.
I generally subtract 0.3 pH from room temperature readings to approximate
the pH at 150-160F.  So, the 5.8 reading at room temp is likely to have been
5.5pH.  Now, you added this water to your mash during the sparge.  The
calcium in your sparge water reacted with the phosphates in your malt
and the pH dropped *even* *further*.  If I lower the pH of my sparge
water, I'll drop it only to 6.5 or 6.8 or so.  I'll let the calcium and
phosphate reaction take it the rest of the way.
 
It's not surprising that you didn't get hot break (and probably got
pretty poor cold break too)... too low a pH will decrease break
formation.  It becomes a big problem below 4.8 (according to the books)
but nothing is a step function in nature (well, maybe the impact of
your head on the exhaust hood) so you will begin to get less break
well above that 4.8... I would guess 5.2 or so.

It should have converted.  Alpha amylase will last well over an hour and

My rule of thumb is "measure the temp as little as possible."  The
act of measuring results in a lot of heat loss.  Keep the lid on
the mashtun as much as possible and I also recommend insulating it
if it isn't yet insulated.  If you got a long temp probe, you would
find that the temperature varies even more top to bottom.  Most
of the enzymes are in the liquid and most of the liquid is near
the top, so I tend to take readings in the top centre of the mash.

Naturally, the more water you use the more beer you'll get, but it
will be at a lower OG.  If you use only 1 quart per pound of malt, you
might get an SG at the start of the boil of 1.090.  If you boil
off 30% of the water (I've done it) you'll get 1.124 as your OG
(I was going to dilute it until I realised that this is Thomas
Hardy's OG).  When you use about 1.5 quarts per pound, your
first runnings will be just above 1.080.  Note that this will
vary with different malts and all bets are off if you add things
like rye or flaked grains which absorb more than their share of
liquid.  These are just two datapoints from my own logbook.
Spencer Thomas did some more detailed experiments which I know
were posted here and also were in a Technical Communication
published in Brewing Techniques a few years ago.  Search the
archives for "no-sparge" and "Spencer."

If you are going to add some sparge water, you should do it before
the grain bed begins to compact (i.e. while there is still some
liquid above the grain bed).  To un-stuck the mash now, you need
to add enough water to float the grain bed again, stir, let settle,
recirculate until the runnings are clearish and then runoff into
the kettle.

What I've described above is called a "batch sparge." The modern
version of sparging is called "fly sparging" and this involves slowly
adding sparge water into the top of the laeuter tun at the same
rate as you are taking runnings into the kettle.  I simply have
a bucket with a spigot and hose gently running 170F water into the
top of the laeuter tun via gravity.  You can use a ladle or a
pitcher, but that's more labour-intensive.
 
and:

Using a starter and pitching it shortly after it is most active
would have shortened your lag time considerably.  A 6F drop is
not that terrible.


>2) What negative consequences can I expect from the large lag
>time?


The most common is a very slight vegetive aroma in the finshed beer
from what are called "wort spoiling bacteria."  However, despite
this being the most common problem, it is far more likely that your
beer will be just fine.  In other words, 9 times out of 10 your
beer will be great... of those 1 times it's not great, perhaps
9 times out of 10 it will have a slight parsnip or carrot or
tomato aroma.

That's called the "dirty head."  Believe it or not, it will not
ruin your beer.  It is a combination of malt and hop compounds
and although it may look ugly, experiments I've done (and written
up in Brewing Techniques) indicate that removing it will only
decrease bitterness slightly... split batches judged blind by BJCP
judges found no difference in "harshness" or beer quality.

That's natural and depends a lot on the yeast strain.  Lager yeasts
tend to produce that sulphury aroma more than ale yeasts.

Subject: Milk Stout


In the Classic Beer Styles book "Stout", Lewis talks abotu milk stout.  He
claims the breweries used to add whey to some milk stouts.  As a home
cheesemaker, I'm intrigued by the idea.  Has anyone tried it?  What flavor
contribution did it add?  When do you add the whey (I'm thinking in the
boil to kill the cheese bacteria)?  How much whey should be added?


Thanks!

     Forgive my confusion, but how does this qualify as an open 
     fermenter?  It is sealed about as well as a bucket with a lid and 
     an airlock, or a carboy with an airlock.  A truly open fermenter 
     is OPEN to the atmosphere!  There is likely to be some mixing of 
     air and CO2 at the surface of the fermenting beer, which may 
     affect fermentation in ways that are desirable for certain 
     yeasts.  Covering a bucket with plastic wrap will create an 
     atmosphere within the fermenter that is similar to that within a 
     carboy."


I agree. A bucket with plastic wrap is not really an "open" fermenter in the
literal sense. Not too many home brewers have the right requirements for a
truly open fermenter. This would most likely require a special area with
filtered air creating positive pressure. It could be done, though. I've seen
inexpensive HEPA type filter cartridges for sale in a surplus catalog, and a
blower to run a filter system would be relatively cheap. One problem with this
idea is the relatively high expense of the electricity to run such a set up if
you brew in small batches. Intriguing, though.


Maybe it's time to come up with an acronym for the "bucket with plastic wrap"
system. BWPWF? UAF(User Accessible Fermenter)? EFFRS(Emergency Fruit Fly
Removal System)?
