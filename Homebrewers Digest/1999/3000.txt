Subject: Sparging theory


Hello collective HBDers.


I am curious to know if anyone has certain techniques that maximize
(or increase) sugar extraction from a converted mash. I use an insulated
Gott-type cooler, mash in around 152F, let sit for 90 minutes, acidify the
mash & sparge water, etc., and generally only get 70-75% extraction. 


When I sparge, I circulate the first runnings SLOWLY to set the filter
bed. Then I draw these off as I add the first batch of sparge water.
Generally, I sparge in "increments" -- drawing off one batch and then
adding anouther, drawing off that weaker batch and adding another, etc.,
until I've obtained the quantity I need to boil (six gallons or so that
boil down to five).


Would a continuous sparge (or any other tips for that matter) help my
efficiency?

     How are ya'll breaking them?  If it is from letting the bottom hit the

     Just don't cover the temperature scale so you can still read it.  It

Subject: Big brew


In #2998 Brian Rezac posted Big Brew information.


He wrote: "Last year, we had one Big Brew site that had three television
stations covering their all-day event that included brewing, raffles, a
children's coloring contest and more."


I was intrigued by the concept but am sad to report that Utah homebrewers
will be unable to participate, at least on a large scale. There will be no
media event in Utah. Just secret homebrew clubs gathering behind closed
doors and drawn shades.


Utah, which for the most part is a great place to live, never really got
over prohibition. Hell, sometimes I think our mucky-mucks would like to
reinstate that fiasco. Liquor laws in here, while not as stiff as some
locales in the bible belt, are somewhat inconvienient.


Everytime an out-of-state friend visits me I have to conduct an impromptu
seminar on all of the quirks of Utah's alchaolic beverage control laws. For
the record, you can get a decent beer here, it is not as watered down and
weak as the rumors say. Utah caps tavern and grocery store alcholol sales
at 3.2% BY WEIGHT. Other states allow 6% percent by VOLUME. Two entirely
different measurements. Beers or beverages that exeed that limit can be
purchased in liquor stores and private clubs, which are a whole other
story.
We have many quality microbrews and one of the largest, Uintah, makes a
hoppy red ale called Cuthroat that is my staple. They also make a smooth
drinking pale lager called Whiptail that I have been moderately succeful in
trying to emulate.
BUt I digress.
Although it is legal to purchase homebrew supplies, (you can't outlaw
grain), it is illegal to put all those yummy ingredients together into an
alcholic beverage with out the proper liscencing, which for the small scale
homebrewers operate is prohibative. You can make a five gallon batch of
green jello and serve it to friends, you can even make it with vodka but a
five gallon batch of beer is unlawful. My brother actually was charged with
unlawful production of alhahol after his house burned down and police found
a burbling, smokey batch of brew in the ashes.
The charges were eventually dropped but anyway I am wondering about other
state's liquor laws, specfically homebrew laws.


I would also like to encourage any Utah brewers on the list to write thier
legislators. Perhaps some of the wizards on the list can provide some
ammunition to justify legalizing homebrewing in Utah.


I will stress that I am not talking about a huge ad campaign or anything.
Most Utah homebrewers I know try not to draw a lot of attention to their
hobby and realistically it is tolerated. Like a prohibition speak easy.


But few letters to a legislator would at least draw some attention to the
matter. During last year's legislative session in Salt Lake City the matter
was brought up and although the propenent's bill was defeated there was a
healthy debate on the matter (search for "homebrew" in the Salt Lake
Tribune's archive at www.saltlaketribune.com).


And have fun with your big brew celebrations, which are a great idea.

Subject: Thanks for info, 1tier RIMS


Hello Collective
 I posted about a week ago with some questions regarding pumps and
ideas for a one tier RIMS system.  The response was overwhelming and I
just wanted to say thanks to all those who were kind enough to write
me here in the forum or privately.  
 For those who are interested here are the conclusions that I have
come to for a 10 gallon all grain system that must be kept compact and
portable.  
 I will actually go with a two tier system mounting my sparge tank up
high to spare the expense of a second pump and the associated
plumbing. Quick question how high should I mount the sparge tank above
the mash/lauter tun?  The mash/lauter tun and boil kettle will be on
one level and I will use a pump to move the wort from one to the
other.  I will use a lauter grant to catch the wort as it comes out of
the lauter tun and utilise a float switch to run the pump.  This means
a little extra work for me (in the building) but I think that it will
be well worth it.  After boiling I will use the pump to move the wort
through a hopback and into a couterflow chiller.          Now that the plans
have been drawn up I will continue to scrounge materials.  I have two
converted kegs and will soon get a third.  The pump has been ordered
and I will start construction of the false bottom this weekend (the
batteries for the drill are charged up).  A friend has the angle iron
and promises to weld it all together when I am good and ready.  In
order to simplify construction, cleaning and fittings all plumbing
will be 1/2 inch copper (unless it is strongly recommended that I do
otherwise?).
   Now another question what are the most suitable burners?  I have
one King Cooker but will need two more burners to make this happen. 
Any suggestions, I need two that are easy to control one for the
sparge tank and one for the mash/lauter tun?  
 Thanks again for everyone's help and the URL's there are some 
very inventive brewers out there.

Subject: dry stouts & oysters


Hi,
I just thought I'd throw out some more info on the subject.
I was in Ireland 6 mos. ago. Guinness is great, don't get me wrong, but
this was the 4th trip to Ireland in 10 years, and it is getting blander
and blander everytime I go. Towards the end of this trip, I was drinking
Guinness from the bottle, which is still quite amazing. I agree with the
poster who spoke highly of Beamish. Over the years, I have always
enjoyed Beamish also. On top of it being a great beer, it's also the
economy stout in Ireland. It is always a good 20-30 p. cheaper than
anything else. Murphy's, well, the previous poster who quoted an
irishman saying it tasted like bad Guinness, was giving it a compliment.
I hate it. To each his own.


I cannot end this post without mentioning the Porterhouse Brewing Co. in
Dublin. I believe they've been open a couple years now. Owners are card
carrying camra members, who truly know a thing about beer. If you want
to taste  REAL Irish Dry Stout, go to the brewpub in the Temple Bar area
and order a Wrasslers 4x stout. This is the best stout I've ever had, if
not one of the best beers I've ever had. I can't say enough good things
about it. They have an amazing Porter, another stout made with Oysters!,
and at the time had a nice cask red ale.


Don't waste your time on the "Guinness tour" There is no tour. You go
through rooms filled with Guinness propaganda, you get your "free" pint,
(you paid to go on the tour). Of course, it ends in the gift shop.


Those of you into oysters, they are truly amazing in Ireland. My wife
and I had them on 5 separate occasions, with stout, and they were clean,
fresh and good. Ireland is an amazing place. Can't wait to go back a 5th
time!

A message for Northern California HomeBrewers:
The DOZErs (Diablo Order of Zymiracle Enthusiasts) of Concord, CA would
like to invite Bay Area brewers to join us for our 3rd annual brew tour.
The tour is scheduled for Saturday April 17th.  We will meet at Sun Valley
Mall in Concord and travel in a luxurious motor coach to two microbreweries
and a brew pub.  First stop is Lagunitas Brewing in Petaluma for a fine
tour and tastings.  Second stop will be a tour and lunch at the Marin
Valley Brewing in Larkspur (Home of the Marin MountainHoppers).  Final stop
is the Speakeasy microbrewery in San Francisco for yet another tour and
tastings.  Returning to Concord by about 5 PM.
If you don't get enough beer on this tour, you have no one to blame but
yourself.  Cost is $20 to cover the cost of the bus.  Bring some change for
lunch and T-shirts, glasses, etc.
We're having trouble filling the 40 seats on the bus and would like to
invite homebrewers and beer enthusiasts to join us.  Please email me at
pat_galvin`at`ermwest.com and I will personally send you a flyer with details.
BTW, DOZE is an AHA recognized homebrew club that meets on the last Monday
of every month at Beer, Beer, and More Beer in Concord, CA.  New members
welcome.  (no affiliation blah blah blah - I'm the highly-esteemed club
president)

Subject: SS/Chlorine


Brewsters:


Jeff Luck asks why bleach is a no no with stainless steel and
is contemplating an enamel sink as an alternative to a SS one.


Jeff, the bleach is a no-no for SS to be used under pressure
( like kegs) as the chlorine/chloride combo will etch SS
if left in contact for a long time.  This can lead to stress
cracking and sometimes, perhaps, a chunk of schrapnel
propelled by the carbon dioxide.  Although it usually just
results in a leak, it is hardly worth the gamble when other
non-chlorine alkaline peroxy cleaning agents are available.

Subject: Dr. Pivo's diacetyl and other diones


Brewsters:


Dr. Pivo, I suggest you read my contribution of several
days ago where I listed the diacetyl and pentadione
contents of all major (British?) beer types and noted
the flavor contribution. It may be that these data were taken
on British "lager" which perhaps never saw a lager yeast
nor a diacetyl rest. I would hope that M&BS would have 


used data from continental beers. In any event it seems
likely that all beers contain some diacetyl since it is a by
product of fermentation.   




In M&BS p 457 1st ed. the following commments appeared:


Production of Diketones and Fusel Alcohols


"During the fermentation of brewers' wort by yeast, most of
the pyruvic acid is decarboxylated and the acetaldehyde
produced is reduced to yield ethanol. Some of the pyruvic
acid is converted to acetyl CoA and used for biosynthesis
of lipids and other esters, etc. A small amount of the pyruvic
acid, however, is used in the production of acetoin,
a-acetolactate and a-aceto hydroxybutyrate. The importance
of these compounds lies in the possibility of their being
oxidised to the diketones diacetyl and pentane 2.3 dione
which have strong flavors and aromas. Thus diacetyl
( or butane 2,3 dione) has an overpowering smell and
taste of butterscotch which in concentrations exceeding
1 mg/l (ppm) in ale and 0.5 mg/l ( ppm) in lager beers is
unpleasant. (In low concentrations it is deliberately added
to butter) Pentane 2,3 pentane dione has a sweet honey
aroma.


 .........(p. 259) . Under the conditions pertaining in beer, freed
of yeast, about 4% of the a-acetolactic acid is converted to
diacetyl. If valine is present in excess... there is little tendency
for yeast to produce a-acetolactic acid."


And it goes soforth into the Ehrlich pathway for the formation
of fusel alcohols. 




op cit P460


"Fusel alcohol production in brewery fermentations is
enhanced by increasing levels of amino acids in the wort,
by anaerobic conditions, by higher temperatures and by
continuous agitation."


Thus, I suggest Dr. Pivo do a fermentation in which the
valine concentration is low, so the a-acetolactic
acid concentration is increased and this will
encourage the formation of diacetyl in yeast-free beer.
How to do this?  low N malt ( to reduce valine),
no protein rests ( to reduce valine) and
a substantial amount of brewer's sugar in the grist
( to dilute any valine).


Sound familiar?


It should, if you are a brewer of British beers.


You might even consider two brews one in which you
do a normal brew and the other one in which the wort is
diluted and sugar is added.  You could then blend the
finished (yeast free) beers to the desired diacetyl level.


Your puzzlement over how beer might have one vicinal
dione and not another may result from your derision of
and consequent failure to practice the  "diacetyl rest".
 It may be that the diacetyl goes away faster than the
higher diones during this rest and the honey
character predominates over the butterscotch.
Diacetyl could be more reactive or more easily
consumed by the yeast during the diacetyl rest.
This could explain your dilemma.


Diacetyl in lagers *is* considered a fault as it can be  


present in large quantities in lager due to a pediococcus
infection, but  it and the pentane dione is normally
present in low quantities ( if the above referenced
table is correct) as I have indicated.Diacetyl should
not be considered a fault in low concentrations.

To which I say, it's not. It is a woodgrain background with a table on top
of it. Column one is orange with the magazine cover on it. Column two is
white with the article on it. It is _YOUR_ browser that is in question,
Jack me boy. You're likely out of date. 


Jack has just triggered a peeve of mine. And, being a HTML-responsible
clod myself, I just have to come to the aid of someone using extensions to
the HTML standards to make their page a richer experience. Yeah, yeah:  it
makes the page unreadable for some out-of-date browsers, but you advance
the technology by using it and its new features. (And colored cell
backgrounds in tables isn't all that recent, either.) 


As an HTML writer, you used to have to choose between the slick features
with the new standards, or making the page accessible to the lowest common
denominator.  But, Netscape was a purchased package back then, too. Now,
thanks to (the evil?) Microsoft, Netscape has been driven to distribute
their browser fee-free as well.  Hell! Even AOL now provides a TCP/IP
socket so you can use your own clients (as of AOL 3.5, I believe. They're
up to 4.0 now...). With all this accessibility, you can't be responsible
for those unwilling or incapable in keeping their (might I note it again: 
free...) software up to date. 


For others experiencing this difficulty in a Windoze environment, you can
upgrade your browser at www.netscape.com (Netscape v4.5) or
www.microsoft.com/ie (Internet Explorer v5.0). Unix/Mac/Etc are
unfortunately on their own. I'll add links for downloading updated

I have used Wyeast 1187 xl with great success. It is a Ringwood strain that
I think is new to Wyeast. It has added the maltiness to my ESB that I have

well as gently rouse the wort each day. This was suggested by the brewer at
Arcadia Brewing in Kalamazoo, MI who uses Ringwood in his ESB.

surprised at the amount of hydrated lime required ( 12 lbs over 800 sq.
ft.) and 10% N fertilizer ( 16 lbs) required to get the soot colored
railbed dirt to spec. ( unearthed two more spikes)  It turns out that the


lime should have been put down months ago, but I had to do what I had to
do.  




This fall I hope somebody reminds me to turn the bed over and check pH so


things go better next year.

The tour guides told us Heineken owns Amstel, Brand, and Murphy's.  I
did not verify that, but I figured they wouldn't lie.  By the way, if
you've never had Brand, it's a pretty good Dutch Pilsner.  At least it's
better than Heineken and Amstel, in my opinion. According to Michael
Jackson, it was the beer that got the concession to supply the Allied
troops as they pushed toward Germany after D-Day.

Subject: Re: Planting Time


Jay,


Wait! Don't even think of miracle grow! As a long time organic farmer, here
is what I would do:


First, do get some topsoil, about 1/2 to 2/3 of your container volume.
Then, get some manure ( horse or steer, you can buy it in bags at
nurseries) and if obtainable, "humus builder". If no humus builder, then
bagged compost or a good organic potting soil.


The above is the minimum soil requirements (IMHO). If it was me, I'd get
some chicken manure pellets. Mix a couple big handfuls of it in the
container prior to planting. Water in well. I'd also add trace elements,
especially if you dont know where the topsoil is from. Another excellent
thing to do is get some vitamin b-12 supplement (one brand is called
"Start") and use it according to directions. It promotes vigorous root
growth. I usually soak a transplant with it 24 hours in advance of the
event.


As to Miracle grow, while it is impressive in the short run, it will kill
your soil in the long run. MG, and all other synthetic fertilizers will
build salts up in your soil, and add no organic material vital to the
micro-organisms, and vital for good drainage. I would top dress with
chicken manure, blood meal, or a premixed organic fertilizer (GreenAll
makes an easy to use solid one).


One last tip: In the spring, and up until the plants start to bud, feed
them with something high in nitrogen, like chicken manure. As they start to
bud, feed them with something like bone meal, which is high in phosphorus.
This will promote bigger, tighter, more fragrant buds.


Organic is a little  more hassle. However, you get better results, and your
beloved plants won't pither and die after a few years, and hops are
something you want healthy for years to come. And hey, you wanna eat
MacDonald's for every meal for the rest of your life? Ughh.


Good hop growing,

Subject: diacetyl redux (sic)


Seems to me that folks might be confusing two sides of the same coin
regarding diacetyl.  On one hand there are commercial products, where
diacetyl, along with many other flavor components, can merge to form a
great brew.  Commercial brewers are usually highly knowledgable, have
sufficient resources, pitch suitable quantities of yeast, have in-line
oxygenators, temperature-controlled conical fermenters, etc. etc.  On
the other hand we have homebrewers, who often severely under-pitch,
don't pay attention to ferment temps, etc.  These homebrewers can
produce beer that has an overwhelming diacetyl component.  It seems
that some may be confusing trying to help homebrewers produce better
beer (viz. reducing unreasonable diacetyl levels) with campaigning to
rid all beer of diacetyl flavors.

Hi Collective,


Most likely I missed the thread concerning use of welding oxygen to aerate
wort.  However, I purchased an oxy-acetylene outfit and have the bottle of
welding oxygen at hand.  The only thing I can think of that might influence
my brew toxicisity is oil or the like.  Certainly not something that could
be easily oxydized as the bottle environment could be hazardous.  As for
bacteria in the system, the 2200  #s per square inch is so high above 15 or
so psi that I think most life forms might be crushed?  The hoses are swept
clear of tooling stuff and the welding tip is heated well above boiling.
So, the spoilage bacteria shouldn't be a problem; when, I attach a clean
hose to the welding tip and use a diffuser in the wort for a minute for so.




Seems like it should work OK when standard safety practices are followed.
I'm using a Williams SS diffuser coupled to a brass wand headed by a hepta
filter at 1 micron.  Most likely too large for bacteria.  It should keep
the larger stuff out.  Is a chemical trap necessary, like activated carbon,
etc.?

Subject: Mash time


Brewsters:


I agree with Mark Wilson's assessment of the doubtless
advantage of overnight mashing and did when I first
read about it in Dave Line's first book lo' these many years
ago. It was a compromise then using the "Bruheat" electric
brewer and it is today.  Is it worth the compromise? I doubt
it, but it does have some appeal to some people who can
devote shorter time slots to brewing. It is better to brew
than to not brew.


Mark also says: " Modern malt only takes 5 -15 minutes
to convert. All the books recommending longer
saccharification mashes are wrong." He claims a
professional brewer tipped him off to this and he
reduced his saccharification time and got better
beers quicker.


Sorry, Mark, but I have met "professional brewers" who
have told me lots of things that were B.S. learned at the
knee of Charlie Papazian. This is one of them.


In Charlie's first book he makes a similar comment and
bases it (I presume) on an iodine test in which only the
starch in the solution was tested.  Fortunately, he corrects
this in his second edition of JOHB and suggests that some
of the malt solids also be tested for the presence of
starch and also offers longer mash times as a result.
I have used this latter method before I ever heard of CP
and, although others may differ, this is the best way to
do the iodine test, IMHO.


No change in your extraction in going from 1 hour
saccharifications to 15 minutes is a meaningless result
without some quantitative numbers.


You could be mill limited. Like how many pts? What OG?
What grist? Clarity? What about mixed grists which
include non-malted grains, etc., etc.


Are you talking about single infusion mashes
only? What temperature? Higher temperature mashes
do  go more quickly. Well doughed-in mashes will proceed
more quickly as the temperature is raised as contrasted to 


using one strike heat and mashing out. The temperatures 


over which enzymes react are broad and the temperature
history of the mash is extremely important. Since amylases
are inhibited by the presence of sugars, the grist/liquor ratio
is important, as is the OG of the wort. The calcium ion
content and the pH of the wort can also be important.


I do not doubt your results, but, my point is, your comment
is extremely misleading unless we know the exact
details of your mashing procedure.


Is it worth the risk when you consider all the time this
whole process consumes?


Keep on Brewin'

I have some second hand information, if that is worth anything.
A good friend of my son's (actually mine too as I have known him since he was

Europe and one of their biggest suppliers is Heineken.  He has made many trips
to Heineken and has annual meetings with them to boot.  He had told me that
Heineken owned Murphy's and, indeed, their last annual meeting was at the
Murphy's brewery in Ireland.  He said he was amazed at what a small operation
it appeared to be.  That, however, was probably in comparison to Miller, his
former employer.


I must admit I am somewhat envious of his job, at least the travel to European
breweries part.

I did my steeping and later partial mashes in a grain bag.  The sparge if

It is great now being able to try these beers side by side. I've

Murphys. Both Murphys and Beamish have a bit more maltiness

This sounds more like a clone of Sol Sun (new name = ?) from Bell's.
It does not fit the earlier descriptions exerpted below.  The lemon zest and
seeds of paradise should not be in a Koelsch style ale; rather the very
crisp fruitiness should derive from the yeast primarily.  The noble hops are
OK,
though I haven't calculated the IBUs.  Don't over hop your Koelsch though...
a very nice hop *taste* is the target, not huge hop aroma or too much
bitterness.
Now if I could just find some of this SA beer to try!

SOP for ANYTHING should be to shy away from the Miracle Gro type of
fertilizers.  These are heavily laden with non-soluble salts.  Especially if
you are growing in containers-I don't care what size- you will eventually
end up with a build up of these salts.  It will then take more and more of
these fertilizers to keep the plants satisfied.  I suggest a more earth
friendly approach.  Use a combination of good soil and composted materials
for the growing medium.  A little rock powder or lava sand will aid in
drainage as well as moisture retention.
Use worm castings or some nice composted bat guano as a top dressing for the
nitrogen boost.
