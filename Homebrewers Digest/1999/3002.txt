Maybe they don't use separate vats. Maybe Budmillercoors takes their regularbeer
and cuts it with water to lower the alc level.

Subject: Diacetyl defense:  Should it really be necessary?


Dave Burley had some suggestions derived from theoretical sources on how
to increase diacetyl levels:

Hmmmm. And I use under modified malts, do do a protein rest, and never
add any sugar (shoot for between 10-12 plato), and still manage to steer
the diacetyls in the direction I want to. Might mention that the Czechs
do the same.


Then again, I don't have any "yeast free" beers.


I guess it just goes to show that a little (centuries) of brewing
practice can carry you farther than theoretical inference.


One reason you absolutely do not want to reduce total protein levels too
much, is that the body of the beer must be one of the components that
stand in opposition to the diacetyl, and brings it into balance. In a
body less beer, it easily becomes an "unopposed taste".

Very interesting idea.  It might be worth trying a "side-by side"
diactyl rest, and non rested, in one where I have already perceptable
levels, and see if there is a preferential reduction of the 4 carb,
while leaving the 5 carb essentially unmolested.... but then again,
perhaps Mr. Burley would care to do this "experiment" himself..... nah,
that could get dangerously close to reality, and it is probably best to
just cite literature, as one really just can't believe what is in front
of one's face.

I wonder which book Mr: Burley has chosen to let dictate his and other's
tastes.


I would suggest a trip to the Czech Republic was in order, to correct
his inlearned miss-impressions. There you will find quite high levels of
all manners of taste components (as mentioned 5-6 times threshold in
diacetyls), in a wonderfull marriage of flavours... I can guarantee you
that it is not pediococcus infections that are causing it... I know one
brewery there that doesn't pasteurize at all, and has incredibly strict
microbiological control over its product....but still has diacetyls.


Does Mr. Burley think that these things happen by chance?  That those
poor dolts that have had breweries hanging around for 6 centuries have
no idea what they are doing, and just keep repeating the same mistakes?


Perhaps he could pack up his little library and offer his services as a
consultant there, as they apparently haven't known until now that
they've been doing it "wrong" all this time.


But then again, while Mr. Burley was teaching them how to get it right,
he might bump into a copy of "Pivovarska' Enzymologie" by Dr. Lhotsky.


I do believe it was published in the early 60's and has more information
on brewing enzyme kinetics than anything I've ever read written in
English to date, including the "bibles" you continually quote from,
whose chief influence has been from the production of modern commercial
beer (who cares?).


Have you not an opportunity to get to Czecho, if you're by my cellar you
can drop in... It's really the only place outside of the former
Czechoslovakia where I've tasted that style... you might come in the
summer time, because then it is likely that I will have visits from
brewmasters from Czech land and you would then have the opportunity to
teach several of us at once why we are doing it wrong... if you still
want to think that after your third swallow.


I do agree that in a "Coors", diactyls would hang out like dog's
testicles, but so would any other flavour...... but we don't want to
teach people to make "Coors", or do we Mr. Burley?

Boy, you really can't post anything contrary to the mundanely
hypothetical here, without raising the wrath of the proselytes.

> Diacetyl in lagers *is* considered a fault


Which really awakened a sense of ire in me, and I replied in a not too
friendly fashion, as to why I think he is completely wrong.


I really had to examine my feelings on this, and I am pretty sure why I
am so touchy on this subject.


I have followed the developments in the Czech Republic since the "velvet
revolution" with great interest.


What has developed is NOT of great interest for the lovers of their
traditional beers.


To start with, over 30 percent of the breweries have out and out closed,
some of them with hundreds of years of experience in developing a unique
taste. (small tear.)


Of the remaining, yes the diacetyl levels are coming down, so are the
protein contents, the hopping rates, and everything else that made these
beers unique.  Some have gone so far as to reach the class of what I
call "Euro-Beer", and are not even recognizable as distinctly "Czech"
anymore.


They have to.  The open market economy has ensured that they can no
longer be a local producer.  They used to have a 10 day shelf life on
their bottles.  Now it is 18 months at some places.  How is that
achieved?  They must reduce flavours that are unstable.  It turns out
that diacetyls, and a lot of the other big flavours are not terribly
stable, and will not survive long transports, storages, and temperature
changes.


Their local market is being taken away by the big rational fellows who
can sell for a few kopek less, and have a good distribution network.
While you and I might still choose the "better" beer, it is not you and
I keeping these places in business, particularly in times of inflation,
when the average citizen encounters spiraling prices on every front,
with relatively unchanged wages.


I used to love the days when I had a favourite haunt, knew the beer was
delivered on Tuesdays, and would crawl into my stool and sip at some of
the most wonderful creations man has accomplished.  On Wednesdays, it
tasted like "yesterdays beer". Still fantastic mind you, but not "all"
the way there.


On Thursdays there came a new shipment.


This is dissappearing, by reducing unstable components.


The beer is not as good either.


I know that this is an unavoidable course, and globalization is somewhat
equivalent to homogenization, and that it will lead to less great beers
rather than more.


But should a homebrewer propagate the acceleration of this process?


Shame on you, Dave Burley.


Should you not be aware that a whole class of lagers, the ones that have
given us names like "Pilsners" and have inspired brewers with names like
"Budweiser" and "Michelob" (which is I believed derived from the East
Slovak "Michelav"... anyone know?), should you somehow not have managed
to be aware that part of their full character is DEPENDENT on having
high diacetyl levels, then perhaps you should restrain your comments to
subjects on which you are better informed.


How 'bout "Clinitest"?

Subject: extract and kegs


I was the one that asked about the feasibility of using soda kegs to
store and dispense liquid extract. To make a long story short; I
couldn't get it to even start coming out the keg with 50 lb.. pressure.
I still think this is the best place to store the extract, I now just
pour out what I need, purge the O2 out of the keg and place about 5 lb.
of CO2 back on the keg. I am using a keg without the rubber handles,
just makes it easier to pour without a mess.

Janitors' mailbox, I submit the following quoted directly from the Digest 
moderation policy:


3.      Posting blatant commercials to the HBD is *strongly*
        discouraged.  While such messages will not be deleted if they
        have *any* connection with beer and brewing, the HBD Steering
        Committee will encourage the HBD readership not to patronize
        businesses who clearly are abusing the HBD.
4.      Brief product or sale announcements, comments about or reviews
        of products or publications, and query responses that suggest
        a particular product or merchant (e.g., "In response to XXX's

        are appropriate HBD messages and *are* encouraged.

Subject: Sanitation with One-Step


After a long and frustrating absence from Homebrewing, this weekend
represents my return.  Unfortunately, I now remember the things I always
had problems with before.  Sanitation has always been a mystery to me, and
last night re-proved that.  I decided to use One-Step for no particular
reason other than perceived ease.  I question the No-Rinse capabilities of
this product, but I'm not convinced that's not caused by my misuse.  1
Tablespoon dissolved in 1 gallon of warm water should suffice, right?  Even
following these directions faithfully, the air-dried sanitized equipment
showed signs of a foggy white haze, reminiscent of water spots, but more
cloudy.  This didn't really seem sanitized to me, so I rinsed the equipment
with hot tap water (in this case, just a flask, measuring cup, and airlock
used for making a yeast starter).  I realize this jeopardizes the
sanitation quality of the One-Step, but it just didn't look right.  So....
on to the questions.


1.  Should I reduce the amount of One-Step I use per gallon? (I don't want
to make it too weak)
2.  Is it possible it just wasn't dissolved enough?
3.  How much have I screwed up my starter?
4.  Has anyone else had results like this with One-Step, or can recommend
using something else (Idophor?) to avoid this?


Relaxing, not worrying (yet), and having a Homebrew,

Subject: Storing bulk malt


Wil of Happy Dog Brewing Supplies asks about
"Bulk Malt extract in soda kegs"


Most of our customers who buy bulk malt (in 5 gal Pails) simply purge the
air out with their CO2 by just inserting the CO2 line into the bucket and
turning on the CO2 for a minute or so.


I don't think that the extract would flow through the small openings of a
keg.


I spoke with Tom Alexander from Alexander's (Calif. Concentrates) about
storage.  He recommended putting a little vodka on top of the malt to kill
bacteria.

This was while back, but I'm pretty sure I the context was CAPs and
other pale lagers, especially with noble hops.  While I can'imagine
using 1/2 c. gypsum for 15 gallons, I agree that with everything else
working properly, high sulfate in PAs and bitters is indeed nice.

There will be lots of fun events for everyone envolved in the competition.
There will be a party Saturday night that will include food, beer, a silent
auction, and well, more beer.


I send this call for judges in a moderate state of urgency, as the number of
judges that have signed up so far is FAR less than expected with 2 weeks
until the judging.


Here are the contacts to call/email for signing yourself up.  Remember, we

I found it at the following URL that Heineken has owned Murphy Brewery since
1983.

Don't you hate when you adamantly post something to HBD, go home, look at
your brew log, and realized you goofed?


Three years ago I switched from 1-1.5 hour sach. rests to 25-30 minutes
rests, not 15 minutes.  Sorry for any confusion.  I'm still eager to brew
and taste 15, 30 and 90 minute versions of the same beer.


Also, anyone know typical times for commercial brewery sach. rests?

Subject: Corny kegs & Beermeister/ WhiteLabs Burton Ale yeast


Hi All,


I just made the plunge and stepped-up my hobby several notches by
purchasing a corny keg set-up. I love it! My first kegged batch was a
CAP, and boy, was it good. I say "was" because it is no longer with us.


Anyway, I just cranked-up the hobby a few more notches by buying from my
cousin a used (but nice) Beermeister. It's a nice refrigerator with a
single tap-head that'll hold at least three corny kegs and still have
some space for the CO2 tank and a sixpack. It came with lines for a
standard half-barrel type of keg, and I obviously want to be able to use
my cornies in there. I was wondering if anyone out there has a similar
set-up and can make any suggestions for the simplest way to hook-up the
cornies. The line that is in there is 3/16" ID x 7/16" OD, and the
tubing that came with my corny set-up is 1/4" ID. Can I buy a barbed
adapter to attach the 3/16" line to the ball valve on the corny? Any
suggestions here would be appreciated.

For my second kegged batch, a few weeks ago I brewed an all-grain
British Bitter using White Labs Burton Ale Yeast. I've used their
British Ale yeast before and really liked the results, but this was the
first time I used their Burton Ale yeast. The primary ferment was
extremely vigorous (a lot of stuff came out of the neck of the carboy),
and about ten days ago I transferred the beer (1.010) to the secondary.
The beer is still quite cloudy with yeast in suspension. Has anyone used
this yeast before? The beer is in my basement (with an avg temp of ~60
degrees), and it shows no signs of wanting to clarify. Normally I have
no trouble with yeast settling out to give a nice clear beer, but I am
kinda perplexed with this yeast. Should I use gelatin to clarify it?


Many thanks for any advice,

a rather simple solution here would be to let the mash drain into a grant,
then use the pump to pick this up and either recirc or pump to kettle. by
turning pump on and off as the grant fills you can move the wort without
taxing the pump. some people using this method have even installed float
valves in the grant to automate it. you still would probably throttle the
puymp back but not to the trickle you thought and it would only be running
for small bits of time. doing this would als avoid the suction on the grain
bed that might develop if you attached your pump directly to the grain bed.
