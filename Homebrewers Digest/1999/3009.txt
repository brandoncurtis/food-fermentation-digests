From: "Dr. Pivo" <irv`at`wireworks.se>
Subject: WARNING!  extremely rude.


Phil Yates makes what I think are some very germane comments, and talks
about his own brewing:


>   This result has been achieved without the intense scientific input
> that Dr Pivo and Dave Burley seem to think is necessary.


and....


>  The technical and scientific knowledge of Dr Pivo and
> Dave Burley would seem beyond the scope of a lot of home brewers (myself
> included)




Regarding myself, I've actually forgotten far more about the technical
aspects of brewing than I presently retain in my head. Furthermore I
don't care much about it either.  If I have given these same impressions
to anyone else, then I have failed miserably at what I am trying to do.


Interested in brewing, I originally absorbed every single scrap of
brewing information that I came over.  Having worked in "the business",
it was pretty natural for me to think of beer in chemical terms. I
believed it, too.  After years of tramping around different traditional
breweries (where they had the beer I liked best) and fiddling around
with the process myself, I've come to realize that the bulk of this more
advanced information for the homebrewer, is derived from the modern
(principally American) brewing industry, and not only isn't always
relevant, but sometimes leads me 180 degrees from the taste direction I
want to head.


I post here occasionally, when I think I've got some alternative
experiences to the  "homebrewing book examples" that get repeated over
and over again here, until they become "truths" by sheer repetition.


When I post, I try and stear away from the biochemical terms that I
don't think are necessary for understanding the concept, and try and
keep the explanation of what I've found out is important things to look
at when making beer, in every- day language.


EVERY time I do this (and it is not often), someone jumps up with the
same tired "models" of explanation that have been floating around, laces
it with a few "buzz" words so that it sound authoratative, uses some
flawed circular logic to support their (already well known) point and
ENTIRELY miss the whole point of what I was trying to throw out.


These persons are predictably the same three: Al Korzonas (though I must
admit, Al must have gone through some stage of maturation that he is not
telling us about- he has been incredibly reasonable of late), George
DePiro, and Dave Burley.


If the topic seems a bit technical, I often pull it to the side, at
least where Al Korzona is concerned, as I get the impression that he
genuinely wants to know.  These other two guys are like a puppy with a
slipper in their mouth, that they absolutely will not let go of, and
they consider their literature as holy texts that should not be
questioned.


I truly do love "scientific principles", and by that I mean seeing
exactly what effects what. This rote recitation is not science,
however.  This is "literature search", and is what God made librarians
and graduate students for ;-).


The most amazing thing is that it is a library of about five books:


(Imagine the following scene, at the Ivory Tower of the University of
HBD, the wizened old professor talking to his graduate student.)


(curtain opens)


Professor: "I'm doing an article, better do a literature search on the
word "diacetyl" '.


Student:  "Should I look in DeClerck, Miller, or Fix?"


Professor:  "Better look in all three.  I'm on to something BIG!"




Does this scene seem amusing to anyone else?


If so, please donate a penney to the "lets teach Dave and George that
deductive reasoning is not a process involving the ego" campaign.


I generally don't respond when one of these lads passes down their
edicts in response to what I've written, and just figure folks can
figure out on their own what they care to believe (though there's lots
to wade through). What really sent me over the top, was when Dave talked
about an "acceptable level" of a chemical in lagers.  I happen to KNOW
that the most famous lager of them all, has 6 times Dave's "acceptable
level".  And how would I know that?  Because I got the number from the
guy who did the assay at the brewery.  And Dave also has some numbers. 
Written down by a guy who wrote a book on homebrewing, who copied it
from a sheet of paper, which was in turn copied from another.  I can
gaurantee you one thing.... that guy was not measuring it at the
brewery.


Well then "where" would Dave had gotten his "acceptable level" that he
reccommends all the world to follow?


It said so in his "book".


Isn't that just a tiny bit tragic.


I also tried to hint at the socio-economic reasons why these numbers
might be "under reported". You don't "admit" you're producing diacetyls,
at least not to an investor that is looking at export markets. They do
cause storage worries, at least for professional brewers, even if they
don't for George de Piro.


That Dave himself could not percieve this taste when he was in Plzen,
can have two possible explanations... If he was there prior to '92, or
after '92 got to drink from the original lagering tanks, I can well
understand how individual tastes got lost in that incredibly complex
brew that keeps jumping around on your tongue and changing complexion
and tone every second.  If he was there post '92, and drank in the big
beer hall at the brewery, that's the same filtered pasteurized stuff
that goes in the bottle, and could he not percieve it there, then he is
deficient when it comes to this particular perceptive parameter.  The
diacetyl levels themselves, by measurement, have ALWAYS been high.


And here I am again, getting wound into a technical discussion (will I
never learn).


What I guess inspired me to reply a last time on this topic, is that as
I scan the odd HBD, I notice the lack of some of the old posters that
actually had some new information to present.  I wondered where they had
gone.  As I went "off the edge" in replying to Dave Burley, I found out
where they are.  When I started getting private email coming in I found
out.  They're still out there lurking.... they just don't post anymore
because they don't want to debate every point with "the librarians".


Yep, they're "keeping them away in droves".


me too.


>  To this end I would

I couldn't agree with you more.  By the time I read Charley, I'm afraid
he didn't have much new for me, but I still thought it was a bloody good
read that I enjoyed immensely, because he seemed to have the same
attitude as I.... "This is bloody good fun, great to share the results
with friends, and you can figure out better and better ways to do things
as you go along".


I am sorry if this is considered offensive to the individuals I have
named, or others think it impolite or innappropriate that I have done
thus, but considering the contents of my private email, I would say at
least it represents a "democratic" opinion, and I am willing to be the
public "bad guy", for the ones that are shamed or bored into silence. 
This in contrast to the "GIGABYTES" worth of opinions that have been
poured out by a few individuals.

I wish that were true.  Unfortunately a great deal of it is practicing
the habits of Onan.  And should the warnings we heard as children about
the consequences of that particular habit be true, then there are folks
out there who have lost there sight a LONG time ago.

Subject: Exploding blimps and imploding kegs


Hi all,


In the last HBD, some people responded to Ron LaBorde's question
about water evaporating, citing hydrogen as the culprit in the
Hindenburg disaster.


Back in the May 1997 Air and Space Smithsonian magazine, there
was a nice story about how hydrogen was not the problem.  It was
the extremely flammable doped fabric that covered the airship.


If you care, check out
http://www.ttcorp.com/nha/advocate/ad22zepp.htm
for more info.  The original Air and Space article isn't
on-line, but this site summarizes it nicely.
- --------------------------------------------
Some people have asked how a Corny keg can implode,
because the popettes and lid should leak if there is
a vacuum.


"My kegs seal better than your kegs, nah nah nah nah"


Sorry.


Some of my kegs do seal quite nicely, while others spray
me with beer when I remove the tap line to clean them.  If
you fill a keg with hot water and it seals well, it can implode
upon cooling.


At the very least, you should pressurize the keg to prevent
the unwanted air from getting sucked in!  Kind of defeats
the purpose of all that work purging the air out of the keg
if you let it get sucked in.


While I'm talking about stupid brewer tricks, here's a
good one to avoid:


Never put caustic into a sealed tank that contains a
carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere.  The caustic *will*
(not "can," but "will") react with the gaseous CO2 to
form solid sodium carbonate.  "Big deal" you may say.
It is when you consider that solids take up much less
space than gasses.


Yes, you can implode a rather expensive fermentor
with this trick; the vacuum relief valve won't allow
enough flow to prevent disaster.  No, I have not
done this!


Have fun!

Subject: On widgets .....


I was served a can of Abbot Ale the other day at a friends, Brewed by Greene
King in England. The beer was ok.  It seems that the widget has been
re-invented.  Inside the can was a "Floating widget to give you pub draught
ale as it is served by the hand pump in England".. as it says on the can. It
looks like a small ping-pong ball.  New Technology?  My friend has said that
he has seen this in other beers, to improve the head or something. I don't
usually spend the money on high $ beers.  Are we going to start putting
ping-pong balls in our beers now?  (My kegs usually have all the foam you
can stand!!)  Anyone know how this works?

Subject: Sanitizing Question


Dear Folks,


Several recent posts have spoken about how soon Iodophor is lost as it
sits.  I assume that the same must be true about other sanitizers,
although at differing rates.


I am reminded of other posts in the past that advocate a sanitation
practice of leaving a sanitizing solution in the carboy (or bottles or
whatever) for weeks at a time, until the next batch is brewed or
bottled.  In light of the above, what would be the advantage of that?
Aren't you essentially just leaving it filled with water?  In fact,
wouldn't it be a disadvantage, since water at room temperature is a
better environment for bacteria than air?


In other words, after a few weeks soak in what used to be a sanitizing
solution, won't it be necessary to sanitize before using it again
anyway?  If so, wouldn't it make more sense to just wait until you are
ready to use it to sanitize?

Subject: Cold-conditioning Question


I recently made a British bitter and put the secondary carboy in the
refrigerator around 30 degrees for three or four days.  There were some
ice crystals that were left behind when I racked it to the keg.  When I
dispense it at cellar temperature (around 55-60 degrees) the beer has a
beautiful clarity.  If I dispense it colder, it has chill haze.


How long does one have to cold-condition to eliminate chill haze?  What
am I doing wrong?


Cheers
Ted

Brewsters:


Well, Brewsters, the vagaries of the internet have
befuddled me again. What I interpreted as Louis
Bonham's sinister silence and non-response to
my requests to get the ball rolling on the evaluation
of Clinitest he promised many months ago, was
due to the fact that Louis had changed his e-mail
address. He told me he notified us in the HBD,
which I somehow missed. There was an additonal
quirk in  that I had never received a "bad address"
from his old server whenever I sent him e-mail.
I presumed he was receiving my messages and
being non-responsive to my requests for a
schedule of events. 




Sorry, Louis, I  hope you understand my
frustration, that nothing tangible has been done
so far in all these months on evaluating Clinitest,
led me to assume incorrectly. I apologize for
my misinterpretation of what I perceived to
be an intentional act on your part.


The good side of it is that Louis is once again
actively involved in developing the protocol
with AlK and I. We will need some help in 


performing some analyses and Louis will
be asking for some volunteers.


I will be outatown for a week or so, so * I *am not

Alan McKay states:


"No offense intended or anything.  If that's what you're into

I am not one of the very scientifically enabled, but I don't have a problem 
with deep brewing science being discussed here. First of all, there is room 
for it, second, we can sometimes (albeit on the third or fourth read) learn 
something from these guys. Third, there's a personal quality control button 
on your keyboard called... well, you know.


The folks that get serious about brewing science do it because they are 
bringing an important part of their life into their hobby. Sounds like fun to 
me.


Yes, Phil, our beloved hobby is supposed to be fun. However, for some folks 
science just happens to be included in that big carboy o' fun we call home 
brewing.

I wrote:
The first word in the hop name tells where it was grown; the second is the 
variety.  So, it's no suprise that Hallertau Tradition is very different from 
Hallertau Northern Brewer.  They are two different varieties that both happen 
to be grown in Hallertau region.  


This is not quite right.  The hop commonly called Hallertau Tradition is a 
sub-variety of Hallertauer, and if grown in Hallertau would be properly named 
Hallertau Hallertauer Tradition.  Like Hallertauer Mittelfruh the name is 
frequently shortened.  Sorry if my previous posting created any confusion.

Possible Al, but I suspect they are referring to the dramatic increase 
in solubility of the hop beta-acids (see lupulone solubility vs pH M&BS 
pp 479) starting around pH 5.8 or so.  The beta-acids also isomerize 
into unstable products which are coarsely bitter.
- --
Al's comments to Matt who read a post of mine regarding the Fix mash 
schedule were on the mark too.  Not only is a mash thickness of 2qt/lb 
not too thin, but there is pretty good evidence that mashes as thick as 
1.5qt/lb are actually too thick. The unavailability of water (trapped by 
the starch) slows amylolysis.
 .--
How to solve Cap haze ?  Gillian Grafton of the UK HB web sight used to 
have a list of perhaps 30 methods of controlling haze - everything short 
of dancing naked 'round the fermentor under a full moon (a traditional 
British method) was listed.  Protein haze occurs as proteins, glued 
together by polyphenol bonds form "hazoids" which become large enough 
and prevalent enough  to cause visual turbidity, but still small enough 
to stay in solution.  Reducing the polyphenols as Al suggests removes 
some of the glue. Increasing the proteolysis makes the proteins smaller 
on average - which reduces the size of the hazoids enough to prevent 
turbidity.  Oddly INCREASING the amount of polyphenols present, 
increases the amount of glue and causes the excessively large hazoids to 
drop to the bottom of the tank.  IMO - reducing the polyphenols enough 
to prevent haze (assuming you are already practicing good lautering 
technique and aren't willing to give up hops)  is more difficult than 
reducing the large proteins - either by a short [low temp 137F-ish] 
protein rest or by a longer boil.  The boil selectively coagulates 
larger proteins and adding 30' to the boil is often simple way to reduce 
potential haze.


I'm personally reluctant to use fining agents and always prefer to try 
modifying procedures as a first resort, but PVPP/Polyclar and to a 
lesser extent gelatin will remove polyphenols nicely but must be used 
before the haze forms - the earlier the better.  Irish Moss has it's 
advocates as well.


I should note that my recent CAP, second ever, 1st w/ grits is still a 
little murky at 6 weeks. I need to adjust my CAP methods too.
- --
About carboy fermentors being less sanitary because the author has 
filthy messy blow-off problems [with his fermentor I mean]. His 
alternative to use a CLOSED plastic bucket which he cleans with a 
"non-abrasive scrubber".


Get rid of blowoff tubes and conduct primaries in a vessel big enough to 
handle the head space - whether a 7gal acid carboys or a pair of 5G 
carboys.  Buckets aren't a real solution since 5G of wort in a 5G pail 
is just as messy as in a 5G carboy.


"Non-abrasive scubbers" do exist (like 'Rhino' scrubbers) altho they not 
very common and something of a contradiction in terms. The common 3M 
green scrubbers will create scratches at least 7 microns wide (just 
tested one on a microscope slide) which is a great place for bacteria 
!!!  *NEVER* use these scrubbers in a fermentor -  plastic, glass or 
steel.  0.5u surface roughness is sort of an upper bound.


Anyone getting rid of those troublesome carboys can send 'em to me ;^)

fruit beer?  I am using wheat extract but reluctant to use a true wheat
wyeast wondering if it woud overpower the fruit with its bannana/clove
taste.  I really want the fruit flavor to shine through.  Any ideas?  I may
even try an Irish ale wyeast since it is supposed to have more fruitiness
to it.

Subject: oxygenating yeast starters


I just got an oxygenation system from Brewer's Resource.  I plan to
oxygenate 5 gallons of cooled wort for 30-60 seconds per their
instructions (to achieve 8mg/ml O2 per their experiments).  


Should I keep the O2 on longer to achieve higher levels of dissolved O2?


I will also oxygenate my yeast starters (500 mL and 2 L). How long should
I turn on the oxygen for these smaller volumes?  (At $8-$10 per bottle of
oxygen I don't want to use more oxygen than necessary)  


I wish I learned about this last year.  I worked in a lab and used DO
meters everyday.  I would have been posting data instead of asking
questions

In relation to sanitation and septic tanks, Mike Swintosky wrote:
"I have "heard" that soft water in general can, in the long run, negatively
impact the soil structure in a way that reduces the percolation rate.  Do we
have any experts out there that can lend credence to or negate this?"


This is getting a bit esoteric, but when sodium replaces calcium on the clay
exchange complex, the clay particles repel one another (disperse) rather
than attract one another (flocculate). This in turn causes soil aggregates
(i.e structure) to break down ultimately reducing water infiltration rates.
This is common mechanism for the failure of septic tank adsorption trenches
due to the high sodium content of domestic cleaners. It is most
spectacularly associated with soils that naturally have high ESP
(exchangeable sodium percentage) but over time most soils would succumb if
the doses of sodium were high enough and frequent enough. I suppose that
bleach used for sanitising home brew equipment could contribute, but it is a
load-based consideration. Doing the daily laundry is far more likely to do
more damage.

For my money, it's good value, and the folks that reside there are generous

Crisis alert! Can anyone help us get BEER OUT?




- ------------
Help!  We have a beer crisis.  


I brought 2 kegs of Bitburger Pils back with me from Germany (hey, I'm
allowed two pieces of carry-on luggage on the jet!!) which seemed like a
great idea at the time.  You know, being a beer hero with all the guys back
home and all that stuff. 


But anyway, for all those that didn't see this coming already, the taps
aren't the same as here in the USA.  Of course they aren't.  We can have a
DIN for jet fuel connectors worldwide, but not for beer.  Figures.  Anyway,
I was more concerned about getting the transatlantic flight clearance and
doing the preflight, instead of paying the necessary and critical attention
needed to the kegs.  So I'm guilty of being a dufus.  But hey, you quit
drinking for 12 hours before flying (you know, 12 hours bottle-to-throttle)
and see how coherent you are.


So, here is the problem.  100 litres of beer in the fridge, and no way to
get at it.  Rear Buccaneer has said he has a Swiss Army knife that could
take care of it, which is no surprise.  Problem is, once he has his arms
around a keg, you can't pry him off of it with the jaws-of-life. And Great
Balls of Fire has volunteered the tap in his house (1500 sq ft, with wall to
wall beer plumbing), but that's useless because he's on the wrong coast.


Does anyone out there know where I can get the connectors to tap these kegs
(besides Germany, thank you)?  Borrow or buy. We have the CO2, faucet, and
beer steins poised and waiting.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.

Subject: THE ELUSIVE DIACETYL




My very first post in this new found forum didn't go down so well with some
readers as I dared to suggest that getting too high tech was not necessarily
the answer to homebrew bliss. I had assumed that we were all enjoying our
hobby but apparently this is not the case. Never mind, for those of you who
do I suggest you keep on making great beer and let the rest of this stuff
fly right over your head! It ain't going to make you any happier and
probably won't make your beer any better. Okay, on to diacetyl.
Anyone who has read enough about the subject would surely agree that it is a
most elusive flavour compound. Worse still, the argument continues as to
whether it is a good thing or a bad thing to have in your beer. Even worse
again is that no one is too certain as to just how it tastes, is it honey or
is it a butter type flavour? The very first lager I ever made was done with
somewhat limited temperature control and in those days I was still bottling.
That very first lager had a distinctive buttery flavour which I later
learned was diacetyl. The last half of that bottled batch progressively lost
it's diacetyl character as time went on ( not much time, the beer was very
popular, diacetyl or no diacetyl)! I've never produced a beer with it since.
For that matter I've never tried. Personally I liked it but the beer without
it was also great. To this day I can not tell you why it appeared in that
particular brew. Dr Pivo says he experienced it off the coast of N.S.W. Or
was it running around the station in the ute? I can't quite recall what he
mentioned. The point is it is certainly very elusive and if you get it there
is no guarantee it will hang around for long. Similarly if you don't get it
there is no certainty it won't develop.
For those who still aren't sure if they have ever noticed it "on the nose"
or via the taste buds, rest assured there are more scientific ways of
detecting it. Colorimetrics is one method but probably gas chromatography is
more often used. Measuring free diacetyl is one thing but it is also
important to measure it's immediate precursor, acetolactate.
So what does this all mean to the home brewer? Not much in my opinion. I
still refer to my first paragraph.
For those that are still chasing this elusive beast. Let me at least say
that a friend of mine who knows far more than me about chemical matters is
working on producing "Diacetyl in a Bottle". Something you can simply pour
into your brew if you feel the need. I'm skeptical but he assures me he is
close to a result.
Hope I haven't upset you all this time.
Cheers, Phil Yates.

From: Philip J Wilcox`at`CMS on 04/19/99 08:40 AM


Dear Siebel and HBDers,


In wine analysis ebullometers usually come with a correction table for
wines with high extract (1). Or in brewing terms high terminal gravity.
Actually, extract in this context is measuring Total Disolved Solids.
(Residual sugars, dextrins, tannins, acids, ect.) The corrections used is
for every 1% extract (*P)you should reduce the ebullometrically determined
alcohol level by 0.05%.  A published table in (1 & 2) relates the gravity
(*P) of the wine with the measured alcohol level to get the % extract.
Knowing the  % extract and applying the proper correction you get a more
accurate measurement of alcohol % abv.


Can this method be applied to beer analysis?
And if so, how accurately?


I feel that compared with wines, the differences in beer's lower alcohol
levels and higher amounts of residual extract in --like sweet stouts,
porters and doppel bocks--might produce a significant amount of error. At a
minimum they are off the published charts


Is anyone aware of such a corrections calibrated for beer?
Or, has any research been done in this area?


What say ye????

But it still will boil dry, as I rediscovered last week while sanitizing a
nylon msh hop bag (for dry hopping) in a covered stainless steel pan of
shallow boiling water.  I think I was reading HBD with more than the usual
rapt attention, and the first hint I had of trouble was a burning smell.
Most of the bag had melted and some had charred.  I pulled off what I could
but my favorite spaghetti pot now has a nylon lining.  Any chemist types
have thoughts on how to get this off?  I tried strong NaOH since I had
that, but it didn't touch it.  My other next idea is a strong acid, but I
don't have any on hand.  My third idea would be to burn it off (outdoors)
with a propane torch.

There are two related issues I would like to comment on.  One, folks
interested in American beer history believe that both rice and corn have
been used as adjuncts since the American brewing revolution began. Using
rice in the formulation of an American style lager does not de facto
place it in the exact same category as Modern Premium American Lager
(aka Bud).  I actually did make a CAP recently with ~25% California
short rice, and while it was straw colored and quite subtle and dry, it
had appreciably more bitterness and hop aroma/flavor than modern mega
lagers.  I liked it.  Some judges even liked it, awarding it an MCAB
bearth over another CAP I had brewed with corn.  I love corn.  I have
been singing its praises for years.  Why would I make a beer with rice?
Seemed interesting and I wanted to see how it would taste (answer: see
above). 
Secondly, what makes one beer superior to another?  Well, I think it is
belief.   And it is likely that beliefs differ amongst individuals.
Personally, I even think my own beliefs change (daily, weekly, subject
to the weather and whether I am in the groove with some good funk
blasting out of my stereo).  What makes a beer "good" to one person, may
not be the same to another.  I would warrent a guess that some of the
millions of daily Bud drinkers would in fact prefer Bud to a well made
CAP.  Who is to say they are wrong?
