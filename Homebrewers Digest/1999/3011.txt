I hope I'm not repeating myself -- this sounds very familiar.


I'm not so sure this is right... if this were true, then wouldn't
the bubbles simply shrink away?  As I watch the head of a beer
fade, it seems that each individual bubble is popping, not shrinking.
Therefore, I don't see how the gas that is inside the bubble should
make a difference in how long the bubbles last.


Also, handpumped, cask-conditioned ales have no nitrogen associated
with the dispense.  In the north of England, where swan necks are
common and sparklers are used, the ale comes out of the pump looking
like cream and has a cascade just like Draught Guinness.  When the
cascade is over, a tight, creamy head is formed over a *relatively*
uncarbonated pint of ale.  No nitrogen was used in the dispense...
in fact, the proper way to use one of these pumps is to put the
glass up so the sparkler is at the bottom of the glass and is thus
almost immediately submerged by the ale.  So much for the notion that
some atmospheric nitrogen had something to do with the head.  By
the way, the heads on these "Northern Pour" beers are very fine-bubbled
and long-lasting.


Personally, I feel that the creamy head in Guinness is due to the
flaked barley and that the nitrogen is used simply as a propellant.
I've posted many times before how 75/25% N2/CO2 at 40psi looks
to the beer like 30psi of nitrogen (virtually insoluble) and 10psi
of CO2, but is forced out of the faucet as if there were 40psi of
CO2 behind the beer...


Which reminds me, how is it that the nitrogen ever made it to the
faucet?  Consider this:

                          ------------------




Now, since N2 is virtually insoluble in the beer, then the "dissolved
gasses" in the beer are really virtually 100% CO2.  I don't see how the
N2 can make it to the faucet until the keg is empty.


Right?

Subject: RE: imploding kegs


I thought I would comment about the imploding keg theory of George DePiro.
I have frequently filled kegs with near boiling water, transfered the hot
water with CO2 to another keg, and cooled the now empty, CO2 filled keg to
be filled from a lagered keg of beer.  Neither keg has ever shown any sign
of stress.  They have held the resulting low pressure although I can't say
some air hasn't leaked in.  I do know that the cooled, empty keg will draw
in beer for a while from the keg full of beer before CO2 need be applied to
the keg of beer.  I will, in the future,  make sure there is ample CO2 in the
empty keg just in case some air might leak in.  I doubt it could be enough
to matter, though.  As far as the full keg imploding, I don't think the water
will shrink enough on cooling and there is not enough air/CO2 space to cause
much of a problem on cooling.

I haven't done this either, but I've seen the results in a
serving tank at a nameless brewpub. Quite impressive,
unless you're the one paying to replace the tank.

To Al and Jeremy and whomever has experimented with
O2 absorbing caps.


Was there no difference because there was no evident oxidation
in the bottles? Or did you try to oxidize some bottles and got
equal oxidation with O2 and non-O2 caps?

Are you a Long Island Homebrewer interested in joining a Homebrew Club?
L.I.F.E. may be the club for you!
We are a bunch of local homebrewers (Queens, Nassau) who meet monthly at
a local brewpub to discuss and evaluate beer (and sometimes other
beverages).  Each month a speaker discusses a topic of interest and
samples are evaluated. There are several BJCP judges in the club and
homebrews are regularly evaluated.

HBDers,


I have recently gone to 10 gal. batches so would like to sell my 5.5 gal
plastic fermenter for a very reasonable price. I have used it for over a
year doing 5 gal. batches and it works great. I have taken extremely good
care of it and never even thought of putting something in it that might
scratch it. It is very easy to clean and allows you to harvest and reuse
your yeast!

Subject: astringency


Laurel writes:
>astringent - sulfates - calcium sulfate
 
I must disagree most strongly!  Calcium sulphate (aka gypsum) is *NOT*
astringent!  Sulphates are not astringent!  Others have posted that
sulphates are bitter.  They aren't bitter either.  Very slightly salty...
that's about it.  Taste it for yourself.  I have.


To get a feel for astringency (clearly, based on dozens of scoresheets
on my beers that I have gotten back from competitions, the most misunderstood
and misdiagnosed fault in beer), peel a dozen grapes.  Feed the peeled
grapes to your SO and you eat the skins... all at once.  *THAT'S* astringency!
While it may be difficult to get enough polyphenols from grape skins to
doctor a beer, you can go to a winemaking supply shop and buy some "grape
tannin."  I don't know how much you would need to add to a beer to get
a reasonable level of astringency, but I'm sure you can figure it out by
trial-and-error.


Please, please, let's put this "sulphate == astringency" fallacy to rest,
once and for all!!!  While we're at it, let's also kill the other great
fallacy: "dark grains == astringency."  Ironically, dark grains lower pH 
and make it *MORE DIFFICULT* to extract the astringent polyphenols from
the mash!


Incidentally, polyphenols are called "tannins" in lay terms because they
were (are) used to tan hides.

I want to publicly thank Dave Mercer for his informative
post re:Gott manifolds on March 12, and for patiently
answering my questions.


I have had a couple of near disasters with my 3/8" spiral
copper manifold, (-no- flow at all); Dave's post came just
in time. My construction was very similar, 1/2" rigid copper
tubing, sweat fittings(friction fit, no solder), same shape
and pattern. Last week it worked like a champ, lautering 24
lbs in a 10 gallon circular Gott, yielding 5 gallons each of
1.112 barleywine and 1.028 small beer.


Thanks, Dave!

Subject: re: Hop Oil & dead Sea Monkeys(tm)


Al (Al's such a good HBD contributor, no last name should be needed!)
posted about HopTech East Kent Goldings Hop Oil not contributing any aroma
to a IPA at recommended doasge.  I recently bought some of the British
Blend variety and just tried it in a glass of an APA.  Had the same results
Al did.  A sniff of the open bottle's top tells me the reason it doesn't
contribute much aroma.  Even a steeped and cooled hop tea adds much more
aroma than the stuff, is considerably cheaper and doesn't form what AL
termed as dead Sea Monkeys(tm).


I also tried the floral flavor late hop essence that's susposed to add hop
flavor.  Like the oil, I had to alot (haven't calculated with 4 drops in
the 4 oz. of APA is, but, I'm sure it's more than the 50 ppb recommended).
It also tasted like no hop I'd ever tasted before.  Maybe that's what
"floral" means?


Rather than risk dead Sea Monkeys(tm) in my septic tank if I pour the stuff
down the drain, I'm going to add them to the garlic potion I spray on fruit
trees for combating/pissing off Japanese beetles.  Since the stuff yields
very little smell or taste, the best I can hope for is that the beetles are
adverse to dead Sea Monkeys(tm).


>I guess it's better than if it looked like *live* Sea Monkeys ;^).


If the hop oil actually did that, the entertainment value might make the
waste of money less painful. <ironic grin>

Don't know for sure about plastic buckets, but no longer than a week or two
in a plastic 5 gal. cubetainer before it looses most of it's amber color.
Tightly stoppered, the stuff lasts a very long time in a glass container.
I store it between uses in a 5 gal. glass carboy and keep it topped up
water and iodophor.  In the last couple of years/12 or so brews.  I've used
about 1/3 of the 1 L bottle.   BTW, the vapor will corrode a typical rubber
stopper, so wrap the stopper in plastic liberated from a sandwich bag.

1/2 cp. brown sugar patted across the top of the meat,
1 bottle of Guiness poured around the corned beef
(not on ) so as to soak into the meat. Add potatoes

Subject: Chimay yeast & banana esters...


After reading the number of interesting posts recently about Wyeast
1214/Chimay yeast and the associated banana esters, I thought I'd relay my
experience. 


I cultured the Chimay yeast from a fairly fresh bottle. I used it to
ferment a tripel. After fermentation, there was a very strong banana
aroma/flavor, which was surprising to me given that I tried to reduce this
aroma/flavor by fermenting pretty cool (like 62F). This aroma/taste was
pretty overpowering and I ended up dumping most of the batch. 


Recently (about a year later) I went through my stock of old beer and
found the last bottle. I chilled it and sampled it. The beer was
completely different. It was crystal clear, had darkened
(reddened) somewhat, and had no noticable banana aroma/taste whatsoever.
It was past its prime, but was remarkably batter than the same beer was
when it was a month old. Although the recipe was different, the Chimay
notes that I like were there: the clove/spicy/plum.


I guess the moral of this story is that the 1214/Chimay yeast needs a
healthy aging period after bottling. Does anyone else have similar advice?

Subject: Bad science


There has been some discussion on how some people view the HBD as being
very scientific, to the point of being too scientific for some.


Here's a counter view: the HBD hardly qualifies as science at all, and what
science we do see is often bad science.


Good science requires the testing of theories and speculation with
experiments.


Good science requires an open mind.


Good science realizes that correlation does not imply a causal effect --
the difference between observational data and randomized experiments.


Bad science attempts to discredit data to fit a theory.


Bad science is the broad generalization of a specific result.


An example of bad science: the ongoing "debate" between Al K and Dave
Burley regarding a test for sugars.


An example of good science: the experiment that is now being undertaken by
the above mentioned.

It has obviously been quite some time since you have
tried (at least) Murphy's.  If you were to set a pint
of draught or canned Guinness, a pint of draught or
canned Murphy's and a pint of Mackeson's in front of
you, I'm 100% confident that you would group the Guinness
and Murphy's to be similar and the Mackeson's to be
*many* times more sweet.

I've posted several times to the HBD (once less than a year
ago) that bottled Guinness is a completely different
recipe (it's a 1.050 beer, versus 1.042) than the draught
and canned version.  In the Caribbean, they make a 1.070-ish
version which is *very* sweet!  These are three different
beers, not just a different sweetness/bitterness ratio.


What I still don't understand is why you would write more
than 100 lines of text when you could have simply written:


"Ooops... I was wrong."


Just kidding, Dave... I did find the stout recipe guidelines
very interesting.  Is "Malt Stout" really "Dry Stout" or is
it an entirely different style altogether?


My books are only 25 miles away and I'm going to be sleeping
in the same house with them tonight... the question is: which
one of the 700+ boxes (90 boxes full of beer and 45 boxes of
empties!) are they in?

Subject: Carbon Dioxide Purge


FWIW- Today, I tried an experiment that worked rather nicely.  Perhaps 
others might like to try it.


I began with a very actively fermneting batch of red wine.  By using an 
inverted bucket type air-lock and attaching a piece of surgical tubing 
to it (removed the bucket), the carbon dioxide being genratewd was 
diverted into a carboy.  However, the carboy was fitted with a cap which 
has two stems or ports.  A piece of tubing was inserted into one of 
these ports from the inner side and allowed to extend to the bottom of 
the carboy.  The surgical tubing from the the fermenter is attached to 
the other port.  The carboy was sanitized, then filled with clean water 
clear to the brim.  Another piece of tubing is attached to the outside 
of the port which has the tube inside going to the bottom of the 
carboy.  By lying the carboy on its side, the pressure required to force 
the water out can be reduced.  A small hole cut into the exit tube at 
its highest point prevents siphoning.  In about 3 hours, I had a carboy 
full of carbon dioxide and all of the water was now in a bucket.  I can 
now use this carboy for racking off a batch of beer or wine or whatever.
The same process should work while fermenting beer.  By the time your 
beer is ready to rack the first time, your secondary fermentor will be 
nicely purged.  I reckon the same could be done at bottling time.


My primary fermenter is a plastic bucket with lid and grommet.


Anyway, It works for me.

I checked out Brewing Techniques web page and found and interesting article
describing an brewing experiment (sorry can't remember the Title at the
moment, but I'm sure many of you are aware of this study since the
participants were from HBD).


Anyway, I poked around with the data and found conclusive evidence that
contaminated samples were caused by force carbonation.  Perhaps this has
already been discussed and I am re-iterating old news, I'm not sure.  About
half of the naturally carbonated samples were contaminated, but all of the
forced carbonated samples were contaminated.  I think this suggests that the
CO2 cylinders might be contaminated.  Perhaps a ultrafine filter is on
order.

Belgian beer cafes are famous of their unpredictable opening
times especially in summertime. Any guide will be outdated in
six months and that is why I take A Selective Guide To Brussels 
Bars (and beyond) by Stephen D'Arcy to be the most up to date
and reliable guide available. Tim Webb's book is the second
best because it's informative brewery and beer notes (with an
attitude). Third book that is a must during a vist in Belgium
is Peter Crombecq's Bierjaaboek 1995-1996, although it is
outdated it contains so much backlog information of beers
and breweries from the last 10 years. And yes, the final word
CALL AHEAD if you want to be sure.


>Personally, I would rather trust Peter Crombecq's website:

Also that page is outdated but has couple of years worth
of updates to the printed Beerjaarboek. And of course
every serious beer traveller has that database imported
to their Psion 5 :-).


You might also consider the book The Beers of Wallonia: 
Belgium's Best Kept Secret by John Woods & Keith Rigley.

Subject: RE: Hop Oil as a preservative?


You could always use a very small amount of low alpha hops, which should
produce barely discernible hop character.


How about just making it without hops at all? If it could be done 500 years
ago, I'm sure that it can be done now. Unless you are planning on storing
the ale in less than ideal conditions for long periods, I cannot imagine any
problems. I also believe that some of these old ales were quite sour
affairs, so lack of hops may be an advantage.


Other (old English type) herb additions could also help, instead of the
hops.

P.S. I'm no expert in old English ales, this is just info I have gleaned

I've read somewhere that CO2 dissolved in beer (or any liquid?) causes

If it is produced when CO2 is dissolved in any liquid, would this be the

Rod Prather mentions UK hop substitutes
" . . .   Those he mentioned are spruce, broom, rowan (?) and myrica.   . . ."


Spruce you already know about.
Broom is an evergreen shrub (ie doesn't lose its "leaves" in winter), growing to
about 5 or 6 feet high.  It doesn't so much have leaves in the conventional
sense as long spindly fairly solid "shoots" about 10 inches long.  In spring (ie
about now for us the middle of the UK) it has lots of little yellow flowers.
Rowan is also called mountain ash (sorbus aucupuria), and grows into a small
tree.  From memory, the leaves are narrow and about an inch long, with say 5 or
6 sprouting off each side of a soft stem.  It produces bunches of bright orange
berries in autumn.
Myrica I'm not sure about, but could be bog myrtle, something which I remember
used to be added to beers, although I've not seen any.


Something else that used to be added to English beers was alecost (also called
costmary, or bible leaf), which, according to my herb book, grows wild in mid
and east coast USA (a bit of a sweeping statement, I know)

<Chemgeek alert>
When CO2 dissolves in water at 25C it is partly
hydrated by H2O to carbonic acid, H2CO3 (or (HO)2CO). 
For the equilibrium H2CO3 <-> CO2 + H2O, K =
[CO2]/[H2CO3] = ca. 600.  Which means CO2 would rather
be CO2, than H2CO3.  From a table in 'Chemistry of the
Elements', Greenwood and Earnshaw, 1984, p. 54, the
pKa of carbonic acid is 3.9, but corrected for the
fact that only 0.4% of dissolved CO2 in in the form of
carbonic acid, the conventional value is pKa = 6.5. 
For comparison, the pKa of acetic acid is, pKa = 4.75.
 Using the 'conventional' value of pKa = 6.5, carbonic
acid is a weaker acid than acetic. However, at higher
pressures of CO2 the equilibrium would be shifted
toward H2CO3 and acidity would increase.  Keggers must
have a better knowledge of the effects of PCO2 on the
flavor of beer, but fizzy beer always tastes different
than flat beer to me.

Subject: Re: Hop oil as a preservative


Badger asks about attaining preservative qualities like 
those we get from hops, but without the hops.


I talked with John Cater, owner of a microbrewery here in 
Birmingham, who said that rosemary had many of the same 
antibacterial qualities of hops.  He has studied 
microbiology, I believe at UC Davis, though I don't know 
the source of his comment.  The conversation was in the 
context of a 14th century English mead and metheglyn recipe 
that called for rosemary, among other herbs, and he noted 
that the rosemary would have provided some preservative 
qualities.


Another preservative common in the Middle Ages was alcohol. 
Ales tended to be stronger than beers are today, and the 
alcohol helped keep bacterial infection at bay.


That said, I've got to quibble with Badger's assertion that 
hops were unknown in England before the Dutch introduced 
them in beer.  Hops are mentioned in England as early as 
the 10th century in Bald's Leechbook.  Though they were not 
the brewing staple they are today, they were known in 
England and likely found their way into the occasional brew 
along with the various other herbs that formed the gruit.  
Additionally, beer is not a Dutch loan word, but rather a 
native Germanic one used interchangably with ale in some of 
the earliest Old English texts.  The distinction between 
ale (hopless) and beer (hopped) is a late distinction, 
after the Dutch began importing weaker, hopped beer.  At 
this point the English became opposed to hops in beer, not 
because of the hops themselves, but because of the weaker 
beer they allowed the Dutch to brew.

How about iodophor?


I mean, if you don't want your beer to spoil, then keep things clean and 
sanitized. I'm sure hops were recognized as a preservative back when
people had no idea about bacteria and sanitization. Your beer won't
spoil simply because there are no hops.

Yes, CO2 is acidic. Acutally, when it dissolves in water, it forms a weak
acid called carbonic acid. 


Incidentally, this tartness is appropriate in some styles. Bavarian
Weizen comes to mind. It often has a slight tartness from high
carbonation levels.

Thanks to Rod Prather for sharing his contact with a Scottish
beer historian regarding the lack of peat used to malt barley for
beer in Scotland. 


For my tastes, I think that a subtle smokiness would complement
the rich malt flavors of a wee heavy if it could be achieved. 
Unfortunately, I've never found the peat smoked malt to leave a
subtle flavor. It is always harsh in the beers I've tried. Maybe
others have had better luck.

Subject: Re:  btu's on a 55 gallon drum / Brew Rat Chat (Big Brew)


Hiya, 


First of all why would any sane Homebrewer ever want to convert 55
gallon drums into a brewing system is beyond me. 


So here is what I do (Note I am not giving a formula but practical
experience from what I have done):


I usually Fill my HLT the night before and fill my Mash/Lauter Tun
with the correct amount of water also. This helps the water reach at
least room temp before I apply any heat. 


I begin heating my HLT and Mash Tun in the morning while I begin to
get the grain bill together. I also use 170,000 BTU Brinkman burners;
my poor little CampChef (38,000 BTU) burners just can not handle a
full boil and really drag as far as getting up to temp is concerned. 


I really would not even attempt to boil wort in a 55 gallon drum with
anything under a 120,000 BTU burner. The 38,000 BTU CampChef seems to
really fart out around 18-22 gallons. 


By the time I get the 80-100 pounds of grain ground my strike water
is usually right up to the temp I need. 


Someone mentioned making sure that the burner is on cement. That is a
great point. You should also keep in mind that CampChef says that
their burners are only rated to hold about 179 pounds. Keep that in
mind and 


NEVER PUT A FULL 55 GALLON DRUM ON YOUR BURNER FOR SUPPORT. 


At 8.3 pounds a gallon (roughly) and the weight of the drum itself
that is suicide. 


I am currently using cinder blocks as stands until I build the damn
thing into a permenant home in my basement with natural gas and steam
hood. 


As far as mash temps. I have had little or no trouble holding a
steady mash temp as long as my grain bill is over 70 pounds. The more
grain and surface area inside the drum that is filled the better the
thermal mass I get (makes sense I guess).


If anyone is interested I have scattered pics on my site of the 55
and its mash screen and stuffs:


http://skotrat.dynip.com/skot/equipment


May I ask what you guys are using as chillers? How do you achieve a
quick chill time with a 40-50 gallon batch? 


Also, What are you fermenting in? 


**********************************************


Now, about the Brew Rat Chat being used for Big Brew. 


I have not heard back from Brian at the AOB as of yet. I would love
to do it. I think that the Brew Rat Chat would be a fine place to
have it and I would feel truly happy to host it there. The chat also
allows you to post standard .GIF and .JPG images on the fly if they
have been uploaded to the web. 


So it could be visual also. Hell If you have a WebCam I will even
post a link to it if you would like. 


Looking forward to hearing Brian's comments on the matter and anyone
elses for that matter. 


Guys like Brian are trying to make the AHA/AOB work and Big Brew is
proof. Hell even I can't find anything to bitch about on this one. 


C'ya!

Cook on high for 2-4 hours, reduce heat and simmer for 4-8 hours.  Then fry up
the bacon, crumble and add.  Salt to taste.


Yummy stuff!


Last night I tried to brow-beat the wife into adding a beer to the pot roast.
She only added half a beer (porter).  It was so delicious, she said she'd add
a whole beer next time.  Good thing she didn't listen to me the first time!


A personal note to George De Piro, Al Korzonas, Dave Burley, Dr. Pivo, AJ,
Steve, Mr. Gump, the lurking xpurts Dr. P says are out there, tired of
defending against textbooks:


Don't go away.  Don't go changing.  Post your thoughts.  Quote your texts.
Name call if you feel the need.


Hell, where's Sammy Mize and NOKOMAREE?


It's all good!


Well, MOST of it.
