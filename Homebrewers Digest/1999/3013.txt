Both shapes are pretty much the same regarding the quality of the finished
beer.  The "optimal" grain bed is said to be 18", but this is from
a commercial brewing text.  I've gotten great results from grain beds
as shallow as 6" and as deep as 24".  You have to be more careful when
it comes to adding the sparge water (in a fly (continuous) sparge) in
a shallow grain bed so you don't disturb the filter bed.  Incidentally,
recently someone posted "set the filter bed" when they meant "establish
the filter bed."  A "set mash" in brewerspeak is a "stuck runoff" so
"setting the filter bed" would be a bad thing.

I did an experiment on this back in 1995 (see 1995 Special Issue of
Zymurgy) and found that there is very little difference between various
false bottoms when it comes to efficiency.  The decision on which to
use really comes down to personal preference.  I've never heard from
any brewer that said "when I switched to X from Y my yield increased Z%!"
I've brewed with Zapap, grain bag, manifold, perforated metal,
Phil's Phalse bottom and an Easymasher(tm).  I prefer the Easymasher
quite simply because of simplicity and ease of cleanup.  Oh, and it
requires the least recirculation.


Disclaimer: I do market a product that could be used to make an easymasher,
but I tried all the systems and stayed with a real Easymasher(tm) long
before I went into business.

If you don't already know what water the original recipe used, find out.
Also, you can't follow recipes blindly... if it tastes like it has too
much sulphate, reduce your sulphate on the next batch.  It could take
multiple batches to tweak a recipe to your system and water.  A good
recipe should say "high sulphate" or "low sulphate" or "low bi/carbonate"
if this is important.


> -different supplier of malt or a different batch


A good recipe should specify the brand of malt.  Lot-to-lot differences
shouldn't be the difference between "prize winner" and "slug bait."


> -different supplier of hops or a different batch or different storage of the
>hops


This could make a difference, but use your head.  Don't buy crappy hops
stored in non-O2-barrier bags.  Consider the recipe... if it's an American
Pilsener with 4 ounces of allegedly 4% hops in 5 gallons, something is
wrong with the hops or the brewer didn't give you the real recipe.  I
once judged fruit beers at the 2nd round of the AHA National Competition.
I was the Zymurgy technical editor at the time.  When I saw the recipe,
I knew that the hopping was wrong... either the hops were crappy or the
brewer intentionally changed the recipe.  I told the managing editor to
check with the brewer and it was not a typo.  I calculated something like
50 IBUs in a beer that my tastebuds tell me had no more than 20.


> -different age (storage) of yeast


If you make a big, healty starter, you should get good performance 
from even old yeast.  The recipe should mention the starter size.  It's
true, however, that if you pitch a liter starter and the original was
made with 50ml from a Wyeast package you'll get far fewer esters and
higher alcohols.  This could be a problem (e.g Weizen, Belgian, etc.) or
an improvement (lagers).


> -and (IMO) most inportant: differences in equipment and operating procedure
>(accuracy in weighing, temperature, time).


Well, yes, there will be differences in the beers produced, but the
difference shouldn't be "prize winner" and "slug bait."  They should
be two slightly different beers, both of "prize winning" caliber.
One exception to this rule is if one brewer used blowoff or skimming
and the other didn't.  There will be as much as an 18% difference in
bitterness which could seriously change the balance of the beer.  This
should be specified in the recipe, but it rarely is.  You should know
if you guessed wrong on the first sip of the finished beer.

I do appreciate Dave including the "others disagree" part.  As stated,
while I side with those that disagree, I can appreciate Dave's position.
 
Also, Dave writes:

Well, actually, Clark asked whether or not it's okay to pour hot wort
into cold water.  While I agree with Dave that pouring hot wort through
a strainer (or splashing hot wort in general...) will lead to problems,
I have long recommended to beginners to *GENTLY* pour hot wort into cool
water.  Mind you, this is *NOT* through a strainer... I suggest the use
of a hop bag so you can *GENTLY* remove the hops (even pellets) from
the wort before pouring.  Also, I try to be specific that this method
is really for a wide-mouthed fermenter... pouring through a funnel is
likely to aerate the hot wort too much.

It might match the descriptions well, but I don't believe that the
descriptions have been accurate.  None of them have mentioned DMS,
which I feel is present in all the best Koelsches I tasted in Koeln.
I like Goose Island's "Summertime" which is billed as a Koelsch,
but if I was given it blind and asked to pick what style it is, I don't
think that I would say Koelsch... I think I'd say "Blonde Ale."


Koelsches are grainy, rather assertively bitter and crisp.  Their balance
starts out slightly bitter and rises towards the finish.  There were some
without the mild DMS aroma, but these were the blander ones.  The
best, in my opinion (Gaffel, Peters, Reissdorf, Gilden, Muehlen and
Paeffgen) had an unmistakable DMS aroma, not unlike that of a mash
tun full of spent Pilsner malt.  Really!

I think he's referring to Scotch Broom.  It's a non-native plant 
around here,
but has basically 'infected' every single square mile in Oregon.  To 
me, it
looks somewhat like sage brush, but has nice flowers (usually yellow) 
in the
Spring.  I have no idea if this is the plant he's referring to, or 
whether it
is something anyone in his/her right mind would want in a beer, but 
maybe
it's a lead you could look into a bit further.


Good luck ... if you _want_ some Scotch Broom, let me know.  I can 
send you 
all you want!

Subject: hop-free beer / beer maturation


Hi all,


Badger is trying to recreate a historical recipe
(quelle surprise!)  He wants to make an ale without
hops, but is concerned that it will not keep well
without the preservative effect of the hops.  He
therefore searches this tome for knowledge of
extracting the preservative quality of the hops
whilst leaving behind the aroma, flavor and bitterness.


Modern Lambic brewers use hops that are aged
for a few years, supposedly to do just that.  I have
always wondered why a Lambic brewer *cares*
about preservative qualities, though, which leads to
the following thoughts:


I believe that the preservative quality of hops is
entirely overrated.  A plethora of organisms will grow
in the presence of hops (George Fix talks about
common brewing bacteria in his book _Principles
of Brewing Science_ and not a single organism is
said to be well-inhibited by hops).  Wort is quite
easily infected, as we all know from personal
experience, despite the hops.  I think you could
safely brew a beer without hops with no worries,
as long as you are careful about your sanitation
(as you should always be).  The lack of microbial
knowledge spoiled the beers of our brewing
ancestors more than the lack of hops.


Jeff Renners Domesday ale was brewed without
hops, relying on the astringency of the oat malt to
balance the sweetness.  It was not noticeably
infected when I tasted it at the MCAB.  Theres
one real-life data point for you.
- ---------------------------------------
Tony is satisfied with his newly found kegging
knowledge and has moved on to questions about
beer maturation.  He wonders if he can keg beer
and refrigerate it after just 7-10 days of fermentation,
and if yeast will aid the maturation process
at cold temperatures.


You can keg beer that is very young, but you
risk off-flavors if you get too much yeast into the
final package.  I often keg my Hefeweizen
straight from the fermenter, but if I leave it for
too long, even at cold temperatures, it starts to
develop an annoying yeasty note (after 3 months
or so).


In my experience, the manner in
which your beer will best mature depends on many
things, including yeast strain, alcohol content, and
aroma and flavor characteristics.  If the beer
tastes "done" out of the primary, then go ahead
and package and refrigerate it (after getting rid
of the excess yeast and perhaps even settling
some of the chill haze).


The chemistry of beer maturation is not well understood.
What is known is that chemical and biological reactions
occur faster at higher temperatures.  Some lager
breweries use this idea to try to speed the maturation
process.  They will keep the beer relatively warm
(fermentation temperature) for a time (a week or so)
before chilling it to near freezing to form chill haze and
settle the yeast.  These brewers may only keep the beer
cold a short time, or they may lager it longer.


Other brewers opt for the more traditional long, cold
lagering, insisting that it gives the beer a smoother,
more desirable character.  The yeast do keep working
at cold temperatures, but they are greatly inhibited and
maturation will take longer.


The method you use is entirely up to you.  Experiment
with split batches and keep good tasting notes.
A few pointers from my own experience:


Warm maturation will help reduce beers youthful
characteristics quickly. Of course, a period of cold
lagering is useful to settle yeast and chill haze
after a week or so of warm storage.  Any beer
that requires good clarity must be aged cold until the
chill haze settles or is filtered out.


I would not store most beers above 50F (10C) for more
than a couple of weeks.  I recently had to do just that
and the results were quite interesting:


3 beers were brewed within a week of each other (a stout,
an IPA, and a brown ale) and held at ~50-55F (10-12C)
for 3-4 weeks.  The evolution of the beers flavors was
remarkable in its speed.  Unfortunately, the IPA did not
survive this unplanned experiment very well.  What started
as an incredibly estery, citrusy assault has aged into an
earthy tasting beer with about 60 IBUs of bitterness behind
the soil.  Not too pleasing.


The brown ale went the other way, displaying a bit of
chalkiness in the finish (probably due to the large quantity
of cocoa powder I tossed in the kettle) and has now aged
out pretty nicely.  I do get a bit of an autolysis note in the
brew, but nobody else does so maybe Im just crazy...


The stout survived very well, changing very little
throughout its life thus far.  So much for the idea that
full-flavored beers age poorly...(this stout has an OG
of 1.056 and used a bit too much roasted malts for its own
good, but is still pretty tasty).


I realize this went beyond Tonys query, but heck, maybe
somebody found it useful.


Have fun!

Subject: IBU tests


Hi all,


A question for the chemically knowledgeable:


I performed a bunch of IBU tests on various beers
recently.  Almost every sample had an assay value
higher than predicted (substantially higher).  The Coors
Light I ran as a standard actually came out a bit on the
low side (I was expecting 9.25 and got 7).  The low
"standard" can be explained by an old beer.  The
high values on the sample beers are more difficult
to explain.


The beers tested were of various ages, the youngest
being a yeasty Hefeweizen (sampled from the primary)
and the most mature being a lightly filtered beer that is
on-line at a popular NYC brewpub.


Are there interfering substances that could affect the
results of the asay?  Can the presence of yeast adversely
affect the assay?


I used the ASBC method in which the beer is mixed
with double the volume of iso-octane with 1 mL of
1 N HCl and 50 uL of octyl alcohol.  The absorbance
of the organic phase is measured at 275 nm.


I have to say that this method does not seem to yield
results that are precise enough for the pharmaceutical
industry (which is what I am used to).
The standard "Coors Light" was run in duplicate
and the replicates differed by about 0.7 IBUs (10%).
That's quite atrocious!  I may not be a great chemist,
but I am capable of producing reporducible assays.


What gives?


Have fun!

Subject: old CO2 regulator


Long time lurker, first time poster:


I am about to get into kegging. I acquired an old CO2 regulator that was
used for a soda fountain setup. I know that it hasn't been used in at least
4 years. Should I even bother with it? It's brass, and the brass is not in
great shape (some corrosion). Should I worry about it contaminating the CO2
and thus the beer? I plan to take it to a welding supply/repair shop to
have it tested. It probably works, but I'm still worried about the inside
of it being dirty or contaminated. Anyone use a filter on their CO2 line?
What about check valves? Anyone use them? This regulator came with several
check valves (also in bad shape). I like to know everything about
everything, so I would appreciate any and all information you have.


Also, does anyone know of any companies that sell regulators and related
equipment for kegging (like check valves, hose fittings, ball and pin quick
disconnects)? I have heard of Foxx Equipment, do they have a web site? Any
advice on acquiring a CO2 tank? 


Thanks in advance,

For those of us more familiar with mg/dL units, multiply by 18.  His BGL
went from a fasting 74 to 126 w/in 30 minutes of dringing the beer dextrins
implying consumable sugars are present.


In the paper I oft refer to - (EBC #12, 1969, B.S.Enevoldsen of Tuborg
Brewing) makes a fermentable fort w/ about 20% of extract as dextrins.  He
is able to convert almost all of these dextrins into maltose and maltotriose
using the two enzymes pullulanase and beta-amyase which break selective 1-4
and 1-6 glycosidic links.


Humans have alpha-amylase and intestinal alpha-(1-6) glucosidase, which
break the 1-4 and 1-6 links with less discrimination.  So there is good
support for Dr.Pivo's result.


Most beer dextrins will convert to blood glucose.


For the several people who asked me about creating low dextrin beer -
About 16% by weight of the Tuborg wort's dextrins were degradable to
fermentables using beta-amylase.  You might get a bit higher figure by using
alpha-amylase.  To get truly low residual dextrin levels you will need to
find a way to crack the 1-6 glycosidic links.

Subject: CO2 and contamination


Hi folks:


Brook Raymond notices a possible correlation between force carbonating and
contamination rates in the data from the HBD Palexperiment, and hypothesizes
that contaminated gas cylinders might be the culprit.  To answer one of his
alluded questions, to my knowledge Brook's the first person to notice this
possible relationship in our data.  [This is exactly the kind of hypothesizing
that I had hoped collecting the mountain of data in the Palexperiment would lead
to.]


Now, is this correlation real or just a statistical fluke?  To test Brook's
hypothesis, one would need to test it directly; i.e., do you actually get any
contaminating organisms from your gas bottle / regulator / gas hoses (potential
contamination could be anywhere in the rig, but probably are most likely to be
on the inner surfaces of the gas hose, IMHO).  One way to test this would be
would be to use the ASBC test for compressed brewery air -- put 200 ml of 0.85%
saline or 0.5% peptone solution in a 500ml flask with a two hole stopper, fitted
with a long glass tube going to the bottom of the flask in one hole and a short
tube in the other.  All of this -- flask, solution, tubes, etc. -- must be
*sterile* (not just sanitized), so dig out the ol' pressure cooker.  Now hook up
the gas bottle / regulator / hose to the long tube and bubble some gas through
the solution (the ASBC MoA calls for 10 cubic feet of air, but I suspect that a
30 second shot of CO2 would be sufficient).  Now run this solution through a
sterile 0.22 micron membrane filter, and aseptically transfer the membrane to a
plate of UBA (Universal Beer Agar), TSA (Tryptic Soy Agar), or for that matter
even just plain old wort agar, incubate at 30C, and see if anything grows.   You
could, of course, transfer a colony of whatever grows to a plate of LMDA and see
if that helps identify the bug.


Anybody game for this?  I've got a load of sterile 0.22 micron membrane
filtration units (you need an aspirator or vacuum pump to use them), and I'd be
happy to provide some of them free to anyone who'll do the experiment and report
back to us.  [I'd be interested to do  this experiment myself, but at present
between doing the Clinitest experiment, the alcohol determination experiments
(along with AJ, Dave Whitman, and Bill Frazier), and several others I'm trying
to finish up, I probably shouldn't take on yet another experiment right now!]

Neither, or both, sort of.  Until recently I considered rapid oxidation to
be my biggest problem--my beers quickly lost their hop aroma and the malt
would become a bit harsh quite soon or even always taste that way.  A shift
towards kegging and the RIMS seems to have solved these problems, since I
have made few other changes to my procedures.


My experiment was simple, and I think the one suggested by Al: simply
bottle half with the PureSeal A caps, half with regular caps.  I would then
often try to drink the beer with my wife so that I could pour 2 bottles at
the same time (one of each of course).  A little stealing of hers for
comparison when first poured never revealed a difference.  I kept a couple
of bottles of each for quite a while in an attempt to see a difference
that, while possibly not important to me, might at least indicate that
there was some effect of the caps.  I found none.


Qualifiers:
1) The hop aroma seemed to last longer on that batch than typical, so maybe
there was less O2 to absorb. 2) Maybe O2 was never the problem. 3) Maybe
the caps were mishandled (I did not sanitize them at all).

I regularly use 208*F water to fill and sanitize Corny kegs at the brewery,
and they will not implode if allowed to cool. In addition, even if the keg
were filled hot and then emptied, the keg still wouldn't implode because the
seal on the lid is designed to hold pressure, not vacuum--the lid seal would
leak, acting as a anti-vacuum valve.

I would suggest not using the hop oil, or anything else.  If your beer did 
spoil because of no hops, would that not be more authentic?  I would think 
your beer would be less likely to spoil anyway.  I would guess that you are 
using more sanitary techniques than the brewers prior to 1500 were using; so 
you should have less spoilage bacteria, undesirable yeast, etc. in your beer 
than they had.  Also, I would guess you have less starch (food for spoilage 
organisms) in your beer than they had due to modern malting and brewing 
techniques.

No way in h&)(* is there "Conclusive" evidence. I'd be suprised if there were

thiers filled at. If the CO2 for force carbonating were a spoilage factor alot
of  commercial beer would be bad. (Those that dont pasturize anyway)  In the
breweries I have worked at or toured the beer is carbonated after it is filtered
(Sterile filtered in some breweries) Using Brooks theory this would introduce
spoilage organisms just before packaging. It just doesnt happen that way.  Now
if Brook wants to say that the techniques we homebrewers use to force carbonate
cause infections then he has some wiggling room, but there is no evidence of
that in the Great Pale Ale Experiment.  I have often wondered how clean my CO2

Few will argue that the HBD is a scientific forum.  It is not.  
Surprised? I am not.


I personally do not have the time or interest to prove, using the 
scientific method, that a glass of water becomes sweet when sugar 
is added to it.  I am satisfied to let my experience tell me this is the 
case.


If I use different yeasts in my brews and notice different flavor 
profiles, do I need to prove that this repeatable result is caused by 
the yeast?  It repeats for me, I get the result I want, and it will 
repeat for others I share my experience with. 


Experience...Experience...focus on that word...and contrast it 
with opinion.


Many of the HBD regular contributors we have learned to think of 
as friends (even though we may not have ever communicated with 
them directly) are sharing repeatable experiences with the rest of 
us.  If they had tried to prove scientifically each and every 
experience, they would probably not have developed to the point 
they are at today. In many cases they cite references, who have 
taken the time to prove certain things...all the better if they do.  
But the sugar water will still be sweet, or the yeast strain will still 
impact the flavor of the nectar, regardless


Science and Art both can contribute to successful brewing 
experiences.  Positive (and negative) experiences can help others 
improve their skills.  Many HBD contributors have solid scientific 
backgrounds and while they do not (usually) flaunt them, this 
wealth of scientific knowledge and understanding strongly impacts 
the content of their postings.


If we are going to target anyone, let's focus on those who operate 
in the world of opinion, frequently expressing thoughts that are 
based neither in science or experience, but simply speculation for the 
sake of it.

While rousing the yeast by transferring to a secondary would help
lower the FG for some highly-flocculent yeasts, I'm skeptical
that an open fermenter provides the wort with significantly more
oxygen, unless the lag time is excessively long.  Presumably
the wort is not being sloshed around, so the only oxygen that
is dissolving is that which is directly dissolving in the calm
surface of the wort.  If properly pitched, fermentation should
begin within 8 hours (I typically have fermentation within 8
hours for a liquid yeast starter and within 6 hours when I pitch
fresh, rehydrated dry yeast).  How much oxygen can dissolve
in calm wort like this?  AJ?  Can you try this experiment?
(AJ's the only one I know who has a DO meter handy at all times.)


Oh, and AJ, please take my advice and de-aerate your test water
as I suggested earlier: gently pour boiling water into a Corny and
pressurise with nitrogen so the cooling doesn't draw a vacuum.

Not exactly... there is another factor.  A few years ago Charlie
Scandrett posted a very detailed description of all the nasties that
we can get in our beer from overcrushed malt.  What I took away from
this post (i.e. what I remember) is that overcrushing will increase
polyphenol (aka tannin) and silicate extraction and that the majority
of the polyphenols were *NOT* in the husks, but rather in another
layer of the grain (I want to say pericarp, but don't quote me).
Regardless of where the polyphenols come from, overcrushing leads to
elevated astringency and a higher potential for haze (both chill and
permanent).

I switched to oxygen because I tired of waiting for the foam to subside.
Two minutes with oxygen will give you plenty of dissolved oxygen.  Did
you pitch enough yeast?

Were both halves aerated equally, or did the plastic half get less
splashing? Which one got the first half of the wort?  My guess would be
the plastic.  The second half will get more trub that the first half
and trub-less fermentations have been shown to be slower than trub-full
ones.  There has been some speculation as to why this is... some say
that trub-less wort has fewer nucleation sites for CO2 and CO2 toxicity
is the cause for the sluggish ferment.  I've heard many reports from
brewers that confirm this assertion and none to refute it.  I'm not
convinced yet, but I'm leaning that way.  By the way, Malting and Brewing
Science notes this phenomenon (in a footnote, I believe) but doesn't
speculate on why it occurs (which we are free to do... WOO HOO!).

While later posts proved that it was roasted chickory, I'd like to note
that unrefined beet sugar has been reported to taste awful (in HBD... try
around 1991 or so).  *Refined* sucrose from any source will taste the

Calcium phosphate is all but insoluble, so that cans that idea.  Calcium
lactate is slightly more soluble (three times, if memory serves) but
is still not very soluble.  I again would like to argue against this
alleged "harsh bitterness" attributed to sulphate.  Also, now it seems
that somehow (probably not Jeff's fault) there is some association between
this harshness and noble hops.  The brewers of Munich, Koeln, Vienna
and Dortmund certainly use a lot of noble hops, yet their waters can have
sulphate levels of 80, 86, 125 and 280, respectively.

You do need to mash flaked maize and yes, you would have to do a partial
mash.  You could use rice syrup or rice syrup solids (a sort of DME made
from rice) to make a rice-based CAP, but I'm pretty sure whatever little
rice flavour there is would be gone by the time the syrup is made.  Sort
of like corn sugar made from corn... flavourless, right?


The bare minimum for partial mashing would be the "teabag" method in which
you use a grain bag to hold the goods and slosh them around in water.
I recommend against this because: 1) the pH is very likely to be wrong
with so much water (too high a water:grain ratio) and 2) there is no
actual laeutering (clarification... where the husks and insolubles and
lipids are held back and don't pass into the kettle).


In stead, I suggest you get yourself two 1-gallon containers that nest
(like plastic icecream containers or caramel corn containers or even
Tupperware).  Punch a hundred holes in the inner one and drill a hole
just a bit smaller than a siphon hose in the bottom edge of the outer
one.  Stuff 6" of a 36" length of siphon hose into the hole and put
a hose pinchclamp on the outside.  Now you have a mini holey-bucket
mashtun.  You can probably mash as much as 2.5 pounds of grains in this
as long as you don't go above 1.25 quarts of water per pound.
