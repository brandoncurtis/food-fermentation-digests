Subject: Re: Bitter Mimic


I received many thoughtful comments regarding my request for 
improving the body/flavour of my London-style bitter.  My thanks to 
everyone who wrote me.  The comments could be summarised as such:


o cut out the superlight; it may have rice or other undesirable extract
o cut down on/cut out the crystal
o use Goldings instead of/to compliment the Fuggles
o use Laaglander DME; it's thicker
o use M&F LME; it's thicker
o use flaked barley to improve body
o partial mash with brewing salts for London
o use Wyeast London yeasts (Fuller's, London, London III, British &c.)
o use chocolate/dark malt instead of dark LME
o no need for a 90-minute boil


With all this in mind, I think that my next recipe will be something 
along the lines of:


6 lbs. pale LME
4 oz. chocolate malt
8 oz. crystal malt
2 Tbsp. gypsum
Goldings & Fuggles to make 11-12 HBUs (boil)
1 oz. Goldings (flavour)
1 oz. Goldings (dry hop)


Mashing malts with gypsum, then adding LME and boiling hops, and 
proceeding as usual.  I think I may go with the longer boil anyway, 
to help darken the wort, but perhaps I'll forego that step.  We'll 
see how it comes out.  Prob. won't get to it 'til May, though.


Once again, let me thank all those who wrote me regarding this. 
This, IMHO, is what the HBD is for: brewers sharing their expertise. 
I remain

****************************************
regarding the diacetyl debate, and the overall notion that a particular
substance or flavor shouldn't be considered improper in *all* styles, i have
a question about oxidation.


for some strong beers (belgian and english), part of the maturation process
involves laying them down at cellar temps for months and months, if not
years.  surely this involves oxidation at some level, even if the beers are
sedimented with live yeast.  i recall in george fix's bt article that
temperature was a more important factor than the amount of headspace air
when it came to oxidation and the staling process.  are oxidation products
an expected part of the flavor profile of some strong aged beers?

Hey guys, I have been wrasslin' with this problem of me never having any
bottles to "pass around" -- if you want to try my beer, you gotta come
over here and get it off the tap.  My 3 best local brewing buds always have 
bottles to pass...  :(


I have decided that I might start keg conditioning.  I will brew a batch,
and then reserve a quart or two of wort -- can it in a hot water bath and
store it in the fridge.  Ferment as usual.  Put that quart or two of wort
into my keg, then rack from secondary into the keg, seal it and mix it up
good.  Fill a few bottles by pushing it right out of the keg with a little
CO2.  Let the keg sit, let the bottles sit, voila!  Naturally carbonated
beer, some in the keg, some in bottles!  My only concern is how much
reserved wort would be necessary to get sufficient carbonation levels in
the bottles.....  as for the keg, I can always "juice up" the carb level
with CO2, NP.


I've got a CP filler but it's a pain in the ass, IMO.

Subject: Re: Sulphate = Astringency


I have been under the belief that the reason I don't care for
Bass Ale is that it has a relatively high sulphate content, which
I perceive as "chalky"-tasting, like Milk of Magnesia.  To my
sense of taste, this chalkiness is very similar to astringency.
I know exactly the tannin/polyphenol taste of chewing grape
skins and, to me, it is similar.  Am I correct that what I perceive
as chalky is due to a high sulphate content?  If so, maybe
"chalky" would be a better description for the sulfate taste
than "astringent."

The problem here that ale in period was consumed very quickly, and usually
did not last long.  two weeks was about the longest you could keep it.  So
many of the recipes I am reproducing are only meant to be around for short
periods of time.  But I can only drink so much beer myself, so I want to
preserve it.


Also my research seems to point to the use of herbs (besides for medicinal
purposes) was to mask the off flavors of infected ale.  Hops was known very
early on (pre 1000) for its preservative properties.  The English were the
last to fall sway to the "demon weed" which was being brought in by the
Flemish.

I mean to say, that beer is what they called ale with hops... which was
primarily a product of the Flemish.  I am quick to type, and slow to think.
When you say Late addition, do you mean Late period meaning (to my sca
brain) 1500+?  There really is no distinction now-a-days..   I have vague
memories of Ale and beer coming into such usage around 1300?  (QDA)  Don't

Why then would you assume it was a 5-gallon batch.  I don't like my
brewing methods to be characterised as "behaviors."  Also, please check
the solubility of calcium sulphate before you start bashing my methods.

This is a good point and I will check my pH next time, but I'm pretty
sure that it was reasonable.

You keep reading your books (which I have read too, and
probably a few more) and I'll keep brewing beer and talking
to brewmasters.  Like the time I was in Burton-upon-Trent
and spoke with the brewmaster at the Burton Bridge Brewery,
where I was told that the municipal water is now 1/2 well
and 1/2 surface water so they add gypsum to get the sulphate
up to the traditional 600-700ppm range.


As for water treatment, I know of no brewery that removes
sulphate (how would you do that economically?  AJ?), but
there are many in Germany that remove bicarbonate by using
hydroxides (slaked lime, I believe).  However, modern water
treatment aside, traditionally, the beer that was brewed
in these famous brewing cities (Munich/Munchner Dunkel,
London/Porter, Burton-upon-Trent/Pale Ales...) was made
with untreated water.  Today, they can make Pils in Dublin,
but back then, they couldn't.

My guess would be it doesn't... but I didn't say that Brett is the *only*
way to get bubblegum aroma in your beer.  I typically get a banana aroma
from #1214, but then the esters and higher alcohols produced by the yeast
are influenced by the makeup of the wort (amino acids, for example).


Perhaps I was a little overly confident on my initial post... I had
convinced myself of this a long time ago and what used to be posted as
"I think that perhaps Brett is..." five years ago, now becomes "Brett is..."


Here's the whole story.  These are all the facts:


1. I isolated a yeast from a bottle of Orval around 1990 that makes beer
   which smells just like Orval (bubble gum).


2. It is an extremely slow-fermenting yeast (roughly 2 or 3 months until the
   airlock slows down and it never gets above about 6 bubbles per minute).


3. One of the yeasts that Orval pitches after the main fermentation is a
   Brettanomyces yeast.


4. Brettanomyces are typically very slow fermenters.


5. Both the yeast I isolated and a true Brettanomyces I purchased make
   *extremely* fruity beer (initially -- later you get the horseyness).


6. Both the yeast I isolated and a true Brettanomyces I purchased are
   acid producers -- in other words, they make "tart" beer.


I put these six facts together and deduced that it is quite likely that
the yeast I isolated from Orval was the Brettanomyces yeast and that
it is Brettanomyces that produces the bubblegum aroma in Orval.


So, while I didn't check my Orval isolate with cyclohexamide, I have
reason to believe that it is a Brett yeast.  Do you think my statement
merited a QDA?

the city water where I live is not chlorinated nor is it treated an any
way.  It's very high in bicarbonate and a 25ppm solution will discolor
within 5 minutes and on standing results in a rust colored precipitate! 
My explanation is that an iodine complex is formed/precipitates and
effectively removes the sanitation properties of aqueous iodine.  Of
course, the chlorine wouldn't have much effect on the idophor; however,
the lack of chlorine in the city water could introduce beer spoilage
organisms into the nutrient rich environment of my wort!  You might
agree that Star San is appropriate as a sanitizer for my situation.  I
must live with the foaming, the cloudy solutions, and check the ph
frequently.  OTOH,Star San solutions might have an indefinite storage
period and could be used over and over until the pH changes?


I would rather that G. Fix step into the ring and explain his tests and
findings or that interested home brewers read his book.  The following
is what I recall from reading G. Fix's chapter on sanitation.  Idophor
solutions at 25 ppm with a contact time of 5 minutes are effective. 
Interestingly, when the ppm idophor increases above 25, the
effectiveness of the sanitizing decreases.  More is not better!  When
the temperature increases from a nominal room temperature, the higher it
goes, the less effective the sanitizer is.  G.Fix explains the situation
in great detail and includes the calculations for determining the proper
contact time of the sanitizers. My practical experience with idophor
solutions involved adding idophor until I got the approximate correct
concentration - add more as it loses color.  Hmm, never did get around
to using the test strips.  The warmer the water, the better sanitizing
job I thought the idophor was doing.  Again, these are my
interpretations and not quotes of what is presented in G. Fix book.  


>From my own experiences and reading, a 70% isopropyl alcohol aqueous
solution is optimum for sanitizing (not sterilizing). Solutons above or
below this optimum concentration become ineffectual.  I suppose ethanol
behaves like wise.


Oh, I don't know what 10/60 means.  Could it be "Contact time of 10
minutes at 60 degrees"?

Fred Johnson wrote in his commentary in HBD #3010 that Mr. Joy failed to
identify "IMHO" and direct quotes from G. Fix.  Unfortunately, I'm in
California and all my brewing references are at my home in Virginia.
Iopologize to the consortium for my failure.
 
Ripley's "believe it or not" suggests that I am an analytical chemist
with specialization in laboratory quality control (microbiology,
chemistry, and pathology).  Though not trained in the sciences other
than chemistry, I learned a great deal about preventative sanitation in
laboratories and abattoirs.  I'm convinced that the findings and the
experiment presented by G. Fix are factual and that the conclusions are
appropriate for home brewer situations.  


I guess all that can be done after all the saying is finished is to take
a swab of the surface and have it tested for viable organisms. I read
the book and I believe!

A few days ago, there was a news story about a group of older guys
who ended up in the hospital... two (I beliveve) died.  The reporter
said that initial reports suggest that they died from drinking
homemade moonshine.  One relative said that it was common in that
Puerto Rican community for people to make moonshine from molasses,
white sugar and brown sugar.


Let us review the science once again... ethanol poisoning aside,
is moonshine any more likely to kill you than store-bought alcohol?
Also, methanol is impossible to make via fermentation of sugars, right?


Just checking my facts so I can blast the newspeople.

Why do you presume that the science is more important than the
beer for us who like the science?  I find both science and beer
fun.  I can go on for hours about chemical compositions and
reactions, but they are not more important than the beer to me.
If you think I'm passionate about the science, then you should

Now, since N2 is virtually insoluble in the beer, then the "dissolved

N2 can make it to the faucet until the keg is empty.

I want to install a beer tower.


The bar fridge has a nice stainless front and is
sitting close to the front of the closet.  There
is about 2' of open space behind it.  I intend to 
install a nice counter which will cover the fridge- 
the tower will be attached towards the back.  There
is room underneath for equipment.


I am in need of some guidance.  What you 
do not see, in the diagram, is that I intend to 
run the hoses from the tower through the floor, 
into the crawl space (5'11" but I can't call it a 
basement).  In the crawl space I will have a 
temp. controlled freezer, for kegging.


I have yet to purchase the tower or the kegging
system.  My lovely wife said that she would give
me her small freezer if I take her , and the kids
to Disneyland.  Sounds like a deal <G>. I know, I
know, bad economics - but, you gotta admire
her support!


The distance for the hoses will be about 8',
which is also the rise of the beer.  Is this 
a problem?  How about the regulator?  I think 
that this is something I will need to adjust, 
from time to time.  Should I be keeping the CO2 
tank and regulator in the bar?  Any thoughts?

Bearded Lithuanian lifts beer keg with his whiskers
April 16, 1999 
Web posted at: 6:48 AM EDT (1048 GMT) 




VILNIUS, Lithuania (Reuters) -- A Lithuanian brewer put his 32-cm long
(12.60 inches) beard to good use when he lifted a 41-kilogram (90.39 lb)
barrel of his own homemade beer, the daily Lietuvos Rytas reported on
Friday. 


Antanas Kontrimas, from the Western town of Telshiai, was already
well-known in the small Baltic state for having Lithuania's longest beard. 


The paper said that Kontrimas steeled himself for the challenge by downing
a pint of beer beforehand. He pulled off his feat in front of the cameras
of a morning television show.

Firstly, please refer back to my many posts in which I point out that
metabisulphite solution is not a sanitiser... bisulphite solutions
are only guaranteed to *inhibit* bacteria and yeast, not kill them.


Secondly, this goes against what the lead engineer of the original
oxygen-absorbing caps told me personally (on the phone).  He
recommended bleach solution at a rate of 200ppm free chlorine or
iodophor at a rate of 12.5 to 25 ppm titratable iodine.


In my opinion, technicians at companies that manufacture crown caps
are more likely to be experts in mechanical engineering than microbiology.

Since in this configuration the gas in tube runs to the bottom of the keg,
some bubbles might be forced up thru the beer out line also. Perhaps
Guinness uses a different combination of internal keg plumbing?

Is it OK to leave the keg out of the fridge for extended

This one is a real whopper, too!  It's easily full-strength -
a good 17% or so.  Man, does  it have a kick!  And it goes
down smooth as a whistle, nice and fruity and lots of
honey flavour left in it.  And it doesn't seem to hold
the carbonation for a long time, so you can pour a 4 oz
glass for sipping and when it's half gone, so is most
of the carbonation so there's just enough left to add
some balance to it.

Subject: Improved my siphoning...


Hi All:


I am always looking at ways to shorten my brew day (which is normally at
night).  I wanted to share, what I think might be an area of improvement. 
Siphoning from the boiler to the fermetor, this is one area (for me) that always
takes longer that is should (IMHO).  


In my system I have a 10 gal pot that is used as the boiler.  For siphoning, I
use a homemade goose-neck cane (made of 3/8" copper) with a braided-stainless
steel loop attached to the bottom with a Tee.  The braided hose works great at
filtering out the hops and break material but the flow rate always seems slower
that it should.


So on Wednesday night I tried an experiment.  I was doing a double batch (5 gals
each but different recipes) so I would have to siphon twice.  The first time I
did my normal procedure; whirlpool, let settle (10 min.) and siphon.  This
resulted in 41 min.  The second time, whirlpool and siphon (but continue to
whirlpool).  Time to complete was 14 min.  I immediate notice the flow rate
through the siphon was much greater than the previous batch (actually the
greatest that I have ever had).  There appears to be no visually noticable
degradation in the filtering of the wort.


Since the above experiment was done with different recipes, this is far from a
solid conclusion and warrants further (and more controlled) testing.


I just wanted to share my experience with the collective and hope that this
small  payment pays back what I have personally gained (from lurk mode) from
HBD.


Cheers,
Ed

The Irish stew recipe was very tasty.  Even my wife liked it, and she

add peas to it, only because I had them, and I didn't have many carrots. 
Oh yeah, I also used a crock pot instead of the oven.   I just finished
the last of it off for breakfast.   Keep the recipes coming.

Subject: Nitrogen dispense and draught dispense


Hello all!!


I would like to comment on the recent thread about nitrogen dispense. 
 I am going out on a limb and diputing Al K's post (I say out on a 
limb because I have a great deal of respect for his knowledge, having 
read many of his posts).  Even though the swan neck of a beer engine 
system quickly becomes immersed in the ale being dispensed, turbulence 
mixes in alot of air.  Because of the low amount of CO2 in the beer, 
most of the gas in the bubbles is air.  Since the gas in the bubbles 
is air, and the gas outside of the bubbles is air, very little 
diffusion occurs through the walls of the bubbles.  This does two 
things:  First, the smaller a bubble, the greater the surface tension 
of that bubble, so if a small bubble is next to a large one, the small 
one tends to diffuse into the larger and so on and so on.  Since 
nitrogen diffuses slower than CO2, this coalescence occurs more 
slowly.  Second, since their is very little concentration gradient 
between the gas in the bubbles and the atmosphere, the gas in the 
bubbles does not tend to diffuse out to the atomoshere  (this process 
is very rapid with CO2 which is less than .5% of the atomoshere but 
100% of the bubble gas in a conventionally carbonated beer).  The same 
principals apply to beers dispensed with nitrogen and CO2 mixtures, 
except that the nitrogen is dissolved in the beer and is knocked out 
of solution when it passes through the pinholes in the "guiness tap". 
 I hope that I have been clear, as I have tried to keep the length of 
this post down.  Happy dispensing!!

Big thanks to Jason Henning for posting pictures of the Mazer Cup judging on
his website - it was fun to see everything and everyone.


By the way, the judging sheets I received back were some of the finest (ie,
filled out, legible, worthwhile comments, etc.) I have ever received back.
Many thanks to the judges for doing a fine job (even though I didn't win!).

Subject: Re: Where is 'unitconv'?


Finally getting caught up with my HBD email!  Alan McKay asked the
whereabouts of something called 'unitconv' that converted "just about
everything under the sun."  He was referring to the software utility that I
wrote called Craft Brew Unit Converter, which has an executable named
unitconv.exe (for Win95+/NT).  It converts weight units, liquid volume
units, temperature, density etc.  I think it's the most complete utility of
it's kind, but I don't really know what's out there in the world that I
haven't seen.  Anyway, it's free.  It's available at
http://www.proaxis.com/~mutex.  Have fun!

Subject: Over Carbonation = Acid Beer


                        


HBD,


Im always learning something...  Recently the topic 
of over carbonating kegs leads to the beer taking on 
some additional acidity.  This appears to be in 
agreement with my experience.  However, I have 
blamed the over acidity on adding too much lactic 
to my sparge water or sparging too long.  I couldnt 
figure it out even though I was using pH papers and 
a hydrometer.
        Is it possible to fix the beer after becoming 
acidic from over carbonating it?  Fortunately, I 
dont have any acidic beer on tapit is all tasting 
great right now!!!    I am interested in this topic 
because I am not real good at getting the right 
carbonation levels for the style of beer.  This is 
because I crash cool the beer once it is in the keg 
and hit it with CO2
    The last batch I made was a 
    stout.  I put a pot of French Roast 
    coffee  in the primary which added a 
    very nice coffee note to the beer.  
    Light carbonation helps let the flavors 
    through too.
    
    Thanks for the info!

Subject: Pot caramelization?


Anyone experienced with pot caramelization?  I tried it for the first time
on a 90-Schilling Scotch Ale (from Noonan's book ... OG 1.076).  Holy butter
caramel, Batman!  I did like Noonan said: place boil pot on burner, start
sparging, turn burner on high, turn burner off when wort is deep enough to
be just boiling instead of caramelizing, then finish sparging.  Maybe Noonan
doesn't have a 160kBTU propane burner, but man did that hot pot BONG and
BANG while that wort went into it!  I sped up the sparge so it was hosing
out pretty fast and killed the propane when it got about 1 1/2" deep in the
pot, then slowed the sparge to normal rates and finished up.  My question
is: Has anyone else done this?  How did you do it and what were the results?
Mine is finishing up in the primary right now, so it'll be awhile before I
find out my results, but I was curious in the mean time....
