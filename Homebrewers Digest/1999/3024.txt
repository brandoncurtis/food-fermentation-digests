Hi all,


Fred Johnson writes:


" However, it is cloudy only for the first few weeks
after I bottle and gets progressively clearer during
storage (under my house at only several degrees below
outside temp) This beer eventually clears just like all
the other beers I've  brewed."


Back to me:


I have brewed many Weizens and have noticed the
same effect that Fred has; after about 6 weeks in the
bottle the beers become clear, sometimes also becoming
thinner and suffering from reduced head retention, too.


A bit more than a year ago Hubert Hangoffer and I
(and perhaps some others) had a discussion about
this very phenomenon.  According to a paper that
Hubert had (I think it was from the Feb. 1998
Weihenstephan technical lectures) yeast autolysis
is largely responsible for the degradation of protein
in unfiltered Weizen.


Although the flavors of autolysis may not be noticeable,
the more subtle effects will be:  the pH of the beer
goes up a few tenths and proteases released by the
yeast cells degrade proteins.  This produces clear
beer and can diminish the head and body, too.


It would appear that the major reason that some of
the larger breweries replace the primary Weizen
starin with a lager strain at bottling is to avoid this.
The Weizen strains are often not as hardy as
less exotic yeasts.


Of course, the simple fact that the yeast
settles over time also explains the overly clear
Weizen. In all likelyhood it is a combination of the two
events (and maybe some other stuff, too).
- -------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Santerre draws a cute ASCII picture of the
grain in his lauter tun moving away from the tun
wall, forming a sort of convex surface during the
sparge.  My homebrew lauter tun does this same thing.


This is not uncommon, but it can encourage channeling
down the tun walls and reduce efficiency.  Paul Smith,
a Siebel instructor with many years of experience with
Coors, stated that if your lauter tun tends to encourage
this sort of thing, you should push the grain up higher
against the walls at the start of the lauter.  You can fix it
during the lauter, too, if you care that much.


Have fun!

Since you included the little smiley face there in your post I'm assuming this
response is meant to be humorous, at least in part. I've certainly seen
more than enough acrimonious debate here over scientific minutiae on this
forum and hope this thread isn't headed in a similar direction ;)


Yes, I certainly did notice your reference to hydroxyapatite. However, I
think that most people reading your post would've come away with the
conclusion that to get calcium and phosphate to precipitate one would need to
get to an extremely high pH. You specifically made the point that in water
treatment quicklime is used to remove phosphate and that this causes the pH to
quickly rise, that the reaction is a pH-dept reaction and, in closing you said
that you seriously doubted that anyone would add enough calcium to get the pH
up above 11.0   I just thought that your post would leave the impression
(especially to non-chemists) that high pH is absolutely required for
ANY phosphate precipitation by calcium. 


As far as the form of phosphate in barley malt there are going to be many with
inorganic polyphosphate likely to be a major source but I'm just guessing
here...


You asked about the phosphate levels I cited from the MBAA book, this is from
a table on inorganic wort constituents and is indeed listed as PO4 (mg/l). 


Incidentaly, Here's an interesting quote from the chapter on wort production
by J. Dougherty:
____________________________________________________________________________
"...natural pH control in the mash takes place principally under the catalytic
influence of the enzymes phytase and the nucleases. These malt enzymes under
peptonizing conditions causes the release of phosphate ion from the organic
phosphates of the malt. The resulting mixture of phosphates is composed mainly
of the dibasic potassium phosphate, K2HPO4, which has a pH of 8.4 and
monobasic KH2PO4 which has a pH of 4.7. ... In the presence of adequate
calcium such as calcium sulfate in the brewing water a reaction takes place
between the calcium sulfate and the alkaline potassium phosphate: 


K2HPO4 + CaSO4 --> Ca3(PO4)2 ppt + KH2PO4 + K2SO4


This will be forced to the right and th4e alkaline K2HPO4 is very rapidly
brought into reaction and converted. The pH is thus naturally adjusted to the
optimum range."
__________________________________________________________________________
Although I do have anal-retentive problems with his talking about the "pH of
phosphates" instead of their pKa's and It seems likely that phosphatases 
in addition to  nucleases will be playing a role in liberation of inorganic
phosphate from organic sources,  this still provides an example of the
importance of a phosphate ppt reaction occuring at (relatively) low pH as
well as the obvious importance of calcium (apart from the stabilizing effect
calcium has on the barley amylases). 


In closing I must say that I  completely agree with your assertion that we are
unlikely to be precipitating out enough phosphate to negatively affect our
beer - the yeast certainly seem to have no problems growing and they have an
absolute requirement for bioavailable phosphate in the the wort!

Subject: bottlecaps....


>From my experiences on sanitizing caps or not....


If the box (huge amount of caps...many gross) is keep in a clean dry
environment, and is in a virgin state sanitizing is not done (most
micros).  Handling is one key item if the entire box is not used up in
one shot.  Bottling line operators should not directly touch them with
hands, the top of the capper bin should be covered. Some older
bottling line dont have a sanitary method for removing unused caps -
easily.  What we did on our manual line and seemed to work for us -
dump the caps in iodine - just to be safe.  We never used a full box
of caps in one bottling run.


How this relates to homebrewing - how does the store repackage the
caps?? Is the shop grinding grain right next to the open box of caps?
Are the repackers digging around with thier hands? If any of these
conditions are not met you could get contaminated caps.  You really
have no control unless you buy the full box. Sure most times you wont
have a problem - I'd go with the ounce of prevention tho....

Subject: Re: O2 Caps


Ah, yes... But you see, the majors have these large million dollar
machines called Pasteurizers.....


While working for a brewery in Germany (Kaiserdom
Privatbrauerei, Bamberg. No, they dont make Rauchbier),
I was witness to the same thing.
The bottling production went like this:


Bottles brought in on pallets, depalletized via machine, run
down a long moving band/line to a bottle washing machine
( the machine was about 100 feet long). This would wash
the bottles with "Saure" (acid, can't do the a with the umlaut
in ASCII) and then rinse them with filtered / sterile water. The
bottles were then snaked around via more moving band/line,
and ended up at the filler (50 or 75 head Krones I think). At
which point, after filling, they were capped (duh!). The caps
were taken from their plastic bag lined boxes and dumped
straight into the cap hopper. Not sterilized or sanitized (which
leads me to think they come pre sterilized? Gasp! Imagine
that!). However, they had a large pasteurizer that you loaded
a full pallet of full bottles into, waited a while and out came
pasteurized beer!!! WOW! However, they only pasteurized
bottled beers that were marked for export, not for local
distribution. Same thing with their sodas.


When I was still bottling my homebrew, I would sterilize the
caps in iodine, never had a problem. Although I have heard
that sterilizing the O2 caps with a water based solution isn't
good....


I think I have a solution:


Why not just move over to kegging, and have a few Growlers
on hand when you want to take beer to a friends house?


Prost!

Fellow HBDers,


I am going to do my first lager and was wondering about the starter. I have
heard that you want to ferment the starters at the same temp that the wort
will be fermented at. I have also heard that a lager takes a lot longer to
ferment than an ale.


Two questions:


1. Do you keep all of the steps of your starters at the same temp that you
will keep your primary?


2. Do lager starters take longer than ale starters. How much longer?


Thanks! Private emails are fine.

John Simonetta posts this about the need for cleaning.


"My homebrew shop sells them in small quantity, prepackaged bags.  I 
think from now on, no boiling, and handle the crown from the top.  Thanks, 
Rob, for cutting a step out of my process!"




Reality check!  How do you think the caps got in the prepackaged bags?  I
hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I've toured the warehouse of two big
brewing wholesalers  and they repackage  items like these themselves (just
like your homebrew shop probably does).  Both just have a corner  in the
warehouse with employees  moving malt, caps, chemicals, etc. from large bags
to small bags.  No clean rooms with hoods, though they do wear hairnets.


As for the multible posts about sanitizing bottles in the oven.  Why?  Seems
like it would take  a lot of time to load and unload, time to heat it up and
cool it down...  Have you ever tried a bottle tree with a rinser?  Quick and
easy, in the time you would use to load the oven you could have all your
bottles sanitized and ready for filling.  The tree is also a great way to
store 80 clean bottles waiting on the next bottling day.  I too said, "$35
for a piece of plastic?  I can make one myself and the dishwasher works
fine."  Having to bottle a batch at the shop one day without the dishwasher,
I broke one out of the box and am now converted.

Hi All,


Last weekend I brewed about 8.5 gallons of Imperial Stout (SG 1.090). 
Everything went well, pitched a gallon starter of White Labs Irish Ale
Yeast.  Within about 3 hours the fermentation started going fast ...
real fast!  Within 12 hours the top blew off the air lock.  I did
manage to keep the temperature under 78 degrees with location and a
water bath/wet towels.


I have read many references to the need for diacetyl rests for barley
wines and other strong beers but never for a stout ...


Do I need to do one with this Imperial Stout?  If so, how long?


Thanks for the advice!

Subject: Calcium Phosphate Precipitation


In HBD 3022 AJ bounces back with some compelling info which holds
true....to some degree....


>I can't agree wth Matt Brooks that hydroxyapatite does not precipitate
above pH 11. pH 11 is not a magic >number.


Your right it is not a magic number and again I said that hydroxyapatite
does not precipitate below pH 11.0 not above (probably a typo on your
part).  I retract this statement to a point, phosphate does not fully
precipitate out as Hydroxyapatite below pH 11.0.  If you are trying to
precipitate out significant concentrations of the PO4 in a water you had
better get the pH up above 9.0 to get any appreciable results, or better
yet, take the pH up to 11.0 (with CaOH2) where you will have all the OH
necessary to precipitate out all of the PO4.  Anything less then pH 9.0
will likely not do the trick, some will form but not much....more on
this later....


>The reaction is equivalent based as are all reactions - there just
aren't any that aren't.


True again, compounds form on an equivalent per equivalent basis but you
cannot excpect to add x number of moles of PO4 and X number of moles of
Ca and get an equal amount of hydroxyapatite formation, (hence it is not
a direct equivalent per equivalent reaction, as many others are) other
factors apply like the existance of hydroxyls to complete the compound.
If you added 10 meq (milliequivalents) of Ca and 10 meq of PO4 would you
get hydroxyapatite formation, perhaps, but only to the extent of how
many equivalents of OH were present (related to pH), so if you only had
say 2 meq of OH available in the solution (at typical water pHs there is
very little OH present to begin with) that will be the limiting factor
for hydroxapatite formation.  So say you added Ca in the form of CaOH2.
Well you say, look at all the OHs attached to this compound surely I
will get alot of hydroxyapatite....not really as the Ca you are adding
to the water will react with the "excess alkalinity" (remember this term
as it plays an important role also) to form calcium carbonate, so you
must add enough lime to account for the alkalinity plus the amount
required for the phosphate precipitation.  By now your system pH is
going to be quite high (>9.0) and you will have to do some sort of pH
adjustment to get things back to where you want them.


>the solution is super saturated with respect to hydroxyapatite and it
will precipitate if a seed crystal or
>other mechanism is present.


This may be more important than you think, especially when it comes to
hydroxyapatite formation, smaller particles are more soluble then larger
ones and it takes quite a bit of time to get hydroxyapatite to form to
begin with, this is known as an induction period.  This induction period
has been shown to be extremely long for hydroxyapatite formation
(several hours, according to Snoeyink and Jenkins, p.303  in "Water
Chemistry", Wiley Press, 1980.).  This induction period may be
significantly reduced by adding a "seed" to the water to provide
nucleation growth, however this seed will need to be in the form of
hydroxyapatite and hence does not seem likely that your typical
homebrewer will have some on hand, or will want to put it in his mash to
begin with.


> This is why the solubility of carbonates and phosphates decrease with
pH and why we can get them out >of solution by raising pH.


I thought we were discussing the topic of too low of a mash pH being a
problem.  If pH depression is the problem wouldn't this relate to
cabonates and phosphates wanting to go into solution instead of
precipitating out?




>but this is a little tricky, is use the solubility product of apatite

You use numerical techniques to solve for the pH which satifies both the
>solubility product limit and the charge neutrality criterion. It
becomes even trickier if you try to consider >the other forms of apatite
so that in practice it's not worth doing (for phosphate - do it all the
time for >carbonate).


Bingo...the optimum pH for hydroxyapatite precipitation is directly
related to the the point where the K(s) is the lowest.  This is
certainly the way to go, perhaps a pC-pH digram would also come in
handy!

There are other compounds that may form....see below....Correct me if I
am wrong here, but the water system on our planet is based on the
Cabonate buffering system not the Phosphate buffering system.  In light
of this, the fact remains that HPO4 is very much involved in determining
the total alkalinity of a mash, (drinking waters have very relatively
little phosphte present so it does not play a major role in alkalinity
determination there).  The fact that the pH rapidly drops in a water
after crushed grains are added may be due In Small Part to the binding
of PO4 as Ca3(PO4)2 or perhap some hydroxyapatite (but only to the
extent that it is given time to form....hours?) but isnt the bottom line
the availability of bicabonate or carbonate in the water to buffer
against such changes...... Lets look at a pC-pH diagram for the
carbonate buffering system, at pH =7.0 there is, as you may have
guessed, exactly 10(-7) Moles (uppercase on the -7) thats .0000001 Moles
of OH and .0000001 Moles of H present.  (If you are forming
hydroxyapatite you probably wont be forming much, unless you add some
OH).  This pC-pH diagram will also show the relative concentrations of
various species of carbonate (H2CO3, HCO3, and CO3) and how those
concentrations vary with pH.


As this topic has progressed the original posts seemed to have gotten
set aside as we have delved into the chemisrty behind it all,  I believe
it started with the infamous Al K, and Dave B.  talking about pH drop
resulting from hydroxyapatite formation, then someone posted about
concerns of not having enough PO4 for their yeast to grow.


As for the former, I believe you need to ask yourself if the water you
use to brew with has enough carbonate buffer capacity (i.e. alkalinity
in the form of bicarbonate (HCO3) or depending on your water pH
carbonate (CO3)  alkalinity) to resist the drop in pH you notice when
you mash in your grains?  How much alkalinity should I have you ask,
well it depends on the amount of "acid" (H+) you are generating when you
mash in.  Acid formation can be due in part from calcium phosphate
formation (because as you remove phosphates you liberate Hydrogens) but
I believe there are other factors at play here.  These factors may well
include Calcium hydrogen phosphate (CaHPO4) and Calcium dihydrogen
phosphate Ca(H2PO4)2 dissociation???? the pK(so) of these is very small
and I believe they are likely to play a significant role when there is
not enough OH (or time) available to promote hydroxyapatite formation.


As for the latter, I dont think a brewer could precipitate out a
significant amount of phosphate (unless he was trying to) that would
affect yeast growth, for the reasons discussed previously.


Bottom line....


Some tests need to be done and I will take it upon myself to do these
tests, using laboratory grade equipment and waters of differing chemical
composition.


Will post results in the near furure to those interested....?

sanitation is all that's needed, just rinse with potable water after a
rigorous cleaning.  Let the log numbers of the existing organisms control
the small number beer spoilage organisms.

as a final no rinse technique for bottles and caps.  At least there's
adequate scientific information to demonstrate that these sanitizers, when
used properly, reduce beer spoilage organisms to manageable levels.    I'll
continue to use my "wet heat" pressure cooker to sterilize yeast propagation

I returned to Virginia this weekend and opened the booy by George J. Fix and

on Sanitation, page 114.  I sure got it wrong.  The five minute contact time

minutes I guessed at!  While the 25 ppm solution required 9 minutes to
achieve the same sanitation level.


Again I apologize for presenting unsubstantiated opinion as fact to the

The mentioned reference text is a valuable resource and should be on the
list of "Must Read" for home brewers.  The simplist way to sift science from
opinion.  I'm somewhat surprised that I didn't receive a single reply that

Subject: Upside-down Converted keg, SHMS update 


Howdy. Has anyone done a keg conversion by cutting out the bottom of the
keg and used the existing top fitting as a drain? Seems I recall some
talk about doing that a while back in the HBD. I have three half barrels
I'm working on. The boil pot has gotten the standard treatment. The
other two; one for the HLT and the other for the Mash Tun, I'd like to
cut out the bottoms and use the standard big fitting for a flush
drain(flush as in high output of rinse water) so I can clean the barrels
in place. I'm thinking about getting a local machine shop to make a
couple of adapters that would insert into the opening and secure with
the standard o-ring and spring clip. The exiting end would have a large
pipe thread for attachment of a large drain pipe (~1 inch ID, maybe).
Anything commercially available that would work?


BTW, I've completed a Stamp based controller for the SHMS. Haven't done
a real mash yet but the test water mash went real well. I've now gotten
sidetracked into an electric heat conversion of my HLT so that my next
brew will be done in the basement, though the current weather here makes
for some kickass outdoor brewing. Oh well. I will be updating my website
soon with details of the controller and finally, maybe put something in
the pump house section.

Subject: malting 101?


Can someone point me at some info for malting on a very small scale?


I know the basics--get the barley moist enough to germinate, stir it around
and keep it from getting moldy, watch the sprouting, dry it and roast it.
So much for principles, but what I want to do is malt a small amount, in
the 2-digits-of-pounds range, using perhaps a bunch of shallow pans.  I'm
looking for things like germination time, drying temp, roasting temp, and
times...


Why?  Well, why not?  I asked a neighbor about brewing barley and he came
back with about 15 lb of seed barley, 2-row, from another neighbor who
sells to a local brewer (guess who:).  I planted a bunch for another part
of the experiment, but I've got enough left to try a first experiment at
malting.  The real "why?" is "because I need to keep learning as long as
I'm alive" and since this is an area in which I have no experience, it
would seem hard _not_ to learn something.


Email replies might be a good idea since this is off in the fringe, but
post if it makes sense.

Subject: IPA Recipe - Too much Hops ? 






Looking for a new recipe and am a borderline hophead.  Looking at several IPA
recipes, particularly "Sister Star of the Sun"....many awards....it has a heavy
hop schedule of 3 ozs Chinook for 60 mins, 2 ozs EKG for 15 mins, 2 ozs Fuggles
while chilling, then dry hop in the keg.  I've tried other recipes with lighter
hop schedule and they seem to come out very bitter and have a real bite.  By my
calculations this comes out to approx 55 HBU's, a big beer !  I'm wary of 3 ozs
for the bittering hop, but then it calls for 13 lbs of grains. (5 gal recipe)


Anyone have the same concern ?  How much hop flavor would be lost/added if some
hops were moved to a flavoring hop say for 30 mins in the boil ?  Anyone have
suggestions ?


If I could clone the Breckenridge IPA it would become the staple in my keg !!!
Can anyone help with a recipe ?

Don,
I generally brew outside, by myself, using a converted keg boiler and a

liftable increments.  My boiling kettle is on top of the propane burner,
which is on top of three cinder blocks.  My propane burner is the sort with
a ring for the base, so its very stable and the height allows me to open up
the ball valve and drain directly into my carboy after chilling (I use an
immersion chiller).  This sort of setup should still give you enough height
to use your counterflow chiller, but you will need to set it on some sort of
stand in front of the boiler.

Subject: Upgrading the Brewery, advice wanted


Howdy all,


I'm beginning to think about upgrading my brewing system for the fall
season, looking to eliminate two things that tick me off without fail:
bottling and siphoning.


I'm currently using a 5-gal. Gott to mash in a 5-gal. pot for boiling, and
a 5-gal. bucket for the HLT.  I've got a friend who's more than likely
going to give up brewing, so I'm going to inherit 2 more Gotts (1 10-gal.
and one 7-gal.).


Now, since I live in Chicago, and in a 3rd floor apartment, I've pretty
much decided that inside is where I will continue to brew.  However, if
anyone has advice on how to set up a pump to run hot water to various
places in Gott coolers, I'm more than willing to listen, or be directed to
clear WWW descriptions.  My main drawback is that I know squat about
electrical wiring, and only slightly more about plumbing.  Welding is
right out.


For the new kettle, I'm probably going for something in the 8-10 gallon
capacity, depending on the eventual cost of setting up other stuff.


I'm going to build a basic wooden stand for the HLT, since it currently
perches precariously on an empty cat litter bucket on top of the
refrigerator (which has a slant to the top).  Not the best situation.  A
cooler will be the HLT.


the mash tun will remain a cooler, although probably bigger one, and
including the now-classic "BB Snake" addition to the Phil's Phloating
setup.


Finally, I'm looking to spend no more than $250 upgrading, including the
cost of a pump. That's for the actual brewing system, not for stuff like
kegs, CO2 cylinders, etc.


So:


1) Is this reasonable?


2) What the heck kind of outlet to these pumps run off of?  Regular
outlets?  My apartment does have totally modern wiring, so that's a plus.
Lots and lots of outlets, too.


3) How well to Gott's receive drilling extra holes in them?  What do you
recommend for this type of thing?


4) If I wanted to HERMSify a series of coolers running off of one kettle,
would that be possible on the cheap?


Hopefully, this will make the whole process a lot easier, and more fun.
I'm also going to invest in one or two conicals (plastic variety) and a
fridge.


thanks!
