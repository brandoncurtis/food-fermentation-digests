Subject: Re: Lifting converted-keg kettles


Although I did so myself 2 weeks ago with my first all-grain batch in 
my new
converted keg, lifting the kettle is very dangerous - on many levels
(injured back, 3rd degree burns). Just dont do it. I solved my 
problem by
constructing a wooden stand out of 2x4s that was 36"Hx36"Wx24"D. 
This stand
is large enough that I can put my burner, kettle and propane tank on it 
and
have it three feet off the ground. I just use a small step ladder to 
climb
up next to it and stir, etc. This height gives me enough 
gravity/height to
just open the ballcock valve on the kettle to send it to a CF wort 
chiller
then into the primary.


Bottom line is that you need to brew higher, the stand just has to be
strong. Some folks are lucky enough to have an outdoor deck with 
some
height, but in my garage I had no other option but to build a 3 ft 
stand for
the setup.


Hope that helps.

Subject: cleaning grain-based charcoal from stainless


I'm naming products in this post, so please insert blanket disclaimer
here...


A few months back I had a brewing calamity.  I was mashing a 10 gallon batch
in my mash/lauter keg (fitted with an Easymasher) and started a temperature
rise.  I use direct fire because...well, because I like it.  Anyhoo, I got a
phone call during the "direct fire" portion of the day and forgot to turn
off the burner.  Sure enough, the grain at the bottom of the keg had
converted to its base elements (note sarcasm, not scientific statement) and
my mash had a smoky flavor that even a boiler room attendant would find
unpleasant.  I spent hours scrubbing, rinsing, treating, etc.  I used PBW,
3% hot caustic, soap and water, elbow grease, a copper scrubby, and finally
Brillo.  Eventually all traces of the black solids disappeared from the
bottom of the keg.  Topped it all off with a dilute phosphoric acid rinse to
passivate the surface.


I decided to buy a stainless mash screen to install in the bottom of the keg
to prevent this scorching again.  When I took the keg out of hiding two
weeks later to install the mash screen, I noticed that the bottom of the keg
(the area I'd been concentrating on) had been discolored.  It wasn't rust,
per se, but it wasn't the color of good stainless either.  Later on I read
that you should never use steel wool pads to clean stainless because bits of
steel can get embedded in the surface and rust.  (Why do these bits of
knowledge always come immediately AFTER you screw up??)  I don't know if
this is what happened, but I also don't know what chemical entity is
currently at the bottom of my keg either.


Does anyone have a theory?  Better yet, is there any way to treat the
surface and return it to near-pristine condition?  I can get the necessary
treatment chemicals, I just need to know what they are.

An excellent post recently by S. Alexander on enzyme kinetics and mash
thickness.....


A couple of questions though...

My understanding of the Michaelis-Menten (M-M) equation is that it
represents a continuum for defining enzyme catalyzed reactions.  If an
experiment was started with a large amount of substrate (i.e. starch),
with no new substrate added with time, the reaction would initially be a
zero-order, as there would be excess food and the reaction rate would be
limited by the amount and ability of the enzymes.  As food became used
up, the reaction would begin to become substrate-limited, and a
fractional-order reaction would emerge.  When the food level becomes
quite low, the rate of finding the substrate would become controlling
and first-order kinetics would result.


Could the kinetics of this enzyme-substrate complex be improved by the
addition of a mixer (or mash recirculation), as this would impart energy
to the system and provide a means for the enzymes and substrate to come
into contact more frequently (i.e. more collisions), especially as the
system proceeds toward the first-order kinetics (i.e. when the substrate
is severely depleted)?


Would the addition of a mixer (or recirculation) also aid in getting
water molecules in contact with the enzyme-substrate complex thus
allowing for unimpeded hydrolysis (assuming water was acting as a
limiting factor) of the starch complexes in thicker mashes?


It seems that in a static mash bed the reaction of the enzyme with the
substrate would not occur as quickly (efficiently?) as in a mixed or
recirculated mash?


Any thoughts on this?

Subject: Re: Flux Removal


Tim asks how to remove excess flux from his new RIMSystem.


Well, I assume you are using the paste type of flux. Removing that type is
indeed a pain. The liquid type rinses away easily. I would recommend using
an industrial solvent like acetone if you have it available, but since most
people don't, I think the next best thing is a hot solution of PBW (from
Five Star).  Hot caustic would be the knee-jerk solution to break up the
petroleum based paste, but hot caustic would be murder on your copper
tubing. Therefore, a hot solution of PBW should work to break up and
dissolve the excess flux without harming your copper. Probably should test
it on a spare piece first.
Good Luck,
John

Don Lake asked about lifting 11 gals of near boiling wort.  I tried this a 
few times with my brewing buddy, equipped with 2 pairs of oven mitts.  My 
advice: don't do it.  Oven mitts are good insulators, but they're not real 
grippy.  And the handles on an SS keg are pretty slippery to begin with.  I 
switched to an immersion chiller, chilled before lifting, and things have 
been a lot safer around the brewhouse.

Brewsters:


Jon Sandlin plans on using his boiler as a fermenter and asks for ideas 
on
how to seal the lid on and provide gas relief. He anticipates drilling 
two
holes.


Why not just cover the top with a plastic ( polyethylene not one with
plasticizers) sheet which is held down by daisy chained rubber bands.  
This
provides a good seal and the gas can leak out, even though the plastic is


puffed up. No holes required.  I have successfully used this method for
decades on a plastic 6+ gallon garbage can with no contamination. Cover 
the
beer with an opaque covering to prevent light from spoiling the beer.

Subject: centrifuging yeast starters


Does anyone out there have any experience in centrifuging your yeast
starters?  I would like to spin down the yeast and decant the spent wort.
I work in a lab and can use a clinical centrifuge or an ultracentrifuge
(both with "swinging-bucket type" rotors).  The rotors will hold six 50ml
polyethylene tubes.  So, it will take some time to spin down 2.5 liters
of starter (spin,decant,refill,repeat).


I wondered what speeds/times people had tried.  How did it affect your
finished beer?
  
I am doing this just to try something new.  It seems like a lot of effort
to do this for every batch but will be fun to try.


Thanks

Subject: Procedure Question


Yesterday I brewed for the first time a 10-gallon batch of English mild
ale.  Normally I do 5-gallon batches, but had two carboys available so I
decided I'd give it a try.  I pitched the yeast straight into the cooled
wort in the boiling pot before siphoning and then aerated well.  Then I
whirlpooled for about 6 minutes and let the wort stand for about an hour,
and siphoned into the two carboys.


Well, here's the strange thing.  The airlock on the carboy I filled second
was bubbling happily last night, but the second one still hadn't started by
this morning.  Does anyone have any ideas about why this might be?


Thanks!

Don asks about lifting 10 gallons of boiled wort.  I brew in the garage and
I use an eye screw in a rafter to attach a "winch" (it's one of those
ratchet / come-along / winch things) to.  One of those ratchet
winches....kind of like a block and tackle thing but a ratchet....I don't
remember what it's called, but I can show you exactly where they are at the
local home improvement mega store.  Anyhow, I mount the eye screw in a
rafter, attach the ratchet / winch thing to it and I used a gas pipe with
hooks to hook into the handles of the keg with an eye bolt in the middle of
the gas pipe to attach to the hook on the ratchet / winch cable.  Then,
when I'm done boiling, I can just ratchet that sucker into the air and run
through the CF chiller.  I hope this helps and somebody please tell me what
the name of that ratchet / winch / come-along thing is.

Subject: spud caca


Hello all,


In preparation for a Nut Brown I'm planning on brewing I decided to clean out 
my grain and hop supplies by brewing an experimentation beer, so that I 
wouldn't feel guilty ordering fresh ingredients for my Nut Brown.  I decided 
to brew a potato beer loosely following the guidelines in the potato beer 
article at www.brewery.org


I prepared the spuds by cleaning and slicing them fairly thin ( a few mm per 
slice.  Next, I brought my brew water to boil in the garage, about 30 min 
before it was ready I brought to boil about 8# spuds and 1# 2row inside on the 
kitchen stove.


When the boil water was ready outside I used it and the boiled spuds to dough 
in my grain to 155 def F.  I let the mash rest for 90 min and then raised temp 
for mashout and sparged for well over and hour.


After 1 week in the primary, 2 days in the secondary kegging and force 
carbonating the beer is ready.  It has quite a bit of starch haze that I'm 
hoping will clear with time.  The flavor is very nice.


I was wondering is this the same procedure you would use for rice or polenta?  
Also my spuds basically turned to mashed potatoes in the mash causing a very 
slow sparge.  Is this expected when brewing with adjucts like rice and corn or 
is this specific to using the spuds.


I'd advise everyone to try this brew.  The potato soup smell that this created 
during the mash was just heaven, and with a few friends to help I don't think 
the starch haze will pose any long term storage problems, It just won't be 
around that long.  :)


THX, Cory

Peter,


Not only is pouring the yeast into the glass from the bottle give it
a good taste, it also is considered obligatory in Bavaria (if you don't
your considered unknowledgable, at least with my Bavarian
friends). This is considered to be part of the whole "experience" of
drinking a weisse bier.


Usually the definition of a "Weizen" is the type of wheat beer that is
from around Berlin, it is filtered clear and heavily carbonated. Wiesse
Bier (helles und dunkles) is what you get in the south of Germany
(in and around Bavaria). Now, I know that this will cause a stir on
the HBD (and I will have 20 people tell me that I am wrong) but hey...
It's what I have seen in Germany while living there. (currently living in
France, land of not-a-decently-hopped-beer-in-sight, with the
possible exception of the Ninkasi Ale House in Lyon. Their
English Ale is nicely hopped when compared to Feldschlosschen,
but not when compared to the versions one gets in most US Brewpubs.
However, when one goes to England and tries anything remotely like a

How to safely lift 11 gallons of boiling water to transfer it from one

Sorry, I don't really think there is a safe way other than this.  Anything
else requires suspension from some type of chain or lifting mechanism and
eventually something will fail or someone will make a mistake.  Death by

Subject: No boil capping


Based on the concept that "it gotta be clean before it is sanitized", I
rinse the dust off my bottle caps in potable water and then put them in
160F water for a few minutes before removal, shaking off excess water
and capping. 


Boiling the caps is a no-no since the plastic capliners distorted and
caused me to toss a batch. 


It sounds like a variety of practices are practically acceptable, but it
is so simple to do, why not?






FWIW, my bottles are rinsed after use and drained and stored.  At
bottling, I start with a bleach water soak (gotta wet them in
something), push in a bottle brush and spin the bottle (just in case of
a neck ring), then jet spray rinse (I don't trust the dishwasher to
spray thru the neck to the height of the bottle) and put into the
dishwasher to drain and for a sanitizing cycle (no soap).


When stored in a dark, cool basement, my beers stay drinkable for a
couple of years (wheat beers excepted).  I like to brew a wide variety
of beer (30+ some beer styles plus meads and ciders to date) to always
have a bunch of choices.  Also, putting together an assorted 6 pak to
travel with is possible only with bottles.

"Sandlin, Jonathan Mark - BUS" <SANJM304`at`bus.orst.edu> of Corvallis, OR asks:


>I am curious about how commercial breweries clean their sanke kegs after
>use.  Is there a similar way that I can clean mine at home?  Obviously there
>is no way to "scrub" the insides.  Thank you for your help!


I've been kegging in Sankeys nearly 20 years.  You can scrub the insides
with a bent carboy brush, but I don't get that much gunk in mine except
when I ferment in them.  Commercial breweries clean with hot caustic right
through the valve with a fitting that is much the same as a tap.  I think
that someone sells a homebrewers version, but removing the valve is simple,
and it lets you see inside.


First, *release all pressure* by pressing down on the ball valve or you'll
get your teeth full of a heavy valve and draw tube assembly when you
release it.  Hold a rag over it or you will get a face full of stale beer.
Then, using a small screwdriver, pry out the flat retaining ring.  Next,
using the jaws of a pair of pliers as a tool, turn the valve to the left
maybe 30 degrees, and lift it out.  It takes less time to do it than to
describe it.  Soak the inside with bleach water for a few hours and boil
the valve/drawtube to sanitize it.  Rinse, fill with beer, reverse the
above steps,  The hard part is re-installing the flat retaining ring.  You
have to press down to compress th O-ring (which is under the valve).  To do
this, I put a plumbing part called a reducing coupler (I think 3/4" to
1/2")) on top of the valve, hook a board under the lip of the keg top,
across the coupler as a fulcrum, and sit on the other end.  Then I force
the ring into its slot by twisting a wide screwdriver blade in the gap
against the coupler until it's home.  It takes me about 30 seconds.  I keg
about half of my beers in these, the rest in 5 gallon Cornelius (soda)
canisters, which have the advantage of being easier to fill and seal, using
cheaper taps, and taking up less room in the fridge.  Of course, they hold
less.


Good luck.

From: "Paul  Smith" <smith`at`admin.uwex.edu>
Subject: Hello again, decoction results, lager steps and IBU's


Hi All - it's been some time.  I wanted to thank the many who 
graciously contributed their thoughts back on the "decoction" thread 
of this winter.   I wanted to report on the results of my 
experiments.


To recap:


I wanted to try two things:  (a) compare decoction v. single 
infusion v. use of high-melanoidin malts for achieving the
characteristic "German" maltiness, e.g., Ayinger and others, of 
dunkels and bocks.  Fix, Narziss and others didn't see too much of a 
benefit with decoction, while others are devoted to the method; (b) I 
wanted to try out the "twin saccharification" stop as described by 
Darryl Richman and others, where a stop in both the beta and alpha 
range are employed, utilizing decoction.


My mash schedule was as follows:


Mash in at 1.25 qt/lbs at 140; rest for 30;
decoct 1/3 to 158; rest for 20; bring to boil and boil for 30;
return to mash to bring mash to 158; rest to conversion (about 20);
decoct 1/3 runoff to boil, boil for 20 minutes; return to mash for 
mashout.
Mashout for 15.


My concern was that by the time I finished the initial decoct, the 
main mash would be sitting at 140 for well over an hour - leading to 
an insipid, overly attenuative beer.  This was the consensus of the 
opinion.


My results were:


OG: 14
FG: 4


The beer had a nice mouthfeel, and the flavor was reminiscent of the 
commercial examples , although not exactly where I want it yet.  My 
homespun theory tells me that one of two things is happening:  
beta-amylase begins chewing on "ends," but will eventually need 
alpha-amylase to liberate chains before it can continue to any 
appreciable extent.  Thus, with a 30 minute beta rest, some 
fermentability is achieved, and the balance of conversion is 
achieved with dextrin liberation.  


One flavor complaint:  With this particular dunkel, and with any beer 
I have made since then with a significant amount of munich (e.g, 
>30%), there is a bit of a "nut" bite that is not as smooth-malty as 
I would hope for.  Using a single infusion and a specialty malt 
(e.g., melanoidin or aromatic) to get some melanoidin in the mash 
seems to mitigate against the nuttiness whenever I have used a lot of 
munich.  Anyone else with this impression?  BTW, I use DWC for all 
pilsner, munich, and cara-malts.


*******


Troy wonders about lager starters.  I use the same method for all my 
(10) gallon batches:  1C-1QT-1G step, at room temp; allow the yeast 
to completely flocculate, rack off the (now, beer) then add 1 pint at 
the beginning of the brew day.  By pitching time, it is going nuts.  
Using this method has resulted in consistently satisfactory FG's.   
Previously, in my ignorance, I used to rack off the starter when the 
yeast was still at high-krausen, effectively tossing the best yeast 
and pitching on top of the wimpy critters.  My FG's were always 
pretty high - 4.5-5.  Thanks to George DePiro, somewhere in one of 
his contributions to BT.  


For lagers, if you pitch at room and maintain a fermentation 
temp immediately, this would result in cold shock.  I have chosen to 
pitch at room, and keep the lager reefer at 60 until the first signs 
of fermentation are underway; then I bring it down to 54 in one fell 
swoop.  This seems ok.  The heat of fermentation slows the rate 
of drop to a manageable level, I think, so fermentation proceeds 
normally;  I have not noticed any off-effects (unless this is 
what I am tasting when I say there is a bit of nuttiness, above).  I 
know many will say it is impossible to avoid ester production using 
this method, but it seems to work for me.


***************************




Finally, Jeff Woods wonders about "Sister Star of the Sun" IPA.  I 
can tell Jeff that I brewed this about a year ago, and it was 
absolutely tremendous.  My calculations showed the IBU's to be  
about 113!  But, in all fairness, this was my first all grain 
batch, and not knowing my system efficiency my OG exceeded the 
target (OG 18.5) by far.  My FG was also really high - 6 balling, so 
there was a great deal of  sweetness to balance the admittedly 
whopping IBU.  Try it and see!  One suggestion:  if my memory serves 
me correctly, the brewer called for a 90 minute boil.  Stick to that. 
 My experience with high alpha varieties with a strong ( or strong 
and unpleasant) nose is that a 90 minute boil completely vaporizes 
unpleasant effects.  Chinook and Nugget are two that have stood out 
as resinous, and in my view demand a long boil (Galena is my 
usual bittering of choice for all British and American 
styles).

Subject: Phosphate precipitation, beijo


Brewsters:


Why is anyone talking about hydroxyapatite?


Matt Brooks accuses me of discussing this.
I never mentioned the word.  It has little
relevance in brewing as far as I know.


The main reaction in brewing is due to the fact 


that calcium phosphate is incredibly insoluble.


Much more so than either calcium sulfate or
calcium carbonate. It is so insoluble at
brewing pHs that the calcium salts
added can be treated as an acid source due
to the release of protons from the partially
protonated phosphates when calcium phosphate 


precipitates.


The acid generated by this reaction is buffered
by the bicarbonate reaction which is many orders
of magnitude different from the solubility constant
of calcium phosphate. Calcium phosphate
precipitation is the dominant driving force in wort pH.
- ---------------------------------
Thanks for the information on the word for "beer" in 


Russian and Polish.  I love linguistic things.


In China ( where I've spent more time than in
Eastern Europe - where "bier" is well understood),
the word for beer is "beezho" in most of China I
visited and "beezhwer" in the Beijing area dialect.
Bayzhing is the new name for what used to be called
Peiping, and Peking, depending on the politically
correct linguistic era and who was in control
politically at the time. The northern Mandarin has a 


lot of ZH sounds in it and perhaps the rise of Chinese
domination in the north ( Mao and his gangs) versus
earlier British domination in the south ( where the
Chinese symbol for  Beijung would likely be
pronounced without the zh sound in the Shanghai
or Hong Kong dialects ) prompted this change in
the accepted pronunciation in Western translations.

Subject: Seed Barley and malting


Brewsters:


Dick Dunn is contemplating using seed barley for
his maltings.  Unless Dick can confirm that these
seeds have been untreated with fungicides and
the like I would not do it. Seed barley is most often
treated to prevent fungal destruciton of the newly
sprouted seedling ( damping off) and the like.


Better use feed grade for practice and to wait until
your barley is grown and harvested if you aren't sure.


Most home malting fails because


1) the seeds are drowned by soaking without
allowing a time to breathe, Give them an hour
break to get oxygenated when you change
the water every few (12) hours. Steep to a constant
weight ( see below).


2) the seedlings are not allowed to breathe oxygen and 


die of carbon dioxide poisoning. Turn the bed every
4 hours or so and keep it shallow ( 6 inches).


3) most of all, the malted grains are not dried properly
before they are kilned.  




So, advice is to stir the grain often, but gently, keep it
cool ( 50s) and oxygenated during the steeping
and germination  and dry it to a constant moisture
content for about 3 or more days at below 80F
before kilning to constant moisture at 120F or so.


A trick I use to evaluate moisture content
is to make a small bag of cheesecloth with some grain
in it.  Weighing this bag daily to constant weight will 


provide you an idea of when the malt is dry enough 


to kiln. You can also do this to check when moisture
uptake is constant during the steep.
I also use this same trick with hops.




Keep on Brewin'

Subject: Malting 101


Dick Dunn (rcd`at`raven.talisman.com)asks about home malting, a subject near


and dear to my heart.  I try to malt once a year, although I have yet to 
do
it this year, but there is still time.   




The seeds need to pass through a dormant peroid after harvest.  I would
wait at least six weeks.  Do a germination test to see if at least 95%
sprout.  Lay out 100 corns between paper towels and keep damp.  After 
four
or five days count the ones that did not sprout.


I malt about 25 lbs of seed per batch using a ten gallon Gott cooler, a
Phil's Phalse bottom, my shop's air compresser, a 2'x4' screen box and 
two
box fans.   First I clean the seed by rinsing with water.  Connect the
Phalse bottom in the cooler just like you would for mashing.  Pour the 
seed
in and attach the output of the bottom to a water faucet.  Let the water
percolate up through the seed and run over the top of the cooler  
stirring
occasionally until the water runs clear and the floating stuff is gone.  
I
drain it and connect the Phalse bottom to the shop air adjusted to a very


low flow and refill the cooler.  The seed seeps for two days.  I change 
the
water once.  




I am told that instead of using compressed air, you can just seep for 16
hours, drain and expose to air for 8 hours and repeat.


After seeping I pour the seed onto the screen box in a pile and insert a
thermometer into it.  In 24 to 48 hours the thermometer will start to 
rise.
 Then spread the pile to about 3" deep. You don't want the temperature of


the seeds to be much higher ( say 5 degrees) than the room temperature.  
If
it gets too high, thin the pile.   The seeds will "chit," that is start 
to
sprout rootlets.  They will need to be turned at least once a day or the
rootlets will entangle and you will have to deal with a brick of malt. 


After 4 or 5 days the acrospire ( shoot) will be about 3/4 along the 
length
of the corn and the rootlets will be about 1.5'" long.  ( use a razor to
slit the corn to check the acrospire) 




I haven't worked out a proper kilning method yet so I make "wind malt,"
that is air dried malt.  I put the screen box on two box fans and block 
in
the sides with cardboard.  The fans are set to draw air down through the
grain.  After three or four days the corns dry so that they are crisp to
chew on.  I have also experimented with placing a milkhouse heater under
the screen box and partially inclosing the top of the box.  I could get 
130
F that way.


I remove the rootlets, called clums, by tumbling in a clothes dryer.  I 
use
a leg from a pair of jeans as a bag to hold about ten pounds at a time. 
Tie
it shut more than once. After 45 minutes the rootlets will seperate with
the screen box.  A bit of advice.  Wait until "She Who Must be Obeyed" is


absent to perform this operation.


I have made crystal malt using a microwave oven.  Put the undried ( green


malt ) in a mason jar with a saucer on top and microwave for 30 minutes 
at
the lowest setting.  It makes really cool huge crystals!


The last batch yielded 27 points per pound per gallon.  Not bad for
heimgemacht!

winners that they be allowed to choose from varieties of yeast in 5gm
sachets, further that they be allowed to receive 4 varieties, 25 sachets
each, for a total of 100 sachets.
        This presented a slight dilemna for the shipping department `at` Lallemand,
for not all the winners wanted a selction.....indeed the winners requsts
varied from 500 gm bricks to a 50/50 blend of 2, to a 33/33/33 blend of 3,
and on...........and further compounding this was the fact that not all the
winners had yet to state their preferences, nor their shipping addresses.
        This was attempted to be handled in a bulk post sent by Louis Bonham to all
the winners, stating that we `at` Lallemand hoped that the winners would
respond with the relevant info by April 15th, so that a conclusion could be
achieved.
        Yet as late as the 26th of April, a request was received, this apparently
due to the fact that the winner is using an e-mail address `at` a former
room-mates address.
        So, please be patient, I am sure that if you have made your desires known
by now, you will be soon receiving your Lallemand prize. If you have any
further questions, please contact me directly, and I will handle your needs
in the most efficient and expeditious manner that I can.
        Lallemand is proud of it's association with the MCAB in it's inaugural
year, and we look forward to many years of continuing this relationship. I
know that the organizers learned many lessons from this first effort that
will aid them in future competitions, and I can assure you that we `at`
Lallemand have too.  The delivery of prizes is one such lesson.


Cheers!
