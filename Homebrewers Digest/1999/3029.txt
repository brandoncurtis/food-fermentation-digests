A micro that I talked to about this years ago also did not sanitise their
caps.  They have since gone out of business (Chicago Brewing Company) or,
more accurately, their recipes and beer names and equipment were bought
up by various other breweries, but their beer suffered from oxidation
rather than sanitation problems.


Nonetheless, there is a distinct difference between the caps we get and
the caps micros get: ours are repackaged.  Someone has to scoop out and
count or weigh the caps and repackage them.  Is that the same scoop they
use for malt?  Any grain dust fall into the open box of caps?  Any
thumbprints on the cap liners?


Can you make sterile beer in the kitchen/basement/backyard?  Almost
impossible.


Can you make beer that is only slightly infected (as we all do) but not
so much as to cause off flavours/aromas and bottle it with unsanitised
caps?  Absolutely.


Are you *more* likely to keep your infections below taste/smell threshold
if you sanitise your caps?  Probably.


Sanitation, fresh ingredients and minimising oxygen pickup (except for
in cooled wort at pitching time) are the most important factors in
making great beer.  You can skimp in any of these three areas and still
make world-class beer.  Then again, the less you skimp, the more
*likely* you are to make world-class beer.


That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

Subject: Ca phosphate (or whatever)


Ok, so now we have lots of blathering about why Calcium can't possibly
be combining with Phosphate and precipitating in a mash.


I'd like the skeptics to then explain what *IS* happening.  Why does
adding a calcium salt (carbonate or chloride) to the mash drop the pH?
Why do all the brewing texts that I've ever seen claim that calcium
phosphate precipitation is the mechanism?  Are they all wrong?


I don't really care what the pK is, and at what pH hydroxyapatites
form.  I care what is happening in my mash.  And it is clear to me
that adding gypsum or calcium cloride *drops* the pH of the mash.  So
don't tell me why it can't happen.


Reminds me of the old "bumblebees can't fly" legend.

 Sorry, what I meant was, couldn't you add the honey after fermantion and 
pasteurize the whole thing, so the honey doesn't ferment, and then force 
carbonate.

I have a similar setup and I've been pretty baffled by this kind of
behaviour also.  I've got photos of my setup on my website.  I brewed
at least two dozen batches on this system with absolutely no problems.
Suddenly, on the last two batches I've gotten serious cloggage when
running the wort out of the kettle.  Temporarily, I fixed the problem
by getting a long (30-inch?) stainless steel spoon and scraping the
screens.  An hour later, I had gotten 95% of the wort out, pitched
and went to bed.


Note that I've never, ever had any slow runoff problems from the mash
tun, which also has three similar screens.  Even on these batches with
clogged kettle screens, I had crystal-clear, smooth runoff from the
mash tun.


After the first time I had this problem, I suspected protein buildup on
the screens (since I had at least two dozen batches with no problems)
so I soaked the screens in hot PBW overnight.  The next batch had the
same problem.


Another reason I think it's not buildup on the screens because I used
both the mashtun and kettle as both mashtun and kettle on the last
batch (i.e. both were used as mashtuns and then both were used as
kettles)... the runnings from the "mashtuns" were smooth as silk,
whereas both "kettles" had cloggage.  My real mashtun has only been
used as a kettle once or twice before, hence, I don't think it's
buildup.


I have not had the time to brew again since then, so I could not test
my latest theory: brittle whole hops.


You see, when I was about to sell my HB supply store, I bought a lot
of extra hops and malt.  I stored the malt in HDPE gasketted buckets
and the hops in CO2-purged, 1-gallon, oxygen-barrier, heat-sealed
bags.  The hops have, however, been getting dryer and more brittle
as they age (oxygen, but not mosture-barrier?).  This is the only
difference between two batches that were essentially the same
(except for the clogging and the age of the hops (and malt, I guess)).


Were the hops you used rather brittle, or were they very soft and
springy?  I really would like to figure out what is at the root of
this problem not only for my own and Jeff's sake, but also for other
users of screens like this in their kettles.

Subject: TA titration


I have read somewhere, possibly here, the pH number at which the tell tale color
change takes place when titrating to find total acidity but can't find that
number now.


Does anyone know the number?  It seems it would be easier when testing dark
musts (like red wine) and possibly more accurate even for lighter musts like
traditional mead or cider.


Am I hopelessly confused or would it be a good idea, assuming I have a pH meter,
which I do, to determine the balance point in a TA titration using the pH meter
rather than depending on the color change?

Subject: Re: fwh formula?


From: jim williams <jim&amy`at`macol.net> asks


>does a formula exist that figures ibu of first wort hopping technique?


Strictly speaking, fw hops are boiled the full boil, and contribute as
many IBU as they would if they were added at the beginning of the boil.
However, the bitterness is of a different nature and according to the
original articles quoted by George Fix in his first report to HBD, the
German taste panels overwhelmingly preferred the FWH beers.  Even though
the FWH beers had a higher IBU than the standard beers, they were not
perceived as such.  See Dave Draper's FWH summary at
http://hbd.org/ddraper/beer/1stwort.html.  Here is a quote from it:


"6. Final comments: each brewery needs to experiment with its own setup for
determining what sort of first-wort hopping is best for it. But the
alpha-acid quantity should *not* be reduced, even if one gets more
bitterness than one would get in the usual way. The tasting panel results
seem to indicate that the bitterness in the FWH beers was fine, and
mild--i.e. there is little harshness that can appear in a highly bittered
beer. If the hops are reduced to compensate for the extra IBUs one gets
from the first-wort hops, then the whole benefit of doing it might be lost.
The recommendation is to use at least 30% of the total hops as first- wort
hops--basically, this means adding the aroma hops as first-wort hops rather
than late kettle additions."


I love FWH for my CAP and other pale lagers, and have used it in some pale
ales as well.  In one case I used 100% of the hops (Columbus) as FWH in an
APA and loved it.  I also recently tasted a Helles-type lager (brewed by a
frequent HBD poster) that was 100% FWH.  It didn't stand out as peculiar,
just very nice.

Subject: Dave Humes Assumes


     This is a rather difficult post as I am responding to someone who
despite my invitation to do so refuses to let anyone else in the HBD see
what he likes to write! His preference is to send very nasty private emails.
The source of Dave's bitterness was my Cat Swinging post.
      Now Dave, why don't you take the opportunity to hop up here on the
dais and have your two bobs worth. Everyone else does! Let me get you
started. Bring along that piece of paper you're holding with your comments
on it.
   "The very thought that you would
remove a cat's tail for something as insignificant as your beer is
unthinkable"
   "The fact that you decided to advertise your stupidity
and inhumane treatment of an innocent animal in this forum goes only
to show that you are nothing more than a heartless moron."
   "Lets think, if a
cat could get in your brewery, then maybe also mice, rats,
cockroaches, snakes, and who knows what else could get in also.  For
crying out loud, are you open fermenting in the carport?"
       Now Dave, really, sit down and loosen that tie! You are surely not
going to tell me you really believed the whole thing happened? Am I that
convincing? Dave it was something that came to me as an aside whilst
responding to the uric acid matter. The cat in question, i.e. the
neighbour's cat is at this moment curled up on my lap. Doesn't look like
he's ever had a swing in his life!
       I'll skip the lecture you gave me on how to look after domestic
animals. What other kind thoughts did you offer?
     " The animal was simply performing a
natural function undeserving of your inhumane treatment.  Some people
like cats and others don't.  That's OK.  Just keep it to yourself.
What you wrote to the HBD is not funny and this kind of talk only
encourages others with similarly underdeveloped value systems to do
more of the same".
     "The purpose of the HBD is not to serve as
a forum for personal diatribes having nothing to do with making beer"
      Well Dave, that's fair enough comment I guess. But since when did you
become the self appointed Chairman of the HBD, did I miss something
somewhere? I have criticised postings myself but I did it in this forum
where others could see what I had to say, and criticise if they felt it
necessary, and they did!
     My idea was to add something a little light, sort of a coffee break
between the long chains of chemical compounds that sometimes run on and on
and on!
     If you don't like what I write that's fine. But criticise me here in
front of everyone! That way if someone doesn't agree with you they might
like to tell you so.
     Then you might have something else to think about. Now wouldn't that be
a little fairer?

What I've found is that American "methode champenoise" style wines (where
they do a secondary fermentation in the bottle which is capped, before
uncapping and disgorging the yeast, then corking/wiring) will take a
standard beer bottle cap.  Wines that are not fermented in the bottle, but
in tanks before bottling, sometimes/usually don't have cap-able tops.

Subject: epsom salts for hop plants?


Paul Shick asked about using epsom salts to cure a magnesium deficiency that
was causing hop leaves to yellow.


I would recommend that you go to the hardware store and get a good soil test
kit.  I had the same problem with my Mt. Hood hops last year (interestingly
none of the other 9 varieties in the same plot of ground had the problem).
I don't recall the name brand of the test kit, but it had 4 test containers
and different chemicals in capsule form so it is all premeasured for you.
What I found was a potash deficiency and I applied a pound of it in 3
seperate instances over the growing season, between all 10 of my plants.  No
more yellow leaves.  (BTW the Mt. Hood has been the fastest growing plant
this year, it reached over 8 feet as of yesterday, Tettnangers are only a
few inches behind.)

Brett asks about a good adhesive for his bottle labels.


I'm sure this will receive a mixed reaction, I use milk.  Yep, 
good 'ol 2%.  


I have a sponge for just this purpose, so I set it in a shallow
bowl and pour a half cup of milk in.  Then I take a label and
set it on the sponge face up, tap it down so the back is well 
dunked and apply it to the beer bottle.  Sometimes you 
have to 'encourage' the corners to lay flat, but that's it.


To remove, soak the bottle for about 30 seconds and the
label lifts off.  I do lose about 2 labels per case because it's
not a perfect adhesive, but it's no biggie for me.  They 
usually fall off as the milk dries or they're on for good.


I've done this with labels printed on a color laser and an

Subject: Hop Bags - What's to Lose ?






Is there any thoughts on using hop bags in the boil ?  I find straining
from the kettle a real PITA.  Last few brew I used hop bags and made
it much easier.  Is there any evidence that using hop bags loses a lot
of the hop utilization ?  I understand there is less hop contact with the
boiling wort, but is it significant ?  Should you compensate and add a
little hops and continue with the bags ?  I usually use hop pellets but
can use either type if it makes a difference.


Please, no complex intellectual university-type formulas.  Just some real
practical advice.  Thanks in advance.

Milk.  Comes off easily (a fault if you're putting your bottles in an ice
bucket to chill, but that makes beers too cold anyway).  Cheap, always
available.  I put a bit on the counter and smear the back of the label
across the milk, then apply it and smooth it with a damp sponge.  Looks
very professional.

Lee,


>A decoction is beneficial in a wheat beer by breaking down proteins and
gums

It also adds a "decocted" grain flavour to the beer. Something that I
have never
experienced with an infusion mash.


>Why do you take 10 minutes  to add the decotion.  Dump about 2/3 of it
in

>temp.   No need to wait 10 minutes.


I have a brewhouse report from the Stroh's brewery in Winston-Salem, NC.
They
take 10 minutes in the transfer so as not to destroy any enzymes by
dumping a lot
of hot, boiling mash in all at one time. I have also read in Kunze that
the addition of
the decocted mash should be done slowly to avoid damaging the enzymes.
So I
figure between 5 and 10 minutes. This is what I have read in Kunze and
Noonan.


(Kunze International Edition "Technology Brewing and Malting". Page 217)


>Also as soon as the main mash temp has stabilized I pull the 2nd
decoction.
>Save some time any starch will convert during the gentle heating.


The decoction profiles that I have studied have said that you should let
the mash sit
for a while after adding the first decoction. Here is how Kunze
describes an
"abridged two mash process":


"The mashing-in temperature is 62 C (143 F) and the process lasts only
two hours -
which gives rise to the name of the process, which can also be performed
as a single
mash process. The process requires well and uniformly modified malt.


The mashing in-temperature of 62 C (143 F) is above the optimum
temperature for
protein breakdown although a good foam can be obtained. However, there
is no
B-glucan breakdown at all and so very well modified malt is essential
for this
method"
(Kunze International Edition "Technology Brewing and Malting". Pages
217, 218)


They don't describe it in the text, but the illustration shows:


     Mash in at 62 C (143 F), let rest for 30 minutes.


     Pull 1st decoction, raise to 71 C in 5  minutes, let decoction rest
for 15 minutes.
     Then raise decoction in 10 minutes to boiling, let boil for 5
minutes.


     Add 1st decoction to mash over 5 minutes, raising mash-tun temp to
72 C,
     let rest for 30 minutes `at` 72 C.


     2nd decoction: Pull mash, raise to boiling in 5 minutes, let boil 5
minutes.


     Return decocted grains to main mash over 5 minutes.


     This raises mash to around 77 C to 78 C (mash out temp)"




Kunze calls for a 30 minute rest after adding the 1st decoction. So, we
have
different styles of decocting. But both work. You will please pardon me,
but
I am more of a "traditional brewer", meaning that when I brew a beer, I
try
and get the ingredients and the process that come from the beer's
country
of origin (Munich malt from Germany etc etc). I think it gives a more
authentic
beer, not just that I can say that it was brewed with German malt or "in
the
German Way", I think that in the end, the origin of the malt and the
process of
brewing has a lot to do with the authenticity of the flavour. But that's
just my
opinion.


I will try your method of decocting once my brewing system arrives here
in France.
If it works for me I'll use it on my Lagers. Would you please send me
your
decoction profile?


>DWC is a Belgian Malt from DeWolfe & Coysns (spelling may be incorrect)


I've heard good and not so good stuff about DeWolf. That is not to say
that
they do not make excellent malt (I like / use there Pilsner Malt,
great grain flavour!)


Thanks, (and thanks in advance for the decoction profile)

Subject: Keggerator; was beer tower


About 2 weeks ago I had posted a 'cheesy' ASCII
diagram of my bar, and a request information
regarding the installation of a beer tower (tap).
The feed lines for the tap were to run 8', from the 
[ok, let's call it a ... ] basement, through the
floor, to the bar.


I would like to thank the members of the HBD for 
taking the time to respond to my questions.  For 
those that are interested, I have included some 
of the comments at the end of this note.


Based on these responses, and some net surfing I
have done, I am rethinking my original plan.


Would those of you who have built a keggerator be 
so kind as to provide some guidance?  If you know
of some 'web handles' which would help just 
include them, instead of repeating things here.
Some points that come to mind are...


o What brand of towers?  
o Where purchased?
o Design and method.

At the risk of boring the beejeebees out of all
of you I will paraphrase some of the responses.


Several people were kind enough to offer some 
suggestions - Al Korzonas of Lockport, IL began by 
saying that the 8' rise should not pose a problem
and that I can easily compensate for excessive
foam [on my pours] by varying the diameter of the 
supply hose.  Al went on to say that I may want
to consider running the supply hose through a cooling
jacket, to keep the beer in the line cool.  In 
closing, Al warned that keeping the tap clean may
be a challenge.


John Wilkinson of Grapevine, Texas suggested that 
the amount of beer in the line was negligible 
(~ 3 oz.) and cooling should not be a problem.


In response to Al's warning concerning mold 
growth on the tap, Curt Abert, of Champaign, IL, 
suggested that keeping the tap at ambient room 
temperature all but eliminated his mold problem.

Subject: RIMS sparge recirc, magnesium hops , Dr. Peevo, outatown


Brewsters:


Sandy asks about using the RIMS sparge water
kettle as a recepticle for the sparged solution and
recirculating this until sparging is finished.


An important part of this "on the fly" sparging is the
idea of plug flow.  Fresh water at the top of the
column pushes out the wort, leaving a much
lower concentration of sugar in the following water.
This is the most efficient method of extraction in
which wort in the grains flows into essentially
pure water  Otherwise, you would be losing
valuable sugar contained in the grains ( think
of them like tiny sponges) at the same
concentration or higher than the recirculated
wort at the end of your recirculation sparge.
- ------------------------------------
Paul Schick asks about using magnesium
because he saw some yellowing on his hop
bines at summer's end.  Several things can
cause this.  If it was at the bottom, likely your
bines needed some nitrogen, since hops borrow
nitrogen from the bottom and carry it to new
growth. Use slow acting nitrogen, however, as
you may get bine growth ( vegetative) instead
of cones. If it was all over, but more devastating
at the bottom  it may have been a verticillium wilt
or fusarium wilt -  just like your tomato plants.


I suggest you get a soil sample and tell the
county extension specialist what you want to
grow.  Both magnesium and boron should be
checked. Boron may need replacing year to year.

collective homebrew conscience_


anybody have experience krausening and kegging bavarian weissbier?  i''m
doing a weizen this weekend and i plan on krausening it.  it's a good
experiment to compare with past non-krausened batches.  my intent in
krausening is simply to try it and see what the flavor impact is.


first question:  does it matter what yeast i use for the krausening?  i will
have an opportunity to use a freshly-fermenting munich helles as the gyle.
i wonder if this lager yeast would dry the beer out more than if i used a
weizen yeast for the gyle.  should i mash a couple degrees hotter to account
for this possibility, relative to my standard recipe, or is the attenuative
difference probably in the noise?  also, to keep the wheat/barley malt ratio
the same, i guess i should increase the wheat malt % slightly.


i can krausen in the secondary and let it ferment out for a few days before
kegging, or i can rack into the keg and krausen it there.  obviously i would
have to continue releasing pressure as the ferment continued.  what are the
advantages/disadvantages of each?


if i do use the munich helles as the gyle, should i krausen the batch and
then immediately start to ramp the temps down to start a lagering process?
is diacetyl (sorry, doc - different style here) production a problem when
krausening with a lager gyle at ale fermentation temps (~68 f)?  am i
correct in believing that the diacetyl production of the gyle depends more
on the helles batches' initial fermentation temp, and by the time i pitch
the gyle into the weizen, it's not going to be a major diacetyl producer,
but rather a diacetyl reducer?  i don't anticipate that there will be
significant diacetyl in the weizen batch at the time of krausening.


on this topic, i assume i pitch the gyle when it is in full-blown high
krausen. (?)


basically, i'm looking for advice based on experience and any pitfalls i
should avoid.


i'm considering writing an article for bt or zymurgy.  potential topic:
_the massive flavor impact of hydroxyapatite in beijing breweries_.

Subject: Potassium Sorbate in beers???


Hi all,


I have used Potassium Sorbate in my mead making to prevent further fermentation
before. But I have never used it in brewing. I have 2 kegs of (10 gal) of Am.
Wheat for a party next weekend. I would like to split them into 3'rds and make a
honey wheat, a raspberry wheat and leave one alone just in case... I would also
like to bottle some of these up for competitions especially the raspberry wheat.


Any suggestions?


Anyone have proceedures for pasturizing a corny keg in a 1/2 bbl keg of boiling
(or near boiling) water??
