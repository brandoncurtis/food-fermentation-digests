Flare fittings, copper tubing.  Compression fittings are NOT for gasses.


Use a t-fittings to branch off the main line to each burner.  You should
need one less t-fitting than burners.  If you are using high pressure
burners, you may have a problem with the pressure if you have all the
burners going at once.  The burner should have a valve on it so you

Scott Murman says..." Just how much
O2 diffusion occurs when stirring?  My intuition tells me it's
negligible compared with forcing O2 into solution.  Stirring rouses
the yeast and forces excess CO2 out of solution, both of which cause
foaming, but I think you still need to perform oxygenation with some
other means."


I'll address the three assumptions in order:
 A)enough
 B)Mis-intuition, see A,
 C)yes, yes, and no


The major points of a stirplate:
 A)It doesn't need refilled or certified periodicly.
 B)If you leave it running for 48 hours the room
   won't ignite the next time you turn on a light.
 C)No chance of over oxygenation and killing the yeast.
 D)The _constant_ stirring keeps exposing the entire solution
   to atmosphere allowing maximum absorbtion of O2.
   If you aerated to 8 ppm with an injection system the O2 levels
   begin immediately to fall, lost to metabolism and outgassing
   by CO2; it is not long before it is nil. The stirrer maintains
   the O2 levels_continuously_though at a lower level, but the yeast
   just need to have some available, not the 8 ppm needed in a "one-shot"


   aeration system.

Subject: all grain brewing


I believe the general rule of thumb is approx. 1 quart of 172 degree 
water
per pound of grain, all totaled, will bring the mash down to 152 
degrees or
so. Its not much different than the stovetop method. In general we 
are
looking to hold the mash between 148-152 degrees for about an hour or 
until
starch conversion is complete (as indicated by iodine test or,as I used 
to
do it, never check but feel confident - if its been held at 152 for an 
hour
it was always converted, so I quit checking).


For an excellent article on getting started in all grain see an article 
by
Dan Listermann called "Wanna Mash" at http://listermann.com/mash.html.
<http://listermann.com/mash.html> 
What makes this article nice for a beginner is its emphasis on 
simplicity
that in turn eliminates the intimidation factor. I am/was the type 
to keep
brewing as simple as possible and the "chemistry of it all" bores me 
(sorry
chem guys ;^). start with this simple approach mentality and,if you 
are of
the mindset that enjoys all the complexities of brewing delve into all 
that
later.


Hope that helps.

Subject: Screen in boiling kettle


I have a ten gallon Polarware kettle that I use as my boiling vessel. I   
really enjoy the easy of use of opening the ball valve at the bottom and   
draining the cooled wort into my carboy. My only complaint is the amount   
of trub and hop particles that make it out of the kettle.


I would like to rig some sort of screen / filter on the inside of the   
kettle so the trub and hop particles get filtered out before being   
drained into the carboy.


Currently, I use the whirlpool technique on the cooled wort, and I use a   
screen inside a funnel on top of the carboy. I've heard of people using   
chore boys (stainless or copper pot scrubbies), an Easy Masher screen,   
and the Sure Screen for their screen / filter.


What I am looking for is specific ways in which a screen / filter was   
attached to the inside of the kettle.

Subject: an alternative to magnetic stirrers


Although the recent thread on magnetic stirrers had me longing for the days
when I worked in a lab and could borrow equipment at will, there is a
cheaper and more available method of yeast rousing for the non-tinkerers.


I use a 2L Erlenmeyer flask for all starters.  Instead of keeping the yeast
roused with a stirrer, I use an aquarium pump, HEPA filter, and cap the
flask with a foam stopper.  All are available from Williams Brewing (std.
disclaimer).  The key is the foam stopper.  The aquarium tubing can be
inserted in the neck of the flask and "sealed" up with the stopper.  Because
the stopper is soft, it molds around the thin diameter tubing very well
(pushing it against the side of the neck) and provides a good method for
diffusion of air without worrying about dust or associated bugs from getting
in the starter.  Total cost of equipment= <$25.  If you want to be real
fancy you could add an aerating stone to the end of the line for better
diffusion of the air, but I haven't found it necessary.  Besides, it can
double the cost of the set-up and I am, above all else, "frugal".


Anyhoo, the action of the pump keeps the yeast roused and provides a
constant O2 source for growth.  Conceivably this could be done in any sized
container as long as the diameter of the neck was reasonably similar to that
of an Erlenmeyer flask.  I'll be testing this theory out tonight on a
3-gallon carboy.

Jeremy reports  a "slick" mouthfeel in a doctored high diacetyl beer,
AJ reports that slickness has been attributed to high diacetyl levels.
Thank you both for the responses.


Slick is a more accurate descriptor than the term "oily" that I
employed.  One other datapoint - upon reviewing my log book I found a
similar notation after tasting one of my rare lager attempts - pilsner
brewed `at`52-55F using 2 sachets Superior (dry) lager yeast in a 5
gallon batch.

I used them once about a year ago after I was given a sample. The
directions provided with them are very accurate, and the number of
tablets I used provided me with exactly the amount of carbonation I was
looking for. Since the PITA part of bottling for me is sanitizing all
the bottles, it didn't save a whole lot of time or effort (although I
was spared an extra step of racking into my bottling vessel -- Alan
McKay's concerns about excess sediment were unfounded in my case, but
others may vary of course).


There were a couple minor gripes (one of which the instructions warn
about). Because of the surface area of the tablets providing nucleation
sites for CO2 evolvement, there was some foaming during bottling.
Nothing excessive, but enough to leave a little ring of foam at the top
of the fill line. Because of this, I needed to be a little more
dilligent about cleaning bottles after use. The other gripe isn't
addressed: The instructions say the tabs are sanitary as packaged. But
what about the leftover ones I had? Will they remain reasonably
sanitary, or am I screwed. I haven't tried to test which possibility is
the more likely.


The low-down on these buggers: Convenient, well-made, easy-to-use, but
I don't know if it's enough of a time or effort saver to warrant the
extra expense (two packs would cost me about as much as 3 pounds of
dextrose). I would bet the best use would be for people who keg who
want to bottle a small portion of the batch.

It's been some years ince I've had a Corona, and I don't remember it being
anything special,  But I think that if you'd make a Pilsner-type with
6-row, lots of corn (30%) and perhaps some sugar (10%) and hop it to ~20
IBU, you'd be in the ballpark.  Leaving the bottles in the sun for a little
while will give it that familiar skunk smell, or mayber you'd like to

Until about 5 years ago when the liquor laws were completely 
reformed, there were a lot of really stupid ones back in Nova
Scotia.  For example, establishments could either be a "Bar" or
a "Tavern".  The former was allowed to sell bottled beer and
hard liquor, but nothing on tap.  The latter was allowed to sell
bottled beer and draught, but no hard liquor.  (Not sure where
wine fit in, as I never drank it).


The list went on and on, but finally someone woke up and reformed
the laws.  Still no booze in corner stores like Quebec, though ;-)

Jeff, I believe what you are seeing are precipitated carbonates, especially
given that you mentioned that your water is somewhat hard (read high in Mg
and/or Ca). The problem, as I mentioned in a recent post, is that simply
boiling your brewing water may actually be raising the pH and hurting you
when it comes time to sparge (assuming you are doing an all grain batch). This
may be less of a problem if you have let the water sit all night assuming 
it can re-equilibrate with the CO2 in the air but this may not be happening
due to the water temp, low surface to volume ratio, and you're probably
leaving the lid on the pot to keep down evaporation. At any rate, if you are
sparging it is probably a good idea to check the pH of your sparge water and
make adjustments as necessary...

You are almost certainly  right that stirring will not get as much O2 into
solution as would  applying gas (either air or O2) directly but my intuition
tells me that the contribution from stirring need not be "negligible." You are
also right in pointing out the added effects of keeping the yeast in
suspension and CO2 elimination -  both of which will encourage faster yeast
growth independent of the oxygen content.

Hmmmmmm depends. First, on when the yeast are synthesizing their sterols and
UFAs. The individual cells are most likely performing this throughout
their growth - before, during, and after they actually "bud." Indeed, each
cell will go through the cell cycle more than once (depending on innoculum
size and culture volume) during the approach to stationary phase. Second, how
is the sterter media treated? as you say, dissolved O2 will be zero for all
practical purposes immediately after boiling - but if one then cools and stirs
vigorously for a good period of time in a large enough container with good
access to air prior to innoculation it seems to me you'd have a fair amount of
oxygen in solution at that point. I wish I had a dissolved O2 sensor then I
could check this out for myself - anyone  have one along with some time to
kill?? 


One thing I do wonder about is how much oxygen the yeast uptake after they
have "spent" the media and are in stationary phase? I wonder if they can build
up their sterols/UFAs at this point if kept strirring? Here, there would be
little positive pressure in the vessel due to CO2 generation and I assume you
could get good aeration. Would the energy required come at the expense of
glycogen reserves?


Lastly, a while back I read several scientific papers (AHHHH science rears
it's ugly head again!) on yeast sterol/fatty acid metabolism and there were
clear cases of increased levels of these compounds in actively growing
cultures that were merely "open" to air (cotton plug in flask neck) so it does
seem that significant amounts of oxygen can dissolve in the growth media even
when the culture is "purging" the airspace by CO2 evolution...

Subject: Oxygen in stirred worts


Howdy all,
        I am a budding molecular biologist who spent some time working in a
lab that studies yeast mitochondria.  Yeast grown in media that contain
fermentable sugars, such as wort, would invariably have shrunken mitochondria
because they did not respire.  In order to get big bulging mitochondria we
could purify, we would grow the yeast in medium that had carbon sources which
required respiration for growth, i.e. glycerol, ethanol, lactate, etc.
Anyway, we grew yeast in these media in a shaking water bath in erlenmeyer
flasks with aluminum foil covers.  The only way they could grow was if there
was significant oxygen around for them to respire.  Now, I am the first to
admit that we did not measure the oxygen tensions over time in these media,
but I am satisfied with the assumption that when continually shaking or
stirring the wort, significant amounts of oxygen do get into the medium.
Further, I have noticed that when I shake my starters I get more yeast than if
I just let them grow on the bench top, particularily if I start them from a
few colonies.  Which reminds me that I can get a single colony from a fresh
plate to 250 mL saturated culture in a day and a half with shaking, so they
are probably making sterols and unsaturated fatty acids using oxygen that
dissolves in the medium as it is shaking.
        Key word is "probably."  Just my observations.  Hope it helps.

I just wanted to chime in about two items. 


As far as the readability of Jethro's posts go: If you can't read 'em, try
harder or give up. I find them to be filled to the brim with valuable
information. Often Jethro's posts are the only place I can learn about the
topics he discusses. I have found his posts to pass on information about
our fellow brewers, as well as people important to the brewing community.
That alongside the generally excellent quality information he has about
yeasts, BWs, and so forth. On the other hand, if you aren't interested in
the information he has to offer, give up. There's no shame in it.


I have also seen Mr. Gump type, so I am thankful for ANY output.(just
kidding, Rob)


Pat Babcock exists. Otherwise who wrote that cool quote on the backs of
those MCAB shirts? If a cyber entity can prove that IT is indeed Pat
Babcock, I'll give it some extra RAM (computers don't care about money).

Subject: Re: SS/Cu/Al Dielectric Corrosion


Alan Mc Kay asked in the HBD yesterday about using a stainless steel
and/or copper fitting on an aluminum pot, and the possibility of
dielectric corrosion. The corrosion engineers call it galvanic
corrosion, and it is the result of dissimilar metals being immersed in
an electrolyte. This forms a very small electric potential across the
metals, essentially a battery, which can corrode the metal. All metals
are arranged on a galvanic series from least noble (more likely to
corrode) to most noble, and the farther apart on the series, the worse
the corrosion will be. Of the three metals mentioned, stainless steel is
the most noble, then copper (I assume you will have a copper alloy, like
brass, not pure copper, although there isn't much difference between
them electochemically speaking), then aluminum.  However, the relative
surface areas of the three metals will help you somewhat. If the more
active metal part (the aluminum pot in this case) is much larger than
the more noble metal part (stainless steel), the predominant
polarization of the smaller part tends to inhibit the corrosion.


You can do two things: 1) isolate the parts from each other the best you
can. I used PTFE (Teflon) washers to make up a bulkhead fitting for a
converted sanke keg, you could do the same thing. If the metals don't
touch each other, or at least if you minimize the touching areas,
galvanic corrosion is not going to be as much of a concern. Or 2) don't
worry about it, because galvanic corrosion is a pretty slow process, and
you will keep the pot dry for 99% of its life and the corrosion will not
take place without the electrolyte present. I would do both. Good Luck
and Happy Brewing.

Subject: Multi-tier questions


Hello,


  I am in the process of designing a two tier all grain brewing system
and was wondering what methods do you use to clean the system after
brewing.  Do you all grain brewers using multi tier systems disassemble
you systems to clean them, fill them with water and run it through all
your vessles and lines, etc.  I have a design that I like, however the
sanitization and cleaning worries me a little.  Is sanitization really a
problem in your systems because you are working with very hot water at
some point in all the vessles in your system except the fermenter.  I
have a drawing of the system at
http://www.labs.net/jbrown/Doug/Brew/two_tier.htm  If anyone with RIMS
experience and all grain brewing would like to comment on the design and
provide suggestions, or identify problems I would like that very much.  


  I really appreciate all the help and information that I have received
on this digest and from all members the provided information directly.


Thanks
  Doug Brown

i imagine there might be a few problems to think about.  first, with regard
to applying heat to the pot with a false bottom in place:  since the bottom
is stainless, has no aluminum or copper "sandwich", and recirculation is not
mentioned, there is definitely a scorching potential.  you can't get to the
bottom of the pot with a false bottom installed, so there's a risk you won't
be able to easily stir up the bottom liquid fraction to distribute heat
throughout the mash evenly.


secondly, you should consider grain depth in the polarware pot.  i've got
one, and it's a fairly big diameter.  the depth of the grain bed is going to
be shallower by quite a bit versus a smaller diameter cooler.  how much
shallower?  hmmmm.  if, for example, you have a grain bed depth of 6 inches
in the gott (diameter ~13 in.), putting the same volume into a 15 gallon
polarware kettle (diameter ~18 in.) would reduce your grain bed depth down
to about 3.1 inches.  this can introduce difficulty with achieving good
clarity in the vorlauf process.  if you move up to 10 gallon batches, you're
probably ok.

this brings up something i've been thinking about.  the weak sanitation link
in my process is the chilling process, which, as ron states, goes much
faster if i agitate the immersion coil while chilling.  this means my kettle
is uncovered during the 20 - 30 minutes it takes me to get the wort down to
lager or ale pitching temps.  in the summer, i have concerns about airborne
contaminants getting into the brew.  has anybody figured out a way to combat
this?  my best idea so far is to leave the chiller stationary, cover the
whole thing with saran wrap, and agitate the kettle.  this is a big pain in
the rear, though.


i was thinking how much easier this would be if i had a little mechanized
"lifter" that i could prop under one edge of the kettle.  the lifter would
be able to push the kettle up about an inch and then let it back down, and
continue cycling this way to keep the wort moving in contact with the
chiller.  jack s, is there a market???????

Subject: Water


Alan Meeker and Jeff Luck posted on very similar issues. Let's look at
Alan's comments first:


When he boiled his nominal (east coast surface) water the pH increased
by 1 unit which he ascribes to loss of CO2. This is indeed the cause.
Most waters of this type as delivered by the water works are about
saturated with or slightly super saturated with CO2. The solubility of
CO2 decreases dramatically with increased temperature so that heating
causes loss of the gas upsetting the equilibrium between carbonic acid,
bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions. The pH shifts upwards in order to
establish a new equilibrium with a lower carbonic fraction (and
increased bicarbonate and carbonate). Upon cooling, the water is
undersaturated with CO2 and some dissolves from the air. If the water
was originally just saturated it will eventually return to its initial
pH.


When Alan added gypsum to the water there was no pH change. Gypsum is
the salt of calcium hydroxide, a strong base, and sulfuric acid, a
strong acid so the salt is approximately neutral. Upon heating, CO2 is
driven off causing the pH shift towards the high end and concomitant
conversion of bicarbonate to carbonate. Now, however, calcium ion is
present which coalesces to form calcium carbonate which precipitates.
This results in the release of H+ ions which is why the pH shift is not
as dramatic in this case. Chalk is white. The fact that this ppt. is
brown suggests that the water contains some iron and/or manganese. Upon
standing and cooling, CO2 from the air again dissolves lowering the pH.
Wait long enough and the precipitate will redissolve. This can be
accelerated for demonstration purposes by bubbling CO2 through the
sample.


Alan comments on the mysteries surrounding the phosphate reaction. In
simplified form it is:


                                               H+
H+               Ca++
                                               ^
^                    \
             phytase                      /
/                      \->
phytin -----------> H2PO4-  ---->  HPO4--  ---->  PO4---
- ------>Ca3(PO4)2


i.e. the enzyme phytase frees inorganic phosphate from organic phytin.
(Thanks to Al K for suggesting this way of diagramming). Some of this
sheds protons to become phosphate (PO4---). In the presence of calcium a
precipitate is formed and this results in conversion of more H2PO4- and
HPO4-- to phosphate throwing off protons along the way. These protons
overcome  the alkalinity (buffering capacity) of the  water and are
responsible for the reduction in pH. It's not really a buffering action.
The more calcium the more phosphate will.


Alan comments that he was sparging with alkaline water based on the pH
of 8.5 -9. Note that alkalinity and pH are not the same thing. In fact
the alkalinity of Alan's tap watrer is probably about 80 ppm as CaCO3
which is not very alkaline at all. Adding gypsum to this water will not
reduce the alkalinity nor increase it. It is probably not necessary to
acidify this water for sparge. As it isn't very alkaline the acid
released by the phytin reaction will probably keep the pH below 6 to the
point where the runoff is down to 2 - 4 P. Try it. In the same regard it
is probably not necessary to acidify this water for mash. There's a good
chance of hitting pH 5.5 - 5.6 without it. If not, add a little crystal
malt to the grist. Note: I  don't personally like adding acid for mash
pH control. Water hardness and higher kilned malts will generally do the
job. This is just my personal preference in this matter. I'm not saying
that there is anything wrong with pH adjustment by the use of acid -
mineral or organic.


Comment  on "THE SKINNY": You can effectively lower mash pH by boiling
and calcium addition if you do it right. In Alan's case, if he had
decanted the water off the precipitate quickly and mashed with that
water he would find the mash pH lower than with the untreated tap water,
even if the decanted water had been allowed to stand. This is because
the precipitate (calcium carbonate) is formed from bicarbonate ion in
the water and since this is the source of alkalinity when this is
removed the alkalinity goes down. Hardness is removed at the same time
so it is beneficial to supplement with calcium (chloride or sulfate
depending on the taste effects you want).


Now on to Jeff Luck's question about what's the white stuff that forms
when he boils his water. In terms of the previous discussion, it should
be clear that the white stuff is calcium carbonate with perhaps some
magnesium carbonate. Jeff tells us that his water is quite hard. We
already know this when he tells us that the precipitate forms without
addition of any additional calcium (as opposed to Alan's softer water
which requires calcium supplementation for precipitate formation).

Subject: Rye beer


Hello all,


I've seen rye beers (roggenbier) discussed here occasionally, and I'm
curious as to whether I'd like the taste enough to try brewing one.  Can
anyone suggest favorite commercial varieties to try?  Redhook makes an ale
called Ryehook; are rye brews primarily ales or lagers?  What are some of
the characteristics that distinguish a rye beer?


The archives don't offer a clear consensus (surprise!) as to whether rye
malt or rye flakes are preferable.  Some brewers claim flakes promote stuck
sparges, while others blame malt.  Most do agree, however, that over 20%
rye can clog up the sparge.  What's the difference (if any) in the final
product using malt vs. flakes?  Not many places carry rye malt, but most
have the flakes - maybe that's an indication.


Assuming I'll decide to brew a rye beer, does anyone have a favorite
recipe?  Are there yeast strains that are particularly well suited for the
style?  Any other pointers?


Brew more,


Greg

Subject: Re: Galvanic Corrosion between Al, Cu, SS


Alan asks whether attaching a copper (brass??) ball valve with stainless
steel washers to an aluminum pot would be a dielectric (sic) corrosion
problem.


Survey says: Maybe.
The long answer is yes, there will galvanic corrosion, but the question is
 - how much?
Is this going to be your brewpot, hot water tank, or what?
Aluminum will corrode when coupled to stainless steel or copper/brass.
Stainless steel is the most inert here. If your usage is intermittant, then
your corrosion should be minimal. The fact that you have a large aluminum
surface and a relatively small cathode (steel, copper) decreases your
corrosion rate. Also, if you electrically insulate the ball valve and
tubing from the aluminum via teflon or rubber or something then your
corrosion will be insignificant.


My recommendation is to go ahead and just watch the area near the contact
of the metals for pitting.
Btw, you can't weld other metals to aluminum and soldering to aluminum
(especially this much aluminum) is difficult for both heat required and
fluxing. Best bet is to make a bulkhead fitting out of brass.

Subject: Recirculation tribulations


I've been meaning to ask this question for a while---
I would like to use a centrifugal pump for recirculating wort through the 
grain bed prior to sparging. I'm tired of hovering over the lauter tun to 
perform this mundane brewing task and would like to automate this step. I 
would like to have the output of the lauter tun go into a grant with a liquid 
level switch in it to regulate the operation of the pump. At the end of the 
recirculation loop I would have some kind of manifold to gently return the 
wort under the surface of the standing liquid. Between the pump output and 
the manifold would be a valve to control the flow rate. OK, so far so good; 
the thing that I can't seem to figure out is how to keep the wort from 
flowing backwards through the pump once it has turned off, which it would do 
once the liquid level in the grant reached a certain level. The only thing I 
can think of to avoid this is a check valve. Is this the way to go? It seems 
that check valves require a bit of pressure to open (5 lbs per sq. in. or so) 
and may do away with the gentle approach altogether. I am interested in 
hearing about how others approach this type of recirculation setup.

I assume you are force carbonating your kegs.  Otherwise, there should not
be much difference since the keg is just a big bottle that would also trap
secondary fermentation products.


I have made a similar observation to yours, but in my case the difference
was noted between kegged beer and CP filled bottles of the same beer.  I
thought it was great out of the keg and ordinary out of the bottle.  I
think there's a lot going on when dispensing out of a keg that is not
simply duplicated when dispensing from a bottle.   I recently CP filled a
strong bitter, something like a Fuller's.  To be true to style, it was
minimally carbonated in the keg.  But, because the beer is under
continuous pressure when dispensing from the keg, it is simple to put a
nice head on the glass that laces all the way down.  The CP filled bottles
seemed to have the right carbonation level, but were lacking aroma and
flavor and poured with very little foam.  I believe that the bursting
bubbles in the head are responsible for delivering a large portion of the
aroma and flavor of the beer.  Remember, you can only taste sweet, sour,
bitter, and salty, so most of what you taste depends on your nose.  So, I
would advise you to adjust your carbonation level in the keg before CP
filling to be appropriate for the style.  Terry Foster recommends in
Classic Style Series Pale Ale volume to carbonate draught pale ales to
0.75 to 1.0 volumes and bottled beers to 1.5 to 2.0 volumes.  This process
is likely to be style dependent and require lots of tuning.


Concerning equipment and procedure, I use the Hoptech filler that has a
single 3-way valve.  It's pretty simple and I highly recommend it.  I
would not touch one that has 3 valves.  I know people that are happy with
the Counter Phil CP filler, but as I understand it, it relies on siphon to
draw beer from the keg and therefore requires the bottle to be below the
keg.  I prefer to have my keg on the floor and the bottles on the
countertop.  Any who has one care to comment?  It is imperative that you
have your beer and bottles very cold before filling, as close to freezing
as possible, as this helps keep the CO2 in solution.  Early attempts at CP
filling can be quite messy and frustrating.  Persist.  The process is also
much more efficient if you have a helper cap while you fill.
