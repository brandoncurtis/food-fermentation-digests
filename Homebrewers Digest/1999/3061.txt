- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
>From Clayton Cone...
The role of oxygen in fermentation is not a simple subject to discuss.
Repitched yeast desperately needs oxygen early in the fermentation. It has
depleted its lipid content during the previous fermentation and needs oxygen
to produce more lipids so that it can begin to multiply again. Lipids act as
a growth factor during the growth phase and then protects the yeast from
alcohol toxicity during the latter part of the fermentation.


Active Dry Beer Yeast  has a large supply of lipids built into each yeast
cell at the factory. There should be enough to get the cells through their
growth phase in the wort.  However, it is questionable if there is enough
lipids left to protect the cell against the alcohol toxicity later in the
fermentation. There has not been enough research directed specifically at
this area. If a large inoculum is used chances are that there will be enough
lipids left in each cell to protect the cell. If a small inoculum is used
and the yeast has to multiply more, there may not be enough lipids left
especially for higher alcohol beer. A low alcohol beer would be less toxic
while a higher alcohol beer would be more toxic.


One saturation of oxygen (8 ppm) for low alcohol beer and two saturations
(16 ppm) of oxygen for high alcohol beer will always be good insurance. The
ideal time to add the oxygen for repitched yeast is at the very beginning.
The ideal time to add the oxygen for Active Dry Beer Yeast is after about
the 14th hour for Ale and 24th hour for Lager.  This is usually not
practical, so oxygen at the very beginning will be satisfactory.


The Active Dry Yeast will go through its lag phase and begin growth and
fermentation no matter how much oxygen is present in the wort because of the
Crabtree Effect.  When the sugar in a wort is above 0.2 %, the mitochondria
bodies are effected in such a way that the yeast will produce alcohol no
matter how much oxygen is present. The only growth that will occur is from
the lipids produced. In the manufacture of the yeast at our factory, the
sugar source has to be fed to the growing yeast at a rate that  will keep
the sugar below 0.2%. When we wish to activate and build into the yeast
certain fermentation enzymes, we increase the sugar level to slightly above
0.2% and the yeast will immediately begin to produce alcohol even though
huge volumes of air is bubbling through the media. The yeast will continue
to
grow while producing the alcohol because of the lipids already present in
the cell wall.


The simplest way to rehydrate the Active Dry Beer Yeast is in warm, 105 F.
tap water. Usually tap water contains some degree of hardness.   We have
found that distilled water and deionized water are harmful to the yeast
resulting in many dead cells.  Probably, because of osmotic pressure
differences, an unregulated amount of water will flow into the yeast cell
rupturing some of the organelles.   Rehydrating at 105 F. water containing
sugar is also harmful. Some enzymes are activated by the sugar and
subsequently damaged by the temperature.


Because of the salts present in many yeast foods, it is not advisable to add
the yeast food to the rehydrating yeast. Reverse osmosis from the yeast cell
to the rehydrating water  can occur. The yeast food should be added directly
to the wort. Fermaid K is designed specifically for this.


It is surprising how much of the nitrogen, required by the yeast, is bound
up with the sugar during the heating stage and storage in the production of
the malt extract at the factory and during the boiling step when preparing
the wort from grain. This is because of the Maillard reaction. The nutrient
is present but cannot be utilized by the yeast.


If the beer maker wishes to be especially nice to the yeast, 0,5 - 1%
autolyzed yeast or yeast extract can be added to the rehydrating water
before adding the dry yeast.


The reason that the manufacturer recommends the rehydration time of 15 - 30
minutes is to take advantage of the large carbohydrate reserve of glycogen
and trehalose built into the cell at the factory. After 30 minutes the yeast
begins to burn up this reserve. It is better if the yeast goes into the wort
with these reserves to get the fermentation off to a faster start. No
serious damage is done to the yeast if there is a slight delay in adding the
yeast to the wort. The fermentation will just get off to a slower start.


There may be some O2 bubbling off during the rehydration.  However, some of
the bubbles are CO2 coming from the yeast metabolizing the carbohydrate
reserve.

Personally, I know that yeast are no longer freeze-dried by Lallemand...It
is done on a 'Fluid-Bed Dryer," a device that regulates the temperature and
volume/velocity of a heated air-stream that flows from the bottom of the
device, through the extrusions of yeast that have been sent there. This
upward airflow creates a 'fluid bed' as the yeast is 'roiled' by the
airstream moving vertically. Too much velocity and the yeast leaves the
chamber....too little, and it drops out. Temperature is regulated lower as
the process ensues.


This info is only offered to join Nate's discussion....if I wanted to pick

As I am involved with Lallemand, I am curious as to which hB shops out there
offer our products, and would love to hear from owners and customers about
their Lallemand experiences.
If you would send your comments to me along with info on the shop...like

Wild Heather Ale (makes 30 pints) 
- ---------------------------------
Ingredients: 


     2.5 kg milled pale malted barley 
     250 g milled crystal malt 
     cold water 
     small pieces of fat (animal or vegetable) 
     8 large handfuls heather flowers 
     2 handful bog myrtle leaves 
     2 teaspoons baker's yeast or beer yeast 
     1 level teaspoon sugar or honey per 750 ml bottle 


Method:
Put the milled pale malted barley and crystal malt into a 3 gallon jam or
jelly pan. Mix
with cold water, then add more water to cover grain and stir into a slack,
sloppy
mixture. 


Heat very slowly, over 3 hours, until warm. Do not allow the temperature to
go above 70
degrees centigrade - the use of a small piece of fat (animal or vegetable)
will indicate
the temperature: solid = cold, runny = warm, small beads = too hot. 
If it gets too hot remove from heat and mix until cooler. Mix every half
hour, removing
the fat with a spoon each time whilst mixing. 


Peg a coarse dishcloth over a second pan or bucket and strain out liquor,
rinse the
grains with several kettles of hot water and leave to drain. Boil this
liquid for one
hour with 5 handfuls of heather flowers and 1 handful of bog myrtle leaves. 


Rinse the dishcloth and peg over the fermentation bucket, place 3 handfuls
of heather
and 1 of bog myrtle in the cloth and then pour the hot liquor over this into
the bucket,
make up the bucket to 30 pints with cold water and leave to cool to body
temperature.


Add 2 teaspoons of baker's yeast or a sachet of beer yeast and leave for 6-8
days to
ferment. (Adding more wild heather flowers will ferment the ale but the
flavour will
be more sour and wine-like.) 


Once the ale has stopped fizzing pour it into returnable strong screw top
lemonade or
beer bottles (750ml). Add one level teaspoon of sugar or honey to each
bottle, replace
top and store in a cool place until clear.

History: 
   "Set up by Bruce Williams to brew Fraoch, a Heather Ale, a common brew
from
   the dark ages, but a beer not produced until Bruce commenced in June
1992.
   After years of warring between Scotland and England the Act of Union was
   passed in 1707 when Scotland became part of The United Kingdom and along
   with wearing Tartan, playing bagpipes and highland gatherings, Heather
Ale
   was outlawed. After hearing of the recipe in his Glasgow home brew shop
in
   1986 Bruce Williams decided to revive the original brew. This was first
produced
   at the West Highland Brewery but moved to Maclays in 1993 where Bruce
   continues to brew himself. Fraoch is made from flowering heather but
special
   storage conditions adopted in 1996 allowed the beer to be produced all
year
   round, but at two different strengths to match the season. The bottled
version is
   sold all over the world and in 1996 the USA World Beer Championship
awarded
   Fraoch a Gold Medal. In 1996 Bruce commenced brewing Grozet. The name is
   derived from the auld Scots term for a gooseberry. The 'Hairy Grape' has
been
   used to produce alcoholic beverages since mediaeval times and the latest
   version is an ale from malted barley and wheat, spiced with bog myrtle
and then
   after fermentation ripe Scottish gooseberries are added to create ' a
fruity flavour
   and refreshing sweetness'." 


   Fraoch Ale ABV: 4.10% and 5.4% Reported !!?
   Grozet (Gooseberry ale) ABV: 5%

we should write HBD under our names to help recognize each other. I

I visited the brewery last month and asked very specifically if the
bottling yeast and the main yeast were the same.  The guide (who seemed
to have a clue) said yes.  The main ferment HOWEVER is not at 78F: it is
5 days at room temp (somewhere in the 60's) and then 3 weeks at ?35F?
(it was 35 or 40F).  After bulk conditioning cold, it is filtered and
extra yeast and sugar added before bottling.  Finally, it carbonates in
the bottle for 3 weeks at 78F (this room is heated most of the year).
The times are approximate except for the 5 days (I remember thinking
that was pretty quick for a triple).


As to whether the yeast is good: I have cultured up several bottles and
it tasted good in the starter.  A couple people have used it but I have
not heard the long term reports (they thought it was pretty good right
after bottling).  I am planning on brewing a small test batch this
weekend to get an idea of how it performs in my basement (which seems
pretty constant at 69F).

When you work stainless, cutting, grinding welding, you bring iron to the
surface. The iron once exposed will rust. I assume this is where you are
noticing the rust.


You might want to try passivating the surface to restablish the protective
chromium oxide layer. I believe john Palmer's page has the information.

Message text written by INTERNET:lkbonham`at`hbd.org
>Additionally, I have run Clinitest assays on about 15 beers that were 
made
as
part of a parallel yeast test by Randy Veasey and Phil Endacott (i.e., 
same
wort
[OG: 1.044], different yeasts).  FG's on the various beers ranged from
1.007 to
1.012.  The Clinitest levels of these beers ranged from slightly below
0.25% to
slightly above 0.5%, and the Clinitest results correlated very nicely 
with
attenuation levels.

Louis,


I think it looks OK, but please put in the comments
that the tests you ran are on beers which have
been primed and commercial beers and not
according to the protocol I suggested. Include
my comments about the fact that both can have
residual sugar (possibly  incomplete fermentation
of the priming sugar and/or chilling and filtration.)
While they are in the ballpark, they do not
represent an actual test of the claim.


Perhaps the one thing we can learn from your
experiment on these primed beers is the fact
that one of the primed beers showed a reading
of <1/4% ( if the reading is correct) which
demonstrates that  Clinitest is NOT responding
to the dextrins or at least marginally ( remember
these are all the same wort) - a very important
point.


The fact that there is a parallel between the FG
and Clinitest reading is also important. My
interpretation is that it is due to the remaining
priming sugar since these measurements you
made did not correspond to the actual FG
(and are not attenutation levels) but to an SG
number you measured on the primed beer. 


Did you ever figure out your problems with
the standard or the dropper size?? Were the
results you reported done with the Clinitest
eyedropper or were they with your modification
of the test using a pipette? 


 


You may also wish to comment that 0.5% sugar
is on the order of magnitude of one or two SG units.


You may want to explain who Dr. Farnsworth
is. No disrespect intended, but I don't know
( and others may not) nor have I ever read
anything he wrote, as far as I know.  I have
been using Clinitest for several decades.


We have yet to see any protocol from
Herlache or from you, which you intend
to submit to HBDers. I'd like to see it
before it gets submitted. It may save a
lot of pain and future explanation.


PS. After composing the above,  I read
your submission in the HBD. I suggest
you give us a chance to comment prior
to publication on submissions like this
in the future.




Keep on Brewin'

One question I have is, is the keg rusting or is it happening at rivets or
welded seams?  I assume that it is happening at a weld which is a common
problem with low quality stainless.  Here is the technical nerdy way of saying
it I hope you can follow along.  The keg is probably Ferritic (400 series)
stainless.  To be effective it must have at least 12% chromium (Cr).  Other
alloying agents can bring the effective Cr percentage down below 12%.  These
mainly being carbon and nitrogen.  Especially in the presence of heat (i.e.
welding).  Upon heating you get chromium carbide forming.  This takes Cr from
the steel thus lowering the corrosion resistance.

Hope this makes HBD by the Saturday issue (as I'm leaving
Sunday a.m.).


Any recommendations for don't miss brewpubs, pubs, or beer bars
in and around Long Beach (California) would be most appreciated.
I'll be staying near the end of the 710 fwy.


Thanks,

Subject: Rusting Stainless Steel, Ommegang Yeast


The question about Ommegang yeast  has come up before, it was answered
in HBD 2924, in January 1999. Check the archives. The head brewer
responded that they use the same strain at bottling as the beer is
brewed with.


I was sorry to hear about Jack Schmidling's rusting keg mailbox. My
guess is that the stainless steel was wire brushed or ground at sometime
in its history with carbon steel tools. These can leave a messy rust
bloom that is not easy to remove. Some stainless steels will rust,
especially the 400 series steels, but since you said it was nonmagnetic,
that rules that out. I bet that the steel is a low grade 304 or 302
stainless steel. The best way to remove the rust is to wire brush with
stainless steel brush, on a drill or angle grinder if needed, then allow
the metal to passivate for a week or so, then cover with a clear coat.
That is what the Nickel Development Institute recommends for decorative
applications. Just make sure that the clearcoat is non-yellowing in the
sun.

Subject: Itallian Food & Italian Beer


Jeff Porterfield <jporterf`at`erols.com> was wondering about beer with
Italian food and about the existence of Italian beers in HBD 3056.


I live on Staten Island (the forgotten borough of NYC) where many of the
restaurants serve Italian food.  I happen to like porter, double bock,
and Belgian double with Italian food, although most of the local
restaurants serve wimpy Pilsner styles.  I miss the Belgian restaurant
that closed where I first sampled Orval, Chimay, Affligem etc.


I've had three Italian beers: Peroni and Moretti, which make clean light
lagers, and Moretti La Rossa, a reddish bock somewhere between double
bock and May bock.  Moretti La Rossa is the sort of malty sweet beer
that I think goes very well with Italian food.


Cheers
Ted

Mark (aka Randy) only used his mashmixer (
http://www.flash.net/~arkmay/Mark/rsf_tour/msm.html ) on 5 gallon batches. 
Anyone have a proven design for 10+ gallon batches?  If so, what are the
specs?  After having a taste of the no-stir life, I gotta have one!  No
carpal tunnel for me!....
