Subject: converting kegs


Hello all,


Just wanted to share some of my experiences with converting 15 gallon 
kegs into mash tuns, brewing pots, and fermenters.  I've done some 
cutting with a dremel tool and also with an 8" abrasive cut-off blade for 
a circular saw.  A plasma torch was also used for a few of the cuts.  The 
best results were with the 8" abrasive wheel.  It was over 10X faster 
than using a dremel tool and the cut was much smoother than the plasma 
torch cut.


Does anyone have any advice on the best (cheepest is also good) way to 
install a dial thermometer into a mash tun?  I'm limited on stainless 
steel fittings and pipe, so the best I can come up with is to buy an 
industrial grade thermometer with 1/4" male pipe thread behind the dial.  
Then I could just drill a hole in the keg, place an O-ring behind the 
dial and clamp it to the keg with a 1/4" female coupling.  Possible 
problems are damaging the thermometer from the pressure of the fit, and 
the thermometer would be exposed to dammage from stirring even if pipe 
surrounded the stem.


Any ideas?

Subject: generic water formula


Given some of the earlier posts on water content, I'm probably stepping 
onto a land mine...
I want to base my beer off of bottled water, so I'm looking for 
information on minerals I should add (if any).


1.  If there's a standard, what is the standard mineral content of 
bottled water?  Calcium content?
2. Beyond calcium `at` 50 ppm acidifying the mash to about 5.2 pH, is there 
anything else that needs to be added that wouldn't be present in bottled 
water already?


I'm not trying to copy any regional water styles, just start with water 
that won't negatively affect proteolytic or diastatic enzymes.
Thanks.

Jack, the original poster never mentioned using a false bottom or scorching
as a problem.


I have used a false bottom for 10 years and have not ever found scorching
to be a problem. The exception would be using a pot with a very thin bottom
(which would also cause scorching during a boil).


Without "rational control of heat" during temperature raises (fast
temperature raise), a false bottom may cause jumps in overall mash
temperature, but not scorching. Temperature jumps are due to temperature
difernetials above and below the FB. To avoid these jumps the brewer can
use Mash Recirculation and/or slower heating of the mash.

Keith wasn't impressed with his CAP.  I, for one, can say that CAP can be a
great beer!  I used one of Jeff Renner's original recipes using the 2035
(Schell) yeast.  I kind of mistreated this beer and it came out to be one
of the best I've ever brewed.  It was excellent.  


My regards to Keith...don't give up on this one.  You mentioned that the
head didn't last...did you utilize the infamous "protein rest"?  I rested
the mash at 104 deg F and then went directly to saccharification (as direct
as possible).  No haze and a long lasting head. I also used flaked
maize...I'll use corn grits later this summer.

I've had three Italian beers: Peroni and Moretti, which make clean light

Subject: Acidity, INventory file.


Brewsters:


Bill Frazier's suggestion to use potassium
bicarbonate for the reduction of acidity in
meads will work, but not as well as in grape
wines where the major acid is tartaric and
potassium bitartrate is unusually
insoluble for an alkalai metal salt. More than
likely the potassium will stay in solution and
in high concentration give a salty taste to
the mead.


Likely, calcium carbonate is more readily
available and  works well in meads as the
solubility of many simple organic acid
calcium salts are of low solubility,
especially at low  T. I guess the major
acids in mead are acetic and lactic, maybe
some citric and tartaric. Anyone know?


Of these, calcium acetate is very soluble
and will not be precipitated easily at low T.
 I do not have a solubility for calcium lactate
or citrate at low T, but presume it is lower
than the acetate in the water alcohol mixture.
Certainly, I suspect, this salt is less soluble
than the potassium salt.


Unlike grape wines which have excellent buffer
systems, mead has virtually none and the
pH needs to be checked as well, especially
in the first days to keep the pH above
around 3.5 or so. This prevents damage to
yeast a low pH will cause and the long slow
incomplete fermentation mead makers often
experience.  If you later decide to adjust the
acidity up, use tartaric acid and then cold
condition it to bring down calcium  tartrates
and any potassium bitartrate. You should
check the acidity afterwards.


What happened to the wine network?
I subscribed ( I think) but haven't heard
anything.

Subject: Disappointment with results of first time all grain. 


     After brewing my second batch of extract with specialty grains, my
brewery was served with an eviction notice. Little did my wife know
what she was getting into when she gave me the start up beer kit as a
graduation present.  Stuck with having to move my operation into the
basement, I decided to serf the net to find an acceptable setup for my
little plot of cement.  I found two great sights that the authors made
their all grain breweries out of plastic buckets (thanks Ken Swartz and
C.D. Prichard).  After several trips to Home Depot (no affiliation), I
built my three tiered all grain brewery.  This consists of a 5 gal.
plastic HLT with two 1500 watt elements to heat the water.  A 5 gal.
round cooler with a home-made stop-sign manifold that I slotted 1/2 way
thru the 1/2 inch copper pipe in 1/2 inch intervals with a Dremal tool
(no affiliation) plumbed into the bottom (slots facing down).  A 12
gal. boiler with two 1500 watt elements and a braided stainless steel
manifold. All electricity runs thru GFI protected circuits.


    For father's day, my former landlord and spousal unit gave me the
ingredients for an amber ale as follows: 
10 lbs. Two row pale malt
1 lb. Dextrin (Cara Pils)
 .5 lb. 120 deg. Crystal malt
 .25 lb. Roasted barley 
1 oz. Cascade  7% alpha 90 min. of boil
 .5 oz. Cascade for 30 min
1 tsp. Irish moss for 30 min.
1 oz.  Cascade at end of boil
 .5 oz. Mt. Hood dry hop in secondary.
1 pt. starter of Wyeast 1056 American Ale
OG = 1.064.     FG = 1.008


      Father's day came and I started brewing. The first thing I did
was heat up the water in the HLT and poured the grains into the mash
turn. When the water was hot enough, I strucked  (turned valve)  4 gal.
of water and mixed (temp. 180deg.).  I stirred like mad, and added soda
pop plastic containers filled with ice until the temp. went down to 155
deg.  I placed the top on the cooler and let sit for 90 minutes.  I
opened the cooler, stirred, took temp (150 deg). and recirculated about
2 qt. of wort. There were no husks in any of the runnings collected, so
I took a sample of the wort for a hydrometer test (1.072 at 80 deg)(is
this good?). I then sparged with 5 gal. of 170deg water until boiler
had 7.75 gal. collected (was this too much water?).  Final running was
1.014 at 80 deg. (is this too much sugar left in the lauter?). For
sparging, I had the metal tube poor the water on top of a veggie
steamer that I confiscated from the previous place of residence. 
        I Fired the boiler (flipped a switch), waited until foam subside, and
add hops according to schedule. After boiling for 90 minutes, I cooled
with an immersion cooler until wort was 70 deg.(18 minutes).  The
specific gravity reading at this point was 1.040 at 70 deg., total wort
collected into fermenter was 5 1/2 gal.
        I was sadly disappointed with this figure. I don't know my efficiency
factor, but obviously left sugar in the grain. I read somewhere that
you should stop sparging when the runnings are about 1.008.  How can I
boost my efficiency without ending up with 10 gallons of wort to boil
down to 5 gallons. I figure that this will take about 5-6 hours to boil
down (unacceptable by the spousal unit). I know that I could add some
DME to boost the SG, but I wanted to do this with all grain. 


       Any comments, recommendations, suggestions will be graciously
accepted. Please keep it simple, I'm not a chemist but a business
major, and this is my third batch made (2 extract, one all grain). If
you want to kick my dog, don't worry she just got a bath so your shoes
won't get dirty (her mouth does move as fast as a cobra though).

Subject: degermination


G'day


Thanks to Jeff Renner and Dave Burley for responding to degermination.
I was a wee bit light on the brewing details.
The maize I used is stock feed quality maize, very dusty. I put it through
the grain crusher, same setting as the barley. The crusher grumbles about it
a bit but eventually does the job. Thinking that the germ at the seed tip
looked a bit tender I tried tumbling it in my gizmo for getting the rootlets
off malted barley. It got rid of a lot of the dusty rubbish but the tip
stayed.




>Brewing texts say that low oil content is necessary to avoid rancid
flavors,


I never noticed any off flavours at all, just bland.


>Bourbon whiskey is made from 70%+ whole corn meal - the oil floats
on top of the fermenting mash like a blood red oil slick.


Would it be possible to boil the maize prior to brew day and skim the oil
off when it has cooled down a bit?


I use a decoction system for brewing, the maize goes in when the first
decoction is just coming to the boil, and is boiled for about 30 mins. I had
expected heading problems, and was curious if there would be any other
effects from the oil content.


>I have found that often beers which are cloudy with starch also have a head
problem and do not have very good mouth feel.


I have never bothered checking for starch (iodine test), I have just assumed
that with a 4hr mash everything is converted. May try the test sometime but
I do like to keep it fairly easy. Use the KISS (keep it simple stupid)
principle.


Another question.


I use a big (200 litre) container for the boil.
It is posible to put a lid on with just an inch pipe outlet for the steam.
If I restrict this outlet a bit more would it increase the temperature at
all, and by how much. Is the steam coming off the same temp as the water
being boiled?
I am after the Maillard reaction for colouring/carmelising the sugars.
How do Guinness achieve their black colour? I have never got better than a
dark brown even with using burnt barley.

I am relatively new to this hobby but have read and absorbed as much as 
possible.  I have read several posts recently about the slow starts with 
Nottingham and Lallemand yeast.  My question will most likely show how little 
I kow about brewing after slightly over a year of messing with this hobby.  
Why can a person not, after hydrating the dry yeast, pitch the slurry in a 
yeast starter?  This would get a good start with the dry yeast, build up the 
cell count and eliminate problems when pitched to the wort?  There must a 
simple answer to this but as of yet I do not know it.  TIA Jerry Conner

I need to make a 0.1N solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). What would be
the recipe? I have a scale and volumetric flasks. 


TIA,
Harlan
