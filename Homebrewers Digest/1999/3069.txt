Greetings.  Duvel is a Golden Strong Ale.  Literature states that this

Dave Clark asks for a cherry beer recipe.  Here is a recipe from an old
homebrew book I have;


6 lbs   light malt extract syrup
1/2 lb  crushed pale malted barley
1/2 lb  crystal malt
1/2 oz  stale old hops (1 to 2 hbu)
10 to 12 lbs sour cherries
ale yeast
brettanomyces bruxellensis yeast culture
brettanomyces lambicus yeast culture


The instructions say to ferment the beer in a 4 gallon volume, then add the
cherries and allow a one month secondary fermentation, then rack to a third
carboy for a month to let the fermentation finish.  The recipe suggested
adding the cherries to 1 gallon of water, heating to 160F for a 30 minute
rest to pasteurize with subsequent cooling before adding to the main
fermentation.


This recipe is for a Kriek.  I tasted St. Louis Kriek in Amsterdam this
spring and it was excellent.  You might try Wyeast 3278 Belgian Lambic
blend.  If you don't want a sour beer just use a regular ale yeast and leave
out the bacteria.

Subject: Stuck fermentation


Long-time lurker, first time poster.....


I recently experienced my first ever stuck fermentation.  The beer is a
German alt, based on Al K's recipe.  Here are the recipe and details for a
6 gal batch:


10lbs Czech light Munich malt
1lb Weyermann melanoidin malt
3/4 t CaCl2, split evenly between the mash and sparge (brewing water is
very soft)
Mashed 75 minutes at 156 degrees -- iodine test confirmed conversion
Ph in mash looked ok (5.2-5.3), though it's hard to tell with the test
papers I have
1oz Spalt pellets, 8.1%, boiled 60 min.
2oz. Hallertau Mittelfruh plugs, 4.8%, boiled 60 min.
OG = 1.062 (volume in primary = 4.75 gallons, so I will dilute with
preboiled water to reach 1.052)
2qt starter of Wyeast 1338 pitched at high kraeusen at 70 degrees
Oxygenated wort with pure O2
Fermented at ~68 degrees
SG at one week = 1.032


Fermentation took off quickly (less than 5 hours).  By the next morning (15
hours), there was a constant stream of bubbles coming out of the airlock.
By that evening, about 24 hours after pitching, the kraeusen had begun to
fall back and activity was much slower.  By the following morning (approx.
36 hours after pitching), all apparent activity had ceased.


At one week, I racked to another carboy ( SG = 1.032) and pitched a new 2qt
starter of ale yeast (cultured from a local brewery, I believe) at high
kraeusen.  I realize that I am technically underpitching, but much less so
than with other beers I have brewed in the past.  The oxygen setup is also
relatively new to my process, and that should have helped.


Now, at the 10 day mark, there is still no activity.


This is my first experience with the 1338 yeast.  Any thoughts on why this
might have happened?  Any remedies or suggestions for rescuing this beer?

I think you may be reading more into this than was meant, but this

I think this is a big leap and nowhere did I read anything to
imply this.  There are many more oligosaccharides than just
maltotriose and maltotetrose and I didn't read anywhere in
this table or supporting quotes that all other oligosaccharides
were consumed by the yeast.  I think you are jumping to
conclusions here, Dave and I don't agree.

Lagers are filtered almost universally, but ales in the UK
are far less likely to be filtered.  *Most* aren't, especially
what's called "Real Ale" or "Cask-conditioned" ales, because
*BY DEFINITION* they are unfiltered.

>is added after the fermentation in some styles.
>Given time, lager yeasts *can* totally remove

Again, you are jumping to conclusions.


>commercial lager brewers do not always
>allow the beer to ferment to dryness.


I will agree with you there and although I didn't say anything earlier,
I do believe that Clinitest data from filtered lagers is of marginal
interest and really shouldn't be considered to be datapoints in
support of my side of this disagreement.  My contention is with bottle-
conditioned commercial beers and unfiltered homebrewed beers.

Subject: Sweet Gale (Bog Myrtle)


Today, I was reviewing some books on brewing before taking them
back to the library, to see what I might want to copy for my files,
and re-encountered this passage from Odd Nordland's _Brewing and Beer
Tradition on Norway_  I should note that the quotations come from
questionaires filled out by Norwegians about their knowledge and
recollection of old brewing practices.


    The important part played by the grut of Central Europe ... has
    already been discussed  From the fourteenth to the seventeenth
    century, the most important ingredient of this mixture of dried leaves
    and spices was bog myrtle, Myrica gale, which will here also be
    referred to as pors [presumably the Norwegian name].


    The bot myrtle was an important plant in medieval Norway, being
    mentioned as early as in fourteenth-century laws. ... rent for
    farms could be paid in bog myrtle ...


    ... bog myrtle occurs as one of the plants that could be used
    for flavouring ale: `To add a strong flavour to the ale, and to
    make it heady, pors was put into it.  ... It was gathered in
    autumn, and the leaves were also taken.' `When this plant was
    used, the ale was strong.  It went to one's head.  They spoke of
    having a "Christmas head".'


    ... In northern Hordaland, small quantities of pors were added to
    the Christmas ale until the turn of the century.


    ... `The ale was flavoured with hops mixed with pors.  It was
    slightly yellowish, and had a fresh, sweet taste.  It was said
    locally that when one drank much of it, it was strongly
    intoxicating, with unpleasant after-effects.'


    ...


    That bog myrtle produces a special effect when added to ale is
    ... well documented in our material, and in earlier sources ...
    Linnaeus ... mention[s] the especially intoxicating effects ...


    ... Does bog myrtle possess the properties that were once ascribed
    to it...? ... chemical analysis has revealed no such properties.
    [One writer] is inclined to believe that there must be some
    substance in the bog myrtle that has the effect described.  But he
    is also open to the suggestion that the belief in a special effect
    gave rise to an increased consumption [that] produced effects of
    the kind described. ... The solution of these problems would ...
    require a compleicated analysis, and as it is of little practical
    value to find the cause of the alleged headaches of bygone ages,
    the question will probably remain unsolved.

Subject: hydrometers


Richard Lehrl asked about hydrometers. There was some mention that a
fellow named Balling invented the unit in 1843, but I would hasten to
make a slight correction. The ancient Greeks invented this thing and
called it a "baryllion".


I'm sure some one will fill in the proper details here, as I am more of
a classicist than early modern, but it seems to me the hydrometer came
into use about 1780. Its use combined with the therometer lead to the
end of Porter brewed from 'blown' or 'brown' malts. The most popular
design in England was that of Twaddle, while Beaume's was used widely on
the continent.

Subject: Anyone use the "Automatic" Mill Yet?


Hi folks,


I see there is a new mill out for us homebrewers.  There is a
picture and description of it at the St Pats website at :
http://www.stpats.com/mills.htm


>From the site :
"Excellent new mill made by commercial mill manufacturer. 
 Adjustable steel rollers (both ends). Hand crank easily driven 
 by electric drill. All metal construction including hopper and 
 side plates. Base made of hard plastic. Best homebrew mill 
 ever made. Grains are crushed, not ground, for minimal flour. 
 Includes 5 gallon pail."


Does anyone have any experience with it, and can offer some
comments on how good it is?  Admittedly it's a bit pricey at
$169.50, but it sure looks like a great mill.  Anyone know
who this "commercial manufacturer" is?


cheers,
 -Alan

Can't give you birth/death dates, but my research for my article on calibrating
hydrometers (BrewingTechniques) showed his full name to be Carl Joseph Napoleon
Balling, and he produced his tables in 1843 (and they included errors ... that's

I just got back from Kansas City and I must say that it was a great time.  
The KC clubs did a great job.  The beer was flowing like...well like beer.  
There were many good seminars and you just couldn't help learning a lot 
given the expertise of those who attended. For those of you with a sense of 
humor check out the AlK picture in the gallery area at www.hbd.org/1stdraft 
 - yes that is a Clinitest assay being done.


Dave Clark inquired about an extract recipe for cherry beer.  I don't have 
one, but I can give you a few clues about New Glaris Belgian Red.  Start out 
with a recipe for a good flanders brown.  Ferment it and then stuff your 
secondary full of as many crushed cherries as will fit and pour the flanders 
brown over.  Finish fermentation.  Drink and smile.

I'm no expert, but a little searching revealed the following:


It appears that Balling's full name is Carl Joseph Napoleon Balling often
referred to as C J N Balling.  I found one reference to K J N Balling.  Not
surprising that Carl might have been spelled with a K.


It also appears that he was a Czech physicist.  And possibly published a

Subject: Worging without a net/Mixed up about mash mixers


In honor of Tim Anderson I am going to disable the AOL spell checker just 
this one time. 


I read with interest Joy Hansen's post concerning his mixing device. It seems 
to be more of a wort mixing/scraper kind of device than a mash mixer; very 
innovative nonetheless. One thing I wanted to respond to was the price he 
paid for his motor. I'm sure he had his reasons for purchasing that motor, 
but there are a couple of surplus mail-order places I know of that have gear 
motors for quite a bit less than the 80$ that Joy paid.


They are:


Surplus Center
Lincoln, NE
(800) 488-3407


C and H Sales Company
Pasadena, CA
(800) 325-9465
http://www.candhsales.com


I've purchased items from both places and have been pleased with the items 
and the service.


I was initially going to write this post to recommend a motor in the C and H 
catalog for anyone that was looking for one to build an inexpensive mash 
mixer with. It is a 55 RPM gearhead motor with 20 inch-pounds of torque for 
$7.95 (stock # ACGM7800). In order to boost the torque and reduce the speed 
you would need to gear it down a bit. In the same catalog there are miniature 
chain sprockets that will fit the shaft of this motor, along with the 
corresponding roller chain. This would add another $6.00 to the price and 
give you a speed of 33 RPM with torque of about 33 inch-pounds. Chain driven 
mash mixer...cool! And cheap.


Then it dawned on me. I have no idea how much torque is needed to mix the 
average mash. 33 inch-pounds might not be enough. So---I'd like to ask anyone 
that has set up a mixing system to share with the rest of us some details 
about your system like:


Torque in inch-pounds (or foot-pounds) or HP of motor and gear ratio
Approximate area of mixing device
Maximum size of mash
Ratio of water to grist
Any problems encountered


If anyone has experimented with different mixing blade shapes, that info 
would also be useful.


Thanks in advance,
