Subject: aerators and counter flow wort chiller storage


I'd like to thank everyone who has been answering my questions.  
Hopefully, one of these years, I'll be able to return the favor.


I have a counter flow wort chiller that I built from scratch, so no 
storage dirrections.  What can I do to keep the wort line sanitary, or at 
least clean enough that a short idaphor soak will sanitize it?  I started 
off by storing it in a 5 gallon water cooler with a few capfulls of 
bleach in the water.  BAD IDEA  Something in the solder (I think) has 
been oxidized.  There was a white power covering the solder joints maybe 
a chloride from the bleach?  There was also some junk in the water after 
1-2 days.  Hey, maybe water with a bunch of rubbing alcohol?  Any ideas?


Does anyone have any information on installing aerators into fermentation 
vessels?  I can shake 5 gallons but with 10 gal, that's going to be over 
100# of wort and stainless steel.  An aquarium type aerator might work, 
but sanitation issues worry me, not so much the air (planning on 
recirculating remaining air in fermenter before CO2 builds up - is that 
enough air?), but the pump and the aeration stone might harbor bacteria.  
Has anyone  heard of a stainless steel stone?  My supplier told me that 
they were rumored to exist.  Electrical safety and proper grounding 
shouldn't be a problem, but how might a running motor affect yeast?




The batch I have fermenting now seems to ferment in short bursts.  
Imediately after shaking, CO2 bubbles out of the blow off tube almost 
explosively (cold floor, so air expansion from heating is not expected.) 
then settles down to a steady stream.  At first the stream lasted several 
hous.  tonight, after shaking, the same heavy off-gassing was observed 
and could be repeated in > one minute, but the stream quickly slowed 
down, and then further shaking yielded diminished results.  Any ideas?

To be picky, plate heat exchangers are generally a type of counter flow 
chiller.  To answer the question (why do homebrewers use coils instead of 
plates), my guess would be that coil type heat exchangers are easier to 
fabricate, less expensive, and easier to clean than a plate type heat

From: joytbrew`at`halifax.com (Joy Hansen)
Subject: Rodney RIMS Controller Revisited?


Jonathan,


The following is the opinion of the author, Joy"T"Brew.


The "Zymurgy", volume 15, number 4, special 1992 talks about Gadgets and
Equipment.  "Recirculating Infusion Mash System Revisited" contains the
schematic and parts list for the controller.  Check your local Brew Shop to
see if they have a copy and/or contact Zymurgy and purchase the publication.
I've attempted to scan the schematic into digital form; however, it doesn't
do well with my scanner.  Better to abide by the copyright responsibilities
and not mail copies of the publication or it's articles.


RIMS can be described as "built as Rodney designed" and "modified from the
Rodney design".  Many brewers claim that they didn't hear of Rodney or his
development; however, I must bow to his extensive investigation,
experimentation, and to the eventual construction of a workable RIMS.   All
of which provided the direction for contemporary development.   I couldn't
tolerate the use of a picnic cooler that warped so badly that it's longevity
was doubtful.  And those nasty "prone to leak" bulk head fittings!  So, I
invited a complete storm of problems by using a modified Sanke keg to
replace the picnic cooler.  After nearly 10 years of experimentation and
many successful and just as many disastrous brew days, I've found the
modified system that works.  I can set the system aside for several months
without brewing and I have confidence that it will perform in an identical
manner for an identical brew.  I've attached a schematic of the mash tun I
use.  It works!  I make 8 gallon fermentable wort batches with gravity of 60
to 110 and using up to 30 pounds of malt.


Yes, I've had trouble with the Rodney controller, but it's most likely a
result of errors in my use of the equipment that cause the problems.
Typically,
a short develops in the temperature probe that zaps the ICs in the
controller.  After asking for help of HBDers without much success, I did get
sources for parts and the advice "Rebuild the circuit".


I wire wrapped the circuits rather than making a PC board.  I purchased a
punched copper clad board (each hole isolated) of about 2.5 X 3.0 inches.
The triac is bonded to a massive heat sinc approximately 5 X 5 X 2 inches
(salvaged from discarded equipment).  This is critical as overheating of the
triac does all sorts of bad things to my controllers.  Especially when the
ambient temperature in the brewing area is near 100 degrees.  When planning
the conductor for the neutral, hot, and ground, use at least #14 stranded
wire to carry the 10 amperes.  It's worked for me.  Use the IC sockets for
ease of replacement for trouble shooting the controller.  Buy several
components at a time.  Most of the wire wrap used #22 solid wire of various
colors from used electronic equipment.


>From my investigation, I've found that the least cost controller is that
described by Rodney.  The controller is very reliable for the brewing
environment.  Since I use two heating elements (heat exchangers), I
construct dual controller modules in the same control box.  There might be a
way to redesign the schematic so a single circuit could control two triacs.
I don't have the knowledge to attempt this change.  So, I just constructed
one controller for each heater.  To be sure I'd always have a functional
unit, I constructed a single unit and a second dual unit.  All work
properly - most of the time :).


For brewers thinking that the simple on/off switch does the same thing, good
luck with the enzymatic process.


I use two 5000W water heater elements of the 19" folded low density type
specified by Rodney.  I think this is critical.  Also, don't bother with the
motor control other than to install an on/off switch.  The flow through the
system is better controlled by using an adequate size valve in the supply
line to the mash tun.  Keeping the flow through the heat exchanger as high
as possible during temperature ramps is critical to conserving the enzymes
necessary for conversion.   Any scorching on the element makes a nasty brew.
Use of HERMS and Steam Injection might be appropriate substitutes; however,
IMHO they complicate use of the system.


Keep in mind that the flow through the false bottom is the critical element
of entire system.  Without flow, there's only scorching!  The Rodney picnic
cooler has an open area of about 230 square inches.  The best a keg can
provide is about 75 square inches of open area - thus the necessity of
stirring.


Good luck,


                                              Joy"T"Brew

Subject: storing grain




Through some judicious purchases - I've ended up with more soda kegs than
I can fit in my fridge.  Looking for a good use for a couple of these kegs,
I thought I'd solve the problem of where to keep grain so the mice can't
find it.


I plan to fill up the kegs with unused grain, and the purge the air by
forcing CO2 into the keg through the liquid out tube while pulling the
safety valve.


the questions I have are:




1) Will the CO2 environment slow any deterioration of the grains and extend
   the shelf life?  Might it introduce problems?


2) Is there any advantage or disadvantage of storing the grains under
   pressure (co2)?


3) what's the standard shelf life of most malted grains?


4) Are there any side affects of doing this that I might have missed?


Thanks for any input

Subject: Filtering the Wort ?




HBD-


    Recently I made a California Common which turned out quite tasty.
This was my second batch of homebrew and my first time to steep grains.
One of the things that bothered me  was when grain bag was lowered into
kettle, all of this grain flour emerged.  Is it a good idea to lightly
rinse the grains and grain bag in water before putting into kettle ?
Next item of concern was after chilling with immersion chiller, there
was a lot of coagulated grain matter suspended in kettle which didn't
settle to bottom like I hoped it would.  I know that this is caused by
the cold break but is there a way to adequately filter this when
transferring from kettle to primary fermenter ?  Regular strainer in
funnel didn't seem to help and I wanted to minimize the amount of trub
right off the bat.

Subject: 3/8" vs 1/2" valves, michael jackson


My question concerns 3/8" valves vs 1/2" valves on kettles.  I have never
found, with one exception, a brewing occasion when I could open a 3/8"
valve all the way.  Why would I want a 1/2" valve?  The one exception is
when using an immersion chiller, you can transfer the cooled wort to
fermenter faster with the 1/2" valve. Obviously, lautering is a slow
process for which even 1/4" valve on 2 of the 3 kettles in 3-tier system
would be more than sufficient.


Before anyone snaps back, "Well, 1/2" is bigger, and of course 'bigger is
better'" let me say that I offer 1/2" valves as well as 3/8".  There's
nothing wrong with 1/2"---it will do the job of 3/8, but 1/2" costs more.


In Austin, there is no way you can open a 3/8" valve for any counterflow
using tap water as coolant.  then again, our tap water runs as high as 75F
and is over 60F all year.  I'm curious about the water temp and associated
cooling rates for you michiganders and other yankees.


I plugged my Michael Jackson opening party a couple of times here; thanks
to the digest janitors for a reasoned policy regarding posts, such as this
one, which have some commercial content.  Photos of the Jackson weekend are
up now on our website.  The point I tried to emphasize at this year's
tasting was the increased quality of Texas brewed beers and the breweries
didn't disappoint. I think the people most surprised were the brewers
themselves who tasted A LOT!! of each other's brews on Friday evening at
the reception.  There are numerous excellent breweries in Texas now and the
quality is better at virtually every brewery than it was even 2 years ago.
At the risk of overlooking some, I'd mention Jaxon's in El Paso, Coppertank
in Dallas, Blue Star in San Antonio.  We are blessed with several excellent
breweries in Austin as well.

Subject: re cold vs cellar storage of ales


Hi all,


I have to say that I can't agree with Mark Bayer's post regarding cold
storage, regardless of what Mr. Fix or others have said. While I know I
am perhaps being 'unscientific', my own experience suggests that there
is no reason to cold store ales, even ales of lower gravities. I have
stored ales of very modest gravities (as low as mid to high thirties og)
in my cellar at temperatures which vary between about 50-70F/10-21C for
periods of up to 8-10 months with either no apparent deterioration in
flavour or improvement in flavour being the only results. Note that
these results are despite quite large temperature fluctuations, with, in
summer, temps well above traditional ale storage temps (i.e in the 50s
F). The exceptions would, of course, be that lager and, perhaps very
light wheat ales, will last better at cold temps. While there is some
research on this area, I wonder if anyone has done blind taste testing
comparing the flavours of ales stored cool and those stored cold to
consider possible negative taste consequences of long term excessive
chilling of ales? After all, serving an ale colder than about 12-13C has
a seriously awful impact on the flavour for most ales, so might it not
be that long term cold storage of ales might damage the beer in some
way? Do not british brewers store their ales at 13-15C whether they are
to be drunk quickly or stored longer? I'm sure much more experienced
brewers than I will disagree with me, but personally, I would follow the
practices of the pros in this (i.e. traditional british ale producers if
producing british ales) and the recommendations of those (i.e. CAMRA)
who know much more about this than any(? at least than I!) of us do.

My question is in incubating my plates and liquid cultures at 37 deg C (~98
deg C) (for proliferative and storage purposes only, not for pitching or
fermentation), am I at risk for inducing cell-line changes to produce
off-flavors.  I'm currently using only ale yeast (Wyeast European and

increasing the growth rate without inducing cell-line mutations, but just
to be sure, I'm asking.

Subject: Cherry beer


I'm sure that this recipe will make a fine beer --- but to make a more
authentic Kriek, you should get a very light color and use about 30-35%
wheat (preferably unmalted wheat).  With that in mind, I recommend using
6 lbs of dry wheat malt extract if you are using extract.  All grain, I
usually use 6 lbs pils malt and 3 lbs of wheat malt, and no crystal
malt.  Mashing high (around 155) gives the lambic yeast more complex
proteins to digest.


What I like best about this recipe is the large amount of cherries. 
Most fruit beers I've tasted don't have enough fruit flavor.


Cheers

Subject: Duvel/golden or triple


The terms actually overlap.    For example, Pierre Rajotte in Belgian
Ales (p. 138-139) describes Delirium Tremens as a "special" that could
have been named a "triple."


The original tripel was Westmalle, which is one of th six Trappist
breweries.  But Affligem and Corsendonk make tripels and they are
commercial breweries licensing an Abbey name.  So monastic origin has
nothing to do with the name.


The AHA beer styles are a mess, especially with Belgian ales.  I've been
tempted to enter the same ale in both Strong ale and the Tripel
category.  It would be amusing to compare scores.


Cheers

Subject: 5l Mini Keg Instructions


I have recently purchased a 5l Mini Keg system with one keg and a Party
Start CO2 tap.  I currently have beer in the keg and would like to tap
soon.  I have read many different postings across the web, but I have
not found good detailed instructions on how to use these (my product did
not come with instructions).


Specifically, I am wondering about the dispensing of the product.  I
have read about dispensing in these two different ways:
1.  Dispense 1-3 beers from the pressure built up from priming.  Then
attach the cartridge and only open the valve enough to dispense the beer
then close it again.  Then it goes on to say that your beer will go flat
if the cartridge is not left in.  It sounds like to me that if you turn
the valve off, leave the cartridge in, and the last beer drawn off used
up the pressure then your beer will go flat.


2.  Very similar to the above although keeping the valve slightly open
to retain carbonation between dispensing.  This one makes more sense,
though I know that it will use more CO2 than the other way.




I am very confused on how to use this and am thinking that I have made a
mistake by buying this product.  I would appreciate any input.


Thank you,


Troy Kase

The Lallemand Scholarship....
 Lallemand, of Montreal, Canada, has generously donated a full scholarship
to the Siebel Institute's Short Course In Brewing Technology, to be awarded
to a member of the American Homebrewers Association, at the next AHA
National Convention. This scholarship, currently worth US$ 2500, will be
accompanied by a US$ 1000 stipend to be applied to travel and accomodation
costs.
 This benefit for members of the AHA will also allow for a substitute award,
of a 2 week Microbiology Course for Brewers at the Siebel Institute, with a
similar travel/hotel stipend, for those members of the AHA that feel they
might be overwhelmed by a Short Course. This will accomodate the needs of
the winner, whether they be the newest of the newbies, or the more
accomplished brewer.


 Those are the main points.....the finer points are yet to be fully
enumerated, but this much is sure.....
1) This award is not based on merit...you don't have to win seventeen medals
in competition to win....It will be drawn from those members who wish to be
involved.
2) This award will be based on an entry, one per interested member into the
drawing. "Interested Member" at this point means a member of the AHA that
submits a card, later to be defined/produced, that states (paraphrased) "I
am interested in winning the Lallemand Scholarship. I will take the
Scholarship within the 12 months following the award, and will report my
experiences. My member number is *.*, and my expiration date is *.* "
3) Each new member is to receive access to this opportunity, and the member
that refers that new member will also receive an additional entry.
4) This offer is not open to members of the BoA, nor to any person employed
by the AOB, or Lallemand.
5) This offer is void where prohibited by law.
6) This offer is not transferable, nor redeemable for cash or any other
substitute, with the exception of the Short Course for a Microbiology
Course.


 That sums it up. Obviously, you may look for the complete details to be
released from the AHA on their website, and in Zymurgy, (this will miss the
next issue, though) when they are finalized. The prize is locked in...it
will be awarded. The fine print just has to be delivered to the lawyers, and
approved. You will be sure to read it in a JG Report on HBD as well. But, I
do hope that you see this as I do...a solid member benefit. Hopefully, just
one of many to follow!

I know I have
already been scooped by Steve Potter, but some mentions deserve
repetition...


1) Al K and Louis Korzonas doing the "Clinitest Bop."
http://homepages.isunet.net/brewer/clinitst.jpg
I believe that the copyright to this belongs to Steve Potter. I don't think
he will mind.


2) Laurel Maney's new Internet based brewing courses....from the folks at
the
Milwaukee Area Technical College....Her courses are listed in the Comsumer
and Hospitality Services Section. They cost 65 USD each.
http://online.milwaukee.tec.wi.us/schedulef99.htm
BTW, for those who don't know, apart from her BS in Chem, and Masters in
Pharmacology, she was the Valedictorian from the 93 Siebel Diploma Course!
WOW!


3) Jeff Swearingen, a member of the Fellowship of Oklahoma Ale Makers
(FOAM), Tulsa, Oklahoma won the Silver for BarleyWine with a recipe he based
on the Big 12 - Big 10/20 recipe! And what a great beer it was! This picture
shows the two of us holding each other up after drinking it!

NFBL in
Tallahassee. I learned more in my first 30/60 `at` that meeting than I had in
the preceding 6/12 on my own.

 BTW, I don't believe that anyone has publically thanked John for all the
work he did for the conference. He was the one doing all the onsite computer
work, relentlessly running back and forth from the copy shop to make sure
that the attendees each had copies of the speakers notes, and inputing the
winner's info to the AHA WebSite, late into the morning after the awards had
been announced. Thanks, mate! BTW, John leaves soon for Hawaii, where he
will take over as the GM of a BP out there. Good Luck!


Now, I could go on `at` length about all the folks I met, and the acquaintances
I renewed, but I will just praise a few that probably won't get mentioned
anywhere else.....


1) Joe Effertz of Pony Express Brewing Company. This bloke, besides being
the gracious host of the AHA Conference attendees `at` one hell of a party, was
also generous enough to invite other Kansas City and other area brewers
in....to allow them to strut their stuff too! Among the brewers attending
were 75th Street, River Market, High Noon Saloon and the Little Apple
Brewing Company! BTW, Jethro signed up LABCO's current Head Brewer, Lou
Kaylor, as a member of the AHA! HOWZAT!
 No, but Joe wasn't content just to provide great entertainement and food
for visiting brewers, and to provide an opportunity to showcase other
breweries....He did it all for 2 local charities..the Marillac Residential
Treatment Center, and Junior Achievement. Great effort, Mr. Effertz!
 And the Ames Brewers League owes you a dept for your generous donation of
breweriana for auction `at` the next meeting! ( Oh, you don't know about that?
uhhhh...ask Andy Wingfield, your Director of Promotions...uhhh) Thanks,
Andy!
 (BTW, I have had 2 e-mails asking if I got the names of the bands...They
were The "Big Woody" Blues Band, 785-267-5321, and Disco Dick and the Mirror
Balls, 913-351-0099.)


2) The HomeBrew Clubs that set the whole thing up, and provided the fine
beers that we consumed daily (and nightly!) This list is far from complete,
but includes the KC BierMeisters, the Missouri Association of Serious
Homebrewers, the Foamy Express Ryders, ZZ Hops, the Derby HB Club, and the
Urban Knaves of Grain. Thanks, ladies and gents!

Automatic Mills
 Automatic Equipment Manufacturing is a family owned concern in Pender,
Nebraska, whose prime business is in agriculture. They also manufacture a
malt mill, for brewpub usage...this is the mill I first learned to love `at`
LABCO, and the mill I will specify in the future. Fine product.
 As for the HomeBrew Mill by Automatic, I mentioned it in a review of the
Phoenix Craft Brewers Show in Phoenix in a past JGR, and have been presented
with one as a gift, following a critical analysis offered to them `at` that
show. Currently it is on loan to a brewer that attends the Ames Brewers
League, incidentally an HB shop owner. He seems to like it so far, but as of
the last time I spoke to him, he had not given it a full workout. It will go
on loan to another member of the ABL `at` the next meeting.
 For more info on the company, and their products go to...
http://www.automaticag.com/index.html
 There will be no info on the HB Mill...but you can see their malt mill, and
the history of the company etc. Fine folks, as well, and one section of
their web page is devoted to "See Us At," wherein you can see where they
will be showing their products.
 IMO, the best mill on the market for the HB'r.


Schreier
 Jethro is pleased to hear from the Dean Fikar Report that Schreier has at
last done the individual lot number spec availability on the web! Long ago
predicted by the JGR, as the future of maltster's web presences, this
proves..(put on your best Royal Navy uniform, and dance a jig!)..."That they
are the very model, of a Modern Major Maltster!"
 Congrats to Kelly Kuehl of Schreier!

 There has been `at` least one HE on the market for the HB market...the prob is
cleaning them. In a brewpub or micro, the HE is cleaned, and sanitized with
a CIP (Clean in Place) system, that includes a powerful pump, pushing
caustic or PBW through it. Even then, IMHO, the HE is responsible for more
infections in BP and micro beer than any other source.
 This is why I prefer to open the thing up, very frequently, and clean by
hand, in addition to CIP. In fact, `at` LABCO, I opened mine before almost
every brew. (OK, I was anal retentive...but I never had an infection!) Also,
repetitive openings mean increased maintenance, in replacing the gaskets.
 As for making one at home? Forget it...an HE relies on fine tolerances
between the corrugated stainless to provide optimal heat transfer...I have
no doubt that it could be done...`at` a prohibitively expensive cost, however.
Also remember that this thing is bolted together and torqued to a high
degree to prevent leaks.
 My bottom line on HE's for the homebrewer....1) too much $ compared to
immersion or counter flow...2) I suppose that the small size would lend
itself to easy opening and hand cleaning...but....3) refer to Number 1.


Non-Standard Disclaimer--Automatic and Schreier were among the many
suppliers/products that were part of my competitive brewing history, and two
of the many companies that aided in the production of the "We Got By With A
Little Help From Our Friends" LABCO ad in BT, New Brewer, and All About
Beer, in late 96, early 97. My name has also been used, with permission,
without compensation, in print ads for Automatic. I would still back these
products if this hadn't been the case. I will always vouch for quality, when
I discover it.
