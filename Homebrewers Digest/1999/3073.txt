Subject: Reynolds Tapper Keg Help


I have just searched the past several years of HBD for how-to-use pointers
about this old aluminum keg style I bought for novelty sake. I now own two
of them, so I would like to actually use them. Archives show very few
questions, no technical answers, and still leave me wanting.


Basically: I found that the original mechanisms are outdated and not likely
to be made to work. So the suggestions were to convert by adding a fitting
so they can be attached to a CO2 tank. This replaces the old self contained
gas cartridge inside the keg. I don't have a problem doing this and will
eventually get there I suppose.


But my questions are about opening the bottom cap area with the massive snap
ring, and also about the spring loaded tapper handle mechanism on the top
end. I would like to know how to get it all apart so it can go together
again and be sealable and pressure tight.


As the search indicated no replies to the hbd, I hope anyone in the the know
will share with us all. If not choosing to do that I will summarize any
replies and post the results. Outside of that, it's a 3 day weekend and if
there is anything I figure out while playing with them I'll post as well.


Thanks in advance - Brett

Subject: In search of nuttiness


In a valiant effort to evince the nuances of what constitutes a "nutty"
flavor in beer, I beseech those who have gone before me to elucidate on the
aforementioned conundrum that I face. I've tried Caramunich II, Honey
(malt), Special Roast, Toasted, and Victory malt as well as all the
permutations of the above to no avail. Good Brown Ales were made, but sadly
lacking in the "nutty" character I'm seeking. I tasted a wonderful Nut Brown
Ale (of the Northern English variety) during the Spring Beer Festival
(http://www.springbeerfest.com/) made by a gentleman named Greg (don't
recall his last name) from Montana (or was it Wyoming?) and it was the
grail. Well, maybe a grail shaped beacon ;^) At any rate, he was tight
lipped about grain/hop bill and yeast, but said I was "...on the right
track...", whatever that means. Any ideas, suggestions, opinions? Below is
my most recent recipe (206th attempt) so far, and there's still another  514
permutations left!

Subject: Mini kegs


Troy Kase asks about mini kegs,


Some folks like them some don't. I've had mine for about three years
without any problems.
Rules of thumb: 1) Prime your beer with 1/3 cup of priming sugar (no
more or you run the risk of bulging/ruining your mini), 2) Fill up to an
inch from the top, 3) Avoid storing your filled minis in a hot spot
(kitchen pantry is good enough for me) 4) Make sure you have enough head
room in your fridge for the mini with the tap 5) Start serving the first
glasses with the natural carbonation pressure and then only add enough
pressure to pour comfortably. 6) When keeping the mini in the fridge for
a few days, add a shot of CO2 and close 7) The larger CO2 cartridges (16
oz ?) work better than the smaller ones. I use about one per mini.


I have been lucky and never had a leak in my system. Good luck with
yours.

Subject: Crock Pot


Lee Bogardus asks about grain flour and adding grains in the grainbag to
the boil pot and such.  Although I moved on to all-grain brewing rather
quickly (2 extract batches), I've always had some concerns of practices
such as "steeping" a pound of crystal malt in 2 gallons of water.  I don't
want to get into the chemistry, but it doesn't sound like a good practice
(tannin extraction?).  I've also been tinkering with ways to make some very
small pilot batches with different yeasts.


Last night I used my crock pot!  Two pounds of pale ale malt and 2.5 quarts
of water (all american units).  I heated the mash water and added the malt.
 Pulled a small "decoction" which I heated in the microwave.  Added that
"decoction" back and voila' 154 deg F.  Mashed for about 75 minutes and
transferred to a teenie weenie lauter tun and sparged with 1 gallon of 160
deg F water.  Boiled just fine.  I dont' have a small chiller so I
transferred the wort to a small 1 gallon fermenter (nearly full of wort)
and left it overnight.  I poured off all of the break and hops this morning
and pitched the yeast.  


This was easy to do.  I would recommend it as an option for extract brewers
that want to "steep" grains or do small partial mashes....or for some idiot
like me that just needed to make a one gallon batch of beer.  YMMV

Subject: RE: aerators and counter flow wort chiller storage


I've got a trick that aerates wort effortlessly and costs
next to nothing. Take an 8-10 inch piece of rigid tubing
that fits into the end of your discharge hose. Starting a
couple of inches from one end, drill, poke, or burn lots and
lots of holes around this tube. After you begin your siphon
- -- or before you turn on your pump -- attatch this tube to
the end of your discharge hose and drop the rigid tube into
the opening of your fermenter. As the wort flows through the
tube the venturi effect draws air into the wort and aerates
like hell.


I made one of these tubes for some friends and they went
from an 18 hour lag to a 2 hour lag.


Easy, Cheep, effortless.

Subject: Hazy Kolsch


Greetings,


I made a Kolsch several weeks ago that is showing no signs of
clarification during cold storage.  I used Weissheimer Pils malt for 80%
of the grist.  Despite the fact that it is a continental malt, the typical
analysis showed no evidence of undermodification (Kolbach =43.6%, FG-CG
difference = 1.5%, friability=85%.  So, I proceeded to infusion mash at
147F for 90 min.  The other malts were 10% Munich and 10% wheat, but I
have used these malts in similar amounts in other beers and have not had
any haze problems.  I don't think the haze is suspended yeast as it
doesn't taste yeasty and I would think most of the yeast would have
dropped after 3 weeks of cold storage.  But, just in case it's the yeast,
I used White Labs German Ale/Kolsch yeast.  Any ideas?  Does the
Weissheimer Pils need a protein rest?  Is the Kolsch yeast a really poor
flocculator?


Thanks.

Subject: wort chiller and shaking carboys


     Joe Gibbens asks about sanitizing a wort chiller.  I usually have a 32 
     gallon plastic trash pail filled with detergent-bleach mix the night 
     before brewing out on the driveway.  I soak my chiller about an hour 
     before use, then rinse withe cold water, then hot water rinse, then it is 
     ready for use.  I clean up the same way (in reverse) rinse with cold, 
     then hot water, then soak, then remove, rinse off the deter-bleach mix, 
     then put it away.  It probably gets really dirty sometimes between uses, 
     but I wouldn't trust any kind of sanitizer/storage procedure that would 
     make me not want to follow the pre-use sanitizing I do now.  so I guess 
     how you store it is not as important as how you sanitize it before use!
     
     also STOP shaking your fermenter!  Not necessary!  and yes there ARE 
     stainless steel air stones, that is what I use, I take mine and connect 
     it to the hose I use and boil the assembly for 1-2 minutes before use, 
     and then I use PURE O2!  I got an oxynater and use propane torch size 
     containers of O2.  I have found very good results using it and you can 
     get much more air into the wort when using O2 instead of air.  But 
     remember, only aerate before or just after pitching yeast, once 
     fermentation has started, air is a no-no!
     
     Have fun with it!

Subject:  Steaming


>Use of HERMS and Steam Injection might be appropriate >substitutes; however, 
IMHO they complicate use of the >system.


With all due respect, the steam injection is extremely simple, cost 
effective, and a much faster way to achieve temperature boosts with ramp 
rates in the order of 4F to 5F per minute (depending oupon the thermal mass 
of the mash and the heat input to the pressure cooker).


The steam injection is pretty simple.  I use a 6 qt. pcooker where I have 
drilled and tapped a 1/8" hole, and attached to this a ball valve and QD 
fitting. I then attach a 1/4" ID SS natural gas appliance supply line from 
the pcooker to the RIMS (or rimmer as Adam Bedford would say) heat chamber.  
It is a simple procedure to turn on the stove, let the pcooker pressurize to 
about 15 psi, then open the valve.  I can heat from 140F to 158F in less than 
5 minutes, or go from 104F for the Phreddy Fouch beta glucan rest to a 140F 
beta amylase rest in less than 10 minutes.  The pcooker has a rubber rupture 
disk that protects against over pressuring, if safety is a concern to some.


As far as the RIMS controller is concerned, I have been using a dimmer switch 
for the past three years that provides for me with a set and forget 
operation.  I would also recommend using a motor controller instead of 
throttling flow with a ball valve for the reasons discussed previously (see 
archives).

Subject:  Ale Storage and 5l Mini Kegs


Robin Griller ( rgriller`at`chass.utoronto.ca ) comments on storage of ales.
 


I will occasionally "lose" beers in my beer fridg for long peroids of 
time.
 I have found that ales will "lager" in time and lose a lot of  their
fruitiness.  For ales, this, I consider, is a degradation of flavor.  




Troy Kase (kasetroy`at`isu.edu)  Asks about 5 liter mini kegs.  I really 
like
the size of this package.  It is perfect for those who want to keg, but
don't want to devote a whole fridge to 5 gallon korny kegs.  There are 
some
problems with them though.  The biggest is the fact that they have a
tendency to over pressure and bulge if given enough opportunities.  The
causes are usually over priming, premature kegging or wild yeast.  We 
make
a bung with a pressure relief valve built into it that is set at about 
half
the pressure required to cause the bulging.  We have sold about 1000 of
these and have yet to hear of the first problem with them. 




The other problem is the taps.  They are expensive, unreliable and very
fragile.  Those attending the AHA conference got a preview of much better


systems.


General mini keg instructions are as follows:


Prime each keg with a tablespoon of sugar.  ( I don't use a priming 
bucket
for mini kegs.  I just fill from the fermenter )


When using the German taps be carefull to hold the dip tube near the keg
when breaching the bung or the dip tube can buckel.


Put a little keg lube on the CO2 cartridge's tip before installing to 
give
a better seal. 




Use the regulator as an on/off valve when the flow slows. ( If you leave

Fully draining the kegs after use can be a problem.  I insert a strip of
paper towel into the hole and press it against the head.  The keg is then


inverted and lain on a sheet of paper towel.  Most of the  water will 
wick
out of the keg.


With an improved tapping system, these kegs have a bright future for
microbreweries and brewpubs.

Are there any problems with using raw ( undried ) sweet corn as an 
adjunct?
 It is getting toward that sacred time of the year and I thought some
Silver Queen Pale Ale sounds good.  Maybe just husk, cut the corns off, 
and
somehow liquify (blender?) the good stuff.  Or is this just a waste of 
good
sweet corn?

I've not seen a simple one either; however, Ken Schwartz has a GREAT page
on electronic temp. measurement at:


http://hbd.org/users/mtippin/thermometer.html


The schematic at "Refrigerator Control" could be readily adapted for a
bang-bang type RIMS controller by twiddling with the resistors and/or pots
and using a solid state relay to control the heater in place of the std.
coil type relay.  I'd also stick in a manual by-pass switch and a lamp or
LED to indicate when the heater is on.  If you can build a system with a
decent recirculation flow, you could but the temp. sensor in the line
between the tun and heater.  I'd include at least a thermometer downstream
of the heater to help ensure the wort isn't overheated.
Oh, yeah, Ken mentions on his gadgets page that he's got one on paper.
Maybe give him a holler at kenbob`at`elp.rr.com


>Are there functional and or quality problems with RIMS?


The only chronic type problem I have had is low recirculation flow.  In my
system, the mash dT/dt between rests is proporational to the flow, hence,
low flow yield longer delays in acheiving the desired mash temp.  Worst
case was about 1/2 degF/min.


IMHO, the biggest hurdle in going the RIMS route, is the time and cost of
making one.  OTOH, if you're a tinkerer and like fooling around in the shop
and "gadteering", the time consideration is actually a plus.


>No-one seems to talk much about it here.


Maybe 'cause they've been discussed so much in the past?  Much
info/opinions are available via an archive search via hbd.org or 
hubris.engin.umich.edu:8080/cgi-bin/dothread


YMMV, but, my RIMS was cobbled together with no knowledge other than what
I've read in the HBD and on the web and a lot of advice and help from
others who preceeded me-  THANKS guys!!!

Subject: Table sugar


I decided to try a little experiment using table sugar in a brew. 
Although I'm sure there were some uncontrollable variables, several did
stay constant.
These were all 5 gallon batches.
5.5 lbs Muntons LME ( .5 gal)
Nottingham Ale yeast
2 oz Mt. Hood hops pellets- 1 oz for boil, 1 oz for finish.
(OK, so this varied a little, but the AA stayed pretty close)
Now the adjunct variable was 1.5 lbs.
Honey   or   Dextrose or  Honey & Dextrose  or Table Sugar


The table sugar stood out, and was not as clean tasting.  Although not
bad, I'd spend the extra money on more malt, honey, and/or dextrose. 
This was not done under special conditions admittedly, I just changed
adjuncts.  I was using up a 3 gal bucket of malt and figured  "why not?" 
 That's the advantage of buying in bulk.   Inquiring minds wanted to
know, and I was one of them.  No, I didn't take detailed notes, I was
just following my pattern of late with this particular bucket of LME.  
That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.  Now to order my 3 gallon bucket
of Wheat LME.   No apologies for the LME, hop pellets or dry yeast.  I'm
lucky to find any time to brew at all, and this works for me.  Hoppy 4th
to all.

While I don't use pumps personally, my understanding is that most mag
pumps want to be fed by a pipe of the same diameter as the pump inlet
- -- usually 1/2". Obviously there are ways around this (like using a
grant with a 1/2" outlet) but I would imagine having a 1/2" outlet on
the kettle would be more convenient. Again, I speak only from
experience gleaned shopping around for a pump which I never actually
bought...

Hi all,


I was interested to see that Lallemand, of Montreal, Canada, is providing
goodies to members of the American Homebrewer's Association. Very
generous of them indeed. Does Rob know whether Lallemand is intending to
do something similar for members of CABA, the Canadian equivalent, or do
they prefer the larger market of our more populous neighbour south of
the border? Interesting to see such an announcement appearing on hbd the
day after Canada Day!

Subject: Call for ideas/developers:  freeware Tcl/Tk brew calculator


Before anyone says it, yes, I do know that there are already programs
out there that do this.  :-)    I just haven't found one (for Unix)
that does everything I want.  My solution, one that I've been thinking
about for some time now, is to do the same thing I did for a hurricane
tracking program:  write the beast...and make it portable to anything
that supports Tcl/Tk (Unix, Windows 95/98/NT, Macs, and possibly others).


Right now, I'm using a program called Brewer's Little Helper (BLH).
It's served me well over the last couple of years since I switched to
all-grain, but there is more that I'd like to see.


Before I start spending any time on it (and since it's hurricane season,
I need to work on JStrack, too!), I'd like to find out how many people
would be interested in A) using it (remember, it's going to be free---I
have *NO* intention of charging anything for it now or in the future),
and/or B) helping in its development.  I'm thinking along the lines of
so many other useful programs around the net that benefit from a group
of multi-talented developers working together.


Btw, I tend to get behind on reading e-mail lists, including the HBD,
so please CC me directly on responses at jim`at`n5ial.gnt.net.


The program I have in mind would, at a very minimum, want to do all of
the following:


   * be written entirely in Tcl and Tk (script) for portability and
     ease of development (note:  assume Tcl/Tk 8.0.x)
   * serve as a recipe calculator (like BLH does)
   * include both BJCP and AHA style guidelines and integrate them
     into the recipe calculator (the version of BLH that I have only
     supports an old version of the AHA guidelines)
   * include a database of grains, hops, yeasts, etc., with their
     characteristics, as well as a way for the user to update this
     data easily
   * serve as a brew log, with the ability to print a hardcopy
     for the brewer's logbook (for an example of what I have in
     mind, see mine on the HomeBrewers Underground web page at
     http://www.gnt.net/~n5ial/hbu)
   * ideally, I'd like to have a color chart (SRM), and if possible,
     show the (highly) approximate color as an image as well as a
     number (i.e., more or less what color the beer will be)
   * serve as an inventory keeper/log for grain and hops
   * for hops, show not only the total IBUs (Rager or Tinseth), but
     also the IBUs per addition (BLH does this) *AND* the percentage
     of the total IBUs
   * allow hop additions to be entered either as weight per hop per
     addition or as a percentage of the total target bitterness
   * for grain, show the percentage of the grain bill for each grain
   * allow the grain bill to be entered either as weight per grain
     or as a percentage of the total grain bill (using the user's
     extraction efficiency to calculate the total amount of grain
     required to meet the desired starting gravity for the target
     post-boil volume)
   * when used as an online brewing log, calculate (based on the
     pre-boil specific gravity and volume) the final volume for
     the target gravity and the approximate specific gravity for
     the target volume
   * support OG/FG as specific gravity and degrees Plato
   * remember values entered by the user:  if, for example, the
     East Kent Goldings I get is normally 4.2%AA, but I ended up with
     some at 4.5%, when I enter 4.5%, have that be the new default for
     that recipe (and ask the user if they want to change the system
     default)
   * track yeast usage and re-usage.  These days, I normally start up
     fresh yeast from a slant for each batch (I often don't brew with
     the same yeast again before it's been in the fridge too long
     after harvesting), but that isn't always going to be the case.
     The program needs to be able to track multiple generations of
     each yeast....
   * allow the brewer to make notes on the recipe---things to change
     for the next brew, and when the user bases a new recipe on the
     old one, ask if they want to include those changes


These are some of the ideas I've got, but I'm sure there are other
useful features that I've neglected to include here (e.g., things I do
so often that I don't even think about them anymore, or things that I
haven't even thought of).


So, does anyone have any other things they'd like to see?  Does anyone
want to contribute to the development of this thing (code and/or general
assistance, e.g., with formulas I might be lacking, etc.)?  And, is
anyone else interested in something like this?  Also, for future
reference (if/when this thing ever really gets off the ground), is
anyone willing to help test it on Windows 95/98/NT or the Mac?  I can
test it on Unix, but that's it.  With pure Tcl/Tk, there *SHOULDN'T* be
a problem on the other systems...but it's still best (obviously) to test
it there.  It's also (again, obviously) best to have more than one
person try to make it break and find any problems....


Let me know what y'all think....  Again, please CC me directly at
jim`at`n5ial.gnt.net in case I get as far behind again on the HBD as I
am right now (I'm trying to get caught up now).
