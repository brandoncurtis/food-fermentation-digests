I wrote a pressure-chart-generator that can do any temp/pressure you want.

There are those who argue that using a long serving line will drop the
pressure at the tap.  You might try keeping the keg at near-freezing,
and after carbonating it to your target, if you use a really long serving
line (also kept in the fridge), there might be a sweet-spot in the serving
pressure where you get high-carb beer and less foam.


Is that possible?  Anyone tried it?


Anyway, heres the outlandishly large pressure chart:

I can vouch from experience: corks don't allow gas to escape. At least not
very much.


If you *have* to bottle in two weeks (and it sounds like you do), I would do
the following:


1. Take a gravity reading and determine how dry the mead is. A dry mead should
finish between SG 0.990 and 1.000. If your gravity is significantly higher,
you may wish to reconsider your options.


2. Do what winemakers do every time they bottle. Treat it with potassium
sorbate and sulfite. I would use 50 PPM sulfite per gallon (or 1 campden
tablet, crushed) and 1/2 teaspoon of potassium sorbate per gallon. Add these
~24 hours prior to bottling.

Subject: Mash Thickness


CLOAKSTONE addresses the effect that thickness of the mash has upon
production of fermentables.  Admittedly, it has been over a decade since
I was in Reaction Kinetics and Biochem, and I have never performed an
energy and mass balance for a slurry in my "real job" (only solutions),
but I have to question the validity of his reasoning.


Yes, this is nitpicking.... but for a good cause.


>The first is that beta amylase is more heat labile than alpha amylase;
a very

A temperature reading, by its very nature, is a measure of available
energy.  Admittedly, water has a higher heat capacity than grain, but
that refers more to an ability to store that energy.  (For those not
following me, check back for a discussion of how temperature refers
simply to brownian/random motion within a substance.)  Yes, there is
more stored energy in 10# of a thin mash vs. 10# of a thick mash, but
the energy being transmitted to your enzymes will be the same for either
example as long as the temperature is the same.


So why would a thinner mash produce a less fermentable beer?  Dunno--
that has never been the case with mine, but apparently there is some
evidence that it does, so I would suggest there is more at work here.
Perhaps the rate of diffusion of the beta-amylase from the grain into
the liquid part of the mash is to blame; the grain is slower to pick up
the heat from the surrounding mash (ever notice that it takes a little
while for the mash temp to stabilize after an infusion?), so the enzymes
remaining in the grist portion are more protected and thus have a longer
term effect in a thicker mash.

Subject: Safale Yeast


Jeff Bitgood remarks about the Safale yeast. I used it in a Classic American
Ale recently, and was very impressed with it. Following the directions I
made an 8 oz. slurry and pitched it into 5 gallons of SG=1.048 wort. I
didn't even bother to aerate the wort, but it began fermenting within 3
hours, had vigorous fermentation within 12 hours, and was essentially done
in 2-3 days. After 7 days in the primary `at` 66 degF, the FG= 1.008. I bottled
with 1500 mg/22 oz. corn sugar (3 Prime Tabs per 22 oz. bottle). The result
is a very pleasant, low carbonation ale, beautifully clear, medium golden
color. The Safale yeast is neutral, but seems to enhance all the malt, corn
and hop flavors. It is a very good yeast which I will use much in the
future.

OXIDATION:


Individual "data points" are, at best, just this. I include this one only
because there is a lot of discussion on the possibility of oxidative staling
during bottling but I'm (surprised!) to yet see anyone say "Well I tried this
too and my beer /did/ stale faster after aeration." The beer was a dry stout
and at the end of bottling I aerated the heck out of the last two 24 oz in the
bucket by swirling and repeated vigorous stirring with a slotted spoon, then
bottled. In a triangle test about 3 weeks later I could tell a clear
difference between this and the parent beer. Interestingly enough, I had Mike
Maceyka try a side-by-side comparison and he couldn't tell much difference.
All in all I am pretty well convinced that drastic aeration during bottling  
can lead to staling and that this doesn't take all that long in the bottle
either. I'm also amazed at the difference between the taste profiles I was
picking up and Mike was picking up, it seems that differences in individual
taste thresholds, etc. must also be considered as possible factors in
explaining why a beer heavilly exposed to air does not appear to be staling...

Yes it certainly does and it would be nice to have a good title to indicate
this. Is he a commercial brewer? If so, perhaps Masterbrewer or Headbrewer,
etc. would be appropriate. As I indicated in my previous post, titles such as
"Dr." really only indicate an increased probability that the given source will
be helpful. Certainly training AND experience count for a lot, and I'd ideally
like to be getting advice/info from someone who has BOTH (plus a pinch of
intelligence and wisdom on the side).

This may be, though the title was apparently being used by more than one
person. I have to stress that I wasn't slamming this particular individual
just defending Steve Alexander's point about the capricious use of titles and
that they /could/ potentially be misleading.

 As for your inversion of sucrose... you were not getting
what you think you were...  Years ago, when I posted about this common
method for creating invert sugar, a chemist wrote me privately and
said that at the pH's we would get from a little citric acid or lemon
juice, only a fraction of the sucrose would be split into it's component
glucose and fructose.  He explained why this was done at all: because
sucrose water is unstable -- the sucrose despirately wants to crystalise.


Someone found that if you invert even a few percent of the sucrose,
the crystalisation is almost completely stopped.  So, the purpose of
making "invert sugar" (of which only a few percent were actually glucose
and fructose) was so you could store syrup and still get it to pour.
The yeast couldn't care less what you give them... invertase is so
>powerful... it will invert copious amounts of sucrose in minutes.


I agree with your chemist friend as far as citric acid is concerned but 
not
commercial brewers (invert) sugar which is pretty well completely 
inverted
by hydrochloric acid and neutralized. Using cream of tartar  ( which
decomposes to an acid at syrup boiling or cupcake baking temperatures) in


candy making is based on the principle of inverting only a small portion 
to
prevent re-crystallization. My point was simply that I didn't need to 
start
with invert sugar as indicated in those old texts , that in the days when
 I
was using sucrose to prime, I put all the priming sugar in my "kraeusen
"starter to invert it with invertase from the yeast, before I primed with


it.  Interestingly, I had forgotten why I did it until you objected on 
the
grounds that this would cause an uncertainty of how much was being used 
to
prime. when I said to myself " self, why would you do that?" Then I
remembered. Keep the sugar concentrated with the high yeast concentration


so the sugar would be inverted and not slow down the conditioning when
diluted by the beer.

HUH??? Someone's going to have to explain this one to me. The denaturation of
the enzyme (all other things being equal) will depend ONLY on the temperature
not the "thermal mass" or absolute volume of the solution. If allowed to cool
then the smaller volume (thicker) mash should cool more quickly thus reducing
the time the enzyme is exposed to the higher temperature and therefore you'd
get less denaturing occuring - is this what you mean? 


Also, I said "all other things being equal" but in the described example there
are other differences besides temperature - the enzyme is more dilute in the
thinner mash and this may be contributing to decreased stability of the beta
amylase, perhaps by lessening the effect of substrate stabilization.

Brewsters:


At last we will be able to move into our house
in South Carolina as my wife will be purposefully
( the purpose is to get money) employed there
and we can move.  She accepted a really great
position today and we will be scurrying to get
this house sold and move by the end of August..
- ------------------------------------------
As a result, I need some advice from our
favorite fridge guy, Forrest Duddles.
For some reason, my e-mails to him are
kicked back so I include my letter to him here.
Of course, any other comments
from other HBDers would be most appreciated.


Forrest, 




I am gong to move to a great new house
and have a large section ( ~400 sq ft) of a
garage for my hobby rooms. I plan a cooler
room to keep my wine and beer, since
this is in South Carolina. I think I still have
some old working dehumidifiers ( although
I may have thrown them away?) around and
wonder if these would be useful as coolers
for my planned room.


At present, I plan to use the area under a
stairway and a possible extension of this.
Any thoughts?  The stairway is inside the
garage, but is on an outside wall,so it should
be easy to use a small air conditoner. Any
thoughts? I plan to have a cold room and
then the wines and such around the outside
on racks on the walls and under the stairs
of this main room.  The warmer room should
be in the mid-60s and the cooler room around
55F or colder.  This should allow beer
( lager 50 - 55F or lower, 60 - 65 ales)
fermentation, white wine fermentation
55 -60F and wine storage at 65F The outer
room will call for coolth by a fan removing
air from the cooler room to the warmer
room and the cooler room will have a
temperature controller which will call an
air conditioner.  Is 50degF a reasonable
temperature for the cooler room using an
air conditioner?  How can I get it to run this
cool? How about cycle times and the like?
The volume of the room will be about 200
plus cubic feet with a portion of the room at 10'.
Imagine a solid triangular room
10hX10wX4d ( 200 cuft) and perhaps with a
10hX6wX4d' extension.  240 cu ft max extension


Possible plans are to make the rectangular
section as the cooler room with R30 insulation
( vapor barrier?) and the other room with
normal R18?(Vapor Barrier?) Plans are
to put the air conditioner up high in the
rectangular section.


I have a similar stairs  arrangement here
and it works fine with a cooled basement to
keep the wines cool.  I make lager in the
winter in an anteroom here in NJ, but can't
count on it there, so I will need some
additional area to cool.  Any other thoughts?.


Thanks for your comments!


BTW it has been substantially cooler and
less humid in SC than in NJ these past weeks!

I wonder why no FAQ has ever appeared covering the basics.  Al Korzonas,

Why not gain some of that non-technological brewing experience you want and
then report back on your findings instead of dumping on people who choose a
different path ?  Why not stop theorizing about the advantages and
dismissing the critics when your first all-grain beer is still in the
fermentor and has problems ?   Why ask questions of others about your
krausen problem when your experience will, as you claim, answer the question
?


Poor krausen, no measurements - what does your experience tell you now ?
Perhaps that tools and technology are useful for diagnosis and learning ? Of
course not !


As for the 'Chefs don't need technology' argument - nonsense.  Food methods
provide a lot more sensory feedback that a mash tun, but I know of no
respectable chef who would trust his intuition for temperature when using a
new roasting oven and the careful measurement of water in dough.  Certain
things in cooking and brewing are less forgiving than others and measurement
tools are needed.


Similarly - mash differences of a few tenths in pH or 5F temp make a big
difference in the beer and yet are inaccessible to the senses w/o a
reference or a thermometer/pH meter.  You will find this out once you
actually have some of that experience you exalt.

There is some element of cost in the reasonings of quite a few

Again most of the brewers that I know are all grain brewers, but I 
know that there is a very large population of kit and extract brewers 
here. Some of the kit & extract manufacturers are now going to 
great lengths to provide us with top quality kits and premium malt 
extracts, which again all assist in the production of quality beer - the
cheap and nasty homebrew kit which produces thin tatsteless (apart 
from That Nasty Homeberw Tatse) is still a common occurance over 
here.
All the retailers that I know do their best to encourage people into the
use of quality ingredients, over cheap ones - another step towards 
quality over cost. Somewhere along the line the aim for quality is 
there, but there is still a portion of the market who are after cheap 
beer.

In HBD #3086 (7/19/99), John Stegenga suggests using Diazanon to control 
beetles on hops.  


If you are planning on using the hops in beer, and the plants currently have 
cones on them, I would caution against using any pesticide.  Think about the 
process: hop cones generally hang on the vine until ripe and are then picked, 
dried and packaged.  Later, they are unpackaged and thrown into wort.  Unlike 
most fruits and vegetables, hop cones are usually not washed at any time 
prior to use.  As a result, there is a chance that, if you spray pesticides 
on the cones now, you will be tossing pesticide residue into your wort later.


Of course, ingestion of pesticides could negatively affect your level of hop 
derived estrogen ....

Greetings All,
    Depending on the style of beer depends on how it gets treated prior to
priming and bottling. In the summer months, or if a beer is going to be in
the bottle for awhile I will add 150 to 300 mgs. of ascorbic acid to the
water being boiled for the priming sugar for a 5 gallon batch. If O2
intrusion is a problem it seems that the ascorbic acid will be oxidized
before the beer itself. This practice has served me well over the years.
    What I'm looking for is some advice/direction to clone the Rogue YSB. My
God what a beer! We are looking for that big malt explosion in the start.
Any ideas???

Subject: Glycol?


I've recently acquired a small glycol chiller. Now I'm wondering what
the heck do I put in it? Do I just go to a refrigeration supply and ask
for glycol, or is there a trade name for the stuff?

Subject: Roller mill questions


Hi all


Im building a roller mill from two stainless shaft sections (4-5" diam,
2-3" length), and Ive looked through some old HBD articles but couldn't
find answers to these questions:
What range of gap size should I have (if I make it adjustable), and if not
adjustable what is the best allround gap size?
Do both rollers need to be powered, or can I get away with just having one
powered and one free??
Do I need knurling on rollers of this diameter?


Many thanks


Petr

The canning of Brian Rezac is yet another thing one can add to the "Stupid
AHA Tricks" FAQ.  I  suggest all that care abou the AHA and it's policies
let the AHA and it's BofA kow what you think.  I believe Ken Scharamm, Dae
Houseman and Rob Moilne are three such induhviudals.  I personally see this
as yet another stupid thing.  Brian was helpful and never got upset with my
constant raggin on the AHA/AOB.  He provided prompt service and help.  I
ask the reps to let the AHA know what the "members" think.  I suggest that
a boycott of the AHA conference be carried out.  I know the conference is
now meant to be run by local groups etc. but it is still an AHA event.
Support the MCAB.  Let's put the screws to the AHA and make the NHC a
non-event in the year 2000.  Make a statement. Oh and I want to see the
latest info on the AOB taxes and charlies salry on the AOB web site ASAP.

Subject: basements ?


Someone suggested that basements were for storm cellar use,... seems
unlikely since they are prevalent in the NE and well beyond the tornado
plagued plains.


Someone else that stoney soil was the reason for their lack.  I have seen
basement excavation in the Pittsburgh area apparently quarried or blasted
out of solid granite !!


In the north the necessity for central heat, is a big part of the issue.
Coal chutes exist in homes built as recently as the 1920s.  The circulating
air ducted systems typically require a cool reservoir and return at the low
points.  I suspect passive hot water systems have a similar requirement. Oil
fired furnaces w/ storage on lower basement levels are common in rural
areas.  The basement furnace solves these problems.  Slab  (and half
basement) construction is allowed and common for small commercial
structures. so frostline concerns are probably not the root cause.


I've seen some homes from the mid 1800s here and they do have
basements/cellars FWIW.

Subject: Newbies For Breakfast???


Thomas Murray recently posted an article titled as above. He stated:
""Phil and Jill Yates brought up the subjects of HBD posting fear...


 ...They said: " the HBD is regarded by many potential contributors
as something of a lions den, that is to say that you can expect to be
shredded if you dare to get involved"


He also stated:
"Please someone, show us the last time a "newbie" was torn limb from limb on
this digest. I have always been impressed by the patience and respect that
new brewers are given here."


Thomas, can I call you Tom? Let's get a little bit friendly here. Firstly, I
do not appreciate the suggestion that Jill is helping me out with my posts.
In fact in line with general HBD policy I am extremely infuriated by your
comment and may just well report it to the police!
Secondly, I don't know about the last time but if you continue to insult me
I will definitely demonstrate how (for the first time) to tear a newbie from
limb to limb.


Happy Brewing

Subject: Jap. Beetle/Tip from Commercial Brewing


Ian Smith wants to know if I can tell him what a Japanese Beetle looks
like.
Yes, yes I can. In detail. I see them in my nightmares. Anyway, there is


a lovely photo at
http://www.ent.iastate.edu/imagegal/coleoptera/
Go to scarab beetles. I'd put the address of the particular image but
its over 80 characters and gets rejected.  Not an unattractive bug,
really,  considering the damage they do.I'd say they are a little less
than a cm long (no scale on the photo).


Tip of the day from commericial brewing -  Fobbing:
Today's tip was stimulated by Dean Fikar's post yesterday concerning
capping on foam. The unbelievably expensive bottle fillers used by
commercial brewers use this technique (and others) to minimize headspace


air. They do it by injecting a squirt of beer or water into the neck
just before the cap goes on. Some machines simply rap the bottle.
Obviously, you can do either of these things when counter-pressure
filling. Rapping is easier requiring only a hard object to rap with. A
squirt of beer can be obtained from a syringe but you'd have to worry
about keeping it and the supply of beer  or water you draw up with it
sanitary. Squirting and rapping both obviously require that the beer be
well carbonated.

Subject: Leaving AHA


I've spent most of my homebrewing career as a member of the AHA. I kept 
renewing my membership because I felt that the organization was slowly 
changing for the better. Brian was the major driving force behind these 
positive changes. I am angry as hell that he has been summarily dismissed. 
Along with him, I will go. My membership come up for renewal in a couple 
months. I will throw my renewal card in the trash. I cannot continue to 
support an organization that does not work in the best interests of its 
members.

Not to me they don't, because I cancelled my subscription

But if you are still paying dues to that organization, you're
GD right they owe you an explanation, and if I were you I'd
demand one!

Subject: hop utilization by style


larry land  asked about hop utilization by style, 
        I was wondering the same thing until I got the Daniels book on
designing great beers.  While it does not cover all varieties of hops, it
does give some historical reference about what hops may have been used in
the style and also shows and analysis of malts and hops used in a sample of
winning recipes.  You can use this as a guideline and make your own calls
from there.  Another good source is the Garetz book on hops, it covers the
most commonly found hops and can give you a feel for their uses,
similarities and disimilarities.  I use both these books to determine what
hops I would like to use and what substitutes I can use if need be (like the
brew store doesn't have EKG, but they have Fuggles so that may be close
enough).
