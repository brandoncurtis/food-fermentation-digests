Pete Czerpak  <Pete.Czerpak`at`siigroup.com> asked about recipes for Barley
Wines and Imperial Stouts at the end of HBD 3104.


The following is an imperial stout recipe Russ Levitt of Upland Brewing
gave me for five gallons of homebrew:


12 lbs Pale Malt
1 lb Roast Barley
1 lb. Crystal
1/4 lb. Chocolate malt
1/4 lb. Black Patent
4-6 oz of bittering hops of your choice (I used 4 oz of Chinook)
2 oz of finishing hops of your choice (I used East Kent Goldings)


OG 84-90
FG 28-32


Russ used London yeast on his, I used the W-Yeast Scotch Ale strain
(which I liked) and on a subsequent batch the Bell's yeast (which was
too attenuative.)


I actually like this one better if one cuts the chocolate and patent
down to 2 oz and use one pound of flaked barley instead.  Personally I
don't care for chocolate and patent tastes that are strong in stout.

Subject: Desperately Seeking Nessie


I've become rather fond of an Austrian beer called MacQueen's (yes, I said 
Austrian) Nessie Original Red Ale, brewed by the Eggenberg Brewery. It seems 
to be more of an altbier than anything remotely like a Scottish ale. It is 
fairly strong (alc. 7.3% vol.), fairly light colored and well balanced in 
malt and hops. On the label it says: "Gerbraut Aus Whiskymalz". I gather that 
that means it is brewed with some whiskey malt in the grain bill. I notice a 
somewhat whiskey-like quality in the overall taste, but I can't put my finger 
on what it is that says "whiskey". There is no outstanding peaty smokiness in 
the flavor profile, but it may be lurking in the background somewhere. Oh 
well, guess I'll have to do some more beer tasting research.
Anyway, I would like to develop a recipe that will approximate this delicious 
beer, once I finish building my new brewing setup (it's been almost a year 
since I've brewed).  Here are my questions:


Is the peat smoked malt that is available through home brewing channels the 
same malt that is used by whiskey producers?
If not, then I would like to know if whiskey malt is available to 
homebrewers. Any mail order suppliers around? Also, does anyone know of a 
supplier of the Hugh Baird lightly smoked peat malt mentioned by Ted McIrvine 
in HBD #3103?

Hello Collective,


    Well as it appears that there are those that want to know, so here it
is...Here in the sunny Sierra Foothills ( approximately 12 miles east of
Placerville, Ca.and slightly farther than that from C. Burns) where the
current temperature (as of 2:00pm) is 76 degrees F.which is well below
normal for this time of year, I have just finished putting up my dried
Northern Brewer hops which are about a month early. This is the third year
for this particular planting and they put up 7 bines which were
approximately #2 pencil sized as they emerged from the ground in early
April. By late May they had reached the 12 foot level and proceeded to grow
downward till they were almost to the ground( I say almost as they decided
to use the garden fence as a growing lattice). I harvested a full 6.5 gallon
bucket ( amazing how handy those old plastic fermenters can be). I didn't
weigh them in their just picked staged, but the dried weight is 1.8 pounds -
These were well formed hop cones and have a very clean and decidedly
Northern Brewer aroma. There is no easy way for a homebrewer/hop grower to
determine the actual AA's for a given hop, however after brewing a batch or
two of my stock pale ale I should be able to quantify the amount needed to
achieve the results I want (This means keeping good records from previous
brews for this brew) -- I''m sorry Steve - no exact science here (:->), just
my own sense of taste.

Subject: First All Grain Batch - Low Mash Efficiency


Well, my first all grain batch is in the carboy and is fermenting like
mad.  I may even have to use a blow off tube for the first time.  But
for some reason my mash efficiency was only about 60%.


The total grain bill consisted of the following:


#8 British Pale Ale Malt
8 oz. Crystal Malt (60L)
6 oz. Scottish Crystal Malt (90L)
4 0z. Belgian Special - B Malt


Strike water:
10.5 qt. `at` 132 F
Mash held at 120 F for 30 minutes (Adjusted mash pH to about 5.5 - 5.2
with lactic acid solution)
Raised temperature to 154 F and held for 45 minutes.


Sparged with 168 F water to 7 gallons (Adjusted sparge water pH to about
5.5 - 5.3 with lactic acid)


Sparge time:  Slightly over 2 hours.  (Didn't want to do it too fast and
ended up doing it too slow!)


Anyone have any ideas why my mash efficiency was so low?

Subject: SPAM from Great Lakes Brewing


Greetings, Beerlings! Douse me in your lager....


How many received an e-mail from Great Lakes Brewing Company regarding
their "Cleveland Brown Ale"? And how many of those that received it are
listed in Zymurgy as the contact of a brew club?


I tried to take this issue up with GLBC via private e-mail - using the
reply-to address on the note they sent - but not only did Great Lakes
Brewing resort to harvesting club names from Zymurgy in order to advertise
their products, they apparently used the same cowardly tactic of hiding
behind a false address. I received an error message back from the domain
in the address for my trouble. Either that, or they're already getting
e-mail bombed.


Am I over-reacting in being FURIOUS that they would use my e-mail address
listed in Zymurgy as a club contact for sheer advertising? There was no
"intrinsic value" to the material in the mailing, unless you were
personally holding your breath for their seasonal. Since it was
unsolicited and was not information specific to home brewing or the clubs
or even some "special offer" - isn't this just plain old SPAM? This
message must be made plain to them: club e-mail addresses are not
published in Zymurgy for use in "targeted advertising". Besides: SPAM and
SPAM tactics - no matter the source or the product - are inexcusable.


I'll personally not patronize Great Lakes Brewing any further nor buy any
of their products due to this incident. That's what their advertising
has earned for them from me.

Subject: No-float empties


Christopher Farley asked how to keep empty jar from floating inside the
pressure cooker when canning sterile empties.


A pressure cooker requires only a little water in the bottom to do its job.
 I use only about 1/2" and after a 40-minute p-cook ther's still about 1/4"
remaining.  There's no need to fill it.  I highly recommend a small rack in
the bottom just to hold your inner vessel or jars from direct contact with
it.  My p-cooker included two aluminum risers about a 1/2" high for this
but a trivet or small rack would accomplish the same.


When I prepare petri dishes I keep them well aloft of the water, on top of 
the second riser on top of some jars.  The steam environment is sufficient
for all the pressure cooker's work.


- -------------------------------


Note that if you p-cook some decoct fractions for use ahead of time, it'd
be a good idea to compensate for that fraction's enzymes which you've
removed from mash pool's.   That is, if you remove a couple of pounds of
mash for pre-processing you might wish to compensate for it with some extra
malt in the mash since those enzymes will be denatured by the p-cooking,
and the sacch. rests for a stiff fraction are sub-optimal.  This is most
important for those grainbills which are cut close to their max diastactic
potential.  Decoctions are inherantly efficient, and as a soft water brewer
I feel they are even required sometimes for only this reason, but still,
keep an eye toward what you've removed early!

Excessive water thru a septic system is NOT a good idea for a couple of reasons.
First the soils can be come overloaded and the leach field will not be able to
properly percolate the water.  Second large amounts of water flowing thru the
septic tank can result in solid matter being flushed into the leach area.  This
happens because solid material entering the tank does not have sufficient time
to settle to the bottom if the flow thru the tank is too fast.  These solids
can plug the gravel in the leach area and/or the hole in the pipes.


The "gray water" disposal is an option, however it is not legal in all states.


If you can avoid sending the water (especially cooling water) to the septic
system I'd do it.  I run my cooling water to the yard thru a garden hose.

Mark asked about storage/picking of Hops.
I'm hear to tell you that you must dry them, and dry them enough not to
go to mush and stink in the freezer.  No, you can't freeze them in
water.  If you live in a dry climate, dry in sun, if like me in south,
get a dehydrator or use oven, and dry until slightly 'crisp or
crunchy'.  I then mash into freezer bag or glass jar and freeze.  I
usually pick when a few start to yellow on tips of leaves.  Not brown,
that is supposed to be too late.
Most of what I've used are very low AA, use for aroma only.

Using a pump to move the wort, from mash tun to boiler, will work fine
provided; the pump is not too powerful, the false bottom is strong enough
and /or manifold is open enough, the grain crush is not too fine and you
can regulate the output.


If your vessels are on the same level the first 50% of the wort can be
moved via gravity and the pump used to bring the remainder over

The only time I have gotten a grassy taste from my hops were when I
picked them early.  I still use hops straight from the vine if it is
convenient.  I  also got the grassy flavor from British hops one time.


On other things hoppy, I always get at least two pickings of hops.  That
is one advantage of growing your own, you can pick them when they are
ready.


I was lazy this year and did not get around to trimming one hill back to
the normal 3 or 4 bines to start the growing season.  This hill is now
about two feet wide and four feet long and my wife has beaten it back
with the lawn mower.  It has hardly produced any hops this year.  My
other hills productions are down but still significant.  Another factor
in all this is I have not watered like I did in years past.

Greetings!!


Back in HBD #3100, Ed Busch, Chairman of the AHA Board of Advisors, tells us 
that things they are a-changin' at the old AHA!  Hmmmmm...  Deja vous (sp??) 
is kicking in...  Haven't we heard this before??  But that's not the point of 
my post.  Ed raves about the success of the recent AHA conference, which was 
setup and run by local homebrew club members and other volunteers.  He goes on 
to say that the AHA is looking for more of the same:  Member-run conferences 
and other events.  Gee, if the members are the ones doing all the work, what 
role does the AHA actually play??  Hmmmmmmm...

     Mike, you didn't fall asleep!  Calling something 100% polyamide nylon 
     is a chemical oxymoron, and very non-descriptive.  The material may or 
     may not be suitable for brewing purposes, because there are several 
     polyamides that are not suitable, for instance proteins are 
     polyamides, etc.  The "nylon" part may be refering to aliphatic 
     polyamides, nylon 6, nylon 6,6 nylon 12, 6,12 and many others.  Now to 
     the other question, nylon (meaning aliphatic nylon 6, or especially 
     nylon 6,6) is very stable to agressive chemicals because it is fairly 
     crystalline.  The polymer chains are packed away in tight crystals and 
     not available for chemical attack.  Which is why, for instance 
     polyethylene, and polypropylene are also widely used in harsh chemical 
     environments.  The only problem with nylon is that it would not be 
     very resistent to many sanitizers especially chlorine, however, nylon 
     mesh bags are sold and used for dry hop bags, mash filtering etc and 
     can be boiled (at least a few times) for sterilization.

Subject: Nice work Ken, and some comments...


Ken Schwartz has made a lot of great contributions to the on-line world of 
brewing and I would like to thank him for that.  I decided to go all-grain 
after reading some of the info on Ken's web page.   Having said that, I am 
glad to see that he is continuing to do good work with his recent 
investigations into no-sparge/batch-sparge techniques.  It does appear that 
there are a lot of variables involved with accurately predicting the 
resulting gravity for these brewing methods and hopefully with enough data 
points, it will be easier to nail down.  I may try such a method on my next 
batch.  However, in lieu of a reliable, reproducible method, it seems to me 
that one could use what Ken has proposed as a means of getting the gravity in 
the right ballpark.  Then, after collecting all of the runnings and taking 
gravity readings, just do a couple of calculations to determine how much 
DME/LME or water is needed to get to the target SG.  In fact, this 
calculation would probably be a good one to enter into Ken's spreadsheet.  
One would just enter the volume of collected runnings, the measured SG and 
the desired volume and the make-up amounts would be computed automatically.  
This amount would likely be small enough that they wouldn't affect the 
character of the recipe.  With such an approach, the advantages 
(time/effort/maltiness) of no-sparge/batch-sparge can be realized without 
having to worry much about hitting the target gravity.  


Another added benefit is that such a technique could also be used by those 
who would be pushing the volume limits of their mash/lauter tuns with a batch 
sparge.  In effect, this would be a twist on a partial-mash technique.

Hi all!


It's been a while since I've had a chance
to look at the HBD, which makes me sad.  Perhaps
we can get internet access at the brewpub soon
(hint hint).  Has the Clinitest thing been settled yet?


For those of you new to the HBD, I was a very frequent
contributor to these pages over the past few years.  I have
recently become the head brewer at the CH Evans Brewing
Company at the Albany (NY) Pump Station (say that
three times fast).


We have been open for 9 weeks now, and I can say
that I am having quite a bit of fun.  The hours are long, and
keeping up with demand has been challenging.


I have settled into a groove with 6 beers on draft, and I serve
cask-conditioned beers Thursday-Saturday (I go through one firkin
per night most weekends).  I am extremely pleased with the maturity
of the Albany beer drinkers; while the blonde ale is 30% of beer sales,
70% of the beer sales are the other brews!  The ESB and Hefeweizen
are doing quite well.  A Belgian pale ale I brewed as a yeast propagation
batch for a tripel sold so quickly that I'll have to brew it again!  Life
is tough...


Brewing on a 10 bbl system really isn't much different from my 1/2 bbl
home system, except that there are greater opportunities for making
messes on a larger scale.  The hardest part of my transition from hobby
brewer to pro has been juggling the brewing schedule in such a way that
I don't leave a tap empty for more than a quiet afternoon.  It is 
challenging
to arrange the schedule so that new beers are ready to drink as the old
ones kick, and then brew the next beer that you think will kick
right into the tank again.  Invariably, something happens to hinder
the smooth transition:  a beer isn't quite ready yet, or two different
beers are about to kick at the same time and you only have one
fermentor free, or you once again can't get Weyermann wheat malt
from Crosby and Baker, etc.


I guess the fact that I use many different yeasts doesn't make
life any more simple (the 6 beers on tap now represent 4 different
yeasts).  I believe that different beer styles require certain yeast
strains, and as long as I can do it, I will try to make beer with the 
yeast
best suited to the job.


If any of you are ever in the Albany, NY area stop by and say "hello."
I am there almost all of the time.


Have fun!

Subject: I'd rather phyte than switch


Here's another (BRIEF!) volley in the phytin game-


AJ, we've gotten in pretty deep, you're probably the only one reading this
post!


Put briefly, Todd Carlson pointed out to me that the pKa's on ADP are about 2
and 7 so it was the oxygen with the HIGH pKa (about 12.5) not the low one that
is involved in the ester bond. (yes, yes, I know resonance and all that but
giving the oxygens discrete pKa's is an easy way to think about it and after
all they do behave this way in titration.) This now makes sense to me because
in the synthesis of ADP or ATP it is probably an oxygen on the terminal
phosphate group that will be attacking the phorphorus of Pi and the -OH will
be a good leaving group because it can pick up a proton to form water. But I
digress ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGG I said this would be brief.


What's the point? That a similar situation probably exists in phytic acid -
the two singly bound oxygens will have pKa's about 2 and 7 therefore, upon
hydrolysis you regenerate free phosphoric acid/phosphate and the oxygen
liberated which previously formed the ester bond will have a pKa of around
12.5 and will definitely pick up a proton from solution. This means that BOTH
the OH(-) AND the H(+) will be consumed during hydrolysis  - thus NO NET
CAHNGE IN pH!! 


********* NOTE: BREWING RELEVANT MATERIAL ***************


So, I'm right back to where I started from - that it is not the release
of phosphate during the mash itself that lowers the mash pH but the subsequent
complexation/precipitation of this phosphate with divalent cations (most
likely calcium) that drives the lowering of the mash pH.

Subject: Hop growing as therapy


Fellow hop farmers - 
     As the number of posts on hop growing/harvesting/drying enters its 
seasonal increase, I thought I'd share this little piece from a recent issue 
of 'Senior Living Design'. 
     "In New Norfolk, Tasmania, the annual cycle of hop growth and harvest 
was part of everyday life. Trying to find the perfect village-like 
envrionment to stir residents' memories, Robert Morris-Nunn tranported 
elements of traditional hop farms to Corumbene. An original hop pickers' hut 
sits in a courtyard; its restored interiors include a working fireplace. 
There's also a "dunny" (outhouse) and a new rainwater tank to collect runoff 
from the hop pickers' hut. Residents can fill buckets from the tank's tap 
just as they used to. Critics who questioned the real wood fires have been 
silenced: No residents have been injured, though the men stoke the fires and 
everyone warms their "bums."


   There are pictures of the hut and interior.  


   The text is from an article entitled "New Ideas in Dementia Care."


Uh.......

I would think the accuracy of a scale to accomplish this would be quite
cost prohibitive for the homebrewer, if it would work at all.  A better
idea would probably to capture the volume of CO2 that is created. 
Simple method, inverted in water graduated container...
< Snip


        I had a kind of similar idea about doing some measurements where I
work and mentioned them to my boss. After he stopped laughing, he said that
it was similar to weighing the steering wheel of a car by weighing the car
then removing the steering wheel and re-weighing the car and determine the
weight of the steering wheel by difference. The percentage of the mass lost
due to the off-gassing of CO2 is so slight as to not be measurable using a
scale with a capacity of 60 or 70 lbs required to weigh fermenting wort.


         I also thought it would be neat to measure the amount of CO2
produced during fermentation, and also timing when fermentation started and
stopped by watching the flow of CO2. A quick "back of the envelope"
calculation yielded a couple of  hundred liters of CO2 from a 5 gallon
batch. I borrowed a piece of equipment from work, it is similar to a gas
meter, and connected it to my fermentation lock. I had good results
initially, over the first 2 or 3 days, but then the flow rate diminished
enough to prevent the meter from working properly. If memory serves, I
measured about 300 liters of CO2 while the meter was working. My point here
is that inverting a graduated cylinder in a water bath is not going to be
sufficient for measuring the amount of CO2 produced from fermenting wort.
What would work is a mass flow sensor, however we did not have any with the
required sensitivity for this experiment. If anyone is interested in playing
around with these ideas feel free to email me. The brewing season is about
to start.  Private responses are okay.

Sounds to me like you just engineered a new problem.... "stuck wort".


If you keep the wort churning during the cool down, no screen in the world will
remain clear.  Don't confuse the filter bed of a mash tun with the minimal
filtering provided by hops.


The only way a screen works with hops is if it is allowed to settle for 30 mins
or so.  You might as well use that 30 mins for cooling.  To cool it a bit faster
and then wait for it to settle does not buy anything.

four online hop catalogs.  Go to a company called Just Hops they list 18
domestic and 26 imported varieties available by the ounce or pound.  I have
never ordered from them and have no affiliation et cetera.


My belated thanks to all who responded to my request for help with a cherry
