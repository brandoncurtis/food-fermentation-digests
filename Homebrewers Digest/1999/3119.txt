Subject: Cleaning a CF wort chiller


Tom O'Conner asked about cleaning a CF wort chiller. I would recomend 2
products by Birko, ACID BRITE and BRU-R-EZ. This is what I use at the
brewpub where I brew and used on my copper CF chiller when I homebrewed
(I still use my home system for yeast propagation). Check the archives
for my recent post on homebrewed CIP. I really can't say enough good
things about these cleaners--they work!


Also, I would suggest attaching shutoff valves to both ends of the CF so
that the chiller can be packed with iodophor for storage.


Hope this helps,
Harlan.

Subject: vacuum sealer bags


May I ask the collective to pursue the vacuum sealing bags some of us
use in storing  whole hops. I like to buy in 1 LB. quantities so I'm
never ' just a few grams shy' of the amount I need for a given brew. I
vacuum-seal with a Foodsaver using their bags (by Tilia), and store in a
 -20F freezer. The bags do hold a vacuum well, but of course that doesn't
mean that some oxygen enters over time, and sometimes I have hops stored
well over a year  beyond harvest. Has anyone found a source for TRUE
"oxygen-barrier" - e.g.foil/mylar - bags, and tried them in a vacuum
sealer? I wonder whether it would make a significant difference if hops
are in frozen storage for extended periods.  Thanks - C. Waters

Subject: EisBock


So now that we all know about the term "ice beer" how would one go about
producing a home brewed version. I never brewed a barley wine or a
Oktoberfest in time for the holidays so I'm thinking that an EisBock might
be a good alternative. I would assume a high gravity lager with a normal
primary and secondary fermentation process and then the "icing" process. If
my assumption is correct so far then it seems that one would have to do the
lagering/icing in some sort of container that would allow you to skim the
ice like a plastic fermentor. So again if my assumptions are correct so far
wouldn't I be taking a huge risk of introducing nasties during this
"skimming" phase? Does anyone have any practical advice on this process?

Subject: Cleaning/Sanitizing a CF Chiller


IMHO, the best way is through simple boiling water.  It is true that we
make cleansers for use in brewing, but in my brewhouse, the only thing
to touch the inside of my CF chiller is wort and water-- I really think
that using anything else is a) potentially hazardous to the life of your
chiller, and b) a waste.


Copper is obviously a soft metal, and it is susceptible to corrosion in
the presence of both alkalis and acids.  Unless you can be absolutely
certain that you have rinsed the entire length completely, I wouldn't
trust the chance of residuals.


I realize that this is rather anal and unreasonable, but I didn't get
the occasional nickname of "Brew Nazi" for nothing!<g>


Anyway, before and after brewing, I boil about 2-3 gallons of water and
run that through the chiller (with cooling water off and hoses
disconnected-- my chiller is made with hose designed to take quite a bit
of heat, so this might not work for some).  I don't worry about
sanitation on the hot end (it's pretty close to the flame during boiling
and is probably in excess of 200 F for much of that time, and I use some
acid based sanitizer applied with a toothbrush to the other end just
prior to use (to be safe).

Subject: yeast, theory etc


I want to clarify my post about data on the Wyeast site. My point was that
I realy do not think that Dave Logsdon did the experiment to determine the
data he presents there.  And he does not rpovide a reference for the data.
Thus one ehsould question is it valid data.  This goes for anything.


As tot he shop owner who is getting asked to switch from one brand to the
other I would suggest he ask a few questions.  How is the manufacutuer
doing qc/qa testing.  Is every batch tested?  Waht are the limits of
sensitivity for the testing methods being used?  Is there a master culture
and working cultures and how often does the lab go back to the master
cultures?  What testing has been done on the strains being used?  For
example has the lab used something like the Biolog system to trakc the
yeast for characterisitc changes?  Is the lab willing to provide actual
testing data from their lab?  Are they willing to undergo FDA inspection?


WRT to pumps and reynolds etc.  I think we all need to read the posts and
try not to get glassy eyed by the numbers etc.  Do the arguements posted
seem reasonable?  Are the numbers in the ball park?  And one can post all
the theoretical stuff they want but it is really not validated until one
has done the experiment with the materials in question.  Is anyone going
to do some pumping experiments and then run some PAGE gels to look at
protein breakdown?

A favorite of mine - top fermenting yeasts - ones that throw up a thick
pancake of yeast.  There is some confusion about the Ringwood yeast,
which is a definite top fermenter.  As a matter of fact, our local
Ringwood brewpub, Grizzley Peak, throws in a submersible pump on the
second or third (?) day and sprays a fountain of fermenting beer over
the yeast head to reoxygenate the beer.  This results in a distinctive
diacetyl house characteristic, needless to say.




Some have claimed that Wyeast 1968 is Ringwood, others have disputed
this.  I don't know.  Others have claimed that 1968 is NCYC 1187, and
that this is Ringwood.  This I can refute.  1187, which I have used
from Yeast Culture Kit Co., does *not* make a yeast head.  As a matter
of fact, it acts like a bottom fermenter - it really drops out fast
when it's done.  YeastLab sells it as A10 (available only to micros and
brewpubs in large amounts) as ideal for unitanks because it drops so
well.  YCKC also sells it.  Don't know the number.




YeastLab A09,  English ale yeast, is definitely Ringwood.  Dan
McConnell, who owns YCKC and produces YeastLabs liquid yeasts, posted
this to HBD in Dec., 1994.




A really fine top fermenting English yeast is NCYC 1332, which is
called Strathcona in homebrew circles because it was used by the now
defunct Strathcona micro (BP?) in Edmundton.  YCKC sells it.  It
produces nice complex flavored ales.  




The NCYC site http://www.ifrn.bbsrc.ac.uk/ncyc/ does give the
information Roger wanted (but they won't give the original source of
the yeast).  Here is what they say about 1332 (the site tells how to
interpret the numbers).  Note that it mentions good head formation
(>15mm!):


Species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae


Strain no. 1332


Head formation. good head


Deposit - amount of yeast deposited. > 15mm


Attenuation. 1.006-1.008


Rate of fermentation. 6-8


Clarity of the final beer. 0-10




My new favorite English top fermenter, which gives that fruitiness that
Roger wanted, is from Ridley's in Essex, UK.  I brought home a
contaminated sample from the brewery this March which Dan cleaned up
for me.  (They have a new head brewer and my man in Essex says the
beers are improving).  It really wants to climb to the top of the beer,
and maybe out of it.  It produces a really authentic English flavor
profile.  Fruity with other complexities.  I just finished a really
nice mild made with it.  Dan sells slants of this yeast through YCKC. 
As someone recently mentioned, Dan has lots he doesn't mention in his
catalog.  Just ask him mailto:YCKCo`at`aol.com.  Usual disclaimer.   Dan
is a friend and gives me starters for his own QA and because he's a
nice guy, but, as Dave Draper liked to quote me when he posted here, "I
can't be bought for a mere $3.50."

It's just that homebrewing represents the perfect intersection of those who
have the technical ability to work with biological weapons, and those who fit

American beer, buster? Are you some kind of communist?

Before me and my brewing partners upgraded our lagering fridge, we spent a
winter unintentionally making ice beer. The back row of the fridge was
particularly conducive to freezing up the kegs. We often wouldn't know for
sure whether the beer was iced until the filtering process, in which case we
would yield a much lower volume.


Apart from a rather elevated alcohol content, the thing I noticed most about
the beers was their clarity and stability, as Dr. Fix has apparently noticed.
We iced pilsener, bock, maerzen and just about every style imaginable.


After the first icing, we were quite enthusiastic about the process. We tried
to duplicate it. This proved problematic. Even if you have extremely precise
temperature control, isn't "icing" difficult to control because you have to
capture the beer in its transition state (from liquid to solid)? And doesn't
that depend on how much time the beer spends in the transition state? With a
very small mass of beer, and the impossibility of visually monitoring or
otherwise measuring the degree of "icing", how do you adapt ice brewing to an
amateur scale?

Subject: Re: Cleaning CF Chillers


Tom asked about cleaning CF chillers, a topic that comes up every now and
then. Here's how I do it:


After I've finished with it, I back flush the chiller with high pressure
water from my garden hose, make sure the casing is completely drained of
cooling water, then run about a gallon of moderately strong TSP solution
through the chiller. (Actually, I use a non-phosphorus TSP substitute made
by Red Devil called TSP-90. It works great for all kinds of cleaning. I am a
big fan of this stuff. Even used it this past weekend for an, almost,
no-effort cleaning of my deck.) After the TSP-90 flush, I flush with a
gallon of boiling water, drain all the water out of the chiller, and STORE
IT DRY. On brew day, right before I use it, I run about a gallon of boiling
water through the dry chiller, then I leave the tubing full of boiled water
and immerse the racking cane end into the boiling wort. The boiled water in
the tubing starts the siphon when it comes time to rack. 


I cannot over-emphasize the advice about storing the chiller dry. I know
several people in this forum have advocated storing chillers filled with
iodophor solution. I, too, used to do this. But I found it corroded the
tubing. The first time I used TSP-90, after about two years of routinely
storing my chiller filled with iodophor solution, the TSP-90 flushed big
disgusting chunks of black crud out of the tubing and the water was tea
colored. I had to use three gallons of strong solution plus an hour in a
pure vinegar soak to get the tubing clean. I don't think this stuff was
necessarily infectious, because I've never had a problem with infected
batches. But it was gross looking and not something I'd want to get into my
beer.


Anyway, that's how I clean and store my chiller, and the system works for
me.

All I have ever done is run about 5 gallons of boiling water through mine 
before use.  After use, I run hot tap water through it and then just shake 
(while twirling or rotating) out the excess water.  This has worked just 
fine for me for the past 5 years or so.  If you start to get second 
thoughts and think that you need something a little more effective than 
plain old boiling water, just grab a hold (for a second or two) of the 
copper input coil while flushing to remind yourself just how effective it 
is.

If you have no reason to believe there is a problem (beer tastes fine, 
proper carbonation levels, etc.), then there is probably isnt one.  I 
tried a few on mine (bleach solution, iodine, TSP, among a others), but 
since I didnt want to disturb the chemistry of the copper tubing, I gave 
up on the use of cleaners and sanitizers.  I really dont know if you will

More precisely, Ethyl Hexanoate (CAS = 123-6-0) is a saturated, open 
chain, non-aromatic ester My flavor reference (Aldrich) includes fruity, 
wine-like, apple, banana, brandy as the flavors associated with this 
compound.  Licorice is not listed.  Im not saying that you dont perceive 
Ethyl Hexanoate as licorice, but if I was looking for licorice flavor, I 
would choose something else.


According to NTP Chemical Repository (Radian Corporation, August 29, 
1991), the following chemicals or compounds can contribute to a licorice 
flavor:


anethol
p-propenylanisole
anise camphor

p-methoxy-beta-methylstyrene
1-methoxy-4-propenylbenzene

I puzzled over this also.  Finally used a plastic valve from a bottling

Now, use a Female adapter, that is 3/4 Fem Pipe thread by, in your case, 
3/4 sweat fit.  Thread onto the remaining male threads of plastic valve.  I 
assembled on a bench first, and used a center punch to dimple all of the

Subject: Attenuation Control


In HBD #3118 Scott Church asks about stopping fermentation early to
achieve a high FG.


Scott, a few concerns come to mind with the idea of stopping fermentation
before it is done.  The first thing that comes to mind is that the
finished product will be more sweet and/or less clean tasting.  Also,
bottling is out.  In order to stop the fermentation you will have to
remove (filter) or kill (pasteurize) the yeast so there will be no way to
carbonate the beer.  If you are set up for kegging this is not a problem
because you can force carbonate.  The next item that come to mind is that
one of the great things about "living beer" is that, just like you are I,
beer changes over time.  I brewed a Strong Scotch Ale almost two years
ago.  It was hideous at racking time.  I bottled it and tried it in a
month and it wasn't bad.  After six months it got rave reviews from
people who tried it.  I brought a bottle to a Homebrew Club meeting a few
months ago at around eighteen or nineteen months and even the experienced
judges in the club were looking for a second taste.  Now at, 1 year 45
weeks, I have a bottle or two left and think that I will save it for new
years eve 2000.


Anyway, instead of stopping the fermentation early, try mashing at a
higher temperature.  By mashing at, say 156-158F, you will form more
dextrins (unfermentables) thus increasing the FG and the mouth feel.   If
you extract brew you could try a less attenuative yeast and a malt
extract that has a lower rate of fermentability.  I'm sure that you will
get other suggestions from the HBD group.  Good luck and happy brewing.

you can affect your final gravity by choosing a less-attenuative yeast.
also, you may be able to finish a little higher if you are an all-grain
brewer and you saccharify at a higher temperature.  i believe some of the
crystal malts (and maybe others?) will also boost finishing gravities, but
that's a malt bill change and it may not be appropriate for the beers you
brew.


"stopping" the primary fermentation (via filtration, crash chilling,
potassium sorbate ?) might leave some "worty" tastes in your beer that you
won't like.  i've had fermentations that didn't go all the way to completion
due to poor yeast health/low population, plus my impatience to get the beer
in the lagering tank.  i had a vienna-style lager a couple years ago that
finished at 1.018.  i thought that was fine until i tasted the beer.  it had
a worty taste component, similar to the taste of a wort gravity sample.


on an aside, it's not only the malty unbalanced sweet portion of the worty
taste that i dislike, it's also a sort of an "unrefined" hop flavor.  i get
this same flavor in some beers that are dry-hopped, even though they may be
properly attenuated.  i wonder sometimes if the reason some german brewers
(e.g. prince ludwig) blanch their hops before dry-hopping is in part to try
and change this raw hop flavor slightly.  (the other reason would be to
avoid infection)


i would recommend experimenting with yeast strains and mash temperatures
before moving on to other methods of final gravity adjustment.  beyond the
ale/lager distinction in attenuation capability, an unattenuative yeast
strain (e.g. wyeast 1968) that is treated properly and ferments strongly
will be an easier (and hence more repeatable) method of controlling final
gravity than trying to intervene at precisely the right moment to stop the
yeast from fermenting the beer further.


what would be interesting would be to combine attenuative yeasts and high
mash temps and contrast that with unattenuative yeasts and low mash temps,
for the same malt/hop bill and fermentation schedule.  for similar finishing
gravities, what would the flavor differences be?  it might be tough to
distinguish the process-derived differences from the differences due to
using different yeasts.  i guess a lager recipe would be more conducive to
getting decent information.  this is turning into a ramble-fest. 


good to hear from george de piro.  i hope he doesn't let the demand for his
beer  cause a compromise in methods.  that might turn into a self-correcting
problem.  so easily proclaimed by a home-brewer, right george? ; )

Regarding Chris Farley's post in #3116 concerning Wyeast & White Labs:
 
"Wyeast's David Logsdon has been trying to convince me to stop carrying
Wlabs
yeast vials and become an exclusive Wyeast supplier. As a retailer, I
value
having a diversity of cultures, but according to Logsdon, "the products
Wlabs
sell, are in most if not all cases sourced from us." I have used every
Wyeast
lager culture, and have never seen a yeast ferment like Wlabs Pilsen
yeast.


Is Logson correct in stating that Wlabs has sourced "most if not all"
their
cultures from Wyeast? Logson also claims that Wlabs production and
management
of the strains has been questioned by many brewers, but I have found
Wlabs
yeast to be completely consistent. Additionally, I've followed the HBD
for a
while and can only recall hearing positive things about Wlabs."


Far be it from me to tell another homebrew shop owner how to operate
their own shop. . . people have been trying to tell me how to run mine
for the last twenty years (ever notice how good these people are at
running other folks' business & poor at running thir own. . .?).  But,
if you want my two cents worth, I'll give it to you.  First, do you
really care if White Labs sourced their strains from Wyeast or directly
from other yeast banks?  The real question is whether or not you and
your customers like the quality and convenience of the White Labs
yeasts.  We have been selling them about a year and a half now and are
very pleased, indeed.  I originally planned on only handling 4 - 6
strains, because I was very concerned about turning the product over. 
This has turned out, thus far, to be a non-issue.  We typically run very
low  or out of these yeasts before the next order arrives, i.e. they
selling extremely well!  We are currently up to about a dozen different
strains, too.  Despite the fact that we charge $2 more for them, they
have taken probably 30% of my liquid yeast sales and remarkably enough,
even some of my dried yeast sales!  I don't anticipate them replacing
the "smack packs entirely.  I still like the storage properties and
"hands-off" mini-yeast starter properties of the smack packs too much.  
        BTW after we had been selling the White Labs for a few months,
Dave
came out with his version of the vials.  We simply did not have as good
a luck with them as with the White Labs, plus by that time my customers
were accustomed to the White Labs products.  Don't get me wrong about
Wyeast or Dave Logsdon.  I have the utmost respect for his products and
how he has revolutionized our industry.  I just think their is room for
more than one yeast supplier, just as, I am positive all the
distributors will tell you there is room for more than one retailer for
their products.  
        Personally I don't like manufacturers and distributors trying to
tell
me what products I should handle and which ones I shouldn't.  Let's face
it, they have a vested interest in making sure we only buy products from
them and them alone.  In my opinion, however, we, as retailers, owe it
to our customers and ourselves to offer a wide array of quality
products.  This is what keeps the customer coming back and ultimately,
paying the bills.  
        Anyway, that's my perspective.

The following news report may not be republished or redistributed, in whole

    TOKYO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Leading Japanese beer maker Kirin Brewery Co
Ltd said on Tuesday it will stop using genetically modified (GM) corn to
make beer by 2001, due to consumer concerns over the safety of
bioengineered crops.
    Although beer is exempt from Japanese requirements for labelling of
genetically altered food which take effect in April 2001, Kirin plans to
switch to non-GM corn, saying it cannot ignore consumer doubts about the
safety of such food.
    "We believe GM corn is safe. But as long as consumers are worried about
its safety, we want to take measures that will wipe out their worries," a
company spokesman said.
    Kirin has not so far distinguished between GM and non-GM corn when
buying raw materials.
    It uses nearly 200,000 tonnes of corn annually, most of it imported
from the United States.
    Kirin is considering signing new contracts with U.S. farmers and
distributors to supply exclusively non-GM corn, he added.
    The corn would be imported by the Japanese trading house Mitsubishi
Corp <8058.T>. Kirin is a member of the Mitsubishi group of companies.
    Under its food safety guidelines, Japan has approved 22 varieties of GM
crops for import and sale, including soybeans, corn, rapeseed, potatoes,
cotton and tomatoes.
    But the government earlier this month decided to impose labelling
requirements on these crops and food products made from them in order to
allow consumers to make an informed choice.
    It has exempted some processed food products, such as vegetable oil,
for which existing technology cannot determine if they were made using
genetically-altered ingredients.
    Japan imported 9.13 million tonnes of corn in the first half of 1999,
of which imports from the U.S. accounted for 8.82 million tonnes or 96.5
percent.
    Japan's farm ministry estimates GM corn accounted for 23 to 34 percent
of total corn planted acreage in the U.S. in 1998.
