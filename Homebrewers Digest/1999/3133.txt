Subject: Re: Copper Coil for Jockey Box


Matthew is concerned that his soft copper coil will poison him.


No Worries (as we say down under).


Nothing has been added to the copper to make it soft.  Copper is a very
soft metal when it is first made, but as you form it into wires, sheets,
tubes etc it becomes harder ( Technical term is that it Work Hardens).  The
stiff straight pipes that you buy for water etc are simply made and left
hard.


The soft copper tubing is made in the same way, but then is heated above
600-700 deg c and quickly cooled.  This softens ( or anneals) the metal. 
If you watch a plumber working with copper pipes they will often heat the
pipe to a red heat and then let it cool before bending it or expanding it
for fittings, flares etc.


You can try this at home yourself if you are having trougble bending that
coil for a chiller etc.  Just heat it until it turns red (not too much
hotter or it WILL start to melt or oxidise away), and allow it to cool.  


Turns it into soft putty.....

While Regan's 'Thursday note meets' are legendary, the shop is the stellar

I demand a retraction - Newcastle holds the "blackhole" title.  I well
remember my excitement the day when the range of whole grains doubled to
include both 'cracked' and 'uncracked' grains.  No barley varieties, no
spec sheets, no colour or specialty grains.  Hence my annual 300 km visits
to Regan's.


I often wonder what needs to be done to kick start this wonderfull hobby of
ours so that the oz Home Brew scene could mirror the variety enjoyed by our
US bretheren.

Can't you make up for the the lack of hop bitterness due to a short boil
simply by boiling a hop tea and adding it (and the hops used) to your
wort?  Just a thought.

Hi All,


Super Wal Mart carries the Hodgson Mills products and this includes soy
flour at $2+ a pound.  Couldn't determine if it was defatted or not. Don't
know if the milling process gelatinizes the starchy stuff.


Would soy need to be gelatinized prior to addition to the main mash?


B. Sheck asked about decoction techniques in a previous post.  "Secrets of
the Double Decoction" by greg. J. Noonan in Zymurgy , "Special Issue -
Lagers and Lagering" seems to explain what's it's all about.  IMHO, he
debunks the positive effects of longer saccharification periods to enhance
flavor?

Subject: Question for the Engineers


I am building a Herms using SS sanke type kegs (actually AB).  I have been
told by a friend that applying the heat directly to these kegs can carbonize
the metal and weaken it.  (sounds hokey to me if theres liquid in it.)
Anyway, the person said that it might be wise to put a curved copper plate
on the bottom of the pot to spread the heat and improve heating
characteristics.  You could spin a copper plate to fit the curve of the
keg.   The question is, is there any benefit to this at all?   It seems that
the copper would have to be physically attached or extremely close to the SS
keg to get the heat transfer desired.    Whadaya think????

Your organization has come under fire constantly since I have been
reading this forum and frankly I assumed you neither knew nor cared.
Its one of only a couple of reasons I haven't joined.  I have been a
member of this forum for almost a year, a homebrew club member for about
four (4) months, and a newbie homebrewer for about about seven (7)
months.  In that time I have NEVER heard a face to face positive comment
on Mr. Papazian or the AHA.  I have seen literally dozens of negative
comments posted here and in other forums.  Admittedly, I have seen a few
weak defenses made and even considered an old article I read about Geo.
Fix speaking at a convention a tacit endorsement, but I have either
missed or there has not been any show of concern for the impressions of
persons in the forum (and for that matter the homebrewing community at
large on the web).


Please, please, please, I beseech you Mr. Gatza.  Tell me why I should
join the AHA.  What will I be doing for myself, for the whole
homebrewing community, for the education of persons outside this
community about who we are and what we are about.  Are you mute in the
face of these many charges because they do not dignify a response or
because they are so completely accurate that their is no defense.

The reason Cooks works is not because it doesn't accept advertising, but
because of its Publisher/Editor, Christopher Kimball.  Kimball has an
ultra clear vision for what he wants to do with the magazine, and the
magazine reflects his vision.  He knows the kind of cooking he wants to
feature and how he wants his articles written.  To replace BT, a similar
leader would have to emerge.  IMHO, this is not a position that you
elect someone to because they are a great brewer or because they know
how to publish/edit a magazine.  It takes someone who has passion and a
vision for brewing instruction that they desperately want to see
realized in print.  At the same time they have to instinctively
understand their target audience.  This combination is very rare. (I do
think Dave Miller accomplished this with his first books and set new
standards for what a homebrewing book could be.)


I have felt for years that this is precisely the reason why Zymurgy has
struggled.  Some of Zymurgy's problems have been do to a lack of
vision.  For years they coasted with mediocre content and failed to
improve the quality of homebrewing.  Some of Zymurgy's problems came
from not understanding their target audience, thus the "Why we Brew"
issue.

Actually, the opposite is true.  Pure copper by itself is very soft.  Small

I think that you'll probably get a lot of responses, but I'll throw my
$0.02 in since I believe I know the answer right off the bat-- copper is
pretty soft on it's own, although it will "work-harden."  I have heard
of copper being alloyed with nickel to make it more rigid, so maybe your
answer is in that.  The copper is unadulerated and not hardened via
compression or alloying.

Subject: Priming, 5l Kegs


Brewsters:


Darryl of Adlelaide is concerned because his
recently bottled beer seemed too clear at
bottling and after three days the carbonation
is inadequate.


Three days are not enough to make that
judgement. I would wait a couple of weeks.


If it is a problem, then make up an active
250 ml yeast starter <not> containing priming sugar
but with just a Tablespoon ( 15 ml) of malt extract
Allow this to reach full activity in about 12 hours
or so.  You will have to take the cap from
every bottle and add about 5 ml of this slurry
to each bottle and recap with new caps.
Allow to carbonate normally.


See the HBD archives for "Kraeusen starter"
and my name.When bottling, I always use
this method to guarantee a proper and fast
carbonation.  This is especially important
with flocculent yeast and if you use a
secondary to clear your beer. 




A proper HB beer, naturally carbonated,
should have only a paint coat of yeast on the
bottom of the bottle and this will allow you
to pour out nearly all of the beer.
- --------------------------------------------------------
Dan Cutcher is thinking about going to 5 liter
minikegs for his next brew.  Based on my
experience and lots of other comments here,
I suggest you skip the 5 l kegs and go directly
to a proper system with 3 and 5 gallon
Cornelius style (soda pop) kegs and a
carbon dioxide tank and regulator.  Final
cost is about the same and the results far
superior as far as controlling the product.


Over carbonating a 5 l keg can lead to 


a damaged keg at best.  Leaks and
lots of foaming with no way to correct 


also can be a problem.  Some people
use these successfully, but I was sorry
I ever spent the money. If you do buy
this system be sure not to waste your
money on the plastic tap version. I
didn't, but was still not satisfied with the
final result.

I knew Eric, but didn't know you knew Eric. Although it stood to reason

Eric asked me to promise not to tell who he was to either of you guys,

he'd closed down his email.


I figured since I didn't get a chance to promise, that means I can
tell... but since you guys know already, what's the point?

Gil's Pils was not a Czech Pilsner but rather a Bavarian style Pils, and
yep! one of the best I've encountered outside of the source of them, and
I do still talk about it on occasion (I do tend to be repetitive)....
mostly I think I give it as an example of how one can pay attention to
detail and technique, and sharpen ones tasting references by seeking out
"the sources", and then be extremely successful at brewing, without
getting their heads lodged up their theoretical (*).


(funny thing.... I've made MANY trips to the states, and always consume
as wide a variety of the micro brewed stuff, at as many places as
possible, and despite the fact that all the beer making expertise in the
world is residing there (I learned that here), I've never tasted
anything there that was even close to the quality of that bottle Gil had
with him).


I think I know the solution to that, though.


Those Yanks are obviously not burning up their clothes dryers.


Isn't it about time that Gil started passing on those little tips to his
trans-pacific cohorts?

   Well, I finally heard it straight from the horse's mouth.
An email form letter in response to some email I sent just before
the demise rumors started circulating said, in part:


   Regretfully I must announce that BrewingTechniques has ceased
   publication.  The reason is simple: ongoing financial losses
   and lack of material resources to support its continuation.  A
   letter is in the mail to all BT subscribers and advertisers
   explaining the situation in more detail.


And most interestingly:


   BrewingTechniques may not be entirely dead.  We are talking to
   several publishers and individuals who may be interested in
   purchasing the magazine and continuing publication.  Keep the
   faith.


It was "signed" by Stephen Mallory.
