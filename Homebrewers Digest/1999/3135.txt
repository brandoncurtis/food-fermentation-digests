Subject: HSA


Robin Griller in 3134 says, " For example,
in the very recently published edition of New Brewing Lager Beer, Greg
Noonan attributes two flavour impacts to hsa: roughness and astringency,
but he does not ascribe cardboard flavours to hsa, rather describing it 
as
a result of oxydation."
  Al Korzonas may pop in and tell us how though Greg is an excellent 
brewer
his science leaves something to be desired. So to add to Robins confusion


or maybe resolve it I'll quote from Dr. Fix's article, >>...His prime
concern was was volatile aldehydes such as 2-nonenal. This compound has a


characteristic papery or cardboard flavor that is sometimes accompanied 
by
leathery or woody tones...."molecular oxygen does not take a part [in
forming nonenal] in bottled beer" In later work he indentified oxidative
processes during wort production as a source of nonenal."
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
In reply to Alan's question....>>HUH?? Let me get this straight- here's a


guy who is
being fanatical in his
technique in order to /avoid/ HSA but his beer goes quickly stale so this


must
therefore be /due/ to HSA??? 




Am I missing something here?<<


  That was my fault, I skipped mentioning that Ed who built the same 
system
at the same time with the same parts from the same sources, only Ed uses 
a
recirc pump and Ed does not get HSA. In fact Ed won 1st in the Nationals
with a trippel. So from identical systems the one that ladles the wort
during recirculation shows a rapid staling rate compared to the system 
that
uses a recirculation pump.

Subject: Pepperberries / Belgian ales & Wit


I'd like to thank those people who wrote about my pepperberries question.
Several people mentioned adding some to a bottle of light-flavoured beer
and steeping for a few days. After doing this, and steping for a few days,
I've noticed two things:


a) Boy have they got a strong flavour!
b) This flavour doesn't go well at all with beer... I may try MUCH smaller
amounts next, but after the first experience, I doubt I'll do a full size
brew. 


Two things I will consider as well: adding them to a secondary fermenter
may result in a different flavour, especially after flavours mellow. Also,
cooked berries taste very different. This makes me think that pasteurised
berries may have a more subdued flavour than "dry berried" beer!


 ........................................


I used Wyeast 1214 Belgian Ale a while ago. I brewed a dubbel, OG 1.064, FG
1.012, Fermented at 18.5 C (65 F). 
Most Belgian ales in Belgium are fermented at high temperatures to ensure
proper attenuation. However, even though my temperature was not very high,
I got totally unacceptable levels of esters. Even more than a year later
it's only starting to get passable. However, most Belgian ales can be drunk
(and are quite yummy) at a few weeks of age. I used a good size starter,
which gives very good results with other strains of yeast, and my notes say
fermentation started within 8 hours.


Has anyone had similar experiences with this yeast? I'd also like to hear
of other people's (preferably good) experiences with other yeasts of the
'Belgian' range of Wyeast (high gravity, trappist, strong, etc...).


Finally, I am hoping to brew a wit similar to Hoegaarden soon, and some
feedback on how the two Wyeast strains (Belgian White and Belgian Wheat)
perform, would be extremely helpful, especially from people who have used
both.


Thank you for any help.
Cheers!

Subject: Idophor concentration


Welcome back everyone, and a big cheer to our saviours.


After a long search, I bought my Idophor from my local veterinarian.  They
use it for disinfecting the animal operating theatre etc.  But I am unsure
of the required dilution to achieve the desired 25ppm.


The label states that the active constituent is 100 mg/mL Povidone Iodine
equivalent to 10 mg/mL available Iodine.


Could one of the more chemically able amongst us please suggest how much I
should use to make a litre solution of 25ppm Iodine.




Thanks

Rod Prather is building a Herms using SS sanke type kegs and is concerned
that applying the heat directly to these kegs can carbonize the metal and
weaken it.


Rod, you can forget the copper plate on the bottom for 2 reasons :-


1. It won't work unless (as you suspect) that it is tightly bonded to the
keg bottom.  Otherwise any air gaps just provide an excellent insulator.


2. You don't need it. Stainless steel has good temperature resistance.  


As long as it is not getting red hot (and it wont) you will not change its
atomic structure.  The flange around the bottom will get very hot (so be
carefull) but still will not glow red.  Over time it will discolour
slightly to a lightish tan colour but this is still nothing to worry about.


If you don't believe me (any why would you - I wouldn't) just look at all
the brewing setups displayed on the web which use kegs as boilers.

Hey Dan:


I'm not the world's greatest water chemist, but unless there's something
wrong with the numbers:


Cl             5
Na            7        
SO4         0        
Mg   less than 0.01
Total hardness: 74
pH:        7.25


there's a simple answer.  Make Pilsner, you lucky dog.  Hardness that isn't
Mg is Ca.  The Ca level is therefore 40% of the total hardness, or 32 ppm. 
The pH is fairly close to 7, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.  (it
seems odd that they have Mg but not Ca.  It's a variation on the same test
 - are you sure it wasn't Mn?).


There is no sulphate, therefore no permanent hardness - it's all
bicarbonate, for practical purposes, but not enough to worry about.  As far
as simple tests go, mash in and take a pH reading.  After 10 minutes of
protein rest you're either in range or not.


I would not make my bitters, etc. very dark without some chalk.  I have no
idea how much, I brew using water similar to Munich and go by feel and pH
readings.

Rod's friend is thinking of carbide precipitation when welding 300-series
stainless steels.  This does indeed weaken and reduce the corrosion
resistance of the metal if the metal gets overheated during welding and can
be seen as two lines of black flecks either side of the weld.


As Rod correctly guessed, the temperatures involved are way beyond those
experienced during a boil unless you do something wrong, like boiling dry.


The copper plate may help reduce hot spots, but again Rod is right:  to get
any real benefit you would have to really effectively bond the copper to
the stainless, or you just create hot spots.

Fisrt off I have great respect for Ken and yes I met him for the first
time at an AHA conference.  He is intelligent and articulate and I thought
he must have had a brain infarct when I heard he was joining the AHA BofA.
Second many would suggest I should just get over it and not continue to
point out the past faults of the AHA.  Well maybe a few more years of
therapy will change that.  And at the same time there are those who talk
about not forgetting the past lest we have to relive it.  


I was introduced to Dan via the net and was using the net and compuserve
for most of by info before I found a local club.  At the same time I got
my start reading Zymurgy and papazian and _used_ to wait in anticipation
for each new issue of Zymurgy.  So these sources of information do play a
role in providing a resource for getting people started in homebrewing.

Very impressive I must say.  But you could have done this without the AHA.
What actual support did they provide other than giving you a venue to give
the presentation?  What actual resources did the AHA provide?  Free
conference entrance and what else?  My point being that if you go through
your post and eliminate all mention of the AHA little would change.  It
was the homebrewers them selves who did the work NOT the AHA.

Just to correct you.  I won the HBofY award in Denver and gave the
presentation in New Orleans.  Thank for the kind words about my
presentation.  But I think I felt as you and Dan did, that if people were
going to pay airfare and hotel and conference fees then we should give
them their monies worth, right?  I put in a great deal of time and effort
and as you may recall was less than pleased.  And then after that I had to
deal with the AHA and their overly restrictive waiver that I signed.  Then
I had to wait for the AHA to decide they did not want to publish the talk.
At least BT stepped in and gave me a forum to publish the whole thing.

A great talk, beer engines and all. But again here we have a case of two
guys who worked for a computer stats company and were able to really
analyze the data.  The AHA did not provide SAS or SPSS for them to do the
star plots. :-)  And the AHA contributed how?

how much "help" they were.  I feel I've gotten more for my money by flying
out to Mike's house and participating in the Annual tastings he used to
have.

See above.  Look at the resources the internet outside of the AOB has to
offer.  I did not see that the AHA forum traffic suddenly skyrocketed when
the hbd went down.  I am a science technogeek.  So I went to Seibels and I
own almost all the professional brewing texts still in print. I also make
liberal use of university libraries.

I applaud your efforts.  But again it looks like the AHA conf. is being put
together on a local level with little input or support from the AHA.

I support your efforts.  But many of us have seen this before.  Will the
AHA listen and respond?  Is the AHA and Zymurgy willing to pick up where
BT left off to keep the more technically inclined interested?  Or are we
going to continue to see issues of Zymurgy that have reprints from books
and rehashing Dr. Sirbite?

Get Don Fienberg to talk about Belgian beer and food. Or Frank Boon or a

Previously Jim Parker was working on getting student rates for the ASBC
for AHA members.  
The yeast culturing workshops are also a big hit and go along way towards
putting Wyeast out of business.


Beer and Religion through history.
Herbal beer stuff.  Something that has really begun to interest me in my

Technical info from the pro journals.  but the reviews need to be written
by someone who really understands science literature  My big gripe in
the past was that James Spence somewhat misinterpreted that actual info.


Louis bonhams beer lab stuff 
I might even be willing to write for Zymurgy if they ever got a decent
editorial staff.  I think the Article John Plamer and I wrote was one of
the most useful things I have ever been a part of.

Yes provide the AOB/AHA starts really listening and giving straight
answers rather than spin control about stuff like their finances.

Subject: help with Full Sail Amber ale recipe


hi,


i'm going to attempt a Full Sail Amber Ale clone this weekend. here's
my current recipe, generated from a recipe found online and from
reading the Full Sail web page description of their beer. my local
shop has no Mt. Hood hops so i'm using Perle since these are supposed
to both be from the same family (Hallertau, i believe). Mt. Hood
usually have fairly low alpha content though while Perle is up at
6%...


i'm using irish ale yeast since that is supposedly the house yeast for 
Full Sail (according to a Brewing Techniques article i found in their
library). 


my main question is the hopping level for this brew. any tips are
appreciated. oh, the alpha rating for the Perle is the number i got
from the brew shop.


the problem is i don't really know or remember the bitterness level in 
Full Sail. 


also, i'm actually splitting this batch to explore how diff yeasts
affect the beer....


                               Full Sail Amber


Ingredients for 10 gal batch


9525 g two-row malt
 450 g 90 L Crystal malt
 115 g Chocolate malt
  56 g Perle whole hops (90 min)
  56 g Cascade whole hops (5.7%) 15 min
  28 g Cascade whole hops (finish)


per 5 gal batch:
  14 g Cascade plugs (dry hop)


yeasts:
split batch into two parts:


1) Irish Ale Yeast is supposedly used by Full Sail


2) ? maybe Burton on Trent since i have some around...

Flossmoor  IL 99-10-03 `at` 0742 CDT


Fellow Brewers:


I'm looking for one of those primitive sparge buckets that consisted of a 
five-gallon plastic pail with a zillion small holes in the bottom.  They have 
a nickname but I cannot recall it.  I need one for some experiments.


If anyone has one they are willing to part with for a nominal amount of cash 
and the effort to ship it to me, please e-mail me.

JET

Subject: Drilling an enamel canning pot


I am putting together an all grain set up to get me through grad 
school (read cheap yet functional).  Basically I need to drill a hole 
in my 8.25 gal enamel canning pot.  I have looked quite a few places 
and I have not been able to find any detailed explanations of how to 
attach a valve to an enamel pot.  I am worried about chipping it 
excessively and, also how to isolate the cut edges from the wort.  I 
have already purchased the brass fittings and nylon / stainless 
washers for a no weld tap.  My question is how safe is it to drill 
through an enamel pot and how does one go about doing this.  Will my 
nylon and stainless washers effectively isolate the raw edges of the 
cut if I put them on tight enough.  Any and all suggestions are 
welcome.  Personal email is fine.
