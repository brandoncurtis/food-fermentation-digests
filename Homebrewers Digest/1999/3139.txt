Subject: Glass sight for hot liquor tank


I am converting a Sanke keg to a hot liquor tank. I have purchased a
glass sight and a thermometer to mount to the side of the tank, and have
two questions:
1) I would like to avoid the welding and just drill holes and use nylon
washers on the fittings. Is this kosher, or are there probs with this?
2) the glass sight is mounted between two brass valves. I've heard about
lead leeching into wort...does this pose much of a problem for the HLT,
given that the only water that goes through the valves are the small
amount needed to fill the sight glass?

A question for the German Wheat experts...  I have been brewing a Weizen
that is quite good with the following grain bill (10 gallons):
10# Wheat Malt
9# Pale Malt
1# Six Row


I want to try my hand at a Dunkelweizen now and my thought was to to
leave the Wheat the same and replace the Pale and Six Row with Munich
and Vienna.  If this is a viable option, what quantities should I use?
Also, light or dark Munich or both?

Pat  Babcock ( pbabcock`at`mail.oeonline.com) writes:<


 Anyway, some of the "older-timers" may be reminded of the "boinked keg"
discussions a few years back (search thearchives around '94 through '96 
for
the word "boink"). If you naturally condition in the keg, or the kegged
beer wasn't yet done and takes off in the mini, it's life (and ability to


stand upright) is severely reduced.>


This was a severe problem with minikegs along with the leaky and fragile
German taps.  An artical in Zymurgy showed a method of building a 
pressure
relief valve into the hard plastic part of the bung so excess pressure
could be released. We now produce this design.  The minikegs will "boink"


in the pressure range of about 60 psi.  Phil's Relieph Bung starts to
release pressure at about 30 psi and will continue to release pressure
until the pressure falls to about 20 psi.  Phil's Relieph Bung is meant 
to
protect the minikeg from over pressure only.  It is not intended to 
control
carbonation levels.


Check out the "Philtap" at listermann.com.  It is a minikeg tap that does


not leak and won't fall apart when dropped.  Further it can be used with
the keg on its side so it fits on a lower shelf of the fridge to enhance
spousal acceptance.

Here is perhaps a more succinct estimation for yeast pitching rates which
agrees with the number of cells needed for pitching you have above:




() Desired yeast concentration for pitching into a "standard" gravity ale =
10 million cells per ml.


() A five gallon batch is about 20 liters


() Combine the above and you need 200 billion cells (2x10^11)




A one gallon saturated starter grown up in normal gravity wort (~1.050) will
get you there...

There is a beer they sell in State College PA called Penn State Ale (I
believe it is "ale").  It comes in the cobalt blue bottles but they don't
use labels.  The letters "Penn State..." are in raised white letters
similar to Rolling Rock bottles.  I should be down that way Nov. 6 and
could pick up some for you if you are interested.  Then I could go 0.15
minutes west and 0.07 minutes north and drop them off at your place.  You
might have to get the members of the Niagara Association of Homebrewers to
help empty them.

Subject: CABA's Brew Your Own Beer Seminar A Great Success


On Sunday September 19th, in Toronto, Ontario, the Canadian Amateur
Brewers Association held a Brew Your Own Beer Seminar to introduce
newcomers to the hobby. 21 people participated in the seminar, including
15 people who had no previous experience whatsoever. 


They were taken through the whole brewing process for an extract with
grain recipe and learned the importance of sanitation in the brewing
process. Participants were also introduced to the basics of beer culture
with a discussion of styles and history. At the end of the day they
received instructions for brewing their first batch of beer at home and
received a certificate for specialty malts and malt extract courtesy of
Premier and a discount on supplies and equipment at Brew Your Own. The
event was led by Rob Jones with the support of John Tyler, Brantz Myers,
Peter Mulloney and Barry Pilatze. Thanks also to C'est What Pub and
Brewery, Brew Your Own Homebrew Shop and Premier Malts for their
generosity.


On a personal note it seems to me that this is the type of event homebrew
clubs and organizations could organize and facilitate to revive an
interest in our hobby.

Subject: Iron, Big Starters


Brewsters:


Probably the worst beer in the world is Iron City Light
and I was forced to drink it during a night-long stay
in the old Pittsburg airport one dark and  stormy
winter night. Miserable? - you bet! It is interesting
that all the other beer disappeared first, which led
me to the conclusion that Americans must have
SOME taste for beer after all. I was almost happy
when the barkeep said "Sorry, no more beer"


Anyway, I don't know if it is psychological or not, but
Iron City beer ( the last time I tasted it) did have a metallic
taste to me. Maybe they used iron vats, being in a usta-be
steel town like Pittsburg.  However, most beer texts
ascribe the bigger danger of iron and copper to a haze
formation with hops, not a metallic taste, as I recall. So,
this checks with what most have said about iron.


Best to avoid iron if at all possible although a limited
contact may not be noticable or it may just give your
beer a "house" taste.
- -----------------------------
Yaaawn!. One gallon starters. Ooops, sorry Kyle.
Your calculations check out with recommended
pitching rates. However, I usually do about a gallon,
but in sequence and quart at a time when I am
starting up yeast for the first time. It's just easier
to handle and easier to chill in the fridge to knock
the yeast down.


Better is to not worry too much about this if you
are planning on using this yeast in the future and 


use a smaller starter ( say 1/2 gallon). This checks
 with Terry Foster's suggestion, as I recall.


After the first batch, capture the remains from
the secondary of a 5 gallon batch, wash it three
times with cold sterile water and store it under
sterile water in a capped beer bottle. You may have
to store it overnight in the fridge between washings
to keep most of the yeast, especially if it an ale yeast.
This will keep for months or years this way, 


if you keep it in the fridge ( properly labelled!)
Be sure to wake this yeast up with a starter
before you pitch it.


Frankly, you don't give up much with an all
grain batch just doing a smaller starter. It
is just with extract batches and added sugar
that low FAN can create problems, IMHO.


Keep on Brewin'

I keep hearing this momily, but it simply isn't true.  There are
plenty of kegs in 2, 2-1/2, and 3 gal. kegs available that easily fit
in a fridge w/o taking up too much room.  It's not necessary to always
keep the CO2 hooked up, so no drilling is required.  I usually only
have to top off the CO2 once or twice per keg.  So far my kegs haven't
noticed that they don't have their own special fridge, and the cheese
hasn't complained that the kegs are getting too much attention.

Subject: Zymurgy /infamous Bottle Opener Issue


During the recent HBD sabbatical, I was reading some back issues of
Zymurgy.  I came across the infamous bottle opener issue, and you know
what?  It really wasn't that bad.


For example, that issue had 125 pages vs 98 pages of the latest issue
(that's 27% more to you and me).  It had an interesting article by Jeff
Renner (of HBD fame) about baking bread using spent grain (Jeff is a
professional baker).  The advertising was better in regard to quality
and diversity.  And even the much-aligned story on bottle openers was
rather short, somewhat interesting and had some relevance to the brewing
experience.  I think their mistake was putting it on the cover.


I'm glad I am not it that business.  I think that it would be difficult
to come up with something new to say about brewing every other month and
still give it enough sizzle to sell magazines on the rack.  Although
Zymurgy-bashing is quite a popular sport on this medium, I still enjoy
it.

Hope to see you there!

Subject: Mini-kegs vs bottling


If I ever decide to quite homebrewing, it will be because of
bottling--especially now that I'm doing 10 gallon batches.  I'm
interested in mini-keg system because of the portability.


My question is, does the CO2 cartridge carbonate the beer or does it
just to push it out?  Whould I still need to prime with corn sugar?  If
so, do you use the same amount as when you bottle?


What's the opinion on the taps - plastic ($40)vs metal($70) as far as
value?  Is the same as the difference as in enamel vs stainless pots?


Thanks

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


I need Brewing Techniques Vol 1 #1, 4, 5, 6
                          Vol 2 #1, 2
                          Vol 4 #6


I have no idea who the varmint was that made off with them over the years,
but they're gone nonetheless. I'd surely like to have a complete
collection, too.


I have duplicates of Vol 2 #4, 5, 6
                     Vol 6 #5


Hey: I travel. Sometimes, you just can't wait until you get home, so you
pop into a brew store and buy what you already have several hunder miles
away. Anyway, if we're all gonna start trying to put our collections in
order, here's MY post. Anybody have what I need? Anyone want what I got?
Strike a trade?

See ya!

Hello!


Thank you to all who replied to my question about where I could obtain
cobalt blue beer bottles. I received two answers: Williams Brewing and St.
Patrick's of Texas. For those of you who are interested, St. Patrick's price
is less than half the Williams price! And you know what? That makes those
pretty blue bottles even prettier!


Thanks again!
Ed

Mark van Bommel,


I don't know what a hogshead equals but when
we made a 5 gal. batch of wheat with it, we steeped
8.5 oz. of berries for at least 20 min. at 160 deg.
then added that to the 2ndary fermenter and let sit for
about 10 days. Damn was that good ! Any comments
we got back from judges stated that they didn't know
how elderberry should taste but one said he could
detect a small peppery taste after swallowing.

Subject: Tube Bending


Bill Graham asked about ways of bending SS (and for that matter any kind of)
tubing.


Well, now you're talking about something that I am a hardened professional
on.  My profession is computer machine tools and I have worked on CNC tube
bending equipment for 15 years.   I have bent everything from soft copper to
aerospace titanium.


Keep the radius as large as you can.  SS if very hard and will wrinkle or
kink if the radius is too small.  Typically the best way to bend tubing
without flattening and without using expensive dies and machines it is to
fill it with some kind of granular material.  Sand is commonly used.  This
supports the tube and is easily removed after the tube is bent.  A second,
more obscure method is to fill the tube with water, plug the ends, and
freeze it to subzero (F) temperatures.  When the tubing is bent the ice
fractures and forms a granular material that will support the tube while it
is being bent.  For any level of quality this requires some tools and
preparation.  A round post (10 inch dia in your case with springback will
produce a radius of 11 to 12 inces) with a lever attached to the center that
will rotate around the entire circumference of the post.  A pin extends down
from the lever outside the circumference of the post and can be connected to
a second lever on the other end of the post for bending spirals.  This
supports a roller or a lubricated wiping die with a guiding slot cut into
it.  The roller or wiper slides up and down the post allowing it to track
the tube as it bends a spiral around the post.  The lever and the wiper pint
need to be metal. The wiper and bend post can be wood but the forces on the
wiper are substantial. .  You have to be able to disconnect the pin and
lever to remove the tube. You then clamp the end of tube to the post and go
to town. Bend a 360, move the tube through the clamp and do it again.  The
frozen water method is also a great way for bending tube in tube for counter
flow coolers  The inner tube needs some kind of support to center it prior
to freezing.  Don't you wish you had a name like Butros Butros-Ghali

Boy am I glad the HBD is back on line. Thanks to the Janitors.  I too am
starting a new job and my donation will be in the mail as soon as my
accountant (read wife) releases the check.  :^).


I will be in Tulsa, OK next week from Mon to Fri.  Any suggestions for a
great micro brew or just a great beer house?  This will be my last
professional jaunt for a while to come so I am going to make the best of it.
