Hello,


I'm looking to make a low or no alcohol all-grain beer... I've been
brewing for a number of years and have quite a bit of background in
brewing.  However, a friend who is mildly diabetic asked if I could brew
such a beer.


I suspect that in addition to brewing a high dextrin wort that I'd
either have to have a special yeast that could assimilate some sugars in
a cold respiration mode into some CO2 and some flavor compounds... Or, I
could brew & ferment a standard beer and then heat it to ~160F before
force carbonating to evaporate the alcohol.


If anyone has had any experience making beers as such, I'd be interested
to hear from you.

I'm busy trying to organize the proper components to set-up a 2-tier brewery
using converted Sanke kegs (HLT & BV) and a Polarware (MLT).  My question is
if the Polarware kettle (MLT) has a 3/8" ball valve should my keg also be
modified to have a 3/8" valve or could I use a 1/2"
valve?  Is there any restriction or benefit of either, especially since both
are going to be located on the upper level tier and my pump will
have to move liquids between the two vessels?




3/8" or 1/2" will make little difference other than the speed of flow.
Assuming a mag drive pump the key is to have more restriction on the
outflow side. this will prevent cavitation. If you want maximum flow (doubt
if you would need it), without cavitation and assuming a 1/2" pump inlet &
outlet you should use 1/2" full port valves on both inlet & outlet


Also, what about tubing diameter, I've got reinforced 1/2"?


Reiforced would work fine. If you use 1/2" with 3/8" valves you again will
have to insure the outflow is more restricted than the inflow

Subject: Re: Lagering


Steve Jones has problems with air and the contents of his airlock being
pulled back into the carboy at the end of the diacetyl rest when he's
chilling to lagering temps.


Several thoughts.  First, if you use a "triple ripple" air lock and fill it
no higher than midway on the lowest ball, it shouldn't pull any liquid
back.  Secondly, the diacetyl rest may not really be necessary - it depends
on the yeast.  Third, if you keg, you can run it into the keg at this point
and seal it, then release pressure during the lagering period if it becomes
excessive.  Forth, if you really manage the ferment and keep head space to
a minimum, the might be enough continuing gas production to keep positive
pressure.  This is tricky as you have noticed because as the green beer
gets colder, its capacity to hold dissolved CO2 increases and will likely
prevent any positive pressure.  However, if you have a bit of extract left
going into the lagering, which is proper, you might achieve this difficult
balancing act.


I myself don't use a diacetyl rest (which, of course, knocks out a bit of
dissolved CO2 itself since the beer can hold less at the warmer temp.).  I
most often run the beer into a keg and seal it at this point, then pressure
rack it off the sedimented yeast into the serving keg at the end of the
lagering.  This way it becomes naturally carbonated during the lagering.
Besides, it seems that lagering proceeds more quickly under pressure.  Of
course, you have to make sure you don't have too much extract left when you
seal it.  If bottle bombs are no joke, imagine what a keg bomb would be!
Sometimes I just leave it on the yeast if it's not going to be moved and
will be consumed quickly.

Subject: oxidation in Kegs, filling piggies


Rick,


Do you purge the air out of your kegs before filling them? If not, leaving this
large of head space can intoduce enought O2 to the beer to bring out stale
cardboarding flavors, much quicker than necessary. I fill my kegs with Idophor
water and push it from one keg to another, thus leaving the keg full of CO2 and
sanitized. Before use it tip it upside down and use a key to depress the air
valve. that will blast out any water left after drying.


Tip #2


I counter pressure fill my piggies too! It takes either a #13 or #11 stopper
(Special Order) Ill have to look. It is a 2 person job though. Its really
difficult to maintain the pressure and keep the CPBF from popping off the keg,
but with practice and a thick glove its ok. (it takes a while, and my hand gets
cold)  I also put an extender of platic tubing on the fill tube of the filler. I
also use the CO2 tank to pop pig bag inside. Just insert the air in stem of the
bulb into your co2 line and tighten with a hose clamp. usually about 20psi will
give you the little Pop! your looking for.  Again on the oxidation thing, burp
your piggy right away to expell any air that may have been trapped during
assebmly.

The recent discussion of prickly pear mead has me interested in trying one.
I saw a lot of prickly pear with ripe fruit in west Texas the first week of
September when I was hunting there but did not have any pliers with me for
picking or a suitable container for holding them without getting the stickers
all over me and the inside of my son's Explorer.  I don't think he or his
family would have appreciated the later.  I have a neighbor with some prickly
pear which bore a lot of fruit last year and thought I would ask him if I could
have it this year if I had a good recipe.  Dick Dunn wrote of making pp mead
and I wondered if he would share a recipe?  He also wrote:

Was the juice first extracted cooked, too?  How did you cook the fruit?  With
added water or the first extracted juice?

Subject: lagering and suckback


collective homebrew conscience_


steve jones asked how to prevent contraction of the carboy headspace from
sucking airlock liquid into the carboy during the cooldown from diacetyl
rest to lagering.


unless you can provide some means of positive mass flow to the headspace,
via a second hole in your stopper (and a co2 source, for example), maybe you
should consider not installing an airlock, or just continue using treated
water and ethanol, as you say you already do.  if you have kegs, you could
also transfer the beer to the keg at this point to start the lagering.


i usually totally remove the airlock and replace it with plastic wrap that's
been sprayed with a 70% ethanol/30% water mixture.  then i rubber band it
over the top of the carboy, after purging the carboy headspace with co2 and
spraying the ethanol mix around the outside of the neck of the 'boy.  after
the carboy has come to equilibrium at a colder temperature, the plastic wrap
sometimes shows the volume contraction by being very slightly "sucked into"
the opening.  i normally include a boiled piece of aluminum foil over the
top of the plastic wrap, just as a second physical barrier.  it's never been
necessary, so far.


alternatively, you could construct a "bigger" airlock, by running a length
of tubing from the top of the carboy to a bowl of sanitizer solution.  this
could be a smaller hose attached to the inner tube of an airlock, for
example.  but, before you do this, consider how you will guarantee the
relative sterility of the air inside the tubing.  ideally you would be able
to purge it with co2, or you would have enough co2 outgassing at the moment
it is installed to dilute its contents.  a dual-drilled stopper is a great
thing to have when it comes to purging carboys with co2.


or, you may figure that at lagering temps, a few cc's of unfiltered air
isn't going to do much damage, since the beer is going to be at such low
temperatures from that point until it is served.


by the way, those of you who are using no sanitizer in your airlocks should
consider how sanitary that approach is, after active fermentation is over
and gas production stops.  ethanol is pretty cheap when you contemplate the
miniscule amount needed to protect 5 gallons of your hard-earned brew.


i personally feel that if you've done everything right up to the point where
you're ready to lager the beer, and it's going to stay cold from that point
until it's served, you've got to screw up pretty badly to end up with a
final product that's noticeably infected or oxidized.

I am brewing a Dunkelweiss. The OG was 1.054. I used Whitelabs WLP 300
pitched at 70 degrees. It had a lag time of 22 hours. The first day the temp
stayed about 70 to 72 degrees. The naxt morning the wife covered it because
the temp was down to 65 degrees. I got the temp back up to 70 to 72 degrees.
The next couple of days the temp got up to 74 to 76 degrees. Will this
excessive temp be a problem?
Also, I racked to my secondary when the fermentation had slowed and the
fermentation has slowed to almost nothing. The SG at racking to secondary
was 1.030. With this strain of yeast should I just leave it in one fermenter
for the whole duration of the fermentation and bottle or should I use a
secondary?

My experience has been that in order for my pump to work the way I need
it to, I have 1/2" on everything on the inlet side of
the pump, and 3/8" on the outlet side of the pump.  Actually, I throttle
the pump with a 1/2" ball valve attached directly to the
outlet but I reduce it to 3/8" immediately.  When I first set everything
up, I had 1/2" throughout and found that the pump
would not build sufficient pressure on the outlet side to turn my sparge
arm consistently.  Just my personal experience...
Everyone's setup and methods are different so YMMV.

It is 'nearly' impossible and definitely impractical for a homebrewer to

I'm sure you can think up many reasons why such a set-up might
potentially not work, especially when you've never actually tried it,
but I prefer to keep an open mind and find ways I can make it a
workable reality.  3 gal kegs are readily available, don't take up as
much space as you imagine, and don't cost nearly as much as you think
(who pays $75 for a used soda keg?!!).  2 and 2.5 gal kegs are harder
to come by, but a request to your local shop owner to keep an eye out
for some would likely produce surprising results.  Once you have them,
their lifespan is virtually infinite.  I have 2 kegs in my fridge and
plenty of room for food and drink (including bottled beer) for two
people, one of whom doesn't drink more than an occasional sip.  I'm
glad you're happy with your mini-kegs or bottles, or whatever you're
using, but just because you've never tried something doesn't mean it
won't work.  Why would you try to persuade someone against something
when you have no experience with it?

entered them into SUDS 4.0 and the IBU's are coming up way low.  I am
assuming this is some glitch in the program because I can see no reason for
this drop off in IBU's, the gravity of the wort is the same, the boil time
and temperature are the same.  but this got me to thinking.  Can I simply
multiply my existing recipes by 12 to get a 60 gallon batch?


Thanks

Hello brewers, brewsters and Dave Burley....
Just wanted to point you to those with access to the above brew.
Unbeleeeeevable!  Its an ESB, dry hopped and I love it.  Open a bottle and
the hops aroma hits you....hard.  Unfortunately, I have no affiliation with
the brewery except.....well support your local brewery and this one too.
Keep on brewing!

Greetings Brews Brothers


I love my 3gal kegs. I rack into a 5g keg with priming sugar and transfer to 
a 3g keg and bottle the rest. A 10" piece of racking cane fits in the 
cobrahead spigot and makes for easy bottling (oxymoron). Also, for keg to keg 
racking place racking cane piece between the two cobraheads, tap the kegs, 
open spigots and voila, nice and easy,counterpressure transfer.


I also have balanced the freezer/fridge temp to accomplish 68f in the fridge 
and 40f in the freezer. You get the picture, fermenters in the fridge, 3gal 
keg in the freezer (sideways,out tube down) for serving through the tap in 
the side of the fridge. Easy.


On my spray nozzle on my sink, I cut the hose, inserted a T fitting with an 
out corny fitting attached. This makes for easy filling of a keg with water 
or rinsing a keg turned upsidedown in the sink. Just plug on the fitting and 
turn on the water.  


I had an extra gott 10g water cooler (aka: mashtun) that I rigged an out 
fitting and tube to the factory spigot, dropped in  a full and ready to drink 
3g keg, ice and small co2 tank and regulator (i use an old oxynater tank and 
regulator charged with 100psi co2 for dispensing-it takes 2 tanks to empty a 
3g keg). This setup makes for a great tailgate party. Who would guess it were 
fresh homebrew pouring from this construction style water cooler. When people 
first see this setup, they think i just poured beer in and it is gravity 
feeding out the spigot. NOT. Easy portability.


As you can see my vote goes to the trusty soda keg.


Did I use the word "easy" too much?


May all your racks be o2 free!!

Hi all,


Boy, am I glad the HBD is back! That was like having to quit smoking
cold turkey (again). What are you supposed to do with your hands while
you're at work??? ;^} Many thanks again to our esteemed janitors for
their efforts in getting the server back up and running.


I'm planning to make my first attempt at a Bohemian style pilsner this
coming weekend (10/17). I'd like for this to be fairly close to style,
plus, I went to a bit of trouble to obtain some Czech Moravian Pils malt
and imported Saaz. Never having tasted the genuine article (in good
condition), I have little to go on aside from the published style
guidelines.


BTW, did anyone ever submit questions to/get answers from the Doc Pivo
"ask the Czech master brewer" thing? Not wanting to ask "how on earth do
you brew a Czech beer?", I emailed a request to be copied on responses
to submitted questions, but never received anything.
 
Here's the recipe I'm considering for a 5 gallon batch:


9# Czech Moravian Pilsner malt
Decoction mash:
  20' `at` 140F
  90' `at` 154F
  10' `at` 168F
70 minute boil:
  2 oz 3.9% AA Czech Saaz - FWH
  1 oz 3.9% AA Czech Saaz - 30'
  1 oz 3.9% AA Czech Saaz - 10'
Wyeast 2278, 2 gallon starter


OG 1.050 (85% efficiency)
FG 1.015 (per guidelines)
43 IBUs (ProMash)
3.4 SRM (ProMash)


Some of my questions/assumptions:


1. With a 100% Pils grist, I'm concerned about maintaining proper body
in the finished beer. The published attenuation for 2278 is 70-74%. My
experience is toward or beyond the high end of the range with any given
strain, thus my concern for over attenuation. I need to keep it around
70%. Will a 154F sacc temp suffice, or is a higher temperature
indicated? Lose the 140F rest, maybe? What about the addition of some
carapils?


2. Any comments on my proposed hop schedule from the experienced Pils
brewers? 43 IBUs is over the upper limit per BJCP guidelines (40), but
within the upper limit of AHA guidelines (45). (I'm not afraid of the
style police, but these guidelines and a distant memory of stale, light
struck PU are all I have to go on here...)


3. In my experience with decoction mashing, 90% of the flavor benefits
are obtained from the first decoction, 9% from the second and 1%
(negligible) from the third. A triple is out of the question, and I
wonder if there is any point in a double. Comments? I'm really only
interested in flavor contribution from the decoction; the (slight)
increase in extraction efficiency from multiples just isn't worth the
time and effort, IMHO.


4. This will also be my first time to use 2278. I know that a small
amount of diacetyl is desirable in this style. So, should a D-rest be
employed? What about fermentation temps?  Wyeast mentions in their
product description that a small amount of sulfur is produced during
fermentation, but dissipates with lagering. I assume the normal 8 weeks
lagering at 32F is appropriate.


5. My water is very hard and high in carbonate. For this style, I think
it would be better to go with distilled water and adjust with mineral
salts. Has anyone treated distilled or RO water to approximate a
Pilsen-type profile? If so, I would appreciate hearing about how you did
it and what the result was. Any experience using Calistoga mineral water
for this style?


Sorry for the long post (read: "how on earth do you brew a Czech
beer?"). All info, including individual data points, will be
appreciated. Private email is fine.


TIA, and Cheers!

I started with 3/8 tubing and reasoned that 3/8 ball valves would be just
fine.  However, finding ball valves with 3/8 inch ID proved very difficult.
Half inch ball valves seem to revel in using 3/8 or less openings.  I'm now
trying to use 1/2 inch copper pipe and 5/8 inch valves that have a 1/2 inch
opening.  The imported valves seem to have the smallest openings.  The
domestic, if you can find them, are much closer to the line ID.


Cost is certainly a factor and might force your decisions.  I recommend
welding 3/4 couplings, or what ever they are called, to the keg.  This way,
you'll never be sorry for choosing a small size that you can't change.
