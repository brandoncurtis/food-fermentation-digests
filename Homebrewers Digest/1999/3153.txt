Subject: Hunter Thermostat & Mag. Stirrer


                                Hi all,


I am having trouble setting my Hunter thermostat.  I 
use it mostly for ales at 65F, but now I want to 
drop the temp to 50-55 for a lager.  Every time I 
reset the temp, it reverts back to 65F.  Perhaps this 
is a sign from the gods not to brew the lager, or I 
am missing something ;-).  I have even tried taking 
out the battery out so there is no memory and still 
no luck!




I would really like to make a mag. stirrer.  Can I 
make one with a computer fan and a dimmer 
switch?  How do you know if a dimmer will work 
fine or damage a spinning device? 


TIA

Dave, you are correct. A magnetic stirrer won't work if you are using a
cider jug with a concave bottom. I use 2L Erlenmeyer flasks. Besides
compatibility with a stirrer, another advantage to lab flasks, at least
Pyrex ones, is that you can boil the starter wort and pitch the yeast in the
same vessel, which virtually assures you are pitching into sterile wort. The
down side is they are expensive. A 2L flask costs about $15. Four liter
flasks, at least in the catalogs I have, cost over $50. (The main reason why
I've never bothered to buy one.)

Yes, I think it would be a problem, the magnet would wiggle wildly all over
the place, loose coupling and get stuck in some dead zone.  You could just
buy an Erlenmeyer flask, but if you just cannot, you might try a coffee pot,
he squat fat kind you see in doughnut shops, etc.  It has a flat bottom, a
nice plastic high temperature handle, and is made of pyrex (could this be a
poor man's flask?).

Because they don't fit easily into standard 24-bottle cases.  When
you're dealing with hundreds (or for some large comps over 1000)
bottles, having a uniform bottle size can tremendously simplify
handling them.

This is very similar to a portable keg cooler that I built for use on an
annual fishing trip with the guys. I placed two corneys in an ice chest and
filled it with water up to about an inch from the top. I placed a small
submersible pump (the smallest I could find at the local hardware and garden
center - they sell them for fountains) in the chest and connected it via
plastic tubing to a coil of 3/8 inch copper tubing. I just bought a 25 foot
coil and left it coiled the way it came. I placed the coil in a second small
ice chest (one of those over the shoulder types) with a half gallon plastic
milk jug of frozen water and fill the chest with water to cover the coil. I
carved a foam plastic lid for the small chest with a notch for the tubes to
exit from a chunk of 2 inch foam insulation.


I use a Johnson Controls fridge controller to cycle the pump to maintain the
desired temperature. I just put the temp probe right in the water with the
kegs. Yeah, I know it's not supposed to be submersible but I only use it
this way for a few days a year. Its been several years now with no problems
 - if I were building a lagering system I would either coat the probe with
something to protect it or buy a controller with a submersible probe.


Since it is a temporary setup I just throw an old sleeping bag over the top
to help insulate the system a bit better. Sometimes I start off with a block
of ice instead of the jug since it tends to make better thermal contact with
the coil and gets the whole system down to temp quicker - You do have to be
careful about overflows, though. Once the system is at the desired
temperature (usually 50 - 54 degrees F for serving), it holds very nicely on
two jugs of ice a day at about 12 hour intervals. I just cycle the jugs
between the cooler and the freezer.


A system like this for lagering would avoid any fridge/freezer modifications
as well as concerns about the coolant water freezing in the tube when it is
not being circulated. It's really not hard to maintain but it does take a
little discipline to change the ice jugs regularly.

Subject: RE: Lagering Idea


The question of whether you could put a cooling coil in your freezer
and circulate cooling water to cool beer for lagering came up over the
weekend.  After checking some numbers, here's some guestimations on
what kind of cooling action you'll get.
Assuming your freezer is at 0 deg F, and you stick a 25 foot coil of
copper tubing (3/8" O.D) in there, and you circulate the water at 2
gallons/minute (easily achievable by a small submersible pump), I get
a temperature drop of (15 minutes of calculations later...) 1/2 a degree F.
Whoops!  The heat transfer coefficient between the air (even forced air)
and the tube is so poor that there is hardly any heat transferred from
the freezer to the water in the tube.  Looking at the coeffients for water,
if you had the coil immersed in (liquid) water at 32 deg F, you could
easily drop the temperature from about 60 F down to 32 with a 25 foot
length of tubing.  Heat transfer from air is almost 300 _times_ slower
than transfer from water.  Hope this helps,

Well, putting the coil in cold water/ice will definitely increase the heat
transfer.


>I would try a finned automotive heater core, or air conditioner core, and
>probably would not need the fan in the fridge.


Either of these suggestions will increase the surface area available for
heat transfer, which will lower the temperature of the water coming out of
the freezer.  I'd use a fan in any case.

 I don't know about the hop tea, but minimizing the boil can't be 
good. The boil does a lot of stuff for your beer besides exracting 
the alpha acids. . . drives off DMS, sanitizes the wort, precipitates 
proteins . . . etc.


I used to brew on the stove and what I did was fold up a couple of 
metal hangers to sit on the element under the brew pot. It worked 
well for me. It didn't eliminate the carmelization, but it did 
minimize it.

Hi all.


If you want to achieve a given level of hop aroma, would you use the same
quantity of pellets and whole hops? It seems to me that a given quantity of
pellets would produce a more intense aroma because the cones have been
"crushed" a little more...does that seem reasonable?
