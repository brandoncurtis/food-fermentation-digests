Subject: Bottles for competitions


Why are competitions so strict about the type of bottles entered and do not
want flip top (or other sizes)?  Well if you ever organize a competition of
any size you would realize immediately the problem.  With a 200 entry
competition (medium size) and 3 bottles per entry, that's 600 bottles, or 25
cases.  If you get nice case boxes to put bottles into, what you find
immediately is that all the odd sized bottles don't fit so you try to put
them all in an odd case lot but then the entries aren't necessarily in the
right order so it's hard for the stewards to find the desired entries.   And
the cases don't stack well if there are any tall bottles.  This is usually a
problem with limited cold room space.   Additionally, if there only a few of
the odd bottle shapes, sizes, etc. then they don't necessarily remain
anomymous when the bottles are brought to the table for judging.  This is a
key tenet to judging fairness.  So, do everyone a favor and bottle at least
some of your beer in 12oz, brown bottles for entry into competitions or keg
and counter pressure bottle some.  Good luck.

I mulch over the base all summer long, and then put my leaves over them in
the fall. Once the bine have sufficiently dried out (usually between
November and January here in Michigan, I break the bines from the crown
(level with the ground) and remove them from the fence. They then become
rather aromatic starters for the fireplace (unless you're a lot better at
harvesting all the hops than I am...). The key is to get the old bines off
and out of the way before the spring sprouting - which takes place under
ground a lot earlier than you might expect. It's not so much WHEN it gets
done as much as it is THAT it gets done. Not removing the bines and
allowing the next generation to grow over them makes for a rather
unmanageable mess come harvest time.

Subject: Cider recipies


Someone asked about cider recipes:


I am by no means an expert (this is my first batch) but this is how I made
mine this year. This method is essentially my Granddad's, just a little
cleaner.


First we picked apples, using about 60% Golden Delicious and 40% Jonathan.
This mixture of sweet and tart apples was recommended by a little pamphlet
I found. I wish I could tell you the name, but I have misplaced it. I can
say that the GD apples were sweet and bland, and the Jonathan's had an
amazing tart flavor, hands down everyone's favorite to swill (which we did
a lot of during the press). We let them "sweat" (sit) for a week to soften
them, pressed (I am lucky to have a friend with an awesome press), and
poured into sanitized 35 gallon food grade garbage pails. We pitched a
gallon of raging starter made with unpasturized apple juice and champagne
yeast. In total, we made 36 gallons of cider!! It seemed as if a garbage
pail full of apples made about 5-7 gallons of juice, depending on variety.
We had no idea we were going to end up with so much juice, and had to
scramble for secondary fermenters. When we racked from primary to secondary
after about a week, it was so good that we set aside a couple of gallons
and drank it. Incredible! So tasty even little children and the elderly
would chug it! In fact, one carboy is getting a little low from repeated
attacks.


We did no campden tablets, or anything like that, and so far the cider
tastes completely clean. It may not be stable for long periods, but that's
OK, as it ain't gonna last that long. The juice had an OG a little over
1060, and we didn't want to add anything to boost the sugar level, as this
project was a "good enough fer Granddad, good enough fer me" kind of a
thing. One of my brew partners works at a noted champagne vintners, and we
are going to take some and do it "method champagnois", which should be fun,
although I must say I prefer going "au natural".


In total right now, I have 30 odd gallons of cider and 45 gallons of beer
on hand! Are we set for the holidays or what?!! My brew partners and I have
taken to calling ourselves "The Barons of Beverage". Yeah!!

Subject: Mystery Mash Temps


I've been experimenting with partial grain mashes (~ 5 lbs. of grain) in my
last couple batches and have noticed a strange phenomenon. When the mash
reaches an optimal temperature between 150-160 degrees F, it will hold this
temp (absolutely rock steady +/- <  1 degree) with no added heat for over an
hour with the pot sitting on a cold countertop. When I added small amounts
of cold water to thin the mixture a little, the temp dropped briefly and
returned to its original level. This does not make thermodynamic sense
unless the enzymatic reactions are generating their own heat. For you all
with the biochemistry background, are these reactions exothermic?

It was a good question from the theoretical side, but honestly, don't dry

I have found the Airstat modification from the 1994 HBD archives.
Now, I'd like to modify mine to hold a temp of something in the range
of 100F to 110F (not for homebrewing, unfortunately!)


The Airstat setpoint only goes up to 90F and the article in the archives 
doesn't have quite enough info about the thermistor for me figure it out.


If anyone has the specs on the Airstat thermistor, I'd appreciate a copy.
Or just the value of the resistor needed, but it would be nice to see the
math!

I have managed to use my magnetic stirrer in the bottom of a 'cider' jug,
but
it is an exercise in frustration... last time I took a shot at it, I gave
up.


Regarding boiling in Erlenmeyers... how do you guys manage to control the
boil?  The one time I tried it, I got periodic explosions of bubbles/foam
instead of  a steady boil.  This caused boil-over problems that I could not
prevent.  I'm assuming that the reason for this was the very smooth bottom
of the flask not providing enough nucleation sites for bubbles.  How do you
add boiling stones without disrupting the stir bar, though?

Subject: Re: Stove top beer


I brewed in a thin enameled steel 33 qt. kettle on a #&*#`at`! electric stove
and had no trouble with scorching, even with very pale beers such as CAP,
EXCEPT when I first started 25 years ago a didn't turn off the burner after
the water came to a boil and I added liquid malt extract.  In those first
two or three brews the syrup settled down on the bottom of the kettle and
scorched.  I had a burnt flavor and little bleack flakes in the beer.  If
you are extract brewing you should always turn off the heat before adding
malt extract and not turn it on again until you've stirred it thoroughly
and it is all in solution.


The stainless steel top of two stoves never recovered from the big kettle
reflecting heat, however, and I'm still in the doghouse on that.  Covering
the stove top with aluminum foil helps but not entirely.  I now use a
propane fired three vessel (10 gallon aluminum stock pots) RIMS in the
garage, which makes for two happier people in the household.

Subject: Hop substitution question


I'm due to make a batch of David Brockington's Sister
Star of the Sun IPA, and I'd like some opinions on hop
substitution.


Here's the recipe:


13# Hugh Baird English Pale malted barley 
1/4# Hugh Baird 135L crystal malt 
1/4# Great Western malted wheat 
3 oz Chinook hops (60 minutes) 
2 oz East Kent Golding hops (15 minutes) 
2 oz imported Fuggle hops (while chilling) 
1 tsp. Irish Moss (`at`30 minute mark) 
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale), pint starter. 
(http://hbd.org/brewery/cm3/recs/01_114.html)


In previous batches, I've cut down the Chinook in this


recipe to 2 oz.  I don't mind purchasing the hops
called for, but I'd
like to use some of what I have on hand: 5 1/2 oz of
Cascade, 1/2 oz Nugget.


My thoughts:
For the 2 oz Chinook, buying 1 1/2 Chinook and adding
my 1/2 Nugget
For the EK Goldings, 2 oz Cacade
Buy the Fuggles


Any suggestions?
TIA!

The moisture is so low that there is effectively no freezing.  As a matter
of fact, storing in the freezer is the recommended method for storing dry
yeast.

work provided you don't get the rpms too high.  I have used a 1 gallon
hplc solvent bottle for years.

Subject: Caramel flavor AND bottle styles for competition


I, too, crave the caramel flavor for some of my recipies, but have not
perfected it as of late. My question concerns a product I found on the
shelf of the local homebrew shop, named Caramalt... [  I think this is
the name, and believe it is made by Morgans ]  It looks like it would
considerably raise the color srm thing, so it may slant some styles the
wrong way.  Will it work for the flavor?
- --  Also, a question for all the judgie-wudgies out there;  Would your
score be influenced by an entry in a McEwen's brown 12-oz bottle for a
Scotch Ale sub-type?


Prosit!
