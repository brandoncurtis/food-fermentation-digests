I am not a microbiologist, nor do I play one on T.V. so take the following
comments with several grains of salt.


I would think that this advice would be very good for a microbrewer or pub
brewer who would be attempting a pLambic. It would be nearly impossible to get
every nook and cranny clean and disinfected. However, we homebrewers can give
all our equipment a soak in a good, strong bleach solution which should take
care of most anything. I probably would be leery of using a corny keg for
pLambic because the poppets and such would be difficult to clean--can anyone
chime in on this one?


I have found it interesting that we are warned so strongly about brett or pedio
infections in our "regular" beers, yet it is difficult to keep the wee beasties
alive when attempting a pLambic. My plan right now, FWIW, is to keep my five
gallon carboy forever dedicated as a pLambic fermenter. When I bottle this
batch (whenever that might be) I'll just dump out the majority of the jetsam
and rack the new pLambic on to the rest of the leftover yeast / bacteria.

Subject: HOP TEA, 100% Ashburne Malt ESB


     Jeff Woods asks about HOP TEA additions.
     
     I "dry hop" with hop teas.  What I do is take my one or two hop plugs 
     (not whole, not pellets, plugs!) and add about a cup and a half of 
     water, place them in a sauce pan, place on the stove with cover on low 
     heat, and wait for the stuff to boil.  I then add the whole soggy mess 
     to my secondary, most of the hops float and when I keg, they remain 
     behind when a racking cane with one of those red plastic caps is used. 
      Anyway, I feel that this works for me in several ways:
     
     1. It apparently speeds up the process of infusing beer with hop 
     flavor and aroma.  I get good results in one week at 40-45F while my 
     yeast crashes in the fridge.
     
     2.  The hop flavor is less "grassy" more like a really good late 
     hopping flavor BUT with really good AROMA!
     
     I have not really noticed it, there is probably an increase in 
     bitterness in the finished product.  
     
     To this I would like to add some comments about dry hopping and Czech 
     Pils.  A few short weeks ago there was some discussion about how 
     (im)proper dry hopping is for that style, and the insistence of some 
     that is was inappropriate because "Pilsner Urquell does not dry hop... 
     I was there yadda yadda yadda...."  Now I have NEVER been to the Czech 
     Republic or anywhere across the big pond, but I would have to add that 
     it is the TASTE of the beer that is important, not the TECHNIQUE used 
     to achieve it.  I know of several beers I have had that had phenomenal 
     hop flavor and aroma, that were not dry hopped, they have a hop back, 
     whirlpool, etc. in the brewery and achieve the hop profile without dry 
     hopping.  A homebrewer might achieve the same EFFECT by dry hopping, 
     and if so, what's the deal?  I am a big proponent of learning about 
     and using traditional methods and materials, but I am also one who 
     will let the beer do the talking!
     
     As far as the 100% Briesse Ashburne malt ESB, I just kegged it!  So 
     far the beer is very good, there is a "different" kind of maltiness 
     than I am used to, normally I add 10-20% Munich in addition to Briesse 
     Pale Ale malt for a kick in malt.  The ESB is "dryer" than my normal 
     beer, but with using a different yeast (Wyeast American Ale#2) I 
     achieved a 71% apparent attenuation which is not overly dry, I think 
     that the beer is just less malty/sweet and more malty/toasty that my 
     usual.  This beer, although good is probably flawed due to a pH 
     adjustment I mad on my sparge water, which I STUPIDLY did without the 
     aid of a pH meter..... (I should have known better....) anyway, the 
     beer is somewhat acidic.  Now this could very well be from yeast, the 
     first wort hopping schedule I used (which I think adds a hop flavor 
     that is somewhat acidic)  Anyway, the malt flavor is very up front and 
     subtle, I guess I am really going to have to do this again and more 
     carefully.  Say... another 6g of beer... Okay!

Jeff Woods requested info on feeding his hop addiction - looking for
flavour without bitterness.


I have found that using First Wort Hopping gives you the flavour.  See
http://brewery.org/library/1stwort.html for more info.


Using a Hop Back also increases the aroma.  Try searching the archives for
"hopback" OR "hop back".

Subject: HERMS Plans


I have seen some discussion on HERMS systems.  (I forget exactly what
"HERMS" stands for, except that "RM"  means "recirculating mash.")  My
understanding is that wort is pumped through a heat excahanger in the hot
liquor tank as an alternative to using an electric heating element in the
traditional RIMS set up.  This is supposed to prevent scorching of the wort
and provide other advantages which I have forgotten.  Sounds like a great
idea, but I haven't seen any pictures or specs.  I'm sure someone has posted
details on these set ups.  Does anyone know of any Web sites that include
HERMS plans?


TIA

Subject: Methods for dry hopping in your serving keg


Hello HBDers.


I've tried a few methods for dry hopping in my (3 gallon) serving kegs. I
thought I'd share these as well as inquire about other methods. The impetus
for my experimentation was to achieve a nice fresh hop aroma without having
to secondary the beer and dry hop there...


Both of these methods involve adding hops to the keg and putting some sort
of "filter" over the bottom of the intake tube:


First, I took one of those plastic "chore boys" and placed it around the
bottom of the intake tube. (Basically, I forced the intake tube into it
until it pierced the chore boy, so the bottom of the tube ended up being in
the center of the chore boy.) I then added about half an ounce of Spalt
*pellets* to each keg. The aroma was nice, but the chore boy did not do an
adequate job of filtering out the pellets, as those things are very fine
once they hit the liquid.


My second attempt appears more successful. This time, I took a (2" x 2")
piece of aluminum screen (like the kind you get at the hardware store) and
wrapped it around the end of the dip tub, "crimping" it with my fingers.
Then, I added half an ounce of Goldings *leaf hops* to each keg. So far, all
is well. Although the aroma hasn't come through too much yet (I did this
yesterday), there are no hops coming through. Even after a day in the keg,
the beer is approaching clarity.


In summary, I strongly recommend the second method and welcome any
additional input/comments/ideas...

Subject: Are brewers being marginalized by Winemakers?




Here in Ottawa within the last 2 years the brew stores have less-and-less
beer stuff, and more and more wine stuff.  3 years ago when I moved here
when the brewstores put out their quarterly sales fliers, 60% roughly of
the stuff on sale was beer stuff.  Now it's more like 20%.  The
mega-bookstore
in town Chapters used to have a beer section that was 3 and almost 4 shelves
in size.  Now it's only less than 1 shelf, and wine takes up about 5
shelves.


Maybe it's just because of the onslaught of wine-on-premise, I don't know.
There is now even a "co-op" wine-on-premise here in town where you
walk in the door, make a wine, then bottle someone else's batch from a
month ago, and walk out the door.  A month later someone else comes
in and bottles yours.


Is this happening everywhere, or is it just here in Ottawa?


cheers,
 -Alan

Doug,


>Is there any reason not to use thermocouple wire to make my own bi-metal

I'm behind on my reading.  I've been using K type TC's.  I've been using
a Fluke meter.  I have also put together a RIMS controller that I have not
yet used.  It's based on Watlow PID controller and also uses K-type TC's.
I do not use a temp well, just dunk the TC in the mash or boil.  For my
RIMS I built a fitting that is unique.  I use a T fitting with a 3/8"
compression fitting on one leg.  I used a 000 stopper and cut it so that
it would fit in the compression fitting.  The nut from the compression
fitting helps hold the stopper from blowing out when pressurised.  I then
pushed the TC thru the rubber.  Worked in a static test but I've yet to
test it in the actual (dynamic) RIMS.


I don't see a problem with TC's.  I just think that they're not used more
because people don't know about them.

Subject: Sweet Potato Aroma


I am planning to make a sweet potato lager soon, and my girlfriend insists 
that it will be pointless without that wonderful aroma of freshly roasted 
sweet potatoes in the finished beer.  The trick is to keep this aroma and 
still get the starchy tubers through a full mash and boil.  I am thinking 
that a full-blown triple decoction and relatively short boil will probably 
do the trick to some extent.  Does anybody have any experience or 
conjectures on how to accomplish this?

Jon - I'm not sure about "the exception to the rule" - but overall my
experience is that you need fewer grams of pellets to achieve the
degree of hoppyness - in contrast to whole hops (and I would suspect
to some degree plugs). The reason is that the hop oils are more
available, due to the rupture of the oil glands when the hops are
processed into plugs. I don't have hard analytical data to back this
up - but it could be fodder for another pale ale experiment (are you
listening in John Varady?).
