If you let your equipment completely dry after using the 1 Tbs. per gallon
of bleach then you won't have the "hypochlorite blues".  Even though this
will work, It is much easier to use a 12.5 PPP solution of Iodophor and not
rinse.  If you drain or shake off the excess Iodophor off of your equipment,
I guarantee that you will not be able to taste it in your beer.


If you don't believe me, make up a 12.5 PPM solution of Iodophor (approx.
3ml of 1.6% TT iodine Iodophor) and add a tablespoon of it to a pint of your
favorite home-brew.  Try it side by side.  Note: this is obviously overkill
as far as the amount of iodine you could actually get into your whole batch
if you empty or shake off the excess.  Not only that, if you wait a few
minutes after removing the equipment from the Iodophor, much of the
available iodine will evaporate leaving you with even less.  (Solid iodine
crystals will actually sublimate at room temperature)

Subject: Whirlpooling the wort


I have read the discussion on the chore boy and scrubbie problems and would
like to comment.
I don't use any screen and I don't siphon.  I just whirlpool the stuff and
drain the kettle slowly (but not THAT slowly).  I typically drain 16 gallons
in 20 to 25 minutes (and when I used a 15.5 gal keg as a boiling kettle, I
drained at about the same rate).  One to Two gallons a minute is pretty slow
and won't bother the trub and pelletized hop residue concentrated in the
middle of the kettle.
I will admit that if you use leaf hops, you may need to use a scrubbie to
eliminate the small percentage of hops that will still migrate through the
drain.  However, this still seems like a better way to decant the beer from
the kettle.  Siphoning -- always seemed more trouble than it's worth (and
kinda dangerous).  Not to say that it can't be done and done well.  If you
already have a drain at the bottom of your kettle, stir your wort, let it
stop spinning, and drain it out of the kettle as slow as you need to leave
the sediment undisturbed.

Hi,


About dry ice. I once tried to carbonate my beer in swingtop bottles with
dry ice. It was like (I think, never been there; maybe next year) Cape
Kennedy!  That's because dry ice (solid carbondioxyde at minus 62.2  degrees
F) rapidly starts boiling in contact with fluid.
If dry ice contains benzene (carcinogen) or other contaminations, depends on
the source (you have to ask the supplier).

I've had very good results racking beer on to fruit in the secondary.  I've 
brewed peach & cranberry ales.  I freeze the fruit as you mentioned, let it 
thaw, and stuff it into the secondary.  I haven't sulfited and haven't 
noticed any ill effects (one of my peach beers made it to the second round of 
the AHA competition).  The person who wrote about racking hot wort onto fruit 
should don his flame proof suit and get ready for all the postings about HSA.


It's been awhile since I've been in New Orleans, so I don't know if it's 
still there, but I highly recommend the Crescent City Brew Pub.


Speaking of recommendations, I have a Schmidling non-adjustable Malt Mill and

Subject: Unusual ferment


Jack Straw was concerned about his unusual experience of his ferment
crawling out of the carboy, Well don't worry, be happy because your yeastie
beasties are!  Before I ever stepped up my yeast and just pitched straight
from the smack pack, I only had one batch do this in 4 years of brewing.  I
started stepping up my yeast to 1qt starters and it happedned about half of
the time....hmmm more yeast mass maybe?  Then, I got one of those stainless
steel oxygenating stones and some pure O2 and started dosing the freshly
chilled wort with about 10 seconds of pure O2 and so far EVERY batch crawls
out through the blow off tube (in conjuction with stepping up the yeast).  I
made a 'lawnmower' mild ale this summer with an OG of 1.032 and it was done
in primary in 2 days and I was drinking it on day 7!  I never say a complete
ferment happen so fast.   So, I guess the moral of the story is that it
helps a lot to do both of those things and Jack need not worry.

Peter, welcome to the wonderful world of top fermenting yeast!  That
caulk-like substance is pure yeast.  Ain't it wonderful?  For years, back
when all we could get was dry yeast, I always wondered what top fermenting
meant.  Then when the first fresh or "liquid" yeasts became available, I
found out, as you now have.  Traditional ale yeasts rise to the top of the
fermenting beer, some more strongly than others.  The ones I use most often
generally rise to form a pretty solid pancake on the third day (sounds
vaguely symbolic, doesn't it?) after pitching.  I ferment 8 gallons in a
covered 10 gallon stock pot (the same one I use to heat sparge water) and
sometimes I have to put an aluminum foil extension to contain the yeasty
foam.  I "harvest" this yeast by the method  Dave Line suggested (when I
never saw top cropping yeast) all those years back in "The Big Book of
Brewing" (from which I learned to mash 20 years ago, still a good book
despite being superceded by ingredient availability and still in print).  I
take a big clean spoon and pat the back of it on the yeast.  This picks it
up and leaves the foam behind.  I scrape this into a sanitized jar and keep
it for the next batch.  It is pure yeast with very little liquid - about
the consistence of putty or peanut butter.  I understand it is virtually
all live cells because the dead ones drop to the bottom rather than
clumping.


With your blowoff attached to a carboy, you have the beginnings of a Burton
Union fermentation method, and while I'm not familiar with the particular
strain of yeast you have, perhaps it is the one that developed thru
selection in fermentation in unions.*  A Burton Union consists of rows of
good sized casks with a swan neck attached to the top bung hole of each
that emptys into long troughs.  These troughs look like the long metal
urinals you sometimes see at stadiums.  Beer and yeast and crud are pushed
out through the swan necks and the beer runs down to the end where it is
collected through a drain and returned to the fermenters.  This method is
said to "cleanse" the beer of yeast.  It was the traditioinal method of
fermenting the famous Burton pale ales including Bass, but it was abandoned
as impractical in recent decades.  It has been revived by one brewery,
although I can't remember its name.


*Strangely, Terry Foster writes in _Pale Ale_ (Classic Beer Series) that
the Burton system used a powdery, non-flocculent yeast which produced the
well attenuated Burton ales (and it is not clear which came first, the
system to cope with the yeast or the yeast selected by the system).  I
don't understand how such a yeast would get pushed out if it remained in
suspension and didn't flocculate.  Perhaps your Burton yeast is not the
same.

Charlie,


I have the Non-adjustable. I tried to buy the adjustable but it wasn't in stock
when I needed it. As it turns out I'll never need it. I have ground Oats, Rye,
Wheat, unmalted wheat, unmalted barley, American 6-row, Distillers malt, and
just about every known base malt available.  I needed a 2nd pass only on the rye
and the American 6-row i got from Stroh's.


Its just not worth it. I get a perfect crush with great extraction every time.
When I know Im using funky stuff, i do that first and re-investigate, sometimes
I do a second grind. Do i get "too much" dust? Apparently not. Even with my CAP,
I reground all the 6-row, and added 30% flaked corn, and it lautered
beautifully.


The adjustable MM can be adjusted Wrong, and quite frequently is. Why bother
risking Mucking it up? IMHO you will spend more time dinking around with
adjustments, quite often getting them wrong, than you will with occasionally
have to make 2 passes.

couldn't find the alpha info. Several of us got samples of these hops so it
would be nice to know what they were.


I used them anyway, guessed at 6.5% and the CAP came out great! FWH and all...

Subject: Cell Counts & Starter Volume


I was able to find a pretty good estimate for yeast
starter cell counts as a function of starter volume
from Daniels book "Designing Great Beers".  He
suggests that a good cell count estimate is 50E6
yeast cells per ml of starter (for those in the
Grand Rapids, MI, area that is 50 million - don't
use your fingers and toes, it won't work).  All you
need to know now is to estimate the volume of wort
in the fermenter, and the OG of your beer, so you
can hit the target starter cell concentration of
1E6 cells/ml/degree P. Here's an example:


OG = 1.050 = 50/4 = 12.5 degrees P
Volume = 5 gal = 50 * 3.875 * 1000 = 19,375 ml


Required Starter Volume = (1E6*19375*12.5)/50E6


= 4844 ml = 4.8 L = 1.25 gallons


To sum this up for the West MI'ers: you will need
a 1.25 gallon starter for 5 gallons of a 50
gravity beer to reach the required commercial
yeast pitching rates.

I don't know why dry ice would contain benzene-- I thought that the
method for making it was a simple compression-cooling-expansion
process.  But often things are more complex than they first appear, so
it may well contain benzene.

Subject: Lambic Question


First, what's the difference between a Plambic and a regular lambic?  I
thought that a Plambic (aka pseudo-lambic) was a shot at making a beer
like a lambic through formulation and additions, but not through the use
of bacterial strains.  But reading these posts more carefully, it seems
that everyone is making Plambics-- even when all the standard bacteria
and lengthy aging is used.  What gives?


Next question-- I have made a Plambic/lambic of the cranberry variety.
Don't recall the grain bill off the top of my head, but I basically
mashed, got conversion, dropped temp to 135, added a handful of DWC
Pilsen malt, and let it sit for about 24 hours (for the sour-mash; would
this make it a Plambic?).  Then collected the runnings, sparged, and
boiled.  What a pleasant aroma that boil was.  My next-door neighbor
asked me if I'd vomited into my wort while it was boiling.


I cooled it, then pitched a Belgian ale yeast along with the Wyeast
Lambic Blend.  I let it go for 3 weeks, then racked onto 6# of crushed,
pastuerized cranberries.  When I racked it over, I sampled some and it
was great!  Lots of gueze character with all kinds of living aromas and
flavors.  I let it set for 4 months on the cranberries, and now just
racked it over onto another 6# of cranberries.  I plan on kegging in a
few weeks.


But this last time, it was good, not great like it was before.  It seems
almost lifeless compared to the first racking.  Does anyone have any
ideas as to why a lot of the flavors and aromas I expected to develop
and intensify are actually much more subdued?


Thanks for any thoughts!

Subject: Adjustable Mill


Charlie Walker asks for opinions on adjustable
roller mills.


Charlie, have you checked out the Valley Mill?
It is an adjustable roller mill that has ss
bushings, a ss knurled roller, a large 7#
capacity hopper, and the only knock on it by
its major competitor is that is has a passive
roller (no big deal for the home brewer).  I
think the cost is $99 bucks, and is more
affordable than that other mill your are
considering which is only a fixed roller mill.
That adjustable roller mill you are considering
is almost twice the price!


The adjustable feature is essential, and comes
as no extra charge with the Valley Mill.
Anyone who thinks they can achieve consistent
extraction rates milling 6 row, 2 row, and malted
wheat at the same nip are nuts!


For another $10-$20 or so, you can slap a motor
on the Valley Mill and say good bye to hand
cranking forever.


In summary, for the same price as the other mill
you are considering you can have a mill that
is adjustable, and motorized.  Probably the best
deal available in the homebrew mill market...
just my opinion.  Now just think, if the Valley
Mill folks would advertise their "better mouse
trap" on the HBD the way the other guy has, 
they could probably relegate that other mill to
the museum... where have I heard this before?!

So much talk, so many difficulties, it seems that if there's one
quintessential problem us new (and old) homebrewers have encountered
sometime in the brewing experience, it is the dreaded clogging siphon.


And indeed the scrubby on the end of the cane seems to be the universal
solution.  I also had some clogging when using the scrubby, until I started
the practice of putting the little end cap onto the racking cane, then place
this into the scrubby.  It seems to make all the difference when using
pellets.


By the way, you can now get the Choreboy in stainless steel, look around for
it.

   * Stop by at Cooter Browns, where you will find over a hundred beers on
tap, including LIndeman's Frambose on tap!  Here you will discover the heart

A question for the esteemed collective:
I am gearing up to brew a Bavarian Hefeweizen.
Have had much success with extract Hefe's but never brewed an all grain.
I brew in converted Sankes with a stainless false bottom for mashing/lautering.
Can step mash using my HERMS.
My questions are:
1)  Comment on the necessity of decoction mashing - I would rather not take the
time.
2)  Given that I can do temperature boosts easily, what is a recommended mashing
schedule?
3)  What ratio of wheat to 2-row would be recommended?
After seven batches with my system, I have not enjoyed a "stuck" mash.  Would
like to continue to boast this in the future.  I brewed a Belgian Wit with 50%
raw wheat (step mash) and had no lautering problems.
Thanks in advance for any help.

Subject: Beer Fridge lessons 


Colleagues:


Another stupid brewer trick.  I was installing my Robin Broyles design (see
The Brewery/Library for a schematic) heat/cool thermostat on my new
beerfridge.  It worked great on my old fridge.


In order to install it on this newer model, I needed to drill a hole.  I
selected a location, got a 1/2 inch bit, and drilled into the outside.  Once
thru, I dug out the insulation as best I could, until I reached a plastic
liner.  No problem, I thought, it was hard beneath the liner, so I drilled
away.


Immediately beneath the liner was a wiring harness.  Got it, dead center.
Blue flame out the hole, big pop, some smoke, and the fridge stopped.


Reaction: Grab hole saw, make bigger hole to see the problem.  Drill two 2
1/2 inch adjacent holes and view several wires snapped.


Action: reconnect like wires with like wires, and hope.  Yes, it worked,
fridge back in action, now a 4 x 2.5 inch hole in the side of my fridge, but
the probe and the new thermostat get installed, clog hole with insulation,
cover all over with duct tape, and we're on the road.  1.5 hours to do a 10
minute job.  Thermostat works very good, and new  batch of Luna Quarta
Vienna Lager is clucking away happily at 47 degrees F constant.


Lessons learned:


1, Unplug the fridge before you go drilling on it, dummy. Though
electrocution is probably not a problem, a real live insulation fire is bad
form.


2. After drilling the outside, make sure you remove enough insulation to see
the interior surface.  Make no assumptions.  These guys hide wires and stuff
everywhere.  I was worried about a refrigeration coil, wires are bad too.


3. If you don't do 1 or 2 above, have lots of holesaws available. They don't
cut metal well.


Happy holidays, gang.

Subject: sanitizing, dry ice and yeast


Since sanitizing is back in vogue (as a topic that is), I'd like to know what
others are doing about bottlecaps, and in particular oxygen absorbing caps.
I don't recall a clear consensus on the oxygen caps.  I have been sealing
regular caps in pouches and running them through an autoclave.  Sterility
is no problem, but around 10% of the caps are ruined due to peeling of the
rubber seal.  Does this happen when caps are boiled also?  Is Iodophor ok
for the oxygen caps?
I sampled beer carbonated with dry ice once.  It was better than being
poked in the eye with a sharp stick, but only barely.  To be fair, I'm sure
the beer was aweful prior to the addition of dry ice.  I'd be concerned
about the purity and sterility of stuff though.
I've recently started keeping yeast at home and would like to culture
some from commercial brews.  Widmer Hef and Chimay are often mentioned,
but does anyone have info on which others are either good (or bad) for using
to ferment with?  I'm especially interested in Franziskaner Hefeweizen or
like beers.
Thanks to all,

In Belize it is warm all year round and I have been brewing all grain

degrees F for 3 years now with great success. I use Wyeast 2112 for my
steam beer and 3056 for the wheat beer, both of these are used
repeatedly by rinsing with sterile water, adding 10% gylcerine and
freezing until next use. I use Danstar London and Nottingham dry yeasts
for the bitter, brown ale and stout, and champagne yeast for the ale
mead.
My normal procedure is 5 days primary, 5 days secondary, 5 days in
bottle at room temperature and then to the fridge and consume. The 5
gall of beer is usually gone within 6 weeks of brewing and maybe this is
why I do not seem to have any problems.

Subject: first wort hopping


In HBD#3173, the esteemed Jeff Renner says in reply to Robert Waddell's post 
about removing hops as they come to a boil in first wort hopping:


>I suppose this would work for the flavor, but it is not the standard
>method


I was surprised to read that there was a standard method.  I recall some 
debate on this subject (i.e., remove the FWH hops or leave them in) in the 
HBD three or four years ago, which never came to a strong conclusion one way 
or the other.


I have experimented both with leaving the hops in and taking them out.  I am 
currently in the "take them out" camp.  The reason is that I feel I have more 
control over bitterness if I remove the FWH hops before the boil and then 
later add exactly the amount of bittering hops I want to achieve more or less 
my desired level of bitterness.  As Jeff mentioned in his post, the FWH beers 
that were the subject of his experiment (and which had the hops left in for 
the boil) had an increased perceived bitterness.  I think (without proof 
beyond my own taste buds) that removing the FWH hops before the boil brings 
bitterness within more standard range, while leaving intact the flavor and 
aroma effects associated with FWHing.


A related point that has not received much attention is whether there is an 
optimal wort temperature range for the desired effects of FWH.  Here's a data 
point.  Before I moved to my current three tier setup, I used to run my 
lauter runoff into a big picnic cooler where the wort would remain at 150 - 
160f until sparging was complete.  The wort was then pumped up into my boiler 
(which also happened to be my mash tun/lauter vessel).  The whole process 
took about 45 minutes.  I would toss whole hops into the picnic cooler at the 
beginning of the sparge and then leave the hops behind when I pumped back up 
to the boiler.  The flavor I achieved doing this was, I think, superior to 
the flavor that I am able to attain now using my current system, which 
involves sending the lauter runoff directly to the boiler, tossing the hops 
into the boiler, and leaving them there until the wort reaches a boil.


The basic difference between the two processes is that in the picnic cooler 
system, the entire FWHing process occurred at about 160f, whereas my newer 
process takes place while the wort is ramping up from 160f to boiling.


What is the flavor difference between the two processes?  I think the single 
lower temperature FWHing brought out hop aroma more with a result very 
similar to dry hopping.  Leaving the hops in as the wort comes to a boil 
emphasizes flavor more, but develops an astringent flavor that can take 4-6 
weeks of conditioning to smooth out.


I'd be interested in hearing other peoples experiences with various FWHing 
methods.  The one thing I know for sure is that FWHing can have a very 
positive affect on the finished product (the PU clone I made last year with 
FWH Saaz has reached near mythic status among my beer loving friends).  
However, as Jeff mentioned, there is not much in the available texts on this 
technique.  We're kind of flying by the seat of our pants, and it would be 
great to develop a shared knowledge base.

     Jack Straw asks about unusual fermentation foam:  Jack 
     congratulations!  You are fermenting with a bonefied Top Cropping Ale 
     yeast!  They do this (I think I read) that the yeasts bud and then 
     stick together to form mini colonies, and those colonies generate CO2, 
     and rise to the surface of the beer.  Other non top croppijng yeasts 
     stay in suspension as independent yeast cells, and when done 
     fermenting settle out.  I happen to perfer top cropping yeasts, they 
     tend to have more character, and are generally less atenuating than 
     other yeasts.  I have no specific experience with the exact yeast 
     strain you are using, but I bet your beer is just fine!

Well, I'd like to stand up for my hometown as Brett Spivy does. . . .but I'm
afraid that a couple of multi-tap beer bars (some of them overrun with noisy
frat boys fixin' to puke on their shoes), a few restaurants that serve
bottled Belgian beers (enjoy 'em while they're around b/c they're a fad soon
to go the way of the cigar) and one  truly good craft brewer in town
(Acadian Brewing--IMHO) just can't compare with the way you all have it on
the coasts, and increasingly in the mid-Atlantic, the Midwest and Southwest.
If you want to look at it optimistically, I guess you can conclude that
homebrewing will probably remain essential in the Delta South to those who
desire fresh beer in traditional styles.  You just don't have that many
palatable choices unless you brew it yourself.  Here at home, I get to
feeling a bit desperate when my homebrew supply is low; whereas, when I'm
visiting friends and family in Oregon and Maine, I happily give my brewing
gear a little rest while I indulge myself in the relative bounty of fresh
Smuttynose, Otter Creek, Catamount, Deschutes, Full Sail, Widmer, et al. in
those places.  Homebrewing would become a bit more esoteric in nature for me
if I knew that I could walk around the corner (as my Portlandian sister
does) for a pint of prime condition, draught Mirror Pond.
