I can't say whether Jack S. mill is the best or not, but I can say that 
his
attitude toward customer service has, so far as I have dealt with him, 
been
superb.  I have an Easymasher (dearly loved, death to false bottoms) that
 has
had about a hundred batches put through it.  Finally the screen tore 
(that is
I tore it) and I e-mailed Jack to ask about buying another.  His 
response? 


"Send me the busted one and I'll send ya a new one."  Never got around to


doing that though.  I took it apart pushed the screen up past the tear 
and the
sucker even works better.  In all my batches I've had only one stuck mash
 (60%
wheat) that cleared with a "blow-back'.   On the other hand, my grain 
mill is
made by another well known manufacturer (I wanted to buy a JS mill, but 
the
shop was out and I needed on fast)who promised that it could be 
motorized. 


True to form, I lost the single sheet of directions.  Called then 
e-mailed the
maker asking for a copy or general directions indicated willingness to 
pay for
help.  Received a promise of forthcoming instructions, waited a month, no


help, contacted again "ugh, well I remember you, did you send your 
address"
type response (I did I still had a copy of the e-mail)another promise to 
help.
 It's been what 4 months now.


Yeah the mills on the market may all grind well, some may be better than
others, but whose there to back up what they sell?

Jack Schmidling wanted some followup information on the adjustable
motorized roller mill that costs less than his standard non-adjustable
mill, which is by all acounts a fine product too if you are into hand cranking
and a fixed gap width.


>I have my check book ready.   Where do I mail the check.


You send you US$99 to the folks at Valley Mill, I think they are on the web.
A search engine should turn up the URL.  Not sure if they take gold bullion.


The motor is had from the Surplus Center 800-488-3407, there are several
motors listed on pp. 117-118 of the '99 catalog in the US$10-20 range that
would work really well (catalog number 5-984-B) .  You just need a $3
coupling that can be had at any auto parts store.  It is a very simple 
exercise
to attach the motor to the Valley Mill.


Didn't realize the free advertising would be hot button for you.  I thought
HBDers would like to know of other mouse traps that are out there before
they get relegated to the museum.

Subject: Whirlpooling with pellets


Mike Uchima says: "Dry-hopping with pellets, OTOH, can be kind of a PITA,
since
whirlpooling is not an option!"


This simply is not true.  I use almost exclusively pellitized hops and
whirlpool with great success.  When the level of the kettle is low enough to
see the pile in the center of the kettle, I see no evidence that of any of
the trub or hops have broken off from the pile.  The only time I get any of
this stuff coming out of my kettle is when I get greedy and tip the kettle
to get the last bit of wort out.  Even then, it isn't very much.  Actually,
I have a more difficult time whirlpooling when I use leaf hops.

This is an echo of various notes on rec.crafts.brewing, where nobody has
heard a word from BT about back issues or any other sort of compensation.
Apparently they botched the finances, folded, took the money (whatever was
left of it after they screwed up!), and ran.


Now, no doubt, when BT was publishing, they were IT!  They had all the
right stuff.  But something went wrong financially (or at least that's what
they tell us) and they went under.  That is not unusual, given either the
circumstances of start-up periodicals or the state of the homebrewing busi-
ness.  But then we got the notice--"would you like back issues, etc., or do
you want to hold out for a refund?" and some folks who had a reason for
back issues chose that, while others (such as myself, a charter subscriber
who already had every issue) chose to hold out for getting something for
our hard-earned money.  Well, nobody's got anything so far, and it means
that somebody is cheating and double-dealing.  I was holding out for money
back--meaning that's what I'd asked for, but not that I ever expected it to
happen from a company that couldn't manage its basic finances.  So be it.
Others had asked for back issues, which either exist or they don't.  If
they didn't exist they should never have been offered; if they did exist
they should have been sent long before now...but apparently they have not.


Shame, BT.  Shame!  You've not only killed yourself, but by your failure to
deliver even on your shut-down promises, you've killed any future magazine.

Yes you are. You were there. I saw you. And they DID lose 11 days out of

My last weizen bock was 60% wheat malt.  My wit beers have a couple of pounds

sparge yet.

Subject: FWH reference Questions






Jeff Renner provided a superb summary of the FWH evaluations at two breweries...
yet one thing still befuddles me. The reference beers were brewed with
traditional late-hop additions. I'd be curious as to whether the FWH imparted
any substantive olfactory or analytical differences as compared to introducing
the hops a the start of the boil. Clearly time exposure is one variable that
played a factor here.

The Masters Championship of Amateur Brewing is pleased to
announce the following competitions are hereby invited to be
Qualifying Events for MCAB 3, which will be held in eary
2001.


In order to accept our invitation, the invited competitions
must e-mail me before December 31, 1999, noting their wish
to serve as a QE, giving me the competition's date (exact or
approximate), designating a specific person to serve as the
competition's MCAB contact person,  and agreeing to:


(1)  be open to all amateur brewers (i.e., the event cannot
be limited to residents of a certain area or members of
certain clubs or organizations),
(2) offer categories that include the MCAB Qualifying
Styles,
(3) use the BJCP Style Guide for those Qualifying Styles,
(4) limit the size of the flights for the final rounds in
the various Qualifying Styles to 14 or less, and have at
least two judges on each such panel, one of which must be
BJCP-rated (recognized or better).  We also ask, but do not
require, that QE's observe these flight and judge
requirements in all preliminary rounds for qualifying styles
as well.
(5)  report the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of
qualifying brewers to the MCAB within four weeks of the end
of the competition.


The competitions hereby invited are:


Kansas City Biermeisters Competition
Boston Wort Processors Competition
Reggale & Dredhop (Boulder)
World Cup of Beer (California)
Sunshine Challenge (Orlando)
Spirit of Free Beer (N. Virginia)
Dixie Cup (Houston)
Novembeerfest (Seattle)
St. Louis Brews Competition
CBS Spooky Brew (Chicago)


The Bluebonnet Brew Off competition is conditionally invited
to be a QE, on the condition that they agree that, if
necessary, they will move the date of their competition so
as not to conflict with the March 24-25 MCAB II event in St.
Louis.


We also will be having a QE in the Philadelphia area.  The
BUZZ-Off has graciously offerred to stand aside as a QE if
another area event wishes to take a turn as a QE and is
accepted by the MCAB Steering Committee.  Should no such
competition qualify, the BUZZ-Off will serve as a QE.


Additionally, we want there to be a Canadian QE again.  At
present, we are having discussions with CABA and other
Canadian brewers before deciding on a specific QE.


Don't like our selections?  Feel like we've ignored your
area?  Don't get mad -- get busy!  We're also holding open
one more QE slot, so if you've got a proposal, make it to me
ASAP.  Remember, a large part of the MCAB is to give the
amateur brewing committee what *it* wants.


Prospective Qualifying Events should be established
competitions with several years of experience (read: a
demonstrated ability to handle a large competition), in an
area that has a substantial pool of BJCP judges to draw
from.  Additional weight well be given to competitions in
areas that are geographically distant from any of the
announced QE's.  Interested competitions should write me
before December 15, 1999, describing why their competition
should be a QE.


As always, if you have questions about the MCAB, please feel
free to write.

Subject: Bitter Beer


WRT Marc Sedam's overly bitter beer: One of the time honored traditions
of brewing that home brewers seem to seldom use is blending. Try brewing
a batch of essentially the same beer with little or no hopping and then,
after fermentation, blend with the over hopped beer. You ought to be
able to estimate the bitterness to within 10 BU or so by taste (or have
it measured) and can then do the math to determine the required
bitterness, if any, for the new batch.

Actually, Belgian Wit is my "House Beer".  I make several a year, with no
protein rests.  I usually mash in at 154F, with 40-50% raw wheat, and I use a
RIMS system.  I have never had a slow or stuck sparge with one of my Wits.

No, I haven't heard anything or received my back issues either...  although
I did read one post a couple of weeks ago, where the poster was referencing
a back issue he had just "scored".  I assumed he received it as

Subject: Wanted: suggestions for a book on yeast in brewing.




Greetings fellow HBDers,


 The activity of yeast in beer fermentations is obviously a key
 determinant of the final beer's quality and a thorough understanding of
 yeast biology as it relates to making beer should be an enormous help to
 brewers (I know it has helped my beers improve greatly!).


 I am seriously entertaining the idea of writing a comprehensive book on
 the use of yeast in brewing. While there are some fine resources out
 there they are, in my opinion, far too brief. Thorough coverage of  all
 the aspects of yeast biology that are relevant to beer production just
isn't
 possible in a single magazine article or book chapter. Also, some of the
 better treatments of the subject are contained in sources that are
 either hard to come by or very expensive. Following prodding from Steve
 Alexander I was originally thinking of trying to write a series of
articles in
 Brewing Tecjhniques in the vein of Scott Bickham's nice series
 "Focus on Flavor" but then of course came the demise of BT....


 The purpose of this post is to solicit any and all suggestions for such
 a book.  What subjects would people like to see covered? What questions
 would you like to see answered?  What level(s) of readers should such a
 book be aimed at? Most importantly, do you feel such a book is even
 necessary?


 Thanks in advance for any advice you'd care to give!

 Regarding your slow/stuck mead fermentation
 
 >From: Shannon & Angela Menkveld=20
 >Subject: VERY slow mead fermentation
 
  Hi. Here are a couple of thoughts on your stuck mead...


 First, a pure mead (honey and water only, no fruit, etc..) is actually a
 pretty poor source of nutrients for yeast to deal with. Mostly sugar,
 mead musts tend especially to be poor in nitrogen-containg compounds
 that the yeast need to make proteins and nucleic acids. Once they have
 used up what little is present in the mead must, they essentially stop
 growing and their fermentation slows WAY down.
 
 You pitched WAY too few yeast initially - one swelled smack pack isn't
 really even enough yeast to pitch for an all-grain beer wort which is
 yeast nirvana compared to a mead must. However, you later corrected this
 by pitching further yeast in dry form (I assume you followed the
 directions on the packages and re-hydrated them before use?). The fact
 that the fermentation is /still/ stuck after these further yeast
 additions points strongly to some nutritional deficiency. The yeast are
 starved for some necessary nutrient, most likely nitrogen which you can
 supply by adding "Yeast Energizer" which is an ammonia salt that the
 yeast can use for a nitrogen source. Another possibility could be lack
 of available oxygen but this seems much less likely as the dried yeast
 you added are well-oxygenated at the time you pitch them.
 
 My advice would be to add some Energizer, and repitch with another 
 packet or two of rehydrated dry yeast. This should get things kicking!
 
 P.S. there is a mead lovers digest analogous to  the HBD that you might 
 find interesting....

I can.  Every summer I make my ginger wit with 45% raw soft white winter
wheat and 5% rolled oats.  Completely normal runoff in my 10 gallon RIMS
with a picoBrewing false bottom.  As a matter of fact (tempting the brewing

corn meal, a strong ale with 50% home malted oats.  I haven't tried rye,
though.

Subject: Approximating FWH for Extract or Partial Mash Brews (how)


I do some full mash batches but, because of time constraints, nearly half
my brews are combinations of specialty grains and DME.


Typically I use 1 to 2 lb. of specialty grains in 1 to 2 gallons of H2O and
either steep or bring just to a boil.  I then combine the "tea" with 5 to 7
lb. DME and top off to 5.5 gallons before boiling.


So, how could a person approximate the results of FWH for this kind of
brewing?


It seems FWH gets it's effects from the wort temperature, wort pH, and time
( like an hour to sparge).


(1)Could one just put the hops in while the "tea" is being brewed?  I
suspect the temperature and pH profile would not be right in this case. 
Also, the reduced volume could result in reduced utilization.


(2)Could one take the "tea" and bring it up to a typical sparge volume then
adjust it's pH and add the FWhops for an hour.   In this case, why not do
the full mash?  


(3)In (2) above, would adding the DME bring the wort to the right pH.


Any other ideas?

To start out with a OG over 1.120, the yeast is going to have a very 
hard time surviving let alone fermenting out the sugars.


The first thing I would do is check the pH and adjust it if necessary. 
PH that is way too low or too high is not unusual in a mead. 


You didn't mention if you had added any yeast nutrients to your mead. 
Traditional meads tend to be very low in the neutrients needed by yeast. 
I have taken to adding a combination of yeast nutrient (DAP), yeast 
energizer and crushed vitamins (normally 1 crushed 0ne-a-day) to my 
meads before I pitch.


Wyeast's Sweet Mead yeast has a reputation for just stopping. Don't know 
why, just seems to be a problem strain.


What I would do is make a starter from honey and DME and use Lavin 
EC-1118 as the yeast. When you step it up, add 1-2 cups of your must to 
allow the yeast to get accustomed to the must. Step it up to the 1/2 
gallon level. 


Add yeast nutrients and energized\r to your must and then pitch the 
yeast.


Hopefully it will take off!

Subject: open fermentation; wheat beer


Hi all,


Re David Burley's statement that one should not allow the yeast head to
fall back into the beer at the end of open fermentation because 'it is
contaminated'. This is nonsense. I have brewed ~15-20 batches
*completely* open (i.e. no plastic, no lid, no nothing; put lid on until
yeast head forms, remove, leave off until yeast head has collapsed; rest
lid on until ferment is complete; rack), have generally allowed the
yeast head to collapse into the beer and have never had a contamination
problem. Furthermore, open fermenters have been harvesting yeast from
the head of yeast (top cropping) for a very long time; this practice
would have proved to be impossible if David's claim were true. There are
other reasons to not allow the head to collapse, but contamination is
not one of them. Imagine the poor bacterium which falls into that thick
head of millions (billions?) of healthy strong yeast cells!


A question was asked about lautering high proportion wheat beers. I've
only made three wheat beers, in each case with 50% malted wheat. I've
not had any problems with stuck sparges. The gentleman said that he
decocts; this could lead to problems couldn't it, due to gelatinization
of the mash during decoction? Perhaps lautering is easier when we infuse
or step, rather than decoct.

Altavista turns up http://www.web.net/~valley/valleymill.html. The mill is
$119.50 Plus 19.50. That's for an imbalanced tower that is nearly
impossible to use. Want apples to apples? You must add the "optional" base
at $12.00. (While being able to buy the base separately is a benefit to
some, I really wonder if they don't sell a based with the vast majority of
purchases?) So that takes us to 150.50. As I said, I paid $158 for my
Maltmill. No "shipping and handling", no optional base. That was about
five years ago, and I shopped around to get it (it was also an excellent
deal!). They list today at $138 - awfully damned close to the price of the
Valley with the (in my opinion) necessary base. Full apples to
apples would put the large hopper on the Maltmill for another $29 (but
it's about four times bigger than the Valley Mill's capacity, again
throwing the comparison off. So, add 1/4 the cost...). The comparison
between 6 and 3 lbs is close enough for me. And, add the S&H, and the
Maltmill is about $3 more. So where's your beef? 


Does your beef have to do with stainless steel rollers? Why? Seems like
Valley is happily giving them away because they really are an unnecessary
item. My mill lives in my garage. Not a speck of corrosion on the rollers
after all this time, so tell me again why I need stainless steel?!


In my opinion, they're both pretty much the same thing. Just a bit
different in the execution and the marketing. The Valley mill improves on
the adjustment knob on the Maltmill, but I offer that this is an
improvement you'll notice, likely appreciate and then never have cause to
use. In over five years of use, I only adjusted my mill once - and then
put it back to the "factory" setting as I "refined" the crush. It's been
there ever since.

It is just as simple an exercise to convert the Maltmill. So how is this
relevant to the cost differential between the two? OK. You need a $0.19
bushing to adapt the Maltmill shaft to a standard pulley. Big deal. I see
no basis for a gripe here either!

Yes, I'm sure they WOULD like to know of the other "mousetraps"; however,
I'm getting a bit tired of people attacking the Maltmill for no other
reason than because Jack will respond. I've not once seen the creator of
the Valley mill contribute any ideas to the home brewing community through
any of the available forums I monitor. I've never seen the author of that
cheap knock-off of the Maltmill (the one that mounts the mill 90 degrees
from the Maltmill position, but appears to be otherwise identical) on any
forums offering advice or information to other brewers, either. I only see
Schmidling, Listermann, and a few others - and Jack is more of a constant
than anyone else.


And does Jack advertise on the HBD? Not as I see it. He has responded to
like questions and defended his products against posts that call for
direct comparisons in one way or another. I've never once had Jack come
out of the blue to "advertise" one of his products on the Digest. Had that
ever occurred, I'd not be defending him here! 


Give the guy a break. He's just got over-developed entrepreneurial skills.
Not a fault, in my book. And he makes a damned fine, competitive mill.

Thanks for the great post Jeff.
I think that this is where I got the idea that the hops were removed from
the wort
before the boil starts, as a "hop front" and hopping the mash would
eliminate them
after their use.  I use one of those very fine mesh screen skillet covers
to remove
the hot break just as my wort comes to a boil.  That would be a real mess
if I had
hops swimming around in there, so I use a weighted muslin bag that is easy to
lift out and wring the goodies back into the boil.  I then add the
bittering hops 
without a bag after about 15 minutes.  But your post has me considering maybe
building a "hop front" just to play around in the brewery some more.   #%^)

Southwest Airlines has an internet special

before 12/2/99.  For instance, several of us in Ann Arbor have already
bought tickets for Detroit to St. Louis for $29 each way, or $69 R/T with
taxes.  (We're coming in on SWA 854 at 3:15 PM; arrive at the same time and
meet us at the airport).  I understand there is a light rail line that,
while it can take up to 40 minutes from the airport to the Union Station
(by the hotel), is less than $2.00!


I understand that the whole schedule for MCAB II is not firmed up, but for
the pub tour and other activities Friday evening 3/24/00, you should be at
the hotel no later than around 6:30pm.  It ends Sunday 3/26/00 with VIP
tour of the A/B pilot brewery 11am-1pm.


Plan ahead now, and hope to see lots of HBDers there.

Another data point.  I am part owner of a Valley Mill, and have never had

Subject: Summer brewing


For Those Down-Under,


I noticed that the replies to Darren Robey (hbd 3172) problem of brewing at 
summer temperatures centered on choice of yeasts and beer styles. However, 
there are a couple of techniques worth mentioning that can help make better 
beers at summer temperatures.


The first is, of course, a glass carboy wrapped in towels, which are kept 
moist with water (evaporative cooling).  They can be kept wet by repeated 
soaking, or by setting the carboy in a container and recirculating water 
slowly with an aquarium pump.  Evaporation could by enhanced by directing a 
fan at the carboy.


Another technique is to immerse copper coils (clean) in the primary, and 
have cold tap water slowly running through the coils. This works well with 
primary containers with large opening, such as the plastic bin type of 
fermentor. Once the coils are in the wort, a special lid can be fitted, or a 
sheet of aluminum foil or cling-film can be used to seal the top.


Also there has been discussion on hbd about constuction of a small, 
insulated air-conditioned chamber or box, in which beer can be fermented at 
cool temperatures.


The chances of ending up with a badly infected beer can be lessened by 
pitching a generous amount of yeast, and by moving things from primary to 
secondary to keg as quickly as possible.


All the best,

Perhaps Jim Liddil should be fielding this one if he's lurking out there
somewhere, but pLambic is a nod to the fact that only brewers in the Senne
Valley of Belgium are able to make true lambics, somewhat like the
"Champange" designation being only allowed on sparkling wine from that
region, or "appellation" of France.


The rest of us are reduced to making immitations, ie. pseudo-lambics.


To my knowledge it has nothing to do with the innoculation technique
specifically, just indirectly.

to the boil, boil 90 minutes.  Add 2 oz of Kent Goldings or
Fuggles for 60 minutes.


Am I ok here or is this totally off base?  Private emails are
fine.


Also, I will be in St. Paul  MN for business for a week.  Any
recomendations on where to stop in for a brew?

Subject: Valley Mill


No offence to Jack because I have to admit I have never even seen an
EasyMasher. But why would anyone want a fixed space mill as opposed to a
Valley Mill? Unless it was infinitely cheaper, in which case you are
compromising. But it would appear that cost difference is not even a factor
here.


I have been extremely happy with my Valley Mill and have on occasions
achieved mash efficiencies in the order of 180%!!
I achieve this by putting twice the amount of malt through my mill than I
actually admit to.


The Valley Mill is the one for me until Jack or anyone else can convince me
otherwise.


Jack, why don't you send me one of those free EasyMashers you were giving
away left, right and centre before you tapped into that billion plus market?


Cheers

My thoughts on Marc Sedam's post on over-bittered beer:


The solution:  Tincture of time. 


I've made beers over-bittered to the point it would take the enamel off 
your teeth, and by putting the puppies in the fridge for 6-9 months, they 
mellowed and came into balance nicely.  This is especially true of pale 
ales, IPA's, and barley wines (which my fellow homebrewers here in Maine 
afffectionately refer to as "Tiger Piss").  


Don't give up on your beer.  You'll probably be pleasantly surprised at 
its own regenerative, healing powers!
