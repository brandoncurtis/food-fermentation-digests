Subject: Shannon & Angela's very slow mead


Hmm....1.150 is an SG way beyond my comfort zone.  I start that kind of
mead at 1.100, and add the remaining 1/3 of the honey on the second day of
intense fermentation.  It's the usual and highly recommended procedure.


I think you re-pitched the champagne yeast a bit early.  Now that you're
below1.100, I would re-pitch, but I would hedge my bets even further by
starting it in 1 L of 1.030 honey solution containing some yeast nutrients
and pitching it once it's rocking.


I used Lalvin EC1118 for my strong meads, but I always start it in 1 gallon
of apple juice plus yeast nutrient and pitch it as soon as (within 1 day)
it settles out so it's good & hungry.  Mead is a big challenge for yeast,
even more if it's high in gravity.

Hey, Phil,


if you have such kind of prejudices on German beers, you probably didn't 
yet 
drink Belorussian beer from any of the small scale landbreweries, usually 
meant to give the consumer an alternative to pure alcohol or anti-ice 
liquids. That's taste!!!

It is with a heavy heart that I announce that Dave Burley has apparently
died sometime after 11/15/1999 and before 11/17/1999, or at least
11/19/1999.  Oddly enough he predicted his own death saying that he
would die before another day with all odd digits comes on the calendar.
Dave Burley wrote:
 - --------------------------------------------
I hope you all had a wonderful day on 11/15/99

This is the last one we will ever see. After this,
there won't be an Odd Day until 1/1/3111. The
next Even Day will be 2/2/2000, the first since
8/28/888 (just in case you're keeping track....).

Ruth asks about rose hips. I don't know about beer, but they make for an
excellent mead. Paul Gatza made 4 sweet dessert meads for the AHA
banquet in Olathe including red raspberry, marionberry(similar to
loganberry), and rose hip. All were lovely, but the rose hip was the
unanimous favorite. If I recall correctly, Paul used 2 pounds of rose
hips to five gallons. Absolutely murder with cheesecake...

Subject: Summer Brewing / wheat






Thanks for all the kind people who replied to me call for ideas regarding
high temp brewing. I hope to summarise the post more completely when
managing the quality of this fine nations wheat crop subsides a little.
We're mid harvest and flat out here.


Anyhow the consensus seems to be beers of Belgian origin seem to be the
ones to go for higher temp brewing, or a weizen, but mid to high 20's could
produce more banana that this monkey could handle!


Other options were the well designed systems of cooling such as boxes with
ice, airconditioning, wet towels and fans and the fridge. It will be next
summer before the fridge works out for me but I look forward to that and
the complete control it deserves.


- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ------------------


Next question would be are there any styles of beer that utilise high
proportions of unmalted wheat. I take it we'd be looking at low protein
soft white wheats rather than bread wheat. Any comments?


Rgds and thanks again.

Re-read what I wrote... I said *dry-hopping*, i.e. adding hops to the
secondary fermenter.  Whirlpooling a carboy full of fermented beer would
be a neat trick. :-)  Not to mention, I'd have to wait several days for
the beer to fall clear again.


I agree that using pellet hops in the kettle should not be a problem, I
do it all the time.

This is an echo of various notes on rec.crafts.brewing, where nobody has

Apparently they botched the finances, folded, took the money (whatever was

Well, I can't speak for everyone but in all fairness, I must report that BT

all the photos I had submitted for the article, a copy of the article and,
a Zip disk containing the article.  It was dated November 10.  I would take
a wait and see on this.  It seems people at BT are still working the
problem.  Wonder how they are getting paid.

Subject: Benzene in Dry Ice


I usually stay on the sidelines for most of these discussions, but the
debate about dry ice containing Benzene got my dander up.


Almost all of the CO2 produced in this country is a byproduct of methane
reforming. The methane (CH4) is cracked using a catalyst into CO and H2, the
CO is oxidized to CO2, and the CO2 is removed using an amine solution. Most
of the H2 is used to make ammonia, or is used in the production of gasoline
and other petrochemicals. The C02 is sold to one of several companies. BOC
gasses, Air Liquide, and Praxair control about 90% of the market. They clean
and purify the C02 gas, then either liquefy it for shipping or make it into
dry ice. The cleaning step involves carbon filtration (to remove organics,
like benzene), compression and separation based on relatively different
boiling points of the constituent gasses. The dry ice step is just a simple
refrigeration step, just like making water (wet?) ice.


Almost all of the CO2 produced this way is sold to brewers, soft drink
bottlers, bars and restaurants, and welding supply houses (where you get
your CO2 bottle filled). These end users have very strict standards for
impurities, in the ppb range. The ammonia plant I work makes CO2 that goes
into Coke, Pepsi, Bud, Miller, Pete's Wicked, and almost every micro or
brewpub beer made in the Mid-Atlantic. The dry ice that our customers make
is used to amuse schoolchildren and ship frozen food all over the world. If
there is benzene in dry ice, it is also in almost every fizzy thing you buy
or make, if you force carbonate. 


There are reasons not to use dry ice in homebrew (foamovers and bottle
bombs, mainly), but benzene contamination isn't one of them.

Subject: BT backlash


I, as much as anyone, miss BT.  Maybe more than most.  The
quality of the people and product were, and are, beyond
reproach.  Your accusations of unseemly business practices are a
bit premature.


When a company is dissolved and has outstanding credits to repay,
there is an order which people are paid back.  As might be
expected, the banks get first crack at any assets.  It is likely
that BT also had/has outstanding debits to collect, and is trying
to get the money it is owed as well.  There are a whole series of
people (my finance textbook is at home) who would get repaid
before subscribers.  Generally speaking, the people who are owed
MORE money get repaid first.  So, BT probably has 2000+ people
who are each owed ~$30 (subscription price), and a few people who
are owed much more than that.  Legally speaking, subscribers are
on the bottom of the totem pole.  In a normal liquidation of
assets you can sell off equipment in a "fire sale" and get some
cash to repay outstanding debts.  For a magazine who outsourced
all of the printing and publication, they probably have very
little in the way of PPE (property, plant, & equipment) to sell.
A few computers, a nice poster, the microwave, but not much else.


I know that Deb, Stephen, Gail, and the others at BT will take
care of the subscribers to the best of their ability.  An
example:  I had written a review for "The Homebrewer's Garden"
months ago which was scheduled for publication in the now
ill-fated June/July issue.  Just this week I received a floppy
disk and a letter from Deb Jolda (Editor) stating that they were
returning the copyright to the article and a copy suitable for
publication to me.  I found this to be an act of genuine class,
showing that they are trying to make good on all the promises of
an organization that ceases to be.  It would have been easier to
simply reformat the hard drives and move on than to send me that
information.


BT gave a voice and forum to those who find both the art and
science of brewing to be what its all about.  I am forever
grateful to them for allowing an unknown writer (me) to submit a
research article which they found suitable for publication.  As
with many articles that appeared in BT, mine was recognized with
a Quill and Tankard Award
(http://www.beerwriters.org/writer/awards99.html).  I say this
less as self-promotion (although it is my proudest achievement in
years of brewing) than to remind people of the great service that
BT provided all brewers interested in taking their skills to the
next level.


Basically, I'd suggest you have a little patience before
slandering a good organization that was squeezed out by shrinking
market forces.  Wrapping up an organization is not an easy or
pretty site.  Give them time and I have no doubt they will make
good on as many obligations as they have the resources to do so.
Financially speaking, it's a little early to get feisty.


I have stepped down off my soapbox.

Aye, there's the rub.  I started with a Corona and it was adequate.  The
problem is that the Corona is designed to mill grain into flour, and so
it shreds rather than crushes.


The surmountable problems were:
 -continuously adjusting the gap (because it would work loose-- it wasn't
made to be cranked with a gap that big)
 -refilling the hopper frequently (the big hopper only held about 1.5
#'s)
 -cranking till my arm fell off (thus the one handed typing job)
 -watching the grain carefully to make sure that the crush wasn't too
fine, but it wasn't completely whole, either (see first point)
 -discharge in a wide band, which I rectified by putting a gallon ziplock
around the crush-plate.


It's fine for starting off, and the price can't be beat.  If you're
planning on seeing how this grain stuff works, try it out.  But if
you're committed to going all grain, I'd pick up a mill suitable to the
job.

Whoa, Dick.  These are pretty strong words and nasty aspersions to

You have NO IDEA of the financial details of the demise of BT.  My
guess is that the subscribers are last in line to receive any
compensation under the conditions of the demise (bankruptcy?).  If BT
did go bankrupt the subscribers are last in line BY LAW.  I expect
that banks, paper suppliers, and printers, are all ahead of us
subscribers in that line.  You're whining about your paltry $20-50.  
The banks and suppliers of BT are worried about tens of thousands of
dollars or more.  The principles of BT are also probably dealing with
personal losses of similar amounts.


So, lighten up, man, these people are mourning the death of a loved
one, trying to pick up the pieces, and you're at the funeral bitching
that the deceased owed you a few bucks!  These things take time, often
it is years before full resolution.

I have duct taped the cardboard box that a 12 pack of Catamount Christmas
Ale came in to the original wood hopper.  All most an exact fit.  This setup
holds all the grain for a 5 gallon batch. 


JSP 's customer service is superb.  A brewing buddy of mine had a mill with
the original design rollers, groves that ran the length of the roller.
These rollers got damaged by motorizing and crushing floor malted grains
that had small rocks.  The mill still crushed fine but the rollers were
scored from the rocks.  He contacted JSP and for little more than the cost
of shipping JSP promptly replaced the rollers with the newer knurled model.




With all the whining we see on this digest over mail order purchases and

I am a happy owner of the Valley Mill and have put _a_lot_ of grain
through it.  I often double crush my malt, as someone else has
suggested, to acheive better extraction.  When putting the once crushed
grain through, I also have to poke at it a bit to get it going.


As a data point, I do adjust the gap in the mill based on type of
grain.  I find a real difference between domestic six row, Hugh Baird
Pale Ale Malt (winter barley), American two row, German (or Czech) two
row, and wheat malt (which I typically grind the finest).


I have also motorized my mill with a motor from Burden's Surplus Center,
which makes it very nice.  BTW, I think that I still have the board that
Pat was grumbling about that I bought with the mill.  If anyone wants
it, I'll send it for the cost of shipping.

I have motorized my Valley Mill but I don't think the 1/3 horse motor is
inadequate.  I drive it with a V-belt and it will slip if a rock gets stuck
in the rollers but that is not my problem.  My problem is the slave roller
stalling while the driven roller still turns.  The slave roller is driven by
the grain passing between it and the driven roller.  I had more problems when
I tried double milling but as I saw no discernible improvement in double
milling I abandoned that.  I always brush off dust, etc., from the rollers
before I start milling but sometimes have the mentioned problem.

my personal experience has been exactly the opposite.  when i don't decoct,
wheat malt becomes a bigger problem when lautering.


the one piece of advice i would pass on to any of you embarking on the ">50%
wheat" grain bill path is this:  when you start your runoff out of the
lauter tun, run it off slowly.  with my setup (phalse bottom), if i start
the flow at too fast a rate, the bed compacts and the flow slows
irrecoverably.  if i start the runoff slowly, i can get up to an acceptable
flow rate gradually with no problems.

Subject: Multiple milling, Really open fermentations


Brewsters:


Keith MacNeal asks if I can define
"substantially better"
as it relates to my method of double milling of malt.


The details are in the archives, but milling
coarse first  ( just so the grain is being cracked)
removes the husk whole, cracks the grain to
a uniform size ( about 6 pieces), but larger
than desired for good extraction. On the
second pass ( 0.06 in nip), the husks are
not milled smaller and the grist is uniformly
sized to the desired size with low flour content.


My experience with a single pass is that if it
is too large ( as in  Homebrew store), extraction
can drop by several points depending on the
relative size of the grists ( like from the 90s %
to 75%)  and if too small, the husks get ground
also and milling is intermidable. Worse, the
small husk size ( from getting "chewed" off
the grain) in the too small nip and high flour
content can lead to a slow or stuck sparge.
 Double milling actually takes less time than
a protracted small size single milling, since the
grain is pulled into the nip easily and gives
substantially better sparging due to the whole
husks.


I have to restrict the flow out of my lauter tun
 with a valve, so that I don't sparge too fast.  If
I didn't, I would be finished sparging in 15
minutes or less, with consequent loss of
extraction. Take an hour to sparge, since the
sugars need to diffuse into the sparging solution.


This milling method allows me to use a rapid
sparge method when making rye beers. Since
the viscosity of these worts is extremely
temperature and concentration dependent.
This is the reason most brewers have trouble
with rye worts spargings. To overcome this, I
pull off all the hot wort as rapidly as possible,
rinse the bed with hot sparge water, combine
these sparges, heat them back to 170F and
put this hot, diluted solution back through the 


grain bed to clarify it.  Works great! I get
good recovery and the sparge goes 


smoothly and I am in control of the rate.
Sparge the bed with the remaining half of the
sparge water.


This is what I mean by "substantially better."
A complete improvement across the board
in the extraction process. 


- ---------------------------------------------
Robin cites the brewing process of centuries
ago as demonstrating the nonsense of
yeast becoming contaminated from exposure
to the air in a truly open fermentation.


I do not deny that yeast has been fermented
in the open for centuries. I also have no proof
that the yeast were not contaminated - do you?
I suspect they were to some extent, as many
beers were enjoyed mixed with acidic "old"
or "stale" beers.  This sort of taste might have
been desirable over the centuries as it is less
cloying in the , low alpha acid hopped, heavy
beers of the time AND it may have been a
natural consequence of British fermenting
styles - sort of like Momma's cooking.


There is also the oft told danger of
"yeast-bitten" beer from letting the head fall
back in. Both AlK and I agree this is false.
How could this rumor have been started?
Perhaps by tasting the fermentation head
comprised of protein/tannin complexes
insoluble in beer or perhaps by
contaminated yeast?


In British open brewing, the head was
routinely skimmed on a daily or more
basis to prevent this head from falling
back in. This would have prevented or
reduced contamination. Maybe it is a
case of right action for the wrong reason.


There is a second issue and that is the
surface to volume ratio of the swimming
pool size fermenters and your measley
5 or ten gallon brew. Calculate the relative
surface to volume ratio and you appreciate
the difference in exposure ratio.


If I take a ~100,000 gallon fermenter as being
30X30X10 ft deep, I get an exposure of
900 sq ft/100.000 gal compared to your
fermenter with about ~3 sq ft and 5 gallons
That is a ratio of 0.009 vs 0.6 sq ft per gallon
or about 66 times less exposure in the case
of the old timey British brewery. A taller
fermenter would be an even greater difference.
Many fermenters were larger and deeper
than this. Modern use of the open fermenter
is done in a closed room under positive
pressure with automatic skimming.


Ask yourself, if it was so good why did
they change?
 


The real danger of using a truly open
fermentation is if you are recycling your
yeast, then repeated contamination over
time can cause a problem. Why not close
it up with a plastic sheet? It works great
and no cats or kids can fall in! I also cover
mine with a lid to prevent light from skunking it.

Subject: Benzene and public safety


Brewsters:


Page down if you don't want to read about
properly describing chemical dangers, politics,
public safety and how it affects your life.
Sorry for the rant, but a nerve got hit and the 


HBD is light at the moment.


Glen Pannicke says about Benzene:


"Benzene is a carcinogen"


Unless I missed something, it has been only
proven so in specially selected, tumor
susceptible mice. But, he is right it is
*legally* a carcinogen.


And he says benzene is highly toxic and is
absorbed through the skin, through ingestion
and breathing the vapors.


In my own experience, benzene is not toxic in the
sense I believe this word should be used. - that is
poisonous and life threatening.  As a chemist, I and
millions of other chemists used to wash in this stuff
and breathe it routinely. Chemists as a group have
lower cancer rates than the general population, as
do chemical workers.  In large quantities, over a long
time ( hardly a toxin), I do believe that it can have
an effect on your liver, as can many aromatics.
If so, this was proven by studies of humans and
does have meaning. Maybe epidemiological 


studies on human populations are now available
demonstrating the clear carcinogenicity of benzene.
I have never seen them.


Let's clarify the information source and specify the
effect so we can be better informed and not be
continually ravaged by the words "toxic chemical"
which has taken on emotional meanings in the
media, because of the general non-understanding
of the reporters and the need to make headlines. And
their failure to understand what a toxin is.


I know of no human example in which cancer was
caused by benzene. 




This doesn't mean we should be sloppy, but let's
stop crying wolf and supporting a flawed system
of evaluation of danger ( tumor susceptible mice),
so we know where to spend our resources and
of what to be really careful. Let's not mix politics
and public safety as now happens - in spades. 




Every statement about chemical safety should
be prefaced by "In tumor susceptible mice and
specially selected strains of hairless, poor
immune system mice... No studies of humans
were carried out". Often, in studies I have
seen ( and that is quite a few) when we were
preparing MSDS sheets for every chemical in
the 1970s , it was routine that so many of the control
mice died it was difficult to determine the effect.
Sometimes, more control mice died or had more
tumors than the test mice, but no one proposed
this blatantly excess chemical treatment  as a
cure for cancer!  Use of sloppy statistics and
discarding of "outliers" or should I say
"out-right liars" often justified the study for the
Ph.D. candidate and his Prof's grant from the
NIH or whoever and resulted in the classificaton
of the substance as a problem. Call me sceptical.


It is possible that benzene could be in dry ice,
depending on the source of the dry ice, it will
likely be infinitesimal, but it is conceivable . Remember
the fairly recent withdrawal of Perrier water because
PPB (?) of benzene somehow got in the water from 


a pumping station or something. My opinion of this?
A waste of time, money and reputation for fear of 


litigation based on the false premise that if giant
quantities of an injected  chemical disrupts the
immune systems of a susceptible rodent,and
prevent it from fighting tumors, then ANY quantity
will be labeled a carcinogen. This is on the lawbooks.


Just like it is the law that anything which has ever been
radioactive is considered to be *legally* radioactive
and has to be handled accordingly, despite
the fact that the  radioactive substances have
been removed. What is the result of this absurd 


law? Potentially, millions of gallons of low-grade
radioactive water leaking into our water supply,
since there is no good way to dispose of the
purified water and it is thus cheaper to store it. 


Buried steel tanks leak after 30 or 40 years 


as has been demonstrated in Washington
state. This law may be one more tool in the
lobbying efforts of Big Coal, Oil and Gas to 


make safe, cheap, pollution-free Nuclear energy
too expensive for the US. Call me paranoid.


I want people to be careful, but be sceptical, so
we are not fooled and make bad long-term
decisions for this nation based on bad information.
Public safety is the wrong place to cry "wolf".


In making homebrew, being careful is very important,
since this is a hobby which can involve immediately
dangerous things like pressure tanks, boiling
water, slippery 5 gallon glass carboys weighing 50 lbs
and possibly real toxins like botulin toxins.
As a hobby, we often try to do things that present a
real danger, as our enthusiam takes over our
better judgement. I do not promote that kind
of behavior. Always think through what you
are doing if you are using a piece of equipment
that is not intended for the purpose and develop
an appropriate exit strategy. It doesn't take
long to get hurt permanently.

the insinuation here (at least the way it reads to me) is that
decoction-mashed beers undergo gelatinization and infusion-mashed beers do
not.  barley malt gelatinizes at (roughly) 147 to 153 deg f., thus
gelatinization should occur in most of our mashing adventures, regardless of
mashing method (decoc vs. infus).


for loads more info., search the hbd archives on "scandrett", circa 1997 or
so.
 
just a nit.


brew hard,
