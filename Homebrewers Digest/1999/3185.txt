Subject: Dried Sweet corn / malt water content / malting page / turning


All -


In 3184, Jack S talks about dried sweet corn. Jack, what is the best 
method to dry it, in you r experience? It seems that the ideal method 
would be to let it stay on the stalk.


In 3180, Dave Burley comments on drying malt to determine the water 
content. I agree with his recommendations about temperature and time, for 
the following reasons. When I was conducting soil physical property 
testing for a living, the applicable ASTM method required heating at 105C 
for either 24 hours or until the weight of the dried material decreased by 
less than 1 percent between weighings. The 105C was to prevent burning off 
the organic material (roots. loam, humus, etc).


I do wonder about Dave's bag method though. Does the bag pick up any 
water? Can you account for this? Or is any amount the bag would pick up so 
small as to not worry about it?


In 3179, cmoore`at`gi.alaska.edu says he has plans for putting malting info 
on the web. COOL! I can't wait to see it.


In 3178, Stuart Anderson says this hobby is one of few where the amateur 
has a shot at turning pro. Stuart, consider it LONG and HARD! Amateurs 
could do it relatively easy 10 years ago, but not any more. And it really 
sucks when you realize it isn't going to work anymore.


One last thing - Dave Burley's rant about carcinogens and how they become 
classified as such was pretty good. It seems that a lot of these tests (to 
determine carcinogenic tendencies, etc) have very specific conditions that 
might or might not be regularly encountered in the life of the average 
person. That being said, there will always be people who can use themselves
 as evidence to disprove the danger of various compounds. "We used to sit 
on those drums of radioactively contaminated cutting oil and eat lunch! 
Why are you suiting up to poking in the dirt (where those drums leaked)?" 
Actually heard it. Honest.

Subject: Home Dried Corn


Jack,
How might you accomplish "home drying" of your sweet corn?  Dry it on the 
cob?  Just let it sit there and dry?  How does this effect the sugar 
content?  One thing my father-in-law used to do (and still does on 
occasion) is show up serendiptously at the table with "sweet corn" that is 
actually quite good.  Maybe not quite as good as some Illini SuperSweet, or 
your Golden Bantam X, but comparable with most sweet corn you buy at 
farmer's markets.  This fancy sweet corn he "buys" is field corn he picks 
himself.  There is a very short period of time when the sugar content is 
high and the stuff is pretty good.  After that, I believe the sugars are 
polymerized into the starches we normally associate with "feed corn".  I 
know that if you don't eat sweet corn soon after it is picked, it loses 
some of its flavor, probably in a similar manner.  How do you prevent 
this...or don't you?  You say that it makes better corn meal, I'm 
interested to find out how and throw some into a CAP.

Welcome to HBD, Devon.  I second your question as I have the same problem.
I was asked to brew 5 or 10 gallons of CAP for MCAB II in St Louis in
March.  We half dozen or so attending AABG members were going to carpool,
but Southwest Airlines' $69 round trip from Detroit was too good to pass
up.  I was planning to use a Sankey, which would be even harder to pack on
a plane or to open to prove it contains only beer.  After all, Sankeys are
(were?) a favored bomb container for the IRA!


So I hope people with suggestions will post them rather than send private
email.


BTW, where in Michigan is the wedding?  If you do get the beer here, can we
crash?  The party, not the plane.

I grow sweet corn also and though I have never tried it, I am wondering 
why the corn cant be removed from the cob and added directly to the mash.  
Without drying or milling.  Maybe run it through a blender to puree it a 
little.  Of course this would limit your sweet corn brewing to harvest 
time.  I guess you could always can it and hope the botulism doesnt get 
you if you wanted to brew sweet corn at a later date.

Questions on The Ancient Art of Hopping


If you don't have a hop back, what is the best mode of getting hop aroma
into your brews?


Is it using a hop tea?  Is the aroma generated from a hop tea similar to a
hop back and less harse than dry hopping?  Also, how much water and how much
hops should be used in a tea?  Also, what temperature should the water be at
and how long should the hold time be(contact time in a hop back is someting
like 2 minutes or so)? - I would assume a temp of a bit cooler than boiling
to extract the most hop oils?


Has there been any studies on the extraction of hops oils in various temp
water? Will it differ for varying hops varieties? 


Any help would be appreciated.   Also, if one is adding aroma hops at the
I have always done 2 to 3 minutes based on the idea of needing boiling water
to solubilize the oils? BUt perhaps right at the end is better for
aroma.......


Thanks,

Subject: Re: Grain Mills




I have a "Automatic Mill" that I purchased from Pat's.  It works very well,
and I am happy with it. I typically mill an entire 50 lb bag of malt for a
brew session in just 15 minutes. The mill is best (most efficient, no stuck
sparges) if used on the finest setting. It occasionally has a hard time
staring if the hopper is full. I believe this is common with all the mills
that have a passive roller. This is not a problem, you just reverse the
drill direction for and instant, which frees the obstruction, then go on as
normal. The best way to use the mill is to start the rollers (ie drill) with
the hopper empty, then continually adding grain to the hopper until you're
done. This requires two people, but one could always mount and motorize the
mill. 


The reason I choose the automatic was that I wanted the ability to change
the spacing, I wanted the spacing to be even across the mill, and I did not
want to deal with shipping across international borders.

I've seen lots of disposable plastic medical syringes of all different
sizes and I've never seen one with any sort of lubrication.  Perhaps I
just missed it, but I'd be mightily surprised if they were lubricated.


If you fill a medical syringe with an oil or grease, over time the
soft rubber on the plunger will absorb the oil and soften and swell,
eventually becoming unusable.  You can extend the usable time period
by introducing air into the syringe and storing the syringe in such a
way as to keep the plunger out of the oil.


In any case, if you are looking for keg grease, something suitable to
use to grease the various rubber seals, try a silicone based clear
grease.  Vacuum pump or stopcock grease works quite well.  You should
be able to find it at one of the mega-hardware stores or even a
restaurant supply store.

Hi Everybody,
Getting ready to set out on an IPA.  Dave Brockington gives himself rave 
reviews on his Sister Star IPA recipe.  I look at the use of 3 oz of 
Chinook Hops and my IBU calculator goes haywire.  Has anybody actually 
brewed a 5 gallon batch with that huge quantity of bittering hops?  Was it 
drinkable?  I see recent postings for Hop Devil and Hop Pocket that use a 
much smaller quantity of bittering hops and I'm curious.  If you've brewed 
Sister Star with that quantity of hops, I'd like to hear about it (good or 
bad).  Thanks.

Subject: Still long lag time with Nottingham?






Hello all,


        Well, I guess I'm trying to revive another dormant thread.
We had a lot of posts in the last year or so about extended lag
times for Lallemand Nottingham dry yeast, although the traffic seems
to have died out.  Maybe the problem has ceased for most.  I brewed
what I hope will be a pretty serious American Ale this weekend, and
had the same difficulty with the Nottingham yeast taking forever to
take off.  I was pretty scrupulous about handling the yeast, too,
so I'm perplexed about what's going on.


        Let me outline my procedures, just to avoid a slew of responses
suggesting things I actually did.  I planned on running off about 10.5
gallons of wort at about 1.060 into two carboys,  6.3 and 5 gallons,
respectively.  I had three 5 gram packets of Nottingham, 9 months before
the expiration date, kept refrigerated at home and at the homebrew shop
(which gets them directly from L.D. Carlson in Kent, by car, so no UPS
horror stories are likely.)  I would have preferred 4 packets, since
15 grams in 10+ gallons is underpitching slightly, but this shouldn't
matter too much.  I decided to rehydrate the yeast in the carboys, so I
sprinkled about 6g into the 5 gallon carboy, about 9g into the 6.3 gallon.
To rehydrate the yeast, I took about 12 ounces of tap water at 95-100F
and added it directly to the carboys, swishing it around to moisten all
the yeast.  This sat for about 15 minutes to rehydrate, while I cooled 
the wort with an immersion chiller.  At 15 minutes, I added a cup or two
of 85F wort to each carboy, to attemper the yeast.  After 10-15 more minutes,
the wort was down to 75F, and the runoff into the carboys was begun.  I
generally put the first 2-3 gallons into the large carboy, then 4.5-5 gallons
into the smaller, then the rest into the large carboy, trying to avoid
differences in temperature between the fermentors from thermal gradients
in the kettle.  After collecting 10.5 gallons, I aerated using pure O2
and a SS airstone, for about 20 seconds in each carboy.  The carboys were
placed in a 60F basement, raised off the floor and covered with plastic
garbage bags, to hold in some of the warmth until fermentation took off.


        To my surprise and annoyance, I had no airlock activity at all
for 24 hours.  The larger carboy finally had a thin layer of krausen at
30 hours, but the smaller took almost 48 hours to get any real krausen 
going.  Admittedly, I underpitched slightly, and the 60F ambient temperature
is on the low end for this yeast, but neither factor should cause this
sort of lag time.  


        Past posts about this problem have brought in suggestions along 
these lines:
        1.  Be more careful about rehydration and attemperation of
                the yeast.  Okay, did that here.  My 95-100F tap water
                was a bit colder than the 104F recommended, but this
                should be a pretty negligible factor.
        2.  Avoid aerating the wort, since dried yeast have a large
                enough cell count and high enough glycogen stores, so
                that you don't have to worry about deficiencies 4 or
                5 generations down the road.  (I agree with this somewhat.)
                The poster went further, saying that O2 in the wort
                would retard fermentation, by keeping the yeast in a
                reproductive phase.  (This part I can't quite agree
                with, although my results seem consistent with the idea.)


        So, what's going on?  At this point, I welcome any ideas, wild
speculations, or even pagan rituals that might help.  Jethro/Rob, any
ideas from the Lallemand folks?  As always, thanks in advance for any
help.


        I'm hopeful that this ale will still turn out to be quite nice.
It was brewed in celebration of the two month window where we have the last
all odd digit day (11/19/1999) for 1111+ years and the first all even
digit day (02/02/2000) since 08/28/0888.  What better excuse for a
seriously hoppy American ale, using a ton of the 1999 hop harvest?
By the way, the 1999 Columbus hops seem really nice:  much cleaner in
aroma than past years.  I'm getting thirsty already.  Thank goodness
that Sierra Nevada is shipping its Celebration Ale as far East as
Clevelnad this year.

Subject: steam injection


Adding steam injection to your RIMS chamber is a
fairly simple thing to do. There is an article in
the BT on line archives that explains how to make
a connection to the pressure cooker.  From there
I used 1/4" ID flexible ss ng gas line, the type
that is used for water heaters, to connect the
pcooker to the RIMS chamber (don't forge to
insulate the steam line, it gets very hot!). I
used valves on each end to control the steam
injection rate.


I don't think the steam is super heated at 10 psi,
I am sure it is still wet. The main factor which
determines your heating rate with steam is the
size of your mash, and the amount of energy used
to heat the pcooker.  The 2600W electric burner
I have been using can generate a temp increase
rate of 5 to 6 F/minute on a typical 50 gravity
mash.


You don't want to inject steam directly in the
mash bed as the localized heating of the husks
extracts bitter tannins into your wort - I have
already done this stupid brewer trick.

Hey Devon,


I've taken kegs on planes as checked baggage a number of times, and
carried on growlers, bottles, and a party pig. I've never been refused,
but sometimes clueless folk at the airport can be a bit frustrating.


Recommendations:


Wrap keg in cardboard, so it doesn't look so much like some kind of
'apparatus'. Attach a packing list stating what's inside (homemade beer,
for evaluation.)


Allow extra time for discussing the situation with airline agents and/or
security personnel, should they become interested. Be sure to point out
that hair spray, deodorant, etc are _flammable_ contents under pressure,
and they are routinely allowed on commercial flights; you're only 
bringing beer. Use your most polite voice.

I've been enjoying this discussion.  About a year ago I switched to the
continuous aeration/stirring method of starters.  I have to say that I'm very
pleased with the quality and quantity of the yeast I've been pitching.


I have to agree with Alan about the time factor of waiting for the yeast
to settle.  Yes, chilling can hurry the process but it can result in unfiltered
air getting into the starter if you just put your starter in the fridge without
keeping positive pressure in the starter container.  I typically don't chill
my starter.  It does take a little longer, but my work schedule allows me to
be fairly flexible with my brewing.  I usually try and time my starter so that
it would be ready the day before brewing.  There will still be plenty of
viable yeast and I ensure that as much of the yeast as possible has settled.

The pressure cooker will only reach a pressure that is 
equal to the back pressure in the path between
it and the injection point. This will naturally vary
according to the flow rate from the pressure cooker and the 
resistance to flow offered by the path through the tubing. 
Turn up the gas under the pressure cooker and the pressure 
will increase somewhat, all else being equal.


In my system, I have a pressure canner which has three 
Settings, 5, 10, and 15 psi. I set the rocker on the 
5 psi setting and when 5 psi is reached it will start to
rock a bit. I rarely see this unless I have the gas turned
up real high. I doubt that you will ever be able to get 
the pressure in the cooker up to 15 psi when the steam is
flowing into your process, unless you have an extremely 
small line carrying the steam.

My system has two paths for steam to flow. One is a steam 
dump into the HLT. The other is the line that feeds the 
steam into the recirculation line. My procedure is to 
normally leave the dump line open and get some good steam 
flow going [and expel air from the cooker as well] before 
starting steam injection into the wort. I should also 
mention that my pressure cooker is mounted above the 
injection point of the steam. The steam feed line loops 
over and down into the injection point of my recirculation 
line. If you do not have a way to close the steam line, 
wort will most certainly be drawn into the pressure cooker 
when it cools and the steam inside it condenses and creates 
a partial vacuum.


While operating, the pressure cooker will not lose it's push, but
it will reach a steady-state pressure which is a balance between
the heat input and the flow resistance of the feed line to 
your injection point.


I did a check when building my system to see how high the 
pump would push the wort when the system was operating 
normally. It was something less than six feet above floor level.
What I had planned to do was to loop my steam 
line high enough that the pump could not push the wort into 
the pressure cooker no matter what happened. However, with 
the system as it currently sits I have not needed to worry 
about this, as the pressure of the steam prevents any wort 
from getting into my feed line, and I shut the feed line 
valve when I am not injecting steam.


To start the injection into the recirculation line I 
partially close the valve in the dump line and at about the 
same time slowly open the valve in the feed line to the 
injection point.  After the feed line valve is all the way 
open I close the dump valve so all the steam is injected 
into the wort. The transition is smooth and I do have a 
problem with wort getting back into the feed line or into 
the pressure cooker. To stop injection I reverse this 
process.


Slight back pressure of about 5 psi means that steam 
temperature will be about 227 Deg. F. This has the added 
advantage of keeping the temperature of my insulated steam 
line above the condensation point of steam, so I do not get 
any condensate in my lines and do not experience any "water 
hammer" that I am aware of.


Mike Rose Mike_Rose`at`prodigy.net asks about the temperature 
of the injected steam:


>Regarding the recent thread on steam injection mashes or
>steam injected RIMS, ( NOT steam jacketed mash tuns )
>is the steam at 212F or 250F?


As I mentioned above, the steam temperature will be a 
function of the back pressure felt by the pressure cooker. 
212 Degrees F. is the temperature of steam at the moment it 
condenses into water. Something like 250 F. is the 
temperature at 15 PSI. In a system using a conventional 
pressure cooker with all the safeties in place, the 
temperature of the steam reaching the wort will be 
somewhere between these two limits.


Jeremy Bergsman <jeremybb`at`leland.Stanford.EDU is  
interested in steam injection into the mash itself. There 
have been some discussions on the HBD in the past and an 
article in Brewing Techniques several years ago about doing 
this exact thing. 


Jeremy Says:

The main concern seems to be excessive localized heating of 
the grains if some sort of mechanical mixing does not 
accompany the injection of the steam into the mash. I do 
not recall if anyone had tried injection into the mash 
while a rims pump was running. Since the concern Jeremy 
expressed is the slow, uneven rate of temperature "flow" 
downwards through his grain bed, I would be afraid of 
developing hot spots within the grain bed that would 
approach the boiling point of water, and/or at least 
temperatures much higher than desirable in the mash.


It is not always obvious at first look, but steam does not 
bubble through a cold liquid. Rather, it condenses 
immediately and turns to 212 deg. F. water while at the 
same time heating a good bit of water/material in the 
vicinity. With the grain bed restricting the ability of the 
heated water to move away by convection, the danger is that 
the liquid and grain mix in the vicinity of the injection 
point may overheat, unless there is some mechanical 
movement either of the injector or the grains.


About the only time you will see steam plumes, when steam 
is injected into water, is when the water is very near 
boiling temperatures. A neat little experiment is to put 
some cold water into a Pyrex flask and inject some steam 
into in. At first you will hear the noise of the steam 
collapsing dramatically. Then, as the water warms above 
normal mash out temperatures, things will quiet down 
substantially. As boiling point of the water in the flask 
is approached, steam plumes will start to form and the very 
little noise [if any, I did this over a year ago] will be 
apparent. Finally the water will be boiling in the flask, 
the steam plumes will have lengthened substantially, and 
the sound will be close to that of a pot of water simply 
boiling on a gas burner.


Steam is pretty neat stuff. But then so is electricity!

All true which is why I haven't done it yet.  However it would seem that the
RIMS pumping would provide some mixing (or else I wouldn't have this need). 
Also I was thinking that one might have an injection manifold in the mash
that distributed the steam around a bit.  Anyone play with anything like
this?

Subject: Budvar Malt


Mark Rose asked about mashing regimes for Budvar Undermodified Malt.


How many posts have been on the digest regarding mash schedules and
modification?  Thousand maybe.  How many books and articles refer to this
subject?  Budvar malt is the first malt in at lest the past decade that
allows brewers to directly address the questions and arguments and issues
raised in each and every one of those posts, articles, and books.  This is
why it is the most important new product in the last 10 years.


There are a host of mash schedules but I would refer people to any of the
good books on mashing such as George Fix's Analysis of Brewing Techniques,
Dave Millers books, Papazians books, Ray Daniels book.  My apologies for
leaving
off several others not to mention the numerous and excellent details
provided on the digest.


I will point out that what often is not emphasized enough is the
need to quickly move between temperature rests. Decoction has an advantage
here unless you have good burners (or use a thick mash to start and then
boiling
water, I think George Fix employs this method.


Ray Daniels' book (who is an excellent choice for Zymurgy and NB)
comes the closest to detailing Czech mashing.  I will
confess that I still don't know every detail because it is not as we think
of double decoction.


The Czechs actually use Double Decoction with rests at 38C, 50C, 65C, and
72C.  the key is to the make the first decoction quite large, use a portion
to get to 50C, the other portion to get to 65C.  Additionally, try boiling
the entire mash for 20 minutes after the 72C rest, then sparge.


But you can of course use more conventional step or decoction mashing as
practiced in other parts of Europe and detailed nicely in any of those books.


The most important rest for undermodified malt is the 50C one.  You could
for example, just do a two step, one at 50 the other at 65-70.


I consider Scott Abene's post to be immature and mean-spirited.

Eric Lande responded to my post on bitterness predictions from
first-wort hop additions.


>Unless someone can say without a doubt that the alpha acid will
>somehow magically disappear...


I greatly respect the opinions of some who have suggested that 
first-wort hops do not contribute a full measure of bitterness to the
beer, 
but this does seem counter-intuitive and I don't buy it. I've read some 
speculative explanations for why the utilization factor for FWH is
reduced 
but I'm not buying them either. Not yet, anyway. 


The summary of the Brauwelt article on Dave Draper's page gives the
measured IBUs for the experimental (FWH) beer and a control beer from
two German breweries. Unfortunately, not enough information is provided
about the hop schedules (amount and boil time) used for me to deduce the
utilization difference in FWH vs. early, middle, and late kettle
additions. What is reported is that the FWH beer had 4% (Brew A) and 20%
(Brew B) higher measured IBUs than the reference beers. The summary
further reports that the tasting panel preferred the FWH beers. The
authors recommended that you do _not_ reduce the total hop charge to
compensate for the higher utilization, speculating that the benefits of
FWH (to include, I suppose, the "fine and mild" bitterness" and good
"hop flavor impression") would be lost. Nowhere in the article summary
did I read that the first-wort hops demonstrated a reduced utilization
factor.

Then you have but one choice.  The JSP mill is the only one available with
stainless steel rollers, as a very expensive option, I might add.


Plating the rollers with chrome or nickel is only a cosmetic relief as the
plating quickly wears off in use.


Having said that, unless you live on Bermuda or Key West, your concern is
probably unfounded.  Once a mill is put into use, the dust on the rollers does a
pretty good job of inhibiting rust.  Mine has been in a breezy barn (my brewery)
for 5 years and several years in a damp basement before that and there is no
rust on the rollers at all.

I have been reading the RIMS and Steam Injection discussions with great 
interest. I have a one tier three vessel RIMS system. I am have tried nearly 
every method of heat exchange possible.
<snip>
The Counter-flow exchanger worked the best. The down side was the exchange

Terry et al.
I am in the process of designing my second HEMan RIMS system this winter and 
agree with Terry on the merits of the counter flow exchanger design. My 
present counter flow system works quite well and is not complicated. You can 
visit Big Fun Brewing at:


http://member.aol.com/bfbrewing/BigFunBrewing.htm


I was lucky enough to meet someone in the stainless tubing/pipe industry and 
found out that 24" long pieces of 20 inch diameter tubing/pipe are sometimes 
located on the scrap pile. I will be pushing my HERMS upper limit to 1/2bbl 
(15.5gal batches) with the ability to boil 18+ gal of wort in my new 24 gal 
brew kettle. These new vessels will also improve kettle and mashtun geometry. 
I will also avoid the step of adding cold water to top off the HLT volume 
after mash in. Once I hit my first rest temp, I can easily raise the temp of 
the HLT from 140F to 175-180F with the total water needed for heat transfer 
and batch sparge water.


The only mechanical change/addition that I plan on making is a gear motor 
stirring device in the HLT to help in the heat transfer between the exchange 
coil and the wort flowing through it. Presently I can achieve 2--2.5 degrees 
per min at the lower step temps and 1--1.5 degrees at mash out temps by 
stirring the HLT with a paddle with the heating loop open and the 
recirculation loop closed. The two separate loops in my system (heating and 
recirculation) have different flow rates. I want to keep the heat exchange 
loop as short as possible to keep flow rates as high as possible and still 
have acceptable temp boosts. 


I have found that the circulation rates/temp boosts vary with the type of 
recipe/grain used. The JSP Malt Mill, DWC pale ale malt and my RIMS are a 
great combo. I get a consistent 90-92% in recipes using that combo.


My last 10 gal batch of Weizen with 60% wheat malt, 35% 2 row, used (5%) 1 
lb. of rice hulls. I used Fix's 40-60-70C step mash and got 88% system 
efficiency (ProMash). Temp boosts during that batch were as listed above. 
Beer tastes great too!!


Up till now, I have overlooked the use of rice hulls to improve RIMS 
circulation rates and now plan on using the 5% rate as a regular recipe base 
ingredient in my new 15 gal. system.




Have Fun!

Jeremy, I have not built my system yet and I have yet to see anyone
implement my idea.  I saw what you see, a potential for much faster ramp
times that are limited by the grain bed.  I see this not as a laminar flow
problem but simple fluid flow resistance. If you pump more wort through the
grain bed you end up with bitter beer.  My answer, yet untested, was to have
a grain bed bypass.  A second port that would "rob" wort from above the
grain bed via an Easymasher or a Scrubbie Thingie and mix it with the grain
bed flow wort.  This would increase the flow to the heat exchanger without
increasing the actual grain bed flow.  This is also a system to help
increase ramps in dense grain bills like cereal mashes and barley wines.


The problem is verifying flow volume both through the bypass and through the
grain bed.  Since the total flow is split it would be difficult to verify
how much flow was actually passing through the grain bed.  It could be
possible lose your grain bed flow without knowing it.  Flow meters are
expensive and would pose a cleaning problem.  Simple flow meters won't hold
up to the temperature ranges and the sticky wort would probably be a problem
with the little balls.
