Subject: Iodophor


Hi Russ,
I generally use 1/2 ounce in 5 gallons (U.S.) for 12.5 ppm.  I let 
everything soak in this for at least 15 minutes.  I Fix's AoBT, he mentions 
a specific time for sanitizing agents (I can't remember the technical term) 
but similar to radioactive decay and drug pharmacokinetics you can 
mathematically predict when you've eliminated enough bugs and Fix 
recommends 15 min as a minimum contact time with this dilution.  I also use 
this rinse-free.  Hope this helps.

Subject: BTF iodophor




As long as the solution is amber it still works.  Plastic will absorb
the color - this includes buckets and hoses.  Hoses if soaked for long
periods (hours) will get "slimey".  With time this "slimey" will
disappear.  In an open plastic bucket the solution will last for 2-3
days.  Use cold water to mix solution.  Hot water will cause the
iodine to evaporate quickly.


Iodophor is a NO RINSE sanitizer.  That's one of the joys of iodophor.  
Keep an open bucket with a few gallons in it around during brewing
sessions.  Throw all the odds and ends in.  For utensils and such,
soak, shake off excess, use implement, return to sanitizer.  For
carboys, fill with solution (add iodophor, then fill with COLD water),
then let stand as long as you want, minutes to years.  Empty carboy,
let drip dry for about a minute, then use.


1/4 ounce in 2.5 gallons is 12.5 ppm.  Contact time is 2 minutes at
this strength.  Arithmetic will yield the amounts for any volume.  
Here's a useful conversion 1/10th ounce = 3 ml.


Here's more useful conversions:


1 Dash                 1/32 ounce        0.9 ml
1 Teaspoon        1/8 ounce        3.7 ml
1 Tablespoon        3/8 ounce        11.1 ml
1 Pony                1.0 ounce        29.5 ml
1 Jigger        1.5 ounce        44.5 ml
1 Wineglass        4.0 ounce        119 ml
1 Split         6.0 ounce        177 ml

Subject: beer and diet


Dave Burley posted a lengthy message yesterday on beer and various dietary
concepts. Unfortunately, much of this information was either misleading or
downright wrong. It would take far too much space (especially since much of
it is off-topic) and time to respond to all these inaccuracies so I won't
clog the digest by doing so. Much of this was hashed out earlier on the
digest and anyone who's really interested in the details can check them out
by searching the archives.


As far as beer goes, most of the calories are actually coming from the
ETHANOL not from residual carbohydrates (except for some of the sweeter
styles). Ethanol has more calories than either protein or carbohydrates,
almost as many as fat.


In general, the main factor in weight gain/loss is the balance between total
calories eaten versus total calories burned.

Subject: Cask ale from a corny


I'm about ready to take the logical next step in my
pursuit of the perfect ale: serving it from a cask.
The "cask" in this case will be a 5 gallon corny keg.
I have a rather promising ESB in the carboy and will
acquire the kegging setup this weekend. I can hardly
wait. 


My plan, at the moment, is to rig up something that
will hold the keg on its side, with the base elevated
slightly. Then serve via gravity dispense, with just
enough CO2 (how much?) to keep the oxygen out of the
beer (I know that CAMRA would disapprove, but I'm not
going to drink 5 gallons in a couple of days, no
matter how pleasant the thought, or the beer, may be).


So, all of you real ale fans out there who are serving
their ales from the "cask," Any tips or tricks you'd
like to pass along? Any gotchas I should be aware of?
Respond privately or to the digest as you see fit.
I'll post a summary of any private responses.

"Russ Hobaugh" asked the following about Iodophor:

One capful into 2.5 gallons makes a solution containing 12.5 ppm of
titratable iodine.


To make one gallon of working solution at 12.5 ppm add 3.75 ml, (a teaspoon
is 5 ml)


Recommended "contact time" is 60 seconds.


The working solution will "last" about 24 hours.. depends on many factors

Among other things in Dav'e message (eg, the "fact" that the body needs
loads of protein to prevent sagging faces) this is pure hogwash, with a
little bull malarkey thrown in.  The reason why an American hasn't won a
major marathon in the '90s has nothing to do with the high-carbohydrate diet
that elite athletes the world over eat.  We're just slower.  When we lose
marathons, we don't hit the wall.  We just don't finish as fast as the
average Kenyan.  Dave's "logic" is of the "If A happens in America, and B
happens in America, then A must be caused by B" type.  This type of logic is
what sets up myths for later de-bunking.  It's purely fault-ridden.


Also, if "the body is in a fat burning mode" there is absolutely no way to
sprint past those pesky Kenyans and win major marathons.  The body is much
more efficient at burning carbs than burning fat.  And, in fact, burns carbs
first when highly aerobic activity is involved.  That's why those 5 minute a
mile marathoners are sucking down Gatorade rather than raw eggs and
hamburger meat during their 2 hour marathons.  Btw, hitting the wall has
*something* to do with your body starting to burn fat, but more to do with
electrolyte imbalances due to sweating out sodium and other minerals.


Lastly, glycogen might well be stored in the liver, but is also stored
locally in muscle tissue.

I believe 1/4 oz in 2.5 gallons is 12.5 ppm iodine.


> I was told to use either 12.5 ppm or 25 ppm,

I don't time the soak; I just throw all my stuff into a bucket of Iodophor
when I start, and leave it soaking until I need it.  Except for carboys,
which I rinse out with Iodophor solution, invert, and allow to drip-dry.


> Also, how much
> would I use just to mix up a gallon at a time.  


Just scale accordingly... should be 2/5 capful for 12.5 ppm (just eyeball
it). 


> And finally, how long
> does this last.  I have only used One-step up until now, but found

The iodine seems to evaporate after a day or two.  Keeping it tightly
covered should prolong the shelf life.


 ...and, regarding Scotch Ale recipes:

Is it just me, or are there others who have *never* gotten a smoky
character from 1728?  If this yeast is in fact capable of producing a
smoky character, it must be at temperatures I don't normally ferment at. 
(I typically ferment ales in the mid- to high-60s.)

>From Dave Burley's rather long message:


"Carbing up" before a long race is why
an American hasn't won a marathon in decades
and "hits the wall" when the glycogen (small 
amount of stored carbs in the liver) runs out.
If the body is in a fat burning mode, through
utilization of a low carb diet,  there is 
ample body fat to carry a runner through a 
marathon, even if he is skinny.


That's a wild, speculative statement.  I think it has more to do with 
genetics and numbers than that.  Isn't is harder to burn fat anyways? 
I do agree that "carbing up" is overrated, but that is well 
established.  Also, the suppliments I take during a race have carbs in 
them, and they seem to help.


You go on about "Avoid this, eat that".  That always bugs me.  I'm a 
believer in moderation and eating too much of anything isn't healthy.
I hate the demonizing of food.  It does more harm than good.  Knowing 
what goes into your body and knowing how to eat properly is a skill 
that isn't taught much in this country.  Too many people look 
for "silver bullets" for g gd health.  It's fairly simple.  Have a well
rounded diet and regular excersise.  This hasn't changed.  Your health 
reasons for diabetes might be true, but that doesn't apply to me.  (No 
family history of it.)


Now before I get further off topic, beer can be fattening due to 
carbs.  If you take too much, the body needs some place to store it.  
Of course, too much of anything is a bad thing.  Someone mentioned 
calories, but that is true of any soda you drink as well.


I just have my one a night and that's usually it.

IMO Corny kegs and CO-2 tank are much better but are more expensive and
will require a lot more room in the fridge. 


When using 5 ltr kegs you should be aware of a few things: 


1. Fill level is critical for a consistent carbonation. 
2. Over carbonating will cause kegs to bulge.
3. Seals sometimes  leak - a little glycerine on the rubber helps to
prevent this.
4. Sanitization requires a bit of care espescially drying. 5. They have a
limited life.


Being aware of the above and taking some care should allow you to get good
use from 5 ltr kegs

Subject: can I ferment lager at 45 degrees? 


I want to make a lager but my brother's fridge is in his cold garage.  
The highest temperature it can maintain is 45 degrees F.  I would use 
WyEast Bohemian Lager (#2124).  I've used this yeast with good results 
at 55 degrees.  I'll be brewing with him over the holidays.  We don't 
have time/energy to make a heating apparatus to get the fridge temp up.  
Thus, my only question is:    Can I ferment a decent lager at 45 degrees?

Subject: Fresh Eggs


I enjoyed the scientific dissertation on hard boiled eggs.  Unfortunately, it
was all for naught because, as someone we all know and love  once said, "it
depends on what your definition of the word is, is.  In this case is, is the
word fresh.


Prior to discovering the dehydrator trick, I had found that if fresh eggs were
kept in the fridge for 30 days, the peelability is about 7 on the 1-10 scale.
For 100% pealability, it took about 3 months.


As I am starting with and defining as "fresh", eggs that are still warm from the
hen, this information says more about how fresh store eggs are than about the
process for cooking them.


Bottom line is, if you have no trouble peeling "Fresh Grade A Eggs", they have
probably not been "warm" for several months, at the minimum.

Nature of the RIMS. With a RIMS, you don't know whether you have
homogeneous mash temperature (unless you use a mixer). My SHMS allows
complete control over the mash temp with no question what the the mash
temp is and also the temperature boosts are quick and precise.

Subject: 5 Liter Minikegs


Someone with an absurd name posted the following:


<Has anybody had any experience with these things? I was planning on
purchasing some, but there seem to be problems with leaking taps and
warping
of the kegs.>


I happen to have an interest in these kegs.  They are a great size for
homebrewing, but until recently the above problems usually made them a
disapointment.  The warping problem - technical term "boinking" - would
usually cause the kegs to self distruct.  For about a year now we have 
been
producing a product called "Phil's Relieph Bung" that is a conventional
minikeg bung modified with a pressure relief valve which vents at a
pressure about half that required to "boink."  It is an inexpensive
investment to protect your investment in the keg itself.


The German taps leak and are very fragile.  Going to the higher priced
metal one only gives you a somewhat less fragile tap - it still leaks. 


Check out the "Philtap" at listermann.com.  It is very durable and, if I
did my work well, should not leak.  Further it will work sideways as well


as vertically for low height requirements.  This gives it high spousal
acceptability as it easily fits into any fridge, even on a lower shelf.
