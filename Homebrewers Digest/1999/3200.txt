Try a shop or store that specializes in bolts and fasteners. (see yellow

Subject: mash tannins


I think that this topic falls into the category of 'mommily'. Tannins 
from the mash is something I often heard poeple say. 
 It is very difficult to extract tannins from the grain hulls in a mash. 
In fact I'm not sure that I've ever see it done. The ph of the mash is 
the limiter. It is however quite possible to extract tannins from hops 
(much more soluble than husk tannins) in the boil and possibly if they 
were put in the mash as well.

Subject: Tannins/Efficiency


Dean asks about why a high liquid to grist ratio would improve
dissolution of tannins. Lots of liquid improves the dissolution of
anything. A teaspoon of sugar will dissolve faster in a gallon of water
than it will in a cup. Other factors are, of course, temperature and pH
(talking of tannins now).


After my musing of the previous post I did recheck the two lagers I
still have in the freezer. In once case the polyphenols actually went up
some (298 to 396) which is most interesting as this beer (a fest) has
developed a hot, smokey taste as it ages. Wild yeast?  The other, a
pilsner, read about 1000 mg/L and has, after 6 months lagering, fallen
back to about 400. It is noticeably smoother now.

For DawgDoctor:


Your collected specific gravity of 1.042 corresponds to 10.47P which
implies that your wort contains 0.91 pounds of extract per gallon. Seven
gallons of extract gives you a total of 6.37 pounds and as you used a
total of 11.5 pounds of grain that's 6.37/11.5 = 0.554 or 55.4%
efficiency which isn't that great but considering that 30% of your grist
is stuff that doesn't yield that much perhaps it isn't too surprising.
I have only used Maris Otter once and got a very disappointing 62%
kettle efficiency from it (whereas DWC Pale Ale malt usually gives me a
little over 70%). I attributed this to my lack of experience with it.
The berries are much smaller than those of the DWC and I did not reset
my mill to account for this - didn't even notice it till I saw the
extraction I had acheived.


Note that I'm using the ratio of weight of extract to weight of grain as
the definition of efficiency. There are other schemes out there in which
you are told that Maris Otter, for example, should give you, say, 30
points per pound per gallon. If you realize 28 then you call the
efficiency 28/30 = 93.3%. I haven't seen anyone use this system recently
but always suspect it is being used when I see claims of 80% and higher.

Subject: CO2 and Handpumps




Some of the solutions seem a little complicated.  All I do is set the regulator
to about 5 psi, but I keep the shutoff valve in the off position.  When I want
a beer, I turn the valve on, pull a pint, then shut the valve off, and finally
vent the keg.  No outside air can get in, and the only time the beer sees 
"pressure" is during the pull.

What is the fermentable content of candi?  Have heard it was about 25% of
 the
crystal weight.  Also what is its actual color contribution.  The color
contributed by a pound of 250 SRM candi is nothing at all like the 
equivalent
contribution of say a pound of chocolate.

Hi All,


A family member uses two devices for supplemental oxygen.  One is a
concentrator that produces enriched oxygen air at low pressure.  It could be
nearly pure oxygen.  The costly unit might be available as low cost salvage
equipment?


The other supply is a small portable oxygen breather tank.  Each has a
regulator and three hours of oxygen exhausted at 3 liters/minute.  Seems
like it would be sufficient for a life time of home brewing?  Leasing these
refillable tanks with regulator from a medical supply house like "Roberts"
might be a practical solution for some.

Subject: RIMS false bottom


Hi,


This post is intended for brewers interested in using converted Sanke like
kegs for mash/lauter tuns in a RIMS like system.  Just for the record, the
following is my opinion.  Thus, I don't consider use of converted Sanke kegs
as boil pots or mash/lauter tuns to be inexpensive or appropriate for RIMS
like systems.  With a properly selection of SS vessels, stirring mechanisms
and critically designed false bottoms would be moot.


Acceptable false bottoms are dependant on the design of the system.  For
some, a short section of SS screen formed into a tube might be perfect.  For
others, a slotted plastic or copper pipe might be adequate.  The important
consideration that seems to be missing in most discussions is the amount of
the malt charge vrs. the open area of the false bottom.  The achieves might
be replete with discussions of false bottom open area.  The rectangular
picnic cooler could have near 200 inches of open area when used for a RIMS
like system.  A typical Sanke keg false bottom has less than 100 square
inches of open area.


My experience is that recirculation changed most everything developed for
picnic cooler like gravity fed mash/lauter false bottoms.  Recirculation
requires massive false bottom open area.  The usual high flow through the
mash and the limited open area promotes a stuck mash!  Modern magnetic drive
pumps are very strong pumpers and can develop static pressure high enough to
boil liquid at normal saccharification and mash out temperatures.


As a historical false bottom loser, I must protest the use of stand off type
false bottoms for RIMS applications in conjunction with a Sanke keg
conversion.  Take it from me that I tried most every design I could think
of.  Fine SS screen, 10X10 monster SS screen, drilled SS sheet, etc.  I
tried substantial bracing under the post supported false bottom where the
support looked more like a many spoke wagon wheel than a false bottom - all
collapsed under hydrostatic pressure of the pump.  Hours of manual stirring
or transferring 25 pounds of mash and 8 gallons of liquid to a direct fired
mash tun ain't my idea of a pleasant brew day!


Eventually, I took the advice of a brewing mentor and purchased the
Precision Brewing Systems false bottom from Brew America in Arlington, VA.
This punched hole SS plate is stamped and cut to accurately fit the bottom
of a Sanke keg.  Thus, the edge is inherently strong due to the shape of the
stamping and it's thickness.  I added a center support that made the false
bottom capable of with standing the static pressure force if the mash
becomes stuck.  Which can happen when there isn't adequate stirring to clear
the false bottom while maintaining full flow through the system.  A great
representation of what I'm advocating is currently illustrated in the
Advanced Brewing Technology advertisements in Zymurgy.  There, you see the
false bottom and clearly the pipe union center support.  You'll note also
that the mixing paddle is shaped to fit the false bottom.  ABT might sell
just the false bottom.  I can't emphasize enough the necessity of
maintaining the liquid flow at the maximum that the system plumbing allows
when the heat exchanger is ON.  Low flow rate promotes scorching of the
carbohydrate on a heating element it is exponential.  A small amount of
scorching (carbon) insulates the element and allows a hot spot to develop.
Then, the hot spot picks up more stuff to carbonize.  Eventually large
sections of the heating element are covered with burned wort.  The brew will
always have the scorched wort flavor!  Unless a brewer designs a mash tun
with an open area of more than 200 square inches for 15 to 20 pounds of
malt, some type of manual or mechanized stirring is essential to allow full
flow at all times the heat is ON.


My system has a better design than most because my supply enters the bottom
of the tun and is exhausted into the mash through a motor driven copper pipe
mixing shaft.  The return comes from under the false bottom.  This give me
optimized mixing, rapid ramps between rests, small temperature range through
the mash, and a reduced potential for hot side aeration.  I'm questionably
able to provide pictures and a schematic of my RIMS like mash/lauter tun to
interested brewers.  My system isn't the best, worst, or the only a workable
single level system.  I do know that it works and has overcome most of the
failures encountered over nearly 10 years of RIMS use.


SHOULD NEW BREWERS FORGET THE USE OF CONVERTED SANKE KEGS AND SPEND THE
BUCKS FOR PROPER POTS?


MOST CERTAINLY!

Subject: grain bed temperature distribution


Greetings!


        I have a mashing question for the group. I do (mostly) single and
multi-step infusion mashes with a HERMS system of my own design, in which I
pump liquid wort from the bottom of the grain bed, through a copper coil
that is immersed in the HLT to heat it up. The return is  3/8" vinyl tubing,
set just below the top of the grain. I have been using it for two years now
and am happy with it, and think I brew some pretty good beer. I have been
struggling with temperature control of the grain bed for some time, however.
The control is manual. I monitor the temperature with a fixed dial
thermometer set at the middle of the bed, and I use ball valves to control
flow through the coil.  
        
        This past weekend, while brewing a 10 gallon batch, I used a digital
thermometer (correctly calibrated) I borrowed from work to try to get better
data to work with. I was shocked at the temperature differentials in the
grain bed, which were up to 14 degrees F (142 -156 F, with the HLT temp
170F), depending on where I was around the bed, even when just recirculating
with no heat addition (I allowed 10 minutes of this to allow the temps to
stabilize). 
        
        I have two questions: 1) Is this a big problem, or do the various
enzyme reactions all "even out" to make everything ok? 2) Should I try to
stir the grain bed while running the pump and adding heat to even things
out, even though this seems to me to be extra work that I would like to
avoid? Not having to mess with stirring was a big reason for building the
recirc system.


        I am going to make a better distribution header/nozzle thing for the
wort return, figuring that will help, but any other advice is appreciated.

Subject: US state alcohol laws 


A long time ago, I visited the Jack Daniels distillery.  The tour
guide told us that the county (Boone?) in which the distillery is
located is dry.  Furthermore, he related, the population of the county
was not large enough to vote the county wet -- even if all the voters
voted in favor of "wet" status, it would not exceed a minimum set in
the TN state law.


Well, when Bob Devine posted to the HBD a URL for state alcohol
regulations (http://www.law.cornell.edu/uniform/vol9.html#consb), I
decided to check out the situation.  The URL (broken into
several lines to keep the HBD software happy) 
    http://www.lexislawpublishing.com/sdCGI-BIN/om_isapi.dll?
      clientID=1257&hitsperheading=on&infobase=tncode.NFO&
      record={2F809}&softpage=Document
contains the rules for the "local option" elections.  It appears that
the guide's story was not strictly true, but there are enough weird
restrictions in the law that I think it probably was true in spirit.
Check out some of this wording:


    In those counties wherein are located municipalities which have a
    population equal to or greater than the smallest county in Tennessee
    by the federal census of 1960 or by any succeeding federal census, or
    any municipality having a population of one thousand seven hundred
    (1,700) or more persons according to the 1960 federal census in which
    at least fifty percent (50%) of assessed valuation of the real estate
    in the municipality consists of hotels, motels, and tourist courts and
    accommodations, as shown by the tax assessment rolls or books of the
    municipality, ...


How many counties do you suppose that applied to when the law was
passed?  Anyone want to bet on "ONE"? :-)


Here's another one:


        Except in counties having populations of:  




            not less than       nor more than
            ------------        -------------

                23,500             24,000
                65,000             70,000


        according to the 1970 federal census or any subsequent
        federal census, the voters of any municipality in this state
        which has been incorporated under a general or special law
        or laws of this state for five (5) years or longer and which
        has a population of nine hundred twenty-five (925) or more
        persons according to the federal census of 1970 or any
        subsequent federal census, except in municipalities with a
        population of not less than one thousand two hundred thirty
        (1,230) nor more than one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250)
        according to the 1970 federal census or any subsequent
        federal census, in any county having a population of not
        less than thirteen thousand five hundred (13,500) nor more
        than thirteen thousand six hundred (13,600) according to the
        1970 federal census or any subsequent federal

While Home Depot can have good prices and a lot of large stuff, when it
comes to many things like washers a plain old hardware store usually has a
better variety. Look for a good larger hardware store (I use Marshall's
Industrial Hardware in San Diego) for all kinds of stainless steel washers,
nuts, bolts etc.


As for teflon washers, I went to a local plastics supplier that carried
teflon sheets (call ahead) I bought a single square foot from the scrap bin
and basically have a lifetime supply. I cut my own washers out of the sheet
to the size I needed.

Subject: Samson's Crystal Pilsener


Hello all,


I purchased my first bottle of Samson Brewery's Crystal Pilsener this
weekend, and absolutely loved it.  Before this bottle, Pilsener Urquell
porvided my only other example of true Czech Pilseners.  I found Crystal to
be a bit drier than P.U., more like a German Pils, and it had a spicey
character I really enjoyed.


Has anyone had any success trying to brew a version of this beer, and if
so, would you kindly share your recipe and process?  Perhaps Dr. Pivo could
provide some helpful advice, as this seems to be an area with which he is
very familiar.  Can I come close without using Czech malt?  Right now my
plan is to double decoct a German Pilsener malt mash (OG 1.052), using a
40C/60C/70C temperature profile, with 40 IBUs from Czech Saaz flowers, and
Wyeast Czech Pils yeast in a one-gallon starter.  


Cheers,

Subject: Boiling yeast starter


Made a yeast starter today, WYEAST Bavarian Wheat #3056.  Made the first
step to 500mL in a 1000mL Erlenmeyer flask.  Instead of boiling outside on
my 35K Camp
Chef cooker I boiled inside on the electric range.  My question, is it safe
to place the flask directly on the electric element or did I just get lucky
today.  Thanks for all public and private responses.
