Subject: Russ hobaugh's ESB questions


There are a number of things that could have gone wrong with your brew to
get such a low extraction rate.  When you mashed in at 153, was that the
temp of the water you infused with, or was that the actual mash temperature
after infusion (correct answer)? Did the mash stay at this temp? Did you
monitor your mash temp and stir every few minutes?  If your temperature
dropped below about 145 degrees, you would not get a good conversion either
I don't think.  Insulating your mash tun would help maintain constant temps.
You didn't say how much water you mashed in with, I think if you used more
than 2 qts/lb, the mash was maybe too thin to get a good conversion.  Since
this is your first all grain, did you mix up the water with the grains well
so that there would be no 'dry' spots in the mash?  Sort of rambling here as
ideas come to mind.....I assume you got precrushed malt, and if not is the
crush good?  Maybe the malt had been allowed to absorb moisture before you
used it and is 'slack' malt which doesn't give good extraction.  I don't
know what kind of conditions your seller of malt subjects the  malt to.
(Believe it or not there are actually still stores out there that keep malt
in bins that you just scoop out what you want and this is a really bad
idea!)  


I think 75% extraction is pretty average for most brewers doing a simple
infusion mash, and I have gotten up to 93% via decoction mashing and using a
picnic cooler.  (No flames about extraction rates please, I am using the
Suds program to give me efficiency, so if you think that is wrong then so am
I).  Anyway, yes you can use more grains to compensate or, do your mash, get
the wort in the kettle and take a gravity reading, then add some Dry malt
extract to bring you up to desired gravity.  I keep about 3 to 6 lbs. of dry
malt extract on hand for just such 'emergencies'.


I don't know the AA % of your hops, but the lower gravity than planned will
make the beer unbalanced on the bitter side.  The bitterness will decrease
with age.  Oh, also you didn't mention whether the hops were pellets or
whole hops.  If a recipe calls for an ounce of whole hops, you need to
reduce the pellets by 15% to be equivalent.


Hope my ramblings help,

First, I am not sure how you are figuring that you are only getting 55% 
efficiency.  For a little over 10 pounds of grain contributing to the 
sugar content of your wort, a specific gravity of 1.042 works out to 
about 28.35 points per lb per gallon ((42 points*6.75 gallons) / 10 
pounds).  This is a completely respectable extraction rate, especially if 
this one of your first batches and you are using a 
zapap-style home made device.


The most you can get from most grains is in the neighborhood of
34 to 36 points per pound per gallon (ppppg) (I am relying on memory
from the Zymurgy Great Grains issue, so I might be off a little).  
Anyway, dividing your ppppg of 28.35 by the most you can possibly 
get (35 ppppg - average value) gives you an efficiency of over 
80 percent, not bad.  Remember that the numbers given for 100 
percent extraction (34 to 36 ppppg) are ultimate extraction rates 
and are only achievable  in a laboratory.  (In other word 
you will never get 100 percent efficiency, so dont even try).


What you probably did is collect too much wort. I am saying 
this because the recipe that you cite is probably 
based on a 5-gallon batch.  If you would have boiled the wort down 
to 5 gallons you would have ended up with an S.G. of about 1.056.  
Which puts you above you target.  Your extraction is fine.


>What is an "average" extraction rate (if there is such a thing)?


28 ppppg is fine, 30 is better.  Consistently 
over 30 is outstanding (or the person is lying about their extraction
rates - which happens more than you think).

Lord help us all - another potential Rube Goldberg in the making!  
Please dont buy a RIMS.   Be content with what you are doing 
and keep going.  Maybe add a little extra grain next time or try
boiling the wort a little longer to concentrate the sugars that you 
collected.  Your numbers show that you extraction is perfectly o.k.  
And, it will only get better with additional practice. 


My only question is why are you starting with distilled water and 
DME?  Use tap water.

        It seems as if on the 13th of January there will be an auction of
everything in the Henry brewery in Portland.  It looks like they have a
bunch of stuff to get rid off.  You can look at the stuff on www.rabin.com

HEALTH AND MEDICINE FROM THE MEDBRIEF


* A recent study suggests that moderate alcohol intake may be
   associated with a reduced risk of Type II diabetes in men.
     - researchers at the Cooper Institute in Dallas, Texas,
       studied Type II diabetes rates in more than 8,500 Texan
       men to collect data.
     - found that men who consumed 5-10 alcoholic drinks per
       week were at significantly lower risk of developing
       diabetes, compared to either abstainers/infrequent
       drinkers or heavy drinkers; overall, infrequent or
       heavy drinkers were at about twice the risk of Type
       II diabetes, compared to moderate drinkers.
     - authors note that previous studies have suggested that
       moderate drinking reduces insulin resistance, in which
       the body becomes less responsive to the sugar-hoarding
       effect of the hormone insulin.
     - the study concludes that up to 24% of incident cases of
       diabetes in adult men may be attributable to high alcohol
       intake.
     - the study is in the journal Diabetes Care (2000;23:18-22).

Subject: Help needed on All Grain


Hi Russ,


First of all, you don't need a RIMS to get decent extractions.  Although I
haven't used the Zap-Zap, I'm confident that your process is OK.


Being blunt, your statements regarding water treatment seem way off base?
You might consider doing a little reading in any home brewing text.


 .  .  ."Water treatment: distilled water with 1 tsp. of DME/gallon"  .  .  .


I have no reservations about bumping the sg up with sucrose when the pre
boil doesn't attain the desired sg.  Or, boiling longer to a smaller volume
to accomplish the same thing.


Your statement about water treatment suggests that you don't have an
elementary understanding of the chemistry of mashing and sparging, only the
mechanical process.  There's been a lot of discussion, when you can find it
among the non-brewing issues, of pH of sparge water and tannin extraction.
Not so much to improve the extraction, but to choose a flavor that's
acceptable in the finished beer.  Not too astringent, not too thin, not too
 .  .  .  You'll note that extraction efficiency isn't of much importance to
the home brewer.  If it happens and the brew turns out great, whoopeeeee!
Consider the posts concerning "No Sparge" techniques.


I recommend that you get any one of the several Fix's books and read up on
the chemistry involved.  There are other equally good texts available.
However, the reference must have a section on water treatment.  Another on
mashing, and another on sparging.  Specifically, study the influence of the
calcium ion in the mash,  why distilled water is only a good idea to dilute
water components, and what the pH of the sparge water should be.  e.g.
Distilled water may have a pH of near 7 and not have sufficient acidity to
overcome the undesirable effects of other mash components to keep the mash
pH below 5.5.


It's my understanding that the mash must be at the optimum temperature and
pH to obtain a reasonable conversion over a reasonable time.  When these
conditions are met, the saccharification can be complete within 15 minutes
and not more than 30 minutes at each rest.  The rest temperatures determine
the fermentability of the wort.   When the mash is pH and calcium content
are not met, then the efficiency of the saccharification is poor.  BTW, you
must know the malt specifications to compensate for variances in the degree
of modificaton of protein and starch.


Finally,  consider that each home brewer's system has an inherent extraction
efficiency.  It's my gadget frame of mind that resulted in use of a
mechanically stirred RIMS.  Most home brewers might admit that meeting the
temperature, pH, and calcium content of the mash are more important than the
type of system employed for all grain brewing.

Subject: RE: AOB/AHA Representation - For REAL??


Rob Wallace asks "A controlling or influencing 'say' or just a "say"...???"
plus other remarks omitted.  For those of you who have not sat as a board
member, the answer is that the Board of Directors has the responsibility to
run the organization, For Profit Corporations or Not For Profit ones.  The
Chairman of the Board does have a great deal of power, however as the leader
of the BOD.  But not absolute, as some corporate Chairmen have discovered
when they have been removed by their boards recently.  Could the AOB board
replace Charlie?  Yes.  But that's not the issue really is it?  The real
issues the board has to wrestle with are it's financial stability and
meeting the needs of the members so that the membership can grow.  The
changes to the AOB board in most likelihood would not be being made if it
weren't for Charlie's desire to make the AOB/AHA more meaningful to its
members and more viable going forward.  No board member in good conscience
would join a board simply to "dethrone" anyone.  One participates and works
to make the organization the best that it can be.  If in the process it
becomes necessary to make difficult personnel decisions, then there's a
responsibility to do so.  But that's not the objective that the members (or
non-members) have unless they are just carrying grudges.  So if anyone wants
to become part of the process, join the AHA, run for one of the seats on the
Advisory Board that will be up for election by the members, and work for the
betterment of the organization.  The Advisory Boards will then elect from
its ranks members who will then join the AOB Board of Directors where
further contributions to the organization can be made.

UPS will ship hazardous cargo, provided you are not a

See www.ups.com for specifics, but as most of us would
be one time customer, this would eliminate using UPS. 
You could relieve all pressure remove the regulator

acceptable for UPS shipment.

I've seen this before, but never believed it.  Gasses just don't
behave that way.  BUT...  Is the CO2 a gas?  Probably not.


CO2 can be a liquid below 88F, so at normal room temperature, a
significant amount of the CO2 in the tank is probably liquified.  The
nitrogen is still a gas, so there would be some separation in the
tank.


For the science geeks: the critical point of CO2 is at 87.9F / 1070.6
PSIA.  If the pressure in the tank is 1200PSI, as Pat Babcock
indicated, then up to 87.9F, conditions are right in the tank for CO2
to condense to a liquid.

Subject: Thirsty for knowledge




I recently brewed my first batch of extract and
specialty grains using unhopped malt extract. I
have two questions:


After reading some on the subject I was hoping
someone could enlighten me on the subject of water
treatments.  I use filtered water that removes
99% of all the chlorine, etc from the water.  Is
this enough or should I look to water treatments
as a potential way to increase the quality of the
beer?


Second, after brewing my first batch with hops and
specialty grains I was left with about a quart
and a half that just would not settle out.  The
specific gravity of the four and a quarter
gallons was right on 1.050, which the recipe
called for, and I did not want to top off to five
gallons and dilute the beer.  I just cried my
eyes out while dumping the green slop down the
drain.  Is there a good way to recover any wort
that is stuck in there?  A filter?  A funnel? Does
one work better than the other? Can you actually
recover any wort without letting in a lot of the
hop residue?  Or is it just better to cut your
losses and dump it?

Fred Kingston took me to task for writing (among other things):

and then posting my opinions about the subject.  I am afraid he has me
there.  I actually wrote the later post earlier but it was bounced
several times for excessively long lines and by the time it was
corrected it came in after my post saying we should get back to
brewing.  That is an excuse but it was still inconsistent of me to try
to put my two cents worth in then later suggest everyone else shut up on
the subject.  Mea culpa.


NOW, lets get back to brewing.  Or am I being inconsistent again?

Well I used my new JSP MALTMILL the other day and made a stout.  It worked
great but I want to motorize it as the 19.5 pounds of grain took a little
while to mill.  Can anyone tell me what the optimum speed is and what

Seems to me that the hops were in the wort in the kettle so there should be
no difference in the SG from the kettle to the fermenter.  Loss to hops
sounds suspect to me IMO.

Subject: Comments on B-Brite


Just thought I would jump in and post my personal results with
attempting to use B-brite as a sanitizer.


During my first few batches, I was plagued with almost constant off
flavors while using B-brite as a sanitizer.  The problem was so large,
that I was about ready to give up homebrewing - I just couldn't seem to
brew a beer that tasted good.  A post to HBD on the subject yielded
comments that B-brite was not an "official" sanitizer.


I switched to Iodophor, and my off flavor problems immediately
disappeared!!


YMMV, of course, but I obviously have something in the house that is
resistant to B-brite.  I think it's great as a cleaner though....no
affiliation....yada, yada.

You cannot ship a cylinder containing CO2.  It's quite alright to ship an
empty one via UPS.


Also, there is no problem with transporting a full cylinder when its laying
down, UNLESS it was just filled and is cold.  this can cause an ice plug to
form in the neck which can result in blowing out the safety relief valve.

Subject: Hop Teas - Again


Before we flamed up over GMO's and how fat a carrot could get in a year (or
something like that) there was a discussion going on concerning hop teas for
flavor/aroma additions.  If I could return us all to that golden day of
yesteryear, I had a thought and was wondering if anyone has done the
following yet.


I bottle using a bottling/priming bucket.  My routine is to boil the 4 or 5
ounces of corn sugar in two cups of water, add the still boiling mixture to
the bucket and then rack into the bottom of the bucket through the drum tap.
This seems to adequately mix the priming solution into the green beer, and
lets me pretend to myself that I am oxidizing the beer as little as
possible.  After the beer is racked, I take the racking cane out of the
fermentor, swap the end to the bottling tip and lift the now primed beer
onto the counter over the dishwasher door that I use as a bottling platform
and go to town.  No muss, no fuss.


I was wondering if there was a downside to throwing a hop plug or two into
the sugar/ water solution while boiling to sanitize.  Questions:


    1)    How long do you steepers steep your hop tea before it's done?


    2)    Do you use a regular kitchen strainer to separate tea from hops?
Is there an
            oxidation problem with this?


    3)    Must you steep below boiling temps or is boiling O.K. (seems safer
from a
            sanitation perspective)?


    4)    Is there a downside to boiling hops in a sugar solution (i.e.
change the molecular
            nature of the sugar such as to limit carbonation, off flavors,
etc.)?


As you can tell, I'm a lazy brewer (answer to "what type of brewer are you"
from another previous thread) and want to combine as many steps as possible.


Now to return us to the GMO thread - has anyone considered that yeast have
been genetically modifying us for thousands of years?  Think about it!

Subject: Mash Efficiency Questions


After lurking and learning for the past 4 years or so, I've finally finished my
3 vessel RIMS and brewed the first two batches.  Now come the questions ;^)


The efficiency of the system varied dramatically between the two batches and I'm
wondering why?


The first batch was 10 gallons.  I wanted to make a Scottish Ale, Light 60 and
used the following grain bill:


15# Beeston's Golden Promise Scottish Ale - 1.027 potential gravity
3# Crystal 55L - 1.022 PG
3# Caramel 40L - 1.031 PG
0.5# Chocolate - 1.022 PG


Mash schedule was 20 min `at` 104; 20 min `at` 122; 30 min `at` 140; 30 min `at` 158; 10 min
`at` 172; sparged with 6 gallons at 170. The pH at the end of the acid rest was
5.3.  Topped off to ~ 11 gallons and boiled for 60 minutes.


Anticipated OG was 8.23P, but actually yielded a 14.6 Plato measured after the
boil was chilled, which was about 100% efficiency if I calculated it correctly.
I was estimating 75% efficiency, so this batch turned out quite a bit stronger
than I expected.  Not exactly a Light 60!




So, on to batch two.  Thinking I was on to something I estimated 100% efficiency
for this batch.  Used the following grain bill to make an American Brown Ale:


13# Schreier Pale 2-row  1.035 PG
1.5# Munich  1.035 PG
1.5# Crystal 55L  1.022 PG
1.5# Cara Pils  1.032 PG
0.5# Chocolate  1.022 PG


Mash schedule was 30 min `at` 104; 30 min `at` 140; 30 min `at` 156; 10 min `at` 168; sparge
with 6 gallons at 170. The pH at end of acid rest was 5.5. Topped off to ~ 11
gallons and boiled for 75 minutes.


Anticipated OG was 14.65P, but this yielded only an 8.12 Plato after the boil
was chilled, which is a 55% efficiency.  Quite a difference from the efficiency
of the first batch!


Is there that much difference in efficiency between grain bills, mash schedules,
etc?

My experience and others indicates that
poor milling is most often the reason for
poor extraction, given reasonable grist and
mashing conditions. In my experience, HB 
stores routinely grind too coarsely because
it's fast. And if you buy more malt ......


Take a look at the volumes of information
on milling in the HBD archives.


A RIMS won't help but a good adjustable
mill will do wonders if you double crush
at ~0.080 in. and ~ 0.060 in. See detailed
instructions in the archives. If you eventually
want to do RIMS, a proper milling with free
flow in the mash is the critical parameter.

Subject: Acadian Brewing closes


Residents and beer-savvy visitors to New Orleans will be sad to hear that
Acadian Brewing is closing.  The best craft brewer in Louisiana by my
reckoning, Acadian brewed and bottled a pilsner and a marzen.  The brewery
also produced a helles bock available only on tap.  The brewing community
here is a bit surprised by the news; about a year ago, Acadian increased
production significantly with the purchase of some new fermentation and
lagering tanks.  The word on the street, however, is that Acadian had, from
the outset, suffered from the absence of a money guy.  Neither brewmaster
Doug Lindley nor president Jim Cronin, a neurobiologist, has extensive
business experience.  Rumors about the specific causes of the brewery's
demise pretty much run the gamut.  Only a few facts seem clear:  regulars at
the brewery's beer garden and other commercial brewers in the city were
stunned to find a sign on the door announcing the closure and a list of
brewing equipment for sale, and the brewery appears to be out of beer,
leading most to assume that the brewmaster and the president planned ahead
for closure.  My guess it that Acadian falls into that saddest of category
of attrition, the visionary brewing operation undone by lack of
entrepreneurial experience.

Subject: How do you measure your SG


I have a nifty thing in my "brew house."  I took ~3' of 1/2" copper pipe,
put an end cap on one side and something like a 1/2" sweat / 3/4" FPT on the
other end.  The volume of this device is enough to float my hydrometer in
its test flask, the sweat adaptor is a bit of a funnel.


You can probably see where this is going.  I brew outside.  On a hose bib I
have mounted another device.  It goes as follows: brass hose bib to some
sort of thread adaptor, PVC thread to 3/4" slip, ~3' of 3/4" PVC pipe.  This
is mounted more or less vertically.  The 3' copper bit fits into the PVC
bit, but sticks out of end a few inches.  I fill the copper bit with wort,
slip it into the PVC and turn on the water.  Within 10s I have a cool sample
for reading.  Water just overflows onto the ground.  When I'm lautering I
don't even bother to stop runoff during each measurement because it's so
fast that it's almost real time (maybe 45s total time for collect, cool,
pour into test jar, read).


(Caution: You must hold the copper device with insulation because the hot
wort heats up the copper and then your hand quite well.)


I saw a device for sale which used a similar idea, but you could have the
hydrometer in the part which was cooled.  Unfortunately this was years ago
and I don't recall the name.

Subject: Skimming


Brewsters:


Jeff Renner checked with Al Korzonas and
I didn't remember the essence of AlK's
experiment correctly. In fact, I had it
wrong! There is a difference between
blowoff and non-blowoff IBUs


Al's article in BT ( of which I don't have a copy
but thought I was correctly summarizing from
Al's HBD description of a few years ago)
showed that no blowoff versus loss by blowoff
produced the more bitterness.


AlK who has been busy with his new family
and new house took the time to respond to my
questions and gave me permission to include
his reply here:


AlK:
 
"The experiment that I did was not specifically
 to try skimming, but rather compared blowoff
to non-blowoff.  In my experiment, I split
a batch into two fermenters that were of similar
shape (at least the beer in them would be of
similar shape... height and diameter were
within a few percent) but one was closed and
a blowoff tube affixed and the other was large
enough to where the head could rise and fall
back into the beer.  I repeated it several times
and every time the blowoff batch had between
13 and 17% less bitterness as measured by
the Siebel Institute (IBU measurement... I'm
not sure if it was photometric or HPLC, but I
would guess the latter because I also had
them test for the quantities of various higher
alcohols and esters and this would certainly
be done by GC or HPLC).  I also had them
test for protein content.  The bottom line was
that while there were small differences in
protein, higher alcohols and esters, the
differences were negligible except for the IBUs.


Since the test was between "force the foam
out of the fermenter" and "let the foam fall
back in" it is quite obvious that "remove the foam
manually" will affect the bitterness also.  How
much is dependent on how thoroughly you
do it.  No doubt a small part of the foam falls back
in even with blowoff, so it is theoretically
possible that you could even have
fractionally *more* bitterness loss with
skimming, but we humans are far from
perfect and therefore, it is more likely that
skimming will result in a loss of bitterness
somewhere between 0 and 17%
relative to letting the foam fall back in.
My educated guess is that it is likely to be
closer to 17% than to 0%."'


While I agree with Al's interpretation and
extrapolation. I don't ever recall an
experiment in which skimming was
demonstrated to be useful in
affecting the bitterness of beer.
Does anyone else?


In my own experience, I have never noticed
a difference, but I did not do this scientifically.
Didn't compare top and botttom fermenting
yeast. Just couldn't see a difference in taste
with whatever yeast I tried this with long ago
( which was likely a British brewery top
fermenting yeast ) and stopped skimming
to reduce the chance of infection. From 
time to time I do skim to collect yeast and
maintain a top fermenting character, thus
my suggestion to use a paint edger.


I assumed the obvious insolubiity of the
"scum" was an indication that it would not
contribute to additonal bitterness or
"yeast bite" by redissolving. No attempt
was made to measure hop bitterness
quantitatively. Based on Al's result it is
likely there was a difference, but within
my ability to notice a significant difference.
I probably was not as effficient at foam
removal as a blowoff would be.I doubt
I did a triangle test or any such thing in
those days. These were likely  bitters
anyway and the senses are usually
logartihmic, decreasing in reponse
to higher levels. So no apparent difference
in bitterness by  taste is probably
reasonable


In my case, much of the "scum" clings
to the side of the 5 gallon fermenter as
the head falls and is a sort of automatic
skimming, I guess, This same
circumstance prevails with carboys,
as I remember trying to scrub those rings off in
my early fermenting days.


So, in the absence of other information,
 I believe my conclusion to not bother
skimming, while not necessarily valid for large
fermenters, is perhaps appropriate for small
fermenters of the size we use in homebrewing,
since I don't know if 13-17% IBU difference,
with skimming even less, is significant.


OTOH, Others have commented on wanting
to remove the scum since it tastes so nasty.




Keep on Brewin'
