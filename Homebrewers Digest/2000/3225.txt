"Teet" is not a word.
The word is "teat".  Pronounced like "tit".   Used in phrases like "useless
as teats on a boar", meaning about the same as "useless as a screen door on
a submarine",...,or like "teats up" (wrong-side-up, dead).  Cows have 4,
goats have 2, humans have 2 (duh!), pigs have 8, cats have...ummm...6 I

I've been using the Listermann 2 plastic bucket setup for about 2 years no.
My advice to those using it is to mash in a heatable pot, I use a 5 gal.
stainless steel cooking pot.  I then using the buckets for spargeing only.
When calculating my extraction rates I generally figure on 70%, although
yesterday I did my first decoction mash and was in the 80s!  The biggest
problem I've had with the stainless steel mash has been temperature
adjustment.  I've been using the stove as a temperature adjustment, perhaps
infusions of boiling water would make sense.

Subject: Burst Sparging - Clarification


I would like to clarify what I mean by "burst sparging," in case there is any
confusion.  Some have written of a technique which entails essentially
recirculating as normal, then adding a great volume of the batch water, and
running off completely.  This is what I have heard of as "batch sparging" and
differs from the technique I employ, burst sparging.


Whereas batch sparging entails a complete runoff (to a dry grain bed) between
"dumping" sparge water onto the bed (often, the sparge is thoroughly mixed
into the grain bed again, a recirculation is completed, and the runoff is
again run to a dry bed), burst sparging entails a recirculation and runoff as
per normal.  The only difference is that you allow the runoff to proceed until
the sparge water column on top of the grain bed gets close to the top of the
grain bed (don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes!), then dump
another 2-3 inches on top.  Continuous sparge obviously differs here in that a
constant 1.5-2" water column is maintained above the grain bed.


I have never "batch-sparged."  From the discussions in BT and elsewhere, a
"batch sparge" has the rep of resulting in a more malty wort, although the
brewhouse effiency is considerably reduced.  On the other hand, burst sparging
is known to increase brewhouse efficiency (in my case, from 85% to 95%).


Hope this clarifies.

Subject: brewing texts


Will Randle wants to recommendations on a good brewing chemistry text.  These
are mine:


George Fix's "Principles of Brewing Science" is good, laying out in very
elegant terms the biochemical components and processes of wort and beer
production.  It is also reasonably priced.


However,  for brewing chemistry, I would recommend the Hough, Briggs, et al,
Eds.,' Malting and Brewing Science series.  It is definitely geared towards
the professional brewer, but then, it's the same chemistry.  The costs may be
prohibitive but I think they are well worth the money, if you want an
exhaustive look at the subject.


Wolfgang Kunze's "Technology Malting and Brewing" is also excellent, but I
would hold off if all you wanted was chemistry.  While chemistry and
biochemistry and  thoroughly discussed, the real value in my view is his
additional in-depth discussion (as the title suggests), of the technology
involved in malting, wort and beer production (e.g., schematics and drawings
of lauter tuns v. mash filters, pneumatic v. mechanical malt conveyors, etc.).


Both the Stevens and Kunze texts are pricey, but again, great texts if you
want to pursue it.  The Practical Brewer is available via pdf download at the
Master Brewer Association of the Americas website.  It takes forever, but it's
free.  A good text.

The AB Newark plant opened in 1951 and is still operating.  The LA plant
opened in 1954 and is still operating.  In 1958 they opened a plant in Florida.
So, you'd be looking at a can produced sometime between 1954 and 1958.


<  Any ideas/guesses as to what this may be worth (and no, it's not for sale)?>


Largely depends on the condition of the can.  Rust? Humidity spots? Scratches?
Dents?  A full can often eliminates much of the market that would be worried it 
will leak.  e-Bay is the natural place to start on a price.

Subject: SS fittings






IMHO, stainless fittings for brew kegs are best welded on or through the
keg wall with a TIG.  It is possible to thread a MPT through the wall
and lock it on the inside, but I think this begs a blowout at some time
or other at worst and leaks at best after several brew sessions.  By
putting a 1/2 SS union through the wall, you gain threads on the outside
and inside for anything using a 1/2 FPT.  You really don't want to know
what a true SS bulkhead fitting sells for.  A source of SS fittings is
here: http://www.plumbingsupply.com/stainles.html
Pipe threads are much easier to use than ferrule or compression
fittings.  A little teflon tape and the seal is made.  On tubing a
simple screw clamp works just fine.
The quick disconnects I use are brass and are most often found in the
graden hose supplies part of your local mega home inprovement store.
Brass must be treated for lead by soaking in a solution of 1 part
hydrogen peroxide and 2 parts vinegar before you use them.  "the
perfesser" is all plumbed with 1/2 inch hard copper except for silicone
tubing on short runs.
Hope this helps.

You don't seem to understnad the market out there if you think there are

> It's the Wal Mart theory-- sell more stuff at cheaper prices.


If I cut my price in half, the most I could get is a 10 or 20% increase in sales
that would result from wiping out the competition.  If I had all the business, I
still would not have the volume to buy parts off shore and my costs would not
change by one percent.  There simply are no economies of scale in a product like
this and comparing to to Walmart is nonsense.

The "smart" e-sellers are making zero profit or losing money.  They also
manufactur nothing, have no investement in engineering or design and are simply
service business.  Different program entirely.

Be carefull of PMMA (super glue) type adhesives. They tend to give up their
adhesion properties at 100C depending on the specific type. If you were
gluing the two pieces together, let me recommend a two part epoxy instead as
epoxy systems will have higher thermal capabilities.


Because of the differences between the thermal expansion coefficients of the
plastic fitting (typically Ryton R4, a 40% glass fiber PPS) and the metal
fitting, the high number of thermal cycles makes this a difficult at best
area to seal. Typically, an elastomer type sealant would work best so that
it can absorb the different expansion rates without losing a seal. So maybe
a silicone sealent might be better. Hmm, you noted that didn't work either?
Maybe a fluoro silicone sealent which has higher temp capabilities?


One note on plastic pump fittings: Always get the plastics fittings in the
male style as the female style are stressed to much by the expansion of an
NPT male pipe. The plastic will fail very easily.

Subject: Hot Sauce and fermenting


I started to post this information last week but decided it was off topic. 
Now, Paul Niebergall's question brings it back.   This was Paul's question:


"Now I have made my own hot sauces before but never tried to ferment 
them.  Has anyone ever tried this?  Any hints on how to go about it?"


I heard a piece on a Toronto news radio station (no news stations in the
Buffalo area) last week about a Hawaiian company that was recalling its hot
sauce.  It seems that when the bottle is opened, the contents erupt and can
spray the persons hands and eyes with hot sauce.  The recalling company
claimed that the garlic in the sauce was fermenting and causing the
pressure buildup.

Bruce Carpenter said:


"my aching hand, I put the two buckets together. I noticed that the space
between the bottom of the top bucket and the bottom of the 2nd bucket is
about 3.75 inches (beneath the "false bottom")."


Go one step further.  After you finish the holes, take a carpenter's knife
(I assume Bruce Carpenter has a carpenter's knife ;-)) and cut the bottom
off the bucket about 1" above the bottom.  Now you have a false bottom.  It
will go all the way down in the outer bucket, bumping on the outlet hose. 
This will also eliminate another problem.  Before I did this, I had air
leaking between the inner and outer buckets.  Sometimes I would hear a loud
sucking sound as the air leaked between the buckets and aerated the wort. 
Using just the bottom solved this problem.


One caution.  This bottom will float so keep something handy to hold it
down as you add the grain.  


Also, if you make another one, instead of a drill, I used a soldering iron
to melt the holes.  The soldering iron I have makes ~ 1/8" diameter holes.
I scribed a 1/4" by 1/4" grid on the bottom of the bucket and melted holes
at the grid crossings. It took less than 2 hours to do the melt.

        Don mentions he uses finely chopped lemon peel in the secondary 
     for his lemon-fresh beers.  I know that in the culinary world only 
     the zest (yellow outside) is used as the pith (white inside) tends 
     to be bitter.  I guess that time spent in the lower pH, evolving 
     wort may offset this.  I'll have to try it.
     
        An HBDer tipped me on this: zest in the bottling bucket gives a 
     great lemon scent but with little taste to compete with your beer.  
     However the zest does not dissolve and may, in an unappealing 
     fashion, float about your glass!  
     
        Someone mentioned RealLemon (reconstituted lemon); my favorite

Greetings!
        I have a Cache Cooker (high pressure jet-type propane cooker made in
Utah) that I want to convert to Natural Gas. I have just gotten permission
to run gas to the house (too bad it cost me the price of kitchen remodel to
do it) from the s.o. I have looked at it and don't see any kind of
restriction orifice, like the ring type burners have, just a dial-type
pressure regulator. I know I can't just hook up the regulator to the gas
line and expect it to work, the supply pressure of the gas is much less that
the pressure in a propane tank.
        Has anyone ever successfully converted one of these things? Or does
anybody have a contact at the company that made it? I have done a web search
with no success, and can't find a phone listing either.

Subject: Best non-auto sparging technique?


Ok, for those who have a 3-tier (or other) system with a sparging arm and
all the 'works' for doing this task automatically, you can skip this post
 ...


For those of us that have an open lautering system and pour water into it in
various ways, read up!  Here's a question or two for you (idea generators)
 ... and please, for myself anyway, I'm not looking for batch sparging or
"put the sparge water in all at once" ideas.  Noble in their cause, I'm used
to the trickling method(s) and get good results, so I don't want to change
(yet).


Q) I pour hot sparge water through a SS colander with a 2-cup Pyrex
measuring cup so that the sparge water forms little streams and drops and
doesn't cause channeling ... what's the best non-hand-holding answer to the
colander?  I don't mind pouring water in to keep the sparge water from 0" to
1 1/2" deep on the grain bed, but I hate holding the colander ... duh ...
been doin' it this way for years.  I've heard of using drilled cake pans
that are suspended above the grain (wires and gizmos), floating (large)
Rubbermaid container lids that have been drilled (just set it right on the
grain bed), etc.   Any votes on the best and easiest method?  If I suspend
something from higher up (so it'll accommodate deep OR shallow beds of
grain), is there a problem with the sparge water passing through lots of air
before it strikes the grain/water?  Aeration?  Cooling?  Channeling?


I most of all want to hear from those who have come up with something that
you can pour in to and are now currently using that method ... and love it.
Ideas?

Brewsters:


Steve Worth's suggestion to go back and
re-read Papazian's book after brewing a
few is a good one. But if Charlie is the origin
of Steve's concept that dextrins contribute
to mouthfeel, he's wrong.


Soluble proteins contribute to mouthfeel and
dextrins do not, acccording to many scientific

Subject: Caustic Sanitizer


This may already have been addressed ad nauseum, but I'm behind on my
HBD's and had to respond to what I just read-- Graham Sanders' thoughts
on caustic as a sanitizer.


First-- why no problems with infection?  Cleanliness is 99% of
sanitation.  Generally speaking, microbes don't live on glass, plastic
or metal-- they need food and a hospitable environment.  Remove the
gunk, dust and so forth, and you're going to remove the bulk of the
microbes.  The odd single-celled organism or spore remaining may not
have an ample opportunity to infect your brew due to your large, healthy
yeast slurry (one of the reasons for using that slurry).


Second-- caustic destroys microorganisms?  Some, not all.  Not by a long
shot.  You have your spore formers which are very good at resisting many
sanitizers, let along cleansers, and you have organisms surrounded by a
proteinaceous cell wall which is a good shield from alkali.  Then you
have large colonies which will allow the outer edges to be attacked by
the caustic, keeping the inner organisms safe and free from harm
(caustic has a bit of surface tension that prevents effective
penetration).


Caustic's a great cleanser, but I'd use a sanitizer to be safe.

Subject: pH questions with RO water


Hi all -


I hope someone can shed some light on my pH problems.  I recently started
using RO (reverse osmosis) water to brew with, and was surprised to find the
pH of the water itself was quite low (4.7).  I have to add calcium carbonate
(1 tsp) to the mash (pale ale malt, 55L crystal and 1/4 lb wheat)to bring
the pH up from 4.7 to 5.0.  I then must add two more teaspoons to the boil
to bring it up from 5.0 to 5.3 (Miller's recommended minimum).  (On the
positive side, I don't have to acidify my sparge water!). My next batch with
this water yielded the same results.


My problem, aside from the fact I don't want to add this much chalk,
especially when brewing lager, is that I didn't get a very good hot break,
and my beer had a bad permanent haze.


I have been told that the pH of RO water should be neutral (7.0), so I
tested a bottle of commercial RO water and it measured 5.0.


I use the ColorpHast strips to measure the pH.


Thanks in advance for any answers, insights, or random musings.

Subject: Stout/Sour Mash


I'm going to try my hand at a stout, the recipe states that it is similar to
Guinness (Toad Spit Stout from Joy of Home Brewing) but is lacking the
"twang" of the real stuff due to it's lack of soured beer which Guinness
uses.  For those not familiar with it, the recipe is a DME and extract syrup
recipe.  Being adventurous, I turned to the appendix in which Papazian gives
a sour mash procedure. Basically, you dissolve your malt extracts in hot
water, stabilize at 130, add 1/2 pound crushed pale malted barley, and try
to hold at elevated temperature for 15 to 24 hours to sour. Then boil, add
hops, etc. I was wondering if anyone has tried this procedure. Is the result
*very* sour? Too sour for a Guinness type stout?  Should I make up a very
small batch of soured wort and add it into the regular recipe? I've heard
Guinness uses about 3% in the final mix. I want to play with this but want
to see what y'all might have tried along these lines also.  Thanks!

Will, are there any particular aspects of brewing chem you are interested in
or do you want info on all of the process steps? The first edition of POBS
contained several errors and had a significant amount of irrelevant material
(IMHO) so I wouldn't recommend this. I haven't seen the second edition which
has just come out, presumably it has been updated and the errors corrected.
However, this means that you can pick up the first edition of POBS for a
song (I got mine for $4 at the local bookstore) so it might be worth getting
after all if it can be had cheap, with your background in chem you will
easily navigate around the basic science errors. The info in AOBT is of
better quality than the first ed of POBS and is complimentary in many
respects, for instance it has a nice section on the characteristics of many
of the commercially available yeast strains which I haven't seen gathered
together and published before this. There are a few things in AOBT that are
annoying (like wasting space by including a picture of a microscope and
such) and I wonder about some of the info like Fix's "modeling" of amylase
activity - the graph of the pH dependence looks backwards compared to actual
activity profiles as measured in laboratory studies but he gives little
detail as to how this graph was actually generated so I'm not sure what is
going on here. All in all, I prefer AOBT to POBS but as I said perhaps the
second ed of POBS is worth buying. The target audience seems to be a mix of
the serious homebrewer / micro brewer.


Other sources:


There is a little paperback called "Brewchem 101" By Janson that might be
worth a look, it was reviewed a while back in Brewing Techniques. Speaking
of Brewing Techniques, If you can get a hold of back issues there are many
good articles sprinkled about on topics like water chemistry, amylases,
phenols, etc. Especially nice was the series of articles by Scott Bickham
entitled "Focus on Flavor" in which he went into great detail covering many
of the chemical species responsible for beer flavor (both good and bad
flavors) as well as their sources, how to do doctored beer tests to help
recognize the relevant species and commercial examples which highlight some
of the key flavor contributors.


MBAA  has an entire book on their website downloadable in Adobe Acrobat
format that's definitely worth a look. There's a lot of chemistry in here
including wort production/boil, yeast fermentation biochem, hop chem, etc.
The appendix also has a section on many of the off-flavor compounds found to
cause trouble and their characteristics and taste thresholds. This is a nice
reference to have and the price (FREE!) is certainly right!


I would highly recommend Brigg's "Malts and Malting" though it is a bit
pricey. It has TONS of chemical info on malting and mashing.  Lots of info
on grains other than barley, on the various specialty malts and how they are
produced too.
There's also Lewis and Young's book "Brewing" which is along the lines of
Fix's original POBS but does a much better job (again MHO) especially in
outlining basic chemical and biochemical principles (though since you
already have a chem degree this would probably be of little benefit). This
was published in '95 so is also more up to date than the original POBS but
again there is that new edition out there... (thanks to Dave Humes for
loaning me these two books!!)


Supposedly the two volume set "Malting and Brewing Science" (Hough) is
excellent but I haven't read it and it is quite expensive (~ >$120 per
volume).


Hough's "Biochem of Malting and Brewing" is reputedly very good though I
haven't seen it.


Bamforth's "Tap into the Art and Science of Brewing" is easy to read and
entertaining but not rigorous, still  worth the read.


Hope this was helpful to you

Subject: pumpkin light ale


Michael K. asks about a light ale recipe with pumpkin.  Here is mine.  
Basically a recipe from Ray Daniels Homebrew Fun book, for 5 gallons (mini 
mash):


2 lbs crushed two row malt
0.5 lbs crushed crystal malt (light or 20L)
5 lbs extra light malt extract
0.75 oz Cascade hops for boil
0.5 oz US Saaz hops for 30 minutes
0.5 oz US Saaz hops for 5 minutes
two pumpkins-each 9 inches in diameter
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice last 2 min of boil
Wyeast 1098 British Ale Yeast
5 oz (3/4 cups) corn sugar for bottling


Clean out guts of pumpkins and cut into chunks.  Bake at 250F for 1.5-2 hrs 
or until soft.  Puree or squash/crush soft pumpkin.  I cut off the skin as it 
scorched in the oven.  I did not read any where to do this it just seemed 
wise (actually this is recommended by Dawnell Smith in Brew Your Own, July 
99).  Add pumpkin puree and crushed grains to 3 qts water and steep at 155F 
for 1 hour.  Strain and sparge into brew pot and bring to boil; add extracts, 
hops etc as usual.


This should fit your request for a light ale.  The color was golden orange.  
I followed the above directions except I did not add my pumpkin to the 
mini-mash grains.  I read from someone elses post this was a mistake as no 
enzymes worked on the pumpkin starches.  I did not have room for all the 
"mash" ingredients to go into the mash pot (I had three gallons of pumpkin 
puree), so I just steeped my pumpkin in 145F water for one hour in a 
different pot and strained it into my brew pot.  I essentially added pumpkin 
flavored water to my brew pot. Regardless, the beer to me and two other 
homebrewers was thought to be quite good.  It was a tad hazy but typical of 
my homebrew.  I use Irish moss and chill the wort.  In no way could I detect 
the flavor of the pumpkin pie spice.  I could not tell you how much nutmeg to 
add.  The beer has a slight but noticeble pumpkin flavor.  Pumpkin by itself 
is relatively mild.  I did not get an original gravity, but it finished quite 
high at 1.030.   I've read that canned pumpkin does not taste as good as 
fresh pumpkin (Daniels); Papazian (Complete Joy) says canned pumpkin has 
preservatives that a brewer should stay clear of, but Sal Emma (in Brew Your 
Own, Jan 00) wrote that canned pumpkin was better cause the heat process used 
to treat pumpkin for canning converts much of the pumpkin to sugar.  For this 
recipe, Daniels recommends two 15 oz cans of pumpkin should you decide to go 
with the canned stuff to lighten the work load.  It took me three hours just 
to prepare the fresh pumpkin--cutting, baking, pureeing.

I'm getting caught up here, so forgive me if this has already been covered...


This is the same thing I do.  The advice came from Ken Schwartz' website.
I don't have the text in front of me here, but paraphrasing, he said in a
paper on converting extract to partial mash batches, that if your water was
an unknown, the easiest thing to do is to use distilled water and add 1
Tbsp./gal. DME to it.  He claims that is creates a chemical "signature" in
the water that will in effect adjust it properly. He says that this is
easier and more certain than hit and miss treatments.  I use well water and
don't have a full analysis, so I switched to this method.  It seems to have
increased my efficiency by at least several points.

I must have used the wrong drill.  My malt mill did self-destruct
(personal use only). The (small) hopper came apart and the base broke. 
It does make a nice, though expensive door stop. That's why we have used
a PhilMill here at the shop for the past three years.

Donald Lake posts that he doesn't like handling fees. But in so doing, he 
impugns the integrity of a long time home brew vendor that has sold 
hundreds (thousands? Tens of thousands?) of reliable and well built mills. 
To call a fairly common trade practice a deception is really uncalled for.


The logical reason for the charge is that which you call a "nice try", but 
refuse to accept. If I order two or three mills, as a small homebrew shop, 
I'll pay a lesser overall price than if Jack builds an average cost to ship 
each individual mill into his basic pricing.


Donald then goes onto to asking all to avoid buying from those who charge 
handling fees. I think most homebrewers are intelligent enough to look at 
the total cost of a transaction and decide when the goods are worth the price.

Acetyl plastic fittings from Colder Products (http://www.colder.com). They

Jeff and Pat talked recently discussed the smokey flavor, and inconsistency, 
of Rauchenfels steinbier.  I watched it being mad this past November.  Porous 
rocks are heated in a natural gas furnace (no beechwood here).  The hot rock 
is repeatedly dipped into about 50 gallons of wort and sugars caramelize in 
the pores and on the rock surface.  The rocks are then added to the lagering 
tanks, the burned/carmelized sugars dissolve into the wort, and voila, 
steinbier.  It is all handwork, a pitchfork of sorts is used to handle the 
hot rocks, so variability is not surprising.  


The Rauchenfels folks were great hosts and justifiably proud of their beer.  
Give them a call if you're headed for Bavaria and you'll not be disappointed!


See you at MCAB.
