Subject: sour mash and saison






afternoon


a zymurgy or two ago had a feature article on saison. read that one.


I did a similar thing with sour mashing- 500gms of pale grain and crystal
in a 4 litre small picnic cooler.


65 C was the strike temp and we left it for 48hrs. It was pretty sour to
taste neat and when added to the other 17 litres added and fermented
there was a slight sort of mellow tang.


the beer is still in the rack but on transfer was fantastic (we also
had peach's in there- a peache attempt of sorts)


I wish we could drink this now...who needs bottling......


subtlety is may be the way to go.

Subject: Keeping a Phalse Bottom down


I have been using Phil's Phalse Bottom since 97, very happily, except for
its desire to float. This was not a problem until I started using the
floating mash approach in a combined mash/lauter tun. Doughing in is tricky
when the bottom floats, and I struggle to get a clear run off.


I have tried a few things (apart from the obvious of gluing the thing down).
At the moment, I put a tea strainer on top of it - which works okay -
although I keep having to retrieve the strainer from the dustbin after
turfing the spent grains.


Does anyone have any ideas?

Subject: re: propane to natural gas


The things needed to make the transition from propane to natural gas are
four  fold.  First you need a natural gas orfice for the burner.  This
is a small brass insert in the burner with a tiny hole in it.  One can
be made by drilling the propane orfice out to a larger size.  7/64 inch
is a good place to start but certainly not over 5/32 inch .
The second item needed is a flexible hose WITHOUT a regulator on it that
runs from the gas line to the burner.  The existing propane hose should
be fine for this but if you must buy one get at least 3/8 internal
diameter.
Thirdly is a "needle" type gas valve.  This allows fine control of the
gas flow.  These should be available from the local gas grill store.  By
the same token, all this stuff is available from them in the first
place.
The final piece of the equation is a main shutoff at the gas line.  This
is a master cutoff to be used when the burner is not being fired and as
an emergency cut off if needed for the unexpected and such.
As usual, all connections should be checked for leaks with soapy water
(bubbles mean leaks) and if you are using the thing inside your house,
adequate ventilation is provided.  Be aware that a high BTU burner
output will be seriously reduced if that burner is converted to natural
from propane.

       SOLUTION OF THE SECRET OF ALCOHOLIC FERMENTATION


                "Beer yeast, when dispersed in water, breaks down into
an infinite number of small spheres. If these spheres are
transferred to an aqueous solution of sugar they develop into small
animals. They
are endowed with a sort of suction trunk with which they gulp up the
sugar from the solution. Digestion is immediately and clearly
recognizable because of the discharge if excrements. These animals
evacuate
ethyl alcohol from  their bowels and carbon dioxide from their urinary
organs. Thus one  can observe how a specifically lighter fluid is exuded


from the anus and rises vertically whereas a stream of carbon dioxide is


ejected at very short intervals from their enormously large genitals."

Subject: re: bottling just a few...


Since everyone else is chiming in on this one, I will too...


One of the greatest tools that I have found for bottling just a few 
bottles is the Listerman Counter Phil (no affiliation or kickbacks 
from Dan, just a happy customer, yadda yadda...).  It is a 
counterpressure bottle filler that you don't have to be a nuclear 
engineer to operate.  You need only two hands (duh!), and it works 
well.  You need to follow the directions almost exactly about the 
length of time that you force carbonate and chilling the beer very 
well before filling makes the process MUCH easier (and less 
foamy).  With the exception of barleywines and meads, I keg 
almost everything I make anymore, and if I want to pull off a six-
pack of bottles for competitions purposes, the Counter Phil does 
the job very well.

Subject: Malt Storage, Siebel closure


 Sorry for the slow response as I am still catching up on HBD's, (currently
very busy in the hunt for a new job).


Roger Whyman asked how to handle malt on 1/13:  You would like to see it in
sealed bags at your HB shop so it doesn't pick up moisture from the air.
The malt goes 'slack' when it picks up  moisture and you will not get the
extraction efficiency you expect.  I keep my malt in airtight containers  at
home and I also have a vacum sealer to reseal the smaller bags of specialty
malts.  (malt is very hydroscopic - is that the right word?- and 'loves' to
take up water).


It is indeed very sad to hear of the closure of the Sieben Institute.  I do
hope they can reorganize for all our benefit.  I would love to be able to
take classes from them, but they only have day classes, or did
anyway....maybe there are quite a few of us that could work with night
classes or even correspondence courses.  It might be helpful if a lot of us
voiced this opinion to them now that they don't seem to be able to get
enough enrollment to continute operations.  ( I had proposed these ideas
before to Bill Siebel, but he was not receptive to the idea, siting teacher
scheduling as the problem)


back to the job hunt...

Subject: Burst Sparging?






Are we all starting to make up terms to suit us?  Paul wrote:


burst sparging entails a recirculation and runoff as per normal.  The only
difference is that you allow the runoff to proceed until the sparge water
column on top of the grain bed gets close to the top of the  grain bed
(don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes!), then dump another
2-3 inches on top.  Continuous sparge obviously differs here in
that a constant 1.5-2" water column is maintained above the grain bed.


Paul then goes on to mention how this method has increased his efficiency
to 85% - 95%.


With exception to the amount of sparge water that lies above the grain bed,
this is no different than regular old "continuous" sparging.  Seems to me
that the only difference would be the weight of the sparge water on the
grain bed.  The relative weight of the additional two inches of water as
opposed to 1/4" (I assume that's when you see the whites of their eyes"),
is not significant in a small batch. However, the sparge rate (i.e. a
lengthy sparge) would have an effect.  Even though I find the 95% hard to
believe, I believe Paul would have to have a long slow sparge to have this
kind of effect on his efficiency rate.


If someone can clearly tell me how "burst sparging" is different from
"continuous sparging", perhaps I can be swayed.  I don't think we need new
terms such as this to confuse the issue for newbies however.

Subject: arrogant bastard ale


I just tried my first 22 oz. bottle of Arrogant Bastard Ale by Stone Brewing
out near San Diego.  Too bad this had to be imported from CA by my SO.  What
a big IPA!!  All I know is that its (I think I remember this, 6.9 or 7.2%
ABV).  So thats all I know.  Big hop bitterness.  NOt as much hop flavor or
aroma as some others like HopDevil, etc.  Very deep garnet red color and
seemingly lots of crystal malt to give the color and balance the bitterness
with some sweetness.


Anybody ever had this brew or tried to replicate it. Any help or thoughts
are appreciated with malt %, hops, or yeast.  Thanks.

Subject: Burst Sparging, RO water pH, Sour beer


Brewsters:


>From Paul's definition of "burst" sparging
( a new one on me) , I've always been
doing it that way to maximize the plug flow
characteristics, but don't understand how
it can inprove the effciency of the sparge
from 85% to 95%.
- ---------------------------------
Chris Beadle's RO water has a low pH 
on the order of 4.5-5. If this is from a well,
likely this is dissolved CO2. Try boiling
some  water and measuring the pH. Or
maybe you  can pour the water
through the air to decarbonate it.


An air pump with an aquarium aerator 
while heating would probably automate
this task.


I definately wouldn't add calcium carbonate
to this unless you are using a very high
concentration of roasted malts.


I also wonder if you are measuring the pH
of the mash using a cooled to RT sample.
I don't know how accurate the pH paper
would read at a higher temperature.
- --------------------------------
Rich, I suggest you check out the archives for 
information on how to prepare a sour beer for
Guinness. Charlie's method is fine,but I 
just mash a small amount of malt in a pot on
the stove, cool to 100-110F and add some
dry malt as a starter.


Use a thermos bottle to keep the temperature
up.  Also my electric oven with the light on
and door closed is about this temp. I put
the thermo in there.


I also did a titration and seem to recall
it will produce about 0.1% lactic acid,
but check the archives.

Subject: brewing chem texts, Kunze ToM&B


I discussed this issue in some depth a couple years back 
as I'm sure Alan Meeker remembers ;^). [Older but no
wiser Alan ?]


My only added comment re the current discussion is that
I think Paul Smith mischaracterizes Kunze
> Wolfgang Kunze's "Technology Malting and Brewing"
>is also excellent, but I would hold off if all you
>wanted was chemistry.  While chemistry and
>biochemistry and  thoroughly discussed,


W.Kunze's book is an English translation of a highly re-
editted undergrad textbook.  It covers practical aspects 
of brewing in great detail BUT it does not provide the
background info, just the practical results.


Chemistry and biochemistry are not thoroughly discussed
in Kunze - just a very light pass at the major issues.


In all it is a great book, and condenses the practical
results of much important research but it is flawed in
several ways.  The English translation is marginal and
includes several errors that I suspect are directly
due to translation, the index is very lacking by
modern standards (my copy is full of yellow stickies
since the index is so useless), and the references to
advanced literature are very limited in number.


If you can get a copy of PoBS on the cheap - use the
excellent reference citations to track down the original
books and journal papers.


Even if your library doesn't contain brewing journals -
check outtexts on flavor chemistry, food science,
fermentation science, etc. - even ag journals!

Thanks to all who replied publically and privately.
Yes, I misspoke--first leap year in a year with TWO zeros. We knew that.


Also, when I asked for beers "brewed essentially as they were 400 years ago,"
I neglected to consider the specific gravity (pun intended) of that
statement. Since I knew it was unlikely to find a keg of  framboise sitting
on the shelf at Total Beverage, I meant more simply "what are some beers from
breweries more than 400 years old, that can be found with some effort
in the Mid-Atlantic? Are any of them available by the keg?"


And perhaps I've answered my friend's question for him: go to Total Bev
and see what you find.
Thanks,

There's an easier way.  20oz is approximately 3% of a 5
gallon batch.  I buy a couple of cans of Guinness Pub
Draught a few days before brew day.  Place 1.5 cans in a
pyrex measuring cup, throw a handful of grain in the bottom,
and cover the top with cheesecloth.  In a few days you'll
get a nasty funk on the top.  Strain the sour beer through a
coffee filter and boil for 20 minutes to sterilize (I
pressure-can it, YMMV).  Add to the boil (or secondary,
whichever you prefer).  This gives a great "twang" and helps
approach the real thing.


I've done it Charlie's way.  It works but is way too much of
a hassle for me.

This old history teacher (and science and English - watch those question
marks, Paul) will now give a make-up lesson.


Pope Gregory XII in 1582 did it (actually, I'm sure it was his advisors,
but he had the clout), to make up for the 11 minute per year error of the
Julian calendar (named after Julius Caesar), which had accumulated to ten
days by that time.  To make a one-time correction, Gregory ordered ten days
eliminated from the calendar that year, so October 4 was followed by
October 15 in Catholic countries.  Apparently there was great distress in
1582 as people thought they were being robbed of ten days of their lives.


Various German countries waited until 1700 to adopt the Gregorian calendar.
England and America waited until 1752 [George Washington was not born on
Feb. 22, but rather Feb. 11, 1732 [George brewed porter - now we're
on-topic!]).  Russia adopted it in 1918 and Turkey in 1927, but the Eastern
Orthodox churches never have, which is why they just celebrated Christmas.


This tweak of the calendar makes a calendar year accurate to with 26
seconds of the solar year, an error which is decreasing 0.53 seconds per
century as the solar year gradually shortens.


You're now excused from missing that day of school.  But there will be a quiz!

Just lay a soup bowl, non-perforated, on top of the grain bed.  Pour
the sparge water into the soup bowl and let it overflow onto the grain
bed.  You may get some local scouring of the top of the grain bed
near the bowl, but it's irrelevant.  Keep a few inches of water on
top of the grain bed.


Also, buy yourself a 5 gallon Gott cooler.  Use it as your sparge
water reservoir and adjust for continuous sparge.  After holding
the colander by hand for a few years you deserve to get yourself 
a present!

following on the subject of Shipping and Handling


"All this Shipping and Handling stuff has gotten me
irritated."
     I think it's gotten a lot of us irritated,
Specially those of us who majored in business and know
a little about  the costs of buying and selling
products.


"I realize that there is extra cost in "handling" an
item to be shipped-- "
     And Jack is nice enough to let you know the price
of this cost. He could have burred this cost into the
price of the product, but then he would be accused of
price gouging his customers. 


"But there's an added benefit in that you are
increasing your target customer base by millions!"
     HELLO, reality check here. I don't think that
there are millions of homebrewers out there, let alone
ones that are all grain brewers and do not already
have a way of milling their grains.  It would be nice
for all of us if there were though. 


"It's the Wal Mart theory-- sell more stuff at cheaper
prices.  Every cent does not need to be passed on. 
The smart e-sellers will offer NO shipping or handling
costs for sales over a certain price limit in an
effort to gain a larger customer base.  It's insulting
to me that stores add a handling cost.  I know the
boxes cost more-- but this is the way that e-business
is going to be.  Make up your costs with volume."
     Ouch, shouldn't of used Wal-Mart in this
argument.  A simple trip to Wal-Mart's web site
http://www.wal-mart.com shows that 'yes' they do
charge shipping and handling on their products. They
either charge you a "fixed shipping" price, or they
charge a set price and a price per item such as "
Standard (5-8 business days) $4.00 + $0.97 per item,
Premium (3-5 business days) $6.00 + $2.47 per item,
Express (2-3 business days) $12.00 + $5.97 per item"
(pulled from their web site). 


     One way to get around this is to purchase your
MALTMILL from your local retailer.  I did this and
paid the same price as most of the mail order houses
were charging BEFORE shipping and handling (even $4.00
cheaper than Jack sells them for on his web site). I
hope this doesn't void my lifetime warrantee. 
Supporting your local retailer will help to ensure
that they are still there when you need them.  I had a
homebrew shop that was 10 minutes away close its doors
this summer.  Now I have to drive 45 minutes to visit
the closest one. 


     Let's stop flaming someone who had the vision to
see a need for a product and be innovative enough to
make a product to fill that void.  I thought about
making my own mill, but after some thoughtful
consideration (cost, time, machinery to produce one of
a kind) I decided that is was cheaper to purchase one
already made. Jack makes an excellent product at a
reasonable price. It seems that the old proverb is
true, "Those who can, do.  Those who can't, whine
about those who do".  What we need are more
visionaries and less moaners. 
* * * * * * * * * * 
     Sometimes we overlook the obvious.  I was looking
for a way to motorize my MALTMILL this past weekend
and was disturbed about the 3/8 shaft on the end. I
had the meat slicer motor in my hand and was trying to
figure a way to mount it on the mill.  My wife looks,
and said "Why don't you just use your drill to
motorize that thingie?  While you're at it, drill a
hole in the base and hang it on the wall when your
done. 
        Jack, Can I drill a hole in the base, or will this
void my warrantee?

Subject: pH questions with RO water


"Chris Beadle" <cbeadle`at`fischerUS.com> asks why his RO water has such
a low pH (4.7).  Carbonic acid.  Water has air dissolved in it. Air
has CO2 in it.  CO2 plus water equals carbonic acid.  I'm not sure
that you need to worry too much about the pH of your RO water. pH per
se is not the issue, but buffering ability is.  pH is just a measure
of hydrogen ion concentration and in pure water a little excess H+ can
greatly effect the pH yet has very little buffering potential.  
Buffering potential is the ability of the solution to resist changes
in pH.  This means that your RO water at pH 4.7 will have very little
effect on the actual mash pH.  Calcium carbonate is a salt and as such
added to the water alone is not basic and will do little to adjust pH.  
Added to the mash it will increase the buffering potential and help
keep the pH in the right range.


I suggest ignoring pH for a batch or two and just brew with your RO
water and NO water treatment at all.  See what happens and adjust
accordingly.  I've brewed with filtered Seattle water which is pretty
close to RO water and found no problems whatsoever.  I do generally
use 1 gram/gallon of gypsum (calcium sulfate) in my mash water.


You may also try boiling your RO water to drive out all the air, then
cooling it to mash and sparge temperatures.

Subject: Re: Spruce Beer/Brewing Techniques Vol. 4, No. 2 


Not the BT article, but a friend recently made spruce beer during a
local "heritage festival".  Mashed in a half-barrel and the works.
The beer was awful (because of lots of nasty wild yeast and who knows
what getting into it) but he did learn something from it.  For the
spruce beer, they used spruce branches (maybe just the tips) as the
*filter bed* in the mash tun.


He showed up at the brewclub on Friday with a new spruce beer, made
using modern sanitation practices, but with the spruce added *in the
mash* instead of in the boil.  Wonderful!  It had a subtle spruce
flavor, not at all overwhelming.  And it's probably much closer to the
way such beers were made "in the old days."  Even now, farmhouse
brewers in Norway (and other countries, I'm sure -- no flames please)
use juniper branches to help filter the mash, following an age-old
tradition.


I'm not sure how much he used, but his wife complained about the
"naked" spruce trees in their front yard.  I'm sure he'd be happy to
give you details.  I don't think he's on the HBD, but I can pass on
requests to him if he's not.

Subject: munich thanks and hefeweizen/irish moss question and CP fillers


Thanks for all the info related to my Munich malt and low extraction
question of about a week ago. It sounds like dark Weyermanns munich malt has
the potential for lowered OG and higher FG.  It also sounds like decoction
mashing can help with low extractions.  Increasing temperature of
fermentation may help also if the gravity is stuck high.  When infusion
mashing, I'll just have to buy a pound or 2 extra I guess.


Now for a new question.


I pretty much always use irish moss in all my beers as force of habit.
Should this help or hinder the cloudy heifeweizen look?  Has anybody done a
control experiment with looking at this idea?  I am not opposed to a weizen
eventually dropping clear especially since some German ones are clear but
prefer the hazy look for some reason.


For CP fillers (I only use this for competition bottling and not to bring
growlers to parties), I use a Phils filler.  It works very good and only
foams a tiny bit (maybe 1/4" to 1/2" once the beer is up to the neck area of
the bottle).  The foam amount can be limited by how slow you fill the bottle
 - mine tend to take about 30 - 45 seconds each). I have noticed the beer is
less oxidized tasting after multiple months with this type of treatment as
opposed to the normal bottling bucket method we all used early in our
homebrewing days or the homemade tube and cobra handle. This filler is easy
to use by yourself.  I tend to wash and sanitize my bottles and throw them
in the freezer for atleast an hour to chill them.  I also tend to throw the
filler also in the freezer to chill it also to help in the antifoaming
efforts. The beer is carbonated to its normal level at about 12 -15 psi in
the keg and I fill using the same pressure or maybe slightly less.  I blow
out the bottles with CO2 using the filler for maybe 10 seconds and then seat
the stopper on the bottle and fill it pretty slowly.  Usually a minimal
amount of mess unless I manage to turn the beer flow on rather than the
purge CO2. 


By the way, its nice to see the flame level at a low setting this week.

Does Guinness in fact own up and describe the use of soured beer in their

actually seen this documented.  Rather, Jackson and others have stated that
Guinness draught has three grain components, pale malt, roasted barley and
flaked barley.  I've been to Dublin and had many pints of Guinness there in
pubs and at the brewery and frankly do not taste any "tang" as Rich and
others have described it.  I have had Guinness in the USA that was off and
it was in fact soured so I wonder if what is being described is really a
representation of beer that hasn't traveled or been handled well and not an
intended aspect of the beer?  I've found that recipes using just the three
grains, mashed at 150oF with sufficient boiling hops to hit about 40 IBU is
pretty much dead on draught Guinness.  I'd appreciate specific references to

OK, I'm not George, but since there was nothing in #3225, let try my luck
at this one. I have seen this advice many times and was surprised when the
subject of making starters came up recently and nobody mentioned it.
Everybody who posted at the time said they they just do one large starter.
I think the reasoning for 10x step up is that even after boiling there are
going to be some bacteria present, but if the wort volume is small enough,
relative to the population of yeast you are pitching, then they will be
able to take hold quickly enough to  outpace the growth of the bacteria.
This then creates conditions that make bacterial growth difficult (or eat
up most of the sugars that make the wort so attractive.)


After recently suffering my first bad batch, I feel there could be a bigger
threat of infection in stepping up many times.  My SOP is now to pitch a
wyeast pack into 800ml in an erlenmyer flask.  I'm going to go with this
for awhile and see how it works out.  I personaly think that pitching a
smack pack into a liter is pretty safe.  I certainly would not want to try
to pitch a slant scraping into that much wort though!

Have you noticed the new wyeast packages?  Do they hold more, or is the
packaging just different?  (There is now a foil bottom built in.)  They can
be stood up on the counter when they are swelled.  This is not the "xl"
pack is it?  (I didn't see that on the label--mine was WY1056--not an XL

Subject: Best non-auto sparging technique?


In  HBD #3225 Brian asks about pragmatic kitchen equipment brewing
techniques:


I'm currently using a (thick) squat plastic bucket with custom insulation
added to retain an approximate mashing temperature (single infusion ale
brewing mostly). I've installed a slotted 15mm copper square manifold with a
washing machine tap through the side as close to the bottom as possible. I
to use a colander to distribute sparge water (large stainless steel version
with holes in the bottom, solid sides). Mine rests happily on the edges of
the bucket allowing me to scoop sparge water in at whatever rate I desire. I
find that if I keep the water level in the mash tun deep i.e. around 2"
(added in mini-batches at approximately 10 minute intervals), splashing is
minimised; although I do usually move the colander around a bit as it
doesn't sit exactly centered. The colander is shaped like a small pan, about
1.5" deep.


I overshoot my pre-boil target gravity slightly (by 3-4 points), based on
the default 75% efficiency in ProMash; taking around 45 minutes to collect
27 litres. I'm not too concerned with the small amount (1" drop) of
splashing sparge water causing HSA; I'm fairly careful otherwise and always
wear rubber gloves to go pee-pee after handling hot chillies :^) If you have
a tall mash/lauter tun, the large droplets of water may have a bit too far
to travel and cause quite a bit of splashing..... I figure that as long as
I'm not hammering away at the top of the grain bed I should be OK.


The one extra thing I do from habit is cut the grain bed (both directions)
with a knife during the sparge by an inch or so; which *I* think wards off
the channeling pixies... but then, what do I know.


It's simple and works for me; I'm not sure about its claim as the best
though...


As with everything, YMMV.

hbd,


Has anyone in this group ever done a pseudo-dopplebock with Wyeast 1338?
The primary ferment would be at ale temps and I could cold condition it
at about 50F for a few months.  If so, how did it turn out? I will have
a yeast-cake of 1338 and am considering various uses for it. Also, what
would be the best temperature to attempt this at (I'm assuming 60 F)?
The primary ferment would be at ale temps and I could cold condition it
at about 50F for a few months.


TIA,
