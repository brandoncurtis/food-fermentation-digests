A patient of mine was in recently. He said he had been out west(we are in 
Pennsylvania) and asked if I have ever tried Fullsail Breweries product. I 
have not. He said they are from Oregon and have a super tasting amber. Have 
anyone on this forum tried this? I understand that they do not ship this far 
east? Would anybody like to "swap" a few of these brews for something local 
of mine? I have Victory Brewing very close by, and there HopDevil IPA is to 
die for!(no affiliation just a blah, blah, blah). Thanks for the input. Also, 
I am converting an extract recipe to a all-grain and would like to be sure on 
my guess of converting


Extract
Amber Ale
3.3 lbs gold liquid (I used M&F)
1lb light DME
2 lbs Lager grain
1lb British pale
1/2 lb CaraVienne 
2 oz chocolate
1 oz Tettnanger Hop(boil)
2 oz Hallertuaer Hop( 1 at 40 min, 1 at knockout)
Wyeast American Ale 1056


My all grain conversion
Amber
8 lbs pale ale(am not sure if I will use Marris otter or Breiss pale ale)
2oz chocolate(for color)
1/2 caravienne
1 oz Tettnanger (boil)
2 oz Hallertuaer.(40 and finish)
1056 ale yeast




Is this a good conversion? Pretty basic, but this provided me with a really 
good drinkable ale when I did extract. I finally decided to go back and give 
it a try.
Thanks for the help

Howdy ho, brewers!


Bill Frazier <billfrazier`at`worldnet.att.net>, when explaining that it is
simple to get into all-grain, sez: "I've brewed some very malty beers with
one decoction."


To simplify it even further, do single infusion mashes using Munich malt (I
use Weissheimer) as your base malt.


The best IPAs I've ever made used all Munich (sometimes with some malted
wheat, sometimes not) for the grain bill. All that wonderful maltiness
really works well with the big hops. About as simple as it gets, and you
don't have to worry about the cloying sweetness from too much crystal.


IPAs aside, you can make a wonderful ale that even works as a transition
beer using 100% Munich malt, fairly lightly hopped with a noble-like hop
(Liberty is nice) and a clean yeast like Nottingham. Talk about simple,
malty & delicious!




Brew on!

 ginger beer to the sweeter Jamaican Ginger beer), cream soda, and/or

Steve, there are  good soda extracts for this. I have used the homebrew soda 
extract (small brownish box)  and added a little lemon and some fress ginger 
'tea' for extra zing. I find making it in a keg a force carbonating it a lot 
more reliable than using champagne yeast. But either method should 
theoretically work. 


The Carib Shandy Lager (original recipe) that I referenced in my post has an 
OG of 1.014, and an FG of 1.003-4. The book say it is 1.3% alcohol by volume 
with an SRM of 1.  Here is the recipe per the book. (Clone Brews)


Yield: 5 gallons
1 oz. 20 Lovibond Crystal Malt
Crush and steep in 1/2 gallon water at 150 degrees F for 20 min. Strain grain 
into brew pot and sparge with another 1/2 gallon water at 150 degrees F. Add 
water to bring brew pot level to 1.5 gallons and bring to a boil. Remove from 
heat and add:
1 lb corn sugar
1/2 lb M&F extra light DME
8 oz lactose
Add water to bring brew pot total to 2.5 gallons. Boil for 45 min. then add
2 oz peeled and chopped ginger
1 tsp irish moss
Boil 15 min. , then remove pot from heat and cool 15 min. Strain cooled wort 
into primary and add cold water to 5 gallons. Pitch yeast when temp. is under 
80 degrees F. 
Recommended yeast: Wyeast 2007 Pilsen or 2035 American Lager
Primary ferment 5-7 days, in secondary add 3 oz natural ginger flavoring. 
Bottle with 1 cup corn sugar when fermentation is complete. 


My version of this recipe follows. It turned out to be a very light and 
bubbly lager (I kegged it due to time limitations). It was served in 
champagne flutes as an aperatif at the Culinary Institutes Homebrew Dinner 
last winter. 


Carib Ginger Shandy Lager Recipe:   O.G. 1.028  F.G. 1.010
1/2 lb Breiss Crystal Malt (20L)
1 oz Dewolf - Cosyns Special B Malt
1/2 lb Corn Sugar
1 1/2 lbs Honey
1 1/2 lbs Laaglander Extra Light DME
1/2 lbs Lactose
1/2 oz Cascade Hop Pellets `at` 3.5% alpha (60 min. boil)
2 oz grated fresh ginger root (last 15 min of boil)
1 tsp Irish Moss (last 15 min of boil)
Reuse of Danish Lager Yeast from a friend
Pitched yeast at 60 degrees F. Primary at about 50 degrees F for 15 days, 
secondary at 35-40 degrees F for 14 days. A strong tea of ginger boiled in 1 
cup water was added when kegged.

Subject: raising mash pH


Go to a canning store and buy "slaked lime" (NaOH).  Make up
a 3% (w/w) solution and add minute quantities to the mash
water.  I have a similar water profile and a few drops (2-3)
brings the mash pH where it needs to be.  Stir vigorously
and check the pH after adding each drop.


Oh, and Carmen has the Checker II pH meter.  If I recall
that's the one with the metal probe.  Those meters are only
accurate to 0.5 of a pH unit, which means your pH 5
measurement could be between 4.5-5.5.  Sorry to rain on the
parade, but the meter (IMHO) is not even as accurate as test
strips.  At least with the test strips you can see what
"side" of the pH you are likely on because of the degree of
color change.  Of course a good, accurate meter is not only
~$100-$150, but the probes wear out extraordinarily quickly
due to the protein content of the wort.  I "burned" out two
probes before figuring that the $90 replacement cost wasn't
worth accurate pH readings for 5 beers.  Just my experience.

I would not recommend changing the formatting of the
Practical Brewer and redistributing without the express
permission of the MBAA.  This is classic copyright
infringement as you're taking the written words of a
copyrighted publication and redistributing without paying
royalties to the publisher.


Someone undoubtedly will want to argue that the internet
changes everything (if I hear "new paradigm" again I'm going
to...brew) and that posting the stuff on the web in PDF
format for free gives the public the right to do anything
they want with the material.  The laws may not have caught
up with technology yet, but they're still valid.


One data point:  when I've published my works in magazines I
retained the copyright to the written word, but the magazine
retains the copyright to the format the words were published
in.  By altering the format of the publication and
redistributing you would be violating the copyrights of both
the author and publisher.  That's called efficient
infringement.

Drewmeister Andrew Nix said:
"OK, one more....those floating thermometers (Brewer's Best I think), anyone
else have a problem with the rubber handle coming off if you put them in
water that is getting close to boiling (the glue fails).  I had BOTH of mine
come off this past brew session, one was brand new, the other I've had for
years!!!"


To which Ronald La Borde said:
"I tossed mine, it seemed like the quintessential mark of a beginning
homebrewer.   :^)"


And I toss in my two cents worth:  Yes, my Bewers Best thermometer's little
rubber cap comes off in the mash.  Its not much of a problem with mine,
because I have found that if I push it down far enough, the cap creates
enough of a vacuum to keep it on just fine.  I'm just careful not to hold it
over concrete when its hot!


Regarding the usefulness of these thermometers, I used to think along the
same lines as Ron (I figured it can't be good, it came with my first kit and
isn't NEARLY as cool as my dial thermometers!).  Then I bought a lab-grade
mercury thermometer for calibration - I discovered that my dial thermometers
were 5-10 degrees off and my Brewers Best was within 1 degree of the lab
thermometer!  Each time I check calibration I have to adjust the dial
thermometers again, and the BB is always within 1 degree.  


Yeah its slow as molasses, and yeah its not cool looking, and yeah the cap
comes off when it gets too warm.  But I can depend on mine to be accurate at
least, and I never have to worry about recalibrating it!  Of course, YMMV
and this is in no way an endorsement of the Brewers Best line of
thermometers (flame suit on!).

You definitely don't want to use malted wheat for authenticity.  Raw,
coarsely milled wheat is what's used traditionally.  Flaked wheat will work
just fine  (I used it once to see)- it's just been steamed and rolled thru
heated rollers, which gelatinizes the starch, but that will happen with
truly raw wheat in the mash kettle anyway.  The protein is unaffected,
which is not the case with malted wheat.  One problem is that you may not
know what kind of wheat you are getting.  Of course, with wheat kernels,
you may not know either.


In Belgium, brewers use a low protein, soft white winter wheat.  This is
also favored for malting.  The protein is low (<~9%) and also "weak," that
is to say, it is non-glutenous.  It's great for pastries, but not for
bread.  It seems to me that all of this is good for beer, too.  White wheat
has less tannin/phenolic components.  This means potentially a more mellow,
softer beer.  However, this may be theoretical and may not make a big
difference.  When Pierre Celis set up brewing in Texas, he used the local
hard red winter wheat.  This is higher in protein and the protein is
stronger.  I don't know what brewhouse changes he may have had to make to
accomodate this wheat.


You didn't say where you live.  Here in Michigan, we grow some beautiful
soft, white winter wheat.  Some is also grown in adjoining states, NY and
Ontario, and in the Pacific NW (where they grow Michigan developed
varieties!).  This is what I use, but it may be hard to get elsewhere.  My
second choice would be soft red winter wheat, then hard white winter
(Kansas and California), hard red winter (most of the plains), and last of
all hard red spring (northern plains, high in very strong, glutenous
protein).  At the very least, try to get the protein level of the wheat or
flakes yyou want to use.  Anything over 12% would look like potential
trouble to me.  But remember, this is all supposition from me based on my
experience with other wheats in baking, not brewing.


A triple decoction seems like overkill but that's up to you, of course.  I
don't remember if it is traditional.

The very best way, I think, is to use a real top fermenting yeast and an
open fermenter (with or without a cover) so you can skim it.  This produces
the cleanest, most active yeast, I think.  Keeping the yeast from the
bottom of the secondary also produces very clean yeast, but some argue that
it selects for slow flocculating yeast.  I don't think that should be a
problem for small numbers of repitchings.  Yeast from the bottom of the
primary fermenter is most likely to have large amounts of trub, hop
particles, and dead yeast, although it can be washed (see
http://www.wyeastlab.com for directions.


I haev certainly kept harvested yeast in the fridge for many weeks.  I
think a month is pushing it, but I've been successful with that long and
even a little longer.  If it's been more than a week, I boost it a day or
two ahead with a quart of wort in a gallon jar (for lots of air).


If there is a homebrew club near you, hook up with it.  It's a great way to
learn.

*******************************


        To prove a case of copyright infringement, the plaintiff
must prove both
ownership of a valid copyright and infringement of that
copyright by
invasion of one of the five exclusive rights of copyright. 
Three of the
exclusive rights that seem at issue are the rights to 1)
reproduce the
copyrighted work; 2) prepare derivative works based on the
copyrighted
work; and 3) distribute copies or phonorecords of the
copyrighted work to
the public.  Additionally, the work that the defendant is
reproducing,
adapting, distributing, etc. must be a copy of the
copyrighted work.


        Infringement of a copyright can occur without word for word
copying.
Generally, a plaintiff in an infringement suit needs to
prove that the
defendant had access to the plaintiff's work and copied it
either
consciously or unconsciously.  Access and copying would flow
from the
companies interaction with students of the professor. 
Courts have defined
a "Substantial Similarity" test for determining what level
of similarity
determines copyright infringement.  A large volume of case
law is devoted
to the last issue.

Subject: Adobe Acrobat and PDF


I create PDF files nearly every day.  I can give some input into the
situation.  When I saw the size of those files, I didn't even try them.


If they are image files, that means that they were scanned as images and
converted directly in Adobe Acrobat.  They clearly were not optimized, a
process which would have allowed page-by-page downloading, a process
that makes it seem almost instantaneous.


If you can get a good copy to scan, you should scan it INTO ADOBE
ACROBAT as a bitmap at 300 DPI.  When it is imported into Acrobat, this
will produce an excellent reproduction at a reasonable file size. If you
want to do better,  you should then use the CAPTURE process of Adobe to
do the OCR.  If you do that, the size of the file will drop
dramatically, and you will have searchable text.


Unfortunately, the 4.0 version of Acrobat has several bugs, one of which
is in processing images.  Specifically, it does not compress them
properly.  The resulting images files are huge, and there is nothing you
can do about it.  I just received the 4.05 version in the mail, which I
hope will correct that bug.


If an original version exists in a word processing format somewhere, it
should be converted to PDF from that format directly rather than being
scanned.  This makes a gigantic difference in file size.


If anyone does try to redo these, make sure the files are optimized.
This brings us to another big.  If you create it in 4.0, optimize it,
make any change whatsoever, and then save it, it is no longer
optimized.  You have to do the Save As... bit all over again every time
to keep it optimized.


I hope this helps someone.  As I said, I didn't even try.

Subject: Anyone have a Rheingold recipe to share?


I went into my local bar the other day and they were serving Rheingold on 
tap.  I tried it (what the hell) and found it was the beer of my youth.  
Fishing trips with my old man, mowing the lawn, BBQs with the family...  I 
drank it the rest of the time I was there and enjoyed it more than any other 
american tap I've come across.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to find it 
in a package store.  Anyone else try the reborn Rheingold?  Any suggestions 
on how I can replicate it at home?  I'd appreciate any/all extract/partial 
mash recipes you can suggest.  Private responses welcome.
Thanks much,

I do have some questions about the legality of doing any of this, though.
The text is copyright 1977, which means that without the MBAA's permission

Subject: Importance of wort clarity


Hi all,


Jack Schmidling writes in Thursday's digest that obtaining clear wort from
the lauter tun is unimportant because the beer will have plenty of time to
clear later.  This is a statement that many brewers would take exception to.


Firstly, there is more at stake than beer clarity when discussing wort
clarity.  Cloudy lauter runoffs are higher in lipids (M&BS, Vol. 1 p.330),
and this will most definitely affect the outcome of the fermentation (one
outcome is an increase in ester production (M&BS v.2,p. 608).  It is up to
the drinker if this is desirable.  There are also the more amorphous claims
that high levels of wort lipids yield beers with poor flavor stability.


One such claim is that worts with higher lipid concentrations are more prone
to developing the cardboard-like flavors of trans-2-nonenal.  In private
communications with Garret Oliver (Brooklyn Brewery) and George Fix I
learned that some people theorize that the apparent lack of stability in
certain Munich beers is due to the use of the Meura 2001 mash filter, which
apparently produces worts rich in lipids.  It would be greatly appreciated
if somebody with access to a good library (Steve Alexander) could
investigate this further...


Kunze claims that cloudy lauter wort will result in poor hot break
separation during the boil, which means an increase in the amount of high
molecular weight proteins and tannins that will make it into the beer.  This
can most definitely affect beer clarity.


Which leads to the second thing I disagree with Jack about:  the beer will
always have time to clear later.  That is sort of like saying that a poor
music studio recording can be "fixed in the mix."  If you produce an
exceptionally cloudy beer it will take exceptional efforts to clear it.
These can include filtration (something which most homebrewers cannot do,
and commercial breweries prefer to do efficiently, meaning the beer should
be relatively clear to begin with), fining agents (which may or may not
work), cold temperature and time.


"Time" sounds easy enough, but there are two problems with it:


1.  People are impatient.  The party is next week and the beer has the
clarity of the Hudson river after a storm.


2.  If you wait long enough, the beer will be clear, but will also be
old-tasting, too!


As a commercial brewer, I am cognizant of the desire to eliminate
unnecessary work and worries from the brew day, but one must know enough
about brewing to know when you need to worry and when you can say, "C'est la
vie."  You can make decent beer from turbid wort, but the odds of doing so
or lower than they are if you achieve good wort clarity.

I would be willing to bet you are not using an EASYMASHER (TM).  I am not
responsible for the problems people have using obsolete brewing schemes.  If you
are using an EM, your need to do all this is a result of not following the
instructions that came with it.

I am a fraid you will have to invest in  a thermometer.


>Hmm...I almost always gently rake / stir the grain bed in one form or
another during the sparge, and I've never really had one get stuck...


You seem to forget that the original poster was having a problem with an EM and
I was trying to help him.


>Stuck sparges are usually
from compaction and air space between the grain bed and the filter...


What filter?  The grain bed is the filter.  The only thing that causes stuck
sparges with an EM is if the strainer gets clogged and stirring is the only
thing that causes a clogged strainer.


> Not from stirring IMO - I thought that was a way to get things flowing
again.....




I certainly will not argue with what works for you but again, it is not relevant
to the problem.


>Geez...all this time I've been recirculating for nothing I guess...but
you are the brewer of the WGB, so it must be gospel.


Well, the good new is, that now you know and can save years on to the rest of
your life.


>You want to know the single most important thing I've learned to help
the flow from the lauter tun?  Mashout.  Since I've done that I've
improved my beers significantly.


I couldn't agree more but you are simply identifying mash temp as the real
factor.


Again, your whole posting may have boosted your ego but it won't help the person
we are trying to help who is doing infusion mash in a cooler.

I personally have had some frustration regarding back issues of BT. I have

I contacted Stephen Mallery via email regarding this matter. Stephen was
kind enough to take the time to respond to me. I asked him for permission

have not received their back issues. Stephen has given me permission to 
post his response. I hope you'll take a minute to understand his position .


[Begin Paste]


I apologize for my slowness to respond regarding the status of BT back
issues. Progress on that front stalled when a series of events compounded
to absolutely bury me with work. I have a full-time+ job, I am
single-parenting three kids, I lost my last staff member at the beginning
of December, then Christmas -- that amazing time sink, and whatever time
and energy I have had for BT has been consumed by the more immediate need
to vacate a fairly complicated office setup (landlord pressure) and resolve
certain other financial/legal issues. Meanwhile, physically displaced and
left with different computer equipment than was previously set up for the
task, I am having to re-start BT systems from my home for the purpose of
back issue fulfilllment and order processing. I haven't done a good job,
at least in getting it done ina timely manner, and I do apologize. Please
understand, however, that it has nothing to do with anything immoral,
illegal, or spineless. I'm just plain buried.


Obviously I need to do better at communicating status to BT customers. I
have always been and remain committed to the highest values, both for my
craft of publishing and for my personal conduct. I had hoped to get an
e-mail out to the online community this week. Here it is Friday, and

Regarding the difficult Practical Brewer Download:


I have borrowed a hard copy of the Practical Brewer. The first edition was 
published in 1977.  It is in it's 11th printing (1997). While it does have 
some timeless brewing information, I would not download the whole shebang. 
Most info is about commercial operations, bottling lines, etc.. It has a 
black and white photo of an early 70's computer process control console that 
has a fraction of the computing power of my son's PlayStation game.


A new edition of the Practical Brewer was published in 1999 and has been 
updated to reflect new technology/brewing science. Have not seen it. I am 
sure that edition will not make it to public pdf format.


I found the:


American Handy Book / Wahl & Henius
http://hubris.engin.umich.edu:8080/Wahl/


to be a much more interesting online brewing text to view.  I feel much more 
in tune with the brewers of that time (except for my RIMS) than the 24/7 
commercial brewing info found in the 1977 edition of the Practical Brewer. 
The format is difficult to read, but it is comforting to know that 100 years 
ago, brewers were concerned with the same basic issues most homebrewers deal 
with today. Look over a few sections and check out the adjuncts used during 
those times.

I posted this question a month or so ago, no response.  Oh, well, will try
again.


Although probably not too traditional, my wife and I both enjoy the American
version of Hefeweissen.  Light yellow color, mild, and very refreshing, esp.
when our summers can get regularly over 100 deg. F.


I all-grain, and recirculate.  Have experimented with 50-70% wheat grain
bills.  Taste is fairly good.  However, one batch was more like a
traditional weissen.  All batches were CLEAR!  Even after only a month from
brew to bottle.  Amazing, considering this is something I could never do
using extract.


Anyone have good results brewing a Yellow hazy hefe?  Which yeast do you
prefer?  Do you recirculate the mash?


Spring is coming, would appreciate any help.

The problem is this:  It is surprisingly easy to heat water in a container
which has too few nucleation sites to cause enough bubbles.  Water can be
heated to excessive temperatures without visibly "boiling" in the usual
sense.  It takes something to make bubbles form.  Put water in a container
which has a very smooth interior (like glass that hasn't been through the
dishwasher too many times) and microwave it.  The water gets hot, perhaps
very hot, but unless there's a point where the bubbles can form, it may be
way above boiling (212F/100C or your locally-adjusted value:-) without any
bubbles.  Introduce any sort of foreign substance or anything to disturb
the water and find a nucleation point, and all of a sudden it can boil,
possibly explosively.  It is not, as the quoted material suggests, diffusing
the energy.  Rather, it is that the object inserted is rough, hence provides
places for bubbles to form.

Caustic, quite literally means - has the ability to burn, corrode, or

Subject: Troy's Water/Microwaving Water


A comment on Alan's comment on Troy's water:  Troy's water is pretty
soft: 21 ppm as CaCO3 calcium and 16 ppm as CaCO3 Mg. The alkalinity is,
as he mentioned, is an estimate basesd on the amount of bicarb required
to bring the net charge to neutrality assuming that the ions he knows
about are the only ones present except for bicarbonate which is assumend
to be the only unknown anion. Thus the alkalinity may be off a bit but
probably not by much. Assuming that the alkalinity value is about right
the residual alkalinity is positive at about + 30 and thus the salts in
the water would actually tend to raise the pH above 5.75 or so though
not by much IF the calcium/phosphate reaction is what is settng the pH.
Clearly this is not the case here: it is, I believe, the malt organic
acids and offer Troy's, Carm's and my own experiences with medium water
and pale ale/crystal grists in support of this notion. Thus reducing the
hardness/alkalinity of the water would only make the situation worse
(lower pH). In simple terms the reason for this is that the calcium in
Troy's water is insufficent to overcome the alkalinity in Troy's water.
In addition, it would not be easy to soften Troy's water much further
chemically. Heating with extra calcium likely won't be very successful.
The best that can be done chemically  is probably the lime "split
treatment" which is only likely to reduce alaklinity to perhaps 20 ppm.

The phenomenon Jack S describes when water is heated in a microwave oven
is not a momily and is easily observed (but best not from above the
container). When water boils what happens is that the temperature is
raised to the point where the vapor pressure of water is as high or
slightly (by the amount of hydrostatic head)  higher than atmospheric
pressure. If a nucleation site is present a steam bubble can then form.
Nucleation sites can be particles in the liquid, projections from the
bottom of the vessel or what we most commonly see, the release of some
gas (i.e. air) held in surface imperfections in the walls of the vessel.
In normal boiling the bottom of the vessel is heated and this usually,
but not always, causes release of this gas. When this doesn't happen we
get what chemists (and brewers) refer to as "bumping". At its worst,
the  liquid gets substantially hotter than the boiling point (it is said
to be super heated) and then some event, such a a very slight mechanical
disturbance, triggers nucleation and the entire liqud mass explodes into
vapor at once. To prevent this chemists use "boiling stones" which are
rough carborundum or plastic particles designed to entrap and hold air.


In the microwave, paricularly if the water is free of particulate matter
and the vessel clean, this phenomenon is more common than it is with
flame heating because the heat is not applied through one surface only
but more or less uniformly (skin depth considerations aside)  throughout
 . Thus the entire mass can become uniformly super heated more readily
than it can with the flame where clearly there is a temperature gradient
from bottom to surface.


To observe the phenomenon Jack describes put some clean water in a very
clean, clear vessel and put it in the microwave. Heat it for a minute
and see if it boils. If it doesn't, disturb it (be careful) by jolting
it  a little or tapping with a spoon or  dropping something in and see
if ebullition is triggered. If not start again  (new water) but give it
2 minutes this time. The object is to find an irradiation time that
super heats but not so much that a mouse sneeze in the next room starts
it boiling.
Once again, be careful. Please use common sense. Remember that the
object is to produce water/steam hotter than 212F.


I first noticed this when microwaving water to make tea. The water as
removed from the particular oven at work would not be boiling (after 2
minutes I think) but would start to boil violently as soon as the tea
bag was lowered into it.


This phenomenon was explained at length in an article in Scientific
American  - Amateur Scientist I think and probably  5- 10 years ago.
Maybe a net search could turn it up but I'm afraid I can't do much
better than that.
