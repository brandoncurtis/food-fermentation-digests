Subject: slaked lime


Hi all:


I've been reminded by several people that slaked lime is
Ca(OH)2, not NaOH (caustic soda).  Both will work equally
well, and slaked lime has the advantage of adding calcium to
the mash.  That's a benefit for soft water with low Ca
levels.


Which reminds me, I was mashing a double brew last weekend
(Imperial pilsener and a CAP).  I didn't treat my water with
anything (mine's nearly as soft as Plzen's water).  The mash
seemed to be proceeding quite slowly so I added a teaspoon
of CaCl2 to the mash.  Within 30 minutes I saw a noticeable
clarification of the wort on top of the mash--my sign that
conversion is nearly complete.  So, although it's been
posted recently (by Steve A, methinks) that, analytically,
the mash should have plenty of Ca to completely convert the
starch, practice suggests otherwise.  My sole caveat is that
I won't mash for more than 75 minutes.  The brew day is long
enough and if a teaspoon of CaCl2 will help meet my
requirements I'm all for it.  I'm sure a 2-3 hour mash would
completely convert without addition of minerals, but I'm too
impatient for that.


Anyone have a good recipe to emulate Yuengling's Pilsener
(the original reddish version, not the newer Premium).  I
tried to get my CAP to come close, but it's still too
golden.


Cheers!
Marc

Subject: Mash temp too high


What will be the effect of too-high a mash temperature on
fermentability, flavor, and other qualities?


Specifically, the mash was allowed to heat to ca 166~170F, starting
from 156~158F, over a 45 minute period.  (I was stacking firewood.)
When I discovered this I killed the heatsource and extended the rest
to 90 minutes total.  In the final 45 minutes the temperature droop
was about 2deg.   Mashout and sparge were unremarkable;  sparge yield
was ca 7.5gal `at` 1040, which boiled down to ca 5.5gal `at` 1054, from
10.25lb grain charge, which is quite a bit better a yield than my
usual 25~28 pt-gal/lb.
Unprimed wort tasted pretty much normal.  This is a lager, fermenting
(I hope) at ca 56F in a heated locker (air temperature in the brewing
and reloading bunker is 40F), so it will be some months before it will
be tasted.  IMBR?  What should I expect? The preliminary sip did not
seem astringent.  And where did that extra extract come from?

Subject: Re:  Fullsail Amber Ale


I love this beer.  One of the few commerical beers I have actually tried to
clone.  It's too dark, malty and bitter by AHA standards to be called an
amber but I think it should be the prototype of the style.


It's a relatively simple recipe.  Check them out online at
http://www.fullsailbrewing.com/fsbcbrews2.htm.
My 10 gallon recipe is as follows, adjust for your own system to target
1.058 OG, 42 IBU.


17.50 lbs Great Western 2 row.  (Any pale/pilsner malt should do)
 2.00 lbs Crystal 60l
 0.50 lbs Chocolate


1.50 oz Cascade (60 minutes)
1.00 oz Cascade (40 minutes)
1.00 oz Mt Hood (20 minutes)
1.00 oz Mt Hood (0 minutes)


I usually do a single infusion mash at 152F, but higher temps wouldn't hurt
the beer.
They told me their yeast is proprietary, but 1056 works well.


Their IPA and VSP's are excellent beers, too.


Good luck.

Subject: water - pH and superheating


A.J - I agree for the most part with your assessment about the pH water
observations but two things still bug me - why was this water not alkaline
out of the tap as it seems it should have been and why the low (pH = 4.4)
value for the mash with the Colorphast papers? In my experience the
Colorphast papers work just fine and are within +/- 0.2 pH units of metered
values.


Regarding superheated water in the microwave; this is an all too real
phenomenon and is analogous to making a supersaturated solution with say
salt or sugar. In both cases the solutions are metastable and can react to
the smallest perturbation such as simply jostling the container. In the lab
we are VERY aware of this phenomenon since microwaves have in many cases
supplanted the old Bunsen burner as a handy way to bring solutions to a
boil. I had to personally escort a summer student down to the ER after he
suffered burns from a container of superheated agar solution which he
swirled while looking down the opening of the Erlenmeyer flask!

Subject: how much melanoidin malt is too much?


Greetings all,


I am considering brewing a big (>1.100) partial-mash dopplebock.


I noticed that in St. Pat's catalog, their all-grain "Alligator
Dopplebock" kit contains 5# Munich, 5# Vienna, and 5# Melanoidin malt..
I have been told that in regards to Melanoidin malt, "a little goes a
long way". Is 5# melanoidin too much? I'm not even sure what flavors
would result from "too much" melanoidin; I don't think it could result
in too dark a color for a dopplebock. I imagine harshness or excessive
esters is what is feared. Any comments welcome.


Thanks,

Subject: pH of worts - what temperature?


Brewsters:


A question by e-mail prompted me to dig
into the pH of wort/temperature thing again
and may be of interest.


Here was my reply, which may clarify
the idea once again.


Let's start on page 274, vol1  2nd ed of M&BS


Hope this table makes it!


Preparation     pH of mash-tun
and nature              wort
of water                at room temperature


Cold water
extract,
distilled water 6.2-6.3


Wort pH,
 water temporary
hardness
(about 15 grains
of CaCO3/gal    5.89


wort pH,
distilled water 5.76


Wort pH,
permanent hardness
(4 grains of CaSO4)     5.65


Note that all of these pHs were
measured with the sample at
room temperature. Which I
think is the standard method
technique. Now if these pH's
were measured at 150F or so
they would be 0.35 pH units less
( the approximate drop on heating.
  p 279 , op cit) due to the higher
dissociation constants of the
various acids as well as other
physical considerations ( like
"activity" which I believe is
temperature dependent) ,
at the higher temperature.
If you subtract 0.35  from these
above RT values, you will
see numbers like 5.53 - 5.30.
at wort temperatures.


Note, also the cold water extract
( which is what you get before
you begin to heat your wort)
has an expected higher value
as the phosphate and other
stuff has not yet reacted. It will
when you heat it ( see the"wort -
 distilled water" value) and the
pH of the wort will fall to some
value as calcium phosphate
is precipitated and the protons
are freed from the partial
phosphate salts in the malt. 


Remember the calcium sulfate
concentration above is in
"grains per  British Gallons".
If you used more CaSO4, your
results would give you a lower pH
up to a point where all the phosphate
is precipitated.


Page 279 op cit says:


"An infusion mash is best carried
out at 5.2-5.4. Consequentially,
 the pH in the cooled wort will
be 5.5 - 5.8"


Not much question there about
what is meant..


Note again this says
"cooled wort" which means it
has been heated and cooled.


Do not attempt to adjust the pH of
a mash ( as I sense some HBD
authors are doing) which has not
been heated.


BTW, the pH adjustment using
calcium sulfate or calcium carbonate
is not instantaneous as  these are
relatively insoluble salts as is the
calcium phosphate formed. 
The calcium phosphate may even
coat the added dry  particles, further
slowing equilibration.




Keep on Brewin'

>I'm considering replacing the base on my Maltmil(tm) with a piece of
quarter-sawn oak and suing oak cabinet plywood for the hopper etc.  anyone
done such a thing?


As a matter of fact it is a $400 option on the MM but it also includes a
sterling silver crank.


However, I would not demean the project with plywood and quarter saw oak would
be very boring and of no particular help in this application.  Actually, flat
sawn wood is probably stronger so you could use half inch stock.  The value of
quarter sawn wood is that it shrinks evenly in all directions but this is not an
issue for a base.  I would make the hopper sides out of the same 1/2" stock and
find someone with a plane to plane down the same stock to 1/4" for the panels.
Sounds like a fun project but would not fit into the decor of the World's
Greatest Brewery.

        Dan and Tim, 
        
        I just recently brewed a Koelsch with this yeast and noticed no off
flavors, though I fermented in the lower 60's.  It sounds to me like you 
have an infection.  Check your sanitation procedures.  Fermenting in the
upper 60's would at worst give you more ester/fruity flavors, not medicinal
ones.  As Volker mentioned in hbd#3235, you may notice friuty notes initially.
I fermented in 1.5 weeks and kegged, then cold conditioned for another week
and notice no fruity tones.  This Koelsch has fermented very clean and is
clear now, but took longer fine than other beers I brew with standard ale 
yeasts.


        You may want to chill the wort right after pitching the yeast and
ferment 
at the lower range of the yeasts tolerant temps for the first few days to 
avoid the fruity tones.  Then warm to upper range before the beer is finished 
to get rid of any diacetyl, then cold chill for aging.  This may clean up 
some of the fruity esters, but I still think that a medicinal flavor is 
probably a sign of an infection of some wild beasty.


Hope this helps,
Paul

Anyone who has met Laurel will agree on her commitment to brewing.  Class 
act. I hope the Brewing Certificate Program she is developing will begin in 
the fall of 2000.  MATC has an excellent Food Science program and the Brewing 
program will be a great addition. I also ran through the Malting course 
online and it was very complete. The weekend workshops are a great place to 
meet serious brewers and share and learn new brewing information. How often 
do you get to ask Hans Kessler, from the original 'AugsBurger' fame, 
questions about your Oktoberfest recipe?  Great stuff.


Me sing?


Well, if it is OK with Laurel, I will sing the praises of RIMS brewing for a

Besides the MATC courses and workshops the 2000 Craft Brewers Conference is 
being held in Milwaukee in April. Going to save a few vacation days for that

Subject: fruit late in the secondary? 


I have a wheat beer going right now, pretty hoppy, but comming along nicely. 
  It originally started as a strawberry wheat, but it now has no strawberry 
taste to it anymore.  I used about 4# frozen strawberries, steeped them in 
the hot wort after the boil, crushed, and removed the pulp.  Should I have 
left the strawberries in the primary and taken it out at the transfer to the 
secondary?


Now I have this beer sitting in the secondary for about 3 weeks and I'm 
wondering if I can still add some fruit flavoring to it.  I don't really 
want to use fruit extract, but I do have a lemon tree in the yard.  So can I 
add lemon this late in the brewing process?  I was thinking about using 4 
lemons, adding just the zest and the juice.  Would I have to pasturize the 
lemons or would the alchol in the beer be enough to keep down any 
infections?

I recently "found" an old Wyeat pack of yeast when cleaning out my brew 
fridge. The package is dated Aug 1998. I popped the starter and waited to see 
if it would swell up. It did! It is 1084 Irish ale yeast. It has been two 
days since I smacked it and it is already just about an inch or so thick! I 
have had less swelling from some fresher yeast packs! So my question is, can 
I still use this package? It has been in the refridgerator this whole time. 
Also, I was originally going to brew a Honey Porter(ala Sam Adams Honey 
Porter). But can not find the recipe that I had. Does anybody have a recipe 
for this? Thanks in advance!

Jack, if you crazy loonies can't even learn to drive on the proper side of

Volker might also drive on the wrong side of the road, but if he can talk

Fact is, back in the 70's the USA missed a great opportunity to run with a
far better measuring system, and now you all have to live with that
decision. I suggest you all lower the red, white and blue from your back

Condolences to Kurt and the people of College Station, TX. Theirs is
about the worst water report (from the viewpoint of brewing) I have ever

one can make is "Hardness good, alkalinity bad." Kurt has almost none of
the former and lots of the latter. I toss out "Residual Alkalinity" here
(as do a couple of other folks) as often as I can because its a quick
and dirty way of guessing performance in the mash tun. It should be less
than 50. Kurt's is 387 i.e. almost exactly the same as his total
alkalinity and that's because  RA = (alkalinity) -  (calcium_hardness +
magnesium_hardness/2)/3.5 and there is no calcium hardness to speak of
here. As a rule of thumb, mash pH shifts from the distilled water pH
(5.75ish) by .00168 units per ppm of residual alkalinity or, in the case
of the present water, a whopping 0.650 pH units!  Thus Kurt has a
problem which is the opposite of Troy's and would be constrained to
brewing beers with lots of dark malts in order to lower mash pH to a
region where the enzymes would be happy.


So some decarbonation is in order. Kurt is right that boiling would not
do him much good as there is no calcium and he is also right that adding
gypsum  and/or calcium chloride to get the calcium up could result in
excessive amounts of those anions. More chloride would be especially
disastrous as this water must taste marginally salty already and more
chloride would only augment this. There is lots of room to maneuver with
respect to sulfate, however. If you don't want sulfate, the best calcium
source  is lime i.e. slaked lime i.e. grocery store pickling lime which
is Ca(OH)2 [not NaOH Marc though I'm sure you caught that one yourself
by now]. This can be used to soften the water. Make up a slurry in a
small volume of water, dump in enough to make the water being treated
cloudy and stay cloudy after stirring and add a pinch of calcium
carbonate to the water being treated. Now wait until the water drops
clear and decant off the precipitate. You will have dropped the
carbonate alkalinity greatly at this point but the hydroxide alkalinity
will be high and you must neutralize this with acid. The obvious choice
here is sulfuric since sulfate is so low but unless you are a lab rat I
don't recommend fooling with sulfuric acid and you may want to keep
sulfate low (for lagers) anyway. The best choice from the safety and
cost aspect is carbonic acid which is supplied by mother nature at no
cost in virtually limitless supply in the air. Bubble air through the
decanted water as vigorously as possible or recirculate the water
through a nozzle with a pump. Eventually, though this may take some time
depending on how you do it (and use of CO2 from a bottle through a
carbonating stone is probably the quickest),  the pH will come up to a
nominal value around where you started i.e.8.3 or so and, if you use
bottle CO2 can be brought lower. Remember that it isn't pH you care
about, it's alkalinity. Once the pH  is down to 8.3 the hydroxide
alkalinity (which came from the excess lime) is neutralized and you're
left with the bicarbonate alkalinity which is going to be around 50 or
less.


The trick here is being able to tell when the pH is less than 8.3. A
meter is obviously the best way, pH test strips will work as well but
perhaps the best indicator in this application is phenolphthalein
solution. When water to which this stuff is added turns red the pH is
above 8.3 and but if this indicator is clear, the water is at pH below
8.3. I recommend this indicator because it is easily obtained (it's in
any alkalinity test kit which will do both P and total alkalinity ) and
it defines the end of the range of hydroxide alkalinity which is what
you are trying to get rid of with the CO2. Do not, however, put this
stuff in the  volume of water you are treating. Take samples for pH
checking. While phenolphthalein is not particularly poisonous it is a
powerful laxative (older brewers may remember "Phenamint Chewing Gum").
If no indicator or meter is available, just spray or aerate for a couple
of days. Equilibrium will eventually be reached at a pH a bit above 8.5.


So now you are decarbonated but there is still way to much sodium for
most beers. The only ways to beat this are RO, ion exchange,
distillation or dilution. Ion exchange is probably not feasible because
the exchanger would load up with anions and cations so quickly with
water with this level of TDS. Dilution aside RO is probably the best
cost option for  producing brewing volumes of water (affordable units
produce 5 - 10 gal per day so you must collect for a couple of days). RO
water is, like distilled or deionized water, nearly ion free so some
salts must be added for most brewing applications. Kurt asked for a
nominal recipe. The following will give a typical east coast surface
water (modeled after the Potomac river so if you find yourself lying to
the people, accepting bribes from Peking and chasing floozies, adjust
the pH). Add per liter of deionized (or nearly deionized) water:


NaCl   2.46 mg/L
CaCl2.2H2O 29.82 mg/L
Epsom Salts : 81 mg/L
Chalk:  69.93 mg/L
Sodium Bicarbonate: 29.58 mg/L


You will have to bubble  (much better to use a "stone") CO2 through the
water to get the chalk to dissolve. The water will become clear when
enough CO2 has been added. Stop bubbling at that point and then aerate
by pouring back and fourth or spraying to allow excess CO2 to escape.
This isn't that critical as the heat of the hot liquor tank will drive
off excess CO2.


 Ca hardness will be 90.3 ppm as CaCO3, Mg hardness 65.3 ppm as CaCO3,
alkalinity 89 ppm as CaCO3, chloride 16 mg/l, sodium 9 mg/L and sulfate
32 mg/L. Residual alkalinity is 59 ppm as CaCO3. This  water is suitable
for the majority of brewing applications. For Bohemian Pilsners, use 1/4
of the specified amount of Epsom salts.


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 


Ant set the pH of his brewing water and wonders why the pH of his mash
was not closer to that of the water. The answer was alluded to above.
The pH of the water is not very useful information by itself. One must
also consider the alkalinity. When you change the pH of the water from
8.3 to 5.3 you convert about 95% of the bicarbonate (but not all of it)
to carbonic. The remaining bicarbonate still has to be neutralized (the
alkalinity of the adjusted water is about 6). Now the grist you
specified should have more than enough acid in it (nominally) to do the
job. Remember that you must drop a couple of tenths from cooled mash
readings so the pH of your mash was probably about 5.4 at temperature.
This is a very respectable mash pH.Individual malt characterisitics can
swing things a couple of tenths of a point so I'd say you are O.K.


Also note that the phrase "I used a pH meter for the first time while
brewing. The results were a bit odd." is one that is not uncommonly
heard.

Just a followup to my last week question on Wyeast 1098 (british ale) and
ester production.  


Has anybody tried this in a high gravity brew like barley wine or imperial
stout.  How did you find the ester level after fermentation, after a few
months in the keg/bottle? Is it best to leave the beer to condition at
warmer or cooler temps to get the fruity esters to lessen? I used a huge
starter from a previous porter.  Also, just positive CO2 pressure, in a keg,
negatively effect the conditioning time?


Do all esters mellow with time (including those ones made purposely) or is
it just those esters formed through bad fermentation conditons?  


Would anybody think of using this in a high gravity beer or should the
fruity/estery description moved me towards something else? Did I make a bad
decision?


Thanks for any help,

 something that used to bug me.  My system only yields about 60-62%

 is a brief description of my set-up and procedure, any suggestions to
 improve would be most welcome... >>


 ...and then goes on to describe his system.  


This is a perfect example of why I previously suggested the use of pts/lb (or 
yes, pts/kg) in lieu of percentage.  Your 60 percent efficiency may be 
respectable enough to just leave it alone.


Your measurement accuracy (grain weight, volume and wort gravity) and maximum 
yield reference points may be causing your results to look less attractive 
than what they really are.


Assuming this is not the case, the things I would say you should try to 
increase your yield would be:


#1)  Completeness of crush.  Even if you think you have a good crush, crush 
it more.  Try running it through the mill twice (once at a courser than  your 
normal setting, the second time finer than normal) to get to a finer crush 
with minimal damage to the husks.  IMO, the idea that you will get "husk 
astringency" and stuck sparges because you over crush are seriously 
over-rated and are the main reasons why the majority of homebrewers 
*under*crush thereby reducing their yields.


#2)  Recirculate and then draw off the first, high gravity runnings from your 
mash *before* adding any sparge water.  This way you will not dilute these 
first running and will maximize their gravity.  You can run it dry if you can 
get away with it.   However, most people that use false bottoms (vs. 
manifiolds or easymashers) will find that just as the mash goes dry it throws 
a lot of particulates in the wort.  To avoid that, calculate how much you can 
run-off without running the grain bed dry.


#3)  After step 2 add sparge water to just reach the top of the grain bed and 
wait.  This will allow the sugars to diffuse into the fresh liquor.  Then 
begin to run-off and sparge as normal, but do it *slowly*.  


I think these are the significant few things that I have instituted over the 
years to go from 25-26 pts/lb yield to the 31-32 pts/lb. range.

Ah, but there's the rub.  Homebrewers do not consistantly state their yields 
as a percentage of course lab grind.  Some do, but most don't.  Most 
homebrewers don't even know what the malt analysis is for the particular 
grain they are brewing with.  Many just use some other arbitrary anecdotally 
determined maximum yield values such as those presented in the Zymurgy Great 
Grains issue among other places.  These are the most common maximums seen in 
the various brewing recipe calculation programs.   


The advantage of using pts/lb when publicly discussing homebrew yields is 
that you *know* you are looking at the "raw" data and are more or less forced 
to concern yourself with the other factors involved.  When presented with a 
percentage, I always ask myself; "Percent of what?"


AFA predetermination of recipe outcome, I agree that in every case you will 
need *some* kind of maximum yield estimate (by ingredient) to come close.  
Whichever method one uses in the privacy of their own brewery in order to 
estimate outcome would seem to make little difference.

A few days ago I proposed that the Practical Brewer could be reduced in
volume considerably and be more useful for searching if text in the
document were converted to text format.  I noted that I had tried it but
didn't have the proper software tools.  I also noted that I didn't know the
copyright implications of such a conversion.


Since then I have received an number of messages (some of which were also
posted in the HBD) from people saying they had the tools and were going to
try it.  Marc Sedam also posted his interpretation of the copyright rules. 
Pat Babcock also announced that he was asking the MBAA for permission to
mirror the Practical Brewer on the HBD site.


I think we have to see how this unfolds.  If Pat gets the permission, I
hope he makes it clear that the version may be in a different format.  In
my original post I suggested that the new format be made available to the
MBAA since I am sure their members would find it more useful.


For now, based on Marc's assessment, if I had been able to make the
conversion, I would not feel comfortable distributing it to others.  In
fact, if someone offered me a converted version, I would have to refuse it
even though I would really like to have it. 


Hopefully Pat will get permission.  Perhaps others in the HBD that have
contacts in the MBAA or are members can help this come about.
