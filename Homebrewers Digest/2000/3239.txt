If your mash temperature is too high, you kill the enzymes, which have a 
certain temperature spectrum to do their job of converting sugars, for 
example.
Fermentability ===> you will have a lot of residual sugars left,
which will change the whole ====> flavor profile, sometimes to sweet beers

and it makes it easier for bacteria to attack your finished beer.

Malt.
But, I did not used it in a doppel bock, our Bock Beer was brewed with
* 80% 2-row Pilsener Malt (Briess)
*  5 % wheat Malt (Briess)
* 10% Dark malt (400*L) (Briess)

I have had nothing but terrible experiences with Brewer's Best
thermometers.  After a while, I get terrible readings in which something
that is visibly boiling registers around 150 degrees on the
thermometer.  Unfortunately the only alternatives that I've found are
quite expensive.  (I now appreciate some of the reasons behind process
in decoction mashing as well as in Scotch ale mashing regimes, both
pre-dating thermometers.)  What does the collective wisdom use that is
1) accurate and 2) in the $20-$50 range?

Subject: efficiency & stuff


Herr Volker suggests Plato per kg per Liter.  The British journal JIB uses
'liter degree per kg' where a degree is the same 0.001 SG difference that we
HBers call a point.  Not sure what the German lit uses for units.


From: J Daoust asks
>OK, I understand the correlation between higher mash temp giving a

"Sweeter" is probably a poor description of the impact.  More dextrinous is
more supported.  The yeast consume the sweet tasting sugars regardless of
fermentability.   Dextrinous fluids are more filling and arguably add to
body and certainly viscosity.  Pure commercial food dextrin does not does
not taste sweet, nor does it taste starchy.


For normal brewing water:grist ratios (1 to 1.5 qt/lb [or 2 to 3: L/kg for
Phil&Jill) the extraction efficiency rises with temperature tho' from 65C to
80C the figures fall within a 10% range.  In thinner (more watery) mashes
the difference becomes negligible.  In this experiment at 1.25qt/lb the wort
varied from about 9P to 9.5P as mash temps increased from 70C to 80C - but I
wouldn't be planning heavily around these figures.  Many other factors make
as much difference.


Fermentability (real attenuability not apparent) dropped in the samples (at
1.25qt/lb) from about 69% at 70C, to just over 50% at 75C, and under 30% at
80C.

generations to come.


>Fact is, back in the 70's the USA missed a great opportunity to run with a

Oh yeah - that old French system based on a bad estimate of one quarter of
the earth's circumference (a meter was to be 10^-7 of the distance from pole
to equator), or 1/100 of the temp between the freezing and boiling point of
a rather common molecular substance at a rather arbitrary pressure.   For
mass a volume (based on the oddly defined and ill-measured meter) of  the
common molecule used for temps were employed ....   Of course the definition
of the standards has shifted, but the basis and size of the units has not.
Even the French didn't revolt against the Babylonian based units of time.
Where's your metric day Phil ?


It's trivially easy to derive a (actually 4) complete and consistent system
of measure based on universal constants -  the unit charge, the speed of
light, Planks constant and  (which one am I forgetting?).  Why change twice
?


The advantages of metric are that one can calculate *only* units w/o
multiplication if you use base 10.  The last time I looked calculators were
cheaper than bottled water, and once GMO catches on you can say goodbye to
having 10 fingers or toes to count on - and there goes the base10 system.


Anyway that is my defense of the indefensible Phil, what do you think ?  ;^)

Whilst flipping through Papazian's HOME BREWERS GOLD, and looking for some
pilsner recipes I noticed on p. 246-248 a gold cup winner, Redwood Coast
Alpine Gold Pilsner. The recipe calls for 8lb 2 row, 1/4 lb american wheat
malt, 1/2 lb american munich, 1/4 lb cara-pils.  They recommend a step
infusion, the first step being at 133 F, for 30 minutes.  Is this just due
to the wheat malt (and supposed higher protein),....or may there be another
reason?

 ...... I have had the same prob getting the earthy tone. I feel it comes
not so much from the fermentation organisms but from the corked bottles and
where they are stored. many people seem to think that the cool dampness of
this region just like the lambic region further north encourage the molds
and yeast that provide these musty flavors. I have tried corking but not
gotten the same results. I now have a new cold cellar that maintains earth
temp and will try again. I do not notice this mustiness in the belgin beers
but the brewers there say that high humidity is to be avoided and their
refermentations  can get close to 80F. I will be asking about moisture
levels and referm temps when I visit in france.

Subject: Lager brewing


Hi All,
Regarding the use of the WYeast 2565 Koelsch yeast, Paul Lyon states / types:


"You may want to chill the wort right after pitching the yeast and ferment 
at the lower range of the yeasts tolerant temps for the first few days to 
avoid the fruity tones.  Then warm to upper range before the beer is 
finished to get rid of any diacetyl, then cold chill for aging.  This may 
clean up some of the fruity esters..."


This is actually how I've brewed lagers.  One problem that homebrewers 
commonly encounter is difficulty pitching enough yeast to ferment a 
lager.  I use a process similar to what Paul mentions.  I pitch the yeast 
on the cold end of the "recommended" temp range and once I start to see 
fermentation, I let the temp slowly rise.  Ultimately, they end up 
finishing in the mid to upper 50's.  I say that because I set my thermostat 
to around 53 deg F and I know that the fermenting wort is warmer than that.


Now, this is not the last word on lager brewing (I'm no expert...nor a 
certified judge) but it works pretty well for me and who can argue with a 
guy that works at NASA (that'd be Paul)?


That's my $0.02.  Anybody else care to chime in to help those who have not 
yet ventured to lager brewing cause "it's too hard"?  Now back to our 
regularly scheduled discussion of microwave thermodynamics.

Yes, in fact, if you have tried to use a microwave for making starters, you've
probably noticed that it's nearly impossible to boil in them without going
from nothing to boiling over in no time.  A boiling stone (a couple of
pieces of sanitized aquarium gravel maybe) in the erlenmyer (qt jar,
whatever) will help when boiling starters in the microwave --you will have
enough time to stop the microwave before a boilover occurs if you watch it
very closely.  I need boiling stones in the 1 lt erlenmyer I have, even
when boiling on the electric range, or I will get a boilover every time.
It all erupts at once without the stones.

With my maltmill motorized, it's great fun to pour the grains from a 5 gal
bucket into the purring mill.  I like to watch the grains and look for any
foreign matter (rocks, crap, who-knows-what) as the hopper is loaded.  To
crush 10 or 20 pounds for a brewing session takes maybe 3 minutes.


Now why would anyone feel the need for a larger hopper?  Is 3 minutes of fun
just more than you can stand??  The time you would take to build the  hopper
could be used to crush hundreds of pounds of grain.  I just don't get it.

Oh no, I have been doing this for years with my coffee. It could be true

Part of it is the ability to load 'er up, and let 'er rip. Another part is
what may have driven Jack to develop the MM in the first place: it's FUN
to create things with your own intellect. Another is that a motorized mill

Full Sail's house ale yeast is 1084 (Wyeast Irish).  Full Sail Amber is 
fruity with slight diacetyl.  Using 1084 in a clone attempt would bring out 
these flavors and certainly make a more interesting beer than the bland 1056.


Darren used the following grain bill:


>17.50 lbs Great Western 2 row.  (Any pale/pilsner malt should do)
 >2.00 lbs Crystal 60l
 >0.50 lbs Chocolate


In my random uncontrolled experiments, the closest I've come to Full Sail 
Amber was in a beer that had about 40 percent Munich Malt.  I also cut the 
Crystal malt and chocolate malt to half of what Darren used.  I have my 
version on tap now, and it is a scary dead ringer for the Full Sail Amber.


By the way, I highly recommend just about any of the Full Sail products.  In 
the midst of all the microbrew hooplah and buy outs in this region, Full Sail 
just keeps focused on making tasty stable consistent beers.  The brewery is 
also worth a visit, as there's usually something unusual on tap.  At a visit 
a couple weeks ago, I had a beer the assistant brewery manager had named 
Ass-Pony Ale (the bar tap was made from the rear half of a bright pink and 
purple plastic toy horse).  It was light golden, about 9 percent alcohol, 90 
IBUs and rendered me incapable of driving.

Subject: UV sterilization


I have just started my first batch of brew this past weekend and one of
the first things I noticed about the process is that it scares the crap
out of you to even breathe, for fear of contamination.  I am praying
that my first brew is actually drinkable.  I am also interested in fish
tanks, and in-line UV sterilization filters are often used in saltwater
tanks.  I am thinking of this for beer prior to adding the yeast.  Would
this royally skunk the beer.  Do the elements that are skunked by UV
exist before fermentation, before boiling the sugars?  Are they from the
hops or the barley?  Any theories or experience with this sort of thing?

Subject: Tip for Improving Efficiency


I have, like many others, been unable to get extraction efficiencies above
about 65%...until recently when I discovered an incrediby useful technique.


Generally during a 90 minute boil there comes an increasingly lack of
attention to the boil on the part of the brew crew.  During one of these
moments when attentions are directed elsewhere, I add a 24oz sack of
Turbinado sugar to the boil (I only brew pale ales, generally).  Depending
on batch size, of course, this can markedly improve yield.  


NOTE: This technique only works if the additional ingredient isn't witnessed
nor recorded.


For only pennies per gallon, the advanced brewer can boast rather
extraordinary yields and clearly demonstrate his or her enviable, and
uncanny, brewing prowess.

I recently saw an excellent process flow diagram on the wall of a
micro-brewery, depicting each stage of the brewing process quite well. (Yes,
even at my age I still prefer to read the pictures .. heh heh) It was by
ALPHA LAVAL, and I had hoped to find it on their website, but there was no
copy of this unfortunately.


Can anyone recommend a website that shows the complete process flow diagram
of a brewery? Or a book perhaps ?

Subject: Alcohol to Sanitize?


NatureMy practice has always been to use alcohol -- usually cheap vodka --
to sanitize small items on the fly, like a thermometer for measuring the
temp of yeast rehydration water or the end of a racking cane that
accidentally touched something.  I've never had a problem with this method,
and never (knock on wood!) had an infection that resulted from this
practice.  However, a friend of mine -- she teaches in a university nursing
program and works in a biology lab -- told me the other day that alcohol is
almost useless as a sanitizing agent unless contact is maintained for about
30 minutes.  A quick dip in alcohol simply does not kill bacteria or germs,
according to her.  She was talking about using alcohol as a prep for
subdermal injections, but the implication seemed to be that it would also be
true for my brewing applications.


Does anyone know with certainty whether or not this is the case?


Thanks!

Guess I don't need to apologize for bringing up the micorwave bomb but after
reading all the responses, I have a few comments of my own.


1.  Science supports the legend as a possibility.


2.  Case histories for actual injuries are sparse indeed.


3.  The manuals on our several microwave ovens have no warnings about the
problem.


4.  I have never heard of a law suit over the issue.


Considering that a ladder manufacturer lost a lawsuit because there was no
warning about putting the feet of his ladder in a frozen cow pie, and McDonalds
paid millions for a hot cup of coffee, my intuition says the issue is more urban
legend that a real problem.


In our litigating society, it is hard to believe that this danger would only be
known because of some caring person on the internet who chooses to remain
annonymous.


It's nice to be aware of the potential problem but I guess I will still sanitize
my cheesemaking glass ware without filling it with marbles.

     I know Phil from down under was just yanking Jack's chain and the

     To keep this somewhat related to beer, I received a can (kit?) of
     hopped malt extract for Christmas which is supposed to be some kind of
     Alaskan smoked amber beer.  Typical instructions included... don't
     boil or you'll lose the hop flavor and aroma, add sugar to get the
     correct gravity, etc... and a small packet of dried yeast which may
     have been abused who knows how.  I just made a wee heavy which came
     out fabulously in spite of under pitching.  It was based on some
     guidelines Al K and/or others had offered long ago in this forum for a
     Tartain House which I've never personally tried.  I saved the yeast
     and have had it in the fridge under water for about 2 weeks.  I intend
     to make a small extract batch using no sugar and the yeast saved from
     the wee heavy.  I will probably try to get the yeast going again in
     advance with a starter just to ensure viability.  I am going to boil
     and chill my water and sanitize the #$%^ out of the can, can
     opener,and spatula and try a no boil batch.  We'll see how it turns
     out.  If it turns out, ya'll will have some 'splainin to do.  If not,

I have to disagree.  But I feel we are discussing an asthetic issue.
Quarter sawn oak has a much nicer grain pattern than does regular cut oak.
But that is my opinion as an owner of a fair amount of a/c style furniture.
Cherry is alos nice though.  There is nothing wrong with cabinet grade oak
plywood in this application. Again we are taking about viusal appeal vs.
actual functional usage.  Hell, might as well make it out of polypropylene.
no rot, rust etc.

But what about the world's greatest a/c brewery. :-)  Again we are talking
about differences in style.  I'll go way out on limb and say my maltmill
(tm) is really a great product that even the movers could not break.  And
my EM (tm) still serves me well after years of use.  But I am talking about
something that I have a passion for.  Not everyone likes Stickley Mission
stuff.


And if I had a shop like Norm abrahms I'd paln down some oak.  Needless to
say i'll have to have a local shop do it for me.

But what style?  Again aesthetics are what we are talking about.  Oh and
I'm dead serious about a/c beer mugs or steins for those who care.
