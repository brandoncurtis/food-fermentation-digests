According to Michael J. Lewis in the AOB Classic Series book on Stout, the
brewing industry (professionals) formulate by percentages of extract.  It is
homebrewers that have fudged things and sometimes report recipes in
percentage by weight.  Without knowing the relative extraction rates among
the various types of malts, it is hard to do an accurate conversion from one
expression of the recipe to another.  (Note that it is probably not fair to
assume that if you have an X% rate of extraction on the average, that you
extract X% of any particular malt's maximum theoretical extract in a mash.
The extraction process is different for different malts and depends on
crush, soluble solids, and the various enzyme activities in the various
mashes and mixtures of mashes.)  Comments anyone?

Subject: Foam space


I just purchased a keg to use as a boiler. It has inspired in me such a lust 
for stainless steel that I am now considering purchasing another one of these 
kegs for fermenting 10 gallon batches in. This keg is a bit smaller than the 
usual 15.5 gallon type, having a 13.4 gallon capacity which works out to 
about 12 gallons usable space. I am wondering if there is enough space in 
this size keg to contain all the foam in a 10 gallon batch during high 
krausen? I've read that one needs about 30-40% headspace in a plastic 
fermenter, however a keg is proportionally wider than a plastic bucket. I am 
wondering if anyone that uses a keg as an open fermenter can give me an idea 
what the typical amount of space the foam takes up is.

Reminds me of the time my wife and I had an apartment in Hoboken, NJ. Every 
now and then the landlord would send a guy by to spray roach killer under the 
cabinets and behind the fridge. We never thought too much about it before, 
but this time we were the new parents of a baby girl and somewhat concerned 
about the chemicals the guy was about to put in our apartment. My wife asked 
him if he thought the chemicals posed a health risk. He said:


"Just take a look at me. I been doin' this kind of work for years, and I'm 
fine."


We somewhat reluctantly allowed him to spray, and after a few minutes he was 
on his way to spray the other apartments. About a half an hour later we heard 
a knock and when I opened the door we found the same guy standing there. 
Thinking that he had left something behind, I let him in and shut the door. 
His eyes widened as he looked around in amazement and said:


"Wow! You won't believe this but a coupla minutes ago I was in an apartment 
that looked exactly like this one. They have the exact same furniture and 
everything!"

Subject: Wild Yeast/'d' tied to beer


Tom reports a phenolic tasting beer which demonstrates two species of
yeast. The smaller guys are pretty certainly a wild strain introduced
somewhere during the brewing process. It is quite common for these guys
to poduce phenolics in undesireable quantities.

Dave forgot the farthing (1/4d and please be sure to notice that the h
is not silent). Also note that the 'd' comes from Latin "denarius",
"...a Roman silver coin originally equivalent to ten asses but
afterwards to eighteen; equivalent to an Attic drachma...". The denarius
lives on in 6d nails and in several middle eastern countries which use
the "dinar" as their currency. Does this have anything to do with beer?
Of course it does. The Bahraini Dinar reproduces on its back a picture
of their Monetary Authority building upon which are mounted large
replicas of four coins from the acient Dilmun civilization. Clearly
visible on one of these coins (on the bank note as well as the building)
are two Dilmunites having a beer. They are drinking through straws from
a large vessel. Obviously I'm interpreting here but the scene looks very
much like other representations of beer drinking from that part of the
acient world. The straws were used to get past the unpleasant material
which floated on the surface of the beer.

Brewers,


Long time lurker, infrequent poster here.


At our club's ,Star City Brewers Guild (http://hbd.org/starcity) ,last
meeting the monthly "style" was actually a clone attempt of Rock Creek's
Black Raven Porter.  We were very fortunate to have Jon Esposito, RC's
President, attend our meeting with a nice fresh keg of Black Raven to aid in
our judging.  Due to our club members participation with their clone
attempts and, in a really big way, Jon's presence and willingness to answer
questions and share knowledge on RC's brewing procedures and recipes, our
Febrewary meeting was outstanding.


I don't know if Jon reads the HBD, he does have a history of home brewing,
but I wanted to get a BIG PUBLIC THANKS out there to him for attending our
meeting.  I would also like to encourage other clubs to seek out ties to
breweries in their neighborhood.  As a result of our meeting we hope to work
with Rock Creek in the future in developing events, competitions &
festivals, and arrange field trips for the club to their facilities.  This
may not seem like much to many of you but the closest brewery to Roanoke, VA
is at least a three hour, or more, drive toward most points of the compass.


I even got to meet a fellow  HBDer, thanks for coming Drewmeister.


Rock Creek Brewing is headquartered in Richmond, VA with brewing facilities
located in Raleigh, NC.  http://www.rcbrewing.com  Check out their web site
and try to find some of their brews.  Besides the Black Raven, Devil's Elbow
IPA is a club favorite while all of their brews are excellent.

Hi all,


I've been a long time member of this list, and an almost as long time
lurker.  The time has come for me to get rid of some equipment.  


I have a bunch (15?) of pin-lock corny kegs that are unfortunately just
taking up space in my basement.  The gaskets have been changed and the
the insides cleaned.  They have been stored for the last 2 or 3 years in
a mild iodophor solution (inside, of course).  (Is this bad???)


I also have 3 (three) 1/2 barrel and 1 (one) 1/4 barrel kegs
(Anheuser-type) that I have done nothing with.  I originally planned a 2
tier/3 tank system, with perhaps, a decoction "keg", but I have just
never had the time to build the system, let alone brew.


I live on Long Island, NY and would prefer to not ship.  I might be
willing to meet people "halfway" with as many cornys/kegs as I can fit
in my Volkswagen (I'm sure I could squeeze more in there than you
think!).  


Please respond privately, if interested, with offers.  I am extremely
flexible.

Subject: conical fermentor angle


In HBD #3241, JOe Gibben asks for a conical fermentor bottom angle.  I think
that 60degrees from horizontal is about the correct angle.  This is what is
sold for the homebrew version of conical fermentors.  The reasoning behind
the angle is the closer to horizontal your angles get, the tougher it is for
the yeast to slip down the sides of the fermentor when they flock out -
making harvest and clarrification tougher.  However, as the angle gets
closer to vertical, the height of the fermentor obviously gets taller. 60
appears to be the industry balance.


Good luck with your welding.  Would love to see a picture when its complete.

Pete Czerpak

I have seen this phenomenon many times.  At the time I saw it, I wasn't
using any finings so I doubt that it is related to the gelatin finings. 
Interestly, if Steve had paid a bit more attention, he would have noticed
that the "fur" was on the same side of all the bottles.  I believe that it
has to do with some sort of temperature differential in the room where the
beer is conditioning.


The cure for the "fur" is to simply twist the bottles a bit to dislodge the
stuff from the walls of the bottle so that it can fall to the bottom.


Anyone care to speculate about the cause??

I've had a similar phenomenon in the past, but the grainy material only
speckled the glass on the bottom 1/4 of the bottle.  I didn't use gelatin or
any other fining agent.  The beer was great, so I chalked it up to being
small yeast colonies which adhered to the glass.  I don't remember which
batch it was, but I guess it depends on the strain of yeast used.  Waiting
to see other responses as I still have reservations on trying gelatin for
the first time (and isinglass as well).

After reading this I want to know two things:

2. Did you check to make sure he didn't hook up the washing machine to the

Pat, I think it is likely that your first guess is the correct one. The foam
stopper is probably allowing air (oxygen) into the flask which will enable
the yeast culture to grow more quickly and probably to a higher density.
Another possibility is that there is some sort of contaminant in this flask,
especially given the long length of time you've been running these
cultures - Not meant to be a slam against your aseptic technique Pat!

Subject: microwaves -  an actual experiment!


This is cool - I tried the experiment. I got a 125 ml smooth-as-silk Pyrex
Erlenmeyer flask, washed it well, rinsed the hell out of it w/ distilled
water then filled it about 3/4 full and put it in the microwave for 10
minutes which was obviously way too long but I was going to stop it after a
few minutes. Unfortunately I forgot about it. the next thing I knew I heard
a big "BOOM" from across the room - nearly the entire contents of the flask
had explosively evacuated all at once! Wow! (although this probably has a
lot to do with the geometry of the flask and may not be as much of a problem
for something with a larger opening like a coffee cup).


So I refilled the flask, reset, this time for 5:30, then I brought it to
/just/ boiling visibly and /carefully/ took it out and /carefully/ lowered
the smoothest thermometer I could find into it - it shot up to 103 degC !!
Cool! I repeated the experiment a few times and each time the measured temp
was between 101 and 103. It is a bit hard to make the measurement as the
thermometer does indeed nucleate bubble formation and if the water is too
hot the whole thing goes critical. This also happened when I bumped the
flask on the microwave getting it out or set it down on the bench too hard.
"Kids, don't try this one at home!"


Well, I am even more convinced now that superheating is a real phenomenon:


The water was distilled lab water so there shouldn't have been enough
dissolved solutes in it to account for the rise in boiling point.
The thermometer was our good NIST standardized thermometer so I trust the
reading.
I was careful to submerse the thermometer to the correct line indicated on
the thermometer's body


The only two things I wonder about are:


1) Is it possible that steam condensing on the thermometer body just above
the water line caused a rise in temp over the 100 degC mark? I'll have to
re-do the experiment with some sort of insulation wrapped around the
thermometer body where it is exposed to steam...


2) Is there something funny about the geometry of the flask - small opening
for the volume contained - that somehow acts to cause a local partial
pressure increase making some sort of mini-pressure cooker effect? (I know
sounds bogus but I am trying to think of things to disprove my superheating
hypothesis...)

 This one goes back a while. Thanks to Jeff for talking about his techniques
for kegging.  It came at just the right time as I had just filled my first 2
cornies and was wondering what techniques I should adopt.  I've since drained
3 kegs and force carbonated at 12-17 psi for 3-6 days.  You guys are right,
CO2 is CO2.  NO differences in force carbonating and my bottled brew.  I was
very pleased at just how easy it is to keg and server perfectly carbonated
beer.
- -----------------------
Don't want to use the M-word, or report anechdotal evidence, but I just don't
see a vast difference between aerating w/pure O2 and not.  I even have on tap
side by side one brew that was aerated for 90 sec w/pure O2 and an airstone
and one brew that was just xfered to the carboy.  No splashing and no
aeration whatsoever.  Both had PLENTY of very healthy fermenting yeast at
pitch time.  Taste them and one does'nt blow the other one away.  Sure they
are different beers, with different grain bills, mashed at different temps,
and fermented with different yeasts (can I change just ONE more thing!) but I
was expecting quantum leaps here.  I've been through almost 50 brews without
pure O2 and only one with, so I'll give it a chance.  At least it didn't
degrade the taste!
 -----------------------
 I'm a very satisfied customer w/Beer Beer and more beer.  No affiliation
blah blah blah.  It seems the 4 kegs that I got from them have the in and out
fittings reversed.  I suspected this when I tried to use the carbonator and
it would'nt fit.  It's true they are switched.  Can I just switch the
fittings on the cornie myself?  Is this a pain or a piece of cake?  Can
someone describe it to me as I am a cornie virgin.  Again BB&MB has always
been very good.  I would just like to start using the carbonator cap and that
cute little portable serving tapper that BB&MB sells.  I can slowly change
the fittings as I fill the carboys.

Short answer.  You made the choice to use wyeast.  But that is not very
helpful. :-)


The stuff is probably no intentionally a mixture, but one never knows what
lurks in that little foil pouch.

Phenolic suggests wild yeast.  I would review all your cleaning and

Subject: Valley Mill Heads Up


Wes Smith's story of his Valley Mill had me thinking.  While I haven't had
the specific problem of something getting into the mill and grinding down a
roller, his experience of the mill stalling and having to be prodded
occasionally is familiar to me.  I suspect this is due to the second roller
not being driven by any gears so unless some grain is between the rollers
for the drive roller to cause the second to turn, then it doesn't.  And if
the grain trying to get to the rollers hits just right, nothing goes
through, the second roller doesn't turn to help the process and things bog
down.  Prodding with a piece of wood, or preferably opening the gap slightly
and momentarily, seems to work.  I've thought of modifying the inside of the
hopper to provide a greater roller area for contact with grain.  This would
allow the mill to grain more grain in a unit of time and give more contact
area to potentially stop this stalling.  Has anyone with a Valley Mill made
such modifications to the mill's hopper?

The flour you buy in your shop will probably not contain all of the bran,
though it will be better than using white flour. The problem you may find
 a subject covered in earlier digests ) that the wheat used at the mill
would be predominantly hard endosperm wheats - breadmaking varieties.


Your US home-grown breadmaking wheats are very hard, and tend to have a high
gluten level compared to the low gluten, soft endosperm wheats used in the
brewing industry in Europe.


High protien is linked to high nitrogen levels too, so beware the haze in
the beer! Mind you, for a proper rendition of Hoegaarden, it must be hazy!!


The most popular wheat for brewing is one called Riband, this is a Class 3
wheat (European classification) and is gradually being by it's siblings -
Consort and Claire. EDME wheat malt extract is made using these varieties.
So if you want to add wheat to your mix, and you want the right stuff but
can't get European raw wheat (I suppose I could start up a business to ship
you some!!), try EDME Wheat Malt Extract. I would go as far to say that
Munton's would be the same, as the last time I delivered grain to their
maltings, there was only the one variety marked up on the bin listing, and
that was Riband.


Strangely enough, Riband, is the most popular wheat variety used by the
Scottish malsters for Distilling.

Subject: I don't think Color is important.


I am not trying to be an ass. While I thought the discussions about how to
measure beer color were technically interesting, I wanted to at least raise
my hand and say that I (for one?) don't think beer color is important, even
when it comes to targeting a specific style.


The reason I don't think color is important is that I think that the driver
is flavor. Whenever you attempt to duplicate a style, you are using a
similar grainbill to that used by the original. So, by and large, whatever
you end up with is almost certainly within the normal color range of the
original.


Or let's say that you are trying to brew a light color style with higher
alkalinity water than the original beer. Eg. brewing Pilsner nearly anywhere
else in the world. You are trying to target a particular malt flavor. If you
add darker malts to balance your alkalinity, you are going to end up missing
your malt flavor target to achieve the right mash. Therefore, you need to
change your brewing water, therefore your grainbill and color will end up
being within the normal range.


I know that most of you (Spencer, AJ, et al.) realize all this and that
Color's Importance is not what you were discussing exactly, but I have seen
many new all-grainers in our club and on the newsgroup, that try to develop
calculations for predicting color and get wrapped around the axle trying to
control it in their brewing. So what I want to say is: "Don't; it is not
important." If you get the other flavor parameters right, and your brewing
procedures are good so that clarity is not an issue, then proper color will
follow naturally.

Hello all,


        A quick follow up to a question I asked some weeks back:  I
inquired about whether or not it's a good idea to run hot water (~120F)
through an activated carbon filter (hoping to knock about 25 minutes
off of my mash in time in the morning.)  A professional filter guy
responded that activated charcoal tends to give off all of the accumulated
crud it's adsorbed when heated above 100F or so.  So keep those filters
cool....


        I wonder what my "hot charcoal bitter" is going to taste like?
Could be ugly....

I like the Idea of using wheat flower but would like to avoid carrying excess

I dont know if it is due to mellanoid reactions, a calcium defficienty, 
or excess tannins leaching from the cork, but my corked beers 
definately develop a musty celler flavor with time.  It really adds 
the "final touch" to some of my big brews and I enjoy the flavor. 
The flavor does take a while (6 to 8 months) to develop.  But since 
these types of beer are ment to last, waiting is not a problem. 


Anyway, I brew a  Bier De Garde every year or so and try to 
cork at least a case of champagne bottles.  Whenever I 
make barley wine I also cork a case or two.   I use straight 
wine corks that I get at my local brewing supply shop.  
My bench capper has a handy corking device that works 
very well.  After corking, I seal the bottles with a standard 
crown cap.  I tried it without the crown caps once and had 
a few bottles push their corks out.  Wire cages work too, 
but the crown caps are easier.

Subject: Yeast looks and growth, and corks


Howdy,


On Yeast morphology: 


        Tom scoped an infected beer and saw two different morphologies of
"yeast."  I have often used a microscope to look at brwing yeast, including
1084, and it sounds like the "two yeasts" you see are in fact of the same
strain.  I often see these different morphologies in medium when the cells are
derived from a single colony.  I have attributed the differences in morphology
to be due to different stages of the cell cycle (based on budding - usually
more ovoid then spherical) or metabolic state (vacuolar size).  I don't know
what the stain is, but it is not impossible that the same yeast would stain
differently based on metabolic state.


        I might thank that the cocci you see are the source of the infection.
Uhm, duh.  But it may be that the taste defects you note are not due to the
infection but due to problems in process.  Like the fact that you
underpitched.  Just a couple of thoughts...


Yeast Growth:


        Another thought, on Pat Babcocks wonder-foam stopper.  If this stopper
allows air through, then I am not at all suprised that those yeast would grow
more quickly and come to a higher density.  Contrary to Dana Edgall's idea
that you don't get much air into a flask (though he was talking about a
stirred flask, which is better for this), I have grown yeast in closed (but
not sealed) flasks in medium that required O2 for growth.  Oxygen gets in.


On Corks:


        I have often assumed that the "musty" flavor was due to the fact that
the beer was corked (either coming from cork contact or gas exchange).  So
when a bunch of Unibroue flooded the mid-Atlantic a few years ago, I bought a
bunch and did a bit of an experiment.  I bought some La Fin Du Monde, both in
capped and corked bottles.  The beer pretty much the same at the time I bought
it (though the corked bottle were a little less carbonated).  After a year or
more of cellaring, the corked but not capped bottle developed a flavor I have
often associated with all the "clearance" corked Belgians and which I assume
are old and I assume have the flavor we are all talking about.  Alan Meeker
and I have have bottled a barley wine in both capped and corked bottles, but
the corks didn't make a great seal and perhaps enough time hasn't passed to
develop the "cork" flavor we are looking for, because the corked bottle sdon't
have it.  Just some "data," and I'll report later with more as this batch
ages.

Greetings,
I have a question regarding bottling with a CP (Counter pressure, not
Charlie P) bottle filler.
I CP bottled an oatmeal stout last month.  It was fermented (OG 1.046) 1
week in the primary with Windsor Ale yeast (dry) and racked to a secondary.
 It spent 10 days in the secondary.  The stout was kegged in a corny keg at
8 psi at 55 F.  After a week, I bottled into four 1 liter ez-cap swing top
bottles.  I ran the bottles through the dishwsher w/o detergent and used
the hot dry setting to sanatize.  I covered the tops with aluminum foil and
chilled in the brewing refridgerator.  I CP bottled without incident.  Two
days later I took one bottle to a homebrew tasting.  The stout was slightly
drier that the original kegged version.  Two weeks later, I took another
bottle to a brew club meeting.  The beer was now very dry and had a fine
sediment in the bottle.  It appears the yeast started back up again after
bottling.  The kegged stout has not continued to ferment.
What happened?  Why did the fermentation restart?  How can this be
prevented?

Subject: Wierd starter and brew


Made my usual 500mL starter solution and pitched a bag of 1056 that was
so fresh it had swollen to the point of seeping from one of the seams of
said bag within 6 hours.  Good start IOW.


All appeared normal for a day, or so, but the "krausen" never fell.  Not
for five days!  The "beer" under the foam looked normal, but a thick
layer of brown topped foam never redisolved.  It smelled OK, albeit a
little phenolic.
I forgot to sample the "beer" and that may have been a big mistake.  I'm
starting to worry it was contaminated.


I followed my usual protocol (i.e. a strong iodophor solution for plenty
of time and a quick rinse with tap water...not ideal but adequate lots
of times in the past) to sanitize the mason jar I make starters in.  I
don't think the sanitizer caused a problem as there was ample evidence
of a good fermentation and the "beer" cleared pretty well.


Now as to the brew itself.  I seem to have read of the phenomenon I am
experiencing in the HBD before but cannot recall what the consensus was.


I boil and cool in converted keg with an immersion coil.  The cold break
I get in the fermenter (carboy) is usually rather fine and settles
readily.  Not this time.  Frankly it looks disgusting.  Big, cottony
globs, floating at all levels of the carboy.  When disturbed they seem
to want to float to the top.
They must settle, but verrrrry slowly.  Also my fermentation is real
sluggish.


My plan is to let it ferment for three or four days and see if the yeast
gets a little livelier, and if not, to pitch some additional dry
(perhaps champagne) yeast to help out what are, obviously, some subpar
yeasties.


Once I feel the brew is adequatly attenuated, I may just crash cool it
to settle out the rest of the "stuff", if it's still floating around in
there.  I suspect it's just some proteiny "stuff" (scientific jargon
alert) and no big whuff, but it sure is scary looking.


Anybody out there encounter either of these anomalies?
