The yeast that he is using (White Labs WLP500 Trappist) recommends
fermentation temperatures below 65 F. If this is not correct yell at me so I
can move my primary fermentor out of the garage and into the warm house

You should be able to do this.  Make sure the keg is not pressurized and
swap the fittings.  You didn't mention if you had a pin or ball lock.  The
pin locks are a bit more of a PITA since the pins can interfere with a
wrench or socket.  I remember seeing somewhere that grooves can be cut in
a deep socket to match the pins.


Most gas fittings (in) have a groove machined thru the hex nut portion.
Williams Brewing (no affiliation, blah blah...) has some good pictures of
various keg parts and fittings.

Subject: What's in the bag...


Howdy,


        JIm Liddil thinks that the two "yeast" shapes in Tom Meier's beer are
in fact two different yeasts.  This may well be, but I would be more convinced
they were different by the differential staining than the different
morphologies.  I was pretty anal about purity of culture when I first started
ranching, so I did a lot of serial streaks to singles and watching the culture
as the yeast grew in liquid.  Now, I never cultured the stuff in wort, so that
may make things different, and I used a 100x DIC scope so I may have been
worried about things no one else sees, but I was struck by two things:


        -A single colony would often show many cell morphologies when
cultured in liquid, and these would change over time.  Restreaking to singles
would again show roughly the same set of cell morphologies...


        -Fully half of the Wyeast smak-paks would show a slow growing cocci
straight out of the bag.  These cocci didn't grow well on YPD plates, but they
grew in the Wyeast starter (aerated)...

Subject: Biere de Garde Flavour - Summary of Comments




G'day All


Well its been a bit over a week since I posted the querry on this type of
beer.  I have also gathered information from posts in the UK.  It's time to
look at what I have gathered to see if any sense can be made about "that
taste" and how to get it. I would like to that those who E-mailed me
privately also on this issue.


The first thing I was surprised at the lack of information on the subject.
While there is a wealth of published information, as well as experts
(professional and lay) on every aspect of brewing, including heaps on
Lambics, yet there is so little available on how to get the earthy flavours
of BdG.  Because of this, the advice I have from people I must take on their
word (assumed correct), and try to make sense of the sometimes conflicting
information.


The following is a summary of what information I have gathered and my
conclusions from that.  If readers have additional information 'i'm all
ears'.  


SUMMARY


There seems no doubt that the corked bottles have something to do with it.
If it was as simple as that the issue would end there, but it doesn't.  The
same BdG beer if bottled in corked or capped bottles, will have different
flavours, the only thing being different is the corked bottle.  Also I have
been advised that some other styles of corked belgian beers will develop the
desired flavour over time.  If you smell the cork of a BdG bottle the smell
is very strong as well.


BUT, no home brewer I have talked to has stated that their corked bottles
ever develops that full on flavour of a BdG, if any flavour at all.  You
would think dry hopping (no-that is dry-corking) a keg of BdG would also
give that flavour, but again, no one will own up that they have tried this
practice and that it works.  Further some other styles of corked beer seems
never to develop that flavour.  The cork issue is compounded with the fact
that the wine industry, as stated in a previous post, tries its hardest not
to get that flavour.  For those who say its the cork alone, the fact that
wine doesn't get that flavour (at least very often) yet BdG does every time
puts a bit of a hole in that argument.


Is it possible that the corks are treated differently - worth
considering!!!!!!!!!!!


A couple of people have suggested that oak shavings help get that flavour,
but I think thats not the direction to take (at least not directly).  


I believe that cork does has a role to play, but not by itself.  The nature
of cork, its porisity, how its made, how it reacts with its environment
could be the key (read on).


While most state its the cork bottles (and this may very well be by reason
of the obvious) there never the less is a significant undercurrent that some
sort of micro-organism is involved.  Evidence is no further away than some
people stating they get a bit of the flavour from cultures from the dregs of
a BdG.  The leading microbe suggested was a Bret yeast but I'm not sure.
Where this microbe comes from is uncertain. It could be environmental, blown
in on the wind, it could get in through the cork, could even be in the cork
(can anyone see where I'm heading yet).


One idea that at first seems stupid was a suggestion it was mould.  I
initially dismissed this, but on reflection it does have some merit.  After
all BdG does have that smell.  Also mould does has an affinity with wood as
well.


The evidence to date is 
(a)  Cork is involved somehow
(b)  There is some evidence microbes might be involved.
(c)  Time is a factor


Conclusion (and please if you disagree I would like to here your comments)


I think the nature of cork, and microbes of some sort react together to make
this flavour.  After all, cork would be a great 'home" for microbes.  One
possible reaction is that mould is growing and reacting with the cork to
give that flavour. (after all, one person said its smell like decomposing
wood). Where the microbes come from is the question(if at all).
They may be already in the cork, or in the cellars. If so any ideas out
there.  


For a Home Brewer, the logic to test this would be to use the dregs out of a
bottle for a culture and the original cork with cork pieces in secondary in
a keg.  I would think any aged wood would possible suffice. This I'm
planning to do.  I am also going to do some plates of the cork and dregs out
of a bottle of La Chollette to see what grows.


I put this post up as a result of my investigations so far.

Given the scale of a homebrew batch and the techniques employed by the

Several comments have been made about  the 60 Degree angle for conical
fermentors.
The answer is unfortunately very simple. It is the easiest and least costly
to manufacture.
The cone is cut from a circle whose diameter is the circumference of the
vertical part and only half the circle is used. If you plot the cuts out on
a standard sheet, this produces the minimum cut with maximum capacity.

Alan: Now try baking the glassware to get all the entrained gas out.
Cool just to the point where you can get water in without cracking it
i.e. get the liquid in before more gas has time to get entrapped.
Haven't tried this but this is supposed to be the way to get really
impressive bumping. Also try a partial immersion thermometer or an RTD.
Have fun and be careful!


John: Quite right - trying to hit a particular color in a beer is a
waste of time but that doesn't mean that color is not of interest or
importance. If you are a good brewer you have some measure of control
over all aspects of the beer not in the sense that you can start with a
clean piece of paper and produce PU but in the sense that if you have a
recipe you should get the same beer each time you brew with it. This
means same OG, same TE, same alcohol content, same pH, same diacetyl
level, same polyphenols... and, of course, same color.  This is
particularly important to commercial brewers for whom batch to batch
consistency is the main goal. It's also important to the homebrewer
beacuse this "house beer" becomes a point of departure for new beers or
for improvement of the house beer. If mash pH is a bit off, varying dark
malt can be used to correct but this will obviously have effects on
color. Water composition, yeast strain, lagering temperature and even
just time also have effects on color. So does the oxidation state of the
beer and doubtless many other things. Lots of neat stuff to study and
experiment with!


My particular interest lies in the fact that SRM is not a particularly
good measure of color. What I call "pseudo SRM" which is the log of
luminance scaled and offset so that it fits SRM over an ensemble of
beers, appears to be a better one. That's what I'm exploring and having
a ball. To measure the color of a beer takes about 2 mL. What do you
suppose I do with the rest?


To all - thanks for rekindling my interest in this fascinating subject.

Joe:
Thanks for your nice words about the F'muth Bock Beer. Fred Schumacher 
(former President of F'muth Brewery), myself and the whole Team at the time 
are still proud today of all the beers we brewed there.
You raised an interesting question of how to express the ingredients ratio of 
a brew.
In discussions with other Brewers, we are used to talk of percentage by 
weight.
Also, we talk about *Plato of the wort knock out, so,,, given this two 
factors, other Brewers can relate to their own IN HOUSE parameters, such as 
yield etc. 
Also, that's why I like to mention the suppliers of the Malt used. If a 
Homebrewer
wishes to brew the type of beer, he/she can phone up the supplier and request 
a
Malt Analysis (of course, if he gets one, that would be another discussion).

my hard drive crashed several months ago and I lost it.  So with my last
batch I played around a bit with it to see if it would come back to me.
Here's what I did...


After primary fermentation of an all-grain dark German lager (with the
whole hops and I think the hot break and cold break efficiently filtered
out from the kettle) I racked to a secondary and put about 3L of water back
into the primary.  After swirling and allowing it to settle I poured off
the stuff that poured out and was left with tan creamy peanut butter
looking stuff.  It looked like there might have been layers in the sludge
but I couldn't tell.  So I added another 2l of water and swirled it all up
and poured it into a lemon-aid style glass cylindrical pitcher and left
overnight.  The next day there were four layers.  The bottom layer was
0.75cm and tan (paper bag color).  The second from the bottom layer was 1.0
cm and was a light tan cream color.  The third was about 3.5 cm and was the
same color as the bottom.  The top layer was just the liquid on top.  Can
anyone propose what these layers are and which I should repitch and how to
separate them?


Why do all the books say we have to repitch almost immediately?  Those
whack packs seem to be good for a couple months or even more.  And I bet
most of those white labs pitchable yeast have been around for a while
before they get pitched.  What is the realistic longevity of the yeast cake
of a primary?

Subject: Aerating--O2 vs. Shaking


I too am pretty convinced that the same quantity of O2 will be dissolved in
the wort whether treated with O2 or shaken.  Do the following experiment
with water.  Start with de-aerated water (boiled for instance).  Put 1/2 a
gallon of the water in a gallon jug leaving 1/2 gallon of headspace.  Put
your hand over the top and shake it for a few seconds (like three shakes). 
Take your hand off and hear the air gush in to replace the air that was
taken in by the water.  Put your hand on top and shake again.  Remove hand
and hear more air rush in again.  Repeat until no air rushes in.  


At this point, I contend that the water has taken up all the air it can
hold for the temperature it is at.  Now, if I remember my physics right,
the water also contains all the O2 it can possibly hold at this
temperature.  This is because the quantity of a given gas that can be
dissolved in a liquid is independent of any other gases dissolved in the
liquid.   That is, just because the air is 80% N2 and 20% O2 (rough and
dirty amounts) it doesn't mean that the water will hold only 20% of the O2
it would hold if it had been exposed to 100% O2. The water holds as much O2
as it can.  Bubbling more O2 through it won't add any O2.


Thus either bubbling 100% of O2 or shaking with air in the headspace (as
long as you replenish the air every few seconds) will result in the same
quantity of O2 in the wort.


Of course the pure O2 method could be more sanitary.


Am I all wet or is this theory valid?

Subject: rice in extract beer / foam stopper affecting starter


Hi all,


J. O'Meara mentioned that he used cooked rice as a kettle adjunct.  I
question this practice.  Rice is essentially starch.  Adding it to the
kettle will add much starch to the beer, which will cause a number of
problems and absolutely no benefits.  The problems include:


1.  A permanent haze that will only disappear once invading microbes consume
the starch.


2.  Invading microbes, no matter how small their numbers initially, will
eventually consume the starch and grow unchecked because your brewer's yeast
cannot eat starch and therefore will offer no competition for that food
source.  The bottles can eventually explode, if given enough time.  My
second or third homebrew batch was an extract-based pumpkin ale to which I
added canned pumpkin (aka, starch) to the brew kettle.  2 years later the
forgotten bottles started exploding in my basement (the beer was pretty
awful and therefore went undrunk).


3.  The beer will taste starchy, which isn't usually desirable (although
taste is a personal issue).


Starchy adjuncts, including rice, corn, oats, raw barley, wheat, etc. must
be mashed with diastatic malts in order to convert their starches into
sugar.  If you are an extract brewer and desire the effect of using rice in
your brew, use rice syrup (available at fine homebrew shops near you).
- -------------------------------------------
Our esteemed janitor ponders the amazing vitality of a yeast culture kept in
an Erlenmyer flask under a foam stopper as compared to an airlock.


I believe that Pat hit on the the two major factors at work here:  lower
pressure within the flask (and therefore less CO2 build up) and better air
flow through the stopper (providing more O2 for the yeast).


It would be interesting to see if one of Pat's other cultures could be
inducd to be as vigorous at this point by replacing the airlock with a foam
stopper.  There is a paper from a couple of year's ago (I can't remember the
reference and don't have time to look it up) that claimed that brewer's
yeast do not readily recover their vitality if they are grown in O2 poor
environments early on and are then offered O2 later.  Pat's yeast probably
wasn't completely O2-deprived, though, so it won't really be testing this
hypothosis.  Interesting, none the less.


Have fun!

Subject: bottle fur, color, Black'n Tan


Brewsters:


Dan Listerman and I have both
experienced bottle fur ( i.e translucent
particles) clinging to the inside of the bottle
and surprisingly all of the bottles are
coated on the same side ( about 1/4
of the bottle) and top to bottom. Neither
he nor I used gelatin or other clarifying
aid in these cases.  He speculates that
it is some kind of air conditioning or
heat flow phenomenon and asks for
speculations.


Although I normally now cover my bottles
( when I do bottle)  by putting them into
a paper grocery bag to keep the light out,
I am not sure ( don't think so)  if this was
the case at the time I saw this.  I also
speculated at the time that  it might be a
heat related phenomenon, but concluded
that it was actually due to light from a
small window not directly shining on
the bottles producing charges on the
bottle wall or on the particles of yeast
or other trub in these  naturally
conditioned bottles.


I theorized that these charges
were neutralized when the yeast
particles migrated to the bottle wall.
The bottles were green, as I recall.


Sounds like an experiment needs
doing!
- ------------------------------------------
While I agree with John Palmer that
color is not important, to a degree,
and that imitating exactly a current
commercial brew is not what I want
to do for reasons that I believe that
pre-WWI British beers and pre WWII
German beers were likely better,
IMHO, others would disagree.


I do believe that hitting a target is
an important step in developing
and proving your brewing skills.
I also believe that BJCP fulfills a
valuable role in promoting good
brewing skills and satisfying some
brewers' desires to compete.
Color is one parameter in judging
and needs to be considered.


However, just focussing on the grist
composition and saying the color
will be "in the ballpark" as John
contends is not necessarily correct.
Boiling technique - how long, how
big the kettle, covered or not, will also
have an effect on color and taste.
In the small volumes we deal with, this
technique will likely be more
important than on a large scale.
- ------------------------------------
Chuck Myrglot asks how one can
pour a black and tan that is separated
as in Guinness and Bass. The answer is
a final gravity FG difference. The
lower FG is poured last.


How can you make them? Use
different mashing profiles in which
the higher FG beer will get the higher
mash temperature in an infusion mash.

I agree but note that a fair number of English brewers add caramel to
darken their bitters.  It seems we do drink with our eyes.  This, of

The Guinness has a lower final gravity (and OG as well), so it floats on
top.  You also need to have minimum mixing in the glass, so keep the
carbonation low.

Subject: Adjustable MaltMill vs Unmalted Wheat


Please allow me to fan the grain mill flames:


Jack has lamented, here and at r.c.b., that there
is no need for adjusting/adjustable MaltMills. He
says that the fixed/set .040 gap is adequate for
most grains. (This is NOT to say that Jack thinks
adjustable MaltMills are not necessary, just that
they don't necessarily need to be adjustable.;)
After 3 years and hundreds of pounds of grain, I
would agree. However, this past weekend I made my
first plambic which included 5 lbs. of raw wheat.
Thank Jack my MaltMill is adjustable!


[Background: When I first purchased my adjustable
MaltMill, I marked the widest and narrowest gaps
on the endplate. On a scale of 1 (narrow) to 10
(wide), the factory set gap fell at 6-ish. As a
grain-crushing neophyte, I played around with
double-, fine-, and coarse-crushes, but for the
past few brewing seasons, I've left the gap at the
factory setting. (FTR - my Recipator-calculated
efficiency runs 75-85%, depending on OG.) I've
also been using a 9.6v drill to power the mill.]


My first attempt at the factory setting jammed
instantly. I adjusted to the widest gap and poured
the raw wheat through in a steady, narrow stream.
An inspection of the first crush showed a mix of
compressed, cracked, or split kernels. A second
pass at the factory setting realized mostly cracked
and split kernals; and after the final pass at the
narrowest gap, most all the kernals were halved or
quartered. This grist was combined with 9 lbs. of
Beeston's Maris Otter (crushed at factory setting)
and a half pound of rice hulls. A turbid mash (a la
Boon, with rests at 135F and 156F) was conducted.
The sparge, though a tad slower than normal despite
hotter than normal liquer, was uneventful - I use a
Fil's Falsey in a 10 gal Gott. My OG - for a 6 gal
batch after a 3 hour boil - was 1053, with a
Recipator-calculated efficiency of 65%.


So Jack, et al, I believe that the adjustability of
my MaltMill was directly responsible for the success
of this brew session. 


FTR: I have absolutely no affiliation with JSP, Inc.,
have never viewed the APoftheW, or supped the WGB -
despite brewing less than an hour away.
