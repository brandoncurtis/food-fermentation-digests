Pete Calinski wrote "How often do you let more air into the carboy".  In my
experience it takes only a few shakes for most of the air in the headspace
to dissolve into the wort."


OK Pete - I must admit that I went to carboy shaking a while back because I
had an infected batch and I decided to try and close up my system.  Run off
cool wort into a settling carboy thru sanitized tubing.  No more collecting
wort in a pitcher and transferring via a funnel to my settling tank.  I
bought a 6.5 gallon carboy for this part of the process.  After the boil my
batches finish up at 5 gallons +/- 1 pint so there is plenty of head space
in the big carboy to allow for some vigorous rocking and I get quite violent
action with lots of foam and bubbles in the wort.  I cover the mouth of the
carboy with aluminum foil and I have to believe air can enter the carboy,
however the whole idea was to keep the air in my basement brewery away from
the wort.  So far so good ~ no more bad beer.


BTW check out Wayne's (the Botanist Brewer at Big fun Brewing) web site 
<http://member.aol.com/bfbrewing/BigFunBrewing.htm>.  He's made a special
rocker for carboys and kegs.  I've got to make one and maybe put a motor on
it.  My kids are all grown but maybe you young guys could rig it up to rock
a kid to sleep at the same time it aerates your beer.


Anyway, I've acquired a sterile filter and stainless stone that I intend to
hook up to my aquarium bubbler and go back to that type aeration, at least
until I figure out how to infect another batch.

Mark Vernon posted to explaine how he transfers from primary to secondary
using a Fermentap.  I'm not sure I understand the need to transfer to a
secondary if you have the ability to remove most of the spent yeast and
trub?  Isn't the purpose of such a device to avoid having to transfer to a
secondary to get the beer off of the trub and yeast?

Regarding Phil's theories,


    I have never brewed barley wine.  However once my brew is bottled I
store my them in cardboard 6 packs and flip-top bottle case containers. 
They are placed in a dark closet, in the upright position, and maybe two
or three are disturbed as I check development.  All of mine have
developed the fur.  All this before I started receiving HBD!  (grin)

Subject: Biere de Garde




Thanks for reviving my personal interest in this style.  Great
timing. 


Just to play devil's advocate here, but one mans "earthy musty"
flavor, may well be another mans oxidation problems.  Taste is very
subjective, and the difficulty is compounded when dealing with obscure
styles rarely seen or tasted in their prime.  If Michael Jackson
tastes a vintage bottle pulled from an underground cellar, then it
might get described as "earthy", but that doesn't mean it tastes like
dirt.  BdG is a style that's meant to be consumed fairly quickly (for
a 17P beer), usually brewed in Feb. and Mar. and consumed in the
summer.  If that's not the case, then the beer must be cellared
appropriately, and I doubt most US importers and retailers do such.


I would caution against making too much from a few uncontrolled data
points before becoming convinced that some mould spore is going to
make your beer improve.  The chances to me seem very slim.  It seems
more likely to me that poor cellaring is the driving force, and if you
appreciate that flavor, it's certainly easier to obtain than
controlled mould growth.  I would try to contact some of the brewers
(or out of business brewers) directly to gain insight.  These days,
it's not that difficult.

Subject: Low pH extract experiment


HBDers,


I am the one that asked the question a few weeks ago about how to raise the
pH of your mash. My water out of the tap tests very acidic (around 5.0 or
so) and my mash drops into the 4's. One of my questions was how this level
of acidicity is affecting my beer.


I had many responses. One suggested I try an experiment using RO water and
extract in a basic pale ale and see any differences. I brewed this last
weekend.


The wort in the kettle tested right on at about 5.3 pH (with Micro Essential
test strips). When I took samples I also noticed a lot of hot break - much
more than I usually get in my all grain brews.


I chilled it in the kettle with an immersion chiller and when I took a
sample of the wort going to the fermenter I was amazed to see about 1.5 in.
of break material quickly fall to the bottom of my hydrometer flask. I have
NEVER seen this much break material in my all grain brews and my question
is:


1. Is this large amount of break material benificial?


2. And, if it is important, why am I not getting it in my all grain batches?


I do have very soft (as well as acidic) water but supliment with brewing
salts like gypsum or CaCl to levels suggested in the literature.


Thanks for you help.

Subject: honey,continuous O2, and O2 data


Vance mentions his 10 day long fermentation with Wyeast 1056 and 2lb of
honey.  Well, honey is a noted slow fermentor (why meads are in primary for
quite a long time).  10 days is not too long for primary.  I would probably
let it go for a few more then rack to secondary.  if you bottle at this
point and the honey isn't totally consumed, you risk high carbonation levels
or maybe even the dreaded bottle bombs.  plus are you at cold winter temps
or in the 62-70ish range.  1056 can be slow even at 62 especially if you
dont use a big starter.


Ron Laborde asks about a 4 hr continous air feed to a just pitched batch.
this is the way that yeasts are raised in the biotech industry in order to
maximize yeast production and limit alcohol production.  in fact, the yeast
are fed sugar and O2 incremetally to get them to reproduce rather than make
beer.  since they are continuously using the O2 when reproducing, it is best
to feed them continously in the first few hours of fermentation when they
most need to reproduce to get a high cell count. if I had a pump, I would
certainly use it for the first few hours after pitching.  i am however a
swirl the fermentor brewer though even though its not optimal.


I did think that the posting of the old data by George and AJ was quite
useful to see.  this might push me to get an airstone and pump. I had never
thought that it would take so long (~10 minutes of mixing) to get 100%
possible DO in water.  I actually probably swirl my carboy for a minute or 2
and its probably 90% full rather than the 50% full used in the experiment.


The key still is: pitching enough yeast can offset many problems.


Regards and happy brewing wkend.

Subject: Comp Q's, CAP


I was sending beers off to some competitions this week (Boston & Brooklyn)
and I was disappointed to find out that both of these competitions only
allow a brewer to enter one brew per subcategory. This bums me out because I
have two Pilsners that I would like to have evaluated side by side. I want
feedback as to which is better and wanted some unbiased opinions (although
last weekends blue-ribbon gives me some indication).


Can any competition organizers out there explain why this rule is in place?
If the primary purpose of a competition is to provide feedback to a brewer,
then the rule makes no sense. If the primary purpose is to hand out ribbons,
then I can see why it is so.

On the subject of using Bavarian Lager yeast on a CAP, I can say it works
nicely. It does give more of a malt profile than may be desired, but it
still tastes great. I made one last winter with 2206 and 20% polenta that
scored in the 40's at the HOPS-BOPS in Philly. Haven't made one this year.

Actually, I believe the US adapted the British 
standard gallon of the day, but then the British
changed it. Being independent by then, the US
never resyncronized.


Legend has it the change was prompted by a fire 
at Greenwich, which destroyed the building the

standard itself. In an amazingly SI-like moment, 
the Powers That Were decided to make the new 
standard equal to the volume of 10 pounds of 
fresh water at mumbleteen degrees at sea level.

JGORMAN`at`steelcase.com asks:


>has anyone ever used Wyeast Bavarian (2206 I think) for a CAP?


I haven't, although I may have used the same strain from YeastLab or YCKC.
Most any lager yeast will make a fine CAP, but a friend had diacetyl
trouble with the Anheuser Busch strain.  Other strains will produce this,
too, under certain temperature regimens.  My original CAP was with the New
Ulm strain, which is sold with the caution that it is not a pilsner strain.
Whatever.  Worked fine for me.  Some strains emphasize the malt, others the
hops.  Both can be fine.  My favorite for a couple of years has bee YCKC's
new Ayinger strain - a really fine yeast.


>What is the preferred adjunct?  Rice?  Corn?  Both?  I once read someplace
>that you want about 15%?  What amount do others use?


I far prefer corn.  Rice is quite neutral in flavor.  I think that white
corn is more neutral than yellow.  I like the subtl;e corn sweetness and
flavor from yellow corn.  I prefer cornmeal/grits/poletna over flakes only
because I like to do a cereal mash, but flakes are easier and have the
corniness I like.


15% is too low by my standards and historical standards.  I usually use 22%
by weight (I'd guess this might be 25% by extract but I've never gone to
the trouble to work it out).  30% by extract is about the maximum I'd like,
and is about the maximum I recall seeing in 100 year old recipes.


I have 1/4 bbl. of Your Father's Mustache lagering right now for MCAB II.

Recent postings here claim that half of Wyeast products contain cocci
bacteria. We produce #3278 Belgian Lambic Blend which contain cocci
bacteria, but that is a very small portion of our business. Not anywhere
near half.


Wyeast produces brewing cultures for homebrewing, winemaking and hundreds
of commercial brewers, many on a weekly basis. Many breweries use the same
homebrewing packages propagated to volumes adequate for 10 barrel
production, harvested and repitched for many generations, and produce gold
medal winners at the GABF. 


Our products are shipped weekly to major malt producers to evaluate their
malt quality and fermentability required by the largest brewers in the world. 
Many commercial brewers have utilized our services continually for more
than 10 years. Our products are tested for purity and viability at our
facilities as well as our customers. Our products are under the microscope
by our customers routinely, we expect that and would not be in business if
we did not produce the quality they required.


Wyeast has always addressed any issue our customers have had, directly
responding to questions, inquiries or problems. For example, if products
get damaged from heat in transist, we respond promtly to solve the problem
to the customers satisfation. In addition to providing brewing cultures, we
provide information to brewers solving technical problems or brewing issues
they may have. We have microbiologists, professional and home brewers on
staff to provide the services our customers expect.
  
So when someone makes a microbiological diagnosis from a keyboard, doesn't
that seem quite incredible?  Maybe one should consider the source. Jim

I checked my bottles last night and sho nuf the fur seems to be on one side
of my 1994 vintage barley wine.  Messrs. Sides and Listermann have
commented that the fur is on one side.  This indeed seems to be the case.
The bottles I have are in a cardboard box.  That static electricity thing
is an interesting theory, but what about orientation?  For example, can
homebrew be used to locate magnetic north?  Does the fur point in one
direction or to the nearest cardboard?  Just think, perhaps it's not just
for drinking anymore but can help get me out of the woods if I get lost?
Homebrew holds the answers to life, the universe and everything!  Can
anybody check out this theory?  Let's hope the answer isn't 42.

To quote Rob Moline, "The More I Know About Beer, The More I Realize I Need To
Know More About Beer."   Here's your chance to act on that philosophy, learn 
a lot
more about beer, and have a great time at MCAB in St. Louis.


What is MCAB?  The Masters Championship of Amateur Brewing (MCAB) is a 
grassroots amateur brewing championship. The format of the MCAB is a small, 
invitational "champions' championship," where the very best amateur brewers 
compete 
head to head in the some of the most competitive styles under ideal 
conditions, and 
with the highest quality judging.  Eleven of the most prestigious local 
competitions in 
the United States and Canada have been selected as MCAB Qualifying Events. 
First 
place winners in eighteen selected Qualifying Styles at each Qualifying Event 
receive 
an invitation to enter the MCAB in that style. The MCAB is sponsored by 
Brewing 
News, the Home Wine and Beer Trade Association, the Home Brew Digest, and the 
Foam Rangers Homebrew Club of Houston.


What's happening in St. Louis?  The Second Annual Masters Championship of 
Amateur Brewing and Technical Conference (MCAB2) will be held in St. Louis, 
MO 
March 24, 25, and 26.  MCAB2 is hosted by the St. Louis Brews.  In addition 
to judging 
the best homebrewed beers from the US and Canada, MCAB2 will include a pub 
crawl 
of St. Louis microbreweries, a technical conference featuring some of the 
best brewers 
in the nation, a can't-miss award party, and a private tour of the 
Anheuser-Busch pilot 
brewery.  The St. Louis Brews are also busy brewing a variety of great beers, 
including 
real ales, for the event.   The Technical Conference Preliminary Agenda is 
linked to the 
registration page (see below).  


Why should you attend MCAB2?  MCAB2 will bring together the best homebrewers 
and 
those that want to become the best at a low cost, high quality technical 
conference 
featuring speakers who made the hobby what it is and those that will help 
carry it 
forward.  The informal aspects, though, may be the best part of it all.  
MCAB2's small 
size provides an unequaled opportunity for the attendees to meet each other, 
learn 
from each other, expand their homebrewing networks, and have a good time.  
You 
should be part of it, and I hope you will be able to join us.   If you don't 
think you can 
make it, please reconsider what you will be missing!


Is there a cost?  There is a $50 registration fee for attending MCAB2.  What 
you get for
your registration is pub crawl transportation (and a free beer here and 
there), technical 
conference (including lunch and refreshment breaks), awards party (including 
dinner), 
an MCAB2 pint glass (if you're inclined to taste a homebrew or two), door 
prizes 
(including a bag of Moravian Pils malt) and a private tour of the 
Anheuser-Busch pilot 
brewery.  $28 of the fee is food, paid directly to the providers. The rest 
pays for the 
facility and conference expenses.  We're working closely with the restaurants 
to 
establish the menus. You're gonna love it! The Brews break even at one 
hundred 
attendees, so don't worry that your fee is lining some fat cat's pocket!   


How do you register?  You can register on-line on the St. Louis Brews 
website, 
www.stlbrews.org.  You may also contact the organizer for information and 
mailed 
registration materials (see below). 


Where is MCAB2 being held, and where can you stay while you're in St. Louis?  
MCAB2 will be held at the Hampton Inn Union Station, 2211 Market Street, St. 
Louis, 
MO  63130, phone: 314-241-3200.  A block of rooms is being held for us at a 
discounted rate.  Please mention the Masters Championship of Amateur Brewing 
when 
you make your reservation.  We ask that those coming from out of town stay at 
the 
Hampton Inn; we're getting the meeting rooms for free if we fill our block of 
rooms.  The 
Hampton Inn is on the western edge of downtown, two blocks from both the 
oldest and 
the youngest St. Louis microbrewery.  Union Station, two blocks east, is a 
restored 
masterpiece of turn of the (last) century railroad station architecture that 
was the 
busiest station in the country during the 1940's.

In answer to Jim Olen's request for infomation on correspondence courses
in lieu of the Siebel Institute's Craft Brewers Certification Program, I
say look no further. The Institute is reopening for regular classes starting
March 20.  An announcement will be forthcoming in a day or so but go ahead 
and sign up for classes at the Siebel Institute now! Remember, we can only run
classes when people attend so don't put it off any longer!

Dear Friends of the Siebel Institute:


We have some exciting news to share with you and that is that we have
formed an alliance with Dr. Pearse Lyons and the Alltech Company in
Nicholasville, Kentucky.  We are particularly excited by this because as
you may know, that company has for the last 20 years been heavily
involved in the area of fermentation as it applies to distilled
beverages and fuel alcohol.  The company, like ours, is firmly based in
brewing.


As of today, February 9, 2000, Alltech has agreed to take over the day
to day running of the Siebel Institute and you will be pleased to know
that we propose to continue everything as it was before.  The courses
that have been arranged will proceed in the normal way and we expect to
improve on these.  The courses will resume their normal schedule
starting March 20, 2000.


Over the next few weeks you will receive from us different press
releases and announcement regarding changes, all of which will be for
the better.


We are very excited now as we move into this new millennium that we do
so with even more vigor.  We look forward to the Siebel Institute
growing for the next 128 years.  Please don't hesitate to contact myself
or Dr. Lyons if you have any queries.


Thanking you once more for all your support over the years and we look
forward to maintaining the Siebel Institute as the world 's center of
Brewing Education.
