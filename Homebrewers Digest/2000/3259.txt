I brewed a smoked sweet stout that took 3rd place in the Green Mountain
Mashers competition last year.  I used 1/4 lb of peated malt and there
was a good smoky flavor.  This fall a brewed a smoked porter and used
1/2 lb because I wanted some intense smoke flavor but barely got any.


My notes indicate that I crushed the stout grain the day before brewing
(I don't have a mill so I use the one at the store) and I crushed the
grain for the porter about 6 days before brewing.  In fact, I recall that
by the time I brewed my porter it was hard to even smell the smokiness
of the grains (as compared to a fresh crush).  IMO, for fresh crushed
peated grains, a little goes a long way.  I will use small amount of
fresh crushed peated grains from now on.  Also, IMO, it's better
to underestimate and use more grain the next batch than to use too
much the first time and have something you don't enjoy drinking.

Jay,


First of all, I'm jealous of your great score.  While I was at the AHA,
I had a similar question from a homebrewer in Alabama.  I didn't know
all the answers, so I took his number and actually called Guinness. 
They were very cooperative and had me in touch with one of their draft
specialist within 5 minutes.  I still don't have all the answers, but
here are some points that may help.


1) The kegs are only carbonated.  Use just CO2 and carbonate as you
normally would for a stout.  The mixture of gas is for
dispensing/pushing.
2) I believe that the mix is 75% Nitrogen and 25% CO2.  From everything
I've read and heard, the mixture of gas needs to be done while their
filling the tank.  (You can't just fill the tank 3/4 with Nitrogen and
then top it off with CO2.)  No worries, however.  Most of the gas
companies are already dealing with the mix and will have it.  (There are
one or two Guinness accounts in Baltimore.)
3) As for the serving pressure, I've heard of a fairly wide range to
have it "perfect".  Since there are many factors - temperature,
restriction, length of beer line, final gravity - you're probably just
going to have to play with it.


Hopefully, someone else can help with some of you other questions.  I'm
glad that you like Five Star products.


Slainte!

Subject: Hefeweizen:  need for secondary?


Howdy all,


Russ asks if he needs to transfer his Weizen to a secondary fermentor.


The simple answer is "no."


I have made Weizen at home both using a secondary and not, and have found
the secondarydid not really improve the beer.  In fact, the more you
transfer a beer, the higher the odds of you messing it up in some way
(infection, oxygen pick-up, etc.), so minimize the number of transfers.


I have found that many beers could be made without a secondary, but it
really depends on the style of beer and yeast that you use.


Have fun!

From: "A. J. deLange" <ajdel`at`mindspring.com>
Subject: Wort Dilution


The following may be a bit much but it will at the least keep the
following couple of column inches from being used for ad hominem
attacks.


When I saw Stephen Ross's post on "Total Gravity Units" I said to myself
"This is a rough approximation suitable for use with $2.00 hydrometers
but not for the true  geek." and started playing around with some
numbers. I thought the results somewhat interesting. The "Total Gravity
Unit" method is quite accurate and this derives from two things. First,
though degrees Plato are a somewhat non linear function of specific
gravity, when degrees Plato are multiplied by specific gravity to
compute grams of extract per liter, which increases slightly with points
( S.G. = 1 + points/1000), this boost flattens out the negative
curvature of the Plato curve so that the amount of extract in a given
volume of wort can be pretty well approximated (1% error or less from
1.005 to 1.090) as linear i.e. by simply multiplying the points by a
constant  (0.2585875 for grams/L). By comparison, a linear approximation
to degrees Plato (the number of grams of extract in 100 grams of wort)
will be in error by up to 7.9% over this same range.


Second, the dilution factor is computed from


(gm/L before dilution)(Liters before) = (gm/L after)(Liters after) =
total gm extract


thus dilution factor is the ratio of two approximately linear functions:


(L after)/(L before) = (gm/L before)/(gm/L after) = dilution factor


If the errors in (gm/L before) and (gm/L after) are small (1% errors
are  small) and are of the same sign, and they are, then these errors
partially  cancel when the ratio is taken. Denoting (gm/L before +
err_b) as the value of the linear approximation to the grams per liter
before dilution and (gm/L after + err_a) as the value of the linear
approximation to the grams per liter after dilution


(gm/L before + err_b)/(gm/L after + err_a)  is approximately equal to


(gm/L before)/(gm/L after) + err_b/(gm/L before)  - err_a/(gm/L after)


Note: 100*err_b/(gm/L before) is the percentage error before and
similarly for after dilution.


DISCUSSION:


Degrees Plato can be calculated from specific gravity points by


P = -0.0035 +0.2585875*p - 2.2229E-4*p^2 + 1.36E-7*p^3


where p are the points (example: wort with s.g. 1.040 has 40 points).
These coefficients were obtained by a least squares fit to the ASBC MOA
tables. They give a result very close to the official ASBC value


P = -616.868 + 1111.14*SG -630.272*(SG)^2 + 135.997*(SG)^3


including the result that a wort of SG 1.0 is -.003 Plato.  This small
error is accepted for the sake of better approximation over the more
usually encountered range of gravities. The grams of extract per liter
of wort are found by multiplying P by SG, the specific gravity i.e. (1 +
p/1000). Carrying out the multiplication (ignoring the -0.0035 term)
gives another polynomial:


gm/L = 0.2585875*p + 3.62934E-5*p^2 - 8.6E-8*p^3 + 1.4E-10*p^4


Note that linear coefficient is the same for the Plato and gm/L
polynomials but that the quadratic (p^2)  coefficint is an order of
magnitude smaller in the latter polynomial and the cubic (p^3)  is
smaller too but not by so much. These coefficients determine the amount
of curvature and thus the gm/L curve is more linear.


This should be enough to allow the few interested to explore further.
Independent of dilution calculation the gm/L approximation may be of
interest for those wishing to calculate the amount of extract acheived
(the total is the gm/L multiplied by the number of liters of wort) for
efficiency calculation. As noted above gm/L = 0.2585875*p is accurate to
a percent or better up for p ranging form 5  to 90.
gm/L = 0.2585875*p + 3.62934E-5*p^2 is good to within a quarter of a
percent over this same range.


HOW ACCURATE IS THE POINTS RATIO METHOD?


Stephen's example: 5 gallons of wort at 1.050 to 1.045. The dilution
ratio from the points is 50/45 = 1.11111111 and five times this is
5.5555555 gal. The "correct" solution demands we calculate the grams/L
at 1.050 which is 13.007 and the gm/L at 1.045 which is 11.699 and take
the ratio. This gives 1.111804 which brings up another interesting
point: you can work in gm/L but the volume ratio is valid for any volume
unit you desire. Thus 5*1.111804 gives 5.5590 gallons as the desired
diluted volume.


Let's try a more dramatic example: 1.090 wort to be diluted to 1.045.
The points ratio gives the dilution factor as 2.00000. Five gallons
would be diluted to 10. The gm/L for 1.090 wort is 23.510 and so the
dilution ratio calculated more precicely is 2.000957. Five gallons
should be diluted to 10.047. The points ratio is defintely "close enough
for govenment work" in both cases.

Jeff, about that Spam, I think that since it is such a RARE occurence on the
HBD that folks point it out because it is a backward way of asking, "is
everything ok or is something broken?"   Anyone have a recipe for SPAM beer?
hehehehe


I am responding from memory so I don't remember who asked about using peat
smoked malt in a porter, but I did make a couple of scottish ales lately and
found that 1/4 lb gave me just the right amount of smoke flavor.  2oz was
barely perceptible and I would be careful about using more because I don't
like a real smoky beer.


Then there is the post by 'Dick' who has been brewing the same 6 beers for
30 years and not really cleaning up his bottles and equipment to no ill
effect?  hmmm I wonder if you just drink them fast enough that the infection
never takes over.  But, if you improve your process, I am sure you would
notice an improvement.  Nope you don't have to if you don't want to, but you
might try it just as an experiment.  For myself, I need to be concerned
about cleanliness and sanitation because I brew far faster than I can drink,
therefore my beer has to be able to maintain a long shelf life.

Subject: Rollmaster Grain Mill


Back in December I received some feedback on purchasing a grain mill from 
various HBD subscribers and wanted to advise you all on my selection and 
results.  I received positive feedback on several manufacturer's.  It seems 
most homebrewer's have been satisfied with their mills.  These included the 
Valley Mill, JSP Malt Mill, Phil Mill, and the Rollmaster.  ( I also have a 
Corona Mill at home).  Thanks to all who contributed.


I wound up purchasing the Rollmaster Mill, by Environmental Marketing Group, 
inc. (303-795-8646) thru Beer, Beer, and More Beer (1-800-600-0033) 
http://www.morebeer.com/cat.html, for $195 including shipping.  I purchased a 
tupperware box with front drawer, a few nuts and bolts and a feeler guage 
totalling $20.  I mounted the mill on 1/2" plywood and cut a hole in the top 
of the tupperware box and mounted the mill on it.  For now I don't mind hand 
cranking.  It usually takes 20 - 30 minutes to weigh and crush, which saves 
about 1 hour going to a local brew shop.  I usually have all ingredients on 
hand unless using a new yeast.


While the Rollmaster cost a little more than the others it has some features 
I preferred such as"  2" rollers, coarse knurl, maple frame, 8 - 10lbs. 
hopper, and  continously adjustable from both sides.  


I have crushed two batches worth (50lbs.) and have acheived the similar 
efficiencies as the local brew shop who had a JSP Mill.  Thus so far I have 
been very happy (by the way, I have no affiliations with any of the suppliers 
mentioned above).


Cheers,

" Thou shall choose the yeast called Edme.  Thou shallt pitch at the rate

Interestingly, this rate of about 10 grams dried yeast per 5 gallon batch is

Summer 1998, it declared that it would take  full responsibility for
this exceptionnal brewery. Rodenbach is the only brewery in the world
making a brown-sour beer through the "mixed fermentation" process, the
so called "Flemish Red Ale". Essential in this process is the 18 to 24
months maturation period into 300 hugh oak barrels of 100 to 600 HL
each. During this maturation, the organic acids are tranformed into
esters, this gives the Rodenbach beer the aroma and taste profile of
wine. Palm has always been dedicated to preserving the unique, authentic
Belgian beer culture.  We are keeping our word!


At the time of the takeover of the Rodenbach Brewery, it was on the
point of collapse.   In one year, Palm  succeeded in reversing  the
desastrous decline of Rodenbach Classical which is now growing again.
Palm Brewery has invested 70 million Belgian francs (+/- 1,8 million
US$) in media, POS-material, and in above - and below the line -
actions.


Moreover the Palm Brewery is also investing 170 million Belgian francs
(+/- 4,2 million US$)  in the Rodenbach Brewery estate.  The objective
is to transform the Brewery into a pole of attraction  in the region and
to draw many visitors to the brewery.


The Rodenbach Grand Cru beer  is the "mother" of Rodenbach  beers and is
consisted of 100% aged beer. Tbe good news is that of course Rodenbach
Grand Cru is not being withdrawn. Palm Brewery has just invested in the
re-design of the label. Rodenbach Classical is a blend: one part aged in
oak barrels from 18 to 24 months (20%), and the other aged five to six
weeks (80%).


On the other hand, production of Rodenbach Alexander stops in 2000.
Alexander Rodenbach was first brewed in 1986, the 200th anniversary of
the birth of Alexander Rodenbach, co-founder of the Rodenbach brewing
tradition. Rodenbach Alexander is therefore a beer brewed for a specific
occasion, and also for the 150th anniversary  of the Brewery. Rodenbach
Alexander is a "KRIEK"-beer based on extracts. A real "KRIEK" is
traditionnaly made from 100% "LAMBIEK", Rodenbach Alexander is not. That
is why Alexander is not credible for real  connoisseurs of beer.  The
Palm Brewery is working to preserve  authentic Belgian beer culture:
Rodenbach Grand Cru is part of it , Rodenbach Alexander is not.  On the
contrary, "KRIEK BOON" , a real KRIEK beer promoted by the brewery Palm,
is made from 100% "LAMBIEK". Please verify on the bottle of every KRIEK
you drink if the beer is made from 100% LAMBIEK. If it is, you have the
real thing, one of Belgium's  real regional beer styles.  Besides this,
the volumes of Alexander Rodenbach hardly  represent  half a day's
annual production.  In order to be able to invest more in the real
traditional thing, the Rodenbach Classical and Rodenbach Grand Cru, we
must stop producing Alexander.  We want to maintain the credibility of
Rodenbach as a regional Belgian beer style.  Rodenbach Alexander is
detrimental to the authenticity which is precisely what we want to
promote.


We hope we have managed to convince  real beer connoisseurs to help us
in supporting  "the real thing", namely Rodenbach Klassiek & Grand Cru,
and not the "would-be" beers such as Alexander and many other beers on
the market.


We take this opportunity to invite you to visit  the  Palm Brewery and
Rodenbach Web site.  There you can learn more about Belgium's real
regional beer styles.(www.palm.be) (www.rodenbach.be).

Bill,


Hello.  I've now brewed a cherry stout 2 times and it seems to my personal
preference that an imperial style, with its heavy sweetness and large mouth
feel, is complimented quite well by the almost sour flavor of certain
cherries.  I add them in secondary and then make sure to go to primary as it
does take some time for it to finish out.


Best regards,
Julia Herz

Thank you sincerely for your well placed and cogent post.  For those who
don't remember their high school chemistry: "salt", "aspirin', "beer".
Hey, I went to school too, all-be-it a long time ago, but I never
thought I would ever use that "stuff" again.  Perhaps the group in
question should also go back and take another look at psycology 101.


As for Pat and Karl... I prescribe judicious amounts of all of the three
items listed above and fervently hope that you both would reconsider
allowing us to place your names in nomination for at least some official
office.  We need you guys and would not have near as nice a place to air
our various opinions without you.  We all should be, and most of us are,
forever in your debt.  Thank you.


I even remember enough Latin to translate the two phrases in the posts.

Subject: Big "G" Faucet and Nitro Dispense


Jay Spies writes asking about recommendations for hooking up beer gas
(N2/CO2) and a Guinness faucet.


Do not run out and buy a nitrogen regulator if you already have a spare CO2
regulator. You can buy a $10 adapter (sold by the gas supplier) that will
adapt your CO2 regulator to fit the N2 tank used for beer gas.  I've done
this, and I've hooked up a friend with this set up.  It works.  I also
traded in a spare 
20 lb. CO2 tank to get the N2 tank used for beer gas.  The beer gas cost
$18 + $10 = $28 total cost.


The first time I attempted a big "G" clone using my big "G" faucet I
precarbonated it as usual.  This resulted in too much carbonation and did
not result in the anticipated smooooothness.  Next time around I think I'd
force precarbonate about 1/2 of normal, say to 6 psi over a few days or
alternatively, I may try 100% beer gas.  One thing I feel strong about is
not to carbonate fully beforehand.  I do not think it necessary to force
your beer out at 30 psi to generate turbulance, however, YMMV.  I'd run
mine at the normal (for me) 12 psi.  When you watch someone pour a pint of
big "G" it does not come spurting out at high velocity.  It takes time and
(to me) appears to be closer to a dribble.

Subject: pitching rates, etc.




whenever these lines get drawn in the sand regarding pitching rates,
oxygenation, HSA, whatever, many people seem to lose sight of the
distribution on this forum.  there are many beginning brewers who come
to the HBD for advice, and simply need help with the basics.
instructing them to pitch a healthy amount of yeast and maintain a
stable cool temperature is good advice in these circumstances.  once
brewers have advanced to the point of making good quality beer, then
they can start playing around (if the desire) with some of the more
esoteric concepts, such as slow ferments, pressure ferments, pressure
cookers, etc.  then they can look forward to many hours spewing venom
at people who do things differently than themselves.  it would be nice
if the more advanced brewers would consider a dialogue of sharing
different techniques and reasonings, rather than simply critiques of
others, IMO.  there's more than one way to swing a cat.

Nic,


        The subject of this message is about the number 1 piece of advise one
can take when reading HBD.  I fully agree with you - some of this stuff
is way above my head.  I have only a few batches under my belt and I am
still very content when I crack open a bottle and it tastes like  beer,
complex or not.


        Paul wrote -  "You're in over your head alright.  Over your head in the
B.S. that is the                         HBD. Put on yer tall boots (better yet, waders) and
jump right in. " 


 Isn't this the same for just about anything you come across?


        Paul also wrote - "You are not meant to understand it.  Because the sole
purpose 
                most of what is said here is meant to impress the writer with 
                his ability to regurgitate meaningless reference and re-iterate 
                what they learned in college chemistry 101.  I've had Chem 101, 
                201, and 301 and still do not see a lot of use for most of the 
                chemistry related information that is posted here. "


 Yes, just like any other group, you will have those whom are gifted
enough to have a certain established knowledge but not the wisdom enough
to decern how to properly present it.  There is a ton of knowledge
presented in HBD - straining it threw can be a strain.


        Finally, Paul wrote - "That said, I heartily recommend the HBD as a
source of good                         basic brewing information.  Just take it all with a
grain of sodium chloride, ..."


 Best statement of them all.  Just remember - if all else fails - refer
back to the title of this message.  Either that or take up basket
weaving...

Being an inquisitive guy, I frequently wander out in the neighborhood
looking skyward to see what up there in and amongst the air and trees.
Occasionally I step in dogshit, but I keep wandering and wondering
nonetheless.  It's worth it me.


Debates rage on as to who knows what, who can tell you how to fix this or
that, or how you too have been led into the muck like a shmuck.  We would
all be well served to think critically about any and all things -- whether
that is how to make better beer or how best to clean one's shoes.  Use or
loose what you find in this forum, but for chrissakes, at least question
why.


I for one have always found Steve Alexander's posts to be amongst the most
well thought out AND implementation neutral posts seen this way since Andy
Walsh. Some seem taken that he is simply a number spitter and doesn't
actually have the objective function (good beer) working in his
epistomology.  Seems to me what he does is offer a current understanding of
topics as they relate to threads that arise here.  I never once heard him
say unqualified to "use high pitching rates".  Why others are challenged by
his research synposes baffles me. If you don't get the take home message
fine.  Ask.  If the problem is with the person, not the ideas, go for a walk
and mull it over.  I also dont think I ever heard him reject triangle tests
as a valid protocol for assessing outcomes.  Steve, whacha think of triangle
tests?


Which brings me to today's quiz:


>From the following experiment:


Q: How long does it take direct sunlight to lightstrike a beer?


*Blindfolded triangle test with two independent testers
*Treatments invloved direct sunlight (july, midday, 38 degrees Lat.,
cloudless sky)
*variable of interest: exposure time
*Homebrewed Pilsner of moderate-high BU (~40)
*experiment adminstrator--  all samples poured into standardized vessels and
either put into sunlight for prescribed duration or left at rest in shade.
Six samples for each duration, half with sun exposure, half without.


* Three samples of each duration set were smelled by each tester. Gloves
were used to nullify any possible tactile interference wrt condensation on
glass.


* Taster asked to idenify skunkiness in samples.


A: a) 60 seconds        b)3 minutes             c)10 minutes    d)none
detected
Answer at 11.
