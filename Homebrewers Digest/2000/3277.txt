Subject: New Belgium Brewery


This last Monday (13 March 2000) my best friend and I visited the New
Belgium Brewery in Fort Collins, Colo.  A very neat place indeed--if any
of you ever see their beers (they are in ten states now), by all means try
them out.  I'm actually not so fond of their flagship Fat Tire Ale; almost
every one of their other beers is excellent, though.  I even like their
Blue Paddle Pilsener, which is strange, because I generally hate lagers.
Go figure...


Anyway, they have an interesting new technique which I thought that I
would share with you all.  It's called, I believe, `wet mashing' (yes, I
know that _all_ mashing is wet; I din't invent the name).  What it
involves is `mashing' the _uncracked_ grains in a seperate mash tun for a
lenght of time, then grinding them and mashing them for good.  The idea is
apparently that the post-soak grinding process yields a more intact husk
which in turn leads to better sparging.  This, at least, was the
explanation the girl giving the tour gave us.
  I imagine that what happens is that the cracking process becomes more of
a squeezong process and the husk simply ruptures at one point, squeezing
out the kernel without shredding to pieces.  Just a guess, though.


Has anyone heard of this?  Is it worth attempting on a homebrewing scale?

Subject: Macintosh Calculators


Simon asked for information on Macintosh brewing calculators.


I forwarded to him the Brewer's Worksheet and the necessary brewer's
macros (Excel) which I found helpful a few years ago.  I downloaded
this from one of the popular homebrewer's websites out there a few
years ago.  (Forget where now.)


I got tired of having to open the macros worksheet at the same time as
the worksheet template and have since added MANY other features to the
original version for my own purposes.  (Lot's of calculations on
theoretical gravity, expected post-boil gravity, boiling time
variables, more accurate calculator for IBUs, color caluclator for SRM
and Lovibond, attenuation, fermentation section, calculation alcohol
content, revised grain specs, allowance for adjuncts, etc. and a new
format.)


It really is very different, but I have not been able to find Darryl
Richman, the originator and owner of the copyright, to perfect it and
to make available to others.  Does anyone out there know how to find
Mr. Richman?  I think he would appreciate some of the changes I've
made to his original version.

Subject: Lynne's yeast counts


First, a big note of thanks to Lynne O'Conner for posting her results of lab
tests done on commercial yeasts!


Some comments and some questions:
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wyeast XL cell counts varied from 15-70 billion in the fresh packs. Pitched
directly in 5 gallon batch this yields about .5-4 million/mL.  In short,
about 2- 10 times below commerical pitching rates (for ale).  I should add
that only two small Wyeast packs were tested and the results were
consistent with large packs, i.e. less yeast proportional to volume ratio.


The self-contained starter in Wyeast packs, even 6 months old, works.  Cell
counts in 6 month old packs risen to 1" were within a factor of two of
fresh packs.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lynne, were these  /viable/  cell counts and do you know if they were direct
counts (using a microscope) or were they from dilution plates?


There has been some discussion recently on the microbial purity of
commercial yeast cultures, was any contamination testing done with your
samples?


- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
White Labs yeasts had total cell counts which were a little less than
Wyeast XL.  White Labs cell counts were essentially unchanged after 1
month.  At 2 months, cell counts had fallen nearly an order of magnitude.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ouch! That order of magnitude hurts! Your White Labs results indicate that
one should keep the age of the commercial yeast starter firmly in mind!
These White Labs results aren't too surprising as yeast viability typically
drops off sharply with storage time. What is interesting is that similar
large decreases didn't occur in the 6 month old Wyeast samples (again,
assuming the counts reported were for viable cells).


Yeast viability during storage is dependent upon a number of factors
including; temperature, yeast energy reserve stores (glycogen, trehalose),
and the presence of oxygen to name a few. At a glance, it looks like Wyeast
may have a better handle on optimizing these parameters for long term
storage of their cultures.


- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Furthermore, I would like to emphasize that
It's best to pitch Wyeast when pack is 1" thick, not when it's fully risen.
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Why at 1" rather than fully risen?




The differences between the results of your tests and those reported in the
'98 Zymurgy are indeed intriguing. Anyone else have any independent data to
share??

Subject: GM Foods (Again)


In the recent past, there was debate (and acrimony) over genetically
modified grains/foodstuffs on the HBD. I present this note from the
"National Center for Policy Analysis" to the HBD not as endorsement or
rejection of GM foods, but your reading enjoyment (and to stir the pot
again).

EUROPE AND AMERICA GO SEPARATE WAYS ON BIOTECH FOODS


It is somewhat symbolic of the international debate over genetically
modified seeds that U.S. executives of the Swiss company Novartis are
stumping the country to assure nervous farmers that big grain companies will
buy crops grown from their modified seeds. Yet executives of the Gerber
Products Company -- which is owned by Novartis -- have announced that they
will not use biotech crops in their baby food. Not that the products are 
unsafe, just that baby food "is a very sensitive area."


It now appears that American farmers are not backing away from genetically
modified seeds. In fact, executives at some of the nation's largest
agricultural companies say it may be too late to turn back the clock on GM
crops. The problem is that it is costly and cumbersome to separate GM from
non-GM produce -- meaning that the likelihood of commingling the two is very
high.


   o   In Europe, the trade in GM seeds and foods has virtually 
       stopped -- while in the U.S. the growth of GM corn and 
       soybeans has exploded.


   o   Almost one-third of the U.S. corn crop and about half of 
       soybeans are produced from GM seeds.


   o   Biotechnology plantings here increased from 16 million 
       acres in 1997 to 62 million last year.


   o   This year, the amount is expected to stay mostly flat, 
       with more than 60 million acres of GM corn and soybeans 
       planted.


About 80 percent of the corn and 60 percent of the soybeans harvested here
are used for domestic consumption and animal feed. 


In 1996, when American farms began shipping biotechnology crops to Europe,
exports of corn and soybeans -- both modified and conventional -- amounted
to nearly $3 billion. But as of last year, such shipments had declined to $1
billion.

Subject: Re: Sight Glass (tube) Components/Sources


Herald asks about sight glass tubes


Mine is made of glass. Though some have built them out of all kinds of stuff.
Teflon tube, Silicon tube, any thing that is semi clear and will tolerate the
heat. I got my assembly for a 6-pack and a smile from my local plumber. Open
your phone book and look in the yellow pages under plumbers and find a really
old plumbing Co.  (Something & Son and & Grandson...) Specifically look for one
that is still working on Boilers.


My sight glass is a commercial sight glass off an old boiler. They did ask me to
purchase new glass (for safety reasons), which they cut to size for me. Also see
if they have the brass safety rods. These have a gravity fit and run through
holes either side of the fittings parallel to the sight glass. This way you can
swing a cat* or a brew paddle around and if you were perchance hit your sight
glass with it, the safety bar will absorb the shock, and you wouldn't have
emptied 12 gallons of 180F spargewater on the floor of your brewery. The latter
occurrence is also prevented (on my system) by the fact that my sight glass
fittings are also valves, so in case of breakage I could turn them off and
prevent spillage. I could also replace the glass during a brew session if I
wanted too.


My welder had a hard time figuring out how to install it though. Apparently he
had never worked with a sight glass before, and since neither had I, we kinda
went down a more expensive path than we needed too. His theory on how to install
the sight glass was that after it was assembled, you couldn't screw both the top
and the bottom in, without removing the glass. And if you did remove it and
screwed them both in and tried to slip it in, it would leak because the fitting
would have to be too loose. Or if you tightened it up, you would break the
glass. So according to his theory, what you needed to do was to install a pair
of unions that you could tighten down independently. So my system has this
beautiful pair of Stainless Steel Unions on it that are totally unnecessary


Why? Because you can in fact remove the glass, install the fittings
independently and then insert the glass between them. That is how they are
designed to work. The glass is attached to the fitting with a rubber gasket
compression fitting. First you have your glass and you insert the brass collars,
then you put on a tight fitting rubber gasket, and install the glass in place.
The collars are threaded on the inside and come down over top of the gasket and
are tightened onto the fitting. This pulls the gasket down against the fitting
and then compresses it against the glass providing a water-tight fit. So don't
over tighten!


8$ for the new glass and a 6-pack, for the device and some more coin for the
unnecessary welding. I could have drilled the holes out, expanded them and built
a bulkhead fitting for the inside of the keg, but that is too much work, and my
welder enjoys my beer...


I hope to see you all at the MCAB!!!!! And be sure to identify yourself as an
HBD'er by putting HBD on your name tag It was really cool last year too get to
know so many of the faces of the personality's I'd been reading over the last
few years.

Subject: Puffy yeast packs + mash out


Dave Burley asked...>>I was puzzled by the comment to pitch (presumably to
a starter) the Wyeast
when the packet ( regular or XL?) is only expanded to 1" high and not to
wait until it is fully expanded. It seems to me that it would be better to
have yeast fully developed to minimize contamination. Please expand your
discussion. Why?<<


I think a one word answer would be because of glycogen levels. Glycogen
being beneficial to the reproductive phase of yeast's life cycle it is best
to pitch a little bit after high kreusen when glycogen levels are highest.
Granted it is impossible to peek into a smack pack and know exactly when
fermentation has slowed slightly; but if you wait til it stops you are
ensuring lower glycogen levels. right, more than one word
 .....................................
S.A. in #3273 recommends not wasting time with a mash-out temperature
boost. If efficiency was the only factor maybe it would be a waste of time,
but there are at least a couple of reasons to raise the grain bed to 170 at
mash out. The primary reason would be to denature the enzyme system and fix
the Real Degree of Fermentation where you want it. The anecdotal evidence
of only a few points of efficiency variation points to this, compare 1 lb
dextrose in a gallon of water =1.036 vs. 1 lb sucrose in 1 gallon=1.044,
same percent solution, lower specific gravity with shorter chain sugars.
Not a problem if you brewed light bodied beers but for a beer with some
body you want to keep the temperature up to prevent reentering the beta
amylase range of activity. B amylase does remain active long past
"laboratory findings" oft cited. Read about the effects of calcium on
enzyme stability. Secondly: mash out, for some as yet undefined reason,
enhances head retention. Possibilities are suggested of the formation of
glyco-protein complexes that are foam positive. Thirdly: there are the time
and energy factors, after finishing a mash I'd like to save time and get up
to a boil as quick as possible, it is much quicker getting to a boil from
170 than 140, and it saves gas, about  40%.
   Caution should be used of course to not exceed 170 to avoid tannin
extraction, a real case of more is not better. So do a mash out at 170, it
will stabilize the results of your mash temperature program and probably
improve foam stability.

as much as I can.


I have purchase several books, but can find no mention of using water that
has been treated by a water softener.  I have hard water with a lot of
iron, and need the softener to remove the iron.  I then use a post carbon
filter, followed by another filter to remove chemicals and smell.  Is this
acceptable?  Even though the sodium level is raised?  (though this could
add to flavor couldn't it?)  I have considered a reverse osmosis system,
but most only output a trickle of water that would take half a day to fill
a 5 gallon container, not to mention the cost of the system.


Please advise to any options that I should consider. . .beyond going to the

I would like to find a way to ferment during the mild winters here in

My first idea is some type of warming box I could put my carboy in with a

lightbulb as a heat source.  Anybody have any experience with such a device?

Subject: Big Brew Recipe - SNPA Clone (Nearly Nirvana)


OK; a couple of questions have come up regarding my submission of the
Big Brew recipe and I would like to comment on them. First, a
disclaimer. I LOVE THIS BEER! OK, now on to the reply's....        


While I have brewed this all-grain recipe 18 times, each time I have
taken an element of this and modified it. The recipe I shared with Paul
is the closest I have gotten to achieving that SNPA flavor as it comes
out of the bottle. One thing that Paul suggested that we drop out is the
one pound of wheat that I normally add to ensure good head retention. He
was correct in mentioning that SNPA does not use wheat in their grain
bill for SNPA. I will contact him to see if it is not too late to add
back that pound as part of the pale ale grain malt (bump it from 7 to 8
lb..). 


Someone mentioned that my efficiency must be pretty good to get to 1.060
range on just 7 lb.. Half of the reason is above (add the one pound of
pale ale malt or wheat), and the other half is that I do typically get
efficiencies in the high 80% range. Adjust as you see fit. Nine pounds
of base malt will get you there if you get low 70's.


Someone asked about the range that they have seen for Alpha Acid for the
Perle hop. Using my ProMash recipe formulator, I get 39.4 IBU's FWH with
8.0% aa Perle hops (for just the Perle addition). The total IBU's for
this recipe (assuming Cascades of the 5-5.1%aa) is about 46 ibu's, a tad
high for the style, but to my liking. I have used whatever aa% Cascades
and Perles are available, on the market, at the time of my brew. Your
result's may vary...


Someone else asked if I didn't cut down on the Cascades. I did. This
particular recipe closely approximates the actual flavor of SNPA.
However, I have found it to be increasingly yummy and to my liking
(gads, I am stating that I have improved on the SNPA formula TO MY
LIKING!) by using a full ounce of Cascades at 15 minutes, a full ounce
at 30 minutes (not in the recipe I supplied Paul) a full ounce near
knockout and a FULL ounce dry hopping during the last week of secondary
fermentation, for a total of 1/4 pound of Cascade in the process. To
some this may seem excessive, to the members of the brew clubs I
frequent (i.e., hop heads), this appears to not be overkill.


Paul, if it's not too late, let's add back the pound (7 to 8 lb.) with
the caveat that I achieve mid-80's efficiency. Wyeast 1056 is definitely
the recognized yeast for this brew, but i have been assured that White
labs WLP001 California Ale Yeast is virtually identical (and I have used
both side by side with no noticeable differences).

Ah, but is the cooling performance due to the parallel coils or the higher
flow rate or both?  How about running an experiment with the higher flow
rate for just one set of coils and the lower flow rate for both and provide

I just bought my first house complete with a new deck.  Given that the

Most of the "color" difference in beers is really in the "lightness"
or "darkness" anyway.  Obviously you won't be able to use (easily,
anyway) words like "straw", "amber," "copper," "brown" and so on, but
as you gain experience, you will know what a beer of a particular type
is *supposed* to look like to *your eyes*.  This is the most important
thing.


Color is very unimportant in the grand scheme of beer judging (2
points, more or less out of 50.)  Let your partner judges comment on
the color.  You concentrate on flavor, aroma, mouthfeel, all of which
are more important to bhe overall enjoyment of the beer anyway.


During your practice sessions, you might want to keep on hand some
glasses of beer of known "color".  As I recall, Bass is about 10 SRM,
Michelob Dark is about 17, Budweiser is about 2 or 3.  You should be
able to judge beer color "closely enough" for judging by quickly
comparing the beer sample to the "reference samples."

Can you provide inofrmation on the protocols used for this analysis? Was
counting done via microscope or coulter counter? If using a microscope was
it with methylene blue?  Are the cell counts given "total"    or
"vialbe" cells?.  If "viable" how was viability determined?  Determining
viability on samples of les than 90% viability wiht methylen blue is
problematic. Ideally one should use th elside culturee method.

How can you call into question this data when you yourself say that your
sample size was small?  How is it that your testing is anymore or less
valid than that in zymrugy?  One can find the counts I got on white labs

I think you need to take a refresher course in precision and accuracy.  In
no way does such a small sample size "ensure accuracy"  One could probaly
get a Ph'd post doc to this for free. :-)

Subject: Good old Ballard Bitter Recipe?


I have a tale of woe...


I lived in Colorado for a decade and a half, and, somewhere in there, 
I discovered what I considered to be the finest beer in America - 
Redhook's Ballard Bitter.  What a nose!  Great hop bite!  And just 
the right hint of diacetyl to make it one of the most wonderful of 
drinking experiences (especially when drinking it on tap at the West 


But the pressures of society crashed down upon me, and six years ago 
I was forced to move to the Washington, D.C. area, where Ballard 
Bitter requests were met with a glazed, inbred look and pithy 
comeback of, "Wha?"


I've since moved to Chicago, where beer flows a-plenty, and was 
finally (after three years of searching here) I finally 
found...BALLARD BITTER!


But, alas, 'tis not the same.  The label now says "IPA" and the taste 
is all wrong.


So I did a bit of net research, and found that Redhook has, in fact, 
changed the recipe.  Too bad.  It now blows dead farm animals.


So I was wondering if anyone out there had a respectible clone recipe 
(preferably all grain) for the OLD Ballard Bitter.  I sure would 
appreciate it...


Thanks for lending an ear...er, I mean _eye_,


Chris

I've had 5 gallons of apple cider in a glass carboy for about
3 weeks now and it doesn't show much sign of clearing.  The
cider was fresh pressed and then frozen with no preservatives
or pasturization.  The cider was thawed and the only thing added
was 4 lbs of brown sugar and some pectic enzyme.  I used a dry
ale yeast to ferment.


Can something like bentonite or isenglass be used to help
clarify?  I'd like to make this a sparkling cider, bottle

additive?


I'd really appreciate any ideas.

Subject: Rice Beer And Other Matters


Darrell Leavitt asks if anyone has experimented with rice for the production
of light summer beers. I have been mucking about with rice for some time and
my conclusion is that it makes an excellent "ladies" beer. I don't intend
this as a sexist comment. I don't suggest that all ladies must be "ladies".
I once knocked about with a girl around the wilds of Boggabilla who fancied
stout with a drop of sump oil in it. Well that was about how it came in
Boggabilla.


I wouldn't want to go to the other extreme either by suggesting that Eric
Fouch is a "man's man",  though he has been spotted drinking rice beers in
Atlanta bars. Didn't see you at the Mardi Gras this year Eric, are you
slipping?


The first rice beer I ever made was a Czech style pilsner ( now calm down
Doc Pivo, get off that keyboard and let me finish) where I substituted just
under a quarter of the barley in the grain bill with rice. It was an
experiment. I cooked the rice and added it to the mash. I had pots and pans
and boiling water and mash all going at once and it was a hell of a
business. All too hard I concluded. But the end result was a light bodied,
very light coloured crisp beer which Jill and her girlfriends went ape over.
And I do mean ape, Doc Pivo - you might like to experiment with this
yourself! The scenes in the billiard room were extraordinary. Six scantily
dressed women leaning precariously over the billiard table, taking shots and
hoofing into my rice beer.


I've been making rice beer ever since!


The second time I tried getting crafty by cooking the rice the day before
brewing. But this turned into a congealed glob which gave me a dreadful time
during lautering - I would have gladly aborted this one for the trouble it
caused me - but I was determined to get another rice beer out on line, and
the girls were banging at the door! Another success resulted.


Third time round I switched to flaked rice and the process became infinitely
easier. I wouldn't bother trying to cook the rice again. So Darrell to
answer your question, I have experimented with rice beers and have been
forced to keep making them. Be a bit careful not to over hop as you are
dealing with less malt for balance. And lock yourself in the billiard room!!


On the other matter, I see Steve Alexander asking for more than 8kb writing
space in the HBD. Come on Steve, you can't be serious?


I think Pat and Karl have done a great job getting the HBD to run just the
way it is. Steve, if you can't get it out in 8kb perhaps you will need to
write a book, or maybe you will have to shorten that signature of yours,
every byte helps.

Subject: pH and me (or where is my hot break!)






Hi -


So I need some information. Clear. Distinct. Just the sweet stuff.


What is my pH supposed to be, AT ROOM TEMPERATURE, at the following stages of my
brew day -


Mash-in (i.e. I've combined my malt and water and it has been thoroughly mixed):
<answer here>


Wort just before starting to boil: <answer here>


Wort at end of boil: <answer here>


The reason I ask is that I just brewed a 1.066 IPA that had virtually no hot
break. I figured it was because my wort pH was too low (5.0 `at` 70F). But when I
started reviewing my numerous brewing texts and online resources to learn more
about what went wrong, I noticed that there is seldom EVER a reference to what
temperature the pH they are referring to is being taken. And what with the
difference in pH between 70F, 155F (-.3?), and 212F (-.?), I have to say that I
don't know what to believe. I use the expensive pH papers, and I assume (?) that
I have little choice but to let my samples cool to room temperature before
taking a measurement. So that is why I would appreciate a simple,
straightforward, "this is what your pH is supposed to read at room
temperature"-type answer. And could you just humor me and state your responses
in the following format: pH `at` temperature (i.e. a pH of 5.0 `at` 70F)? Thanks.


Oh, yeah - and please excuse my tone. Not only did I not have any hot break, but
I had a stuck mash using Beeston's Maris Otter for the first time, I ran out of
propane part way through the boil, and my PSB chiller turned my boiling-hot
last-rinse-before-knockout water an interesting yellow color.


It will probably be my best beer ever.


You all are the greatest -

Subject: Big Brew Recipe Adjustment


Thanks to all who pointed out the gravity deficiency. I believe Crispy has
already posted a correction but here it is again if he did not. When we
discussed the recipe, I removed the 1 pound of wheat Chris uses, since
Sierra Nevada claims not to use any. The brain freeze from the porter
milkshake I was working on left me numb, and I forgot to add back those lost
gravity points in the form of two row. Duh. Crispy's system gets huge
efficiency, so we have added a ninth pound for those of us who are less
efficient brewers or have less efficient systems. Adjust the amount of two
row based on your system efficiency, so that your target o.g. is 13 Plato.
The target f.g. is 2.8 Plato. The target IBU is 46; feel free to adjust your
hop rate based on alpha. As we are in the second half of the hop year,
expect the alpha to have dropped slightly from the alpha listed at
packaging.


Anyway, before Crispy and I worked out the correction he went back to his
notes and liked some of his hoppier variations. He recommends we go hoppier
at the flavor and dry aroma stages with an extra half-ounce at each point.
SN does not claim to dry hop the PA as they do Bigfoot, but we have left
this as a part of the recipe as a means to achieve that great cascade aroma.
For you hopheads who wish to deviate further, Crispy has suggested an
additional half-ounce of cascade at thirty minutes, with the understanding
that you are going above and beyond the SNPA clone. Here is the adjusted
recipe:

Subject: Unitank Ale Conditioning


I have brewed lagers and know that there seems to be a fairly defined 
protocal for the secondary fermentation timing and temperatures, ie. after
the primary fermentation has subsided to either do a dyacital (sp?) rest or
to just bring it down slowly a few degrees per day until you get down to
lagering temps and hold for X amount of weeks.


For ale conditioning it seems much more vague. I have heard everything from
letting it sit in the primary (on the yeast) for as much as 3-4 weeks at
fermentation temperatures, to "crash cooling" it (mostly in brewpubs) to 32F
soon after primary fermentation has stopped. I have even heard of brewpubs
monitoring FG and crashing the beer to stop fermentation when it gets to
where they want it.


Doesn't ale also have to go through a secondary fermentation so the yeast
eat up all of the nasties and clean up the beer? How long does this take?


I ferment in a SS conical and am able accurately control temperature and
also to pull trub and yeast from the bottom. I am wondering how the brewpubs
do this. I had a great email from Charles Hudak a couple years ago about how
he did this but I lost when I moved computers.


So, here are some questions for those of you who know about what they do in
brewpubs. Note, this pertains only to ales:


When do you pull off the trub? When do you pull off the yeast? You can't see
the krausen in a unitank so do you just go by bubbling activity?  Do you let
the beer sit and condition before taking it down to 32F or so? Why have I
heard 32F? What about lower temps?  Do you actually "crash cool" it as they
say or do you step it down slowly? Do you control FG in this way? How long
do you hold it at this very cold temp before transfering it to the bright
beer tanks or kegs? Does the beer then need to condition more in the BB
tanks at serving temps?


I know that with different yeasts you will want to do different things and
will get different results....  What I am looking for here is some general
post-primary techiniques used by those who ferment in conicals with the
ability to accurately control the temps.


Thanks!

I can see Steve Alexander is going to tell me that Doc Pivo and I obviously
went to the same reading school. I have accused Steve of asking for
something he didn't, naughty me.


Steve wasn't asking for more than 8kb for himself, just overall volume. The
whole problem Steve, comes about because the recalcitrant USA refuses to
operate to Australian time zones. This means that unlike you I don't get to
peruse the HBD over a bowl of weeties at breakfast. It arrives for us in the
late afternoon. The girls and I have usually knocked back a few rice beers
by then and things are getting pretty lively in the billiard room. Suffice
to say when I get up next morning I have a very distorted view of what I
thought I read the night before on HBD. And I refuse to read it twice!


As for Doc Pivo, as he advised, it is hard reading anything whilst squaffing
down an ash tray full of cigarette butts - you really have to get onto
this rice beer Doc, it'll keep your hands off butts forever!!


Sorry to misquote you Steve, can't promise I won't do it in the future. I
mean to say, the real truth is I slipped it in at the end of my last post
without alluding to it in the subject title just to be sure you really are
