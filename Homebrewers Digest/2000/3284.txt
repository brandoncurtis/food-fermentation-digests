Subject: Harvesting Yeast


Having just finished my first brew using a built up starter, I find
myself looking at a primary fermenter with about an inch of yeast bed
and wondering how (or if) to save it to repitch.


Is it necessary to separate the yeast from the trub (grain and hop
particles mostly)?
How should the yeast be stored? Refrigerated or frozen? Should it be fed
before storage? How long can it be kept before reuse? Any printed or
'Net sources for this info and more/


I don't really want to get into culturing yet, but the idea of
propagating and reusing a living resource really appeals to me. Not to
mention saving a few bucks on fresh yeast with every brew.


Does this sound like false economy? I look forward to reading any
responses.

PS- I'd like to meet the person who can activate a Wyeast packet by
"smacking" it between his/her palms. I had to squeeze mine like a wrist
exerciser to pop that bubble!

"Jeff, I'm not sure that the granules are ruptured much in
milling.  In fact, most milling (especially corn) is
designed specifically to avoid rupturing the granules."
- --- --- --- --- ---
This appears to be correct. The starch granules are pretty small - ca 5-10uM
in diameter for barley and wheat, somewhat larger for corn (2-25uM) thus
it's hard to see how much damage would come about due to milling at the 1mm
level.


Isolation of starch involves a wet milling process followed by grinding,
slurrying, and sieving till the preparation of intact granules is free of
water.


The granules themselves are pretty interesting. They're semicrystalline,
having a concentric shell structure, like an onion. There are both
crystalline as well as amorphous zones with some evidence that the
crystalline zones are mostly amylopectin.

Steve writes:


"I have, in detail, and I've even reported on it here.
Calcium has a major impact on one isozyme of ALPHA-amylase
Calcium has been shown to stabilize MICROBIAL beta-amylase,
but I've never seen a report on grain BA stabilization with
calcium - it is possible tho. If it is a grain BA cofactor then
it is most likely to be effective at a few ppm, (equimolar conc w/
enzyme) It's the nature of the multivalent ion enzyme stabilization."


Steve, barley alpha amylase is indeed stabilized by calcium and it is also
required for enzymatic activity. Interestingly enough, it does not seem to
play a direct role in the catalytic mechanism, rather it appears to act by
maintaining the active site of the enzyme in the correct conformation.


Beta amylase does not have any requirements for cofactors or metals (thanks
to Marc Sedam for pointing out to me that I made too sweeping a statement on
this point in my criticism of Fix's book, I meant to refer only to the alpha
amylase).

MCAB II was an enormous success and the St. Louis Brews should be
commended for doing and absolutely spectacular job of organizing the
event. I had a GREAT time!


Special thanks should go out to Bob Boland, John Sullivan and Mark Naski
for making it look easy. And for all the club members who brewed beer
for the event and helped iron out the multitude of details, we should
all raise a glass for a toast in their honor. Their beers were
fantastic--each one better than the next.


Thank you for a wonderful weekend and for those of you who could not
attend, you really missed something special. The St. Louis Brews are an
asset to both their city and to the homebrewing community.

 Bill Bunning asks about an overcarbinated BW:


"I was wondering if I could pop the top to relieve some of the pressure
and then recap.  Will it affect the beer much?  I figure the headspace would
be fine since it would be filling up with carbon dioxide."


I dunno Bill, some amount of oxygen will probably get into the headspace.
Enough to do damage? Hard to say. Also, how are you going to know how long
to let the decapped bottles sit before re-capping? Wouldn't it be better to
let it lose some of this excess CO2 just before you drink it  - either after
opening or after pouring?

Two quick answers, followed by a series of MUCH longer
ones:  (1)yes--it does
make you a librarian, and (2) yes, I know about Ph.D.'s in
cereal science.
You're looking at a former member of the American
Association of Cereal
Chemists! (Hold the applause and gasps of amazement for
later.)  I was a food
scientist in a former life and came mighty close to calling
that a profession.
I still have dreams of getting my Ph.D. in fermentation
science from Oregon
State University--a branch of their Food Science program


Well, we're both right.  There are processes for both wet
milling and dry
milling corn.  I was thinking primarily of wet milling,
which is precisely how
pure corn starch is refined.  I believe that in dry milling
the starch granules
are damaged, but not to the point of
gelatinization/dispersion.  I doubt a ton
of damage is done when you're milling to achieve coarse
grits, but more would
be done in trying to make polenta (or corn meal).  You
simply can't gelatinize
a granule in the absence of water without extreme heat
and/or pressure.  
Disrupt?  Yes.  Gelatinize?  No.  What
likely happens is that the disrupted  granule provides
cracks (pores, whatever
you want to call them) where the enzymes can access some of
the native starch
in the presence of water.


Pure corn starch does get thicker as you boil, but the peak
viscosity is not
the final viscosity.  The true peak viscosity occurs when
the granules suck up
the water just before dispersion.  It's easily measured in a
Brabender
viscometer, but lacking one you'll have to trust me.  Your
reference to the
rice cooking is spot on.  All starch granules first swell,
then gelatinize,
then liquefy from the release of the water which took part
in the swelling of
the granules.  The charts are in my lab book somewhere,
getting dust in the
corporate library.  Flames from offended scientists are
welcome, as are
experiments if you have access to a Brabender or a
differential scanning
calorimeter (DSC).  In the cereal mash, the enzymes work at
high temps...they
just don't last very long there.  This is a concept that Del
Lansing (I think)
has been floating to the Digest recently.


The sweetness and improved fluidity of corn/rice mashes is
absolutely from the
breakdown of starches both via enzymic attack and
gelatinization.  No argument
here.  It's just that the breakdown comes from the gradual
gelatinization of
*some* of the starches in both your barley and adjunct. 
Most of the real
gelatinization comes when you boil the mash.  If you just
added the cereal mash
back to the main mash after the main mash is through with
the saccharification
rests, you'll get one dandy starch haze in the finished
product.  I should
know--this exact thing happened to me with my first CAP I
told you about a few
months back.  That's why you need to add back the cereal
mash during an amylase
rest.


To summarize, it's my opinion and experience that
"gelatinization" of starch
granules does not occur to a meaningful extent in dry
milling of rice or corn
kernels.  The granules are likely disrupted and this
disruption provides some
access to the starch chains for the amylases, but only in
the presence of
water.  The addition of barley in the cereal mash is to
promote a small amount
of enzymatic degradation to lower the overall viscosity of
the mash.  As the
boiling temperature is approached, more damaged granules
gelatinize and are
rapidly attacked by the enzymes at the same time the enzymes
are being
deactivated by the extreme heat.  Through this method,
complete gelatinization
(but not enzymic breakdown) of the starch via boiling can
occur without having
a nightmare viscosity on your hands.  It also avoids the
need to keep the
cereal mash boiling at all times to avoid retrogradation of
the non-digested
starch.


WHEW!  I don't know whether this makes me a librarian or
just plain boring.
I'll settle for boring since I've gone via experience, not
recitations.  Maybe

Barley beta-amylase does not require calcium as a cofactor.
Back in tha' day, I used quite a bit of purified BBA at
work, and the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) provided by
the supplier did not mention cofactors at all.  If you
search the Sigma catalog for BBA, you can get the
appropriate forms.

You and others have often written this but how would I see the ruinous
effects of iron?  My well water has around 1 ppm.  When I boil and decant
it prior to brewing pale lagers the precipitate is tan, leading me to
believe that it complexes somehow with the carbonates and other
precipitates and is removed (and years ago a brewer who also taught
chemistry at Grand Valley State U in MI suggested a mechanism for this to
me).  However, for my dark beers I brew with unboiled/decanted water and
they seem to turn out fine, although my dark Munich lagers do sometimes
suddenly oxidize in the keg and taste cardboardy.  Stouts, porters, bitters
and other ales brewed with unboiled water last forever.


Can you elaborate?

This latter would appear to be a momily in need of correction.  At MCAB
Steve Michalak of A/B said that they do everything they can to reduce Bud's
acetaldhyde to (I think) two or three ppb, less than any other beers, and
below taste threshold.  He was pretty difininte about this.  I may have the
energy to give a report on the pilot brewery tour we had and other aspects
of MCAB2 after I recover from the great weekend in St. Louis, or perhaps
someone else can.  (Give a report, not recover.  I'll take responsibility
for that myself).

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Wow! MCAB II has come and gone, and I have a HUGE respect for the St.
Louis Brews as a result! What a feat of organization and execution!!! THe
competition was well and professionally run (even with me as a judge...),
the technical presentations were well organized and interesting, the
location comfortable and easily accessed.... Quite an act to follow with
the 2000 AHA NHC, but I know the crew chasing that rabbit down are up to
the challenge!


My special thanks to Bob Boland, John Sullivan and the entirity of the St.
Louis Brews for making the event one which will set the hurdle for all
such events to come. Bravo!


It was also great putting faces to all of the email addresses - er, names!
- that come across the HBD every day. And meeting those whose writings
I've read in the home brewing press and literature over the years was
truly a hoot (even if Byron and I don't see eye-to-eye on the internet's
role in brewing:-). 


Look for pictures on the MCAB site as soon as they are processed (read:
as soon as I get off my dead butt and put them there...)


PS: For all those that thought I was simply a computer program written by
Karl Lutzen - Ha! You're right! Karl left the portable holographic matter
projector unattended, so I took it for a spin this weekend. (And you all
thought I was carrying a laptop. No! The laptop was carryin' ME!)

Subject: FWH /Diacetyl in Czech beers


Thanks for info on parti-gyle.


Thanks to Jim Busch for info on equipment.   I should add that the
brewery I spent a lot of time at had a closed grant.  On the other hand
and as an example,  Znojmo Hostan has the old traditional long copper
open grant with about 10 goose neck copper feeds from each of the drains
in lauter tun.  These are really beautiful.  I'll put a picture of this
on web page today.


My apologies for not having been more clear about FWH or lack of it in
original post as noted by Jeff Renner and Nathaniel  Lansing.


The first hops were added when the lauter was 1/2 to 2/3 done.  This was
same time the brewer cranked up the heat on kettle.  It took about 45
minutes to finish lauter during which time the  hops were in the wort
as its temperature was being raised from ~75C to boiling. The kettle
started to boil soon after the lauter was finished.  So the first hops
were in hot wort, not boiling, that was ramped from ~77 to 100C in about 45
minutes.


This isn't FWH as it was defined narrowly in that Brauwelt article of
several years back.  The narrow definition of FWH involves moving the last
addition of noble hops to the First Wort where they steep at ~76C for some
time and then are eventually raised to boiling.   additionally, this narrow
definition eliminates the last addition at about 20 minutes before end
of boil.  This addition remained at all czech breweries I visited.


I should also point out that most of the breweries I visited use 2 hour
boils and added this first addition after the boil began, ~30 minutes
into boil.


I didn't ask how many strains at PU so I really
can't answer Jeff Renner's question regarding three strains.


On my previous trip, none of the breweries krausened except for
"problem" beers and one stated problem was excessive diacetyl.  The brewer I
travelled with this time said that some breweries do indeed krausen as a
matter of routine although it is not common.


I detected diacetyl in one pilsner during my trip last summmer (can't
remember if it was Vyskov or Cerna Hora) and Michael noted it as well.


Diacetyl is not a major profile in fresh PU but I cannot overstate the
intensity of the hop flavor of fresh PU, at least 3 years ago.  When I was
back last summer, PU did not have as much hop flavor.


The following description of PU is in MJ's New World Guide "house
character of light fragrant spiciness can become overwhelmingly buttery
if the beer has lain around for too long"


Finally a comment on FWH.  The use of the term FWH is creating some
confusion because it has been too narrowly defined based on the Brauwelt
article.  I would like to see it used to mean simply adding hops to the
first wort.  One could also have middle wort or late wort hopping.  FWH
should not carry any implied meaning of omitting the last addition IMHO.


p.s.  I'm waiting to hear from the gentleman who did the yeast tests at
which time I'll follow up on that.

Subject: Eau de vie yeast


In my continuing effort to clone Samichlaus I've been
focusing on the yeast.  Several people have suggested yeast
and/or methodology which may permit the alcohol content to
approach 14%.  I've been toying with a Samichlaus culture,
but nothing definitive to date.


Saturday, while shopping at the local HB store, I picked up
some literature from Wyeast.  In their *wine* yeast pamphlet
they have an "Eau de Vie" yeast which they claim is (1)
tolerant up to 21% alcohol, and (2) suitable for
barleywines.  Has anyone tried this and/or know its
origins?  I'm willing to give it a whirl for my Sedamichlaus
clone if really is suitable for beer (as opposed to wine,
grappa, distilled spirits, etc.).  I don't know if it's a
distiller's yeast or not.  No attenuation or flocculation
characteristics are given.

Cancel that order! Not only for moral reasons (see noamazon.com

can probably order it for $35. Exploring the RSC website,
I discovered that their US distributor is Springer-Verlag:

Subject: Mr Beer 5 gallon kits


Hi all -


Bob Bratcher asks about Mr Beer distributers in Canada,
and Kim Thomson suggests he step up to a 5 gallon system.


Although I can't help Bob either, I would like to
point out (no affiliation, etc) that Mr Beer does make
(or DID make) an excellent 5 gallon system - that's
how I got started, 4-5 years ago.  Their big starter kit
includes the best plastic fermenter I've ever used - it was
6.5 gallons, clear Lexan, with a wide mouth.  Easy to clean,
easy to handle, and you could watch the beer brewing.  I
haven't seen the big kits in shops very often, and unless
it's on sale, it's a bit overpriced, but still a great
fermenter.  The only downside I saw was that the spigot
wasn't standard, and so not easily replaced.


I agree completely that the smaller kits are crap and should
be avoided.


regards,
Brian

Subject: FWH/hot break


Greetings -- 
A coupla questions.  First, on my last brewing
session, I brewed an IPA ~ 10 lbs pale malt, 1 lb
light crystal malt - I got a huge quantity of break
material.  The only thing I did different is that I
added a bit of gypsum to the mash and sparge water.  I
haven't been able to get a good report from my water
company here in Washington DC, so I'm experimenting
with water treatment (spare me the flames, I know it's
not the best way to go about things).  Is this the
possible cause of the break?  Can anyone offer a good
explanation for why?  My understanding is that a good
quantity of break is a good thing.  Is this correct?
or is it an indication that I overdid it on the
gypsum.  This batch is still fermenting.  It smells
great, but too early to catch any obvious flaws.


Also a question about first wort hopping -- My
(perhaps flawed) understanding is that the point of
FWH is to impart flavor and aroma by adding hops to
the kettle prior to the boil.  Everything I've read
about hops says that the delicate aromatic compounds
that provide hop aroma and flavor are driven off in
the boil.  If this is so, how can hops added before
the boil add flavor and aroma?  Help me out here.
Thanks

Subject: burners and kegs


Just wanted to pass on a bit of information...
    I recently bought a Brinkman general purpose propane cooker at Walmart
for $49.95. It's a ring-type burner that is advertised to put out 160,000
btu's.  I was delighted at how much more quickly I could bring liquid to
boil on it as opposed to my kitchen gas range.
However, since then I obtained a Sankey keg which I cut the top out of, and
found that the bottom lip of the keg fits right on the metal support ring of
the burner. Ideally, I would have liked the burner to either fit inside the
keg or outside. I'm a bit worried about this much boiling liquid perched so
precariously. I plan on some sort of modification to the burner to remedy
this.
     Anyone seeing this burner at Walmart and considering purchasing one
might want to keep this in mind if they brew with a converted keg.


     On the subject of my keg conversion, I searched the HBD archives for
keg modification, and saw a posting on using a Dremel tool with cut-off
wheels to cut out the keg top.  Since I have a Dremel I though I'd give it a
try.  I works, and give good results, but I REALLY went through the cutt-off
wheels!  I used a total of eight of the reinforced ones and about six of the
emery type for a cost of probably $12 or so.
Harborfreight (www.harborfreight.com) has a 4" disk grinder on sale for
$19.99. Before I make my new mash tun I think I'll buy one of these.
Thanks to everyone who answered my post about installing a non-welded
bulkhead in my new keg.  I'm really looking forward to getting out of the
kitchen.

Hello all,


I have a quick question.  I have a Belgian Dubbel and a strong Belgian 
specialty just about ready to bottle.  I was thinking that it might be nice 
to use champagne corks to bottle them in.  My question is, is this feasible 
and relatively easy to do.  I have never seen Champagne corks for sale, 
other than the plastic ones.
How does one go about using/buying Champagne corks.


In a related note how viable of an option are the plastic corks.  Though 
these just don't look the same.


Thanks in advance

Slightly beer related, 


Anyone know of a source for a Stainless Steel milk can? I can't seem to find

Houses though. ) 


I need one to make into the boiler for a reflux tower. (distillation is 
illegal, I know, it's just for show).


It must have a tight fitting lid. I will pay any reasonable amount, or will 
trade for 3 sacks of pale or lager malt.

I just returned from St. Louis where I had a fantastic weekend. To the St
Louis Brews: You guys really put on a great show. Anything so well
organized must have required a great deal of work, and you should be
commended for it.


Starting with the Pub-Crawl, thanks to the brewers on the bus who took us
into their brewpubs and provided the food, beer, and tours. The tour
guides and travel arrangements were first class.


The technical and the Q&A sessions on Saturday were excellent. The St.
Louis brewery history was quite interesting, as were the seminars on
high-gravity brewing and yeast propagation.


Again, hats off to the crew of the St. Louis Brews and everyone else who
brewed the Real Ales and the many other beers for the Happy Hour and the
awards dinner. With so many beers on tap, it would have taken hours just to
sample them all. The raffle was jam packed with great prizes, and we each
got to take home 10 lbs. of Moravian Pils (courtesy of St. Pats) and a bag
of Prime Tabs too. Now, if I could only make beer half as good as those I
sampled....


Finally, on Sunday, Steve Michalak and his employees gave us the tour of the
Anheuser-Busch Pilot Brewery. I've never heard such clear, concise, and
unequivocal answers on brewing before. This guy really knows his stuff.
He loves his job and it shows.


Sorry if this is beginning to sound like an Oscar award speech, but these
people, and anyone else I forgot to mention, deserve to be recognized.
This was truly an outstanding weekend.
