Brewers (and brewsters),


"Penn, John" <John.Penn`at`jhuapl.edu> takes Alan Meeker's comments and
combines them with a single irrelevant data point and comes to a completely
illogical conclusion. (Sorry to be so blunt, John, but them's the apples.)


Without knowing the composition of John's wort (sold as a health
supplement?) no conclusions whatsoever can be drawn about his yeast's
performance. None. Period. (Also, just because the gravity is over 1.000
doesn't mean that fermentable sugars remain.)


All you librarians out there: what does the literature say about variations
between COMMON strains of yeasts and their ability to process various
sugars? (Let's not discuss the weird yeasts at this point.) Most of the
variation that I've seen discussed on the hbd refers only to lager yeasts'
ability to ferment mannose (or perhaps another dextrin), which ale yeasts
are not able to process. This is NOT relevant to my original question which
referred only to ale yeasts, but probably doesn't make an appreciable
difference anyway.


Assuming you had identical wort composition, why would 1056 attenuate
differently from 1728? Simple question. Anyone have a answer that isn't just
a WAG?


(Okay, the literature will most likely focus on lager yeasts. Whatever--as
long as you lay out the data in an informative fashion--not just broad
edicts.)

Alex,


Here's a recipe I adapted from the Scotch Ales book in the brewing series.  
It's reported to be representative of beers from the 1860's.  I've made it a 
couple of times, but I haven't been able to get it to carbonate very well.  
Use a large starter (I grew up a yeast pack to 1 gallon, decanted & pitched; 
I also pitched on a yeast cake of a previous batch of lower gravity beer)

formation, dissolved carbon dioxide and moderate molecular weight proteins

striking contrast, foam stability is strongly enhanced by the presence of

Subject: Restarting stuck wine


Russ asked about restarting a stuck maple wine. The most sure way (not the
only way) of restarting
a stuck wine is:
  Get a package of Lalvin K1-V yeast. Rehydrate as normal in 1/2 cup water.
After 15 minutes add 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon of yeast
_energizer_the kind with vitamins and yeast hulls; it
should be brownish in color and smell of vitamins. When that mixture is
fermenting actively (15 min ?)
add 1/4 cup of the stuck wine. Do not aerate, and wait for the fermentation
to come back to Kraeusen.
Now add 1/2 the volume of the starter (you should have 3/4 cup now) of
stuck wine (you add 3/8 cup
stuck wine). Wait for that to come back to kraeusen, that can be a coupla
hours. Add 1/2 the starter
volume again in stuck wine (1 1/8 cup starter + 9/16 cup stuck wine). Wait
til this comes to kraeusen.
Continue increasing the starter volume by 1/2 its' volume in stuck wine,
each time waiting til active fermentation is evident. When you have 1/2
your batch as an active starter you can mix in the final
half of the stuck wine. This obviously will require a series of
increasingly larger vessels. The K1-V
yeast has a "Competitive factor" which helps it take over the fermention (
not a big deal, the other
yeast is shot) and is a neutral yeast which shouldn't taint the flavor of
the maple. An additional
teaspoon of yeast hulls halfway through the process will help the yeast
tolerate the alcohol that
is already present. The alcohol is why the repeated steps, slowly allowing
the yeast to adapt to the
high alcohol already in the wine. Just adding a fresh yeast will not
produce rapid results, it will be stunned
by the alcohol. Be patient through the process it will work. 


  Best of luck,
                     N.P.(Del) Lansing

Subject: NA beer procedure


I lost track of who asked about boiling off alcohol to produce NA beer.
I tried a method with some reasonable results. A local theater company
needed NA stout for
a play so the actor could drink 4 beers each play and not slur his lines,
it is a small venue and
the audience would have smelled rootbeer. The product was donated to stay
on the proper side
of the BATF.  Take a 4 lb can of hopped malt extract and dissolve that into
5 gallons 190 degree water.
This should pasturize it suitably for our purposes. Let stand 15 minutes
before running through
a counterflow chiller. Add yeast and bottle as if this was homemade
rootbeer. When proper carbonation
is reached refrigerate the whole batch. Simple enough. It doesn't make real
beer, but it comes out
better than commercial NAs. A kit with an assertive hopping rate will help
counter the inevitable residual
sugar.


Be lucky,
            N.P.(Del) Lansing

Subject: Hops in my primary


Hello all,


I'm new to this whole home brewing world - I have only completed one 5 gal 
batch so far, and I started my second last night.  The first batch (an All 
Malt Amber) turned out nicely (much to my surprise).  The new one I just 
started is an American Pale Ale.


My question is about hops in the primary.


First some information - on my first batch I placed my hops in a hop bag and 
as a result it came out nicely at the end of the boil.  With this last batch 
I didn't use a hops bag.  I added 1 1/2 oz bittering hops and boiled 55 min, 
then added the finishing hops (another 1 1/2 oz) for the last 5 min.


When I went to pour the wort into the primary through a funnel (with a 
screen) it clogged the screen almost immediately, rendering my funnel 
useless.  In a mild panic, I tried to clean the hops off the screen with my 
brewing spoon.  No luck - still clogged.  So, I just dumped the wort into 
the primary and went on with the process.  Taking Mr. Papizans advice I had 
a homebrew (yummmm...) and tried not to worry.


Right now my primary is fermenting away vigorusly, but there is/was a lot of 
suspended hops in the liquid.  Is this okay?  Will it affect the quality or 
flavor of the brew?  Is there anything I can do to fix this?


I'm hoping it will settle out and when I rack to my secondary I'll have nice 
clear beer.  What are the chances of that?


Sorry to bother you with beginner questions.  But, thanks for any advice you 
can share.  Private e-mail is great if this is not worth putting on the 
list.


Thanks,
Charlie Sprigg

I've tried three different methods with barleywine.  


Method 1: Prime with dextrose only (O.G. unk. no doubt over 1.000)
Method 2: No priming (O.G. 1.120)
Method 3: Prime with fresh yeast and dextrose (O.G. 1.100)


Results:
Method 1: Worked great
Method 2: Flat as anything
Method 3: Worked great


Sorry I don't have more details, but I don't have access to my records
right now.


Source for bottles:


The 8 oz. Coke bottles work great.  Since they are only very lightly tinted
green, keep 'em in a cardboard box to avoid the brew becoming light struck.
 These bottles seem to be popular with the office crowd, at least around
here in the Atl area.


Hope this helps,

I don't filter and haven't found this to be at all necessary.  I often keg
beer right out of the primary that's still slightly fermenting.  That gives
natural carbonation (I may have to vent excess or add some via the CO2 tank
depending on how well I guessed at the remaining extract).  Even with the
sediment from racking still fermenting beer, after the first glass or two,
I get perfectly clear beer until the keg blows.  If I'm going to be
transporting the keg I'll rack it off the sediment to another.


Here's a racking trick I just picked up from watching Mike O'Brien of
pico-Brewing Systems.  Mike puts an ordinary plastic picnic tap in line as
a valve.  He just shoves the plastic line on the spout (I've done this with
a short hose for quick n dirty bottling) and uses the tap as a valve.  You
can flip it backwards to make it stay on, of course.  No more folding hoses
or playing with those little plastic hose clamps.

If you haven't had any trouble for 5 years, it seems to be working.


Personally, I soak.  If your container is sealable like a keg or
a carboy, you only need to fill the container somewhat more than 1/2
way.  Let it soak right-side up, then turn it upside-down.  


You can also use the same solution to sanitize the carboy as you do to 
sanitize your brewing gear during a session.  Sanitize the carboy,
empty the carboy into a bucket, seal the carboy, and use the solution
in the bucket to sanitize your gear during the brewing session.

Wet is all you need.  Big dairy tanks are sanitized with a few gallons that
are sprayed.  That's why they have wetting and foaming agents.  25 ppm `at`
one minute should do the trick, or 12.5 ppm `at` ten minutes, according to p.
9 of the new Williams catalog (where they sell test strips).  I paid
~$10/gallon for dairy tank sanitizer bottle  - that's really cheap!

Subject: Mash Hops




Jeff Renner posts Hubert Hanghofer citing Ludwig Narziss


to state that FWH works because the hop oils are oxidized into soluble
forms without the guarding vapor blanket and vapor stripping.


Can we assume from this that when adding hops to the mash we don't actually
get any stabilization until the sparge stage when the already extracted hop
oils are  exposed to oxygen in the kettle.


Is the standard stiring of the mash enough to oxidize the hop oils?


A more practical question for those with mash hopping experience: Are any
hop oils left behind in the grain bed absorbed by husks, grain etc. when
mash hopping so that the efficiency is lower and should be compensated for?


Thanks
Dana


PS: Does this mean that we have found a benefit from HSA (hop oil
stabilization) that can extend the wars even longer!

Jill for pointing this out.

Yep, I do that a lot.  It's a bit hard to mix, though.  I dough-in at 105F
for 20 minutes or so and then infuse to 150-160F, skipping the protein
rest, usually ending up with 1.75 to 2.25 quarts per lb., more or less.
And of course, relax and don't worry (see the above comments); hell, it's
just beer, after all. :)

Subject: Week long diacytl rest, Fining with Ising Glass (procedure)


I brewed my yearly dopple bock almost 3 weeks ago now. OG 1.085, Wyeast 2308,
2
litre starter (active when pitched). Primary for 14 days at 50-52F, got down
to 1 glub every 30 seconds so I pulled it out of the fermentation chiller and
brought up to 68F. Came up to 1 glub every 12 seconds and stayed there for 5
days. Now down to 1 glub per minute.


I think that was a bit more than a diacytl rest. Don't think it'll do much
harm though. When I pulled it out of the chiller it stank like sulfur. Smell
is gone now and it looks much better now that the yeast has mostly come out
of suspension.


I stopped by the HB shop today and picked up some Vienna malt to use this
left over 2308 to make a vienna. I picked up some ising glass finings to
try out (never used the stuff before).The instructions say to add it to a
little beer then mix it in to the main batch, but don't talk about sanitizing
it. I normally boil water, take it off heat and add gelatin, mix it up real
good, cool it down and then add to secondary. Can I do this with Ising Glass
too or is there some reason it can't be cooked?

Subject: Secondary Fermentation


Ok all you hard core all grain brewers, give the new guy a break and
tell me about secondary fermentation.  I am brewing extract kit ales in
a primary for about 7 days.  How long do I rack these brews to a
secondary?  I'm just looking for some guidelines and general advice. 
You posts are entertaining and valuable , but a little over my head
(currently). thanks for the advice.
