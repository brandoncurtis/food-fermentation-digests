        There is a more prestigious event than the MCAB??? Damn, wait till I get my
calendar out....
        But, seriously.....!!


        Dr. Cone was interested in your event, however, as he is to be climbing Mt.
Everest, with 6 swimsuit models, in an attempt to brew the highest batch,
and break the North American continental record, he was obviously going to
be unavailable for the GCHC.
        He does, in fact, bemoan the fact that Chris White is going to be at your
event, however...'cos he does trust the good Dr. White explicitly, much more
than the models, who have a hard time balancing on high heels while carrying
the malt, water and hops necessary uphill for the brew, much less trust them
with the yeast! And the photographers for Sport's Illustrated and National
Geographic seem to be less trustworthy than the models, as they profess no
knowledge of anything other than ZIMA! At least the sports-models drink
Victory and 3 Floyd's!


        So Dr. Cone is extremely upset that Dr. White won't be around to help
him.....


        Maybe next year, Dr. White might be available to Dr. Cone to supervise the
staff? Then he might be assured of the record....And Dr. White might have
some ability to influence Bill Clinton and Tony Blair from hassling Clayton
to join the climb...........(Some guys just can't take NO!)

        They involve other manufacturers products...and while I know those products
to be of the highest standard, your question should be answered by folks
that know them best.


        OTOH, my experiences with dried extracts lie firmly in the MF and
Laaglander camps....both fine products, I recommend them...only thing to
note is that the Laaglander will always finish higher than the MF......more
unfermentables involved....which is useful knowledge to extract
brewers...trying to tweak out the difference between a dry finish and a
bigger bodied beer.

From: "Dr. Pivo" <dp`at`pivo.w.se>
Subject: peracetic acid


Nathan Kanous contributed a very nice link about using vinegar and
peroxide in turn as decontaminants.


At one point in contact (but not exactly those concentrations) this will
become peracteic acid, which is a fine cleaner in itself.


I have used this as well, but have stopped for the following reason:


My most sensitive lab equipment as a homebrewer are my eyes (and they're
pretty shot), and my pallate and nose (which remain surprisingly adroit).


If I have a problem in development, I want to know about it and head it
off.  If previous spills or old kegs in the cellar begin emitting the
smell of "vinegar", I know I most likely have an acetobacter or other
nasty focus of infection, that will require a "more thorough" cleaning
to see that it doesn't spread.  This is a particularly good one to get
rid of, since it loves low pH places to grow, and the low pH of your
beer, is one of the things that keep "just anything" from growing there
(and the reason that German Shepards can sometimes lap from the surface
with impunity).


I've found using peracetic acid totally masks my ability to smell any
other vinegary smells, and send a paranoia ripple down my spine... I had
a simliar infection in about 1983-84 whose source I finally located in a
counter flow chiller, and that "salad dressing" smell still awakens
grave feelings of dissapointment.


 ... but the stuff does work!

Subject: Questions about Decoction


I have some detailed questions about decoction mashing.  I want to brew a
German wheat beer.  I have pulled a typical mash schedule (3.5 Lb. Munich
dark, 5.3 Lb.. wheat)
from Classic Beer Styles #7, German Wheat Beer.  I included the whole
schedule so that the full context is presented.  My questions are at the


A) Mash 3 1/8 gallons water at 104 F and hold for 5 minutes.


B) Heat to 122F in 10 minutes and hold for 25 minutes.


C) Pull off the thickest 30 to 40 percent of the mash and heat in 15
minutes to 160F.


D) Allow to saccharify for 10 to 15 minutes then heat in 15 minutes to
boiling.


E) Hold the boil for 20 minutes then add the decoction to the main mash
over 10 minutes, raising the temperature of the whole mash to 145F.


F) Hold for 10 minutes then pull the second thick decoction which should
amount to 1/3 of the total mash.


G) Raise the temperature in 5 minutes to 160F, hold for 10 minutes, then
heat in 15 minutes to boiling.


H) Boil for 20 minutes then remix the two mashes, raising the temperature
of the whole to 147F.


I) Allow to saccharify for 15 minutes or until the iodine test is negative.


J) Heat to 169F, hold for five to 10 minutes and then transfer to the
lauter tun.


My questions are:


1) Step C says "pull off the thickest 30 to 40 percent of the mash".  What
does that mean?  Thirty to 40 percent of the total volume (grain + liquid)?


What exactly should I do at this step and what is the procedure?


2) Step D. I assume an iodine test is done here, right?


3) Step E.  What is the significance of "over 10 minutes".   I would assume
the temperature of 145F is the most important factor. If so, wouldn't it be
better to just add the decoction and then adjust the temperature with cold
water or heat?


4) Step F.  Again, what is pulled, how much, and how?


5) Step H.  I assume the answer to (3) holds here also.


Either posted replies or direct emails are fine. I'll consolidated the
results if necessary.

All this talk of hydrogen peroxide makes me, the chemistry impaired, wonder
why we don't add it to our  cooled wort to oxygenate it? Instead of topping
off with water to make up boil losses and adjust to correct gravity (as I
normally end up doing) why not add hydrogen peroxide?

howdy,


i got this email from my brother (a friend of one of the brewers).
it's not super informative but at least gives you a place to start.

=========


Most of the beer info is stuff Mac likes to keep as proprietary
information. I will say that we use Cascade and Mt. Hood Hops. It has
some residual sweetness therefore a higher terminal gravity. African
Amber is 5.9% A.B.V. It is unfiltered and dry hopped. Dry Hopping (or
addition of hops after the beer is finished) is a very important
component of the flavor profile. Our yeast strain is our own of
course, but an English Ale style should work well. It should be good
at ester production and should not be a super-attenuator. Good luck.

Subject: brewing mistakes...


howdy folks,


here's good one for the books. unlike many of you i'm not reporting
something that turned out ok in the end. this is a perfect example of
why one should really follow the instructions when brewing!


i first brewed beer when i was a senior in university. i really don't
recall how it came out but i'm sure it was ok since i started brewing
again when i entered grad school in Salt Lake City, Utah.


my friend Brad and i pooled our minimal resources and bought the
requisite equipment to brew from extracts. after one successful batch
we decided to try a recipe for a porter that called for some grains
(no mashing). well, we picked up some chocolate and black patent and
added them to the pot with the extract. we then proceeded to boil this
mixture for an hour. 


if you could drink wood you would understand how this beer tasted. it
was one of the most foul beverages i've ever had and no amount of time
improved its flavor.


it broke my heart and was a pain in the ass to pour out 50 bottles of
this crap into the bath tub.

Subject: May is Mild Month


Brewers


May is Mild Month - so says CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale.  Mild is an
easy drinking ale, most often dark, almost always low in gravity, low in
bitterness, and is a natural here in the US before the weather gets so warm
you want a lager.


Here is my most recent iteration:


Armstrong's Dark Mild


7.75 US gallons in the keg (8+ gallons in the primary fermenter)
OG 1.037, FG 1.010


8.5 lbs. Briess Ashburne malt*
1 lb. Durst 90L crystal
3 oz. Scotmalt chocolate
12 oz. Briess flaked maize


1.2 oz. very fresh whole EKG `at` 6.2% alpha - 60 minutes
0.6 oz. ditto - 15 minutes


Huge repitch of Wyeast 1098 (Whitbread) (not my first choice but it was
what was available)


Untreated fairly high carbonate well water (alkalinity balanced by dark malts)


Started mash at 153F, dropped to 149 at 60 minutes, raised to 160F for 20
minutes, then mashed out at 170F.  Sparged with boiled and decanted well
water (for low alkalinity).  Collected ~7.5 gallons wort, topped with ~ 2
gallons sparge water before boil.


Fermented upper 60's to 70F, "dropped" the fermenting beer at 18 hours into
another fermenter with a fair amount of splashing to oxygenate the yeast,
then moved to 60F after 2-1/2 days as fermentation slowed.  Ready to keg at
five days.


Light bodied, chocolatey, fruity, slightly roasty, mildly bitter.  Quite
nice, if I do say so myself.  Can't wait for my hand pump to arrive.


*  I think Ashburne is a real key in creating the flavor I was after.  It
is a slightly darker version of pale ale.  See http:www.briess.com for
details.


For an even lighter bodied mild, substitute 12 oz. of sugar for one pound
of malt.


If anyone brews this, report back on HBD.

Subject: Bleach


I should know better than to get into a pissin' match about 
momilies, but here goes...First i guess we need to define 
terms.  My understanding of a momily is a saying which 
"Mom" or someone else told you but experience shows 
to be false or insignificant.  Something handed down from
Mom to Mom so long it's accepted as fact without 
experimental or experiential support.  


An example is "if you do that you'll go blind" when you 
already had been doing it for years and didn't even need 
glasses yet.  If i'm misunderstanding what a momily is, i 
guess i need to concede the match now.

"Grant W. Knechtel <GWK`at`hartcrowser.com>
     Subject: Bleach vs. Stainless - Momily?
     .....
     IMHO this doesn't qualify as a momily.  Household bleach will indeed 
     pit stainless.  I have seen stainless completely corroded through, 
     albeit at long contact times and high concentrations."
     
     Isn't THIS EXACTLY what a momily is?  I mean sure someone you know 
     told you about the chemistry, and you saw something that happened 
     after "long contact times and high concentrations".
     
     I just want everyone to know I have used bleach for years, have been 
     kegging for a couple of years and I use bleach to sanitize my kegs, 
     1/4 cup in 5 gallons water, invert the keg, bleed out the air in the 
     gas and liquid tubes.  Leave for up to two or three days, rinse, no 
     problems.  
     
     Sure there are better products, I should probably get some, but 
     homebrewers should know that they can use bleach safely on SS.


 -snip-


As i understand it, no, it is not EXACTLY what a momily is.  I 
personally observed stainless corroded by bleach.  
So this can and does happen in my personal experience, 
not what i have heard.  The reason *why* it occurs is what i 
reported from other's knowledge, but *why* is not relevant to 
whether it is a momily.


I concede, and did mention in the remainder of my original 
post this may not be a problem at the concentrations and 
contact times commonly used by homebrewers.  There is enough 
doubt in my mind that I won't take the risk on a regular basis.  
Iodophor is too cheap and easy to use though not as much so as 
bleach.  


I propose the following as momilies:


1.  Your beer will be ruined so you might as well throw it out now.


No, in many cases good beer will result despite our best efforts to 
screw it up.


2.  It's the water.


No, good beer can be made from most any potable water.


3.  The best beer can only be made with liquid yeast.


No, but there are some styles for which only liquid cultures are 
currently available.


4. Oxygenating your wort is absolutely needed.
5. Oxygenating your wort is absolutely a waste of time.


6. HSA is a scourge to homebrewers.
7. HSA is nothing to worry about.


Just love those conflicting momilies....


There are doubtless others at least as pernicious.  Prost!

across an old lamp. Secretly hoping that a Genie would appear, he rubbed
the lamp vigorously.  


To the amazement of the castaways, one did come forth.  


This particular Genie, however, stated that she could only deliver one
wish, not the standard three.  


Without giving much thought to the matter the man blurted out, "Make the
entire ocean into beer!"


Immediately the Genie clapped her hands with a deafening crash, and the
entire sea turned into the finest brew ever sampled by mortals.
Simultaneously, the Genie vanished to her freedom. 


Only the gentle lapping of beer on the hull broke the stillness as the
two
men considered their circumstances. The other man looked disgustedly at
the one whose wish had been granted.  After a long, tension-filled
moment,
he spoke: "Nice going!   Now we're going to have to pee in the boat."
