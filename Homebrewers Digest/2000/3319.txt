And just think, I was just thinking about brewing a mild! Actually, I had
intended to brew a Dunkel, but I wasted too much time and it got too warm
outside. Then I was going to brew an Alt, but I wasted too much time and it got
too warm outside. So NOW I was thinking about using said ingredients to make a
Mild. Here's what my thoughts were (five gallon batch):


6.5# Weyermann Dark Munich
 .5# Briess 80L Crystal
2 oz Black Patent


The hopping schedule would be similar to the one you proposed. I'd probably use
whatever Danstar yeast I happen to have handy (Windsor?). I realize that Munich
malt is not typical for the style, but it would give a nice maltiness to an
otherwise "light" beer.


FWIW, last year I brewed AlK's Mild recipe in his Homebrewing, Vol. I. It
turned out very nicely.


Thoughts?

Subject: MCAB II recipe donation/request


Greetings all.  Things seem a little slow around the HBD lately and I
thought I might try to carry on the tradition that someone else started last
year of posting MCAB-winning recipes .  I greatly enjoyed looking at last
year's offerings.  My recipe is a California Common/Steam beer that finished
first in its category.  FWIW, here goes:


California Common #3


Brewed on:  11/21/99
Batch size:      6.5 gal.
OG:            1.057
FG:            1.016
Efficiency:       59 %
IBU:              41


Grain bill:


Crystal 40                        0.75 lbs.
Crystal 77                        1.25 lbs.
Belgian Munich                    4.50 lbs.
American Two-Row                 10.00 lbs.
Belgian Munich (toasted)          6.00 oz.


Hops:


Hallertau Northern Brewer          9.4 %    1.00 oz.      65 min.
Hallertau Northern Brewer          9.4 %    0.50 oz.      30 min.
Northern Brewer                    5.0 %    0.20 oz.      10 min.
Hallertau Northern Brewer          9.4 %    0.30 oz.      10 min.
Northern Brewer                    5.0 %    0.50 oz.       2 min.
Northern Brewer                    5.0 %    0.50 oz.       0 min.
Cascade                            7.8 %    0.70 oz.       dry


Yeast:


Wyeast  2112     (2.5 qt. starter)


Mash Specifics:


1.)  Infused 5.75 gal. water at 168F for a 75 min. rest at 154F.
2.)  Infused 2.75 gal. water at 200F for a 10 min. rest at 165F.


Boil time: 90 min.




Pitched yeast on 11/21/99 at 62F
11/21/99 - temp. set to 60F
Racked on 12/9/99 to steel keg - temp. set to 32F


This was a no sparge batch, hence the low efficiency.  I think that this
beer tastes a lot like Anchor Steam except for having a bit more hop flavor
and aroma.  It definitely has that earthy/grassy Northern Brewer bite.  BTW,
I was using up the last of my Hallertau Northern Brewer hops and opened up a
new bag of domestic Northern Brewer for this batch.  Next time I might stick
with the Hallertau version since it is a little milder.


The judges had no big beef with the beer.  One thought it was a little thin
and another thought the balance was a bit too far towards hops.


Okay there's my offering.   Now I want to see some of the other recipes -
please post!


Cheers,
Dean Fikar

Subject: a 'spurment


I wasn't out to do a 'spurment......
I was trying to see if redhook's IPA yeast was viable.....trying to "capture"
it. So I added about 9oz of "sterile", aerated by shaking, wort to the
sediment of a redhook IPA bottle.  I shook it up, attached an airlock and let
it alone.....for two and a half months! I forgot that it was atop a high
bookshelf! I tasted it today.....It's thesame sterile, bitter, UNFERMENTED
wort that I added all that time ago!  Hooray! My starters really are clean! My
practices sound! Two and a haf mos. and not even wild yeast or bacterial
fermentation! There's proof enough for me!  To the dismay of many, the delight
of others, hell, some wont give a crap! I use Charlie Papazian's recipe and
procedure for propagation. This is in his CJOHB book. HEY, It's good to have
proof that one's practice is sanitary. And as an added bonus, don't bother to
try to get redhook IPA yeast, they must pasteurize.  Any science types, please
comment as you wish, I'll read with much interest.


Can I claim a  "Dr. Pivo" designation now that I've done a "spurment"?

Subject: Back From The Boondocks


After confessing to my stupidity a week ago, I have been in hiding and
denial over the whole matter ever since. But I am feeling a bit better now.
I thought Dave Lamotte's story was something special but Doc Pivo's rolling
60 litres of beer down the staircase helped to convince me I have yet to
achieve greater heights of stupidity.


But I don't like the idea of the Doc conferring with Jill on how to get
those stains out of my underwear. Is there something going on here that I
don't know about? And just what is Wes Smith doing hanging about in my
billiard room whilst I am away on flying trips!! You just can't trust your
mates these days, not even the peroxided ones. And especially not New
Zealanders!


To be truthful about my absence for the past week, I took Jill and Phoebe
out into the boondocks of NSW and Queensland to catch up with family and
check out the beer drinking scene in outback Australia. I borrowed a Cessna
aeroplane and away we went.


I can tell you this much, out bush in Australia, the drinking habits have
changed by nought. Tooheys, Fosters, V.B. and XXXX are still held in high
regard. If these brands are foreign to all you non Aussies, never mind, I'm
sure Dave Burley will enlighten you. Just as he is going to enlighten me on
the aboriginal meaning of Burrabadoo. He might also like to tackle Boggabri
and Boggabilla. Maybe even Coonabarabran and Girragulang. Whilst Dave is
having a think about this, let me tell you, from a brewers point of view,
all these places are the same.


There was once a time when I swilled beer in the outback with the best of
them. And I still can, but what is on tap tastes so bloody ordinary! I have
to conclude I have been ruined by home brewing. And so has Jill. We were
glad to finally get home tonight and hoof into the rice lager.


Phoebe was glad to get out of the aeroplane. Where she once said "Daddy, you
are a big turd"
She now concludes:
"Flying in these little things scares the crap out of me!!!"
This from a four year old???
I rest my case on the demise of the modern world.


If you are yet to visit towns such as Eumungerie or Wongabinda, then I
suggest you make haste out here to Oz and see what is left of "the last
frontier".


The beer won't do a lot for you but when you get to the Southern Highlands,
hopefully Wes and I (not to mention all the others) can offer you something
worth drinking. BTW, don't let Doc Pivo convince you that here in the
Southern Highlands we are only 80 metres above sea level. Rob Moline made
the following comments :
>Dr. Cone was interested in your event, however, as he is to be >climbing
Mt.
>Everest, with 6 swimsuit models, in an attempt to brew the >highest batch.


Rob was referring to Dr Cone's intended visit to the Burradoo Billiard Room,
though I have stressed to Rob, we just can't fit any more women in here,
swimsuits or not. We might have to tie them to the Boab tree.


On a final note, I'd like to express my sincere condolences to the family
and friends of Bill Pfeiffer. I know Rob speaks with great compassion and
sadness on advising us of Bill's passing and I also know Pat Babcock will
greatly feel the loss. The sincerity of both Rob and Pat does not go
unnoticed.


Cheers
Phil

Subject: Hello from Czeck republic


Oops,sorry I have not previously mentioned my current
vacation to Germany, Czeck Republic, & Austria.


Yep, here I am on Sunday May 7 in Cesky Krumlov, then,
soon on to Viena.


Report:
  * Yeow - this is the place to be Cesky Krumlov,
south of Prague, south of Ceske Budejovice.  Cesky
Krumlov must be one of the most beautiful places on
earth.  Really, today it is 70f and sunny with a nice
breeze & breathtaking sights everywhere one looks.


As of this moment, after tasting beers in Germany, I
can tell you that Czeck beer blows away everything. 
My favorite, Samson 12(plato) lager.  Forget Budweiser
Budvar, as good as it is, Sampson tops it.


What a name: Sampson, but have no doubt, it is
Budejovike Pivo for sure.


The food has been fantastic in both Germany and Czeck.
I believe there must be a quantum leap worldwide in
restaurant quality.  Have no fear, menus are easily
read, most in several languages including English. 
Because of exchange rates 1US dollar is worth 40
Kronas which means the best beer in the world can be
had for 15 kronas (38 cents US) for 0,5 liter at
Pilsner Urquell in Pilzen.


When I return home in a couple weeks, I hope to have
more to report and will be willing to answer questions
and give suggestions about traveling in Europe.  It
has been a learning experience for sure, but briefly,
HAVE NO FEAR!


Till next time Na zdravi "to your health"
