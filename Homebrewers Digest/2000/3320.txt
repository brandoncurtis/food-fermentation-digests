One thing that Ron apparently hasn't found yet is the truly eye opening
experience that I had while driving through the Czech Republic.


We left Prague about 9AM heading for Dresden, and at 10:00 were stopped
at a roadblock for a breathalyzer test.


The trooper spoke neither English, French nor German, but did smile when
he saw the American passports.  The unit had instructions in English
which worked out well as I've never taken one of these before.

Subject: Re: Questions about Decoction




In a recent HBD the questions came up:
1) Step C says "pull off the thickest 30 to 40 percent of the mash".  What
does that mean?  Thirty to 40 percent of the total volume (grain +
liquid)?


What exactly should I do at this step and what is the procedure?


2) Step D. I assume an iodine test is done here, right?


3) Step E.  What is the significance of "over 10 minutes".   I would
assume
the temperature of 145F is the most important factor. If so, wouldn't it
be
better to just add the decoction and then adjust the temperature with cold
water or heat?  


1) The thickest part refers to getting as much grain as possible, and
leaving behind as much liquid as possible.  The enzymes for conversion
will survive if left behind in the liquid.


2) you can do an iodine test on the decocted portion here.


3)  the reason for 10+ minutes is that one benefit of decoction mashing is
that the husk is ruptured over time. allowing for easier access to the
starches for conversion.  Just be sure to watch the pot so that you don't
scorch the grains while doing this.


Hope this helps.


Chris

Subject: no carbonation and air shipment


Greetings fellow brewers:


Before I begin, thanks to everyone who has sent replies regarding my last 2
posts.  Sorry I haven't replied to each individually (I will) but with the
virus and all, it has been difficult.  All of your comments are so
appreciated.  I kind of feel bad that I am in the beginning stages of
learning to brew well, so I have far more questions than answers.  This is
really a great discussion list.


Now to the questions:
#1 simple: Is there any problem with shipping bottled beer by air (either
within the US or overseas) for fear of bottle explosion or just for legality
sake?


#2 I just finished making a nut brown ale with a can of Munton's and 3 lbs
of DME, hops, and Wyeast liquid.  Primary fermenter for a week then
secondary for a couple to three weeks (I lost track, boooo). I had problems
with the rubber stopper staying put in the secondary.  After 3 weeks I
transferred the beer to my bottling bucket and added 3/4 cup of corn sugar
dissolved in some boiled water.  I bottled, and after a 6 days at 70F no
carbonation (no sediment at the bottom of each bottle either.  Am I keeping
it to cool for carbonation?  Did my yeast die due to stopper problems?  Have
I not waited long enough? I haven't had problems with carbonation in the
past, ever.  Do I need to wait longer, or should I try to add new yeast to
spark the carbonation process.  I guess in that case I would have to empty
all the bottles back into the bottling bucket to add the yeast.  Oh my.


Thanks for all the past and future help.

        There is a more prestigious event than the MCAB??? Damn, wait till I get 
my
calendar out....
        But, seriously.....!!


        Dr. Cone was interested in your event, however, as he is to be climbing 
Mt.
Everest, with 6 swimsuit models, in an attempt to brew the highest batch,
and break the North American continental record, he was obviously going to
be unavailable for the GCHC.
        He does, in fact, bemoan the fact that Chris White is going to be at your
event, however... [Snip}


Back to me:


It's great to hear that Dr. Cone will be taking some time off for 
recreational activities, however Dr. Cone was at LAST year's GCHC (1999). 
 I had the great pleasure of listening to Dr. Cone speak at the 1999 GCHC 
and was very fortunate to have Dr. Cone sitting at the same table at lunch. 
 Not only does Dr. Cone know his yeast, but he is a very personal and nice 
all around guy!  I'm looking forward to listening to Dr. White this year! 
 Hey, maybe the GCHC really is better than MCAB! 8^)

Subject: re: Water Numbers for Philadelphia?


Bill:


I am afraid you'll have to get more specific than "Philadelphia area".  The
city itself probably has dozens of surface water supplies and even more
ground-water supplies and they all get treated differently.  Do you mean
just the city or the suburbs?  I know Philadelphia Suburban Water Company
serves most of the suburbs for at least a 25-30 mile radius.  I know we have
worked for PSWC for decades and they have many water sources too.  If you
give me a certain area I could see if we have water quality data for that
town, city or whatever.  What kind of water chemistry are you looking for?
Give me some details and I'll see what I can do.

I have access to an oxygen tank and an aeration stone.  How much aeration is

experienced homebrewers anywhere!


Winners will be announced at approximately 5:00 PM the day of the
competition. Ribbons will be awarded for first, second, and third place in
each category. The winner of Best of Show will receive a gift certificate or
other prize appropriate to the occasion. Judges reserve the right to not

Brewsters:


Ahhhh. Tooheys Old, V.B., XXXX,  these do bring back memories of the
Boulder Block Bar and the like in the mining towns of western Australia
outback. My favorite view of a Sheila ( is that P.C. , Phil?) was when the
barmaids wore tops made from one inch guage fishnetting. I never visited
those little 4'X6'shanties with a bed and room to get your pants off, 
behind the main street. But, in the interest of marketing, did drive by to
check out the type of advertisement the girls were using.


On one occasion, I was travelling with a fellow of short stature and we
went into one of these often green painted bars reminiscent of Crocodile
Dundee's Local and I think to which PhilY is referring to as unchanging . 
The urinals ( they were urinals, I hope) were much higher off the floor
than we position them in the US. When he complained of his inability to
reach the bowl easily, I told him that was the Australians' way of keeping
you on your toes. It also explained the wet floor.


I am sorry, PhilY,  but you will have to ask an Austronesian linguist or
one of your local Aboriginals, as I hesitate to print the definition of
Burrabadoo here.  


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: SUM: Bad Starters.


Thanks for all the posts.  As I suspected, I believe my starter wort was too
hot.  Here's a summary of the comments of both the Starter, and the
difference in 1056 and 1272 American Ale Yeast


Starter Comments:


I think that temperature was the root of your problem.  I cool mine
starter wort in an ice bath until the temp. drops to 75degrees F.  The
gravity of the starter wort is forgiving although I've noticed that the
experts recommend going lighter than you would expect.  Some recommend
using 1/4 cup of DME to 1 pint (approx 500ml) of water.


I don't know what 2 oz is equivalent to, but most people use 5-6 tablespoons
of dried malt extract (~1/3 cup) in 2 cups of water for a starter wort.
Yours sounds a little weak. Maybe that's why your starters aren't taking off
like gangbusters. Also, make sure not to add the yeast to hot, or even warm,
wort.


The only DME I have found which produces a healthy starter from any yeast
source (smack pack, White Labs, previous batches) is Munton & Fison.  I have
not tried Breiss, but Laaglander is bad.  Also, after the local brew shop
burnt down I went to a couple others and got 'American' and 'English' which
both produced poor quality starters.  With these extracts my starters showed
pressure in the air lock and only bubbles if you shok the container.


I would also watch your pitching temp and SG.  Shoot for no higher than 75F
and 1.050, IMHO.


Yeast Comments:


Both seem to have the same fermentation temperatures, but one
difference that I see is that the 1056 is a wee bit more
attenuative


No comparison between the two. The 1056 is a softer, smoother yeast,
only slightly less flocculant than the 1272. I've used 1272 three times
now, and each time found 1272 to impart a very unpleasant flavor, sort
of a winey/sherry-like flavor that I don't want in a beer.

Reverse RIMS...Yippee!...Part I


Hi all,


First a question. What do I call that thing that I am using to 
draw the liquid off the top of my mash tun in the reverse 
mode? A False Top????


Perhaps I am in the minority, but from the start I have had 
problems getting a high enough recirculation flow rate out 
of my converted-keg RIMS. I generally mash around 20 lb. 
of grain in mash tun that was once a sanke keg. 


I am not the first to try the reverse RIMS idea, but since 
there are few reports on this type of system here is mine for 
your reading enjoyment. 


For those not familiar with the concept, reverse RIMS, during 
the mash takes liquid off the top of the mash tun and returns 
it to the bottom. Flow through the grain bed is from bottom to
top, counter to the normal rims flow of top to bottom.


My system is a single-tier, steam-injected RIMS. It is 
manually controlled, not automated. My problem was that 
if I opened the valve in the recirculation loop to get a high 
flow rate, the grain bed choked and I never was able to get 
adequate flow. Consequently, I could only input a limited 
amount of heat due to the low recirculation rate, and 
therefore it took forever to boost temperatures. My only 
option was to continuously stir the mash during 
temperature boosts, trying to prevent the filter bed from 
setting and restricting flow. This was something I did not 
want to do. I went with the RIMS idea in the first place TO 
AVOID stirring! 


The mash tun has a false bottom, with an H-shaped 
manifold under it, and with the in/out point out the center of 
the bottom of the keg. The false bottom is the standard 1/8-
inch holes on 1/4-inch centers [or 5/16?] or something 
close to that. The false bottom is held to the manifold under 
it with a stainless bolt so it absolutely will not move away 
from the bottom. During operation in the normal rims mode 
very little in the way of grains find there way under the 
false bottom and manifold blockage has never been the 
problem which limited my recirculation rate.


The modified system as it sits now in its RevRIMS form, 
adds a second outlet to the side of the mash tun and couple 
extra valves that allow change of direction of the 
recirculation flow. 


In the reverse mode, the flow is drawn off the top of the 
tun, via a salvaged stainless steel basket strainer [more on 
this later]. This is piped through a valve to the pump, and 
from the pump through my heating chamber. After exiting 
the heating chamber flow then goes down through a valve 
to the fitting in the keg bottom. The liquid comes into the 
keg bottom and is split four ways by the manifold and rises 
up through the false bottom, which keeps the grain/husks 
somewhat in suspension.


One thing that hindered me from getting this system up and 
running sooner was how to deal with the drawing of the mash 
liquid from the top of the mash tun to the pump. Whatever 
is used for this purpose must be moved out of the way so 
that the grains can be added to the mash tun and then put 
back in place afterwards. Additionally, the outlet from the 
tun should be below the liquid level of the mash so that the 
pump will be gravity primed. And the height with respect 
to the bottom of the tun must be adjustable to accommodate 
varying amounts of grains being mashed.


The solution was actually quite simple, although it took a 
while to come about. I brought the new connection through 
the keg wall a couple inches above the false bottom and on 
the inside terminated half-inch copper tubing with a copper 
union. This allows me to connect L-shaped half-inch 
copper pieces that turn upward at the center of the keg. 
Additional pieces can be made so the open end of the 
tubing is at any elevation desired. Whatever device is used 
as a "false top" can be slipped over the end of this tubing. 


But, HOW IS THIS DONE if the tubing end is submerged 
under the doughed-in grains? Since this was *THE* major 
stumbling block, I will describe a simple and workable 
solution which works well in my case.


The answer was a tubing-extension piece. This is simply 
another piece of copper tubing, with an insert soldered 
inside it so that the end that sticks out has the same outside 
diameter as the inside of the copper tubing. Very easy to 
make, but once you do you may start to regret using that 
low-end copper tubing to plumb your home! You will be 
surprised how THIN the wall of standard copper tubing for 
home use is.


Simply take a short piece of the same copper tubing, say a 
bit more than an inch long, and with tin snips cut it 
lengthwise. Then cut a bit off one side [of the cut you just 
made] so that the tubing can be squeezed with pliers to a 
smaller diameter. Remove enough so that the insert piece 
can be squeezed down small enough to slip inside the piece 
of tubing that will serve as the extension. Solder it in place 
and file off any solder or slightly out of round spots until 
this piece slides inside the open end of the L-shaped copper 
tubing in the mash tun. 


You now have an extension piece that is easily removable 
and can be used to guide the false top of your choice down 
and over the open end of the tubing that will feed the pump 
in the reverse mode.  The false top just has to have a hole 
punched into it that is slightly larger than the diameter of 
the tubing you are using.

Reverse RIMS...Yippee!...Part II


Hi again :-)


Part II


When adding the grains to the mash tun cover the end of 
the extension tubing with something to keep the grain from 
going into the tube. I use a piece of the next larger size 
tubing with a cap soldered on it. After the grains are 
doughed in, when it is time to put your false top on, you 
remove this cover from the tubing and slide the hole in the 
false top over the tubing extension. The false top will slide 
down into the mash and over the end of the L-shaped return 
tube. You then suspend the false top however you like and 
pull out the tubing extension. You are now ready to turn on 
your pump and start RevRIMSing!


It is also easy to find the end of the submerged tubing that 
is under wort within the false top, and to slip the tubing 
extension back in place so that the false top can be removed 
from the mash tun at any time should you want to. I do this 
to get it out of the way so that the normal rims return 
manifold can be put in place for normal RIMS recirculation 
at the end.


What I am currently using for my false top is a salvaged 
industrial basket strainer, which is amazing in the fact that 
it is perforated with zillions of very small holes very close 
together. I would be surprised if these holes are larger than 
1/32 of an inch max. This thing is just under 5 inches in 
diameter and 12 inches long. It has a sold bottom in which I 
punched a hole and an open top. I inserted it into the mash 
about 6 inches. 


Before reporting how my first two RevRIMS mashes 
turned out, first let me report on the mini test I tried, with a 
pound of crushed grain and warm tap water.  At this 
temperature I was able to put my hand in and feel around. 
The grain bed was only an inch or so deep but I could 
definitely feel the top standing up like grass under water. I 
think it was husks that were being lifted by the upward 
flow of the water as it passed through the bed. Not 
unexpected at all, but satisfying none the less. I assume 
something similar was going on when mashing the full 10-
gallon-batch worth of grains but it was too hot to stick my 
hand in.


So how did the mash react during my trial runs? 


The first trial run was a Belgian style wheat beer, a 50/50 
mix of malted wheat and pilsner malt. I doughed in the 
grains and immediately started recirculating [previously I 
would have let it rest for 15 or more minutes]. I had no 
problem recirculating at full maximum right from the start, 
which for my system is about 3 GPM. I was able to raise 
temperature of the mash at about 3 degrees F. per minute. 
This was for a mix of 18 lb. of grain and 5.5 gallons of 
water, or thereabouts.


I was very satisfied with the performance of the reverse 
flow up through the false bottom. The fact that the grains 
remain in suspension, rather than compacting, removes the 
limit to flow that I was experiencing with the conventional 
flow direction.


I had to pay some attention to what was going on with my 
basket strainer false top at high recirculation rates. A sort of 
filter bed built up against the outside of the vertical strainer 
walls and restricted flow into the inside chamber from 
which the liquid flows to the pump. All it took was a quick 
twist back and forth once or twice to shake the husks(I think) off. 
But this had to be watched and done repeatedly during high 
flow rate periods. I plan to experiment with a shallower and 
wider false top made from some perforated stainless steel 
sheet in the future. Remember that I have limited false top 
area at the moment, only about 95 square inches.


My second brew with this system also required the same 
attention to keep the husks from restricting flow into the 
basked strainer. There was minimal wheat malt in the grist 
this time. It is possible that with the reverse rims that husks 
are the main component of the material that reaches the 
surface of the false top [I should have taken care to 
remember what I saw when I took a sample]. My suspicion 
is that husks without grains against the false top offer the 
same opportunity for flow restriction as grains without 
husks on a false bottom. 


My hope is that a larger diameter, shallower device, 
something that better approximates a false bottom might 
function better and perhaps require no attention at all. Then 
again, if floating husks are the root cause, then the same 
thing could occur. I will have to check further on my next 
batch and see what the make-up of the stuff that is 
collecting against the false top is.


All in all I am pretty happy with the performance of my 
RevRIMS. It is a substantial improvement over the original 
setup. I can get enough flow to really input the heat I need 
for 2 to 3 degree F per minute temperature boosts of the 
mash itself. And I am willing to live with the need to twist 
my false top back and forth periodically. Much less effort 
than stirring the entire mash. As a matter of fact, I will 
probably try motorizing the false top so that it turns slowly. 
Hopefully this will be enough to keep the husks from 
blocking the flow.


I will know more after I get more batches under my belt 
and report back if anything of interest comes up.


I hope this is of interest to someone out there who is contemplating
building a rims...


I just have to say it one more time as I head out the door:


Reverse RIMS...Yippee!

Hi Folks,


Last brew session I used half a bag each of Fuggles and Kent Goldings. I
cleverly packed the remaining hops in two small mason jars to be used next
time. Trouble is, I tossed the original bag labels. Now I have two generic
jars of hops and can no longer tell them apart. Can someone help me identify
which is which. Thanks a bunch!

No Phil get your mind off of billiards for a moment.  


< cut to sponsor >


When you "top crop" or harvest the top crop of the yeast do you slow
down the ferment?  It would seem that when this yeast falls back through
the beer you would have a good crop of yeast to finish the ferment
quickly.  Can you over harvest?


On my next batch I may harvest one fermentor and leave the other just to
compare.


And now back to your billiards match.

I don't know where YOU learned to solder, but I had a 2 week course on
high reliablity  soldering from the US Air Force that was NASA approved,
and a properly tinned, sweat-soldered junction has a HIGH strength factor.


BTW,  every joint we made was QC'd under a 50 power scope for any signs of
poor quality.  Yes, the majority of solderers think the bigger the glob, 
the better the job.


If you want anything soldered, send it over here!


I always solder any joints I want HIGH RELIABILITY from.
