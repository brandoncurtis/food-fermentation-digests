Rob asked about NHC results for the east coast. The eastern site directors,
George and Nancy, conducted the judging May 6 and 7. The results for that
site have not been finalized as of Friday evening. When the results are
official they will be posted at http://beertown.org/AHA/NHC/aha2000.htm.
Thanks.

Subject: custom bottle caps


I know that all of us have seen the overruns at the brew store and was 
wondering if anyone has found a source to have custom bottle caps printed.  
Being in the printing industry, I know that the minimums will be relatively 
high but I do brew an awful lot of beer.  ERRRRR... Unless you're with the 
ATF, in which case I brew just under 200 gallons a year.  I believe that 
these are silk screened in the same manner that a golf ball, or a marble 
would be done.  Has anyone info on having some custom caps printed.  Please 
forward any address or company you might know of.

Subject: AHA Board


Greg Feathers accusations regarding his dealings with me are false.  I
have all my emails to and from him.  I quite frankly don't know what the
hell he's talking about.  I have never received one order from him, let
alone two, that went unfilled.


Greg is also an expert about my employees.  For the record, I have never
had better employees and service has never been better.  I lost one
employee today.  Brian E. is off to bootcamp and then medical school.


Now with regard to the AHA board elections.  First I should say that I
am one of the largest advertisers in Zymurgy.  I am a long time
supporter.  I offered the 5% discount to AHA members and increased my ad
size in response to the boycott of most homebrew suppliers of Zymurgy a
couple of years ago.


I think some are a little delusional about the importance of this
election.  I'll feel real good if I'm elected as should everyone else.
But the Board of Advisors ain't broke now, wasn't broke 2 or 5 or 10
years ago.  The Board of Advisors has always had excellent people and
any of the 9 up for election now will be fine.  Except for Pat Babcock
who showed he's unfit because the digest didn't come out Friday morning
:-)     Its a little like changing tires when the problem's under the hood.


I just want to  plug a couple of breweries who really came thru this
past weekend.  Youngs of London flew in a couple of firkins of Special
Bitter.  Jever of north Germany flew in a few cases of pilsner (this
beer will soon be available in NY, NJ, PA).  and the Belgian brewer at
New Belgium, (Colorado) who came from Rodenbach, brought down his Oud
Bruin Folie, a blended sour beer that is available only at the brewery,
3500 bottles total.  I'm going to throw myself a birthday party on
Memorial Day weekend and will have some of these beers.  Everybody, well
almost everybody, is invited.  email me for details.


I also had the pleasure of going into the beer cellar of what was
intended to be Austins first brewery.  The cellars were built in 1858-9
by German brewmaster Jeanne Schneider who was killed in 1862 before the
brewery opened.  The cellars were recently uncovered in downtown Austin.

If there was ever anyone who needs to be on the AHA BoA it is Scott Abene.
Charlie and co. need someone to put the fear of God back in them. If a
plaid-girded Skotrat can't do it, no one can. I'm not an AHA member currently,
but if Skotrat is elected I will definitely be reconsidering that.

Someone asked about AHA National scores. The midwest judging isn't until
tomorrow (Saturday, May 13) inconveniently scheduled on the same weekend the
Green Bay Rackers' Titletown Open has been scheduled for the past six years. It
makes it hard to get judges to commit to your competition when the date for
regionals gets set so late. We even had some people get p.o.'d at us for
setting the date the same day as the AHA, even though we had this day set many,
many months before the AHA was.

Re: Ray Daniels and Zymurgy
Does anyone know if Daniels has any real editorial control over what type of
articles will be run in Zymurgy, or is he simply handed an article and told,
"Make sure this is fundamentally correct"? If the latter, there is little
reason to hope for improvement in the content of the magazine.


Still waiting for my BT back issues, but not holding my breath,
  Matt
