Subject: Rust on stainless steel


G'day guys,


A few really good ways to get stainless steel to rust are:


1.      Put scratches in it.  This creates crevices where healthy oxygen
levels (which passivate) are depleted and other harmful oxidising agents
(such as chlorides) get a free run.  Polish out scratches!  Avoid any
cavities (eg arc weld blobs).  Unfortunately, when cavities start they can
drill right through.


2.      Get mild steel into the surface.  The best ways to trash stainless
this way are to allow grindings from your angle grinder to spray all over
it, or brush it with a mild steel wire brush. A galvanic cell starts, and
the grain of mild steel starts drilling into the stainless.  When it is
spent the crevice continues (see #1 above).  Nitric acid selectively eats
the mild steel so is a good treatment if used early enough (though
potentially dangerous, and I don't recall the correct concentration to use).
Don't contaminate stainless with mild steel!


3.      Overheat it by cutting, welding or boiling dry.  Overheating causes
carbon migration to the crystal boundaries, upsetting the chemical balance.
These crystals are no longer austenitic.  Welding needs to be with special
pulse machines and back gassing for highly reliable results.  Sorry, there
is no treatment for cooked stainless.


4.      Pick the wrong stainless. Yes, most stainless do rust. Food grade
316 is an austenitic stainless and highly corrosion resistant.  Hard
stainless (such as in knives) is typically martensitic, and not very
corrosion resistant.  A beer keg is a safe bet.


Good luck,

Subject: HSA and concentrated boils


Recently I decided to go back to extract brewing.  Basically summer is soon
and I don't want to spend 8 to 10 hours in a hot kitchen instead of outside!
This was my problem.  Since I chose to do a concentrated boil ( started at 2
1/2 gallons ), the hop pellets and the trub were impossible to strain out.
I decided afterwards that the next time I should add more water to the post
boil kettle to make whirlpooling and straining easier.  Can I add the cooled
water while the wort is still hot, or should I wait until after cooling ( I
use an immersion chiller )?
Another question is this.  I've noticed that after transferring the wort to
a carboy, about an hour later there is some trub ( after straining a full
boil batch ).  Is it worth siphoning off this? I straing pretty good ( other
than last weeks extract brew ), but should I get fanatical about it.


Thanks in advance,

I can't say for sure that this is a CAP, but it seems to fit the bill.
New Hampshire Custom Brewers (www.nhbrews.com) produces a beer called
Woody Beer.  It is self-described as "...a blend of rich American hops &
malt brewed in the tradition of the late 30's and 40's..."


I tried it this past winter but I did not make any tasting notes.  I
recall it being malty and clean with a noticable American variety hop
flavor.  I do not recall it being quite as bitter as 25 IBU's but like I
said, the maltiness came through; perhaps the bitterness was there...  I
seem to remember the alcohol was about 4.5% ABV, I think it said it on
the six-pack carrier.


If you want me to send you a six-pack I would be glad to, but the
brewery actually sells and ships beer directly from their website.  I do
not know if they have a minimum order requirement.

It's probably safe to say that the false bottom is round.  I also have a
Gott and it is also "wavy" in the sides.  This is probably due to the
foam that's injected into the cooler for insulation.  I'd be really
surprised if there are any coolers out there that are geometrically
(round or rectangular) perfect.


I made my own false bottom from a piece of perforated stainless (the same
type of stuff used by Stainless in Seattle).  I made it slightly smaller
than the diameter of the cooler.  I then took a piece of tubing and split
it lengthwise and wrapped it around the false bottom.  I used 1/4" teflon
tubing.  It is a snug fit but the teflon allows to slide to the bottom
without a lot of high pressure antics.


>I'm still playing with the idea of where to place the runoff tube. This might

There is a website that has a next bulkhead fitting for the Gott cooler.
I can't seem to locate the one I'm looking for but here is one idea from
Ken Schwartz, http://home.elp.rr.com/brewbeer/files/mashtun.gif
For my bulkhead fitting I found that a 3/8" NPT male fitting is a very
snug fit in the original grommet.

At the recommended pitching rate of a 1:10 step up in volume and using a
rather flocculant ale yeast, I'm imbibing in two weeks.  I use about 1/2
teasp. Irish moss at 15 min. before end of boil in 12.5 gals.  This is
below the amounts I read others using, but it seems to work for me.  


I primary for 3-4 days at ambient basement temperatures (in the high 60's
currently) and transfer to my secondary, which I place in my lagering
fridge to begin decreasing the temperature slowly.  At around the two week
mark, I 've got the temp. down in the 40's and transfer to cornies.  I
transfer to my serving fridge, drop the temp a bit more and force carbonate
overnight at 30 psi.  The next day--glorious beer!  Now, it may not be of
great clarity at this point, but in a couple more days, it's quite
tolerable.  I don't think you'll get crystal clarity unless you filter or
wait longer for everything to drop out.  


A friend of mine switches the quick connects so the CO2 goes in the liquid
tube, creating greater surface area for carbonation.  Using this method, he
carbonates within a few hours.  Beware though that you are aware of this
scheme.  Once I was at his brewery imbibing and a keg kicked.  I mentioned
this and he said, "Oh, there's another one in there, hook it up!"  At this
point, he should have realized that I was unintiated in the ways of his
carbonation method.  I always pride myself on connecting gas to gas and
liquid to liquid.  I should have known something was amiss when I heard
bubbling upon attaching the liquid connect.  But sometimes, in a full keg,
that little gas dip tube can get below beer level.  "I'll just connect the
gas here and we'll have beer, glorious beer", I must have thought.  Er...
um... Houston, we have a problem!  Yep, beer up the 'ol gas line into the
regulator.

Friends, Rimsers and countrymen


    I've been working on a rims system on and off for a bout 6 months
now. I 
mail ordered a 10 gallon gott cooler to do mashing in, which after
receiving 
I promptly put away in the closet.  Months later I've returned to
finishing 
the project and am horrified at what I'm seeing. A stainless steel false 
bottom from Stainless in Seattle has come in and I can't get the thing
into 
the cooler with anything less than a violent pounding. It seems the
sides of 
the cooler are not straight, with bulges in multiple locations. Once in
the 
bottom of the cooler (after scraping h*** out of the sides) I find that
the 
cooler isn't even round, more like slightly oval. I assume, but haven't 
proven, that the false bottom is round.
My questions for the group are as follows:


1)  Is this sort of construction typical in all gott coolers? 
2)  Is there anything I can do about it to get the bulges smoothed out?
3)  What is a typical gap that one can live with between the edge of the 
false bottom and the cooler surface.
4)  This question should be worth a cheap giggle. Where in the North San 
Diego County (or even nearby) can I find these coolers? I figure if I
take 
the false bottom with me for sizing I should be able to locate at least
one 
that will fit. I've blown the gas budget for this month looking.




Greg, I completed a herms with a gott cooler about 3 months ago, and
have some similar experiences, so to answer your questions.
1. I think so
2. Don't think so
3. I wouldn't worry about anything under an 1/8 of an inch, I use a
phils and the roundness really doesn't    matter, just the seal on the
bottom.  Further, with the grain on top it should push the false bottom
down.
4. As a resident of SD county also, I feel your pain. Try lumber
stores,ie, Dixieline; if you are in N. Cnty     give Orco a call. Also,
if that brings you no luck, try Roofing Wholesale, or a similar
business.
5. check out my humble, slightly unfinished page to see my system.      
http://members.spree.com/health/dowquest/brewpage.html
6. Don't give up, making the herms for me was a pain also, but fun. More
importantly, Totally worth it!
   I was able to cut out ALL my temp. worries and with the addition of
the pump, shave off an hour of my brew    time!
Good luck , if you need more info, contact me and I'll do my best to
help.  Jerry Daoust

I think the problem here is chill haze.  I don't think Irish moss will have
that much effect.  Time is the best cure if you're going to chill your
beer.  Perhaps silica gel, which is a mineral product and is insoluble (as
is polyclar) will help you.  It will settle out, according to Williams
Brewing, which sells it, although the commercial procedure is to filter it.
It removes the proteinaceous culprits.

1) Yup. I have two and they both bulged after repeated use.
2) Nope. Not unless Samantha from Bewitched wiggles her nose.
3) Before I switched to a manifold, I had a Phil's Phalse bottom that
had about 3/4 of an inch gap all the way around it when in the cooler. I
weighted it down with the standard ball bearing/vinyl tube assembly.
Worked fine.
4) No idea. I live 1/2 an hour from even the nearest lame hardware
store.


I finally converted a keg to a mash tun and dumped the cooler. Not only
does it retain it's shape, but the geometry of it allows for a more

On my first cooler, I went out where the manufacturer had intended,
through the side. However, as the side is curved, sealing can be
somewhat problematic. My second one I went through the bottom, and it
was much easier to seal. With my keg tun, I went through the bottom as
well.

No one seems interested in a sample of my skunk oil but plenty would like to
try the Ayinger yeast. I will organise distribution of the culture to the
Aussies (yes Dave Lamotte, one sample will be heading your way) and for
those of you in the USA, I'm sure I can arrange something for you. I haven't
had the time to respond individually. It's late at night and I'm all out of
breath. Jill has been after me with that wretched "cat of nine tails" again.
Can a bloke do nothing right?

Hi Everyone,
Was it last year or the year before?  As a part of the Great Taste of the 
Midwest, the Madison Homebrewers and Tasters Guild held a friendly 
competition among the Wisconsin Brewers to brew a Classic American 
Pilsner.  I don't recall all the details, but I think that they worked with 
a fairly standardized grain bill...anyhow.  These beers were produced by a 
number of the Wisconsin breweries and were sold as commercial products.  If 
I'm not mistaken, The Capital Brewery in Middleton now produces a beer 
"1900" which is their interpretation of a pre-prohibition pilsner.  It's 
available commercially and it's a good beer.  Hope this helps.


Also, we've seen a few CAP's come through the Big and Huge Homebrew 
competition and do fairly well in recent years.  If anybody wants more 
info, we can probably find someone with better information.

For those interested, the website is not very revealing, other than "comes 
from and od Wisconsin recipe, circa 1900."  I'm sure you could try to 
contact Kirby if you want more details for personal interest, or for a 
write-up.

I believe that since you are making 10 gallon batches you could 
spread the drinking out over several weeks.  Drinking all of that 
in a day or two could have detrimental effects on your life and 
your job.  In addition the headaches are killers.  <GRIN>

Greg's cooler isn't round, wonders where to find another near San
Diego, and wonders about pickup tube placement re: the false bottom.


Ouch. Well, I bought mine at Smart and Final, and having used both 5
and 10 gallon sizes, there is a definite advantage to grainbed depth
and extraction if you use the 5 gal size for 5 gallon batches, and 10
for 10. But, I havent done RIMs with them so bear that in mind. Ace
Hardware also carries them. I live near Los Angeles.


I would say that there is not any ideal depth for the dimension
beneath the false bottom. Probably a half inch is plenty. And between
the edge of the false bottom and the walls, the answer is zero. You
really don't want a gap, otherwise it presents an easy flow path down
the walls to the drain and you wont' lauter properly plus you will
suck a lot of grain under the fb.


The pickup tube needs to be placed in the center of the fb, otherwise
you will tend to draw from one side of the mash more than the other.


I have an article on fluid flow on my webpage that describes some of
this issue.

Has anyone tried covering the surface of the mash liquid with small
floating balls? I have seen such balls for use to reduce heat loss from
liquid surfaces but wouldn't they also work for reducing O2 contact? Does
anyone have a suggested source of small, high-temp, food-grade floating
balls?

I suggest switching yeast.  Not a joke.  If you're pitching an
adequate quantity, the yeast should drop bright during your 2 week
secondary.  Unless it's a yeast that doesn't do so.  Look for a yeast
with good flocculation.  Wyeast 1056 is NOT one.  One that I know of
is NCYC 1187, which is available from Yeast Culture Kit Co
(yckco`at`aol.com), and may be available from Yeastlab as one of their
"British" ale yeasts (I'm not sure).


Or, maybe your haze problem is not from yeast.  Chill haze, for
example, will eventually drop out, but will take several weeks or
longer to do so.  This is what you're trying to avoid with the Irish
Moss additions, though.


I often use gelatin to help drop the yeast.  You can't do that.  Does
anyone know whether agar-agar will work similarly to gelatin to drop
yeast?  For example, I brewed on Sunday, April 30.  I pitched about 2
ounces of thick yeast slurry from a local brewpub.  The beer finally
(almost) stopped fermenting on Saturday, May 6.  I racked to a keg
with some gelatin.  On Sunday, May 7, I racked to another keg,
(discarding the first few 100 ml, which were cloudy with yeast).  The
beer was pretty clear for a party Sunday evening, and very clear by
Friday, May 12 when I took some to the homebrew club meeting.

12May00 - UPN - Burradoo Hilton:
Brenda Dundee is home as usual, making dinner, when Tim
Finnegan arrives at her door.


"Brenda, may I come in?" he asks.  "I've
somethin' to tell ya."


"Of course you can come in, you're always welcome, Tim. But
where's my husband?"


"That's what I'm here to be tellin' ya, Brenda. There was an
accident down at the Fosters brewery..."


"Oh, God no!" cries Brenda.  "Please don't tell me..."


"I must, Brenda.  Your husband Mick is dead and gone.  I'm
sorry."


Brenda reached a hand out to her side, found the arm of the
rocking chair by the fireplace, pulled the chair to her and collapsed
into it. She wept for many minutes.  Finally she looked up at Tim. "How
did it happen, Tim?"


"It was terrible, Brenda.  He fell into a vat of Fosters Lager and drowned."


"Oh my dear!  But you must tell me true, Tim.  Did he at
least go quickly?"


"Well, no Brenda ... no."


"No?"


"Fact is, he got out three times to pee."

In HBD #3326  Patrick Finerty asked about the clarity of his beer.  You
could try leaving in the secondary for another week.  When you rack to
the keg, do you move the fermenter?  That could stir it up a bit.  The
first thing that came to mind, though, was that the haze dropped out in
the keg and got sucked out the dip tube for the first several beers. 
After a while all of the haze has fallen out and been sucked out so it
starts running clear.  If you don't want to wait for the beer to clear in
the secondary, you could try shortening the dip tube in your keg so it
doesn't pick up the settled matter.


As for tasting different, that's the great thing about homebrewing, the
beer continues to change (unless you filter it - but then you won't have
a haze problem).  The stout I made at Big Brew 1999 was pretty good into
the fall.  I left it alone for a while while I was drinking other things,
and finished it in March.  It was fabulous.  Made me wish I had saved the
whole thing.


Good luck.

Long time no post..


I know this is slightly off topic of the AHA discussion that's going on, But
I know the depth of knowledge here is greater than any other 3 sources
combined.


I do a lot of research into middle ages, and renaissance brewing, with
occasional recreations when I have time to brew.  


I have a LOT of sources for English recipes, and instructions, and grain
bills dating from 1000 - 1669, but I have very little from other countries.
I am looking to expand my resources, and repertoire.  I am looking for
sources of information that might point me to references to Flemish,
Belgium,  French, German, etc. recipes or grain bills, or ratios, etc. for
these regional areas.


Replying privately would probably work if you have any suggestions.


I already have the following books: Corran, Bickerdyke, Anglo Saxon Food and
Beverages II, Harrison, Digby, Markham as well as a slew of modern
references.


Thanks in advance to any and all who help.
