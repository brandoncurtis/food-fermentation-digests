Subject: more dorm fridge stuff


Greetings folks,


 In HBD #3330, Bill Wible wants to add a tap tower to his dorm 
fridge and asks if it can be done without damaging the refrigerant 
lines.


 Dorm fridges usually contain a simple refrigeration system. The 
evaporator is usually formed into the freezer or ice cube 
compartment and the cold air simply falls from it to cool the main 
compartment.


 The lines to and from the compressor will normally run up the back 
of the cabinet and enter the box behind the freezer/ice 
compartment. That's all there is to it!


 I've never seen a dorm fridge with anything but insulation in the 
top of the cabinet. My suggestion is to look the fridge over carefully 
and be sure you can follow the path of the refrigerant lines. You 
may have to remove a cover to gain acess to them. If there is a light 
in the top of the fridge look for related wiring. Go slowly and you 
should find no surprises.


 I've seen many types of drip trays - including trays that mount to a 
horizontal surface. Any retailer who sells dispensing equipment 
should either have one or be able to order one for you.


Hope this helps!

On the last day of MCAB I gave Mary Anne Gruber of Breiss a ride to the
Annheiser Busch tour and asked if grain can be frozen. She answered that
non-enzymatic grains can be frozen: chocolate, crystal, black, etc. Don't
store your base malt in the freezer. If you are an extract brewer that
should suit you well.

The Special Issue of 1988 (I've been a member since 1980) has a photo of
Kathy Ireland, reportedly a homebrewer, on the cover with a red RDWHAHB
t-shirt and white shorts (no, not a swim suit), seated on a sandy beach
with a dark beer in one hand and here arm around a carboy.  Inside is a
"profile" article by Charlie Papazian, and photos of the two of them
talking over a picnic table with homebrews.  At that time she'd been
brewing for two years.  I wonder if she still brews?

I want to make an A/G  brew using wheat malt, but I don't want the cloudiness 
that goes with it. Using say a lb or so, what's the best way to avoid the 
haze? How about using polyclar in secondary,  and/or isinglass at bottling?
  I have a great looking recipe for wit that calls for about 3 lbs, can that 
much still produce a clear glass?

is this a sure way to coat the cieling, as well as the stove, with that

    Or, is there a way to manage the situation?

Subject: Beer toxicity, Australian breweries and the art or since of


Some time ago there was a post asking about the toxicity of alcohol.


Specifically how much beer do you need to kill you.


Obviously it depends on the person but I remember in the newspaper a couple
of years ago someone dyed of alcohol poisoning attempting to drink 100 beers
in 100 minutes. I believe he made it went to bed and didn't wake up. There
are also no shortage of persons that have succeeded in this and many ho went
to bed earlier. Obviously all idiots that don't know beer with any reel
flavor. Personally I wold be out within the first minute.


I wold also like to comment on national breweries in Australia. I live in
western Australia and by far the 2 most popular beers in my age group are
Victoria biter and emu biter I don't think three isn't a pub in Perth that
doesn't have one on tap. When I drink one I will choose emu being made in
western Australia but bother are similar in taste I do prefer the emu.


As to being a biter emu biter is currently advertising itself as Australia's
bitterest beer and the ad states 26 ibus. Judging from  what iv herd that's
not much.


I wold also like to comment on brewing art v since.


Pleas feel free to dismiss my ideas as I have not been brewing long but
think about them first.


Brewing the best beer is an art
Brewing consistent beer is a since.


Mega breweries require consistency above all else.
Brewpubs need less consistency but still more than home brewers.


A home brewer should strive for the ability to make the best beer in the
world all the time. This requires both art and since in large measure.

Subject: "Racking" from a mash


Hi all. Searching the HBD archives has resulted in a few positive
experiences re: using a racking cane, with a choreboy or something
similar attached, to transfer bitter wort from kettle to primary. I was
wondering if anyone has used an "easymasher" type gadget or, what I'd
really like to do, actually submerged some kind of manifold into the tun
when your ready to sparge (or batch-sparge, or no-sparge as the case may
be...)


I ask because I really hate the idea of drilling a hole in my kettle and
this seems like a good idea on paper. The biggest challenge I can
foresee is starting the siphon of the sweet wort from the tun; I don't
relish the idea of burning my lips.


Any thoughts?

Subject: Re: Beechwood


Apparently, wood chips were used to clear the beer more quickly; here's a
quote from Wahl & Henius:


"If it is desired to bring the beer quickly on the market (city beer), add
chips to the  storage beer and also isinglass for preliminary fining"


and also:


"Matter remaing in suspension at the end of the storage period is
eliminated by mechanical means.  First among them is the introduction of
chips."


They recommend beech or maple from young trees, well seasoned and
thoroughly boiled in 3 different soda solutions to remove wood flavor,
resin, and make the wood more porous, and give information about amounts
and sizes of the chips, and so forth,
Most of this info is on page 762, but also other locations.  I don't have
time to track it all down now.
My impression of this is that wood chips will absorb proteins as well as
yeast cells, thus clarifying the beer faster than it would otherwise by
time and gravity.  But I haven't tried it, although I have lots of
well-seasoned maple firewood I could use. 


Cheers, Jim

I have been able to reduce my propane use a small amount ( I think) with my
wort stirrer.  I've used it once, and did notice the resulting beer was
more bitter than I had anticipated.  I thought I was imagining it. :)
Guess not.

I've often considered doing a similar thing, only with a window style AC
unit.  The basic thought was to build an isulated box and use an A/C unit
with an add-on thermostat for lager and warm weather ale fermentation.  I've
seem a few plans online for such a beast but never actually talked to anyone
who'd done it.  Any success/horror stories?

Yep - bang on Jeff (I'm watching you..... :) )


Anyway, on the subject of crappy australian beer... VB is the biggest
seller in australia, and is available coast to coast. The notion of
parochial beer drinkers is something of the past, back in the days when
there were plenty of smaller breweries, and each produced distintive
styles. Rationalization and takeovers which lest 2 megabrewing giants put a
stop to that. VB (Victoria "Bitter", for those wondering) is made with 40%
cane sugar in the grist (yep, that's right..) and bittered to about 18 IBU.
I suspect, as Phil does, that it used to be a very different beer (as was
Fosters, which now is just the same old lollywater as the rest). As Andy
Walsh so aptly put it "Fosters - Australian for Blecch"

The HBD contributors come through again.


The consensus on my question about freezing malt extract and malted barley
grains was a resounding YES! Why the heck not?!?!  Some responders cited up
to a year or more of storage in freezers with no apparent adverse effects.
Two observations that I think may be useful to others as green as me:


1)  If storing in a freezer/fridge that is self-defrosting, a tight closure
is especially essential, due to the dehydrating effects that such devices
tend to have on foods.  So, if you intend to keep your malts for a
loooonnnnngggggg time in a defrosting freezer, double-check those seals.


2)  If it is necessary to keep a container of partially used liquid malt
extract, floating a little skim of vodka (personally, I would use scotch) on
top should help to further minimize contamination and oxidation.


Many thanks to all who helped assuage my concerns.
