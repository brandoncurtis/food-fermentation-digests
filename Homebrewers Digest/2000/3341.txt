Subject: re: mash pH


A little context:
Nathaniel Lansing attempts to prove that I am in error when I report
that I have experienced entirely normal levels of head foam in beers brewed
without a mashout.  His refutation of my repeated experimental result is a
journal experiment paper which shows a 14% increase in certain foam related
proteins during a 76C 'mashout' of a modified Congress mash.  I question the
relevance of this paper to typical brewing and his overgeneralized
conclusion that mashout is *necessary* for normal foam levels on several
grounds.  The amount of foam active proteins (and correlative factors)
needed for normal foam is not evident and the extended 90 minute mashout
period only increase levels of the critical protein fraction by 14%.  The
experimental mash is rather thin (~2qt/lb).  The mash is not pH adjusted
(see below). The experimental malt is very overcrushed by brewing standards.
The step mash period is unusually lengthy (3.3 hours mash + 1.5 hour
mashout).


Nathaniel Lansing experiments and writes ...
>Steve had said a congress mash of 25 g malt in 100 ml
>distilled water with 150ppm Ca++ was not pH adjusted; it obviously is.


"pH adjustment" means controlling the pH to a predetermined value or range
based on measurement.  It does NOT mean happening upon a reasonable pH based
on a particular combination of calcium addition, malt and temperature.  This
must be so because most reports I have read indicate entirely different
resulting pH values under similar conditions to your experiment.  Also a
Congress mash CANNOT include a calcium addition; you have described a
*modified* Congress mash with respect to ion addition. temperatures and
time.


That your experimental result produced a mash pH in the normal brewing pH
range is a very interesting, even odd result and I sincerely applaud you for
performing and reporting on the experiment.   The paper you cited did add
150ppm calcium ions to the mash water, but was NOT pH adjusted to any
specified value as far as I can tell.


Some obvious problems arise in your experiments implementation and your
report.


1/ The paper's calcium ions may have been from calcium's sulfate, calcium
hydroxide, calcium bicarbonate or other sources.  I would expect different
pH results from each of these for several different reasons.  See the
'procedures' or 'methods' portion of the quoted paper.


2/ Adding the calcium after the mash-in, as you did, should have a different
effect than adding the calcium before mash-in or at a lower temperature.


3/ The explanation of the pH increase you observed is an anomaly, as Dave
Burley and Aaron Sepanski noted, which violates reference sources and common
experience and *requires* an explanation.  Your pH both in distilled water
and after gypsum addition defy common experience, as noted by A.J.deLange
and ubiquitous reports in the brewing lit.  It is puzzling that Continental
lager brewing with Plzen water quite close to distilled require
acidification,
but your experiment required a pH increase !!!   Your results call for
experimental repetition, and explanation.  To your credit you did repeat
these, with the same anomalous result. Now it is time to have someone else
repeat the experiment - someone without an axe to grind.  It would be nice
if AJ or Alan Meeker or Scott Murman another party not directly involved
in the discussion but with access to the lab equipment and a good reputation
for accurate unbiased reportage would repeat this portion.


4/ Based on the unusual pH result you observed and the lack of explanation,
any conclusion is unwarranted.  But yours is outlandish ...
>Conclusion: An extremely small mash responds to mash liquor
>mineral content the same way a production mash responds to
>mineral additions.
Size (proportion) has nothing to do with the result of course.  Calcium's
normal effect is to  DECREASE mash pH  but  your calcium addition INCREASED
pH.  These are not "the same" but are opposite results.  As George Fix
writes in PoBS2, pp4, "....Calcium.... . These ions react with malt
phosphates (primarily K2.HPO4) and thus decrease [mash] pH ...." .


The most readable and detailed description of the impact of calcium and
phosphates related to brewing pH that I have *ever* read appeared in the HBD
as a discussion primarily between Alan Meeker and A.J.deLange not so long
ago.


Again Nathaniel, I sincerely applaud your report of an interesting
experiment and result.  To me your result defies the literature, the methods
of continental brewing and my experience with calcium additions, and I
cannot make sense of your conclusion that a pH increase is "the same"
as a pH decrease.

 Why not try a half pound of rice hulls,

I'll second that - Ultra is wonderful, and it isn't often that I can say

stylistically closer to Saaz and is completely at home in a Pils. Spalter is

It is a rare sight to see Regan posting more than once every 6 months.
And the same day as Phil!


I think your all giving Fosters a hard wrap. Its a great beer...to throw
at a footy match.....to drink warm camping when some dumb bastard thinks
it a funny idea for the only alcholic beverages to be bought are Fosters 
tinnies.....to unclog the sink.


My house mates in Amherst Mass took no amount of convicing that the only
beer on sale in OZ is Fosters. A bit like the idea in Oz that Amercians 
only drink budweiser I guess.


Its an old mans beer...and definately not one that you asked for loudly
over the bar. Come to think of it, i dont seem to know of many pubs in 
sydney with on tap. MAybe the best place to look is the Burradoo Hilton. 
Are you hiding secrets from us phil??

Regan,
a guy whose name escapes me but who said he was ex-CUB and who at the time
worked for the Heathcote winery  told me that the wort for VB, Carlton
Draught, Crown Lager, Fosters and Melbourne Bitter was the same.  According
to him, after fermentation with no hops as you described and subsequent
filtration, the wort was checked against specs before blending.  Wort that
was within spec was used for Crown.  The rest was blended with wort from
other ferments until within spec.  All were then hopped using ISO Hop,
coloured, carbonated, packaged and pasteurised.  Yum!


Still, I can't imagine what use this information could be to anybody.


Cheers,
Richard Pass

Hi 


South African Breweries is thge 3rd or 4th biggest brewery in the 
world. This is how they keep out the competition.
(In my opinion, definitely not by providing a nice beer). 


>>>>>
SA Breweries blocks Kenya Breweries with an elephant


SA Breweries (SAB) has a registered elephant trade mark for one of 
its brands and it has told Kenya Breweries, which has indicated its 
desire to enter the SA market, that the elephant icon of its leading 
brand, Tusker, requires some alteration if it is to be introduced 
into SA. It refuses to do so, says SAB.  


SAB says conversely if it attempted to produce or export a product 
into Kenya bearing its elephant trade mark, it would be reasonable 
for the Kenyans to refuse to allow such a product to be sold there.

Subject: Beer on airplanes


To the collective:


Pardon me for getting a little off topic.  I have always bemoaned the
fact that the beers available on airlines are not of the quality that
I care to drink unless I am REALLY thirsty.  I have even complained
about this to the airlines.


It finally dawned on me that the problem here is that the airline
serves everything in cans or in very small bottles, and I know of only
a few high-quality craft-brewed beers that come in cans.


Am I wrong in this assessment?  What can we do about this?  Drink
wine?

Subject: Water analysis help


Howdy all,


as per suggestion by a fellow brewer who was of great help to me on rcb I am
posting my local tap water analysis with the hopes of finding out if there
is anything in there that is causing a "metallic" aroma and off-flavor in my
brews (extracts/partial mash, concentrated boils).


I have never boiled or let the water sit overnight before brewing...


This is straight out of the tap and all are in ppm (except pH?).


pH: 6.6
Alkalinity (P): 0                Alkalinity (T): 28.0
Chloride: 5.1                 Sulfate: 3.6         Fluoride: 1.1
Free CO2: 15                 Iron: <0.1                Magnesium: 1.4
Manganese: 0.034                 Calcium: 8.1        Sodium: 5.5
Potassium: <1.0                Ca+Mg Hardness as CaCO3: 26


Chlorine content measured from the tap was right at 1ppm.


Any suggestions?  Boil first?  Let it stand overnight?


Now, having said that, I have access to water (w/o the convenience of being
from the tap) with no treatment and the following analysis:


pH: 5.5
Alkalinity (P): 0                Alkalinity (T): 12.0
Chloride: 15.0                 Sulfate: 3.2         Fluoride: <0.1
Free CO2: 83                 Iron: <0.1                Magnesium: 1.0
Manganese: 0.005                 Calcium: 2.1        Sodium: 5.2
Potassium: 1.3                Ca+Mg Hardness as CaCO3: 9


No Chlorine measured.


Would I see a significant improvement in my brew by using the untreated
water or stick with the ease of tap water?  Would I need to add anything for
a good bitter (my favorite brew) to either one?


Thanks for any help!


Cheers!
Bob

Subject: Simple fix for false bottom woes






Hello all,


        Steve Lane writes in about his problems with a set mash in
his 2 tier converted keg system.  He suspects that his problem is
due to a sagging false bottom that restricts the flow.  Steve, if
the false bottom is really the culprit, then there's an easy solution
that I'll outline below.  However, the grain bill you mention has
a lot of oats, which are notoriously "sticky," unless you do a low
temperature beta-glucanase rest (104-108F, for about 15 minutes.)
The other non-hardware suggestion is just to keep the flow rates as
low as you can without scorching.  Having mentioned these possibilities,
here's the hardware approach.


        A few years back, I posted about my problems with a Sabco false 
bottom that kept collapsing during recirculation.  Keeping the mash 
moderately thick and pump flow rates low avoided full collapses, but
the false bottom still seemed to flex a bit, allowing grain to come through.
Because of this, I had to clear the post-pump gate valve frequently during 
recirculation, to avoid clogging.  After my initial post, a number of people 
suggested support systems for the center of the false bottom. I finally 
gotten around to fabricating a simple piece that seems to fix the problem 
entirely.


        The problem is that the Sabco FB is a 12" diameter circle of 
perforated stainless that's hinged in the middle, to make it easy to 
install/remove.  There's a 1/2" hole in the middle where a drain tube runs
through to the bottom of a converted keg.  The FB seemed to flex in the 
middle, under the weight of grain and suction from the pump, because it's
supported only aroung the edges.  The easiest support for the middle section
that I've been able to come up with is to take a short length of 1 1/2" OD
copper pipe, cut to the distance from the bottom of the keg to the bottom
of the FB (1 3/8" in my case.)  I then cut four large "slots" in the bottom
The pipe fits "around" the drain tube, under the FB, supporting it from below. 
To put the mash tun together, just put in the copper support pipe (slotted 
in the false bottom, with the center hole over the top of the copper pipe, 
then install the drain tube down the middle.

        So far, the device has worked quite well.  The FB has shown 
no evidence of flexing after a typical 20+ lb grain bill.  With such batches 
before adding the support, the FB was coming out pretty warped.  It seems to 
be a very simple fix to the problem.

Ahh, the marketers here in the States are are much too clever to brew it
here - they want to be able to say in big letters, "IMPORTED".  So they
brew it in Canada and ship it across the border duty free thanks to NAFTA
(North American Free Trade Agreement).


I wouldn't be surprised if they brew some here so the Canadians can drink

Not really, dextrin malt is specially made to resist further hydrolysis
by malt enzymes, and the malster states Carapils (r) _must_ be mashed.
A good portion of the unfermentables in  crystal malts is from the
caramelization of the sugars, again resistant to hydrolysis
(not as resistant as dextrin malt).  If you are doing a full mash it is
not a big deal to change the temperature profile to increase the dextrin
production anyway.

Do your beers come out thin and overattenuated? If they do, calibrate
your thermometer, or kick your rest temperatures up a coupla degrees.
  crystal malts (excluding Carapils (r) 'dextrine malt') = color and flavor
  mash temperature=body and attenuation

Steve,you never stated the flow rate of your system, maybe your problem
lies with the gpm of your system. Even though you state you back it
down, is it enough?  I have another 3 keg system, but I am running a
sort of rims/ herms hybrid. I have a separate heating vessel, about 2-3
times bigger than the average rims with a heat exchanger in it. This
allows me to flow the wort at ~ 1 gal/min, I have used it for the past 7
months without any problems whatsoever. The grain bed has never stuck,
and I haven't had any problems scorching the wort. I think if you backed
down your flow rate(if possible) to the 1-2 gal per minute range you
won't have the stuck mash probs.   Good luck, Jerry Daoust

I once used an alt yeast fermenting at the lower end of temperature range
for ale fermentation.  It produced the sulfur aroma of a lager yeast.  It
would seem that at least for certain ale strains, temperature can induce
sulfur production.  BTW, the beer came out fine.  I've also used other ale
yeasts in brewing a porter at 50 degrees or so (when you have an unheated
basement in VT in winter, you do what you gotta do) and recall no sulfur
production.  Other than  finishing at a higher than expected gravity, this
one came out fine too.

further if you make a cooperative purchase with some other homebrewers and
order at least $200 worth in a single order direct from Five Star.  I don't
know that any HB shop will be able to give you a better price for a larger

Nathan, something seems seriously wrong with your pH experiment. As pointed

I didn't read the original post closely enough - was the 4.78 the pH of the
di-water or the mash made with the di-water? If it was the di-water then
that could explain the "backwards" result, otherwise something is indeed
fishy!

The reason you'll rarely, if ever,  get a pH of 7.0 for "pure" distilled
water is that you'll never have truly pure water! It will always be in
equilibrium with whatever gasses it is exposed to - notably CO2 which will
set up an equilibrium forming carbonate species and carbonic acid in
solution. Boiling will remove dissolved CO2 gas and shift the equilibrium
but it will be VERY difficult to ever get a situation where you've totally
eliminated all the relevant species and since water has virtually no
buffering capacity of it's own it doesn't take much to deflect the pH away
from it's theoretical value of 7.00

I did expect a number of those "why do you want to bother" responses.
While I like everything from IPA to Barleywine to Stout to Porter to Berliner
Weisse (without syrup), and brew those beers for myself,  I also brew beer

withstand boiling temperatures.


In other experiments I have tried, I used the thin aquarium tubing assuming
it is food grade.  It doesn't hold up well to the high temperatures.  It
even seems to deteriorate after multiple mashes.


Right now, I like to use the device because of its temperature alarm.  I
start the mash water and set the alarm to 5F below the temperature I
want(making sure only the tip is in the water).  Then mill the grain and do
other stuff. The alarm lets me know when its time to pay attention.

If you check the archives for the last 12 months or so, you will find a

version (for a price).


In my experience, they should be able to claim 1F repeatability.  It seems
that when the temperature is changing rapidly, the units seem to update in
two degree increments.  Once things settle down they fluctuate in one
degree increments.  They must have built in some kind of tracking loop that
waits for a 2F change before update during rapid movements.


I assume it is the same when set to degrees C.  (Does "C" stand for degrees

Greg is having problems with his hops, and BR suggest it might be spider

hurt them when young. Blasting the leaves with water is great too. If
done early on, along with the Lacewings, these methods should work.
Another semi green alternative is a paraffin wax based spray. This will
wail on the mites, but is only semi green, for while the product itself
is fine for the environment (so I'm told) it is a petroleum based
product, and hence the manufacturing of it is presumably ugly.


Steve asks about manifold designs for a RIMS. I use a cpvc manifold,

Phalse bottom had become a Phlat bottom (or, as I called it while
dumping out 25 # of grain to unstick the mash, ph**ed bottom), and it is

Just a (nitpicking) clarification, but a few people lately have
been writing about thermocouples becoming water-soaked
and unreliable.  Thermocouples operate by exploiting the
Seebeck effect and are absolutely waterproof.  Although I
haven't seen them, the Lowe's digital thermometers almost
certainly use thermistors, which measure temperature via
resistance changes.  And it is possible for the semiconductor
material of a thermistor to become water-soaked and give
false readings.


Thermistor thermometers can be very sensitive and give
repeatable readings.  If your digital thermistor
thermometer doesn't perform to your expectations,
it might be possible to calibrate it with a more accurate
thermometer.

PU, as are many other czech pilsners, is made with only Saaz (Zatek in
Czech) hops. There are only 3 other hops grown in Czech Republic.  Bor,
Sladek, and Premiant. Many breweries use Bor and Sladek (I never saw a
brewery using Premiant) in early additions only.  Neither Bor, Sladek,
Premiant are available in US.


Just as with German hops, the hop name also includes the region where the
hops are grown.  There are 3 regions in Czech Rep.  Saaz hops are grown in
all three but the Saaz (Zatek) hops from the Saaz (Zatek) region are
superior.  PU and Budvar, for example, use only Zatek Zatek.


When you buy Saaz hops at homebrew shops, including mine, you can't tell
from the labeling which region the hops are from.  None of the hop
processors in North America include this information in the labeling
either; they just sell 'Czech Saaz', even though I'm sure at least some of
the hops are in fact Zatek Zatek.  I am certain that we sell Zatek Zatek
and the labeling will reflect that in the next catalog.

Subject: Diacetyl


Doug Moyer asks about diacetyl, poor handling and autolysis.   Different
people have different perceptions.  Personally I don't think the two can be
confused.  To me diacetyl is a buttery character that's quite distinctive;
I'm pretty sensitive to it whereas I'm not as sensitive to DMS although I
can detect it at higher levels.  Autolysis to me has a rubbery, sulfury
nature that quite distinctive as well.  And I've rarely noticed it in
homebrewed beers, but when it's detectable, it's VERY noticeable.  The thing
to think about is the sources of diacetyl.  Produced during normal
fermentation and later absorbed by the yeast, diacetyl is present in all
beer at some point, but those that are not lagered, consumed too soon before
the diacetyl is absorbed, perhaps racked too soon off of the yeast or the
yeast fell out of suspension too soon due to thermal shock may have levels
of diacetyl that are too high for the style.  Some yeast produce more
diacetyl or re-absorb less than others.  Fermentation at higher temperatures
tends to create more diacetyl, pehaps more than the yeast can absorb.
Another source is infections the release diacetyl.  Pediococcus is one of
these.  Most brewers do not sterilize bottles or in some cases even sanitize
or rinse.  They are delivered from the glass manufacturer and filled.   So
time spent unrefridgerated lends opportunity to any latent infections that
can result in additional diacetyl.  Especially long journeys in warm trucks.

I sort of feel sorry for other people outside Australia.  When we talk about
mateship and use the term 'mate' it has a totally different meaning to the
rest of the world.  I say this with the information that my Wit yeast
culture from Brad should arrive today.  Now poor Brad lives in the colder
clims of the Great South Land, and while I do feel sorry for that, he had no
hesitation in sending the Wit yeast when I asked.  And Phil, with his offer
to send that famous rampant yeast to the far reaches of this brown land is
truely appreciated. (although he does test it sometimes - more latter).
There arn't too many places I know where people are that willing to share at
the drop of a hat.  Why even Scott is a true mate, will to share his French
maidens if I ever make my way down there.


But why do I write.  Well I was in my local hardware store (handles all the
purchases for Nth Aus) and could not but overhear a conversation.  Seemed he
represented the hotel industry in the Whitsundays, and they had decided to
refurbish their toilets.  Now the manager was more than pleased but wanted
to know why?  Well it seems that some bloke with a homie in hand was running
from floor to floor and hotel to hotel, checking and complaining about the
toilets, yelling something about fags and american rubbish in the one
breath.  Well it seems when he was eventually cornered and stated he was the
owner of some famous hotel, and a quick tirade from him had forces the hotel
industry to 'have a wee look at itself'.


Its also strange that a local rice farmer thought the famous Bud was trying
to buy up our rice crop.  He wasn't convinced by the arguments from the guy
that he was the brewmaster of a famous hotel in NSW and needed more rice.  I
dont know why, but I cant help but put the two incidents together.  But how
did I hear of this and about Phils mateship.  Well I live a few hours North
of the Whitsundays, and knowing Phil would be up, I offered my pool table,
and even the ladies if he would supply the famous lager.  Now I know Phil is
only used to the best standards of the 'Hilton', and even I have heard that
the Whitsundays didn't quite messure up, but when I told him that my pool
table was not quite full size, and you dont have to bend over that much to
play your shots, well he never did show.


Yes Jeff, I can appreciate where you are coming from.


Oh Phil, yes we are still mates, as long as I get the yeast, and not that

Subject: false bottom design for RIMs


Steve Lane wrote in about problems with his RIMS false bottom.  I've run a 
few batches thru my RIMS now, so thought I would chime in.  I use a 48 qt. 
ice chest with a copper manifold for the mash tun.  The manifold has four 
1/2" pipes running the length of the cooler with slots cut every 3/8" or so.  
It works ok, but if I could afford it, I would buy a perforated stainless 
false bottom because of the greater open area.  However, this works for now.


I used to stick mashes too, until I added a grant to the setup.  A grant is 
basically a holding tank between the mash tun outlet and the pump inlet.  It 
eliminates the suction from the pump.  The mash drains by gravity into the 
container and then is available to the pump.  All I did to make the grant was 
buy a gallon-size plastic juice jug, add a drain in the bottom and hang it 
below the valve on the mash tun outlet.  The drain is a 1/2" thru-hull 
fitting I got at the marine store.  The jug also has markings on the side so 
I can figure flow rate.  When sparging, I like to drain a quart from the mash 
every 40-60 seconds for 11 gallon batches. 


One more thing.  I used to have a hard time priming the herms pipes when the 
pump was connected directly to the mash tun.  No problem after adding the 
grant.  I have a picture of my RIMS at www.gourmetalaska.com/wsn9B94.html, 
but it was taken before the grant was added.

care to identify the offensive li'l sons o' bitches getting a free ride off
my hop plants.  I invite any myco, micro or xenobiologists on the list to do
the same.


I suppose I should have broke that into a few paragraphs for the likes of
Steve Alexander, but I just kegged up some Big Brew 2000 APA, and a Belgian
White that I will be serving up at the NHC in Livonia later this month, and
am a bit tipsy.  Stop by and say "Hi!"  The first 30 visitors get a free
sample of whatever presumable fungus this turns out to be.

Subject: French Homebrewing


I will shortly be moving from the US to Toulouse in France and am looking for 
any information on homebrewing in France. If anyone has any information on 
homebrew clubs, supplies or French web sites would be appreciated.


Please reply by e mail.


Thanks for any assistance.
