Subject: Mashing specialty grains


Greetings, all.


I just heard something that I've never heard or read before about
mashing, but this guy is adamant about it. He says that specialty
grains, especially crystal and dextrin malt, should not be mashed with
the base malt because  the enzymes will 'destroy' the dextrins, leaving
nothing but fermentable sugars. He claims that this will lead to
overattenuation and thin body. He says if you want to use crystal, then
steep it in the boil kettle.


I've never seen this concept in print, and I've always put all my grain
bill in the mash tun, but I thought I'd present it to the group. What
say you all: Mash 'em all, or separate and steep?




Steve
************************************************
Even as an all-grain brewer I usually add specialty grains to the
mash after I've acheived conversion.  But I've only done this be-
cause I've read that specialty grains, especially crystal and cara-
mel, interfere with the iodine test for starch conversion.  How-
ever, I must admit that my beers seem cleaner and tastier doing
this.  In some cases I even add a few ounces of a specialty grain
(chocolate, black patent or special B) to the top of the grist be-
fore sparging; this seems to add some color and flavor without
roastiness.

Steve Alexander writes about Nathaniel Lansing's odd pH values in a Congress
mash:

This is a great idea! I have an accurate meter and electrode and would like
to participate. ASBC routinely uses multiple labs to repeat their Methods in
order to determine accuracy--IOW, if it cannot be repeated then something's
wrong.


Rather than the usual wrangling that goes on here, those with access to
accurate measuring equipment could easily measure the pH of a clearly
defined Congress Mash to determine whether Nathaniel's measurements were
somehow off, or whether he stumbled across a legitimate anomaly.


This is a very answerable question. Any takers?

Subject: Apologies, Reprimands And Science


First of all I'd like to apologise to Bill X Wible for the rowdy outburst he
received from the HBD Aussie contingent regarding his request for a Fosters
lager recipe. I'm with you Bill, You can go and brew whatever you like for
yourself and your friends. Pay no heed to this undisciplined crowd over
here, they are all going to get their mouths washed out with soap tonight. I
promise!!


And just for this outburst, there'll be nothing but Fosters on tap for the
next two months at the Burradoo Hilton!


Bill, I must say, you hit a sore point. Most Aussies once guzzled Fosters
like there was no tomorrow, a lot still do. Those of us who drifted into
homebrewing realised what a rotten excuse for a beer we had been drinking
and we flew into a rage. Though I have long since risen above this, others
will never forgive. It's just as well those Fosters brothers got out of here
when they did!

No way am I wasting my skunk oil on a Townsvillianite! I've noted an Aussie
HBD'er who is in need of a whiff. Goes by the name of Lyndon Zimmermann and
writes :
>I think the Yanks call it
>skunky but few of us have ever seen or smelt a skunk.


Lyndon, I have here in a little bottle something just for you.


Fred Garvin can't remember his trip to Oz. Well maybe he never got here. I'm
only going on what Jeff Renner told me. It's quite possible the two of them
never got here at all but spent the night on Jeff's porch. I'm not going to
ask any further questions of the night's activities!


But getting back to Calcium Sulphate. Wes Smith got me worried about the
water pH here in the Southern Highlands. And he is right, it sits around a
pH of 8. I tried a bit of Calcium Sulphate in the mash because my new pH
meter was telling me the pH was 5.6. Just a little too high. But I couldn't
get it to drop, so in went a bit more chalk. Still no drop in pH.
about with this again!
In fact I am now using lactic acid to get my brewing water down to about pH
7 before I start the mash. I can just tell by taste that this is going to
add a crispness to my lagers.
Science is a funny thing. It is not a means to an end in itself. It is an
attempt to explain what is going on. Personally, I don't understand any of
it. I'm one of those dumb cruds who thought of little at school beyond
motorbikes and girlfriends. God smiled on me to get me where I am. But I
reckon I've got a feel for this brewing, science or no science.

Subject: Trappist...have I done the right thing?


I brewed a Trappist (wlp500 Whitelabs), and let the 
temperature hover too close to the 65F recommended apex.  Upon 
transfer into the secondary it tasted a bit more yeasty and 
'hefe-like'... that I think can be contributed to the high 
temp in primary...so I let it sit for another day (at around 
65) then decided to crash cool it.  (OG was 1.046, going into 
the secondary it was 1.022  so I wanted to give the yeast a 
day or two to get the gravity down a bit....?) It is now at 
about 50F.  I am hoping that this will floc the yeast 
out...but am undertain if this can deal with the flavor.....


I used:


       3 lb Torrified Barley Flakes
       4.5 lb Halcyon 2 row
       1.0 lb Paul's Dark Crystal
       1.0 lb Belgian Biscuit Malt
       1 cup Special B


2 stage infusion (148F, 158F)


Cascades, then Kent Goldings (all the hops I had)...


    Anyone know if the crashing will help the flavor?

Bill;


  I found your post refreshing in that I too have been trying 
to brew lighter lagers for folks who don't (yet) like darker 
alse and stouts.  Do you have any recipes that came out 
particularly good that you are willing to share?


  I have been experimenting with rice lately (bought a 55lb 
bag of "flaked brown rice") and plan to try more corn brews 
once the huge bag is used up.


  Here is a recipe for a San Francisco Lager that was a hit 
here among the lighter crew (although some found it to be too 
hoppy):
3.5 lb Halcyon
1 lb Crystal
1.5 lb Munich
1 lb Torrified Barley Flakes
2.5 lb Flaked Rice


2 stage infusion (48,58 F)
wlp810 SF Lager Yeast (58-65F)
OG=1.054
FG=1.014
%ABW=4.2




FWH with Cascades
1/2 oz Fuggles `at` 30
same `at` 15


I think that if I were to do this again, I'd put in less 
Cascade (1/2 oz rather than the oz I used) for the lighter 
crew...


Good Brewing!

Steve responds: >>14% increase in certain foam related

 The report shows a 100% increase at 75C. I mentioned this before.
Don't invent false results.


>>The step mash period is unusually lengthy (3.3 hours mash + 1.5 hour
mashout).<<


  The reports mash was 20 minutes for saccharification then a 90 minute
mash out, a 30 minute sampling, 60 minute sampling, and a 90
minute sampling. 


>>"pH adjustment" means controlling the pH to a predetermined value or
range
based on measurement.  It does NOT mean happening upon a reasonable pH
based
on a particular combination of calcium addition, malt and temperature.  <<


  That is simply contradictory. If the ph is adjusted with acid or minerals
or lye
doesn't mean the the ph isn't controlled. 


>>Also a
Congress mash CANNOT include a calcium addition<<


 All I said was "congress mashing equipment was used", it was never
called a congress mash.


>>The paper you cited did add
150ppm calcium ions to the mash water, but was NOT pH adjusted to any
specified value as far as I can tell.<<


 The mineral addition _is_ the adjustment. 150 ppm calcium will yield
a mash of pale malt in distilled water in the normally accepted range.


>>1/ The paper's calcium ions may have been from calcium's sulfate, calcium
hydroxide, calcium bicarbonate or other sources.  <<


 Well duh! of course the results would be different if you use an alkaline
salt as to compared to a neutral salt!

Axe to grind? I had stated a foam (mouth feel) rest will _improve_
foam retention and present a published report from the Beer
research Institute that supports my contention. You still won't accept
the results. The mash pH was adjusted with mineral additions.
The grind would affect only tannin extraction, but that is not the point
of the experiment. It takes only 1/2 hour to get appox. 50% increase
of foam active G-Ps in the sweet wort.

I've been pretty disappointed with the beers available on airlines as well.
Bud and Heineken seem to rule the 'lines I fly - domestic, at least.  On

One concern.  Is all Teflon "food grade"?  I am sure the frying pan
material is but, what about the type used in shrink tubing?  I envy all you
people that can toss around the poly-propolides and butyl-marmalades and
whatever.  It never means anything to me but I know the insiders can tell
everything just from these words, a few winks, and a hand gesture or two.
:-)


The reason I ask is I have been "burned" by Teflon.  The technician that
wired a unit for me used Teflon insulated wire but didn't install it
correctly.  The Teflon "cold flowed" where it contacted some edges and

Subject: Foster's yeast.


I had occassion to chat yesterday with a Weihenstephan grad, sitting on
the porch in the afternoon sun.  In the midst of about 6 Paulaner Weiss
mitt hefen, the somewhat uninteresting title came up.  He had had
previous contact with the brewery in Braunsweig which has the German
Foster's license.


According to him, the yeast both at the German plant, and that sent to
Australia, comes from a yeast bank in England.  It is jealously guarded
by the Foster's folks, and not one millilitre is ever allowed to go out
through the gate.


This is of course, entirely understandable.  To put brewer's yeast in
any kind of wort environment, and have it produce alcohol, without
producing any other flavours whatsoever, is no mean achievement.


The Foster's Frosty of pre-Bond days was quite another thing I would
like to recall, and had a nice little "honey tone" and as all the major
Australian brews since then have gone on to a shocking display of
homogeneity, and flavourlessness (and they usually call them "bitters"?).


These days Fosters is, and should have, gone one step farther in the use
of Nitrogen technology.... rather than using nitrogen gas for head
enhancing qualities, Foster's is served at liquid nitrogen temperatures. 


At any higher temperatures, the ice-cicles on your tonsils are likely to
melt, leaving your taste buds unprotected, and Bazza's famous Manley
Pier chunder will likely ensue, with or without the prawns.


Then again, should one follow the advice re: pitching rates,
hyper-oxegenation, CKT's, lactic acid pH balancing, and the rest often
admonished here, one may be able to achieve this little miracle of
lifelessness and tastelessness one self in your own kitchen.


Don't forget to chill the buggery out of it.

P.S. Yes. After 6 Paulaner mitt hefen, one can still here the sound of
distant thunder rumbleing from my bowels.... could this be the

Peter asks:


"In my experience, they should be able to claim 1F repeatability.  It seems
that when the temperature is changing rapidly, the units seem to update in
two degree increments.  Once things settle down they fluctuate in one degree
increments.  They must have built in some kind of tracking loop that waits
for a 2F change before update during rapid movements."


The reason they go up in 2 deg F intervals is that they are actually working
on the Celsius scale and converting to Fahrenheit (1.8 degrees delta F = 1
degrees delta C) so every once in a while they only jump 1 deg F in order to
"catch up".

Back in 1984, I dug with my pen knife outside of Zatec, and scraped some
Saaz root hunks out of the ground.


Rumour had it that I performed bizarre sexual acts with it at night in
my hotel room until I got it home, but I am here to say that that is
ABSOLUTELY not true, and Phil Yates is still the only one I know who
spills his seed in the garden, amidst visions of long gone movie stars
(stay off the "gold-tops", Phil).


Boy! Not a weed would touch that red clay dirt I transported them home
in for a year (The East Bloc was sort of big into petru-chemicals, is my guess).


The first two years I had it in a sort of shady spot and it did not so
well.  I transplanted it to a southern wall of the house and it took off
like a shot and soon elliminated all the tulips, easter lillies, and the
"lieutenants heart" (I can not possibly find a proper English
translation for that plant) that grew in the vicinity.


It is till doing fine, and I think is quite a hardy thing but does like
MUCH sunlight.... I am living at 60 degrees North, so I would think that
Philadelphia would get a larger proportion.


2 tricks I learned in Czecho. After flowering and harvest, cut the thing
down to about 3 decimeters over the ground.... next spring trim one
decimeter UNDER the ground (whacking the "apical meristems", which is
just a fancy pair of words for "it looks like asparagus tips").


As to ersatzing (ersaazing?) the only other weed I've found that makes a
sort of "poor man's Saaz", is Hallertauer Herzbrucher.... really fairly similar.

Fred (FLJohnson`at`worldnet.att.net) says beer on planes sucks because it's
canned. I agree that canned beer is not usually very high quality. Here in
Canada I've had  Big Rock Traditional from a can on a plane. While Big Rock
from a can isn't as good as from a bottle, it's still a far sight better
than the rest of the offerings.


Related note: sometimes the canned stuff, while not very good, is at least
consistent. For example, try to get a Heineken that isn't skunky in a
bottle. At least the canned stuff is stable.


All in all, I'd rather drink water unless I can get a real beer. Especially
on a plane. So de-hydrating!

Subject: Specialty grain mashing


Perhaps Rich Sieben is correct when he says the fellow who told
Steve....."is a fool"....  But sometimes where there's smoke there's fire.
Some texts (sorry, no references available) do talk of adding specialty
grains very late in the mash, at/during vorlauf and mashout only.  I've done
this as an experiment for my dry stouts, adding the roasted barley or
chocolate malt after conversion during a recirculation and mashout period
only.  Not because of any enzymatic activity but to "smooth out" any
harshness of these grains.  It's only anecdotal, but the resulting beer was
smoother, with less sharp edges than others I've done.   As far as boiling
the grain, I thought what Steve reported was "steeping" the grains in the
kettle; I just don't recall the exact verbiage but I didn't recall anything
about boiling.  But here too there is precedence in the form of boiling
grains during decoctions without tannin extraction.  Here it all depends on
the pH of the boil.  If it's low enough, then boiling the grains doesn't
lead to tannin extraction.   And while I understand the principle behind
having unfermentable dextrins in crystal malt to add flavor, body and
sweetness to the final product, I must admit I don't fully understand why
perhaps a mash doesn't break these down just as proteolytic and diastatic
enzymes do with proteins and sugars.  So maybe he isn't a fool after all,
just that with all this "whisper down the valley" maybe the story has got
changed along the way.

I have no trust that even heat shrunk tubing will reliably prevent water
intrusion.  It might appear like a good fix at first, only to later find out
that water was slowly penetrating and then remaining (trapped) only to cause
more problems.


You might consider a different approach, one that I have used on a plastic
sensor and attached cord.  I simply placed the probe halfway into a foot
long vinyl tube then bent the tube back completely and tie wrapped in a few
places.  Now there is no opening for water to possibly intrude.  You can use
more than a foot of course, depending on how deep you intend to submerge the
probe.

Bob asks about his water, especially regarding a metallic taste,


your Ca and SO4 are pretty low. i guess i'd classify your water as
'soft', at least compared to Toronto H2O. i think it's a good idea to
preboil the H2O primarily to remove the Chlorine but i also find it
'sets' the pH, by causing the carbonate and Ca to react. 


i can't see anything in your water report that would give a metallic
taste to the beer. however, your report seems to be lacking any
information about metals that would cause such a flavor (don't really
know what a metallic aroma is). perhaps you need to have a more
thorough analysis performed. 


bitters, such as those from the Burton area of England, have very high
SO4 levels. you'll need to had quite a bit of SO4 to reach a similar
level. i think i recall them having around 150 mg/L (same as 150 ppm).


i usually adjust my water as it seems to help with the fermentation
(solely empirical observation, i've never done a side by side test
of this).


here's an example from an IPA i made: remember mg/L = ppm (i have a
balance capable of measuring 0.001 grams):


water adjustments:      |Toronto H2O    |[final]
                        |               |
to 14 gal add:          |Ca   36 mg/L   |172 mg/L
0.35 g MgSO4            |SO4  32 mg/L   |150 mg/L
5.9 g CaSO4             |Mg  8.3 mg/L   | 15 mg/L
1.3 g Cacl              |Cl   26 mg/L   | 50 mg/L


the values for Toronto H2 are from the city. [final] is shorthand for
'final concentration'. feel free to check my math and tell me i messed
up!

No, this isn't about that other timer/cooking gizmo(of which I own
and use for my mash - just don't submerse it).  Apparently for the
cost of arm, leg, wheelbarrow, and a truck, you can get an infrared
thermometer from www.jensentools.com.  I just got the new catalog,
saw this nifty device and started thinking about how nice it would
be for taking temperature without having to sanitize yet another
piece of brewing equipment.


Has anyone tried one of these on a liquid?  Did it work?  Was it
accurate?  Will wort transparency/translucense affect the reading?
I'm thinking that since it isn't affected by the air temp. between
it and it's target and since air is transparent, that these might
be factors...


On a somewhat unrelated matter, I am making my own false bottom
for all grain.  I've inverted a #4 gold screen cone coffee filter
and screwed it to a bucket bottom I cut off of another bucket.  I'll
just have to drill a hole for the outlet tube and I'm all set.  It
probably cost more than a surescreen, but the overall area
seems bigger, the geometry will prevent collapse, and it appeals
to my creative side.  I may take some pictures when I'm done and
post to the digest.


Finally, I have tried both sucking and blowing.  When I blew, for
some reason I cannot recall lost the siphon half way through.
Getting it started again was quite difficult once the headspace
was more than about 1 gallon in volume.  Now I suck with a turkey
baster and switch the turkey baster for a short racking cane once
the hose is full.  Couldn't be easier.


FWIW, this digest should be blocked by every paranoid
parental/corporate software known - sucking, blowing, unusual uses
for corn, the burradoo hilton, and to top it all off - balls in
water.  It's a wonder I'm able to receive the digest at all. ;)

    This beer is made in Chambly, Quebec by Unibroue.  They
make a fine line of
Belgian-style beers which are actually /imported/ into
Belgium.  Many of the beers have
a characteristic flavor, reminiscent to me of oranges (but
doesn't taste to me like
corriander or orange peel I have used in my own beers).  In
my conversation with the
distributor, he said the brewers told him that this flavor
is not from the yeast but
from a secret blend of spices, and that the same yeast is
used for all of their beers.
But he knew only what he was told, which became less and
less the more he drank...  My
tasting experiments suggest that the yeast is fairly
moderate and well balanced in
flavor when compared to average Belgian strains, even for
high gravity brews.  The
yeast is also probably fairly tolerant of ethanol.


    I am in the process of purifying the yeast from the a
bottle of Trois Pistoles,
another beer in their line, so I have yet to put it through
its paces.  I believe Steve
Alexander mentioned that he has used this yeast before, so

Subject: Sulfur


The amount of sulfur depends on many factors, most important grain and
yeast. Sulfur is characteristic of high gravity brewing, actually
unavoidable.


More likely is your yeast.  Sometimes yeast metabolism shifts during
fermentation and you'll observe a high level of sulfur production.  In many
cases the sulfur will dissipate or be reabsorbed by the yeast.


If you notice sulfur flavor and aroma at unpleasant levels in you beer
close to the end of fermentation, hold your temp at 60 degrees F, if
possible (50 degrees for a lager).  This is what is called a sulfur rest. 
Many people in the industry use this trick.


All it does is trick the yeast into "thinking" that something is happening
or going to happen.  Many precursors for division contain a lot of sulfur. 
The yeast with then suck it up to "get ready"
