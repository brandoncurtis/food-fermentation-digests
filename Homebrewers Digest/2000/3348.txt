Greetings.


Forgive me if this has already been mentioned, but in case it hasn't, I've
found the Beer Recipator spreadsheet http://hbd.org/recipator to be
extremely helpful to me, a novice "recipe formulator".  It's been very
accurate with my brewing setup (5-gal-extract-back-yard-propane-burner...).
It's easy to fiddle with different ingredients and amounts, and it figures
gravity, IBUs, volume adjustments, extract efficiency, etc.  The beers that
I've made with the Recipator have been some of my best.  Check it out!!!

Subject: pH meter arcana


I meant to comment on the pH meter - conductivity question yesterday but
was so wrapped up in cleaning up after myself that I forgot. What the pH
meter does is develop a voltage across a thin glass membrane which
voltage is dependent upon the difference in hydrogen ion concentrations
on the two sides. The membrane is formed into a bulb and the bulb filled
with a solution at a particular pH. The "hot" electrode is in this
solution. The outside of the bulb is the other side of the membrane and
its potential must be conveyed to the "neutral" side of the meterting
circuit. This is accomplished via the "reference" electrode which sits
in the solution being tested. The connection between the outside of the
bulb and the reference electrode is through the solution itself so while
the electrode does not measure the conductivity of the solution , finite
conductivity is required of it. While they are extremely minute,
currents must flow through the solution. If the solution is pure water,
the conductivity is extremely low and some meters have difficulty
obtaining stable readings. This situation is remedied by adding an "ion
strength adjustor" which is a neutral salt chosen to enhance
conductivity without changing pH. Calibration is done using special
buffers which contain the ISE.

Subject: Competition Announcement!!


Hear Ye, Hear Ye,


Beer and Sweat, Cincinnati's premier homebrew competition operated by
the Bloatarian Brewing League is coming August 19th. What is Beer and
Sweat? It is (to my limited knowlege) the nation's only "keg only"
homebrew competition. Entries can be in corny kegs, sankey type kegs,
party pigs, mini-kegs, even 2 liters with carbonator caps. If you have
some other draft system then enter the beer and bring it on down to the
competition.  Last year we had 114 homebrew entries with Mark Irwin of
SODZ in Columbus, OH taking the BOS prize. In addition to the homebrew
side we also have "King of the Queen City" which is a friendly
competition for professional brewers that are located or distribute to
the Ohio Valley region around Cincinnati. Last year Miami Trails Brewing
beat out hometown favorite BarrelHouse as well as Hoster's (Columbus),
Watson Brothers (Cincinnati), and Great Lakes Brewing (Cleveland) for
the gold. There are great raffle prizes and entertainment to keep things
hopping well into the night. Beer and Sweat is held at the Howard
Johnson Hotel in Sharonville Ohio (just north of Cincinnati) and we do
have rooms blocked off for those with long drives and/or those with the
intention of imbibing a little to much. So, if you are a homebrewer in
the region (OH, KY, IN, MI, WV, VA, MO, TN) and want to have a great
time, fire up that kettle, brew your best beer (because competition is
steep) and bring it on over August 19th. Entries will only be accepted
if they are pre-registered. To register and find out more, visit
www.hbd.org/bloat. If you would like to judge, you can register on the
web site as well.  If you have any questions please e-mail me at
erictepe`at`fuse.net.

Subject: yeast identities sought


I was on the Wyeast web-page and noticed a few strains that were new and
interesting to me, and I was wondering if anyone could comment on their
personal experience using the yeast, or knew something about their origins.


1010 american wheat yeast - A dry fermenting, true top cropping yeast which
produces a dry, slightly tart, crisp beer, in American hefeweisen style.
Flocculation low, apparent attenuation 74-78%. (58-74o F). Could this be
the strain Widmer uses?


1099 Whitbread ale yeast ( Not 1098 British ale yeast from whitbread) -A
mildly malty and slightly fruity fermentation profile; not as tart and dry
as 1098 and much more flocculant. Clears well without filtration.
Flocculation high; apparent attenuation 68-72%. (64-75o F)  Obviously,
Whitbread origin. Has anyone tried it? How is it?


1318 London Ale yeast III - From traditional London brewery with great malt
and hop profile. True top cropping strain, fruity, very light, soft
balanced palate, finishes slightly sweet. Flocculation - high; apparent
attenuation 71-75%. (64-74o F).  This one really sounds appealing to me
because of the top-cropping. I use Samuel Smith's yeast often, which is a
top cropper, and would like to try something new for a change, but still go
with a top-cropper. The description of this really sounds good. I would
really like to know where this one came from.


3638 bavarian wheat yeast - Top cropping hefeweisen yeast with complex
flavor and aroma. Balance of banana and bubble gum esters with lichi and
apple/plum esters and cloveness. Flocculation low; apparent attenuation
70-76%. (64-75o F)
Hefe-weizen is another style I really like and have brewed many times, and
with many different strains.  My favorites over the years have been Brewtek
CL 92 German Wheat, YeastLabs W51 (I think), and the weizen yeast from
Whitelabs. This new one really sounds interesting too. Anyone know of it's
origins? TIA.

Subject: Filtering


I have came to the conclusion I will have to filter my beer. I have
tried finings etc. Could I have suggestions as to the best ways to
mechanicaly or chemicaly to do this. I am toying with the idea in using
air induced into the wurt after fermentation to act as a defloculator
what do you think. Any suggestion would be appreciated. My brewing is by
Rims.

Yeast ranch, that is!


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Well, it's been five days. Time for a check on the ranch and to bring the
wort volume up a bit. 


Inspection shows that "Mystery Lager" and "Belgian Abbey" have joined the
dark side. The flasks contining these samples were inhabited by a couple
of nasty slime molds. Ah, well: I guess one should expect such things from
stuff stored in the bottom of the refrigerator for four years.
Disconcerting, still, since the slants were sealed and all. My aseptic
technique failed me at one end of the process or the other. Probably the
cleaning/sanitition of the slant mouth at transfer into the flask, but
who knows.


St. Louis Lager, Irish Ale, Orval and Bavarian Lager are each showing some
sediment. The control is clear. Each flask, including the control, were
brought up to 30 ml with oxygenated wort from an autoclaved starter.


The saga continues...

Very possible. Molson's merged with the Fosters Brewing Group in 1989, then 
subsequently formed an alliance with Miller Brewing Co. in '93.


However, in '97 Molson Companies and Foster's Brewing Group bought back the 
20% of Molson Breweries owned by Miller Brewing Co. This effectively allowed 
Molson Breweries 50% of Molson Companies and 50% of Fosters Brewing.


Then in '98 The Molson Companies bought back the 50% of Molson Breweries owned 
by Foster's Brewing.


Having said all that, I believe that the Fosters available here (Canada) is 
domestic.

This is Steve speculating and rumour mongering as per usual and it is an
entirely unfounded one.


Actually, I'm a Mycoethologist.


I'm surprised at Richard for supporting this nonsense with the tale of
the transplant. It was his Bock that put me in the carving mood, and I
was really only going to show a "neat trick" that he could show-off next
time he was at the Ashram.


I wasn't that concerned about Ziggy's tissue type, as I've found a
"Cream Ale Infusion" does a good job of preventing transplant rejection
(I think it's the Nitrogen).


Besides, I'm really quite sure you could use a new one, Richard.

Sounds like a reasonable, no an inevitable plan. Last year a lot of us wrote
the HBD initials on our name tags to make it easy to recognize each other.
That's simple and we can certainly do it again. Since you're more or less

Hey Dave:


I've taken you up on the experiment, but the beers aren't
done yet.  Since Jeff Renner now has me addicted to
producing a good CAP (can I get a link for the Ayinger
yeast?) I made one a few months ago.  First it was good,
then it was great, then it went straight to hell.  The
staling process was about as subtle as jumping off a cliff.
Since I made special care to avoid wort splashing (y'all
have me paranoid) I might be willing to attribute it to your
thoughts.  Soooooo...


I brewed another CAP at the beginning of May, but this time
had the kettle covered with the lid held open about 2" with
a wooden spoon.  I can say that I noticed a stronger boil
with less evaporation.  Wound up with more beer than I
expected.  I just gave it a diacetyl rest (whether it needed
it or not) and plan to rack to the keg next week.  I'll give
the final report in August.


Cheers!
Marc

year I ran across a book on companion planting that suggested planting garlic 
between the other plants.  Did that last year and no sign of the nasty little 
buggers at all.  Just pick up a head at the local grocery store, break out the 
cloves, soak them in water for a few days, then plant the ones that look like 
they're developing roots.

Dan, ballparking it -  for glucose, complete combustion produces about 700
kcal/mole which is 180 grams. This gives about 3900 kcal/kg for glucose so
the closer, and probably correct, value is the MBAA figure. It is much less
than the figure for the complete combustion because the yeast are not taking
the sugars all the way down to CO2 (they stop at ethanol) and are also not
releasing all the liberated energy as heat (some is trapped in chemical
bonds in the compounds in the yeast cells).


If, as seems likely,  the MBAA value is correct then it works out to a
potential total temp. increase of about 15 degC for a 5 gallon batch having
10% fermentable sugar by weight which sounds close to the 10dgeC value I've
heard bantied about in the past...

I'm brewing a fruit weizen beer for the summer and I'm using the Oregon

Cherry in 5 and Raspberry in 5 (in the secondary).


According to the labels, the Cherry puree (95 per serving, 11 servings
per can) has 1045 calories and 132 grams of sugar, and the Raspberry
puree (45 per serving, 12 servings per can) has 540 calories and 108

like to know the number of gravity points that each will contribute,
either the total per can or the points per gallon for 5 gallons.

Yes, but I'm wondering about HSA during a roiling boil (100+ degC) where the
solubility is pretty much zero.
I'm not so much concerned with the oxidation that occurs before this. Yes, I
do believe the evidence that it occurs is convincing but I have already
taken all reasonable steps that I can, within the limitations of my set-up,
to minimize this. It is just that I have recently moved to outdoor boiling
and am wondering whether or not I should take pains to limit air exposure to

I think the situation with the Bushwick pilsners was a pretty unusual one,
and Aaron's grandfather chose a pretty good favorite, and a good one for
cloning.  These were some very characterful American pilsners for their
times (late 40's through 50's), when most US beers were wimping out.  They
had respectable hopping levels in the mid to upper 20s.


Just this week I got three more unsolicited fan emails for CAP from HBD

Jeff,


I will always bow to your expertise on all matters related to beer.  I
am not sure that we are talking about the same beer, though.  Your
explanation has this critical phrase: "These were some very characterful
American pilsners for their times (late 40's through 50's), when most US
beers were wimping out."


Aaron's grandfather probably drank that version, but it is a little
before my time.  I started drinking beer in the mid 60s, and I suspect
the wimpout effect, like an eclipse of the sun, had already reached
totality.


As a clue to what I drank, I offer the Schaefer Jingle, which I heard so
often it is still stuck in my head (with perhaps a few minor errors), lo
these many years later:


Schaefer is the one beer to have
When you're having more than one.
Schaefer's flavor doesn't fade
Even when your thirst is done.
The most rewarding pleasure (?) in this man's world
For people who are having fun.
Schaefer is the one beer to have
When you're having more than one.


Now, it seems to me that they were marketing themselves as the world's
first light beer.


The point of my message is that we who were introduced to beer drinking
in the 60's and 70's didn't know what we were doing, and we didn't know
that we didn't know.  I went to college with a large number of people
who considered themselves experts on beer flavor (and of course, I did,
too), but we had no way of knowing what the possibilities were.  German,
Czech, British, Belgian, Irish--none of us had access to them.  We
thought all beer was a variation of the Bud experience, and we very
sophisticatedly picked our favorites from among that lot.


A true CAP?  I don't think I have ever had one, and we are reaching the
point where only a relatively small and dwindling portion of our
population has.  I would love to try one of yours some day.

Subject: HSA experiment






Hello all,


        Steve Alexander makes a number of good points about the
proposed HSA experiment.  I'll include more of Steve's text than I
would normally, because I'd like to respond to several points.


My earlier post (volunteering to conduct the experiment)--:
>>So, in short, I'm volunteering .....
>> _IF_ he and Dr. Pivo can agree to rule out any stakes, both
>>personal and monetary.


Steve's response:
>I understand and appreciate your point, but the idea of a bet
>wasn't mine.  Dr.Pivo/Jeff Irvine offered a bet as a
>direct and insulting attack on my character (here's how to cure
>naysayers who lack conviction on their statements).  As usual
>he has misread me.


        Okay, I can't argue with this, but I'd prefer, in general, 
that we avoid such personal attacks in the HBD, and  I'd certainly
prefer, in this case, not to get in the middle of a personal argument.


        Again, I'm quite willing to conduct the proposed experiment,
and I have some responses to Steve's suggestions about it.


My earlier suggestion:
>>I might also suggest that the beers be bottle-conditioned,
>>in an effort to minimize cold side aeration effects.


Steve's response:
>Since I've only tasted the HSA in kegged beers I'd have to
>say no.  Removing bottle O2 is good for this test,  but the
>yeast also act as a reducing agent against other oxidation
>processes - including possibly the lipid oxidation (w/o free
>O2) that I expect to see in the HSA beer (see above).  Also
>there is the potential problem of yeast autolysis over an
>extended period.  It would be an interesting experiment, but ..


        I think that autolysis is unlikely to be a problem, but
the other factor Steve raises is a good point.  However, I'm not
convinced that counter-pressure bottling from a keg is a good
option for this sort of experiment.  CP filling is _very_ dependent
on the skill of the bottler to avoid cold side O_2 problems, which
might mask and/or mascarade as HSA symptoms.


Steve A:
>As to the real issue (HSA) I would like to see the experiment
>carried out regardless, *BUT* most folks forget is that there
>is good deal of time and effort and expense involved.


My earlier post:
>>brew 20 gallons of a nice lager [...]  always a fun
>>thing.


Steve:
>Not all fun. Gottta cold store it for perhaps a year using 20gal-years
>of fridge capacity.  At 20gal there will be none to share or sample
>except at tastings. Then there is the recordkeeping and the guy
>who pours the triangle samples can't taste.  Nice for the tasters,
>not so nice for the fridge owner and recordkeeper/pourer.


        My personal view of the experiment was roughly this:  brew
two 10 gallon batches of a malty, reasonably dark lager (O'fest or
Vienna,) with identical yeast starters, fermented under as close
to identical conditions as possible, where one batch was aerated with
pure O_2 in the mash (and boil?) while the other was kept as oxygen-free
as possible during wort production.  After suitable lagering, bottle
5 gallons of each, keg 5 gallons of each.  After, say, 3 months, send
6-8 bottles of each to an agreed on homebrew club to do a triangle
test.  Same at 5, 7, 9, 11 months (other HB clubs.)  At, say, 9 months, 
the kegs would be tapped at some HB club meeting to do a similar
triangle 
test, with a wider array of judges than the bottle tests.


        One reason for shipping the bottles to several locations is to
expose them to a bit of rough handling (which should help bring any HSA
effects to the surface.)


        I welcome any comments.  I'll be away for a week or two, and I
look forward to reading responses when I return.  Be gentle....

Thanks for that insight, John.  Never looked at it that way.
I guess you're saying it's like one of us thinking "I'd like to build a
TV like dad used to watch - with tubes, rabbit ears, and a UHF
converter, just to see what it was like."  when we now have
digital flat screen TV's with cable and satellite hookups.


Still, I think there is something to be said for the experience, and
for not letting these old styles of beer die.


Pre-prohibition lager seems to be a style that is gaining in popularity.
At the Buzz Off competion that was just held in this area, the american
lagers category had nothing entered but Pre-Prohibition Lagers.  (CAP's).


Mild Ale is a style that is losing market share and popularity every
day to the point that I hear it is even difficult to find in the UK.   I'm
not sure why it is declining or why there is not a version of it available
in the US (at least that I have seen.)  What I read lists several reasons,
such as a bad PR image, and people's mistaken belief that all dark
beers are necessarily bitter or bad tasting.  I think it would be a complete
shame if that style went away.


Cask ales are also all but gone, lost to nitrogen pressurized cans -
another new 'fad'.


I wouldn't want to see CAP, Mild, or any of these old styles lost to
history, just because something else is the latest 'hot' trend.

Subject: HSA


It has finally occurred to me why some Home Brewers are worried about HSA. 
"You don't make good tasting beer" In other words, "Your beer ain't worth 
drinking". The reason I say this is because they are worried about what 
effect HSA will have on their beer months down the road. In Stephen 
Alexander's case he is worried what his beer will taste like a year after 
it's brewed. He must clone Bud. I guess if my beer lasted that long it may 
be affected by HSA also. Here in Millsap we have lots of Good O Boys and 
they like their beer, especially if someone else is providing it. As soon 
as I fire up my kettle and the smell of the sweet wort hits the air they 
start arriving. By the time the beer has finished fermenting, the barns are 
full and the overflow is camping out around the stock tanks. Hell, the cows 
won't even come up for feed. They are afraid that some of the boys have 
been away from town too long. Some of the cows are good looking now that I 
think about it. Anyway, by the time I get the beer keged and forced 
carbonated, there is a party going on. By feeding time the next morning 
everyone is gone and all the beer is too. So if you make beer that taste 
good, or if you have a dozen or so love starved cowboys and some good 
looking cows, you don't have to worry about the problem of the long termed 
effect that HSA may or may not have on your beer.

When I was at Seibels and also I believe kunze states that a mash out is
really unneccessary.  If (and only if) one lets the mash go to completion
then it really should not matter if one mashes out since all the
convetable starch ahs been attack by the alpha-amylse during the final
mash step.  Also it has been suggest that mashout is a bad idea since one
wants some residual amylase activty present in case unconverted starch is
released during sparging.  As I recall mashout simple reduces the mash
viscousity due to heat and thus makes sparging more efficient.  Something
homebrewers don't really need to be concerned with unless they want to.
dr pivo and before him, jack s made a point of telling us not to buy into
everything the big guys do.  just my opinion.

should be a Dynamite event.  Web info is in the HBD banner.


Since Zymurgy never asked me, I'll have to say it here: 
THIS is why I brew.  I want to show off my best stuff to 
people whose respect I crave.  And while I'm at it, I'd 
love to see who can put something up next to my smoked 
salmon (Mark Tumarkin is puttin up a bunch of Mustard, 
and I'm bringing a bunch of Renner's bread, which may 
be better than his beer) . I am dying to see who 
brings what to the Hutzpah-tality Sweet, and just to see 
a bunch of folks I just never see anywhere else.


I don't brew to be better than anybody else.  I don't brew to 
learn chemistry or to learn history (although I have learned a bit, 
and I have liked it).  I brew to have something I'm proud of to
share with my friends.  I am looking forward to sharing things I
am proud of, and I'm also looking forward to having more friends 
when it's over than I have today (although based on how much 
work I got them into, there are some guys from the AABG who 
would probably like to have my hide right now).


I hope to see you there.
