Brewsters,
  Keith Menafy asked if anybody has malted corn.
 After the corn is malted, and it's time for mashing,
does anyone know what temperatures it would take for
conversion of starches to sugars in the corn-malt?
 Different than Barley, probably higher? Just curious.

Nathaniel P. Lansing re Subject: advice or opinion


>frequently, 1 time a week perhaps, a new brewer asks
>about how to improve his all-grain efficiency. [...]


The cost of the lost efficiency is very low on HB scale
and that over extracted mash bills produce inferior beers.


Channeling and quick sparge is often an issue. No-mashout's
lower temps exacerbate the quick sparge problem but does not
cause it.


Mashout is according to [M&BS pp 293, Shur, Pfenniger,
L.Narziss, EBC 14th Cong, p149, Envoldsen, JIB 80,
p520] and a lot of others unlikely to be responsible for a
newbies 20%-35% extraction shortfall.  I'd tell them that too
if they asked.


>Any *harm? no. Any help? doubtful.


My comments about no-mashout were not aimed at newbies with
extraction problems as Del well knows.


==


>Steve maybe didn't understand my post on dextrinization ...
I frequently fail to understand posts with premises that  violates
every text on enzyme kinetics.  It's in error.


Mashout/foam -


Let's cut this short.  The discussion has progressed nowhere since
Del objected to my observations in March.  He continues to
regularly mischaracterize my posts as in #3277, #3282,
#3285, #3287 and others and refuse to divulge basic info or
answer my requests for clarification of the paper on which he
bases his argument.


This is my last post on the topic.  I'm with Huber Hanghofer. There are
other factors beyond mashout involved.  Del ignores this.


>I extrapolated nothing.
Del in #3300
Steve>>missing is support for the claim the mashout temps
            (76+C) are NECESSARY for adequate foam.<<
Del>> [...]  What you say may be 'adequate' foam without mash-out your
          pro-lit says will see foam positive effects at 72C mash-out temps;
          supporting my allegations.
That is extrapolation plain and simple.  He assumes the applicability of the
experimental result to differing conditions.


>My very first statement still stands, a mash out at 71C+ improves head
>retention. You are trying very hard to explain that away but [...]


No I am not explaining it away, I am trying to get YOU to add proper
context. It is NOT an experiment of MASHOUT and no one does a
90'`at`75C mashout, also other conditions differ from conventional mashes.




>Nope, let me quote Tom Flores, [...]
It is Del's misunderstanding of the term "optimal" that causes
confusion I think.  I don't disagree w/ Mr.Flora's comments.


> Mash-out is raising the saccharification temperature, for what
>ever end result the brewer desires.
So 60C to 70C is mashout - get real.


>._And_if mash-out is so inconsequential; how come you can find so
>many references of what the temperature should be?
Commercial brewers want the extra 2%-5% extraction
and faster lauter.


>Measured CPF of sweet wort, CPF and adhesion in finish beer in commercial
>sized trials.
Did they also mash the for 20'`at`60C+90'`at`75C  vs 20'`at`60C+90'`at`68C.
HOW did they control for the dextrins and ethanol which have foam impact ?
Without control it says little.


>Now you agree the 150 mg/L Ca++ adjusts the pH.  5.5 is not that atypical,
You are *assuming* that the experiment achieved the same pH.  We don't
know that, not the impact of pH diffs.


>OK, first order kinetics would have the reaction rate slower at

Unless water is a reactant as in hydrolase activity, then it could
increase or decrease the rate. Same with pH impact.


===

No , but  I especially like his judicious opinion
HH<<My humble opinion:  Such a rest may or may not have an effect
         on your brew, though the effect  may be very significant! -- Like
         everything protein-related, it much  depends on the quality of
          your malt.>>
Exactly my point tho' I could add to the list of variables. You can't say
mashout *will* improve this beer without understanding much more of the
issue, Del.


====


>  I_extrapolated_nothing_.
It's NOT a study of MASHOUT.  That is the first extrapolation.


>You said the pH was unadjusted, the grist/water ratio is not normal, the
>grind was atypical. So you did try to refute the findings of the Inst.


How illogical.  The experimental methods, as described by Del, follows
Congress methods and so are unlike conventional brewing in several
ways. To reiterate this fact does not dispute the study and particularly
says nothing at all of the "findings".


>If congress mashes are so irrelevant ...
Congress mashes for malt analysis can *only* be validly used to
compare malts analyzed under like conditions They CANNOT
be used to directly compare to actual brewing conditions. You'll
find a similar statement in several books on the subject.




>>>>4/ I am NOT an advocate of no-mashout brewing in general, despite the
>   mischaracterization.<<
Del posted:
>from #3273...
>>The problem with no-mashout is not that the average extraction

>[...]


Del MISQUOTED me. In #3273 I ACTUALLY wrote


>>IMO mashout *does* significantly improve the consistency of the
>>extraction, but 4 times out of 5 the actual extraction change is quite
>>[...]




>I see you don't specifically denounce "mash out"
In fact I advocate mashout for it's consistency in the actual quote.
Something Del has repeatedly misstated.


===
>So which is it? significant or quite small?
The range of diff values was large compared to the small standard
deviation.  Why is that so hard to understand ?
===


>The fallacy in your experiment
Experiments don't have "fallacies".


>is you altered a second
>parameter, the lauter rate. If all parameters were kept the same


You often cannot keep all the parameters the same.  If
you don't alter the lauter rate you WILL alter the wort
extraction.  Find a book on experiment design -
you're in the weeds.


>there would be some validity to your conclusion.
What conclusion ? I merely have stated that I have gotten
entirely normal head without mashout as an observation.
You have objected to this on the basis that the foam may be
adequate but would be improved with mashout. Something
you cannot know except by extrapolation.


===


>I will be posting the results of another mash experiment
>[...]
> The only variable is one was not  mashed out.
>
>If there are any falacies in this let me know [...]


There is so much wrong here it is beyond serious
consideration.  How about getting some background
and an unbiased experimenter.


===


Sincerely best of luck Del.  Maybe I can buy you a beer next
time I'm in the 'burgh and we can talk about something other
than foam.  This discussion is going nowhere fast and I'm
outta here.,

Subject: Fermenting in Cornies


G'day All


To all those who have it happen to you, I now know how you feel being cut
off or cut all together off the HBD.  Must keep the topic beer related and
not drift off to thoughts of football and other areas (even though I see
football quite beer related) or this one wont make it either.  Thank god I
wasn't thinking about other night time activities at the time or I would
have been black banned.


Back to Beer.  Just to give an idea on fermenting in soda kegs, I do
something very similar to take advantage of the SS, and the room saving in
the fermentation fridge. I brew 38 litre (10 gallon to the heathens).  I use
two 22 litre soda kegs (if your maths are up to date thats 18 litres per
keg) as my fermenters.  This gives me the necessary head space, but I
modifly the kegs differently.


I remove all the gear, valves, dip tube, ect.  I plug these holes up with
silicone, (one I have already welded up as well), leaving just the lid hole.
Now I attach a tap right at the bottom of the keg, and there you have it, my
fermenter.  The lid is a plate of glass that just sits on top of the
opening, nothing more.  This way you can look at your beer fermenting
without lifting the lid.


"But its not Air tight"  will be the cry.  Yes that right, but does it need
to be.  The keg will be in the fridge, which is a sealed unit.  Also the
fridge will lower the humidity right down.  End result, the risk of
contamination is no greater than any other fermenter. (are petre dishes air
tight).  As scientific as this statement is (wait for the flames) used this
method for now 4 years, haven't had a bad batch yet.  Its been so
successful, its gaining popularity throughout our homebrew club.


Other advantages of this, easy to move, and you can skim your beers if you
so desire.


I have pictures of this set up, but no web site.  Anyone wanting photos of
this I am more than happy to E-mail them to you.

Stephen Michalak to be exact.  It is a name that's much more appropriate
than Dr. Budwiper.  As a moniker applied by someone who was there, I'm
surprised. The man barely had time to have lunch with us because a core
group of non-St. Louis brewers were on him like stink on sh*t.  You'd think
it was the second coming or something.

Subject: Re: Hazelnut


Mark T reflects on old Hazelnut brews.


HA! I too was bitten by the Sam Adams Longshot Beers. My first all-grain ever
was a clone I called Frogshot Hazelnut. To further complicate the issue I
created this brew at my Aunt and Uncle's new house. He is a wine maker after-all
and they have to be used to the mess. (yea right. Now I know why the winery and
lab are in the basement. Its not so that he could get the temperature and
humidity control like I thought. Its to get it as far out of the kitchen as
possible!!!) Lesson learned: Don't make beer in other peoples new kitchens! Your
in deep deep water even if you don't boil-over!


My disaster was leaving my corona mill at home. We drove around for an hour to 2
different shops and neither had a mill or one for sale. I tried the coffee
grinder, the blender, the quisanart, the mixer and finally the rolling pin and a
garbage bag, the rolling pin and a ziplock and then the rolling pin and my
pillowcase. Two hours later I had hand crushed 10lbs of grain. What a PITA! I
haven't used a rolling pin since. For grain crushing anyway.


I too decided that the Hazelnut was too overpowering. But since my uncle had a
wine lab I got out the graduated cylinders and a pipette and went about it very
scientifically. I use three different people besides myself as a taste panel and
used Goose Island Brown Ale as the test beer. What did they all settle on? What
did all the #crunching come up with. Exactly 1 oz of extract in a 5 gal batch.
All that work just to cut the recipe amount in half!


The brew went well, especially for a first all-grain, but then again those were
the days when I wrote out 45 point instructions lists to tell me exactly when
and what to do. Very anal retentive, but also very helpful for beginners. I had
a floating thermometer, my uncle got out his pH meter and did the adjusting of
the sparge water for me. He also got out his sucrose calibrated hand
refractometer that wasn't the least bit accurate, Still haven't figured out that
one yet. But it went well. No boilovers, extract was 65% abysmal but better than
I feared from my lousy crush. I had a few drips from a leaky spigot, but I
managed to keep most of the wort off the floor and stove.


I just moved out of my first house and tomorrow I get to move into the new one.
Among the bottles of Vintage beers I found was a 22oz bomber of Frogshot
Hazelnut, complete with the original label taped to the bottle. Mark, ill bring
mine if you bring yours!!!!!


I hope to see you all at MIY2K next week!!! PS. Anybody who wants to help move
me in on Saturday is welcome to come over and preview the beers Ill be taking to
the conference!

How fortuitous, you caught the recipe  digest #3352 right? Look anything
close to your recipe? If you use North American 2 row with a diastatic
power of 110-120 you will be OK. _Sometimes_the continental 2 rows,
at <80 DP, just don't have the strength to convert the corn grits, it
depends
on the temperatures/times of your mash program. At a 
DP of 110-120 the N. American malt can easily handle 30% adjuncts.
And don't be afraid of the sugar addition to the boil, it seems to add
the "certain something" that makes an IPA an IPA.


 ....................................
re: Polyclar, There are many grades, A, AT, V, and VT, and more. Some must
be filtered, some do not need filtering. Polyclar A, most commonly
available
does not require filtering. Polyclar A is no longer produced but its'
replacement will also not require filtering. The difference in the
formulations
is only a matter of particle size, the larger particle sizes settle
rapidly, the
submicron sizes do not settle, work more rapidly and require filtering.
To utilize Polyclar to its' fullest it must be in suspension, which means
stirring it to resuspend it at least once a day. It won't do any good
resting
on the bottom of  the carboy. Rumour has it that Polyclar fits into German
Rheinheitsgebot (sp?) because after filtration there is zero (nada) added
to the beer. Excessive amounts will remove hop bitterness, follow the label
directions as to dosage.

Subject: Mulberry/Split Batch


Steve Lane asks about mulberries in beer. I'm in the process of making a
sour mulberry beer. It started out as an Alt, but I used pilsner yeast to
ferment it. I then let it sit until bright. I then racked 4 gallons on top
of 12 lbs of mulberrys from last springs harvest. After about 2 weeks, I
racked the brew off into a five gallon carboy. Several weeks later, I
pitched a starter of Brettanomyces lambicus and added a quart of 1090 tripel
wort, already fermenting with chimay yeast, to the fermenter for food. Next
step is to rack it on top of this years mulberry crop. I've already
collected about 12 lbs this season (4 lbs fit in a gallon zip lock - I've
got 3 gallons in the freezer). I think this time I'll let the fruit remain
in contact with the beer much longer and let the brett yeast have it's way.
It's interesting so far, with slight sour/pie characteristics.


To harvest, I lay a sheet on the ground under a heavy loaded branch and
shake it to drop the berrys. I do this every two/three days.


I've also made a mulberry mead - very dry, and a mulberry cider - 4 lbs in 3
gallons of fresh cider. I didn't use the best yeast on the cider and it has
a sulfur character that some people (Shill) can't seem to get past.

Hodgson Mills Stone Ground Whole Corn was used. No problems with head from oils.


BTW, the tripel wort was boiled down to 3 gallons of 1090 wort (with a
slight addition of cane sugar) and fermented with chimay yeast. It is
fantastic and ready to bottle. I did this trick of "stealing" several
gallons of first runnings to make a strong beer on several batches this
spring - all strong belgians (chimay yeast in the hous'). Just boost the
grain bill a bit to compensate. Another good trick is to keep the dark
specialty grains out of the mash until sparge time. This way they don't
overpower the first wort.


Also BTW, my BOS CAP was filled straight from the cobra tap the morning of
the comp after being force carbonated the night before. Other than cold
bottles, no special precautions were taken.

Subject: Liquid vs. dry yeast (for newbies)




In Roger's response to Clark on hop & trub removal, he said to make sure
you're pitching enough yeast; and that beginners could use dry yeast
to accomplish this.


What's the deal with liquid vs. dry yeast?  I've read that liquid yeasts
are pure strains and produce better beer.  So, for my first batch (brown
ale), I pitched White Labs liquid yeast directly into the primary and
it came out fine (it still hasn't carbonated after 2 1/2 weeks, but the
fermentation was complete, there's a little sediment in the bottles and
I remain optimistic).  I have a batch of cream ale in the works now that
I used Wyeast -- pitched with no starter.  I racked it to a secondary
last night, and it was well fermented.  The Wyeast directions said you
should prepare a starter if the recipe's O.G. is over 1.060 (or something
like that).


Should I be using dry yeast until I'm to a point where I don't mind the
added complexity of preparing starters?  The directions on the liquid
yeasts make it sound like you don't need to step it up unless your making
heavy beers.  Is that true?


What's a newbie to do?

This puzzles me.  Wahl and Henius clearly define both Cream Ale and
Sparkling Ale as *top* fermented beers.  They were roughly analogous to the
lagers of the time, with the notable exception of pitching yeast and ferment
regime.  The fact that Hudpohl and Gennessee saw fit to use bottom yeasts in
their post WWII incarnations doesn't render the earlier history
insignificant.


I am of the opinion that Cream Ales are a true American style, with
similarities to other blonde ales of endemic origins (e.g., Koelsch,
Adelaide Sparkling) and are most accurately represented by using top
fermenting yeast.  The style name, Cream ALE, would tend to support this.
Note I dont mean to disuade anyone from making cream ales however they like,
its just that as somewhat of a histrorical beer fan, I think its worth
pointing out that  the orginal Cream Ales were clearly ales.


Jeff Renner and I both gave editorial comments to Ben Jankowski's article on
Cream Ale in BT, and in addition to his suggestions for low levels of corn
in the mash (we suggested  something more like 20-25%), I also strongly
urged those wishing a more original form to eschew the use of lager yeasts,
and instead rely on the "lagering in the chip tanks" to mellow the esters
and crispen the beer. If others think differently, I think that's probably a
good thing.  Total agreement about anything scary.

Subject: Ferm. in cornies ?'s


"Mark Tumarkin" asks about fermenting in cornies.
I've been doing this for awhile now and the way I started was to just do
2ndary in the cornie. I do 15 gal batches (20 gal brew pot) so the wort
went into 3 - 6 gal carboys. After primary, I racked into 3 cornies
using a connector on the dip tube side into a CO2 purged keg. With the
connector on the end of the racking cane hose, it's easy to start the
siphon. Push sanitizer through the assembly from one of the kegs that
will be your 2ndary. Remove when the hose is full, then put the cane
into the carboy, drain out the sanitizer into a glass and your siphon is
started when you put the connector onto the keg (2ndary). You need
little head space in 2ndary and you get to watch primary in the carboy.
No need to cut off the dip tube as there is little yeast in 2ndary.
I now do primary in 10 gal cornies (good luck finding then) and I did
cut about an inch off the dip tube. Transfer is much easier. Just use a
short patch hose from dip tube side to dip tube side. No lifting of
carboys for siphoning. Works great.
Good luck and private email for more ?'s is fine.

I know my yeast sediment ain't green! It's a good story and probably
true - 
but if a brewery is going to shorten lagering times like that, then they
would have to filter the beer to within an inch of it's life I would

So I can't see how yeast would get through IF they were filtering out
the chill
haze. Maybe there was something nasty living in the bottling lines?
Perhaps
they cut back on sanitation?

Craig,


   There is very little difference between 6 row and 2 row malt, at least at a
homebrewer's level.


    2 row and 6 row are called that because of the number of 'rows' or kernels
produced by each plant.  2 row has 2 rows, 6 row has 6 rows.  Not rocket
science.  6 row, since it produces more kernels is generally cheaper to
produce.  2 row, since there are fewer kernels per plant, is generally of
higher quality.


    6 row malt has slightly more enzymes to cut adjuncts.  That is why you
see 6 row malt called for in recipes that use corn, rice, or other adjuncts.
Most adjuncts have no enzymes of their own to aid conversion, so brewer's
rely on the enzymes in their malt to do it.  Since 6 row has more, they use it.
But 6 row doesn't have much more.  Enzyme capacity is measured in
degrees Lintner, and is called Diastatic Power.  2 row's Diastatic power is
usually around 140.  6 row is slightly more, usually about 150.  Not enough
to get real excited over.   Of course, these numbers can vary according to
the maltster.  There were a few posts about maltsters, malt, and malting last
week or so.


    I have seen some brewers complain that 6 row causes chill haze, because
it also contains higher protein levels that 2 row.  I have not really found this
to
be a problem in CAP's and American Lagers that I have made using it.


    We get Breiss 6 row malt here.  If you have Vienna malt available to you,
you will probably find that it is made from 6 row malt.  But Vienna malt is too
dark in color to make Ballantine.  You would use it with Munich malt and 2 row
lager malt to make Oktoberfest.


   I would say you could use 2 row in a Ballantine recipe with little to no
difference.


   Good Luck, let us know how it turns out.


Bill

Six row is historically autehntic but I wouldn't worry about it if you
can't get it.  The differences are minor enough.  Two row has slightly less
protein, less enzymes, slightly less husk, slightly more extract.  The
enzyme level is still plenty high enough to convert the adjunct starch.  I
still like the slight "edge" I think six-row gives to the character in an
adjunct beer.

I have been removing both in and out fittings and tubes.  I cover one post
with a small square of aluminum foil, then place a small "o" ring (removed
from the fitting) over the foil and post.  This actually makes an air tight
seal.  On the other post, I push a piece of vinyl tubing over the threads
and use a plastic tie-wrap to secure it down and also make it air-tight.  I
place the other end into a jar of water.


Actually, if I am transporting the newly pitched fermenter (like when we do
a club brew), I cover both posts with the foil, then put the tubing on when
I get home.  One of the greatest reasons to not use glass!!!!

That seems likely, but when you think about the geometry of the corny verses
the carboy, the carboy narrows like a funnel at the top almost speeding up
the blowoff.  The shape of the corny does not have this effect, and in my
case, blowoff has not been a problem. I might get 1 or 2 pints into the jar
which is acceptable.

No, I have removed the tubes.  I just rack with a cane, or 3/8 od tubing
with no cane but a cane cap.
When I get around to it I would like to try pulling with a vacuum into the
next keg, but I still would use the racking out of the fermenter. I like the
vacuum idea because it would help remove the oxygen out of the receiving
keg.  I just don't trust CO2 flushing.


I have not had a plugging problem with the small opening, I suppose in
theory it could happen. I have the other post covered with a foil/"o" ring,
so there is a release mechanism there.  I just do not think a SS keg would
give out before the plug. Could be wrong here, dunno.


I do 5 gal ferments in 5 gal cornies, but sure like the idea of the 10 gal
cornie.  I would buy one if I could see it first.

The tour with Dr. Budwiper stirred the hsa kettle again.


The reality is that the importance of hsa was always controversial in
professional circles.  I don't recall the references but the early research
showed an effect under controlled laboratory brews, but 2 of the 3 tests
done in a real brewery showed no effect.  If I recall correctly, they
brewed beer under a blanket of N2 and compared to usual ambient conditions.
 Since brewing scientists can't reach a consensus on the importance of hsa,
I'd be disappointed if homebrewers did.


Bud may not be the best commercial beer to evaluate hsa with.  A-B has long
had the reputation, well-deserved btw, for rotating stock faster than any
major brewer.  That's why A-B is able to beat all the small brewers over
the head with this freshness ad campaign.  Their not doing anything
different than they did 25 years ago but it became fashionable thanks in
part to small brewers.

True CreamALes are a hybrid.  The last one I did, I split a 6 gallon batch
and fermentted half with Wyeast 1056, the other half with Wyeast 2035.
So I did half as an ale, half as a lager.  I fermented the ale at room temp
(~60 - 70 degrees F) and the lager with a 'normal' lager schedule, i.e.
primary at 50 degrees F for 2 weeks, secondary at 50 degrees F for
2 weeks, reduce to ~35 degrees F, lager for about 3 to 4 weeks.
When fermentation was finished, I combined the 2 beers.


I liked it, and it got a 33 in competition from David Houseman, who is a
BJCP Master Judge.  The comments were that it was very light and clean.


This is something to try if you're feeling adventurous.

I would also like to get some beer related images and clip art.  I am taking
an HTML class, and would like to do a 'beer' page for my final project.  Of
particular interest to me would be an animated beer colored background
with little bubbles that rise up every so often.   I can't be the only one who
thought of this, it has to be out there.


Any help would be appreciated.


Thanks!

Subject: RIMS Question


I have been slowly building a RIMS. It is  just about ready for the first
batch. The question I have (it may be trivial) is related to the valve that
I will control the flow of the wort with. Some of the guys in my club have
the valve directly on the out flow side of the pump. A site I was looking
at, and have loosely based my system on this gentleman's system, has the
valve positioned on the out flow side of the heater chamber. For convenience
sake, it would serve me best on the outflow of my heater chamber, also. Is
one of these two positions preferred over the other? And if so what is the
reasons? Or, does it really mater where the valve is located? Thanks
