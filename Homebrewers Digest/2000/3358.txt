You might notice that 6.0% abw = 7.2% abv.  I think this is the key here.
I think that is why you remember those two key numbers.  There is no
indication from the historic sources I have (Wahl & Henius, Nugey) that
anything over 15P beer was produced.  This would work out at about the 6%
abw/7.2% abv we're talking about.  I remember talking to the owner of the
"Ice House" (a beverage store in the College Hill part of Cincinnati whose
nickname indicates its former role as a storage house of cut ice from
rivers and lakes) that all those people who thought they were getting "6%"
beer were deluding themselves, and that the beer was really 4.5% or so.
This would jibe with historic sources.


(Another old fart's side note here - small beer outlets that were open on
Sundays as exempt from Ohio "Blue laws" were called "pony kegs" - which
literally referred to 1/8 barrel (3.875 gallon) kegs.  I wonder if they
were called that anywhere outside of Cincinnati.)

The Volstead Act of October 27, 1919, clarified prohibition enforcement and
mandated 0.5% as the maximum legal alcohol content of any beverage - this
was near beer's upper limit.  This remained the maximum until the end of
prohibition in 1933. (Source - _The History of beer and Brewing in Chicago,
1833-1978_ by Bob Skilnik).

as well as slide rules and other artifacts, now are relegated to the trash
heap of history as much as the buggy whips of our grandparents.

Hi,


For my latest brew I used dry ale yeast code A 514 batch 60350. Package of 7
grams.
Does anyone know which yeast I used? manufacturer? charasteristics?
The gravity of my wheatbeer went down from 1.060 to 1.019 in 3 days at 20
degr.C (68 degr.F).
Thanks for all (flattering) recommendations of Promash. I bought the

G'day all


One has to feel sorry for those living in the south of this land.  They just
envy us here in the tropical North, especially when winter sets in.  Now
Phil (and Dave come to think of it) will have to come up with better than
that to get my goat up, after all, it was a feeble attempt to have a go at
Queensland own beer - XXXX.  Now it may be true that its yet another bland
commerical beer, but unlike the swill that has to compete against the
'Hiltons' tin brews (has the 'Hilton' dropped from five star to one in one
brewers madness decision), at least XXXX uses real hops in their brews.  Yep
thats right southerners, and for those wishing to clone it (why, who knows),
they use Pride of Ringwood for bitterness, and Golden Cluster for flavour.
Mind you its less and less each year.


And to inform the rest of the HBDers, we in North Queensland long ago
succeeded and separated from the rest of Australia.  If it wasn't for the
fact that we are glued on to the ass-end of the country, we would have
relocated ages ago.  We have trained our tiapans (the worlds deadliest
snake) to hunt down southerners on sight, and dont try to hid in the water,
our salties(little lizards 30 feet long) will keep you company.  So Phil and
Dave, you are more than welcome to join me for a drink at my bar anytime (if
you can make it).  And for everybodies info, real Aussies live above the
Tropic of Capricorn, and dont let them tell you otherwise.


And speaking of things Nth Qld, one can remember the days of our own great
beers (great when I was young), when they were brewed up here.  Cairns
Draft, Nth Qld Lager (NQ for short) were the mainstay of a young person
thirst.We even had good old South Pacific Green.  Now that was great
radiator fluid.  My bet this would be a great beer for the one star
'Hilton'.  It was a real mans beer (only real men could keep it down).
Opps, I forgot Phil, you dont have any down there do you.


Why do I raise this, well it seems Nth Qld beer could be on a comeback.
Rumor has it a micro might be opening up here.  Will keep you southerners
posted.


Hoegaarden White.  I'm going to ask 'the bleeden obvious'.  I have managed
to get a bottle of the stuff, quite fresh.  Its correct HBDers, isn't it,
that the yeast in the bottle is the same as they use in the fermenter.
There is no foreign yeast in it?


Now back to training those snakes!!!!!!!!!!!!!

OK, so I finally made a palatable lambic (kriek) beer and now it's time to

in solution. Can someone who does lambics give me some advice on the best

Subject: priming after cold conditioning


Could anyone please pass along any suggestions on priming after cold
conditioning?
I brewed a rice ale recently using German pils and rice, hoping to make
something light that my father-in-law might like. The yeast was Wyeast
Kolsch and after the usual 2 week secondary fermentation at around 65F,  I
put it in the refrigerator for 3 weeks at about 45F while I was on vacation.
Now it's time to bottle, but as I've never cold conditioned beer, I don't
know if the yeast will have enough umph left to bottle carbonate with my
usual 6 or so, ounce corn sugar addition.
Is the addition of more yeast needed? how much? I don't have the equipment
needed to force carbonate.
Thanks in advance for any suggestions,

Subject: pH H*ll,


Brewsters:


Brian says that Noonan has a special place in  H*ll for people who mash
above 5.3 ( first, I am not sure that Noonan would agree) .  I think all
authors who do not designate the TEMPERATURE of measurement of the mash pH
DO deserve their own place in hell. And it would be crowded. Brian,  that
includes you as you didn't tell us what temperature you were when you began
adding lactic acid to adjust your mash pH.  Your 5.7 ( I assume measured at
room temperature) mash was perfect for a Pilsner style as this range is
what the malt comes to in a low salts soft water and where Pilsner Urquell
is mashed. You should never have changed it.


Now all this stuff about pH for mashes being in the 5.2 to 5.3 range is
true under certain conditions 1) The mash pH is MEASURED at the mash
temperature ( in the 150s F region) with a temperature compensating pH
probe. This same mash when cooled to room temperature will measure
something like 5.4 to 5.6 ( the pH drops on heating from RT by 0.2 to 0.3
units) .  2) your brewing water has calcium levels which help drop the pH. 
3) You are interested in the maximum sacccharification enzyme activity. You
may not be.


Now for the real kicker. Never even worry about a mash pH until you reach
mashing temperature as there are chemical reactions which take place  on
the way up which take time and which affect the pH. If for some unknown
reason you have to adjust the pH ( and you shouldn't) do it at mash
temperature and the next time you brew you will be able to adjust it before
you start this particular batch by adding the same amount of stuff.


If you want the minerally taste of a Thames pale ale then add the minerals
for this reason and let the pH take care of itself. 


Keep on Brewin'

Transferred to secondary over the weekend, and I must say that
it does taste alot like Foster's.  That taste I always attributed to
Foster's that I could not describe accurately is there, and I now think
it is from the sugar.   Up to this point, I never used table sugar in a

This beer holds a special place in my heart for three reasons.  First, it is
a wonderful example of the Dusseldorf style.  Second, I won my first medal
in the AHA NHC with it in 1998.  Third, every time I pour a glass it reminds
me of Al K whose presence on the HBD I greatly miss.


As for the grain bill, I used the following for my first, and probably best,
attempt:


10 lbs. DWC Munich
0.5 lbs. DWC Aromatic
0.25 lbs. Wheat


This was single-decoction mashed.  Al K recommends upping the Aromatic a bit
if not decocting.  I can't remember how much more but I doubt you'd want to
use more than about 10% of the total grain bill for the Aromatic addition.


My alt yeast is Wyeast 1338, also recommended by Al K.  I tried 1007 once
and didn't like it as well.  Also, I'd recommend fermenting at about 60
degrees and then lagering for a few weeks.


Good luck!

Did you lager your steam beer at 33F or just keep it at cellar or fridge
temps?  The cold temperature of lagering causes chill haze proteins to
complex with polyphenols and to precipitate out.  This doesn't happen at
cellar temps at all, so I'd guess that at fridge temps, it will happen
less.  That might be part of the answer.


The higher gravity d'bock also would have more proteins, so more haze.  Was
there a difference in brewing that would contribute to higer levels of
these proteins or to the polyphenolics?

The steam Beer was also lagered at 33F. It was a single step infusion and
included a lot of munich malt from the same lot as the dopplebock. More
crystal and more 2Row (as a percentage). The dopplebock was a double
decoction.


I was asking the question as a general observation that it always takes so
long for lagers vs my ales. I guess the question was really too generalized,
the malt bill, mash schedule and other brewing processes probably create too
many variables to generalize this observation in any valid way.


Oh well.

They were explicit that that was one of the volatiles they were decreasing,
and sulfur compounds in general.

Bud traces its origins not to Munich, but to Budweis ( the German name for
Budvar) in Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic, but part of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire when Busch visited and brought back the idea for a
new beer.  I think they say that was 1876.  Pilsen (Plzen) is also in
Bohemia, and the beers are very similar.   They certainly do have full hop
aroma.  As a matter of fact, virtually all mainstream US lagers of today
are in the pilsner style, albeit much watered down by now, especially that
one that claims to have"the great taste of a true pilsner beer," Miller
Lite.


More on this in my talk at NHC in Livonia this Saturday at 8:30 AM (whose
idea was that time?).


Anheuser-Busch was certainly not the first or the only brewery to brew in
the Pilsner style in the US, but apparently Anheuser was brewing some
pretty poor lager before Busch got in the business.  I'll bet a recreation
of Budweiser of 100 years ago would be a pretty tasty beer - I'd guess
1.052, 20-25% rice, 40 IBU, Saaz flavor and aroma hops, mashed low (148F)
for full attenuation, long lagering on beechwood chips (which was a common
practice then).  Bring on the ladies of the billiard room!

Del's comment about plastic six-pack rings reminds me of a funny story.  In
a previous life I was a park naturalist (that's one of those ranger-types
who talks about nature, more properly called an interpretive naturalist;
all those of you who thought I meant I walked around without my clothes,
hold up your hands).


Anyway, we would skin and stuff dead animals for displays.  Someone brought
in a muskrat (Oz alert - that's an aquatic rodent that looks kind of like a
skinny rat - or think of a greatly scaled down duckbill platypus) that had
died of starvation or infection with one of those rings around its neck.
We thought it would make a good display with the ring on it, so the boss
asked me to skin and stuff it.  I had never done this, but I was game.


During the skinning, its head came off because the skin had worn very thin
(these cause a cruel, lingering death), so I finished stuffing the body and
head separately, then stitched the two together.  It looked pretty good
until I pulled the stitches  - they were evidently too big and loose, and
when I pulled them tight, the head twisted around about 180 degrees, so it
was backwards.  We nearly fell off our chairs.  (Well, it's kind of dull
there in the woods in the off season).


That specimen never went into a display case - it was a pretty obvious
first attempt, but it showed up regularly in odd places in the nature
center for months.  I wonder if they still have it.

Subject: Re: HSA source/Belgian yeasts


Dr Fix reminded me in private email that the original HSA research 
was performed by Hashimoto prior to the Weihenstephan folks picking 
up on it.


Spencer notes that a certain Belgian yeast strain produced a very 
clean beer when fermented around 65F.  Some strains will indeed do 
this, but if they are really typical Belgian strains then they are 
more accustomed to fermenting much warmer, try 80F and up!  A typical 
scenario would be to chill the wort to 65F with typical oxygen 
additions and yeast pitching.  Allow to climb without temperature 
control, and depending on how strong the beer is you can easily get 
into the 80s.  Various strains perform very differently when 
subjected to these conditions so some experimentation is expected.


Cheers!

Subject: Foster's Again






This recipe came out so well that I want to share it with the rest of my
homebrew club by publishing it in our next newsletter.  So I want to do
a small article about Foster's and Australian Lager, and include my
recipe.


I'd like help from the collective with 2 things - brewery info and Australian
Lingo.


I know Foster's is made for the US by Carlton and United, which I think
is owned by Molson, or possibly the other way around, CUB may own
Molson.  Which is it, what would I write?  What are some other Australian
Lagers - I've heard of Cooper's, and Victoria's (which I think may be an
ale).  I'm sure I will probably recognize the names when somebody
names more.


Second, I'd like some good *real* Australian Lingo.  I'm not sure how
real Australians feel about the Outback Steakhouse, but they list some
supposed lingo on their menus, things like  "Bonzer - Good"  "Tucker -
Food"  "Top Drop - Good Beer".  Are these real?  Who can give others?


Lastly, what words would Australians like to give to the American
heathens, er, Homebrewers, besides wishing they'd switch to the
metric system? ;)

Subject: Carbonic Acid / pH Depression


This is for all you guys who have had much more chemistry than was
obviously good for you.  To what degree does carbonation depress pH?  I am
thinking of about 20 psi at room temperature.  How much infection
protection could one expect?  Is it enough to effect yeast?
