I've seen them in the wine section of an hb shop. They are
used to de-gas finished, stabilized wine. The wings fold
against the body so it will fit through the mouth of the carboy.
When it spins the perf'ed wings spread out, releasing trapped
CO2. Kind of a gimmick and not cheap - $10+ - but probably
would be effective for aerating.

While I can't relate to HALF of the stuff you guys "down under" write, I do
find the mud slinging to be amusing as well as educational.  It's nice to
know that homebrweing is not an American-dominated hobby and that we share
the same passions on the other side of the world.  It's also nice to know
that some people use a REAL measurment system in a hobby that is mostly
tuned to an archaic one.  When most of your recipes call for x lbs of
something in y gallons of beer, try doing the crappy math and conversions to
x oz. of that same something in y oz. of beer (ie. going from batch to
bottle priming).  I'd rather move a decimal any day!  ;-)

I've made few cherry beers and this is what I've learned to save a lot of
time and increse the quality of my brews:


1.  Add fruit to the secondary to retain the maximum amount of flavor and
aroma.  Rack beer on top of fruit, don't add fruit to the beer or you will
oxidize the beer.


2.  If you're worried over wild yeasts then wash the fruit with water
followed by a soak it in a bucket containing a few campden tablets for a few
hours.  Then drain the fruit.  Do not let the fruit sit in the water too
long (read overnight) or the cherries will swell and crack and the color
from the skin will be leached into the water.


3. Crush the cherries without doing any work.  Put the cherries in large,
clean freezer bags and freeze for a few days.  This will crack the skin and
rupture the cells thereby exposing the fruit to the yeasts.


4. Use a sanitized nylon grain bag to hold your fruit and tie shut with a
sanitized plastic "zip tie".  Dump the frozen fruit into your pre-sanitized
grain bag and tie shut.  Place in your sanitized secondary fermenter
(bucket-type) to thaw.  After the thaw is complete rack your beer on top of
the fruit.  Pits, skin and sludge will stay in the bag making your racking
to a clarifying fermenter (tertiary?!?) much easier.  The bag can chucked or
washed and sanitized for re-use.  Very little chance for re-contamination
with this method vs. a mechanical crushing session.  You can even use a
bottling bucket and rack directly from the spigot!


My 2 cents worth!

I won't get into making black & white statements on that one either, but I
will say that brewing all-grain gives me a greater degree of control and
flexibility of what goes into my brews, thereby allowing me more POTENTIAL
to brew better beers.  How's that for saying "yes" without really comming
right out and saying it?  ;-)  I have brewed some really smash-up beers with
kits and specialty grains though!


Brew well!

Subject: Glacier Water(tm) RO water?


Has anyone used the Glacier Water(tm) brand of RO water, typically sold from
vending machines for about $0.30/gal?


I tried using a mixture of 20:80 filtered tap water to Glacier Water in
hopes of brewing an authentic Bohemian pils.  The resulting brew, however,
had a rather harsh bitterness which lingered and thus was not true to style.
I suspect, therefore, that the Glacier Water may have contained more ions
(sulfate maybe?) than RO water should have.  Anyone have similar experience
with this brand?


FWIW, the 20% tap water has these characteristics (ppm):


Calcium               41
Chloride              14
Magnesium            1
Sodium                11
Sulfate                 35
Tot. hardness     108 (as CaCO3)
pH                      8.5

Probably because most recommend UNHOPPED extract so you actually have a
clue about what hopping level you will end up with.  From what I can
tell, 2 cans of extract could give you anywhere from 15 to 35 IBU in 5
gallons depending on brand and I've never seen it specified on the can. 
Of course, I haven't bought a can of extract in several years, so maybe
that has changed.


The canned kit in question was a Mountmellick Stout Kit - it is already
hopped. Several kits now have the IBU level of the kit on the label.
OTOH, for extract kits made with unhopped extract, we recommend steeping
any specialty grains and boiling the bittering hops (w/o the extract)
for 45 min. before adding the extract for the last 10 min. of the boil.
This is to reduce darkening and carmelization. The increase in quality
of the extract and this process has evened the playing field between the
extract and the all-grain brewers in the Brewmasters. It has become
commonplace for members to not know if a beer being sampled
(particularly if it is a darker style) is extract or all-grain. This
includes the 2 National and 5 Certified BJCP judges in the group.  


This procedure recommendation raised a good question just yesterday.
Does the pH of the solution affect isomerization of the hops? Would
water treatment effect the utilization or is isomerization just a
time/heat factor? Discuss...

G'day All


Well the famed ayinger is away.  Knocked up a Hellsbock on Saturday while
the Ayinger was a little slow on the plate, once I started stepping up
starters, well the bugger just kept on coming.  Very active yeast is this
one, seems it couldn't wait for the fermenter.  I must admit I was quite
impressed how quick the starters kept coming to krausen, but that I suspose
that could be human perception, I was keen to use it.


Speaking of the "Hilton", results are back on the liquid the yeast came in.
Here I was thinking the famed night at the billard table was due to the rice
lagers, but our chemists here in Nth Qld says that theres another substance
in the liquid. An extract from some fungus it seems.  Could those ladies be
on something else other than the Billard table I wonder.

Yep Bill, those southerners dont know what they are missing.  Some of the
best seafood arround.  I'll shout you a Mud-Crab when you come.  Its the

you send over a carton of your whares.  We then can sit here and throw
empties at the tourists.

Bloody oath its the heat, so you are on notice now Adam,  but the wet and

Mr Wimpy,
Actually, depending on where you go in Australia, all of the above does in
fact happen. Certainly in Burradoo I wouldn't dream of brewing in anything
other than khaki.
And I have a good friend (who I taught to homebrew) who wrestles snakes and
other reptiles in a fashion that would put Crocodile Dundee to shame.


Searching for the real Australia, from a brewing point of view, has rather
captured my interest. Probably in a similar way that Jeff Renner has pursued
the brewing history of America.


There is a lot in the history and culture of both our countries that
shouldn't be let lost in this modern homogenised global village living that
we now all embrace.


Not that I am trying to hide in the past, I just think it is important to
hang on to a bit of individuality.
Hurry on over,
I'll serve you up a Mudgee Mud.

What is the pH of neutral water?


The correct answer is another question.  AT WHAT TEMPERATURE?


The pH of neutral water is 7 at 20C.  The neutral pH of boiling water is
closer to 6.
It has always been frustrating that virtually all brewing texts fail to
state the temperature at which they measure pH.


Understanding measurement of mash pH at different temperatures is a
2-step process.
1.  The actual honest to goodness pH depends on temperature.  In other
words the pH of a mash at 150F might really be 5.2 while this same mash
when cooled really is pH 5.5.  This issue is reflected in the temp
dependence of neutral water.


2.  pH meters without ATC (automatic temperature compensation)  measure
pH INACCURATELY AT ALL TEMPERATURES EXCEPT ONE, usually 20C.  In other
words, if you have a mash at pH 5.5 at 150F, your meter will not read
5.5 unless you are using a pH meter  with ATC (and the ATC must cover
this range, i.e., 0-70C).


A couple of other points about probes and ATC.
The life of all probes is greatly reduced when used at higher
temperatures.  This has nothing to do with ATC.   It is not a good idea
to keep the pH probe in the mash for any longer than necessary.


pH probes have limited temperature ranges over which they can operate
and survive--Again, this is irrespective of ATC.  For example, the best
quality Laboratory pH meter that we sell has ATC over 0-100C.  However,
the standard manufacturers probe with   this unit is quickly destroyed
if temp is over 50 or 80C (cant' remember which).  That's why I had the
manufacturer sub a probe that can work up to 100C (at a significant
price increase I might add).


There are advantages to measuring pH of cooled mash.
a) pH meters without ATC or with limited ATC range (0-50C for example)
are considerably cheaper.
b)all probes last much longer when used at room temperature
The only drawback is that you have to then estimate what the pH at the
higher mash temp is.  The 0.3 difference between 70 and 150F seems
pretty accurate.


Now what about pH papers and temperature dependence?  I'm not sure but I
think you have many of  the same issues with one additional one--as the
solution dries on the test strip it is cooling--so I'm not sure which
temperatue you are actually measuring the pH at.   One could check
quickly by simply measuring the pH of a mash at 150F and the same mash
at 70F and see if the difference is about 0.3.


Finally, I should thank my husband who has  explained pH temperature
dependence to many hundreds of chemistry students, almost as many times
as I've gotten the lecture.

well, since my name has been taken in vain... :)  AQIS specifically states
that the importation of whole hops "for homebrewing purposes" is forbidden.
Commercial breweries can, after jumping through the hoops, import whole
hops (and promise to keep them under lock and key, guard them with thier
lives etc). About a year ago, we ordered about 5 kg of Saaz, Fuggles and
EKG, which duly arrived through the post. Gleefully, we then ordered bigger
amounts, which were intercepted by AQIS, and destroyed, so I speak through
sad experience. For some reason, they don't worry about hop plugs, and of
course, hop pellets are no problem. I know some fellow oz brewers have
ordered whole hops in small quantities (250gm - 1kg) and received them,
others have not been so lucky.

Subject: Beer in Holland


I can recommend one particular brewery in Holland that you MUST stop by!
It is the Roffey Brewing Co. and they a few excellent products including
a pale ale, stout, and wheat beer. I'm fond of the Forecaster Pale Ale
and the Lake Effect Stout. I would highly suggest picking up a case --
or least a six-pack!


If  you want to know more about beer in Michigan check out the Michigan
Microbrewery & Brewpub Guide
(http://www.phd.msu.edu/bice/beer/brew.html) which is mentioned on my
website (http://www.marcobrau.com).


Cheers,
