Condolences accepted.
In the UK and Australia this is what is known as kit beer. What you
refer
to as kit beer is rarely available. Only a very few HB stores would
stock
something like that. 90% of "homebrewers" here are what we call "kit 'n'
kilo" brewers. One kit either 1.5, 1.6 or 1.8kg depending on brand and a
kilo
of table sugar. Bingo! An "expert" brewer. You must remember that most
Australian homebrewers have NEVER seen the inside of a homebrew store,
as
everything you need is available on the homebrew shelf of your local
supermarket. If you are an "expert" you add a "brew booster pack"
which contains a mix of sucrose, dextrose, dry malt extract and
maltodextrin in varying proportions.


Speaking of which, fellow Adelaide brewers, wasn't the Coopers
Homebrew Show a waste of time! Did you hear the advice given
at the beginners' seminars?? Attention EVERYONE.. bottle your
beer after 4-5 days of fermentation.. no matter what!!!!
That's what the man said... I guess the local hospitals will
be getting a lot of brewers visiting the emergency wards soon asking
for glass removal surgery...
Well done Coopers for such great advice you sponsored.
I'm just heartened that the sales of kits that contain specialty
grains, malt extract and finishing hops from the stall I was working at
was good. At least some people there were interested in making
decent beer.

My 20l mash bucket will usefully hold about 6kg of grain mash. It will
hold perhaps 
1 kg more if I was to push it to the rim of the bucket but then it
becomes way
to slow to sparge. As per amount of beer.. yes it varies considerably as
there
are two variables: efficency and volume.


If you have 66% efficency you would get 25l of 1.047SG wort approx. from
6kg grain

Subject: fridge woes




I just got a small commercial type fridge for scrap. It works but.... the
temp gradiant is 13 degrees F low to high with the low set at +33. the door
seals are leaking some and I've twidled with the temp controller thing-a-gig
but 13 is a close as I can get. When I got this unit, the range was +40
degrees so I'm getting closer. Since I know how to fix the seal problem, my
question for all of you refer gurus is, what is the difference of "cut in"
and "cut out" on the controller thing? Which do I turn clockwise to get a
tighter temp range? Things just seem to happen opposite of what I figure.
The more I mess with it the more confused I get, maybe I'm having one to
many brews wilst I ponder this puzzle.

I have been using DWC Munich malt for years and never gave much thought

I recently ran out and bought some from another supplier who had re-packaged
it in 5 lb bags and labeled it "Color Munich".


I bought 50 lbs and would hate to find out that it is some sort of caramel

Can someone offer any advice?

Jim stated that he was having trouble growing hops close to a black walnut 
tree and someone told him that may be the trouble he is having with his hop 
plants. Believe me I am no farmer but I was reading about grape growing on a 
sight called The Grape Grower's Notebook. There is a section there on trees 
and it agrees with what you were told. He feels the most lethal variety (to 
grapes) is the American Black Walnut. 


Hope this helps.

These two recipes might be hard to mingle in a "parti-gyle" (two mash
run batch) beginning with the stout.  Many all-grain stout recipes call
for a pound of roast barley and a pound of flaked barley (which must be
mashed with some regular grain to convert.  The first runnings for your
IPA may have more roast and flaked barley flavor than you wish.  I
usually make a second beer that is weaker and darker than the first
beer.  (For example, IPA followed by a porter, or a Scottish Ale
followed by a British brown.)

Yes, one major problem ---- your flaked and roasted barleys need some
regular enzymes from pale/pils malt in order to successfully convert
starches.  This is why it would be better to use the first runnings for
the IPA where the emphasis is on malt and the second runnings for stout
or perhaps better yet, Porter.

It will... plan carefully and bear in mind that the second beer will
have some problems hitting the desired starting gravity.

My first comment is :
I didn't do it!!
Ivan Milat did.


Now Scotty, don't you go scaring our good American homebrewing friends with
such awful stories about hitch hiker mass murders.


I've got the much celebrated Ray Kruse and his lovely wife Linda on their
way out here for a visit next month. Ray says he expects to be treated like
a queen (which shouldn't be hard - I suspect he is one) but in any event I
certainly don't want him thinking he will be chopped into pieces and spread
around the Belanglo State Forest. Though I must admit, after the skunk oil
episode, the thought did cross my mind.


Only joking Ray, please don't cancel your tickets.


It would be nice to think that a few more of you American homebrewing folk
could get out here for a visit.
The HBD is a great communication tool. But it's lonely out here in Burradoo.
Well, I've got Wes Smith around the corner.
And of course there are always the thirsty lads down at the Burradoo Hilton.
But mostly I drink at home alone with nothing but the visions of Marilyn
crawling out of the bog to keep me occupied.
That and my routine flogging from Jill later in the evening.
I was married late in life.
Is this sort of thing considered normal?


Anyway, this Friday I'm heading all the way north to visit my good mate Dave
Lamotte in Newcastle. Dave has got for me an eighty, yes eighty!! litre
corny keg which I will use as a monster fermenter.
And in the back of the ute will be my trusty 10 litre mobile drinking kit
which I plan to demonstrate to Dave.
And if by chance, when I peel back the tarp,
A couple of good looking hitch hikers have jumped a ride.
Well I'll share the moment with Dave.
In Oz we're like that.
Not like those New Zealand bastards,
Who won't even share their sheep!!

Yes I did. On the Belgium side of the border is located the new Trappist
brewery Achelse Kluis. Very modern (stainless steel).
At least 1 real monk (brewmaster Thomas is helping the brewer Tom).
Nice clean beers (3). Not so rich like some other Trappist beers.

Subject: Homegrown Hops


I'm trying my hand at growing hops this year.  Of my four plants, only
one, the Cascade, is presently flowering.  Being their first year, I
wasn't really expecting much, so I guess this is a bonus.  Anyway, I'm
wondering about when to harvest.  I have a picture of what the Cascade
hop cone is supposed to look like (
http://www.john-i-haas.com/cascade.htm ) but my cones do not look like
this.  The picture shows an elongated cone; mine are much stubbier.
However, they seem to pass all the other "tests":


Light, papery feel
Light green color
Do not stay compressed when squeezed
Visible lupulin glands
Slight browning of lower bracts
Decent aroma


Growing Info:  Since other El Paso Desert hop growers that I know of
have failed in attepts to grow hops (they always seem to burn up and die
before getting more than a couple inches tall), I decided to plant mine
in pots on the shady side of the house.  I know they are supposed to
have several hours of direct sun, but I think that's "Oregon sun" and
not "El Paso sun"!  They do get maybe 3-4 hours direct sun and strong,
reflected light the rest of the day.  The plants are all about 10 feet
tall (the Willamettes have started to double back and are probably
14').  I water twice daily on a drip system, delivering about a quart
each time.  The pots are probably 4 gallons.  I used potting soil and I
fertilize every few weeks.


My questions are:


1.  Despite the appearance, are they actually ready to harvest?
2.  Is the appearance due to their being first-year?
3.  Are they going to be usable in brewing?


Thanks.

Subject: RE: Problems Growing Hops


Jim,


Your dad is right.  Black Walnut trees are detrimental to many different
types of plants.  The tree's roots secrete an enzyme called juglone (though
there is some debate if this is the actual compound) that is toxic to many
different species of plants.  The toxic zone from a mature tree is usually a
50 to 60 foot radius from the trunk, but can be up to 80 feet, with
susceptible plants dead within the root zone and dying at the margins.
Tomatoes are especially prone.  Though I have no idea if hops are
susceptible.  Many plants do well under a black walnut and some like
Kentucky Bluegrass even thrive.  You may be finding the same thing I have,
the older I get, the smarter my dad gets.


I'd suggest taking a picture of the whole vine and a few leaves to your
local extension office.  They can diagnose the problem without speculation.

I did a couple of sour mashes for stout by mixing in some of my
sourdough starter (mix of wild yeast and lactobacillus). It came out
smelling and tasting pretty good, and I didn't have any worries adding

Brian, I'm no "alco-nazi" and this is not intended as a flame either.  But I
cannot agree with your viewpoint for one reason:  Fines, surcharges and jail
terms DON'T BRING BACK THE DEAD.  Once and accident happens, it's already
too late.  I'm a volunteer firefighter and EMT who has scraped my fair share
of victims off of the pavement.  Many of them have been because of drunk
drivers.  Do you know how hard it is to tell a terrified 3 year-old that she
can't see her mommy right now (because she's dead in the back of my rig)?
BTW, it was my word and a cop's against the driver's on how his nose got
broken. He was lucky to have gotten away that easy.


Don't make my job any harder than it already is.  Brew good beer and drink
it responsibly.

I think you are right in your analysis of what Dornbusch meant, but it is

I didn't mean to suggest that, but I may have been unclear.  Of course,
it's impossible to distinguish which Ca++ comes from which source.  From AJ
DeLange's post of April, 1997:

Back to Dave:

Especially at pH of higher than 9.6.  From what I've tried to learn or at
least remember from AJ's excellent posts, after treatment, you need to
decant off the ppt. before CO2 dissolves from the air the calcium carbonate
begins to redissolve (as bicarbonate).  Then you're even worse off than you
were to start with.
>
>What is the actual experience with pH in water treating when lime is added

The municipal water treatment plant in Ann Arbor uses lime treatment to
soften the water.  The pre-treatment water is somewhere in the low 7's, as
I recall, and the water in the mains was in the mid 9's when I lived in
town.  I think they may have lowered this slightly since.   From AJ's same
post:

Not to be hard on you, but the first rule in sensible pest management is to

Black walnuts do indeed put a substance into the soil from their roots that
surpresses the growth of some other plants.  Tomatoes are susceptible to
this.  However, I have a very healthy bunch of Cascade hops almost in the
shade of a black walnut grove.  I don't know if they are further apart than
in your case, but at any rate, I would think it would cause a stunting of
the whole plant, not the symptoms you discribe.


After saying all of this, I don't know what is wrong.  I think Oregon State
has some help (I think there's a link from http://www.hoptech.com/ or
http://realbeer.com/hops/, and your local extension agent might be able to
help if you took in a sample.

As Pat pointed out, it is the former.  You may have noticed the same thing

There is a beer glass design from Germany, I think, patented, I also think,
with an etched roughness on the inside bottom of the glass that does the
same thing.  They will produce this pattern in a design of your choice, so
a brewery could have its logo on the bottom.  Pretty neat, I think.  I
haven't seen this advertised here in the States.  I thought it would be a
nice thing for our club glasses.


One might think that this would lead to flat beer from fast decarbonation
but I think there is enough extra gas in the beer.

As Pat has already pointed out, the answer is yes. As a winemaker, I quickly
learned not to add dry ingredients to something saturated with carbon
dioxide. However, it seems to me all you are doing here is creating flat,
salty beer. Then again, being Canadian, she probably discovered that this
actually improved the taste of Labatt Blue. (Oh, behave!)


This does give me an idea , though, for the next time a waiter comes over
offering freshly ground pepper.

The North Shore Brewers and the Topsfield Fair announce the 2000 Topsfield 
Fair Homebrew Competition,
to be held on Saturday, September 9, 2000.


Entries are due by September 2, 2000.


There will be numerous drop-off locations in the Greater Boston 
Area.  Entries can also be dropped off at the Topsfield Fairgrounds August 
29th - September 1st, or shipped to us by the shipping service of your choice.


This year we've got a web site with the relevant information, including 
competition rules, entry form, and bottle labels, located at:


http://hbd.org/northshore/Topsfair.html


The pdf fill-in forms are especially handy, IMHO.  They allow you to enter 
all the form information using your computer keyboard - and, in the case of 
the bottle labels, entering your name once will simultaneously enter it on 
all six labels on the page, and entering the style class and sub-class will 
enter it on the first three or last three labels, depending on where you're 
typing.  You must have the Adobe Acrobat Reader version 3.0 or later.


At the same URL is a link for *on-line* judge and steward sign-up.  Early 
registration helps us to plan better (as well as preventing undue panic 
:-)), and, using the on-line forms, it only takes a few minutes of your time.

Subject: Removing rust from stainless steel


Lyndon responded to Keith post which apparently asked how to remove
rust on stainless steel caused by having a plain steel washer in
contact with it. Lyndon cited the common use of nitric acid for
repassivation because it preferentially dissolves and iron oxide and
cleans the stainless steel. He also cautioned its use, due to it being
highly corrosive to skin.


The above method works, but there is a much less hazardous method that
works equally well. Use an oxalic acid-based stainless steel cleanser
and a non-metallic scrubby pad (ex. 3M Scotchbrite) to scour the rust
away. You can typically find the cleanser in the grocery store for
cleaning stainless steel pans. Scour the rust away, rinse thoroughly,
dry it and let it sit for a week to repassivate itself naturally.
Done. This technique can also be used to repassivate weld areas on
stainless steel.

From: AJ <ajdel`at`mindspring.com>
Subject: Alkalinity


RE: the discussion of alkalinity: I haven't read the Dornbusch material
in question so I'll be general. Dave's observation that the terminology
WRT to alkalinity is confusing is certainly valid. It would probably be
better if rather than calling it "alkalinity" we called it "buffering
capacity" because that is really what it is. It is also related to the
amount of alkali in the water and that's probably why we call it what we
do. The catch is that the pH doesn't tell you how much acid or base is
in a solution - only what the balance between the two is. One millimole
of acid with one millimole of base in a liter of water gives the same pH
as one mole of acid and one millimole of base (ionic strength
cosiderations aside).


The key  to understanding is in how alkalinity is measured. Strong acid
is added to a sample of water until the pH reaches 4.3 (in brewing, in
water treatment other values of pH close to 4.3 are used). Thus anything
in the water which consumes protons contributes to alkalinity. This
includes carbonate, bicarbonate, phosphate, silicate, nitrate, nitrite
and hydroxide. Of these bicarbonate is the only one that is significant
when pH is less than 8.3. At higher pH's carbonate and hydroxide come
into play but hydroxide should not be a big factor in brewing water at
normal pH's (at pH 10 hydroxide contributes 5 ppm as CaCO3). Phosphate,
silicate, nitrate and nitrite either have dissociation constants such
that they are minor contributors and/or are at low enough concentration
that they don't make an appreciable contribution.


When Ca(OH)2  (or CaO) is added to water, hydroxyl ions are released.
Some of these are "neutralized" (as Dave suggested) by the "acid" HCO3-
forming water and CO3-- . If calcium is present in sufficient quantity
that [Ca++][CO3--] > Ks  = 3.3E-9 (25C) there is precipitation of chalk
which removes carbonate. This upsets the equilibrium so more bicarbonate
shifts to carbonate releasing more protons which neutralize more (OH-)
and the pH falls back. The way I do this is to make up a slurry of lime
and add it to the water to be decarbonated until the pH reaches 9.5 -
10. I seed the water with chalk first to aid in the precipitation. As
precipitation occurs, the pH starts to fall back. I then trickle in more
lime slurry  slowly so as to maintain the pH in the 9.5 - 10 region. The
pH will continue to fall back indefinitely as CO2 from the air dissolves
but the rate of fallback is much slower after the water's initial
bicarbonate load has been precipitated. At this point I stop adding
slurry and continue to stir until the pH reaches about 9. At this point
the precipitate is allowed to settle and the clear water decanted.


The level to which you can theoretically decarbonate depends upon the
original calcium and alkalinity levels before lime is added. If the
hardness and alkalinity are numerically equal you can theoretically get
down to less that 20 ppm alkalinity (as CaCO3) at pH 9. For calcium
hardness three times alkalinity you can theoretically get pretty close
to 0. As a practical matter, if calcium was in excess (calcium hardness
greater than the alkalinity) or if you have rendered the calcium
hardness greater than the alkalinity by adding calcium chloride or
calcium sulfate, you should have water with alkalinity of 50 ppm or less
as CaCO3 when you are finished (the best I have ever done is 21 ppm).
Addition of a calcium salt before lime addition is probably advisable in
a majority of cases as each mEq of bicarbonate precipitated takes two
mEq of calcium with it and a healthy amount of calcium is wanted in the
mash.

Subject: Question about a keg


My father recently gave me an old keg that he acquired very cheap at 
an auction.  After looking at the last issue of Brewing Techniques, 
which has alot of info on kegs, I believe the keg is a Hoff-Stevens 
type.  It looks like the stereotypical beer keg,  being fat in the 
middle and narrowing at the ends.  (My dad says this was so the 
brewers could roll the keg).  It is marked with the name of the now 
defunct Schmidt's brewery, which used to be here in Philadelphia.  It 
is stamped ALCOA, so It must be made of aluminum.  It says it is 7.75 
gallons.  It has a wood bung in the hole, and sloshes.  It is 
apparently about 1/4 full with old beer (or something).  It has a 
round connection on the top with 2 holes in it.


Some questions:
Eventually, I would like to get an English style hand pump, and 
perhaps use this keg for cask style English ales like bitter or mild.


1) I gather these kegs aren't valuable?
2) Where can I acquire replacement bungs?  I gather that I will have 
to destroy the bung to remove it.
3) Being made of aluminum, is it safe to use this to dispense beer? 
I've read that you shouldn't use aluminum brew pots, though I know 
people do.  But this would be for dispensing finished beer, not for 
boiling wort.  I typically have 5 or 6 of the 5 gallon Pepsi kegs 
full of beer at any point in time.  Some of my beers hang around for 
6 months or more, so we could be taking long term storage.  I am 
currently drinking a cream ale that I kegged on December 21st.  It is 
still very good, and about half the keg is left.  Guess my sanitation 
was good on this one!
4) Alternatively, 7.75 gallons seems like a good size for a primary fermenter.


I am aware of the fittings required for this keg, except for the 
bungs.  It should be fairly easy to clean.


Anybody out there using this kind of a keg in a homebrew set up? 
Anybody know of anything to watch out for?


Thanks.

Did get to see a re-creation of a pioneer country brewery in the

used
regular barley, not malt but the house next door was that of a
prosperous business man who
owned a number of businesses including a malt house.  The brewery
brought in sacked
ground malt via a 2nd story rope and pulley and used hand pumps to bring
the water up
to the kettle to heat.  It was then pumped up to a reservoir to drain
into a mash tun.


The mash tun was sparged into a settling vessel, then the wort was hand
pumped back
to the boiling kettle.  After hops and boiling, it was let into a vessel
and pumped to
a three level coolship.  From there to fermenters and lagering in the

Looking for good beer in Ann Arbor.. I am an artist who will be exhibiting
in AA next week for the Arts Festival (on South University .. near villiage
variety) 4 looooong days.. I will seriously be in need of good beer sites ..
bars, cafes, pubs, or stores ..
 .. also a list of local beers to look for would be good


If you come out to the show stop by and say hi. I am a HBr and will be
running one of the 4 'North Eastern HomeBrewer of the Year' out here in
western MA. this fall


Jim, IMHO you'll want to go to Arbor Brewing, best in town, great variety. 
Grizzly Peak down the street has mediocre beer, but nothing objectionable. 
Good food.




Don't take life too seriously...you won't get out alive.
