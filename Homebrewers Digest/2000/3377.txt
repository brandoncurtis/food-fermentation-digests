Stupid brewer tricks 42.1, 42.2, 42.3; all having to do with explosive force
of some kind or another. I wonder if this description of beer bombing
techniques will get me investigated by BATF... Could make life even more
interesting I guess.


42.1 - One of my first was putting an airlock on a 1.092 gravity Imperial
Stout,watching it foam up through the airlock in an explosive fermentation
and then making the BIG mistake of pulling the airlock out of the carboy.
Spent the next 4 hours cleaning black spots off the walls, ceiling and
everything else within 15 feet of that fermenter. From then on, I always
covered the top of the carboy with a bucket when removing a clogged up
airlock. Its amazing how much pressure can build up in those carboys and how
far the wort/beer will eject itself out of the carboy when pressure is
released.


42.2 - Another brain damaged trick was the night of an Christmas party 2
years ago when I had just finished rinsing a 5 gallon carboy and left it
full of water on the patio. During the party a number of us spent an hour on
the patio toking away on our fine cigars and whining about the 20 degree F
weather. Well the next morning that carboy was shimmering and displaying all
sorts of rainbow colors on the side of the house. Right up until the time I
touched it and it fell into about 6 thousand pieces. Seems that water
expands rather too much for glass to handle at that temperature (20F) and
tends to blow up carboys, although not with as much excitement as the carboy
with plugged up airlock.


42.3 - Don't you just love innovation? Like those neat little basket shelfs
you can buy that have little hooks on them that allow you to double your
storage space instantly. check out home depot, they are great. So when we
moved to our new little condo (I hate this place) and bought a new Weber
barbecue, the wife put one of those little baskets on the side of the
barbecue. While brewing a pilsner this weekend (should be ready for our
housewarming party when we get the hell out of this condo) I used the handle
little basket to toss my butane powered barbecue lighter into. Now the weber
has an automatic lighter, but the brewing burners still need flame, which is
why I have the barbecue lighter. The basket/shelf is a wonderful place to
stick stuff like this (along with gloves, sponges, odds and ends). Well this
evening (6 days later) while I have some chicken barbecuing on the grill,
I'm pouring a glass of single malt scotch when (KKKKAAAAABBBBLLLOOOOOMMMM),
about 10 feet away, I hear and feel this explosion. After slowing my heart
rate back down again somewhere below 200, I creep over to the barbecue and
look all over for what the heck made that noise. I now have a barbecue
lighter in about 15 pieces, minus any sign of the container that held the
butane. I then realized that it was about 12 inches away from the underside
of the barbecue box and I guess it got just a little bit too hot.


So watch where you store those igniters. If they have gas in them, keep 'em
away from the bbq. If I had actually been standing in front of the bbq when
that sucker blew, I might not be typing this note...

Subject: 48 hour lag!


or, has anyone else had >success< using 
"Yeast Lab Whitbread Yeast" (mfg. G.W. KENT, Inc)?
or: Stupid Brewer Tricks #347


I'm brewing a 'throwback' mild last sunday, and decided
late, so I figured I'd use some dry yeast purchased for
exactly these types of occassion.  I normally use Windsor
by Danstar, but I had 6 packs of the Whitbread, so...


I started the yeast as recommended, 2 sachets in about
200 mls of ~100F water for 14 minutes (couldn't wait
that last minute :) then I added 1Q of 1.040 canned
starter wort, set it on the stir plate and let it go at medium
speed (enough to stir, no major vortex).  I let it sit & stir for
the duration of the brewing (about 5 hours to knockout).
O2 added right after all the  wort (11 gals) is in the (open)
fermentor.


About 4 hours after pitching, I >thought< I saw slight signs
of fermentation... I went to bed.
Next day, no real signs of fermentation... a few bubbles now
and again... ok, don't panic... I let it sit...
That evening, still nothing - ok, panic!  I added another pack
of the Whitbread directly - just sprinkled on the surface.
4 hours later, still nothing, so I really panic and toss in a
partially done starter from a culture - 100 mls with a 
noticeable layer of yeast on the bottom.  Next morning, 
definite signs of fermentation, that evening, nice high kreusen.
48 hours.  I'm really testing my sanitation this time...


Ok, here's the kicker... This is the 3rd time I've tried this
yeast, with similar results...  The first two times, the yeast
came from a completely different supplier (different parts
of the country even!).  I'm beginning to suspect it's not me...


So, back to the first question, is this just bad yeast? or
did I really do something wrong?  I DO store it in the freezer.
(Clayton Cone question: is it good, bad, or indifferent to store
dry yeast in the freezer?)

Actually, I thought the mere fact that any post coming from me automatically
went into everybody's "silly" bin, abrogated any requirement for me to
nominate categories.


But I take the Doc's point.


I'm just relieved he didn't put me in Category Two.
Now I wonder who fits in there?
Can we have some scientific appraisal on this?


But before I lose the thread of my "silly" post, I want to respond to Mr
Fouch (world peace brewer) on the matter of international homebrewing rifts.
I must have missed something Eric.
I recall hearing from some Adelaidians who were obsessed with weeing on each
other's suburbs.
I recall Graham Sanders making light of feeding tourists to the crocodiles.
I recall writing a sincere and (might I say) most flattering description of
your physical self.


But no where have I noticed any rift between Oz and Yankee brewers.


Swedish and Yankee brewers, well in this area I have detected a degree of
animosity.


But not from us fun loving Aussies.
We just like to make fun of everyone. Especially ourselves.


And to show my sincerity,
I insist Eric that you make the trip out here with Ray.


If Ray is going to baulk at dressing up in suspenders and fish net
stockings, well I am going to need a capable bloke like yourself to help
out.


I told the lads at the Burradoo Hilton a couple of good sorts were coming
out from America to show them (amongst other things) how to brew good beer.
The lads at the BH haven't seen a woman in years.

 Wort Bros
How do I explain sanitary welds to my welder? When questioned about it he 
pointed to one of his welds and asked how it was. I didn't know. Is it 
porosity and seams that we are trying to stay away from? How can I get an 
other wise good welder to understand sanitary welds?


I have access to a welder(my quaisi brewing partner) that worked at nasa and 
had his welds xrayed. But he has no rig.


Also, in my searching I have found, what seems to be a stellar stainless 
connection. He has ss 1/2" ball valves for $12,  1/2" ss tubing for $2.40 per 
foot, and 1/2"x4" ss nipples for $1.50. He is also sending me an Ashcroft 
catalog to choose which thermometer is right for me. Any advice? As well, 
they can get triclovers,woohoo.

Subject: acetone (category 4/5)


Dr. Pivo writes about acetone in his brew, and the removal of it by 
"krausen lagering".  Pretty slick.


While I've never had acetone smell/taste in my brew, I often notice it present
in the "hooch" (nasty gray liquid) that sits atop my sourdough starters. Some
cultures produce it at levels that would make it smell stronger than actual
nail polish remover. 


 My next move, being a sourdough experimenter, would be to mix up a little
flour and water and set it in the Dr.'s brew room. Then I'd have him kick some
car batteries and move some boxes, hopefully I'd capture some tasty sourdough
friends. 


Also Doc, are you going to try your method on the other two kegs? I wonder if
it would work on them as well? Of course you could bottle it and sell it as
"Craft Brewed Nail Polish Remover" in the vicinity of "The Hilton". There's
Ladies aplenty, and with an endorsement from Phil the stuff would fly!

Subject: My First Batch (Details)


It was brought to my attention that I forgot to say how I made my homebrew 
(to see what I screwed up on).  I didn't even think about giving the details 
of how I made my homebrew because I didn't think...well I see the error in 
my ways.  I didn't think.


The kit was 8lbs of "Blended Malt Extract" (WestCoast Pale Ale), 2 oz. of 
Cascade hops, (1.5 oz. for bittering and .5 for finishing), and "dry ale 
yeast".


I added the extract and boiled the hops for 45 mins, and added the finishing 
hops during in the last minute.  I was worried about contamination of my 
wort, so I did everything a little fast.  I don't think my yeast was proofed 
well enough, but the fermentation went good.  I fermented in a 6 1/2 gallon 
carboy for 7 1/2 days.  The yeast didn't start to go until about 24 hours 
after it was proofed.  The only thing I know I did wrong was, I fermented at 
too high of a temp.  I couldn't keep my apt cool enough, so I started the 
fermentation at 74, but was able to keep it down to about 72 after the first 
day.  And last day got it down to 70.  (With no air conditioner, I played 
the pay attention to the windows at night game).  But next time I am going 
to be more prepared.  Other than that, my first batch went according to my 
instructions, which is a combination of www.homebrewmart.com brewing 
instructions, and homebrewing for dummies (a really well written book, I was 
skeptical).


I appreciate all the help and responses I have been getting.

Hello, 


I want to add some wine sweetener to a finished mead and need to know 
what my sanitation process should be.  If I were to boil the sweetener ( 
I assume its lactose) in water, would the complex sugar break down into 
simple fermentable sugars?  If so, what is the risk if I add some camden 
tablets to the solution and add it while still cold?

Subject: Sour mash or just a bit sour beer.


A few years ago I tried a "lactic experiment". I made 2 gallons of a
simple, light-coloured, medium-strength beer. Before it finished
fermenting, I racked it into 2 gallon jugs and added about 1
tablespoon of live yoghurt to "jug B". A & B finished fermenting
apparently about the same and I bottled them. They tasted almost the
same soon after bottling but gradually the bottles of B developed a
pleasant sourness (a bit like Belgian sour beers). There were no ill
effects such as excessive carbonation or heavy sediment.

malts are listed as Pale, Wheat, Munich, and 40L Caramel.  Does anyone know

I have acquired 2 bundles of unmalted  wheat, 50 pounds in each.  One 
is "golden", the other "red".
This is from a farm in upstate PA.  I don't actually have it yet, I 
will pick it up tomorrow.


1) What is the difference between the red and the gold?  I remember 
reading something about red wheat being 'winter wheat', or something 
like that.


2) Could this be used in beer?  I hope so, because that's what I 
bought it for.  Maybe a hefeweizen with the golden, a saison with the 
red, a dunkelweizen with a combination?   I have some Belgian 
Ardennes yeast on hand.  My local shop has Weihenstephen.  I hear 
that Weihenstephen  yeast is supposed to be tolerant of high 
temperatures, and it is a great time to make this beer.


Anybody have any experience using unmalted wheat, directly from a 
farm?  I know that wheat can be tough to mash, it sticks, etc.  I 
have heard that it is wise to use rice hulls in the mash with it.


Any good recipes for an all grain wheat beer?


Thanks for any advice.

Brewers


One of the wonderful things about being the CAP guru is that people send me
samples of their brews for tasting.  Unfortunately, some of these samples
get separated from the identification in my fridge.  A CAML (Classic
American Malt Liquor, presumably) has been in my fridge for several months
and I'd like to know whose it is and something about it before I drink it.
Can anyone claim it?

Subject: Burners for RIMS,
           RE: BAC Rant
           Brewing Diabetics, and
           Nutz to live and brew DOWNUNDER


    First  thing is I'd like to know is if anyone knows of a good place to 
order burners from? They are available from Beer, Beer, and more BEER, But I 
like to shop around a bit. My RIMS platform is built [UNISTRUT, the fittings 
I salvaged at work {salvaged, NOT swiped!!!}, the Unistrut bar stock I 
bought. A VERY dear item to buy... I called in my order, cut to my 
dimensions. Went round to pick it up and about messed my pants when they rang 
my credit card for $180.00!!! The beatings the Baron recieves are NOTHING to 
compare with the one my wife's going to give me when she finds I lifted her 
card again!!!


    Speaking of the Baron [and all our other fellow brewers Downunder]
I've given up on my dreams of visiting your beautiful country. The reason 
I've changed my mind is that after watching "The Crocodile Hunter" last night 
I've figured out that I'm not tuff enough to visit!!!! You'd have to be nutz 
to brew in a country where there's SPIDERS [nasty poisonous ones, Redbacks 
and the like] lurking about everywhere trying to ruin your day. According to 
the Croc Hunter, they're everywhere, waiting to ruin your day! I can handle 
infections, stuck mashes, ect. ect... But I'm a little too wimpy to deal with 
poisonous SPIDERS hanging about all over the place. When they said that you 
have to make sure that even when you go to the 'loo in the middle of the 
night, you need to make sure to turn the light on or you'll get a good wake 
up call! Stumbling around in the middle of the night I know I wouldn't run 
into any "Saltys" or snakes but I ain't gonna deal with any spiders waiting 
to take a bite outa my arse!!! 


    Re: BAC rant
    Just last week on a vacation day at about 3  in the afternoon I had just 
got out of my Ford Ranger, and as I was sitting down in the living room to 
read the paper I heard a loud crash, looked up and saw my truck going past 
the window!! A drunk driver tore up the whole side of my truck, bumper to 
bumper, them tried to get away, consequently hitting a van down the way. 
After a bit, the driver decided to leg out before the cops came! She was 
pretty smashed though {.267%] and decided for some reason that her best 
defense was first to run away. After getting about a 1/2 mile away, she 
decided to call the police and claim a kidnap, rape, and robbery attempt 
[presumably she meant me and the 20 or 25 neighbors that were out in the 
street waiting for the police]! So hey! drink in MODERATION and DON'Tdrink 
and drive!!!

    Hey, it really sucked being told I had to watch my Carbohydrate intake 
the rest of my life but there's a lot worse thinks that can happen to you! I 
drink at most, pushing it, 2 beers in a day, never without eating or 
excersizing. I was just wondering how many others there are like me who still 
brew?  It's like the kiss of death when the doc say's... to stop drinking, 
diet pop, no sweet stuff, few potatoes, rice and bread!! I'm a lucky one 
though, I did what I was supposed to do,  my sugar levels were normal for 
over a year so the doc cleared me to drink in careful moderation, 4 or 5 
beers total in a week, cutting back on other carbs when I do drink. I started 
brewing in 1985, through 1997, then got out when the doc said no more 
drinking. I started brewing like most others did, to create and drink GOOD 
beer. I've been drinking again the last two years. I decided that, although 
there are good beers on the shelf around here I truly LOVED to create my own 
beers. So I'm getting back in and building a RIMS.  It's a great hobby and 
this digest is a great forum!!!
