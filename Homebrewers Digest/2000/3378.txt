Subject: sanitary welds


Tom,


I'm not so familiar with the beer industry, but in the wine industry all
welds are done internally.  An external "110% penetration" weld - looks like
it's been welded inside - is possible but usually only with automation.


The welds can't be porous, because the bugs and corrosion live in the holes.
The major problem with welding stainless is shrinkage - the current
generally has to be ramped down at the end to cool the pool gently, and
prevent a shrinkage hole where you pull the torch away.  There's a technical
name for this that escapes me.  Shrinkage is also the reason stainless is
better welded with a pulse machine.


The welds have to be smooth, so the trub etc can be washed off.  Again, this
is more important with wine because of tartrates.


The weld haze should be prevented by back-gassing, etching with hydrofluoric
acid or polishing.  The amateur won't get HF - it eats glass and just loves
the calcium in you're bones!  Again, bugs and corrosion live under the haze.


The welds can't leave crevices.


Good luck.

Subject: Controlling Oxidation - ??


Greetings.


I ran across something interesting while reading Evaluating 
Beer, a compilation of articles edited by Brewers Publications 
(NAYY, and the ISBN 0-937381-37-3).  The article is called 
Origins Of Normal And Abnormal Flavor, by Ted Konis of the 
Siebel Institute.  The specific passage that caught my attention 
can be found on pages 101-103, under the heading Oxidation.


The author mentions methods of controlling oxidation introduced 
into beer post fermentation.  Two options are presented, the 
first being a process called purging, where CO2 is bubbled 
through the beer, which of course causes a lot of foaming.  
The air is driven out of the beer and is replaced with CO2.  
But, the author warns that such rough handling will certainly 
affect the brew's head (it will be decreased).


The second option mentioned is the widespread use (according 
to the author) of antioxidants such as potassium metabisulfite 
and sodium metabisulfite.  He also states that many brewers 
have switched to the use of ascorbic acid or ascorbates as 
reducing agents.


Has anyone ever used either of these techniques to control 
oxidation in homebrew, or is this something that is useful 
only to the Big Boyz??


Thanks,

The name suits you perfectly mate. Do you have any idea how big a redback
is? We're talking about 1cm long, and that's a big one! The only people that
have to fear them are small kids and the elderly. I have been bitten by
these little buggers no less than 5 times, none of which required a visit to
hospital. Sure I felt a bit crook for a while, but it's not that bad. To
tell the truth, I'm a lot more scared of a brown snake leaping out of the
dunny at me, than some pissant little spider.Brown sankes are quite known to
do this.


The spiders that you have to worry about though, are those bloody funnel
webs that live around Sydney. One of them bites you, and gives you enough
venom, you're gone. We'll leave it at if the hospital is an eleven minute
run away, you'll cark it one minute short.


Cheers,
Dave.

Metal Fusion (makers of King Kooker), no affiliation and all necessary

for $15 each + S/H. When I built my system, I purchased 3 elements plus 3 needle

added an electric heating loop RIMS so I don't use the MLT burner very much
(Although I find it helpful to heat some water in the botton of the MLT - to
about 1 inch above the screen - prior to dough in). Your choice. For 15 bucks,
I'd go for flexibility.You'll need to plumb everything yourself, but it's easy.

One thing you should know: Metal Fusion does not accept credit cards. So you'll
have to call them, place your order, then send them a check. Once the check

If you re consider some of the quotes you maid in the post below considering
the other meaning of alkalinity it makes a little more sense.


Alkalinity other wise known as buffering capacity is the ability of a
solution to resist a change in pH. It is the same as the KH (carbonate
hardens predominantly made up of carbonate and by bicarbonate) in most
untreated water supplies but is affected by any treatment aiming to change
or stabilise the pH.


If you take this alterant meaning for alkalinity into account SOME of the
mistakes look SLIGHTLY less blatant. But only slightly.

Subject: Stupid Summer Brewer Tricks


   I must be repeating the same old mistakes.  Almost had another exploding
"summer" fermentation but I caught this one in time.  Last summer's
exploding stout where my 6.5 or 6.8 gallon carboy couldn't hold my 5.5
gallon batch of imperial stout was quite impressive.  Hops everywhere and
about a gallon of black stout on the rug.  This one was an 4.25 gallon IPA
(~1.065 OG estimated) in a 5+ gallon carboy.  I saw that it was fermenting
quite rapidly the morning after brewing and was in the high 70s F (~78F).
Yikes!  To prevent a repeat explosion, I loosened the airlock so that if the
hop pellets should start to block the airlock, the pressure would take the
airlock off gently rather than violently.  At least that trick turned out to
be a smart move as I found the airlock removed later that day when I
returned home and there were hops around the top of the carboy and next to
it.  It was a fairly easy cleanup and I don't think I lost any beer this
time.  I tried the wet towel trick on both batches but by then I was just
hoping to hold the temperature steady rather than drop it the usual 5F or
so.  The second batch was a 5 gallon strong ale in my other 6.5 or 6.8
gallon carboy.  Plenty of headspace for that one too and no problem with
blown off airlocks, but it did ferment quite warm like 80F or so.  
   My other two mistakes were not cooling some of my pre-boiled water in the
refrigerator.  I'm doing mostly extract batches where I boil 1/2 of the
batch and add pre-boiled water to make up the correct volume.  In summer its
hard to really cool off those worts with the chiller so I should have added
some of that pre-boiled water to the refrigerator in advance.  That would
have gotten my ferments down to the low 70s I think rather than the high 70s
to 80F!
   Second mistake was not watching my two boiling worts closely enough and
turning around to find a boilover of wort and hops from one of the batches
on the stove.  I should have known better.  At least I caught it in a
reasonable time and the cleanup wasn't too bad.  A "reasonable time" means
before the wife saw the mess on the stove.
   Now for the question,  I was trying for a little extra fruityness to the
yeast so I pitched some Munton's dry yeast in addition to my usual
Nottingham yeast.  Nottingham is fast and clean and I was hoping for a
little more of a "fruityness" from the Munton's.  Of course I realize that
mixing a packet of Munton's and a packet of Nottingham doesn't give me a
50/50 split on taste combination.  I actually assume that the Nottingham
probably ate up most of the wort because it is so fast.  So any thoughts on
what kind of flavor effects my warm fermentation (78-80F) should yield on
top of my Munton's/Nottingham yeast mix?  The IPA is reasonably hopped
(1.065 OG, ~50 IBUs) so I may not notice any subtle effects from the warm
fermentation but the strong ale is kind of a balanced hop bitterness (1.069
OG, ~44 IBUs), sort of like an extra strong Papazian Rocky Raccoon Ale.


   IPA (4.25 gallons ~1.065 OG, ~50 IBUs)
   ~6.6 # M&F extract
   12oz brown sugar (start of boil)
   1# 60L crystal malt steeped
   ~15 HBUs Cascade 5.6% (bittering)
   ~1/2 oz Crystal 2.4% (15 mins-flavor)
   ~1/2 oz Crystal 2.4% (0 mins-aroma)
   Munton's and Nottingham Dry yeast


  Rocky & Bullwinkle (5.1 gallons ~1.069 OG, ~44 IBUs)
   ~6.6 # M&F extract
   3# clover honey (at end of boil)
   6 oz Demerra sugar (start of boil)
   2oz brown sugar (start of boil)
   3oz 60L crystal malt steeped
   1 oz coriander seeds freshly ground
   1 oz ginger sliced
   ~14 HBUs Cascade 5.6% (bittering)
   ~1 oz Crystal 2.4% (0 mins-aroma)
  Munton's and Nottingham Dry yeast


Normal extract procedures for each batch with a concentrated boil of about
2:1 with pre-cooled pre-boiled water added to each to make up the correct
volume.  Rehydrated yeast before pitching.  Any thoughts on the yeasts?  I
had hoped to resuscitate some belgian ale yeast from a bottle for the Rocky
& Bullwinkle ale but it didn't take so I used what I had.

Phil, this pales in comparison to the bad blood between Canadian and St

gushing Fusarium-infected beer bottles that would only stop when one of us
is knocked senseless by a flying bottle cap, or screams "Uncle" from getting

Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where I'm banned for life for my repeated prank
phone calls to city hall asking to speak to Sue.


And speaking of Fusarium (clever segue to get this back on topic), is anyone
familiar with the current state of this issue? What crops are being
affected, what malsters are doing to ensure infected malts aren't passed on
to brewers (commercial or amateur), etc.

Subject: Re Sanitary Welds


Tom asked what defines a sanitary weld for brewing equipment and how
to describe it to a welder.


As he guessed, a sanitary weld is free of cracks and porosity that can
harbor bacteria and serve as an initiation site for corrosion. A
sanitary weld can be produced by any welding method, but some methods
will require more clean up and dressing than others. Shielded Metal
Arc welding (stick arc) tends to leave very rough weld metal and needs
grinding and smoothing to make it "sanitary". MIG and TIG tend to make
smoother weld beads and typically don't need grinding. Welder skill
plays a big role of course.


After welding, you will want to use a stainless steel cleanser to
clean away the oxidation/discoloration to improve the corrosion
resistance of the weld area, as I mentioned two days ago.

Good day all, I trust this finds everyone well.


I once lived in a municipality that had split drinking ages based on
sex.  It was though, contingent on the female being married.  This
allowed a 17 y/o woman that was married to a 21 y/o man to go into a bar
together.  I personally thought that was quite rational.


What I find quite irrational is that we have no standard age of
majority.  I mean one age where you are 1. tried as an adult, 2. can
sign contracts as an adult, 3. can fight and die for you country as an
adult, and 4. drink as an adult.

Doesn't seem that irrational to me . . . while seatbelts can hold a
driver "in the bucket" during a crisis or collision thereby preventing
them from bouncing off of other humans in the car and allowing him / her
the opportunity to regain control of the vehicle, helmets serve no such
function.  In point of fact, when helmet laws are repealed, reported
deaths and paralysis from motorcyle-automobile accidents go DOWN --
mostly because overall motocyle-automobile accidents drop by as much as
half.  What you can see, you can avoid!

detailed map of Australia.  If you Oz types would tell us where you live we
could find you on the map."  I've about worn out my map looking you guys and
gals up as you posted your messages concerning the details of brewing beer
down under.  So, a tally of where you Oz types hail from is in order.  The
results are;


Western Australia - Adam and Edward
South Australia - Thomas, Lyndon, Dave, Darren, tziersch(?),
        Brad and Peter
Queensland - Lyndon (seems like he's all alone up there)
New South Wales - Scott, Phil (& Jill), Regan, David and Graeme


Then there are the Ozettes that still don't tell us where they live -
Darren, Luke, Grant and recently Sue.  I'll excuse Sue since she seems to be
new to the HBD.  So it seems like there are more brewers in South Australia,
especially around Adelaide.  Sounds like a nice place.


In my Land-Of-Oz where Dorothy, Toto and the Tin Man once roamed it's high
summer and quite hot (37C) with high humidity, no wind and no rain in sight.
I was down in Lawrence, Kansas working on my son's lawn the other day and
after a few hours searched for a cold one.  I had given him a case of Wit
Beer that I brewed back in February for just such a day.  It was ice cold
and very refreshing.  One of you Oz posters mentioned that in your very hot
conditions ice cold beer is a treat.  I can relate to that.  You Ozettes
might want to brew up a batch so it will be ready when your summer rolls around.


Briarpatch Wit Beer 5 US gallons (you can do the conversions)


Pilsner malt    4.75 lbs
Wheat malt      2.75
Flaked Wheat    0.50
White sugar     1.00
        total   9.00


Hallertau Mittelfruh leaf hops  4.0%aa  1.0 oz  75 min 
Crystal leaf hops               4.9%aa  0.5 oz  15 min
Coriander seeds, crushed                0.5 oz  steep
Zest of one lemon                               steep
Crystal leaf hops                       0.25 oz steep


I calculate the IBU at 21.7.  I understand that you can't get
leaf hops in Australia for homebrew.  You probably will want 
to use 10 to 25% less hops if you will be using pellets.  This
beer shouldn't be real bitter.


Brewed in soft water with a little added calcium chloride
Mash at 155F for 60 minutes
Boil 90 minutes
Force cool


Ferment with a large starter of Wyeast 3944 Belgian Witbier
Basement temperature during fermentation around 60F


OG - 1046, FG - 1006
Bottled with 4 Primetabs per bottle for a nice, big head


Now, at 7 months of age it's a very good, refreshing beer.  Nice bitterness
but not overt and a nice flavor (sort of mildly spicey).  Has a very nice
aroma that I believe is due to the Crystal hops.  In other words, I think
I'll have another this afternoon after I put the bird netting over my
vineyard.  It will be quite warm by then.

Nah! The ol' brain buckets are a convenience for the Morgue. Yup! They put
what's left of most motorcycle accident victims in one compact carrying
case, and the face and dental work always remains intact for easy
identification. Kind of like putting stock brokers in a big zip-loc bag
before they're allowed to jump during a market crash.


Oh yeah: beer.

Well, David, just goes to show you that American Public Education
(government schools) truely suck.
Poor sap obviously didn't realize that the "imperial federal government",
his state and local governments, etc.,
would have a go at the first $400,000 or so... leaving the guy with a mere
$600,000 to spend on them
necessities (beer and women)...


Hope things are better with the tax man "down under", but if you're
successful here in the States,
the government does their level best to make you pay for it.

Subject: Ommegang Brewery


Hi List,


Took a day trip with the family this past Wednesday, and stopped in at the
Ommegang Brewery in Cooperstown on the way back.  They have a beautiful new
facility and it was a treat take the tour.  They are making their three
beers in as true to Belgian style as possible using an open fermentation in
a five thousand gallon tank.  Our tour guide did not have a lot of in depth
information to pass along but he did say that the yeast that they use does
well at temperatures around 80 degrees F.  Does this sound accurate?  I
questioned it and he said that they normally ferment at this temperature.
They apparently use the same yeast in all of their brews - Ommegang,
Hennepin and Rare Vos.  The Ommegang and Hennepin are both outstanding
beers while the Rare Vos has been toned down a bit for American tastes.
Disclaimer here....no affiliation, just a satisfied consumer.  Our guide
went on to say that the beer is filtered and fresh yeast is added just
before bottling for bottle conditioned beer.  The same yeast is used for
conditioning as in the primary ferment.  I am going to attemp a culture
from a couple bottles of Ommegang and see what happens.  Does anyone have a
favorite recipe for a Belgian white to share?  If this yeast performs well
at such high temps it would be great to use during the late spring - summer
months, or is this just wishful thinking on my part.  Any thoughts out there?

This isn't enough information to know for sure.  Ordinarily, wheat grown in
the Great Lakes area commercially is all soft winter wheat, although there
are certainly exceptions.  Hard whet is generally grown in the west, and
spring wheat in the high plains.  Sort winter wheat can be either red or
white.  I'm not familiar with golden - it may just mean white wheat, or it
could even mean amber durum (pasta) wheat, but I doubt it.  So my guess it
that you have red and white soft winter wheat.


Soft winter wheat typically is low in protein (<10%) and the protein, or
gluten, is soft - good for cookies, pie crust, etc., as opposed to bread.
This is also easier to grind and potentially better for brewing.


I have malted soft white winter wheat, but more for fun than practicality.
You can use it raw in any standard Belgian wit beer.  A typical grain bill
is 50% malted barley, 45% unmalted wheat, 5% oatmeal.  I've never needed
rice hulls.


For a really nice variation on the usual wit, try my ginger wit (recipe in
Cats Meow).  The ginger bite replaces the lactic acid nicely, and the
cardomom is another nice subtlity.


Hefeweizen uses malted wheat.

Subject: Musings From The Baromobile (Category Five)


With wings of great swiftness, I sped forth North in the infamous Baromobile
to visit the incorrigible Dave Lamotte of Newcastle.
With mobile drinking kit on board (actually I neglected to take it - much to
the disappointment of Regan as I sped past his shop with not a drop to
offer), it was a fast and furious trip.
"Lousy Arse" !! I heard Regan yell as I gunned the Baromobile down the main
drag of Clovelly.
Some 600 kms later, the Baromobile and I are home with two eighty litre
cornys (one is for Wes) and a few samples from Dave for us to test. I did
leave a little sample for Dave but he looked somewhat wary.
"What's this"? he asked, "a urine sample from those Boof Headed
Adelaidians"?
Actually he didn't mention this, but I am in the mood for incurring the
wrath of those South Australian twits.


Anyway Dave, as I mentioned, your offerings (though I am not sure I can
mention your wine in here) will in due course be soundly made mockery of and
reported upon by Wes and I on the "Baron's Of Burradoo Official Insult
Form".


I was hoping to provide an appraisal on a bottle of porter to the HBD which
the "now famous" Ray Kruse was sending to me many weeks ago. But I have seen
no sign of it.
Ray himself gave such a terrible report on his porter that I suspect he
chickened out and flew to Hawaii to intercept it before it got any further.
Either that or the Customs boys noticed an obnoxious odour coming from the
package and destroyed it.


Makes you wonder though.
If his skunk oil got through okay,
What the hell did the porter smell like?!!
