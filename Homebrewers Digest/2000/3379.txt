Just to add another variation on the recent N/A ginger beer thread, you can 
coat your walls with the following ginger bomb recipe:


Mix 1 tsp of ground ginger, 1 tsp of cream of tartar, and 1 tsp of sugar in 
1 cup of water.  Leave for 1 day.


Strain off the water and leave the solids in a sealed container for 3 days.


Then begin growing the "ginger beer plant" by adding the solids to 1 cup of 
water.  Each day for the next 7 days add 1 tsp of ginger and 2 tsp of sugar. 
  Stir.


On day 7, strain off the liquid and add to it 2 cups of sugar, the juice of 
two lemons, and 14 cups of water.


Drinkable in 7 days.


The remaining solids serve as the beginning of a new plant (which can be 
halved to make two plants).

Phil dost protesteth.


He reckons that the mere mention of his name should automatically award
category five status.


I will remind you, Mr. Yates, that you have previously posted some
information regarding the use of adjuncts that was clear category one material.


Mind you, you did rapidly regress to aimless meanderings about skunk
oil, and imaginary women.... but still.


Even Stephen Alexander has recently posted some info about no-sparge
that was dangerously close to category one, respective three, material.


So if any other of you leapards insist on shifting spots, I think that
it is only fair that you warn us.


As to the outpourings of Graham Sanders (from somewhere near where they
"can Cairns in cans"... humour only appreciated with a NQ dialect and an
autographed picture of Jo-Bjelke on your desk, and one of Flo's
lamingtons in hand), I can sincerely see the need to restrict Phil's
traveling, and require visum control at the border.


I would remind you that Phil and I have been planning a little "dive

Subject: Oxidation


Bob Poirier asked if any of us use "...antioxidants such as potassium
metabisulfite
and sodium metabisulfite." Yes, I do and many of the readership does as
well though perhaps they don't realize they are doing it. It's automatic
when a nicely sulfury lager yeast is used. The room with the fermenter
often smell like a paper plant (in the words of a guy in my brewing
club) and the result is a healthy level of sulfur dioxide in the beer -
15 to 20 mg/L at the beginning of lagering falling off to around 13 mg/L
after 6 months. (Note: metabite is basically sulfer dioxide in solid
form).  The fact that the sulfur dioxide level decreases but that there
is still plenty left after several months says that it is reducing
something but that there is plenty left to hold the beer in a reduced
state for a long time. I don't think it is a coincidence that those old
Bavarian Braumeiseters selected sulfury yeast for their lagers!


Lagers (at least true continental lagers for which it is accepted that
sulfur is part of the profile) prove the worth of reducing agents. Other
beers would doubtless benefit but I have personally never screwed up the
courage required to dump metabite or ascorbic acid into a beer (if you
use the latter you should use the former as well as the oxidation
products of acorbate aren't that nice so why bother with the ascorbate)
even though I keep both on hand. I use metabite in mead without
hesitation and could always give the vitamin C to the dog.

You will get many strongly-held opinions on this one.  Most of the fruit
beers I've had don't have enough fruit flavor for my taste.  Two pounds
of fruit per gallon should be a usual minimum.  I usually add the fruit
to the secondary and do a short tertiary to clear the beer.  I think
that one gets more aroma this way.  If you are using frozen fruit, you
probably will not have a problem with wild yeasts.  If you are using
fresh fruit, lots of interesting wild yeast may be on the berries. 
(This happened with one of my most successful lambics.  My neighbor had
many raspberry bushes and some wild yeasts had a good time in producing
Hoosier Lambic.)  If you are worried about wild yeast, pasteurize the
berries by heating them at 140-150 for 20 minues before adding to the
fermenter.

Yes.  Their beer (which I get to drink as often as possible) is very
Belgian in character.  There is some controversy regarding fermentation
temperature in Belgian-style brewing.  Based on what I've read and been
told, some breweries like low and normal temperatures and others like
the high temperature for the ester production.

Their yeast cultured when I ttried it.  I didn't brew with it.  I also
don't know which ones are single strain and which are multiple strain.


Here is a Wit recipe, Five Gallons, OG around 50.  Adjust for your
efficiency.
4 Lbs DWC Belgian Wheat
4 Lbs DWC Pils
1 Lb Oatmeal


Mash at 145 for 2 hours.  Infuse to 170 for mashout.  With my neutral
water, I use 1 tablespoon Crosby & Baker Water Crystals, which contain
gypsum and magnesium.  A little magnesium is good in some Belgian
styles.
Hop gently in an appropriate Belgian manner, perhaps 1 oz Fuggles/EAst
Kent Goldings/Willamette and 1/2 oz each Saaz and German noble hop such
as Tetnang or Hallertauer.
Some brewers, including Celis, use cascade.  (If I recall correctly,
Celis White currently uses Cascade as a bittering hop and Willamette as
an aroma hop.)


Near the end of the boil, add 1-2 tsp fresh ground coriander and 1-2 tsp
dried orange peel.  I'm sure you will get a million suggestions that are
better than orange peel and they are right.  (But that is what I had and
it worked fine.)  Ferment and bottle.

Subject: Helmets


Brewsters:


The subject of helmet laws always gets me extremely agitated.  I have (
had) a friend who was strained through the grill of a semi-truck and
another who went over a cliff, both with no helmet. The first, perhaps, no
hope, but the second one lived and his life has been screwed up ever since
by the dead brain tissue caused when his head bounced off a pile of rocks.
Both had high prospects - the first a multimillionaire with a beautiful
wife and kids, the second mid-career and on his way to a high level civil
service post also with a beautiful wife and kids. If you don't think enough
of yourself to wear a helmet, at least, think of the other lives you affect
WHEN you have a wreck and get injured or dead.


I suspect that, if true, the reason there are fewer deaths/accidents after
helmet laws are lifted) may be that there are fewer surviving riders. Ever
think of that?  BTW I find this to be one of those urban myths - a quote of
peer reviewed literature, please.


BTW don't ride your bike and drink beer ( there!) . I had another friend
who did that and took out a telephone pole with his Indian Sportsman,
luckily he only lost the vision in one eye for a while. But lately he has
been through many back operations.  I wonder....


Wear your helmets and leathers ( ever see skin and meat ripped off of
thighs and arms by  blacktop and gravel? I have. ) - don't be childishly
stupid!  


Keep on Brewin'

Steve,
    In considering Budweiser and Michelob, with exception of what I perceive
to be Acetaldehyde, these beers have a very clean palate. Are there any
suggestions as to how you avoid such off flavors as DMS and Diacetyl. I'm
curious if there are specific procedures that could be used during mashing
and boiling as well as during fermentation.


Thanks,
Dan Diana

Subject: Inline beer coolers


Want to finally move up to 5 gallon kegs and have the tap available in my
current bar layout.  I don't want to do the tap through the frig thing, as
don't have room for another frig in the bar area, do have room for a small
frig in the storage room which I could place on the other side of the wall
and run the line trough it.


OR would it be better to buy a water cooler, coke machine, or are there
other commercial inline coolers that someone is using for beer.  I would not
have the frig for lagering, but I do have a frig for that in another
location.  Are there problems with just cooling the beer inline?  I remember
in college, using the coolers with ice/plates, they seemed to work ok after
you got them running for awhile.


Any ideas or websites would be most appreciated.

Since you found Adelaide on the map Melbourne should be a cinch. After all
it has a decent population (read much bigger than Adelaide) and is home to
Aussie rules footy & Carlton & United Brewery (makers of VB & fosters)
Just look to the right a bit & above Tasmania (where decent beer like
Cascade & Boags are brewed) you find the state of Victoria. Melbourne is
approx in the centre east-west, at the bottom. Follow the bay around to the
west approx. 80km (towards Adelaide) & you come to Geelong. This is where I

Subject: spider mites


I spent three summers while in college scouting cotton and peanuts in
Southwest Georgia.  This job entailed walking through fields of these two
crops looking for critters such as Beet Army worms, Loopers, Cut worms, Boll
Weevils, and Spider Mites.  My job was to report back to the farmer their
general location in the field and their strength.  Spider mites usually
become critical during periods of hot dry weather.  They live on the
underside of the leaves and feed on the veins that carry nutrients through
the leaf.  In high concentrations, they will kill the leaf.  To find them,
look on the underside of the leaf.  They are reddish brown, and they will be
in large numbers.  They will cling to your clothing and can easily be spread
to other vegetation.  If you find something that is small and green, it's
aphids.


Here is a safe, environmentally friendly method of getting rid of bugs.
First boil four fingers worth of Red Man chewing tobacco boiled in a quart
of water.  Tie it in a nylon stocking to make clean up easy.  Mix this with
1 cup of lemon scented dishwashing liquid in 5 U.S. gallons.  Use a hose end
garden sprayer to spray everything in site.  Pay special attention to get
under the leaves.  The soap gives bugs diarrhea, and the nicotine is a
natural toxin.


Jerry Baker is the author of several gardening books from which I got this
recipe.


Hope this helps.

I've seen a lot of nasty stuff over the past few years & the alcohol-related
ones piss me off because they could have been easily prevented.  The funny
thing is that most people paint voluneer firefighter as a bunch of
beer-guzzlers!  If only they knew ;-)  I just bring it up because the same
thing is thought when I mention to people that I'm in a homebrew club.
Comments like "drunkards" and "alcoholics" seem to follow.  They don't
realize that I'm nuts about the process of brewing beers of different
flavors, aromas, colors, blah, blah, blah...  Drinking it is just the final,
confirming step of the whole process.  Instead, they just see a person who
likes to drink - in excess, of course.  I think it's really up to us to
paint ourselves as responsible adults to help change this poor public view.
No one else will do it.


I'm also sure that this thread has been beaten to death in the past as well,
so I won't make it worse.

So Ted Kennedy & Steve Forbes are your forces for correcting

So long as we all agree that no publicly funded paramedics or
ambulance services need respond to an unbelted driver
or unhelmetted rider I see no problem.  Roadkill is roadkill,
tho' I have some minor health safety objections to cannibalism.

This is about as "slick" as the Food Lion remixing rancid ground
beef with fresh to "remove" the off flavors.


Acetone is pretty solid evidence of a clostridium infection.  The next
product on this trail of tears is isopropanol. The same carbo utilizing
clostridium that produce these by-products may produce butyric acid, 
butanol, and acetic acid depending on conditions.  None very
dangerous to consume in v.small quantities, nor any more welcome
in beer than Jim Liddil's autoclaved fecal matter.


This beer needs to be dumped not repaired.  Heroic efforts to resuscitate
a seriously infected beer are wasted. I should mumble a few words about
pitching rates and infection but people with earplugs won't hear anyway.

So funny  Charley. I guess you've never warmed a slushy can or bottle
of beer or pop or made an accidental eisbock..


who says 'low beer content' posts are just for Aussies ?

I would imagine that the law was passed when young women only went out
under supervision, the idea being that men had no chaperones and thus
could not be trusted, whereas young women could be.  Lucky them.


IMHO there should be no drinking age.  If parents cannot control their
children then the law need not do it.  When they break a _real_ law
they should go to jail.  And it is obscene to allow a fellow to marry,
to own property, to vote and to be drafted and killed in some damnfool
war (yes, I know that the draft has been suspended) but not allow him to
have a drink.


Yes, I'm over 21; that fact does not blind me to the rank injustice of
our drinking laws.

Subject: Captain America


A little late, but I'm catching up on my HBD backlog.


Anyway, I happen to know Captain America's name in the flick Easy Rider.
It's......Wyatt.  It's mentioned once in the movie.  Towards the end,
after most of their adventures, Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper are sitting
around a campfire, and Hopper says to Fonda:  "We blew it, Wyatt."  Also,
in the credits, it lists:  Wyatt.....Peter Fonda.


And no, Luke Australia, his name was not Wyatt America.  Captain America
was just a nickname because he had stars and stripes on his motorcycle
helmet.  :)


And they didn't drink much beer either.  Mostly they just smoked a lot of
weed.

Subject: yeast in Chimay blue


Recently returned from the Left coast with a bottle of Chimay "blue". 
If I remember there is a white and a red.  Don't know much about the
details...which brings me to my point(finally):


Should I try to save the yeast?  Is it the same as the primary
fermentation yeast?  If I save it, what styles is it conducive to brew,
other than the obvious?


Dave Clark in HBD3378 answered part of the remaining question about
Ommegang.


Profiles and fermentation data would be great also.

Bill, I hadn't gotten around to replying on this one.


I currently live in Melbourne, but dare I say that I was actually born and
raised in Queensland. Not nearly as far north as Graeme though how is in FNQ
(far north queensland) so to them its no better than living in Victoria. Oh the
stgate rivalry.

Subject: The Rift 


Brian Lundeen writes that the rift between Oz and Yankee brewers pales in 
comparison to the bad blood between Canadian and St. Louis brewers!  His 
focus must have been on the big guys.  Based on the number of Canadians in 
St. Louis for MCAB, I'd say that relations in the homebrewing community are 
excellent.  We'd certainly buy each other a beer in Sioux Falls or anywhere 
else!

A couple of weeks ago I posted "The latest National Geographic has a
great, detailed map of Australia.  If you Oz types would tell us where
you live we could find you on the map."  I've about worn out my map
looking you guys and gals up as you posted your messages concerning
the details of brewing beer down under.  So, a tally of where you Oz
types hail from is in order.  The results are;


Western Australia - Adam and Edward
South Australia - Thomas, Lyndon, Dave, Darren, tziersch(?),
        Brad and Peter
Queensland - Lyndon (seems like he's all alone up there)
New South Wales - Scott, Phil (& Jill), Regan, David and Graeme


Then there are the Ozettes that still don't tell us where they live -
Darren, Luke, Grant and recently Sue.  I'll excuse Sue since she seems
to be new to the HBD.  So it seems like there are more brewers in
South Australia, especially around Adelaide.  Sounds like a nice
place.


Well William, being new I should have really told everyone where I 
came from.  My hsuband and I live in Bathurst, NSW with our two 
children Joshua who is 3 and Timothy who is 9 months.


My husband is in the local homebrew club, which is held about once a 
month.  The ringleader of the brew club is Brian Noyes.  Brian is a 
bit of legend for his homebrewing.  He has won quite a few contest 
and has also been in the Coopers Club newsletter on several 
occasions.  There is quite a few member of the club in Bathurst.


I am not sure is the club has a home page on the web or not, but 
Brian and his wife are dutiful.


Well, had better go.
