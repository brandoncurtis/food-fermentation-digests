     Rod asks questions concerning hops in the extreme,  having been
stimulated by Graham from the deep north...where the men are men....and the
croc's drink SP lager....


     Interesting to note a beer that was given to me for tasting `at` the last
Ames' Brewers' League meeting by Tom Vista, the "Hop God" of Nashville.
     Named "424," this brew allegedly had 424 IBU's within....a textbook
impossibility...but, having had it myself....I begin to doubt the texts....
     Destined to be a cult favourite, certainly a brew 99.9% of the planet
will hate, I loved it! Indeed, my homebrew club members seemed to feel this
was a waste of malt until, slowly...a couple of converts could be
identified...mostly by their requests for a wee bit more!
     And while the actual recipe is not in my hands, I can state that I was
told by Tom not only did he FWH, (with Centennial and Columbus?), he also
had hops in the mash, hops in the sparge water, hops in the starter, hops in
the primary, hops in the secondary, and of course...dry hops...but even hops
in the priming sugar!! Man, can you see that this is one fella with a
singular dedication?
     In Tom's defense, I can tell you, as I know some will bemoan his
exercise.....that I found this to be a grand beer....and while one can't say
it had all the malt to back it up, it was a delight to me.....then again,
just how does one get 300 pounds of malt into a 5 gallon recipe?  hehe....
:-)
     "OK, TOM...put the silo down, Tom...SLOWLY...that's it...just PUT the
SILO DOWN!!"


     Another GREAT beer brought back to the Ames' Brewers was an EXCEPTIONAL
Imperial Stout, brewed by Jack Adkins of the Capital Area Brew
Crew.....having aged in a Jim Beam Bourbon Barrel for 3.5 months...it was
incredible! Thanks, Sir! The club loved it! Well done!
     (Message to all that know Jack...get some of this stuff!!!!)


     Now, the next brew promised for club consumption is another winner...by
Chuck Bernard of Nashville. While the local brewers haven't had a chance to
taste it....(I devoured it all by myself!) I am told some will be sent my
way for the club....(hint, hint!)
     An OUTSTANDING Barleywine, I can assure you, if this beer ever gets
into a competitive arena...lookout...there's a BOS in the wings! Once
again...Well Done, Sir!


     While I am complimenting brews acquired at the NHC, and having followed
certain traffic on the web, I must state that whilst `at` NHC I drank Fouch's
Wit....it was pretty damn good!...
     My compliments.....you might talk trash, but you sure can brew....!
     Now, as for your girlish squeals.......I am sure there are 12 Step
Programs that can help....     ;-)


Cheers!

Dear Graham and Bill,


Congratulations Bill, you did provide some laughs, you're obviously not in
the IT industry or a geographer!  Your ESP is running pretty well though,
I'm in SA but rather be in Qld (put a dent in the winemaking though).  You
put me in both.  You forgot FNQ.  I know, have a few brews then write your
email.


Leland, 
legal drinking age in Oz is 18, I don't know when age 21 ended but it was on
during the Vietnam war.  But in Qld they ended 9pm closing only a few years
ago - but they've just left the stone (or is it Joh) age (see if we get a
bite). Rest of Oz was 11, 12 or 1am closing. 


Drink drive laws are pretty tight here, but it's all based on breath test
and blood test, none of this "opened bottle" nonsense. .05 and .08 limits.
Police do pay attention to "opportunities to indulge" here, so it's
necessary to be doubly careful at a festival.  Better to brew and drink at
home, or take your swag!


I went to Germany two years ago, and found my (I thought moderately
conservative) behaviour to be considered a bit raucous.  They didn't seem to
be into binge drinking as we are here in Oz.  Wandering the streets with a
beer in hand didn't seem to be the go.  Mt Polish-Australian countryman was
worse so I had some serious explaining to do, and did.

Q: When is a stupid brewer trick not a stupid brewer trick?  
A: When it is a serendipitous brewer trick.


I just finished kegging a batch of beer, and I decided to bottle 
a 12-pack's worth.  I used the sample pack of PrimeTabs that Domenick 
Venezia sent, but I did not follow the package direction (never done that
before;-).  In stead of putting the tabs into the bottles before filling, 
I filled the bottles and then dropped the tablets in.  As I was dropping
tablets in the third bottle, I noticed foam coming out of the first bottle.
 I quickly capped the first three, I found that I could drop the tablets 
into the filled bottles, place a cap on the bottle, and have a few 
seconds to spare before sealing the cap as the foam filled the headspace.
VOILA: minimal headspace air!

Subject: Wit REcipies


     I have been following the discussion about the Belgian Wit's 
     recently.  I think that most of the recipies posted used malted 
     wheat.  It is my understanding that UNMALTED wheat is traditionally 
     used.  This is usually in the form of torrified wheat or flaked 
     wheat.  
     
     On a related note; I brewed an ale with orange peel and coriander 
     and it had a really great orange(y) flavor and aroma.  It only had 
     one flaw, it was too bitter.  I tried repeatedly to duplicate this 
     recipe with no joy.  Anyone out there ever get really good orange 
     flavor/aroma with consistent results?

Rod Prather refers to 42 IBU as "quite a shocker". Not at all. My last
Pils came out at 81 (I assure one and all that I didn't plan it that way
 - that's just the way it came out). Now this is bitter beer but not at
all unpleasant to drink. Pilsner Urquel is often reported at 45 but
every time I've measured it I've found it closer to 35 and I barely find
that hoppy. Note that we are talking Saaz here in both cases so the
bitterness is "fine" and not so obtrusive as one might at first think.

Rick Pauly asks about diluting high gravity beer to get more yield from
each session. An excellent idea but the path to success is blocked by
one frequently insurmountable obstacle. When you take a sample of the
beer to check for the end of fermentation you will taste it and when you
taste it you may very well decide that it would be a pity to dilute that
lovely, rich spectrum of flavors. This has happened to me several times
for I try to use exactly this technque to squeeze an extra couple of
gallons from each batch. The main problem with the high gravity brews is
the high alcohol content (e.g. the last brew I did was a Weizen at 18P
that came out 6.8% ABV - one of those a night is enough for me) but
there are a couple of other potential pitfalls WRT to esters, fusels and
even diacetyl (this wheat beer ran about .25 mg/L). You shouldn't need
to worry about the addition water as long as its chemistry is
approximately the same as the water from which the beer was brewed. Even
if the water is highly alkaline, the pH dependent brewing reactions are
complete at this point though I'm sure pH has an effect on the redox
reactions which effect long term stability.

Subject: Some Questions


Hi guys,


I'm new here and this is my first post. I would like to make some 
beer, and as a start, I purchased the Brewer's Best kit with some 
pre-hopped Munton's IPA extract. My burner is a turkey kooker 
combination including a 28 quart aluminum stock pot and a 180k btu 
propane gas outdoor stove. Also included were a plastic primary 
bucket and a bottling bucket with spigot, capper, etc.


1. The 28 quart aluminum stock pot works well for cooking lobster, 
since we did 10 of them last weekend. It did leave a black coloring 
on the inside of the pot, which is probably oxidation. Should I use 
this pot for preparing and cooking the wort, or should I get a 
stainless pot? I can only use a pot that is max 13.4" in diameter to 
fit inside the retaining bars on the cooker. That limits me to a 24 
quart from the local bar supply for about $100 (Vollrath) or a mail 
order 27.5 quart for $100 (Lions), or a mail order 32 quart for about 
$221 (Sitram).


2. We have a home reverse osmosis water filtration system on out 
water, along with a water softener. The local water is fairly hard 
(22) and the softener is needed. I can bypass the softener, but it 
would also bypass the RO system, which removes the chlorine. Should I 
use the RO water for brewing, or the unsoftened water with the 
chlorine? Can I boil out the chlorine?


3. I have purchased an immersion cooler that consists of 25 feet of 
3/8" copper. As I understand, this goes in the stock pot and water 
runs through it to quickly cool the boiled wort. Is this enough to 
cool the wort in a reasonable time, or do I need to ice cool the 
water running through the cooler first? Local water is at 23C (73F) 
this time of year. Would it be better to add chilled (40F) water to 
the wort to cool it faster?


4. With the prehopped extract, I am afraid that the IPA will be 
under-hopped. Is it ok to add some pellet hops near the end of the 
boil?


Thanks for any help you can give.

Subject: Ommegang


I had the pleasure of visiting Ommegang early last week as well.  The
bottle yeast is the same as the fermentation yeast and same for all three
beers.  The ferm temp is 76F for 5 days or so followed by 3 weeks of
lagering at 32F.  Beer is run thru DE filter then yeast/glucose added back.


The spices in Ommegang are cumin, star of anise, ginger, coriander, orange
peel, and grains of paradise.  Hennepin has ginger, coriander, and orange
peel.  Don't remember which of the spices are in Rare Vos off top of my head
(haven't unpacked yet so don't have my notes)   Alcohol is 8.5, 75. and
6.5% for Ommegang, Hennepin, and Rare Vos respectively.


I was very surprised to learn that Duvel has a financial stake in Ommegang
as well as assisting with initial brewing.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!


Darryl Newbury becomes the second poster to miss my (I'm beginning to
believe opaque) sense of humour, and writes:


> I have to concur with Bob Boland's comment that there is absolutely no

Darryl looks like he came oh-so close to catching the fact that this was
also tongue-in-cheek by remembering:

So let's backtrack a bit and see how this all started. Grand Emperor of
Category 5 Phil Yates commented in HBD #3377:


>Swedish and Yankee brewers, well in this area I have detected a degree of
animosity.


Now nobody leapt all over Phil that this is simply not true. Everyone
realized he was referring to Dr Pivo and Steve Alexander (well, maybe a
handful of others). In my ongoing futile attempts to usurp Phil from his
throne (forgive me, Phil, I am not worthy) I decided to take this idea and
extend it to my little tempest with John Sullivan. Now as far as John
apologizing for misconstruing my comments about MCAB and GCHC and that being
the end of it, that isn't the whole story.


First of all, John also sent me some private e-mails on the matter and not
knowing John, I'm still not clear on whether he was exhibiting a dry sense
of humour or just being snarky with me. I couldn't pursue this by email with
John because my replies kept bouncing, probably because I live in one of
those eternally-damned domains that some ISP's block because our network
people allow bad, bad things to go unchecked. No matter. Later in the HBD,
John began sigging his posts with a reference to living in
"Comedically-challenged St Louis", or words to that effect. So I figured, OK
John's a sport, he wants to keep this thing alive, so I carpe diemed on the
rift theme and voila, we are where we are at today. I notice John himself is
being unusually silent on this matter, so I figure he is either:


a. On vacation
b. Ignoring me (yes, I know that if Regis polled the audience this would be
the overwhelming choice for desired course of action)
c: Stocking up on Fusarium-infected malt in preparation for a toe-to-toe
nucular battle.


To paraphrase Keanu Reeves, "There is no rift", at least not between Canada
and St Louis. Now, Winnipeg and Toronto, well, there's a whole 'nother
kettle of wort. ;-)

Subject: SF trip


First, thanks to all who gave me advice on pubs and breweries to check out
while in San Francisco! Unfortunately, my time was limited so I zeroed in on
the one common thread - "Take the Anchor Brewing tour." Great advice, it's
the best brewery tour I've ever been on. I almost didn't make it though, as
there are a limited number of reserved slots. Luckily, I was able to
sweet-talk my way in, phew.


Kendra, our knowledgeable and friendly tour guide, led us through the
facilities. They were filling one of the coolships at the time which was
neat and the aroma from the hop storage room was almost enough to knock you
out! The bottling line was running full-bore and was quite a sight. They're
running at about 100,000 bbl, close to their capacity of 130,000 but they
have no plans for expansion, rather they wish to keep it a medium sized
brewery focusing on quality not quantity.


After the tour proper, we adjourned to the taproom where Kendra poured
samples of the current beers, commenting on each one in turn. We started out
with the wheat which I was skeptical of at first, not being a big fan of
American wheats, preferring instead the more flavorful Bavarian style, but I
was pleasantly surprised by Anchor's rendition. It was crisp and slightly to
moderately phenolic with a very pleasant grain aftertaste, was quite
refreshing! Next up was their "Small" a beer made, as the name implies, from
the second runnings of the Old Foghorn mash. This beer comes only in 20 oz
bottles and was a nice quaffable beer. Then we had the always delightful
Steam beer which is even better than usual coming as it did fresh from the
tap at the brewery. The Liberty Ale was the best I've ever had - the dry
hopping really shone! I kept coming back to this one; hophead heaven! The
porter was good but seemed a tad sour, perhaps they were having problem with
their tap line? Then there was Old Foghorn, what can I say? A beautiful
blend of hops and malt in this excellent barleywine.


By the time we'd tried one of each beer it was nearing 5:00 on Friday
afternoon and many of the employees were coming into the taproom for what
became an extended happy hour. What a perk! It was great just hanging around
and shooting the breeze with these folks - they all seemed incredibly happy
with their jobs (big surprise huh?). Kendra said that there isn't a Siebels
or UCSD graduate in the bunch and that turnover was practically nil (damn).


So, if you're ever in San Francisco make sure you pay a visit to Anchor.
They run tours at 2:00 every weekday but remember to call well in advance to
get a reservation!

     Unless the pH of your water is absurdly high or low, don't worry.


     The only other thing you might want to consider is adding a small charge
of yeast, about 1/2  of a smack pack of something that flocculates well. The
yeast
will scavenge any oxygen introduced during kegging; your fermentation yeast
might be too "tired" to do this after a high gravity fermentation.

Subject: No sparge thoughts . . .


Hi folks:


Regarding Steve A. and Pete C.'s observation that sparge beers may clear
faster and be better in final
clarity than "no sparge" batches, I wonder whether this isn't just a
function of sweet wort clarity as opposed to whether the wort is sparged or
not.  Are each of you recirculating the first wort to set the grain bed
*before* draining the sweet wort out to the kettle, or are you simply
draining the first wort?


If you don't vorlauf (recirculate) for a sufficient amount of time before
draining the first wort, the grain bed won't be set, and small grain
particles will be carried over to the kettle by the first wort.  Any
unconverted starch in such particles will make for starch haze in the
finished beer -- not good.  OTOH, the sparged fraction is by definition
running through a grain bed that has been set at least somewhat by drawing
off the first wort, and so methinks you would tend to get more of the
filtration benenfits (read: less starch haze).


This is one of the neat things about a RIMS / HERMS system -- by
recirculating during the mash, the grain bed is well set and the wort is
brilliantly clear by the end of the mash.  For those of you who don't use a
RIMS or otherwise don't recirculate, here's a little experiment you can run
to demonstrate the value of this process.  Draw off about 1000ml of
unrecirculated first wort into an Imhoff cone, and let it stand while you
then recirculate for 20 minutes.  You'll notice that there's quite a bit of
sediment that settles out.  Return the sample to the mash tun, rinse the
Imhoff cone, and draw off another 1000 ml sample of the now-recirculated
wort.  Let it sit while you're draining to the kettle, and check the
sediment level after 20 minutes.  You'll see that there's a significantly
lower amount of sediment in the recirculated wort, which typically will make
for clearer beer.


On the other hand, if Steve and Pete *are* vorlaufing long enough so that
there's not a significant difference in sediment levels between their first
and second runnings, then I'm stumped.  Similarly, as to why sparged beer
would have a better foam stand, I haven't a clue.  Steve, perchance did you
run protein assays on the beers?  ;-)


All the best -- Louis K. Bonham

Subject: building a cold room(s)


Since I seem to be moving to a new land where basements are more than just a
fantasy I have been kept up late by dreams of my new indoor brewery and cold
room(s).  I would like to solicit comments from fridgeguy and whomever else
can help on a couple of points.


1) assuming I am willing to scrounge around a bit, what is the best cooling
device?  Window air conditioners, old restaurant cold room coolers, home air
conditioners all come to mind as possibilites.  The window air conditioner
sounds easy to find (Sears etc), easy to install, but expensive to run.  The
other two devices seem like they are actually similar except that I assume
the home AC has more cooling capacity.  Probably both are similar to
install?  From what fridgeguy has said the used cold room coolers might be
cheaper to acquire though.


2) has anyone built multiple rooms to have multiple temperatures available? 
I am picturing cooling the coldest one and using a small fan and louvers
like on a dryer vent to cool the warmer one(s) by exchanging air from the
coldest.  Does this make sense?


3) the commercially built cold rooms I have seen have corrosion-proof metal
walls.  I imagine dampness can be a problem in such rooms.  I think the
easiest/cheapest wall/floor/ceiling to be painted wonderboard (a sheet
cement product that handles like sheetrock).  Any comments?


4) What kind of R-value does one want on the walls and ceiling?  Obviously I
will use fiberglass insulation in a studwall, but I'm wondering how thick
the walls will need to be, whether to use rigid foam too, etc.  (Which side
does the vapor barrier go on?)  Also does one need to insulate a concrete
floor in a basement?  Is there a formula that relates surface area, R value,
temperature difference across the wall, and BTUs/hr to keep the room cool? 
Possibly this is the definition of R?  (Also, what is a "ton" in terms of
BTU/hr?)


5) any other ideas?

Subject: Mead HSA? (Category 7 - Sure to piss someone off)


Since a few brave mead makers have dipped their toes into the croc infested
HBD waters recently and survived, I figured I'd give it a go....


Trying my hand at mead after a long hiatus. I held the honey, raspberries,
and water at about 160-170 degrees F for about 30' as I don't trust
chemicals (sodium meta-whatever) to do the job when fruit is involved. I
know that boiling is bad.


Anyway, as I was ladeling the must (still hot) into the primary, recent HBD
discussions on beer HSA hit me like electro shock therapy. (Hmmmmm. If I
HAVE been bad I wonder if Jill has an opening in the next Cat-O-Nine-Tails
session.....)  Is HSA as big a factor with mead as beer? Am I screwed?
Earlier rookie mistakes taught me to pilot brew with something as expensive
as melomel. Only a gallon involved, but still, I'm concerned. Thoughts? TIA.

Subject: First Wort Hop bitterness/flavor estimation


Hey now:


In several recent posts, including Jeff's download of his recent talk on
CAPs (thanks, Jeff!) the topic of First Wort Hopping (FWH) has come up, with
estimations of bitterness contributed, etc.


Well, now I've been using FWH for a while, and while I have no scientific
evidence, I like the effect.  Unfortunately, I've been unable to estimate
based upon hop AA and boiling time an HBU contribution, so I just sorta toss
in some hops and hope for the best.


Anybody have a method of quantifying the flavor/bitterness contribution of
FWH for recipe prediction?


Please post it!


Cheers

they've ruined
    everybody else's lives.
3. rec.motorcycles

    sorry ... that's the same as numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7, and

Is there anyone else I can alienate?
