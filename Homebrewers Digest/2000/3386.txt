Subject: removing labels


Another poster referred to this, and I will repeat the advice.  Easily, and
I do stress easily remove labels by using a mixture of ammonia and warm
water.  Beer labels are mostly adhered to the bottles by ammonia based
glues.  After a few minutes (a homebrew or so) the labels easily slip off.
The only difficulties I have encountered is the foil type labels.  I simply
avoided those.  But all this is past history for I now keg my beer.


Best advice I can give?  Keg.


Cheers to all

Well, I feel pretty lazy in the midst of all these "Hard scrubbing" label
removers. I just throw a bunch of bottles in a big 20 gal. trash barrel. The
barrel is filled with around 15 gal. cold water and a 1/3 of bleach. Not only
dose it clean my rinsed homebrew bottles, it takes labels off with ease.
Granted, the bottles usually sit  for a few days or more(usually more-I said I
was lazy). but they just slide right  off. As for my regular bottles, they
come out sparkling. A note of advice though.. If you use this method to
de-lable more than 6-12 bottles, you might want to keep your regular stock of
bottles out. The glue on certain labels can slime the batch. Not a big deal
but I hate rinsing extra for no reason.

Subject: Dry hopped lifetime, dishwashing detergent fear


Brewsters:


Keith MacNeal has noted that dry hopped beers don't last as long as
non-hopped versions.  Not surprising, as the hops can contain bacteria
which can cause problems, despite the anti-lactobacillus behavior hops
resins exhibit  toward some strains. It is possible that that excess
fizziness you get is due to bacteria  ( e.g. L. diastaticus)  consuming the
dextrins.


Although some pooh-pooh the idea, I always give the dry hops a very brief
soak in boiling water and add the hops and hop tea, minimizing the loss of
vapor. This solves any problem in this area. Dry hopping works fine if a
keg gets consumed in a week or so of treatment by the landlord ( as it did
in Merry Old England when this method was used) , but long term storage
problems from infection can arise unless the bacterial population on the
hops are reduced sustantially .
- --------------------------------------
Edward why are you afraid to put beer in bottles you washed with
dishwashing detergent? Don't you eat off dishes washed with this same
stuff? If it is the foaming properties being affected by the detergent that
has you fearful, treat the bottles with bleach diluted by 1/3 followed by
rinsing with three rounds ( about 1/3 of  a bottle each time) of water
above 170F. This is how I always treat my beer and wine bottles before
filling. Works great!

Wow! So you like being referred to as a drunk because of your hobby? Fine
- you're entitled. But I certainly hoper you're not in the majority. The
point is not that we/I would prefer to make beer with no alcohol - though
the pursuit of that very difficult task does capture the creativity of
many on this list - the point is that we'd prefer not to be classified as
drunks simply because we are home brewers.


So I'm not "winging" - I am dealing with it by publicly standing up for
what I believe. So what is it you're doing? Poking fun, I hope. Sorry, but
in this particular regard, I have no sense of humor. I'd rather have
my brewery festooned in plaid than be classed as a drunk simply because I
brew.

  In July of 1998 Louis Bonham measured the IBU level of this brew
at 115 IBU's.  


  Since that time the overall hop character has mellowed considerably.


  Louis still has a bottle of this brew (now 3 years old) and has told
me that he still plans on running another IBU analysis on it.  It should
be very interesting to see how the IBU level has changed since it was
first measured.

Subject: Re;  Carmelization


This is in response to Patrick in Toronto who asked about carmelization of wort-


I have carmelized first runnings several times in search of the caramel
flavor that I perceive in Fuller's ESB.  While it does not produce that
particular flavor it does result in pretty good tasting ales.


What I have noticed is that the final SG is a lot higher than you might
expect from your recipe while the body or mouthfeel is normal for a full
bodied beer.


Redhawk Ale

Pale malt       5.5 lbs
Munich Malt     5.5 lbs
Cara Vienne     0.5 lbs
Cara Munich     0.5 lbs
Roasted barley  1 ounce


Usual mash at 152F for 90 minutes followed by a 75 minute boil.
One gallon first runnings separated and boiled down to between 
one to two pints.  This was added to the rest of the wort before
fermentation.


OG was 1063 and FG was 1027 using Wyeast 1968 London Ale Yeast.
The beer was one of the best ales
I've brewed and everyone liked it when served from the keg or
bottle.

Victory Malt    0.5 lbs
Special B       0.4 lbs


Usual mash at 154F for 90 minutes.  Special B added during last
15 minutes of mash.  Two quarts first runnings spearated and 
boiled down to 3/4 quart.  Added back as above.


OG was 1067 and FG was 1026 using Wyeast 1338 Euro Ale Yeast
and Wyeast 2006 Bavarian Lager Yeast.  Both FGs were the same.
Too soon to comment on the results as I've only recently 
bottled the ale and the lager is still resting at 35F.
However both tasted good when racked.

Subject: Mash parameters


There are a few things I feel are truly important in mashing. Whether
or not the recipe truly hits the style is something that can be tweaked.
But all mashes have a few items that are things that can't be ignored for
predictability.  Someone many digests ago mentioned that they (and many
brewers they know) have trouble making the same beer twice. That really
is a common thing I hear, but also I hear that people go to all grain for
the
added control it gives them. HUH? These can't go hand in hand! If you
have more control then why the lack of repeatability?
 Things that should be controlled:
1)pH -  The effects of pH on the viability and activity of the mash enzymes
           are of prime important. Hitting between 5.2 and 5.6 is easily 
           accomplished unless you are blessed (?) with truly soft water.
           But a bit of gypsum or calcium chloride will fix that right up.
           You have carbonate water and the pH is too low? preboiling with
           aeration will help that, so you aren't stuck with making dark
beers
           only. I generally shoot for 5.4 pH since it is midrange and
gives 
           a "slop factor" either side so you can error a bit and still be
           "normal." Too low a pH and you lose hot break, too high you 
           can get tannin extraction.
2)Temperature- The real nuts and bolts of the mash program. This
           maybe should be first but without the right pH, temperature
           control is for nothing.  Temperature regulation controls all the
           things important to beer style.  Protein degradation, maltose
           production, foam stability, dextrin levels all depend on
repeatable
           temperature profiles. This pretty much determines how your beer
           will taste and feel. No matter if you use a single combined
           maltose/dextrin rest of 15x F, or use a multi step 140-158 rest;
           the temperature makes the wort what it should be.
3)Time- The mash has to be 'finished', and only time will tell. A
multi-rest
           mash certainly needs specific time intervals to end up with
           predictable degrees of fermentation. When is "times up it's
done"?
           hard to say, that is why we generally rely on the iodine test.
People
           ask me, " I rested at 154 for 90 minutes, it should be done,
right?"
           I must say, "_Maybe_, what's the iodine say?" If you don't use
the
           Iodine test as your stopwatch then you can have problems. 
           Once the iodine says "no starch" in the free run liquor, it
is_very_
           beneficial to squeeze some of the grist and test the liquor
released
           from the sample again. If it shows black then you need more
time,
           and maybe some more step 2 -temperature.
4)Mash thickness- Grist to water ratio, this is last because except in
           extreme cases of very dry or very sweet/dextrinous beers this
will
           not determine the outcome of your beer. Some malts with low
           diastatic power (in the 60s) could give you trouble if you used
too
           thin of mash and diluted the beta-amylase but this would be
           extremely thin and you were trying to make an extremely dry
beer,
           the BA may not survive until the mash was truly finished. A good
           "average" mash/grist ratio to hit would be 3:1, not too thick,
not too
           thin. If you use a multi-step mash profile with boiling water
infusions
           then start a bit thicker than 3:1 so you don't thin it out too
much as you
           make your infusions.
  Everyone's mash tun has it's own characteristics so I've tried to keep
things general so you can find the right balance of these 4 things that
will work to give you contol over the mash reactions. The rules of
the enzymes are such that if you let pH, temperature, and time wander
all over the place the results will wander also.
Remember, this stuff wants to make itself, we just manipulate it to our
desires, and these 4 items are the things we can manipulate to end up
with the beer we desire. Ignore one of the parameters and the mash will
do what it wants to rather than what you want it to do.
  Someone can come out and say that "yeah, but if you let X increase you
can compensate by changing Y." Yes you can, but you will just demonstrate
my view that until you control these parameters, you will be chasing your
tail.

Subject: re:no-sparge foam/haze


Pete and Steve reply with some added data in regards to the haze
and lessened foam they get with no/low sparge beers.
>From Pete's description of his mash program I would expect his
2 gallons of batch sparge liquor would bring the mash temperature
close to my favorite mash out temp of 164F, depending on how much
liquor is left from the initial mash. Hard to say without a thermometer
reading though. If 164 is being reached I'd expect that there shouldn't
be any unconverted starch carryover, but an iodine test would say for sure.
If that temp is reached I also would expect a good quality foam retention
from increased glyco-protein production.  The evidence of haze and
lessened foam would _maybe_indicate that mash out temperature is
not being reached, an easy thing to verify and resolve.
  Steve said his haze was permanent. There are only a few things to cause
this, the most frequent being starch carry-over and biological haze. I
would
expect Steve to maintain clean pitching cultures and use reasonable
sanitation methods so  this makes me lean toward the starch carryover.
An iodine test here also would give some important data.
 Lower sweet wort levels of tannins would affect hot-break, but how much it
affects haze reduction would depend on the S/T protein levels in the malt.
The S/T figures I've seen for some German malts or pretty low, 36 or 37.
These may need a bit more tannins for full coagulation. But this would
mostly affect chill haze, unless the bitter wort was really loaded with raw
protein; most likely not the situation. Kinda still pointing at starch as
the
haze factor. As I typed up my other post I realized another possibility,
that is pH. If wort pH hits 5 or below then hot break is affected
negatively.
Is this a possibility? I assume ( sometimes wrongly) that pH is tested
on every batch, but sometimes people rely on the "it was always OK
before" reason for skipping a step so I have to ask.

Subject: mixing yeasts and new categories


It was asked about the virtues of blending  yeast varieties during
primary fermentation.


I would start by saying that this is an area in which I have not one
iota of experience with.  I would report, however, that this is a
situation that brewmasters that I know of in the commercial world, fear.
I think this is sort of based on the thought that blending two yeast
strains gives you the flocculating characteristics of neither (or... to
"number two"
it, flocculation depends on a surface electrostatic charge of the yeast
cell, and having two different charge sets makes things difficult). 
Worst case is supposed to be the mixing of top and bottom fermenting strains,
the results of which, I have heard from a German braumeister describe as
"soup", and is a reason most brewmasters don't want two working strains
under the same roof.


Where brewers do change strains in the same brew, I expect that they
either filter out the first one before adding, or wait until there is
sufficient clarity that the first one is at comparatively insignificant levels.


I would like to stress that this is something I have zero practical
experience with, and as such, am simply "rumour mongering"....maybe it's
not a problem at all.


Since Graham has already reserved "category six" postings to mean:
"Don't give my Cane Toad any stick!", then I suppose propagating rumours
would be a "category seven".  This is one of those.


Whilst on the subjects of "new categories" and "mixing yeasts", a
curious thing happened to me:


Some months back, I received a call from a stranger.  He said that he
wanted to create a beer of a particular region and time period.  I told
him what I knew about those beers, the barley they were growing then,
and that I have found extant hop bines from that period, and have brewed
with them, and which modern varietals they most likened... in short, the
first steps I would take.  I then asked "Where did you get my name
from?", to which he replied: "He said not to tell you."  I then asked
about what the brewing setup he was proposing to use looked like, he
described it, and I said: "Oh, "him"".


I then gave "him" a call, and talked about what they were planning. We
chatted about feasible approaches, and as expected, he did not want to
bring a new yeast strain into his microbrewery.  I suggested that he
instead do it with his present strain, but a rather funny fermentation schedule.


I have now heard that this beer has become a "big seller", and gotten
good critique from some independent beer reviewer, so I went down last
weekend to have a taste of just what sort of mess I'd caused.


I now understand the Rennerians and there quest for CAPs, ZAPs, KEBABs,
DOO-DADs, and all the other abbreviations I don't understand!


Imagine the number of trips I've made down to Czecho, each time
realigning my taste reference, and learning some new arcane tips, and
then returning home to brew, only to find that after a half year or so,
I needed a return trip.


It took me about 8 years doing this before I think I started to get a
handle on a Czech pilsner (though admittedly I may be a bit slow).  With
this beer, I was 100 percent correct the very first time!  I mean, who's
gon'na argue with me?  What are they going to compare it with?


I have decided that this is a new category called Swedish Traditional
Draught (STD)..... I figure that no matter what anyone thinks about it,
everyone who has ever had an STD, generally goes back to the same habits
that caused them to acquire it in the first place.


I suppose my assurance that I have defined a category can only be
compared with comments like: "The American IPA is really more authentic
than the British"..... right...... the arrogance of which sends me
spinning into the "bus driver" routine (for those not acquainted, doing
the "bus driver", is when you run into the toilet, grab hold of the
black ring, and begin twisting it violently back and forth as you lean
forward and say: "HUH-LAAARGGGH!". This coupled with the sound of your
ribs rattling as you empty your insides does sound a "bit" like a diesel
engine starting).


Quite frankly, I am the only one who REALLY knows the answer to 
the IPA quandary.


That's because I keep a stuffed mummified Gurkha in my closet.  I have
coat hangers jammed into his arms, so that if I've no one else to drink
with late at night I drag him out and prop him against the kitchen table.


After about 6 beers, he begins mumbling through his beard, and after 8,
I suddenly get a clear and exact understanding of Punjabi, and Mr. Singh
gives me the "low down" on what the IPA's were really like.


I would offer him a drink, but he dribbles so much, it is embarrassing
to try and explain away the stains the following morning.


Anyhow this STD was quite ok, and probably only needed a bit more
acetone (or was it ethyl acetate?.... sorry I haven't done "The
Course"....  And you all are worried about a wee bit of aluminum and
dementia risks?  You should try a weekend at Steve's, doing the
"let's-all-inhale-industrial-solvents-together" course.... you'll leave
there without a care in the world.... because "caring" requires a few
more intact neurons than you'll still have in your possession).


Well, I'm off.  Full of enthusiasm for my next non-contestable project.
I'm going to recreate something from the Bismarckian era.  These were
traditionally tasted by dipping the index finger in the brew, and then
"wiping" or "smearing" it across the tongue and lips...


yep, I'm gon'na make a "Prussian Ancient Pilsner", or, "PAP smear", and
want to make sure I'm the first one off the mark so I can define the style.

The Johnson A419 controller that Wil Kolb has is effectively the same
controller that I and many other shops sell (or very similar), without
the cord.  I have the cords to convert these.  I have several hundred
cords left from years ago when I used to buy the A419 from Johnson and
the cords from someplace else and assemble them.  It's literally a two
minute job to wire up the cord.  I also have the plastic cord collar
that snaps into the metal housing.  My cost was 3 or 4 bucks and I'd be
happy to sell them at that since they've been in the attic for several a
few years now.

Subject: Ommegang / Cooperstown


Last week I posted some details about Ommegang that I should have kept
to myself.  It has been my policy in the past to always get the okay
before making detailed information public about beers or breweries (such
as Celis, Budvar, fullers, PU, and others) and I regret that  I did not
do that in this case.  The spices that I mentioned are used at the
brewery and there is no secret about that.  However, which ones are used
in which beers is something Ommegang understandably would like to keep a
lid on.  If there is some good news it is that I made 1 mistake for each
of the beers.


It's not that far from NYC to Ommegang (3 hours) and I strongly
recommend the trip.  You can also visit the very impressive Farmers
Museum which is a kind of living museum of 1850's New York rural life.
The largest section is devoted to the hop industry of New York.  Before
Washington, New York was the center of the industry.  Lots of
information, old hop growing and processing equipment, and they even
grow hops. Cluster was the chief variety grown there in the 19th century
by the way.


There is also the Baseball Hall of Fame but it didn't look like they had
any beer in there so we didn't bother.

I have made a batch of beer from hooped extract. There is written only to

Subject: Please critique the six-pack I designed for homebrewers!


Hello fellow homebrewers,


  I am an avid homebrewer and recent graduate of the Industrial Design 
Department of Auburn University.  As a student, I designed a six-pack holder 
specifically for the homebrewer. I was frustrated with giving my brews to 
friends in an A&B six-pack which covered up my label and distracted from the 
beer I worked so hard to make.  A radically new and unique cardboard carton 
which showcases the beer is my solution to this problem.
  I call it the SLICK-PAK, and I want to hear from the brewing community 
about what you think of it so as to help me decide whether or not to persue 
my idea and have it produced.  Comments good and bad are greatly 
appreciated, and questions will be answered.
    The target price for this product is $27 per dozen, or $95.00 per 4 
dozen.  The SLICK-PAK is a innovative corrugated carton that will give your 
12 oz. beer the great presentation it deserves.  This is not a box or a 
regular six-pack.  The unique design allows 95% of the bottle to be seen 
including the label. The area around the handle is ideal for applying an 
advertisement or homemade graphics. A bottle is removed by ripping an 
individual "exit" through the packaging around the neck along a line of 
perforation. Please send me an e-mail if you would like to see a picture of 
my creation. Thanks in advance for any comments.




        Here are some questions to ponder as you critique:


    1. Would you be more interested if it held 22oz. bottles?


    2. Do you like it but think the target price is too high?


    3. Could you use them to organize unmarked bottles in your cellar?


    4. Would you like to receive these as a gift?


    5. Could it be good advertising for a homebrew
       supply store or a brewpub?


    6. Doesn't your homebrew deserve a great presentation?


Request a picture! Tell me what you think.

                                                Thanks,

Hello everyone.


I am looking into picking up a gott cooler for my mash tun. Does anybody
know where I can order one online? I can't seem to find one in any of the
retail stores in my area (Western Mass.). Also, what are people using for
taps? It seems that the tap that comes with the cooler won't allow me to
adjust the flow rate as much as I'd like to.


Thanks,

Only from trying to ferment concentrate weizen (wheat) beer with an ale
yeast.  Shall we say the "fermentation seemed to recommence" when consumed.
Didn't do it to me when fermentated with weizen yeast.  I will say natural
yoghurt makes it possible for me to eat muesli or pressure cooked beans,
maybe it will help Spence with his beer, and you can brew it at home!

Subject: Can You Over Hop A Beer.


The question was raised, can a beer be over hopped? Most wrote in responses 
that indicated that they cannot imagine a beer being over hopped (or at least 
not saying so) and started a chain of posts about beers with super high 
hopping rates. This subject has been a pet peeve of mine for many years, but 
especially in the last few when the attitude of "more hops" seems to have 
become an epidemic. I got into brewing many years ago because I was actually 
looking for a less bitter beer. What I found was a more bitter beer, but beer 
with more flavor. The light flavored American Pilsner style beers to me just 
tasted bitter. Bitterness was the only flavor I could detect. So when I read 
an article on home brewing in Easy Riders (in 1973) I started brewing. My 
flavor experience did not come from my own beers at first, but I started 
finding and trying beers like Bass, Guinness, Whitbread and Whatneys. Beers 
with flavor that balanced the bitterness. As I became a better brewer and was 
able to find better ingredients (especially hops) I was able to make my own 
flavorful beers. What I am finding now is that many of my beer recipes that I 
have been making for years and have always been appreciated are getting 
comments like "it could use more finishing hops". I have always worked at 
balancing the flavors of my beers and keeping the flavors appropriate to the 
style and now to get a comment like "needs more hops" especially in styles 
that should be lightly hopped or that shouldn't have any finishing hops at 
all, strikes a nerve with me. To go to a micro or a brew pub and pay for a 
bock that is over the hill bitter or a Scottish Ale loaded with finishing 
hops ticks me off. It's one thing if you're a hop head and just want to brew 
a hoppy beer, I'm not trying to tell a home brewer how to brew his home brew, 
but a I hate to see the results of a competition and see a winner in the ale 
category using a lager yeast or a traditionally unhoppy beer category 
dominated by overly hoppy beers that don't belong in that category. In 
closing I want to say that if you like it, it is not too hoppy for you. If 
you're entering it into a competition or trying to brew to a certain style, 
it may be too hoppy. But can a beer be too hoppy - yes. I have read on more 
than one occasions about hops having an adverse effect on sexual desire. 
Jethro Kloss wrote a book, considered by many to be the bible of the health 
food set, called Back To Eden. He claims hops produce sleep when nothing else 
will and says they are an excellent treatment for excessive sexual desires. 
So if things are pointing south when they should be pointing north, you may 
be a hop head and that beer just may be too hoppy. Imagine how much beer 
Miller would sell with a commercial filled with big macho athletes saying 
"more hops, less sex". By the way, you fans of aluminum in brewing ware 
should read the part of his book dedicated to aluminum cook ware.
