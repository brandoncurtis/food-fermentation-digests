Subject: Answers from Steve Michalak of A-B (Part 2)


>Hugh Hoover asks:
>
>1. What areas of modern brewing research are most applicable to home
>brewing?


A. Possibly the most impact will come from the research in developing new
varieties of hops and barley.  This is always an ongoing process to develop
better flavor characteristics, disease resistance and improved agronomics. 
 Each year farmers opt not to plant the older, less profitable and less
desirable varieties.   For example, as discussed above, we now have
well-modified malts that lessen the need for protein rests.


>2. What are the best lessons from A/B brewing methods that would usefully
>scale down to the homebrewer level? (ok, that you CAN reveal :^)


A. I like to focus on kettle boiling and yeast handling.  I've occasionally
been invited to assist some home brewer in their craft and what I've
occasionally seen is a rather poor kettle boil.  Usually the  heating
equipment just cannot deliver sufficient BTUs to produce and maintain a
proper rolling boil.  They therefore do not coagulate as much trub as they
should or evaporate the dimethyl sulfide (DMS) well.  See related answer
below.  One "trick" that can be employed here is to use high gravity
brewing.  If you concentrate your wort through mashing and straining,
you'll need less heat for the smaller volume.  After the
wort boiling, sterile water can be added to return the gravity to that
desired before starting fermentation.  


For most lagers, yeast are the principle drivers of flavor.  It is critical
to maintain healthy yeast to get consistent and clean flavors.  Yeast
health is typically proportional to one thing: how long has it been since
you last fed them.  Minimizing the time that yeast is in storage can
greatly enhance the taste of your beer.  If you must hold you yeast supply
for longer than 72 hours between recovery and pitching, you may want to try
priming the yeast with a little malt extract 24 hours before pitching.  See
note answer below on acetaldehyde.  


>Dan Diana asks:
>
>In considering Budweiser and Michelob, with exception of what I perceive
>to be Acetaldehyde, these beers have a very clean palate. Are there any
>suggestions as to how you avoid such off flavors as DMS and Diacetyl. I'm
>curious if there are specific procedures that could be used during
>mashing and boiling as well as during fermentation.


A.  Acetaldehyde (AA) is a flavor active compound that is present in all
beers.  Concentration in Budweiser are well below taste threshold which is
around 6-7 ppb, depending on the taster.  AA, which is described as latex
paint, pumpkin or green apple peel, is indicative of yeast abuse (not yet
and federal crime).  Healthy yeast will readily convert AA into ethanol. 
This conversion can be impaired if your yeast zinc concentration is low or
if your yeast has been mismanaged prior to fermentation.  To keep your
yeast healthy, do not store it for more than 3 days between pitches and
keep the storage temperature between 34 and 37F.  Additionally, if you age
your beer too long with unhealthy yeast, the yeast will autolyze and
excrete AA.
 
Diacetyl (D) is naturally created early in the fermentation and later
depleted by health yeast.  Cooler fermentations produce less D and warmer
lagering depletes it faster.  Additionally, pediococcus infections will
produce D several times faster than the yeast can deplete it.  The two
major reasons you find D in a beer is that either the beer wasn't matured
long enough or that the yeast, wort or equipment was contaminated.


Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS) is naturally occurring and can be minimized through
proper hot wort handling.  Near boiling temperatures produce DMS, which is
then driven off by kettle evaporation.  A good rolling boil produces more
evaporation than a simmering one.  Additionally, once the boil is stopped,
the wort must be cooled quickly to minimize more DMS production.  At AB we
follow the kettle boil with further evaporation through our patented hot
wort aerators.

>


A. I can't tell you how widespread they are, only that I know they are
practiced by other breweries, both domestic and imports.  At AB we take
advantage of the fact that actively fermenting yeast will assimilate oxygen
instantly.  Once the oxygen is removed by the yeast we simply (easier said
than done) prevent it from reentering the process.  We use expensive
tankage and pipelines that can handle ample CO2 pressure.  During our
lagering process, we seal our aging tanks allowing the yeast to consume all
oxygen and to naturally generate CO2, which is kept in the beer under
pressure.  This backpressure usually prevents any further
entrainment of oxygen (provided that we properly purged all pipelines and
receiving vessels with CO2 which is recovered from primary fermentation). 
Our beers are fully carbonated in aging and are moved through the balance
of the process under CO2  atmosphere and pressure to maintain the natural
carbonation.

Subject: 220v freezer & welding


Greetings folks,


 In HBD#3388, N.P. Lansing asked about the possibility of welding
copper to stainless steel.


 I can't say whether the two metals can be *welded* together although
I've seen some interesing combinations TIG'ed together. I commonly
silver-braze the two metals with good success using All-State No.155
food-grade alloy rod and their No. 110 flux. This is what I used to
attach fittings to my half-barrels on my RIMS.


 Also in the same HBD, John McGowan asked about the possibility of
just plugging his European 220v freezer into a 120v receptacle. DON'T
DO IT! The compressor will either trip its thermal overload or simply
toast the motor windings.


 Many US-made compressors are made to run at 50 Hz with reduced
output, including 230/240v and 460/480v models. I don't have any
experience with European equipment, but it is conceivable that it
could be run at 60Hz without overstressing the motor. I'd look at the
compressor's nameplate to see if it is ok to run it at 230/240v, 60Hz.
Contact the freezer's manufacturer if the tag doesn't give this info.


Most homes in the US have 240v at the main breaker or fuse panel. A
240v circuit can usually be added without much difficulty. A step-up
transformer could also be used. The cost of either solution may exceed
that of a replacement freezer, however.


Hope this helps!

Subject: 0,05 DUI


Mark (with increasing blood pressure) in Kalamazoo asked, regarding the news
that South Africa dropped its DUI limit to 0,05,


"Are you trying to tell us that the 0.08 limit was INEFFECTUAL in prevented
drunk drivers from causing accidents???  How could this be?"


Sadly our government enacts a lot of noble legislation that is not enforced.
If you are caught by an honest officer over the DUI limit, the penalties are
very harsh. However, I have only once blown into a breathalyser - despite
driving since 1987. I have also been fortunate enough never to have been in
an accident where alcohol has been involved - but there certainly drivers
are tested.


Most alcohol related accidents in SA are actually caused by drunk
pedestrians walking into the road.


However, whilst I doubt that the new limit will do much to reduce road
deaths in South Africa, it does worry me that our club members will now
drive home further over the limit than before. If by some chance they are
caught - the impact on personal life is harsh - particularly for guys who
are members of a profession.


Can I assume tacit confession on behalf of brewing clubs represented on this
forum that they allow their members to drive home over the limit?

Subject: The Perfect Mild






Stephen Ross asks for advice in making the perfect, big-
flavored mild. I made a pretty damn good one last 
spring by brewing a 1.085 imperial stout, fermenting it 
with the Wyeast Thames Valley yeast (I forget the 
number), racking off 1.5 gallons, and diluting with 3 
gallons RO water. This yielded a big-flavored 1.028 (or 
so) dark mild, a fine session beer.


This was a kitchen-sink recipe that included DWC pale 
ale, aromatic, Munich, biscuit, special B, 60L crystal, 
roasted barley, chocolate, and a long boil. (If anyone 
wants the details, I'll dig up the recipe at home.)


I bottled the stout a couple weeks ago, but the mild is 
long gone.

A transformer probably would work, but expensive.  If you can get 220 or
240V (and it should be possible just about anywhere now in the US), I think
it would run fine on 60Hz.  Not sure, but well worth a try.  Check around
the house, you may have 240V to your entrance panel, might have it to the
stove or clothes drier, do not just assume it's not there until you do a
good check.

        Mr. Babcock (who's posts I overwhelmingly find logical and
entertaining), you're making some mighty big leaps here...!  
        To wit: Are not blood alcohol levels determined by "scientific" 
analysis of objectively measured levels of impairment, than by a given
individuals/groups "opinion" of what constitutes "drunkeness"?  N'cest
pas? 
        That is, opinion (being inherently subjective) "plays into" or
even influences what constitutes a DUI/DWI threshold much less than a
demonstrable and quantifiable measurement of such a threshold.  Naturally,
the "opinion" of an Amish community on this matter is going to differ from
that of the citizens of Madison, Wisconsin, and to that extent, opinion
(both mass and individual) is a factor; but just that -a factor.  Not the
raison d'etre...  When it comes down to a matter of law, there simply has
to be something more compelling than "opinion" to drive legislation; hence
the scientific measure of ethanol impairment thresholds.
        Again, opinion DOES influence politics to varying extents; as in
the illogical and harmful concept of "dry counties" for instance (Hey!
Let's force people to drive out of the county to drink and/or buy liquor
when they have to drive _back_...).


> 
> Remember prohibition? That was based on opinion, too.


        Indeed, and what a success it was!!  Don't we all sort of look
back on that era -where no one really stopped drinking, where those who
lived outside the law profited immensely- with no small measure of "what
the hell were we thinking???"  And don't get (the HB digest) started on
how prohibition forever altered the American beer landscape!  ;-)  
        We may argue what prohibition was based on, but that it was a
monumental *failure* is incontrovertible.  Better for the law to be
informed by (i.e., don't try to ignore) a couple thousand years of
brewing, viticulture, and distilling than by the _opinions_ of a small
(but very vocal) temperance movement...  Agreed?

        Good luck to them!  I'm going to go out on a limb here and venture
that any re-attempt at making beverage alcohol illegal (here, or in any
Western democracy) would be all but an impossibility.  However, I see
where you're headed here:


> Sometimes simply making it inconvenient to

        Now were getting to the DUI/DWI question, which I believe is a
completely separate issue from any "thin end of the wedge" angle on a
possible return to prohibition.  
        I for one wouldn't mind at all seeing more draconian drinking &
driving laws here in the US; we've been killing each other on the roads
for far too long now.  Partly due to the whole American "cult of the
car" thing.
        I don't believe it correlates to an increase in per capita alcohol
consumption (maybe it does!), but if harsher DUI/DWI laws provide an
impetus to an improved public transportation system in the US, I'm all for
it...!!  And no, not so we can drink with impunity, but I think all
agree just a _few_ less cars on the road might not be such a bad thing. 
But I digress...

        Not really a "problem" I'd say, what with homebrew supply shops so
prevalent now...  Besides, anyone know how that case panned out in court?
That's what you DON'T see on "Cops"!  I'd wager a case of homebrew that a
public defender straight out of law school could convince a judge that the
local constabulary confiscated brewing, rather than distilling equipment.
The laws in a given state governing hombrewing are another matter.
        Let's not paint with a broad brush simply because an ill informed 
law enforcement officer sees a copper coil (wort chiller, wasn't it?) and
believes he's found a distillery!

Rather than perching on the pole, as Graham has done ( and a nice job of
waffling it was, congrats, Graham!), I will come down firmly on Pat's side
of the fence.  Image means a lot in the world, and beer certainly has a
low-life image compared to wine and other beverages, due at least in part
to AB's advertising.   I have no idea of how we as homebrewers can change
that image, except by personal example.   And I am getting pretty tired of
folks who upon learning that I am a home^H^H^H^H craftbrewer want to see my
'still' (I suspect this happens because around here there are folks
distilling their own spirits, and 'beer' is what they make grain whiskey
from. )


The oat beer I mentioned some weeks back is finished, and it turned out to
be much like a CAP, except for being way too sweet, because of the way I
dried the malt, and being fermented with ale yeast.  Most of the cloudiness
dropped out after 2 weeks of lagering, though.  In keeping with the recent
trend here at the HBD I  have decided to call this style a 'Classic Retro
Awfully-sweet Pilsner-like malt beverage', or CRAP for short.  Oddly
enough, I had no trouble giving the entire batch away to several friends,
who said something like "Yeah, it's pretty sweet.  Got any more?"  Perhaps
they are drunken beer louts, or just some of the legions of the
taste-impaired. 


On a happier note, I have been drinking my first buckwheat ale ( 10% malted
buckwheat, 90% various barley malts).  Wow , what a wonderful flavor
buckwheat adds to beer!  I just bottled a 50% buckwheat ale which promises
to be even better.  And my first experiment with home-malted rye is in the
primary.  I must have malted and dried it correctly because the wort
converted iodine-negative in 10 minutes at 149F.  Holy cow!  Even my 6-row
base malt doesn't convert that fast.


On the brewing equipment front, I made a float switch for my HLT from a
humidity control (don't ask) because I keep leaving the switch operating
the water control solenoid on and flooding my garage floor from the
overflow.  Isn't technology wonderful?


Cheers,  Jim

George asked for opinions on Malting and Brewing Science, Volumes 1

I have not read Hardwick, but I have read M&BS. M&BS are good, but it
is a lot of money for how applicable they are to homebrewing.


In my opinion, if you want a book that summarizes M&BS and is
reasonably priced, get Brewing by Lewis and Young, Aspen Publishers,
1995. It's about $40. It covers the nitty gritty details without
laboring over industrial scale practices like M&BS does.

Subject: Brazing Copper (or Brass) to Stainless Steel


Del asked what filler metal to use for brazing copper to stainless
steel.
Here is an excerpt from Appendix B of my book. If you need more
details, just write me.


"Brazing is like soldering but it is done at higher temperatures and
is applicable to more metals. It can readily join stainless steel to
copper, brass, or itself, and is an alternative to welding. The
recommended filler rod for brewing service is AWS type BAg-5, and its
brazing temperature range is 1370-1550F (743-843C). While brazing
can provide a stronger joint, the high brazing temperatures can be bad
for stainless steel. At those temperatures, carbon in the stainless
steel can form chromium carbides which takes the chromium out of
solution, making the steel non-stainless near the joint. This area is
prone to rust and cracking after it is in service. The problem cannot
be fixed by re-passivation so it is best to avoid excessively heating
the parts during the braze and keep the total time at temperature to
four minutes or less. Propane torches are usually not adequate for
brazing. You will need to use MAPP gas or acetylene."

Subject: Tankless Hot Water Heater


        On TLC last night on the Michael Holigan show they did a 
piece on the SETS system.  What it was is a three element system that 
heated the water as is went past and eliminated the need for a 
holding tank.  You could turn on your hot water for as long as you 
want and not run out of hot water.  (Can you see where I'm going with 
this yet?)  What I was thinking was instant sparge water/tank filler. 
This could eliminate the time taken to heat mash/sparge water and 
make brews quicker.  So I went to the web site and found the unit and 
it sells for about $400-$500!  (Not that I was going to buy one 
anyway)  So now I'm thinking about how to make one and what the 
parameters would be.  Any thoughts?

Subject: Mash temps, times and such.


        Can anyone out there give a good explanation of mash temps 
and times and such?  I've read just about every book I can get my 
hands on and it seems that nobody does a good enough job for me. 
What I'm interested in is: What if you mash at 148 for 45 min then at 
155 for 45min, would it make a difference if you did a 148 for 120min 
and a 155 for 45?  Would the Beta A take care of everything and leave 
nothing for the Alpha A?  I thought (and I've been wrong once or 
twice) that the Beta A broke things down further than the Alpha A 
does, so are there so many starches to be broken down and depending 
on the times at what temps would give a fermentable/dextrin ratio? 
In turn wouldn't that mean that there would be a maximum amount of 
time you could mash and the rest after that would be a waste of time? 
Any Ideas?

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


My! I seem to have stirred up a hot-bed of opinion on opinions! I've got

OK. So play along with me here. DUI level is set to some number through
testing.  Scientifically chosen, right? Through the "ounce of liquor,
drive the slolem track" test, or various others, right? So, then, with all
this good scientific testing and results reporting, just what is
continuously driving communities to lower the limit? Why isn't the limit
the same universally? Betcha a buck it's the OPINION that "Gee! That must
not have been low enough because drunk driving incidents did not
decline..." Or is it all just bad science? (Or is it that no matter how
low you make the number, the ones causing the incidents will still drink
and drive? Got me stumped here.) Even if it is a regional issue (perhaps
the people in Arkansas are more easily tossed into a stupor or those in
Michigan are fatter from all that cold weather and can tolerate higher
levels), there should be some rhyme or reason to the way the numbers fall
out - but there isn't. The selection of the DUI level seems pretty
arbitrary when you look across the board. Ansd wait until the laws become
so draconian that you have to travel with stinking breath rather than risk
blowing Listerine fumes into that meter. Or how a bout a level in which
the banana, source of potassium and naturally occuring alcohol pushes your
blood over that precarious edge. Hmmm....

You had a leap, now we have a stretch :-) I don't believe I ever once said
that the opinion was raison d'etre. Mais non! Absolulement mairde du
vache! (My apologies to true francophones...). I said that the opinion is
damaging and many things come about based on opinion. I wonder what the
more compelling thing than "opinion", religious or otherwise, that make it
illegal in some states to engage in sex in positions other than
missionary? What is the compelling reason that barbers should not operate
their shops on Sundays? Or that alcohol cannot be sold between the hours
of 2 am and noon on Sunday? THere are many examples of laws enacted
because of nothing more compelling that popular opinion - or even the
opinion of just one.

But does the failure of prohibition invalidate the point that it was
enacted on little more than a groundswell of popular opinion from vocal
special interest groups? Others had the opinion that they wouldn't be
affected (beer industry, for example), so sat quietly by until it was too
late. Opinion, in the hands of the untrained, is a very dangerous
thing. And I'm aware of no training mandated for its use.


Yes. It's be great if politicians could bring themselves to ignore popular
OPINION. (Doh ! There it is again!) Unfortunately, we don't have pointy
ears and eybrows and wander the surface of the planet Vulcan. Without
popular opinion and special interest groups, there's just not a whole lot
a politician can do to gain votes... Sort of a catch 22.

Hmmm. How about suing the alcohol industry. Worked for tobacco. They've
started on the gun makers. There are many ways in which one can get to
their ends. Prohibition was an attempt to do it through the law. Other
methods exist through USING the law.

It is/was intended as a means to verify, objectively, intoxication. In
it's ever-dwindling state, it is being manipulated to the extent that
those enjoying the surroundings of their favorite saloon had better find a
room upstairs. It's original intent has been mooted by the new puitrpose -
to use the law to gain one's own end.

Yes. Millions didn't see that the gentleman was a homebrewer and not a

And let's not also forget that that incident was broadcast on the FOX

spreading the ill-informed enforcement officer's actions to millions with
no later retraction. And what of the reruns? We learn through

Eh?!? Back atcha. What I was saying here is that the opinion that I am
simply "whinging" is ineffectual. Dave's comments are cogent and distilled
to: "I drink as much as I want and care not what others call me". Bully
for Dave. On an individual level, this is fine. I don't think it is as a
class, though. 


Graham's comments were particularly cogent (and no worries, mate: no one
has ever been thrown off the Digest for whatever reason. Hell! I'd
probably have been the first, if we had such policy...) and does point
out that in different cultures words have different meaning (though, I
must point out that the letter to which I reacted was sent into the US,
assumedly using the AHA club list to target brew clubs. The field of
Global Marketing insists you become aware of the culture in your targetted
markplace in order to survive. When in Rome...). 


And Phil is.... well, Phil :-) Phil does point out that the term drunk is
loosely defined at best and derogatory in general - else he wouldn't
complain about being oft mistaken for one.


So what'd I miss?

Subject: 220V Freezer questions and malo


John,


Your 220V freezer won't like 110V at all.  From dead cold (or should I say
warm) it may start, but the moment the gas pressure builds up to provide
cooling the compressor will stall.  For my various sins I worked for Email
Woodville, an airconditioner and refrigerator producer, and one of the tests
was a low voltage start, once warm.  Below about 190V forget it.  


Don't get too concerned about the frequency if you can lay your hands on a
tranny, though your electricity bills may take off (but who cares about the
Greenhouse Effect?).  Motor windings are inductive, so draw lower current at
higher frequency.  We get a bit nervous over here, running 60Hz things on
50Hz on the odd occasion.  May be cheaper to get a fridgy to slap a new
compressor in the old fridge.


Wendell,


In this lovely land downunda we get to make real red (and white) wine! I'm
drinking Cab Sauv 2000 already, yum. Malo is a bit hit and miss.  Three ways
to go with the real thing - add a malo culture and make sure it happens, keg
it for ages to allow it to happen when it feels like it, or test (refer
Aussie text Rankine).  Otherwise your wine may undergo a malo in the bottle
 - and you better have tied down your corks and used strong bottles!  I did a
Pommy kit red wine once that blew the corks.


Go with the malo culture if you have it.  Forget about thinking you are
doing a real red wine, you're not plunging the cap (of skins) twice daily
and trading high temp colour extraction for low temp aroma retention, or
tannin for colour.


High surface area oak shavings are added at primary because the yeast kills
any bugs you will introduce.  The shavings you have may or may not be
toasted.  Oak must be the right variety and properly toasted to give the
real vanilla sensations.  Umm, I think American oak is preferred for Cab
Sauv so you're probably in the right place.  Oak barrels, chips or boards
are used at the later phase you've mentioned, not shavings.


Your concentrate white wine probably had all the protein and pectin treated
to prevent haze, so probably needed little racking.  Bentonite in your can
red will pull out any solids faster, and will do no harm.  Reds are a little
more complex, but more robust.


Enjoy and dream you're using real McLaren Vale or Barossa Valley grapes like
I do!
