Subject: Building Backyard Bathyspheres In Burradoo


With respect to Phil's beatutifully alliterated subject line...


>Let's say you have gassed your beer up at 30psi, rather overdone to be
sure.
>Sitting in our bathysphere, Jill struggles on the external billows until

>What has happened to our beer?


It should still be sitting in your keg a 30 psi waiting for you to drink it.
It should not be flat because your CO2 regulator & gague measure the
pressure with respect to normal atmospheric pressure (which we'll assume to
be 1 ATM = 15 psi).  Now I don't know what your hypothetical bathyshpere is
measuring: pressure with respect to 1 ATM or to vacuum?  If it's calibrated
to a vacuum, 30 psi on the bathy gague would really be 15 psi above
atmospheric, thereby giving you a net of 15 psi on your beer.  So your beer
should be nicely carbonated when you go to dispense it.  If it's calibrated
with respect to normal atmospheric (1 ATM) , sorry, your beer will be at the
same pressure as the bathy and you'll need gravity or a straw to help
dispense your flat beer.


>Conversely, Wes and I enter the chamber with our CO2 regulator carefully
set

>"what is now the reading on the CO2 regulator"?


Well, you ask a loaded question...  It should still read about 15 psi since
the CO2 gague should be calibrated to normal atmospheric pressure, plus you
gave a rigid wall container (also assuming an SS corny keg, here) which
won't expand under the vacuum to equalize the prerssures.  So your beer will
still be 15 psi above atmospheric, which equals 30 psi above vacuum.  Since
the bathy is at vacuum (15 psi below atmospheric) that gives you a net delta
of 30 psi.  Alas, your last beer and it will be all head!  Unless you vent a
little CO2...


Moral of the story:  Don't drink beer in a bathysphere with Jill at the
pressure controls -  and most especially if Phil is wearing her new dress!
Please note: This is just based on my rudimentary knowledge of how pressure
gagues & spring/diaphragm regulators work.  I worked for a welding supply
company for a couple of years, but we were not in the routine of doing
undersea welding or providing O2 gauges to airlines ;-)  Someone's gonna

Subject: Alpha and Beta Amylase and Reverse Mash?


        First let me say Big Up's to Dave Burley and John Palmer for 
trying to tackle the questions that I posed a few digests ago.  I 
still think that the questions (or their spirit) has not yet been 
addressed.  Let me try to rephrase them a little better.


        As Dave said "Brad, from your question, I assume you don't 
understand that by-in-large
the beta breaks down the products of the alpha amylase's action on starch.
These are sequential actions. Beta, therefore, produces glucose from the
shorter chain carbohydrates  produced by the alpha acting on the starch."


        Well Dave I did in fact know this and was the basis of my 
question.  Since the optimal range for Beta is 131-150 and and Alpha 
is 154-162 and Beta works off of Alpha's products it seems that this 
reaction is not very efficient in a middle temp range, say 152.  If 
you were mashing to get a more fermentable wort at say 149 or lower 
then you would have limited Alpha activity and since the products of 
an Alpha's reaction is the substrate for the Beta's reaction the it 
would be the limiting factor.  So.... Wouldn't it make more sense if 
you  where trying to make a more fermentable wort to first mash at a 
temp that would favor the activity of Alpha Amylase and then lower 
the temp to reach the level of fermentability with Beta Amylase? 
(but not to high a temp to denature the Beta)  In affect you could do 
a 155-145 or a 155-145-160 to get maximum activity and better 
control.  Who knows, it might even be faster to use the optimal 
ranges for each enzyme than to shoot for the middle and go slower.


        I hope this makes more sense now.  Let me reiterate:  How is 
it that a lower temp rest (145) can be too useful if the substrates 
for it are from a reaction of a higher temp?  (Yes I know that there 
is still some activity at lower temps)


Thanks once again,


Brad

Graham Sanders wrote:
>>"I always have a quite shudder everytime I hear the term 'homebrew'.
>>Even people who make wine dont say they home-wine.  The term homebrew

Graham provded me a valuable insight regarding the use of the term
"homebrew"  To the un-schooled, the word sounds terrible.  The marketing
department needs to work on it.  Remember that old Saturday Night Live
bit of that played off the Smuckers jelly commercials and went of to say
"with a name like "Monkey Vomit", it has to be good?"  No wonder the
industry is in a downturn.


Pat Babcock made an interesting point regarding the stereotype of beer
drinkers.  Personally, I have a high-brow, condescending, snobby,
anti-"yobbo" (I don't know what it means - but I really like that word)
approach to beer and I get annoyed at people's assumption that because I
brew,  I drink a lot.


However, the stereotype of guzzling beer drinkers is here to stay due to
a fundamental reason that is taught in economics 101 -- low barriers to
entry.  Beer is the cheap swill of the masses (and marketed as such) and
I seriously doubt that anyone can change it.  If wine was as cheap as
Budweiser and marketed as such, it would have an image problem too.

Subject: Big-flavored mild


Stephen Ross asked for a recipe for a flavorful mild.  I designed the 
following recipe after reading Wheeler and Protz's book, Brew Your Own 
British Real Ale.  I determined which ingredients (and amounts) were common 
to all recipes, and which were optional, and devised the following (which 
tastes pretty darn good IMHO):


Mark's Mild (5 gallon all-grain)
5 lb. British pale ale malt
7 oz. crystal malt
3 oz. chocolate malt
2 oz. black malt
1 oz. roasted unmalted barley
3 oz Belgian special B malt
4 oz. wheat flour (torrified wheat would be better)
1 oz. Challenger hops (UK 8.2%)  Boil 90 min.
1/4 oz. Fuggle hops (UK 5.1%)  Boil 90 min.
3/4 oz. Fuggle hops (UK 5.1%)  Boil 15 min.
1 t Irish moss  Boil 15 min.
Wyeast #1098 British Ale


Mash in 3 gal. of 152 degree H2O for 90 min.
Sparge with 4 gal. 170 degree H2O
Boil for 90 min.


O. G. 1.033
F. G. 1.005


This was my first attempt at a mild; my second all-grain beer.  It is easy to 
drink, yet packed with flavor.  The 1098 yeast lends a fruitiness (veddy, 
veddy British).  A crisper version could be made using 1028 or 1056.


Hope this helps.  Enjoy.

Here's a good question for the brewing collective:  I
need to drop a bug bomb in what is currently my
fermentation room (although my roommate insists on
calling it the "living" room for some odd reason). 
Currently, all that is fermenting (well actually,
aging) is this year's 6 gallon batch of mead.  I've
got airlocks (dancing hats) installed, and am
wondering if I'm going to cause any big problems with
my mead?  Private emails ok, but if you wish to make a

Subject: Quick-Drafting Bottles?


Folks,


     For the first time in a long time I'm bottling instead of
kegging, because I want to give a couple cases of homebrew to a friend
who's going on a trip, to be given out as gifts.  However, this is
complicated by two little details.  


     One, the trip is happening seven days from now (six by the time
this gets posted and I receive replies :-).  As I recall  natrual
carbonating in bottles takes about two weeks to mature.  


     Two, the beer is currently in a ten gallon keg which my brother
quick-drafted with CO2, and apparently he over-carbonated it.  So I'm
faced with the predicament of trying to uncarbonate it so I can
transfer it to bottles and then try to recarbonate it.


     I guess I'm asking, is there any way to 


a) transfer the beer from keg to bottles without giving it a chance to
foam up, and ideally preserve some of the carbonation, or


b) decarbonate the beer quickly (other than by repeatedly venting CO2,
shaking it up, venting more, waiting for the mix to stabilize, etc?) and


c) speed the natural carbonation process?


     I know, I know, it's a messed up situation, but I thought I'd
bounce it off the list and see if anybody knew of any quick & dirtty
tricks to try.

I was wondering if anybody out there has used this

Subject: Malt Liquor


I believe (not positive) that malt liquor is a derivation of one 
of the alternative names used by German non-beer makers.  


Since beer by Reinheitsgebot can only contain water, hops, malted barley
and yeast, classifications are given for other classes of "beer".  
In Germany, Malt liquor is usually  classified as beers using other grains 
(unmalted) and/or sugar adjunts with barley malt as a basis. These beers 
are typically quite high in alcohol content but the ingredients are what 
makes the rule.  Weiss is another of these altenative names that is a 
result of the beer purity law of 1512.  Since malted wheat is used, beer 
was not an acceptable name.  


In the US, malt liquor is used to define beer above a certain alcolol 
percentage.  Typically this percentage is 8.2% or 9.2%.  Likewise, some 
states used to require beverages containing between 6.2 and 9.2 to be 
labeled as "ales".  I prefer the german classification myself.

My neighbor and I was talking about "Malt Liquor" over the weekend.  I

however, in the new one it looks like it has been removed.  Does anyone know 
why AHA/BJCP removed it?

Brewers sometimes do use it to mean just that, but some state liquor laws
use the term to refer to strong beers, typically over 6% abv or so.  While
some fine beers fall into this category, the typical mega-brewery's malt
liquor will be a cheap, strong, high sugar adjunct/low malt, low hops beer
sold in 40 oz. containers and marketed in what I consider to be a socially
irresponsible manner, despite their "Enjoy our product responsibly" slogans.

   That was pretty much what I was alluding to in one of the earlier posts;

On the refermentation after the use of sorbate; it could be that the
Sorbistat was out and out bad. If exposed to sunlight it breaks down
rather quickly, on the order of 6 months. If the store keeps it on the
shelf and not in the cooler this could be the problem. In addition if not
used with metabisulphite the malic acid can go through a
malo-lactic fermentation in the bottle; in the presence of sorbate
a distinctively gross geranium smell/flavor results. If no such smell
happened then the sorbate was probably bad.

What kind of aromatic character should I expect?


Just about all the different hop varieties that I have

that doesn't mean that they will make my beer smell good

I think hybrid maize is often sterile.  Why not use seed maize, as long as
it isn't treated with pink mercuric fungicide?  Or find someone who is
growing old fashioned open pollinated maize.


>There was a huge amount of hot break. Like a big oil slick!!


I think of hot break as normally referring to coagulated proteins.  Was
this like that, or was it actually oil?  There certainly could have been a
fair amount of corn (maize) oil.  I think I'd remove it too.


You didn't say what percentage of maize you used.  I assume something like 25%?

Subject: more gelatinization


Dave B. writes...


"Remember that Bud does a cereal mash to gelatinize the
adjuncts and like
the Germans doing a decoction has starch available at a low
( below 149F)
temperature ( their glucose hold) from the boiling of the
malt. My point
is, if the starch is available  (gelatinized)  it can be
converted at a
lower temperature than 149F. As this was one of my points,
we agree.


I agree starch gelatinization is not a hard fast number, but
I recall
barley starch is most often given as 149F. Now maybe this is
not the starch
in the malt, although I have always assumed so. Amylopectin
and amylose
undoubtedly have different gelatinization temperatures."




Dave is pretty well spot on here but it requires a bit o'
clarification.  Gelatinization does not occur all at once,
it's true.  Starch being loosely crystalline in the granule
it has a melting profile just like most crystalline
structures.  There is a large peak, the center of which is
149F.  So there's melting before and melting after.  Also,
I've mentioned before here that during the swelling (not
melting) of the starch granule that small chain amylose is
"leached" out of the granule and available for enzymic
attack.  Amylose and amylopectin, without any third-order
structure, will not have melting temperatures associated
with them.  They will simply be in solution.


One point Dave hit on that needs to be clarified, and one
that I cannot, is that there's a difference between "barley
starch" and "malted barley starch".  149F might be correct
for barley starch but is probably high for malted barley
starch.  Because the malting process helps make the starch
granule more fragile I'm certain the melting point will be
lower.  Can any of the librarians find the number for malted
barley?


Cheers!

Subject: Sorbate usage summary


For anyone else that is interested, here is the summary of advice I received
on sorbate usage.  Thanks to everyone who replied!


1. Make sure fermentation is stopped before sorbating.  Once fermentation
has stopped, sorbate can prevent new fermentation, but it can't stop
fermentation.
2. Remove as much yeast as possible via natural settling and racking, or
filtration.
3. Use 1/2 tsp per gallon.  Don't boil the sorbate.  Stir the sorbate into
some sanitized water or a small portion of the beverage to dissolve it
before adding it to the whole batch.
4. Use sorbate in conjunction with sulfites.


As far as my particular beverages in question go, I have put the keg of
cider into my beer fridge.  The cold temperatures seem to have put a stop to
the fermentation and I am able to dispense it just fine (using just its own
pressure to push it out - I don't have it hooked up to any CO2).  The mead?
Well, I really wanted a still mead so I will let it ferment out (again),
resweeten as needed, and resorbate properly.




Thanks again,

G'day,
Just as a note, I realised that I am a gimp and included no subject or
reference to what I was dribbling (read: whinging) about yesterday. It is
probably obvious, but it was the post by  another Dave, having a sook about
blokes who talk about non-beer stuff.


Also I know that I am probably regarded as a 'Bruce-come-lately' bloke, but
as you may have guessed, I have strong opinions, and am not afraid to give
them. I am not as elequant, and delicate with the responses I give (too much
beer whilst at the computer is the usual culprit), but I try.


With regard as to the drunkenness issue, it is quite different here in the
great brown land as it is in North Americas.  It is quite common for most
people (the people that I know anyway) to have a beer or two daily, and
public opinion is quite tolerant of such consumption. I am much like Graham,
in that I have one several awards for the consumption of alcohol, and stand
very proud in the fact that the current world record holder for the fastest
drinking of a yard-glass of beer is held by non-other than our former Prime
Minister, Bob Hawke. Yes excess is bad, and regular drunkenness is a problem
for those who encounter it, I don't deny that, but why is getting drunk on
the odd occasion so wrong?  Maybe in the society that I live in, and have
the beliefs of, that I just don't see it.

I too make a lot of our families soap (lucky me, I learned it from my

the chemistry or the whys and how's of the process, I really appreciated
Jeff's post.  It has explained several mishaps through the years as my
father moved us from town to town and "things didn't always work out at
the new house".  Apparent differences in water hardness and the use of
"softened" water would explain most every mishap.  There is still one
that I don't understand in Merced, CA when I used the ash of a green
Sweet Gum tree exclusively and ended up with a lye solution so caustic I
could not cut it enough to make it usable, but that is entirely off

What is on topic is the cleaning of bar glasses.  We in the hospitality
industry (dive bars to the finest private clubs) have been using one
tried and true method for over forty years to ensure a clean, sanitary
glass that doesn't affect head retention ( positively or negatively).
In triple sink cleaning arrangements, the first sink is for detergent
(as opposed to soap) based cleaning, the second is a clean water rinse
of at least 140 degrees F, and the third is for a sanitizer.  While in
kitchens, bleach or chlorine based sanitizer is commonly used at 50 to
100 ppm, in better bars, a special sanitizer is used that contains a
sort of "anti-detergent".  The most common and user friendly is Beer
Clean TM brand.  It comes in individual packets of ~25g which is the
proper amount for a 1.5 gallon sink of water.  I am not at the bar right
now, but tomorrow I will have a packet on my desk if anyone wants more
info on ingredients or manufacturer, just post me.

I don't think this hyperbole is particularly useful and will only serve to
drive the thread further to extremes. I doubt that Steve is saying he
traipses around full tilt drunk every time he drinks beer!  Of course, I
can't really speak for Steve, but as for myself  I do take some issue with
your statements about "not going over the deep end" - who is to define what
the "deep end" is? Where does one draw the line? Personally, I wouldn't want
my kids to see me doubled up over the toilet puking my guts out so, yes, I
drink responsibly enough to avoid this situation (on the other hand,
witnessing the possible negative consequences of too much drinking might
actually be a lesson in itself!). Likewise, I wouldn't want to set an
example of driving after becoming intoxicated but, I also won't deceive my
kids and hide from them the fact that, on occasion, I find drinking past the
point of a light buzz pleasurable.


In my opinion (and it is just and only that) the most important thing when
dealing with kids is honesty. If you try to hide something from a child you
are doing them a disservice, besides, they can smell deception a mile away.
I love beer. I love everything about beer - the aroma, the appearance, the
flavor and, yes, the effect of the alcohol too. Some people have stated that
if they could brew NA beer they would, but to me this would be unacceptable
as it would negatively impact the flavor and remove the intoxicating effect
that I enjoy.  I believe my kids are able to contrast my passion for beer,
the type of passion for all aspects of a fine beer that I imagine all
homebrewers share, with the behavior of others who drink cheap tasteless
mass-marketed beer out of wide-mouthed cans primarily for the effect of the
alcohol. I think my kids are intelligent enough to make the distinction.

As with children, I think the key to keeping "homebrewer does not equal
drunk" lies in being honest and educating the public. By and large the more
general equation "Beer drinker = drunk" is probably pretty well established
in the public's eye. What they need to realize is that, unlike the drinkers
of cheap and tasteless beer,  getting drunk is not the primary goal of the
homebrewer and, in fact, is often not a goal at all.

When I joined the hbd, I had many beer related questions.  The longest it

question...My beer tasted like vodka.  The next day, I was anxious to see my

And they made me relax a little bit.  It was good.  I don't want to have a

what they do are 1) fun people, and 2) good at what they do...


Graham, Phil, Jill, Keith, Lyndon, etc...Can I be an Aussie? :)..


P.S.  There would still be non-beer related posts in the american hbd, they 
would all deal with bac though.  Just food for thought...Not to rag on you,

There has been a couple of great responses to some mashing questions
recently.  I have a similar question regarding the conversion of Decoction
recipes to Infusion Mashing recipes.  I have just built a RIMs with an
inline heating element as well my tun is a converted keg so external heat
addition is also an option, of course so is infusion of boiling water
giving me three modes of heating for step mashing.  My favorite recipe is
for Weizen from Eric Warner's book involving decoction mashing but it is a
lot of work, I would like to duplicate the end product with my RIMs.  How
should his recipe be converted?  If stepping the mash through a temperature
profile what is the best method for raising the temperature? Does the
dilution effect of adding boiling water affect the end product negatively.
The Rims heating rate is 1 deg C per 1.5 minutes.

I agree with Pat's recent comments re/ the desire to not associate
"homebrewing" with "drunk".  "Drunk" is considered by most of the world to
be a derogatory term.


However, I also agree with some of the other posts that getting "drunk" is
not the end of the world.  Yes, I have kids.  No, I do not get "drunk" in
front of them.  However, I do enjoy having more than few beers on the
occasional Saturday night, when the opportunity is right (a designated
driver, good friends, etc.).  Yes, I enjoy the effects of alcohol.  Yes, I
am still a good father.


Hopefully, we can all agree that being "a drunk" is a little different than
occasionally drinking more than one probably should.

It seems to take quite a lot of heating to move the grain temp up to 170's
from mash temps.  I use a HERMS system, and allow circulation and heating,
takes about 15 minutes (Igloo Cooler), and I also noticed that the temp at
the top where the liquor enters is at 170+, but it takes some time for the
temperature at the bottom to reach 170F even during the circulation.


The best thing I have done is to permanently install a dial thermometer near
the bottom of the Igloo mash tun. I need to be patient, for I know the temp
will get there after a time.  Another strange observation, the temps during
mashing 150+F, seem to hold well in the mash tun, but when mashing out and
sparging, the 170+F will not hold without additional heating by sparging.

I apologize to those who have heard enough on this subject.(I know it has
been beat), but...


I find it very hard to believe that there is a "Die Hard" beer brewing
enthusiast out there, that
has never been DRUNK! And if there is.....what the hell are you waiting for?
Look: I don't drink every night, and when I do drink it's usually 1 or 2
beers....but.....there are those times (about once a year) when I "tie one
on".


There are many good things that come from the occasional state of "over
indulgence": for one, you usually end up saying or doing something stupid,
which in retrospect fosters caution and keeps one from repeating the act
anytime soon.(we all need a little kick of
humility from time to time)........Hell, let's face it, half of the
population wouldn't even have been born if it weren't for inebriation.(as
alcohol appears to be the "anti-birth control")
 ...Another bonus is that you won't forget those special times with your
friends, as they will periodically bring up the incident(.....man, you
remember that time.....)   I would like to say that occasional state of OI
is also a way to obtain a new perspective on various things, but the
"revelations" are usually lost by the morning. There is, however, scientific
proof that OI does actually boost energy/productivity level for about 1
week.(after the humility sets in the next day, one usually works real hard
and does all the things that they have been neglecting) Maybe it's the
secret of "youth"......because it usually make you feel like a kid again!
(oooooooooo.....look what we're doing?)


I'm not saying it's O.K. to get trashed and drive, nor am I saying that it's
an excuse to beat your wife, but loosen up folks.......it's just life. I
live a pretty "low key" life, I'm a responsible individual and a role-model
for the children I teach, but once in a while I don't want to be!
On those few occasions when I have been "sauced", it wasn't to hide from
something or mask some deep emotional scar.......it was for a much simpler
reason.....it's fun!!!!    Your hang'n with you friends, your enjoying the
mood, the beers go down REAL easy, you blab a lot of shit(which of course
keeps your thirst up)...and the next thing you know, you've lost
count....(whoooooo cares?!) It really isn't much different from racing dirt
bikes or sky diving. It's a slightly reckless act.

Pat/Skippy, you have fought the good fight and I commend you for it, but
alas, the battle is lost. On Big Brother, a program watched by millions of
people (yes, I watch it much the same way I gawk at horrific car crashes and
country-western music videos), the house drunkards have been given the
challenge to make drinkable beer in 7 days. Now, we all know what beer is
like at that age. My feeling is they won't even bottle it. Can you imagine
if a still fermenting bottle exploded and injured one of the contestants?
They would get more money than the last person in the house. No, I figure in
7 days time, they'll just start dipping their glasses into the bucket and
within a couple of days, it will be gone. You'll have a half dozen people
sitting around pissed to the gills and farting (oh yea, there gonna learn

In the interview he stated his belief that rain that fell during a
thunderstorm had "power", and so was a good thing to drink. I thought that
was pretty cool, so I used to put all kinds of bowls outside to catch the
"thunder water" and then I would drink it. It really had a strange taste
for water, which I attributed to nitrogen. I don't really know if that was
the reason for the taste, though.


After a while, someone mentioned their may be a lot of pollutants in the
rainwater, and I quit the practice. (Also, I done growed up some ;^) )


Anyway, are there any concerns out there in HBD land about using rainwater
in these modern times? It would be easy to catch the runoff from a roof and
direct it into a plastic barrel or garbage can using a rain gutter.
