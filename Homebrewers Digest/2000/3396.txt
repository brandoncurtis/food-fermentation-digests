Unfortunately, this is no longer true. While brewing beer is time consuming,
even if you are using extracts, "making" beer is becoming as simple as
turning grape juice into wine.


BrewHouse and WortWorks sell high-gravity worts that require only an
addition of water and yeast. Paddock Wood, and probably other places, are
selling pails of fresh wort to their local customers that only require
pitching the yeast. In other words, there is a growing market for taking the
brewing out of homebrewing.


This is not necessarily a bad thing. BrewHouse kits got me started before I
leapt into all-grain. Anything that gets more people started into the hobby
is good for the hobby as a whole, although it would be nice if people
progressed beyond that stage. On the down side, it does open up the world of
"beermaking" to those whose sole interest is lowering the cost of feeding
their alcohol consumption habit. In Canada, a bottle of BrewHouse beer costs
about 35 cents, once you get past the initial equipment costs. If you're
sucking back a half dozen wobbly pops a day, the savings quickly add up, and
all it takes is a couple of hours of your time TOTAL to ferment, prime and
bottle. Hell, if you're going through them that fast you don't really need
to do more than give the bottles a good rinsing. They won't be around long
enough to get infected and if they did, would the guzzler even care?


Nope, it's never been easier for the drunks to get into homebrew..., excuse
me, beermaking. The fact that we do not consider them to part of the
homebrew fraternity, per se, is likely a subtlety that will be lost on the
general populace.

Subject: Stupid brewer trick #1739a




Hi all.


I have a short stupid brewer trick story followed by a couple of questions.


I recently bottled a batch using in part a Phils Philler and a plastic
bottling bucket.  After bottling, my typical cleanup includes 
soaking the bottling bucket plus miscellaneous plastics like hoses
etc. used in bottling, in a diluted bleach solution.  Here's the
stupid trick.  I decided that I would throw in the Philler as
well.  I had intended on only leaving the Philler in the bleach
solution for ten or so minutes, but as luck would have it, I
got busy doing other tasks and left it overnight.  When I
remembered what I had done, I went to empty out the
bucket and retrieve the Philler.  


What I found was a black substance leaking from the Philler
on to the bottom of the pail.  I *think* the Philler is made from
brass and coated with some nickel alloy.  Upon emptying the
bucket I rinsed everything with hot tap water.  I also tried
scrubbing the black stuff off with my fingers and a soft sponge,
but this did not help.


My questions.  


1.  What is this black stuff?  
2.  How do I remove it from my pail and Philler?  
3.  Will the Philler be safe to use, assuming it can be cleaned?


Thanks for any help,

I pondered this until Graham bobbed in.  It depends on who you want to adopt
you.  As Graham pointed out, the apprenticeship for being from the north is
pretty tough, though probably easier for foreigners than southeners. Many
don't survive. It's time consuming to become an honorary aborigine, and
that's a totally different program to becoming a Queenslander.  


It's a lot easier in the southern states, but you'd just be filling the
vacuum left by southerners heading north.  (Don't remind me)  A funny
surname helps.


Then there's places like Coober Pedy (outback opal mining town), just
foreigners of every creed.  They'll stitch you up with citizenship before
you even land, if you happen to sit next to one on the flight over and let
on you like beer, flies and dust.

Concerning Keith Menefy's post about brewing a beer

to go for a special CAP type brew!
 Keith likes the flavor. Lots of people are enjoying
CAP's since it was brought to light from past history.


 I considered brewing a modernized version of an old
Mexican brew: a Chicha.   Being as how nobody sells
Corn Malt, They malt thier own, then they crush it.
 
They use some strange ingrediants which I will replace
with more modern malts.

 They mash the mixture at 160F for one hour, then
they collect first runnings for the boil.
 It should make an interesting brew!

my post from yesterday seemed to get chopped up, ending up making
 no sense at all 
(no comments on this being the usual state of affairs....)
what it should have said was:


Brad asked about mashing in high and allowing temps. to drop. 
My own observation is through an overnight mash, which obviously 
starts high and ends low. The few I have done seem to have 2 common
characteristics - very high extraction (in the most recent case, 
was aiming for a 1.048 wort and ended up with 1.060) and 
high fermentability - the same wort has ended up at 
1.010 using Whitelabs San Fran lager. Dave B. was alluding 
to this in his latest post also.

Recently there have been some threads on brewing ginginger beer.  Was
wondering if anybody has tried to brew anything similar to Vernor's ginger
ale.   I can remember as a boy growing up in Michigan taking a sip or two of
this concoction--remember it as very strong and burning all the way down.  I
didn't appreciate it as a boy but probably would now.  I know it is still
made but wonder if it is the same version of that I remember from the early
sixties.  Has anybody attempted to duplicate that Vernor's taste??

Subject: anchor tour


I just got back a few days ago from the Anchor tour.  Wow!! It was excellent
and tasting the fresh stuff was a treat.  In the beginning of the tour they
talk a bit about each of there brews and give some history.  We were lucky
enough to get to sample the Liberty ale before the tour even started and I
was psyched.  I almost jumped over the bar to grab it.  


I don't know how much of this info has been printed in the past but here is
some stuff that is new I think.  They brew 110 barrel batches.  They use
first runnings from 3 mashes  to make the Old Foghorn.  Only Foghorn and
Libery are dryhopped.  They wouldnt confirm if the same hops for dryhopping
were used in both although it sure smelled like it.  Small beer is now
available in keg as well as the old bottle as well.  mash time on all beers
is 90 minutes.  They krausen their beer at 3 days after fermentation begins
by filling tank to 85% full with 3 day old beer and then filling remainder
with 1 day old beer.  They flash pasterize.  annual production is 100,000
barrels.  this compares to about 500,000 at Sierra nevada supposedly.  tend
to do 4-5 batches per day each taking about 4-5 hours to complete. only
lager made now is Steam.  Porter is 10% dark grains (chocolate and black
patent). the mash is direct gas fired and mash is at multiple temps from I
think 117 to 170 or so. production schedule tends to be all lager or all ale
on a daily basis.  70% of production is steam beer.  their fermentation
tanks are stainless and not on the roof even though in the ol`days they were
redwood pitch lined and on the roof. small beer is 2.7% ABV.  old foghorn is
brewery aged for 6-9 months and varies greatly in alcohol per year from mid
8 to 10ish.


their hop room smells fanatstic.  wish I could have taken a bail of hops
home with me.  the hallway between the stairs and the bathroom smells just
like malt.  perhaps the mill is located somewhere near there.  they said
that the grain is weighed and ground somewhere up thereabove the mash tuns.
their 3 vessel system is about 50 yrs old and copper.  pretty neat looking
for sure.]


very fun tour and I'll go back for sure again.


Getting to taste all their brews was fun.  Plenty to drink for sure with
multiple tastings if you wanted.  guess I tried Liberty around 5 times and
Foghorn 2 or 3.  Sample size was perhaps 4-6 oz. I was surprized how much
aroma of roast and chocolate the porter had when sampled.  i don't think
that this travels well heading east.  


we headed up to the Tornado for a quick drink so I could check it out and we
had some Boont Amber from anderson valley and I had a Hop 2 It by ???.  The
Boont was good on tap and the Hop 2 It seemed to have too much diacetyl.
Gotta get there for the Barley wine festival.  Over to Ali Babas cave for
mediteranean dinner and then jump a red eye back to NY.

How I have seen it done:
1) Get a hot glue gun.. nothing is ever any fun if you can't burn 
yourself trying.
2) Get some thin (1/8-3/16") urethane foam, cut into squares that 
mostly fill the bottlecap
3) Find a hobby store and hold your breath as you get past the 
scented candles until you find "tie-tac" type fasteners  Buy some.
4) Put the sharp side of the tac's back through the foam squares.
5) Put hot glue on the bottlecap's inside surface (or on the foam 
square, or both, just to be safe)
6) Stick the foam back firmly to the inside of the bottlecap, taking 
care not to puncture yourself on the pointy end of the tac.
7) Let cool
8) Stick the pointy end through the garment (or body part, if you're 
in to that sort of thing) and secure it with the tac's clasp.
9) Impress your friends with spiffy bottlecap attire... ooooo, ahhhhhh!

Mate, it is because you're a youngin' that you will be well familiar with
the art of the 'chunder'. A rainbow yawn is my personal favourite
expression, but chundering is the result of partaking in just that bit too
much homebrew, and deciding that you just needed another look at it.

See mate, you know what a blunder is, seems that you've got the art down

distance. It is often a begginners mistake to go for consistency, that's how
you can always tell a pro, they're shootin' it out a looooooong way.

Back to me.


Sorry, I was a bit terse with my description of what I call hot break.  
When the wort is first heated, as it approaches boiling temperature, a
layer of foam starts to form.  As the boil starts, this layer becomes quite
thick in both dimension and density.  I have to carefully control the
temperature or it will boil over quite easily.  After some number of
minutes, this foam begins to disappear and soon, all is gone and the
surface of the wort is clear, even under a hard rolling boil.


Later, I have found that if I add water to top off the level, or in the
case of a few days ago, I dropped in the immersion chiller, the same
process described above is repeated.


My question was, is this detrimental of beneficial to the final product?

Subject: Black Cat Mild


Thanks to Keith Busby <kbusby`at`facstaff.wisc.edu> for relaying the report
that Moorhouse's Black Cat mild from Burnley, Lancashire, won the Best Beer
in Britain at the GBBF.  That is good news for mild lovers.  Here are some
details about the beer from the CAMRA Real Ale Almanac:


Black Cat Mild
OG 1034  ABV 3.2%
Ingredients:  Halcyon pale malt (60%), chocolate malt (10%), invert sugar
(17%), flaked maize (13%).  Fuggles whole hops.


Tasting notes:
Nose:  Roasted grain and nut aromas
Palate:  Chocolate notes in mouth, sweet but dry finish
Comments:  Dark mild with roast malt character.


I note that this is a lot of adjunct, and wonder if the invert sugar is
caramelly.  The invert I tasted in Essex had a mild flavor.  There is also
a lot of chocolate malt, which might contribute to the noted dry finish,
but that might also come from hops.  I wish the hopping lever were
reported.  And, of course, the yeast used would have a big influence on the
character of the beer.  Moorhouse has been around since 1865, so it may
well use an old, unique strain.


Wish we could taste it.

It's generally not a good idea to use softened water in brewing - and it's
especially important not to use it for all grain brewing, at least not as
is.  The reason is that the softener substitutes two sodium ions for every
calcium ion in the water (it also replaces the magnesium).  We want calcium
for the mash enzymes to work properly, and sodium is generally not wanted
in very high levels.  If your water is hard enough (enough calcium and
magnesium) to warrant softening, then you'll have an awful lot of sodium.


Your unsoftened water may be fine for brewing, but you should get an
analysis first of the important stuff - calcium, sulfate, total hardness,
alkalinity, iron - you could search the archives for more detail.


I hope you'll report back on how the beer turned out.

A mole of CO2 weighs 44 grams and occupies 22.4 liters at standard
temperature and pressure.  So if you are carbonating your 2 liters of water
with 2 volumes at STP, the CO2 would weigh about 8 grams.  Of course, at
colder temperatures, 2 volumes would be more gas and would weigh more, but
that requires more calculations than I feel like doing.


At any rate, it seems it would be measurable by an accurate scale.

Subject: multiple hot/cold breaks


Pete calinski asks:


So my questions are:


Why does adding low temperature water or an immersion chiller cause the
foam to form.
(In the case of the immersion chiller, a layer of copper oxide comes off
each time but I don't know if that is useful information.)?


Multiple breaks are caused by the decrease in temperature causing material
that was soluble at high temperatures to crash out of solution when you pass
through the "meta-stable" solubility zone that exists above the solubility
limit.


The layer of copper oxide that comes off may provide additional nucleation
sites (termed "seeding") for further material to crash out of solution and
crystallize/precipitate on.


The foam would be caused by the rapid formation of small solids sites for
boiling bubbles to nucleate and grow on.  Even if your oxide layer isn't
flaking off, it is most likely rough enough to provide nucleation sites.


Presumably, these breaks probably cause less of a cold break to occur later
in the process upon chilling thus perhaps reducing cold break material that
makes it into your primary fermentor.  One might think that intermediately
formed hot break material may solubilize after boiling temperature is
reached and this is probably partially true.


Hope this helps.  Nice to see my crystallization course helping in something
besides work.

At first I thought it would be like trying to weigh a fart, but I decided it
would be a good exercise in seeing if I still remember my chemistry.  Plus,
it's been about a decade since I used this equation last and it still
plagues my nightmares - even many years after college.  Some psychologists
believe it's best to confront your demons to chase them away.  Here goes...


Let's assume that you're drinking you average beer served up in a pint glass
at 45 degrees F and carbonated at 2.5 volumes.  You'd need to pressurize
your keg to 13.3 psi to get that level of carbonation.  Now that's 13.3 over
standard pressure (which is 14.7 psi) so you really have 28 psi on your beer
to work in the Ideal Gas Law equation.


Your pint glass is 0.47 Liters, but you're shoving 2.5 times that volume
(1.175 L) into it, so you will need to know how many grams of CO2 is in
1.175 L of gas at 45 F and 28 psi.


Do a few conversions of your numbers to get them into the SI system and plug
'em into the PV=nRT equation.  Solve for n and you'll get 0.0973 moles.  CO2
has a MW of 44.01 g/mol so that leaves us with a grand total of 4.28g of CO2
in your pint glass.  You should be able to measure this on your balance.
This just doesn't look right to me, but I've checked my math a few times and
all adds up.  Can we get a REAL chemist to check this?  Then maybe I can
sleep well at night again ;-)


If my math is OK then your actual observed value may be off a little since
you'll lose some CO2 upon dispense, plus you'll have to tare a degassed
sample.  Would I bother with this?  No.  Stick to the carbonation charts and
if you trust your thermometer and your regulator, you'll be better off.

Generally "more wheat" will increase the liklihood of a stuck sparge. 
Looking at your recipe, I would increase the 2-row to ~50% - of course that 
will alter the style/taste profile.


>>>I couldn't get the hops I wanted in plugs so I used pellets unfortunately

I feel you pain (been there, burped...). When I can't avoid pellets, I limit 
my straining activities to a copper scrubby enshrined in cheese cloths (no 
heroics...). Failing that, I let the trub pass through knowing that I will 
leave much of it in the decantation to the secondary. Having a few extra 
beers at that time helps too... ;-)

Subject: Beta amylase lifetime


Brewsters:


Aaron Sepanski said something like "Bet beta amylase is denatured at 150F".
I'll bet you'd be wrong, Aaron.  We have had many long, heated discussions
on this subject ( see the HBD archives) .  But in practical terms beta
amylase <in a mash of normal thickness at the normal calcium content ,
normal temperature program, etc., etc.> will have a halflife of somewhere
around 15 minutes even at 158F. SO given the higher reaction rate at 158F
it is still pretty effective for maybe 30 to 45 minutes.


I am curious about how you came to the conclusion you had to add beta
amylase enzymes and other enzymes to your rmashes. Why, how and when?
- -----------------------------------
Ron. I suggest you weigh the CO2 cylinder to see how much you have added
rather than the keg. Better chance to get a good result,IMHO and it will
put less strain on the scale. I have used a postal scale like this with a
small cylinder.

Subject: Better Burradoo Backyard Bathysphere Beliefs


For Jeff, Glen and anyone else interested,


Eric Ahrendt emailed me to suggest that when the regulator is set to a
pressure, it's internal mechanism will maintain this pressure against
ambient, regardless of ambient changes. So, if Jill pulled the big lever to
vacuumate (my own word here) Wes and me (which she would dearly love to do,
if only I would give her the opportunity) the pressure reading on the
regulator would remain unchanged.
So if it was set at 15psi (which is really 30psi above absolute), it would
remain at 15psi after evacuation. Similarly, if Jill slaved away for half
the day on the billows in an attempt to blow Wes and me up, despite a much
greater pressure within the bathysphere, our regulator would still read
15psi.


Thinking about it, I suspect Eric's suggestion is correct.




Cheers
Phil
